<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE CYCLADES IN THE LATER BRONZE AGE: A SYNOPSIS' (PLATES I1-2) THE present survey, based upon work carried out in the Cyclades in 1952 and 1953 and in museums in Greece and elsewhere, is intended to offer a more comprehensive view of Cycladic archaeology than has hitherto appeared. An attempt has been made to gather together both published and unpublished material from sites which flourished during this period; interpreta- tions of the former have been revised in the light of recent knowledge of contemporary cultures in Greece and Crete. Unpublished pottery in museums has been studied, new sites recorded, and fresh evidence collected from the sites themselves.2 INTRODUCTION Before this material is considered, some mention must be made of the view, once current, that in the Middle Bronze Age 'Phylakopi is the unique survivor of the Cycladic civilisation... the other islands are deserted, or at least cultural blanks'.3 An attempt was even made by Aberg to show that many of the Cycladic cist-tombs (notably in Melos, Naxos, Paros, Anti- paros, Amorgos, Syros, and Siphnos) belonged to the Middle and Late Cycladic period.* That there is in fact no lacuna in Middle Cycladic archaeology will, it is hoped, become clear from the survey of the material which will be given below, but a few facts may be recalled first which appear to show conclusively that the contents of the cist-tombs should be assigned to the Early Cycladic period. Of the three classes of pottery found in the tombs, the stratigraphical evidence from the site of Phylakopi makes it clear that the class with simple herring-bone incision appeared first, for there it belongs to the very first settlement, antedating the First City for which we have house- remains.s The comparatively early date of this pottery (the types of which generally have no pronounced base) is confirmed by the fact that similar types are characteristic of Early Bronze Age ware in Greece and Crete, while the 'stalked' vase (the only exception with regard to the base) is characteristic of the Early Bronze Age at Troy.6 The assigning of similar ware from Pyrgos in Crete to the Early Minoan III period is not convincing, for that site is unstratified.7 SSpecial abbreviations used throughout this article are as follows: AMO The Ashmolean Museum, Oxford.

SCHOLES The second class of incised pottery with more complex designs and stamped circular patterns develops later in the Phylakopi stratification, and about the same time appears the patterned ware. A commonly occurring type in the latter technique is the sauceboat, which has parallels in Early Helladic II-III strata at Asine and Korakou. That such ware is referable to an early period is emphasized by the find, in one of the Syros tombs in which such a sauceboat appeared, of a pin of a type found in the Third City of Troy.' Moreover the same City produced examples of the type of blade found in several Cycladic tombs, and an example of a double-spouted sauceboat in gold.z In only one case has incised ware been found in the same context as an authenticated Middle Bronze Age type; this was in Syros, where a Grey Minyan kantharos was found together with an incised pyxis, but it is very likely from the evidence that the Minyan vase represents a later intrusion.3 Indeed, it is expressly stated by the excavators at Phylakopi that in the Second City 'incised ware only survives in coarse household varieties that have no further significant history'.* Although at Eleusis stamped pyxis lids were found in a Middle Helladic I deposit, and at Eutresis in a deposit transitional between Early Helladic III and Middle Helladic I, this does not necessarily prove that such ware was still being manufactured in the Cyclades. None of the patterned ware of the cist-tombs shows any affinity to well-authenticated Middle Cycladic types, but it is paralleled rather by some Early Helladic patterned ware, such as that found at Rafina, which has almost identical designs and types.5 Of all the sites in the Cyclades, it has been Phylakopi in Melos which has provided the most abundant material for study. It is hardly surprising that the island which possessed one of the richest deposits of obsidian (a material still used in the Late Bronze Age) in the Mediterranean area provides one of the most important settlements in the Aegean, but recently Kondoleon has shown that in Naxos too a settlement of not inconsiderable size flourished at the same time. But evidence has been found to show that at least twelve other settlements existed during the Middle Cycladic period, some of which had flourished earlier. The more widely distributed remains of the Early Cycladic period would suggest a greater population at that time, but it must be remembered that much of the evidence for this period comes from cemeteries for which no corresponding settlement has been discovered. On the other hand, we may perhaps suppose that some form of synoecism took place in the later period, which is generally admitted to have been a time of instability.6 It should be noted that without exception the settlements of the Middle Cycladic period share two features in common: they are either on or near the sea with sheltered anchorage near by, and they have close at hand some of the best land in the Cyclades from the agricultural point of view. These factors, taken in conjunction with the proximity of the Melian obsidian supply, would have made them self-supporting. There is no evidence, on the other hand, to suggest that more barren islands such as Pholegandros and Sikinos supported communities at this time. In Ios, Antiparos, Kimolos, and Andros, an island with many sheltered inlets, settlements may yet be found; in the two latter Late Bronze Age settlements did exist. SITES The following catalogue lists both known and hitherto unrecorded sites of the Middle and Late Cycladic periods. Only the main features have been noted, as the pottery is considered below.

In the E.C. period the settlement on Akroterion Kefala was a flourishing one; later it was abandoned and its inhabitants may have been absorbed into the settlement at Ayia Irini, a mere I j km. south.</page><page sequence="3">THE CYCLADES IN THE LATER BRONZE AGE: A SYNOPSIS II AMORGOS Aigiale, modern Vigli. This site, consisting of a small acropolis in the north-west corner of the island, is situated about I km. west of Tholaria, and 200 m. above sea-level; the sea itself lies about I km. away to the north and west. Diimmler saw sherds here which he termed 'Mycenaean'.' The sherds which I saw testify to a period of occupation from the prehistoric to late classical periods, and included some fragments of Middle Cycladic pithoi. The ancient walls to be seen amid the modern terrace-walls are of archaic or classical date. Arkesine, now Kastri. This is likewise an unexcavated acropolis site, situated directly on the sea in the southern sector of the island, I km. north of Vroutsi; a small cove lies to the east. Its most outstanding feature today is a ruined Hellenistic tower, but to judge from the variety of sherds there, it was occupied for as long a period as Aigiale. Diimmler likewise noted 'Mycenaean' sherds here, and recently a group of Mycenaean bronze swords and daggers, presumably from a tomb, were recovered from the peasants living near by.2 Evidence for a preceding Middle Cycladic settlement comes from tombs found in the vicinity, which contained pottery of a type transitional between the Early and Middle Cycladic periods.3 Xilokeratidi. This small village is built upon two slight promontories on the northern side of the Bay of Katapola, which provides the most sheltered anchorage in the whole island. There is a large archaic and classical site on the high ground of Minoa (now called Moundoulia) on the opposite side of the bay, but it was at Xilokeratidi that Bosanquet purchased a Mycenaean stirrup-jar of L.H. III type.4 Possibly this and other Mycenaean vases obtained from Amorgos came from tombs in the vicinity, and if this is so, it is more than likely that there was a Mycenaean settle- ment in the area, for land communications between the small plain, which lies to the east of the three villages of Moundoulia, Katapola, and Xilokeratidi, and the rest of the island are extremely difficult. ANDROS Palaioupolis. Three L.H. III vases, reputed to have come from Palaioupolis on the west coast, are in the museum in the town of Andros.s Although Palaioupolis has been excavated in part, nothing of the prehistoric period has been found, although further searches in the area might uncover a prehistoric settlement, as the classical remains themselves were found at a great depth owing to the alluvial deposits brought down from the hills by the heavy winter rains.6 On the other hand, the smaller but more sheltered bays of Gaviron, Andros, and Korthi would seem better suited for such a settlement. DELOS Kynthos. On this small hill, which dominates the rest of the island, a settlement flourished in the Early and Middle Cycladic periods.' Good anchorage is to be had between the island and Rheneia in fair weather, and in time of storm the inlet of Ormos Gourna can be utilized by small vessels. The Temenos. Excavation has shown, somewhat acci- dentally, that in Late Cycladic times Mount Kynthos was deserted in favour of the flat land to the north-west, the area of the later Temenos. The most interesting discovery in recent years has been that of a 'votive deposit' under the Artemision, which included many fine pieces of Mycenaean carved ivory.s The settlement in this area flourished throughout the Mycenaean period in all its phases.9 Evi- dence for tombs belonging to the settlement has been given by the find of an alabastron in the Purification Trench on Rheneia, and possibly also by the find of some Mycenaean pottery in the 'Hyperborean Tomb' by the Portico of Antigonus.'o KEOs (ZEA) Ayia Irini. This site lies on a small low-lying promontory which juts southward into the Bay of Ayios Nikolaos in the north-western sector of the island, and on it stands a small church (PLATE Ia). A few shallow pits were dug here by Welter." A local Greek antiquarian also listed this among the island's ancient sites.'2 On both the east and west the sea has eroded the settlement, so that house-walls, some of them with fragments of painted plaster and probably be- longing to the Mycenaean period, may be seen projecting. A modern road bisects the site and conveniently provides two complete, if rough, views of the stratification. On the west side of the promontory a series of large slabs of rock projecting into the water suggests that at this point was built a breakwater or quay (PLATE Ib). On the east side cuttings in the rock for house-foundations have been slightly submerged; probably in prehistoric times the sea had not taken such complete possession of what is now the shallow Bay of Vourkari. On the evidence of the sherds, the settlement dates back to at least late Early or early Middle Cycladic times, and continued spasmodically to the Hel- lenistic period. Of particular interest were some fragments of Minoan pottery. KIMOLOS Ellinika. This site is in the south-west of the island, not far away from Phylakopi in Melos. In ancient times the small island of Ayios Andreas was joined to it, and Bent saw house-foundations in the shallow water which divides the two today.'" The coastline is much eroded and the sea has destroyed some of the site, which appears to have been AM AM xi. 40. 2 JHS lxxi-lxxii. 251. AM e.g. AM xi, pl. ii, G. 4 CVA Gt.

On a low conical hill between the southern creeks of the Bay of Loutra sherds give some indication of habitation here in the Middle Cycladic, and possibly also Late Cycladic Period. There is no great depth of soil here, and this does not seem to have been a site of much impor- tance, but perhaps it attracted settlers on account of the safe anchorage to be had in the small cove of Ayia Irini to the east. MELOS Ayios Elias. Sherds, mainly from the Geometric to Byzantine periods, litter the slopes of this small natural acropolis standing Ioo m. above sea-level near the coast on the eastern side of the Bay of Melos. Middle Cycladic sherds have been found there;' 'Mycenaean' sherds were seen by Mackenzie on the east slope.2 Phylakopi. This site, perhaps the most important in the whole of the Cyclades, was inhabited throughout the Bronze Age, as the excavations carried out by the British School of Archaeology have shown.3 It stands on the north coast of the island, and in ancient times probably consisted of a peninsula joined to the mainland at the south-west corner.4 The fortification wall which cut off the settlement from the mainland proper still stands to a height of 3 m. in places. Some of the settlement has clearly been eroded, and areas on the east have not been investigated. It is reported that some vases were carried away by the Germans during the last war. Shaft-graves and chamber-tombs were uncovered during the British excavations, but most of them were either ruined or plundered, so that it was practically impossible for the excavators to judge to what period they had belonged. Unfortunately most of the site is now in a bad state of preservation. MYKONOS Ormos Korfos. Two chamber-tombs of Mycenaean type, long since plundered, were seen here on the western side of the bay.s As no Mycenaean settlement has been located in this or any other part of the island, it is possible that these tombs may have belonged to the settlement on Delos, which is only a few kilometres away by sea. Palaikastro. This is a small flat-topped hill approximately Ij km. inland from the south-eastern sweep of the Bay of Panormos. In ancient times it probably stood much closer to the sea, which has clearly receded, leaving behind it a long shoal beach. On the summit are traces of archaic and classical occupation, together with part of a fortification wall. On the south slope, however, I noted Minyan sherds and other evidence of occupation during the Middle Cycladic period. NAXOS Grotta-Palati. Grotta is the name given to the eroded coastal strip by the town of Naxia which lies directly to the south-east of the small island of Palati, joined to it by a causeway. Welter found abundant traces of prehistoric occupation in 193o in the whole of this area.6 More recently Dr. Kondoleon has uncovered part of an important settle- ment covering the prehistoric and Geometric periods.7 A megaron of Mycenaean type has been found, and pottery belonging to the same period promises to be almost as plentiful as that from Phylakopi. The site is by no means exhausted, but it is difficult to excavate owing to the encroachment of the sea. The cemetery belonging to this settlement is indicated by a group of low mounds scattered with sherds on the rising ground north-east of Grotta. Rizokastelia. This is a rocky natural acropolis about Ij km. to the south-west of the village of Tripodhes. Like Palaikastro in Mykonos, it once stood much closer to the sea, which has now receded considerably to the west; peasants digging in the flat plain to the west frequently come across a deposit of sand and pebbles deep below the surface soil (PLATE 2a). The site was tested by Stephanos, who considered that it had had a long history from the early prehistoric to some later period.8 It was certainly inhabited in Middle Cycladic times, and as evidence for the Mycenaean period, I noted part of a L.H. III kylix near the summit.9 There are also abundant traces of habitation on the steep lower slopes, and the remains of a stepped street or stairway near the summit. PAROS Paroikia. The prehistoric, Geometric, and Hellenistic site lies on a small eminence in the centre of the town of Paroikia on the south coast of the bay. It was excavated by Rubensohn, who found there pottery belonging to each phase of the Bronze Age, together with scanty house- remains.'o The site is probably not exhausted, but the presence of a modern church and houses makes investiga- tion in a southerly direction wellnigh impossible. SIPHNOS Kastro. This small natural acropolis on the east coast of the island is furnished with a small cove and beach to the south. It was investigated by the British School, and small quantities of E.C. and M.C. pottery were found, which the excavators believed to have been dislodged by builders at a later date." In the region of the Kastro, but not on it, was found a Mycenaean sherd, which may indicate a small settlement at least during that period. To Froudhi tou Kalamitsiou. This is a lofty outcrop of rock, practically sheer on its north side, about I( km. north of the harbour of Vathy. A small cove lies not far away to the north-west.

SYROS Ayios Loukas. In an isolated tomb in this north-western area of the island, Tsountas found a Minyan vase in a cist- tomb which seemed to represent a secondary interment.2 No settlement of the later Bronze Age, however, has been located. The most likely place for one would be below the modern town of Hermoupolis, which possesses one of the best harbours in the Cyclades, but in view of the extent of the town, the chances of finding such a settlement now seem remote. TENOS Akroterion Ourion. This small promontory rises into a conical hill approximately 24 km. south-east of the town of Tenos. To the west of it is a long shoal beach, and on the east a small rocky cove. It is unexcavated, but some sherds from the site are housed in the museum in the Church of the Virgin. There is abundant evidence for habitation here during all phases of the Bronze Age and the early part of the Geometric period, with the emphasis on the Middle Cycladic period, which is represented by much Minyan ware. At two points on the terraced slopes courses of large, roughly-hewn blocks can be seen; on the south side of the hill they still extend to a length of approximately forty paces, and in front of them is a slight abutment I.4 m. in width (PLATE 2b). On the west a shorter stretch of similar blocks, in front of which a modern terrace-wall has been built up, is to be seen. As sherds of the prehistoric, and especially the Middle Cycladic period, are predominant on this site, I would venture to suggest that these blocks may represent part of a fortification system contemporary with that built at Phylakopi, for the technique employed on the two sites is very similar. In the Early Cycladic period the fortification systems at such sites as Khalandriani in Syros and Ayios Andreas in Siphnos were composed of much smaller stones, whilst the fortification walls of the archaic and classical periods are more precise in construction than those at Phylakopi or Akroterion Ourion. THERA (SANTORINI) Therasia. The prehistoric site on the south coast of this small island was investigated by Alafousos and Nomikos, and later by Fouqu6 in 1867.3 Remains of two houses came to light which had been engulfed in volcanic ash by an eruption at some period anterior to that which created the central bay of Thera and cut off Therasia on the eastern side.4 The circumstances of their destruction have preserved details of house-construction in the later Bronze Age in a manner unique in the Cyclades. Akrotiri. Pottery of a similar kind to that found in Therasia was uncovered in remains of houses at three points near the north coast of this promontory by Fouqu6, Mamet, and Gorceix.s Kamara. Similar remains and pottery were found by Zahn in the river-bed in this region in the south-eastern sector of Thera.6 Exomiti. This is the provenance given for a vase purchased by von Schiffin I879.7 It is an area, however, better known for its rock-cut tombs of a much later date. Akrot. Koulomvon and Mesavouno. Vases belonging to the same period as the above are reported to have been found in both these areas, in the extreme north and south of the island.8 There is no evidence to attest a settlement of Mycenaean type in this or any other area of the island. THE CYCLADIC POTTERY OF THE MIDDLE BRONZE AGE The following analysis is based upon the sequence of styles found at the site of Phylakopi in Melos, for not only has the bulk of the pottery belonging to this period been found at this site, but also it was the potters of Melos who were foremost in creating a distinctive Cycladic style. In this new classification the nomenclature adopted by the excavators has been to a certain extent discarded; the pottery has been divided up into homogeneous classes according to type and decoration. A. THE RECTILINEAR STYLE9 Under this somewhat comprehensive heading I include three classes of pottery decorated with predominantly rectilinear patterns. We are concerned with three techniques, lustrous dark-on- light, matt dark-on-light, and light-on-dark. In the first two a light slip is added to the dark red of the clay, and in the third the surface of the pot is usually slightly burnished before the white paint is applied. The bulk of the material comes from Phylakopi, being furnished by the later ' Cf. D. Fimmen, Die Kret.-Myk.

SCHOLES deposits of the First City and some deposits in the Second, a fact which indicates that the fall of the First City did not seriously interfere with the ceramic development.' The first technique had its origin in Urfirnis, and the designs on many of the pots are taken over from the still popular incised wares, as Furumark has shown.2 The second technique evolved later, probably because the Melian potters discovered that the lustrous paint did not show off to advantage on their coarse and porous clay.3 The third technique was derived directly from contemporary E.M. III and M.M. I ware. Examples of the three classes have also been furnished by Paros and Amorgos, whilst sherds of the second technique came to light in Keos and Tenos, and were found in Naxos by Kondoleon. The types are as follows. Beaked jug. This is represented most commonly in the dark-on-light techniques. The attachment of the handle close to the neck shows it to have an origin common with that of the so-called duck-vase.4 Usually there is no pro- nounced base, but it does occur in one example in con- junction with a body of somewhat angular profile which indicates that the vessel was made in two sections and later joined.s The commonest form of decoration is one of horizontal stripes across the beak and shoulder, with a pendant scheme of decoration below which occasionally shows curvilinear tendencies; this is a scheme of decoration paralleled on jugs from Crete and Aegina.6 One jug from Amorgos, however, is of particular interest on account of its rather unusual decoration incorporating a cross and small circles.' These elements of a non-Cycladic character perhaps provide a clue to the origin of similar decorative features which occur on some sherds from Phylakopi in the matt dark-on-light technique.8 It is a form of decoration which points to the East; indeed close correspondences are seen on pots from stratum 4 at T(p6 Gawra in Iraq.9 Pithos. Of two types, the first with narrow neck and flat rim did not occur very often.'x The more popular type has a ledge rim and two vertically pierced side-lugs, and much heavier Froportions." The decoration is usually confined to the area above the handle level, although there is often a pendant scheme below, as on thejugs.'2 The upper decora- tive field consists most often of vertically or horizontally divided zones, sometimes incorporating cross-hatched orna- ments and even circular motifs, such as seem to have been derived from patterns on Cretan light-on-dark ware.'3 It is in this type of vessel that we find close parallels for the decoration of some Middle Helladic pithoi from Aegina and the Mainland.'4 Round-necked jug. This type seems to have been less popular than the beaked type discussed above. One example in the light-on-dark technique is supplied with plastic 'breasts', an Anatolian characteristic which recurs later; others are decorated with a pendant scheme.'s Spouted bowl. Numerous examples of this type which evolved from the incurved bowl of the Early Bronze Age were found at Phylakopi. The decoration in matt dark-on- light technique is confined to the exterior of the rim, the rest of the vessel being left plain or in some cases covered with a red, burnished slip.'6 The type was a popular one and the simple decorative scheme (at least in its more linear forms) has parallels in Aegina and on the Mainland. Again there is a connexion with pottery from the East, for several bowls from Tarsus show similarities.'7 Cup. Tojudge from the evidence at Phylakopi, two shapes were current. The first is straight-sided, with one vertical handle, and is most commonly represented in the matt dark-on-light technique.'s The second has a more elegant, convex profile, and no handle; possibly it is the forerunner of the 'panelled cup' of a later period.'9 Both are painted with the same type of ornament. A unique specimen with possibly two handles seems to have copied some Minyan type.20 Kernos. The kernos, or 'cluster-vase', is a peculiarly Cycladic type, and its manufacture seems to have ceased with that of the production of this class of ware. Several examples were furnished by the tombs and settlement of Phylakopi, all decorated in the dark-on-light technique mostly with zigzag patterns.2' Spouted jar. One complete example was found at Phyla- kopi with a small basket-handle across the rim, decorated in matt black. Another example with perforations, although fragmentary, seems to have belonged to the same type.22 Askos. This type does not seem to have been commonly found among this class of painted ware. One example has an unusual design of hatched strips and vertical fish alter- nating, while the other, apparently a much taller specimen, Phyl Phyl 258-9. 2 MP 217-19. 3 Phyl 93, n. 1; 251. * Cf. op. cit. pl. ix. 7 with pl. iv. 6. s BSA xvii, pl. v. 162. 6 e.g. Phyl pl. ix. 2-1o; AM xlii, figs. 58, 59, 61, 75.

This bag-shaped type is furnished with a slight spout, and is paralleled by a M.H. I type found at Asine.2 Of two examples from Phylakopi, the more interest- ing is decorated with a simple but realistic drawing portray- ing a bird in the act of catching a worm; a star in the field serves as filling-ornament.3 Many similar animal and human forms (not to mention the representation of a ship with tall mast and one bank of oars, which must be one of the first portrayals of its kind in Aegean art) are found in the later examples of pottery painted in the matt dark-on-light technique.4 Some of these clearly are pictorializations of hatched geometrical figures, as is seen in a transitional example, where the head, legs, and tail of an animal have been added to a hatched triangle.s Similarly a snake is pictorialized from a loose spiral ornament.6 Pottery from the site of Kolonna in Aegina shows that there also potters were experimenting along similar lines, but the source for the new trend may have been Crete, where several examples of such pictorialization have been found.' Quite recently a sherd painted in the light-on-dark technique was found in the M.M. I palace of Phaistos showing a human figure very like one in the same technique from Phylakopi.8 Interesting as these quaint human and animal figures are in themselves, their importance lies in the fact that with their advent the way was being paved for the free-field type of composition; for the new creatures could not be confined within the rigid schemes of rectilinear division which is the hallmark of the Rectilinear Style. B. MINYAN WARE On excavated sites in the Cyclades Grey Minyan pottery has been found and published from four, namely Melos (Phylakopi), Paros (Paroikia), Siphnos (the Kastro), Syros (Ayios Loukas). Some also occurred in Kondoleon's excavations in Naxos (Grotta). To this list may be added three other sites where Grey Minyan sherds appeared on the surface, namely Keos (Ayia Irini), Mykonos (Palaiokastro), and Tenos (Akroterion Ourion). Some of the Minyan ware found on these sites appears to have been imported, but other examples are local imitations of the Main- land fabric. These latter can be detected from the gritty nature of their fabric and the com- paratively large amounts of mica which it contains, whilst there are also eccentricities of colour and profile. The excavators at Phylakopi were of the opinion that the bulk of the Grey Minyan which they found there had been imported.9 As the amount of the material is not great, it has been thought convenient to consider together both the imported pottery and the local products which imitate it. At the close of the section some fragments of coarse pottery which show affinity to the Minyan types have been included. Stemmed goblet. There are two variant types. Common to both is the tall hollow stem, which may be plain or corru- gated. In the first type two side-handles continue the profile of the body and are attached to the rim; in the second there are two large loop-handles rising above the rim. Both types are angular in profile. Both variants enjoyed a fairly wide distribution on the Greek mainland, both in Central Greece and the Peloponnese, so that it is not surprising to find that the bulk of the Cycladic material belongs to this type. Many of the finds consist of corrugated stems, so that it is not always possible to assign them to one of the two variants with certainty. There are unpublished fragments of such stems from Naxos (Grotta), and others come from the sites in Keos, Mykonos, and Tenos. Of the three examples from Tenos shown in FIG. I, nos. I-3, the eccentri- city of the profile of the first shows it to have been locally manufactured, whilst the other two conform to the stock Mainland type and were probably imported. Some frag- ments from Keos, however, were obviously locally manu- factured, for the corrugations are set widely apart, and the clay, which is very gritty, is a typically Cycladic one. Most of the fragments published from Paros and Siphnos seem to have been of the imported kind.'0 Some sherds found at Phylakopi were considered at the time to have been examples of Argive Minyan; on the other hand they may have been locally made, for one can detect on some of them a thin slip applied with a brush to improve the gritty and pocked surface." Fragments certainly belonging to the first variant were found in Melos (Phylakopi) and Siphnos, and in Paros the variant was imitated, although one example shows that the potter found it easier to add pierced lugs of a primitive type rather than the usual handles.'2 In two local fragments from Keos and Tenos (FIG.

BURNISHED FABRICS The technique of burnishing a pot, to which a slip of varying thickness had first been applied, was employed by Cycladic potters as well as Helladic.x'o The method is one which was commonly used in the Early Bronze Age, particularly for the incised wares. In the period under review, however, it was used either on vases which imitated Minyan types, or employed as a suitable background on which to paint patterns in white, thus copying the effects of the Minoan glaze- paint."x But the white paint used on the Cycladic vases is of poor quality, and cannot compare in brilliance with some Cretan examples.

This type consists of a flat, plate-like bowl fur- nished with a single or double lug on each side of the rim and set on a plain flaring stem like that of some of the goblets. One complete example and fragments of two others have been published; the rim is decorated with simple designs in white.4 Spouted bowl. A fine polychrome effect was achieved by the Melian potters when they used the red burnished technique on the interior and lower part of the exterior of this tradi- tional type; the rim was slipped buff for the application of geometrical patterns in matt black.5s Bowl with one loop-handle. In its perfected form with a raised base this type appears to have occurred only in the Cyclades. Baseless examples from Anatolia should probably be considered as its direct prototypes.6 An almost complete specimen from Keos is covered with a black burnished slip of approximately the same size as the bowl from Keos, but the Theran examples range from this comparatively small size to one 2o'9 cm. high.7 A handleless specimen from the same island is decorated with white spots around the rim.s Bridge-spouted jar. Examples from Melos and Thera covered with red burnish are furnished with a series of knobs equally spaced on the shoulder.9 An unpublished fragment, possibly without this plastic feature, comes from Keos.

At least three whole specimens of a single-handled concave-sided type were found at Phylakopi.z They are contemporary with the jug considered above, being decorated in two cases by a running spiral pattern, and in the third by a zigzag pattern in white. Pithos. Fragments of a pithos type were found at Phyla- kopi covered with a red burnish and decorated with a relief pattern or horizontal ridges or spirals and flattish knobs; fragments of the same type come from Keos.' Spouted jar. A large, flat-based jar with a spout and one handle was found in Thera.4 It is decorated with red lilies on a red burnished ground; a fragment of a similar jar with lily decoration was found at Phylakopi.s The design is frequently found on M.M. III ware at Knossos, and fres- coes incorporating the same floral motif were found in both Thera and Melos.6 Strainer. A published example from Thera is contempo- rary with the spouted jar from Thera just described; its decoration consists of white crocus plants on the lower part of the vessel, and white lilies on the upper, on which are pierced lugs in the place of handles. Rhyton. There are several published and unpublished examples of a conical type of rhyton which seems to have been in vogue in Thera at the very end of the Middle Cycla- dic period.8 They are decorated merely with red burnish, which on some of them has lost most of its lustre. One of them bears traces of the fire which destroyed the house in which it was found. D. THE CURVILINEAR STYLE In this section is included pottery with designs of a curvilinear character painted in matt black, which, along with the ware of the next section, Edgar termed 'Early Mycenaean Style'.g Although the potters at Phylakopi alone seem to have made pots in this style, and exported their products to the islands (for example to Rizokastelia in Naxos) and to the Mainland, yet reflections of the style are seen in some pots from Amorgos and Thera.'o The basic element in the decoration of these pots is the spiral or circle, out of a combination of which various curvi- linear patterns are formed. These seem often to have been directly inspired by patterns on M.M. II ware, such as the Kamares Ware found on the same site, where motifs such as the conventionalized rosette, hatched spiral, and segmented circle predominate. It is true to say that in many instances the Minoan compositions have been 'dissolved', as Furumark has com- mented, but it is hardly fair to add that the regrouping of the motifs by the Melian artist is 'aimless'." The decoration of some bowl interiors is particularly well suited to the circular field. Although the polychromy of the prototypes is not attempted, some variation of tone is achieved by the hatching of some portions of the designs. It is interesting to trace the models for the designs on sherds of Minoan ware found on the site.I2 It should be stressed, however, that the vases of the present class do not slavishly copy such models, but are thoroughly Cycladic in character. In some vases the fabric is similar to that of the matt dark-on-light ware of the Rectilinear Style, and often a thin, light-coloured slip is applied to the reddish clay before the black paint is applied, but more often both slip and clay are of the same greenish-buff colour. Beaked jug. This type is directly descended from the type of the Rectilinear Style. It now has a raised base and the neck is longer with a slender beak, or less commonly the neck is short and the beak takes the form of an elongated flange.'3 The general proportions of the type therefore are rather more refined than before. A somewhat conservative example from Amorgos, which was made in two sections as a jug of the earlier style, is not, as might appear at first glance, to be assigned to that class, but to be considered as a 'country cousin' of the Curvilinear Style type, as manu- factured at Phylakopi, for the decoration attempts to copy the decoration of this class.4 Similarly, a double vase from the same island showst he same kind of motif.s'5 Many of the jugs from Phylakopi are decorated with plastic 'breasts' Cf.

Similar details occur on a series of jugs from Thera, which are clearly derived from the Phylakopi type, although their designs are not so complex, consisting usually of a necklace of spots and bands round the lower part of the body, though one has a series of'eyes' round the middle.' A fragment from a similarly decorated pot comes from Tenos. On the jugs from Phylakopi the decoration is oftwo kinds: either the body is divided up into horizontal zones of orna- ment, or, more often, there is one large decorative motif below the spout together with accessory ornament.2 Men- tion should be made here of the so-called 'winged imps' which occur on several vases.3 They were compared by Evans to similar fantastic, though more complete, figures on a Mochlos signet and on some of the Zakro sealings.4 But if the Cretan examples are rightly assigned to the M.M. III period they would seem to postdate the Cycladic figures and therefore could hardly be considered as their prototypes. Another explanation would be that we have in these weird figures but another example of the pictorialization which is already apparent in the decoration of late examples of the Rectilinear Style; the same trend is apparent in the anthropomorphic attributes of the jugs. Bowl. This type is a new one in Melian pottery. It is shallow, with no base, and has two loop-handles rising from the rim. Possibly it imitates a Minoan type of metal bowl, most of the examples of which date from the M.M. III period, although there were some earlier specimens.s The interior alone is decorated, being divided up into zones of ornament or decorated with one complex pattern.6 In two examples, however, neither of these schemes is adhered to, for spiral and circular motifs are scattered somewhat hap- hazardly over the circular field.7 Cup. The shallow M.M. II type is now adopted, being decorated on the exterior with zones of ornament, in which case the interior receives a coat of matt red paint (in imita- tion of the lustrous wash on the interior of Minoan cups), or on the interior with one curvilinear design.8 Spouted jar. The type now in vogue is of the 'tea-pot' variety, not unknown in Crete although its origin is Anatolian.9 One fragmentary specimen from Phylakopi in- corporates, somewhat unhappily, zones of spiral and geo- metric ornament, and also what appears to be a figure scene, rather after the manner of a needlework sampler.'o At least three specimens were found in Thera of the same type." These are practically identical with one another, for on either side of the vases is a segmented circle pattern which was much in vogue at Phylakopi, and on either side of the spout are 'eyes' which are also found painted on some of the beaked jugs. Bridge-spouted jar. Several fragments were recovered from Phylakopi which represent the first appearance of this typically Minoan form into Melian ceramics. Two frag- ments show a zonal form of decoration, but a more unusual piece has a frieze of animals which are obviously pic- torialized from a Minoan 'connected-ivy' pattern such as was found on a teacup from the site.'2 Another has a design of conventionalized rosettes of M.M. I-II form.'3 Small jar. One complete example comes from Phylakopi. It has two zones of ornament on the exterior, one a guil- loche, the other a running-dog design."' Amphora. An example of the Minoan type with elliptical mouth and side-handles from shoulder to rim was found in Thera decorated with a similar segmented circle pattern as on the spouted jars from the same site.'5 Pithos. One fragment decorated with a shell-like pattern derived from a hatched spiral belongs to a similar type of pithos to that in vogue during the Rectilinear Style.'" E. THE NATURALISTIC STYLE In this section is described the matt-painted ware of the latest deposits of the Second City of Phylakopi, which Edgar also termed 'Early Mycenaean'.'7 It is a peculiarly Melian style, and its patterns are influenced to a large extent by the evolution towards naturalism which was taking place in the decoration of M.M. III pottery; it also seems to have derived inspiration from such naturalistic frescoes of Minoan type as were found on the site.'8 Some of the decora- tive elements, therefore, are taken from animal life, and these appear in naturalistic settings as they do on the frescoes. Curvilinear patterns are still used, but they take on a new guise, ap- pearing as plant tendrils. On some pots we can almost see the transition taking place; one cup, e.g. e.g. Chron fig. 230; BCH xlvi. 330, fig. 20. 2 e.g. Phyl pl. xiv. 4, 6; BSA xvii, pl. xiii. 373.

SCHOLES for example, has an isolated spiral as its chief ornament, whilst round the rim is the naturalistic 'bracket-pattern' which occurs on almost every example of pots painted in the Naturalistic Style.' Although this class seems to have been limited in its manufacture to Phylakopi, it had a certain popularity elsewhere, being exported to Paros, Siphnos, and Thera, and also to Athens.2 The fabric of the pots is very similar to that of those of the preceding section. There are comparatively few impurities in the clay, but mica is always observable. Panelled cup. These cups were termed'panelled' by Edgar; only the side which would be turned away from the drinker is decorated. They have one handle, a convex bowl, and a very short stem; the interior is given a red wash. Seven practically complete specimens illustrate the variety of the designs and the skill with which the Melian painter could portray wild life, The first shows a waterfowl in flight, the second a partridge(?) against a background of reeds and grasses.'3 In the second cup we see a pleasantly drawn pal- mette used as filling-ornament; this is a motif which came to be over-worked, and it was adopted by Mainland painters.4 Two other cups have patterns which are bor- rowed directly from M.M. III designs: the first imitates some mottled-stone design (and uses white paint, like its model), and the second is decorated with the conventional rock-pattern of the frescoes.5 Another cup is patterned only with finely drawn palmettes, two others with naturalistic fronds, and a fourth has a more abstract design.6 Other decorative motifs occur on sherds: stylized bucrania, con- nected loops, and a variety of plant-tendrils.' It should be noted that not only the decoration of such cups but also the type itself influenced Mainland potters.s Shallow panelled cup. This type does not seem to have been so common as the other. The decorative field is naturally restricted by the cup's dimensions, although some of the same designs, such as birds (and fish), palmettes, and tendrils, appear on it.p Bowl. Several large fragments probably come from bowls of the type which was painted in the Curvilinear Style. The designs again embody animals and plants.'0 Spouted bowl. This traditional type is now decorated with simple naturalistic patterns round the rim. An example from Phylakopi is ornamented with the 'bracket-pattern' and one from Thera (which seems to be an import from Phylakopi) with a connected-loop design."x Bowl with one loop-handle. Two complete examples of the type which occurs in the burnished technique are decorated in this style, in one case with a simple naturalistic spiral pattern round the rim.x'2 There is also a plain specimen from Thera."3 Beaked jug. The beaked jug now has a higher base than before; the spout, too, is pulled back, so that the full- throated 'bulge', which is a particular characteristic of the jugs of the next section, is produced. Three complete speci- mens come from Phylakopi, among which is the tall 'Griffin' vase. Evans believed that the birds of the 'Black and Red' class evolved from the creature on this vase, but a simpler explanation would be that those birds are related to the birds of the present class, with which they are con- temporary.'4 Another jug is smaller, and retains the plastic features of jugs painted in the Curvilinear Style, but its naturalistic spirals assign it to the present class.'5 The third specimen has the same plastic ornament, and painted 'eyes' on the beak, but a floral pattern on the body; an example from Thera has similar painted 'eyes' and vegetable decora- tion, while another jug from Amorgos which has lost most of its painted decoration has not only plastic 'breasts' but also 'ears'.'6 Bath or basin. A fragment of a large basin or bath was found at Phylakopi, belonging to an elliptical type with ledge-handles. The pleasant design on the interior consists of several fish, perhaps intended for dolphins, swimming round to the right. A wavy line runs round below the rim.' The derivation from some fresco seems obvious. F. POLYCHROME WARE: 'BLACK AND RED' The pottery of this class from Phylakopi is largely contemporary with the ware of the pre- ceding section. The term is one applied by the excavators to a group of 'Early Mycenaean' vases, characterized by painted designs in matt black on the light ground of the vase, the high- lights in the designs being red or brown burnished circles, which in many cases form the bodies of flying birds.'s The juxtaposition of matt black designs and red burnish has already been noted SPhyl SPhyl pl. xvi. 13. 2 e.g. BSA xliv, pl. xii. 3, 4; Hesperia vi. 554, fig. ioc. 3 Phyl pl. xvi.

The decorative elements are very largely those of the Naturalistic class; even such minor details of decoration as the 'bracket-pattern' occur on vases of both classes.' In one instance the painter has drawn on the decoration of the Curvilinear Class for his inspiration; I refer to a circular ornament (now red-burnished) surrounded by a spiral border.2 The style is restricted to Melos but some pots were exported to Thera, Crete (Knossos), and Mycenae, and local pottery both in Thera and Mycenae was influenced.3 Jug. Of two types, the beaked variety is identical with that of the preceding section. The Temple Repositories of Knossos have furnished several characteristic Melian speci- mens; the design, confined to the upper part of the jug, consists of flying birds, disks, and spirals, the bodies of the birds and the disks being formed of red-burnished circles.4 Evans considered the syntax of this type of design to have been directly inspired by a circle and tangent scheme of decoration of M.M. I date, many examples of which have been furnished by the cemetery of Pachyammos.' There seems to be a chronological argument against this theory, but one cannot wholly disregard the possibility that the Cretan style may have persisted long enough in Crete for such influence to have been possible, and it must be remembered that on East Cretan sites M.M. III ware follows directly after that of M.M. I. A fragment of an identical beaked jug was found in Thera, obviously an import from Melos, and fragments of locally made pottery there show that the potters copied the pronounced 'bulge' of the throat of Melian jugs.6 The second type of jug has a round neck and one handle from shoulder to rim. Two complete specimens were found at Phylakopi; one of them is painted with a round-bodied bird, the other has a very graceful tulip design and a loose spiral ornainent round the neck; the latter detail is common on the jugs of the beaked type.' A fragmentary, unpub- lished example in the National Museum at Athens has a trefoil neck and is decorated with similar birds.8 Perhaps also belonging to some jug type are several fragments, one showing a vertical foliate band as part of the decoration, the other the remains of a figure scene.' Bridge-spouted vase. There are at least two almost complete examples of bridge-spouted vessels. One of them has a basket-handle and is decorated with a round-bodied bird facing a vertical foliate design; the second is unpublished in the museum of the British School at Athens: it shows a similar bird together with a similar circular ornament as occurs on the beaked jugs.'0 Spoutedjar. This type is said in the excavation report to have been decorated in the 'Black and Red' style, but we are not told whether any of the sherds illustrated there come from such a jar." Amphora. One complete example of the type with ellipti- cal mouth and two side-handles was found at Phylakopi. Its loose, naturalistic spirals assign it to the present class, although there is the unusual use of red paint, perhaps in imitation of the polychrome M.M. III amphorae which are decorated with similar fantastic plant designs.'2 Pithos. One fragment from a pithos shows a dolphin diving over a disk ornament, whilst on the left is a con- ventionalized tulip-flower such as is seen on one of the round-necked jugs; an intermediate stage in the conven- tionalization of this ornament is seen on a sherd where the flower is not wholly detached from the stem of the plant.' Bath. Two fragments from different vessels show water- fowl depicted against a natural background; no doubt Evans was right when he suggested that these derived their subjects from contemporary frescoes.'4 A fragmentary pot from Thera (tentatively restored as a jug) shows a poly- chrome type of decoration with a similar subject.'s G. OTHER MIDDLE CYCLADIC FABRICS The pottery included in this section does not form a homogeneous class; in it have been gathered together examples of styles which fall outside the distinctive Cycladic classes discussed above. i. Pottery with Helladic connexions. Many fragments of pithoi of Helladic type, with a relief decoration consisting of overlapping disks of clay, were found in Delos, Keos, Kythnos, Melos, Mykonos, Naxos, and Tenos.'6 Such pithoi were popular over a long period of time, and therefore cannot be assigned to a particular phase of the Middle SCf.

SCHOLES Cycladic Period; it is noteworthy, however, that they occurred on the Cycladic sites chiefly in conjunction with Minyan ware. Fragments of bowls or cups with a polychrome scheme of decoration which seems to have been inspired by Mainland types such as occur at Mycenae, Korakou, Prosymna, Zygouries, and elsewhere have been found in Paros and Siphnos.' From Keos comes evidence of a similar style: part of a jug with matt-painted decoration in brown and black on buff clay, and fragments of a pithos with red stripes edged with black on a buff ground. The fragments from Paros are said to have been representative of the latest matt-painted ware from the site; together with evidence incised decoration corresponding to a M.M. III type are represented by fragments from Keos and Melos.s Large jugs with a cut-away neck and knobs on either side of the spout such as were current in Crete towards the close of the M.M.

They are locally made, but retain traces of a coating of black paint such as was used on cups in Crete. The third is fluted horizontally on both interior and exterior, and on all the string-marks on the base are very prominent.2 From the same site and from Tenos come fragments of bridge-spouted jars. Imported fragments from jars of the same type were found in Keos and Melos; these bear traces of white designs on a dark ground.3 A few pots from Thera and Melos are decorated with the M.M.

Traditional Cycladic types. In both the islands ofAmorgos and Thera were found bottle-like vessels decorated with vertical plastic stripes, usually four in number; the type does not seem to have occurred elsewhere.9 The pierced lugs in lieu of handles suggest an evolution from some Early Bronze Age type; these examples, however, were un- doubtedly made at a much later date. A clay goblet on a short stem from Thera may also have evolved from a much earlier type. The only contemporary parallels for this are in other materials.x0 4. Cypriot imports. Two fragments of Cypriot 'milk- bowls' of the White Slip I class were found in Melos and Thera, and probably date to the very end of the M.C. III period.' H.

III and M.M. I ware; on the Main- land this technique is but dimly reflected in some E.H. III ware. On the other hand, much of the matt dark-on-light class seems parallel in types and decoration to the matt-painted ware of the Middle Helladic period. At Phylakopi this kind of pottery is found in deposits with M.M. I ware and some Grey Minyan pottery.2 The evidence from the Mainland, and particularly from the recently excavated site of Lerna, where seven strata were able to be distinguished in places for the Middle Helladic period, seems to indicate that matt-painted ware was most commonly found in later phases of the period. With regard to Lerna itself, it has been stated that such ware 'is common in the later phases, but is rare, if not wholly absent, in the earliest'. Assuming that the first occurrence of Minyan ware at Phylakopi does not greatly post-date that on the Mainland, we must conclude that in part, at least, the matt-painted ware of Phylakopi ante-dates that on the Mainland, in which case the latter, which shows a parallel form of decoration, must be dependent upon it. It is noteworthy that Blegen inclines to this view.* As regards the process of transmission, the island of Aegina seems to have been one of the intermediaries. It is on vases from this island that we see that many of the Cycladic charac- teristics, almost wholly lost on Mainland examples, have been preserved. On two vases from Aegina, for example, the Cycladic cross-hatched patterns occur, and also a reminiscence of the 'circle and tangent' scheme of decoration; an example from Eutresis is of the same kind.s But on other vases from Aegina and the Mainland the coherence of the Cycladic compositions is lost; this is clearly shown on some Mainland pithoi where the decorative field is divided up vertically, incorporating circles in a very loose design.6 While many of the prototypes for the Cycladic light-on-dark class are E.M. III, but the dark-on-light class must at least be partly contemporary with the Helladic ware it inspired, we should perhaps compromise and term the whole of the Rectilinear Class 'late Early Cycladic to Middle Cycladic I'.7 This is a con- venient term, for, as was noted above, there is no distinct break in the ceramic development between the First and Second Cities of Phylakopi, but rather the period is to be thought of as one of transition. The Minyan pottery (Section B) seems to have occurred in its largest quantities in early deposits of the Second City (i.e. in M.C. I), although it continued in use throughout that City to a lesser degree and survived until the inauguration of Late Cycladic I, just as it continued to be made on the Mainland until Mycenaean times.8 That such ware was well known and accepted in the south Aegean area before the close of the M.C. I period is confirmed by the fact that in Crete two vases were made towards the close of the M.M. I period which copied Minyan types.9 The Burnished pottery (Section C) continued to be made throughout the Second City of Phylakopi. The types paralleled in the Minyan class are probably contemporary with them, but to later phases we must assign those pots whose white-painted designs are dependent on M.M. III models. The bowl with loop-handle (p. I7), a uniquely Cycladic type, was probably introduced in the middle phase of the Second City, for in its perfected state, where the handle Cf. Cf.

SCHOLES is attached smoothly on to the body, it is decorated in the Naturalistic manner (see p. 20), whereas a more rudimentary form (represented in Keos) should probably be assigned to an earlier, i.e. M.C. II, phase. Hard on the heels of the matt-painted ware with Rectilinear patterns appears that painted in the Curvilinear Style (Section D). At Phylakopi it occurs in deposits with true Kamares ware (on which it is partially dependent) and may therefore be termed 'Middle Cycladic II'.' To the later phases of the Second City, that of the pillar-rooms and their attendant frescoes, should be assigned the Naturalistic and 'Black and Red' styles (Sections E and F), which we may term 'Middle Cycladic III'; some of the pottery copying Minoan types in Section G may also be considered as belonging to the same period.2 As between the First and Second Cities, so between the Second and Third we observe a period of transition. Already in the very latest deposits of the Second City are some fragments of 'imported Mycenaean' ware (i.e. imported Minoan and Mycenaean), which belong to the beginning of the Late Bronze Age, while some of the M.C. III 'Black and Red' ware is found sporadically in the earliest deposits of the Third City. A correlation of the final stage of the Middle Bronze Age in Crete, Phylakopi, and Mycenae is shown by the occurrence of such 'Black and Red' ware in the Temple Reposi- tories at Knossos and the Shaft-Graves (in the Second Circle) at Mycenae. THE CYCLADIC POTTERY OF THE LATE BRONZE AGE In contrast to the method employed for the pottery of the Middle Bronze Age, where the analysis depended on the sequence of styles at Phylakopi, the material here is classified site by site, for not only is the bulk of it from sites other than Phylakopi greater than in the preceding period, but also that city gradually recedes from the position where she was foremost in creating a distinctive Cycladic Style. A. LOCAL CYCLADIC I-II POTTERY x. Phylakopi. Little could be added to the rather too de- tailed analysis of this pottery made by Furumark." The locally made pottery most typical of the earliest deposits in the Third City is the 'Red and Black' and monochrome ware, of which some early examples were found in the very latest deposits of the Second City. The first class is so called from the predominant use of a red or reddish-brown semi- lustrous paint, details being picked out in matt black.4 As the red paint has very little lustre of its own, many of the pots were burnished over the whole surface after its applica- tion.s This was done no doubt to imitate the brilliant effect of the Minoan glaze-paint and slip, for both these classes are dependent on L.M. I-II models. The monochrome ware can be divided into two classes, one in which the designs are carried out rather coarsely, with little detail, and the other in which the painting is of a much finer character, and the designs very similar on the whole to those of the 'Red and Black' class. On some cups there is a lavish use of white paint. Jug. One type of jug is of the traditional beaked variety, but it is only represented in a transitional style which shows the struggle for predominance between the red and black paint.6 A new type ofjug, a sturdy little pot with a cut-away neck, now appears; it has parallels in M.M. IIIB ware and is related to a Mycenaean Ijug (F. type 135) which seems to have outlived it.' The crocus-flower, grass-frond, and wavy hatched band used on these jugs are directly copied from Minoan pottery.' The polychrome technique is usually employed on these jugs, although an unpublished example in the Plaka museum, Melos, has a spiral design in the second monochrome manner. The most common type, however, is a broad bridge-spouted jug (a Minoan type copied by Mycenaean II potters) usually decorated with the L.M. IA connected spiral band, often with floral enrichments and additions in white after the Minoan manner.' The coarse wavy line towards the base is derived from the Minoan arcade pattern as is seen clearly on a bridge-spouted jar.'0 Another bridge-spouted type, with ' Phy1260. 2 Op. cit. 262. a OpArch vi. 192 ff.

IIIB ceramics; two examples of jugs are modelled on a rare Minoan type with a double rim, such as was found at Gournia.x' Bridge-spoutedjar. Many examples of this type were found, the majority of them belonging to a somewhat ponderous variety, similar in profile to the first type of bridge-spouted jug, and decorated with spiral bands?.2 Fragments of others show floral patterns, and one example is not only decorated with the Minoan grass-frond, but also preserves the con- vention of the prototype by which the grasses are inclined slightly to the right as if blown by a breeze.3 A second variety is piriform, and similarly decorated with spiral, ripple, or ivy patterns, designs again taken directly from L.M.

An unpublished jar in the Plaka Museum is of the L.M. I-II type with several sets of vertical handles, and is decorated with grass-fronds. The type with elliptical mouth also occurs.6 Pedestal vase. The precise purpose of this type is con- jectural; the centre of the vase is either hollow, or has a perforated boss. The majority of the examples were found in the latest deposits of the Second City, but one was furnished by a chamber-tomb at Mycenae (the companion piece of the amphora mentioned above). These again are a direct copy of a Minoan type, but are often more decora- tive than their models.7 There are several examples in the monochrome technique, but the most effective of all is painted in the polychrome manner, its design representing a daisy-like flower.8 Bath or basin. The type is the roughly elliptical one of the preceding period. These were decorated in polychrome technique with spiral patterns and daisies, in the first mono- chrome technique with spirals with grass-frond or ivy- tendril additions, and in the second monochrome technique with floral designs or octopus motifs such as occurred on imported L.M. IB ware.9. Strainer. This again is a L.M. IA type; in Melos it was decorated in the polychrome manner.'0 Ladle. A fragmentary example in polychrome technique is decorated with a daisy-flower such as appears on the basins and pedestal-vases." Cup. Of several types at this period, a complete example in polychrome technique shows the final decadence of the type which was so popular in the M.C. III period.'" A new type is the so-called 'Vaphio' one, but without the raised belt of the metal prototype; the latter feature, however, is often indicated by a stripe of paint round the middle of the cup; the decoration consists of foliate bands, ripple orna- ment, or hatched bands.'3 One of these cups has its base decorated with a spiral like a L.H. I cup at Mycenae." A third type of Minoan origin, represented in Melos by one complete example, is a small rimmed cup decorated with ripple pattern.'s The type of cup which occurred most commonly was of hemispherical shape, and it has three variants. The first variant has no distinct rim, and is decorated in the poly- chrome or first monochrome technique with spiral, foliate, or zoned decoration.'6 Lines, crosses, and spirals decorate the bases of many of these cups; the convention, used by painters of L.H. II alabastra, is a Minoan one and seems to have been used first in the M.M. III period on light-on- dark ware.7 The second variant with a slightly defined rim is decorated in either the polychrome or second mono- chrome technique; the designs on these often suffer from the overcrowding of detail.'xs The third variant with a distinct rim closely copies a L.M. IA type.'9 It is most often deco- rated in the first monochrome technique with a running- spiral pattern, but there are examples in the polychrome style and sometimes the spirals are filled in with white, possibly in imitation of some spiral-patterned L.M. II amphorae.20 Spouted bowl. This traditional type has now atrophied into a rather shapeless vessel in which the spout is merely pinched out of the wall and a stud takes the place of the handle. There are several examples in the polychrome technique; the interior has a red wash, as have some of the cups.2' Ring-handled bowl. One unique specimen was found which imitates the shape of the Minoan metal bowl, and is deco. rated with spirals and bands in the first monochrome tech- nique, the details of the metal prototype being rendered by clay studs on the handle and notching of the rim.22 Rhyton. Several specimens were found of the conical L.M.

Several fragments of pithoi with relief decoration were found. Their incised and spiral patterns conform to the L.M. I-II type, although they are usually less complex than their prototypes.2 Tub. Part of a large, flat-bottomed vessel with some perforations in the sides was found, its purpose unknown. It is decorated pleasantly in the polychrome technique with crocus-flowers and spirals like some of the jugs, and belongs to the beginning of the period.3 2. Thera. Although the pottery of this period, as of the preceding one, comes from several sites in Thera and one in Therasia, it has not seemed convenient to divide up the material according to its exact provenance. It would in fact be impossible to do so, as there are many pots and fragments in the Thera museum which are not marked with any indication of their find-spot. Most of the material seems to have come from the sites of Kamara, Akrotiri, and Therasia, and forms a fairly homogeneous collection. In this connexion mention must be made of Bent's description of some of the pottery which he saw from Thera- sia, for he seems to have been slightly misled.' He says 'the remains of Akroteri are not so old, iron instruments were found therein, and pottery of a much more advanced age resembling that found by Dr. Schliemann at Hissarlik than those things which came from Antiparos or Therasia. Furthermore, the remains of the village of Akroteri are not so deeply buried as those at Therasia, being little more than twenty feet below the surface.' But the 'Early Cycladic' pottery and iron tools are not to be found now; a very few pots with suspension lugs belong to a much later period. Fouqu6 expressly states that the pottery from both sites was of the same kind, and the depth at which the settlements were found is no indication of their respective ages. We have, moreover, sufficient evidence to show that both sites were flourishing during the late Middle Cycladic and early Late Cycladic periods. As regards the technique of the locally made pottery, the chief medium employed was a brownish-red or black paint, little if at all lustrous. On some vases white paint has been added after the L.M. IA manner. On the whole the pottery seems to have been inspired by contemporary Minoan types, but some of it has a distinctly Melian flavour about it, which suggests that there was a certain amount of influence exerted from the larger island. Bridge-spouted jug. Two fragments of this type, decorated with foliate and spiral patterns in brown paint, are clearly influenced by contemporary Melian ware, but the execu- tion of the designs is very careless.s One complete specimen furnished with a spout rather more uplifted than that of the rest is of particular interest as its main design, consisting of a double-stemmed, connected ivy pattern, is paralleled only on a L.H. II goblet from Lachish.6 Bridge-spoutedjar. Many examples of this type have been found, but not all of them published.7 The majority of them have a well-defined foot, and some a good piriform shape; there are usually two horizontal side-handles. One example is larger than most, and is decorated with three zones of ripple ornament.s Three unpublished examples in the Thera museum are decorated with two zones of the same ornament, their heights ranging from I2"5 to I3.5 cm. One is a particularly fine vase, with white additions on the olive-black paint; the other two are decorated with a redder paint in a much less careful way.9 Another vase with a fine shape has an unusual decoration in the upper zone which recalls the pattern on a cup from Mirabello.'o A slimmer specimen is given a polychrome effect by black bands round the middle of the body and base, together with red and white additions." Pithoidjar. One example with three horizontal handles set near the rim is decorated rather carelessly with a linked spiral pattern and loop filling-ornament such as is character- istic of contemporary Melian ware.'" Amphora. Many fragments and complete examples of the type with elliptical mouth were found.'3 These are usually plain except for brown bands round the base of the neck and handles, and are often of large size. There are only a few exceptions to this scheme of decoration; one, for example, has a linked spiral band round the shoulder, another traces of a palm-like ornament on either side. An unpublished example was once decorated with ripple pattern on the shoulder; another has a coarse grass pattern as on a Melian example." Bath. One complete example was found, of the same elliptical shape as the examples from Phylakopi. On the interior is a coarse grass pattern."s Strainer. An almost complete example of the L.M. I type has two vertical and two horizontal handles on the shoulder; the decoration consists of coarse foliate and crocus patterns in brown with details added in white. Another, frag- mentary vessel belongs to another type which incorporates two vases in one.'6 The decoration, which is much too care- less to merit such description, consists of a series of goats(?) in black paint with accessory ornament of red-brown crocuses. Possibly the combination of the two colours of paint indicates an attempt to copy the polychromy of some Melian ware. Cup.

Two types of pithos were current in Thera; the first, of which there are examples in the Thera museum, is tub-like and supplied with two ledge-handles and the decoration consists of the usual connected spiral band; in one instance the dots in the interspaces seem to be a de- generation of the former floral filling.s There are two decorated examples of another type which narrows to the base and has an outlet near the base, as on an example from Gournia.6 The painted decoration, as distinct from the horizontal raised bands round the body, consists of what appears to be a variant of the connected spiral pattern, here applied vertically. Such a vase could not have stood un- supported, and may well have been held in position by such buttresses as those in the 'Oil Merchant's House' at Mycenae.7 3. Keos. Two pieces of local pottery dating to the period under discussion may be mentioned. Cup. A fragment of a 'Vaphio' cup is painted with a ripple pattern in brown. An unusual feature is a series of white spots on the rim. A second sherd, belonging to a larger cup, is also decorated with ripple pattern and zones of spots; this may have belonged to a goblet of a type found at Mirabello.s B. IMPORTED LATE MINOAN I-II WARE Small quantities of this ware have been found in Keos, Naxos, Delos, and Thera, but far greater quantities at Phylakopi in Melos. These proportions are not wholly unexpected in view of the fact that Melos was in closest contact of all with Crete during the latest phases of the preceding period. I. Keos. Only three sherds were found on the site of Ayia Irini of this pottery, and all date to L.M. I. They are important, however, as they indicate that the influence exerted by Crete in the M.C. III period continues into the present one. Cup. One fragment of a cup of 'Vaphio' type (a form copied locally) has a good ripple pattern on the exterior. Spouted bowl (?). A sherd painted with grass-pattern in good olive-black paint and coated on the interior with a streaky black wash (FIG. 4, no. 7) is similar to many found at Phylakopi.9 Rhyton. The third sherd is of very fine fabric, decorated on the exterior with a spotted pattern (FIG. 4, no. 6).

In the museum of Naxia there appeared to be only one sherd from Kondoleon's excavations from Grotta which could be considered without doubt to be Minoan, but there may have been others, for not all the material was accessible.

An unusual feature is impressed cockle-shell decoration on the lower part of the handles. Similar relief patterns are found on a M.M.

Melos. A great quantity of Minoan ware was found at Phylakopi but most of it is unpublished. In the first excavation report it was termed 'imported Mycenaean' ware together with true Mycenaean pottery, as no dis- tinction between the two was possible at the time.3 In the second report much of it was recognized as being Minoan, but with it was included some Mycenaean.4 It is unfortun- ate that most of the material is very fragmentary, with the result that, while the designs can generally be reconstructed, the types to which they belong are not always so easily recognizable. Such a difficulty does not so often arise when Mycenaean pottery is being considered, owing to the rather stereotyped nature of that ware. In some cases, too, it has been difficult to decide whether a sherd is Minoan or Mycenaean. Although the fabrics are often easily dis- where, judgement should be passed on a sherd with a good deal of circumspection. Amphora. No complete specimen remains, but two sherds, one with a connected-lobe design and the other with a mock stone pattern, are both paralleled closely by L.M. IA jars from Mochlos.6 A large fragment belongs to an amphora of similar date with a collar; another, probably of slightly later date, has a reserved wavy line round the neck.' Some sherds belong to ripple-painted jars, whilst others are painted in marine style.8 A more unusual piece has zones of sacral knots, another zigzag ornament and marine designs, and a third shield motifs.9 Bridge-spouted jar.

Another has a vertical hatched-lobe pattern such as Mainland painters copied, and an attractive piece has the star-and-bubble pattern of the Palaikastro rhyta.2 Jug. Some fragments of L.M. IB or II style probably belonged to jugs or ewers, as they are thin in section and not painted on the interior. A published fragment of a very fine vase is painted in the marine style; the foliate pattern on the handle (paralleled in contemporary metalwork) is also used on another handle which may have belonged to a jug.3 An almost complete jug with floral pendant pattern (F. pattern 38: i) is probably Minoan; the painting on one side is very inexact, and this is a characteristic which goes hand in hand with the Minoan individuality and spon- taneity of design.4 Other fragments with the same design probably also belong to jugs; on the Mainland this pattern was used to decorate large rather than small pots such as these.s Some sherds of L.M. IB style have octopus motifs (FIO. 4, no. I2) such as were copied locally.6 Finally, I should assign another complete vase to Minoan manufac- ture; this is a large, bridge-spouted vase, of which both the shape and the pattern on the neck are paralleled by a jug from Sklavokampos in Crete.7 The design on the body, consisting of argonauts and bubbles, is thoroughly Minoan in conception, while the arched pattern round the base is one which often decorates Minoan vases.s Cup. Several unpublished fragments belong to cups of 'Vaphio' type, with ripple designs; the paint varies from a rich brown to red, and shades off delicately into the colour of the slip.9 Sherds from cups of hemispherical shape, decorated with lines of dots, ivy patterns, or 'running- dog' ornament, illustrate the class which the local potters copied.'o Bowl. Three fragments, probably belonging to spouted bowls, have a slightly pronounced foot and are slipped on the interior; they are decorated respectively with a scale pattern, conventionalized ivy leaves, and argonauts." Rhyton. An unpublished fragment belonging to a rhyton of conical shape is decorated in the marine style.'2 Alabastron. Probably belonging to alabastra are several published fragments. One, assigned to this type by Evans, is decorated with a figure-of-eight shield and conventional- ized ivy leaves, with sacral knots.'3 Another has an ivy pattern, a second clumps of stylized papyrus flowers, and a third small tailed spirals painted in the L.M. II style."4 An almost complete example with ivy, rosettes, and rock- work is almost certainly Minoan.zs C. IMPORTED LATE MINOAN III WARE As far as our evidence goes at the moment, the imported ware of this style has been furnished only by Amorgos, Kimolos, and Melos. x. Amorgos. A kylix with a banded stem attributed to Amorgos has a bucranium between stags' heads on one side of the bowl and a spiral ornament on the other. Pos- sibly this kylix and two fragmentary specimens from Melos belonged to the same figure style as a published example attributed to Crete.'6 2. Kimolos. A sherd from the site of Ellinika comes from a large vessel, possibly a krater. The decoration which remains consists of most of the head and part of the body and wing of a bird. Though there seems to be no exact parallel for this type of bird, the outlining of the body is a Minoan trait.'7 3. Melos. Most of the pottery of this class consists of kylix fragments. Kylix. Three unpublished fragments are decorated with variants of the Mycenaean III flower (F. pattern 18), a form of the motif which often appears on kylikes from Crete.'8 A fourth sherdwith sets of horizontal lines arranged in triangular formation is painted solidly on the interior after the Minoan manner.'9 The fabric of all four sherds is good. Two other sherds with large handles are decorated with what appears to be goats' heads.20 Bowl. A sherd painted with a triangular hatched figure, fringed on one side, is closely paralleled by the decoration of a bowl from Vrokastro which dates to the end of the period.2' Jar. Possibly belonging to a stirrup-jar is a sherd painted in Minoan rather than Mycenaean manner with an octopus or octopus-tentacle motif.22 Rhyton. A sherd belonging to a conical rhyton is painted with a dotted scale pattern and hatched zones. These decora- tive elements appear together on a pyxis from Palaikastro.23 SMCAC, SMCAC, PP. 206; cf. the local sherd PP. 145. 2 MCAC, PP. 221; sherd in AMO. 3 Phyl pl. xxxi.

IMPORTED MYCENAEAN I-II WARE The bulk of this class of pottery found in the Cyclades comes from Melos and Naxos, but a certain amount also from Keos and Delos, and one sherd from Kythnos. To judge from parallels on the Mainland, one would say that it was manufactured in various centres in the south of Greece. i. Kythnos. The base of a 'Vaphio' cup was found on the site of Ayia Irini. 2. Delos. All the pottery of this class has been found by excavators in the area of the Temenos. 2- CM FIG. 5. MYCENAEAN JUG FROM KEOS Cup. Sherds of 'Vaphio' cups with connected spiral pattern (F. pattern 46: 29) and a teacup with a similar pattern (F. pattern 46: I2) were found near the Arte- mision.' Kylix. One fragment in the Delos museum illustrates the early variety decorated with a solid wavy band from the rim. Bowl. Also in the museum is a sherd of a shallow bowl decorated with a stipple pattern in black paint. Ewer. A fragment of a ewer in the same museum is of Mycenaean II style; the paint is a dark red. 3. Keos. Most of the following sherds were found either on the surface of the Ayia Irini site, or in the eroded sides not more than 0o5 m. down. The material is very frag- mentary, but the decoration generally distinct. Cup. In the museum housed in the Demarcheion of Kea are two sherds from 'Vaphio' cups, one with the common Mycenaean I pattern of connected spiral and spots (F. pattern 46:29) and the other with a less frequently found design.2 Two fragments of 'teacups' came to light on the site, both of them decorated with spiral patterns (F. pattern 46:9/12); one is shown on FIG. 4, no. 5. Jug. An early Mycenaean type of squat jug is decorated with a streamer design (FIG. 5). The shape is not a common one at this period, but is represented at Prosymna, Mycenae, and Korakou.3 Probably belonging to ewers of Mycenaean IIA style are several fragments with decoration in zones (FIG. 4, nos. 2, 3, 4, I1). The first, with rather an unusual pattern, is paralleled by a sherd from Athens.* Jar. Sherds ofjars, probably made in the Mycenaean IIA phase, are decorated with a variety of patterns (FIG. 4, nos. 1, 9, Jo, I3), a common one being that of the ogival canopy (F. pattern 13: 2). 4. .Naxos. Several sherds unearthed by Welter and Kon- doleon at Palati-Grotta belong to the period. Cup. A few sherds of a large teacup type decorated with stipple pattern belong to the Mycenaean II phase. Jar. To the Mycenaean I-IIA phase should be assigned the fragments of a jar with double-axe pattern in olive- black paint; close parallels come from Mycenae.s A sherd from a Palace Style jar is decorated with a palm design. Jug. Sherds from ewers are decorated with pendant pattern (F. pattern 64:9), or argonaut designs. 5. Melos. The sherds mentioned here are representative of a large body of material. Cup. Many fragments belong to the 'Vaphio' type of various sizes, most of them decorated with a connected spiral design.6 Sherds from teacups are patterned with the same design, or with double-axes; for one of these there is a particularly close parallel from Eleusis.7 Two more un- usual designs consist of a connected hatched-loop pattern (cf. F. pattern 63: 2), and a floral pattern of the Mycenaean I phase which has additions in white.s Kylix. Several unpublished sherds are decorated with a wavy border from the rim; occasionally there is a thin wavy line in the handle zone.9 Others have spiral patterns, and there are several of the so-called 'Ephyrean' type, decorated with rosettes or lilies.'0 One-handledjar. One complete example is decorated with a connected hatched-loop design such as occurs on many examples of the same type from the chamber-tombs of Prosymna." x BCH lxxi-lxxii. 459, fig. 35. 2 Cf.

Two almost complete specimens are decorated with a connected spiral pattern (F. pattern 46:29) and lilies.' Alabastron. Most of the alabastra fragments belong to the Mycenaean IIA phase. Those decorated with ogival canopy pattern show little variation from one another.2 A more unusual pattern is that of connected ivy.3 A practic- ally complete example decorated with argonauts and rock- work has a design of wavy lines on the base such as is found on an alabastron from Messenia; the only comparable alabastron as regards design comes from Egypt.4 Amphora. Several sherds of a thick fabric decorated with octopus and other marine motifs belong to large jars such as that from Prosymna.s Others have mock stone patterns like jars from Kakovatos, ripple designs, and connected ivy patterns.6 Bridge-spoutedjar. A sherd of this type ofjar has a vertical hatched-loop pattern similar to one on a jar from Kako- vatos; others have ogival canopy or double-axe patterns.7 Jug. One almost complete example of the bridge- spouted type has an ogival canopy pattern; a sherd with foliate pattern probably comes from a ewer.s E. MYCENAEAN IIIA-B WARE Mycenaean IIIA and B have been grouped together here, as much of the material is frag- mentary, so that it is sometimes impossible to decide to which class a sherd belongs. While most of the pottery appears to have been imported, some fragments painted in the later style are shown by their fabric and paint to have been locally made. These are mentioned together with the imported examples. The amount of the material is greater than for the preceding period and has been furnished by sites in twelve islands, namely Amorgos, Andros, Delos, Keos, Kimolos, Kythnos, Melos, Naxos, Paros, Seriphos, Siphnos, and Tenos. x. Amorgos. Complete examples come from tombs, their exact provenance unknown. Kylix. An example of the IIIA type (F. type 266) has a shallow bowl set unevenly on a tall stem.9 Three-handled jar. Of three vases of the IIIA type, the first, of good piriform shape, is decorated with bands and chevrons; the second has a wavy line in the handle zone; the third, more conical in form, has decoration similar to that of a jar from Kourion in Cyprus.'0 Stirrup-jar. One example of a small globular type has a variant of the Mycenaean III flower; another from Xilo- keratidi, of depressed globular type, is decorated with chevrons and has a running-dog frieze which occurs on a stirrup-jar from Seriphos.z" Both are to be attributed to the IIIB phase. Alabastron. An example of the angular type (F. type 84) is decorated in the handle zone with vertical lines.'2 A frag- ment of a IIIA convex type has a wavy border for design.'" Spouted jar. An example with a coat of red paint (F. type 156) probably dates to the IIIB phase.'4 Teacup. Part of a teacup with red stipple pattern belongs to the beginning of the IIIA phase; other fragments are similar.'s 2. Andros. In the museum of Andros town are three small pots, probably recovered from the same tomb. Their provenance is given as Palaioupolis. Tankard. This example of a common IIIA and B type (F. type 226) retains traces of reddish-black lustrous paint round the rim and body. Alabastron. This is a small specimen of the angular type with traces of painted bands. An unusual feature is two handles instead of three. Stirrup-jar. An almost complete specimen is of the squat biconical type of the IIIB phase. All the paint has gone. 3. Delos. Most of the material comes from the area of the Temenos. Kylix. One complete example of the IIIA undecorated type was found (F. type 267).16 In the museum are two sherds of banded kylix stems; published is a fragment from another decorated kylix showing a voluted Mycenaean III flower pattern (F. pattern 18, A) such as commonly occurs on the pottery of the Argolid and Rhodes.'7 Alabastron. From the Purification Trench on Rheneia comes an example of the angular type of the IIIB phase.'8xs Stirrup-jar.

A fragmentary specimen of a perked-up IIIB type (F. type ISo) is decorated only with bands and lines in very good brown paint.2 Other fragments are in the Delos museum. Two fragments of coarse types were found on the site.3 Three-handled jar. In the Delos museum are several sherds from IIIA and Bjars; all have banded decoration in the lower zones. A more complete vase is decorated in the handle zone with scale pattern in the early IIIA manner.4 Rhyton. The octopus decoration of a rhyton sherd is very like that of a IIIA rhyton from Ras Shamra.s Jug. The body of a small vessel of fine piriform shape may have belonged to ajug like that of IIIA type found in Palestine.6 Pilgrim flask. A large fragment (F. type x89?) probably belongs to the later phase.7 Bowl. An undecorated specimen in the Delos museum is of the common Mainland type with handles set horizontally on the rim.8 4. Keos. The material from the site of Ayia Irini con- sists wholly of sherds picked up on the site. Kylix. One fragment belongs to an undecorated type (F. type 267) probably of IIIA date. Another of the same type has very clumsy handles and the fabric shows it to have been locally made. Another kylix of local manufacture is represented by a sherd of the bowl decorated with an octopus tentacle (cf. F. pattern 21:2I) on which the painter has left reserved areas in the colour of the clay instead of using the more usual white paint.9 The monochrome type with lustrous red wash is also represented by sherds. Three-handled jar. This type was represented by many sherds with banded and spiral decorations (e.g. FIG. 4, no. 8). 5. Kimolos. One sherd was picked up on the site of Ellinika.x'o Possibly it comes from a stirrup-jar of IIIB de- pressed type; the decoration consists of bands and a zone of semicircles in brilliant red paint. 6. Kythnos. A stirrup-jar was seen by Furtwaingler in a dealer's shop with its provenance given as Kythnos."x It is described as being 'of the usual type, with semi-circles on the shoulder'. Such a description might apply to a IIIB jar. 7. Paros. Very little Mycenaean pottery appears to have been found on the site of Paroikia. Kylix. An undecorated type, possibly of the IIIA kind found in Delos, Keos, and Melos (F. type 267), is described in the report. A published fragment may belong to a kylix decorated with scale pattern of IIIA type.'2 8. Seriphos. One large globular specimen (F. type 170Io) is very well preserved, and shows banded and Mycenaean III floral ornament. Furumark assigns it to the later phase of the IIIA period.'3 g. Siphnos. In a trial trench not far from the Kastro was found a single sherd belonging to a kylix with spiral decora- tion.'4 On the rocky slope of To Froudhi tou Kalamitsiou was a kylix base and stem with a rough wash of red paint. Prob- ably this is a local piece imitating Mycenaean monochrome ware. so. Tenos. From the site of Akroterion Ourion come several sherds wih a decoration of bands and spirals which may belong to jars. x x. ,Naxos. The following material comes from Palati- Grotta. Most of the pottery seems to me to be of the im- ported kind, but some fragments come from locally made vases. Kylix. To the IIIA phase may be assigned many sherds ofkylikes with varied decoration. One has a triple-stemmed ivy pattern as on a kylix from Milia (Cyprus) and two others have a linked spiral pattern similar to that on an Enkomi kylix.'S Of perhaps IIIB date are two sherds with a zone of interlocking ivy leaves, a pattern which appears on a bowl from Athens.'6 Another has a voluted version of the Mycenaean III flower (F. pattern 18, A) which is paralleled on kylikes from Mycenae.'7 On many sherds appear various combinations of the common murex motif, and at least two are decorated with versions of the octopus motif with details added in white. Another fragment, with a diagonal form of decoration such as decorates a kylix from Ialysos in Rhodes, may have been manufactured locally, for the clay is coarse and pink in tone and the paint only slightly lustrous.'8xs In addition there are many fragments of undecorated types, and banded stems such as belong to kylikes of both IIIA and B periods. Bowl. There are several almost complete examples of the shallow type of bowl with horizontal handles on the rim, some decorated with bands, others plain. Fragments of other bowls have murex designs or a more geometrical central panel. Tankard. Two practically complete specimens, 14 and 15 cm. high, should be assigned to the IIIB phase. The first has a hooked spiral design (F. pattern 49), the other a triangular design (F. pattern 61:1 3); other sherds show similar designs.'9 Three-handled jar. A fragment with a stylized ivy-leaf design belongs to a large jar with three vertical handles; this is very similar to a jar from Ialysos of the early IIIA SEADlos SEADlos xv, pl. i. 14. 2 Op. cit. pl. i.

Stirrup-jar. There are numerous examples of rather small types with versions of the Mycenaean III flower in the handle zone. Krater. Several fragments come from the neckless type (F. type 8), and these belong to the latter part of the IIIA phase or to IIIB. A large fragment has a tri-curved arch pattern which appears on a krater from Ialysos.2 Two are decorated with a broad linked spiral design like a krater from the Menelaion near Sparta.3 A more unusual piece is decorated with panels of roundel pattern (F. pattern 65) and dates to the IIIB period. 12. Melos. The Third City of Phylakopi has produced the largest amount of IIIA and B pottery from the islands, and the bulk of it is unpublished. Much of it came from the well in the courtyard of the Megaron, but many sherds were also found over the rest of the excavated portions of the site.4 Kylix. A very large number of fragmentary kylikes was found. To the later IIIA phase may be assigned sherds with octopus patterns similar to those on kylikes from Rhodes.s One with a tri-curved arch pattern is again paralleled from Rhodes.6 Other designs are the multiple- stem ivy pattern and variants of the voluted Mycenaean III flower.' A published fragment probably from a kylix is decorated with a hybrid Mycenaean III flower (F. pattern :8, B9); this is a distinctive pattern and may have been pro- duced in the same potter's shop as the other examples of it which come from Mycenae and Prosymna.s Belonging to the IIIB period are sherds decorated with interlocking ivy leaves and a variety of murex patterns.9 One of the finest decorated kylikes is represented by a published sherd which shows a horizontal octopus tentacle along the bowl, with additions in white paint; the closest parallel seems to come from Vari in Attica.'o Plain kylikes and monochrome types were also common." Bowl. Phylakopi provides us with similar bowls to those which came from Naxos. A variety of fragments belong also to two-handled bowls, most of them decorated with the antithetic spiral pattern (F. pattern So). The design is one which lends itself easily to modification, as is seen on these sherds, the fabric of which is good.'2 Some of poorer fabric, thickly slipped to cover the impurities in the clay, are clearly locally made.'3 Teacup. A fragment of a very fine teacup painted with a connected spiral pattern belongs to the early IIIA period.'x4 Tankard. One fragment is decorated in the lower zone with vertical murices.'5xs Spouted bowl. A fragmentary example of this Rhodian rather than Mainland type is decorated with bands of paint.'" Rhyton. A large fragment of one has been published; the decoration consists of an oddly assorted collection of motifs and in this respect it is similar to a IIIB rhyton from Ras Shamra.'7 Another, probably of the same period, is decor- ated with semicircles and bands.'8xs Three-handled jar. A large fragment of a pithoid jar with scale pattern is very like one from Ialysos of early IIIA date.'9 Probably belonging to a larger jar is a fragment with a con- ventionalized ivy motif in the handle zone. Apart from a similar example from Naxos, the other comparable examples come from Thebes, Mycenae, Troy, and Ialysos.20 From smaller jars come sherds with spiral and scale patterns.2' Stirrup-jar. Many sherds come from this type, but owing to their small size it has often been impossible to make out their exact shape. Apart from the usual Mycenaean III flower which decorates the shoulder of most of these, there are a few unusual fragments which deserve mention. One small jar is decorated with a hatched-loop pattern elsewhere unknown on this type.22 Other fragments have groups of arcs on the shoulder; in some, the monotony of the lower striped zone is relieved by a narrow frieze of, for instance, running-dog ornament.23 One fragment which seems to me to be local has a flower on one side of the shoulder and a lozenge on the other.2 One almost completejar is decorated on the shoulder with a connected spiral design in poor orange-red paint; such a decoration is well outside the IIIB koine style.2s Another has a degenerate IIIB pattern of vertical wavy lines such as is seen on ajar from Ras Shamra.26 Krater. A small krater with horizontal side-handles is, to judge from the fabric, an imported piece, but a sherd with a similar pattern of semicircles was manufactured locally."7 Other fragments from kraters have scale patterns or con- nected and hooked spirals.28 A more unusual piece com- bines vertical murices with a voluted Mycenaean III flower.29 Cf.

In the Museum of Classical Archaeology at Cambridge are a certain number of sherds from unspecified Cycladic sites. The material is as fol- lows. Stirrup-jar. Fragments of two small specimens (CC. 23, 25) are decorated with flowers in the shoulder zone. Bowl. A sherd from a bowl or kylix (CC. 30) has a tri- curved arch pattern (F. pattern 62:15) of IIIB style. An- other (CC. 35) with a triglyph pattern (F. pattern 75:4) forms part of a two-handled bowl of IIIB type. Jug. Part of jug with a cut-away neck (CC. 21) approxi- mating to F. type 144 is probably of IIIB date. There is a slight collar and a string-hole through the top of the handle. Alabastron. Part of an angular alabastron is decorated with brown paint with horizontal lines near the base. Above these is a hooked form of decoration paralleled on a IIIA alabastron from Ialysos.' Krater. Probably belonging to small kraters are twosherds, one with a carelessly drawn scale pattern (CC. 31) and the other with bands and spirals on the exterior (CC. 28). F. MYCENAEAN IIIC WARE The only islands which have produced this ware are Amorgos, Delos, Paros, Naxos, and Melos. There is considerable evidence of local manufacture, although some of the pottery seems still to have been imported. x. Amorgos. A complete example of a late IIIC jug (F. type 137) has a trefoil lip and coarse pendant decoration on the shoulder; unfortunately a parallel jug is of unknown provenance." There are also sherds from bowls or kraters, one of them painted in 'Close Style'.3 a. Delos. Fragments from two-handled bowls are re- ported to have been found.4 3. Paros. A fragment of a two-handled bowl with sketchy antithetic spiral decoration is published from the site of Paroikia.s 4. Naxos. Larger amounts of IIIC pottery come from Palati-Grotta. Much of it was locally made. Kylix. The greater part of a kylix of buff clay containing much mica is a local product. The interior is covered with poor orange paint, which is also applied to the rim and handles; the handle zone is decorated merely with a narrow wavy line. Two-handled bowl. One large fragment is painted in 'Granary Style' with a thin antithetic spiral pattern.6 There are many other similar sherds. One almost complete bowl is coated completely with thin reddish paint except for a narrow zone on the exterior which has a thin wavy line in the same paint. A very similar bowl has no decora- tion on the reserved band. Stirrup-jar. A fragment decorated with bands and lines on the lower part of the body has a shoulder pattern (F. pattern 63:35) of the early IIIC phase.7 Another has lozenges or triangles with dotted borders.8, Krater. To a deep krater with horizontal side-handles and rolled rim belongs a large fragment decorated with wing- like motifs; there is a somewhat similar example from Asine.9 Another fragment of the same type of krater is decorated with birds on either side of a geometrical panel; the paint is a good red and probably this piece should be assigned to the earlier part of the period.'0 Jar. Ajar with two side-handles belongs to the 'Granary Class' and is paralleled by ajar from Mycenae." Another, 18 cm. high, is decorated with a spiral pattern filled by lozenges and loops, after the manner of 'Close Style' paint- ing. There are two side-handles and one from the shoulder to the rim; the paint which emphasizes the side-handles is carried through the horizontal bands below them in Proto- geometric style. Several other fragments of the same type ofjar are decorated with dullish black paint with wavy lines down the vertical handle, and have spiral patterns on the shoulder. These are almost sub-Mycenaean in style and should undoubtedly be attributed to the last phase of the IIIC period. 5. Melos. Only a small amount of the pottery of this period from Phylakopi has been published. Kylix. A kylix about 18 cm. high has a conical bowl and two side-handles. Poor, reddish-brown paint coats it in a streaky manner.'2 A fragment of a local kylix has vertical and horizontal bands of orange-brown paint; the formation of the handle is very clumsy.'3 Two-handled bowl. Many fragments are decorated in the 'Granary Style' with spiral or geometrical panel designs."4 Some of them are manifestly local products; their pock- marked surface is due to the burning out of impurities during firing. Apart from these decorated specimens, there is one completely coated with streaky paint like the kylix above."S Alabastron.

Its general date is fixed by the decoration which combines IIIB and C motifs. It is undoubtedly a local product. Stirrup-jar. Several fragments are preserved, but no wholejar. The fabric is generally poor and the black paint lacking in lustre. Typical sherds show that the former even striping of the body has given place to a more uneven application of bands, which are often interspaced by plain zones. Sometimes the latter are broken by groups of vertical lines, or bordered by small semicircles; in one specimen the shoulder is decorated with a geometrical panel.2 Jar. One whole specimen similar to some from Naxos is decorated on the shoulder by a repeating pattern of spirals and panels; on the body is a bird.3 Krater. There are many fragments from kraters, but no whole example. One large fragment belonging to the earlier phase has two vertical side-handles and is decorated with geometrical panels.4 More unusual sherds have broader geometrical panels and semicircles in profusion. The clay of many of these, although well fired and hard, contains many impurities and some, therefore, may have been locally made. A certain class of sherd, decorated with figure-scenes for which there is no exact parallel from any other Mycenaean site, probably come from bowls or kraters. In these we see a revival of older figured styles which de- lighted in the portrayal, albeit sometimes crude, of men and animals.s The contemporary figured kraters from the Mainland and elsewhere may have been instrumental in promoting this kind of painting, but the Cycladic examples are quite distinctive. Many of them seem to picture violent scenes of action, which provide an interesting commentary on the times. 6. Unknown provenance. Several fragments of bowls of kraters, probably belonging to the beginning of the period, are decorated with spiral patterns in lustreless brown or black paint.6 G. CHRONOLOGY Unfortunately we have but few stratigraphical details with regard to the local fabrics of the Late Cycladic I and II periods from Thera and Phylakopi. As regards Thera, it seems likely that the settlements were submerged by volcanic eruption soon after the end of the Late Cycladic I phase, for no L.M. IB or II pottery has been found, although L.M. IA ware was imported. The latest vase from the island is a jug which is decorated in the L.M. IA manner while incorporating an ivy pattern which occurs on a Mycenaean IIA goblet from Lachish.7 It is probably unlikely that there was any further settlement in the Bronze Age, although doubtful 'Mycenaean' sherds were reported from Mesavouno.8 Some of the local fabrics of Phylakopi which copy L.M. I and II models were found in the very latest deposits of the Second City, which indicates that the end of that City did not come before the L.M. I period was well under way.9 In the earlier excavation report it is clear that at the beginning of the Third City the bulk of the pottery is local Melian, but in the later stages it is almost completely displaced by imported wares. In the first half-metre of a trial trench, for example, out of a total of about 3,500 fragments, 2,000 were 'imported Mycenaean' (i.e. Minoan and Mycenaean), I,300oo were of coarse local ware, and 200 or so belonged to local decorated pottery.'0 During the Late Cycladic I and II periods the amounts of Minoan and Mycenaean seem to have been about equal, but in the succeeding period the Mycenaean almost completely ousted the Minoan. It is probable that the megaron was built at the close of the IIIB period, for in the courtyard (and particularly in the well) were found many frag- ments of IIIA and B kylikes."x From the IIIA period onwards at Phylakopi and at other sites where the evidence is less complete, the bulk of the decorated pottery was of the imported kind, showing affinities with Mainland and Rhodian pottery. In the IIIB period, however, some pots seem to have been manufactured locally, and at the end of that period a local figured style, without any exact parallels elsewhere, sprang up at Phylakopi. As evidence for habitation at the very end of the Late Bronze Age, there are pots in almost sub-Mycenaean style from Amorgos, Melos, and Naxos. SPhyl fig. 125. 2 MCAC, PP. 371, 379, 382, 399.

THE INTRODUCTION OF THE MIDDLE BRONZE AGE 'By the end of the early Aegean period, Greece at last possessed a somewhat homogeneous civilization; but the Middle Aegean civilization starts with the disintegration of what limited unity had been created.'" The break-up of the Early Helladic culture is so well known that it need only be mentioned here. As to the effect on the Cyclades, one cannot agree with Frank- fort's further remarks.z Evidence has been given to show that at least fourteen settlements of varying size and importance flourished during various stages of the Middle Cycladic period, though not all seem to have been based on Early Cycladic sites. Matt-painted ware painted in the Rectilinear Style which developed in the late Early Cycladic period occurred throughout the islands with the exception of Thera. Grey Minyan, on the other hand, has a similar distribution with the exception of Amorgos and Thera. While the island Minyan bears resemblances to that of the Mainland, one need not necessarily con- clude that it was introduced first from that quarter. The evidence of the Early Bronze Age period shows that there was particularly close contact between the Cyclades and north-western Anatolia, and if, as seems likely, Minyan ware was introduced to the west from that area, its most obvious route would lie through the islands.3 Whether the introduction of this ware was accompanied by destruction as on Mainland sites it is impossible to say, for the site of Phyla- kopi alone offers evidence which is at all complete; this site, moreover, with its ties with Crete, cannot be regarded as typical of the rest. The continuity of the pottery between the First and Second Cities there suggests that the destruction of the First was not due to aggression but possibly to some natural cause such as earthquake. But the occurrence of Minyan pottery in the early Second City deposits and the sporadic appearance of megaron-type dwellings indi- cates the infiltration of northern cultural elements.4 A thin stratum of burnt matter which occurs throughout the site of Ayia Irini in Keos possibly represents temporary destruction at this period, and the building of the fortification walls in both Tenos (Akroterion Ourion) and Phylakopi suggests that the times were unstable.s When conditions had become more settled it is likely that there was close contact between the Mainland and the islands; which would account for the importation of Minyan ware into the islands from that quarter. We showed reason to believe also that much of the matt-painted ware of the Mainland was dependent on Cycladic types.6 Other evidence of contact between the two areas is given by a series of pottery-marks which occur on ware from Phylakopi, Paros, Aegina, Korakou, Asine, and Lerna.7 Generally speaking, the signs are commonest on coarse ware, but they also occur on painted and Grey Minyan and red burnished fabrics.8 Lerna has produced numerous signs, fourteen of which are paralleled from Phylakopi, but most of them seem to come from later Middle Helladic contexts.9 At Phylakopi, however, the signs occur earliest at the very beginning of, or even a little time before, the introduction of the Middle Cycladic period proper. It seems likely, therefore, that the usage of the signs originated in the Cycladic area and spread thence to the Mainland as trade and intercourse increased.

MIDDLE CYCLADIC II: THE RISE OF PHYLAKOPI The succeeding period, the pottery of which has been termed above 'Middle Cycladic II', should not merely be regarded as a stylistic one, although the Second City of Phylakopi yielded no floor-level which could be considered as distinctly belonging to a period intermediate be- tween the earlier and later stages of the City.x The new style of pottery painted with Curvilinear designs, which derives many decorative elements from M.M. II pottery, appears when the Rectilinear ware is showing signs of break-up; without this style the M.C. III painted wares which chronologically succeed it could not have been created. The Curvilinear Style is not the only new feature at this time. Several new vase-types, the origin of which is Anatolian, make their first appearance. Two of these are the jug with plastic 'breasts', which has no parallel in Crete, though it was copied on the Mainland from Cycladic models; and the spouted jar, a common type in Cretan ceramics from the Early Minoan period onwards, having been adopted from the east. The third type is the bowl with one loop- handle, which occurs on several Cycladic sites, but not at all in Crete or on the Mainland. Some of these Anatolian influences had spent themselves by the beginning of the Middle Cycladic III period, and we are justified therefore in distinguishing an intermediate phase between that and the first Middle Cycladic period. It is a time when Cretan influence becomes more prominent in Melos, and Anatolian influence on the whole Cycladic group. Possibly there was a slight influx ofAnatolian peoples into the Cyclades at this period; this could provide a clue to the mysterious 'Carian' element to which several ancient authorities referred.2 Phylakopi seems to have had a monopoly of Cycladic trade, exporting not only obsidian but also pottery, which has been found in Naxos (Rizokastelia), Siphnos, Aegina, and Athens. It should also be noted that the earliest M.C. pottery from Thera is that which shows a slavish copying of the Melian Curvilinear Style. C. MIDDLE CYCLADIC III: THE THALASSOCRACY OF MINOS For the final stage of the Middle Cycladic period, which culturally speaking passes without a break into Late Cycladic I, there is evidence of a more significant kind. Phylakopi still carries on a vigorous trade, as is shown by the distribution of her pottery, not only among the islands of Delos, Siphnos, Tenos, and Thera, but also on the Mainland at Asine, Athens, and Mycenae. In the earlier part of the period Mainland matt-painted ware still derives some inspiration from contemporary Cycladic pottery, borrowing, for example, the convention of the 'panelled' cup. Aegina too manufactured pottery with a distinct Cycladic flavour. Farther afield, Cycladic sherds of a late transitional type were found at Hala Sultan Tekkt in Cyprus; fragments too of Cypriot pottery in Melos and Thera indicate the line of the sailing-route from the Levant. Of greater interest is the evidence of Cretan connexions at this period. Minoan ware was imported and the local styles of pottery influenced particularly by designs on contemporary frescoes, although it must be emphasized that as yet there was no slavish copying of Minoan ware. One quarter of Phylakopi at least seems to have been thoroughly Minoanized, possessing pillar-rooms and frescoed walls.3 Rhyta in the form of cows' and bulls' heads found at various points of the site suggest that there was some observance of Minoan ritual, and to judge from signs on pottery it seems likely that the Linear A script was in use.4 Nor did Phylakopi alone possess some degree of Minoan culture. Material from Keos includes copies of M.M. III pottery; similar material from Delos and Thera, where pillar- rooms and frescoes were also found, indicates how wide was the diffusion of Minoan culture.s But But Mackenzie observes the three stylistic phases, BSA iv. 28. 2 e.g. Herod. i. 17I.

SCHOLES Cretan blossom-bowls belonging to the end of the present period were found in Delos, Naxos, and Melos; loom-weights with one or two perforations found in Keos, Melos, and Thera are of the same size as examples from Gournia.' Concerning the find of 'Black and Red' bird vases in the Temple Repositories of Knossos (fragments of which have also been found in Thera and at Mycenae), Evans goes so far as to postulate that these, probably containing Melian wine, represent a form of tribute to the ruler of Knossos. 'The volcanic soil of the island' (he goes on to say) 'is in fact specially favourable to the cultivation of the vine, which may have begun here relatively early.'z The same could be said with regard to Thera, in which colonies could have been planted by the inhabitants of Phylakopi for the purpose of such cultivation.3 In support of this hypothesis it should be remem- bered that although the pottery from the island mirrors Minoan styles, it is all dependent on conitemporary Melian ware; much of the material, too, consists of large amphorae and pithoi such as would be used for the storage and transportation of wine. Combining the Cycladic evidence with that from other areas one must conclude that it was at this period that the expansion of Crete was at its height; Minoan pottery from Aegina and Kythera, the influx of Minoan culture and adoption of ceramic styles at Mycenae and elsewhere on the Mainland, the colony planted by Cretans at Trianda in Rhodes, all testify to the power exerted by Crete. It is undoubtedly to this period that the words of Thucydides must refer: MivC0 ydxp irraaAcrcxro 5v d~KOi~ iopEV VUTvruK'V Tcrfaaarro Kai T~is vv 'EA1VIKi~ 0X&amp;acTa~) 1Ti rrwAa-rov aKpdmTTe Kai Trjv KVKA&amp;8cOV vWiciV PE .. .'4 What the status of Phylakopi was it is impossible to say; but the pillar-room complex may well have housed the representative of the ruler of Knossos.s The tradition, moreover, that Minos came to Keos, married a local maiden Dexithea, and left his son Euxantios there as ruler, although it is not to be taken literally, has at least its foundations based upon fact.6 What then was the effect of this state of affairs upon the Mainland? The hypothesis of a Cretan conquest has now been abandoned generally, and indeed the evidence from Mycenae, for example, does not show that Minoan customs had been adopted wholesale. But the theory that trade accounted for the Minoanization which took place during this period does not seem to be wholly satisfactory. It has been argued that behind Mycenae there lies a rich deposit of copper ore which might havebeen traded in exchange for Minoan goods; if this is so, why do Schliemann's graves contain such a large number of arrow-heads made of stone and obsidian? On the other hand there may have been some kind of political alliance between the powers of Crete and the Mainland; but this is rather a question which could only be fully answered by contemporary records which are lacking at the moment. Whatever the relationship, it has been made clear from certain discoveries in the Second Circle at Mycenae that the Minoan goods and pottery were preceded in some degree by pottery from the Cyclades. Not only were fragments of Cycladic vases (i.e. of Melian 'Black and Red' bird vases, such as were found in the Temple Repositories at Knossos) found, but also some pottery of Mainland fabric which is clearly modelled on M.C. III and early Late Cycladic I ware. For example, in Grave Alpha was a small jug of Yellow Minyan fabric, beak-spouted and with the typical bulging throat of M.C. III jugs. A straight-necked jug from the same grave has a naturalistic spiral ornament remarkably similar to one on a sherd from Phylakopi.7 From Grave Beta comes a jar decorated with ivy tendrils and foliate bands applied in a similar Se.g. in the Thera museum, Akr.

III type. One with polychrome decora- tion has a design of birds and reeds, a type of composition common in both Melos and Thera, another traces of vegetable ornament of some kind. A third vase, a hydria of Middle Helladic type, is decorated with large double circles on either side, accompanied by accessory ivy and palmette decoration, a form of decoration again paralleled on a series of spouted jars from Thera.2 And in Grave Lambda was found a jug with connected disk decoration which seems to have been derived from Melian 'Black and Red' schemes of composition.3 Finally in Grave Nu were found two jugs of M.C. III type, one of them decorated with flying birds and ivy tendrils inspired by contemporary Melian ware.4 Cycladic-Mainland parallels, moreover, do not consist only of ceramic material. Noteworthy finds in Thera are part of a dagger blade inlaid with gold axes on a bronze ground, after the fashion of inlaid blades from Mycenae, Prosymna, and Vaphio; and marble and clay goblets of the type found in alabaster in the first Grave Circle at Mycenae.s The construction of graves in the Second Circle there is paralleled by the construction of some of the Phylakopi shaft-graves which appear to have been in use in the M.C. II-III period, and their roofing is similar to that of the houses in Therasia, where beams and reeds were overlaid with clay.6 It is clear therefore from the accumulation of such evidence that the Cycladic population was actively concerned with the Cretans in intercourse with the Mainland. Nor need we look far to find a reason for the Cretan interest in Keos; the settlement of Ayia Irini commands the north-western stretch of the island (with its safe anchorage in the Bay of Ayios Nikolaos) which every ship bound for the Saronic Gulf from the Aegean must safely circumnavigate. D. LATE CYCLADIC I-II The ceramic evidence shows that at the beginning of this period contact was maintained between Crete and the islands of Delos, Keos, Melos, and Thera. At Phylakopi the local pottery loses its distinctive style to become wholly dependent on Minoan models; this is not to be thought of as a sudden Minoanization, as Furumark has said, but rather as the culmina- tion of a process which had begun in the M.C. II period.7 Whether Phylakopi was so active and constant a participant in Aegean affairs is doubtful. The exportation of her pottery seems almost to have ceased.8 Obsidian too was declining in importance for the manufacture of tools and small weapons, although Cretan stone-workers could still find an artistic use for it.o It is towards the end of this period that we observe the rise of the Mainland powers. By the end of the Late Cycladic I period the amounts of Mycenaean pottery imported into the Cyclades equal, and in such islands as, for example, Naxos outnumber, the amounts of Minoan. This ware so closely copies the stock Minoan types and decorative features that it must have been made by potters trained in the Cretan school. It is so fine a product that it found markets as far afield as Byblos and Lipari.x'o E. LATE CYCLADIC IIIA-B The tendencies seen to be developing during the previous period culminate now.

Mycenaean ware, on the other hand, had an in- creased vogue, and has been found in Amorgos, Paros, Siphnos, Tenos, Kimolos, Kythnos, and Seriphos in addition to the islands where Mycenaean I-II pottery has been found. The large megara of Phylakopi and Grotta in Naxos, which are of Mainland type, together with numerous small finds such as sealstones, terracotta idols, bronze implements, and domestic pottery, fully attest Mycenaean settlement. Of unique interest is the deposit of ivories under the Artemision in Delos, of which several pieces, such as miniature columns, are paralleled by recent discoveries at Mycenae.' This deposit, associated with both pre- and post-Mycenaean objects, provides evidence for something more than mere habitation. Now that the Linear B tablets have dis- closed that many of the gods of the Olympian pantheon were already being worshipped, it is not beyond the range of possibility that Delos was the seat of a cult, maybe that of Apollo, at this early period.z The settlements scattered throughout the islands we may regard as convenient stopping- places for ships bound for the Levant. The partial local manufacture of pottery modelled on Mycenaean types may indicate that the importance of these settlements waned when the Rhodian and Cypriot colonies had taken firm root and were becoming somewhat independent of Mainland ties. F. LATE CYCLADIC 0IIIC In the final period a general decline of culture is observable, symptomatic of the general dissolution of Mycenaean civilization. Mycenaean IIIC pottery has been found only in Amorgos, Delos, Melos, Naxos, and Paros. Much of this appears to have been locally made, although it still shows affinity to Mainland types. It is quite clear, however, that the Mainland had lost direct control of the islands, and it is probably for this reason that there is no mention of them in the Homeric Catalogue. The renaissance of a local ceramic style in Melos, displaying scenes of warfare and violent action, is indicative of the events which were bringing the Mycenaean civilization to a dramatic close. K.
