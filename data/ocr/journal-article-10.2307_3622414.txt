Born and brought up in the Jewish faith he became a convert to Islam, whereupon he wrote a tract against the Jews to which he later appended an autobiography. These two docu- ments are of considerable interest and historical value. The Author Samau'al mentions in his autobiography that his father Yehuda b. Abin, a man of considerable accomplishments in Hebrew learn- ing and writing, both prose and verse, had emigrated from the West. It has been suggested that the father can be identified with a minor Hebrew poet of the time. After settling in the East, perhaps to escape persecution under the Almoravides, Yehuda married into a distinguished family in Baghdad.' Samau'al's first teacher was his father who later employed good instructors for his gifted son. Up to age 13, Hebrew, the Bible and its commentaries formed the curriculum in which there is no trace of talmudic study. At the same time, from age 10 to 13, Samau'al read first the Arabic fiction literature of his day - stories, anec- dotes, popular romances of knighthood; later he read the works of historians (Tabari and Ibn Miskawayh in particular). He shows ac- quaintance with Arabic poetry.2 After the boy reached the age of 13, he pursued only secular studies: mathematics, astronomy, and the theory and practice of medicine.3 Before he was twenty he was 1.

His teachers are listed in the autobiography. 15</page><page sequence="11">an accomplished student and practitioner, and began the composi- sition of a series of works on mathematical and medical subjects. His attainments won him wide recognition. It has been shown that Samau'al won a place in the history of science in medieval Islam.6 The most distinguished of his teachers in Baghdad was the phi- losopher-physician Abui-l-Barakat.6 Perhaps a colleague of Samau- 'al's was the young Hebrew poet Isaac, son of Abraham Ibn Ezra, the globe-trotting poet-scholar-commentator, from Spain.7 It is re- markable that the teacher and these two disciples ended by convert- ing from Judaism to Islam. The old man took the step toward the end of his life. The poet was full of remorse, and eager to nullify his conversion. It was left to Samau'al to defend, justify, and uphold the transition to the dominant faith. It seems that Samau'al served as physician to important person- 4. Ibn al-Qifti (died 646/1249) in his Ta'rikh al hukama' (ed. Lippert, Leip- zig, 1903, p. 209) devotes a note to Samau'al's life and works. It seemed to him that Samau'al was born in Spain whence he migrated with his father to the East. He mentions that the conversion was successful (wa-aslama fa-hasuna is- limuhu). He knew of a clash between Samau'al and Ibn al-Khashshab (GAL S v. I 493 f.), a Muslim savant, on mathematical problems. Ibn Abi Usaybica (died 668/1269-70) follows suit in his 'Uyiin al-'anbA' (ed. A. Mueller, Cairo, 1884, v. II, p. 30 f.). His note is based on one by Muwaffaq al-Din 'Abd al-Latif b. Yisuf al-Baghdadi as well as on Ibn al-Qif- ti. 'Abd al-Latif (died 629/1231, GAL S v. I, p. 880) is full of praise for Sa- mau'al's attainments. Bar Hebraeus (d. 1286' in his Ta'rikh Mukhtasar al-duwal [ed. A. Salihani, Beirut, 1890, p. 377] merely reproduces the earlier authors. AI-Safadi (died 1363) in his Wafi (Ms Bodl., cf F. Rosenthal in Osiris v. IX, 1950, p. 560 n. 21) repeats the earlier data but also mentions that he saw a reference to an autograph of Samau'al's listing of eighty-five works. 5. F. Rosenthal in Osiris IX 1950 p. 561, characterizes one of the works-against astrologers-as "an unusually vigorous and well-documented exposition of the idea of progress in scholarship, as exemplified in the field of mathematics." He suggests: "The fact that Samau'al grew up as a Jew, in the cultural milieu of a minority group, appears to have been responsible for his intellectual outlook. It made him receptive for problems which most of those educated in the Muslim majority civilization would, as a rule, consider unimportant and take for granted . . He somehow became afraid of his own boldness . . ." Recently an analysis of Samau'al's mathematical work Al-Bahir fi-l-Hisab showed that the author merite d'etre place au tout premier rang des algebristes arabes. This work is also valuable because it preserved various points of earlier authors. Where Pythagoras claims discovery by revelation, says Samau'al, he (Samau'al) claims to proceed by a method which is devoid of the doubtful ele- ment and is original to boot. He mentions that his own writings are so numerous that he cannot list them all. Cf. the study by Adil Ambuba in Al-Mashriq 1961. 6. See note B96. 7. Cf. H.

At the time of his conversion to Islam he lived in Maragha, where he was physician to local dignitaries and on friendly terms with prom- inent personages. He mentions no contacts with Jews or with their communal life. His travels and work took him far away from his father for whom he shows affection and respect. Upon learning of his son's conversion, the father speedily set out from Syria to Ma- ragha, but died in Mosul on his way. Maragha9 was the capital of a principality which was one of the numerous splinter states that arose on the ruins of the Seljuk empire and persisted during the period of the Crusades.10 It was past the middle of the twelfth century, a stormy time politically, that Sa- mau'al settled there. And it was there, in 558 H/1163, that he em- braced the dominant faith, amidst the congratulations of Muslim friends and patrons who rejoiced that the distinguished scholar had finally seen the light of the true faith.'1 That same night he began to pen his refutation of Judaism: "Silencing the Jews" (Ifham al- Yahud). He tried to show that he was justified in abandoning Juda- ism, and that the Jews were benighted, unreasonable, ignorant, and inconsistent. At least one retort - with Samau'al's rebuttal - has been preserved.12 Four years later a new edition13 was shaped. Here Samau'al adds: (1) the story of his visions in which he talked to his namesake, the Prophet Samuel, and to the Prophet Muhammad; (2) an explanation why he had not made the visions public earlier; (3) an autobiographic outline.14 Samau'al is rather unpleasantly boastful about his mother's fam- ily, about providential guidance towards the light since his very 8. Thus he served and/or wrote for the princes of Maragha (of the Pahlawan house), the rulers of Hisn Kayfa (Ortokids), and a Baghdad wazir Mu'ayyad al- din abu Isma'il. Cf.

He died in 570 H.t5 It seems that his progeny also practiced medicine. The Book The "Silencing" in its present form is a pamphlet of some fif- teen thousand words, consisting of a) the anti-Jewish tratise, b) the author's autobiography. The latter is something of an anti-Jew- ish treatise in its own right. The whole work is, then, a piece of me- dieval polemics directed on behalf of Islam against Jews and Juda- ism. With his usual self-admiration, the author indicates that since previous polemic treatises by distinguished Muslim authors are in- adequate, he has decided to use his "inside knowledge" of Jewish scriptures and affairs to assist the community of the believers in its disputations with the Jews. The Background The polemic literature of Islam is directed, for the most part, against the far more numerous and powerful Christians; the Jews are considered only in passing. Still, from time to time, specifically anti-Jewish polemic tracts have appeared, and it is not suspising to find that it was the Jewish converts to Islam who produced them, supplying the font of information and argumentation against Juda- ism.'6 Christian converts to Islam also served as a quarry of Islamic polemics againt both scripturary faiths. Indeed, Christian views and attitudes concerning Jews, brought along by the ever-growing mass of Christian converts to Islam, could not fail to percolate into Islam.17 15. Ibn al-Qifti gives the date of death as close to 570 H., Ibn Abi Usaybi'a and Safadi as 576. Ibn Abi Usaybi'a mentions that Samau'al died young (mata shdbban). This probably means: under the age of fifty. Samau'al's lifetime may be presumed to have been about 520-570H/1126-1175. The name Al-Maghribi occurs in Adharbayjan as a name of physicians and scholars at a later period. 16. It is sufficient to glance through the list of polemic tracts in Steinschnei- der's Polem-Lit. (1877) p. 110 sq. (which of course could be supplemented now) to see the prevalence of polemics between Christians and Muslims, and the impact of converts. Cf. E. Fritsch Islam und Christentum im Mittelalter (Breslau, 1930). 17. By the middle of the ninth century, a Nestorian had written against Jews and was followed by a flow of Christian polemics that dealt with Is- lam but did not mince words about the Jews. Cf. SPL 45, 416. 18</page><page sequence="14">The Koran,"8 of course, became a mine of anti-Jewish passages. The Hadith did not lag behind.'9 Popular preachers used and em- bellished such material.20 Scholars, commentators of the Koran, and historians sought elucidation of references to the Jews of times past. Passages from the Old and the New Testament became the stock-in-trade of the disputants. If the scriptures are divinely in- spired, the Muslims reasoned, they must contain references to the advent of Muhammad and Islam. If they do - why do not the scripturaries see and understand them; if they do not - they must have been either wholly or partially distorted, forged, or tampered with (tabdil, tahrif). Besides, the scripturaries possibly do not know the right interpretation (ta'wil). The scriptures still may contain al- lusions to Islam and the Prophet (aclam). Muslims held that scrip- tures, laws, and dispensations can by divine command be changed, discarded, substituted for earlier ones, or entirely abrogated (naskh). Attempts at solution of the problem along with questions of exegesis, history, theology - and logical consistency - resulted in an im- broglio. Rationalists were quick to ridicule the fervour of the theo- logians of all three faiths.21 Jewish schismatics, especially the Karaites of the 8-10th cen- turies, subjected various Jewish institutions, especially post-biblical lore,2 to criticism, and this was partially known to Muslims. In their attempt to adjust themselves to the intellectual ferment in the Islamic world and to its influence, the Jews had to produce refutations of early anti-Jewish references and disputations. Such 18. T. Andrae in Der Ursprung (p. 198 f.) draws attention to the Christian origin of many of the arguments in the anti-Jewish polemic of the Prophet. 19. G. Vajda in JA 1937. 20. M.

He mentions discussions and disputes be- tween Muslims and Jews; Jewish attempts to take the offensive in them; the wavering position of many Muslims in evaluating Jewish and Christian scriptures and their claim to authenticity. He is eager to point out the contradictions, illogical statements, wrong calcula- tions, geographical and historical misstatements, and above all, in- appropriate utterances about God and the prophets, especially an- thropomorphisms (tajsim) that occur in the scriptures. Questions are posed on authorship, time, manner, and purpose of composition of the biblical books. This important work, however, may have had only limited circulation on account of the author's precarious repu- tation in Muslim scholarly circles resulting from his intransigence in adhering to unpopular theological views.25 Samau'al, over a century later at another end of the Islamic world, wrote his compendium of polemics against the Jews after reading some of the earlier literature on the subject. The Polemicist Thus the earliest preserved Muslim compendium of polemics di- rected specifically against the Jews and their faith was produced by the Jewish convert to Islam, Samau'al. The "Silencing" contains the following sections (fasl): 1) opening; 2) abrogation; 3) transmis- sion; 4) cf. 2; 5) Jesus and Muhammad; 6) the claim to being the chosen people; 7) the Bible; 8) composition of the Bible; 9) Jews 23. Saadia's Amanit (ed. S. Landauer, Leiden, 1881) was translated by S. Rosenblatt (New Haven, 1948). Qirqisani's work was published by L. Nemoy (New York, 1939-43). The chapter on Islam (v.

The "Silencing" thus attempts to invalidate the views of the Jews and to deride their practices as sheer folly. The faith of the Jews is based on their concept of the scriptures, of the scriptures' reliability as a record of the past and their validity for the future. The critique of transmission is to demonstrate that the first premise is a fallacy; the theory of abrogation is to under- mine the second premise. Now the deck has been cleared for the at- tack on the Jews' practice: clinging to their false position on the scriptures, they entertain wrong notions about Jesus and Muhammad; they falsely claim to be God's own people; and their ritual and law contain degrading and absurd practices and norms. But the author apparently thinks it is his task to go beyond denunciation and to ex- plain the source and origin of the wrong theory and wrong practice, to go on from symptoms to diagnosis and etiology. The reader there- fore is offered an explanation as to the true origin of the Torah and the implied basis of the Jews' behaviour. The Torah is a compila- tion by Ezra, the Aaronid. The priests had a vested interest in maintaining the rule of the Torah, and through it their own rule in the Second Commonwealth, to the exclusion of the Davidic House. That is why the latter is tainted and denigrated in the scriptures. The Jews' behaviour is moulded by 1) an internal factor - the rab- bis who seek to preserve the Jewish community by segregation from, and animosity toward, non-Jews, and 2) an external factor - the Gentiles' attitude toward the Jews, and the position of the Jews, a people scattered in exile among the Gentiles. The Jews are thus ex- posed to oppression and persecution from without, and to fraudulent misleading from within. Thus the discussion of the "Jewish question" is put, rather un- expectedly, in terms of ingenious historical and social observations. Physician that he is, Samau'al passes on from diagnosis to thera- peutics. Evidently, conversion to Islam is prescribed. However, the call to the mosque is not as simple as it might appear at first. Judaism is proved to be without foundation. But why conversion to Islam? It would have been too glaring a non sequitur to turn to the faith of the dominant majority without an enquiry into its ten- ets and precepts It is at this point that a different aspect of Samau'al becomes prominent. 21</page><page sequence="17">The Raiort Samau'al pose as the rationalist. Reason is the supreme arbiter between proofs and arguments concerning facts, men, faiths. As there are various faiths, it is for Reason to decide which is the right one. To the extent that a faith is based on alleged reports of past events and on the transmission of such reports-and the three mono- theistic faiths all depend on such-it is for Reason to test the reports. Again and again Samau'al harps on pure logic as the spring of his conversion. True, he has had visions that urged him to take the final step. But actually, he insists, he had known all the arguments for conversion before embracing Islam. To his patron who launches him in the community of true believers he does not mention the visions. For four years he suppresses any mention of them, not only for fear of ridicule, but mainly because he wants people to under- stand that it is a set of syllogisms and deductions that leads him to Islam. Logic will show that the three faiths and their respective founders, Moses, Jesus, and Muhammad, may have equally valid claims to recognition, in which case - this conclusion is not drawn - Islam might be the most inclusive faith (holding in esteem the founders of Judaism and Christianity) just as Judaism is the most exclusive (as it rejects the claims of both Christianity and Islam). Samau'al stumbles, however, against another logical possibility. Why must one choose one of the three faiths? Why prophethood and religion at all? Neither can be logically demonstrated, or proved. In a most revealing passage, Samau'al hastens to get away from the unwholesome discussion of the skeptic position by remarking that the prophets and religions - all of them - taught the good life and contributed to social welfare, maintenance of institutions and of the polity.26 Samau'al, beginning with proud reason, ends with pragmatic opportunism: accommodation to existing society and to prevailing religious attitudes A man of the world, of the Islamic world, he seeks "to belong" fully. He is proud of its achievements, and has no patience with the petty particularism of what is to him an ossified minority, a remnant of an older and obsolete civilization. Thus there is a second basic aspect in Samau'al's tract with its 26. Cf. F. Rahman, Ptophecy in Islam (London, 1958) p. 40 f, 59 ff. 22</page><page sequence="18">wavering: on the one hand unfettered Reason, doubt as to the validity of faith; on the other hand, the logically equal validity of all faiths, the social value of religion; and finally, accommodation to the convenience of the leading surrounding civilization. It demon- strates the gravitation of the marginal man to the focal points of his social environment. There is hardly anything new here, either in the polemics or in the rationalistic attitude. Elements of both can be traced to earlier sources, and must have been absorbed by our author in his reading and discussion. However, no direct source or major influence can be discerned. The author does not name any of his predecessors in the field, though he does mention them in a general way. It would be of particular interest to determine whether he knew the work of Ibn Hazm who had written a century earlier and with whom he shows much affinity. However, it would rather appear that both used com- mon sources independently. Sets of biblical passages to confound the Jews and/or indicating the advent of Islam, a critique of the oral law, a search for rational interpretation of ancient precepts along with rationalist queries - all these had a wide circulation. A number of them can be traced in the monotheistic communities and their sects, as well as among Zoroastrians and Manicheans. The same interreligious discussion that on the one hand contributed to parti- sanship, zeal, fanaticism, and bigotry, did, on the other hand, in some minds pave the way toward recognizing the weakness of the disputants' claims, the dependence of their views upon certain his- torical and social circumstances, and the relative good in various systems. The result was the notion of "equal validity" of proofs, ar- guments, and the rise of a mood of indifferentism (of both mystic and skeptic) and tolerance.27 Samau'al shows the influence of this trend, but was unable to follow it consistently. He combines relativism with intolerance against the Jews and their tenets, avoiding and ignoring the possible cri- tique of the dominant faith he is championing. It is strange that he shows no acquaintance with the literature of Islamic theology and philosophy. His only reference is to the ra- tionalist preface to Kalla wa-Dimna. This is much as if somebody in our day were writing on religion or social problems on the basis of a Shavian preface or a novel by Sinclair Lewis.28 27. M. Perlnann in JQR 1950. 28. Samau'als reference is to the epistle of Bardhawayh the physicin. Cf . E. I. L2v. 23</page><page sequence="19">It stands to reason that our author was acquainted with the phi- losophical literature but was not eager to betray that knowledge in a tract designed to commend him to pious readers who regard phi- losophy as the path to godlessness.29 What Samau'al has to say on the "Jewish question" is possibly a reflection of the thought of such Jewish intellectuals as were not inclined, or able, or trained, to follow the path of the philosophers from Saadia to Maimonides (whose older contemporary Samau'al was) in their cogitations on the destiny of the Jewish people, and on a rationale for its continued existence. Impact The Vita mentions the success of the Silencing and the dis- semination of copies in several countries. This seems plausible. Later polemic literature of Islam usually shows the direct or in- direct influence of the Silencing. An important work of this type was Qarafi's (d. 684/1285) al-Ajwiba-l-fakhira, with numerous excerpts from the Silencing. Indeed a ms. in the British Museum of Qarafi's tract has (the copyist's?) marginal remark: "most of this discourse is from the Silencing by Samau'al." Likewise, Ibn Qayyim al-Jauziya (XIV century) leans heav- ily on the Silencing both in his Hidayat al-hayara, and in the work Ighathat al-lahfan min masa'id ash-shaytan. The quotations in the latter are very extensive.s Through these works the influence of Samau'al must have spread even further. When, a hundred years after Samau'al, the Baghdad Jewish physician-philosopher Sacd b. Mansiir b. Kammuina, wrote his Crit- ical Inquiry into the Three Faiths, he used Samau'al's tract as the most representative and typical summary of Muslim polemics di- rected against Jews, and quoted Samau'al's arguments against the Jews. A rebuff by a Muslim author again draws upon Samau'al.83 29. Cf. I. Goldziher Stellung der alten islamischen Orthodoxie zu den antiken Wissei:schaften (Abh., Berlin, 1916); H. S.

Presumably he is mentioned by Al- harizi (d. ca. 1225).32 The chronicler Yosef Sambari (17 c.) has a rhymed prose remark about him: "He compiled the book "Silenc- ing," black as coal, and claimed to have compiled a book for the faith of Ishmael, and God separated him for evil from all the tribes of Israel. HIe made many copies of this book which he distributed to king and dignitaries in order to find favour with his new core- ligionists."33 We should also mention an Arabic tract translated into Latin, and from Latin into many Western languages, which has been er- roneously connected with Samau'al (Epistola Samuelis Marrocani ad R. Isaacum contra errores Judaeorum).8 Text and Edition The oldest known text of the Silencing is the Tehran ms. which claims to be a copy of a ms. in Samau'al's handwriting, and is dated 685/1286. Only the tract appears here, not the autobiography. Instead, the tract is followed by an exchange of epistles: one sent to Samau'al after his conversion, and containing an obviously malicious and iron- ical query about his conversion; the other - the rebuttal by Sa- mau'al. A copy of this exchange exists in Istanbul also. The Tehran text differs substantially from that extant in all the other copies: some passages appear in a different order; whole pages of the other texts do not appear here at all. Thus the earliest avail- able text gives a version different from that of all the other texts. There is a further detail peculiar to this version: the Hebrew quotations, which appear in all the other texts in Arabic translitera- tion and translation, appear here in Hebrew characters as well (in an attempt to reproduce the Hebrew script of the original ms. from which the Tehran ms. was copied). Where it differs from the other 32. In the third maqama. D. Kaufmann tried to connect the Silencing with Abr. b. Daud's Emuna Ra- ma (RE] v.

The Latin tract claims to be a translation of an Arabic tract written by a Jewish convert to Christianity. 25</page><page sequence="21">texts, the Tehran ms. shows greater simplicity of exposition and struco ture. All these data entitle us to put it into a category by itself.s Presumably, we have here a copy of an original text written be- fore the Vita was penned in 562 H., i.e. in the years 558-562 H. The preservation of the epistles points in the same direction. The epistles presumably explain why Samau'al was forced to write his Vita, to persist in his claim that pure logic and mere consistency of meditation had led him to Islam; and that only the timing of his conversion was to be explained by the inspired visions he had had in 558, which visions he had not seen fit to report during 558-562 H. The Hebrew characters were too strange to the Muslim copyists and were later dropped, possibly by the author himself. There is no doubt that all the other texts follow another version, the later expanded version. This would suggest that over a number of years the author, while dictating his tract to copyists (as he himself mentions in the Vita), polished up the original text, adducing new arguments. Not only the author's meticulousness, but the necessity to rebuff his op. ponents, whose interest was aroused by the discussions following the appearance of the tract, made Samau'al introduce changes in the original text; whether this was done by stages, resulting in the later version, or in a single revision of the original tract, there was some disruption of the original order and sequence. The revised version was probably prepared along with the autobiography, in which case it can be dated 562/1166-7. Chionologically, the next ms. is that of Cairo, dated 732/1332." It includes the later (longer) version and the Vita. Its contemporary is the incomplete Paris ms. (735/1334-5) containing a portion of the Silencing and the complete Vita.37 35. Cat.

May God pray over our master Muhammad. To proceed. Praise to God for inspired guidance and protection from error; prayer over Muhammad, the seal of the prophets, and his pure family. It is the way of a man who has been graced with understanding and guidance in the right course to exert himself to inquire into the circumstances of the life to come, and to consider with an examining and critical eye what he has inherited from his father and forefa- thers. If he considers that legacy to be a virtue, he will strive to mas- ter it; but if he finds it a vice, he will flee its entanglements in order to ensure that his life be well stocked with meritorious deeds,la for verily, death unseen is in waiting. Not happy will be the end for him who is slow to fortify his religion, and who spends his time in fol- lowing his natural inclinations. Only strenuous seekers after the truth will succeed in their quest, and only those with perverted souls will permit fables to befuddle them.' The ultimate purpose in writing this work is to refute that ob- stinate and stubborn people, and to reveal with what corruption their tenets are beset. It is true that, before my time, leading authorities- may their reward be augmented - applied themselves to this matter and pursued several lines of polemics with the Jews, but the latter hardly understood most of the controversy, nor found it convincing. By using scriptural passages current among the Jews, this book clears the way to silencing them. God made the Jews blind when they tampered with the text; so that these same passages, possessed by the Jews, might thus serve as evidence against the Jews. Forcing them to admit abrogation Here is the first point with which I begin to compel them to ac- cept abrogation [naskh]2 on the basis of the wording of their scrip- ture and in accordance with their own methods.B We say to them: was there a Divine Law [sharc] before the reve- la. Literally: his coffers become well stocked with provision. In the Koran 89, v. 13 God "lies in ambush." 1. This opening paragraph is in rhymed prose. 2. Of the Bible by the Koran, of J',daism by Islam. 33</page><page sequence="29">lation of the Torah, or was there not? If they answer in the nega- tive, they deny what the second portion of the first book of the To- rah spells out: that God legislated unto Noah - upon whom be peace - retaliation for murder. It says:8 anln ns riy M4,6H O5X '^ IDt' Ion Cmi DI'Im 01 ci 1X [2a] which means: Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed; for in a noble image made He man.B2 A further testimony is to be found in the third portion of the first book of the Torah. Here God legislated unto Abraham circum- cision of the newly-born male child to be performed on the eighth day after birth.4 These - and other such matters - are precepts, for divine law consists either of positive command or of negative injunction by God to His worshippers, whether it be by mouth of the prophet, or by writing on scrolls or tablets, etc. But if they do admit that there was some Divine Law, we say: What say you about the Torah, did it or did it not add some- thing to those earlier precepts? If it did not add anything it is mean- ingless, since it contains nothing beyond the earlier legislation and is of no import. Hence, it cannot be of divine origin. But this, in your religion, would be tantamount to unbelief. Again, if the To- rah did contain something additional, did or did not that addition prohibit what had formerly been permissible? Should they deny this, their thesis is rendered worthless on two counts. Firstly, the Torah forbade any manner of work on the Sabbath, which previously had been lawful.5 This in itself is indeed a case of abrogation. Secondly, in law, any addition has no other purpose than to prohibit what has previously been permitted, or to permit what has previously been forbidden. If they say that the wise onea does not prohibit a thing, later to permit it, because by so doing he would be like someone who com- mands a thing and its very opposite, the answer is that one who commands a thing and its opposite at two different points in time does not contradict himself in his command; though he would be self-contradictory if the two commands were simultaneous.BS 3. Gen. 9:6 4. Gen. 17:10-14. 5. Ex. 20:8-11. 5a. i.e., God. 34</page><page sequence="30">They may say that the Torah prohibited what had formerly been permissible but did not permit what had been unlawful, and that objectionable abrogation [naskh makrih] consists in rendering the prohibited lawful - for if one has been permitted a thing but abstains from it considering it unlawful unto himself, he is not a violator; rather he is the violator who has been enjoined to abstain from something, yet practices it, permitting unto himself that which has been prohibited.B4 The answer to this is: [2b] He who declares as lawful that which the law has prohibited is in the same category as he who prohibits what the law has declared lawful. For each of them has contravened the stipulations of the law and misinterpreted its wording. If it is pos- sible that the law of the Torah should proscribe that which has been considered lawful by Abraham and others before him, then it is possible that still another law should declare lawful that which has been forbidden in the Torah. Furthermore, prohibitions can either be imposed for all time, God being displeased with the forbidden thing per se; or not dis- pleased with it per se, He may forbid that thing for a certain time. Now if God forbids working on the Sabbath, it follows that this prohibition was in force also for Abraham, Noah, and Adam; for essentially there was Sabbath in their time, too, and Sabbath was the reason for prohibition. But if working on the Sabbath was not prohibited to Abraham and his predecessors, then the prohibition was not per se, i.e., not for all the time that the Sabbath, as such, existed. Consequently, the Jews have to conclude that the prohibition of work on the Sabbath was not for all time and that it is not impos- sible that this prohibition could be abrogated at another time. If a bearer of apostolic miracles and signs of prophethood should arise later, after a long interval, he might bring the message of the abro- gation of many stipulations of the law, whether by proscribing what it has hitherto considered lawful or by permitting things hitherto prohibited. If a man has presented clear proof [of his mission] how can ob- jections be raised concerning his commands and injunctions, irre- spective of whether they do or do not agree with human understand- ing? And especially so when his opponents have for a long time wor- shiped under precepts as contrary to reason as those of cleansing their impurities with ashes of the heifer burned by the Aaronid priest 35</page><page sequence="31">on the eve of the holiday [hajj],6 and the defiling of the pure one with these very ashes? Whilst what is claimed as revelation unto this man7 is far more reasonable. Certainly, divine aets and conuiiands are exalted far above the limitations of human minds But inasmuch as religious [3al ritual acts neither benefit God Almighty nor protect Him from harm, for He is beyond imperfection, or benefit, or harm, what would render impossible or prevent His prescribing a law for one people and pro- scibing it for another; forbidding something unto a people, only to declare it lawful for their children, and even forbid it again for those who come after them? How can a worshiper oppose God's Messeger who declares lawful that which has been unlawful to a group; how can the wor- shiper argue that the Apostle is a fraud after the Apostle has pro- duced cear proof, and when reason compels one to accept the Apos- te's trustworthiness and authority? Is this not sheer presumptuous- ness and error -- a deviation from truth? Silencing the Jews and the Christians with rational proof, and compelling them to accept Islam A sensible man cannot repudiate one prophet, whose teaching has wide acceptance and whose cause is well established, and believe in another. For he has seen neither of them nor witnessed the mira- cles of either. If he chooses to believe one and to repudiate the other, then logically he exposes himself to reproof and contempt Let us take an example. Thus, if we ask a Jew about Moses - may he rest in peace- that is, whether he, the Jew, has seen Moses and witnessed his mira- cles, the Jew will necessarily admit that he has seen nothing of the kind himself. We then say to him, "How do you know of the pro- phethood of Moses and of his veracity?" If the Jew says that tra- ditional transmission [tawatur] confirms this, and that the testimo- nies of the nations as to its truth furnish strong rational proof, just as the transmission of reports and accounts make us logically certain of the existence of lands and rivers we have not seen, we say, "There is such transmission of tradition concerning Muhammad and Jesus 6. Nuz. 19. In Arabic the word means pilgrimage but no doubt the Hebrew meaning holiday is intended. 7. i.e. Muhammad. 36</page><page sequence="32">just as there is for Moses, and so you must believe also in the former two." If the Jew says, "The testimony of my father about the prophet- hood of Moses is reason for my affirmation of his prophethood," we say to him, "But why is your father, in your opinion, right in this matter and immune from error?" Now you see that infidels are also taught by their fathers, taught what you consider unbelief; this being done either out of partisan- ship for one's faith and reluctance to forsake the community and abandon one's people [3b] and clan, or because the fathers and elders have transmitted the belief to him; and he has accepted it, con- vinced that therein are guidance and salvation. Now, if you consider all the denominations you repudiate as unbelievers - though their followers have inherited their tenets from their fathers just as you have taken your religion from your father - and if you still con- sider that what they maintain is error and ignorance, you will be obliged to inquire into what you have taken over from your father lest it prove to be in the same category. If he says, "What I have taken over from my father is truer than what other people have taken from their fathers," he must pro- duce evidence for the prophethood of Moses beyond mere following in his father's footsteps [taqlid], for he now claims the truth of that prophethood not by virtue of mere imitation."B If he asserts that the reason for the truth of what he has been told on the authority of his father is that his father surpasses the fa- thers of other people in veracity and knowledge - as the Jews will assert concerning their ancestors - he is obliged to produce evi- dence that his father was more intelligent and virtuous than the an- cestors of other peoples. Should he claim this, it is a false claim, since proof of the virtues of anyone of such description must of ne- cessity be adduced from the records of his past. The assertion of the Jews is invalid for, with respect to records of the past on a world scale, they do not have as many as other peoples; rather, in all truth, there is no mention of them among the peoples who developed the exact sciences and systematized them for later generations. All that is ascribed to them in the sciences, including what they borrowed from others, cannot compare with certain of the scholarly disciplines evolved by the Greek wise men, or with the sciences developed by Aramaic-speaking people [Nabat]. As for works by Muslims, they are so numerous that it is impossible for any single human being to 37</page><page sequence="33">encompass all that they wrote in any one scientific discipline, so vast and extensive is their literature. If such is the Jews' position among the nations, then their assertion that their fathers were the most intelligent, wise and virtuous of men, is groundless.B6 Their fathers are equal to the forefathers of other people, who were like- wise of the progeny of [4a] Shem the son of Noah-peace upon them both. Now, if they admit the equality of their fathers with the fa- thers of others - who taught their progeny unbelief - it follows that the testimony of fathers cannot be a proof of the truth of reli- gion. Then they are left with no other argument for the prophethood of Moses than the testimony of the chain of transmission [tawatur]. But there is such transmission for Jesus and Muhammad, just as there is for Moses. If they believe in Moses because of the testimony of transmission about his prophethood, they have to accept as true also the mission of Jesus and of Muhammad - peace upon them.B7 Another way to establish abrogation on the basis of their own sources We say to them: Do you live in accordance with Mosaic law today? If they say 'yes,' we say to them: Is it not said in the Torah that whosoever touches a bone, or steps on a tomb, or is present at the death of a person, will be placed in a state of defilement of which he can rid himself only with the ashes of the heifer which the Aaronid priest used to burn?8 They cannot deny this, because this is a passage current among them. Further, we say to them: Why then have you stipulated that a person who has touched a bone, tomb, or corpse remains pure and is fit to pray and carry the scrip- ture - though this is contrary to what is in your book? If they say: Because we lack the means of purification, that is, the ashes of the heifer, or the priest to purify and pray for forgive- ness, we say: Do you, then, think, or do you not think that because you are unable to perform this act, you may dispense with it? If they say, 'yes, we may,' they admit that precept has been abrogated by reason of present circumstances. If they say, 'no, we cannot dis- pense with the purification,' they recognize that they are impure so long as they do not possess the means of purification. We then-say to them: If you be unclean in your own view, and according to 8. Nu. 19:11, 16, 17.</page><page sequence="34">your own sources, why do you continue to shun a woman for seven days after the conclusion of her menstrual period,9 [4b] and to be so strict about it that should the garment of one of you touch the gar- ment of the woman, you would declare him and his garment un- clean? If they say: Because this is a precept of the Torah, we say: Is it not in the Torah that by the precept purity is intended? But if you cannot attain purity, and if your impure state cannot, in your belief, be removed by ablution, as is the impurity of menstruation, then your impurity is stronger than the impurity of menstruation. Furthermore you consider the menstruating woman clean if she be not of your community; you will not declare impure her touch, or the garment that she has touched; you confine this matter of men- strual impurity to your own community.10 But that is not in the Torah. All of which amounts to abrogation or alteration (tabdil) on your part.38 If they say that this, even though the scriptural text (nass) does not mention it, occurs in their system of law (fiqh), we say to them: Now what will you say about your legists? All those various points of dispute and various tenets, numerous as they are among you, are they the fruit of human effort and judgment [ijtihad] and rea- soning [istidlil], or are they tradition itself? They will say: Our le- gists took over all that is in the books of our jurisprudence from the rabbis who drew upon reliable earlier authorities that go back to Joshua the son of Nun, to Moses who spoke with God [kalim Allh]," and to God Almighty.12 Then it follows that in every single problem about which two of your legists disagreed, each will sustain his belief in the matter with a tradition going back to God Almighty. Thus, vileness pervades them to such a degree that they ascribe to God contradictory commands on any given problem. This is precisely the kind of abrogation the Jews iepudiate. But if they say that this dissension is of no practical import be- cause the ancient sages, after dissension on a problem, would reach a joint decision, which is the final decision, we say: Their re- course to agreement after dissension is the result either of one of the rabbis giving up his tradition, or of a blemish in his tradition caus- ing his testimony r5a] to be impugned, in which case you should no 9. Lev. 15:19 sq. 10. b. Nidda f. 34. )1. An appellation for Moses on the basis of the Koran 4:162. 12. Of. Abot I. 39</page><page sequence="35">longer give consideration to anything transmitted on his behalf; or else, the legists have agreed to abrogate one of the two opinions, Le., that the report by one abrogated the report by the other. Yet, there is hardly a legist whose opinions do not get quashed in many matters. This position would be madness for one who does not admit abro- gation and who considers the words of the partners to the dispute to be not the result of human judgment and speculation, but rather a pure divinely-inspired tradition. Another way of forcing them to admit abrogation We say to them: What do you say about your prayers and fasts? Are they the ones that Moses left with you? If they say 'yes', we say: But did Moses and his people use to say in their prayers as you do: nim3z y1ntw nn -Tm ,1zY= i p P5 3 Ht lw 1nlnn1 -o nstwn ypn iwltv lioy pnn D p ' n 11Tn ,lrp nl x nSH meaning 0 sound a great trumpet for our freedom, [and hoist a banner to collect us] and gather us together from the four corners of the earth to thy holy ground; Blessed art thou, 0 Lord, who gathereth the scattered ones of his people Israel.1 Or did they say in the time of Moses as you do every day: "imp l'y Da5tU1:8 niw mml n5nnlD l:syl^ l 1n:1tR23 w il mt53t :tt .Ivvytl 4V f nmt 'n nnH 13s ,l1nn nnn tm aD which means Restore our judges as aforetime, and our counsellors as at the be- ginning; and build Jerusalem Thy holy city in our days, and console us [in its rebuilding]. Blessed art Thou, 0 Lord, who rebuildeth Jerusalem.'8 Or do these passages testify [5b] that you fabricated them after the destruction of the Jewish state? As to the fast of the burning of the Temple, the fast of its siege, and the fast of Gedalia which you made obligatory, did Moses ob- serve them, or did he or his successor, Joshua b. Nun, enjoin them? Or the fast of the hanging of Haman? Are these enjoined in the To- rah, or were they added for reasons that called for such additions in 13. From the 'Amida. 40</page><page sequence="36">the course of centuries? If they say: How does that compel us to accept abrogation, we say: Because the Torah has this verse:4 you shall not add to this word which I command you thereof, nor diminish from it.B Having added precepts, you have abrogated that verse. wOD lyln r&amp;13= D 14H nwD 4m W:K nan by 19Dln K5 Another way of establishing the fact of abrogation We say to them: Is it not in your text that God chose from among the children of Israel the first-born that they may be consecrated for holy service?15 They will say, 'yes.' We then say to them: Is it not in your text that Moses, when he descended from the mountain with the tablets in his hands and found the people worshipping the calf, stood at the rim of the camp and called: Whoso is on the Lord's side, let him come unto me.6 The sons of Levi, not the first-born, joined him although his appeal, literally addressed to all, had been intended only for the first-born inasmuch as it was they who were the chosen of God at the time, not the children of Levi. So when the first-born deserted him, and the children of Levi assisted him, God said to Moses:17 .5w r l*t r 13 ) nnn s4=n nK npSl which means: And I have taken the Levites instead of all the first- born among the children of Israel. Did not God, following the revela- tion of this verse, dismiss the first-born from the privileged status and take the Levites in their stead? They cannot deny this, and this will compel them to admit either [6a] alteration (bada') of divine de- termination'8 or abrogation.B1 Compelling them to accept the prophethood of Jesus - God's prayer and blessing upon him We say to them: Is it not in the Torah that you have:19 4I5l 140= ppinDl nmllr tDr I1D'4 MS 14.

Gen. 49:10 41i</page><page sequence="37">which means: Kingship shall not depart from the people of Judah nor the staff from amongst them until the Messiah has come.Bl1 They cannot deny that. We then say to them: Do you not know that you once had a state and kingdom up to the advent of Jesus, and that then your kingdom came to an end? If you do not have a kingdom to- day, it follows from the Torah that the Messiah has already been sent. We also say to them: Was it not since the mission of Jesus - upon whom be peace - that the kings of Rome ruled over the Jews and Jerusalem, and that the state of the Jews came to an end and the Jews were dispersed? They cannot deny this without becoming ab- surd. So it follows from their own source, from the Torah, that Jesus the son of Mary is the Messiah they were expecting.20 Compelling them to accept his prophethood and the prophethood of Muhammad - peace upon them both B12 We say to them: What say you about Jesus the son of Mary? They will say: The son of Joseph the carpenter by fornication; he learned God's great name and with its help used to impose his will upon many things.21 We say to them: Is is not true that, according to your best tradition, Moses was taught by God the divine name composed of forty-two lettersBl1 with which Moses parted the sea and performed the miracles? They cannot deny this. Then we say to them: If Moses also performed miracles by invoking the names of God, why do you believe in his prophethood and reject that of Jesus? They will say: Because God Almighty taught Moses the divine names, whilst Jesus learned them not by inspiration but from the walls of the Temple. We say to them: If that which enables one to perform mira- cles can be attained by a person not selected by God and to whom [6b] God does not wish to teach it, then how may Moses be believed? They will say: Because he received the divine names from the Lord. And we will ask: How do you know he received them from the Lord? They will say: By the chain of transmission of reports from our an- cestors. We further force them to take recourse to their ancestors' tradi- tion by saying to them: By what do you recognize the prophethood of Moses? If they say: By the miracles he performed, we say to them: Has any of you seen those miracles? This is indeed no way to verify 20. This notion is incorporated in the Koran. 21. Following medieval folk-lore. 42</page><page sequence="38">the prophetic missions; for it would follow that the miracles should be perpetuated beyond the lifetime of the prophet in order that every generation might behold the miracles and believe them. But this is not necessary. For if a prophet has appeared in a certain age and his prophethood proven true by miracles performed by him for the people of that time, and if the report thereof reaches the people of another age, the latter must believe in his prophetic mission and follow him, because (authenticated) transmitted reports and well-established phe- nomena must be accepted by reason. Moses, Jesus, and Muhammad - God's prayer and blessing upon them - are equals in this respect. If anything, the transmission of evidence for the prophethood of Mo- ses is weaker than that for the mission of Jesus and Muhammad, since the evidence of the Muslims and Christians for the mission of Moses is based merely on the fact that their respective scriptures bear wit- ness thereto; and their belief in his prophethood is derived from their belief in their own respective scriptures. As to the miracle of the Koran,22 its permanence, which is not essential as a reason for belief, is an additional advantage. Further, anyone endowed with a taste for eloquence will believe in the mirac- ulous character of the Koran, and do so as the eyewitness of a miracle and not merely as one who relies on hearsay. However, this is a stage not everyone can attain.B14 Should they say: All the nations bear witness to our prophet, therefore the transmission is stronger in his favor; how can you say then that it is weaker? We should say: Is the consensus of the nations' testimony [7a] true in your opinion? Should they say 'yes,' we say: But the nations whose evidence you have just accepted are unani- mous in declaring you unbelievers living in error; this is now bind- ing upon you inasmuch as their evidence is accepted by you. Should they say, 'we do not accept anybody's evidence,' they will be left only with the chain of transmission of their own community, which is the smallest community numerically, and their transmission and religion would, consequently, be the least sound. From the preceding, it follows that anyone who has performed miracles attested to by a chain of transmission is to be believed in his 22. The Koran is considered inimitable, perfect in eloquence, miraculous. The eloquence and style of the Koran are considered by Muslim theologians mirac- ulous in the sense that these properties of the Koran proved inimitable, whether because of intrinsic perfection, or as a result of divine intervention against those challenged by the Prophet to produce anything like the verses of his scripture. 43</page><page sequence="39">teaching. From this, it follows that the Jews must accept as true the prophethood of Jesus and of Muhammad - upon both of whom be peace. Section on what they tell of Jesus They assert that he was a scholar, not a prophet; that he used to heal the sick with medicines but made them believe that the improve- ment had set in through his prayer; that he healed a group of sick persons of their diseases on a Sabbath. When the Jews disapproved thereof, he said to them: Tell me, if a sheep of the fold fell into the well on a Saturday, would you not go down to it, thus permitting the breaking of the Sabbath rest to save the sheep? They said, 'cer- tainly.' He said: Then why do you violate the Sabbath to save cat- tle, but will not do so to save a human being who is more important than cattle? Thus he silenced them, but they believed not.28 They also tell about him that he was on a mountain with some of his disciples, and no food reached them, and he permitted them to gather herbs on the Sabbath. But the Jews disapproved of cut- ting herbs on the Sabbath.B1 He said to them: If one of you were with people not of his own faith and if they, without any intention of breaking the Sabbath, ordered him to cut a plant on the Sabbath and to throw it to their draft animals, would you not permit him to cut the plant? They said 'certainly.' Then he said: I ordered these men to cut the plant that they might eat it and nourish themselves; not that they might infringe upon the Sabbath. All this [was said] [7b] in a gentle attempt to treat their minds, which were not recep- tive to abrogation. Even if what they tell of this matter were true, it would perhaps refer to the beginning of the ministry of Jesus. 23. Cf. Matth. 12:1-12. 44</page><page sequence="40">An account of the verses and allusions referring in the Torah to the prophethood of our master Muhammad the Chosen - may God pray over him and grant him peaceB6 They cannot deny this verse from the second portion of the fifth book of the Torah:2 1pyov 1T5H JDi: onon" pn n^5 DppS KM=3 meaning: I will raise them up a prophet from among their brethren like unto thee; in him they shall believe.B7 This certainly is an allusion to the fact that they shall believe Muhammad. Should they say: The text has from among their brethren, and it is unusual for our Scripture to refer to non-Israelites as 'your brethren,' we would say: Ay, it says in the Torah 'your brethren the children of Esau,' namely in the first portion of the fifth book:25 4'Iyto Wo=ptl Ity Z rprm 555A Dwlply ms, meaning: Ye are to pass through the border of your brethren the children of Esau, that dwell in Seir; and do not covet any of their land.'8 Now if the children of Esau were brethren to the children of Is- rael because Esau and Israel were the sons of Isaac, then the chil- dren of Ishmael are likewise brethren to all the progeny of Abraham. Should they say that this passage refers rather to the prophet Samuel inasmuch as it says "from among their brethren like unto thee," and Samuel was like Moses insofar as he too was from amongst the children of Levi, i.e., of the same tribe as Moses,26 we might say: If so, then why did God have to enjoin you to believe in Samuel who, as you say, had nothing to add to or abrogate (in the Law)? Was he afraid you might reject him?B'9 [8a] For he was sent merely to strengthen your hands against the people of Palestine and to lead you back to the law of the Torah. 24. Confusion of Deut 18:15 and verse 18. The first part here is from verse 18, the second from verse 15 with its command unto him ye shall hearken. The verses belong to the fifth weekly portion in Deuteronomy. 25. Deut. 2:4; the concluding sentence is not a quotation from the text but a paraphrase of the foHowing verse: contend not with them; for I will not give you of their land, etc. 26. The argument recurs in the autobiography. 45</page><page sequence="41">You would be quick to believe a man of his description. And it might rather be feared that you would repudiate him who abrogates your religion and changes the rulings of your faith, and the injunction to believe in him might be indispensable for people like you. That is why Moses did not have to enjoin you to believe in the prophethood of Jeremiah, Isaiah, and the other prophets. This is proof that in this passage the Torah commanded them to believe in Muhammad - God's prayer and blessings upon him and his followers. The allusion to his name in the Torah God says in the third portion of the first book of the Torah ad- dressing Abraham, the friend of God [al-khalil]27 And as for Ish- mael, I have heard thee: behold I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful and will multiply him exceedingly.28 In the original: Mnl8 nnDnl 4 nl D n1n 111n 78ny 4 1 5INr1 45V iNn IN= ItnlK IniWl71 Now this word "exceedingly," bi-me'od me'od, if we compute the numerical value of its letters, will add up to ninety-two, which is also the numerical value of the letters in the name Muhammad. Yet in the present passage this was left enigmatic; had it been clear, the Jews might have changed it or omitted it from the Torah as they did elsewhere.B20 They might say that there are a number of words in the Torah with the numerical letter value equal to that of the names of Zayd, 'Amr, Khalid, and Bakr, but it does not follow that Zayd, 'Amr, Khalid, and Bakr are prophets. The answer to that is: It would be as they say if this verse were the mere equal of other Torah pas- sages; but we shall produce proofs and demonstrate that [8b] it is without equal in the rest of the Torah. Namely, no other verse of the Torah honors Ishmael as does this one, which is a divine promise to Abraham on how great will be the honor of Ishmael. Nor is there another verse in the Torah that refers to the glory of the tribe of a Zayd or 'Amr or Khalid or Bakr. We further stress that within this verse no other word equals bi-me'od me'od which means "exceeding- ly," it being a superlative used by God - praised be He - without 27. Koran 4:124. 2S. Gen. 17:29 in the fourth weekly section. (Hebrew and Arabic letters were used as figures to express numerals.) 46</page><page sequence="42">equal among the other words of the verse quoted. As this verse is the most superlative concerning Ishmael and his progeny, and this word the most superlative of all the words of the verse, it is not sur- prising it should contain an allusion to the most glorious and distin- guished of Ishmael's progeny [i.e. Muhammad] - God's prayer and blessing over him and his kin and companions. As we have shown that this word has no equal in the verse, nor this verse in the whole Torah, the Jews' objection is null and void. On the passage alluding to the prophethood of Moses, Jesus, and Muhammad 2 nnn3:m s5:nx K^ ?nn t mpt ,nn? nn sbn^K ::DD *nM ID ntn-p 4t"I n y= mlPr HTI 811X: This means: God will reveal himself from Sinai, His light will rise from Seir and will shine forth from the mountains of Paran, and with Him myriads of the holy.B2 They know that Mt. Seir is the mountain range Sharait? [9a] on which lived the children of Esau who believed in Jesus.38 Further, in this range was the abode of Christ - peace upon him. They know that Sinai is Mt. Tiir.B22 But they do not know that Mt. Paran is the mountain of Mecca. The allusion to these three places, which were the abodes of the ministry of these prophets, should im- pel the intelligent to inquire into the exposition of this passage which results in the command to follow the teaching of the prophets. Clear proof from the Torah that Mt. Paran is the mountain of Mecca is the fact that Ishmael, when he parted from his father Abra- ham, settled in the wilderness of Paran. The Torah tells about it thus: 82 aDn y1 PlHIt w^itS iDS 1? npnl 1Hs WCD: : i.e.: And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran; and his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt.B23 Thus the Torah states that 29.

The Hebrew is translated as follows: "The Lord came from Sinai, and rose from Seir unto them; He shined forth from Mount Paran, and he came from the myriads holy." 30. Sharat - the mountainous region of ancient Edom in Southern Palestine, adjoining the Gulf of Aqaba and forming the transition to the Arabian area. This is the biblical Seir, the land of Esau (Gen. 36:8, 20, 21; Deut. 2:5; Jo. 24:4). 31. Esau is called here al-'Is, and connected with the followers of 'Isa, i.e. Je. sus. Jews used to designate Christendom as Edom, and Islam as Ishmael. 32. Gen. 21:21. 47</page><page sequence="43">Mt. Paran is the abode of the people of Ishmael- If the Torah alluded in the previously quoted verse to prophecy coming from Mt. Paran, it follows that it is the prophecy unto the people of Ishmael, because it is they who are the dwellers of Paran. All will then see that the allusion to prophecy from the progeny of Ishmael points to Muham- mad, for it was he who was sent forth from Mecca, formerly the abode of Ishmael. This indicates that the mountains of Paran are those of Mecca, and that the Torah, in this passage, alluded to the mission of Muhammad and announced it; but the Jews, in ignorance and error, fail to connect these two verses. They admit the premises but, in their excessive ignorance, not the conclusion. The Torah bears witness to their poor understanding and counsel. Namely, in the passage3 nun il: 1rw m n nm y r "n * U ND meaning: For they are a nation void of counsel, and there is no un- derstanding in them.BU [9b] Refutation of their claim that God loves them They assert that God loves them above all men, and loves their community and race, and that the prophets and the saintly are se- lected by God only from their midst. But we shall dispute them thereon. We say to them: What have you to say about the prophet Job on whom be peace - do you recognize his prophethood?B2S They will say 'yes.' Then we say to them: Is he one of the children of Is- rael? They will say 'no.' We then say to them: What have you to say about the bulk of the children of Israel, namely the nine-and-a-half tribes seduced by Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who revolted against the son of Solo- mon the son of David and made the two calves of gold? Many of the Israelites, and all the people in the region of their capital then called Shomron, were bent on worshipping the golden calvess4 until a war took place between these Israelites and the two-and-a-half tribes that, headed by the son of Solomon in Jerusalem, were true 33. Deut. 32:28-9. 34. I Kins 12:23. Jeroboam's city was Shechem. Shomron-Samaria was found- ed later by Omri (ib. 16:24). In IK 11:31-32 Ahijah the Shilonite promises Jeroboam rule over ten tribes while one tribe (Judah) was to be left with the House of David. (Later notion in II Chron. 11:1) 48</page><page sequence="44">believers. And in one battle 500,000 men were slain.a3 What say you about all those lain and about the nine and a alf tribes - did God love them because they were Israelites? They will say: No, He did not, because they were infidels. Then we say to them: Is it not in your Torah that there be no difference in your religion between the stranger and the native? They will say: Certainly, for the Torah says about it:" 'n zD5 nnm m : n03 tR m :: meaning: The stranger and the native shall be equal before the Lord. Mzzli in n&amp;I:51 M5 1 nn IlnI ttot=t nnK mnin meaning: One law and one ordinance shall be both for you and for the stranger [10a] that sojourneth amidst you.B26 Once we force them to admit that God does not love the errant among them, but does love the believers outside their community and selects prophets and saints who are not of their race, they negate their claim that God's love is reserved specifically for their commu- nity, of all mankind. Section devoted to some aspects of their unbelief and falsification Men of scholarly attainments will shun vice and avoid what sound minds regard with disapproval, and what clear thinking is likely to declare spurious. But in this community of the Jews there are varie- ties of error and corruption that [sound] minds will shrink from, and that defy both human reason and divine law. Thus, despite the disappearance of their state, despite their dis- persion, and their recognition of the divine wrath extended over them, they still say each day in their prayers that they are God's chil- dren and beloved ones. Thus they say daily in the prayer:87 ln:'1S5 :*KH 12ninm nSly n3nlK meaning: Thou hast loved us with eternal love, 0 Lord our God, tn'lln5 lr4 13Inv, meaning: Return us, 0 our Father, to thy Law,8 meaning: O our Father, 0 our King, 0 our God, 35.

This comes from their poor minds and defective insight; for he who cares for a vineyard will place thorns on top of the walls in order [lOb] to protect and preserve the vineyard. But we do not find that the other nations harbored for the Jews anything but evil, humiliation, and contempt, and this disproves their assertion.B29 They expect a leader who will come of the house of David the prophet. When he moves his lips in prayer, all the other nations will die and only the Jews will remain. This expected one is, they con- tend, the Messiah they have been promised.40 But the prophets - peace upon them - coined for them para- bles pointing to the glory of the religion of Jesus, to the submission of the mighty to the people of his community, and to his declaration of the supreme abrogation. Such is the word of Isaiah in his prophecy:41 ,:ypln 1m1 m1 C,838!si 1: 1Drnw w ty: ry 3MY i13 ?In 5sw n?p= rpfim meaning: The wolf and the lamb shall all pasture and lie down to- gether, and the cow and the bear shall pasture together, and the lion shall eat straw like the ox.B30 But they understood only the sensory images of those parables, not their spiritual meaning, and turned away from believing in Je- sus at the time of his mission, continuing to wait for the lion to eat straw, that it might serve as a true sign of the Messiah's advent. They also believed that when this expected Messiah has come he will gather them all in Jerusalem, the sovereignty will be theirs, the world will be emptied of all others, and death will be kept from them for a long time. It is still their custom to follow the lions into their thickets and to throw straw in front of the lions to see just when they eat it. 39.

In this prayer they say also:BS' To God will belong dominion and on that day God will be one.43 They mean thereby that it will not be evident that dominion belongs to God unless the sovereignty passes to the Jews, His nation and choice; and so long as the govern- ment is in the hands of non-Jews, God is hardly known among the nations, His reign is defective, His power doubtful. This is the import of their saying, God, reign Thou over all the inhabitants of the earth, and the import of their saying, And the dominion will be unto God. Into the same category will fall their saying:44 meaning: Wherefore should the nations say: Where is now their God?B32 and their saying:45 Inrw )nr?p;n :nS 7Sn ?D5 nrmy meaning: Awake, why sleepest Thou, 0 Lord? Arouse Thyself from Thy slumber.B3 These people uttered such words of delirium and unbelief from the great vexation resulting from humiliation, enslavement, con- tempt and expectation of the ever-receding deliverance. This plunged them into irrationality and vexation and led them to a form of her- esy and delirium which only their incoherent minds could accept. Thus they became bold against God in these vile prayers, as if they were urging God to encourage them and protect Himself. For when they pray to their Lord in this way, they, as it were, inform Him that He has apparently chosen to be obscure and they urge Him to bestir Himself and become renowned. Thus one may see a Jew shuddering as he recites these words in the prayer, yet doubting not that his word will greatly impress God, and that he will influence his Lord, move Him, shake Him, challenge Him. In truth, the ig- norance and weak-mindedness of such people should be pitied.B34 42. From a section of the 'Amida for Rosh Hashana. 43.

True, their scholars, benefiting from the Muslim monotheism, have refined much of their ancestors' belief and have put such an interpretation upon their texts as will shield them from the Muslims' disapproval, even though it is not in accord with the words they interpret and translate. When asked about these shocking matters, they hide behind denial and falsehood in fear of the terrible infamy that may overtake them. For example, they ascribe to God - praised be He - regret for what He has done. Thus the Torah they possess says:48 153 SK 1ynnnl pr, trna n s rvy : tn n3l meaning: And the Lord regretted that He had made man on earth, and was grieved.B36 The compiler of the Targum went so far in his zealous partisan- slhip as to falsify the words, in violation of the usage of the language, and interpreted m w 'n. rnm 'r nrni as meaning: And God retracted in His view. Not only is this inter- pretation not in accord with usage, but it is also heretical; indeed it contradicts their rejection of sudden change in divine decision, or abrogation. The proof that 1; 5K nsyn4l means 'it grieved Him' is to be found in the words addressed to Eve:49 meaning: In pain thou shalt bring forth children.B? Thus it be- comes clear that sPY [12a] in the Hebrew language means grief or pain. This verse occurs, in their text, in the story of the people of Noah.50 They assert that God, when He saw the corruption of the 46. Ex. 24:10. 47. Ex. 31:18. 48. Gen. 6:6. 49. Gcn. 3:16. 52</page><page sequence="48">people of Noah and how their evil and unbelief had become great, regretted the creation of man, and it grieved Him. Fools that they are, they do not know that whosoever asserts this is obliged to con- clude that God, before He created man, was unaware of what would become of the people of Noah, and to draw other disparaging con- clusions. God is above all their unbelief. The text also has it that God said to the prophet Samuel:" 5nvw S6 155 56Kt n n Nn i * noru meaning: It repenteth Me that I have set up Saul to be king over Israel. In another passage in their scriptures it says: 5Snt 51y I K mt tn amm nl i.e.: and the Lord repented that He had made Saul king over Israel.

But the truth should be followed above all. And now we shall mention the true reason for the falsification of the Torah. [12b] Why the Torah was falsified None of their scholars or rabbis believes that the Torah in their pos- session is the one revealed to Moses. For Moses guarded the Torah from the children of Israel and did not divulge it to them, but deliv- 50.

Proof thereof is the Torah pas- sage:53 '17 sn) D3rinn w ,mn t nls n r,rnn nK rw o nmr meaning: And Moses wrote this law, and delivered it unto the priests, the sons of Levi.B89 The sons of Aaron were the judges and rulers of the Jews, for the priesthood, and the service of sacrifices and of the Temple were vested in them. Moses did not distribute any part of the Torah among the children of Israel other than half a chapter entitled Ha'a- zinu.54 This chapter of the Torah is the one that Moses taught the children of Israel. It says:55 5xntr' i= 1 mm52t n rn nrWn nK ws 3nun: meaning: So Moses wrote this song [the same day], and taught it to the children of Israel.B40 God also said to Moses concerning this chapter:56 SmkWr 4=1 Iy5 n*3r, 1,r 4I 5 rinvnl meaning: This song may be a witness for Me against the children of Israel.B4 Also, God said to Moses concerning this chapter:67 Dyn? Et n3tn i5 t meaning: For it shall not be forgotten out of the mouths of their seed.B2 He meant that this chapter contains a reproof of their char- acter, and that they would violate the laws of the Torah; that, sub- sequently, evil would befall them, their land would be destroyed, they would be dispersed over the earth. He said: This chapter will always be in their mouths i[3a] as a witness against them, certify- ing the truth of what had been said to them. As God said: Shall not be forgotten out of the mouths of their seed, this chapter indicates that God knew that the other chapters would be forgotten. This is also proof that Moses did not give the Israelites any of the Torah, other than this chapter.B43 As to the rest of the Torah, he gave it to the sons of Aaron, depositing it among them and keeping it away from all others. These Aaronid priests, who knew the Torah and had memorized most of it, were slain by Nebuchadnezzar in a massacre at the conquest of Jerusalem.B44 Memorizing the Torah was neither obligatory nor traditional, but 53.

When Ezra saw that the Temple of the people was destroyed by fire, that their state had disappeared, their masses dispersed and their book vanished, he col- lected some of his own remembrances and some still retained by the priests, and from these he concocted the Torah that the Jews now possess.B45 That is why they hold Ezra in such high esteem and claim that a light appears over his tomb, situated near the marshes of Iraq,B46 even unto the present day; for he has produced a book that preserves their religion. Now this Torah that they have is in truth a book by Ezra, and not a book of God. This shows that the person who collected the sections now in their possession was an empty man, ignorant of divine attributes. That is why he attributed anthropo- morphism to God - regret over His past actions and the promise of abstention from similar acts in the future, as is mentioned above. Also, one can argue against their interpretations, their extreme fanaticism, and the stress they lay on the burden [of the law], from what they say in interpreting the following verse:58 ink 2 nn n n: nt rn I ,nS n4 t3n Invns 4113 ntN [i3b] meaning: The first fruits of thy land thou shalt bring unto the house of the Lord thy God; Thou shalt not let a kid mature in its mother's milk.B47 What was intended thereby was that inasmuch as they had been commanded to perform the pilgrimage, they should take along, when setting out for the pilgrimage to Jerusalem, the first-born of their flocks and the first fruits of the produce of their land. For they had been enjoined earlier that the young of the cows and the sheep should remain with their mothers for seven days, and from the eighth day onward the young animals might serve as offerings to God.59 There- fore He hinted in the verse, "do not let a kid mature in its mother's milk" that the people should not protract the period during which the young of the flock remained with their mothers, but should take along on the pilgrimage to Jerusalem the first-born of the flock that had passed the seventh day since their birth so that the offerings might be selected from amongst them.60 The foolish scholars, trans- lating this passage and interpreting its content, took it into their heads that the legislator intended this "mature" to mean "seething" the cooked food in a pot. Suppose they are right in this interpreta- 58. Ex. 23:19. 59. Ex. 22:29. 60. Ex. 22:28. 55</page><page sequence="51">tion; it still would not follow from the prohibition of cooking that eating is prohibited, for if the legislator meant "eating" there was nothing to prevent him from dearly stating so. As if this error in word interpretation were not enough, they prohibited also the eat- ing of all other meats with milk. This could be additional proof of the ignorance of the commentators and translators, ascribing false- hoods to God and thereby increasing the burden of the community. As to the proof that tebashshel means maturity, i.e., reaching a cer- tain age, this can be found in the words of the chief butler to Joseph the righteous, whilst both were in prison, as the former described to the latter his dream. He said in the course of his words:61 nanl5rm K 15ltynn nwz nn5y nnlrrw m,n Dwrel j%Ww5 jon1 meaning: And in the vine were three branches; and as it was bud- ding, its blossoms shot forth, [14a] and the clusters thereof brought forth ripe grapes.B4 It has thus become clear that what is expressed by the word hibshilu is "reaching maturity." The intelligent man cannot consider it implausible that a whole community has agreed upon something absurd and accepted some kind of heresy and error. When the political independenceB49 of a nation is coming to an end through foreign domination and occupa- tion of its land, the true record of its past is obliterated, and the ves- tiges of its antiquity are blotted out and difficult to trace. For the political independence of a nation may come to an end through a succession of invasions and assaults, and through the devastation and partial scorching of the land. The succession of such events con- tinues until at last the learning of a nation is displaced by ignorance. The more ancient a nation is, and the more the various empires cxpose it to humiliation and grief, the more it is fated [to suffer] the obliteration of its records. This [Jewish] community is beyond doubt the one that has been exposed more than any other to the aforemen- tioned [evils], because it is one of the oldest of nations on record and because it has been ruled by a multitude of nations, such as the Chaldeans, Babylonians, Persians, Greeks, Christians, and Islam. And each of these nations was strongly bent on harming the Jews and extirpating them; intent on scorching and razing their country, and on burning their scriptures - all except the Muslims. Indeed, Islam came upon the Jews when they were under Per- sian rule and had no longer a polity or army, except for the Judaiz- ing Arabs in Khaybar. 61. Gcn. 40:10. 56</page><page sequence="52">But even more grievous to the Jews than al these empires was what befell them at the hands of their own rebellious kings such as Ahab, Ahaziah, Amaziah,62 Jehoram, Jeroboam b. Nebat and other kings of the Israelites, who slew the prophets, pursuing them relent- lessly in order to put them to death, who worshipped idols, who in- vited idol-worshipping priests from abroad to strengthen idolatry and to teach the ceremonies of its cult, and who built great sanctuaries and temples for these idols. [14b] The kings and the majority of the Israelites cleaved to this worship, and the precepts of the Torah and of religious legislation were abandoned for a long time, for century after century. If such was the succession of calamities that befell their religion at the hands of their own kings, and this of their own making, one is not surprised at the succession of the various disasters they were to suffer through foreign domination - the slaying of their priests, the burning of their scriptures, and the prohibiting of their observ- ance of the precepts of their law. Thus the Persians often prevented them from practicing circumcision and from praying, for they knew that most prayers of this community invoked ruin of the nations and destruction of the world, with the exception of their own land, which is the land of Canaan.B50 When the Jews saw that the Persians per- sisted in obstructing their prayer, they invented invocations into which they admixed passages from their prayers; and they called these hizana.B5l They set numerous tunes to them. They would assemble at prayer time in order to read and chant the hizana. The difference between the hizana and the prayer is that the prayer is without mel- ody and is read only by the person conducting the service; no other person recites along with him. The hazzan, however, is assisted by the public in reciting the hizana and in chanting melodies. When the Persians rebuked them for this, the Jews sometimes asserted that they were singing, and sometimes that they were bewailing their lot. So the Persians left them at it. Strangely enough, by the time the dominion of Islam arose and granted recognition to the various denominations of 'protected peo- ple,63 and prayer became permissible unto the Jews, the hizana had become a commendable tradition among them for holidays, festivals, and joyful occasions. Although no longer compelled to do so, the Jews were content to substitute hizana for prayer. 62. In II Kings 14:3 a righteous ruler. 63 Ahl al-dhimma tolerated (monotheistic) groups in Muslim states. 57</page><page sequence="53">Section on what they think about the religion of IslamB52 The Jews assert that Muhammad had dreams indicating that he was to be the head of a state; that [15a] he traveled to Syria on business of Khadija,64 met rabbis and told them his dreams, and that they recognized that he was to be the head of a state. Then they attached to him as companion, cAbdallah b. Salam,65 who instructed him for some time in scholarship and jurisprudence of the Torah.B58 They go so far in their claim as to ascribe the miraculous eloquence of the Koran to its compilation by cAbdallah b. Salam, and main- tain that it was he who stipulated in the marriage lawB54 that a wife, after her third divorce from her husband, shall not be permitted to re- wed him until she has been married and divorced from another man, the purpose being, in their contention, to make mamzerim of the chil- dren of the Muslims. This word is plural; its singular is mamzer. This is the term for an illegitimate child. For, in their law, if the hus- band takes back his wife after she has been married to another man, her children are considered illegitimate. Since abrogation is incon- ceivable to them, they conclude that this stipulation in the marriage law is an interpolation of cAbdallah b. Salam, by which he sought to turn Muslim children into what they consider mamzerim.66 But even more amazing is that they made the prophet David a mamzer in two respects, and they turned their Messiah into a mam- zer in two respects. For they do not doubt that David was the son of Jesse who was the son of Obed. This Obed's father was called Boaz, from the tribe of Judah; his mother's name was Ruth the Moabitess, of the children of Moab.67 This Moab's lineage is given in the text of the Torah in the following story. When God destroyed the people of Lot for its corruption, and only Lot with his two daughters es- caped, the daughters imagined that the earth had become empty of men by whom they might beget children. The elder daughter said to the younger:68 Our father is old, and not a man has remained upon earth to come to us after the manner of all mankind; come, let us make our father drink wine, and we wil lie with him that we may preserve seed by our father.B55 They did this, and it is asserted that they made that prophet drink wine until he became drunk and 64. Muhammad's employer, later his wife. 65. An early Jewish convert to Islam. 66. Cf. Koran 2:229-230. 67. Ruth 1:4. 68. Gen. 19:31. Lot is a prophet in Islamic lore, beginning with the Koran. 58</page><page sequence="54">did not know his daughters. Then he lay with them and the two con- eived, [15b] unrecognized by him. One of them bore a son whom she named Moab, meaning he is from the father; the other named her son Ben Ammi, meaning he was of her own tribe.69 These two chil- dren are necessarily mamzerim to the Jews, for they were born of a father and his two daughters. Should the Jews deny this, on the ground that the Torah had not yet been revealed,70 it would still follow. For they have it that when - in that same age - Abraham, the friend of God,71 feared that the Egyptians might kill him on ac- count of his wife, he concealed his marriage to her and said, She is my sister72 knowing that if he spoke thus, they would be safe from de- signs against them. This is proof that the prohibition against marrying one's sister had already been stipulated by that time. What shall one think then of marriage with one's daughter, which was not permis- sible even in the time of Adam? This story, referring to Lot the pro- phet, is in the Torah that the Jews possess, and they cannot deny it. It follows from this that the two persons they relate to Lot are mam- zerim for they were born [under conditions that were] contrary to the law. As Ruth was of the progeny of Moab, and the ancestiess of David and of their expected Messiah, the Jews have transformed both [David and the Messiah] into the progeny of a line whose le- gitinacy they malign.B5 Further, it is utterly absurd that an old man close to a hundred years of age should imbibe wine and become drunk to the extent of not recognizing his own daughters, that one of his two daughters should lie down with him, receive his sperm and get up, and he re- main unaware of it all, as it says in their scripture: n1Dipw n31= Ybr Mt1 meaning: He did not know when she lay down or when she rose.73 Such is the talk of a man who does not know how conception oc- curs.57 For it is impossible that a woman should conceive by a man so advanced in years and insensate through excessive drinking. What makes it utterly impossible is that they assert that his younger daugh- ter did the same with him [16a] the following night and also con- ceived. It is impossible in the case of a very old man that a woman 69. Ib., Verse 36. 70. The well-known talmudic pattern to explain certain scriptural difficulties. 71. Koran 4:124 (125): "God took Abraham as a friend." Biblical prototype II Chron. 20:7. 72. Gen. 12:10-20. 73.

But the endless animosity be- tween the Ammonites and Moabites, on the one hand, and the Is- raelites on the other hand, induced the compiler of this section to con- coct this absurdity so that it might be a most vilifying report about the Ammonites and Moabites. Further, they have it that Moses vested the Aaronids with the priesthood. When Saul74 became king, his rule was felt oppressive by the Aaronids, and he massacred many of them,76 and later, power passed to David.B8 Yet in the hearts of the Aaronids there remained the lust for the power they had lost. Now this Ezra was a scribe in the service of the King of Persia. He made representations for the rebuilding of Jerusalem and compiled for the Jews the Torah which is in their possession. As he was an Aaronid, he was averse to a Da- vidid reigning over them in the second commonwealth. So he added in the Torah two sections derogatory of the lineage of David: one is the story of the daughters of Lot, the other the story of Tamar, to be mentioned below. By my life, he achieved his purpose: for in the second common- wealth which they had in Jerusalem it was not the Davidids who were their kings but the Aaronids.3 This Ezra is not al-cUzayr7T as people think.B60 For al-cUzayr is the Arabic for Elazar (Eliezer).77 [But] the name Ezra would not change in translation to Arabic at all for it is a name whose vowels and consonants fit [the Arabic]. Nor is Ezra counted a prophet by the Jews, but called hassofer mean- ing "scribe." Also they have in the Torah a stranger story still, as follows: Judah, the son of the prophet Jacob, married his eldest son to a woman by the name of Tamar.78 The son used to come to his wife ex partes posteriores, so God was angry with his deed and slew him. Then Judah married Tamar to his other son. It came to pass that when the son went in unto her [16b] he spilled the seed on the ground, in the knowledge that, should she bear children, the first son would be called by his brother's name and thus be related to his brother. This 74. lHere TIalt as in the Koran 2:248, 250. 75. I Sam. 22:16-20. 76. Koran 9:30. The Jews said: 'Uzayr is the son of God.

Gen. 15:2. 78 Gen. 38:10. 60</page><page sequence="56">act displeased God, and He slew him also. Then Judah ordered Ta- mar to rejoin her family until his son Shelah was grown and of ma- ture mind, for Judah feared that what had befallen Shelah's two brothers might befall Shelah, too. Accordingly, she lived in her fa- ther's house. Later Judah's wife died, and he went up to a station called Timnah to shear his sheep. When Tamar was told of her fa- ther-in-law's journey to Timnah, she put on the garment of the har- lots, and, knowing his character, sat on an elevated spot on his road. As he passed by her, he took her for a harlot; he enticed her, and she asked for the wage. He promised her a kid, and he pledged with her his staff and signet, and came in unto her. Consequently, she con- ceived by him Perez and Zerah. From the line of this Perez came Boaz who married Ruth, of Moabite descent, and from them the prophet David was descended.B6 Furthermore, this story has a fine point that would make abroga- tion necessary. Namely, when Judah was informed that his daugh- ter-in-law had conceived in harlotry, he ruled that she be burned.79 Then she sent him his signet and staff, saying: I am with child by the man to whom these belong.80 He then said:B62 She is more in the right than I.81 He excused himself on the grounds that he had not recognized her, and that he did not visit her again. This indi- cates that the law of that time stipulated the burning of harlots, which the Torah abrogated by prescribing stoning.B68 In this story they also ascribe fornication and unbelief to the prophetic line, even as they ascribed them to the prophet Lot. All this is found in the text of their Scripture. They make this the genealogy of David, Solomon, and the Messiah they expect. Yet they maintain that the Muslims deserve this by-name (mamzerim) more tftan their Messiah. The absurdity of this assertion is most clear and evident. [17a3 As to their rejection of the Koran's inimitable eloquence, I do not wonder at this, for they do not know Arabic sufficiently to dis- tinguish eloquence from stammering; that, despite their long so- journ amongst the Muslims.64 They argue further against Muslims and say: How can a book that contradicts itself - meaning thereby, abrogates itself - be as- cribed to God?B65 We say to them: We have already pointed to the 79. Gen. 38:24. 80. Ib. v. 25. 81. Gen. 38:25-26. 61</page><page sequence="57">affirmation of the permissibility thereof in the beginning of the pres- ent discourse; but as to your surprise thereat and your loathing of it -- well, your own Scripture is not free from similar difficulties. Should they deny that, we would say to them: What say you about the Sabbath? Which is the earlier precept: the Sabbath or the great fast [the Day of Atonement]? They will say: The Sabbath is older. For, should they say the great fast is older, we would give them the lie, for the precept of the Sabbath was enjoined upon them follow- ing the gift of the manna, whilst the great fast was stipulated after the revelation of the two tablets and after the disobedience and calf- worshipping of the Jews.82 When the punishment for that sin was lifted, fasting on, and solemn observance of, that day was stipulated. But should they admit the precedence of Sabbath we would say to them: What say you concerning the Sabbath, are you obliged to observe rest and quiet, and are or are not exertions forbidden on that day? They will say: Yes, certainly. Then we say to them: But why are you obliged to observe the great fast when it happens to fall on a Sabbath, even though your fast became an obligation later than the precept of Sabbath observance, and despite the fact that you suffer on the day of that fast various discomforts, such as standing all the day long? Is not this, too, an abrogation of the precept of Sabbath observance? As to our master, the Messenger of God - may God pray over him and bless him - only two names for him are current among the Jews - may they be accursed by God, the angels, and all men. One of the names is pasul meaning "vile," [17b] the other meshuggac meaning "madman." As to the glorious Koran, they call it Qalon which in their tongue is a name for turpitude; they mean thereby that it is a disgrace of the Muslims.B66 Through this and similar acts, they became most violent in enmity against those who have be- lieved.88 How, then, will God and men not curse them?4 Section demonstrating some of their ignominy One of the disgraceful things in their religion is the procedure of yebama and halus. Namely they were commanded85 that if 82. Ex. 16:23, Lev. 23:27-32. 83. After Koran 5:85. 84. After Koran 2:154. 85. Deut 25:5-10. 62</page><page sequence="58">two brothers dwelt in one place, and one of them died with- out leaving a child, the widow should not marry a stranger; her fa- ther-in-law's son shall marry her, and the first child she will bear by him shall be attributed to his deceased brother. If he refuses to mar- ry her, she goes forth complaining of him to the elders of her people saying: My husband's brother refuseth to raise up unto his brother a name in Israel and does not wish to marry me. The judge there will summon him and will oblige him to stand up and say: nnnp^ nsen 85 meaning: I like not to take her.B6 The woman then will seize his shoe, take it off his foot, hold it in her hand, spit in his face, and exclaim over him: 14nH n4Z n; n,^ s t tt v ry n,o meaning: So shall it be done unto the man who doth not build up his brother's house.B68 After which he will be branded the unshod86 and his family will be reviled by that appellation, i.e., the house of him who had his shoe loosed. All this is imposed upon them by the Torah, but therein is a ruse that forces the man to marry his de- ceased brother's wife. Since the man knows that the woman is obliged to summon him to her people's assembly, he may be induced to mar- ry her. Even if his sense of shame should not deter him, he may, when summoned, be hesitant to say: I like not to take her. If still unashamed, [18a] he may recoil in shame from being dishonoured by the unshoeing, by having the woman remove his shoe, spit in his face, and proclaim him a failure, a man lacking in virtue. Even if he can face this, he may yet dread being reviled by the appellation that will attach to him and his kin after him with shame and bad renown; and this may force him to marry her. But if he is repelled by her to such an extent that all this will appear trivial to him, the law will separate the two. There is nothing in the Torah beyond that. But what their legists deduced from this is truly their shame and disgrace. Namely, if the woman is averse to marrying the brother of her de- ceased husband, they force him to waive his right to her. Yet they oblige her to appear before the judge in session with their rabbis, and they teach her to say:87 meaning: My husband's brother refuseth to raise up unto his broth- er a name in Israel; he will not marry me."B Thus they force her to 86. Deut. 25:10. 87. lb. v. 7. 63</page><page sequence="59">le against him; for he did wish to marry her, and she it was who withdrew, whilst he was willing. By teaching her these words, they instruct her to lie. They summon him and instruct him to rise and say.88 rnnrnp5 nrn K' meaning: I like not to take her. Even though she may be his wish and desire, they order him to lie. When she dishonours him and spits in his face, it is the acme of transgression for, not content with the untruths against him, they compel him to lie and thus expose him to punishment for a sin he did not commit.B70 Just as the poet said: Many a sin is committed by the fools of a people, Yet chastisement is meted out to other than those who committed it.89 Account of the cause for their increasing the burden upon themselvesB7 There are two causes for their making their burden even heavier. One of them stems from their legists called hakhamim. This word means sages. [18b] The Jews in ancient times used to call their legists "sages" They had academies in Syria and Mesopotamia, during the rule of the Babylonians, Persians, Greeks, and Romans, where thousands studied the sacred law until material was accumulated from which the legists decided to compile the two works, namely, the Mishna and the Talmud. The Mishna, the smaller book, consists of about eight hundred sheets; the Talmud, the larger book, has the weight of about half of the burden of a mule. The legists who wrote it did not all live in one and the same age; they continued to compile it genera- tion after generation. When the later legists, scrutinizing this com- pilation, noticed that the additions to it contained contradictions to the earlier sections of the work, they realized that, unless further ad- ditions were prohibited, obvious disorder and gross contradiction would result. They therefore ceased adding to the Talmud, barred any further additions, and forbade the legists to add or affix any- thing to it; in fact, they excommunicatedB72 anyone who added any- thing to it And thus its size was set. In these two books the spiritual leaders of the Jews forbade them to partake of food in the company of strangers, that is, with those 88b.Ib. v. 8. 89. Mutanabbi II 546 N. 225 line 26. (ed. Dieterici) 64</page><page sequence="60">not of their persuasion, and made it unlawful for them to eat the meat of animals slaughtered by men not of their faith. For they, i.e., the scholars and spiritual leaders, realized that their religion would not be preserved in the state of exile in which the Jews lived in humiliation and subjection, unless the scholars could keep them from mingling with people of other religions; consequently, they forbade marriage with non-Jews and the eating of the meat of animals slaughtered by non-Jews. The scholars could not have gone so far in this respect had they not concocted an argument which in reality calumniates God. For [19a] the Torah merely prohibited marriage of Jews with non- Jews lest the Jews should follow their wives in idol-worship and un- belief in God.90 Furthermore, in the Torah the Jews are forbidden to eat of the meat of animals slaughtered by those who offer sacri- fices to idols because a name other than that of God was invoked at the slaughter. But animals not slaughtered as idol-offerings were not forbidden in the Torah; rather, the Torah speaks of the permissi- bility of taking food from persons of other nations. Thus God said to Moses at the time the Hebrews passed through the land of the children of Esau:73 VI r1I3 ny rln )Tr InV 5 ^ pi lnn K) meaning: Contend not with them; for I will not give you of their land, no, not even so much as the sole of the foot would tread on;91 onanrvl qpI: Pnso lnn wn P1 I n=tm : D3I tnS: nnfcyn 5zm meaning: Ye shall purchase food of them for money, that ye may eat; and ye shall also buy water of them for money, that ye may drink.92 Thus it is clear from the text of the Torah that the Jews are per- mitted to take food from other peoples, and eat it. They know that the children of Esau were idol-worshippers and infidels. Now the Muslims, for example, are not lower in rank than the children of Esau. Therefore, the Jews should accept the food of the Muslims; ray, they should prefer it, since the Muslims, because of their mono- theism and their faith, are not idol-worshippers. True, Moses for- bade the Jews to marry idol-worshippers or to eat the meat of ani- mals slaughtered in the name of idols; but we do not know of a single Muslim who invokes the name of an idol or image at the slaughter- 90. Ex. ."4:16; Nu. 25:1-3. 91. Dent. 2:5. 92. Ib. 2 i. 65</page><page sequence="61">ing of an animal. What is the matter with these Jews, then, that they do not eat of animals slaughtered by Muslims? What is the matter with the Jews who live in Syria and Persia that they will not accept from the Muslims such food as milk, cheese, sweetmeats, bread, et cetera? [19b] If they say: That is because the Torah forbade us to eat terefa; we say to them: 'erefa is the prey torn by the lion or wolf or other wild beast. Proof thereof is the Torah verse:98 nir z'frn 5:)5 i5zKn 10 ,Dtv n 1t13 nz1 meaning: Ye shall not eat any flesh that is torn of beasts in the field; ye shall cast it to the dogs.B74 When the leaders saw that the Torah makes no mention of a prohibition against the foods of the gentiles - except the idol-wor- shippers - and that the Torah clearly states that the prohibition against eating together and mingling with non-Jews stems from the fear lest this should gradually lead to intermarriage, which is ob- jectionable lest it be followed by conversion to the religions and idol- worship of the gentiles - all of which is clearly stated in the Torah -they invented a book entitled lnttrT nrl' meaning the science of (animal-) slaughter. In this book, they imposed upon the Jews an increased burden that distracts them from their position of humi- liation and affliction.B7 Thus they ordered the Jews to blow into the lung of the animal until it is filled with air, and then observe whether the air is escaping through some aperture. If it is, they declare the meat unlawful. If some section of the lung adheres to another, they do not eat the meat of that animal. The inspector of the slaughter is also instructed to put his hand into the slaughtered animal's belly in order to determine with his finger whether the heart is attached to the back or to one of the sides; should there be an adhesion by a vein, though it be as fine as a hair, they declare the meat un- lawful, do not eat thereof, and call it terefa, meaning unclean. This designation is the first transgression [20a] on the part of the scholars, because in Hebrew usage terefa refers merely to prey killed by some beast. Proof thereof is found in what Jacob says when Joseph's shirt, soiled with blood, is brought to him:94 qOl 4 qit ,l',inrt n Iln rOwn : ,r4 c n3nn Intin n7rn1 meaning: He recognized it and said: my son's tunic! a wild beast has devoured him! Joseph has been mauled by a beast!BT Thus it 93. Ex. 22:30. 94. Gen. 37:33. 66</page><page sequence="62">becomes clear that the sense of rDl 1't Pl I '1 is that Joseph was torn to pieces by a beast of prey, and terefa is the prey. Another proof thereof is that it says in the Scriptures: Ye shall not eat any flesh that is torn by beasts in the field." Prey of beasts is always to be found in the desert; and there is nothing surprising in the fact that the prohibition against eating this prey was revealed to a people of tent-dwellers, living in the desert. For they spent fully forty years wandering in desert and in wilderness, most of this time finding no food other than manna. When their lust for meat grew, Moses brought them quails. The quail (salwg) is a small bird sim- ilar to the sumana. Its specific quality is that the eating of its meat softens the wicked heart, and eliminates conceit and cruelty. Indeed, this bird dies if it hears the sound of thunder, just as the swallow is destroyed by cold. God causes the quail to dwell on islands devoid of rain and thunder until the rainy season is past, after which the bird leaves the islands and spreads over the earth.B77 God brought this bird to the Hebrews that they might benefit from the specific quality of its flesh, namely, the softening of wicked hearts. The He- brews' lust for meat had grown to such an extent that nothing less than a revealed Torah prohibition could restrain them from eating beasts' prey and carcasses. So the transgression of their elders in in- terpreting terefa becomes clear, [20b] since merely "beasts' prey" is meant. But the legists invented absurdities and nonsense connected with the lung and heart [of a slaughtered animal]. They said that a slaughtered animal if found fit under these conditions is dakhya meaning clean; if it does not satisfy these conditions, it is terefa meaning unlawftl. They said that the significance of the Torah verse: Ye shall not eat any flesh that is torn by beasts in the field; you shall cast it to the dogs, is that if you slaughter an animal and it does not satisfy these conditions - do not eat of it. but sell it to the gentiles. Thus they interpret "cast it to the dogs" to mean "to a person not of your persuasion; feed it to him, sell it to him." But, ir. truth, it is they who are like dogs, deserving this appellation and analogy on account of their mental turpitude, and their evil thoughts and beliefs concerning other nations.B78 The Jews are of two sects. One of them, the Karaites, recognizes that those early authorities who compiled the Mishna and the Tal- mud, i.e., the Jewish legists, are a pack of calumniators of God and 95. Ex. 22:30. 67</page><page sequence="63">of the prophet Moses; and that they are men of appalling stupidity and unsound mind. Thus, on questions concerning their law and religion, the legists usually differ from one another. Yet the Jews assert that the legists, even when disagreeing with one another on each of these questions, were inspired by God, all of them hearing Him say: In this question, legist so and so is right. This voice they call bath qol. When the Karaite Jews, disciples of cAnan and Benja- min,96 saw these infamous absurdities, this disgraceful forgery, and silly lie, they seceded from the legists and all those who followed them. They repudiated all of these impious fabrications. Having es- tablished [21a] the deception of the legists with their false claim to prophethood and their assertion that God has been inspiring them all several times a day, the Karaites decided that the legists had strayed from the right course, and that none of their tenets should be ac- cepted. Consequently, they opposed the deceitful legists in all other matters which the text of the Torah did not mention. The Karaites ate meat with milk and forbade only the flesh of the young kid in its mother's milk, out of deference to the text of the verse: Thou shalt not seethe a kid in its mother's milk. As for the absurdities by the "sages" - or legists - which they entitled hilkhath shehita, i.e., the science of animal slaughter, these are legal problems systematized by the legists, which the Karaites dismissed and voided, along with many other things. They desisted from declaring unlawful any ani- mal slaughtered by themselves. Such is the position of this group of Jews, i.e., the Karaites. They have legists of their own, too, who are authors of books, but do not go so far in calumniating God as to caim prophethood; nor do they ascribe their interpretations to prophetic inspiration, or to God, but merely to their own effort (ijtihd) .B79 The other sect is called the Rabbanites. They are more numerous. They are followers of the "sages" - the legists who calumniate God and who assert that on every problem God was wont to address them through the voice they call bath qol. Among the Jews, this group is the most harsh in its animosity toward other nations. These God- calumniating legists made the Jews believe that food and drink be- come lawful for man through the application of this "science" which they ascribe to Moses and to God; that the other nations do not know it, and that only the Jews have been so honoured by God through 96. Anan b. David, the VIII cent. Karaite teacher. Benjamin Nahiwandi, the IXc. Karaite master. 68</page><page sequence="64">this and similar absurdities, with which the legists have corrupted the minds of the Jews. A Jew will look upon someone not [21b] of his own faith as one would look upon some animal devoid of intelligence; and regard the foods eaten by the gentiles as a sensible man would regard dung, or the pus of the dead, and similar filth that is unfit as food for any human. This is the root of the community's persever- ance in its religious laws, its strict segregation front other nations, and its utterly scornful and contemptuous view of the rest of mankind. As for the first group, the Karaites, most of them were little by little converted to Islam, so that only a few of them are left. Since the Karaites are free from the absurdities of the Rabbanite legists, those persistent fabricators who aggravated the burden of their com- munity, they are better prepared to emblDrace Islam.?' From what we have mentioned, it becomes clear that the "sages" are those who imposed their law upon this group, making livelihood more difficult and the burden heavier. They sought thereby to pit the Jews ever more against the religions of the gentiles lest thev mingle with the gentiles and thus be led to the abandonment of their religion. The second cause for the oppressiveness of their burden is that the Jews are dispersed both to the East and to the West. In any town harbouring a community of Jews there may appear fromi a distant land a man of their faith who displays religious strictness, ex- treme piety, and meticulous observance. If he happens to be trained theologically, he will start to rebuke them for certain prac- tices, giving an impression of superiority. He will accuse them of de- fective observance. He will ascribe the substance of his rebuke to his masters and to his townsmen, and his references for the most part will be false. In this way, he hopes to achieve leadership or some other goal, especially if he intends to remain with or be influential among them. So you may see him, upon his arrival, refraining from partaking of their food [22a] and of the meat of their slaughter; exam- ining the knife of their slaughterer, whom he will reprove for some- thing or other, saying: I shall not eat except of my own slaughter. You may see them vexed by him, while he continues to blame them for what is lawful and pennissible, suggesting that these things be prohibited on the strength of his fabricated references until their doubts are dispelled. Should, after a long interval, a countryman of his arrive, who knows how false are those references to authorities, the newcomer 69</page><page sequence="65">may either agree with him or oppose him. In the former case, the newcomer will agree in order to share in the spiritual leadership achieved by his countryman and out of fear lest he, in opposing the leader, be denounced as a liar or accused of a lack of piety. Moreover, the newcomer in most cases will approve of what the first one has sought to institute, i.e., declaring lawful things unlaw- ful and disapproving of permissible things, and will say: May God greatly reward so and so, for he has strengthened the authoriry of the faith in the hearts of this community, and has repaired the fence of the lawB81 amidst them. Should he meet the other alone, he will thank him and bless him, or say to him: God has made you the pride of our fellow townsmen. However, should the newcomer defy what the first has instituted, i.e., his censure and oppression, not one in the community would sympathize with him, or trust him. Nay, all of them would think he is not pious enough, for these people are convinced that narrowing the scope of livelihood and prohibiting things unlawful is a sign of extreme piety and asceticism, and they invariably believe that religion and truth are with him who makes things more difficult for them. They do not stop to consider whether he does or does not produce any proof, nor do they investigate whether he is right or wrong. Such is the case of a theologically- trained newcomer in a town. Should the newcomer happen to be a rabbi - a Jewish scholar -he would institute a strange religious regime and introduce new customs with added precepts imposed, yet no one can raise an objec- tion. They surrender to him completely, while he cleverly milks them [22b] and filches away their money. Should he lear that some young Jew sat alongside the road on a Sabbath, or bought milk or wine from a Muslim, the rabbi would rebuke and curse the fellow at a gathering of the town's Jews, would disparage him, and ascribe it all to religious slackness.B82 This reason and the reason mentioned above are the cause of the increased oppressiveness of the burden the Jews have imposed upon themselves, of the narrowing scope of their livelihood, and of their abstention from the food of other people and from mingling with those not of their own community. We have carified these for the reflective reader 70</page><page sequence="66">EPILOGUE He most deserves to be described as ignorant and branded as errant, whose nature defies the pursuit of the verities, and whose mind is far from perceiving the ultimate truth. But his station is even more miserable, who not only resists admitting the verities, but is also quick to accept the absurd and to believe the impossible, so that he deserves to be characterized as insane and degenerate. The group under consideration is most deserving of such a characteriza- tion, for although their ancestors daily witnessed sensorial miracles and heavenly fire as no other people did, yet they repeatedly plot- ted the stoning of Moses and Aaron. It is enough to mention that they chose the golden calf in the days of Moses; preferred to return to Egypt into slavery in order to sate themselves with flesh, onion, and cucumber; worshipped idols after the time of Joshua b. Nun; and joined Absalom, the refractory son of David by the daughter of the King of Geshur.83 The overwhelming majority joined this rebel- lious and refractory son, and waged war at his side against David, the great king and noble prophet of God. Then, when they shifted their allegiance back to David,97 their delegations and troops began streaming to him, asking to be forgiven for what they had perpe- trated, [23a] and rejoicing in the safety of King David. Their eagerness was so intense that the tribes picked a quarrel with the tribe of Judah when, in a fervent race for precedence in the service of the king, it crossed the Jordan with its king before the arrival of the troops of the other tribes. Mild rebukes were exchanged, and thei, the tribe of Judah said: We are m.ore entitled than others to hasten to the king and be eminent in his service because he is near of kin to us, and you have no reason to blame us, 0 children of Is- rael. Then a base fellow arose, Sheba the son of Bichri,98 and called at the top of his voice: We have no portion in David, neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse, every man to his tent, 0 Israel. No sooner said than the army of the children of Israel seceded from David in answer to that base fellow's call. But when the vizier Joab succeeded in slaying the mischief-maker, all the troops returned their 97. 1I Sam. 19:41-44.

The people were like ruffians, a vulgar rabble who rally to drum-beating only to be dispersed by a yell. As for their worship of the two calves,99 their abandonment of tie pilgrimage to Jerusalem, and their persistent opposition to the prophets down to the very end of their kingdom - all this is not what one would expect from people in their right minds. It is their way to follow another nation only in its vices. Such is their ignominy and shame.?00 As to their being quick to accept the absurd and incredible, we shall cite an instance illustiative of their lack of intelligence, namely what happened in our own time to the cleverest, shrewdest, and craft- iest among them, the Jews of Baghdad.B84 An impostor arose in the region of Mosul, a young Jew named Menahem b. Sulayman and known as Ibn ar-Ruhi. He was a man of fine appearance. By the standards of the rank and file of Jews dwelling in the district known as Arnadia in the country [ruled from] Mosul, he was well-versed in their religion. The commrander of a fortress thre \was so kindly disposed toward this impostor, of vwhomn he had formed a go. ::l opii-- ion and whose [23b1 feigned piet impressed him, that he used to look forward to visiting this :lan. The impostor coveted the place of the governor, whom he considered a sitmplcton, and ir;agined that he would be able to pounce upon the fortress and take it over, that it might become his fortified stronghold. So he wrote to the Jews who dwelled in the rvariosis districts of th:e tointrv of Adharb;vin a nd tlhe adjacent territory, knowing as he did that the Persian Jews are the most ignorant of all Jews. In his writings he mentioned that he was a leader'85 zealous to free the Jews froml the hands of the Musli:s, and he addressed the Jews with various ruses and deceptions. Pas- sages of his writings which I saw were to this effect: "Perhaps you will say - what has he rallied us for, is it war or battle? No. we want you not for war or battle but that you might stand before this leader, to be seen at his gates by the royal envoys who surrolnd him." Toward the end of the writings: "It behooves each of you to have a sword or other instrument of war and to conceal it under your garments." 99 . T. atc of . old, which Jeroboam made in Nablus, and their turning to the (worship of the) two calves. 100. The text has: The) will not come near the disgrace of any other nation. This does not seem to make sense. Apparently the opposite sense is required, qiven in the translation. 72</page><page sequence="68">The Persian Jews, and the people186 of the environs of Amadia and of the region of Mosul, responded. They flocked to him with concealed weapons until a vast number of them had gathered about him. The governor, because of his good opinion of him, thought that the people were mere pilgrims visiting the alleged sage who had appeared in his town; so it was, until their ambitions were disclosed to him. He was too forebearing to shed blood; he therefore killed only the trouble-making impostor. The rest of them dispersed in dismay, after suffering the evil results of affliction, privation, and destitution. This story, though clear to every sensible person, was not plain enough for them. Nay, to this day they, I mean the Jews of Amadia, prefer him [the impostor] to many of their prophets. Some of them believe he is the expected Messiah himself. I saw groups of Persian Jews in Khoy, Silmas, Tabriz, and Maragha [24a] who used his name for their gravest oath. As for the Jews of Amadia they became, in all their practices, more segregated from and opposed to the Jews than the Christians. In that region there is a group that professes a religion which it relates to the above-mentioned impostor, Mena- hem. B7 When the report about him reached Baghdad, two Jewish trick- sters, cunning elders, decided to forge letters by Menahem to the Jews of Baghdad bringing them the good tidings which they had been expecting since of yore; that he would appoint for them a certain night in which all of them would fly to Jerusalem. The Jews of Baghdad, their claim to sagacity and pride in craftiness notwith- standing, were all led to believe it.88 Their women brought their moneys and jewels in order that it all might be distributed, on their behalf, as charity to those whom the two elders considered deserv- ing. In this manner the Jews spent the bulk of their wealth. They donned green garments,B9 and on that night gathered on the roofs expecting, they asserted, to fly to Jerusalem on the wings of angels. Women began to weep over their nursing infants. What if the mcthers should fly before their children or the children before their mothers? The children might suffer hunger because of the delay in feeding. At the time, the Muslims there marveled so greatly at what had befallen the Jews that they refrained from opposing them until the result of the Jews' vain expectations had come to light.B90 The Jews kept crowding together for the flight until the morning dis- closed their frustration and ignominy. But those two deceivers es- 73</page><page sequence="69">caped with whatever they had appropriated of the Jews' wealth. Sub- sequently, the Jews realized the nature of the trick and how they had been fooled.B91 Then they named that year "the year of the flight" and began to reckon the years of their old and young as from that year: it is the era of the Jews of Baghdad at the present time. This affair should suffice to cast shame and disgrace upon them forever. [24b] What we have listed is fully adequate to achieve the pur- pose of silencing them and mllzling them with their very own data. In God do I seek refuge and safety from their polytheism. 74</page><page sequence="70">THE CONVERSION TO ISLAM OF SAMAU'AL IBN YAIYA AL-MAGHRIBI and the narrative of his vision of the Prophet, upon whom God's prayer and blessing in the night of cArafa in the year 558.101 There is no God but God upon whom I rely.'02 Said Samau'al, after praise to God and prayer for his prophet Muhammad, the God-chosen, and his kin. Divine Providence leads a man, who through God's knowledge is predestined to be rightly guided, until he finds the right course at the exact time which God in His knowledge has set in advance. I shall relate God's guidance granted to me, and how I was led since my birth from the faith of the Jews toward my conversion, that it may become an example and an exhortation to whomsoever this may ieach. The reader shall know that divine kindness is so concealed as to be unfathomable. God will select whomsoever He wishes, will grant wisdom to whomsoever He wants, and will lead him along the straight path.'03 [25a] My father was called Rab Yehuda Ibn Abun and was of the city of Fas in Morocco; Rab being a title, not a name, and its mean- ing - a Rabbi. He was the most learned man of his time in Torah studies, and the most gifted and prolific stylist and exquisite extem- porizer in Hebrew poetry and prose. Among the Arabic-speaking peo- ple he was known as Abi-l-Baqa' Yahya ibn cAbbas al-Maghri- bi. For most of the distinguished people among the Jews have an Arabic name distinct or derived from the Hebrew name, even as the Arabs who have name and surname'04 separately. He married my mother in Baghdad. She came from Basra and was one of three distinguished sistersB92 well-versed in Torah studies and Hebrew writing, daughters of Ishaq Ibn Ibrahim al-BaSri al- Lewi, i.e. of the tribe of Levi, a tribe of good lineage, for Moses 101. Nov. 8, 1163. The vision occurred on Thursday night; the conversion took place on Friday. 102. After Koran 9:130. 103. A frequent Koran image. 104. An Arabic name may include, apart from the name proper (ism), a sur- name of relationship (kunya) and a surname (laqab). In this case Rab is the laqab, Abi-l-Baqa' the kunya. The latter is not an indication of relationship prop- er (father of .. ) in this case but an appellation - the long lived. 75</page><page sequence="71">sprang from it. This Ishaq was a man of learning and taught in Baghdad. Their mother was Nafisa, the daughter of Abii Na~r al- Dawudi, one of their well-known dignitaries whose progeny still dwell in Egypt to this day. My mother was named after the mother of the Prophet Samuel. This prophet was born after his mother had been barren, childless, and had not conceived for a number of years, not until she prayed to the Lord requesting a son who would become a devotee of God. A pious man, a spiritual leader by the name of Eli, blessed her, and she gave birth to Samuel the prophet. All this is described in the beginning of the Book of the Prophet Samuel. Now my mother had been with my father for some time, childless, until she was filled with fear of her barrenness, and saw a dream in which she was reciting the prayer of Hannah, mother of Samuel, to the Lord. She then vowed that if she had a son she would name him Samuel, as her name was the name of Samuel's mother. It came to pass that after that she con- ceived [25b] and I was born; she called me Samuel, which in Arabic is Samau'al. My father called me Abi Nasr which was the Kunya of my grandfather.93 My father had me learn Hebrew writing, and then study the Torah and the commentaries until, by the age of thirteen, I had mas- tered this knowledge. Then he introduced me to the study of Indian reckoningM4 and the solution of equations under Shaykh Abfi-l-Ha- san Ibn ad-Daskari,BS9 and the study of medicine under the philos- opher Abu 'l-Barakat Hibat-Allah Ibn cAli,B96 and the observation of current surgical operations and the treatment of diseases as prac- ticed by my maternal uncle Abi-l-Fath Ibn al-Basri. As to Indian reckoning and astronomical tables, I mastered them in less than a year, by the age of fourteen, and at the same time continued to study medicine and to observe the treatment of diseases. Then I studied ad- ministrative accounting'05 and the science of surveying under Shaykh Abii-l-Muzaffar ash-Shahrazuri,B97 as well as algebra and equations also under him and the katibl06 Ibn Abi Turab as well. I then fre- quented Master Daskari and Abu-l-Hasan Ibn an-NaqqashB98 for the study of geometry, until I had solved the problems from Euclid that they used to solve. At the same time, I was so devoted to medi- cine that I absorbed whatever I could from the above-mentioned two 105. Much in vogue at the time both as a general educational subject and as training for employment. 106. Scribe, secretary, official. 76</page><page sequence="72">teachers of this science. There remained parts of the Book of Eu- clid,n99 the book of al-Wasiti on arithmetic and the Book Al-Badic on algebra by al-Karkhi.100 But I could find nobody who knew any- thing of these books, or beyond these, on the mathematical sciences, e.g., the book of Shujae Ibn Aslam3BI1 on algebra and others. My passion and love for these studies were so strong that I would forget food and drink when pondering on some of them. I secluded myself in a room for a time and analyzed all those [26al books and expounded them; I refuted their authors wherever they committed mistakes; demonstrated the errors of their compilers; and undertook to verify or correct where other authors had failed. I found Euclid's arrangement of the figures in his book faulty for by rearranging them I could dispense with some as superfluous; this - after the book of Euclid had been considered the acme by the other geometricians, so much so that they had introduced nothing new either by changing Euclid's set of figures or by eliminating any of them. All this I achieved in that year, namely, by the age of eighteen. Since that year my writings in these sciences followed one another continuous- ly down to the present. God has revealed to me much that had been withheld from my predecessors among the eminent scholars; all this I put into shape for the benefit of whomever it might reach. During that time my only source of income was from the prac- tice of medicine. In this, I enjoyed a great measure of success for, with divine support, I was able to distinguish a curable disease from an incurable. I never treated a patient but with the result that he recovered. Whenever I felt disinclined to treat a patient, all the other physicians would fail to cure him and would give up his case. Praise to God for His bounty and great favor. After extensive readings of books in Iraq, Syria, Adharbayjan and Kuhistan,107 I acquired the method of extracting much knowledge and of discovering medicines which, as far as I know, I was the first t, find: such as the preparation I called "the penetrating rescuer" because it cures several serious diseases within a fraction of a day, and other preparations which I compounded that were useful and healing to men, by the grace of God Almighty. Before I took up these sciences, that is, in my twelfth and thir- teenth years, [26b] I was fascinated by records of the past and by sto- ries, and was eager to learn what had happened in ancient times, and 107. Persian province (s.w. of Khurasan). 77</page><page sequence="73">to know what had occurred in ages past. I therefore perused the var- ious compilations of stories and anecdotes. Then I passed on from that stage to an infatuation with books of entertainment and long tales; later still-to the larger compilations such as the tales on cAn- tar,108 Dhu-l-Himma, al-Battil, Iskandar dhi-l-Qarnayn, the stories of CAnqa', Taraf b. L.udhan, etc.B102 Upon reading these I recognized that most of [the material was derived] from the works of the his- torians. Therefore I sought the real historical accounts, and my in- terest shifted to the histories, of which I read the book of Abi cAli b. Miskawayh entitled Experiences of the Nations,109 the History of at-TabariT10 and other historical works. In these history books there passed before me accounts of the Prophet - God's prayer and blessing upon him - his conquests, the miracles God had performed for him, and the wonders he was given to work; divine victory and help which were granted him in the battles of Badr,111 Khaybarl2 and others; the story of his be- ginnings in orphanhood and wretchedness; the animosity of his own people toward him while he stood up to his adversaries over a period of many years, rejecting openly their faith and calling them to his own faith, until God permitted him to migrate to Medina; what ca- lamities befell his active enemies, and how they were slain under his eyes by the swords of his supporters at Badr and in other battles; the revelation of the miraculous verse foretelling the defeat of the Per- sians who, though headed by mighty Rustum with many thousands of a very great and powerful army, fled before the small and weak column under Sacd b. abi Waqqas;113 the dreams of Chosroes Anu- shirwan;114 the collapse of Byzantium and the destruction of its ar- mies at the hands of Abui cUbayda b. al-Jarrah,'5 - God's mercy 108. The works enumerated here are cycles of heroic tales, somewhat reminis- cent of western knighthood lore. 109. Died 421/1030. 110. 224-310/839-923. 111. The charisma of the Prophet is revealed in his miraculous victories, such as his first victory over the Meccans at Badr (624). 112. An oasis north of Medina, settled by Jews; occupied by Muslim forces in 628. 113. The beginning of Koran 30 mentions that Byzantium, though smitten, will again be victorious. This reference to the Byzantine-Persian struggle (of 612-626, esp. the campaign of 622-626) was uttered in Mecca. Sa'd was the leader of the Muslim force that wrested Iraq from the Persian forces in 633. 114. Legend has it that when Muhammad was born, the palace of the Persian ruler shook, and the thousand year old eternal fire of the Zoroastrian cult was ex- tinguished; a lake was flooded; the high priest saw in his dream a camel over- running lands, etc. (Cf.

Then I read about the governance of Abf BakrT6 and cUmar,17 their justice [27a] and asceticism. At the same time, en- giossed in the accounts of ministers and secretaries, I acquired from this wide reading of the stories and reports about them, and from their own words, a mastery of eloquence, and a knowledge of rhe- toric to an extent that evoked the praise of stylists and the admira- tion of rhetoricians, and that will be recognized by those who read any of the books I wrote on some scientific discipline. I saw the miracle of the Koran, which human eloquence cannot rival, and well did I recognize the truth of its miraculous character.18 Then, after I had trained my mind on mathematical sciences, espe- cially on geometry with its demonstrations, I asked myself about the differences among men in religious faiths and tenets. I received the greatest impulse to inquire into the subject from reading the epistle of Bardhawayh the physician, in the book Katila wa Dimna,19 and what I found therein. I realized then that reason is the supreme arbi- ter and that its rule should be established generally in the affairs of this, our world. For were it not that reason directs us to follow the prophets and apostles and to trust the elders and authorities of the past, we would not accept anything transmitted on their authority. I realized that if it is reason that is at the root of the adherence to the religions inherited from earlier generations, and at the root of following the prophets, it is then necessary to make reason the su- preme arbiter in this whole sphere. And if we make reason supreme judge of what we learn by transmission from our ancestors, we real- ize that reason does not oblige us to accept ancestral tradition with- out examining it as to its soundness, merely because it has been handed down from ancestors, but obliges us to accept tradition only if it be a verity per se and if there is proof of its soundness. Mere reference to fathers and ancestry, however, is no proof. For if it were, it would serve all the infidel rivals as well, e.g., the Christians. Thus, they have it from ancestral tradition that Je- sus is the son of God and upon him depend sustenance, privation, injury, benefaction.ll9 If following the fathers and ancestors were 116. The first caliph (632-34). 117. The second caliph (634-44). 113. Cf. n. 22. 119. The Indian fables (Panchatantra) in the Arabic version by Ibn al Muqaf- fa' (who was put to death in 760); to this work was attached the autobiographic note of the humanist sceptic, the physician Bardawayh. 119a Literally: He is the one who sustains, etc. 79</page><page sequence="75">to prove the truth of what has been handed down on their behalf, this would oblige us to accept as true the tenets of the Christians and Magians.?20 [27b] Should it be claimed that emulation of the ances- tors be correct only in the case of the Jews, this would not be accepted unless the Jews proved that their ancestors were wiser than those of other peoples. The Jews may make such a claim with respect to their fathers and ancestors, but all reports about their ancestors give the Jews the lie in this matter. Once we abandon partisanship in their favor, their ancestors are put on the same footing as those of other peoples. If the fathers of the Christians-and others-transmitted from their fathers such unbelief and error as reason avoids and sound human nature shuns, then it is not impossible that what the Jews have transmitted on behalf of their fathers be of the same nature. When I realized that Jews and non-Jews are on a par with re- spect to transmission of ancestral tradition, I realized that the Jews had no true proof in their possession about the prophethood of Mo- ses other than the evidence of the chain of transmission, which is available for Jesus and Muhammad just as it is for Moses - peace upon them all; that if the chain of transmission serves as confirma- tion, then all three are right and the prophethood of all of them is true. I also realized that I had not seen Moses with my own eyes nor had I witnessed his miracles nor those of any other prophet, and that, but for tradition and our following in the footsteps of the trans- mitters, we would know nothing of any of this. Then I realized that a reasonable person cannot believe one and disbelieve another of these prophets, not having seen any of them nor having witnessed the circumstances of any; except [that he may trust] tradition, whose evidence of transmission, however, is available for all three prcphets. It is therefore neither reasonable nor wise that one of them be accepted as true, and the others rejected as false. Rather, it is rationally incumbent either to believe all of them or to reject all of them. As to disbelieving all, reason does not dictate that either. For we find that they all preached lofty morals, appealed for the virtues and against the vices, and regulated the world in a fashion [28a] bene- ficial to mankind. Thus, trenchant proof convinced me of the prophethood of Je- sus and of Muhammad, and I believed in them. For some time, out of consideration for my father, I held this belief without performing 120. The Zoroastrians. 80</page><page sequence="76">the Muslim rites. For he loved me intensely, could hardly live with- out me, and was very much attached to me. He was careful about my upbringing, occupying me since my early youth with disciplines based on logical demonstration, and training my thought and mind in arithmetic and geometry, the two disciplines whose mind-develop- ing quality was praised by Plato.B03 For a long time I was not granted divine guidance, and this un- certainty, i.e. the consideration for my father, did not abandon me until travels separated me from him and my abode became distant from his. Yet I persisted in my respect for him and in the effort to avoid distressing him on my account. And the time of divine guidance arrived. The divine call reached me in a vision of the Prophet, in a dream, the night of Friday, the ninth of Dhi-l-Hijja in the year 558. This was in Maragha in Adharbayjan. Description of what I saw This is the first dream I saw. I saw myself in the vast open space of a verdant countryside. In the east loomed a mighty tree, and people were hurrying toward it. So I asked one of them what was the matter with the people. Said he: The prophet Samuel is sitting under the tree and the people are saluting him. I was glad to hear that and went toward the tree. In its shade I found a corpulent, radiant, grave old man with very white hair, awe-inspiring, holding a book into which he was look- ing. Then I saluted him saying in the Arabic tongue: "Peace upon thee, 0 prophet of God." He turned to me smiling, and said to me kindly: "And upon thee peace, O namesake. Sit down, so we may present a matter to thee." I sat down before him. [28b] He then passed to me the book which was in his hand and said: "Read what thou findest before thee." I found before me this verse from the To- rah: 121 liynty 14'5 t ^ nH DrpnD D;1 tcpp =133 meaning: I will raise them up a prophet from among their brethren like unto thee; in him they shall believe.B104 This is an exhortation from God Almighty unto Moses. I knew that the Jews say that this verse was a revelation concerning the prophet Samuel because he 121. Deut. 18:i8; the last two words are from Verse 15. In the original the last word means: ye shall hearken. 81</page><page sequence="77">was like Moses, by which they mean that Samuel was of the tribe of Levi, the one to which Moses belonged. When I found this verse of the Torah before me, I read it and thought that he meant to boast that God had mentioned him in the Torah and had announced his advent to Moses. So I said: "May it bring thee joy, O prophet of God, that God has distinguished thee therein even unto this rank." However, he looked at me angrily and said: "But is it to me that God alluded herein? 0, thou clever one, of what benefit were to you then the geometric demonstrations?" So I said: "O prophet of God, but whom was God referring to thereby?" Said he: To the one referred to in the verse:122 K 183nn y"tln The meaning of this is an allusion to a prophecy that will be revealed, it was promised, on the mountains of Paran.B15 When he told me that, I realized he meant Muhammad - may God pray over him and bless him - because he is the one sent from the mountains of Paran, i.e. the mountains of Mecca; for the Torah says literally that Paran is the dwelling of the people of Ishmael, namely in the verse:'" meaning: And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran, i.e. Ishmael the son of Abraham, the friend of God - God's prayer and blessing upon them. Thereupon he again turned to me and said: "Dost thou not know that God did not send me to abrogate anything of the Law but sent me to remind them of it, to revive its precepts, and to save them from the Philistines?" I said then: "Yes, O prophet of God." Said he: "What need have they that their Lord should enjoin them to follow one who is neither abrogating their religion nor altering [29a] their law? Dost thou think they needed that God enjoin them to accept the prophethood of Daniel or Jeremiah or Ezekiel?" I said then: "No, indeed, no need at all." He then took the scripture from my hand and departed angrily. I was frightened by his anger and alarmed by his exhortation. I awoke in terror and sat up. It was dawn, and the lamp was burning at its brightest. I recollected the entire dream. I saw it dearly with nothing of it lost. I said: Verily this is an act of grace from God - may he be praised and exalted; an exhortation that is to remove the doubt that has been preventing me from professing the true creed and openly embracing Islam. I repented thus before God and asked 122. Deut. 33:2. 123. Gen. 21:21. 82</page><page sequence="78">to be forgiven, and prayed ardently for the Apostle of God, Mulham- mad the chosen - may God pray over him and bless him. I per- formed the ritual ablution and prayed in several prostrations to God. Great was my relief and joy at the guidance revealed unto me. Then I sat up meditating, but drowsiness overwhelmed me while I was pondering, and I fell asleep.B06 I saw myself sitting in a busy street unknown to me when some- body came over to me. He was dressed in the garments of the Sufis2M and the garb of the poor. He did not greet me but said: "Obey the Apostle of God."125 Overawed, I got up to go with him; joyfully I hurried, happy at the prospect of meeting the Prophet. He walked in front of me, and I followed him until he reached the gate of a house. He entered it and invited me to enter. I walked in behind him, following him through a long corridor which was dark, but only slightly so. When I reached the end of the corridor and realized that I was about to meet the Prophet, I was overawed and began to prepare for meeting and greeting him. I remembered I had lead in the accounts about him that when he was met in com- pany they used to say: "Peace upon you and God's mercy and bless- ings"; but when he was found alone they used to say: "Peace upon thee, [29b] O Messenger of God, and God's mercy and blessings." I now decided that I should greet him with the general salutation that would include the company, too, for I considered that more proper and suitable. Then I approached the court of the house. Opposite the corridor there was a lengthy chamber, and to the left of the entrance another chamber, and there were no other rooms beside these two in the house. In each of these there were two men, of whose appearance I am not certain now, but it seems to me that most of them, though young, seemed to be preparing for travel. Some were dressed for travel, with arms near by. Then I saw the Messenger of God standing between the two chambers, i.e., in the corner of that side of the courtyard. He seemed occupied, as if just finishing something and turning to begin some- thing else. I entered unexpectedly just as he was about to start. He 124.

A turn of speech meaning: follow me (or do as ordered) in response to the command of ... 83</page><page sequence="79">was clad in white, his turban was moderately elegant; on his neck was a white cloak. He was of medium height, distinguished looking, corpulent, his colour medium between pale and ruddy, and slightly swarthy; his eyebrows and eyes were black, and his moustache and beard were of medium length as was his hair; and his features too were of medium size, neither long nor short.Bl"0 When I entered and saw him, he turned to me, saw me, and came toward me smiling and benevolent. In awe of him I forgot how I had decided to salute him, and addressed him with an individual salutation saying: "Peace upon thee, O Messenger of God, and God's mercy and blessings," thus excluding the company, as my vision and my heart turned ex- clusively to him. Ile then said: "And upon thee peace, and God's mercy and blessings." There was no interval or stop between my salu- tation and my advance toward him; I rushed toward him and stretched out [30a] my hand toward his. He stretched out his noble hand to me and put it in my hand. I said: "I testify that there is but one God and that thou art (annaka) the Messenger of God." For it came to my mind that some philologists maintain that proper names are the most expressively defined nouns, while others say that per- sonal pronouns are most expressive, which is correct. For the kaf of my word annaka includes nobody but the person thus addressed, as it applies to him exclusively.B108 I saw he was filled with joy. Then he sat down in the corner between the two chambers and I sat down in front of him. He said: "Prepare for the trip with us to Ghum- danB1lO for the conquest."126 When he said that, it was my impression that he was re- ferring to the great city which is the seat of the emperor of China, and to the fact that Islam had not yet prevailed over it. I had read that the nearest road in use to China was through the Green Sea, which is the most stormy and most dangerous of seas. When I heard that word from the Prophet, I was seized with fear of a voyage at sea, and said to myself: "The wise do not travel by sea, how then shall I travel by sea?" Then, also immediately, I said to myself: "Praise God, now that I believe in this Prophet and owe him alle- giance, shall I not follow him when he commands? What sort of allegiance is it that I have just sworn to him?" I resolved to com- ply and obey. Then another thought occurred to me, and I said: "If the Apostle of God and his companions are with us- then land and sea will submit to us and we need fear no danger." I felt relief 126. Probably Khumdan, the capital of China, "on the shore of the Green Sea." 84</page><page sequence="80">at that thought; I was filled with certainty and acceptance. I re- collect that these thoughts and ideas occurred to me whilst I was before the Prophet, in no time, that is to say, without any interval delaying my answer to the Prophet. I could not have been any quicker as I said to him: "I hear and obey, 0 Apostle of God." Then he said: "With God's blessing." Then I rose and left [30b] and I did not find in the corridor the darkness that had been there when I entered. When I left the house and had walked for a while, I found myself, as it were, in the market place of Maragha, in the spot between the row of the money-chang- ers and the Madrasa Qadawiya, and I noticed three persons in Sui- fi garb, the raiment of ascetics. One of them had on his body a waist- coat of coarse black wool, and a headdress of the same kind. In one hand he had a bow folded in shabby felt; in the other, a javelin with a palm-stem handle. Another of them was girded with a sword in a scabbard made of a palm branch. Ever since I was young and had read the stories of the rise of Muslim power it had been impressed upon my imagination how the companions of the Prophet were weak, poor, and without equipment except for the like of what we have just mentioned, and yet were victorious over powerful and huge ar- mies and numerous cavalry. So when I saw the three persons I said: These are the warriors and conquerors in the holy war, these are the companions of the Prophet; with these shall I travel and go forth to conquer. Tears rolled from my eyes in my sleep, so great was my joy and happiness over them. Then I awoke, though it was not yet dawn. I performed the ritual ablution, and said the dawn prayer. I was very eager now to proclaim the creed and to make public my conversion to the faith of Islam. I was at the time in Maragha in Adharbayjan, guest of the glori- ous master Fakhr ad-Din Abfi-l-cIzz cAbd-al-cAziz b. Mahmfid b. Sacd b. cAli b. Hamid al-Mudari - God's mercy upon him. He had suffered from a disease but God had restored him to health. I had been friendly with him even before. I came to him in the early hours of the aforementioned Friday and informed him that God had lifted the veil from me and had granted me his guidance. How great was his joy [3 a] that day at hearing the news! He said: "By God, this is what I have always wished for, and hoped for, and for a long time I have discussed it with the supreme judge, Sadr ad-Din, and both of us have regretted that your scholarship and virtues should adorn a non- 85</page><page sequence="81">Muslim; praise God for the rightness and guidance He has inspired you with, and for thus answering our prayer. But tell me, how did God reveal this unto you and how did He facilitate it, after de- nial and delay?" I said: "This is something that God has injected into my soul by inspiration. However, I had known the idea and its ra- tional proof and demonstration even before - its proof is in the To- rah - but out of consideration for my father, and thus shunning divine reproof, I was reluctant to be the cause of his grief. But now this doubt has been lifted. Stretch out your hand, and I shall testify that there is but one God and that Muhammad is the Messenger of God." The sahib, in great happiness, stood up trembling with joy - before that he could stand up only with difficulty. He left me, invit- ing me to be seated until his return, bestowed upon me the finest of clothes, had me carried on the noblest of steeds, and ordered his retinue to rush to the mosque in front of me. The sahib himself had gone ahead to the khatib12 and ordered him to bide his time and to wait until I appeared at the mosque. For it took the tailors a while to complete the sewing of the jubbal28 the sahib had ordered to be cut. I set out for the mosque as the community was waiting for me. Upon my arrival the congregation broke into a loud "God is great!" and the great mosque shook with the prayer for the Messenger of God. Then the khatib ascended the minbar,129 and the judge, the prince of preachers, Sadr ad-Din Abu Bakr Muhammad b. cAbdallah b. Ab- darrahim b. Yel,Bll delivered a sermon, speaking at length in my praise, and on the praise due to God for having granted me alertness and guidance. [31b] His eloquence on the subject was exquisite. For the most part the assembly was occupied with myself.B111 In the evening of that day, i.e. the night of the feast of sacri- fice,130 I began writing the arguments for silencing the Jews and com- piled them in a book I entitled Ifham al Yahud (Silencing the Jews). The book became well known, its fame was widespread, and numer- ous copies of it were made under my supervision in many places in the regions of Mosul, Diyarbakr, Iraq, and Persia. Later I added to it many sections of polemics against the Jews on the basis of the To- rah, so that it became an excellent work on polemics against the Jews, the like of which had never been produced in Islam. 127.

That was for two reasons. Firstly, I was loath to mention a matter that could not be proved, lest the mind of the listener should be prompt to deny it as something extraordinary or unusual. For a sensible man is loath to expose himself to refutation, be it open or secret. Secondly, I was loath to have the report of the two dreams reach anyone in the land who was envious of me on account of the scholarship and esteem God had bestowed upon me, lest this report be used to stir up ill-will against me and contempt for my conduct, and lest the ill- wishers say: "He left his religion on account of a dream he had seen; he was deceived by jumbled dreams." I therefore concealed it until the book, Silencing the Jews, had become well known, its copies numerous and read by a great number of people. When people learned the truth, i.e., that my conversion from the faith of the Jews was by proof and demonstration and trenchant arguments which I had known, and that I had been concealing this and refraining from disclosing it for a time, out of consideration and reverence for my father, then only did I reveal the story of the two dreams [32a] and ex- plain that they were an admonition from God urging me to proceed without any delay, be it on account of my father or for any other reason. I wrote a letter to my father who was then in Aleppo, whilst I was in Hisn Kayfa,Bll2 and I explained to him in that letter a num- ber of arguments and proofs which I knew he would not deny and could not refute. I informed him also of the two dreams. He set out for Mosul in order to meet me, but in Mosul he was suddenly stricken with a disease, and died. The reader of these pages should now understand that it was not the dream that had induced me to abandon my first faith. A sensible man will not be deceived about his affairs by dreams and visions, without proof or demonstration. But I had known for a long time the proofs and demonstrations and arguments for the prophethood of our master Muhammad - may God pray over him and grant him peace. It was those proofs and demonstrations that were the cause for my conversion and for taking the right path. As to the dream, it served merely to alert arfd to prod me out of my procras- 87</page><page sequence="83">tination and inertia, toward declaring, now that my father was dead, the cause of truth.131 Praise be to God for the conversion to Islam and the true creed, for the light of faith and guidance. I ask Him to direct me toward what pleases Him in Muhammad and his kin. 131. Or: the true creed. 88</page><page sequence="84">AN ANONYMOUS EPISTLE TO SAMAU'AL IT 21] In the name of God the Merciful and Compassionate. Text of a query received by Samau'al from one of the "phi- losophizing" heretics (Zindiq).B11 In the name of God, the Merciful and Compassionate. The conversion of our master - the spiritual leader, theologian, scholar, unique and outstanding, mainstay of the faith, sun of Is- lam, one and only in his age, king of the sages, may God perpetuate [T 22] support for him, and subdue anyone envious of him - from the Israelite faith to the Muslim faith was either a matter of caprice, inclination, or folly, or else it was through proof and demonstration. But caprice, inclination, or folly would ill suit a man like you and would not be fitting in a man who has reached your degree of learn- ing, especially with regard to belief and religion.l82 Should you say that it was through proof and demonstration, inquiry and speculation, then, if this inquiry and speculation were the result of some new idea that influenced you at a certain time, perhaps another new idea may occur to you which will prove the first one false. But if this inquiry was undertaken in the original state of mind, then was there no such inquiry before that time? Perhaps, if you continued your inquiry and speculation, you might learn that the truth is in a creed other than the one you have embraced. Should you say: I know that truth is in this religion - through proof and demonstration, we would say: by what method? Fur- thermore, nobody knows that one faith is truer than another faith unless he has studied and made a thorough investigation of all the faiths and perused all the texts of their masters, and all their argu- ments. If you claim to have done so -- that is absurd, for a lifetime would not suffice to read all the texts of all the masters of all the re- 132. Samau'al is addressed in the third person, which has been changed in the translation to the second person. 89</page><page sequence="85">ligions and sects. Perhaps, if you were asked about the nature of the religion of the Magians, and the dualists and the BrahmarLns8,13 you would not be an authority in the study of their tenets. Also, the religion to which you have been converted is divided into many rites (madhahib). With which one, then, did you become affiliated and which one did you choose? If you have not yet become affiliated with any of them, then you are not yet a Muslim. Again, if you have given preference to one of the rites, then - by what method? If you claim that by argu- mentation - that is absurd because it would require you to have perused all the expositions of the masters of the rites of ash-Shlfici, Abui Hanifa, Malik, and Alunad b. Hanbal.134 If you have given preference to one of the rites at your pleasure, by caprice, or merely by following an authority, that is not what be- hooves the learned and the wise; in such a case, the royal dignity departs from them,'85 B11 The opinion of our master, the religious leader and theologian, n considering and answering this, will be greatly appreciated. 133.

Foolish people will say: what has turned them from the Qibia which they hwae been observing? Say: to God belongs the East and the West. He guideth whom He willeth to a straight path.13 I have considered what is mentioned by this opponent who is asking about what is none of his concern. Let him know that God [T23] guided me with clear proof and solid argument; it was not a matter of following a teacher or parent. As to his query on the time of my profession of the Islamic tenets, whether that followed upon my becoming a believer or whether there was an interval of time between the two (i.e., the belief and the con- version) during which interval this faith was hidden or undeclared -this is a form of meddlesomeness. For Islam is pleasing to God and to the believers in either case. As to attributing the delay in professing Islam to folly - how does he know that the delay in professing and in divulging the con- version was not due to purposeful timing, or to caution against an enemy? However, we declare before God we are innocent of any slackness in responding to Him who called us toward the truth, once we recognized it. But as soon as God granted me insight and brought unto me the light of divine guidance, I hastened to join the com- munity of truth. As to his saying: Just as this has struck him as a new idea, so another idea may occur to him that will prove the first one false, the answer thereto is that this is a false analogy, and idle talk. For this objection could be raised against one converted to a [new] religion through investigation and speculation and then converted from this second religion to a third after further inquiry and specula- tion. But it does not apply to one who rejected the absurdities root- ed in his imagination since childhood, as a result of ancestral con- coction, which he had become familiar with and accustomed to, but which for him did not become valid through investigation and spec- ulation; nor to one who later, when he happened to engage i iin- tellectual activity and study, was led by reason and valid proofs toward the truth. For that which he abandoned and gave up, he 136. Koran 2:136. Qibla: The place in the direction of which one turns in prayer (Jerusalem, Mecca). 91</page><page sequence="87">had not been led to by speculation. How, then, can the doubt men- tioned apply to such a man? As to his saying: Did he investigate all the faiths -- I do not have to do so because the truth is one and is not plural. Consequently, when the proof led me to the true faith, then from its truth folowed the falseness of all the opposing faiths. There was no need to pe- ruse everything written by their masters. As to his saying: Had he inquired he might have learned that the truth is not in what he maintains - this is absurd, because truth is not plural. As to his question by which method I became convinced of the call of Muhammad - may God pray over him and his kin and grant them peace - the evidence of these mighty nations for his prophethood, coupled with the great miracle uncontested of the glorious Koran, i.e., the eloquence of the Koran, led me toward that; and this was made certain by allusions, referring to Muham- mad, which I understood from (reading) the Torah. But the for- mer (i.e., the evidence of these mighty nations) is the original argu- ment. As to his query on the Islamic rite that [T 24] I joined, and his contention that I am obliged to consider all the rites of the imams, this is a moot point that does not apply to me and a question that is none of his concern. However, my answer to it is the very first retort, namely, that proof led me to a rite in whose truth I believe, and I have no need to examine any other because truth is not plural with respect to rite, just as it is not plural with respect to faith. More- over, the difference between the Muslim authorities on rites is merely on secondary matters and minor points, not on the basic creed, nor to the extent that they would anathematize one another. I mean the followers of ash-Shafii, Abi Haianifa, Malik, and Ah- mad b. Hanba1137 - may God be gratified with them not the originators of unlawful innovations. But this inquirer into what is none of his concern, in taking this position, is bent upon strengthening the Jewish arguments I have demolished. In his support of the Jews, he busies himself with a query that is none of his concern. For I have shown in the Sienc- ing (IfhaSm) the corruption of their belief and the contradictions of their lore. This is preferable to perpetuation of the doubts of the heretics and the ravings of the infidel philosophers - who should 137. Cf. no. 134. 92</page><page sequence="88">be Iain - in the religion I abandoned and in the one to which God guided me. As to the conclusion of his speech, this is truly pointless. Kings and rulers are in the habit of apportioning to everyone that which they think he deserves, thus keeping the high positions out of the reach of the unfit. Envy serves but to augment man's obscurity. As the poet says:"116 If unnoticed I be by the fool's mind, It is just because his eyeball is blind. -And, farewell! 93</page><page sequence="89">B NOTES Bl. Abrogation is an internal Islamic problem since in the Koran certain pas- sages are supposed to abrogate other passages. Furthermore, Islam insists that the older monotheistic religions have been abrogated with the rise of Islam. Christianity considered Judaism abrogated by the New Testament dispensation. This attitude is continued in Islam and turned also against Christianity. The Jews remained the most stubborn opponents of the abrogation theory. The polemic, theological and philosophic literature of the Jews dealt with the subject extensive- ly, considering it inconceivable that God should contradict his own commands. Cf.

The argument against the acceptance of ancestral tradition as deciive is developed in various quarters. Razi (IX-Xc.) cites it (Kraus in RSO 1935, pp. 358, 367) as part and parcel of anti-traditionalism with an anti-religious sanimrw; Karaites use it to pave the way to objections against the rabbinic lore (Qirqisani 15 f., Nemoy Anthology 118). Cf. Rosenthal Ar. Autob. p. 28 n. 1. B6. Qarifi 64: the vigorous literary production of Islam shows Islam is more universalist, and perfect. Better fruits point to better plants. (Cf. Josephus, Against Apion II, 14, 20: "We have not produced any geniuses, for example, in arts and crafts, or eminent sages." Cf. Tcherikover 368; Origenes Contra Celsum Iv 31.) Moses b. Ezra in his K. al Muhadara (in the chapter edited by Kokovtseff p. 214 end, in Halper's Hebrew rendering p. 53) acknowledges the excellence of Arabic and the wealth of Arabic literature, and indeed finds it all foretold in the Bible; also 205/39, 210/47; that is why Arabian Jews were at an advantage 212/49.

Curiously Qirqisini (p. 144) accuses the Rabbanites of asserting that the Torah is not the one revealed to Mo- ses but was compiled by Ezra; they say (p. 149 f.) that there was only one copy in the hands of the priests etc. and refer to Deut. 31:9. I-H writes in the same vein in the following passages: 187, 198 f., esp. 199 end; of 117 end, 196 f. Ezra is bitterly denounced by I-H: 123, 129 lines 11-12. I-Q made use of the passage on Ezra. Yet many Muslims could not accept the forgery hypothesis. Cf. I-H 215; Tabari II 669 ff. Ms. T. digresses when it mentions the priests.

Ms. T. indeed accuses "the compiler of the Tar- gum" of the rabbinic misinterpretation. "He outdid himself in a hasty conclusion . . . This, by my life, is different from what God said for it is extremely remote from what the usage of the word suggests. This far-reaching tampering with the divine word is inadmissible. For if God wished to forbid the eating of meat with milk nothing would have prevented Him from stating that clearly. Thus their error in the interpretation of other distorted translations becomes evident, as well as how they tended to make the burden [of the precepts] heavy upon their community." B48.

Schreiner pointed to the Karaite origin of the argument mentioned also by Ibn Ezra, and referred to the 13 c. Aaron b. Joseph in Sefer Ha-Mibhar and the 14 c. Aaron b. Elijah in Keter Tora. Cf. Belkin Philo and the Oral Law (Cambr., Mass., 1940) p. 22; von Grunebaur in JQR 1941 p. 405 f. (a Muslim aware of the difference of opinion between Karaites and Rab- banites in this matter).

This is a curious echo of ancient accusations directed against the Jews, and later against the Christians. Cf. Tcherikover 365-68; Baron I 188 sq., 379 sq. With reference to celibacy's destructive intent (Takhrib al-'alam) it was turned against the Christians in Sasanian Iran (Andrae, Ursprung 188 ff.) b51. The origin of synagoguc prayers, poetry, and chant is obscure. The pres- ent text seems to carry some vague historical tradition. Cf. Baron VII 125 sq.

But the argument here may be of Karaite origin. Qirqisani (15f.) blames the Rab- banites for reciting their compositions and neglecting the Psalms of David during the services. Cf. Elbogen, 280-7; P. Kahle, The Cairo Genizah, 2 ed. (1959), pp. 38-43, 315-7. Possibly both Persian and Byzantine restrictions contributed to the shaping of the rites. B52.

Pasul was probably meant to rhyme with the Arabic Rasul, the Messenger (of God). Madman is with reference to Hosea 9:7: "The man of the spirit is mad." Qalon is an attempted parody on Qur'an. Cf. SPL 302, 313-6. Ms. T. runs here thus: "Further, their animosity toward the Muslims is stronger than that (of, toward?) the other communities. Thus they will not call the Prophet except by these two names. This despite their having found great ease and hav- ing achieved much happiness under Muslim rule. For this rule was the most le- nient toward them. Under Roman (or Byzantine) domination, they suffered from most wicked and harsh conditions, for the Romans used to hinder them in the observance of the precepts, preventing them now from praying and now from performing circumcision. The Persian Empire's yoke was the heaviest and most oppressive. But Muslim rule was the most lenient of all, the most merciful toward them for it was satisfied with their payment of poll-tax and their submission, and they were left free to observe their religion. In all fairness, this was kindness and benevolence they had nevex experienced under all the other regimes prior to Is- lam. But they requite with invoking evil upon Islam in every prayer, namely, in saying 13M2 '?li pn n'rll 1t7 tll:i5l meaning: the kingdom of evil destroy and uproot it in our days. Elbogen, 51, mentions such a passage in a Geniza piece. It is a variant of the 'amida section DlV5Dl.51 (REJ, 53, p. 238) Cf. Berakhot 28b. Maimonides recognizes the complete monotheism (yihud she- 'eyn bo dofi) of Islam (Responsa, ed. Freimann, Jerus. 1934, p. 335-7). But he is bitter about the premeditated systematic humiliation of the Jews in Islamic lands (cf. The Epistle to Yemen). Yefet b. cAli maintains "the Arabs did not act, as others had done, by (inflicting the suffering of) exile and destruction but they harassed (us) with humiliation and contempt" (adhat ft-l-dhull wa-l-hawdn; Oxf., 1889 p. 30).

The Karaite treatment of the matter, Nemoy Anthology 346, 379, Qirqisani 1152 sq. Mas'fidi (IX. c.): A man marries his niece; he dies; his brother, i.e. the widow's father, is supposed to marry her (Muruj II 388 f., ch. 31): "this is one of their secrets, one of the things they conceal and do not re- veal." Cf. S. Krauss Die Ehe zwischen Onkel und Nichte in Festschrift Kaufmann Kohler (Berlin, 1913). Cf. IH 133 f. B71. Isr -burden is here a term; it refers to the burden of the precepts which may be a form of chastisement for transgression. "A burdensome covenant com- pact or contract" Koran 2:286, 3:75, 7:156. In 2:286: a burdensome command such as was given to the Children of Israel to slay one another; grievous punish- ment of a sin" (Lane). This notion is most probably of Christian origin. Cf. T. Andrae Ursprung p. 18. Also Matt. 19:8, Mark 10:5, Rom. 5:20; Justin Mar- tyr, 7rypho ch. 18, 19, 21, 22. B72. Hrm - to forbid is used in this passage but in harramii man yudifu the verb seems to be derived from the Hebrew herem and to mean rather they threatened with excomnmunication. The two meanings are thus blended. Goldziher in his paper Kaempfe etc., (ZDMG 61, 1907), shows earlier Islamic notions about the Mishna (tending to warn against committing oral tenets to writing lest they be exposed to misinterpretation). In a note (p. 867) he rec. ogni2ed the Ibn Qayyim passages he had published in 1873 in Kobak's Jesehurun v. IX were quotations from Samau'al. 99</page><page sequence="95">1373.
