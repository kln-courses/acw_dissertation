<plain_text><page sequence="1">HARVEY MULLANE DEFENSE, DREAMS AND RATIONALITY* ABSTRACT. Are some mental activities rational but unconscious? Psychopathological symptoms, it is said, have a sense - they are seen as "compromise-formations" which express the "intentions" of agents even though the agents are totally unaware of "bringing about" such symptoms. Philosophers, who often claim that such a conception is simply contradictory or incoherent, have shed little light on the puzzles and apparent paradoxes that surround the issue. It is argued here that Freud's two models of explanation - the mechanistic and the intentionalistic - each fail to provide a basis for an explanatory account of the phenomenon of unconscious defense. An examination of the problem of dream "composition" helps explain why Freud's dependence upon "rational homunculi" is inappropriate and misleading. Finally, an alternative model which depends neither upon Freud's version of mechanism nor upon his lavish anthropormorphism is suggested. Ladies and Gentlemen, - It was discovered one day that the pathological symptoms of certain neurotic patients have a sense. On this discovery the psychoanalytic method of treatment was founded. It happened in the course of the treament that patients, instead of bringing forward their symptoms, brought forward dreams. A suspicion thus arose that the dreams too had a sense.1 So begins Lecture Five of Freud's Introductory Lectures on Psy choanalysis. The consequences of these discoveries for the philosophy of mind are significant, and, it seems, the cause of considerable philosophical confusion. "Symptom-formation" and "dream-work", as Freud labelled these processes, are said to occur unconsciously; since the productions of these nonconscious occurrences have a sense it seems necessary to postulate unconscious intelligences that carry out these functions. Questions about who or what, if anybody or anything, is to be assigned responsibility for these "ingenious" activities and how, in general, questions about rationality relate to the operation of these psychological "mechanisms" is puzzling at the least.2 All symptom-formations have a sense; more particularly, all such formations represent, the argument goes, a strategic accommodation Synthese 57 (1983) 187-204. 0039-7857/83/0572-0187 $01.80 ? 1983 by D. Reidel Publishing Company</page><page sequence="2">188 HARVEY MULLANE between conflicting ideas or desires; such "compromise-formations", as they are also called, reflect not only purpose (anxiety-provoking material is kept from awareness), but also ingenuity (ideas are distorted, disguised, substituted one for the other). "Little Hans"3 did not know why he was, all of a sudden, so afraid of horses that he would not venture outside from fear of encountering them. According to the account, Hans had (unconsciously) replaced a "fear-of-father" with a "substitute idea", a "fear-of-horses". The first idea, if it remained in consciousness, would cause an intolerable situation for the boy. By repressing that idea and replacing it in consciousness with the phobic constellation, he could take some control of the situation; that is, he could avoid the object of his fear by simply remaining indoors. His father, of course, came and went as he chose, and could not be avoided. Also, Hans wanted to be with his father or, at least, that "part" of his father which he did not fear. It is as if he knew (could he have known, must he have known?) that it would be well worth the sacrifice of his freedom of movement if that would enable him to keep the dangerous and overwhelming feelings about his father out of awareness. The ongoing function of the phobic idea is of course just that: To put it one way, it enables him to maintain the repression; alternatively expressed, a kind of delicate balance is established by means of the idea which allows for the maintenance of the repression. We can find ourselves thinking here that, given Hans's circumstances, given his beliefs and fears, he did as well in dealing with the problem as could be expected. The symptom most emphatically has a sense, and the processes which worked out this rather subtle compromise must have had a rational and intelligent character. Consider a second example. Hysterical symptoms are "conversions"; a psychological anxiety-state is "converted" or "transformed" into a most peculiar and convincing imitation of an organic dysfunction. A part of the body becomes anesthetized or paralyzed, the functioning of an organ becomes impaired. In hysterical blindness, for instance, the individual is so guilt-ridden over his wish to see what is "forbidden" that he "takes" the drastic step of "making himself blind". Such a tactic results in a striking reduction of (conscious) anxiety. The account that is given is that since the person cannot see at all he can no longer be tempted to carry out his wicked desires; also, the self-imposed blindness is a kind of punishment which directly results in the reduction or elimination of the guilt. He then reflects la belle indiff?rence des hyst?riques. Instead of feeling distraught at being unable to see, he is</page><page sequence="3">DEFENSE, DREAMS AND RATIONALITY 189 remarkably calm and much more at ease with himself than he has been for ages. And why not? Not only is his conflict over seeing resolved, he also knows at some level of unconsciousness that he is not permanently blind; he knows (must he not?) that the affliction is only a temporary one invoked to deal with a difficult situation. That is another reason why he is really not bothered by his present condition.4 What do philosophers have to say about these paradoxes - paradoxes which are, it seems, both intolerable and intriguing? Sartre finds any claims about the activities of repressors or censors, or any talk about self-deception, as simply contradictory. For him, "bad faith" is "there in full consciousness". Appeal to the concept of a censor cannot help, because it must choose and in order to choose must be aware of so doing. How can it happen otherwise that the censor allows lawful sexual impulses to pass through, that it permits needs (hunger, thirst, sleep) to be expressed in clear consciousness? And how are we to explain that it can relax its surveillance, that it can ever be deceived by the disguises of the instant? But it is not sufficent that it discern the condemned drives; it must also apprehend them as to be repressed, which implies in it at the very least an awareness of its activity. In a word, how could the censor discern the impulses needing to be repressed without being conscious of discerning them?5 This is by far the simplest "resolution" of the problem. The very idea of unconscious thought and self-deception are literal contradictions, and so the "psychoanalysis" that is dependent upon such notions can be "rejected". The difficulty is that this ignores, or at best lavishly reinterprets, many facts of common experience which need explaining. People find themselves haunted by obsessive thoughts that may appear strikingly alien to their understanding of themselves, find themselves suffering from a guilt that has no basis in the known realities of their situations. And in more normal, everyday circumstances, slips of the tongue and dreams occur which express the desires and intentions of their authors but which clearly were produced without the involvement of the (conscious) self. The point remains that these phenomena need explaining; the problem is that every attempt to do so seems to raise one sort of quandary or another. The temptation to personify these inner forces and counter-forces is very great. Freud himself is, if this is an offense, the most extreme (and, of course, the most important) offender. His mature views contain these characteristic statements:</page><page sequence="4">190 HARVEY MULLANE The id of course knows no judgments of value; no good and evil, no morality. (1933, p. 74) The super-ego applies the strictest moral standard to the helpless ego which is at its mercy .... (1933, p. 61) The id cannot be afraid, as the ego can. (1926, p. 140) In [the ego's] attempts to mediate between the id and reality, it is often obliged to clothe the unconscious commands of the id with its own preconscious rationalizations, to conceal the id's conflicts with reality, to profess, with diplomatic disingenuousness, to be taking notice of reality even when the id has remained rigid and unyielding. (1933, p. 78) Is attributing all manner of intelligence to nonconscious parts of the self justified? Can doing so really explain anything? In an essay on Freud's "anthropomorphism", Irving Thalberg6 cites the following claims that Freud makes about dreams: The ego goes to sleep at night, even though then it exercises the censorship on dreams. (1923, p. 17) The critically disapproving agency does not entirely cease to function during sleep. (1923a, p. 268) It follows from statements of this sort, claims Thalberg, that Freud's theory of the mind contains as a central feature a "conscious mini-agent of whose capers the dreamer himself is unaware".7 In elaborating the point, Thalberg argues that ... you have a choice about how to characterize the part which represses. If you depict it as some inanimate force, then you fail to explain why it picked on, say, an erotic idea. But if you introduce a repressing agency - a censoring ego - then you have to assume that it is conscious of what it represses. Otherwise it is no better, explanatorialy speaking, than an insentient force. Yet since the repressed idea does not, by definition, reach the consciousness of the person in whom all this goes on, the repressing ego's consciousness of the idea is separate from the person's consciousness. Thus it is inevitable that Freud should ascribe independent cognitive capers to our ego.8 Freud, as Thalberg notes, explicitly rejects any notion of multiple centers of consciousness.9 Still, when Freud tries to elucidate the notion of unconscious process, he cannot resist speaking in terms that conjure up images of psychic battlefields where rational homunculi are busily at work trying to make the best out of a rotten situation. And underlying all of Freud's theorizing is the fact that he is constantly straddling two very different models of explanation; on one side, the intentionalistic model peopled by these mini-agents and, on the other, the biological neurological model characterized by conceptions like energy, instinct, drive, libido, sexual metabolism, etc. As Theodore Mischel argues,</page><page sequence="5">DEFENSE, DREAMS AND RATIONALITY 191 the tension in Freud's thinking is apparent in the way he talks about both 'forces' and 'purposeful intentions' in the same breath, e.g., psychological phenomena are to be understood 'as signs of an interplay of forces in the mind, as a manifestation of purposeful intentions working concurrently or in mutual opposition'.10 Whereas Sartre finds Freud's purely psychological conceptualizations of defense to be "contradictory" n and Thalberg concludes quite similarly that they "make no sense", that they are "meaningless", Mischel applauds Freud's tendency in his middle and later periods to move closer to a purely intentionalistic understanding of unconsciously motivated behavior. The difficulty with Mischel's account, however, is that it really does not come go grips with the question of how symptom-formation is to be explicated. Unconscious agency, he says, is to be understood in terms of "cognitive structures" that follow certain patterns or "styles" (the obsessive-compulsive style, the paranoid style, the hysterical style, etc.). "Mechanisms" are to be rejected and replaced by various patterns of response that require a fully intentionalistic conceptualization. But this does no more than supply labels to certain familiar kinds of neurotic behavior; also, it misconstrues the role of "intentionality" in the development of symptoms or "compromise-formations". The im pression Mischel tries to create is that the "ego psychology" which grew out of Freud's work in the 1920's and 30's has produced the basis of an adequate explanation of these productions. But that is hardly the case. The composition of dreams and the production of conversions and phobias are not to be explained by talking about "styles" that, according to the thesis, are quite like normal behavioral styles except that the agents (the persons) are not conscious of what they are "doing". Such a view breaks free from the notion of mechanism but at the cost of implying incorrectly that symptoms are formed after the pattern of conscious choosing. But this hardly passes the test of coherence either, and it raises again the spectre of mini-agents, of rational homunculi who behave almost exactly like their owners except that they are not really conscious of anything. So the problem remains. The "insentient forces" of mechanism can't account for the "cleverness" of symptom-formation, and the anth ropomorphic explanations, since they rest on mythological construc tions, are really only phantom explanations. Is there any way of skirting this dilemma; is it, at the least, possible to deprive it of some of its force? Or, must it be concluded that the Freudian model is a huge category mistake consisting of an unmixable brew of creative little intelligences at</page><page sequence="6">192 HARVEY MULLANE the one level and dumb pushes and tugs at the other? In one interesting characterization of unconscious defense Freud said: "Repression may, without doubt, be correctly described as the intermediate stage between a defensive reflex and a condemning judgment".12 Both models are quite present in his thought and he insists that the activity or process (is one term preferable to the other?) of repression represents a middle-ground between the two extremes. This is, in general terms, surely correct, but the problem persists because when Freud talks about defense he, naturally enough, takes up either the material mode with its "Newtonian" features or the mental mode with its homunculi. But neither of these structures works well because repression is, as the standard psychoanalytic conception of "defense mechanism" implies, neither genuinely intentional nor dumbly mechanical.13 The various defenses are seen as biologically and cul turally based structures which develop according to the idiosyncratic experiences of the agent. Repression is a mechanism which operates "automatically"; its function is simply to keep (conscious) distress and anxiety from occurring. To accomplish this simple function, however, requires a very complex mechanism, so complex in its manner of operation that it appears intelligent. So, it may be "only" a defensive reflex, but it is, after all, a function of the brain; for that reason alone it should come as no great surprise that such a "device" has the capacity to use "mental states" as the material of its operation. The problem is that the consequences of its functioning are so remarkably subtle that the greatest temptation, by far, is to postulate homuncular agents which somehow carry out its operations. It is easy to say that Freud's uninhibited homuncularizing is not to be taken literally, but that is about all we get from him, and we may well find ourselves - despite all the warnings - thinking, as he does, that the symptom-former and the dream-censor are, in some curious way or other, rather like conscious creators and judges. How might the trap be avoided? It may be of help in thinking about repression if we begin by examining in some detail the closely related and equally puzzling phenomenon of dream-formation. Perhaps the most striking feature of dreams - even more impressive, in a way, than their having very complex symbolic meanings - is the comparatively simple fact that the dream as presented or experienced so often takes the form of a coherent story or adventure. It certainly seems as if stories are composed and presented to us without any contribution</page><page sequence="7">DEFENSE, DREAMS AND RATIONALITY 193 from "us". The dream is further from our "will" than any other form of conscious thinking, further away than the intermediate and quasi autonomous activities of creative thinking and day-dreaming.14 In both of these situations, even though the thoughts clearly have a direction and life of their own, the thinker oversees the process and shapes and embellishes the ideas. In dreaming, however, the dreamer is typically a pure spectator who cannot affect the flow of thought in the slightest respect; the dream was composed, it appears, quite apart from the will of the dreamer. It is the question of dream composition which I especially want to concentrate upon; in the first place it is a conception which is of central importance not only to Freud's theory of dreams, but also to his understanding of unconscious thinking in general; secondly, it should reveal - more clearly, perhaps, than anything else - how misleading it is to think even metaphorically or anthropomorphically of unconscious thinking as a nonconscious replica of conscious thinking. The very curious facts about certain dreams will bring out some of the difficulties. Almost all serious writers on dreams have at least taken note of "instantaneous" dreams; many writers have puzzled over them at length. In The Interpretation of Dreams, Freud is intrigued by the phenomenon; he discusses Maury's famous guillotine dream:15 While sick in bed Maury dreamt that he was in Paris during the Reign of Terror. After watching several scenes of massacre he was himself brought before the revolutionary tribunal. He saw there Robespierre, Marat Fouquier-Tinville and the rest of the grim figures of that terrible period. He was interrogated by them; then after a number of incidents which he could not remember, he was condemned to death and taken, amid a huge mob, to the place of execution. He climbed onto the scaffold and was tied to the plank by the executioner. It was tipped up and the blade of the guillotine fell. He felt his head being separated from his body and woke up in great anxiety to discover that the top of the bed had fallen down and had struck his cervical vertebrae in just the way which the blade of the guillotine would have struck them. Naturally enough, Maury reasoned that the awakening stimulus initiated the dream and that all the complex imagery and conceptual content were somehow compressed into the split second between the initial perception of the stimulus and the awakening. This is a conclusion, however, that bothers many people; its ac ceptance is incompatible with the most traditional and most comfortable understanding of dreaming. The traditional view (that dreams are experiences essentially similar to waking experiences) has received the</page><page sequence="8">194 HARVEY MULLANE most detailed arguments from William Dement, the dean of modern-day dream researchers. Dement's theory16 is a thoroughly traditional view put in contemporary scientific dress. In the face of the questions raised by instantaneous dreams, Dement tries to preserve the central thesis that dreams occur during periods of rapid eye movements (REM), and that the "subjective duration" of the dream experience correlates with the length of the relevant REM period. The contention, in other words, is that it takes about as long to dream an adventure as it would to think through or daydream the same story. This thesis is of questionable merit even in the absence of any problems connected with "arousal" dreams. But, interestingly, Dement's attempt to deal with the instantaneous dream phenomenon is notably inept. After mentioning that Maury recorded the dream ten years after its occurrence and so may have considerably embellished it, he concludes: The best explanation is that Maury was already dreaming about the French Revolution when the bed fell, and that only the final specifically appropriate images occurred after the perception of the stimulus.17 If such dreams were quite rare it might be plausible to write them off in some such way as this. The fact is, however, that elaborate dreams which lead, as it seems, inevitably to some representative of the incorporated waking stimulus are common and widely discussed phenomena. Freud makes reference to the work of more than a dozen of his contemporaries who deal with the issue.18 Since none of these writers had a theory of dreams, it was left to Freud to offer an answer (which he admits is tentative and incomplete) to the puzzle. Freud says about Maury's dream that it appears as if the only solution is to say that the dream "must have taken place during the short period of time between the contact of the board with Maury's cervical vertebrae and his consequent awakening".19 But this interpretation would neces sitate a remarkable acceleration in both the speed at which dreams are presented or experienced and the rate at which dreams are composed. Presumably not many will be glad to accept any such acceleration of the presentation process; no dreamer, so it seems, can experience such a long dream in, say, a half-second. Freud, indeed, does reject the notion that the dream is experienced at a highly accelerated rate, and he is equally reluctant to imagine the composition process as an instantaneous one. He rejects both the idea that the dreamer experiences the dream very fast and the idea that the dream is put together at the moment of awakening</page><page sequence="9">DEFENSE, DREAMS AND RATIONALITY 195 and then "remembered" with the sense of its having been experienced before awakening. What Freud does suggest is that with a dream like Maury's the most sensible thing to assume is that it represents a readymade fantasy which has been stored in memory for some time; in the case of the guillotine dream, for many years. It was aroused or, as Freud says, "alluded to" at the moment Maury was struck - at the moment he became "aware" of the waking stimulus.20 Here, the waking impression of the dreamer that he has just experienced a sequence of psychological events is an impression only. The stored adventure is not, says Freud, "gone through during sleep"; it is sufficient that it merely be alluded to or "touched on". He explains: If a few bars of music are played and someone comments that it is from Mozart's Figaro (as happens in Don Giovanni) a number of recollections are aroused in me all at once none of which can enter my consciousness singly at the first moment. The key phrase serves as a port of entry through which the whole network is simultaneously put in a state of excitation. It may well be the same in the case of unconscious thinking. The rousing stimulus excites the psychical port of entry which allows access to the whole guillotine phantasy. But the phantasy is not gone through during sleep but only in the recollection of the sleeper after his awakening. After waking he remembers in all its details the phantasy which was stirred up as a whole in his dream.21 What, then, is being "recollected?" Not, as is the case with "normal" dreams, a dream experience, but an unconscious idea which is, in its entirety and all at once, present; there is "access" to the whole fantasy. These speculations, though suggestive (perhaps in a way that Freud does not realize), do not provide a base for a plausible account of arousal dreams. Freud does begin to break free from the traditional view that all dreams are (sleeping) experiences (a view which simply cannot accom modate arousal dreams); but the idea that arousal dreams stem from consciously precomposed fantasy (or stories, or daydreams or what ever) cannot itself withstand much scrutiny. What is especially interes ting to notice here, however, is that Freud is willing to imagine that "unconscious thinking" can operate in such a way as to instantly recall (to "preconsciousness" in Freud's model) all of a stored fantasy, a whole musical composition. Yet he is not willing to extend this mode of functioning to cover (unconscious) dream composition. But why not imagine that dream formation as an unconscious process need not take time in any way resembling the sense that (conscious) story writing takes time? Then, dream stories could be written as well as simply brought to preconsciousness in a flash in response to any waking stimulus. That</page><page sequence="10">196 HARVEY MULLANE would eliminate the need for a "precomposition" theory. Such a theory cannot explain arousal dreams. Most dreams, whether arousal dreams or not, have a dream-like quality, not the quality of a daydream or fantasy. Typically, dreams reflect a "dream-logic"; in this dream world many of the ordinary facts of reality, and often the principles of logic, are absent. If these more typical (arousal) dreams are stored they must be stored with their dream logic intact (which seems to be an unlikely prospect), or, if they are stored as daydreams, they must be transformed, at the moment of arousal, from daydream or fantasy quality to night-dream quality (again, a possibly coherent but hardly attractive idea). Underlying all of this is the more serious problem of how, in general, the requisite storage system is to be understood. Such a system would require, apparently, an immense library of undreamed dreams, stored phantasies, or whatever else, all ready to be set off by an innumerably varied set of potential waking stimuli. The total unpredictability and the unique character of some of these stimuli which end up getting matched with dreams that fit them perfectly implies not a vast warehouse of indexed and cross indexed undreamed stories-in-waiting, but an on-the-spot composing.22 If a precomposition thesis with its attendant storehouse is so im plausible, why are writers on dreams given to such desperate measures? Above all else, it is because they cannot break away from the "Cartesian" idea that since it takes time to consciously choose, sort out, maneuver, compose, etc., such activities on the unconscious level also involve similar time-consuming struggles. Freud invariably expresses himself according to such a commitment. (He must have been quite serious when he said that "our understanding extends as far as our anthropomorphism".)23 The resulting picture is that the inferred un conscious "activities" turn out to have all the features of experienced thinking save one, namely, consciousness. With this view, then, dream composition is inescapably seen as a process that is time-consuming; if the "manifest dream"24 is either very lengthy, ingeniously disguised, loaded with symbolism, etc., it must have taken time to compose. If interpretation based on the dreamer's "associations" indicates that a dream (or even a single dream image!) is heavy with meaning, then Freud's assumption is that the "thinking" that went into its construction was time-consuming much as play writing is time-consuming. Freud says: Certain personal experiences of my own lead me to suspect that the dream-work often requires more than a day and a night to achieve its result; and if this is so, we need no longer feel any amazement at the extraordinary ingenuity shown in the construction of the dream.25</page><page sequence="11">DEFENSE, DREAMS AND RATIONALITY 197 Surely some dreams take time to compose in the sense that items in the dream (whether in the manifest content or "in" the latent or unconscious content)26 may be taken from yesterday, or from any number of past times that might span many years. But that does not mean that the dream took years, days, or even minutes to construct. Just because a dreamer had "a day and a night" to compose a dream doesn't make the "task" any less (or any more) remarkable. If dream-workers were little persons with some of the talents and some of the limitations of their owners, they could do a better job if they were provided with ample time and a quiet environment in which to work. But "they" are not, and the ingenuity of dreams becomes no less and no more amazing because some dreams may, in a sense, require the passage of considerable time for their composition. D. C. Dennent (of all people!) says that the composition process "might well occur during our waking hours, and spread over months (it takes a long time to write a good story)".27 Of course dreams may be composed during the day, or (as Dennent suggests in particular) during periods of rapid eye movements,28 or at any time when the nervous system is functioning for that matter, but there is no point in supposing that that kind of story writing is anything like conscious creativity. Most people have little facility for moderate much less ingenious symbol making, yet almost all of these same people can dream quite "brilliantly". But it is not anything they can take credit for because it is not something that they work at at all, much less, for "hours". It is not true, as Freud claimed, that a dream "is like a firework, which takes hours to prepare but goes off in a minute".29 Dreams, of all mental activities that can be experienced, are furthest from the reach of our wills. If we could get in touch with the dream-composing apparatus (trying to imagine here that such an idea is intelligible) we would not know what to do, no matter how much time we were allowed. That operation is simply foreign to us, and to think otherwise, even metaphorically, causes no end of mischief and misunderstanding. It is much better to think of dreams being composed in seconds or split seconds of computer-like sorting and mixing of ideas and images; however "clever" the consequences may be it is not a feat of either a person or a mini-person. That (manifest) dreams are coherent adventures may well be one of the stunning facts of life, but the postulation of personified dream-workers makes it no less amazing, no more intelligible.30 Similar considerations apply to repression. If the repressor is given</page><page sequence="12">198 HARVEY MULLANE plenty of time to contemplate the causes of action open to it, and to work out some fitting compromise (say Little Hans's "choice" of an animal phobia) should we "cease to be amazed" at its ingenuity? Again, such a question could be asked only by someone who insists on construing repression as an operation of a "little person within" and not as a mechanism. The irony of this is that it is Freud (the 19th century physiologist!) who turns out to multiply psychological entities beyond necessity by populating the individual psychological organism with multiple anthropomorphic intelligences. Repression is (as Freud himself said) a defensive reflex; it looks intelligent only because it is a function of the nervous system, rather than a function of the heart or the liver. Like dream-formation it takes considerable brain power, but as with dreams the "I" (as conscious ego) has no part in the process, and it is Cartesian to think that the repressor needs time, as I would, to figure out how to quiet a conflict between two or more warring parties. Though symptom formation is an "activity" far less clear in scope than dream-formation (the latter, comparatively speaking, is ideally clear; the "product" that is presented to the dreamer is a nicely specifiable and demarcatable occurrence), they are to be understood in the same manner. This operation, like dream construction, is beyond the control of the conscious will, it is unexperienced and it functions automatically in an "attempt" to keep conscious anxiety and distress at a tolerable level. It is a function that presumably has had and continues to have very significant survival value. Like other functions of the human organism, though, it sometimes operates ineffectively; when that happens the repressed "returns" in the form of debilitating symptoms. But all of that is carried out automatically and unconsciously in a "realm" that is totally unfamiliar to us conscious creatures. Understanding these operations "scientifically" is, at least for now, quite beyond our capacities. Freud seemed to know this, but characteristically, he could not resist the challenge; he tried to understand the defensive forces at work in "economic" terms, from the "dynamic" point of view, according to "biological" conceptions, and so on. But through it all, it was really the anthropomorphic language that Freud depended upon most heavily. Of course he was aware of the seriousness of the problems, but he never could bring himself to modify, much less abandon, his elaborate use of homuncular conceptions. Very late in his career he said: "I must admit that I have tried to translate into the language of our normal thinking what must in fact be a process that is neither conscious nor preconscious,</page><page sequence="13">DEFENSE, DREAMS AND RATIONALITY 199 taking place between quotas of energy in some unimaginable sub stratum".31 This other realm he indeed recognizes as "unimaginable" yet in the next breath he says: "But this is not a strong objection, for it cannot be done in any other way". Approaching the problem from the other side, the conceptions that stem from the early "Project for a Scientific Psychology"32 (the remnants of which stayed with Freud's theorizing to the end) could not, as he came to see, be translated into concepts which would capture sufficiently anything close to what was required, viz., intentionality. Mere purposive functioning, or the notion of something along the lines of a homeostatic mechanism would be helpful only if the critical notions of the "Project" would operate in such a way as to explain, for instance, why, in specific cases, some ideas and beliefs are shut out of consciousness, while others are allowed in and still others are permitted entry only after "distortion". Freud's basic idea was that psychological events could be understood as quantitatively determinate states of clearly specifiable physiological processes. The concepts he invoked (like "inertia" and "constancy") would not, be came to see, begin to bridge the gap, and by 1897 he had given up the idea of a "Psychology for Neurologists".33 Since neither homuncularism nor Freud's type of mechanism can offer much enlightenment about the nature of (unconscious) defense, what, if anything, is left? Only, perhaps, the modest proposal, already sketched, that these unconscious operations of dream and symptom-formation are functions of the neurophysiological system which derive the specificity of quasi intentionality from the fact that they are brain functions. Also, they can, in several respects, be seen as computer-like operations. First, they operate mechanically and, as the examination of dreams gives reason to believe, with "astonishing" speed. (One can imagine that they are not slowed down by the plodding character of consciousness - the require ment that first one thing must be attended to, and then another, etc.) Phobic reactions, for example, are not produced by the unconscious ego of a five-year-old boy which weighs various alternatives, decides that a phobia of some sort would be best, notices similarities between the powerful father and powerful animals, chooses horses as the substitute, etc., etc., etc. It is preposterous to think of symptom-formation in this way, just as it is preposterous to attribute "real" ingenuity to computers. Furthermore, the calculations and maneuvers of censors, dreamwriters and symptom-formers are not only not conscious, they are not even capable of becoming conscious. Something happens nonconsciously</page><page sequence="14">200 HARVEY MULLANE when an hysterical paralysis is produced, and what is produced has a sense; but the act of producing it is not a mental act in the unconscious that, like the repressed fear of father, can be brought to consciousness. The production of the symptom is, it might be said, just a nonconscious machine-function; it is not an unconscious piece of thinking because it is neither unconscious in the psychoanalytic sense (i.e., it is not repressed) nor, except in a highly metaphorical sense, a thought process at all. Little Hans was very afraid of his ill-tempered father, and that fear was unconscious. Later he became aware of this; the fear and the associated beliefs, which also underwent repression, became conscious. That "material", like material in (nonrepressed) memory, is "there" to be recovered. Hans really did have certain false beliefs which, along with the fear, were repressed; he never believed, however, that if he substituted horses for father he could avoid conscious anxiety by avoiding contact with horses. The hysterically blind person never believed that becoming blind would relieve his intense anxiety. Nor does such a person believe that if he "made himself" blind it would be a just punishment for his evil impulses. Again, such ideas are outlandish, not because symptoms are not really purposive compromises reflecting quasi-intelligence, but because the "processes" involved in the production of symptoms are nothing like conscious processes. They are not conscious processes that get shoved into the unconscious nor are they, even, anything in the unconscious which is denied access to consciousness. They were never conscious, and, in the unconscious, they pose no threat to consciousness as does the "material" that is repressed. These nonconscious maneuvers do not have the status of attitudes, or beliefs, or feeling states, or any of the familiar mental entities that can enter consciousness. They defy all our standard categories; they are neither rational nor irrational; in tentionality and mechanism both fail to capture their essence. They operate in an alien realm, in some unimaginable substratum, lacking even the substance to leave behind traces of themselves in any part of the memory.

See P. Alexander, 1962; T. Mischel, 1965; H. Mullane, 1971. 3 See Freud's 'Analysis of a phobia in a five-year-old boy' (1909). 4 It may seem that I am unnecessarily deepening the sense of paradox with these additonal conjectures. That is not the case, however, for Freud says of hysterically blind people that "in their unconscious they see" (Freud, 1910, p. 212). On a parallel note in connection with dream theory, he says that the dreamer always knows that he is dreaming (Freud, 1900, p. 571). 5 Being and Nothingness, pp. 52-53. 6 See his 'Anatomies of the Self. 7 Thalberg, p. 165. 8 Thalberg, p. 165. 9 "... a consciousness of which its own possessor knows nothing is something very different from a consciousness belonging to another person, and it is questionable whether such a consciousness, lacking, as it does, its most important characteristic, deserves any discussion at all" (Freud, 1915, p. 170). 10 'Understanding Neurotic Behavior: from "Mechanisms" to "Intentionality"', p. 229. The citation is from Freud's Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis (1916-1917), p. 67. 11 Sartre's critique is motivated by his fervently held yet doubtful belief that responsibility demands the "total translucency of consciousness" (Being and Nothingness, p. 49). It is an interesting irony that Freud's views on moral responsibility are downright Sartrean despite his fundamentally uncompromising divisions of the self. (See Freud's 'Moral Responsibility for the Content of Dreams' (1925).) 12 Jokes and Their Relation to the Unconscious (1905), p. 175. 13 The term did not come into common usage until 1937 with the appearance of Anna Freud's The Ego and the Mechanisms of Denfense. Freud, however, fully endorsed the term. See his 'Analysis Terminable and Interminable' (1937), pp. 235-236. 14 The "will-status" of these phenomena is discussed by B. O'Shaughnessy, 'The Id and the Thinking Process'. 15 Maury, L., Le Sommeil et les R?ves, pp. 133-134. 16 See especially his 'An Essay on Dreams'. 17 'An Essay on Dreams', p. 173. 18 The Interpretation of Dreams, op cit., Vols. IV and V, esp. pp. 22-30; 495-98. Among others, Freud quotes from F. W. Hildebrandt who notes "the striking facility with which dreams are able to weave a sudden impression from the world of the senses into their own structure so that it comes as what appears to be a pre-arranged catastrophe that has been gradually led up to. In my youth, I used to make use of an alarm clock in order to be up regularly at a fixed hour. It must have happened hundreds of times that the noise produced by this instrument fitted into an ostensibly lengthy and connected dream as though the whole dream had been leading up to that one event and had reached its appointed end in what was a logically indispensable climax", p. 26. 19 The Interpretation of Dreams, (1900) pp. 495-96. 20 The Interpretation of Dreams, (1900) pp. 496-97. Why should it be imagined that such a phantasy is stored in Maury's memory? Freud speaks to that too: "It can hardly be disputed, I think, that the dream-story was precisely of a sort likely to be constructed by a young man</page><page sequence="16">202 HARVEY MULLANE under the influence of powerfully exciting impressions. Who - least of all what Frenchman or student of the history of civilization - could fail to be gripped by narratives of the Reign of Terror, when the men and women of the aristocracy, the flower of the nation, showed that they could die with a cheerful mind and could retain the liveliness of their wit and the elegance of their manners till the very moment of their fateful summons? How tempting for a young man to plunge into all this in his imagination_" p. 497. 21 The Interpretation of Dreams (1900), p. 497. 22 D. C. Dennent does imagine a system like this; he calls it a "cassette theory". It may be offered somewhat tongue-in-cheek, but it is hard to tell. See his 'Are dreams experiences?'. 23 As recorded in the Minutes of the Vienna Psychoanalytic Society, edited by H. Nunberg, et al., p. 175. 24 Freud's term for dreams as experienced or dreams as recollected. 25 The Interpretation of Dreams (1900), p. 576. 26 What is "part" of the manifest content is essentially uncontroversial. Freud's decision to accept the dreamer's "narrative" as a report of the dream events is a reasonable and practical one, but his inclination to see the latent content as a dream (the "latent dream") constructed by analysis from the dreamer's "associations" points to the same familiar problems. "Latent dream" is a misnomer; it is not an "underlying" dream nor is it, as Freud sometimes calls it, the "real" dream. It is not a dream at all, and the only reason why Freud ends up calling it that is that he imagines the unconscious dream worker in homuncular terms, as a kind of experiencer of the "real" (i.e., repressed) beliefs and attitudes which are going on at the deeper unconscious level. This is doubly misleading because of the related problem that there is no way of being at all clear about the nature of dream interpretation as it relates to the dreamer's associations. When do the dreamer's associations relate to the dream (the manifest dream), and when do they drift into other material so that they are no longer associations to that dream? Often, there is no way of telling. So, there is often no way of telling what is "in" the latent content. This is why questions like, "Do all dreams have a sexual content?" and "Are all dreams expressions of a fulfilled wish?" are so confused in Freud's writings. 27 'Are Dreams Experiences?', p. 237. 28 Dream researchers say that, typically, there are several REM periods each night totalling almost two hours. From their traditional view it follows that we are having two hours of dream experience a night. Dennent, who suggests (most plausibly in many respects) that this "received" view of dreams as experiences is faulty, wants to think that these REM periods are periods of (unexperienced, of course) dream composition. That "we" (our dream-workers or brains, or whatever) spend two hours a night writing adventures is, it seems, considerably more implausible than the received view on this point, at least. 29 The Interpretation of Dreams, p. 576. 30 Despite all the attention given to dreams during recent decades, most of the problems are as puzzling as ever. It is very unclear, for instance, whether any view which might deserve the name of theory can come close to settling the question of whether (all, any) dreams are experiences. The work of Dement and the dream researchers does not establish this, much less their more ambitious claim that the subjective duration of dreams correlates with the length of the "delimited" REM period. These contentions about dream duration as a psychological experience are heavily dependent upon the truth of claims they made about directional rapid eye movements. It was alleged by the researchers in the early 1960's that</page><page sequence="17">DEFENSE, DREAMS AND RATIONALITY 203 there is a "demonstrable correspondence" between the direction of the eye movements during the REM periods and the "spatial orientation" of the reported dream events (H. Roffwarg, et. al., 1962). This "scanning hypothesis" is the view that REMs, rather than being purely "physiological" random movements, are actually to be understood as a psychological phenomenon in which the dreamer is "following" the "action" of the dream with his eyes. Early studies stated this conclusion with considerable assurance, and the experimental data as presented seemed to come very close to clinching the matter. Dement was at the forefront of the believers during this period of enthusiastic optimism. He confidently stated that directional rapid eye movements were the best evidence that "dreaming takes place during the REM period, and further, that it is an ongoing phenomenon". ('An essay on dreams', p. 173.) Scepticism grew, however, and the issue became highly controversial. Key studies were not replicated, and the thesis - mis conceived from the beginning, it seems to me - may now be a dead issue. 31 New Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis (1933), p. 90. 32 See Freud (1895). 33 As Freud called the un titled monograph.
