<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW, LXXVII, No. 1 (July, 1986) 65-70 KLEIN'S ANTHROPOMORPHISMS IN THE TARGUMIM* As MORE TARGUMIC texts are made accessible to scholars in appropriately prepared editions, targumic scholarship will begin to shift its attention to careful and precise study of less technical aspects of Targum research than the copying of manu- scripts.' Desired are works which will illuminate the thought world and exegetical methodology of the Targumim (plural; it is misleading to speak of "the Targum's" view of anything), not merely the oft-studied Xlnt and the like. Michael Klein's Anthropomorphisms is virtually identical with his Hebrew University dissertation of 1978 written under M. Haran and S. Morag. Klein focuses on an issue which is taken for granted (as can be seen from the citations in his opening chapter) in most surveys of, and references to, the Targumim: that the Aramaic versions are anti-anthropomorphic, avoiding attribution of human form or feeling to the Deity, even when the biblical text shows no such hesitation. This is said to be achieved by the use of circumlocutions, nonliteral translations, and such "distancing devices" as the words Dtp and K'llt, among others. Medieval Jewish exegetes, limited only to Targum Onqelos, already recognized that this broad generalization is not tenable, but their recognition did not prevent modern scholars from repeating it, and this despite the far richer evidence in pseudo-Jonathan, in geniza fragments, in the medieval fragment tradition, and in Neofiti which is now available. Klein is thus making a case against the accepted consensus, and it is quite clear from his analysis that this consensus, which so often results from one reference work quoting another, is in need of re-examination. Klein builds an on-the-whole convincing argument for the view that there is no systematic anti-anthropomorphism in the Targumim, either in their earliest form or in the extant texts which we possess. I agree with his general approach, and will concentrate on the issue of methodology, which is so often a neglected topic in targumic studies, and on specific points in Klein's argument which may be open to question. I. Klein's introduction discusses the issue of anthropomorphism in the Hebrew Bible, in rabbinic literature, and in the Targumim. He offers a statement of * Michael L.

Klein spends as much space on anthropomorphism in the Hebrew Bible as on that in rabbinic literature, but the two pages devoted to the latter topic might have been expanded to serve as a framework for the discussion of the targumic treatment of anthropomorphism. Since the targumim are, in some sense or other, a part of rabbinic literature, their location within that tradition would have been enlightening. The introduction is followed by an historical survey of the study of anti-anthropomorphism in the Aramaic Targumim, from R. Saadiah Gaon through the scholars of the 19th and 20th centuries, thus locating Klein's own discussion of and approach to the issue in a centuries-old continuum. The two chapters which investigate targumic treatment of biblical nouns referring to God's body (pp. 43-69) and biblical verbs which describe divine emotion, motion, and perception (pp. 70-99) constitute the heart of Klein's work. He examines those idioms or words which are supposed to be anti-anthropomorphic in their translations of biblical phrases about God. If there is no difference between the treatment of those idioms in divine and human contexts, anti-anthropomorphism should not be claimed to explain the nonliteral translation. Furthermore, even where there is, other criteria ought to be considered before anti-anthropomorphism can be asserted. Klein strives to show that none of the targumic evidence offers consistently anti-anthropomorphic translations. For him, anthropomorphisms are traces of the earlier stages of the Targum, and their presence indicates an incomplete process of leveling or editing of the targumic corpus. He does not, of course, deny that the Targumim may have "developed" anti-anthropomorphic tendencies, but would in fact claim that the presence or absence of anthropomorphisms can be used to date targumic passages relatively. For Klein, the exception is the rule: i.e., if one of the Targumim manifests, even sporadically, an anthropomorphic rendition of a term rendered anti-anthropomorphically elsewhere, this suffices to demonstrate that the Targum is not anti-anthropomorphic. This assumption should perhaps be ques- tioned, and will be discussed further below. Klein eliminates from his consideration biblical idioms which had become non- literal already in the biblical text (e.g., ;l'lt3 17'IT, pTrn T', and the like: p. 43), but considers all others. Such comprehensiveness is not always enlightening, as it mandates inclusion of data which carry relatively little weight. For example, analysis of the rendering of the term lnlK, which occurs but once in a divine context, is less enlightening than a discussion of the targumic treatment of T'. But they are all listed, undistinguished by frequency. This points up a minor but constant shortcoming in the work, the absence of smooth transition from one section to another. Without convenient headings and subheadings, which would have helped the reader to follow the argument more easily, the list-like aspect of the analysis prevails. A clearer picture of the implications of Klein's data would have resulted if the conclusions had been sharply set off from the argumentation. 66</page><page sequence="3">KLEIN'S ANTHROPOMORPHISMS-BERNSTEIN In his survey of the Aramaic interpretations of the body parts ascribed by the Bible to God, Klein demonstrates more than adequately that there is no clear pattern of anti-anthropomorphism in the Targumim, with Neofiti often exemplify- ing the "primitive" state of the text. (Whether this could serve as evidence for those who claim an early date for Neofiti is an interesting sidelight not discussed by Klein.) Inconsistency seems to be the pattern of translation. The chapter on verbs is divided into three sections dealing respectively with verbs of emotion, motion, and intellect/perception in the divine context. The first group, on the whole, quite evidently allows anthropomorphic Aramaic translations, while the second seems to exhibit more signs of paraphrase. It was the verbs of the last category, intellect and perception, which attracted the attention of Jewish exegetes from Maimonides to R. Nathan Adler, who felt a need to explain their frequent, but by no means constant, use of anti-anthropomorphic terminology. The distinc- tions which they established, as Klein clearly demonstrates, are awkward in Onqelos and non-operative in the other Aramaic versions. We also observe syntactical irregularities which betray secondary changes in the original text. (Since the secondary overlay is visible, "original text" is an appropriate term.) The discussion of 'UK1 (pp. 95-96), for example, is quite striking. Klein's analysis makes it quite obvious that in verbs pertaining to the Deity, as well as in nouns, there is no systematic avoidance of anthropomorphism by the Targumim. The chapter "The Syntactic Structure of Certain Circumlocutions," describes phenomena which are important both for his own argument and for any attempt to analyze systematically modes of targumic translation. Klein presents evidence convincing even to the uninitiated that certain changes in the Targum texts give themselves away by the presence of syntactic incongruity with the surrounding material. For example, biblical Hebrew occasionally employs the direct object marker nK with a verb in the passive voice. Neofiti adjusts most of these instances in order to avoid the same construction in Aramaic. Some of the cases where Neofiti retains the construction are adjusted in some of the other Targumim. Yet it is this very construction which the Targumim, particularly Neofiti, introduce in order to remove anthropomorphism. Verbs referring to God are shifted from active to passive, but the object mark remains, e.g., Gen. 29:32 "13Y: 'r; 71'1 'I is rendered "'y n' 'n cr7p :l ' Ir1. It is not unreasonable to assume that ';1 0Dp '5 has replaced ';1 nn which is quite congruent with "'1t n1'.2 The two best-known "anti-anthropomorphisms" are probably 1tpj and 1RnI, and Klein therefore devotes a section of his book to each.3 Following in the 2 This and other similar syntactic phenomena point to changes which have been made in the targumic text in order to mitigate or remove anthropomorphism. And since the traces are visible, presumably the "original" text allowed the anthropo- morphism to stand. 3 One of the two English-language articles appended to the book, replacing the customary English summary in published Israeli dissertations, deals with the same topic: "The Preposition CD'I ('Before'): A Pseudo-Anti-Anthropomorphism in the 67</page><page sequence="4">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW footsteps of S. D. Luzzatto, Klein shows that the basic function of D!p is not anti-anthropomorphic, but rather expresses reverence in divine contexts. A similar idiom-God's "being" with an individual-is translated literally in half its appear- ances in Neofiti, and in some of the cases where KIl= and l'TYO appear, they seem to be secondary additions. Because of the complex issues peculiar to R'l'nZ, the section on that term does not contribute a great deal to the study of anthropo- morphism. Klein's main point is well-taken, that Kl'1 seems at times to be secondary in Neofiti, and is not aimed at the mitigation of anthropomorphism. The discussion of anthropomorphism in the Qumran Targum texts probably ought to have been among the first chapters in the book. If an "original" targumic approach is postulated, what better way to demonstrate it than through the earliest targumic document which we possess? It is clear that 11 QtgJob does not remove the anthropomorphisms of the Hebrew Job; K'l1ns is not inserted where it appears in the "medieval" Targum to Job. In this area the Qumran Targum stands alone against all the medieval traditions which share M'1=V and the like. A survey of the material in this sub-chapter would have prepared the reader, chronologically and conceptually, for the development of Klein's thesis. On the other hand, the independent treatment of Palestinian targumic material from the Cairo genizah (pp. 139-44) seems harder to explain. Since there is no attempt in the book to treat other targumic traditions independently of each other, and since the genizah material itself is not homogeneous (despite the fact that its Aramaic is generally uncorrupted by European scribes), as Klein himself points out, one wonders whether the analysis of these texts might not have been better off were it integrated into the earlier chapters. After seeing the data from the "standard" Targumim, we are not surprised to discover that inconsistency is the order of the day in the genizah material. In the final portion of the book, Klein deals with the issue of targumic consistency in non-theological areas, and argues that there is a tendency in the Palestinian Targumim to standardize double translations for certain Hebrew words, not to use the same Aramaic word for all appearances of a Hebrew word, and to employ Greek rather than Aramaic words in certain contexts. He suggests that the tendency to remove anthropomorphism is no more consistent than these others. His conclusion, in the last sentence of the book is "that the ancient metargemim did not attribute particularly great importance to expressions of anthropomorphism in the Torah, to the degree of their removal or complete circumvention in the Aramaic Targumim." It is not clear whether we should expect the same degree of inconsistency in theology as we do in translation technique. In fact, a careful examination of targumic translation style will probably show that certain inconsistency of vocabulary is dependent on contextual or exegetical issues.

II. Although I believe that Klein has made his overall case quite well against the prevailing view, I have reservations about certain aspects of his methodology and the sweeping nature of his conclusions. The evidence of the individual Targumim should have been at some point, perhaps at the conclusion, separated out, so that we have not merely an overall perception of "the Targumim's" attitude towards anthropomorphism, but also a tabulation of each Targum's adherence to, or deviation from, a hypothetical standard of anti-anthropomorphism. A perusal of Klein's data indicates that certain Targumim do differentiate, at times, between translations of the same word in divine and human contexts, and, although this fact cannot overrule Klein's general conclusions, the student of individual Targumim would appreciate the delineation of tendencies within a particular text. Similarly, Klein's usage of the term n'lipt; 111nn or 'IlMpn n1lnnnl ("Urtargum" or "Urtranslator") creates an image of Targumim which descend from an Urtext and whose deviations from it can be measured and evaluated. There is also an implicit assumption that at an early stage of targumic development there was no concern for rendering anthropomorphisms literally. But there is no evidence to demonstrate that such was, indeed, the case; perhaps a variety of approaches to the biblical text had existed side-by-side, ab initio, in the targumic material (as may have existed in rabbinic literature). The assumption of original targumic consis- tency is one of Klein's major arguments for the apparent inconsistency in the Targumim's treatment of anthropomorphism being the result of an incomplete standardization toward anti-anthropomorphism. This notion, which seems almost as common in the field as the one Klein has disposed of in this book, should also be rethought. If we do not assume that the Targumim are derived from a uniform Urtext or from texts with uniform standards of translation, we perhaps should not define deviation from that Urtext. There is a need for clearer delineation, in all aspects of Targum studies, of the precise identity of the Targum under scrutiny: of the hypothetical "original" Targum or Targums, or of the body of targumic literature which has survived; all of the Targumim or one of them. After all the aforementioned matters have been considered, there is little doubt that Klein has probably corrected the general consensus on targumic anthropo- morphism. The Targumim as we have them still bear, to differing degrees, traces of anthropomorphism and these traces presumably indicate larger amounts of anthropomorphism in earlier stages of targumic development. What has not, however, been proven is that the sporadic presence of anthropomorphisms is due to the Targumim's not caring sufficiently about them to eliminate them entirely and systematically. Considering the nature of targumic development over the centuries, it is not really meaningful to speak of Targumim, or of metargemim, as 69</page><page sequence="6">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW willing or unwilling to take such editorial action. Perhaps, since only Onqelos seems to have been edited formally, and it has the fewest traces of anthropo- morphism, we should perhaps speak of gradually developing tendencies toward the removal of anthropomorphisms in the other Targumim. This process, what- ever its motivation or precise chronology, can be observed at various points in its history by examining the various surviving recensions of the Palestinian Targumim, assuming of course, that there was a uniform initial approach and gradual deviation from it. It is not critical, therefore, that we cannot show a systematic revision toward anti-anthropomorphism as long as the pattern of development can be clarified. Some tantalizing, and perhaps unanswerable, questions remain open even after Klein's thorough analysis. How old are these shifts to anti-anthropomorphic vocabulary and constructions in the Targumim? What, if any, is their relationship with rabbinic theology? Can we learn anything about the development of the targumic texts from the study of these patterns? Are there other areas of targumic theology (a grossly understudied area except for X'1n and the like) which exhibit patterns or processes of development akin to that of anthropomorphism? Despite what may appear to be numerous points of disagreement with both method and conclusion, I must emphasize that this is a thorough and important work. Klein's research has established a firm basis for any further study which touches on this topic. We are to be grateful that he took the trouble to read the texts instead of the encyclopedia articles and to synthesize the results of that research. Perhaps the thoroughness of Klein's work will direct Targum researchers to subjects other than anthropomorphism and HR~l. While the last word may not have been spoken on either of those subjects, enough may have been written for the moment. MOSHE J. BERNSTEIN 70 Yeshiva University</page></plain_text>
