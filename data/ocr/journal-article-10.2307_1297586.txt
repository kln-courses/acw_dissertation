<plain_text><page sequence="1">MISLEADING BUTTERFLY FICTION The Year of the Butterfly, by George Ordish. Charles Scribner's Sons, New York, 1975, 147 p., illus., $8.95 (74-21351). The Year of the Butterfly is a biological novel, which blends fact and fiction in describing one of the most fascinating of all insects, the monarch butterfly. Choosing an anthropomorphic style, Ordish describes the life history of two individuals, Timorous and Pliable, who begin their lives as the last summer generation of monarch butterflies in upper New York state. He describes their perilous migratory journey south- ward in great detail, but gives very little information about their behavior during overwintering in Mexico. With the coming of spring the two butterflies mate and begin their return migration toward the northeast, establish the new generation, and die, having, as the author states, completed a total journey of some 3,500 miles. Though laudable in his attempt to popu- larize biology, the author waxes uncriti- cal in many sections and is factually incorrect on a number of occasions. For example;,- he states that insects (as compared to vertebrates) are not the dominant form of life on earth because of limitations of their exoskeleton (p. 28); pupal development is incorrectly described (p. 29); pupal morphology is erroneously figured in a full-page pen- and-ink drawing (p. 34); and the mor- phology of the proboscis is confused with the tracheal system (p. 40). Perhaps even more disconcerting than the errors are the numerous unsubstanti- ated contentions that are advanced. For example, migratory orientation is stated to involve the following of railroad tracks (p. 86); adult male butterflies are said to have the capacity to learn not to pursue moving objects other than their own females (p. 47); females are said to mark milkweek leaves during oviposi- tion to ward off other females from laying on the same foliage (pp. 8, 105); larvae are said to emit warning scents which reinforce their warning coloration (p. 20); and learning by individual birds to avoid noxious monarchs is held even- tually to become an inherited trait (p. 21-22). Because Ordish has not maintained suf- ficient discipline and has wandered too far beyond the constraints of estab- lished facts, he has produced a book which is often misleading. Given the, amount of fascinating biology and natu- ral history that is available on the monarch, The Year of the Butterfly must be judged somewhat of a disservice to popular science writing.
