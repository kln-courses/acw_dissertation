This look is so intense, as if they were objectively or dispassionately reflecting upon their difference from us. This longing to cross over the species divide is further signified by the choice of the noun Menschenaffen to apply to the expressivity of the human- like animal gaze, for the uniquely German term for primates- man-apes- shows the slippage of the boundary between man and animal. As the second quotation indicates, however, this gaze is so incomprehensible, perhaps so unhuman-like, that it calls upon philosophy as its paramount task to think through and put into words all that is contained in it- to keep the promise, as it were, of what lies in the gaze of the animal. Philosophy thus becomes a field of inquiry less into the human being than into sentient animal being.2 This tension- between the compelling, communicative look of the animal and philosophy's central task to interpret its mystery- informs Derridas choice of the gaze of his cat to open his monumental essay "The Animal That Therefore I am." He remarks, like Adorno, that the animal appears to be "at unease with itself" and, too, that this unease is so forceful that it holds a promise to which we surrender: "since all of time and for what remains of it to come we would therefore be in passage toward surrendering to the prom- ise of that animal at unease with itself" (Derrida 2008, 3). Evoking the long history of philosophic inquiry he asks: "Since so long ago, can we say that the animal has been looking at us?" (3). Western philosophy, in his assessment, has not lived up to its calling as set forth by Adorno. Have philosophers even noticed that the animal has been looking at us, Derrida asks? Or have they perhaps chosen not to abandon themselves to this gaze? For what would such abandon entail for the calculating theoretical mind? Part of that abandon for Derrida is predicated on the intimacy of his rela- tion to his pet. This cat exemplifies Adornos paradox between the enigma of the animal gaze and its immediacy. Derrida calls it an "insistent gaze" but it can also be ambiguously "benevolent or pitiless . . . surprised or cognizant." It is the "gaze of a seer, a visionary or extra-lucid blind one" (2008, 4). But what is it that this visionary creature sees and reveals in her promise, enigmatic as all promises are? Even her familiarity does not make reading this cat any easier. And Derridas questioning is compelling precisely because he singles out a specific animal, his own pet to which he refers in the affectionate</page><page sequence="3">Alice Kuzniar • 19 diminutive, "a little cat" He insists upon the fact that "the cat I am talking about is a real cat, truly, believe me, a little cat. It isn't the figure of a cat" (6). To wit, it is the gaze of this animal that endows it with specificity or a face: Derrida and his cat stand "face to face" (4). I recall when, on a walk in the late spring in North Carolina shortly be- fore leaving the States, peering through a small dark opening in the rocks along the Eno River and seeing two glimmering, intense eyes looking out at me- those of a snake. In a truly revelatory moment, in that face-to-face encounter, even though I had lived peacefully for years with a black snake under my house and greeted her appearance every spring, I instantaneously knew that the snake I was looking at had a keen intelligence that returned the gaze. Yet when deliberating whether animals have a face, Emmanuel Lévinas, presumably never having encountered the direct gaze of a snake, meagerly responded, "I don t know if a snake has a face. I can t answer that question' (Wright et al. 1988, 172). The face and, even more so, the gaze of the animal make it no longer a mere postulate or abstraction- "the animal in theory" - but the concrete manifestation of being. Yet because the gaze is speechless and yet seems to say so much, those who would address it are charged with anthropomorphism, even sentimentality, in short, with abandon. Nicole Shukin calls Derridas ethical encounter with animal alter- ity "deeply idealistic" (2009, 37), and Steve Baker, succumbing to the "fear of the familiar" that he detects in the postmodern animal artist, says Derrida "seems to move surprisingly close to an uncritical humanism" (2000, 186). In sum, the mutual gaze is the contact point where human and animal meet, where the concrete interaction disrupts the "animal in theory," where the visual disrupts the dominance of the logos, where Lévinas stops short of attributing a face to animals, and where an attack is mounted against the so-called humanistic preoccupation with what the gaze could mean. It is not only the philosophers who look in the other direction when the animal looks at them, but a host of contemporary cultural theorists as well. If even Derrida is suspiciously regarded for uncritically lapsing into too close of a relationship with his cat- not so much because of his nakedness before her but because he occludes that she is "an engineered product of material institutions" (Shukin 2009, 38)- then the graphic artist and animal</page><page sequence="4">20# Where is the Animal after Post-Humanism? activist Sue Coe has been the particular object of mistrust on the few oc- casions when she is noticed by scholars in animal studies. Steve Baker, for instance, observes that her drawings "constantly risk being drawn close to a stylistic sentimentality in order to express the artists moral and political outrage" (2000, 178). To be taken seriously, Baker opines, she needs to devise "animal representations which might be acknowledged, with some degree of reliability, as being ethically responsible without looking aesthetically sen- timentaT (178-79). In a subchapter on Sue Coe in his book What is Posthu- manism?, Cary Wolfe asks with the same intent, "How can the looking back of the animal- and the ethical call harbored by that look- be disengaged from the humanism for which the face (and faciality generally) is perhaps the fundamental figure?" (2010, 148). He then disapproves of her paintings for seeming "to form a kind of theater calculated to produce a surefire effect' ... by playing to the audience,' as the figures in the paintings- human and animal- repeatedly look out at us, imploringly, fearfully, or sadistically, as if the entire affair inside the space of the painting is staged only for us" (152-53). He concludes the chapter: "Coe s work is humanist in a crucial sense, indeed, in the only sense that turns out to be fundamental to her work as art: it relies on a subject from whom nothing in principle , is hidden " (167). For several reasons I want to take up the gauntlet thrown down, as it were, by Baker and Wolfe, for much is at stake in terms of where animal stud- ies is today, how its various facets intersect, and in which new directions it needs to move. Broadly speaking, the hegemony of positivist, empirical stud- ies of animals has failed to take into account not only "the animal in theory," i.e., the rich intellectual debates among Derrida, Agamben, Deleuze, and de Fontenay, let alone those among Singer, Regan, and Adams, but also "the animal in art," that is, the capacity of literary and visual artistic expression to change interpretive frames. To compound the problem, the role of artistic works in the discussion of the philosophical texts (continued by LaCapra, Wolfe, Oliver, Calarco, Nussbaum, Lawlor, and others) is either nonexistent or minimal- moreover, there is an outright rejection of animal rights and ecofeminist philosophers. This compartmentalizing or strife between the disciplines in animal studies is highly problematic insofar as it bypasses what makes Coe's work and the dire situation of the factory farm so immediate</page><page sequence="5">Alice Kuzniar • 21 today. Phrases such as "deeply idealistic" and "playing to the audience," to my mind, hardly constitute a satisfactory critique of her work given its painful grappling with animal exploitation. How, in other words, are the arts and humanities to respond ethically and efficaciously to the vast suffering and waste of animal life and of environmental degradation in the second decade of the twenty-first century? How are they able to articulate the mourning and testimony needed to cope with this trauma? And how are the humanities, and in particular animal cultural studies, going to respond to an art that is unapologetically activist and refuses to depoliticize? For what does it mean to say, as Wolfe does, that Coe s artwork is "staged only for us," as if what she depicts were only spectacle and not an attempt to wrestle with how to repre- sent an immeasurable scale of death? Furthermore, with the post-humanist bent of animal studies, are its scholars tacitly participating in what Derrida singles out as an assault on compassion: "War is waged over the matter of pity" (2008, 29)? How can "ethical responsibility" possibly exclude pity and "facialality," too easily reading them as "sentimentality"? Why is there this fear of "abandon"? I propose to approach Sue Coe's graphic art anew- alongside and through Derrida, Nussbaum, Oliver, and Agamben- to ask how she redefines the parameters in which one can address compassion and respond to the face of the animal without falling into sentimentality. In what ways can it be said that her art indeed shatters the viewer s sovereign gaze? How does her art reflect upon the impossibility of witnessing in the slaughterhouses she visits? How, too, does she reopen the question of the animal gaze and its potential agency, all while avoiding the resonances of autonomy, emancipa- tion, and rationality that these terms carry? Although she immerses herself in representing the vulnerability and mortality of the domestic animal, how does she also capture and maintain its dignity and intrinsic worth? Given how fraught all these terms can be, how can one work through and past the charges against her work as mere anthropomorphism and humanism? How does she challenge us to rethink what Kelly Oliver calls our "relational- ity" with animals, all while depicting the abyssal gulf between human and nonhuman species (2009, 21)? In sum, I want to reassess Coe in order to retrace, in Derridas words, her "modalities of following" the animal (2008,</page><page sequence="6">22 • Where is the Animal after Post-Humanism? 60). Foregrounding the animal body, her dense work promises to give "the animal in theory" back some of the bodily mass, weightiness, groundedness, as well as the face that has prompted concerned ethical inquiry in animal studies from the start. For the question is no longer "What is the postmodern animal?" or "What is post-humanism?" but, more importantly, "Where is the animal after postmodernism and post-humanism?" Coe thus explores the pauses or ellipses that David Clark places between the words in the title of this special issue of The New Centennial Review : Sue Coe (1951-) is a contemporary artist of the printed page whose illus- trations have appeared on the covers of The New Yorker and The Nation. She has tackled in her hard-hitting political art apartheid, AIDS, the Gulf War, workers rights, and the first four years of George W. Bush's administration in Bully: Master of the Global Merry-Go-Round (2004). Dead Meat (1996), a visual and written account of Coes infiltration of numerous slaughterhouses with a foreword by The Nations Alexander Cockburn, exposes the meat industry's treatment of animals and workers. Pit's Letter (2000) is a foray into the art form of the illustrated book that in size and format suggests a children's book, devoted innocently enough to a dog narrating her story. Soon upon opening the pages, however, the reader confronts a harrowing tale of cruelty toward pets and animal testing. In Sheep of Fools: A Song Cycle for Five Voices (2005), Coe again turns to the children's illustrated book format to depict the massive shipment of live sheep under horrific conditions from Australia and New Zealand to their destination for slaughter. In 2008, the Galerie St. Etienne in New York City presented an exhibition of "Elephants We Must Never Forget: New Paintings, Drawings, and Prints by Sue Coe." One of her most recent mixed media works is entitled Murder in the Gulf on the BP Oil disaster. Although her work is represented by the Galerie St. Etienne (known for its showings of prints by German Expressionist artists), she refuses to participate in the high financial stakes of the art world. Her pieces are inten- tionally affordable to reach a wide audience and are auctioned off to support animal welfare causes. Coe is a graphic artist in the many senses of the word: not only is she an artist working primarily in drawing and printmaking along with illustrated books, but her artwork has a peculiar hold on reality and is committed to</page><page sequence="7">Alice Kuzniar • 23 documentary rendering, however shocking and vivid these pictures are. She herself calls her art "reportage art" and "visual journalism,"3 and refers to herself as a "gutter journalist" (Burchard 1994, N47). Her work thus is ener- gized by a tension between the artistic and real, subjectivity and objectivity, the ineffable and truth, and compassion and the shock of the real. Despite the documentary impetus behind Dead Meat , for instance, she does not at- tempt to be realistic in the sense that she makes no effort in the traditional style of animal portraiture to reify animals as natural. Instead, the viewer is aware of the sketchiness and swiftness with which she draws as well as of the spectrality of the black-and-white images. Indeed, preferring newspapers to magazines to display her work, she opines, "I love the immediacy, the urgency, and the way everything is a little smudgy" (Sherill 1994). Despite her evocation of comix art, she does not share in the techno-fetishism that characterizes many cartoons or that is prevalent in the animations of the animal-robot; nor do her animals possess any totemic or magical function. As opposed to Bakers verdict that her animals are overly sentimentalized, we see them in their bare life. The documentary objectivity of Coes work also approaches the graphic quality of the pornographic and the obscene, in the sense that something is revealed that society keeps hidden from view. Her work traffics in the ob- scene quality of the comix genre, that is to say, its anamorphotic distortions of the body and evocation of the Lacanian Real that fascinates the viewer. In this preoccupation with the exposed body, she belongs to the category of postmodern artists including Damien Hirst, Mark Dion, Carole Schneeman, Mike Kelly, and Nan Goldin, but without either the posttraumatic distancing of Hirst or the narcissistic wounding of Goldin. What she shares with these artists is the visual spectacle and putting on display of abjection. And yet, surprisingly, her political activism and documentary veracity can be more unsettling than these other postmodern artists, at least for Baker, which raises the interesting question of why this is the case: Why would she be decried for "playing up to an audience"- a statement that oddly suggests her work is conciliatory rather than provocative- while other contemporary artists are lauded for their affront to vision (Wolfe 2010, 152)? If Derrida has written, "responsibility carries within it, and must do</page><page sequence="8">24# Where is the Animal after Post-Humanism? so, an essential excessiveness," then it could be argued that the excessive- ness, staginess- in other words, abandon- in her works, including their intended production of strong affect (anger, empathetic shame, disgust), are fundamental to her confrontational art (1995, 272). The question, it seems, especially considering the excess of display in a Hirst or Dion, is: What is the nature of the responsibility that excessiveness carries with it? In response, one could argue that Coes failure is intentional and unavoidable: she delib- erately risks her work being seen as sentimental, aggressive, or excessively depressive. In this respect, Sue Coe and J. M. Coetzees Elisabeth Costello ap- pear as kindred spirits. In The Lives of Animals, Coetzees fictional character attempts to convey to her academic audience the urgency of animal suffer- ing, but her efforts are met with embarrassment, derision, and dismissal. When she tries to explain the origin of her intensity, she says, "When I think of the words, they seem so outrageous that they are best spoken into a pillow or into a hole in the ground, like King Midas" (1999, 69). Costello submits herself to mortification, even before her own family, with the awareness that she is bound to err in her attempts to express outrage. To her detractors Coe responds that her art, in its very urgency and excessiveness, must similarly risk a kind of unfinishedness, scrappiness, and failure. In no way, having witnessed the abattoir in person, can Coe return to depicting a normal or holistic world, whatever that would be. Nor could her art aestheticize or sentimentalize suffering, for her world is thoroughly a contaminated one. Instead she faces the problem, to quote Andreas Huyssen from another context, of how to represent such "unimaginable, unspeakable, and unrepresentable horror" (1993, 259). Coe writes reluctantly in Dead Meat: The Holocaust keeps coming into my mind, which annoys the hell out of me. I see this reference in so many animal rights magazines. Is this the comforting measuring rod by which all horrors are evaluated? My annoyance is exacer- bated by the fact that the suffering I am witnessing now cannot exist on its own, it has to fall into the hierarchy of a Tesser animal suffering.' . . . Twenty million murdered humans deserve to be more than a reference point. I am annoyed that I don't have more power in communicating what I've seen apart from stuttering: 'It s like the Holocaust.' (1996, 72)</page><page sequence="9">Alice Kuzniar • 25 Coe, in the company of Derrida,4 Isaac Bashevis Singer,5 and Coetzee,6 haz- ards this terrible comparison in full realization of its impropriety, reductive banality, and yet inevitability. Not only is each of these respective atrocities "unspeakable," but their comparison is as well. Coe takes recourse then to a higher authority, Adorno, and inscribes his words on a 2009 woodcut: "Auschwitz begins whenever someone looks at a slaughterhouse and thinks they are only animals."7 For the Nazis the death camps were not considered exceptional institutions; horrific for humanity is that such murder could be committed as if it were an everyday, commonplace occurrence. The assem- bly-line mass slaughter of animals, too, is considered unexceptional; but in contrast to the normalized mass killing in Auschwitz, the industrialized meat industry today has yet to be acknowledged as horrendous by society at large. The pressing questions, then, to which Coe s work attempts to respond are: What is the ethical space in which we can live knowing of this "eternal Treblinka" (Singer, in Patterson 2002)? What do mortality and morality mean in the wake of it? How is contemporary art to express its ethical obligation? Or, as Kelly Oliver has written with respect to animals: "The ethical question that asks us to confront our own responsibility is not whether they can suffer but how we respond to the suffering of others" (2009, 40). As previously intimated, underlying the contestation of whether Coe fits the model of "What is post-humanist?" or "What is postmodern?" (a contestation that, as already stated, fails to address the ethics of her work) is the perception of the humanistic appeal in her work- that in its didacti- cism her art belongs to animal rights activism, and that, to forge the sym- pathetic bond between species, it indulges in anthropomorphization. But as Dominick LaCapra has intimated, we need to be wary of the charge of anthropomorphism for its "unexamined assumption that one has an un- problematic, clear-cut idea of what is distinctively human and that there is indeed a decisive criterion that divides the human from other animals . . . (The charge of anthropomorphism may even serve as a screen for an- thropocentrism)" (2009, 154). At a fundamental level, it seems to me, Sue Coes art is antianthropocentric and participates in the deconstruction of the carno-phallogo-centric subject. Given the position of her critics on her apparent humanism, it bears emphasizing that it is not a matter for her</page><page sequence="10">26# Where is the Animal after Post-Humanism? of giving animals parity with humans or equal rights, as if man were the perfect measure of all things.8 In her graphic worlds the human race can be rough and brutal, as well as lacking in agency and rights. From the mentally challenged girl in Pits Letter who is taunted by boys, themselves products of violent family abuse, to the meat-processing workers in Dead Meat who are maimed by the machines they operate, Coe demonstrates the falsity of as- suming that humans are "abled." In contrast to Wolfe and Baker, then, Donald Kuspit observes in Coe s bleak art a lack of "optimistic humanism" and "no false classical humanism" (2000, 180, 181). Her work possesses a "lethal clar- ity" where human (and we could add animal) "figures are reduced to puppets in a drama and space beyond their control" (182, 181). At this juncture, it is crucial to remember, as Kuspit does, that Coe de- liberately echoes the artistic tradition of German Expressionism decried as degenerate and antihumanistic by the Nazis. At the exhibit s opening, Hit- ler, upholding the distinction between animal and human being, attacked the Expressionists for their fabrication of "misshapen cripples and cretins, women who can only provoke abhorrence, men who are closer to animals than to humans, children who, were they to so live, must be perceived as cursed by God" ( Entartete "Kunst" 1937, 16, 26-28; my translation). In other words, Coe works within a tradition that serves to deconstruct the deadly presupposition that humans, and only certain human beings, are entitled to exceptional status and rights. Moreover, Coe challenges the very signi- fying field of "parity," which includes a legalistic, economic discourse that treats nonhuman life as if it could be weighed, measured, and calculated as if property. The massive loss of animal life in factory farming is too im- mense to be calculable. The magnitude of suffering and death that she tries to capture in the unending rows of animals destined for human consumption demonstrates instead an indebtedness to animal sacrifice that goes beyond any measurement or economic calculation of interest, let alone price at the meat counter. There is, moreover, something else that is never weighed: for these crimes, there is no trial, no judgment, no indictment of guilt (maybe a guilty conscience for some), no shame, only impunity. Despite this lack of justice, still, once mankind is no longer the ideal against which animals are opposed, weighed, and excluded, the binary</page><page sequence="11">Alice Kuzniar • 27 thinking that separates them can begin to collapse. This is not to say that animals inevitably become humanized or are seen through an anthropocen- tric lens but, rather, that other terms of "relationality" need to be invented (Oliver 2009, 21). It is here that Coe joins forces with the strongest voices in animal theory- Jacques Derrida, Martha Nussbaum, Kelly Oliver, and Gior- gio Agamben. Arguably one of the most powerful statements in this regard is Derridas on mortality as "the most radical means of thinking the finitude that we share with animals, the mortality that belongs to the very finitude of life, to the experience of compassion, to the possibility of sharing the pos- sibility of this non-power, the possibility of this impossibility, the anguish of this vulnerability and the vulnerability of this anguish" (2008, 28).9 Oliver comes to a similar conclusion when she shifts the ground "from an ethics of sameness, through an ethics of difference, towards an ethic of relationality and responsivity " (2009, 21). Seconding Derrida, she writes that we need to look at how "the suffering of humans . . . and animals are intimately con- nected" (45). And Leonard Lawlor, writing on Derrida, observes: "Understood through this loss or privation of singularity, life therefore must be conceived in terms of powerlessness. There is a kind of mortalism within life" (2007, 5). Theirs is a position that goes back in the Western philosophical tradition to Porphyry who, in On Abstinence from Killing Animals , wrote, "Thus the bodies of almost all animals are like ours as regards illness," and, "It is the nature of animals to have perceptions, to feel distress, to be afraid, to be hurt, and therefore to be injured" (2000, 85, 91). The Roman philosopher thus concludes about the distinctions between human and nonhuman animals: "Let it be agreed, then, that the differences are a matter of more and less, not of complete deprivation, nor of a have and a have-not" (85). To invert Heideggers formulation, what Coe portrays, then, as the human-animal commonality is their both being "poor in the world." Their shared woundedness works on various levels in her art- from the thema- tization of empathy and voicelessness to her own halting narratives and wounded drawing. This shared vulnerability can perhaps be best illustrated by the very rhyming of the names Pit and Pat in the graphic storybook Pits Letter. Narrator of her own lifes tale, Pit is the pit bull belonging to a boy named Pat Watson, who had saved her as a puppy from the streets. Pat and</page><page sequence="12">28 • Where is the Animal after Post-Humanism? his playmates get into mischief, and the dog, accompanying them, witnesses their cruelty to insects, rape of a mentally handicapped girl, terrorizing of a homeless woman, and pit bull fighting. In school Pat performs best in biology class when students have to cut up frogs, and he has great faith in scientific experiments, the irony of which later proves to be his demise. On an unsuc- cessful hunting trip, Pat s father, drunk and angry, raises his fist to strike his son, whom he regards as a loser in any case, whereupon Pit defends her friend, with the result that she is abandoned by the roadside. Captured by the pound, Pit is then rescued from deaths row by Eden Technologies Ltd., a laboratory that experiments on animals, trying to isolate, for the defense department, the gene for empathy. Pat suddenly reenters Pits life as one of the technicians, is inadvertently scratched by one of the monkeys, falls ill, and himself becomes the object of gruesome experiments. Pit, who also has died in the meantime, watches as a ghost over his grave. More, though, can be said about the significance of the protagonists name in this illustrated book. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, "pit" means "a hole dug in the ground for a dead body; a grave." With this definition in mind, Pit represents the dead bodies of animals (ab)used by hu- mans in genocidal numbers. But "pit" can also mean "an abode of evil spirits and lost souls; hell, or some part of it, conceived of as a sunken place, or a dungeon or place of confinement." Sue Coe's comix art depicts this nether world where animal life is hellish and confined and where, as Pit muses, "if we believed in their God the devil would look like a human being."10 And although it is a surreal , dystopic universe that Coe depicts, reflected in the manneristic allegory of many of her larger, colored canvases (Kuspit calls them "grand-manner" paintings [2000, 179]), this is a hell that millions of factory-farmed animals experience every day in real life, as Coe s website reminds us with its ticker-tape counting off the "number of animals killed in the world by the meat, dairy, and egg industry since you opened this page" (Sue Coe Direct). For Agamben, one could say, the Open resembles a pit: it is an abyss of emptiness that separates human from animal, but it is also the place where, as in Coe, human and animal meet in their common frailty. He writes at the close of The Open , "To render inoperative the machine that governs</page><page sequence="13">Alice Kuzniar • 29 our conception of man will therefore mean no longer to seek new- more effective or more authentic- articulations, but rather to show the central emptiness, the hiatus that- within man- separates man and animal, and to risk ourselves in this emptiness' (2004, 92). Agamben links this "zone of non-knowledge' where we stand in our shared "concealedness" to "the saved night," a phrase from Walter Benjamin evoking the redemptive qualities of the artwork (91).11 LaCapra has written that "the approach taken in The Open does not itself open onto a possibly critical and politically pertinent inquiry into what Agambens thought might be taken to invite" (2009, 172). As such, I would argue that Sue Coe clears the space of the Open, this pit of emptiness and night in which we need to risk ourselves; Adorno, in conversation with Horkheimer, understood this as a political space in which we as humans are all implicated. Only via the nonknowledge of the artwork (in the sense of humility discussed above with respect to Coetzee) can Coe redeem the night. It is this humbleness in her artwork that I want now to comment on further. "The Open' also suggests an opening, exposure, or, in other words, a woundedness (although Agamben does not venture in this direction). But it is not only the animals and very often the working class that in Coe's drawings suffer such woundedness, but the artist herself. She notes that the animals are deprived of voice: in Pit's Letter their vocal cords are cut so that their screams cannot be heard. Their mouths are open but no sound is emitted, no voice is heard, just as, corralled into the slaughterhouses, their deaths cannot be seen. "Six billion animals are killed each year in the United States for human consumption. The suffering of these animals is mute. For the defenseless, the gentle, the wounded, the ones who cannot speak, life consists of indescribable suffering" (Coe 1996, 63). On seeing tongues cut out lying in a cart, her traumatized reaction is to hear an obsessive voice in her head: "I keep thinking of the phrase, 'They cut out their tongues, to stop them talking"' (53). But in addition to the animals silencing, Coe reminds us of her own silence and despair on several levels. She writes in Dead Meat : "to wit- ness what is concealed forces one into more isolation and solitude" (72). An unwanted witness at the abattoir, she appears in a place where she shouldn't be and that is sequestered from prying eyes. Being unable to intervene, even to protest, she cannot jeopardize her undercover status but has to resort</page><page sequence="14">30# Where is the Animal after Post-Humanism? surreptitiously to sketching quickly what she sees there: "Sheep bleat even after their throats are cut. They writhe. Every part of my being says to stop it, save them, which is impossible. I think of art' and how I am going to draw it all. Will anything change when people see?" (96). Any relation to the animals in this immediate situation is spurious. Even when she and her friend Andy reach out to "stroke their faces," they feel like "Judases" (109). Her narratives therefore are minimalistic, whether they take the form of the simple, direct voice of Pit or the staccato-style reportage that ac- companies the illustrations in Dead Meat Steven Laycock has written, "If silence or incomprehensibility is the expression of the animate Other, we must nonetheless attend" (1999, 279). Coe realizes the importance of listen- ing to the animal s silence and conveying it in a manner that is true to it. In bearing witness to something impossible to see, her work registers this nonregistering.12 In her oeuvre there is thus no middle ground between the minimal sketch and her allegorical, flamboyant larger canvases that take recourse to echoes of Pieter Breugel and Hieronymus Bosch to will a cosmic, religious dimension to the animal sacrifice. Here the melancholic, desperate hyper-signification only underscores its lack of voice or influence. As a graphic artist who draws by hand, Coe s own bodily traces are key to her art. Her hand registers the smudginess she prefers in newsprint to the glossy magazine finish. It would not be a stretch to say that in her sketches a trace of the trauma she witnesses is left behind; she shares with the animal its bodily tremors. Her drawings are nonaestheticizing, even childlike with their thick lines, displaying the awkwardness of representation. As if unable to face or dwell with the horror she witness, the marks from her hand are rapid and brief. The quickness, too, signifies a will to illustrate tirelessly and unremittingly. She has a preference for simple, black lines on the page, and even when she does color in the outlines, the dark hues suggest her lurid, im- possible task. What renders her work nonideological or nonpreachy is that there is no consolation or redemption that it can offer, which is what gives it its "blackness." Adorno writes: "To survive reality at its most extreme and grim artworks that do not want to sell themselves as consolation must equate themselves with that reality. Radical art today is synonymous with dark art; its primary color is black" (1997, 39).13 He then notes "the impoverishment</page><page sequence="15">Alice Kuzniar • 31 of means entailed by the ideal of blackness" (1997, 40). The means at Coe's disposal- the sketchpad and the pencil- are not impoverished only because they are so simple but also because they can never convey sufficiently the extremities she witnesses. And when, as indicated, she does deploy allegory, it is also because what she needs to execute in her art cannot be done in an unmediated manner. For what the animals experience must lie at an unimaginable distance from her- and hence doubly removed from us as her audience. It is hard to realize what the shock of the encounter with death on a massive scale would have been like for her. And it is this shattered subject, impacted on a visual and visceral level, who would embody, despite Wolfes contention to the contrary, the post-human subject. The gazes of the human traumatized subject are layered (I shall come to the animal gaze later). To begin, there are the workers in the slaughterhouses: inured to the violence, they invariably seem incapable of registering what is occurring to the animals. Often their backs are to the viewer, shoulders humped over, so that they are faceless and anonymous. But when their eyes are revealed, they seem dulled and expres- sionless. A man wields a whip in Feed Lot and Stockyard , but he above all is unable to see the suffering of the animal. That leaves Sue Coe to be the only one actually to behold these atrocities and the only one to bear that burden, as well as the heavy obligation to communicate such eye-witnessing to others, to an audience unwilling to acknowledge such a vision, of the un- imaginable made visible. Coe's drawings ultimately leave the viewer himself or herself traumatized by an impossible call to action. The ticker-tape tally, mentioned above, of animals killed in the food industry, focuses on the present moment, as does Coes reportage, but her work also serves the Janus-faced purposes of remembrance and engage- ment-alluding to unrecorded animals sacrificed in the past and those from the future. It is not only the one life lost that she records but the many. In the quick strokes of the pen that the animals are often reduced to when she depicts them en masse, she repeats the unrepeatability of this dreadful- ness, demonstrating the incommensurability between the killing and any representation of it. She thereby shows the affront of the enormity of fac- tory farming to human comprehensibility, paradoxically even though such</page><page sequence="16">32# Where is the Animal after Post-Humanism? farming is considered perfectly normal, ordinary practice. Yet it is precisely because of the immeasurablity of the industrial sublime that her focus on the individual animal, often simultaneously in one drawing, takes on a moral imperative: she reminds us that these animals are killed each one at a time. In Feed Lot , for instance, innumerable cows in a field recede to where on the horizon a large black factory looms; the work gives a sense less of depth than of sheer verticality (see illustration). The cows in the distance become white dashes on the page and then countless dots. But in the immediate foreground, discrete bovine faces appear. Is this individualization of the ani- mal synonymous with anthropocentrism? To return to the issue with which I opened this contribution, what role does the animal gaze play within Coe s construction of the animal as an individual life? What would it mean to reinsert into the equation the question of animal agency, even if it is merely the desire to escape? At this juncture, I wish to return to the issue of animal rights raised earlier in this essay, but turn from Derridas and Agambens focus on vulnerability and mortality to Martha Nussbaums position on animal agency. In Frontiers of Justice: Disability, Nationality, Species Membership , Nussbaum starts from a similar critique of rights based on an "ethic of sameness" or reciprocity rather than relationality. But rather than vulnerability she invokes a very different marker to govern a response to the question of the animal, that of dignity. Like Derrida, she argues that animal rights discourse, such as Tom Regans, misses the mark because it is based on a contractual understanding of rights, agency, and justice, that is, insofar as these are founded on a notion of reciprocity between equals.14 Nussbaum argues that animals should be granted justice, even though they themselves cannot act reciprocally and administer justice.15 Nussbaums response to animal rights is to offer instead what she calls the capabilities argument: "no sentient animal should be cut off from the chance for a flourishing life, a life with the type of dignity relevant to that species" (2006, 351). Derrida, too, has exhorted us to "move in the direction of maximum respect" (Derrida and Roudinesco 2004, 73). Nussbaum continues that dignity "treats animals as subjects and agents, not just objects of compassion" (2006, 351). Nussbaum here raises the question of animal agency, a word often</page><page sequence="17">Alice Kuzniar • 33 Feed Lot , Sue Coe (1991) associated with notions of voice, self-expression, and hence language. Derrida cautions: "It would not be a matter of 'giving speech back* to animals but per- haps of acceding to a thinking, however fabulous and chimerical it might be, that thinks the absence of the name and of the word otherwise, and as some- thing other than a privation (2008, 48). One could say that Nussbaum, like Derrida, refuses to cast nonhuman beings exclusively in terms of poverty and privation (therewith contesting the position of ecofeminism- incidentally,</page><page sequence="18">34# Where is the Animal after Post-Humanism? by no means excluded by Coe- that addresses the animal as an object of compassion). And like Derrida, Nussbaum tries to rethink agency otherwise, namely as individual life, each with its dignity but not as synonymous with the Enlightenment values of freedom, sovereignty, or equality (2006, 356). Derrida, in an often quoted passage, has also resisted encompassing animals under the undifferentiated term of "the animal," or as he puts it, animot , a neologism that signifies the confinement of the pluralistic animaux to the singular word: "The animal is a word, it is an appellation that men have instituted, a name they have given themselves the right and the authority to give to the living other" (2008, 41, 23). Derrida and Nussbaum broach the intractable problem yet also the necessity of having to imagine different mo- dalities of individuality and redefine agency and dignity for animal life. Coe accomplishes this difficult task in a variety of ways. In her animal portraiture, one sees each animal as possessing a body of inclinations, spirit, and desire for liberty, all expressions that help reconceive the notion of agency. In a sketch in Dead Meat , she thus illustrates Sheep trying to escape a pen (1996, 108). Coe does not let her viewer forget that each animal is capable of open- ness and exposure to the world, be it in its experience of its Umwelt (often only a cage!) or in its experience of death.16 She imbues animals with a sense of shame, exposure, and nakedness (signified, for instance, by their cring- ing), terms that suggest a kind of self-consciousness or subjectivity. Tattooed or tagged after birth, their corporeal integrity is exposed and made subject to wounding, culminating in the bodies being strung up, stunned, and cut apart. In the cover illustration to Dead Meat Coe depicts a goose, sheep, cow, chicken, pig, and turkey (three of them tagged with numbers) gazing up at a cut of meat on a hook, as if in incredulity, unable to recognize themselves in this mirror. Can it be that their gaze comprehends what they see, even though in disbelief, although this comprehension is not communicated to human minds? In her attempt to imagine the animal otherwise, that is to say responsive to its Umwelt , she also explores in Pitt's Letter its capacity for dedication, em- pathy, acknowledgement of others, as well as a sense of justice - which she associates with the dog s eyes. Hers is an imaginative attempt, in Adornos terms, to figure out what lies within that gaze. Pit stands witness to the</page><page sequence="19">Alice Kuzniar • 35 fathers domestic violence, Pats friends bullying a homeless woman, and the boys sexual abuse of a young woman with Down syndrome. In these pictures Pit is to be found at the bottom corner of the canvas, much like the dogs that appear in medieval altar paintings, though in ironic contrast to those holy scenes. While Pat s gang wants Pit to attack other dogs, she looks into "mad eyes of the dog fighters, and they would be dead." Coe then invokes the theme of empathy outright: at Eden Technologies men experiment on animals for the defense department, trying to isolate the gene for empathy. The scientists are successful at the very instant that Pat recognizes Pit gazing at him. Coe captures this moment by mirroring Pats haggard face in Pits eye as his hand holds the soft muzzle in its palm. Here the face of the dog literally marks in Lévinas's words, the "curvature of inter subjective space" (1969, 291).17 John Burt, in his book Animals in Filmy observes that "the image of the animal s eye reflects the possibility of animal understanding by emphasizing animal sight. This does not mean that the eye gives any access to what is understood but it does signal the significant participation of the animal in the visual field" (2002, 71). Pits ability to respond via the gaze, indeed to witness, especially in light of how animals are ignored, underscores a type of agency. It is an expression of response-ability (to use a term by Kelly Oliver [2001, 206]), an ability to respond via the pleading gaze that encourages us not to foreclose the capacity of animals for ethics. If I might tell the story of my first whippet, Tania, on the Berlin subway: when I lived in Berlin in the 1990s (before laws were passed to muzzle dogs on the mass transit system) and in the dark winter months that descend upon the city, it struck me how fixedly and unswervingly she gazed at the people in the subway, her eyes widening incomprehensibly at exposure to their depression. With everyone else averting one another's gaze, she was the only creature in that subway car to witness and capture in her look, in her response-ability, the depth of their unhappiness. Granted, here I could be reading empathy into the look of an animal I knew intimately, but agency or, again to redefine it, a kind of self-contain- ment must also- and more importantly- be acknowledged in the animal that contains and holds onto its pain, a pain that cannot be shared with others and to which it is bound. Terror, too, can be seen in the gaze, as in</page><page sequence="20">36# Where is the Animal after Post-Humanism? The Wait , where sheep in a pen look upon the others being trussed up and their throats slit. Coe observes too in Dead Meat that the "veals can see their comrades having their throats cut. The calves eyes become practically white" (1996, 49). Lawlor writes about the animals gaze: "And does not this look imply that, like us, animals suffer?" (2007, 70). And Derrida in Memoirs of the Blind speaks of "imploration rather than vision in sight" (1993, 126). It bears underscoring here that it is an issue not so much of anthropomorphically imparting thoughts and emotions to the animal (albeit Coe imaginatively and unapologetically does so in Pits Letter) as of listening to its silence or to see a look that either recoils in terror or implores. The poignancy of Coe's pictorial renditions of animal suffering lies in great part in their silence, her nonverbal testimony resonating with their inability to be heard or recog- nized as sentient beings. Or as Kelly Oliver has exhorted: "To recognize others requires acknowledging their experiences are real even though they may be incomprehensible to us; this means that we must recognize that not everything that is real is recognizable to us We are obligated to respond to what is beyond our comprehension, beyond recognition, because ethics is possible only beyond recognition" (2001, 106). It is important to remember that it is not a question of coming to oneself or encountering oneself as a human being through the gaze of the animal. Indeed, if that gaze is not di- rected to us in a response, its blankness, bleakness, and expressionlessness become even more urgent! On one occasion, after her lecture to a packed auditorium at the Uni- versity of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, I asked Ms. Coe to sign my copy of Pitt's Letter. She inquired as to what breed of dog I owned and immediately, before I could blink an eye, had sketched a whippet shivering- a skinny little dog with squiggles all around it. Whippets, of course, tremble terribly in the cold. But the drawing also reminded me of the German expressionist painter Franz Marcs desire to "feel out the inner, quivering life of animals" (1978, 98). The notion of "quivering life" suggests a quickened, tremulous life but also a fragile, chilly one in need of comfort. Coes whippet emanated both chilliness and energy. Animal agency, too, would reside in both this psychic and physical energy as well as in vulnerability and exposure. In the chilliness of the abandoned animal, moreover, Coe reminds us that what is involved</page><page sequence="21">Alice Kuzniar • 37 in industrialized slaughter is not the assembly-line production of meat but the process of dying. Appended to one illustration in Dead Meat of a cow with disfigured, contorted limbs but eyes wide open, for instance, is the text: "downed cow, too sick to stand, she awaits slaughter. She can wait hours or days to be killed" (1996, 116-17). Finally, in a stunning paradox, despite the blackness of her work, Coe depicts this energy residing in the animals through their whiteness. In Dead Meaty they seem to glow in the darkness that surrounds them. Indeed, even in death they are startlingly white, as if the carcasses still wanted to remind us of a vital, tangible life force. In closing let me return to the debate over post-humanism and anthro- pocentrism. The modern-day slaughterhouse is precisely the place where the distinctions between human and animal are upheld, for it is the place where hens, cows, pigs, and sheep are mass-slaughtered to feed human beings. But it is also the site where our capacity to respond to suffering is called into question- and hence the site at which our humanity is called into question. In the seriality of the feedlots, battery pens, and slaughterhouses, inhumanity toward animals reaches its zenith. To respond to the question "What is it like to be an animal?" is therefore not to indulge in anthropocentric sentimental- ity or to regard it as fundamentally unanswerable, as did Thomas Nagel. As Steven Laycock has written: "The question 'What is it like . . . ?' . . . cannot be foreclosed" (1999, 271). If Coe resurrects the animal in the drawing of her pen, giving it back its body, face, and gaze and making it tangible, perhaps she recognizes that such an anthropomorphism, if it be deemed as such, needs to be ventured, though it cannot buy back a humanity now forever forfeited.

"It will therefore be necessary to reduce, little by little, the conditions of violence and cruelty toward animals, and, to that end, to modify, on a large historical scale, the conditions of breeding, slaughter, treatment en masse, and of what I hesitate (only in order not to abuse the inevitable associations) to call a genocide, in a situation where, in fact, the word would not be so inappropriate" (Derrida and Roudinesco 2004, 73).

Derridas criticism of animal rights discourse is based on a suspicion of the baggage accompanying the concept of rights, which, he says, "depends massively on this Cartesian moment of the cogito, of subjectivity, freedom, sovereignty. Consequently, to confer or to recognize rights for animals is a surreptitious or implicit way of confirming a certain interpretation of the human subject, which itself will have been the very lever of the worst violence carried out against nonhuman living beings" (1995, 65). 9. This commonality betweens species is not taken into account by Lévinas, Kristeva, or Butler in their discussions of abject, precarious life. 10.

Here I take issue with Wolfe's charge that her work "relies on a subject from whom nothing in principle, is hidden " (2010, 167). I would agree that, "[f]or what must be witnessed is not just what we can see but also what we cannot see- indeed, that we cannot see. That too must be witnessed" (167). But I argue here that she accomplishes precisely this task! 13. Kuspit refers to the "abysmal abstract blackness of her space, and the way her scenes tend to exist as snatches of representation that seem about to sink into the blackness as if into quicksand" (2000, 179). 14.

It should be pointed out that most people living with a cat or dog can testify to the opposite- to the capacity of these pets for a sense of fair and just treatment. As if this aptitude needed scientific documentation as proof, Marc Bekoff in The Emotional Lives of Animals (2007) has amassed anecdotal evidence of such to convince a broader popular audience as well as his fellow biologists. 16.
