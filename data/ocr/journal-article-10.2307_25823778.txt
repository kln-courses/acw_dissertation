<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Institutional Approach PAUL MEADOWS The author is chairman, Department of So ciology and Anthropology, State University of New York, Albany. It was the romantic critics of the French Revolution who made Western intellectuals aware of the presence and role of institutions in a period of social change. Their appeal to established institutions against the "utopian" excesses of the Revolution was an appeal to tradition against novelty. Historically, "insti tution" has been equated with "establish ment." Indeed the phrase "The Establish ment," as a recent writer in the New Yorker has pointed out in a genealogy of the phrase, singles out key institutions for favorable-or more customarily, invidious-attention. In strumentally, institutions are regarded as a de vice for social problem-solving, as a "sort of manufacturing plant," as James Feibleman has put it, for social solutions. It is possible to distinguish two directions of use of the concept "institutions," as soci ologists Horton and Hunt, among others, have pointed out.1 One emphasis stresses the population aspect of an institution: it is an organized group of people. The other empha sis accents the behavioral aspect: it is an or ganized system of behavior. The latter usage dwells on the cultural, systematism, and con tinuing aspects of institutions as going con cerns. The former highlights the organization al, administrative, and constructional aspects of institutions as operational concerns. In both senses randomness and unpredictability have been discounted in favor of routine and expectedness. Institutionalizing is a structur alization process, as sociologist J. O. Hertzler has suggested.2 We may identify two major kinds of struc turalizations (i.e., institutionalizations) of so cial response-those of functions and those of normative concerns or orientations. The first starts from the premise of the functional 1 P. B. Horton and C. L. Hunt, Sociology (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1964), Ch. IX. 2 Cf. his Society in Action (New York: Dryden, 1954). 213</page><page sequence="2">SPRING, 1970 RQ differentiations of social experience and em braces an enormous structuralization of the fundamental functional sectors of social be havior-familial, economic, political, reli gious, educational, and so forth. The second begins with the pervasive system of norms and values such as characterize any given so ciety, a system existing in the minds of the members of a society in such varied forms as customs, myths, legends, taboos, and proverbs, and retrieved for use by them, upon suitable signaling, as judgments and definitions of be havior. Definitely, then, the process of institution alization may be viewed as the structuraliza tion of social behavior. The nature of this process may be conceptualized (1) historical ly, as an establishment process; (2) bio-so cially, as an organization of desired or pre scribed or even familiar responses among hu man beings; (3) psychocultural^, as the telic or synergic management of collective inter ests, functions, and norms; and (4) ideologi cally, as a means of bridging the gap of inter generational socialization experiences as well as the gap between proclaimed norms and perceived practices. INSTITUTIONAL BEHAVIOR What are some common properties of in stitutional behavior? Several perspective definitions are avail able. Institutional behavior may be seen in terms of growth, establishment, and formal ization in the number, variety, and internal complexity of social routines. Institutions are systems of social habits; they represent the clustering and clumping of collective adjust ments, forming persisting nodes of structures of social behavior. Habits, the core of these clusters, may be thought of as relatively suc cessful "solutions" to relatively common and significant social "problems." Institutions thus have a heavy pragmatic content; indeed, their very intergenerational persistence is widely hailed among societies everywhere as ipso facto evidence of their sta bility, even of their reliability, and often of their inevitability. Institutions may also be conceived of as clusters of social roles, which may be defined very simply-which is to say, very unusually-as clusters of familiar ways of doing things. Some clusters of roles are un boundaried and open; some are permissively available to all; and some are prescriptively reserved, accessible through high degree of training and licensure. An institution as a sys tem of functionally oriented roles is a strati fied system of such roles, with roles varying in prestige, influence, power. A widening ag gregation pattern may be noted here; from clusters of acts known as customs, to clusters of customs as roles, and to clusters of roles as institutions. Institutional behaviors emerge and persist around perceived social functions; it is for this reason that Hertzler regards institutions as "very numerous, running not only to doz ens but even into hundreds," some large-scale, some recent, some regional, some voluntary, and so forth. They may be grouped or classi fied according to certain perspective modali ties: e.g., political, economic, expressive, in tegrative, familial, and so on. They may also be seen as sub-systems of a society-institu tional systems, designating, connoting, inter relating, integrating, coordinating, and in gen eral patterning the behavior of members of the society. Their interconnexity occurs through functional operations: interlocking functions bring into play interlocking of structures; thus we may talk about religion in terms of its political, economic, esthetic kin ship and other institutional patterns. The institutional analysis of social behavior may also be described in terms of typical tendencies or sequence patterns. First, there is the accumulative tendency of institutions. Ac cumulation here is not merely an additive concept; it is also selective, substitutive, con densing, transforming, revising, censoring, re producing, elaborating, transmogrifying. Sec ond, institutional behavior may be said to have a legitimizing tendency. The past is linked to the future, and it has therewith its saints and its devils: institutional apologetics has both its hagiography and its demonology. In other words, the normative function of in stitutional behavior is salient, aggressive, de manding, and typically dichotomous. Again, institutional behavior is character ized as having a tendency toward develop ment through interaction. Early in this cen 214</page><page sequence="3">SPRING, 1970 RQ tury famed American sociologist Charles Cooley put the point memorably. "The great institutions are the outcome of that organiza tion which human thought naturally takes on when it is directed for age after age upon a particular subject, and so gradually crystal lizes into definite forms-enduring senti ments, beliefs, customs, and symbols."3 Coo ley's quondam student, Walter Hamilton, phrased the matter in a slightly different way. "In fact, as an aspect of a continuous social process an institution has no origin apart from its development. It emerges from the impact of novel circumstances upon ancient customs; it is transformed into a different group of usages by cultural changes." It is often only in time, perhaps only in crises, that we see that "in institutional life current realities are usually to be found behind an cient forms." There is a syncretism in institu tions, and the borrowed nucleus "is liberated," as Hamilton observes, "from its cultural ma trix and takes on the character of the usages for which it is set down."4 For example, the "higher law," used to legitimize popular rev olution against irresponsible though divine monarchs, became the sanction for judicial review of legislation by popular assemblies. This latter observation prompts the gen eralization that there is in institutional be havior a tendency toward conversion, or of transformation. As an adjustment system evolved, transmitted, preserved, agglutinating, the institution is necessarily flexible, inevitably subject to strain and crisis. Thus, the ghost of justice by combat still haunts the courtroom; the court itself, traditionally a judicial struc ture, becomes an interpretive agent of reality. Equity, an informal structure of justice at first, is now a system of law. This drift toward conversion is related to another tendency of institutional behavior the proneness toward reification, toward or thodoxy, toward bureaucratization of norms and meanings and roles, toward aggressive boundary-maintenance and security systems, and toward the specialization of the gate 8 Social Organization (New York: Scribner's, 1909), Chapter 28. 4 "Institutions: Stability and Change," Encyclo pedia of Social Sciences (New York: Macmillan, 1932). keeping function (and authority) in persons and creeds and sacred frames of acceptances. Fortunately, for man, institutions tend to be great nets of conceptualization into which many wandering forms of life and thought stray and are caught. By definition, institu tions are viable: societies tend to institution alize as well as to informalize the internaliza tion of novelty. Finally, institutional behavior displays-at least in the modern history of the West-a tendency toward probing the unknown and the unmapped. The institution becomes a sup ply base for teams of frontiering investigators who return from new wildernesses with infor mation taken from reality and which they codify in terms of institutionalized familiari ty. This collaborative probing of the universe, so dramatically successful in the natural sci ences, may be regarded as one of the many fruits of the contemporary and fast-develop ing institutionalization of science, an institu tionalization which took place earlier (for many reasons) in religion, government, the family, the economic order. Seen as an ac celerating process, it suggests that change no less than stability can indeed be institution alized. SOME ANALYTICAL DIMENSIONS OF INSTITUTIONAL BEHAVIOR Because "institution" is a public word, be cause people have a public behavior, institu tions tend to be linked as image, if not as fact, with buildings, equipment, artifacts, devices. Moreover, each institutional system brings to gether the elements and patterns of the cul ture of a society in its own way and for its own uses, a phenomenon which may be called variable institutional crystallization. Being such a special crystallization of the cultural behavior of a society, the institutional shape will vary from one institution to another, from one time to another, and obviously from one society to another. Moreover, the institu tional shape, being a form for as well as a form of social experience, tends to have an institutional momentum characterized by in ertial acceleration through social space and time. New institutions have the advantage of some freedom from this momentum from the past, so that such new institutions as those of 215</page><page sequence="4">SPRING, 1970 RQ science-e.g., industrial research laboratories -can form drastically novel institutional shapes, a freedom which older institutions may have to initiate revolutionary struggle to achieve (as our current college campus strug gles portend perhaps). In the closing part of this discussion insti tutions will be considered as a behavioral complex of people, roles, effort, norms, equip ment, and symbols, an inventory first sug gested by Charles Cooley and little improved upon in the subsequent literature. These be havioral components of the institutional com plex will be regarded as a corresponding set of analytical dimensions-associative, drama tists, economic, normative, instrumental, and communicative, each of which will be dis cussed in turn. 1. The Associative Dimension. An institu tional system represents, we have said, a structuralization of functions. But an institu tional system also represents in every case an association of human beings sharing and par ticipating in this structuralization, varyingly devoted to it, masters and servants of it, and in varying degrees identified with it. The total institutional network of a society provides, in each institutional system instance, a set of fa miliar or routine occasions for the transac tional behaviors of its participants. Each institutional system tends in time to develop its own specialized transmission agen cy or agencies: in science it is the scientific paper; in education, the classroom-library laboratory complex; in religion, the ritual and sacraments. As enlargement and differentia tion of the transmission agency occur through the many varieties of accumulation motives and mechanisms familiar to each institutional system, specialized functionaries, skilled in and devoted to the transmission agency, tend to emerge and to protect the agency and in time to monopolize it. This exclusive tenden cy forms part of the background for public struggles for the return of the transmission agency to easy public access (i.e., "democra tization") or to its original condition ("prim itivism") or to its inherent perfectibility ("perfectionism"). Moreover, as enlargment of the transmission agency takes place, meas ures for simplification, storage, retrieval, and widening utilization of its information con tent become the object of public or profes sional demand and effort. Moreover, each in flux of institutional participants, native-born to the system or in-migrants, has its own ex pectations of and experience with the institu tional system, thus revitalizing it. For those who are anxious about this process there is the unequivocal fact that institutional roman ticism becomes in time institutional classi cism; avant garde becomes academic, just as on occasion the folkic is hailed with fashion able enthusiasm as the new avant garde. 2. The Dramatistic Dimension. A number of social scientists have given memorable por trayals of institutional behavior in terms of the metaphors of human drama. The key word in this dramatistic presentation of hu man institutions is role. Role theory has its backgrounds actually in the evolutionism of the nineteenth century. Abundantly docu mented by botanists and zoologists in plant and animal communities, the presence of fundamental differentiation in human socie ties has been attested to and received taxo nomic blessing from historians, economists, theologians, anthropologists, business admin istration writers, all of whom have pointed to a variety of differentiated orders-differentia tion of function, authority and responsibility, with corresponding clustering and ordering of roles. Like the classical Greeks, these observ ers of social aggregations have emphasized the historical emergence and growth of a ver tical dimension in this generic process of dif ferentiation. This vertical tendency of the differentiation process has been described under many ru brics-hierarchicalization, bureaucratization, and professionalization of behavior functions within a given institution and throughout the institutional network of a society. In its more academic phase the verticalization theme has received a variety of conceptual treatments; typologies of roles have been formulated; managerial perfection of the pattern of roles is urged and demonstrated; role ethicizing is engaged in; the logistical or even exponential curves of role multiplication are proclaimed (as by Parkinson); trade schools for role spe cialization are developed; and role training models are formulated; "The Method" belongs no more to acting than to accounting or to 216</page><page sequence="5">SPRING, 1970 RQ public administration. Idolatrous cults of role analysts develop, depending on taste or sec tarian impulse or even status escalation on the part of the ambitious young who, like medieval religionists before them, select their patron saint for somewhat the same set of reasons. Role ideologists are part of the for mulation of institutional functions. Detailing the desiderata of institutional role behavior must include the fact that each in stitutional system has its own typical or mod al institutional role complex, which must be learned, respected, used, supported, and re membered. Each system has its own role tra ditions, its own role models, which are com memorated in story, song, precept, and cere mony, and its own hagiography and demon ology of role performers. Each institutional system identifies approved role techniques, and creates situations of role observation for professional study and public appreciation of role virtuosity. Each institutional system has its men of knowledge who themselves play a variety of roles-epistemic (as systematizers, innovationists, and traditionalists of knowl edge) and instrumental (as sages, advisers, administrators, priests, prophets, technicians, professionals, intellectuals, and rebels). 3. The Economic Dimension. It is no mere coincidence that the first great discussions of institutional behavior, those of Plato and Ar istotle, took place in the context of economic (that is, political economic) considerations. For with the earthy immediacy of all prag matic concerns-how, after all, can we have or build a good society?-they see the insti tutional system as a social enterprise, en gaged in the production of some good as well as some goods. (It is only in highly special ized economies that goods become separated from the good, or even that the good life be comes synonymous with the goods life.) The productive character of the institutional un dertaking (by whatever name it is known) is unmistakable and unavoidable. The parame ters are relatively simple: scarcity of re sources, abundance of needs, and the institu tional imperative (as dictated by such desid erata of viability as human vulnerability, be havior reproducibility, organizational efficien cy, and goal realization) of equilibrating re sources and demands. Plato and Aristotle were partial to size as a moderator: numbers must be balanced with nature. Size has con tinued to be a major variable particularly since the days of Malthus. However, the Mal thusian imperative that "N" equal "N" was reformulated by post-Malthusian optimists as a revolutionary strategy: i.e., Numbers = f (Resources times Economic Culture). The plenitude of nature was paralleled by the plenitude of culture, which was conceived of as a conceptual-technological continuum not finite but stretching unlimitedly. Students of institutional behavior have, since the days of the post-Hegelian euphoria, contracted the institutional adjustment proc ess into the relatively finite parameters of in vention and creativity, and they have, in addi tion, come to understand the enormous mod erating effect exercised by "the standard of living" (or more accurately, by . "the cultural pattern of prevailing insistences"). The basic economic formula now appears somewhat as follows : Numbers f \ ^esources x Economic Culture -1 I Culture Pattern of Prevailing I L Insistences J This demographic-economic equation is thought of as characterized by fairly elastic variables. Indeed, it is the matrix of a set of action strategies: (1) resource development, (2) cultural elaboration, (3) direct popula tion management, and (4) manipulable pat terns of expectations. In a sense, the econom ic formulation has thus returned to original home in political economy. 4. The Normative Dimension. Institutions are not only behavioral patterns of expecta tions; they are also behavioral patterns of ac ceptances. As such, whether viewed as soci etal expectations or as personal acceptances, these perspectives on institutions come, like a pair of scissors, to a cutting point in the no tion of control, or power. Power as a desideratum of theory is also a desideratum of policy. For power or control underlines an asymmetry of human relations, a differential capacity of human beings to choose and thus to act. And the problem of choice and of action is a problem of values of the norms of the behaviors of choice and action. Institutional theory has always carried 217</page><page sequence="6">SPRING, 1970 RQ a heavy luggage of ethicizing comment; there has seldom been any serious logicizing diffi culty in acclaiming any given institutional be havior as just, good, true, or even beautiful (or "beautiful-black"). The angry and hostile rejection of institutional behavior clothes it self in the garments of justice with the same facility with which the stirring pleas for its acceptance are made. Each institutional system organizes its own pattern of expectations and acceptances. Moreover, each stylized role within the in stitutional system must of necessity evolve and crystallize its own particular set of norms. In both instances conflictive tensions arising from the loyalties to self and non-self must be stipulated as an inherent property of the system and of its differentiated roles. The possibilities for rationalizing (in the func tional sense) and ethicizing (in the normative sense) the institutional system or the institu tional roles as intrinsically meritorious and as instrumentally good, or relevant (to use the currently fashionable word) are endless. Moreover, cogency for such rationalization is a function of the span of the rhetorical ap peal, which is why cosmological norms have historically maintained such behavioral su periority over those of a particular network, why network norms tend to dominate system norms, and system norms to dominate role norms. Integrity is ultimately, in this ideo logical strait-lacing of behavior, an institu tional word, a condition which is today vig orously assailed, curiously enough, by both hippies and squares. 5. The Instrumental Dimension. The in stitutional network of every society has its own quantum of instrumentations belonging to the network of a given time and place. But institutional systems within a network evolve or borrow instrumentation devices, and even systems, which are both congruous with and in contradiction with the institutional net work. For example, one might cite the ex ploitation of science-technology by business and industry in the nineteenth century in al most complete ideological defiance of the en tire institutional network of nineteenth cen tury society. Institutional theorists have occasionally been much preoccupied with what may be termed the institutional psychology of instru mentation. This concern has taken many forms. Sometimes emphasis is placed on the tropological character of instruments, as sug gested in the phrases "Stone Age Man," or "the Cross," or "The Age of Automation," "The Cybernetic Revolution," etc. Sometimes institutional theorists have been impressed with the rhetoric of the machine: the revolver as the great equalizer; armaments as weapons of peace; the library as the excarnation of mind. Sometimes instrumentation has been viewed esthetically, as in the high fashion of this year's automobiles, or the elegance of a Moroccan water-clock. Sometimes it is seen as the absolute existential condition of an insti tution, as in home ownership for the family, laboratories for science, church buildings for religion, computers for research. Sometimes instrumentation is seen, as in the language of biological metaphor, as having a symbiotic relationship with science (as in the case of the tandem accelerator), or with religion (as in the case of the crucifix or rosary), or crime detection (as in finger-printing), or medicine (as in electric shock). Sometimes instrumen tation is spurned as the enemy of taste, the death of humanism, the evil genius of art, the source of psychic perturbation in modern man. And, with enthusiastic anthropomorph ism, it has been said to have an lan vital of its own, breeding its own kind, generating its own variations. Institutional instrumentation has unques tionably fathered the growing family of ac commodative account-systems without which a modern industrial economy could not op erate. Indeed, one might easily observe that the symbolic transubstantiation of institution al reality at the hands of corporate or public accounting systems matches or even out shines in elegance, casuistry and conceptual elasticity any comparable feats in the history of theology or philosophy. Moreover, so inti mate is instrumentation with the institution that one may argue that possession of the in strumentation is indeed possession of the in stitution: to this such varied phenomena as palace guard revolutions, national sovereignty theory and ubiquitous bonding companies tes tify. 6. The Communication Dimension. Just as 218</page><page sequence="7">SPRING, 1970 RQ human social life is in fact patterned com municative behavior, so likewise communica tion is patterned symbolic behavior, occurring and formed in symbolic structures-language, etiquette and ethics, myths and rituals, codes and functions, roles and statuses, and so on. In any given society there occur institutional crystallizations of the symbolic structures of that society. Such crystallization takes the form, follows the functional imperatives, and serves the instrumental and expressive de mands of the individual institutional system. Again: in any institutional crystallization of symbolic structures there is a dichotomous or two-valued orientation: a covert pattern of meanings for insiders, a code of meanings for outsiders, a code that invariably filters out some communicable content of the institu tional system. Moreover, such institutional crystallization of symbolic structures serves as a security system. Still further: these institu tional crystallizations of symbolic structures are capable of many strategies of interpreta tion. They may be seen as sets of persuasive definitions, some archaic, some vibrant with cogent contemporaneity. They may be seen as organic systems, integrating the parts of the system, forming boundaries around it, sig naling and alerting it, propelling it. They may also be seen as great theater: an incredible manifold of plots and roles, elastic and am biguous, standardized and set, but all avail able for the dramatistic evocations of institu tional groups and persons-la com die hu maine.
