<plain_text><page sequence="1">1924 January-June ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS SUMMARIES OF ORIGINAL ARTICLES CHIEFLY IN CURRENT PUBLICATIONS SIDNEY N. DEANE, Editor Smith College, Northampton, Mass. GENERAL AND MISCELLANEOUS Springer's Art in Ancient Times.-The first volume of Anton Springer's Hand- buch der Kunstgeschichte has appeared in the twelfth edition, revised by PAUL WOLTERS, who succeeded the late Adolf Michaelis as responsible editor of this valuable work. The chapter on "the Beginnings of Art" is contributed by PAUL SCHUCHHARDT, and F. W. v. BISSING has revised the chapters on Oriental and (in part) Egyptian art, so that the work of Wolters himself begins with the treatment of Troy and Aegean art. The new edition has more pages than its predecessors and more and often better illustrations. Recently discovered monuments are not neglected, and in general the work is successfully brought up to date. The bibliography, though brief, is carefully selected, and the index is excellent.

JAMES BAIKIE, author of The Sea-Kings of Crete, is entitled Life in the Ancient East. A brief introduction on methods of archaeological exploration is followed by chapters on discoveries at Abydos, Tell el-Amarna, Thebes (including the tomb of Tutankh- amon), Lagash, Babylon, Nineveh, Troy, Mycenae, Cnossus, and Gezer.

Reports Before the Berlin Archaeological Society, 192.--At the February meeting of the Berlin Archaeological Society, new matters brought out were: the building history of the round church of St. George at Salonica, with the con- temporary Arch of Galerius, erected 306 A.D., and a colossal archaic Kriophoros on a high pedestal, at Thasos (See A.J.A. XXV, 1921, p. 297), both of these excavated by the French Army; the numerous pieces of sculpture found by the Italians at Cyrene (see A.J.A. XXVI, 1922, p. 371); 18 graves of criminals found on the shore at Phaleron, which prove the practice of crucifixion in Attica (see A.J.A. XXVIII, 1924, p. 189); the tomb of Niausta, in the region of Salonica, dated about 300 B.c., which contains a large and striking painting (2.05 x 1.11 m.) of a mounted warrior attacking a barbarian. At the April meeting, C. SCHUCH- 1 The departments of Archaeological News and Discussions and of Bibliography of Archaeological Books are conducted by Professor DEANE, Editor-in-Charge, assisted by Professor SAMUEL E. BASSETT, Professor C. N. BROWN, Miss MARY H. BUCKINGHAM, Professor HAROLD N. FOWLER, Dr. STEPHEN B. LUCE, Professor ELMER T. MERRILL, Professor JOHN C. ROLFE, Dr. JOHN SHAPLEY, and the Editors. Beginning with Volume XXIX, the Editor-in-charge of News and Discussions will be Profes- sor E. H. HEFFNER, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pa. No attempt is made to include in this number of the JOURNAL material pu blished after June 30, 1924.

Anastasia (see Taramelli, Mon. Ant. XXV) showing it to be not a temple but a well-house at which a cult of water deities was observed, and H. W. AMELUNG described a colossal figure of a goddess found in a vineyard near Ariccia, probably from a bronze original of the middle of the fifth century (perhaps by Hegias) and representing Artemis or Hecate; also his many very important discoveries of statues, heads, etc., in the magazines of the Vatican, which include two original heads from the metopes of the Parthenon, some Roman portrait heads, and many important replicas or missing parts of known Greek and Roman works. At the June meeting, A. IPPEL spoke on the tomb of Petosiris, chief priest at Hermoupolis, which was discovered in 1920 in the region of Tell el-Amarna, and is dated by Greek graffiti and Egyptian hiero- glyphs at about 300 B.C. The rich decoration in relief is of great value for the history of the relations of Grdeks and natives at that epoch, for the dating of other similar reliefs, for the origin of the oldest type of Isis, with the "Isis knot," for the connection of old Egyptian and Alexandrian culture, and for the architecture of the time. (Arch. Anz. 1921, cols. 244-247, 259-262, 262-264.) The Askalon Culture.-In Mannus, XV, 1923, pp. 187-206, J. BAYER discusses the chronology and character of the prehistoric culture denominated from dis- coveries in Palestine the Askalon culture. Accompanying tables illustrate the geographical extent of this culture and its relations to the successive glacial and interglacial periods. Lacquer Statues in China.-In J. Asiat. CCII, 1923, pp, 181-207. PAUL PALLIOT shows that statues in "laque seche" were not invented or first made in Japan, but were made in China, where they were called kia-tchou, at least as early as the fourth century. Oriental Objects in the Museum at Geneva.-A number of objects of Oriental art in the collection of the Museum at Geneva are described in Syria, IV, 1923, pp. 225-233 (2 pls.; 5 figs.), by W. DEONNA: (1) a gold band with a Greek inscrip- tion which M. Deonna restores Xaipe, II Tpe, obbts Af varor, "Courage, Peter, no one is immortal." A similar inscription is found on a Jewish grave stone of the fifth century in Rome. (2) A fragment of a gold band, with a representation in relief of the adoration of a sacred tree. This is probably Cypriote, of the eighth or seventh century B.C. (3) A glass cup, with the inscription, Kair&amp;XaLpe Kai ebdpalvov. (4) A series of ten Palmyrene busts, four of female subjects, six of male. (5) A Kufic inscription, said to have come from the region of Hedjaz, and dated 406 H. (1015 A.D.) Mussulman Art in the Louvre.- In Syria, III, 1922, pp. 251-260 (3 pls.; 3 figs.), IV, 1923, pp. 66-75 (4 pls.), the new galleries of Mussulman art in the Louvre are described by G. CONTENAU. A sketch of the development of the collections of the Louvre in this department is followed by an account of some of the most important objects, including sculptured stones, ivories, wood-carvings, textiles, illuminated manuscripts and miniatures, copper, glass and ceramics. Two Khans at Khan Tfiman.-In Syria, IV, 1923, pp. 134-139 (2 pls.), K. A. C. CRESWELL gives an account of two khans at KhAn TiimAn, eleven miles from Aleppo. The structures here have been noted before, but confusion has arisen in attempting to date them, because it has been assumed that they belong to a single khan. As a matter of fact, there are two khans. The second is built against the south side of the first, and has an inscription dating it in 1062 H. (1652 A.D.) This date is confirmed by the architectural character of the struc- ture, of which the plaited shafts at the sides of the windows are an especially characteristic feature. The other khan, which has a square courtyard surrounded by a plain vaulted hall of solid masonry, is dated by an inscription 635 H. (1237-8 A.D.) The Sacro Catino at Genoa.-In Ant. J. IV, 1924, pp. 11-1 8 (2 pls.), Sir MAR-</page><page sequence="3">EGYPT] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1924 447 TIN CONWAY gives a historical account of a famous relic in the cathedral at Genoa, the so-called Sacro Catino. It is a shallow six-sided bowl, once thought to have been made of a single emerald, but actually of green glass; and invested by tradi- tion with various religious associations. It was taken from a mosque at Caesarea by Genoese soldiers of the First Crusade (1101 A.D.) For centuries it was jealously guarded in Genoa; but it was taken to Paris in the time of Napoleon and was fractured on its return, an accident which conclusively proved the material of the bowl. Access to it has continued to be difficult, but at the time of the Genoa Congress Mr. Lloyd George's secretary, Mr. Sylvester, secured permission to make new photographs which are published with Sir Martin's article. The bowl has been called Byzantine, but is unlike glass of demonstrable Byzantine date. It is probable that the bowl is of Hellenistic origin, a late example of glass made in the Egyptian tradition. EGYPT Egyptian Jewelry.-A catalogue of the Egyptian gold and silver jewelry in the collection of the New York Historical Society, by CAROLINE RANSOM WILLIAMS, is the initial volume of a complete catalogue of the Egyptian antiquities in the Museum of the Society. In a detailed and thoroughly documented introduction, Mrs. Williams reviews the references to jewelers and their art in Egyptian texts, enumerates the metals, stones, and other materials used by the Egyptian jewellers, and describes the different kinds of jewelry worn by the Egyptians, distinguishing between those which were intended for the use of the living, and those designed as ornaments for the dead. Special attention is given to the geographical sources of the metals used by the Egyptians, and to the metallurgical problems presented by an analysis of the alloys, natural or artificial, which are found in their work; to the technique of Egyptian cloisonn6 and granular ornament in gold, and to the production of gold wire. The catalogue comprises a description of 160 pieces in the collection of the Historical Society, classified as follows: various early pieces, scarabs, finger rings, earrings, late amulets, statuettes of gods, miscellaneous ob- jects, the "Menes necklace and earrings." In an appendix is a list of the most important extant Egyptian jewels, with references to publications. The book is fully indexed.

The Country of Negaou.-In Syria, IV, 1923, pp. 181-192, PIERRE MONTET discusses the Egyptian texts which mention a country called Negaou. He con- jectures that this region, from which the Egyptians imported wood for their sacred boats and resin for use in embalming their dead, was in the vicinity of Byblos in Syria. Egyptian and Coptic Embroidery.-A recent monograph by M. DIMAND, pub- lished by the Museum of the History of Civilization at Lund in Sweden, is devoted to the decorative motives of the wool embroidery of Egypt in the late antique and the Coptic periods. The introduction gives a list of the principal works on this subject, with concise indication of their scope and value, and reviews the historical facts necessary for an understanding of the embroideries: the influence of the Greeks and the Romans on ancient Egypt, the early Christian church, the Coptic church, the monastic system, and the commercial relations of Egypt. The first three chapters trace the evolution of ornament of garments, describe the technique of Egyptian embroideries (the chapter on this subject is contributed by V. SYLVAN), and discuss the representation of figures in the embroideries, and the relation of figures to ornament in Coptic art. The characteristic decorative motives of the art, classified as geometric and vegetable, are the subject of the longest chapter.</page><page sequence="4">448 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VOL. XXVIII, 1924 This is followed by a discussion of the mutual influences of these two classes of ornament, and by a chapter on the development of colored design. The mono- graph is fully indexed.

DE MORGAN undertakes to prove that all the civilizations of the ancient Near East have a single root, and that the cradle of this common primitive culture is to be sought in Central Asia. The Babylonian Antediluvian Kings.-At last the list of the ten antediluvian kings has been completed through the publication by S. LANGDON in J.R.A.S. 1923, pp. 251-259, of a tablet in the Ashmolean collection. From this the proto- type of the list of Berossus may be reconstructed as follows: Babylonian Sars Berossus Sars 1.

The Invasion of Cappadocia by Sargon King of Akkad.-The German excava- tions at Tell el-Amarna in 1913 brought to light a cuneiform tablet that described the campaign of a "war-lord" against an unknown district. The significance of this was not understood until Schroeder discovered a duplicate among the tablets found at Asshur. Then it appeared that the king in question was the famous Sargon of Akkad (ca. 2800 B.C.) and that the tablet referred to an expedition against the Hittite empire. A thorough study of the document has been made by E. WEIDNER in Boghazkii-Studien, VI, 1922, "Der Zug Sargons von Akkad nach Kleinasien." Criticisms of this translation are given by P. DHORME in R. Bibl. XXXIII, 1924, pp. 19-32; and by W. F. ALBRIGHT in J. Soc. Or. Res. VII, 1923, pp. 1-20. A New Date for the Fall of Nineveh.-Mr. C. J. GADD of the British Museum has recently discovered and published a tablet containing a Babylonian chronicle between the tenth and the seventeenth years of Nabopolassar (616-609 B.c.). It narrates a series of campaigns of the allied Babylonians, Medes and Scythians against Assyria, ending with the fall of Nineveh in 612, instead of 606 as has hitherto been assumed. It shows further that this event did not bring the com- plete destruction of the Assyrian empire; but that Ashur-uballit rallied the relics of his armies at Harran, and continued to reign for two years, until the capture of Harran in 610. It appears also that Egypt was the ally of Assyria against</page><page sequence="5">SYRIA, ETC.] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1924 449 Babylonia, and not the enemy, as has hitherto been supposed. Whether the date of the battle of Carchemish must be placed earlier than 605, the commonly accepted year, is doubtful, since the tablet unfortunately breaks off just before that important event. (A. C. WELCH, Exp. T. XXXV. 1924, pp. 170-172; P. DHORME, R. Bibl. XXXIII, 1924, pp. 218-234.) SYRIA AND PALESTINE Six New Tell el-Amarna Letters.-In spite of the efforts of Knudtzon to make his edition of the Amarna Letters complete, six new letters have been found by F. THUREAU-DANGIN and published in R. Ass. XIX, 1922, pp. 102 sq. One is from the well-known Rib-Addi of Gebal. Another is from Shuwardata, whom we know already as a foe of Arta-Hepa, king of Jerusalem. Here both are united against the invading Sa-Gaz, or Habiru, the "Hebrews" in the wider sense of the word. In R. Bibl. XXXIII, 1924, pp. 5-19, P. DHORME discusses these tablets, their bearing on the Habiru problem, and their linguistic yield. Two Syro-Hittite Statuettes.-In Syria, IV, 1923, pp. 134-140 (2 pls.), Louis SPELEERS publishes two statuettes in the collection of Dr. Jousset de Bellesme. They were found in the course of constructions in the vicinity of Homrns, in 1893. The larger one is of silver, and represents, in a rigid and geometric form, a man wearing a high casque or helmet. The smaller one, which is a bronze, is very similar to the other. The arms of both seem to have been bent, as if to hold sceptres or weapons. Since the subject can not with certainty be identified as any of the Hittite warrior-gods, it is safest to regard these simply as figures of warriors. But the style of the statuettes shows clearly that they are of Syro- Hittite origin, and they illustrate the important historical r6le of the Hittites in Northern Syria from the fifteenth to the thirteenth century B.C. Intaglios in the Collection of Dr. Jousset de Bellesme.-In Syria, IV, 1923, Louis SPELEERS publishes a catalogue of 42 intaglio stones in the possession of Dr. Jousset de Bellesme, who bought them of dealers in the region of HIoms- Hamath in 1893. They represent many periods of Oriental art: Sumero-Accadian (1), Assyrian (2), Neo-Babylonian (3-7), Sassanid (8-40, except No. 19, which seems to be Cypriote of the twelfth or thirteenth century B.C.), and modern (41-42). The Chronological Relation of Ezra and Nehemiah.-In R. Bibl. XXXII, 1923, pp. 481-494; XXXIII, 1924, pp. 33-64, A. VAN HOONACKER undertakes an elab- orate refutation of the thesis of F. X. KUGLER in Von Moses bis Paulus, 1922, that the traditional view is correct that Ezra preceded Nehemiah. On the con- trary, he shows that all existing documentary evidence supports the view that Ezra followed Nehemiah, and flourished under Artaxerxes II, rather than under Artaxerxes I. Objects Found at Byblos.-In Syria, III, 1922, pp. 273-290 (9 pls.;. 7 figs.), CHARLES VIROLLEAUD gives a detailed description of the hypogaeum and sarcoph- agus discovered by M. Montet at Djebeil (Byblos), and of the principal objects discovered in the tomb. Ibid., pp. 291-295 (fig.) EDOUARD NAVILLE discusses briefly the perfume vase of obsidian found in the sarcophagus. Such vases are not. common in Egypt; but one, also a perfume vase, was found in a tomb near the pyramid of Dahchour. In the same tomb were scarabs with the name of Amenem- hait III, whose name also appears on a fragment of gold in the Byblos tomb. Three obsidian vases were found by Petrie in a tomb at Lahun, also of the time of Amenemhait III. It is proved that the relations between Egypt and Syria which existed in the early dynastic periods continued as late as the XIIth dynasty. Ibid., pp. 295-297, M. CLERMONT-GANNEAU points out that the conquest of Nubia under this dynasty made deposits of obsidian accessible to the Egyptians. Ibid.,</page><page sequence="6">450 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VOL. XXVIII, 1924 pp. 298-306 (2 figs.) EDMOND POTTIER contributes some observations on other objects found in the tomb. These include a fragment of a silver vase with spiral ornament, of Mycenaean style, and similar to objects in Shaft .Grave IV at Mycenae; a vase of tea-pot shape, probably also Mycenaean; a cutlass of hook shape, a pair of silver sandals, and some miscellaneous objects. The Work of Charles Clermont-Ganneau.-In Syria, IV, 1923, pp. 140-173, RENP DUSSAUD publishes an extended article on the works and archaeological discoveries of the late Charles Clermont-Ganneau, accompanied by full biblio- graphical references. ASIA MINOR Homeric Ilios.-In his book 'Alteuropa' (1919), C. SCHUCHHARDT returned to his early opinion that the second city at Hissarlik (2500-2000 B.c.) was the Homeric Ilios. This view W. D6RPFELD discusses in Ath. Mitt. XVII, 1922, pp. 110-116, expressing surprise that Schuchhardt still holds to the view of Schliemann, and pointing out weaknesses in his arguments. Schuchhardt publishes a rejoinder (ibid., pp. 116-119) in which he maintains his position. D6rpfeld replies (ibid., pp. 119-122). The debate is concluded by a final word from Schuchhardt (ibid., pp. 122-123), in which he concedes that D6rpfeld was right in identifying the sixth city with the Ilios of Priam. Schuchhardt is convinced by the statements on the clay tablets from Boghazkoi, as read by E. Forrer (Mitt. Or. Ges., No. 63, 1924), according to which an Achaean king Atarisias, that is, Atreus, father of Agamemnon, led expeditions against Caria and Cyprus about 1250-1225 B.c. Schuchhardt still maintains that there are 'early Mycenaean' touches in the Iliad, e.g., the inlaying of the shield of Achilles with colored metals reminds us of the inlaid daggers found in the shaft graves at Mycenae. He suggests that older lays told of the destruction of the second city at Hissarlik, and that an echo of this is to be found in the tradition of the successful expedition of Heracles against La- omedon.-Schuchhardt seems to be guilty of oscitancy in finding a reference to Bellerophon in the Boghazkoi tablets. In Forrer's article (p. 15) it is a refractory Hittite prince who is exiled 'over seas', that is, to Greece, and not an Achaean prince sent from Greece to Lycia. The Roman Theatre at Smyrna.-In Ath. Mitt. XLVII, 1922, pp. 8-24 (4 pls.), O. BERG and O. WALTER publish drawings of plan, elevations and a few architectural features of the Roman theatre at Smyrna, and a description based on observations made in 1917. The present structure is not earlier than the second century A.D. In size and general arrangement of the stage, and in seating capacity, it is like the theatre at Ephesus. Of particular interest is the arch over the entrance to the OBaarpo,: the stones of the vertical courses above the cornice are rabbeted on the ends as well as on the horizontal faces to prevent slipping while the arch was being constructed. Drawings of Places in Pamphilia and Pisidia.-The tinted pencil drawings made by the architect H. EGGERT On a journey through southwestern Asia Minor in company with S. Hirschfeld in 1874, have since his death in 1920 been deposited with the Berlin Museums and are there available for study, together with his diaries of the trip. Although these sketches are less carefully worked out than the illustrations by Niemann in Lanckoronski's Stddte Pamphiliens und Pisidiens, they are a very valuable supplement to that work, sometimes because of the less ruinous condition of the buildings they depict, sometimes because they cover different ground. This is true of the architrave relief of Artemis at Perge, of Side, Kremna, the house of a Greek gentleman at Adalia, the basilica at Sagalessus, the rock tombs of Syrt, and the Eurymedon bridge at Selge, to mention some of the more conspicuous instances. (M. SCHEDE, Arch. Anz. 1922, cols. 13-14.)</page><page sequence="7">GREEK ARCH.] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1924 451 GREECE ARCHITECTURE The Temple of Zeus at Olympia.-In M. Am. Acad. Rome, IV, 1924, pp. 153- 168 (5 pls.), JAMES K. SMITH publishes new drawings of the restored plan, front and side elevations, and transverse section of the temple of Zeus at Olympia, accompanied by a text describing the architectural details of the temple. The study is based on original observations and measurements on the site. The Euthynteria of the Parthenon.-The euthynteria of the Parthenon on the east end and the two long sides of the temple was not meant to be visible: it is constructed of not altogether regular poros blocks. On the west end, however, there was a marble euthynteria, the poros course under it was worked true on its outer face for a distance of 14 cm. from its upper edge, and there is evidence of a seventh service step in front of the entrance, laid against the outer face of the marble euthynteria. Hence on the west end the euthynteria was visible after the Parthenon was completed (K. LEHMANN-HARTLEBEN, Ath. Mitt. XLVII, 1922, pp. 124-128; fig. See B. H. HILL, A.J.A. 1912, pp. 535 ff., for details of some of the evidence). The Corinthian Capital.-In Art Bulletin, IV, 1924, pp. 1-7 (3 pls.), H. L. EBELING renews the discussion of the origin of the Corinthian capital, with special reference to the single capital of that order in the temple at Bassae. The best evidence for the form of this capital, which represents an initial stage in the development of the order, is in the original drawings of Haller and Cockerell. The architect, having designed the Ionic half-columns of the temple with diagonal volutes, proceeded to construct a new type of capital which should be in harmony with these, and should present the same appearance on all four sides. It was perhaps the Doric capital which suggested the heavy abacus; the concave sides of the abacus are consistent with the diagonal volutes which support it. Having dispensed with the bolster of the Ionic capital, the designer chose a form for the core which may have been suggested by the bell-capital of the Egyptians, or by a Greek type found at Delphi; or may, again, have been derived from the Ionic columns which have special ornament on the neck. At the base of the capital was a single row of simple leaves. Above these, beneath the volutes, and rising to the same height as that of the spirals on the sides of the capital, were acanthus leaves. Between the volutes and the spirals leaves of the shape of iris leaves were painted on the capital. The somewhat too varied elements of design in this early Corinthian capital are contrasted with the harmonious composition of the capital of the Tholos at Epidaurus; while that of the monument of Lysicrates is char- acterized as a transitional form. The Olympieum at Athens.-The Olympieum at Athens, begun by the Peisis- tratids, was planned as an Ionic peripteral temple comparable with the Artemisium at Ephesus and the temple of Hera at Samos, and of the same plan and general dimensions as the later temple actually brought to completion in the time of Hadrian. The early 'Deucalion wall' of Penrose proves to be the foundation of the colonnade of a still earlier temple measuring 30.50 m. by (probably) about 60 m. This earlier structure was razed by the Peisistratids in preparation for their new temple (G. Welter, Ath. Mitt. XLVII, 1922, pp. 61-71; 41 pls., fig. The second part of this study will be published in the next volume). Towers on the Greek Islands.-In Ann. Arch. Anth. XI, 1924, pp. 31-36, H. A. ORMOND has some notes on towers of the type illustrated by the tower in Naxos described by Mr. Droop, ibid. X, 1923, pp. 41 ff. These were not only temporary refuges in time of danger: in some cases they served as actual strong. holds. Probably they also were used as beacons to warn the population of an approaching raid. Mr. Ormond makes the suggestion that the 7rvproX~ovrEs</page><page sequence="8">452 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VOL. XXVIII, 1924 whom Odysseus saw in his transitory glimpse of Ithaca after the visit to Aeolus were kindling such a beacon of warning at the approach of the still unrecognized ship. A summary of the epigraphic evidence on the use of the towers is given. SCULPTURE The "Blue Beard" of the Acropolis.-The pediment figure on the Acropolis to which the so-called Blue Beard head belongs is given a new interpretation by E. BUSCHOR, Ath. Mitt. XLVII, 1922, pp. 53-60 (pl.; fig.). The monster is the old sea daemon Proteus; the archaic artist gave him three bodies to show that Proteus could assume different forms (Od. IV, 456-458; Soph. Frg. 154, Nauck). In the three left hands are held representations of fire, of waves, and of a bird, respectively. These attributes, together with the serpent bodies, indicated that the daemon could transform himself at will into a snake, or fire, or water, or air. In the reconstruction of the figure Buschor proposes a slightly different position of the Blue Beard head, somewhat like that in Brunn-Bruckmann, 456, but presenting more of a front view to the beholder. The sculptor gave a different treatment to each of the three heads. The innermost one was in full profile, the second a little less so, but still meant to be seen from the side. These two are to be thought of as looking with interest at the Typhon struggle before them. But Blue Beard utterly ignores this; he faces the spectator squarely, as though saying: "Behold me, the Old One of the Sea." The evidence for the proposed reconstruction is a correspondence discovered after the removal of the plaster neck, between the part of the head back of the left ear, and the broken edge of the neck below. (Ibid., pp. 106-109; pl.; fig.). The So-called Erechtheum Pediment.--In Ath. Mitt. XLVII, 1922, pp. 81-91 (pl.), E. BuscHOR restores the early gable group from the Acropolis, supposed to represent a procession passing by a temple of Athena (Wiegand, Porosarchitektur, p. 197; Heberdey, Porosskulptur, p. 16), as a spring house in the sacred grove of Thymbrian Apollo at Troy, with Polyxena at the spring, Troilus waiting at the left, and Achilles in ambush at the right. Archaic Sculptures of the Acropolis.-In Ath. Mitt. XLVII, 1922, pp. 92-105 (3 pls.), E. BUSCHOR discusses the fragmentary archaic sculptural groups con- taining lions, found on the Acropolis, and makes interesting conjectures as to the structures to which they belonged. For example, he assigns the earliest group (Schrader, p. 10 ff.) to the frieze of a temple with wooden entablature, possibly a seventh century structure standing where later the Old Temple was erected; and he thinks that the famous lioness of poros (Heberdey, p. 77; Wiegand, p. 217) be- longed to a gable of an early sixth century temple of Athena on the site of the Parthenon, perhaps the original Hecatompedon. Cleobis and Biton.-In C. R. Acad. Insc. 1924, pp. 149-154, T. HOMOLLE, who has recently subjected to a new scrutiny the bases of the statues of Cleobis and Biton at Delphi, reviews the conjectures of Keramopoullos and von Premerstein on the inscriptions, and gives grounds for correcting and supplementing their readings.

The Frieze of the Nike Temple.-CARL BLtMEL is the author of a new study of the frieze of the temple of Athena Nike in Athens. A brief discussion of the arrangement of the slabs of the frieze, on which he has found no new evidence, is followed by a stylistic analysis of the extant parts. The frieze is not unified, but exhibits the work of two distinct periods and of at least three, perhaps four, sculp-</page><page sequence="9">GREEK SCULPTURE] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1924 453 tors. The blocks b, c of the east side are closely associated with the Theseum frieze, but are earlier. Blocks o and e of the south side are to be attributed to the same sculptor as these. Blocks a, 1, m, n, f, h, belong wholly to the realm of Attic-Ionic art, the same that is reflected in the sculptures of the balustrade. An artist of strongly decorative instinct is the author of i and k on the west side. The composition of g is inferior and is borrowed from o and a. There is no stylistic connection between the frieze and the group of architectural sculptures which includes the frieze and pediments of the Parthenon and the frieze and korae of the Erechtheum. The blocks o and e belong to the earliest group, commemorating the battles with the Persians. The later series, showing combats of Greeks with Greeks, allude to the recent events of the Peloponnesian War. The construction of the temple was begun in the Phidian period, between 450 and 440 B.C., and at least four of the frieze blocks-b, c, e, and o-were ordered at this time. Con- struction was interrupted, probably by the building of the Propylaea, and the work, as is shown by the plastic style of the later parts of the frieze, and by the lack of reference in these to the Persians, was continued in the years after the first part of the Peloponnesian War, presumably about 420 B.C. (Der Fries des Tem- pels der Athena Nike. Von CARL BLtMEL. Berlin, 1923, Josef Altmann. 41 pp.; 7 pls. 4to.) Two Currents in Sculpture of the Fifth Century.-CARL BLtMEL has extended his study of the architectural sculpture of the fifth century beyond the scope of his dissertation on the frieze of the Nike temple, and has published a contribution to general criticism of the sculpture of this period, entitled Zwei Strimungen in der attischen Kunst des V. Jahrhunderts. The architectural conditions of sculpture resulted in a marked cleavage of styles. In the deep frames of Doric metopes and pediments, the tendency was to the creation of compositions in high relief, symmetrically composed and of isolated figures, a plastic and architectonic style. The frieze of Ionic buildings, on the other hand, demanded low relief and a style which had relatively little reference to the architectural frame, distinctly pictur- esque in method and effect. One or the other of these styles may be observed in all the Attic sculpture of the second half of the fifth century. The plastic style is exemplified in the friezes of the Theseum--the east frieze recalls a pediment composition, the west a series of metopes-, the fragments from the Ionic temple on the Ilissus, some slabs of the Nike temple frieze, the accessory reliefs of the Athena Parthenos and the Zeus of Phidias, the base of the Nemesis at Rhamnus and (in the fourth century) the base at Mantinea. To the group exemplifying the picturesque style and method belong the Parthenon frieze and pediments, the later slabs of the Nike temple frieze, and the frieze of the Erechtheum. Mr. Bltiimel discusses in some detail the difference of approach to the two types of work-the more analytical method of the plastic style, the more synthetic of the picturesque, which requires a more direct study of models. The plastic method is more generally found in the treatment of somewhat hackneyed subjects of com- bat, while contemporary or freshly conceived subjects, such as those of the Par- thenon frieze and the Erechtheum frieze, are treated in the new style. The paper is supplemented by a discussion of a marble head of Athena, now in private pos- session in Berlin, which on several stylistic grounds is attributed to a metope of the Parthenon (East IV) representing Athena and Enceladus.

The Colossal Statue of a Goddess from Ariccia.-The colossal standing statue of a goddess which was found in a vineyard not far from Ariccia, in March, 1919, and published by G. Lugli in Not. Scav. for 1921, is again published and discussed at some length by W. AMELUNG in Jb. Arch. I., XXXVII, 1922, pp. 112-137 (21 figs.). It is of Pentelic marble and was made, probably at Athens, in the time of</page><page sequence="10">454 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VOL. XXVIII, 1924 Trajan, from a bronze original of the middle of the fifth century, a little earlier than the Athena Parthenos. There are numerous replicas, both of the heavily draped figure and of the head, the best-known being the head of the Hera Farnese at Naples. The goddess wears no ornament except a plain band in the hair above the forehead, and no attribute is preserved, although the long object which once probably leaned against the left side may have been a torch. The hair hanging down the back in a heavy plait indicates a maiden, not a matron, and the nearness of Lake Nemi, with its cult of Diana, to the shrine in which the statue stood in Italy, suggests that it represented Artemis or Hecate. The style, in which it resembles the Artemis of the Selinus metope, the older metopes of the Parthenon, and the Delphian charioteer, is that of the school of Critias and Nesiotes. An Argive Offering to Hermes.-The interpretation of the votive offering to Hermes found by Vollgraff in his excavations at Argos, and published by him in B.C.H. XLIV, 1920, pp. 222 ff., is discussed by E. PFUHL, in Ath. Mitt. XLVII, 1922, pp. 78-80. The object in the hand of the maiden cannot be a phallos, as Vollgraff regarded it, nor can the pillar be a herm. This pillar was meant to be beside Hermes-his left arm is resting on it-but the low relief and the style of the sculptor constrained him to make the pillar appear as if in front. The work, while one of the best of its group, gives the impression of provincial art when com- pared with Attic reliefs of the fourth century, and points to no great Argive tradition of sculpture at this period. COINS The Mint of Sunium.-In J. Arch. Num. XVII, 1915 (published 1922), pp. 53-70 (pl.; 9 figs.), is a discussion by the late J. N. SVORONOS of evidence connect- ing the sanctuaries at Sunium with the minting of coins from the silver of Laurium. An artificial pit in the temenos of Apollo at Sunium seems to have served in primi- tive times as a depot of metal and a mint, just as a tower in the sanctuary of Posei- don served these purposes in later times. Mr. Svoronos associates this early mint with the cult of the hero Stephanephoros, and interprets the beautiful relief of transitional date, found some years ago at Sunium, as a votive relief representing this hero as placing a garland on his own head. In the second part of his article Mr. Svoronos identifies a series of coins struck by insurgent miners in the revolt of 102-100 B.C. The Coins of Lampsacus.-In A. J. Num. LIII, 1924, part 3 (77 pp., 17 figs., 10 pls.), is a monograph by AGNES BALDWIN on the golol staters and the silver and bronze coinage of Lampsacus. An introductory chapter leaves open the question whether it is better to attribute certain electrum coins to Macedonia, as Svoronos does, or to explain them as Lampsacene by means of the Ionian Revolt Theory. The gold staters were issued during less than a century (c. 390-330 B.C.). An intensive study of details of the reverses, sizes of flans and types, to- gether with styles of obverses has furnished the clue to the order of the issues and an analysis of the Asia Minor and Avola hoards entirely bears out these conclusions. There was no interference as to choici of metal, weight, or type and an inscription (I.G. VII, 2418, 11, 10, 11) shows that this coinage was of considerable importance as a circulating medium. For evidence of cult it is not, as a whole, of especial value because there are many copied or inspired types. The silver coinage begins ca. 500 B.c. and at first shows half-Pegasus and Janiform head types. Apparently the mint was almost quiescent between 470 and 400, but the fourth century wit- nesses a fairly abundant and continuous series of native types until ca. 330 B.C. Next are found posthumous Alexandrine types bearing only occasionally the Lampsacene mint-mark (regal) and Alexandrine types with the personal emblem of Lysimachus (regal). Before the middle of the third century Lampsacus began the issue of Alexandrine coinage bearing invariably the badge of the city (autono-</page><page sequence="11">GREEK MIsc.] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1924 455 mous). A series of Priapus tetradrachms extends over a period of some ten decades after 188 B.c. Bronze coins were issued occasionally from the fourth century B.C. to the reign of Gallienus. Antonomous Coinage of Smyrna.-A paper (or series of papers) on the autono- mous coinage of Smyrna is in fulfilment of a promise made by the author in 1914 in an article printed in the Num. Chron. of that year (p. 273). Old Smyrna had been destroyed by Alyattes. New Smyrna was probably refounded by Antigonus about 304-302 B.C. The present review of the coinage of the new city extends from that date to the initiation of the imperial coinage under Augustus. It is naturally divided into three periods by two breaks in the continuity of the coinage, one about the time of the battle of Magnesia, the other during the reorganization of the province of Asia after the Mithradatic war. Each of the three periods is treated in subdivisions. In the present issue the history is carried only to about 190 B.C. (J. G. MILNE, Num. Chron., 1923, pp. 1-30; 2 pls.). New Bronze of Syracuse.-A previously unpublished small bronze coin of Syracuse with types of Tyndaris suggests a connection in history between the two cities to A. H. LLOYD in Num. Chron., 1923, pp. 150-2 (pl.). Coinage and Diplomacy of Philip II of Macedon.-The history, diplomatic and economic, of Philip II of Macedon in the earlier years of his reign is illuminated by a study of the coinage of the time from the pen of ALLEN B. WEST in Num. Chron.,'1923, pp. 169-210. GENERAL AND MISCELLANEOUS The Bronze Disc from Tegea.-The decorated bronze disc found at Tegea and published by Dugas in B.C.H. XLVI, 1921, is again figured and further discussed by V. MtrLLER in Arch. Anz. 1922, cols. 14-18(fig.). The animal of which only a portion is preserved is bovine and the figure standing on it is a goddess, naked but for a wide girdle and with arms raised, holding up a poppy seed cup. The style is pure geometric. It is to be assigned to Boeotia and to the seventh century B.C. and is an interesting proof of the extent to which, in the time of Hesiod, the Greek conceptions of the native divinities were influenced by Oriental, especially Hittite, ideas. The Topography of Phlius.-In Ann. Arch. Anth. XI, 1924, pp. 37-47, (map), A. G. RUSSELL discusses the topography of Phlius and the Phliasian plain, and mentions the visible ancient monuments on the site. - His topographical survey has special reference to Xenophon's account of the attack of the Arcadians and Eleans on Phlius in the campaign of 369-368 B.C. (Hellenica, VII, 2, 5-15.) The Heracles Myth.-The scope of Herakles, by BERNHARD SCHWEITZER, is somewhat more extended than the title implies, but is indicated more fully by the subtitle, Essays on the History of Greek Religion and Myth. To a considera- ble extent it is also a study in comparative mythology. Taking as his starting- point a geometric sherd from the Argive Heraeum, on which a monster with two heads, four arms, and four legs is associated with the double axe, the author traces in detail the survival of the double axe in the religion and myth of post-Minoan times. The significance of the many-limbed monster, probably embodying a primitive conception of the powers of wind and storm, is discussed in the following chapter; and in the next, the relation of Poseidon, who seems to have been originally a wind-god, to the twins called the Aktoryones, who were slain by Heracles, and who constitute a variant of the many-limbed monster. The following chapters include an analysis of the tradition of the twelve labors of Heracles, a discussion of the archaeology of the tradition of the hero, and an exposition of the Heracles "MSirchen," under the following heads: the tale of the fisher's son, the tale of the war with giants and dragons, Alastir and Cornac. Heracles, the author concludes, is a figure of the same character as Indra and Thor, Rama and Rustem, Siegfried</page><page sequence="12">456 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VOL. XXVIII, 1924 and Beowulf, a slayer of monsters, a characteristic creation of Aryan civilization. The monsters he slew are derived from pre-Dorian conceptions of sinister forces of nature. Heracles himself is "the genius of the Dorian element in the 'mythical' culture of the Greeks. His wide-spread cults are a thank-offering for a destiny already experienced, an expression of hope for a destiny anticipated; his death and his entrance into Olympus are the bold self-apotheosis of a people which has felt a breath of its divinity even in the creative impulse of its sorrow-torn exist- ence." (Herakles: Aufsitze our griechischen Religions- und Sagengeschichte, von BERNHARD SCHWEITZER. Tilbingen, 1922, J. C. B. Mohr. viii, 247 pp.; 12 pls.; 38 figs. 8vo.) Boeotian and Anatolian Cults.-In Ann. Arch. Anth. XI, 1924, pp. 3-24, W. R. HALLIDAY discusses the cult of Hector at Thebes and that of Achilles at Tanagra. The Theban cult was not due to an Asiatic enthusiasm on the part of Medizing Boeotians; and Plutarch's explanation of the cult at Tanagra (Quaest. Gr. 37) is the product of "muddled antiquarian erudition." It is probable that these rites were brought from the Troad to Boeotia at the time when Boeotians were colonizing the Pontic regions. Further transference of Asiatic myth and cult to Boeotia is indicated by the traditions of Niobe and of the Amazons. The Pythals.-AxEL BOATHIUS is the author of an exhaustive study of the Pythais, a religious festival which especially associated Athens with Delphi. His conclusions are based for the most part on epigraphic evidence discovered at Delphi. The time of the festival was at the end of the Attic official year, perhaps in the month Thargelion. For some time its occurrence was determined by the appearance of lightning over Harma, proverbially unusual. The delegation to Delphi for the ceremonies of the Pythais was conducted as a solemn Troirj, following the road by Oenoe to Thebes and thence to Delphi. Connected with the offering of first fruits to the god were rites called the Pyrphoria and the Tripodo- phoria. The group of Pythaists was composed, in part, at least, of members of noble Athenian families, and was accompanied by theori. We know that in the fourth century boys of about ten years also accompanied the procession as a chorus. The festival lapsed in the third century, but was revived in 138-7 B.c. The tradition, however, was so completely broken before this time that the details of the ceremonies, from this time on, are not to be regarded as gefiuine survivals. There is copious evidence on the several officers, choruses, troops of cavalry, etc., who made up the procession at this time. The chorus approached the Delphic altar singing the paean of Limenius (Fouilles. 138), and at the time of the sacrifice they sang the hymn preserved in Fouilles 137. After a period of recurrence at intervals of ten years, the Pythais was celebrated after 106-5 at intervals of eight years. But the Sullan and Civil Wars again interrupted the tradition, and the Athenian rites at Delphi restored in the imperial period no longer went under the name of the Pythais. The chief epigraphic and literary testimonia on the festival are collected in an appendix. [Die Pythais: Studien zur Geschichte der Verbindungen zwischen Athen und Delphi. Von AXEL BO:eTHIUS. Uppsala, 1918, Almqvist och Wiksell's Boktryckeri, iv, 172 pp. 8vo.] The Argive Calendar.-A renewed examination of the literary and epigraphic evidence on the Argive calendar and on the dates of the principal religious festivals of Argos is presented in a recent dissertation by AXEL BO:THIUS. The Nemean festival was celebrated every second year (in the years B.C. represented by the odd numbers) and at a date which must have been well after the harvest, and, in ac- cordance with an inference from I.G. II, 181, before the eleventh of the Attic month Hekatombaion. The date fell in the Argive month Panamos, and a review of the evidence on the Argive months shows that Panamos was equivalent to the Attic Skirophorion (June-July). Hence the festival took place in early July. The festival of Hera was celebrated every second year in the middle or the latter</page><page sequence="13">ITAL. ARCH.] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1924 457 part of June, again in the years B.C. denoted by odd numbers. In the imperial period the Sebasteia alternated with the Heraea; that is, each festival occurred once in four years. The final chapter of Dr. Bodthius' dissertation reviews the course of the Argive year and its religious observances. (Der argivische Kalender, untersucht von AXEL BOETHIUS.

The Soteria of Delphi.--In R. t. Anc. XXVI, 1924, pp. 97-111, P. ROUSSEL, examining the evidence on the chronology of the Delphic festival which com- memorated the expulsion of the Gauls, formulates the hypothesis that in the archonship of Polyeuctus at Athens, which he dates 243-242 B.C., this festival, known as the Soteria, was completely transformed by the Aetolians, and became a penteteric celebration. Lists in which the names of the Aetolian agonothetae of the festival appear are later than this date; other lists are to be connected with the earlier Amphictyonic festival, which was probably annual. The establishment of the penteteric celebration is to be associated with the Aetolian preponderance in Greek affairs, about 250-240 B.C. Attic Ostracism.-The 43 Attic ostraca, found in 1910 just outside the Dipylon Gate, and published together with six already known, by A. Brueckner (Ath. Mitt. XL, 1915, pp. 1 ff.), are discussed by A. KOERTE in Ath. Mitt. XLVII, 1922, pp. 1-7. The newly found sherds were all used at the same ostracism. Since at least 24 bear the name of Cleippides, son of Deinias, of Acharnae, while only 11 were against Thucydides, Cimon's successor as leader of the aristocrats, Brueck- ner dated the ostracism between the year of Cimon's death, 449 B.C., and 443, the year in which Thucydides was ostracized, and argued that Cleippides must have been the immediate predecessor of Pericles in the leadership of the democratic party, and that this ostracism was a trial of strength between Cleippides and Thucydides, in which the latter was more successful than in 443. Koerte points out the insignificance of Cleippides in the historians (Thuc. III, 18, 3;28, 1. Diod. XII, 55, 5), and the omission of his name from the list of political leaders in Arist. Ath. Pol. 28, 2. He argues that the method of counting votes at an ostracism (Plut. Aristeides, 7, 5) explains why the name of Cleippides is found on more of the newly found sherds than that of Thucydides, and assigns them to the ostracism of 443. He adds some comments on the importance of the epigraphical features of the ostraca, the shape of lambda, the use of H and Q, and the occurrence of the three-stroke sigma on No. 44. He also suggests that since the name of the father of the candidate for ostracism is written much more frequently than that of his deme, it appears that the attempt of Cleisthenes to bring into use a more demo- cratic form of nomenclature (Arist. Ath. Pol. 21, 4) had been by no means successfil. ITALY ARCHITECTURE Entasis of Roman Columns.-A study of the problem of entasis in Roman architecture is published by GORHAM P. STEVENS in M. Am. Acad. Rome, IV, 1924, pp. 121-152 (pl.; 28 figs.). Brief remarks on Greek and Roman entasis are fol- lowed by a list of the eight Roman columns, ranging in date from 2 B.C. to 312 A.D., on which the author's conclusions are based, and by a description of the practical methods used in the actual measurement of the columns, as well as a statement of the possible errors for which allowance must be made. The conic, the vertical projection of a helix, and the conchoid of Nicomedes are described as the curves "which best fulfil the peculiar conditions necessary for the entasis of columns." The mathematical methods of testing columns for these curves are described and illustrated; and the results obtained by Mr. Stevens from the eight columns which</page><page sequence="14">458 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VOL. XXVIII, 1924 he has tested are tabulated and illustrated by diagrams. "The results show a great variation in the general proportions of the columns and also in their entases. * . . Study of the table and its accompanying figures show that the Romans employed at least the parabola, hyperbola, and conchoid for their entases . . . The cigar shaped column seems to come into fashion about the time of Hadrian. . . . The contraction of the shaft is on the whole greater in the early periods than in the late . . . The use of the conic for entasis shows Greek influence." In the final pages of his study Mr. Stevens gives practical directions for laying out Roman entases similar to the examples measured. The Villa of Hadrian.-A group of buildings in the Villa of Hadrian at Tivoli, adjoining the southern colonnade of the Poecile to the south of its east end, and occupying a position between the Poecile and the small Thermae, is the subject of drawings and detailed description by JAMES CHILLMAN, Jr., published in M. Am. Acad. Rome, IV, 1924, pp. 103-120 (7 pls.). The group has been known as the Aedicula since the time of Piranesi, because of an assumption that its central hall contained a shrine. Excavations, however, have shown that no shrine existed here, and Mr. Chillman gives the structure the descriptive name of "the Casino of the Semicircular Arcades." As restored by Mr. Chillman, the building includes a rectangular fountain basin adjoining the Poicile, flanked by two colon- nades which serve as passages to the central hall of the casino; the central hall, rectangular in plan, with antechambers opening to east and west from its four corners; semicircular gardens to the west, south, and east of the central hall, each enclosed by a semicircular arcade, and beyond the arcade to the east a series of symmetrically arranged rooms, the axis of the principal room being a continuation of the shorter axis of the casino. It is conjectured that the largest of the eastern rooms was a picture gallery. The Arch of Constantine.-The late Professor Frothingham argued that the Arch of Constantine, in its original form, dates from the reign of Domitian (A.J.A. XVI, 1912, pp. 368 ff.; XVII, 1913, pp. 487 ff.; XIX, 1915, pp. 1 ff., 367 ff.). In M. Am. Acad. Rome, IV, 1924, pp. 169-180 (2 pls.), ALICE WALTON examines the architectural evidence once more and concludes that while the original arch may be as early as the third century, it cannot be so early as the Flavian era. She summarizes her argument as follows: "The main facts which offer effective argu- ment against the Flavian theory are in brief these: the medallions are placed too high and ineffectively in uneven masonry; the pedestals under the columns form an integral part of the arch as first built, while the entablature of the columns crudely imitates in design the main cornice; both the main cornice and the impost moulding of the central arch are cut in various lengths which are joined so as to obliterate the patterns; the end of a fine cornice block was recut in the crude style to form the southwest corner; the reliefs under the main arch could not have been set after the courses of masonry which slightly overlap them." The Column of Arcadius at Constantinople.-In Archaeologia, LXXII, 1921- 22, pp. 87-104, E. H. FRESHFIELD describes the illustrations in an exceptionally interesting vellum album in his possession, consisting of original sketches of monu- ments of Constantinople, made by a German who visited the city in 1574. The architectural subjects included are: the column of Constantine, the obelisk of Thothmes in the Hippodrome, the serpent column from Delphi, the obelisk of stones in the Hippodrome, the interior of St. Sofia, the column of Arcadius, the mosque of Sultan Suleiman, the tomb of Suleiman, Leander's Tower, the column of Claudius Gothicus at Seraglio Point. On loose sheets are a general view of St. Sofia and adjacent buildings, and a picture of the tomb of Sultan Selim and his sons. Special importance attaches to the drawings of the column of Arcadius, and the major part of Mr. Freshfield's article is devoted to a review of the historical events which it commemorated and a detailed description of the spiral band of</page><page sequence="15">ITAL. INSCRIP.] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1924 459 reliefs which illustrate these events. The column was begun in the reign of Ar- cadius (395-401), and completed in that of Theodosius II. It was pulled down in 1729, because of injuries due to an earthquake; but its base is still visible in the Awret Bazaar. The subject of the reliefs is the service of Theodosius I to the Empire in 385 A.D., when he defeated a hitherto unknown Scythian people- probably Tartar Huns, forerunners of Attila-who threatened the invasion of the lands south of the Danube in alliance with the Goths under Odothoeus. INSCRIPTIONS Correction to Ephemeris Epigraphica, VIII, No. 632.-An inscription cut on an altar in the museum at Terracina is published in Eph. Epigr. VIII, p. 145, No. 632, with the following reading: Isi(di) restitutri(ci) I L (ucius) Terentius I Stephanus I Aug(ustalis) aras et I oro[logi]um pec(u) I (n)ia sua d(onum) d(edit) et . . . ex p (?) . I d. In Mdl. Arch. Hist. XL, 1923, pp. 207-217, Louis LESCII republishes the inscription, which he reads and restores as follows: Isi(di) Restitutri(ci) I L(ucius) Terentius I Stephanus I Aug(ustalis) aras et I dromum pecuj- nia sua d(onum) d(edit) et i Anxorates ita pols[u]er(unt) ex d(ecreto) d(ecurionum) I et posticum. The word dromus is not elsewhere found in Latin, but the Greeks applied it to the avenues of sphinxes leading to Egyptian temples; its use here is therefore not strange in a dedication to Isis. Probably the freedman L. Terentius erected a series of sphinxes or the like before the temple, and his gift was of such importance as to be officially accepted by decree of the decuriones of Anxur (Terracina). The form Anxorates does not occur elsewhere, but is correctly made. The posticum mentioned in the last line was probably a latrina. Such places were under the protection of Fortuna, with whom Isis was often identified. The date of the inscription is not far from 100 A.D., a time when the cult of Isis was popular in the Roman Empire. COINS Lictors' Fasces on Roman Coins.-In R. Ital. Num. XXXVI (1923), pp. 5-20, L. LAFFRANCHI describes and discusses the varying details in the depiction of the symbolic rods and axes of Roman magistrates on coins (plates and cuts). GENERAL AND MISCELLANEOUS Archigalli and Galli.-In M6l. Arch. Hist. XL, 1923, pp. 237-324, JEIR6ME CARCOPINO completes his discussion of the cult of Attis and Cybele at Rome and the reforms of Claudius (see A.J.A. XXVII, 1923, p. 483). He finds that the archigalli did not exist before Claudius. Galli are mentioned frequently in litera- ture, though the word gallus, as used by the satirists and Christian writers is not applied specifically to the devotees of Attis and Cybele, but to eunuchs and dis- graceful persons in general. Inscriptions, with one doubtful exception (C.I.L. VI, 32462) do not mention galli at all, but in sixteen inscriptions, only two of which are Asiatic, archigalli are mentioned. They were important priests, were Roman citizens, and had nothing oriental but their name. In our texts of Pliny's Naturalis Historia (xxxv, 70) we read that Parrhasius "pinxit et Archigallum; quam picturam amavit Tiberius princeps atque ut auctor est Deculo HS -LX- aestimatam cubiculo suo inclusit." The manuscripts read HSLX, with the exception of the codex Bam- bergensis, which reads HSLX, but even 60,000 sesterces is far too low a value for an original work of Parrhasius in the time of Tiberius; hence Jahn made the emendation HS1LX . But six million sesterces is found by comparison with other recorded values to be far too high. After discussion of the errors arising from the Roman system of notation, the conclusion is reached that the correct reading is HSIXI, 1,000,000 sesterces. The word archigallum is probably a mistake for</page><page sequence="16">460 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VOL. XXVIII, 1924 artigamon (APXI AAAON, APTIFAMON), and the picture was probably identical with the one which Suetonius (Tiber. 44) interprets as Meleager and Atalanta: "Quare Parrasi quoque tabulam in qua Meleagro Atalanta ore morigeratur, legatum sibi conditione ut, si argumento offenderetur, decies pro ea sestertium acciperet, non modo praetulit, sed in cubiculo dedicavit." This picture of a bride passionately kissing her bridegroom was probably a genre scene to which a mythological interpretation was given when the taste of the times demanded it. The value, 1,000,000 sesterces, is that of the "archigallus" of Pliny, and the place (the bedroom of Tiberius) is identical. Several examples of names applied by Pliny and others to works of art are cited. One interesting example is that of a painting in which Protogenes of Caunus represented the Athenian state galleys Paralus and Hammonias "which some people call Nausicaa" (Pliny, N.H. xxxv, 101). Another example of peculiar interest is the painting by Aetion which Lucian (Herod. 4-6) describes as the marriage of Alexander and Roxana. This has been identified by Ad. Reinach with the nova nupta mentioned by Pliny (N.H. xxxv, 78), but Reinach is wrong in thinking that the historical names were originally attached to the figures in the picture; the names were a later invention. There is, then, no need of changing the date (Ol.CVII) given by Pliny (N.H. xxxv, 78 and xxxv, 51) for the floruit of Aetion, nor is there any longer any difficulty in connecting the famous "Aldobrandini marriage" in the Vatican with the painting by Aetion. The influence of the painting by Parrhasius may perhaps be seen in some voluptuous love scenes represented on Apulian vases. The tales told by Suetonius and Tacitus (and not by Pliny) about the licentiousness of Tiberius at Capri may be based solely upon his admiration for the picture by Parrhasius. The only mention of an archigallus before the time of Claudius has now been done away with. Those reforms affected not only Rome, where they made the cult of Attis and Cybele officially part of the state religion, biit also Asia, where the cult was regulated by them. Castration was limited to Phrygia, and even Phryg- ian galli were subjected to a tax (Hephaest. Alex., p. 68 Gaisford, p. 194 Westphal). Claudius purified the cult of Cybele and Attis and established a connection between it and the Roman Empire. Etruscan Incense-stands.-K. A. NEUGEBAUER is the author of a study of some bronze incense-stands of Etruscan origin, published in Ber. Kunsts. XLV, 1924, pp. 28-35 (8 figs.). Four show a female dancer, in long clinging chiton and pointed shoes, and with arms in a posture of the dance, standing on a low table, and supporting on the head the vertical stem of the incense-burner, which is designed to suggest a more or less conventional flower stalk. The style of the little figures associates them with the influence of Eastern Greek art. But no such censers are found in the Eastern Mediterranean, and these are of Etruscan manufacture. Somewhat different is the case with the charming figure of a danc- ing youth, from Chiusi, No. 693 in the Berlin Antiquarium. This is much more distinctly Greek in style. The author compares it with a figure of a dancing youth wearing a helmet, now in the possession of Dr. Guthmann in Mittelschreiberhau (figs. 1 and 2), and here published for the first time; and assigns to the same group of Hellenizing works a figure from another incense-stand, found in Chiusi, and now in the British Museum. This represents a nude female dancer. The Greek style of these works is to be attributed to the influence of the Greek colonies of Southern Italy. Stucco Reliefs in Rome.-A systematic study of the extant stucco reliefs of the first and second centuries in Rome is published by EMILY L. WADSWORTH in M. Am. Acad. Rome, IV, 1924, pp. 9-102 (49 pls.). Miss Wadsworth outlines the development of the art of architectural stucco ornament in Egypt, Minoan Crete and Etruria, incidentally calling attention to the lack of this form of decoration in classical Greece. The vogue of stucco ornament in the Campanian cities at the</page><page sequence="17">SPAIN] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1924 461 close of the Republican period is to be traced, with other features of their art, to the influence of Hellenistic Alexandria; and this branch of decorative design played its part in the artistic transformation of Rome at the hands of Hellenistic artists in the period of the early Empire. The art flourished for two centuries, but declined after the time of the Antonines. Miss Wadsworth gives a detaiIld account of the material composition of the stucco used in Rome, and describes FIGURE 1 FIGURE 2 DANCING YOUTH: MITTELSCHREIBERHAU the technique of its application to walls and vaults. The major part of the mono- graph is devoted to individual descriptions of the stucco reliefs which are still in situ in Rome, or are in the museums of the city: those of the Villa Farnese, the Colosseum, the Cryptoporticus of the Palatine, the so-called Bridge of Caligula, the Villa of Domitian at Castel Gondolfo, a vault of unknown origin, the vault under San Clemente, Hadrian's Villa, San Sebastiano, the tombs of the Valerii and the Arricii, the recently discovered "Underground Basilica," and the Tor de' Schiavi on the Via Praenestina. This is followed by a discussion of the system of design of stucco ornament as applied to vaults and walls. The most common designs on vaults are of coffer form, suggested by the original relations of timbers in a roof. Larger panels are frequently introduced as a central feature in coffer designs. A second class of designs is of circles in various relations, sometimes even interlaced. A third class is of "carpet" designs, apparently suggested by Oriental rugs. A fourth style is designated as the "decorative," its compositions consisting of fields of various shape, contiguous to one another, and enclosed by straight lines which are parallel or perpendicular to the cornice, as in the "Underground Basilica." Almost all designs have a central medallion or panel of special im- portance. The wall designs in stucco correspond in type to the wall paintings of the First and Second styles. The subjects of representation within the frames of the general design are classified as landscapes, human figures, Victories, Cupids, griffins and sphinxes, and minor motives, such as dolphins and sea monsters, gorgoneia, candelabra, and shells. SPAIN Rock-shelter Paintings of the Aeneolithic Age.-Paintings of the Aeneolithic Age on sites in Spain are discussed by M. C. BURKITT in Ant. J. IV, 1924, pp. 134-141 (pl.; 3 figs.). These remains, known as Spanish Group III, have received less attention than the Palaeolithic paintings of France and Northern Spain and the Eastern Spanish paintings (Spanish Group II). Mr. Burkitt indicates the</page><page sequence="18">462 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VOL. XXVIII, 1924 kinds of rock on which they occur, and their distribution in the peninsula. The figures are painted in reds and yellows, and are usually isolated. The drawing is highly conventionalized. Conventional drawing sets in even in the Palaeolithic period, and predominates in the paintings of Group II. The certainly later art of Group III has no examples of naturalistic drawing. Many of its figures could not be interpreted except by tracing their origin in less conventional forms. On various grounds this class of paintings must be assigned to an age when copper was already in use. Their motive was probably religious. FRANCE The Sacred Forest of Marseilles.-In R. At. Anc. XXVI, 1924, pp. 116-122 (2 figs.), CAMILLE JULLIAN argues that the sacred forest which, according to Lucan (Pharsalus III, 399-452) was destroyed by Julius Caesar in his siege of Masseilia, was in the valley of Saint-Pons, near Aubagne, 24 kilometres from Marseilles. Its situation and characteristic features correspond to the description of the poet. GERMANY Prehistoric Bavaria.-In Mannus, XV, 1923, pp. 207-230, FRIEDRICH WAGNER reviews the literature on prehistoric Bavaria published 1900-1922. Prehistoric Saxony.-Research since the year 1900 on the prehistoric culture of Saxony, Anhalt and Grossthiiringen is reviewed by NILS NIKLASSON in Mannus, XV, 1923, pp. 231-270. SWEDEN The Rock-drawings of Sweden.-The symbols in the form of shoe-soles, wheels and crosses which appear in the rock-drawings of Sweden are discussed by WIL- HELM GAERTE in Mannus, XV, 1923, pp. 271-285 (35 figs.). He concludes that they have no magic or religious significance, but were intended to commemorate bold exploits of invasion and conquest by a Germanic people. GREAT BRITAIN Flint Implements.-In Archaeologia, LXXII, 1921-22, pp. 25-39 (18 figs.), R. A. SMITH describes and discusses a series of flint implements of unusual im- portance from British sites, ranging in date from Eolithic to Neolithic times. Roman Milestones in Cornwall.-In Ant. J. IV, 1924, pp. 101-112 (7 figs.), R. G. COLLINGWOOD points out that the tin-mines in Cornwall were not worked by the Romans before 250 A.D., and that the evidence of Roman occupation after this date consists in great part of coins which were brought in to pay for the metal exported. There is no trace of-Roman villas or of a permanent camp in Cornwall. There seem to have been no roads connecting Cornwall with other parts of Britain, but some milestones, described and published here, indicate the existence of roads between the mines of the interior and the ports. The course of these roads is conjectured, and finally a list of alleged Roman roads in Cornwall is given. NORTHERN AFRICA The Topography of Cyrene.-In R. Rt. Anc. XXVI, 1924, pp. 112-114 (plan), EMILE CAHEN cites a passage from Callimachus (Hymn to Apollo, 77-78) indicat- ing that the original settlement of Cyrene was on the western hill, where the tem- ple of Apollo stood. Callimachus says that Battus "built a fair temple and established a yearly sacrifice &amp; v7r T6XL." According to M. Cahen the sacrifice would necessarily be near the temple; hence the temple was also &amp; 4 T rbXiL. The word 7rlbs is here used in the same sense as in Athens, where it frequently denoted the Acropolis.</page><page sequence="19">EARLY CHRISTIAN] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1924 463 EARLY CHRISTIAN, BYZANTINE AND MEDIAEVAL ART GENERAL AND MISCELLANEOUS Notes from Constantinople.-I. A local superstition that some powerful personage, variously named as Constantine Palaeologus the last Greek emperor, or his father John Palaeologus, or St. John the Evangelist, lies buried at the Golden Gate and will rise to bring back the rule of the Greeks, may be traced to the fact that an Egyptian mummy, sent by the king of France as a present to Charles XII of Sweden when he was in exile in Turkey, was thought by the Turks to be the body of a powerful saint and was kept and deposited in the Seven Towers, the fortress of the Golden Gate. The story is attested independently by Lady Mary Wortley Montagu in 1717 and nearly a century later by the French consul Pouqueville. II. A massive iron chain preserved in the military museum in the church of St. Irene is commonly said to be the chain by which the harbor of the Golden Horn was barred at the time of the Turkish attack; but that chain is described as having elliptical links, while the chain at St. Irene is composed mainly of figure-8 links and elliptical links bent in at the sides to approximate that shape. A chain answering this description, which had closed the harbor of Rhodes in the time of the Knights, was seen in Rhodes by Ludwig Ross in 1843 and was after- wards said to have been taken to Constantinople. As a date about the middle of the nineteenth century would tally with that of the founding of the museum at St. Irene, the chain now there is probably the one brought from Rhodes. III. An unpublished reference to the capture of Constantinople by the Turks is found in a manuscript in the British Museum. It tells of three Cretan ships which escaped from the disaster. The same three are mentioned in two other independ- ent accounts. (F. W. HASLUCK. J.H.S. XLIII, 1923, pp. 162-167; fig.). The Goths in South Russia.-In Ant. J. IV, 1924, pp. 216-219, NORMAN H. BAYNES argues briefly against Professor Rostovtseff's view that "the Gothic invasion was not the first, but the last act of the activity of the Germans in South Russia," and that "the Gothic epoch was . . . a revival' of the Scythian and Sarmatian state in a new shape." The assumption of the existence of a Gothic state, conducting sea-trade from the ports of Southern Russia, is in- compatible with ample historical evidence that the Goths, in their invasion of Asia, could not build or navigate ships. Sarmatian Ornaments.-In Ant. J. IV, 1924, pp. 259-262 (2 pls.). 0. M. DALTON calls attention to a series of Sarmatian ornaments from Kerch, recently purchased for the British Museum, and points out the interest of their resemblance to Anglo-Saxon and Merovingian ornaments as confirming Professor Rostovtseff in his theory of the ultimate Iranian origin of this type of ornament, and its trans- mission to the Sarmatians and through them to the Goths and to Western Europe. The Frescoes of the Church of Abu-Gosch.-In C. R. Acad. Insc. 1924, pp. 89-96, CHARLES DIEHL calls attention to the paintings of the twelfth century church at Abu-Gosch, twelve kilometres west of Jerusalem, now in the charge of the Benedictine Fathers. The church is of rectangular form, with no externally visible apse, and no transept. The interior is divided into three aisles, each ending in an apse; and the arrangement of the interior is repeated in the crypt, of which a curious feature is a rectangular basin, fed by a spring. It is possible that the church occupies the site of a Roman fort. The vault of the central apse has a fresco representing the Resurrection in the type of Byzantine tradition. Similarly, the apse at the left shows the Deisis of Byzantine iconography, and that at the right the three patriarchs. On pilasters and pillars are figures of saints, and on the walls are representations of St. George, of the Dormition of the Virgin, and of the Crucifixion. The vault of the nave, and the walls of the crypt are also painted. The significant fact in the decoration of this church of the Crusades is</page><page sequence="20">464 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VOL. XXVIII, 1924 that the types and subjects are derived from the Eastern church, although the inscriptions are Latin. A similar combination is seen in the church at Bethlehem. Byzantine Frescoes in Bukowina.-In C. R. Acad. Insc. 1924, pp. 39-47, 0. TAFRALI gives a general account of the little-known frescoes of the churches and monasteries of Bukowina, dating from the period of the Moldavian princes of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. These monuments are architecturally of the Moldavian style, created under Gothic influence. A peculiarity of the mural paintings is that they are freely applied to the outside as well as to the interior walls of many buildings. The subjects are partly secular and partly sacred. To the first group belong the portraits of many of the Moldavian princes. Among the scenes painted on outside walls special notice is due to the twenty-four illus- trated otKOt of the hymn Acathiste, celebrating the delivery of Constantinople from the Arabs in the seventh century. At the end of this series is painted (with some anachronisms) a representation of the Arab siege of Constantinople. Other paintings illustrate the life of St. John "le Nouveau," patron saint of Bukowina whose relics are preserved at Succava. Remarkable paintings of the Last Judg- ment are found on the west walls of churches at Voronets and Humor. A common feature in this ecclesiastical painting is the representation, in a great panel on the west exterior wall of the church, of a number of saints, surrounded by leafy boughs. This is borrowed from the Byzantine art of Southern Italy. Another noteworthy feature of these paintings is the inclusion of celebrated Greek philosophers and poets among the Biblical figures. Silver Plates from Bulgaria.-In 1903 a number of decorated silver plates were- discovered at Izgherli, near Talar Pasardjik in Bulgaria. Three of these, which are now in the possession of M. Schlumberger, are described by GASTON MIGEON in Syria, IV, 1923, pp. 141-144 (2 pls.). Two are identical in design. On the outer circumference is a zone of engraved ornament in which dogs are represented pursuing a winged griffin. In the centre is a medallion, within which a foliate pattern encloses four small circles, in each of which a griffin or a winged animal of feline appearance is shown. The third plate has a border zone of conventional ornament and a central medallion of interlaced pattern. The work is of thoroughly Oriental style, and presumably the plates were imported into Bulgaria, possibly from the Asiatic shore of the Black Sea. They are to be dated in the period from the ninth to the eleventh century. Weights of Byzantine Solidi.-Examination of the weights of many specimens of solidi coined from the reign of Justinian to that of Constantine IV (527-685) leads UGo MONNERET DE VILLARD to some interesting conclusions. These coins exhibit seven different marks in exergue, and are all under the "normal" weight. They are divisible into two groups, and the second group into two subdivisions according to marks and average weights. The conclusion is that along with the "normal" solidus of 24 siliquae circulated others of 20, 21, and 22 siliquae respec- tively. Whether there was also minted a solidus of 23 siliquae cannot yet be determined (R. Ital. Num., XXXVI, 1923, pp. 33-40). The Treasure of Putna.-In C. R. Acad. Insc. 1923, pp. 365-372, 0. TAFRALI gives a brief account of the treasures of mediaeval art preserved in the monastery of Putna in Roumania, 32 kilometres west of the city of Radutji. The monastery was founded by Stephen the Great in 1466. It was destroyed in the seventeenth century; and the present buildings belong to that date; but most of the sacred objects, the greater part of which are from the time of Stephen the Great, were preserved. They are described in a Roumanian monograph by the Rev. Father Dan, entitled Monastirea Putna. One is a painted wooden cross, a gift from the monastery of Xiropotamo on Athos. There are a great number of embroidered vestments.</page><page sequence="21">EARLY CHRISTIAN] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1924 465 FRANCE The Frescoes of St.-Gilles de Montoire.-In Gaz. B.-A. IX, 1924, pp. 19-29 (4 figs.), F. LESUEUR proposes a new interpretation of the mutilated frescoes of St.-Gilles de Montoire, combating principally the interpretation of Abb6 Fabre recently published in Gaz. B.-A. Fabre's theory that the three apsidal figures represented the three members of the Trinity was based upon a study of the water color copies in the Trocadero rather than upon the frescoes themselves. The present study is based upon the frescoes, which, though in a very bad condi- tion, yet show some details that were not recorded by the copyist. The conclu- sion here drawn is that the fresco in the apse of the choir represents the Apocalyptic vision of God at the Last Judgment; the two scenes in the apses of the transept pertain to the life of Christ in His mission of founding the church: one, His ter- restial act, giving the keys to St. Peter, the other, His heavenly act, sending the Holy Spirit upon His Apostles. St.-Jouin-de-Marnes.-The sculptures of the west fKade of the Romanesque church of St.-Jouin-de-Marnes at Poitou is the subject of a study by E. MAIL- LARD in Gaz. B.-A. IX, 1924, pp. 137-150 (7 figs.). Though some parts of the church date from the early eleventh century, the sculptures of the fagade belong to the twelfth. The f~ade has been restored, but many of the reliefs remain in their original condition. The principal figure sculptures consist of the Last Judgment group in the gable, with the procession of monks and laymen at the base of the gable, the statues at the sides of thq central window and the groups over the columns beside the central window. Influence from other French churches is to be seen in the figure sculpture, but the purely decorative carving is almost entirely Oriental in its inspiration. Its immediate source is, for the most part, Spain, which was available less as a consequence of the pilgrimages to St. James at Compostella than as the result of alliances between the Spanish sovereigns and the house of Aquitaine. BELGIUM AND HOLLAND Dutch Paintings of the Fifteenth Century.--In Jb. Preuss. Kunsts. XLIV, 1923, pp. 136-146 (figs.), F. WINKLER helps to correct the general impression that Dutch painting in the early fifteenth century is represented only by Ouwater's Raising of Lazarus. A panel with eighteen scenes from the lives of Christ and Mary, which came originally from Roermond and is now in the Rijks Museum, Amsterdam, is here published as probably the earliest preserved Dutch painting of the fifteenth century. The master's name is unknown, but his elegant, im- personal style points to influence from Hubert van Eyck's miniatures and to a date of about 1420-40. A triptych whose central panel represents the Crucifixion, also in the Rijks Museum, is somewhat later, dating about 1430-70. Its master, too, is unknown, but he worked in Utrecht, for he has painted a view of Utrecht in the background of the central panel. He probably worked in the same atelier as the " Master of Gysbrecht van Brederode," for the triptych finds striking parallels in the miniatures assigned to that master. Finally, two paintings dealing with the Crucifixion and two engravings are dated between 1450 and 1490 and assigned to a master working in Hertogenbosch. They have sometimes been ascribed to Hieronymus Bosch, but, though related to his style, they do not entirely conform to it. Both the "Master of Hertogenbosch" and the "Master of Utrecht" are more native, more purely Dutch, as one sees by their rough, in- elegant types, than the "Master of Roermond." GERMANY AND AUSTRIA The "Sch~5ne Madonna" of about 14oo.-Under this designation W. PINDER, in Jb. Preuss. Kunsts. XLIV, 1923, pp. 147-171 (pl.; 29 figs.), discusses a type of</page><page sequence="22">466 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VoL. XXVIII, 1924 sculptured Madonna, about a meter in height, rich in modelling, and jewel-like in coloring. She stands in a free, graceful pose, prophetic of the early Renaissance, and offers an apple to the Child, whom she holds on her left arm. The type is followed in four geographical groups. A variety of influences are manifest, some clearly traceable to France. But the author contends that German originality of the type is by no means to be questioned, that the essential characteristics are German. An Upper German Master of the Fifteenth Century.-In Ber. Kunsts. XLV, 1924, pp. 40-42 (fig.), H. SCHMITZ calls attention to an interesting painting in the FIGURE 3 LEGEND OF ST. JAMES: BERLIN Lipperheide Library of Costume at Berlin. It is the wing of an altar-piece, and represents four scenes of the legend of St. James and the transference of his body to Spain (fig. 3). The style is not the idealizing, Italianate style which appears in some of the German paintings of the fifteenth century recently acquired by the Kaiser-Friedrich Museum. Its realism anticipates the qualities which eventually predominated in German art. Its exact provenance can not be determined, but it was probably painted in the region of the Bodensee. The Bells of the Diocese of Trent.-In Dedalo, V, 1923, pp. 451-462 (21 figs.),</page><page sequence="23">EARLY CHRISTIAN] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1924 467 G. GEROLA writes concerning the bells that were requisitioned by Austria from the diocese of Trent. While the oldest ones are but sparsely decorated, later examples are often quite ornate and, beginning with the fifteenth century, often bear inscriptions giving the names of the bronze workers with some information concerning their artistic and paternal derivations. GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND Irish Bronze Pins.-In Archaeologia, LXXII, 1921-22, pp. 71-86, (3 pls.; 5 figs.), E. C. R. ARMSTRONG classifies and discusses the chronology of Irish bronze pins of the Christian period. " Those decorated with triskele and spiral ornaments derived from the pre-Christian period may be assigned to the fifth and sixth cen- turies. The polygonal-headed pins with rings of wire . . . probably belong to the sixth century. Long pins with bosses on their stems are probably of seventh- or eighth-century date . . . For several other varieties of pins, crutch- headed, zo6morphic, etc., it is difficult to suggest a date other than the ninth century. Finally the brambled pins, and the large pins of similar shape, but in which the brambling has been replaced by interlaced and linear patterns, may be placed in the tenth century." Sculptured Cornices at Banbury.-In Ant. J. IV, 1924, pp. 1-10 (17 figs.), CHARLES E. KEYSER discusses the interesting sculptured cornices which are found on churches near Banbury, and conjectures that these unusual ornaments are due to the taste of William of Wykeham. A monogram W W appears on a shield on the church at Adderbury, and seems to be a signature of the great ecclesiastical architect. The motives which appear in this richly varied series of sculptures are enumerated, and an appendix catalogues the sculptured figures on the cornices of the churches of Brailes, Alkerton, Hanwell, Bloxham, and Adderbury. Weaverthorpe Church.-In Archaeologia, LXXII, 1921-22, pp. 51-69 (2 pls.; 3 figs.), JOHN BILSON describes the church at Weaverthorpe in the Yorkshire Wolds and discusses in detail the history of its foundation. An inscription on a dial in the church shows that it was associated with one Herbert, Chamberlain of Henry I. He died in 1130, and the church therefore presumably belongs to the early years of the twelfth century. It is important because of its authenticated date and because, while mainly Norman in style, it exhibits some pre-Conquest features. The Monastery of St. Milburge at Much Wenlock.-In Archaeologia, LXXII, 1921-22, pp. 105-132 (11 plates, including a colored plan), D. H. S. CRANAGE publishes an extended discussion of the imposing remains of the monastery of St. Milburge at Much Wenlock in Shropshire. Of the early Saxon abbey on this site, founded in the seventh century, some slight traces were found in excavations in 1901. No remains of the later church dedicated by Earl Leofric and Lady Godiva have been discovered. The great church of which the ruins are still standing belongs in great part to the thirteenth century. There are also consider- able remains of the cloistral buildings; and some of the secular structures associated with the monastery are still in use. Mural Paintings of St. Christopher.-In Ant. J. IV, 1924, pp. 227-241 (5 pls.), H. H. BRINDLEY publishes a discussion of the mural paintings of St. Christopher in English churches. A map and statistical tables show the distribution of these paintings in the several counties; but it is pointed out that these indicate rather the extent of the destruction of mural painting from the time of the Reformation on than the degree of veneration in which the saint was held in different parts of England. Few of the paintings are to be dated in the fourteenth century; a fair number belong to the fifteenth. The most elaborate painting of the subjects is at St. Keverne, on the Lyard. Mr. Brindley's article is followed by a description and illustrations of some unpublished paintings of St. Christopher.</page><page sequence="24">468 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VoL. XXVIII, 1924 Mediaeval Bronze Bowls.--Two bronze bowls of mediaeval date, engraved with interesting figure designs, are discussed by O. M. DALTON in Archaeologia, LXXII, 1921-22, pp. 133-160 (pl.; 3 figs.). Both are now in the British Museum. The first, which was found in London, is ornamented with a series of engraved pictures illustrating the legend of St. Thomas. These legends are also illustrated on two bowls discovered at Bethlehem, and on one in the Louvre. The series of illustra- tions on the London bowl resembles that on one of the Bethlehem bowls, those of the bowl in the Louvre resemble those of the second bowl in Bethlehem. The second of the London bowls is called the Cadmus bowl, because it has a central medallion with an inscribed representation of Cadmus; this is surrounded by smaller medallions, also inscribed, representing the labors of Hercules. This bowl was discovered in the Severn in 1824. Mr. Dalton calls attention to a num- ber of other illustrations of classical myth in Romanesque art. Both the Cadmus bowl and the St. Thomas bowl belong to the twelfth century, but it is not yet possible to assign to them a certain provenance. Aix and Cologne were centres of such workmanship at this time. But it is not impossible that the bowls are of English origin. The Lindisfarne Gospels.--The British Museum has issued The Lindisfarne Gospels, with introduction by ERIC GEORGE MILLAR, F.S.A. (London, 1923, British Museum; 52 pp.; 39 pls. 50s.). The decorations of this great masterpiece are now reproduced in full for the first time. After a brief history of early North- umbria and of the MS. itself, follows the description of the manuscript, its con- tents, writing and decoration. A bibliography on pages 51-52 completes the text. The Latin text agrees closely with that of the Codex Amiatinus (A) in the Lauren- tian Library in Florence. Plate XXXVII, which is from Cod. Amiatinus (I, f. 5) showing a monk (the so-called Ezra picture) seated before a five shelved case of manuscripts and copying one, is almost exactly the counterpart of the full page miniature of St. Matthew on the verso of the Lindisfarne MS. f. 25 b (Plate XX). The decoration shows four full page miniatures of the Evangelists, five pages of elaborate cruciform designs, (perhaps derived from metal book covers, similar to the lower cover of the Lindau Gospels in the collection recently presented to the American public by Mr. J. Pierpont Morgan), six pages of ornamented text, sixteen pages of Eusebian Canons, and a number of initials. Hardly can the Book of Kells show more perfect work. Three of the pages are reproduced in color in the British Museum edition; viz., the cruciform design on the page preceding St. Matthew, and the opening pages of St. Matthew and St. Luke. The script of the Lindisfarne Gospels is the insular half-uncial, and is written stichometrically, i.e. ' cola' and 'commata,' in double columns of 24 lines. The glosses, both red and black, formerly thought to be in different hands, are here attributed to Aldred's (perhaps the Bishop of Durham, 952-968) own hand. Proper comparison is made with the three similar Gospel manuscripts, the St. Chad at Litchfield in the Cathedral Library, the A, II, 17 in the Durham Cathedral Library, and the Bod- leian MS. (New Pal. Soc. Ser. II, P1. 81). RENAISSANCE ART GENERAL AND MISCELLANEOUS Paintings in the John Herron Art Institute of Indianapolis.-From the funds provided for the John Herron Art Institute by the will of the late James E. Roberts, ten paintings of Mediaeval and Renaissance schools have been purchased, initiating the collection which is to be known by the name of the donor. They are described and illustrated in The Bulletin of the Art Association, Indianapolis, Indiana, The John Herron Art Institute, XI, 1924, pp. 29-53 (12 figs.).

GAMBA gives some description of the collection formed at Milan during FIGURE, 4 CRUCIFIXION BY BARNABA DA MODENA: INDIANAPOLIS the last century by the Crespi-Morbio family. It contains first rate Italian paintings extending over a period from the primitive masters to modern. Among the primitive and Renaissance artists represented are Barnaba da Modena, Catena, Romanino, and Moretto. ITALY The Authenticity of the Portrait of the Doge Francesco Foscari.-In Ber. Kunsts. XLV, 1924, pp. 42-43 (3 figs.), W. voN BODE discusses the claim of the Italian sculptor, Licudis, to have made the plaque representing the Doge Fran- cesco Foscari which Dr. von Bode had attributed to Donatello (see Dedalo, IV, 1923, pp. 393 ff.; A.J.A. XXVIII, 1924, p. 109). The German critic maintains</page><page sequence="26">470 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VOL. XXVIII, 1924 his original view of the authenticity of the plaque, basing his conviction on the character of the patina, which could not have been secured by any known artifi- cial process. He suggests that Signor Licudis in his early studies made a copy of this work which he now asserts was his own. Wax Models by Michelangelo.-In Burl. Mag., XLIV, 1924, pp. 4-16 (3 pls.), E. MACLAGAN discusses a group of wax models acquired for the Victoria and Albert Museum in 1854 from the Gherardini collection. Considerable doubt has been thrown upon the authenticity of the models by various critics. But the present writer shows through comparison with finished sculptures by Michelangelo that at least the model for a slave, that for Hercules and Cacus, and those for the ana- tomical studies have much evidence in favor of their being considered original models by Michelangelo. Wax models ascribed to Michelangelo in other col- lections, of which the most numerous are to be found in the Casa Buonarroti and the collection formerly in the possession of Prof. Hfihnel, and now in America, are here briefly considered. The Ceramics of Savona.-In Dedalo, IV, 1923, pp. 424-450 (pl.; 20 figs.), M. LABA traces the development of what is known as Savonese pottery, showing that it was manufactured in other places in the Riviera besides Savona, particu- larly at Genoa and Albisola. But its manufacture continued much longer in Savona and so was noticed only there by writers. Undoubtedly, the earliest native ware in this region was influenced by imported Hispano-Moresque ceramics. Local work probably began as early as the second quarter of the fifteenth century but flourished principally in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, dying out about the middle of the eighteenth. The chief merit of this ware does not lie in its material, which is poor, nor in its workmanship, which is weak in detail, but in its pictorial effect of color masses. The style developed when the bloom of Italian ceramics had already passed. A Painter of Animals and Plants.-In Dedalo, IV, 1924, pp. 554-570 (pl.; 11 figs.), 0. H. GIGLIOLI presents Jacopo Ligozzi, the sixteenth-century Veronese painter in a new light. Ligozzi was a friend of the Bolognese naturalist Aldovrandi and under the direction of the latter he made some 300 colored drawings of animals and plants. These later passed into the Medicean collection and are greatly admired not only for the impression of realism that they give but also for their aesthetic qualities. An Unknown Drawing by Raphael.-In Burl. Mag., XLIV, 1924, pp. 75-76 (2 pls.), O. FISCHEL publishes a drawing owned by F. Lugt, Holland, which once belonged to the Reynolds collection. It is Raphael's study for one of the figures in the Borghese Entombment and is one of the finest, most spirited of the many drawings he made for that composition. A Painting by Carpaccio.-In Burl. Mag. LXIV, 1924, pp. 58-59 (pl.), A. MAR- TIN reproduces a painting of a young Knight in a Landscape, which has recently come into the collection of Otto Kahn, New York. It is here assigned to Car- paccio's best period, 1490-1500, when he painted the story of St. Ursula. An Unknown Work by Carpaccio.-In Burl. Mag. XLIV, 1924, pp. 59-65 (pl.), G. GRONAUT presents a hitherto unpublished panel painting by Carpaccio (the present location is not given). The subject is St. Michael as Victor over the Dragon and as Weigher of Souls. The attribution is based rather upon general stylistic considerations than upon close parallels with other paintings by the mas- ter. The work would seem to belong to Carpaccio's early period, though that is not certain. Titian's Venus and Adonis.-In Burl. Mag. XLIV, 1924, pp. 16-22 (2 pls.), C. HOLMES publishes reproductions of the three versions of Titian's painting of Venus and Adonis. The one in the National Gallery has been considered a copy of the Prado composition, but a recent removal of the varnish from the former</page><page sequence="27">RENAISSANCE ART] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1924 471 shows it to be a much finer work than it has been considered and proves that it is the most experimental and the earliest of the three versions. It has been con- siderably damaged by fire, giving it a brown coloration, but it has suffered no repainting. The Prado painting is the second version-it dates from 1554-and the one belonging to Lord Spencer must have been produced several years later still. Sixteenth Century Art Criticism in Venice.-Using the contributions of Aretino, Pino, and Dolce, L. VENTURI, in Gaz. B.-A. IX, 1924, pp. 39-48 (3 figs.), contrasts Venetian aesthetics with Florentine. Until the sixteenth century there had been no independent writing in Venice on art criticism, but with the beginning of this century we find a complete break with tradition in critical writing as well as in painting itself. While Florentine criticism emphasized scientific features of painting, insisted upon definite proportions, carefully arranged compositions, and relief in black and white, to the subordination of colors, Venetian criticism empha- sized psychological features of painting, insisted upon imaginative creation, and value in colors rather than in black and white. Venetian aesthetics was not with- out its influence upon Venetian painting; Aretino was not a painter himself, but a literary man, hence the traditions of painting had no binding upon his writings; he did not hesitate to let personal impressions direct his writing. Rediscovered Veroneses.-In the middle of the seventeenth century Ridolfi mentioned a number of important paintings by Veronese in the church of S. Giacomo at Murano. But from the third quarter of the eighteenth century they were no longer to be seen there and writers considered them lost until now, when F. INGERSOLL-SMOUSE writes, in Gaz. B.-A. IX, 1924, pp. 96-100 (pl.; 3 figs.), of the rediscovery of four of the paintings in England. Three of them, the painting of the principal altar, a work of the artist's old age, and the panels of Sts. James and Augustine, works of his youth, are now in Burghley House, at Stam- ford. The Visitation, a work of his maturity and the finest religious painting, perhaps, that he ever made, is now in the collection of the Count de Powis, a descendant of Lord Clive. Francesco Ferrucci.-In Gaz. B.-A. IX, 1924, pp. 1-11 (8 figs.), E. DE LIPHART eliminates a number of bas-reliefs formerly ascribed to Desiderio da Settignano, which seem to be below the standard of this master and to group themselves under the characteristics of a sculptor mentioned by Vasari and supplied with a number of works by Venturi. Francesco Ferrucci was in the same atelier with Leonardo, and in the bas-reliefs attributed to him by the present author he betrays the direct influence of that master's youthful work, particularly of the Benois Madonna. The lower part of a relief of the Madonna and Child in the Via Cavour, Florence, is copied almost exactly from the Benois painting. The Virgin's head in the relief of the Madonna and Child with Angels in the Foule collection, Paris, is copied from the Benois painting. And a relief of the Madonna and Child in the Dreyfus collection, Paris, follows closely Leonardo's British Museum drawing for the Benois composition. The Drawings of Jacopo de Barbari.-In Burl. Mag. XLIV, 1924, pp. 76-83 (3 pls.), A. DE HEVESY studies the drawings and engravings of Barbari, ascribing to him some examples hitherto otherwise attributed, as an allegorical subject in the Louvre, formerly given to Leonardo, and a Triumphal Procession at Christ Church, Oxford, formerly given to the School of Costa. The conclusion of the discussion is that Barbari, while not the great genius that Morelli judged him, was yet an artist of the elite, lending variety, delicacy, and refinement to all his produc- tions. SPAIN A Painting by El Greco.-In Burl. Mag. XLIV, 1924, p. 45 (2 pls.), W. G. CONSTABLE publishes a painting recently acquired by Miss Davies from the col-</page><page sequence="28">472 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VOL. XXVIII, 1924 lection of Don Gualterio Juan Buck at Jerez de la Fontera. The subject is Christ led to Calvary. It is one of the best derivations from the famous "Espolio" completed by El Greco in 1579 for the cathedral of Toledo. It makes use of only the upper part of the Toledo picture and that in a revised form. Both it and the Toledo painting represent the period when El Greco was breaking away from the Venetian style and working out his individual characteristics. Miss Davies' composition shows a more advanced stage of this process than does the one at Toledo and her picture must date between 1580 and 1584. FRANCE The Chateau-Neuf of St.-Germain-en-Laye.-In Gaz. B.-A. IX, 1924, pp. 68- 95 (15 figs.), L. DE LA TOURRASSE traces the development and decay of this pleasure resort begun by Henry II and largely carried out by Henry IV. The elegant grottos, gardens, and terraces are now almost gone, final destruction having been wrought by the construction of the railroad. Only the Doric gallery, the Pavilion of Henry IV, and the Pavilion of Sully remain from the wonderful palace. BELGIUM AND HOLLAND Dutch Mannerism.-In Jb. Preuss. Kunsts. XLIV, 1923, pp. 184-204 (9 figs.), H. KAUFFMANN traces the history of the school of Fontainebleau, showing how, when it was dominated by Roman-Florentine characteristics, it remained a foreign phenomenon in France, but when in 1541 Primaticcio brought back from Parma to Fontainebleau the soft sfumato effects of Correggio and Parmigianino the school took on a French air and became popular with native French artists. It is this school of Fontainebleau which is here designated as the source of the manneris- tic style in Holland. There are several reasons for this conclusion: the two schools are contemporary; we have Dutch copies of Fontainebleau frescoes and the employ- ment of Fontainebleau mythological subjects in Dutch pictures where the cases are not ones of actual copying; and we know that influential Dutch artists who founded the manneristic style came directly. or indirectly under the influence of the Fon- tainebleau school. C. Ketel went to Fontainebleau in 1566-67, Bloemaert and Uijttewael in 1582-83 and 1587-88 respectively, and Corneliszen and others brought the same style back to Holland. But it was not so suited to the burgher character of Holland as to the court spirit of France, and it always remained a foreign growth in Holland. It was Frans Hals and Rembrandt who first estab- lished a native national art which superseded the foreign mannerism. A Painting by Otto van Veen.-In Ber. Kunsts. XLIV, 1923, pp. 43-46 (2 figs.), FRIEDRICH WfNKLER discusses a painting of Lot and his Daughters by Otto van Veen, now in the Kaiser Friedrich Museum. It is a distinguished example of the work of the Dutch painters of the last half of the sixteenth century. In the eighteenth century the painting was considered to be a work of Raphael. The competence of the artist in the representation of action and in modelling is limited, in spite of his evident Italian studies; but composition and color give charm to the work. The Master of the Half-Lengths.-A group of pictures of half-lengths of women, developing out of those by Isenbrandt and his followers, has been ascribed by one critic to Jean Clouet, by another, to Jan Massys. M. CoNwAY, in Burl. Mag. XLIV, 1924, pp. 142-143, ascribes the largest part of the group to an artist des- ignated as the Master of the Half-Lengths and another set to the Master with the Parrot. The group is particularly interesting as showing the earliest emancipation from ecclesiastical bondage in subjects of this kind. The provenance of the Master of the Half-Lengths is uncertain, but all his pictures are essentially French in spirit, breathing the atmosphere of the French court of Margaret of Valois.</page><page sequence="29">RENAISSANCE ART] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1924 473 GERMANY Christian Art and Germanic Character.-In Mannus, XV, 1923, pp. 331-349, MARIA GRtYNEWALD publishes an essay which embodies considerations on the possible relation of the primitive Germanic attitude to life (Weltanschauung) to the Christian art of Germany in the Renaissance. Among the characteristic Germanic traits which she finds expressed in this art are a tendency to brood on the problems of life, a heroic temper, a reverence for light as a divine power, a reverence for creative power. The author's conclusions are illustrated by particu- lar reference to the work of Diirer, of Griinewald, and of Rembrandt. The Drawings of Martin Schongauer.-Taking a book written by Jacob Rosen- berg as a basis, M. LEHRS, in Burl. Mag. XLIV, 1924, pp. 133-134 (2 figs.), discusses the separation of the drawings by Schongauer from those by his school and reproduces two hitherto unpublished drawings in Henry Oppenheimer's collection in London. They represent the bust of a Turk and the head of an old man. Both are by Schongauer himself. Peter Fliitner in Augsburg.-Light is thrown upon the problem of Peter F16tner's early artistic activity by E. F. BANGE in Jb. Preuss. Kunsts. XLIV, 1923, pp. 107-117 (11 figs.), through a stylistic analysis of the putti that decorated the Fugger chapel in Augsburg. It is known that the decoration of this chapel was intrusted to Adolf Daucher. But several hands are distinguishable in the work, proving that Daucher was master of a considerable atelier. Several of the putti, especially fine in conception and execution, are shown by comparison with some putti by Fl6tner in Nuremberg to be by that artist. So it is safe to conclude that this important master of the early German Renaissance spent the first few years of the sixteenth century, until 1518, when the Fugger chapel decoration was completed, in Augsburg. After that he went to Italy for a few years and then to Nuremberg for his later work. GREAT BRITAIN The Coventry Tapestry.-A recent opportunity for examining and adequately photographing the famous Coventry tapestry prompts an article on the subject by A. F. KENDRICK in Burl. Mag. XLIV, 1924, pp. 83-89 (2 pls.). The evidence is conclusive that the tapestry was made for the space it now occupies, the wall under the great North Window of St. Mary's Hall at Coventry. The costumes date the work about 1510, and the technique proves it the product of weavers of the Low Countries, probably of Brussels. The upper central compartment with the figure of Justice was inserted in the late sixteenth century, apparently replacing an enthroned Trinity. AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY GENERAL AND MISCELLANEOUS Carvings from the Greater Antilles.-In Am. Anthr. XXV, 1923, pp. 525-558 (11 figs.), ADOLFO DE HOSTOS publishes a study of anthropomorphic carvings from the Greater Antilles. They range in size from pillar stones, some five or six feet high, to small amulets, and are classified as frontal and pectoral amulets, engraved celts and "dirks," disks and masks, massive human heads, three-pointed idols, elbow-stones, idols embodying the entire human form, pillar stones, pictographs, and other objects. The study of this material has led the author to the conclusion that "the aboriginal Arawak cultures seen in the light of the carved stone remains seem to be almost identical in the three regions-eastern Cuba, Haiti, and Porto Rico."</page><page sequence="30">NEWS ITEMS FROM THE AMERICAN SCHOOL OF CLASSICAL STUDIES AT ATHENS The official opening of the School was held on October 2, 1924. Since this date was the forty-second anniversary of the original opening, Professor Fowler, who was the first student registered in the School, talked informally on the difference between the life of a student in those days and present conditions for study in Greece. The Director outlined the work for the year and Professor Allen told of his plans for lecturing on problems connected with the Greek Theatre. On Tuesday, October 7, a party of six, consisting of Professor Allen, Miss Carter, Miss Broe, Mr. Broneer, Mr. Logan, and Mr. Stillwell started in two Fords, under the leadership of Mr. Blegen, on the Northern Trip. They went as far as Thebes the first night and followed the usual itinerary with the addition of a visit to the excavations now being conducted by Miss Goldman at Eutresis in Boeotia. With Miss Goldman are Miss Hansen and Miss Burr and Mr. De Jong, the architect who is drawing the plans of the walls excavated. During April and May the British School of Archaeology under the direction of Mr. Woodward, assisted by six students and Mr. Piet de Jong, architect, carried on excavations at Sparta. The stage buildings and the retaining wall of the the- atre were uncovered and one trench was dug to reveal the arrangement of the seats. On the face of the retaining wall of the left parados numerous inscriptions were found. The work is to be continued next year. For a period often weeks this spring a number of Swedish archaeologists under the direction of Mr. Persson resumed the work at Asine which had been begun last year. Beneath the Greek and Venetian walls, on the top of the acropolis, a Mid- dle Helladic settlement was discovered. Many fine vases were found here and the plans of some of the houses could be clearly traced. A lower city of the Early Helladic period was uncovered at the foot of the acropolis. On the opposite hill nearer the modern village, a temple and a settlement of the Geometric period have long been known. Farther down on the slope twenty-seven chamber tombs of the Mycenaean period were identified but only five of these have been excavated during this season. Their contents include many vases of the best period and other rare finds. Mr. Welter-Mauve of the German Archaeological Institute has been carrying on a campaign in Aegina at the Temple of Aphrodite. Here a part of a large Middle Helladic palace with numerous rooms, an outer wall with towers and corridors have been uncovered. All of the pottery, made of the typical greenish-yellow clay of the island, is of the Middle Helladic period. The French School conducted excavations at Mallia in Crete where they un- covered valuable evidence for the pre-hellenic period. The work at both Delos and Delphi was continued and in the region of the Hermeion at Delphi a complete series of archaic bronze statuettes was found. Other excavations were carried on at Philippi, Thasos and in Ionia. The Director of the American School and Mr. Thompson, the architect of the Gennadeion, have staked out the position of the new excavation house at Cor- inth (Mr. Shear's) and the digging for the foundations has begun. The work on the exterior of the Gennadeion is progressing rapidly-the houses are finished up to the top cornice and a considerable part of that is in place as well as a small portion of the cornice of the main library building. The marble cutting on the architrave, with its three steps and egg and dart moulding, and the cor- nice, above, with its magnificent lion's heads and elaborate mouldings, is done by</page><page sequence="31">men imported from Constantinople whose work compares favorably with that of the ancient Greek artisans. The columns of the eastern colonnade are in place as well as the two big antae at either end of the main portico. The latter have a beautiful honeysuckle design on their caps. The contract for the marble griffins at the corners of the roof has been given to an Athenian sculptor. Work has begun on the interior finishing of the east house and the white tiled walls and floors of the bathrooms are nearing completion-this house may be ready for occupancy by February. Some of the furniture has already arrived while other pieces are being made to order at various places in Europe. E. P. B. AMERICAN SCHOOL ATHENS</page></plain_text>
