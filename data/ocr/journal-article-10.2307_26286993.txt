<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE MODERNISM OF IAN mcewan's atonement Richard Robinson Atonement's highly allusive relationship with the canonical Eng lish novel, from Samuel Richardson and Jane Austen onward, seems to suggest the confident belle lettrism of an established author making a bid for a place in the Senior Common Room of English Literature. The novel is distinct from the rest of Ian McEwan's work in the sheer literariness of its self-fashioning, but its sense of canonical ancestry is, we find, consolatory rather than complacent. I agree with Domi nic Head's conclusion that "Atonement serves, if not to diminish the literary, then to hedge it in with many damaging reservations" (173). An important part of that "hedging in"—and, yes, even diminution derives from the novel's relationship to modernism. The reader's starting point is that Atonement began life as a modernist, more specifically Woolfian, short story called "Two Figures by a Fountain," sent to "C. C." (that is, Cyril Connolly, the editor of Ho rizon). McEwan commented that, in having Briony originally bury "her conscience beneath her stream of consciousness" in "Two Figures," he wished Atonement "to enter into a conversation with modernism and its dereliction of duty in relation to [what he has Connolly call] the backbone of plot" (qtd. in Finney 71). "Two Fountains" evades the moral responsibility of telling stories—Briony's whole story, Britain's social and political history—and is routed from Atonement itself. This near-complete excision indicts modernism as a whole. The implica tion is that, unlike "Two Fountains," Atonement has backbone and does its historical duty.

THE MODERNISM OF IAN mcewan's atonement Richard Robinson</page><page sequence="2">474 Ian McEwan's Atonement A general picture of Atonement's "conversation with modern ism" is beginning to emerge. Brian Finney observes that, for McEwan, "the ideology of modernism (especially its prioritization of stylistic innovation) has hidden moral consequences," manifested in Briony's discovery that style "really does have ethical implications" (72). Her mione Lee has touched on how the novel is critical of fiction's escap ist tendencies and its supposed lack of moral force. McEwan seems to be implicating a certain form of modernism: "are some forms of fiction—modernist, middle-class, limited to personal relations—more unforgivable than others?" Lee senses that a political critique of high modernist literature "edges" into the novel ("Memories" 16). In an important insight, Alistair Cormack argues that the first section of the novel does not so much stand for "an undermined classic real ism, but an undermined modernism" (77). The reconstruction of the Dunkirk retreat in the second section thus acts as a kind of reproach to unhistoricized modernism. Critics have also modified this sense that Atonement is in direct opposition to class-bound, plotless modernism. Geoff Dyer writes that the "subjective and interior transformation" in the way human nature was regarded, and indeed brought about by modernists like Woolf and Lawrence, can be seen in Atonement "to have interacted with the larger march of twentieth-century history" (8). An "interac tion" with history implies that modernism was intrinsically detached or solipsistic, but Dyer also recognizes that it had its transformative or progressive aspects. Laura Marcus thinks that McEwan's engage ment with Woolf remains ambiguous (94), as does Finney, who feels that her influence is both "positive and negative" (71). What assumptions the novel covertly makes about modernism, both as a literary period and a poetics, and what remains of mod ernism in the finished text, is the subject of this article. Connolly's appearance as C. C. alerts us to interwar debates about modernist innovation and prompts the thought that, to appreciate how Atone ment self-consciously undoes and rewrites the modernist novel, the reader should return to its predecessors. Though numerous other modernist intertexts could be fruitfully analyzed in similar vein, di rect comparisons are made here with Woolf's The Waves, Rosamond Lehmann's Dusty Answer, and Henry James's What Maisie Knew. Atonement's silence about the Joycean novel—a ghostly modernist trajectory—also furthers our understanding of McEwan's dialogue with modernism. Cyril Connolly and C. C. Atonement seems to ventriloquize modernism and then to silence it. At least that is the diachronic literary evolution we are</page><page sequence="3">Robinson 475 asked to observe, though we may note that, unlike, say, A. S. Byatt and John Fowles, McEwan devises the novel so that he avoids hav ing to do much pastiche. Nevertheless, Atonement pretends to be a modernist palimpsest that has undergone continual erasure. Over six decades, the "Two Figures" story, originally influenced by Woolf, Lehmann, and Elizabeth Bowen, has almost been redrafted out of existence until, we are invited to think, it has metamorphosed into the book we have in our hands. A directly genealogical relationship with modernism and twentieth-century literary history culminates in the publication of Atonement at that century's end: "BT London 1999" (349), or Ian McEwan, Atonement, 2001. C. C. is figured as a key influence in diverting Briony from Wool fian modernism, emerging as a Tiresias-like critic who already knows what the younger Briony cannot bring herself to confront. Briony infers that C. C.'s criticism of her story relates to its moral evasiveness, that she has hidden behind her modernist style and "drown[ed] her guilt" in streams of consciousness (320). Connolly asks piercing questions of the young protagonist: "Might she come between [the couple] in some disastrous fashion? Or bring them closer, either by design or accident? Might she innocently expose them somehow, to the young woman's parents perhaps? . . . Might the young couple come to use her as a messenger?" (313). As character or author, Briony does come between the lovers, does bring them closer (in fiction), does expose them, and is used once as a messenger—though not quite in the full L. P. Hartley manner. Underneath the shimmering descriptions of light and stone, of the "crystalline present moment" (312), lurks a guilty unwillingness to tell the story: it is the absent narrative, the Aristotelian plot tissue, that contains the lifeblood of truth. At the same time, however, we momentarily toy with the idea that that story has no foundational reality in Briony's life, but actually originates in Connolly's suggestions, including the changing of the vase (from Ming to Meissen [18]) and the piazza (from Navona to Barberini [24]). Thinking at this stage that Briony made it all up is, traditionally, an unhelpful fallback—though it will be rather useful in the long term. At the least a reminder, a proleptic warning about the novel's formal status, is triggered here; we should not surrender too readily to the enchantments of realism. Aporetic questions will always haunt such moments. Was the "real" vase the un-lifelike Ming? Was there a vase? If not, was there a fountain? The furniture of realism can be changed or removed at a stroke. The novel's metafictional identity is to some unmasked sud denly, to others covertly imbricated into the whole. In both cases, however, we come to realize that postmodernist provisionality, or a threat of textual erasure, is designed to modify modernist claims for the autonomy, monumentalism, and transcendence of literature.</page><page sequence="4">476 Ian McEwan's Atonement Brian McHale argues that postmodernism shifts from the epistemo logical preoccupations of modernism toward an ontological unhing ing. Connolly's letter brings just such an ontological jolt, violating the boundaries between real and fictional worlds well before the metafictiona! adjunct of the epilogue. This postmodernist moment is tellingly embedded within a discussion of how a writer influenced by Woolf should represent the world of which she is a part—that is, within a discussion of modernist epistemology. C. C.'s letter is thus the site of a contested or transitional poet ics and sharpens general considerations of how Atonement places itself in relation to canonical twentieth-century novels. Head writes that "the fictional letter convinces because it enunciates the kind of position that is recognizably Connolly's" (157). It is true that Con nolly's hyper-sensitivity to what he saw as the iniquities of Woolfian prose is accurate. Avowedly anti-Bloomsbury, he liked neither Woolf's characters ("lifeless anatomical slices, conceived all in the same mood, unreal creations of genteel despair"), nor her prose ("lush feminine Keatsian familiarity that comes from being sensually too at home in the world") (qtd. in Lewis 251).1 F. R. Leavis, a very different type of critic but also an important off-stage presence in Atonement, wrote along the same lines about Woolf. Although he valued To the Lighthouse, Leavis complained that Woolf lacked "moral interest in action" in favor of a "sophisticated aestheticism" (qtd. in Hayman 62)—identifying here the very objections to modernism that Atone ment seems to endorse. Head writes of Connolly's distinction between the Mandarin and the vernacular: Woolf is a Mandarin—whose characteristics are not only perfectionism and horror of cliché, but also "indolence," "ego tism," and "exhibitionism." Such writers not only escape vernacular flatness but also lack their sense of construction and "discipline in the conception and execution of the book" (158). If Connolly is argu ing for a tempering of Mandarin exhibitionism, he is not necessarily arguing against modernism. Stefan Collini's appraisal of Connolly, for example, emphasizes his unclassifiability as a literary critic, but rec ognizes that Connolly's "consistent championing of Modernism" was the nearest he came to having a cause (15). The real Cyril Connolly had the same modernist sympathies as Woolf: both were in flight from the middlebrow. Connolly was a defender of high modernist difficulty, though that defense sometimes took critical or arch form. Admittedly he wrote that Proust and Joyce were "very sick men" (273); there is something Lukécsian in this. But he also writes, in an awestruck way that Lukacs never could have, of the "giants" and "saints of modern bourgeois art like Henry James and Flaubert" (Connolly 14-15).</page><page sequence="5">Robinson 477 McEwan's C. C. is pushing for more plot, more forward impetus. This vernacularism might, however, give the wrong impression about his attitude to British and European modernism. Connolly was ready to comment open-mindedly, if not effusively, about other supposedly spineless, plotless books—like Finnegans Wake, which he deemed "respect-worthy and readable" (14). We "must tolerate writing we do not understand," he wrote, "because literature is in essence a series of new universes enforced on a tardy public by their creators" (15). The "real" Connolly defended the autonomy, even incomprehensibil ity, of the modernist text. Frank Kermode, in a gnomic aside, remarks that Connolly would never have written such a letter, implying perhaps that its appearance tends to that of ludic, transgressive postmodernism (9). Whether his letter is plausible or not, Connolly should not be automatically transformed into an apologist for the fluently plotted psychological realism of the later Briony. "C. C." is critical of Woolfian modernism, as indeed was Connolly, but his scepticism toward "the techniques of Mrs Woolf" (Atonement 312) should not then be conflated with a supposed resistance to the ideology of modernism. To delineate Briony's development as a writer, C. C. must function with a consis tency and tractability that the real Connolly stubbornly did not have. This is not an inadvertent misrepresentation: the teasing C. C. of the letter—defiantly not Cyril Connolly—is a preemptive maneuver and a kind of warning. It tells us that "Connolly" is produced by and for the codes of this text; the simultaneous ontological jolt is a textual self-defense, reminding us that the novel should not simply be read off against mid-century British literary culture. Woolfian Modernism The most conspicuous strain of modernism in Atonement is Woolfian. Although the overall structure of Atonement bears more resemblance to To the Lighthouse, it is The Waves that exerts the strongest influence on the novella Briony writes as a nurse: she feels excited by its "design" and "pure geometry" and by the "defining uncertainty" of the modern age (Atonement 281), which it gloriously captures. Indeed Briony appreciates just that structural discipline in The Waves that Connolly claimed was lacking in the Mandarins. Like Woolf, she has rejected the "rusted machinery" of plot and character in favor of "thought, perception, sensations," attempting to repre sent the "onward roll [of a] conscious mind as a river through time" (281). At the age of eighteen, Briony is a modernist down to her bootstraps—and in 1940, a modernist out of time.</page><page sequence="6">478 Ian McEwan's Atonement In The Waves nine interludes—describing how light falls on landscape, seascape, and interior—punctuate the soliloquies of six speakers, individuals within a group, as they pass through life. Al though turns are taken and distributed evenly, and although certain important patterns can be discerned—Bernard, for instance, starts most sections—this idea of the mathematically determined architec ture of the novel can be taken too far. Woolf thought of The Waves as a "playpoem" (Dick 65): its design is nonlinear, rhythmic, and recurrent—in short, wave-like—but it retains at least a sense of the potential unpredictability, or non-instrumentality, of its prose. "Two Figures" apparently permutâtes between Briony, Cecilia, and Robbie, and their perspectives of the fountain scene, while indulg ing in description of light and consciousness, over scores of pages. Design is in place, but a deadening stasis too: Briony has evidently failed to render the river-like, Bergsonian "roll" through time—while The Waves avoids such stasis, taking us from childhood to the onset of "Death" (which Bernard confronts unyieldingly [248]) without the aid of conventional plot and character. Although Atonement moves between its characters' perspectives, it does not attempt to bring together a multiply-selved, common consciousness. Like The Waves, though much more cursorily, the first section of Atonement follows the sun across the sky on a single day. Cecilia sees that the "south-east aspect of the French windows had permitted parallelograms of morning sunlight to advance across the powder blue carpet" (20). This idea of advancing and receding light, of the sun outlining geometrical shapes within interiors, is characteristic of The Waves, in which, for example, the evening sun "made chairs and tables mellower and inlaid them with lozenges of brown and yellow" (174)—though perhaps Woolf's "lozenge," paired with "inlaid" to sug gest marquetry, is not quite as Pythagorean as "parallelogram." It is useful to think of a residuum of the Woolfian "Two Fig ures" as contributing to the early longueurs Dyer thought rather un-McEwan-like (8). Even the "reformed," un-modernist Briony al lows deliberate mannerism—what Dyer calls "pallid qualifiers and disposable adverbs," such as "gently rocking sheet of water" and "coyly drooping" nettle heads (8)—to stand in Part One. C. C., for all his complaints, commends Briony's description of the "estate's open parkland, which today had a dry and savage look, roasting like a savannah, where isolated trees threw harsh stumpy shadows and the long grass was already stalked by the leonine yellow of high summer" (Atonement 38). But is such a sentence Woolfian? The shadows are made three dimensionally "stumpy" (Woolf, Waves 89), like the "wedges" of sun in The Waves (123). Woolf enjoys ambitious, even risky, similitude:</page><page sequence="7">Robinson 479 birds are like "skaters rollicking arm-in-arm" (21); the "hills, curved and controlled, seemed bound back by thongs, as a limb is laced by muscles" (88). Such anthropomorphism later sweeps outward, over continents, to yoke exotic images together: waves drum "on the shore, like turbaned warriors . . . with poisoned assegais" (60). Briony's description is more conventionally transcontinental, and also dependent on the punning association of "stalked" with "leonine" that brings the savannah to Surrey. Woolf's eye does indeed peer under stalks in The Waves, and she is not averse to word play that finds, for example, eternity in a tea urn (77). However, her commit ment in the interludes to sensuousness and sometimes to ekphrastic correspondences would have excluded, I think, too much lexical self consciousness of this sort. Rhoda asks: '"Like1 and 'like' and 'like'— but what is the thing that lies beneath the semblance of the thing?" (134). Briony's description would not risk the uninhibited resistance to dead metaphor we see in The Waves, which pushes the poetic figure beyond or beneath a relatively commonplace "semblance" that imagines parkland "roasting like a savannah." Her sentence is pre served, nonetheless, as a textual remainder she cannot bring herself to discard. On second reading, it marks a certain indulgent nostalgia for what Briony later comes to think of as the modernist spell she was under, as well as being the prized record of the first praise she received as a serious writer. The pastiched Woolf style of the first section is held in dialogic tension with the textures of Woolf's own prose. For example, the interior of Marshall's room is perceived by Cecilia as follows: "the air was smooth with the scent of wax, and in the honeyed light, the gleaming surfaces of the furniture seemed to ripple and breathe. As her approach altered her angle of view, the revellers on the lid of an ancient trousseau chest writhed into dance steps. Mrs. Turner must have passed through that morning" (46). Sure enough, the synaes thetic effects of The Waves are suggested ("smooth air"), the way light liquefies solid matter into the amorphous ("rippling" furniture), and the playful bringing of the objective world to writhing life. But in The Waves there is no recognition that such still-life surfaces must be well polished—by one of the drudging class like Mrs. Turner— before their luminous beauty can be revealed to the upper-middle class observer. Woolf, in order to avoid what she considered a risk of bathos, changed her mind about including working-class characters in The leaves because "she could not 'hear' the voices of Florrie the kitchen maid, or Albert, 'whose father was a cowman'" (Briggs 75). The equivalent of Mrs. Turner had appeared as Mrs. McNab in To the Lighthouse, but now could not interrupt the genteel ethereality of The Waves. McEwan reinserts her as the mother who polishes and</page><page sequence="8">480 Ian McEwan's Atonement "passes through" the English country house but is unable to check its Bloomsburyite excess. Despite such neo-Woolfian fragments, our main impression of Atonement is that the textuality of The Waves is more omitted than retained—even in the first section. Briony's ambition, in emulating that novel, had been to "reproduce the clear light of a summer's morning, the sensations of a child standing at a window, the curve and dip of a swallow's flight over a pool of water" (Atonement 282). Though Briony's feelings by the window are captured, it is not their sensory immediacy but their proleptic function in an overarching moral narrative that is important; a handful of paragraphs, out of nearly two hundred pages, are devoted to natural description; and the dipping of the swallow's wings in dark pools, one of the recur rent bird motifs of The Waves (85, 103, 135), is conspicuous by its absence. Though the structural design of Atonement as a whole is not free of a Woolfian iconicity, its descriptive passages are modified and circumscribed, pushed back into mere mise-en-scène.2 The Waves was, for Woolf, the culmination of her journey away from the "appalling narrative business of the realist: getting on from lunch to dinner" (Dick 71).3 Toward the end of the novel, Bernard asks, "But how describe the world seen without a self?" (239). What Woolf called the "eyelessness" or disembodiment of The Waves is not its terminus, however (Mepham 143). Lee states that "Bernard's mystical experience of a loss of personality is not the moral conclu sion of the book": he then bangs his spoon on the table in a reas sertion of self (Novels 178-79). In momentarily placing Bernard on the precipice of subjectivity, however, Woolf still gestures toward a trajectory the modernist novel would later take. Bernard's answer to his own question, "There are no words" (239), surprisingly points forward to Beckett's late modernist trilogy, in which decrepit or even tually bodiless subjects use words to obliterate words. The Waves pushes the novel to its generic limits and can be regarded not as a leftover of 1920s high modernism, but rather as an early work of late modernism. Having previously designed novels like Black Dogs and Enduring Love, in which ideas were schematically pitted against each other, McEwan is writing toward a presiding sense of character in Atone ment— the restoration of a new type of selfhood, after modernism, that can also subvert the controlling realism of that old Lawrentian bugbear, the "stable ego." In Laura Marcus's view, McEwan turns to Woolf "to play out the dissolution and recreation of character in the novel" (94). In the case of The Waves, we see that Bernard's final vision may strive for some kind of unity, but that the speakers are deliberately denied the full dimensions of embodied character.</page><page sequence="9">Robinson 481 "Woolf" has to function in a certain way for Briony's development to take place as it does, and in the process our idea of Woolfian textu ality has—with the helping hand of C. C.—to be somewhat travestied. C. C.'s strategically placed criticism of Briony's evasive "streams of consciousness," while not even describing the technique of The Waves accurately (the characters speak—in formalized monologues or soliloquies), is analogous to more general objections to indulgent modernist subjectivity. For the purposes of the self-generating nar rative of Atonement, we have to ignore the defense of The Waves made by critics like Jane Marcus, who highlights Percival's imperial last stand and fall as the target of Woolf's feminist irony, and, in a rather different way, Michael Tratner, who associates the Woolfs' contemporary interest in non-individualist, collectivist psychology, from which he sees The Waves as emerging, with their socialist sympathies (221). On aesthetic grounds, too, The Waves stands firm against the imputation of otiose descriptiveness. "The water that stood round the old boat was dark as if mussels had been steeped in it" (Woolf, Waves 174): need, or can, or should a story improve on lines, such as these, that challenge the very passivity of descriptive writing? The following passage (which seems to anticipate Larkin's "The Whitsun Weddings") follows Bernard's approach to London by train: "Bridges fledged with houses rise from the mist. Factories, cathedrals, glass domes, institutions and theatres erect themselves ... I am become part of this missile hurled at the city ... Over us all broods a splendid unanimity. We are enlarged and solemnized and brushed into unifor mity" (91). Such writing is vertebrate, its dynamism independent of the forward momentum of plot. The narrative of Atonement and the prose skeins of The Waves seem, in such instances, to be separate species of writing. C. C.'s criticism of Briony's Woolfianism has been accepted, by extrapolation, as a strategic criticism of modernism at large, and the fluently-plotted Atonement, so different from "Two Figures," as a final repudiation of modernism. Though this is the path we are invited to follow, direct intertextual comparison reveals it to be treacherous, as it risks a reductive evaluation of modernist textuality. Rosamond Lehmann's Dusty Answer The Woolfian influence on the descriptive style of "Two Figures" is not the only one mentioned in Connolly's letter to Briony. McEwan imagines Bowen finding the prose of "Two Figures" "too full, too cloying" but with "redeeming shades of Dusty Answer" (Atonement</page><page sequence="10">482 Ian McEwan's Atonement 314). To what extent is Lehmann's debut novel of 1927 a manifest influence on Atonement? First, as with Woolf, fragments of Lehmann's style are visible. A summer evening is evoked in Dusty Answer as follows: She saw the sky beginning to blossom with evening. The sun came out below flushed clouds and all the treetops were lit up, sombrely floating and rocking in a dark gold wash of light. Across the river the fields looked rich and wistful, brimming with sun, cut with long violet shadows. The river ran a little wildly, scattered over with fierce, fire-opal flakes. But all was softening, flattening. The clouds were drifting away, the wind was quiet now; there would be an evening as still, as carved as death. (Lehmann 26) There is a certain lushness here, an attentiveness to colors and light. It is no accident that the word "wash" is used in Atonement, too: "the western sky formed a thin yellow wash" (78); and even, as Laura Marcus has noticed, in Part Two: "he saw a receding wash of grey and blue fading in a haze towards the setting sun" (194). The writing is intended on occasions to be deliberately painterly, perhaps suggesting the Imagist influence on modernist prose. The evening in Dusty Answer, "as still, as carved as death," may echo in Cecilia's earlier contemplation of a scene that "looked carved, fixed," as if "all outcomes, on all scales—from the tiniest to the most colossal—were already in place" (53): the stifling evening will indeed put in place their own outcomes, which is death in wartime. Even in her admiration for Dusty Answer, the fictional Bowen implies that an inferior imitation of its style risks self-indulgence. Evidence has to be shown, in the revised "Two Fountains," that the sub-Lehmann style has been modified. A corrective comment such as this—"A Fauvist dedicated to improbable colour might have imagined a landscape this way" (78)—is an academic meta-description out of keeping with the rapt consciousness of Lehmann's protagonist, Judith. McEwan (or Briony) describes the clouds as "high altitude," which is too meteorological for Lehmann. Even the effulgent sections of Atone ment are a little astringent, then. Its views are also framed: Cecilia looks between curtains that "frame a partial view of cloudless sky" (20), Briony looks at the fountain scene from an upstairs window, and Robbie can only see a "tiny portion" (78) of the sky from his position in the bath. These narrative skylights warn us that we are not seeing the full picture in Atonement— whereas in Dusty Answer the scene is poured forth in unfettered lyrical expressionism. Dusty Answer and Atonement are both postwar texts, in the broadest sense. In Lehmann's novel war populates nightmares with</page><page sequence="11">Robinson 483 the ghosts of soldiers who did not return. The haunting presence of the returning soldier was a commonplace of 1920s literature (in the German Heimkehrerroman, or in Rebecca West's The Return of the Soldier, for example). Judith has a nightmare in which the ghost of Charlie, the beautiful youth killed in the trenches, returns to the group of friends and then gradually disappears into "a dark misty solitude of night and water" while his voice breaks "ringingly, in anguish: 'Come back\"' (Lehmann 47). This recalls the important motif "Come back" in Atonement. It is what Cecilia says to bring the child Briony back from her nightmares, and what Cecilia clinchingly writes to Robbie—"77/ wait for you. Come back'"—in her first, last, and every letter to France (202-03, 210, 212). "Come back" is, we finally discover, the author Briony's cry to Robbie the dead soldier and Cecilia the dead sister; it is the always present burden (in both senses) of her "nightmare of the dark" (Cecilia sends Robbie the Auden poem [203]), and the ghost she exorcises in this final draft of her novel. The middle section of Dusty Answer is set in the cloistered environment of the all-girls Girton College, Cambridge, from which Cecilia has also recently come down. In Dusty Answer Judith's ado lescent intimacies with her male friends are cooled by the protocol of the collegiate system, which was claustrophobically protective of this generation of female students. This has happened to Robbie and Cecilia at Cambridge, too: the chaperoned tea party (two men, two women) figures in both novels as the most effective of anaphrodi siacs. McEwan reflects historically on the gender politics of interwar education through the unsympathetic opinions of Emily Tallis, who is scathing about the life her daughter has led. Emily's précis—smoking in the bedroom, "the Halls, the Maids' Dancing, the Little-Go, and the self-adoring slumming, the knickers drying before the electric fire and two to a hairbrush" (64)—perfectly captures the world that Judith Earle inhabits at Cambridge. But Emily cannot admit, as Lehmann does, that these first collegiate love affairs, rivalries, and jealousies were often between women. The association of Dusty Answer (a novel that predates The Waves) and Atonement mediates the directness of Woolf's influence, and it also reminds us that Briony belongs to a generation of women writers, like Elizabeth Bowen and Lehmann, who overlapped with high modernism.4 McEwan initially intended a pastiched "About the Author" biography to be included at the end of the novel (Finney 71): he was trying to recreate, in Briony, the sort of writer who would have to be rediscovered by Virago, as it were. As Lee has suggested, in enter ing Briony's inner world, and androgynously performing a role in a period drama as an aspiring novelist influenced by Woolf, McEwan inserts women's writing into the often male-dominated accounts of modernism ("Memories" 16).</page><page sequence="12">484 Ian McEwan's Atonement What Briony Knew: Jamesian Modernism Atonement sophisticatedly manipulates the relationship between narrative control and restricted perspective. It is no surprise, then, that McEwan's mention of Henry James has been picked up by crit ics. McEwan stated that he wanted to be "like James in What Maisie Knew, to use the full resources of an adult mentality remembering herself" (Finney 72). In his review "Point of View," Frank Kermode commented that "one is tempted to imagine that the best readers of [Atonement] might be Henry James and Ford Madox Ford" (9), signaling a kinship not only with Woolfian modernism, but also with the proto-modernism of James and his influence on the "impression ist" technique of Ford and Conrad. Generally, the triangulated perspectives of Briony, Robbie, and Cecilia may recall what Ian Watt called the "multidimensional" qual ity of James's method (533). Watt comments of The Ambassadors that "we and the narrator are inside Strether's mind, and yet we are also outside it, knowing more about Strether than he knows about himself" (539). Our sense of "the two Brionys"—Briony the character, who can only see a restricted picture, and Briony the concealed nar rator, condemned repeatedly to assume but remain detached from her adolescent point of view and to imagine herself into other ways of seeing—makes strange, proleptic play with what Watt calls James's "counterpoint of intelligence and bewilderment" (539). Atonement particularly benefits from What Maisie Knew in exploring the idea that "point of view" is not a merely visual per spectivism but a moral way of looking at the world—and thus one that can be exploited. The slightly unreliable narrator of the wholly adult world of McEwan's Enduring Love had informed us that "Believ ing is seeing" (181), and McEwan went on to use this as a founding principle of Atonement: "The truth instructed [Briony's] eyes" (169). The Jamesian "doing" of perspective (qtd. in Kermode 8) is all the more attractive and technically demanding when it concerns the in compatible but interpenetrating moral worlds of child and adult. An exercise in narrative virtuosity gains in pathos because it complicates our potentially sentimental responses to the conventional opposition of innocence and experience. In What Maisie Knew, we seem to have been presented with a narrative paradigm—of the manipulated child being initiated into adulthood—that will produce the idea of the child as a victim. But in remaining to some extent above the fray, keeping "the torch of virtue alive in an air tending infinitely to smother it," as James said in his preface (Maisie 4), Maisie has a certain robustness. A long-term pro jection of the consequences of her upbringing is not made available by the text itself, however. Barbara Eckstein contrasts What Maisie</page><page sequence="13">Robinson 485 Knew to Lolita, in which Humbert's meeting with the adult Dolores represents a necessary démystification of the erotic muse (191). We are given no such future view of Maisie the adult and are more pessimistically left to ask whether she will be able to preserve her "moral sense" (which Mrs. Wix regards as a kind of possession) into her own adult life (219). Her future freedom may have been terminally compromised: the limited perceptual access of the child is, we learn, neither a protective screen nor a guarantee of innocence. Millicent Bell has made the point that we should not come to equate Maisie's eventual acquisition of forbidden adult knowledge with "what Maisie knows," which is an enduring, instinctive sense of things, expressive in its silence and not dependent on adult language. Bell has written that Maisie has "a fidelity to a presocial silence," a sacred inner knowledge that stands outside—somehow above—tainted adult discourse (244). Thus it may be misleading simply to say, fol lowing Genettian narratology, that the narrative is focalized through Maisie, if we take this to mean that, because we see as she sees, we will understand what she thinks and feels. While Maisie's reflec tive center of consciousness is ever present, there is a silence at its heart: notwithstanding the ambition of the preface to lay everything before Maisie, to aim for "completeness and coherency" (Maisie 5), this is not a Woolfian, Lawrentian, or Joycean attempt to render full interiority. If we cannot listen to Maisie's thoughts, we can attend to the narrator's—but this mediating voice has become a critical crux. The narrator is, from the very beginning, fastidiously adult: there is no question of James being restricted to what he thought of as the child's terms of translation (Teahan 221). It is thus significant that James refers to the "gross immoralities" of adult behavior in his preface (9), but never as a narrator in his novel. There is an impersonal, typi cally modernist effect in not being told how appallingly the parents and step-parents are behaving, and we are left to debate whether such actions body forth "moral horror" or merely "moral squalor."5 The adults are thrown off balance by Maisie's knowingness—and this includes the narrator who, for all the sophistication of his register, is left helpless: "I so despair of courting her noiseless mental footsteps" (208). In the novel's last line we are told that Mrs. Wix "still had room for wonder at what Maisie knew" (268)—and that wonder, Bell comments, is shared by the despairing narrator, with his inadequate adult language, and the reader, who are both brought to "the brink of mystery" (261). Sheila Teahan argues more radically that this deconstructive "abyss" in the text accounts for these late intrusions (232). The nar rator is implicated in the creation of Maisie's knowledge: his despair</page><page sequence="14">486 Ian McEwan's Atonement is "the pretence that Maisie's preverbal knowledge exists prior to the narrator's figurative translation of it" (225). A narrative duplicity or subterfuge emerges, according to Teahan. Having violated the rules of the text, the narrator reaches an irreconcilable impasse, "a definitive collapse of Maisie's (and James's) epistemological footing" (232). In what ways does or does not Atonement reproduce James's template? An immediate inversion is detectable. Briony, still a child, exploits the assumptions and mores of the English upper-middle class to which she securely belongs. While the fallen, adulterous state of Maisie's parental quartet renders love the most unstable of signifiers (Bell 254), in Atonement the virgin adult lovers are the innocents whose sexuality is perverted—made criminal—by the child. Briony's fidelity to silence is a kind of profanity: half-knowing that the truth of what she has or has not seen resides deep, safely nonverbalized in her consciousness, she can carefully perform her role with a precocious, writerly faith in language and narrative, the adult encryptions of which are a happy refuge from the truth. It is within the "sensitively created space" of police interrogations that "she was able to build and shape her narrative in her own words and establish the key facts" (Atonement 180). Faking testimony is like writing fiction. Briony has a need to fuse the semantically separate categories of seeing and knowing, as Laura Marcus has recently observed (89). Briony tells Lola, "I've known him all my life. I saw him" (167). The writer she has become on that day "needed to know, to understand everything that came her way" (180). Everything must be interpré table, usable, dynamic, noncontingent; every detail must fit with her personal vision of a greater truth. In short, the budding author must know everything she sees. The police inspector tries to cleave apart what Briony has welded together: "You saw him then." "I know it was him." "Let's forget what you know. You're saying you saw him." "Yes, I saw him." (181) The older author-narrator proleptically wonders and despairs at how the younger Briony's "guilt refined the methods of self-torture, thread ing the beads of detail into an eternal loop, a rosary to be fingered for a lifetime" (173). The "key facts" are beads on a string that seem to be causally connected but end up as a metafictional Möbius strip (or eternal loop): I see what I know; I know what I see. Perhaps Briony really did not know. She is complicit with the adult codes of her social class but does not possess an instinctive knowledge of what is really happening: a deadly combination. Maisie,</page><page sequence="15">Robinson 487 on the other hand, sees and knows. She has looked back and seen that Sir Claude was not there—on the balcony. "Oh I know" are her last words (268): she knows he has gone to Mrs. Beale. At this point, Maisie is the same age as Briony during the first part of Atonement. We might speculate that she would not know that Robbie and Cecilia were making love in the library because she had not yet learned that language-shaped concept, but she would know—pace Freud—that they were not doing harm to each other.6 "The muddled state too is one of the very sharpest realities," James says in the preface (Maisie 9). There is a Jamesian irony in the young Briony's conclusion that "divorce was a mundane unravelling that could not be reversed, and therefore offered no opportunities to the storyteller: it belonged in the realm of disorder" (Atonement 8-9). The reality of impending divorce, which brings Briony's cousins into the Tallises' house, functions in opposition to the fairy tale mar riage that is meant to conclude The Trials of Arabella. Briony is also appalled by the "squalor and disorder" of Cecilia's clothes-strewn bedroom (177): mess equates to a ruinous sexuality. But even as she is repelled, Briony begins on this day to realize that "muddle" and "disorder," the separateness of minds, the conflict and attraction of bodies, an abiding "confusion and misunderstanding" (40), demand the complex messiness of a modernist poetics. There is an inverse correlation between the powerlessness ex pressed by James's narrator and the guilty power to which the narrator admits late in Atonement. James Wood writes that in McEwan's world "what is most important are our secrets, not our mysteries" (28), a distinction also explored by Peter Mathews. McEwan cannot, through his surrogate Briony, forego authorial control—cannot "let the ropes fall from his hands," as Wood has imagined it (33). James's complex ity, on the other hand, settles on the unsolvable: how the "muddled state" of human behavior brings us, to repeat Bell's phrase, to that "brink of mystery."7 As a work of early modernism, What Maisie Knew created an epistemological gap that Atonement consciously reenters. In the end, however, Atonement takes the principle of obliquity and indirection, of not being told the truths of adulthood, to a centripetal, nonmodernist solution—the secret of the novel's composition. Atonement and Joyce The absence of Joyce from Atonement's conversation with the modernist novel is not surprising but it is instructive. Reflections on Ulysses would distort Atonement's attempt to establish a consistent sense of period. In the early 1930s Ulysses was, like Lady Chatterley's Lover (a novel that Robbie owns), still an obscene text—that is both</page><page sequence="16">488 Ian McEwan's Atonement off stage and under the counter and very far from being a central text of what was yet to be called "modernism." McEwan does not break the frame of the coeval and evolving definitions of the contemporary interwar novel. As the archetypal location of the country house suggests, Atone ment aligns itself with the English novel and, nested within that, the English modernist novel. Of course—as the previous example of James reveals—this latter category is strange and problematic: any guide must record that modernism interrupted the stately teleol ogy of English (and indeed other) cultural nationalisms. Atonement seems to deliberately ignore the un-English model of modernism cosmopolitan, exilic—which is one of its defining characteristics. The often-quoted question from Atonement—"How can a nov elist achieve atonement when, with her absolute power of deciding outcomes, she is also God?" (371)—echoes Stephen Dedalus's even more well-quoted aesthetic credo, which derives from Flaubert. Deda lus concludes that the "personality of the artist [should pass] into the narration itself" so that it is "refined itself out of existence" and his comparison of the artist to "the God of the creation . . . within or behind or beyond his handiwork, paring his fingernails" (Joyce, Portrait 233). Briony, too, is "within" the work, but her perspective is surrounded and undercut by the competing viewpoints of the other characters. She is "behind" it, in the sense that she is covertly respon sible for it. She is "beyond" it in two senses: temporally, she waits for us in the epilogue, outside of the novel proper that she has com pleted; the publication of the previously libellous text also confirms she has now died and is beyond reach. Briony, once the modernist, is now a parodied demiurge of nineteenth-century realism: godless late-twentieth-century existentialism, rather than Joycean apostasy, has produced the "bleakest realism" (Atonement 371) of all previous drafts and discounts an afterlife for Robbie and Cecilia. We might playfully think of Atonement as a postmodernist pal impsest of a modernist Künstlerroman. Joyce, oscillating between involvement and detachment, speculates self-reflexively on the development not of a life but of an aesthetic practice that will en able the book we are reading to be written. Briony too objectivizes her narrative, framing a portrait of the nascent artist at ironic third person remove. Briony's invisibility as author preserves the surprise of "BT London 1999," though this invisibility is not quite total: we just about discern traces of her authorship of the book on second read ing. Dyer's implication is that McEwan (in authorial guise) would not commit dusty aesthetic solecisms, just as Joyce would not indulge the lyrical excesses he assigns to his earlier, Dedalean self—but that he indulges nonetheless, sous rature.</page><page sequence="17">Robinson 489 T. S. Eliot's notion of the extinction of the artist's personality has a certain currency, too. Briony has vascular dementia and her life is about to be decreated. As Earl G. Ingersoll has observed, the monument of a lifetime's artwork can, in time-honored fashion, pre serve her, as well as preserve the unaging lovers of the library who have long been extinct in life (254-55). At the same time, there is a movement away from Eliotic modernism. Robbie, the aspiring doctor, opposes what "East Coker" contends, that there is "only a limited value/ In the knowledge derived from experience" (Eliot 18). Robbie has excelled under Leavis's tuition, shares his literary tastes, and has submitted poems to Eliot at Criterion. But for him literature tout court is not enough: life must be experienced. Robbie's view takes on an obvious poignancy when we discover his life to come is imagined and extended by Briony in this, her novel: literature will be all he has and all that is left of him. Modernist theories about the impersonality of the artwork turn out to have an unstated, subterranean relevance to Atonement that may, strangely enough, deepen our empathie—or personal—response. As we have seen, for all its canonical self-awareness, Atonement declines to recognize how—in the prose of Gertrude Stein, of The Waves, of Finnegans Wake or of The Unnameable—the modernist novel dismantled the grandeur of its constitutive mimetic language, brick by brick. Atonement, in bridging the gap between the modern ist and postmodernist novel, inherits a healthy replenishment of the genre as if that threat of dissolution had never occurred. Atonement puts what Joyce called "cutanddry grammar and goahead plot" (Let ters 3:146)—the instrumental language of the novel's narrative above the exuberance or opacity of the signifier. The unsplit sign is not allowed to threaten the controlling language—and thus the controlling plotting—of the author: that, indeed, is the principle on which Atonement at last shows itself to be founded. There is an exception. When Briony discovers that she is a sto ryteller rather than a playwright, she is enchanted by the idea that the story was a "form of telepathy," a "magical process." Language is made up of symbols that communicate the perfect simultaneous coincidence of reading and understanding: "You saw the word castle, and it was there" (Atonement 37). All writers, we might suppose, are initially attracted to this alchemical process: it is on such a form of telepathy that language bequests its gifts to the true-seeming novel. This is Briony's view of language at the inception of her novelistic career. She will come to know, with or without terms such as logo centrism, that language is fallen—that there are c-words other than castle that disturb this easy communion of word and thing. When she</page><page sequence="18">490 Ian McEwan's Atonement opens Robbie's letter, she runs through anagrams, rhymes, and ablaut series and later spells the c-word backwards to Lola. What Briony tells herself is "the word" is a substitution here: the word itself is absent, even though the whole passage is about it. The letters themselves become ideograms: the "smooth-hollowed, partly enclosed forms of its first three letters were as clear as a set of anatomical drawings" (114). For Briony this "typographical demon" defamiliarizes magically mimetic language, breaking it up into particles. Even though the word has been made flesh, the sign has blasphemously split. McEwan seems to be archly but only passingly nodding to how the great architectural design of the novel can be undone by what Ingersoll refers to as the "fugitive" signs of disobedient language (253). There is a moment, soon after Briony opens the letter and just before she enters the library, when she overhears a fragment of the twins' conversation: "'It's got a 'u' in it, actually,'" and his brother replying, "'I don't care. Put it in the envelope'" (Atonement 122). Our first reaction to this, and perhaps hers, is that the taboo word has reached even younger eyes. The sign has escaped Robbie, and escaped Briony, and is running rampant around the house. An expla nation is waiting for us, however: when the twins run away, the text they leave begins: "We are gong to run away becase Lola and Betty are horid to us" (142-43). The u is missing from the word because. It is suggestive that McEwan solves the mystery for us, ties up those loose ends. The autonomous modernist text would not feel obliged to restore the missing u. There are plenty of solved puzzles in Ulysses, to be sure: Bloom's "reversed alphabetic boustrophedonic punctated quadrilinear cryptogram" can be deciphered to spell MARTHA CLIF FORD. DOLPHINS BARN, for example (592). But the postcard bear ing the enigmatic inscription "U. P. : up," which so infuriates Denis Breen that he absurdly tries to sue the unknown sender, is allowed to circulate Dublin without being explained (129-31). The metatextual correspondence between Briony and the Colonel of the Buffs underlines that the novel's verisimilitude, its representa tion of historical presence, is sourced in the archive. An awareness of how historical realism relies on an epistemic residuum suggests the novel's scepticism about logocentrism. However, this does not seem to be imported into its rendering of the modernist novel, which had hit the rocks of what Conrad called "the old, old words, worn thin, defaced by ages of careless usage" (132). Saussure published the Course in General Linguistics in the same year that Stephen Dedalus mused that "Suck was a queer word" (Joyce, Portrait 8). Briony's wonder at the combinatory potential of another four-letter word points to how, more generally, Atonement refrains from considering how the used language of novelistic effects may be reinvigorated.</page><page sequence="19">Robinson 491 McEwan's novel does not allow its own smooth linguistic surfaces to be roiled by what Roland Barthes calls the "sumptuous rank of the signifier" (65), and thus implicitly resists being drawn toward a formally radical poetics. Subordinated Modernism Atonement is not a modernist nor a neomodernist novel. For a text so clearly designed to raise the ghosts of the English canon, and one that negotiates between the literary taxonomies of twentieth-cen tury theory, this obvious point should be emphasized. Peter Childs's summary is accurate but problematic: Atonement "places itself in a realist tradition of deep, rich characterization and social breadth, but displays a modernist concern with consciousness and perspective. Ultimately though it emerges as at least in part a postmodernist novel, because it questions its own fictive status, exposing itself as a con struct; yet, it also stretches beyond this by foregrounding questions of morality that belong to a pre-postmodern humanism" (143). That Atonement can gather together these "isms" seems to be its strength : it is James's loose baggy monster for our age. While Kermode can praise the novel for encouraging a consistent suspension of belief (9), John Mullan rather enjoys succumbing to its illusion (32). Per haps these positions are not oppositional, but the all-encompassing, mutually inclusive model begins to look unsatisfactory—as if the novel were an overflowing cistern. Head writes that in Atonement the "Mandarin style is combined with the vernacular, the crystalline with the journalistic [a reference to Iris Murdoch's "Against Dryness"], to provide a synthesis that is peculiarly rich" (160). It is rich, but it is peculiar, too, because the novel attempts, and must know it will fail, to mediate between incompatible aesthetic theories—thus, the "hedged" uncertainty about literature that Head rightly identifies in this most literary of novels, and which ultimately makes Atonement an important work, looking backward over the twentieth century as it is propelled forward. Cormack argues that McEwan's novel does not allow a postmod ernist interpénétration of real and fictive: "there is the world of the real and the word of literature, and woe betide those who confuse the two" (82). We can begin to empty the cistern of postmodernism, then, and it is worth doing the same for modernism. Or at least we can remodel our sense of Atonement democratically containing com peting poetics and underline that modernism is subordinated (rather than dominant) in the text. The novel is not quite such a benignly loose monster as its popular and critical success would have us believe. Returning to re</page><page sequence="20">492 Ian McEwan's Atonement worked modernist intertexts reveals that passing through modernism leaves behind some scorched earth. In ignoring European arguments about the politics of modernist form that were going on in the 1930s (between Brecht, Lukacs, Benjamin, and Bloch), Atonement cer tainly avoids anachronism, but the modernism that it consequently constructs is a straw figure: ethically neutered, disengaged from history, lacking in pragmatic morality. If this is the charge against modernism, we should add that all literature is, to some extent, guilty of it—including the realist novel. That indeed is one of the strongest impressions that the consoling uncertainty of Atonement leaves us with, even as it tussles with its canonical forbears. Notes 1. Woolf reciprocated: "that smarty-boots Connolly" (qtd. in Collini 18). 2. "The Window" section of To the Lighthouse, with its concluding din ner, correlates to the first section of Atonement, as Peter Kemp has observed (qtd. in Finney 72); in both novels, too, the return to the house after war is a kind of mending, or putting right, though it is shadowed by irrevocable loss (L. Marcus 92). The migraine-suffering Emily Tallis, confined to her bed, suppos edly has a "sixth sense, a tentacular awareness" (Atonement 66) of what is happening within the country house. This is reminiscent of Clarissa Dalloway in her house—for example, when she pauses on the landing and reflects on how she knows "the very temper of her house" (Woolf, Dalloway 48-9) by hearing the faint sounds—the swish of the mop, the chink of silver on a tray—which rise in spirals up the well of the stairs. (I am grateful to Dr. Alistair Cormack for alert ing me to this passage.) This representation of a bustling, serviced house develops into a kind of mystical sense of nature recapturing the empty house in the "Time Passes" section of To the Lighthouse. McEwan places Emily in her bedroom to add this Edwardian, Woolfian temper to the clandestine Gothic spaces and muffled thumps of the Tallis country house, which are derived from Northanger Abbey and even Agatha Christie. 3. Woolf never seems able to avoid parties, dinners, or dinner parties: even in The Waves, Percival's farewell dinner is an important cen terpiece. 4. The influence on Atonement of Elizabeth Bowen's fiction has been mentioned by Lee, who notes the correspondence with The Heat of the Day ("Memories" 16). Detailed study of other modernist intertexts, such as those by Bowen, would certainly be worthwhile: I have not been able to do so here for want of space.</page><page sequence="21">Robinson 493 5. F.R. Leavis felt that Marius Bewley's sense of "moral horror" in What Maisie Knew was too emphatic, preferring the term "moral squalor" (qtd. in Jefferson xxvi). 6. In rejoining the poetics of modernist perspectivism to a treatment of upper-middle class corruption, McEwan calls not only on James but also on James's legacy to modernism. Ford Madox Ford's The Good Soldier, for example, is also a virtuoso narrative exercise that allies limited-naive point of view to the subject of specious marriage and its casualties. Ford's Nancy, not an "ironic centre" like James's Maisie, is nonetheless the child of bitterly separated parents who finds a home with foster parents themselves enduringly unfaithful to each other. Nancy is reduced to a catatonic stupor in which she can only repeatedly murmur "shuttlecocks": James had explained how Maisie's story was suggested by hearing about "a wretched infant [who] was thus to find itself practically disowned, rebounding from racquet to racquet like a tennis-ball or a shuttle cock" (Maisie 1; emphasis added). 7. In James's short story "The Figure in the Carpet," for example, the narrator, suspect and selfish though he may be, is still an everyman reader whose "deeper darkness" (Mathews 148) represents a per petual critical frustration—a negative capability—to which even the best of readers must be condemned.
