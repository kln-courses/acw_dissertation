<plain_text><page sequence="1">essential criteria definitive of shamanism, and Laughlin further points out that Euro-American so- cieties give credence only to experiences during normal waking phases of consciousness. Euro- Americans live in a relatively monophasic culture, while shamans operate in polyphasic cultures. For Pandian and Guthrie, gods and spirits are not to be dismissed, normalized, or seen as the inevita- ble effects of states of consciousness but are to be treated existentially as images that strengthen hu- man identity and understanding. Guthrie argues that these transcendent beings are almost always anthropomorphic because that is the way they originated. Early humans personified cosmic forces, much as chimpanzees can be seen to issue threats against thunderstorms that disturb them. The body and the human social world serve as obvious source domains for representing the unknown. Guthrie does not contend that this originary logic still governs our approach to transcendent beings. Indeed, he cautions against conflating origin and utility. Ideas about anthropomorphic transcendent beings may or may not be useful today, but they arose early and simply have not, as yet, been dis- lodged. Pandian views gods and spirits as "sacred others" (p. 506); priests communicate with them while shamans commune with them. These powers enable the formulation of coherent human selves at a cultural, semiotic level; they are not reducible to psychology. I hope that the above outline indicates the rich pickings to be found in this collection. The only weakness of the volume is that little effort was put into compiling a rigorous index, which would have enabled scholars to cross-reference key concepts and ideas. In all other respects this book is well con- ceived. There is wisdom in the diversity assembled here.

Oslo: Scandinavian Univer- sity Press, 1996. viii + 244 pp., notes, refer- ences, contributors. RITTY A. LUKOSE University of Chicago Historians of Europe have pointed to the histori- cal specificity of conceptions of childhood. In the medieval era, the child was considered a miniature adult, hardly distinguishable in dress and activity from adult counterparts. Between the 15th and 18th centuries, with bourgeois notions of family and in- dividuality and with the separation of public and private, the modern conception of childhood emerged as a separate domain: a space of inno- cence and play radically different from the corrupt world of adults. This bourgeois ideal gradually per- meated society and moved beyond Europe through the medical, legal, and educational institutions of colonialism. In the United States we are witnessing a new moral panic about childhood, its "loss" and "end," as narratives of child abuse, violence by children, and the commodification of children's ac- tivities and bodies intensify. If the early modern pe- riod asserted a certainty about children as emphati- cally not adults, today the lines between childhood and adulthood are increasingly blurred. In her comprehensive introduction Gullestad situates Imagined Childhoods within this historical framework. This conference volume is generated from a renewed, interdisciplinary, and critical focus on constructions of childhood, sponsored by the Norwegian Centre for Child Research. The volume begins with the observation that all discourses of childhood are adult retrospective visions. Child- hoods are imagined and narrated; they are crucial, furthermore, for the production of "modern selves." The contributors to the volume examine the form and content of imagined childhoods through auto- biographies and elicited life stories. Thus the vol- ume is also an attempt to "redefine texts in relation to experiences, lives, and contexts without reduc- ing the texts to mere reflections of prior realities" (p. 14). While this interdisciplinary textual focus of the volume is generally engaging, it leads to some the- matic unevenness. Most of the contributors examine autobiographies, but some are more successful than others at linking the literary and the social. Olney examines the "writer's childhoods" of Richard Wright, Mary Mc- Carthy, Maxine Hong Kingston, and Wole Soyinka that thematize the discovery of the power of story- telling and the production of the authorial "I." Elbaz examines the postcolonial condition through the autobiographies of Elias Canetti, Albert Memmi, and Katia Rubinstein. These narratives of childhood situate the emergence of the young writer or poet in the interface between the colonized and the colo- nizer. This interface makes impossible the retrieval of any authentic "origin"; it is this that becomes the condition of possibility of the postcolonial text. Fabre and Koester also examine autobiographies but link them more directly to social and historical processes outside the text itself. Fabre examines 19th-century French narratives of "rustic childhoods" in the autobiographical writings of Lamartine, Chateaubriand, and Victor Hugo, among others. He deftly links their obsession with birds (bird catching, searching for birds' nests) not only to the production of a young masculinity intent on mas- tery over nature but also to the association of social change through schooling and literacy in 19th-cen- tury rural France. In an engaging essay Koester ex- amines the relationship between imagined child- hoods and imagined nations in Iceland. While examining specific autobiographies, he links them to a generalized practice of "life-historical writing" (p. 137) that he sees as a ubiquitous social practice, appearing in newspapers, weeklies, obituaries, and popular memorials. This writing forms a narrative of the nation as literacy, and the literary conventions of storytelling become part of the Icelandic national imaginary. Koester goes on to examine how inti- mate childhood memories are narrativized through the tropes of the Icelandic nation: farm life, the Ice- landic landscape, and images of motherly women in national dress. Most interesting, these narratives often include memories of reading to the family in the evening, which the Iceland independence reviews 513</page><page sequence="2">movement elaborated as "national" activity. Here, reading is not just a technology for imagining the nation (in Anderson's sense) but also an objectified national pastime. Frank and Mikaelsson examine autobiographies of "ordinary" people in order to examine the links between their textual and lived lives. Frank exam- ines the autobiography of Diane DeVries, a se- verely disabled woman living in the United States, who uses her narrative control of her text and her account of her birth and infancy in order to assert a dynamic sense of self and a life that she lives. Mi- kaelsson examines the autobiographies of Norwe- gian missionaries to demonstrate how their notions of childhood as preparation and unfolding relate to their missionizing. Burgos elicits life stories from male beekeepers in rural France: men on the "mar- gins of modernity" (p. 29). She examines them for their lack of attention to childhood, something she attributes to the association of childhood with the female realm. Finally, psychologist Heinritz and anthropologist Behar explore the division between childhood and adulthood. Through the autobiography of German writer Isolde Kurz, Heinritz rejects the notion that one can retrieve the "child's point of view." Behar, a Cuban immigrant to the United States, produces an autobiographical account of a childhood trauma in order to call for a new type of autobiographical writing that helps the "woman" and the "girl" claim each other. She argues against an overly dichoto- mous view and sees possibilities in the fact that childhood is remembered as much as forgotten. The volume is premised on a crucial insight: modern childhoods are narrated in significant ways. One of the most objectified, contemporary narra- tive forms for this is the autobiography. Yet the vol- ume suffers from this emphasis on autobiographies. As Gullestad herself states, developments in literary analysis and social science have broadened the scope of the textual to include a wide range of dis- cursive terrains, including scientific and bureau- cratic texts (pp. 13-14). In this vein she advocates a loose definition of the autobiographical so as to in- clude elicited oral life stories. Gullestad claims that the theme of loss of childhoods in autobiographical texts is related to contemporary proliferations of dis- courses of the "loss" and the "end of childhood" which some scholars link to new shifts in global and "disorganized capitalism" (p. 8). But how are we to separate 19th-century romantic autobio- graphical discourses of loss of innocence from late- 20th-century moral panics about the "end of child- hood"? The volume would have benefited from more sustained readings of nonliterary narratives of childhood examined within a variety of historical and social locations and discourses. Gullestad her- self points to the complex examples of "recovered childhood memory" in contemporary therapeutic discourses of sexual abuse. Further, such variety might have helped to specify autobiography itself, both historically and socially. Wole Soyinka states, "Of course the past exists, [but] it is vitally depend- ent on the sensibility that recalls it" (p. 57). The autobiographical sensibility has its own history and partakes of the same bourgeois worldview as mod- ern conceptions of childhood. In this way, a further historicizing of Gullestad's general discussion of "modern selves" might be possible. Despite these limitations, this book is an exciting addition to an emergent body of literature critically examining conceptions of childhood, youth, and generation. Anyone interested in childhood, mo- dernity, schooling, nationalism, gender, life histo- ries, and the social construction of memory will find this book useful and insightful. Consumption and Everyday Life. HUGH MACKAY, ed. London: Sage, 1997. 368 pp., references, figures, tables, index. LAYLA AL-ZUBAIDA Indiana University This volume, intended as a textbook for a cultural studies course at the Open University, is focused upon the complexity of consuming practices that are embedded in the context of everyday life. The contributors cover a broad range of cultural con- sumption patterns drawing on material culture, ideas, and images from various settings and using case studies to counter both the traditional images of passive, powerless consumers and the postmod- ern tendency to glorify consumption as creative art. They thereby shed light on the varying balance be- tween constraint and agency and on the role of consumption within the larger cultural cycle of pro- duction, regulation, representation, and identity. In his introduction the editor explains the term cul- tural consumption, reviews significant theoretical approaches, and connects the collected essays with the goal of moving the study of consumption away from the margins of the social sciences. In the first chapter Daniel Miller elucidates the concept of appropriation, using examples from his fieldwork in Trinidad. He traces anthropological approaches to material culture and problematizes the distinction between "gift societies" and "com- modity societies," in which modern consumption is assigned a central role in the decline of true com- munity and the rise of commoditized relationships. With examples from shoppers in London (an obvi- ously modern setting), he attempts to free the de- bate from moral evaluations and to acknowledge that current consumer practices are truly social be- havior. Ruth Finnegan contributes two chapters. In the first she rejects the notion that cultures produce co- herent types of identity, arguing instead that people "story their selves" (p. 69) in multiple ways through the consumption of conventional "scripts." Her sec- ond essay, on music and performance, is less clearly related to consumption and is more con- cerned with the working of modern community life though collective activities. She does, however, open up the issue of how to define cultural con- sumption in opposition to a narrow economic defi- nition and how to draw boundaries with other cul- tural activities. In his essay, Nigel Thrift links consumption prac- tices to their location in space. New forms of public life raise the question of what is meant by the con- cept of home and the spatial dimension of local 514 american ethnologist</page></plain_text>
