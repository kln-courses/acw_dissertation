<plain_text><page sequence="1">MONOPOLAR THEISM AND THE ONTOLOGICAL ARGUMENT H. D. McDONALD LONDON BIBLE COLLEGE LONDON, ENGLAND MONOPOLAR and dipolar are terms brought but comparatively recently into vogue in theological discussions by Charles Harts- horne, the American philosopher.' The distinction intended by the two concepts has been made the basis for contrasting views of theism consequent upon man's rational reflection upon the divine Object in whom he finds satisfaction for his more funda- mental emotional and practical needs and his primary worship of Him. According to certain modern philosophers of religion man has rightly interpreted the idea of God suggested by this satisfac- tion and this worship in theistic terms.2 The issue, however, concerns the correct statement of this implied theism. According to Hartshorne, historical theism has been altogether conditioned by Greek philosophy, and has become, as a result, definable exclusively according to its concepts. Classical theism, as it is called, has therefore its origin in the notions of Plato and Aristotle rather than in the Hebrew and Christian scriptures. "Not the Gospels and the Old Testament," declares Hartshorne, "but Greek philosophy was the decisive source for the Classical idea of divine perfection." " Central to the idea of classical theism is the conception of God as a Necessary Being, the First Cause of all existences, Himself a pure actuality, simple and impassible - "without body, parts, and passions." This, without doubt, was the understanding of 1 Charles Hartshorne and William L. Reese (ed.), Philosophers Speak of God: Readings in Philosophical Theology and Analyses of Theistic Ideas (1953); cf. also, Schubert M.

For whatever their differ- ences in other respects they were at one in their rational account of deity. True, Aristotle criticised his mentor, but in spite of their divergent emphases which may, according to Augustine, "strike careless readers" they were in substantial accord on most things. Having expended much time and discussion they de- veloped, says Augustine "one method of most true philosophy." * Plato was more of an artist, a poet, than was Aristotle, but run- ning through all he has to say is the notion of God as absolute being upon whom all else depends. All ideas of perfection, good, just and holy here coalesce to become stamped with the name of absolute being.5 This is the view which Aristotle presents in terms more coldly prosaic and intellectualistic. "The highest philosophy and theology," declares Aristotle, "deals with the being that is eternal, immutable, transcendent." " God is to be de- scribed as eternal, perfect and living.' It is plain, Aristotle states, that there must be some one and eternal being which is the orig- inator of all movement.8 Classical theism, whether under the influence of Plato as was that of the Church Fathers, or under that of Aristotle as was that of the Scholastics, presented God as actus purus. Of the latter, Aquinas became the chief spokesman. Beginning with the idea of God as Pure Abstract Being, Aquinas maintained that all other attributes could be deduced with logical consistence from this single actuality or subsistence. In the Summa Theologica this monopolar idea is given its most rigorous form. The whole sec- tion from Q.3. Art.i to Q.II. Art.4. is designed to prove that as Self-subsistent Being, God is without body, without imperfection, without limit, without mutability, without temporality, without parts. Classical theism, to be sure, has made use of the biblical text of Exodus 3:14 to support the idea of God as Self-subsistent Being.9 Call however has been made on this passage only by Contra Acad., iii, c. 19, 42.

It is not very certain that the Hebrew verb can be made to yield the conception of God as Self-existent Being. Who can doubt, we are asked by our critics of classical theism, that Greek philosophy presided over early interpretations of the text? Instead therefore of ontology, what theologians need to concern themselves with is hayathology or hayathontology by paying attention to the possible meanings of the Hebrew verb in question. After two thousand years of ontol- ogy it is high time, we are told, to experiment with hayathology.10 The basic principle of classical theism, Hartshorne urges, is its easy contentment with one side of fundamental ultimate polar- ities, the side, that is, which contrasts the absolute with the rela- tive, the necessary with the contingent, and the like. God in the monopolar account is, then, solely actual and wholly non-relative. Hartshorne maintains that this form of absolutist theism suffers from over-simplification although we are reminded by A. N. Whitehead that we are to seek simplicity - and mistrust it! Certainly monopolarism avoids the complexities which the predi- cation of contrasting categories must necessarily occasion. In contradistinction with the dipolar or surrelativist understanding of theism, the monopolar brand is much "simpler." From the point of view of a general understanding monopolarism is suffi- cient of itself to give the term God a meaningful characteriza- tion." To speak of God as the Necessary and Eternal Being is to give a sufficient designation of Him. It is, after all, only God who is strictly necessary and strictly eternal. Furthermore, the absolutist polarities appear to have a more immediate relation to man's practical and emotional needs. From the beginning man has shown preference for the stable over the novel, cause over effect, the active over the passive, and such like. He has con- sequently been predisposed to give account of God solely in terms of these preferences. According to the Platonist and Aristotelian traditions, change, by implying a previous and subsequent, is a defect. To admit change into our conception of God would therefore deny His per- 10 Cf.

Philosophers Speak of God, 76f.</page><page sequence="4">390 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW fection.12 All such ideas which belong to the supposed defective side of the polar disjunction are summarily ruled out as having no place in a true definition of theism. Monopolar theism specifies God generally in negative terms of exclusion. God is Being (not becoming); Absolute (not relative); Necessary (not contingent); and so on. Classical theism does, of course, admit as genuine realities those entities which form the other side of the polarities; for example, the 'many' -in addition to the One; 'matter' -in opposition to Spirit; 'potentiality' as distinct from Actuality. But these are nevertheless regarded as somehow secondary forms of existence 'outside' God. They are in no case and in no sense constitutive of His reality and cannot therefore be made an element in our understanding of Him. It has been from its standpoint of monopolarity that classical theism has criticised pantheism. Pantheism has been condemned because of its denial of these realities as existents extra to God. But pantheism, too, has been no less influenced by historic mono- polarism. It takes its start from a denial of those categorical contrasts, plurality, becoming, relativity and so on, as entering into the being of God. The only alternative left open to pantheism is to assert that they are illusory. Thus while classical theism sees the totally real as God plus these extra entities, pantheism, still committed to the monopolar viewpoint, takes the disap- proved inferior polarities to be unrealities. Hartshorne is of the opinion that the monopolar theist's criti- cism of pantheism forces into view a false dilemma. It is based on the assumption that the highest form of reality is to be indi- cated by singling out and purifying one pole of the ultimate contrasts as "superior" to the other. Hartshorne cannot see that this favouritism is justified. Experience, he submits, does not give colour to the implied essential inferiority of these theologi- cally despised contraries. Persons without variety or complexity are as deficient on the one side as those without unity are on the other. For if the variety overbalances, we have chaos or discord; if the unity, we have monotony or triviality. Some persons exhibit the defect of "passivity." They are over susceptible to the in- "2 "An underlying reason for conceiving deity in monopolar terms was the belief that changelessness is implied in the very conception of a 'necessary' being." ibid., 71.</page><page sequence="5">MONOPOLAR THEISM 391 fluences of others. Others show an unbalance on the side of "inflexibility" and are unresponsive and insensitive. But can there not be a good or superior complexity and passivity as well as a good unity and activity? If there can be a superior in the one direction can there not be also in the other? It would appear that the monopolar contrasts of excellent-inferior is an invidious one. The truth seems rather to be that the judgement "excellent- inferior" enters into both opposites of the polarities. There is a good activity and passivity, as well as a bad; a good cause and effect as there are inferior ones. The outcome of the monopolarity of classical theism is its presentation of God as a mere uncharacterizable Being and impas- sive First Cause. It is thus open to the charge of being virtually an ontolatry and an etiolatry. The cure for this false worship, we are told, is to admit into our conception of God the realities which constitute the other side of the polarities (in their supra- eminent sense, of course), and as a result to give to our under- standing of God an enriched content. This means, quite simply, according to the recommendation, that instead of the "monopolar" view of classical theism we substitute the "dipolar" view of neo- classicalism. The programme suggested by the neoclassical theists is first of all a correction of the defects of the monopolar account of God. It is the contention of Hartshorne that the theistic question is not simply one question among others. It is, on the fundamental level, and when all its implications are taken into account, the sole question.'3 It is indeed a characteristic of Hartshorne in these essays on neoclassical metaphysics as well as elsewhere to insist that the theistic issue is entirely of a piece with that of metaphysics generally."4 Classical metaphysics, he declares, has been altogether concerned with the idea of being, substance, ab- soluteness, and necessity as primary conceptions. Neoclassical metaphysics, by contrast, regards these as secondary conceptions, the primary ones being those of creative becoming, event, rela- tivity, and possibility. In order to secure its end neoclassical theism seeks to square 1 Cf. The Logic of Perfection, 131; cf. also, Philosophers Speak of God, 7. 14Cf. Schubert M. Ogden, "Theology and Philosophy: A New Phase of the Discussion," Journal of Religion 44 (1964), 4.</page><page sequence="6">392 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW its idea of God with the so-called Law of Polarity. This law states that ultimate contraries are not final irreconcilable dis- junctions. In the nature of the case nothing real can be described by any number of one-sided predications. The real is a complex of opposites: or, more truly stated, these ultimate contraries are correlatives. Thus neoclassical theism 'as an Integral Philosophy' sees God as only rightly definable when He is credited with pos- sessing all polar contraries in their perfection. He is, that is to say, to be regarded as being at the same time both actual and potential, both cause and effect, both being and becoming."5 It is not suggested, however, that by this predication of oppo- sites the law of contradiction is nullified in relation to God. For while He is to be conceived as holding in Himself at the same time the two sides of any one set of polarities, He does not, so to speak, hold them in the same way. Hartshorne posits what he calls two main aspects in the essence of the supreme being."6 In one aspect, or, perhaps we may say, in one relationship, namely, to Himself, He is one thing; in another relationship, namely, to the world as somehow included in Him, He is another thing. In this way Hartshorne can speak of the necessary essence and con- tingent qualities of God."7 Hartshorne amplifies his position in a criticism of John Wis- dom's famous article on "Gods," where he contrasts the two views of the logic of theism. Classical theism has been bogged down with discussions about being and necessity; for neoclassical theism, on the other hand, "God" is a term taken from 'ordinary piety.' To believers in God not conditioned by Greek thought or its classical theistic refurbi- shing in historic Christian theology, God is not conceived to be a static impassible being. He makes Himself aware to, and is made aware by, ordinary piety as having two aspects: an abstract eternal nature, which is strictly necessary, and a total concrete de facto actuality, containing both the eternal nature and suc- cessive accidental qualities. Hartshorne illustrates his contention 5 Cf. Hartshorne's position with the teaching of Nicholas of Cusa (1401-1464) on the "coincidence of opposites." See his De docta ignorantia; H. Bett, Nicholas of Cusa (I932), Part III, ch. ii. 16 Cf. Philosophers Speak of God, 4. 17 Cf.

The statement "God is all-knowing" and the statement "God knows that Analysis, as actually practised, is inadequate" can both be rightly declared of God. But not in the same way. They represent two logically different classes of statement; and the referent "God" cannot be said to be identical in the two cases. The first statement is a necessary one for it belongs to God to be all-knowing. The second can only refer to God as possessing a certain contingent element, for, had there been no such thing as "Analysis," God could have not known it as actually practised.18 To be rightly conceived, therefore, according to the deliver- ances of ordinary piety and actual faith, without the conditioning influence of classical monopolarism, God is to be understood in a dipolar manner. He is not one thing to the exclusion of its contrary: He is both in a different fashion and for a different purpose. Hartshorne seeks to make clear how this is possible by taking various sets of polarities and endeavouring to show how they both belong properly to God. He sees, for example, essence and accidents, necessity and becoming, impassibility and passibil- ity as entering into the same Reality called "God." To suggest that these polarities should both be possessed by God is, at once, to bring out the contrast between classical and neoclassical theism. It was one of the first principles of scholastic doctrine that there is nothing accidental, becoming or passible about God. But Hartshorne will have none of it. To have accidents, he con- tends, is a requisite of what constitutes a person being a person. Since God is Person, He will, like other persons, have a distinctive individual essence, but He will have accidents as well; so that what is "in Him" need not be thought of as being in His essence. To have accidents of some sort is a fact about God by virtue of the poles of contingency, relativity, and passivity. These "acci- dents" are, of course, strictly outside His essence, for by defini- tion essence means the individual in abstraction from all in him that is accidental. By the omission of the accidental the individual would still be "himself," but without the accidental he would not be able to be characterised as that specific individual."9 8 Ibid., 149; cf. 37- 'e Philosophers Speak of God, 4.</page><page sequence="8">394 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW Hartshorne takes special glory in stressing sufferability as a necessary ingredient of the dipolar conception of God. "The neo- classical idea of perfection," he says, "entails a sheer absence of suffering neither in God nor in the world." 20 It is for this reason he finds himself able to write with a certain enthusiasm about the "tragic pantheism" of Robinson Jeffers. He commends him for his full recognition that pain and conflict are in God.21 It is Jeffers' view that God undergoes our suffering; and since all is His doing, His torture is self-inflicted. But Hartshorne cannot commend him fully, for the grand poet turns out to be in the end a typical pantheist by his denial of freedom, and assertion of strict determinism; and also because of his denial that the In- clusive One can be related to the included individuals. In Hartshorne's view, then, "classical pantheism" no less than "classical theism" has failed to do justice to the dipolar require- ment, though perhaps in a less emphatic way. We thus find him condemning another classical pantheist as a virtual monopolarist for thinking that change, conflict, suffering, passivity, diversity, are unworthy to characterize the Highest Lord.22 Hartshorne cannot think it possible that God can be without pathos. He must reject therefore von Hiigel's studied repudiation of patripassianism.23 von Hiigel argues for a divine sympathy that does not suffer and that God is too much our Friend for us not to rejoice that He does not suffer. Hartshorne cannot see how a God who has such sympathy can be without any suffering. He prefers to think that sympathetic suffering is the highest form of personality; and most of all in God. He alone must surely be the most adequate instance of vicarious suffering. Can God be indeed our Friend and not suffer? and could an impassible deity be one in whom we could rejoice? Hartshorne does not think so. The world is surely not abstractable from its sufferings, and God does not abstract Himself from it. If God accepts relation to His creatures He accepts relationship in the world's suffering.24 2 The Logic of Perfection, 44.

But, alas, Royce's position is virtually that of classical pantheism. On dipolar premises suffering is a category, and it must therefore be main- tained not only that God contains suffering but that it is in His character to suffer, in accordance with the suffering of the world. The Christian idea of the Cross, together with the doctrine of the Incarnation, achieves, Hartshorne contends, technical metaphys- ical expressions of the idea of a suffering deity.25 It is out of this belief in God that Hartshorne expresses his especial affinity with Berdyaev. "Here at last," he applauds, "is an out-and-out dipolar theology." Berdyaev speaks frankly of "a divine history, a divine becoming, a divine need, and above all, divine suffering." 26 Few theologians have read suffering and tragedy into the being of God as daringly as has this theologian of the Eastern Orthodox Church. There is no self-sufficient, stony immobility in Ber- dyaev's conception of God. "Christianity reveals tragedy in the Divine life itself," says Berdyaev without any patripassianist in- hibitions. "God Himself, the Only Begotten Son, suffers and is crucified, an innocent sufferer." 27 This, and the like character- istics of Berdyaev's teaching, Hartshorne finds congenial. In his opinion the old heresy of a suffering deity is no heresy at all.28 Dipolarity is, then, according to Hartshorne the only possible way rightly to speak of God. It is the denial of relations to God which is the gigantic paradox.29 It is the dipolar synthesis which renders irrelevant Kant's wholly nontemporal and coldly moral view of God. Only the dipolar form of theism is adequate to meet the dilemma offered by Hume. He contrasts monopolar views of theism and sets out the disjunction: either mysticism with its purely negative conception of deity or anthropomorphism with its affirmation of a positive but wholly imperfect, contingent, ' Philosophers Speak of God, 15; cf. 20. 2 Ibid., 285f. 2 Berdyaev, op cit., 41. ~ Cf.

Only by crediting to God the supreme forms of both contraries can we achieve the highest synthesis which takes effectively into account the motifs offered by the theistic-pantheistic and the mystic-anthropomorphic di- lemma.30 Classical theism has come under fire from Hartshorne because it permits the existence of other existents outside God. Hartshorne cannot admit such a possibility. This is the burden of his essay entitled The Wider Context: Theism as an Integral Philosophy. God if anywhere, he maintains, must be everywhere; nothing must be the mere opposite of God. If indeed the last particle were allowed to be "wholly other" than God, then "God" would be nonsense.31 Hartshorne draws attention to the New Testament command that we are to love God with all our mind, heart, soul and strength - with 'One hundred per cent of our interest' that is. And yet we are to love ourselves and our fellows. But does not this involve a downright contradiction? It does of course, Hartshorne contends, save on the assumption that there is nothing outside or additional to God.32 The apparent objection to this all-inclusiveness, he is well aware, is the presence of evil in the world. Beginning with the principle that perfection is coincidence of reality with an all- valuing process of experience, he is prepared to allow that all evil is experienced by the Perfect. But evils are however always contingent and must therefore be related to the contingent aspect of God. Hartshorne refers to the ancient argument; why has not God as good and powerful put together the world so smoothly, and made and contrived it in such a way that every evil is pre- vented and the totality moves unerringly towards a wholly desir- able outcome? Here he stresses, once again, the dynamic nature of reality which he learned from A. N. Whitehead. The world is not a set of things, vessels of clay moulded by the divine potter, so Cf. Philosophers Speak of God, 5, 434; cf. also, Charles Hartshorne, "The Structure of Givenness," The Philosophical Forum 18 (I96o-61), 34: "God as the sole fully conscious being will always and without qualification contain each item of reality which he experiences or knows as but a constituent of his total reality." g' The Logic of Perfection, 126. ' Ibid., 40.</page><page sequence="11">MONOPOLAR THEISM 397 and each arranged on its appropriate shelf. All that exists exists in relation. And more particularly do individuals exist as active within community.33 Indeed the very idea of God involves that of relationship. A worshipped God is He who has created. He is therefore One not merely able to be Father but one who is, since qualified by this very relationship.34 Because God is love and because love is an inter-personal relationship, it seems, on the face of it, reasonable to identify "divine" with some eminent meaning of "relative" rather than any meaning of "absolute." 35 God-in-relationship cannot act in an arbitrary, hard-and-fast manner. And furthermore since dipolarity is accepted, chance as well as determinism must find their coalescence in God. 'Without the recognition of chance, no teleology!' declares Hartshorne.3" In the fact of relationship and the reality of chance must then be found the answer to the existence of what is termed evil. But, while according to the dipolar thesis all ultimate contrasts do fall within God, it is to be emphasised that they do so each in its own order. Good and evil as polar contrasts are to be thought of as coming within the all-inclusive reality, God. Since, how- ever, evil in the sense of wickedness is not, Hartshorne thinks, a universal category (animals, e.g., because of their unconscious- ness of principles are incapable of it), it is not of the nature of an ultimate contrast. It is only really ultimate contrasts which can be used to describe the fixed character of God. In this sense God is free from the charge of wickedness. But since God's total reality is more than His mere character or essential individuality, the wickedness of man as a contrast with the goodness of God must fall within God but not in such a fashion that He may be called wicked. With "evil" in the form of suffering we have seen it is otherwise. Suffering is to be regarded as contained within the very character of God. Hartshorne would not have it be concluded, however, that because of his emphasis upon the all-inclusiveness of God he falls a victim of the pantheism which he has on so many occasions pro- fessed to reject. He was clearly aware of how easily the idea of SIbid., 313. , Cf. The Logic of Perfection, 270. SIbid., 268. * Ibid., 214.</page><page sequence="12">398 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW an intimate coincidence between God and the world might call forth the charge that he was himself the pantheist par excellence. He forestalls any such imputation, however, by first of all re- minding his readers with a remark of Tillich's, that even the term "pantheism" needs to be defined before being used polemically. When accurately defined it will appear, he is convinced, to be no fitting designation of his own position. 'When defined, it will either not agree with the neoclassical idea, or it will be religious.' 37 The religious meaning which agrees with his own position is that more properly suggested by the term "panentheism." s The notion "panentheism" is sufficient, he endeavours to demonstrate, to meet the demands which his conception of God's all-inclusive- ness requires. Hartshorne is of the opinion that early expressions of God are almost necessarily dipolar and panentheistic.39 And he suggests that the weakness in Descartes was his failure to perceive that panentheistic concepts fitted better the Cartesian situation than classical ones which alone he considered. In chapter vii of Philosophers Speak of God, Hartshorne gives a resume of a number of philosophers who, in his estimation, carried through panentheistic principles with more or less con- sistency. While Hartshorne finds himself at odds with them on particular details, he is unsparing in his praise of them on the essential dipolar insights which were theirs. Most of them, he regrets, cannot resist the fascination of bits of traditional mono- polar rhetoric, and on that score they must be reprimanded. But there are a few - three, perhaps, Fechner, Whitehead and Berdyaev - who are far less than the others tainted by traditional monopolar concepts. For Hartshorne, the greatest of these three, certainly from the theological point of view, would seem to be Berdyaev. This last observation commits us to make the point that Harts- horne did not regard himself without precursors in presenting the ideas of dipolar theism as the more adequate account of man's fundamental religious attitudes and worship. We have seen how 7 The Logic of Perfection, 42. 8 Ibid.; cf. Ch. Hartshorne, art. "Panentheism," Encyclopedia of Religion, ed. V. Ferm (1945). 8 Cf. Philosophers Speak of God, 32.</page><page sequence="13">MONOPOLAR THEISM 399 he brings together the names of Whitehead and Berdyaev,40 and it is to these two that he would appear to be most heavily indebted for his fundamental metaphysical and theological ideas. To a lesser extent, perhaps, can the influence of Schelling and Fechner be traced. He regards Schelling as having gone perhaps furthest, prior to Fechner, towards an adequate surrelativism.41 Fechner is heartily commended for the clarity of his fundamental dipolar- ity, although his pioneering work, otherwise marvellously fresh and courageous, does not escape the deadening influence of tradi- tion.42 To Whitehead it may be said Hartshorne turns for inspiration for the metaphysical aspect of his work, as he does to Berdyaev for the significantly theological element. Thus while Berdyaev represents for Hartshorne one of the few genuine dipolar theolo- gians, Whitehead is hailed as the supreme example that has yet appeared of the complete application of the dipolar contrasts, without partiality or favour, to deity. Here indeed is the out- standing surrelativist or panentheist.43 It is not our intention to trace here the measure of Hartshorne's indebtedness; this would be a study in itself. Suffice it to say here that those acquainted with Whitehead's Process and Reality will see at once how closely akin are some of its fundamental ideas to those of Hartshorne's Reality as Social Process.44 White- head's principles of "creativity," "the many," "oneness" and so on, are the framework of Hartshorne's all-inclusive theism: while his essay on "A World of Organisms" is ultimately not vastly different from one of the fundamental principles of the Whiteheadian metaphysics.45 " See above, n. 28. 1 Philosophers Speak of God, 243. 42 Ibid., 257. 4 Ibid., 273.

More particularly, there is something distinctive in the direction of his neoclassical- ism towards a rehabilitation of the ontological argument. It is from this standpoint that Schubert Ogden is justified in claiming that Hartshorne has initiated a new phase of the discussion be- tween theology and philosophy." The frank fact is, however, as Ogden admits and Hartshorne complains, that his treatment of the metaphysical and theological problem has not yet received the recognition that it merits. Perhaps this time is passing for there seems to be a growing awareness of his work. Maybe a prophet - if prophet he is - is not always honoured in his own time, as well as in his own country. The fundamental reason, however, for this "scandalous neg- lect" as Ogden deems it, can be more readily discerned when it is remembered that Hartshorne's efforts are directed towards a logic of perfection which will give the ontological argument a new acceptability. The plain fact is, of course, that for long Hartshorne has been swimming against the stream. From every quarter during recent years it is the ontological argument which has been most scorned. This is not merely because it is a priori and in a period of rigorous logical empiricism the notion of the a priori has little favour. But even when, as it appears to us the time is here, empiricism is losing ground, and there is an apparent movement back towards the acknowledgment of the possibility of the a priori in metaphysics, those who are willing to make this acknowledgment are to be found looking over their shoulder to see if they have the approval of Kant.47 For did not Kant kill for ever the ontological argument?

Thus when the denial of the ontological proof went beyond mere pious asseveration, which was not as frequent as we would like to think, it was usual, as we see for example in the case of G. E. Moore, to point out as Kant had done, the logical differences between subject-predicate state- ments and statements which differ from these only in the substi- tution of "exists" for the predicate.48 Yet, throughout, this very method of dealing with the onto- logical argument is itself a sort of application of it. Philosophers and theologians have virtually been saying: we have an idea in the mind, communicated to us by Kant, that the ontological proof with its claim that existence in reality is greater than existence in mind, is a fallacy a greater than which cannot be conceived. It must therefore be counted dead. For quite a long time now the appropriate requiem has been sung over its demise. In the judg- ment of a number of writers the dissolution of the argument is complete. C. D. Broad has in fact suggested that it was weakly born and destined (to use his own figure) to be wrecked before it left port.49 While J. N. Findlay thinks it was an ill day for An- selm when he hit upon his famous proof.50 And C. A. Campbell without an apparent show of mourning considers the effectiveness of the argument to be over and done with.51 But there begins to be some evidence that 'the prolonged period of "dogmatic slumber" on this topic may be nearly over.' 52 If this is so, as Hartshorne thinks, then his neoclassical theism will 48 Cf.

Alston has claimed to have 'revis- ited' the ontological argument and has reported finding that what was thought to be Kant's most lethal explosive did not after all hit the target. His bulletin announcing its death was premature. It seems therefore that it has been found alive and not in too bad a state of health. (Or are ghosts real after all?) According to Alston the Kantian weapon was in certain important respects faulty and could never have done what he supposed. He an- nounced that he has himself remedied the defects and has now actually exploded the argument.53 Norman Malcolm however informs us that there is no need to give credence to these reports. For the fact is that Anselm, unknown to himself, gave two distinct proofs. And even if it be granted, which he is not prepared to deny, that the weaker one was killed by Kant, the stronger twin is alive and unscathed."4 Malcolm examines the second of Kant's high-explosives; the contention that "all existential propositions are synthetic" or, as the modern version is, "are contingent," and therefore because their contradictory is logically possible, the existence of God can- not be deduced from the idea of His existence as a necessary being. Malcolm replies that he can show that this is not so. For since logical necessity merely reflects the use of words, the implica- tion that every existential proposition must be contingent does not follow.55 In other words, Malcolm denies that necessary exist- ence is logically inadmissible. It is, however, not our intention to give here a history of the ontological argument in recent writing."5 We are anxious merely to draw attention to Malcolm's contention that there are really 'Cf. The Philosophical Review 69 (1960), 452: "The ontological argument has often been criticised on the grounds that it mistakenly supposes 'exists' to be a predicate. I am going to argue (I) that the way in which this criticism is usually presented is faulty, (2) that these faults result from overlooking certain basic features of the concept of existence, and (3) that when these features are fully taken into account, new and sounder reasons can be given for denying that 'exists' is a predicate and for rejecting the ontological argument."

Hartshorne quite independently it appears, after prolonged study of Anselm's writings, had come to the same conclusion."57 While Malcolm speaks of two different arguments, Hartshorne writes of two forms of the ontological proof. And the proof is, he believes, far more subtle and complex than even Anselm himself believed." Having ourselves given another look at the argument as it appears in the first three chapters of the Proslogion and in the Responsio, there is, it seems to me, a good deal to be said for the claim of Malcolm and Hartshorne. As I see it, there do seem to be two distinguishable statements or forms of the proof. The first we may designate the ontological proof of predicability; the second, the more complex, the ontological argument of conceiv- ability. Put very briefly, and risking as a consequence Harts- horne's condemnation, the first one states that a thing is greater if it exists than if it does not. 'And assuredly that, than which nothing greater can be conceived, cannot exist in the understand- ing alone. For, suppose it exists in the understanding alone: then it can be conceived to exist in reality; which is greater.' Thus since God is something than which a greater cannot be conceived, it is proper to predicate existence of Him. This statement of the argument is, in Malcolm's opinion, fallacious because he admits the cogency of Kant's criticism that existence cannot be a predi- cate. He proposes therefore to leave the matter without further rigorous refutation more or less at the intuitive level at which Kant left it.59 Alston to whom we have made reference above redirected his freshly assembled missile against this form or statement of the proof. The second proof or form is a different kettle of fish. The argu- ment here turns on the conviction that a being whose non- existence cannot be conceived is greater than a being whose non- existence can be conceived. 'For it is possible to conceive of a being which cannot be conceived not to exist; and this is greater than one which can be conceived not to exist.' Put simply this 57 Cf.

The Logic of Perfection, 30. * Op. cit., 44.</page><page sequence="18">404 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW amounts to saying that a thing is greater if it necessarily exists than if it does not necessarily exist. It is this question of "necessary existence," with the allied one of the significance to be given to the concept "perfection" or "perfect being," which has become the major issue in the discus- sion of the ontological argument in recent times. Malcolm, as we have seen, argued that the contemporary dogma that all existential propositions are contingent is in the end a 'language game' and cannot possibly have the implication that every existen- tial proposition must in fact be contingent. And, further, that Kant and the priest Caterus, who made the same objection against Descartes, were mistaken in their contention that to state that "God is a necessary being" or "God necessarily exists" is equiva- lent to a conditional proposition. They would have it read as an "if" - "If God exists," so as to make it understood that it could be possible for God not to exist. Malcolm regards this analysis of the proposition "God necessarily exists" as plainly false. He asks, is not the conjunction "God necessarily exists but it is pos- sible that He does not exist" obviously self-contradictory? It is as absurd as to say that a square has four sides, but it is possible for a square not to have four sides. Therefore, concludes Mal- colm, Kant's (and Caterus's) attempt to destroy the ontological argument by the simple expedient of rejecting the subject is shown to be self-contradictory, because it accepts both of two incompatible propositions. Findlay, on the other hand, draws an opposite conclusion. He premises the familiar contention that it is not possible to build a bridge between mere abstractions and concrete existences.60 He thereupon goes on to build such a bridge between mere abstrac- tions and non-existence. His point is that the ontological argu- ment, if taken seriously, leads to a positive denial of God's ex- istence. The absence of contingency is, he believes, a requisite for a Being worthy of worship. And such a Being must, besides, be unlimited and unescapable. Now, since all existential proposi- tions are contingent, and since God cannot be said to exist "acci- dentally," the so-called ontological proof, based as it is on the assumption of His necessary existence, is nullified. More, in- 6 Op. cit., 47</page><page sequence="19">MONOPOLAR THEISM 405 deed, it entails not only that there isn't a God, but that the Divine Existence is either senseless or impossible.61 It does not belong to our purpose at present to enter upon a critique of Findlay's essay. It is enough to observe that his argument rests upon the monopolar view of God as a necessary being, exclusive of all accidental elements. Hartshorne is quite happy to allow that Findlay's conclusion follows from this classi- cal premise.62 But it is, as we have seen, against the adequacy of such an understanding of God that all his energies are directed. Hartshorne could legitimately have made the point that Findlay has not been consistent in the putting of his case. Had he been true to his own account of God as a Being worthy of man's wor- ship, he would have found himself an exponent of dipolar theism. Findlay says, for example, that the object of religious worship must in some manner be all-comprehensive: that there mustn't be anything capable of existing, or of displaying any virtue, with- out owing all of these absolutely to this single source. He is of course aware of the obscurities and antagonisms which this diffi- cult requirement has occasioned for faith, raising problems which have not been solved or dissipated after centuries of theological brooding.63 But if the all-inclusiveness for which Hartshorne argues, and which Findlay regards as necessary, is taken seri- ously, then maybe theists (and their opponents) would not have been so emphatic that the accidental and contingent have no place in the total definition of God. It is certainly one thing to say that God exists by accident, and quite another that He exists contingently - in the sense, that is, required by the idea of His all-inclusiveness. It is here we have the gist of Hartshorne's counterblast. Given the neoclassical understanding of perfection, there is, he asserts, no escape possible from a theistic conclusion on the strength of the ontological argument. He believes that he has adduced ex- cellent and adequate reasons, both religious and philosophical, for conceiving divine perfection neoclassically as requiring con- tingent states in God. 1 Ibid., 54- " Cf. The Logic of Perfection, 33. * J. N. Findlay, loc. cit.</page><page sequence="20">406 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW Hartshorne details twenty arguments against the ontological proof in its historic formulation which he admits constitute an impressive case. He prides himself that he alone has made such a complete inventory of the serious objections to it. He then sets about showing that their validity is due in large measure to the inability of Anselm and Descartes to conceive of God otherwise than after the classical tradition. For his own part, however, he prefers to speak of modal rather than ontological arguments for the existence of a perfect being. "Had the proof been known as the Modal Argument," he asserts, "the chances of a genuine in- quiry would have been greater. Critics have generally discussed the problem as though it concerned a mere question of fact, of contingent existence versus contingent non-existence. This is not a modal distinction in an unambiguous sense, inasmuch as the mode of contingency is the neutrality of a predicate as between existence and non-existence, and the denial of such neutrality is the disjunction necessary existent or necessary non-existent (i.e. impossible). To squeeze this modal complexity into the mere dichotomy 'existent versus non-existent,' is to fail to discuss what Anselm was talking about." 64 Hartshorne then sets down the "second form" of Anselm's proof along the lines of modal or symbolic logic which, he allows, may be rejected, but which cannot be shown to be mere sophistry. To him the assumptions are intuitively convincing, provided per- fection is construed in the neoclassical manner; a condition, of course, which Anselm did not fulfil. He lists ten marks or criteria of contingent individual existences and shows that in the light of these the old reductio ad absurdum counter-arguments are not impressive. The criteria will, he is convinced, rule out as not necessary every individual property except that of perfection in the strict theistic sense. For example, if "perfect island" qua "perfect" is declared to necessarily exist, and yet as "island" must, in the light of the ten criteria, be con- tingent, then it becomes evident at once, not that these marks of contingency are at fault, but that "a-or-the perfect island exists" is self-contradictory or plain nonsense."6 Yet these same ten " The Logic of Perfection, 50. m Cf. ibid., 73f., 83.</page><page sequence="21">MONOPOLAR THEISM 407 criteria can be applied to the actual divine states to show the rightness of regarding them as contingently related. He is careful to point out however that it is the actual divine states per se which are contingent, though in a manner without prejudice to the sense in which the states are "perfect." When these criteria are applied, especially the tenth which declares that an individual which exists contingently is "good" for some legitimate purposes only, the "state" will fall on the contingent side. "Thus any divine state excludes some conceiv- able legitimate purpose which another possible divine state would have fulfilled. Since this other state was possible, the mere ex- istence of God is not exclusive, even though the actual state is. Again, any actual state is within some quantitative and qualita- tive limits, for it is the knowledge of a world with such limits; whereas there might have been a state knowing some other world with other and wider limits, instead of this world with its limits. Thus the state, but not God, is essentially qualified by the limits in question. And it, but not He, is contingent." 66" The problem presented by classical theism arises from its con- ception of finite existents as contingent. The monopolar doc- trine posits the necessary existence of a perfect being outside these finite existents as the source and ground of their being. In this necessary being the idea of its essence is contained in the idea of its existence. It is, in other words, self-sufficient or neces- sary. From this the classical theist has gone on to conceive of this necessary Being as immobile, infinite and impassible. This is the question at issue between the classical and neoclassical theist. Does the idea of God as Necessary Being carry with it the im- plication of immobility? To the monopolarist the answer is clear- cut. A God in any measure contingent would be a God in some measure not necessary and consequently the argument from neces- sary or perfect being would be destroyed. As necessary being God is therefore immutable and vice versa. The dipolarist is not so easily dismayed. Indeed, to argue in the monopolarist fashion is, according to Hartshorne, nothing short of giving the whole theistic case away. His alternative is to maintain that all that is required of the argument is not the " Ibid., 88.</page><page sequence="22">408 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW establishment of the existence of a "necessary being" but of a being whose existence is necessary. It may well be that such a Being may alter in some respects the mode of that existence. To contend that God is a being whose existence is necessary and therefore free from contingencies and accidents is one thing. But to assert that what He is, beyond the basic fact of that existence as the ground of His own and others, may without any discredit to His perfection be said to contain contingent and accidental elements, is a very different question." There need be no contra- diction here at all. Now it is Hartshorne's contention that it is only by distin- guishing God's necessary existence from His contingent actual- ity that we can do justice either to the ontological proof or its critics."s When the ontological argument is reinterpreted in the light of dipolar conceptions, what is proved to exist is not any actuality, even divine, but only an existence. For the dipolar theist these two - existence and actuality - must be kept radi- cally distinct. The existence which is proved necessary is just as abstract as that designated "perfect." If there is any actual divine state manifesting the divine life, then God exists. Realiza- tion in some form is, after all, but another way of saying what personal existence always means. Thus, for example, that "I" exist, depends upon some possible state of my actual life. The actuality and existence of ordinary things are certainly con- tingent. In the case of God the distinction existence-actuality continues; and actuality is still contingent since there are alter- native possibilities even for the Divine Existent to realize. It is inherent in the very meaning of "divinity" that what "happens" will enter into God's "experience" as it happens. For the monopo- larist no distinction can be allowed between the Divine Existent and the divine actuality, and it is for this reason, according to Hartshorne "our invincible intuition into the transcendence of actuality with respect to all essences bars the way to a proof of existence from essence." 69 The dipolar interpretation, by contrast, makes this complaint 7 Cf. J. B. Cobb, Living Options in Protestant Theology (1962), 50f. 68 Cf. Philosophers Speak of God, 97f., 103. 89 Ibid., IO5.</page><page sequence="23">MONOPOLAR THEISM 409 void. For what is here asserted is not one divine actuality, but only that the class of divine actualities is not null. This assertion of the possible realization of possibilities by the divine Existent - 'actualities realizing divine potentialities for experiencing' - is itself no concrete particular. It is something plainly abstract and general. The realization of divine actualities can only belong to a divine Existent. But what precise divine possibilities out of the countless number are open to this divine realization is a question which a priori argument cannot settle. Thus, while the establishment of a being whose existence is necessary is a matter of abstract proof, the things which belong to the divine actualities which fall on the contingent side of actual divine states are questions of fact, not admitting of such abstract proof. It is in this way, Hartshorne concluded, that the contentions of the two forms of theism are reconciled; and with that reconciliation the ontological argument, for those who wish a secure basis for theism in the Anselmic context, is made effective. "What a tri- umph for Anselm - even though one which might have surprised and troubled him!" 70 Hartshorne makes no bones about his estimate of his own contribution. Unashamedly he claims that this is, as far as he can discover, the first theistic scheme with anything like a clear and consistent logic. Much is being said nowadays about philoso- phy being subjected to rigorous logical analysis. Yet here in the most important test-case of all, the theistic issue, there has been an astonishing failure to give radical application of its principles. It has been virtually assumed that with Aquinas, Hume and Kant this analysis has been already made! 7' In the light of this bold claim the reader may be eager to have the statement of Hartshorne's Ten Modal Proofs for God's Ex- istence. We set it out as follows in the hope that our understand- ing of the symbolic logic upon which it is constructed is accurate. (i) There is a perfect being strictly implies that it is logically necessary that perfect being exists (i.e., perfection could not ex- ist contingently). (2) It is a logical necessity that a perfect being exists or it is 70 Ibid. nThe Logic of Perfection, 88f.</page><page sequence="24">410 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW not true that it is a logical necessity that a perfect being exists (i.e., either a perfect being exists as a logical necessity or it does not). (3) It is not true that it is a logical necessity that a perfect being exists strictly implies that it is logically necessary that it is not true that it is logically necessary that a perfect being exists (this is a form of Becker's Postulate that modal status is always necessary). (4) Either it is logically necessary that a perfect being exists or it is logically necessary that it is not true that it is logically necessary that a perfect being exists (this is inferred from (2), (3)). (5) It is logically necessary that it is not true that it is logi- cally necessary that a perfect being exists strictly implies that it is logically necessary that it is not true that a perfect being exists (this is regarded by Hartshorne as an inference from (I); the necessary falsehood of the consequent implies the same of the antecedent: a modal form of modus tollens). (6) It is logically necessary that a perfect being exists or it is logically necessary that it is not true that a perfect being exists (inferred from (4), (5)). (7) It is not true that it is logically necessary that it is not true that a perfect being exists (this is, according to Hartshorne, an intuitive postulate or the conclusion carried over from the other theistic proofs: perfection is not impossible). (8) It is logically necessary that a perfect being exists (in- ferred from (6), (7)). (9) It is logically necessary that a perfect being exists strictly implies that a perfect being exists (a modal axiom). (io) Therefore a perfect being exists (inference from (8), (9)). We are not at all sure what to make of this effort. Hartshorne has much to say which is hard to be understood. But fancy trot- ting out this proof of God's existence to the workers in the fac- tory or to the frequenters of the market-place. And yet is it not down in the everyday world that our highest and holiest ideas of God should find a response? And did not Socrates, after all, dis- cover the market-place as the best sphere for his noblest philoso-</page><page sequence="25">MONOPOLAR THEISM 411 phizing? We do not suppose that Hartshorne is so naive as to demand that his modal proof should be presented quite in these terms. But can it ever be so dressed as to appeal to the ordinary man? It would have to be slaughtered for the sake of the butcher, kneaded for the baker and illuminated for the candle-stick maker! Hartshorne, to be just to him, does not regard his restatement of the proof as a knock-out, however it may be attired to appear in "Mind" or "The Mirror"; in "The Philosophical Review," or "The Reader's Digest." But he certainly does expect, in spite of the fact that neothomism, existentialism, fideism and logical em- piricism are still powerful influences in the opposite direction, that he should have a hearing. The challenge he issues to contemporary thinkers is one they would do well to take seriously. If, as Ogden claims, his treat- ment of the ontological argument is one of the most powerful in the whole discussion of the subject,72 then he is certainly entitled to a hearing. It is claimed that he has rendered much of the criti- cism brought against the ontological proof by Gaunilo and Kant, and those following them who have merely re-echoed their words, beside the point. His own neoclassical definition of perfection, it is said, has given to the ancient proof a new cogency. Hartshorne had himself proclaimed, some years ago, that reli- gious metaphysics had passed through one of the greatest trans- formations in its history; a transformation parallel to that which has taken place within the natural sciences. The time is now here, he suggests, for effective exposition, application, criticism, diffu- sion, and defense to be undertaken. He then entered the hope that "sooner or later" the new vision would be accorded the wide- spread attention it deserved." Hartshorne's vision has certainly tarried. There are, however, those who feel that the winds of change are blowing even here and that there are signs that the time has come for a serious encounter with Hartshorne's work. For Hartshorne has shown how classical theism has left itself an easy prey to philosophical ridicule because it has failed to take adequate account of the Object of its concern. He would have us think again. His chief complaint is that if only the idea of 2 Journal of Religion 44 (1964), 6. 5Beyond Humanism: Essays in the New Philosophy of Nature (1937), 8.</page><page sequence="26">412 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW God had been expounded according to the deliverances of be- lieving piety and worship; and, as he thinks, in line with biblical revelation, then the sting would have been taken from much of the criticism of the ontological argument from the beginning. Put positively, the implication is, that had the neoclassical view of perfection been made the premise of the proof it would have had a far more telling effect than it has had. Yet when one looks at the modal proof which he has elaborated we feel inclined to express ourselves in the modern way: "So what?" This is a justifiable reaction if it be seriously contended that here is a sure and certain proof of a divine Existent. But it must be remembered that Hartshorne, for all his rigorous logic, does not intend that we should be left, so to speak, with the naked conclusion of a bare argument. He takes the view that religion is neither anti-rational nor supra-rational: it is pre- rational. He can therefore write: "All proofs of God depend upon conceptions which derive their meaning from God himself. They are merely ways of making clear that we already and once for all believe in God, though not always with clearness and con- sistency. With no belief in God no belief could be arrived at; but the question at issue is as to the comparative self-knowledge of 'believers' and 'unbelievers.' Both employ ultimate concep- tions which unbelievers tend (or so it seems to believers) to leave unanalyzed." 4 In this regard it may be observed that Hartshorne, and Mal- colm also, who as we noted defended the proof, are at one. Mal- colm asks what is the relation of Anselm's ontological argument to belief. He can well imagine, he says - and so can we - an atheist becoming convinced as to its validity, and indeed de- fending it from criticism, yet remaining an atheist meanwhile. It might have the effect of his saying no longer in his heart, "There is no God," because he would now realize that this is something he cannot meaningfully say or think. Yet it is not to be expected, nor is it possible, that a demonstrative argument would, in addition, produce a living faith. There is certainly a level at which one can view the proof merely as an exercise in 4 Man's Vision of God and the Logic of Theism (1941), 274f.; cf. also, 79-83.</page><page sequence="27">MONOPOLAR THEISM 413 logistics, following the deductive moves, as one would a game of chess, but not being thereby touched religiously. Even here, however, it would be unjust to condemn the argu- ment out-of-hand; for it may help to remove some philosophical scruples which might for some be serious barriers in the way of faith. At a deeper level however, the argument has significance only for the "one who has a view of that human 'form of life' that gives rise to the idea of an infinitely great being, who views it from the inside not just from the outside and who has, therefore, at least some inclination to partake in that religious form of life." 75 This would seem to be a most worthy conclusion; and it is one from which we would not want to make the least dissent. But such a declaration on Hartshorne's part lands him in diffi- culties. On the face of it he appears to involve himself in a con- tradiction. His whole effort is bent upon making secure a valid ontological "proof" of God's existence, only then to inform us that with no belief in God no belief could be arrived at. It is not at all clear how these two statements are to be reconciled. Or are we to take them as polarities to which we must assent? Some would regard this as an offence to their intellectual good taste. The question, however, which Hartshorne's apparent contradic- tion raises is a fundamental one. It forces once more into the open a discussion of the relation between reason and faith in a general way and in the case of Anselm in particular. When Harts- horne asserts that religion is neither anti-rational nor supra- rational, but pre-rational, he would seem to be declaring with Anselm that his ontological argument is Fides quaerens intellec- tum. And yet this does not seem to be quite Hartshorne's inten- tion. Is his ultimate position that of Anselm or Aquinas? He suggests that the proof of God's existence is at the same time the proof of His existence as a "loving" God.76 But is not the idea of God as love introduced from revelation? Then is he not really seeking to justify by his ontological proof a faith already held? Such a contention would put him in company with An- ' N. Malcolm, "Ontological Arguments," The Philosophical Review 69 (196o), 61f. ~ Cf. Faith and the Philosophers, ed. John Hick (1964), 27; cf. 35.</page><page sequence="28">414 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW selm, whose Proof, according to Barth, is a question of the proof of faith by faith which has already been established in itself without proof.77 The knowledge with which Anselm is concerned is that of intellectus fidei. This means that it consists essentially in a positive meditation on the object of faith.7 On the other hand when Hartshorne assures us that he is an "ultra-rationalist" whose sympathies are in general with the Roman Catholic position on the ability of the intellect to come to the logical certainty of God's existence,79 it would appear that he lines himself up with Aquinas. It is well known, of course, that Aquinas professed to reject the ontological argument (al- though it is the presupposition of all his Five Ways), but he took it for granted that reason is certainly capable of attaining at least a minimum knowledge of God.so Where reason is, Aquinas declares, faith hath no place; it is impossible to know and to believe a thing at the same time. It may be, of course, that Hartshorne, as E. L. Mascall, sees no essential difference be- tween Anselm and Aquinas on the relation between reason and faith. In this case he would probably accept Mascall's contention that Barth has not made good his thesis that Anselm had no in- terest in proving the existence of God. Barth indeed, according to Mascall, makes him out to be a Barthian before Barth.81 But it is, Mascall contends, Anselm's purpose to show that if God's existence could not be proved by reason, he would not be the kind of God that faith assures and which he certainly had.82 Both the Doctor Magnificus and the Doctor Angelicus began with the Christian definition of God, but it is the conviction of each that such a definition is of a character that the existence of the being to which it corresponds is capable of rational proof.83 Whether Barth or Mascall is the true interpreter of Anselm is an issue which we must leave open. It is not however altogether clear that Hartshorne for all his emphasis upon rigorous logic " Karl Barth, Anselm: Fides Quaerens Intellectum (E.T. 1960), 170. 78 Ibid., 39- 9 Faith and the Philosophers, 32. s Cf.

This, at least, is the impression one gets from some of his remarks. It still remains uncertain whether a knowledge of God is discovered first by reason or given first to faith. There is one more caveat we would enter before we take leave of our subject. In urging his dipolar theism we are left wonder- ing whether Hartshorne has been consistent in maintaining the equilibrium for which he contends. He has laid it down that classical theism by its failure to admit into its concept of God such ideas as becoming, relativity, and the like, ended up with a view of Him as a static absolute, more akin to Greek philosophy than to Hebrew-Christian thought. Yet we do not find Harts- horne altogether consistent in his own presentation. He seems at times to suggest that the two sides of the polarities should be kept in balance. But then he tells us that becoming, relativity, etc., which classical theism gave, at most, a "secondary" place, he would give the "primary" place. In so doing he seems to have fallen into the opposite error (assuming, that is, that the classical theistic side of the polarity is error), of making God another name for a being who "happens" to be; or, worse still, of equating Him with the Uncertain and the Unpredictable. If some presenta- tions of classical theism appear to make God to wear the appear- ance of static Fate, does not an account of God in whom the be- coming and the relative are "primary" almost suggest an idea of God as the ultimate Fickle? When Hartshorne seeks to redress the balance by declaring that "accidents," for example, are strictly outside God's essence, he seems to be going back on his assertion that the side of the polarities disapproved by classical theism should be given pride of place in what he regards as the correct understanding of the- ism or, in other words, the dipolar view of God. Yet, whatever difficulties may be uncovered in Hartshorne's account of his dipolar theism, there is one emphasis which this writer, at any rate, finds most refreshing. In contending against von Hiigel's idea of a divine sympathy which does not suffer he is, we believe, entirely in the right. For our part, while we are</page><page sequence="30">416 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW quite prepared to affirm belief in God as being without "body and parts," we hesitate when we come to add "and passions." The truth is that Calvary is the centre of the universe and the throne of God. And on that throne suffering love reigns. And as the man who lays down His life for others is the greatest among men, so, we may take it, the God who lays down His life for others is the only God.</page></plain_text>
