MELVIN AIKENS ABSTRACT Data from recent excavations in central, northern, and northeastern Utah, and in the southwestern Wyoming Basin, have prompted a reevaluation of current concepts of the ethnic and cultural origins of the Fremont culture centered in Utah, of its relationship to the Promontory culture of northern Utah, and of the relationship of both these cultures to protohistoric Central Plains culture. The long-standing interpretation of the Fremont as a northern "peripheral" variant of the Southwestern Ana- sazi culture is discarded, and a hypothesis of a North- western Plains (probably Athabaskan) population par- tially acculturated to the Anasazi Pueblo pattern is proposed. Additionally, identity of the so-called Promon- tory culture with the northern Utah variant of the Fre- mont culture is postulated on evidence from sites in northern Utah. It is suggested that the Fremont culture drifted back onto the Central Plains around approximately A.D. 1400-1600, under pressure from the Shoshonean expansion out of the Great Basin, to become the fore- runner of the Dismal River culture, which has been attributed to the Athabaskan Plains Apache. VER SINCE Morss (1931), on the basis of his surveys in the Fremont River drainage of east-central Utah, defined the Fremont as a culture that was "primitive and peripheral" to the Southwest, it has been the object of a great deal of speculation. In fact, it may fairly be said that more pages of discussion of its origins, relationships, and ultimate fate have been writ- ten than have pages of primary data. Despite this volume of discussion, there is justification for yet another paper attempting to deal with these problems. This justification is found in two facts. First, University of Utah excavations in southwestern Wyoming (Sharrock 1966), in the Uinta Basin of northeastern Utah (Ambler 1966), and in central and northern Utah (Shar- rock 1965; Aikens 1965, 1966a, 1966b) have at least doubled the amount of data available on the Fremont culture. Second, these new data have stimulated a reorientation of thinking about the origins and disposition of this culture. There is not space to review the various con- tributions to the Fremont and Promontory prob- lems here, but a general summary of ideas con- cerning them can be presented (see Worming- ton 1955 and Taylor 1957 for summaries). First, it is generally agreed that the Fremont culture is a peripheral, attenuated manifestation of the Southwestern Anasazi culture, and that it is a blend of traits of two chronologically dis- tinct (in the Anasazi homeland) phases, Modi- fied Basketmaker and Developmental Pueblo (Morss 1931: iv; Steward 1936: 58; 1940: 468; Rudy 1953: 166, 167). Evidence of Plains traits in the Fremont culture has been cited by several authors, especially Wormington (1955: 179), but, in the face of inconclusive evidence, no real attempt has been made to account for their presence. Rather, they have been put off as "enigmatic." Second, it is agreed that the Fremont culture resulted much more from the diffusion of Ana- sazi traits into Utah than from the migration of Anasazi culture bearers (Steward 1936: 61-2; Rudy 1953: 168). It is thought that Anasazi traits moved northward from the nuclear South- west into Utah and there blended with the indigenous Desert Archaic culture to produce the distinctive Fremont variant. Much of the distinctive character of the Fremont culture is thought to result from the Fremont's reten- tion of a heavy Desert Archaic emphasis on hunting-and-gathering, with horticulture never having become really central to the culture, as it did among the Anasazi (Rudy 1953: 168; Wormington 1955: 176-7; Jennings and others 1956: 103-4; Taylor 1957: 146-67). Third, and related to this last point, the Fre- mont people have been thought to be ethnically either Desert Archaic Utah indigenes of general Shoshonean type somewhat modified by a de- gree of Anasazi gene flow (Steward 1936: 57; Rudy 1953: 168), or to be a broad variant of the Southwest Plateau (Anasazi) stock (Reed 1955: 42-3). Opinion on this topic has not been unanimous, however. Stewart (1940) and Enger and Blair (Enger and Blair 1947; Blair 1949) pointed to possible Athabaskan affinity of the Fremont physical stock, but the ramifica- tions of their suggestions were not pursued by them or by subsequent writers. Fourth, the disappearance of the Fremont cul- ture, presumed to date to the 12th century, has been explained variously as a result of the Fre- mont having been driven out by hostiles (Stew- ard 1936: 62), as a regression to the original Desert Archaic level of the indigenes, with the Fremont population remaining in situ to become 198</page><page sequence="2">FREMONT CULTURE RELATIONSHIPS the Ute and Paiute (Rudy 1953: 169; Taylor 1957: 166), or as an abandonment by the Fre- mont culture bearers, who moved southward to be assimilated by the Anasazi (Wormington 1955: 187). None of these views has been demonstrated conclusively. No cultural relationship between Promontory and Fremont has been recognized, but the gen- eral northern affinities of the Promontory assem- blage have been discussed, and it has been pos- tulated that it is related to the Dismal River aspect of the west-central Plains, and that it probably represents an Athabaskan thrust into Utah from the Plains in late protohistoric times (Gunnerson 1956). The existing interpretation must be consid- ered inadequate in that it fails to account satis- factorily for a number of problems noted, but not pursued in the literature, and for new data uncovered by the recent University of Utah field work mentioned above. These problems are as follows: (1) Emerging evidence suggesting a northern origin of the Fremont folk (Reed 1966; this interpretation is based on new data and will be discussed further below). (2) The presence in the Fremont area of Northwestern Plains-style pictographs (Worm- ington 1955: 160). (3) The Fremont's incised, punched, and applique-decorated gray-ware pottery-these techniques of surface manipulation are common in the Northern Plains, but largely foreign to Southwestern pottery. (4) The occurrence of stone alignments inter- preted in some cases as tipi rings (a Northwest- ern Plains trait) at and near Fremont sites, and in Fremont territory generally (Malouf 1944: 327; Wormington 1955: 160; Taylor 1957: 32; Aikens 1966b). (5) The finding in the Fremont area of hide shields very similar to modern Apache (Atha- baskan) shields (Morss 1931: 69) and assigned to the Fremont culture through their similarity to Fremont shield pictographs (Wormington 1955: 165). (6) The sharp boundary between the Fre- mont and Anasazi areas (Euler 1963: 80; Aikens 1965: 7) -not to be expected if the Fremont were merely an attenuated peripheral version of the Anasazi. (7) The absence of kivas in the Fremont cul- ture. The structures that have been so desig- nated (Judd 1917; Gillin 1941; Steward 1933) are better considered pit house dwellings of non- ceremonial function. The structures designated as kivas by these authors were associated with aboveground structures thought by them to be dwellings, but which are more properly inter- preted as storage rooms because of their general lack of interior features and occupation debris (see Schroeder 1955: 20; Meighan and others 1956: 15, 19-20; Taylor 1957: 157, 160). In addition to the absence of kivas is . . . the general absence throughout the Northern Peri- phery of those economically desirable and easily trans- portable traits that partially identify Pueblo I-II in the San Juan area - sandals, cotton cloth, domesticated tur- keys, grooved axes, banded neck pots, scoop ladles, can- teen, etc. (Judd 1940: 428). (8) The association in several Utah sites of Fremont and Promontory culture remains (Steward 1937: 48-9; Smith 1941: 15; Enger 1942: 100-01; Jameson 1958: 10; Aikens 1966a: 49-50), and the coexistence of Fremont and Promontory traits in certain reported collections of pottery (Malouf 1944: 327; Jameson 1958: 14; Aikens 1966a: 55-6). (9) The claim (Gunnerson 1956) that Prom- ontory culture is the result of a "protohistoric thrust" of Dismal River bison hunters into the Great Basin, when Promontory material is dated considerably earlier than Dismal River with an early date of ca. A.D. 900 (Aikens 1966a: 103). (10) The fate of the Fremont folk after their abandonment of the Utah region. The hypo- thesis that they remained to become the Ute and Paiute (Rudy 1953: 169; Taylor 1957: 166) is rendered questionable by Reed's (1966) re- cent study tentatively identifying the Fremont folk as Deneids (Neumann 1952) of northern origin. If a sizable Deneid Fremont population had drifted south to be absorbed by the Anasazi (Wormington 1955: 187), it should have left a clear impression on the Anasazi Pueblo culture and the Southwest Plateau physical stock, and no such impression has yet been noted. The Pueblo affinities of the Fremont culture are numerous and well documented (Ambler 1966). It is not the purpose of this paper to argue further the mechanisms of Anasazi influ- ence on the Fremont culture, as has been the focus of discussion in the past, but to shift the topic to discussion of the heretofore neglected northern relationships of the Fremont culture, 199 AIKENS ]</page><page sequence="3">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY TABLE 1.

The remainder of the paper attempts to establish the extent and significance of these relationships. EVIDENCE FROM PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY The earliest finders of Fremont skeletons (Judd 1926; Steward 1936; Gillin 1938), and some of the later ones as well (Gunnerson 1957), agreed that the physical type of the Fre- mont people was either "typically Pueblo" or of an unknown indigenous Great Basin stock tinged by Pueblo gene flow. This view of the Southwestern provenience of the Fremont pop- ulation, in part at least fostered by the unfor- tunate early designation of the Fremont area as the "Northern Periphery" of the Southwest, has dominated all subsequent writing about Fre- mont ethnic origins. Despite its popularity, how- ever, this view has not been unanimously sup- ported (Stewart 1940; Enger and Blair 1947; Reed 1955), and in a recent paper, Reed (1966) has presented evidence for a northern rather than Southwestern origin of the Fremont popu- lation. Five well-preserved adult male skulls recovered by recent University of Utah excava- tions (Ambler 1966; Aikens 1966a) provided the basis for Reed's study, which was then expanded to include a number of the Fremont skulls ear- lier reported by Steward (1936), Gillin (1938), Enger and Blair (1947), Blair (1949), Worm- ington (1955), and Gunnerson (1957). Reed (1966: 8) concluded that these skulls, which represented a wide geographic area within Fre- mont territory, were ".. .. not Southwestern not merely not Anasazi, but definitely outside the range of the Southwest Plateau or Ashiwid type. . . " Contrasts between the Southwest Plateau type and the Fremont skulls which Reed (1966) points out in exposition are summarized in Table 1. The Fremont type thus described resembles the Deneid and Lakotid (Neumann 1952) va- rieties, as well as other Plains and northern groups. By contrast, Reed (1966: 8) sees "no close resemblance to the rather long-headed, fairly high-vaulted, moderately long-faced, me- sorrhine and hypsiconch population of the Great Basin." An analysis by Turner (1965) tested for ABO antigens a skeletal population of nine indivi- duals, upon the adult males of which Reed partially based his hypothesis. According to Turner, modern Athabaskan blood contains up to 23%-24% A1 allele, and this allele does not occur within the sample tested. This lack of A, could be, however, due to the small sam- ple size; Turner points out furthermore, that because of the effect of adverse soil conditions on the bones examined, the analysis may be inconclusive. A second question concerning the hypothesis that the Fremont population is of the Deneid variety, and therefore possibly Athabaskan, is that it hinges on Neumann's (1952) typology of American Indian varieties, which may be questioned both on methodological grounds and for the small sample upon which it is based. Firm demonstration of the validity or possible lack of validity of the hypothesis will therefore require much more skeletal evidence than is now available on the Fremont population, as well as a reassessment of Neumann's material and a comprehensive study of archaeological and living populations of the areas adjacent to Fremont territory. The data for such a study do not at present exist. It may be noted, how- ever, that the hypothesis of a northern physical type of the Fremont people fits well with the archaeological evidence of northern Fremont origins, and that the archaeological and physi- cal lines of evidence thus lend support to one another. No Promontory burials have yet been found, and until such are recovered, that aspect of the hypothesis which suggests that the Fremont and Promontory folk were of similar northern origin 200 [ VOL. 32, No. 2, 1967</page><page sequence="4">FREMONT CULTURE RELATIONSHIPS 0 w FIG. 1. Shield figure pictographs from Pictograph Cave, Montana, top, and Fremont sites loy 1958; Wormington 1955). rests entirely on cultural rather than physical evidence. ARCHAEOLOGICAL EVIDENCE Northern antecedents of the Fremont culture are suggested by sharing of the following traits between Fremont and the Late Prehistoric pe- riod culture of the Northwestern Plains (see Wormington 1955; Taylor 1957; Mulloy 1958 for summaries): (1) Shield pictographs. In addition to the basic form, a large number of decorative motifs are shared (Fig. 1), and the "tear-streak" motif of the northern pictographs occurs also on Fre- mont figurines (Taylor 1957: 158). Actual hide shields (Fig. 2) found in the Fremont area re- semble those of the pictographs and are said by Morss (1931: 69) to closely resemble modern Athabaskan (Apache) shields in the Peabody Museum collections. (2) Tipi rings. Circular stone alignments, generally called "tip rings" for their assumed function in holding down the hide covers of tipis, occur in abundance throughout the North- western Plains. Mulloy (1958: 211) questions whether these stone alignments were actually used for such a purpose, but papers by Kehoe (1960) and Malouf (1961), utilizing ethno- graphic data, quite adequately demonstrate that most, if not all, so-called "tipi rings" are in fact that. Similar stone circles (including circles di- in Utah, bottom (Mul- vided pie-cut style like Plains medicine wheels [Malouf 1944: 327]) and squares occur at a number of locations in Utah, some of them at or near Fremont sites. The distribution of these features has been summarized by Taylor (1957: 32) as including most of eastern Utah, and addi- tional examples have been recorded (Aikens 1966b) from the Fremont village site of Snake Rock in central Utah. Tipi rings with Fremont pottery lying on the surface within the rings also have been found by Sharrock (1966: 109- 11) in the western Wyoming Basin. FIG. 2. Hide shields from the Fremont area.

(3) A degree of similarity between North- western Plains Late Prehistoric period structures from Pictograph Cave (Mulloy 1958: 78) and the Hagen site (Mulloy 1942: 6) and two from the Fremont-Promontory site of Injun Creek (Aikens 1966a: 153) in northern Utah (Fig. 3). All four units were above ground structures of pole-and-mud construction. Two were roughly rectangular, with no interior supports. The Hagen site unit dates to approximately the same period (ca. A.D. 1700) as the Injun Creek unit (ca. A.D. 1400-1600), and the Pictograph Cave structure is somewhat earlier. (4) Projectile point forms. Small triangular corner-notched, and side-notched concave-based points occur at Pictograph Cave in southwestern Montana and in Fremont sites generally (Mul- loy 1958: 33; Wormington 1955: 50, 52; Taylor 1957: 59). (5) Bone and antler artifact types, including unilaterally barbed bone points, bone fishhooks, antler wedges or chisels, and bone whistles (Mulloy 1958: 102,104,108; Wormington 1955: 157, 172; Taylor 1957: 127, 129; Gillin 1941: 42-3, Pls. 2, 3, 5; Smith 1942; Ambler 1966; Burgh and Scoggin 1948: 75; Steward 1936, Fig. 16; Gunnerson 1962, Fig. 5). None of these ele- ments occurs exclusively in only Northwestern Plains and Fremont sites, but (with the excep- tion of the widespread projectile point styles) their relationships are all either northern (Co- lumbia-Fraser Region and Northwestern Plains) or Plains (Nebraska, Kansas [Wedel 1959; Smith 1950; King 1950]) rather than Southwestern. (6) Moccasins. This resemblance is general only, as the moccasin known from Ghost Cave in the Northwestern Plains (Mulloy 1958: 118) was very fragmentary, and it cannot be deter- mined whether or not it was of the unique Fre- mont type described by Morss (1931: 64-97). (7) Plains Woodland-like techniques of pot- tery decoration by incising, punctating, and ap- plique (cf. descriptions in Mulloy 1942: 13-38, 1958: 195; Wormington 1955: 67-74; Taylor 1957: 48-53, 96-7). (8) Bison hunting (Mulloy 1958: 16; Aikens 1966a: 103). A Northern Plains origin of the Promontory Caves assemblage is indicated by the following Promontory traits which are generally northern and/or Plains in distribution (Steward 1937: 69- 70, 84): (1) Four-piece moccasins of distinctive form, made historically by Tlingit, Tahltan, Tshim- shian, Naskapi, and Montagnais. (2) Mittens: a similar type is made by the Lemhi Shoshoni. (3) Sinew-backed bow: wide distribution, but generally northern. (4) Plains type of hand-game bones. (5) End Scraper: especially Plains in dis- tribution. (6) Possible beaver-teeth dice: known from Puget Sound. (7) Paddle-and-anvil made pottery of prob- able Plains-Woodland affinity. (8) Serrated bison metapodial flesher: espe- cially Plains. (9) Bison-hunting economy. Associations between Fremont and Promon- tory assemblages are the folowing: (1) Physical association of Fremont and Prom- tory artifacts within the same strata of a number of sites in the Great Salt Lake region (Steward 00 0 0 0 0 0* 0 0 a ~~0 0 0 0 0~~~ 0 C~~~~ 202 [ VOL. 32, No. 2, 1967</page><page sequence="6">FREMONT CULTURE RELATIONSHIPS 'I n I~~'* FIG. 4. Comparison of anthropomorphic figures on etched slate Promontory slabs with Fremont anthropo- morphic pictograph figures (Steward 1937, 1941). 1937: 48-9; Smith 1941: 15; Enger 1942: 100- 01; Jameson 1958: 10; Aikens 1966a: 32-3, 103). (2) Fremont or Fremont-like traits in the Promontory assemblage, including the tubular pottery pipe, cedar-bark rings (pot rests), pos- sible wooden tubes for the hidden-ball game, bird-bone beads, perforated pottery disks, pos- sible cane dice, and horned anthropomorphic figures on the distinctive etched slate "Promon- tory slabs" (Fig. 4) which are reminiscent of horned anthropomorphic Fremont pictographs (Steward 1937: 77-8, 84). (3) Sharing of technological similarities in ce- ramics, including the manufacture of predomi- nantly plain ware, decoration of surfaces by punching, applique, or incising (cf. Steward 1937: 42-9; Taylor 1957: 48-53, 96-7), and the occurrence of certain pottery sherds which ap- pear to be inter-grades between the Promontory and Fremont types (Malouf 1944: 327; Jameson 1958: 14; Aikens 1966a: 55-6). These data are interpreted to mean that the Promontory assemblage does not represent a cul- tural group separate from the northern Utah Fremont; rather, it merely contains several vari- ant items of Fremont material culture. Most Promontory and Fremont artifact classes are similar; the distinctive cast of the Promontory assemblage may be largely due to the fact that the sites in which it appears are seasonal hunt- ing camps, and, since it is derived from dry caves, it contains many normally perishable items not found in open Fremont sites. Dismal River culture has been characterized by Gunnerson (1960a: 141) as consisting prob- ably of ". . . an alien base with a thick veneer of Plains traits." No Plains or other antecedents for the culture have yet been recognized. A pos- sible Fremont-Promontory base for Dismal River rather than a Dismal River parentage of Prom- ontory, as proposed by Gunnerson (1956), is suggested by the following: (1) The long-known date of Fremont, and a newly obtained date of Promontory, both of which are earlier than Dismal River. A radio- carbon date of A.D. 885 ? 120 (GX0359) for the Fremont-Promontory Bear River #1 site (Aikens 1966a: 103) in northern Utah confirms stratigraphic evidenceof an earlier than ca. 1650 date (the date of Dismal River) for Promontory material. This is bolstered by a radiocarbon date of A.D. 1110 ? 75 years (GXO551) on a diag- nostic Promontory moccasin collected by Stew- ard from Promontory Cave No. 1 (Aikens 1966a: 135). (2) Ceramic similarities. Dismal River pot- tery, unusual on the Plains in comparison with contemporary cord-marked, paddle-stamped, etc. Plains wares, shares with Fremont and Promon- tory pottery a predominance of plain-surfaced vessels and incising and punching as techniques of decoration (Gunnerson 1956: 69-70). Addi- tional traits shared by Dismal River and Fre- mont pottery are thinness, black color, fine paste and temper, a high mica content in the paste, and a high frequency of polishing on plain-sur- faced vessels (cf. Gunnerson 1960a: 246-7 and Rudy 1953: 79-92). (3) General similarities of Dismal River and Promontory stonework, including end scrapers, tanged scrapers, some projectile point types, tub- ular steatite pipes, and sandstone arrowshaft smoothers. Additionally, incised slate slabs, common in Promontory culture, while not ap- pearing in Dismal River do occur in other Late Plains complexes, including Lower Loup, One- ota, and historic Pawnee (Gunnerson 1956: 69). (4) A degree of similarity between the Dis- mal River house type, which is unusual for the Plains (Gunnerson 1960a: 249), and a house recently discovered at a Fremont-Promontory site (Fig. 5) in northern Utah (Aikens 1966a: 159).

(6) The identification of the Dismal River people as Plains Apache (Champe 1949), and the probability that the Fremont folk were Atha- baskans. This latter is suggested by the Fremont's apparent physical type (Reed 1966), artifactual evidence of northern cultural antecedents of Fremont, and the coincidence of time between the Northern-Southern Athabaskan language divergence (Hoijer 1956; Hymes 1957) and the first appearance of Fremont culture in north- western Colorado (Burgh and Scoggin 1948). Both the latter events are estimated to date at or shortly after ca. A.D. 500. (7) A coincidence in dates between the latest known Fremont and early Dismal River. Re- cent radiocarbon dates from the northern Utah Injun Creek site of A.D. 1365 ? 90 years and A.D. 1605 ? 100 years (GX0552 and GX0553) sug- gest that Fremont in Utah lasted to approxi- mately the period when the earliest Dismal River culture appears on the Plains ca. A.D. 1650 (Gunnerson 1960b; Aikens 1966a: 33). CONCLUSIONS Most of the above facts, particularly those relating to the Fremont culture, have long been recognized; Morss (1931) pointed out a number of them in the monograph in which he first described and defined the Fremont culture. Yet, because the Fremont culture area was early tag- ged the "northern periphery" of the Southwest, these factors - difficult to explain as features of a merely attenuated peripheral Anasazi cul- ture - have repeatedly been dismissed as "enig- mas" or "paradoxes." They have never been seriously (or even casually) considered as pos- sible indicators of a non-Anasazi affiliation of the Fremont culture, and the appellation usu- ally used in discussing the Fremont, the "north- ern periphery," thus stands as a classic example of the effect of unfortunately chosen terminol- ogy in channelizing thinking. Paradoxically (somehow appropriate in a field of study where paradoxes have long been accepted), the term "northern periphery" has been disparaged by virtually every writer who has discussed the area on just this ground, and yet the peripheral bias has clearly dominated everything that has been written about the Fremont. The hypothesis, briefly outlined at the begin- ning of the paper, to account for the non-Ana- sazi features of Fremont culture, and the appar- ent relationships between Fremont, Promontory, and Dismal River may, on the basis of the evi- dence, now be amplified as follows: The proto-Fremont people were a group of Northwestern Plains origin, probably Athabas- kans. They moved southward and westward into Utah at approximately A.D. 500 - this date is derived from the approximate beginning dates of the Northwestern Plains Late Prehistoric pe- riod (Mulloy 1958: 222) and early Fremont (Burgh and Scoggin 1948: 89), and coincides with the lexicostatistic date of ca. 1,300 years ago for the split between the northern and southern Athabaskan languages (Hoijer 1956: 231-2 and Hymes 1957: 293-4 recalculation). The new population may have encountered and assimilated a sparse Desert Archaic culture population which had already begun to acquire some Southwestern or Anasazi traits (Basket- makers). As increments to their established cultural pattern of bison hunting. use of skin tipis and moccasins, making of coiled basketry, and drawing of shield Dictographs (and hence undoubtedly also use of shields), the early Fre- mont folk acouired (partly perhaps from Utah Basketmaker indigenes, partly through diffusion from the nuclear Southwest) and modified Pueblo horticulture, architecture, and ceramics. It was these obtrusive elements which gave their culture its distinct Southwestern cast. The im- migrants synthesized from Northwestern Plains and Anasazi elements a mixed horticultural- hunting economy, the distinctive Fremont rock art, and a pottery tradition in which traits of both Anasazi (plainware made by coil-scrape 204 [ VOL. 32, No. 2, 1967</page><page sequence="8">FREMONT CULTURE RELATIONSHIPS method) and Plains (decoration by incising, punching, and applique) ceramic traditions were incorporated. (Within the Fremont pot- tery tradition, there is a north to south gradient, with Plains traits more prominent in the north and Anasazi traits more prominent in the south.) On the northern fringe of the Fremont area (the Great Salt Lake region) the local culture exhibited a relatively high proportion of North- western Plains traits because of proximity to the Northwestern Plains homeland, and possibly also as a function of additional increments of population after the original proto-Fremont in- flux into Utah (this is the assemblage known as "Promontory culture"). At least by ca. A.D. 1600, and perhaps earlier, the Fremont people began to drift back eastward onto the Central Plains, under pressure from the Shoshonean expansion out of the southern Great Basin (Lamb 1958). Back on the Plains, they selec- tively adopted some elements of late Plains cul- ture to form the unique complex known as the Dismal River aspect (attributed to Plains Apache) of western Nebraska and Kansas and eastern Colorado and Wyoming. PROBLEMS This paper has marshaled and presented sup- port for a hypothesis of Northwestern Plains ancestory of the Fremont culture, for cultural identity of the northern Utah Fremont and Promontory archaeological manifestations, and for Central Plains descendants of the Fremont culture. The hypothesis cannot yet be claimed to have been demonstrated, and work on the problems below will be required to test the hy- pothesis and to more definitely establish the outline of Fremont culture history. Problems requiring additional attention are as follows: (1) Resolution of the possible time gap be- tween the end of Fremont and Promontory oc- cupation in Utah and the beginning of Dismal River occupation on the Central Plains. Two radiocarbon dates from the northern Utah site of Injun Creek suggest that no gap exists, but further corroboration of these determinations will be required before this may be accepted as more than a reasonable hypothesis. (2) The argument for Shoshonean pressure, which is postulated to have caused the eastward drift of Fremont, is derive almost entirely from Lamb's (1958) reconstruction of linguistic pre- history in the Great Basin. Archaeological evi- dence of Shoshonean pressures on Fremont has not been recognized, and this remains to be sought. Schroeder (1961: 87-8, 106-7) has im- plied that the archaeological data concerning Shoshonean and southern Great Basin groups may not be entirely consistent wtih Lamb's re- construction, and W. Taylor (1961: 77-8) has argued for a northern rather than southern ori- gin of the Shoshonean speakers. Taylor's recon- struction has been refuted by Miller (1964: 16- 17) and Goss (1966: 13-18), however, and Lamb's case has been reinforced by Goss (1966: 31-62). In any case, it may be noted that whether the Shoshoneans came ultimately from the south or the north is not crucial to the hypothesis here discussed, so long as they were in a position to exert pressure on the Fremont prior to A.D. 1400-1600, and evidence for a ca. A.D. 1150 dating of Shoshoneans (Southern Pai- utes) in southern Utah and Nevada is available from archaeology (Schroeder 1961: 106; 1963: 559; Euler 1963: 79, 1964: 379-80). (3) Determination should be made, prefer- ably through comparative study of objects rather than through published descriptions, of whether the Pueblo-like artifacts of Dismal River culture and the Dismal River area generally, which have been attributed to late Pecos Pueblo influ- ence (Gunnerson 1960a: 241-4), are in fact more closely related to Pecos or to Anasazi- derived Fremont materials. (4) Similarly, the material culture of the ear- ly Navajo Dinetah phase in the Southwest should be analyzed to determine whether some of the Pueblo-like traits there represented might be of Fremont-Dismal River derivation rather than the result of late adoption from the eastern Pueblos, as now thought (Hester 1962: 70). Huscher and Huscher (1942) over two decades ago adumbrated a possible Athabaskan-Fremont Promontory relationship in connection with a hypothesis of southward Athabaskan migration via the intermontane region, but this interesting hypothesis has usually suffered the undeserved fate of rather peremptory dismissal when it has been brought up at all in discussions of Atha- baskan culture history. A number of Dinetah phase traits, of course, have already been dem- onstrated to be of eastern Pueblo origin, but if it could be shown that Navajo or general south- ern Athabaskan culture possessed some Pueblo- like traits before entering the Southwest, it would explain at least partially what has been considered as phenomenally rapid acculturation AIKENS ] 205</page><page sequence="9">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY of the northern-derived Athabaskans to the Southwestern pattern. Specifically, it is sug- gested that the adoption of horticulture by some Athabaskan groups may have predated their arrival in the Southwest. Hester (1962: 68-9) has listed from a few sources a number of spe- cific similarities shared between Dismal River and Navajo culture, and a more detailed study between Fremont, Dismal River, and other southern Athabaskans might reveal additional relationships. (5) Recovery of Fremont and Dismal River skeletal materials in sufficient quantity for the demonstration or demolition of the postulate that these populations are of northern origin (possible Athabaskan) is essential. No skeletal material of Dismal River provenience is yet known, and the sample of Fremont material is very small. A related inquiry which should prove informative would be a comparative study of Fremont and southern Athabaskan skeletal material. (6) The internal characteristics of the Fre- mont culture require further study. Areal di- vergences within the Fremont culture in Utah have been recognized (Steward 1933; Worming- ton 1955; Jennings and others 1956; Ambler 1966) and require more thorough explication. The exploitative cycle or schedule of the Fre- mont horticulturists-hunters is yet unknown. The source of the Fremont's dent corn remains a problem. Galinat and Gunnerson (1963) have recently argued that it spread into the Fremont area from the Southwest, where it arose through teosinte introgression into a non- dented variety. More consistent with the indi- cations of a Plains origin of the Fremont, how- ever, would be the suggestions of Carter (1945) and Burgh and Scoggin (1948) that Fremont dent was introduced to the Utah-Colorado area from the Plains, where dent corn was the domi- nant type in late prehistoric and early historic times. This is a complex problem involving questions about the genetic composition of Fre- mont maize, as well as its archaeological distri- bution, and further botanical and archaeological research will be needed to resolve it. (7) The Injun Creek site (Aikens 1966a) and a site on Fremont Island in the Great Salt Lake (Rudy and Stoddard 1954) both show similari- ties in certain unusual artifact types (slate knives at Injun Creek, slate artifacts and stone bowls on Fremont Island) to assemblages from northern Canada, Alaska, and northern Cali- fornia (cf. Clark 1966; Elsasser and Heizer 1966). Northern traits in both the Fremont cul- ture generally and in the Fremont Island assem- blage imply that the puzzling Fremont Island manifestation may be in some way related, per- haps as a specialized site, to the Fremont culture attested on the shores of the Great Salt Lake in the vicinity of the island. This possibility is bol- stered somewhat by the occurrence of a stone bowl similar to those from Fremont Island at a Fremont site at the south end of the Great Salt Lake (Steward 1936: 38), but pending further information the identification of Fremont Island with the Fremont culture must remain tentative. These data, though tentative, are of interest with reference to the hypothesis that the Fre- mont culture bearers were Athabaskan. There are striking parallels between the Fremont Is- land stone bowls and those from the Patrick's Point site in northern California (cf. Elsasser and Heizer 1966: 114-15, Pls. 3, 4, and Rudy and Stoddard 1954, Figs. 76-7). Additional arti- facts from northern Utah Fremont sites which are similar to Patrick's Point and other northern Pacific coast materials are unilaterally barbed bone points, flat bone needles with eyes (Aikens 1966b), antler wedges (Steward 1936, Fig. 16; Aikens 1966a: 87), distinctive four-piece moc- casins, mittens, and beaver-teeth dice (Steward 1937: 84). Elsasser and Heizer (1966: 2-3) identify Pat- rick's Point as a prehistoric Yurok site, with a beginning date of ca. A.D. 1300. They note a basic (though not complete) homogeneity of culture among the linguistically diverse (Algon- kian, Hokan, Athabaskan) northern California coastal tribes, and they note also that on present evidence the coastal cultures appear to be late- comers to the area, perhaps arriving within the last 1,000 years. The centers of gravity of the Algonkians and Athabaskans are far to the north and east of northern California, and Utah (par- ticularly northern Utah) lies more or less on the route these people might have taken to arrive in northern California. It may, of course, be argued that the California Algonkians and Athabaskans are not derived directly from the main body of speakers of their languages, but a late westward expansion of culture-bearers from the north and east seems to most simply fit the lexicostatistic evidence of late Athabaskan arrival in Cali- fornia (Hoijer 1956; Hymes 1957), lateness of coastal occupation of northern California (Elsas- 206 [ VOL. 32, No. 2, 1967</page><page sequence="10">FREMONT CULTURE RELATIONSHIPS ser and Heizer 1966: 2), and the occurrence in Utah Fremont sites of a late time level of such artifacts as stone bowls, ground slate artifacts, and barbed bone points, which are ultimately far northern in inspiration. The hypothesis would also explain the very closely similar flicker-feather headdresses found at a Fremont site in northwestern Colorado and among ethnological materials in California, which prompted Hewes (1952) to propose a cultural bridge across the Great Basin, linking the Macro-Penutians of California with the Fre- mont people. It is suggested that this "cultural bridge" was furnished by west- and southward- expanding Athabaskans and/or Algonkians who ultimately settled throughout Utah and northern California. (8) Anasazi relationships must not be ignored in a shift of emphasis to the more far-flung rela- tionships of the Fremont culture. The signifi- cance of influences from the Great Basin and the Southwest to the areal diversity within the Fremont culture is not well understood, and the degree of gene flow between the Fremont and Anasazi populations is a problem for physi- cal anthropology. It seems unlikely that with the distintegration of the Fremont culture the entire Fremont population moved eastward onto the Plains (assuming the hypothesis presented in this paper to be correct), and it is quite prob- able, therefore, that some gene flow occurred between the Fremont and Anasazi (and per- haps also Shoshonean) populations. It is possible that the "brachycephalization" of some Anasazi populations in early Pueblo IV times (Neumann 1952: 20) is related to an influx of brachycranial Fremont people into the Pueblo area. Finally, the appearance of Mexican pyramidal dent corn and the Katchina masked-dancer cult in the Hopi country in Pueblo IV times may also con- ceivably be due to Fremont influence, though the formal analogies are not detailed between Fremont dent and Pueblo IV dent corn, and between the Fremont "katchina-like" picto- graphs and figures and the Anasazi examples, which suggests that there was no massive move- ment of these traits in unmodified Fremont form into the Anasazi area.
