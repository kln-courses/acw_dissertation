<plain_text><page sequence="1">I. NOTES ON THE CONCEPT OF MATERIEL 1. Introduction The following reflections owe their existence to Dahrendorfs theory of social classes as presented in his Class and Class Conflict in Industrial Society. This theory is a deliberate at tempt at a refutation of MarxTs class theory, inasmuch as Dahrendorf subordinates the concept of property to the concept of authority and claims that Marx confuses species and genus. The refutation caused me some intellectual uneasiness. I had the feeling that Dahrendorf had led our understanding of author ity and property down the wrong path by posing the problem in terms of species and genus. It seemed to me that if one tried to defend Marx against Dahrendorf with the contrary argument that the concept of authority should be subordinated to the con cept of property ? that is, if one accepted the genus-species argument ? then all that was novel and promising in Marx's famed materialism would vanish. It seemed to me that then MarxTs and Dahrendorfs class theories would in the end come down to the same thing: both would be equally dull. I therefore began to reflect a bit on the relation between authority and prop erty. The first thing was to pursue the thought that Dahrendorf linked his class theory to Max Weber's notion of power, i.e., that his theory was based on Max Weber's definition, cited a thousand times over, of power and authority. Therefore I soon 3</page><page sequence="2">4 Essays by Dag Gfeterberg left Dahrendorf by the wayside and began to reflect on the rela tionship between the basic concepts of Marx and of Weber. Is there a decisive difference in the logical form itself of MarxTs and Weber's concepts, or is the difference between them less deep-going; for example, is it that Marx stresses one side of social life, while Weber stresses another ? I tried to find the clearest possible contrast to Weber's view, in order thereby to more easily be able to find the crucial point. An antithesis to Weber is indeed to be found in Engels in his Anti-Duhring, where Engels claims that it is never force that creates the foundations for authority in class society, but rather the existing relations of production and forces of production. EngelsT assertion has been subject to much criticism, and is usually rejected as economism. But it seemed to me quite plausible that Engels nevertheless had hit upon something im portant, something it was important to take seriously. The next step was to take up again Sartre Ts theory of materi ality in society in his Critique of Dialectical Reason. Sartre, who himself strongly criticizes Engels1 theory of force, gives an extremely detailed account of how things participate in and mediate social contact among people. He even calls the under standing of the importance of things ? and in particular, of tools ? in history, Marxism's chief insight. That is, we seem here to have a theory in which power and authority (in the Weberian sense) are related to the material aspect of society (which Sartre calls the practical inert field, the inert field of action), in a way that, albeit unclearly, leads away from Weber's reasoning; but in what direction ? Some intense discussions brought a little light on the subject. It became clear that Weber had overlooked the fact that legitimate authority very often, perhaps even always, is based upon the impotence of those subject to it, that the latter are unable to re pudiate and abolish that authority, and that it is the material structure, pure and simple, of society that creates this impo tence. To denote this material structure of society I chose the word "materiel," in the broadest sense, as a common name for</page><page sequence="3">The Concept of Materiel 5 all the material accoutrements of society. This word has the advantage that it is closely related to the word "matter," and hence leads the way to the statement that materialism, as a basis for understanding in social theory, consists in taking into account the place of materiel in social relations among men. Such a thought is attractive for many reasons. For example, it opens the way for linking architecture and sociology, and we are happy to say that there are many attempts at this nowadays. But it is not enough to create a new word and to sketch out possible areas where it may find application. Sociological the ory needs something far more definite than such diffuse prom ises. It needs more than the expressions "materiel" and "ma terial structure"; it needs a concept of materiel and material structure. What I mean by this is that we need to know pre cisely what unanswered questions and problems in social theory may be solved or resolved with the help of these expressions. The following reflections are all an attempt to deal with this question. 2. All Things Must Be Understood in Terms of Their Material Relations Sociology, marked as it is by a socio-liberal view of society, has much to learn from Marx and the tradition following him. Three things it can learn, according to Antti Eskola, are the significance of 1) the material relations of life, 2) institutions, and 3) norms, power, and contradictions, and their relations. 1 As I see it, Professor Eskola is right in points 1 and 2, but wrong in point 3, and I shall try to show more precisely what I mean in claiming this. 1. Materialism as a method varies in its significance depend ing on the matter with which we are dealing. For sociology, materialism is first and foremost a way of emphasizing that human activity is materialized, and that social life therefore takes place in a world bearing the marks of our material ac tivity, i.e., a world of tools, signs, buildings, etc. ? in a word, of "materiel" in the broadest meaning of the term.</page><page sequence="4">6 Essays by Dag &lt;2feterberg Social relations are thus not exclusively ? indeed not even principally ? direct, unmediated relations among men. They consist predominantly of people's relations to materiel, e.g., to the production apparatus, and of the relation of a quantum of materiel to another quantum of materiel, e.g., the relation of money to commodities. The most important difference between materialism and idealism in sociology is their respective understandings of the significance of materiel. The former understands social rela tions in terms of their relations to materiel and the relations among material things themselves; the latter sees them in terms of individuals' relations to one another and to themselves: in terms of role expectations, attitudes toward roles and cul tural values, or, to take Professor Eskola's two good examples, in terms of their reference to group or ego image. Materialism does not deny that role expectations, reference groups, etc., are facts. It merely denies that they are essen tial facts, and claims that they must be understood in terms of material relations. 2. It follows from this that it is correct to give institutions priority in sociology, provided that we do not follow Professor Eskola in accepting idealism's definition of what institutions are. It is, in fact, misleading to define institutions as struc tures of norms and roles rather than defining them in relation to a material structure. Precisely because institutions are for the most part material entities they possess the inertia that makes them determining factors in the evolution of society. Thus, for example, liberal production institutions are not structures of rights, i.e., of expectations between buyer and seller, proprietors and the propertyless, normatively regulated competition, etc.; they are structures of a production apparatus that is in use ? i.e., of capital. The legal system governing production, as well as other structures (for example, the life style of the haute bourgeoisie) are understandable in terms of the structure of capital. Further, suppression takes place through materiel, in this</page><page sequence="5">The Concept of Materiel 7 case capital. Thus, an idealist such as Schumpeter can present the entrepreneur as the world's most peace-loving individual. He coerces and suppresses no one, involved as he is in calcu lating his market supply within the framework of the law. But a holistic approach shows that the capitalist class, by virtue of its control over materiel, renders impotent those who do not possess capital, and thereby forces them to accept them (the capitalists) as the ruling class. Applying the classical twin terms of "infrastructure" and "superstructure," materiel is the infrastructure of the ruling class, while the superstructure con sists of such sets of norms as the legal system, business eth ics, etc. 3. Alongside of Marx, D?rkheim is probably the classical writer who most stressed the significance of materiel, and it is interesting that Professor Eskola presents the two as com plementing one another. Still, I cannot agree with Eskola1 s position on the significance of norms. On the contrary, the stress laid on norms diverted a good deal of sociological research away from production relations, to focus instead on superstructural phenomena such as the dis tribution of social prestige, status symbols, etc. Likewise, middle-class morality has already long been recorded and de scribed down to its least detail, while our understanding of the attitude of functionaries toward and within the material struc tures of society suffers. Liberal sociology exhibits a number of such distortions, which in their turn are but the expressions of a methodological distortion: The ideas functionaries have of themselves and others are given primacy over the material situation men find themselves in and the material world around them. I further cannot agree that it is compatible with materialism to maintain that society is characterized by power and conflict relations. Within the tradition of Marx and Engels, this has been clear since Engels wrote Anti-D?'hring. D?hring was a philosophical idealist who maintained that relations of political power and contradiction are in several respects more important</page><page sequence="6">8 Essays by Dag 0sterberg than material relations and relations to materiel, and Engels attacked him sharply on just this point. This becomes even clearer when we take a look at Max WeberTs sociology. If he represents an antipode to Marx, it is not primarily because he stresses the irreconcilable and con flict-laden in relations among men, but rather because for him authority, i.e., the circumstance that one person rules over an other, constitutes the basic premise in terms of which society is to be understood. Materialism, on the other hand, starts with the premise that there is a structure of materiel in use, and understands relations of power in terms of it. One of the concrete consequences of this difference is that while Marx, the materialist, envisions a future classless society, the ideal ist Weber believes that class contradictions are inevitable. Weber's sociology is also vulnerable to Engels' criticism, as are the class theories of Weber's disciples, such as Ralf Dahrendorf, and probably also C. Wright Mills. Somewhat simplified, the contradiction between idealism and materialism may be described roughly as follows: The first views production relations as the expression of a class struggle, while the other sees the class struggle as the expression of production relations. It is materialism which leads us toward a more correct understanding of society. We are by no means denying that "ideas influence men," as it is usually formulated. To the extent that human activity is purposeful, we can well say that it is determined by ideas. Without the idea of revolution, Lenin would not have led the Oc tober Revolution. The question is rather: Do ideas change people's minds by being grasped and accepted for their intel lectual content, or by being materialized through human activ ity? Or to put it another way: Is it an idea as an idea that changes men, or is it an idea in its materiality that does so? I have already stated the answer I have arrived at: Ideas change men in both ways, but both are not equally good. He who wishes to change himself should endeavor to materialize his ideas, i.e., he should follow what I have called the method of materialism.</page><page sequence="7">The Concept of Materiel 9 3. Authority and Property as Class Relationships A. Remarks on a Contradiction within Class Theory 1. MarxTs Theory of Classes. Marx distinguishes social classes relative to one another in terms of their different re lations to the means of production. The two principal classes are those who own the means of production and those who do not. There are also other classes whose property relations to the means of production are not so clearly defined. These more indefinite and undefined classes are determined by their degree of solidarity or interest held in common with one of the two principal classes, if the course of events makes it necessary to define them at all, or for them to define themselves. The two principal social classes stand in a contradictory re lation to one another insofar as that which is of benefit to one is detrimental to the other: what enriches the one impoverishes the other. A class society is eo ipso a society with class struggle. In class struggle, the class that owns the means of production always has the upper hand, and that class is said to be the rul ing class. Those who work within the administrative system, 'the state," often seemto act as the ruling class, but this is mere appearance. The institution of the state is itself created by the ruling class, as its instrument or its expression. 2. Ralf Dahrendorfs Refutation of Marx's Theory. In Class and Class Conflict in Industrial Society, Dahrendorf claims that Marx's theory is wrong because it fails to distinguish among property, the right of property, and the general right to exer cise control over others, i.e., authority in general, and confuses these three concepts with one another. His argument is roughly the following: Property is a right over one or more objects, that is, it is one among several forms of legal authority. It is therefore wrong to define the ruling class as a class that owns the means of production, since prop erty is only one of many forms of authority. The ruling class</page><page sequence="8">10 Essays by Dag 0sterberg is composed of all those who rule, regardless of what form this rule or authority takes. He thus maintains that it is possible to refute Marx's theory "if we replace the possession, or non possession, of effective private property by the exercise of, or exclusion from, authority as the criterion of class formation." Further he says, that "whoever tries, therefore, to define au thority by property defines the general by the particular ? an obvious logical fallacy. Wherever there is property there is authority but not every form of authority implies property. Au thority is the more general social relation."2 This fallacy may have been easy to fall into in Marx's time, when property was probably the primary means for the exercise of authority. But the evolution of society has since changed all this in two ways. First, a form of collective ownership, as represented by cor porations, is becoming more and more typical of liberal indus trial society. The principle that has come to prevail is that each individual owner gives up the direct control over his prop erty in return for an annual dividend paid out of the property's profits. Direct control is handed over to the corporation's business managers, who need not necessarily own shares in the corporation themselves. These managers may thus exercise authority over the means of production without owning them. So goes the argument. These "managers," claims Dahrendorf, as have many others before him, are playing an increasingly more important role, which means that it is becoming an in creasingly more obvious fallacy to define the ruling class as those who own the means of production. Second, the evolution in a number of authoritarian agrarian societies has led to a more or less universal abolition of the individual's right of ownership over the means of production, yet these societies have not become classless. In these so cieties, certain groups clearly exercise control over the means of production, the educational system, etc., without owning the social materiel. Further, Dahrendorf claims that while ownership of the means of production can evidently be abolished as a particular form of authority, it is not conceivable that authority in general</page><page sequence="9">The Concept of Materiel 11 ? every form of authority ? could be abolished.3 There will always, therefore, be social classes: those who rule and those who are ruled. The task of sociology is to describe which layers of society are constituted into classes at any particular time, and at any particular time what the relations between the classes are. His own alternative is roughly the following: The ruling class in today's industrial society "consists of two constants, bureau cracy and government, and one variable, the veto group whose claims are, in particular situations, incorporated in government pol icy."4 These two constants comprise the leading layers within the three branches of the state: the legislative, the judicial, and the executive, plus the government and the national assem bly or parliament. Veto groups are groups of people to whom the government must pay heed, and on whose behalf it acts. With regard to the mutual importance of the three constituents of the ruling class he says: TTt is admittedly not sufficient to identify a ruling class solely in terms of a governmental elite, but it is necessary to think of this elite in the first place, and never to lose sight of its paramount position in the authority structure of the state."5 3. A Clarification of the Contradiction between Marx's and Dahrendorfs Respective Class Theories in the Light of Max Weber's Sociology. Dahrendorf refers, consistently enough, to Max Weber's work in expounding his own class theory, not because his is a further development of Weber's ? since, apart from a few concepts and allusions, Weber himself did not for mulate any such theory ? but because the concepts of domination and authority are among the most important, indeed, perhaps the most important in his entire social theory, as may be illus trated by the following quotation: Domination in the most general sense is one of the most important ele ments of social action. Of course, not every form of social action reveals a structure of dominancy. But in most of the varieties of social action domi nation plays a considerable role, even where it is not obvious at first sight. Thus, for example, in linguistic communities.. . .6</page><page sequence="10">12 Essays by Dag Cfeterberg To make clearer the contradiction we hope to resolve in this study, it will be convenient to shift our attention from the con tradiction between Marx and Dahrendorf to that between Marx and Weber, especially since Weber referred to himself as a "class-conscious bourgeois." For Marx, the relations of production and the forces of pro duction are the key concepts; for Weber, it is domination and authority which play the central role. For Marx, the ruling class is defined by its relationship to and place within the forces of production. For Weber, there is a contingent relationship between the ruling class and the forces of production. The rul ing class rules by virtue of its claim to legitimacy, of which there are various forms, each creating its own form of domi nation and authority, to which Weber continually recurs: tradi tional, charismatic, and legal bureaucratic. In Marx, too, class rule is ultimately based on the legitimate, on law. But the source of laws in turn lies within the productive forces. Thus, while for Weber the ruling class is defined in terms of its "grounds of legitimacy," for Marx it, along with its grounds of legitimacy, are together determined by the productive forces. Thus we see that each of these separate outlooks, i.e., Marx's view of things and Weber's (and after him Dahrendorf's), as pires to go the other one step further. From the Marxian viewpoint, Weber's conception is the outcome of an incomplete reduction of class relations; from the Weberian viewpoint, the Marxist view is the consequence of an inadequately generalized method. The new idea which Marx contributed to sociology, and which is implied in the term "materialism," is that all legitimacy, including laws and legal theory, are not their own raison d'etre, nor are they rooted in force, but rather in the productive forces. Weber does not refute this idea by going back to more basic premises. He, like so many after him, simply rejects it, main taining that the productive forces are in their turn determined by legitimacy, among other things. The ruling class owns the means of production, but since property is itself legitimate, the argument is that by positing the productive forces as the</page><page sequence="11">The Concept of Materiel 13 basis for what is legitimate, one is guilty of circular reasoning. I would say that in the question of Weber vs. Marx it is Weber who is wrong in his understanding of social classes, for Marx's materialism need not necessarily involve a petitio principii, provided the concepts of authority, grounds of legitimacy, pro ductive forces, etc. are defined more precisely than is usually the case. That is what Sartre (not to exclude other theoreti cians as well) has done in the Critique of Dialectical Reason, and to buttress my argument I shall draw to a great extent on the perceptions contained in that work. B. The Resolution of the Contradiction 1. The Importance of Matter, and of Materiel in Particular, in Society. Human activity, and relations among men, "social relations," unfold in a material environment. Matter exists either as something natural, or as something cultivated, and then as the trace of action, worked-over matter, "materiel" (see chapter 1 in my Meta-sociological Essay7), and, indeed, for the most part the latter. For sociology the relevant point is that historical materialism affirms the primary importance of materiel (tools, instruments, signs, etc.). Very few social relations are unmediated, direct relations between individuals on the one hand and worked-over matter on the other; matter mediates between men. A pertinent ex ample is the relation between the reader and this text, but more important cases are the relation between the individual and his money, or between the inhabitants of a city and its traffic sys tem. Materiel's mediating role modifies relations among men, and is why, for instance, divers forms of powerlessness, and the processes leading to that condition, are possible. 2. Powerlessness in General. Powerlessness, impotence, is a despairing relation between capacity and desire or aspira tion: it is to desire or aspire to do something that is beyond my capacities. But can I in fact aspire to something beyond my capacities ? May not this perhaps be a false desire, a flight</page><page sequence="12">14 Essays by Dag 0sterberg from reality into fantasy ? Is not impotence the expression of an intransigence, an irreconciliability in the face of necessity, of the world as it is ? In other words, is it not a "utopic," rather than a "topic" attitude toward one's own place in the world ? A society in which impotence were a vice, or flaw in the in dividual is perfectly conceivable and perhaps has even existed; it would be a society in which people adapted continuously, al ways meeting the demands placed upon them by their surround ings, and in which one's job, "the meaning of life," would be to respond affirmatively as much as possible by not aspiring to, or desiring, anything other than that which was always within one's capacities to achieve. This, however, has not been the kind of society we have had over the last few centuries. In our society, the goal is not to adapt oneself, but to adapt the world around one to one's own needs and desires, that is, to shape one's environment. The individual's capacities, talents, and desires themselves develop and unfold through such formative activity, and one learns to know oneself. Aspiration and capacity are united within the in dividual, as he is led to transcend his own limits. This unity is a power relation toward the world at large, and man is the world's master. In our society, a real unity between desire and capacity is achieved in the typical case by one's becoming master of his own environment. To adapt to one's environment is resignation, and creates a gap between capacity and desire ? in short, it creates impotence. Because, then, society in general aspires to power, impotence arises as an undesired exception to the rule. 3. The Power of Materiel to Render Powerless. Mass panic is a very good example of impotence in which materiel is not involved to any essential degree. In their haste to leave a burn ing theater, the public can be seized by panic, and some people may be trampled to death. Once panic arises, each does his part to enable the others to trample him to death. He compels</page><page sequence="13">The Concept of Materiel 15 the others to compel him to push forward ever more impatiently. Desperation grips each and all: If only the others would desist from pushing! But he himself is another for the others, and ul timately another for himself as well. He would like to stop pushing, but cannot, because of his own activity. In this case, impotence is a direct relation within a throng of individuals and can easily be brought to a stop by, for instance, an official leader calling out "stop! " When materiel mediates impotence, the latter becomes less easy to eradicate, as mone tary inflation, for example, shows. When the amount of money in circulation increases sharply in relation to the quantity of goods, prices rise abruptly. Each banknote or coin depreciates steadily in its buying power. To prevent further losses, everyone who owns anything attempts to convert what he owns into goods ? a flight into real values sets in. But this merely increases the rate of money's depreciation, and accelerates the flight from money into real values. Such a wave of inflation can, as we know, end in the devastation of an entire nation's economy. In any event, it is easy to see that in flation cannot be stopped in the same way as panic in a theater. While one can call out "stop! " to a throng of human beings run ning amok, it serves no purpose at all to call "stop!" to a mass of banknotes circulating at an increasingly frantic pace. The materiel aspect of money, its property of being worked-over matter, relates back to human purposeful activity, but it is not itself an active human being. As symbolic materiel, money mediates human intentions and purposes in the midst of social life, but this mediation leaves its mark and makes social life more inertly materiel than if it were fashioned exclusively of primary relations among human beings. With regard to infla tion, my powerlessness augments because money is a material sign, which clarifies the earlier statement that society's ma teriality and its materiel constitute special conditions for the creation of impotence. 4. Materiel and Authority. To understand a particular rela tion of authority, it is important to ask if the ruled accept being</page><page sequence="14">16 Essays by Dag Qfcterberg ruled. If so, we have a lawful (legitimate) relation of authority, with regard to which Weber made his triple distinction. If the ruled do not accept the authority over them, we have a nonlawful relation of authority, which can be of any number of different varieties: the ruled let themselves be ruled because they fear the ruler, or for the purpose of gain, etc. While accepted au thority is based ultimately on law, nonaccepted authority is based most often on force, and in Weber's system the concepts of legitimacy and physical force are accordingly quite important. But there is a kind of authority and domination which Weber does not mention, and that is authority accepted by virtue of the fact that materiel renders the ruled impotent, so that their si lence itself becomes a kind of consent: the individual does not accept, but he is also incapable of repudiating the authority. He is "killed by silence," and his silence is a tacit acceptance of authority. The authority rules over him by virtue of its control of materiel, so that the state of being ruled consists more in being barred from the use of materiel rather than in the accep tance of authority, or in force. The use of materiel creates its own acceptance. To take an extremely simple, yet perhaps clear example: To use a loudspeaker to call out "I own this loudspeaker" creates in itself the acceptance of my owning it, since those whom I am addressing can only protest with their own voices, i.e., they are condemned to being "killed by silence." 5. The Right of Property. Thus, the use of materiel creates the acceptance of its use. In particular, the use of an object gives rise to the right to use it. The ambiguity in the concept of property expresses this, something it might be worth reiter ating: A number of theoreticians (e.g., K. Davis in Human So ciety) maintain that property is not itself an object ? to believe that it is is to commit "the fallacy of misplaced concreteness." Rather, property is the right over an object. This seems to be true to the mark, for even the word "property" states that the object is my own, is proper to me, and this presupposes that I have the right to say just this about the object in question. It looks as if property is in itself a legal relation, so that property</page><page sequence="15">The Concept of Materiel 17 and the right of property come down to the same thing, and hence Dahrendorf would seem to be right in saying that property is a special case of authority. But all this is merely apparent. Both statements ? "prop erty is the right to an object" and "property is theft" (Proudhon) ? are incorrect compared to the statement that property is above all the use of an object, which, in turn, creates the right to that use. 6. Authority and Force. Consequently, a class does not rule because it can respond to a rebellion with superior physical force. A ruling class is created out of a society's material conditions, and it rules as long as the materiel of that society prevents the ruled from repudiating its legiti macy. To the extent that the ruling class defends its au thority with the help of a police force, it does not rule by virtue of the impotence of the ruled; then there is an open battle between two classes in which one may still be the weaker, but it is no longer impotent. Every use of force weakens the ruling class. 7. The State, Class, and Materiel. We should now be able to see why Max Weber is wrong in his Sociology of the State when he quotes Trotsky approvingly: "Every state is founded on force." In contrast to this, Sartre affirms that every state is founded on impotence, thereby referring indirectly to the quality materiel has of rendering impotent anyone who does not make use of it. The growing authority of the state in our society is rooted in the fact that officials are to an increasing degree cut off from materiel ? the means of administration ? something that Weber has demonstrated more clearly than anyone else. He points out, for example, the importance of the fact that a feudal serf owned his horse and his battle equipment, whereas today weapons are in the possession of the state.8 We should also now be able to understand how the state in turn is created by the ruling class insofar as the state exercises legislative, judicial, and executive authority. The relation be</page><page sequence="16">18 Essays by Dag $sterberg tween the state and the ruling class corresponds to the relation between the right of property and the use of an object. Use pro duces the right to use, which thus reinforces use. In an analogous manner, the ruling class creates its own state, which in turn reinforces its creator. 8. Taking Sides in the Marx vs. Weber (and Dahrendorf) Controversy, (a) It would be idle to take sides unreservedly with Marx against Weber and Dahrendorf; but by carrying Marx's theory further, by deepening it and clarifying it, we hope to arrive at a more correct understanding of social classes in present-day society, (b) The production apparatus has been and continues to be society's most important materiel. The ruling class is therefore defined in relation to it, but it is also important that materiel such as television transmitters, the school system, the telegraph system, etc., are included in the definition of the ruling class's infrastructure. To link the con cept of class to the concept of property was not just some bril liant trick of definition on Marx's part as Dahrendorf maintains, even though today that definition is no longer sufficiently pre cise. Weber's and Dahrendorfs attempt to go beyond Marx's theory of class by placing primary emphasis on the authority structure of society above its materiel structure are therefore wide of the mark. 4. Power and Materiel The thought that I shall pursue here is briefly the following: Descriptions of power, power relations, and power structures do not provide a sufficient political understanding if they are not linked to descriptions of the materiel and material struc tures of society. To make clear what I mean, let me repeat briefly the reasons why Althusser rejects humanism in his book For Marx. To speak about man, man's freedom, man's alienation, and man's liberation from alienation is, he claims, not in itself wrong or objectionable. Tactically, the terms of humanism may be use</page><page sequence="17">The Concept of Materiel 19 ful: they may help to make clear the contradictions in an indi vidual's existence and self-conception. But strategically they cannot replace the concepts of forces of production, relations of production, and mode of production. Concepts bearing on pro duction give us an insight into the conditions under which a so cial structure, and hence changes in that social structure, are possible. The terms of humanism, on the other hand, do not do so, and hence they are ideological, not theoretical, concepts. Likewise, the relation between power concepts and the concepts of materiel: power concepts ? abuse of power, greed for power, assumption of power, etc. ? by no means express imaginary aspects of reality, but express reality in an awkward way, com pared to the concepts of materiel. An understanding of material structures is extremely impor tant for political theory; they constitute the premises and define the limits of the possible for other social structures ? the structures of power, for instance. Let me give three examples of this, the first two of which have become classical. First Example. In Engels' theoretical examination of force in Anti-D?hring, he describes the material premises for the emergence of slavery, and for its decline, in antiquity. At a certain stage in the evolution of the forces of production, it was necessary to kill prisoners taken in battle; since there were no ways to occupy them, they would have been merely dead weight. Once the evolution of material structures created the means to enable prisoners of battle to make themselves useful, however, their lives were spared, and they were made into slaves. Thus, the slavery system corresponded to an increase in the produc tive forces. But the preconditions for the decline of slavery also lay within material structures ? in a further change, namely, in the productive forces. Experience has shown that slaves can only be used for work with rather simple tools, which moreover are not easy to break. When material evolu tion gives rise to other, more sophisticated tools, slaves be come unusable. They cost more than they produce. Thus, the master-slave power structure presupposed a certain stage in</page><page sequence="18">20 Essays by Dag 0sterberg the evolution of material structures, now surpassed. Second Example. In his theoretical discussion of value in Capital, Marx describes the material preconditions for Aristo tle's economic thought. On the one hand, developed commodity exchange, which in its turn presupposes markets, made it pos sible to raise the question of the specific features and laws of exchange relations. Aristotle observes that when a quantity of use objects is exchanged for another quantity of exchange ob jects of another sort, it is assumed that there is something equivalent about the two quantities. But what can this be ? We know Marx's answer: abstract human labor, labor time. Marx also observes, in vol. I, chapter 1, that it would have been im possible for Aristotle to come up with this answer because Greek society was based on slave labor; hence inequality among men and their labor power had its natural foundations. At that particular stage in the development of the material structure, then, the conditions making the concept of equality, and hence the concept of value, possible, were not present, but had to await their time. The conditions for what it is possible to think are to be sought in the material structure. Third Example. In his Critique of Dialectical Reason, Sartre describes the preconditions for turn-of-the-century anarcho syndicalism in the material structure. The most important in dustrial machine is the "universal machine," which can be used for numerous quite different kinds of work. It requires a skilled worker ? i.e., someone who has received special training, which can take several years ? to operate it. In addition, he needs a number of assistants around him who carry out his in structions. "The machine organizes men," writes Sartre. ".. .but at the same time ... it becomes its own idea.... it creates a humanism of labor in the hands and body of the person who op erates it."9 The skilled worker experiences the power of his own work and skills at his machine: it is he who transforms the world, for the whole of mankind. His rebellion against ex ploitation derives from his pride in being the one who produces. But the universal machine also engenders the assistants, auxiliary workers with no such pride of this sort, who in</page><page sequence="19">The Concept of Materiel 21 their work and in their lower wages experience their inferior status relative to the skilled workers. Thus, the machine cre ates a potential tension within the working class that is over come through the paternalism of the skilled workers. They feel a responsibility for the auxiliary workers, see to their po litical education, and protect their interests. But this solidarity rests on a precarious foundation. Anarchosyndicalism con demns exploitation on behalf of the superiority of skilled labor over other forms of activity, and in the event deprives itself of the possibility of protesting against the exploitation of the aux iliary workers on the basis of the value of labor. The inequality between skilled workers and helpers, we see, is rooted in the material structure. How could equality be affirmed, asks Sartre, "when it mattered very little if there was a strike of unskilled workers, whereas the absence of a few skilled workers, who would be very hard to replace, was enough to disrupt a whole workshop ?"10 This labor humanism can only be surmounted, how ever, when the universal machine is replaced by special ma chines, so that labor becomes the same for all: a fatiguing ne cessity and an enemy. Labor humanism gives way to an emer gent humanism of needs, which points the way to a new struc ture of solidarity among workers, which in turn heralds a new material structure. As regards the basis of the exercise of power, we are accus tomed to stating an either/or proposition: Either the exercise of power is accepted, and then it is just; or it is not accepted, and then force is involved, a force that is based on superior powers of constraint. Law or force ? these are the two pos sible bases for the exercise of power. To demonstrate this, one may take a look at the theories of Max Weber, one of the founders of bourgeois sociology. Weber had a lifelong interest in the various forms of power and the foundations of power, and made an especially penetrating en quiry into accepted exercise of power, which he called "author ity." Authority need not rest in any stated or written law, even if "legal authority" is the most usual form in our society. Au</page><page sequence="20">22 Essays by Dag 0sterberg thority can also be rooted in tradition, in a custom that one obeys fully without being wholly clear why. Finally, it can also be rooted in the unusual or fascinating qualities of the person who is exercising power, in his "charisma." Traditional, for mal legal, or charismatic authority are the three kinds of rec ognized power to which Max Weber continually refers. Any other exercise of power is based on the direct threat of the use of force against anyone who offers resistance. This theory of power is constructed without any reference to material structures. This does not mean that Weber neglects the material aspects of society; he merely does not regard them as determining factors. He therefore fails to see a third form for the exercise of power, which is perhaps even the most im portant, namely, the exercise of power on the basis of the im potence of others, mediated through material structures. I see the creation of such structures of power and impotence by materiel both as something that is sometimes experienced immediately, and as something that first requires a theoretical investigation to uncover. The jmain question then is: Under what material conditions is a social system possible in which relations of power and im potence have been abolished ? What tools and what relations between them will make the language of power superfluous or unimportant ? In which direction and how far must the material structure change for power and impotence to cease their roles as concepts in which we directly understand our place in so ciety ? Those who claim that there will always be someone who controls others, that there will always be ruler and ruled, always the power ful and the impotent, usually base their argument on human nature ? for example, man's "will to power." It would be a misunderstanding to meet this assertion with a counter-assertion that human nature is community or species-being [ Gattungswesen], as Feuerbach does. That would only lead to a hopeless exchange of words about whether man is good or evil, egoist or the contrary. Gen erally speaking, power relations are not based in an immutable human nature, but in the way the material structure is consti</page><page sequence="21">The Concept of Materiel 23 tuted, something which all will agree is subject to constant change, and to which it would be fruitless to set limits. "He who engages in politics, strives for power." This asser tion is from Max Weber, but it will no doubt strike a sympa thetic chord beyond the ranks of national-liberal thinking. What could be more self-evident that that politics is a struggle for power in society ? But this obviousness conceals important dif ferences between a kind of politics that aims at maintaining some form of society, and one that aims at changing it. A politics that aims at preserving the existing order is con cerned with power structures for their own sake. It would like to create the right power relations without changing material structures. This is a frequent characteristic of social liberal ism: it would like to see comfortable workplaces, it is against corruption in the state apparatus, the undermining of democracy, etc. Social-liberal politics goes in for expressions such as "recognizing one's responsibility"; it is always on its guard against abuses and corruption. Generally speaking, we could fairly say that it is an expression of a society that is incessantly concerned with "making an effort." Such concern is an impor tant part of morality (at least Protestant morality). Social lib erals are therefore dependent on morality, which continually furnishes them with their scruples. They know, for example, that it is one's duty to consider all members of society as equal, but they are continually failing in this respect, since the material structures are such that people are in fact not equal. In a society in which the material structure would from the out set ensure that all were equal, this duty would disappear of itself. There is another way to misunderstand material structures, one that leads to a kind of politics completely at variance with parliamentarism. Thus while parliamentarism stresses capi talist society's legitimate rules of the game, this kind of poli tics stresses, in contrast, capitalism's characteristic of vio lence. It claims that the ruling classes maintain themselves</page><page sequence="22">24 Essays by Dag (2teterberg by force. This sort of politics therefore tries to provoke the state to use violence in order to demonstrate that the legal system and parliamentarism are a deception. Demonstrations and disobe dience of the police are in this case a well-suited means to provoke a clubbing with a policeman's night stick, and arrests. But from a theoretical perspective, this strategy is wrong. It replaces one mistake with another: It replaces the view of a state based on law with the view of a state based on violence, a fascist state. In a correct strategy, violence first breaks out in the final phase, if at all. When a ruling class is forced to resort to violence, it is a sign that it is resting on a weak foot ing. But the feature that distinguishes provocation is that it provokes violence in an opponent prematurely in order to dem onstrate to the provocateurs that their opponent is on a weak footing, i.e., a weaker footing than he actually is. Such provo cation is self-deception. By concentrating attention so strongly on violence in society and on the violent side of politics, the main issue is driven into the background ? namely, that the abolition of capitalism is a question of adaptation to or change in material structures. This is made elegantly apparent in Marx and Engels. In their theo retical work, they describe especially the material structures in the society in which they lived, and the evolution of the struc tures. The working class's organized struggle was a continua tion of this development. The physical use of violence that they assume at the final phase of the final stage of the class struggle has no independent significance; it is a help to birth. Violence, power, and the material are three levels of society with differ ing effects. Violence is the most conspicuous, but the least important for a political understanding. 5. The Place of the Concept of Materiel in Economic Theory (A Working Hypothesis) A. The Difference between Social Structures and Material Structures If we take an ecclesiastical society, which is determined by</page><page sequence="23">The Concept of Materiel 25 its rituals, feast days, articles of faith, etc., and which observes that faith in special places, such as temples, burial grounds, etc., we could say that the rituals are part of the social struc ture, while the temples are a part of the material structure. The concept of "materiel" covers instruments in the broadest meaning of the term ? that is, not just tools but buildings, roads, and signs as well. An ecclesiastical society is a social institution, and every institution can be described as a totality of social structures. Material structures create the conditions for social structures. A religious society without churches cannot last over the long term. All social relations need to externalize and materialize themselves, that is, they need to become inscribed, so to speak, in the material surroundings. Conversely, all social relations take shape in a material environment that is structured before hand; every human being is born and grows up within a world of diverse material structures. With a mind to the argument that shall follow, let me eluci date the relationship between social structures and material structures by taking as an example a relationship such as trust. Every relation of trust is a social relation in the sociological sense. It consists in expectations between two or more persons, or more precisely, expectations that refer back to earlier ex pectations that had been fulfilled ? in other words, warranted expectations. Most relations of trust are between persons who are not in direct contact (face to face) with one another; the connection between them is mediated, and materiel is the mediating link. A bank connection is such a mediated connection. The extent to which trust exists between men, therefore, is dependent on how the material structures are constituted. For example, a hous ing subdivision of single-family dwellings is a condition more for the creation of mistrust than of trust, as compared with more collective forms of dwellings. If my neighbor and myself are hidden to each other's view, neither of us can know what the other is doing nor what we think of one another ? a situation that easily breeds mistrust. Or, a private home owner com</page><page sequence="24">26 Essays by Dag Qfeterberg plains that people are lonely, that each is inscrutable to his neighbor ? thus, a philosophy of solitide, which refers back to the impenetrable walls and isolation of the single-family dwell ing (Sartre). Solipsism as a philosophy cannot occur in just any kind of material structure. In the countryside people usually do not lock their doors, but in the city they almost always do ? a reflection of the fact that the material structures in the coun tryside generally create conditions for greater trust among men than do the material structures of a city. In fact, locks are themselves a form of materiel that engenders mistrust. To en counter a locked door is to be forced to entertain the proposi tion that one could be a thief oneself, that is, the lock points to thievery as a possibility. People cannot have trust in one an other in a world of locks, even if they wish to. A precondition for greater trust is that the locks be removed. It should now be easy to see that there are two ways to foster trust. One consists in acting directly on the social structure of trust. This may be done, for example, by assuring everyone that all are trusted, by participating in diverse activities to gether (as when De Gaulle and Adenauer sat together in the Rheims cathedral), or by behaving in a trustworthy manner. But as long as the material structures are unchanged, the estab lished relation of trust is marked by uncertainty, since it can quite easily cease at any time, social relations being quite changeable. The other way is to create material structures that engender the conditions for trust, that is, to generate trust by changing the material relations. This way is far surer since material work is required to change a material structure, which is not so volatile as a social structure. The first way requires, or presupposes, the least, and is there fore the easiest to carry through. On the other hand, it also gives the least in return. This way, clearly, is the way of reformism. B. A Hypothesis My working hypothesis is that a distinction between social</page><page sequence="25">The Concept of Materiel 27 structures and material structures can also be drawn with re gard to economic institutions; in other words, that there are economic social structures and economic material structures, and that it is important to know the material conditions for eco nomic social structures. To test this hypothesis, and to at tempt better to understand what it purports to show, let me here just take two examples of the kind of reasoning I have in mind from some theoretical arguments. In his book Critical Essays in Monetary Theory, John Hicks comments that "money is a human institution based on trust." I see this as a confirmation of my hypothesis, for the following reason: Hicks knows only that sort of sociology which defines an institution as a set of roles and norms, i.e., a social struc ture. That is, he leaves out the underlying material structures on which an institution is based, and which create the conditions for this trust. What this quote thus is saying is that money is a social structure of trust. It implies that there is an economic material structure that creates the conditions for this trust, and it is the task of economic theory to find out what that struc ture is. Of course, it may be that Hicks is wrong in saying that money is an institution based on trust. It might be more correct to say that money is a social structure based on mistrust, or on force. But whatever the case, we find that money is a social structure and not a material structure, so our hypothesis still holds. As another example, let me take Marx's distinction between productive and unproductive labor. To produce a use object is productive labor. To ship it to a person who will use it, for example, is nonproductive labor. All services are unproductive labor in Marx's theory. I see the connection between this dis tinction and the distinction between social structure and mate rial structure to lie in the following: Marx is concerned with revolution in social relations. In The German Ideology he has described how changes in material structures create conditions for changes in social structures. It is therefore important in his view for economic theory to draw a distinction between economic activities that change ma</page><page sequence="26">28 Essays by Dag Qfeterberg terial structures (for example, by producing new forms of ma teriel) and those that do not do so (for example, distribution of objects of use, care during illness, etc.). Some economic ac tivities that do not change the material structures (for example, administration and the organization of labor) would be part of the social structures within the economic institutions. The method best suited for them would be a hermeneutic method; and questions having to do with justice, democracy, equality, alienation, etc., will then be the most important ones. Econo metric and sociometric studies (which are nonhermeneutic) of these structures can be both possible and useful, and to a cer tain extent statistics could be an appropriate form for reflecting the manifold aspects of social relations. (See the first chapter of my Meta-sociological Essay for a more thorough-going dis cussion of this point.) But it is still a long way from here to a clearly defined science of social economic structures. On the other hand, one question that is amenable to scientific enquiry is, what material structures create the conditions for various forms of nonproductive work. For example, what economic ma terial structures create the conditions for a service society ? The distinction between productive and nonproductive labor is therefore, in a certain sense at least, a distinction between eco nomic activity within material structures and economic activity on the basis of material structures. C. The Implications of This Hypothesis for Economic Theory The part of an economic institution which comprises social structures or relations may be called the social economic part. The part made up of material structures can be called the ma terial economic part. Accordingly, we may distinguish between social economic theory and material economic theory. Keynes' theory is an example of social economics, in the sense that it focuses attention on money and on other social structures such as liquidity preferences, the propensity to con sume, etc. Further, Keynes aims at changing economic institu tions by changing the socioeconomic structures, and not the</page><page sequence="27">The Concept of Materiel 29 material economic structures. We earlier referred to this as the method of reformism, and Keynes is indeed a self-acknowl edged reformist. Of course, large portions of Marx's theory in Capital are a good example of material economics. (My reservations are in regard to his theory of value, which is perhaps, or perhaps not, more hermeneutic than scientific.) But in ethnography (so cial anthropology) too, there are many good examples of mate rial economic theory to be found. In the state administrative apparatus, of course, it is almost always socioeconomic solutions which are aimed for, not mate rial economic ones. After all, the state is the one institution that is ceaselessly involved in reforms to maintain the basic material structures creating the conditions for the existing so cial order. To study social economics, therefore, is a good ed ucation for a future state functionary, but not for someone who desires another social order, and hence other social structures. The study of economic theory shows therefore a certain theo retical distortion, which, moreover, may be observed in psy chology, in sociology, and in political science as well. 6. Max Weber and Materiality To introduce or emphasize a point of view or a concept in some branch of science, it is not enough to say that that point of view or concept is important, fruitful, or significant. One must also be able to say why it is so. This is especially true in sociology in its present confused, disintegrated state, where no theoretician can any longer pretend, either to himself or others, that each and every new insight or thought is a further contribution to the knowledge at hand that will make theory building at once richer and more unified. On the contrary, new contributions seem almost invariably to render sociology more motley and more unwieldy. I should like therefore to begin by asking why matter, things, tools, apparatuses, signs, and so on, have received such little attention within the dominant social theories. I reject from the</page><page sequence="28">30 Essays by Dag Qfcterberg outset any answer proposing that these theories have forgotten, or overlooked, etc., the role of materiality in social life. Great theorists forget or overlook little. On the other hand, they can be blind to many things because theoretical premises preclude their seeing them; indeed, in a certain sense we could say they have chosen not to see them. Why have they made such a choice ? That is the first question I should like to take up. Let's take Max Weber's system. It presumes a fundamental continuum between courses of events hallmarked by a totally goal-oriented rationality, that is, human behavior in the search for rational means to achieve clear-cut ends, and courses of events devoid of any trace of goal-oriented rationality, that is, pro cesses in lifeless nature. Between these two extremes ? goal oriented rational behavior and inorganic processes ? lies the domain of sociology, insofar as human behavior ranges, so to speak, over different levels or degrees of goal-oriented ra tionality. Weber of course attaches great importance to his premise that the different kinds of phenomena distinguished by this ty pology are all on equal footing as regards causality, that is, they can all in principle be explained causally; hence the number one requirement of all sociological explanations is that they have a "causal adequacy." However, the further human behavior gets from lifeless natural processes the more accessible it is to understanding, Verstehen, in addition to any causal explanation that may be advanced. We understand their "sense" or "mean ing" in terms of ends and means, and a causal explanation in sociology hence acquires an adequacy on the level of meaning. Thus, Weber rejects the Kantian and neo-Kantian distinction between explaining nature in causal terms and understanding men. He maintains that we explain nature causally without un derstanding it, while we both causally explain, and understand, human behavior. Now it is just this view of things which has met with little or no understanding in North American sociology. If the task of all science is to come up with causal explanations, and sociol ogy is a science, and if further, as Weber maintains, all human</page><page sequence="29">The Concept of Materiel 31 behavior, regardless of how rational it may or may not be with regard to its intended end, can be explained causally, then what is the purpose of maintaining that the prime task of sociology is to understand the meaning of human behavior ? It is for this reason that Talcott Parsons concludes in his book The Structure of Social Action that Weber should not have stopped halfway in freeing himself from neo-Kantianism, but should have gone the entire route and said that methodologically seen there is no difference between natural science and social science. Why did Weber not go this far? One possible answer is that for Weber it was the highest of duties to be conscious of the premises and consequences of one's actions, to have reflected thoroughly on oneself and one's situation. He conceives sociology's task or calling in the same way, and, further, sees world history as a process of unceasing evolution toward more and more pronouncedly goal-rational institutions and patterns of action, toward an increased under standing of premises and consequences. As bureaucracy grows, the world loses its magical features: "Rationalisierung der Welt, Entzauberung der Welt." Just as Marx's theory of class struggle is aimed at promoting that struggle to its final resolution, Weber's typology of differ ent degrees of understandable behavior aims at increasing com prehensibility and promoting a process of rationalization al ready in progress. By taking the view that all forms of behavior are of equiva lent status as far as sociology's prime task ? causal explana tion ? is concerned, one will neither promote nor contribute to increasing the rationality in, and the extent of reflection about, social life and history. But it is not a matter of indifference to all, and that includes sociologists, whether men are rational and self-aware, or not. Thus, the question of whether sociology should rest content with being causally adequate or should also be adequate on the level of meaning, can be given a further spe cification as one of Weber's renowned choices between values or Weltanschauungen ? a choice about which Weber for his part was never in doubt.</page><page sequence="30">32 Essays by Dag Qteterberg What role, then, is materiality to play in this line of reason ing? Let us assume the following objection to Weber's system: There are material objects that behave in the same way as hu man beings, replace human beings, and in some cases repress them. Might it not then be answered: "True enough; but what we are concerned with is to what extent men are rational and reflecting persons. It neither adds nor takes away one bit whether the material world of things around men resembles them to some greater or lesser degree." However, it is obvious at once that such an answer is wrong. Just as matter is shaped by men in consonance with rational ends (in Weber's meaning of "rational"), man is also affected from without by his own rationality: instruments and machines speak their silent language to their creators. It is not just that the veil of religious belief, mysticism, and magic has been lifted from the world in which man lives: that world itself has become less religious, mystical, and magical. A waterfall is more sublime, more enchanting, more inscrutable than the power plant built to tame it. But once there is a power plant, the river sprite disappears ? not only from the waterfall that has been tamed, but also from all those that are still free. Which is to say that even in terms of what I assumed to be Weber's prob lematic, a "sociology of understanding (Verstehen)" should be interested in rounding out the typology of various levels of meaningful behavior to include material processes and objects, which are themselves to varying degree meaningful; then such a sociology would be able to shed some light on the "Rationali zierung und Entzauberung der Welt." We must thus once again ask why Max Weber did not give ma teriality any sociological status. Indeed, it seems that it was something he did not see but which he should have seen on the basis of his own premises. One possible answer, which I give because in any event it clarifies my own position, is that Weber, after all, still lives and breathes within the Kantian tradition ? i.e., Kant with his distinction between the realm of nature and the realm of free dom, and his teaching that man is a creature of duty and an end</page><page sequence="31">The Concept of Materiel 33 in himself, that man's duty is to treat all other men as ends in themselves, and that it is a duty to act as a creature of duty and not to slide into a purely physical existence where men are ruled by nature's laws. Within Kant's horizon, man conquers and tames nature, masters it, and forces it to reveal its se crets. But on his fellow human beings, man imposes duties. Indeed, Weber too imposes duties on his fellow humans and on himself; he merely expands or concretizes the duty to be a creature of reason. Further, he is also concerned, almost des perately so, and to an unbelievable degree, with the fact that men rule over and dominate one another. But just as Kant's morality of duty lives on in Weber as an ethics of responsibility, Weber is uninterested in materiality since the notion of duty is alien to matter ? things have no responsibility. This line of reasoning thus leads to the following assumption: A sociological or metasociological approach which has man's duties and relations of responsibility as its main concern is easily diverted from materiality as an object of enquiry. Thoughts on duty and responsibility belong in the camp of philo sophical idealism, and it is our position that this form of ideal ism is prone to overlooking materiality, material things. On the other hand, it can be shown that D?rkheim was con cerned with materiality, and at the same time was urgently con cerned with social change. I propose that if one is concerned with social change, materiality tends to become the focal point of one's attention, something which it was not for Max Weber. 7. An Approach to the Concept of Materiel: From Knowledge of the Particular to Knowledge of the Anonymous There are at least two major conceptions of what knowledge is. The first holds that he who knows has knowledge of some thing that is other than he himself ? in other words, that knowl edge is an external relation between the knower and the known. The classical illustration of this relation is the experimental researcher and his experimental system, such as we learn</page><page sequence="32">34 Essays by Dag Qfsterberg about early in our school careers. The scientist is spatially situated outside his system, whence he observes it, or he intro duces new elements into the system all the while as he stands outside of it. By extending the limits of the system further and further, without however at the same time coming to include himself in it, he acquires broader and broader knowledge of the world as his environment, as something different from himself, upon which, if he wishes, he may act to realize his own goals. In this case, knowledge about the world is a means to satisfy the needs, wishes, and goals of the scientist. The other concept of knowledge holds that what the knower knows is himself ? i.e., that all knowledge is self-knowledge. In other words, there exists an internal relation between the knower and the known. The classical ? or more accurately, the romantic ? illustration of this relation is perhaps the nat ural mystic, who recognizes himself in all of nature's mani festations, and sees nature in his own soul. The task of cogni tion in this case is not to isolate experimental systems in na ture to be investigated from some point outside them. Quite the contrary, the goal is to immerse oneself in nature, to be come absorbed in it, become one with it ? which is identical with immersion into and regaining of oneself. The argument here is that an individual and his environment are a unity that has been rent asunder but which can be brought together and made whole again, and that the way to achieve this is not through research in the definition given earlier on, but through the transformation or unfolding of oneself. Knowledge in this case is not a means to satisfy one's independently existing needs and goals; it is a goal in itself, because the relation of knowledge is a relation of love ? love of nature. The romantic concept of knowledge leads to the notion of a god immanent in nature, with which one strives to rejoin through self-knowledge. As we have said, this is the classical illustration of knowledge as an internal relation between the knower and known ? at least in its more recent form. But it is not the only example. Artis tic activity is another. It has been said a thousand times: The artist, as a type, has an inspiration, an idea, an insight to which</page><page sequence="33">The Concept of Materiel 35 he gives shape, and which reshapes his original intentions as he proceeds. When the work is finished, it represents the truth about that particular insight, idea, or inspiration. To the ex tent that the artist has immersed himself in this formative ac tivity, he will be able to see the truth about himself in the work he has produced ? or at least the truth about himself as it was while the activity was in progress. Artistic activity is a reve lation, a self-revelation, self-knowledge. Thus, artistic activity is another example of knowledge as an internal relation between the knower and the known. In the process of shaping his envi ronment, a person discovers the truth about himself, or to put it better, creates a truth about himself. Truth in this case is something that comes into being, just as a human being comes into being: this becoming is an internal relation between the activity and its product. A third example of knowledge as self-knowledge is a distorted version of the first: the ironic person and the hyper-reflective person. The former has given up arriving at self-knowledge and love: it is a Sisiphyean task, the self is elusive, it is in ceaseless transformation without end. His answer is irony (Kierkegaard). The hyper-reflective person has had the same experience, and his answer is despair (Sartre, Being and Noth ingness). Each of these two examples may be brought more down to earth, but let me concentrate on the latter. First, almost no one is an artist, and no artist is an artist all the time, or im mersed in his own work all the time. However, the artist was merely an example to illustrate a particular conception of knowl edge: he is not identical with the concept of knowledge as self knowledge. Let us suppose that the great artist goes down to the dairy store to buy a bit of butter. The purchase will also be a realization of an intention, even if it was not an act of cre ation. We may then ask: Is not the butter on the table also the truth about the artist, since he did have this intention to pur chase it ? And was not this purchase also a revelation about himself, an act of self-discovery and hence of self-knowledge ? A negative answer is patent: "But I didn't make this package</page><page sequence="34">36 Essays by Dag Qfsterberg of butter, so it doesn't tell anything more about me, but about other persons. Furthermore, buying butter is a very common act done by literally countless persons every single day. So the act says nothing about me either, i.e., nothing special about me. Artistic activity is something different. Then I reveal my self, I create my work and myself with one and the same activity." But in a sense this objection confirms the argument: The great artist is also an ordinary human being, just like the oth ers, and carries out anonymous acts; and to that extent his but ter purchase at the dairy store is a truth about himself. To what extent he wishes to consider himself as being that part of himself which is unique, or to include what is like others as part of himself as well, is his affair. For our part, we may formulate the concept of the generally human, that which is common to all men, and say that all common acts and their ef fects bring out or reveal the truth about the generally human. We could then replace the example of the great romantic artist with the common act, and say that the latter is an example of the in ternal relation between the knower and the known. We would then immediately see the link between a "sociology of understanding" and its conceptual system: action, joint action, expectations with regard to the actions of others, others' expectations with regard to one's own actions ? all these are covered by the no tion of the generally human. We could then see the Verstehen sociology as an attempt to express our knowledge of ourselves as common men ? knowledge as knowledge of our most ordinary and general selves, as an internal relation between ordinary people and their common humanity. (We could then say that the goal of sociology of understanding is to unfold and reveal Hegel's objective spirit.) The last link in this argument is the following: If we first accept that the artist creates and comes to know his own unique ness through his artistic activity, and if we then broaden this viewpoint to include all activity, and say that ordinary persons create and come to know their own common humanity through their actions, we can then say that all the effects of actions surrounding us and shaping our environment are the truth about</page><page sequence="35">The Concept of Materiel 37 ourselves, even when we ourselves have not had a direct hand in this, because we are both particular and general, ourselves and another in ourselves ? and indeed, what is more, because we are both alien and hostile to ourselves, and are surrounded by the alien and hostile effects of others' actions. To put it briefly, if we say that an artist's relation to his work is a relation of self-knowledge as an internal relation, we can go one step further and say that our relation to all the fruits of human activity is self-knowledge in the same sense, but in another mode: Depending on the type of product with which we are dealing, this internal relation of self-knowledge can be a knowledge of ourselves insofar as we are general, i.e., alien and hostile toward ourselves. Thus, he who will know himself must look around in the world about him and learn to know the products of human activity he finds there. These products ? or some of them ? are what are called "materiel" in the broad sense. If one understands romanticism's illustra tions of knowledge as self-knowledge, one should be able to go further to find another example for the same con cept of knowledge, the same form of understanding; namely, generally human acts and their effects ? anonymous prod ucts, "materiel." 8. The Concept of Materiel: A Definition and Three Applications 1. Definition In introducing the concept of society's material structure it may be useful to begin with Husserl's concept of "Lebenswelt" or life-world ? the world as we immediately experience it through our activity. Our life-world is not the world of abstract physics of inert masses, electrical fields, etc. Rather, it is a world of material signs, which refer to our own body's place in the world, and the possibility of our activity in it. We en counter a signless world only in extreme cases: when we do,</page><page sequence="36">38 Essays by Dag (2teterberg the effect is not our experiencing the possibilities of our action as boundlessly many, but on the contrary, a paralyzation of our activity, a destruction or dissolution of our life-world as a field with direction. Untouched matter, "nature," is signifying in itself: If ice is thick, it is safe to walk on it. If a crevasse is deep, caution is in order. A changing landscape points up changes in the behav ior of anyone traveling in it, so that a nature life also takes place in a life-world of signs. All the more so is this true for material that is marked by activity. In its simplest form, activity leaves traces behind it, and traces are signs. Trails are like signs that show in which way the way went. The chief form of activity, however, is ma terial labor ? work to satisfy bodily needs with the aid of na ture. Except for gathering wild berries and similar extreme cases, any kind of work makes use of worked-over matter in the form of the tools of labor. Indeed, an increasing proportion of work as we know it today is devoted to the production of the tools of labor. Another portion is devoted to the construc tion of highway networks, a sign system, and protection against nature, which it is not completely accurate to call the tools of labor, even though they are part of the context of tools. What is needed here is a more general designation, my suggestion being the term "materiel." We can then say that our life-world is a world of signs, and more precisely, mainly a world of mate riel. Buildings of all sorts, from universities to housing units, are materiel. The means of communication, from our highway network to the postal system, are materiel, as are the electric system and machines in the factory, and newspapers, books, tables and chairs. Our relation to matter is principally a relation to society's mate riel. This materiel is not spred around us at random in society. It shapes contexts that refer back to the relevant activity of materiel labor, and these contexts I shall call "material structures." 2. Materiel and the Form of Society In Marx's book The Poverty of Philosophy we find the famous</page><page sequence="37">The Concept of Materiel 39 aphorism that the hand mill gives rise to a society with feudal lords, and the steam mill to a society with industrial capitalists. As trenchant as this aphorism is, it is not easy to interpret. Historically seen, it is even wrong, since mills existed long, long before the feudal system took form in Western Europe in about the eighth century, after the invasions from the East had subsided. But it would be beside the point to insist on this. The aphorism is meant to illustrate a very general point, and for my part I assume that the point is to play with the concept of, or to understand, the anachronistic. There is something a bit comical and thus, in a certain sense, impossible about the thought of feudal society with steam en gines. The point is, the invention and development of the steam engine were the product of a cultural environment fundamentally different from that of feudal times, i.e., the eighth through thirteenth centuries. By the sixteenth and seventeenth centu ries, the logical structure of the sciences had become some thing quite different from what it had been in feudal times. The Aristotelian anthropomorphic concept of nature had given way to Galileo's abstract nature governed by the principle of inertia. The idea of the steam engine's being invented in feudal times, when men were so different from the men of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, is an anachronism in thought. Obvi ously it was not just science that differed in the two historical epochs: the entire civilization was different, the reason being that among other things the material conditions under which men lived were different. So, at the very least, the aphorism suggests that it would have been impossible for men of feudal times to invent the steam en gine, and for steam-driven industry to develop under feudal conditions, with feudal lords, sworn vassals, and serfs. It seems clear to us that if the steam engine, by some impossi bility, had been introduced into feudal Europe, it would of ne cessity have thereby given rise to such profound changes in a thousand and one different ways that the feudal system and its way of looking at things would have been rent apart. The kind of impossibility of which the concept of the anach</page><page sequence="38">40 Essays by Dag Qteterberg ronistic is here the expression is a logical impossibility, pecu liar to the social sciences and historical knowledge. It implies that human knowledge has its material limitations (the mate rial situation places limits on thought, and sets the conditions for what thoughts are possible), in contrast to philosophical idealism, which acknowledges only those limits that thought sets for itself, and does not admit of anything else than thought set ting limits on thought. Marx's aphorism adumbrates a tran scendental materialism (Ricoeur's term referring to Levi Strauss), as contrasted to transcendental idealism, and it is this variant of materialism which serves as a principle for the development of a sociology of knowledge. The limits alluded to by the aphorism are set by the material relations of production and forces of production. However, the gist of the matter may be easily generalized ? and indeed has been. It is common knowledge that our science Mis closely con nected withn the apparatus, i.e., the material structures used in research. If, again by some impossibility, we were to think away all scientific instruments, laboratories, etc., the insights of science would become incomprehensible. We can even carry our generalization a step further from our materially conditioned abilities to understand and our knowl edge, to our needs and relations with other human beings. Our needs change and develop as material conditions change, not merely as a function of economic conditions but also of the products engendered by production; they are different at differ ent stages of history. It is the automobile, the movie theater, and the phonograph ? and not just power stations, railroads, the huge factories of heavy and light industry, and the finance system ? which shape and mediate relations among men and social needs. The upshot of all this is that a more general study of the ma terial environment in which social relations are set and within which they unfold is in order. This material environment bears above all the mark of man's work, left as unintended traces ? from paths in the woods to chemically polluted streams; as in tended signs ? signposts, references, and books; as tools, ma</page><page sequence="39">The Concept of Materiel 41 chines, instruments; as weapons of all kinds; as means of trans port and communication; or as buildings ? houses, workshops, churches, and schools. We use the word "materiel" here in the broadest sense as a common name for all these things. Thus, taking our cue from Marx's aphorism, we can work out an out line for a general typology of materiel as a condition for under standing social and cultural change. As an example of what we mean, Lewis Mumford's analysis of a clock in his Technics and Civilization is useful. As clocks gradually came into use, time changed form. The desire for order, regularity, and punctuality first arose in the monasteries when fixed times were set for prayer, etc. The Benedictine monks contributed a great deal toward giving human activity the regular and collective rhythm that characterises the machine, for, as he says: "The clock is a means not merely for passing time, but also for synchronizing human actions." The original idea in creating and using clocks may have been something quite different ? namely, to look out for the soul's safe passage by regular prayer times. In any event, the result was that clocks transformed man's activities and life rhythms. Mumford says: "The clock, not the steam engine, is the machine which provides the key to the modern industrial age." Further, the clock helps to free time from what happens to human beings, to human life, and has helped to fashion the belief in an inde pendent world of mathematically measured magnitudes ? the world of science. Clocks and their various types change social relations. 3. The Concept of Materiel and the Theory of Class Struggle Let us now consider class struggle, interpreted as a con tradiction between individualist and collectivist tendencies. I assume that the parties in the struggle are the class of capital owners on the one hand and the class of wage laborers on the other. The class of capital owners has an interest in an indi vidualistic, dispersed mode of production, as reflected in slo gans such as individual freedom, private initiative, the individ</page><page sequence="40">42 Essays by Dag Qfsterberg ual man, etc. It is in the interest of the class of wage laborers to collectivize the mode of production, and thereby to inaugurate a new historical epoch determining qualitatively new relations between men. In struggles among men (disregarding Gandhiism) both parties should be as numerous as possible or as strongly armed as possible, or both. In hand-to-hand combat it is physical strength and weapons which count, but normally the class strug gle does not take this form except in acute cases. The class struggle is a form of struggle in which all forms of traces, signs, and materiel are at play. The class struggle is played out with, and in part even between, different kinds of materiel. For emphasis, it is tempting to say that the classes do not con sist merely of men, but also of materiel; or, if that seems too farfetched, to say that to understand relations between classes and their relations of forces, we must not just know these rela tions of forces in purely numerical terms, we must also know the quanta of materiel mediating between the classes. Among the gainfully employed population the class of wage laborers has been estimated at 80 percent here in Norway. Neverthe less, it evidently has not been able to implement its collectivist interests at will. Certain features of the material structure offer resistance, the nature of which should become clearer on examination. To what extent, it may be asked, does the class of wage laborers have materiel and its placement "against it," and to what extent "with it"? To what extent has society's ma teriality itself a collective cast, and to what extent not? A few random examples both for and against should help to elucidate this question. The existence of a market, in the technical economic def inition, is perhaps the clearest example of a material structure that prevents men from getting together, and produces impo tence. In a perfect market in the technical sense, everyone attempts to underbid or overbid everyone else, so that each feels impo tent in the face of the very existence of the others, who force him to reduce his demands or raise his offer: on the market,</page><page sequence="41">The Concept of Materiel 43 no one rules yet all are tyrannized. For example, on the free housing market no one is himself greedy, a real estate shark, or in conflict with the law; it is others who are already so and force everyone else to be that way, and so on. The market is divisive almost by definition. On the other hand, a market economy tends through its own inner logic and the class struggle toward a less perfect mar ket, via the creation of monopolies, oligopolies, cartels, etc. Marx shows on a number of occasions how a market economy tends against its own interests toward the collectiviza tion of the means of production even as the concentration of capital grows. Huge factories, where hundreds and thousands of workers do their jobs collectively, are themselves a collec tivizing factor. At the same time the legal relations make for individualistic and antagonistic relations of production, so that "a portion of the means of labor," i.e., materiel, acquires a collective character for labor itself. Private capitalism par tially abolishes itself and the petty private property on which it is founded. In vol. Ill of Capital Marx says: The isolated workers are united together in large factories to particular jobs that mesh with one another. The tool becomes the machine. This mode of production permits no longer the splitting up of the instruments of produc tion that is characteristic of small property, just as little as it allows isola tion of the workers themselves.9 Thus, when large production units are first introduced into pro duction, the small ones are forced to give up competition, lead ing to a less perfect market. 4. Materiel and Individuality In his Philosophy of Right, Hegel poses a material precondi tion for ego (and its concept) to emerge: private property must exist for its owner's use as a means to realize his abstract self. Further, Hegel shows how the exchange relation is a pre condition for being able to recognize oneself in others and vice versa, i.e., how the exchange relation universalizes men.</page><page sequence="42">44 Essays by Dag 0sterberg I take this to be generally correct, so that MarxTs derisive treatment of this argument111 for once redounds back on him self. Liberalism gives a wrong portrayal of reality. I refer not only to the fact that only a minority within bourgeois society own any thing at all; the very description by liberalism of what it means to be a Mburgher,M an owner of property, leaves out something important. Coercion, frustration, and violence (hardhanded ness in general) plague the bourgeoisie from the ranks of the dis possessed, the crowd, the masses, because they must be kept down: discipline must be maintained. Criminals, agitators, criminal agitators ? these elements are the spokesmen for that segment of bourgeois society outside the confines of the bour geoisie's cultured existence. It is valid then to ask whether a perfect bourgeois society ? i.e., a society with the right of property, thus a society where all own the means of production ? is possible at all. The idea of a society of shareholders is intended as an answer to this question. In such a society, it is claimed, there would be no repression, and the bourgeois existence Hegel describes would become a reality. Life would unfold without frustration through work, exchange, mediation, the universalization of the private individual, etc. In his discussion of the concept of interest in sociology, Sartre describes the difference between the owner of a factory and a worker in the factory; The factory is the owner's inter est, but the worker's fate. The worker must have something from which to live, but it is not his interest to work. The dif ference between interests and needs is not mere quibbling: it is meant to call attention to the fact that the field of interest is a special level of existence. As I interpret it, the fact that the owner cares about his factory (works 24 hours a day, etc.) is indeed an indissoluble part of owning; concern is a part of the owner's individuality. The worker is not concerned about the factory; when he leaves the factory grounds he is free, he has more or less idle free time at his disposal. He is not respon sible. That is an important part of being a worker, and is one</page><page sequence="43">The Concept of Materiel 45 of the reasons, indeed perhaps the main reason, that the worker lacks the kind of individuality of the bourgeois. But what would be the form of individuality in a shareholders' society? It's hard for me to see that the dividend on shares could be anything more than a bonus, and thus basically an un important extra tacked onto the wage itself. A worker with shares is not so different from other workers without shares. Thus, individuality has, metaphorically speaking, two dimen sions. First, it indicates a relation to a material object (a fac tory, a book, etc.): it is by owning specific things that one be comes a specific person. Second, it indicates a relation to others: it is only through having responsibility for such an ob ject that one becomes an individual. If this responsibility is divided, one's relation to the object perforce undergoes a trans formation, and conversely, if a change occurs in the object, a change also occurs in one's relation of responsibility to others. Under monopoly capitalism, responsibility is not divided among many; rather, it has become the affair of relatively few. The remainder have been rendered impotent and divested of responsibility ? hence people's oft-lamented lack of political interest. Monopoly capital with its legion of shareholders does not create a society with collective responsibility, and this is obviously what Hegel's "moral totality" would be able to bring about if material accrued to it. The material condition for col lective responsibility would seem at least to be an extended di vision of labor, if Durkheim's demonstration (in his book The Division of Labor in Society) that in a society without division of labor there is no individuality is correct. Thus, for a society with collective responsibility, material structures are required wherein relatively few people share various particular tasks. Then the individual will both have responsibility and share it with others. (1967-1970) 1. See his essay in Ord och Bild, (Stockholm), 1967.</page><page sequence="44">46 Essays by Dag 0sterberg 2.
