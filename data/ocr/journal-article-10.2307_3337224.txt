For obvious reasons the museum has always given pride of place to its unique collection of Irish antiquities. Non-Irish collections, particularly those loosely dubbed "ethnographic," have tended to be eclipsed. So much so, indeed, that in the late 1970s pressure for space led to the closure of the gallery where artifacts from the Pacific, the Americas, and Africa were displayed. Since then those collections have been in storage out of sight of the general public (although from time to time objects have been lent to special exhibitions).1 They are not described in any museum publi- cation. One suspects that few foreign or Irish visitors to the museum today are aware that it holds any material from those regions, much less that it possesses one of the finest collections of that kind in the world. The National Museum was originally the Dublin Science and Art Museum, which came into existence with the Dub- lin Science and Art Museum Act of 1877. It has a Natural History Division, based in the Natural History Museum in Mer- rion Street, and three other divisions- Art and Industry, Folklife, and Irish Antiquities (the latter responsible for archaeology and ethnography)-located in the main museum building in Kildare Street beside the Dail, the Irish Parlia- ment. The earliest accession registers date from the late 1870s. However, much of the material in its collections is older, since at its foundation the museum took over nat- ural history, antiquarian, and ethno- graphic collections, in some cases dating back to the eighteenth century, of long- established institutions such as the Royal Dublin Society, Trinity College in Dublin, and the Royal Irish Academy. Trinity College, for example, acquired a substan- tial number of eighteenth-century Pacific artifacts from two people who had sailed with Cook on his voyages; and these were ,o .o. 8 c -1- v O r- m m Page 34: 1.

This continuity of the museum's col- lections with collections begun in the eighteenth century is one of its main points of interest. Whereas the great majority of national and civic museums in Europe and America only came into existence in the second half of the nine- teenth century, the Dublin museum is unusual in that a significant proportion of its Pacific, American, and African arti- facts were acquired in the eighteenth century or in the first half of the nine- teenth. Even the later accessions are from the early colonial period between 1880 and the 1920s. This gives the collections a historical importance out of all relation to their numbers. In terms of numbers, for example, the sub-Saharan African collection is quite modest, between three thousand and four thousand objects. Of these roughly one third are from Ghana. Other coun- tries well represented are the former British colonies of Sierra Leone, Nigeria (the latter unevenly), and South Africa. East Africa fares less well by compari- son. Of non-British territories, there are interesting small collections from Zaire, Madagascar, and Ethiopia, and scattered objects commemorate British military involvement in various parts of Africa (the Abyssinia campaign of 1868, the bat- 4.

With the exception of the former French Guinea, which is the source of most of the O'Beirne Collection (see below), and the Bondoukou district of C6te d'Ivoire, there are few objects from former French or Portuguese colonial territories, nor is there much of signifi- cance from Liberia and Cameroon. For much of the period in question, Ireland was an integral part of the United Kingdom, and Irish involvement with Africa was part of Britain's larger involvement with the continent. In the early years the donors of artifacts tended to be individuals attached to the British settlements on the West African coast (Sierra Leone, the Gold Coast) or Royal Navy officers engaged in putting down the slave trade. After the 1850s, as Britain became a colonial power, the donors were increasingly consular officials, sol- diers, medical personnel, and missionar- ies. By the 1900s colonial administrators and officers predominated. Almost with- out exception they came from the Protestant landed and professional class- es-the most Anglophile, and indeed Anglified, section of the population. The earliest African object in the National Museum is a side-blown ivory oliphant from southeastern Nigeria (Fig. 3). It has a lizard or crocodile carved in low relief along the outer curve of the tusk and a similar creature on either side, with two parallel bands of zigzag orna- ment near the open end.

Some were already in European collections in the mid-seventeenth centu- ry, and one recently rediscovered in the British Museum bears an English inscription, almost certainly added after its arrival in Europe, with the date 1599. Thus the Dublin oliphant seems likely to have been carved at the latest in the decades immediately before or after 1600. It was formerly in a collection of antiquities belonging to Henry Richard Dawson, Dean of St. Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin, which the Royal Irish Academy purchased from his widow in 1842. 0 4 0 0 0 c m o -n I m z r- c m c K nn z 0 african arts * spring 1995 37</page><page sequence="5">u4 "f~a4i~s~_-_ I ,, - i?:-~:l:- ;------?'::_:, -:-;- -r- -_;:--i. ::-: ii ;_::::, ::::_.: ?-7-4:~e:B~~~-:?: -s:3i~ :;:::I : :i :: $ :--1 r: : _!: -:il-:~:::: : 1:- -rr-i-::lr:--: _- I:::: i: i~:-.-'-::~ii:: _~-i-l~~::l-: I r:- -:~~:-- -I~~;---:sc: ~::;;;~-::: : :?:? :: c~ai~i~ '. :-: -:--:._-::::: :, _</page><page sequence="6">0 z 5 w Ta &lt; I o LL 0 w I- T nn 0r CL Opposite page: 7.

Apart from the Dawson oliphant, the earliest African artifacts in Dublin which we can positively identify today are a collection of "African ethnological and zoological curiosities" sent to the Royal Dublin Society in 1824 from Sierra Leone by an army medical officer, Brian O'Beirne. This is historically a very impor- tant collection, though not particularly large: it runs to 46 numbered items, of which 31 are artifacts.

The only comparable collection is that which T.E. Bowdich made in Asante in 1817-18 and presented to the British Museum (MacLeod 1977). O'Beirne's collection consists mainly of objects from the Muslim states inland from Sierra Leone in what is now the Republic of Guinea, plus a few items said to be from farther afield (Segu, Timbuktu). Considering its origins the collection is surprisingly homogeneous. It contains, of course, no examples of figurative art. It consists mainly of weapons: several quivers of arrows, a spear, an assortment of knives or daggers, powder horns, and a gun cover. In addition there are articles of dress and personal possessions: straw hats, sandals, a leather wallet, two combs (Fig. 4), snuffboxes (Fig. 5), a spoon, and an ink bottle. Among the larger items are a leather saddle and horse trappings, and a kora, the great harp of the praise-singers (jelis) of West Africa. Taken together they illustrate very well the cosmopolitan cul- ture of the Muslim elites of the Western Sudan in the first quarter of the nine- teenth century. We can speculate about the circum- stances in which the collection was made.

Since the largest group of objects in the collection are those labeled as being from "Footah Jalloo," with the remainder being attributed to peoples with whom the Fulas had diplomatic or trading relations, it is natural to suppose that they were collected on that occasion or that they were gifts from Fula and "Mandingo" dignitaries who accompa- nied O'Beirne on his return to Freetown (O'Beirne [1821] in Mouser 1979). The museum acquired from the Royal Dublin Society a small wooden figure, 14.5 centimeters tall (Fig. 6), which, it seems likely, is one of three "idols from Congo" given to the Society by Captain John Adams, who was engaged in the Royal Navy's antislavery patrols along the west coast of Africa. If so, it dates from 1842 and must be among the earli- est carvings from that area to have sur- vived. The figure is of indeterminate sex, legs bent at the knee and hands together on the chest, its head tilted back, with "coffee-bean" eyes and a peaked hair- style or cap. Its companions cannot now be traced.2 Another donor in the 1840s was Richard Robert Madden, a fiery Irish abolitionist who crops up as a footnote in the history of both America and Africa. In 1840, while judge arbitrator in the mixed court of commission in Havana, he was a key defense witness in the famous Amistad trial (in which a group of African slaves, who had escaped from Cuba by seizing control of a ship and sailing it to the United States, successful- ly contested in that country's courts the claim of the ship's owners to have them returned to slavery). The following year he was appointed Special Commissioner to inquire into the administration of British settlements in West Africa. He wrote a highly critical report accusing the authorities there of tolerating slavery under the guise of the so-called pawn system (Madden 1842). Madden's con- tacts with Africa were limited to a few weeks at the coastal settlements, but he nevertheless brought back some exam- ples of local metalwork, mainly spear- heads and bracelets, which he presented to the Royal Irish Academy and which later passed to the National Museum. The most distinctive object collected was a tiny brass head or mask, probably Akan from the Gold Coast (Fig. 10). Top: 10. Head. Akan, Ghana. Brass, height 3.9cm (1.5").

From Trinity College in Dublin came an extraordinary lidded agere ifa bowl for holding the palm nuts used in Ifa divina- tion (Fig. 1). It may well be unique in combining the carved latticework found on certain bowls with the figure carvings found on others. It shows a figure with an animal-probably a worshiper with a victim for sacrifice-inside a cage of lat- ticework and, outside it, four kneeling female figures, of which three remain, slotted into the rim of the base. What is remarkable about the bowl, if we exclude the lid and the figures on the outside, is that it appears to have been carved from a single piece of wood: a feat of virtuosity in carving which is extremely unusual in African art. The circumstances of its acquisition are recorded on an old label inside the bowl: "Fetish taken out of a house of a superi- or description at Lagos on the 29th Dec 1851. Three small guns loaded with lan- grage [i.e., shot made from irregular pieces of metal] were pointed at the entrance ready to receive us, had we landed a day earlier." The label is signed "R. Coote"--Commander R. Coote, R.N., of the Bight of Benin squadron, who gave the piece to Trinity College. The date and location identify the bowl as one of the spoils of the British naval attack on Lagos in late December 1851, which was designed to expel slave traders from the town and restore its deposed king, Akitoye, to power. The town was eventually abandoned by its defenders overnight on December 28 and occupied without resistance the fol- lowing day. Coote led a small party ashore on the 29th to spike or remove the town's guns. An eyewitness on his ship noted at the time that "many curiosities have been brought on board" (Church Missionary Intelligencer 1852:60-61), and the bowl in Dublin was presumably one of these. This is one of the few Yoruba pieces in the collection, but they include other early sculptures. A carved dance staff (Fig. 2), described in the register as an "African emblem," is probably the "Afri- can symbol" given to the Royal Dublin Society in 1854 by Captain W.E. Stanley. The long curving cap of the kneeling fig- ure on top links it to the cult of Eshu, the Yoruba trickster god. What appears to be a gun that the figure is holding to its chin may be a flute or whistle, another attribute of Eshu.3 The museum possess- es in addition some pieces of Nupe cloth, "native ornaments from the camp at Ketsa above Rabba," and household items "from Yoruba," which were given to the Royal Dublin Society in 1859 by Francis Davis, who was medical officer on the 1857-59 Niger expedition. The expedition's steamer, the Dayspring, foundered on rocks at Rabba on the Benue River in October 1857 and had to be abandoned. The members of the expe- dition encamped nearby and were hos- pitably received by the local people while they awaited the arrival of a replacement vessel. However, Davis, who was not enjoying good health, left for the coast in May 1858, traveling overland with three companions through the Yoruba towns of Ilorin, Oyo, and Abeokuta to Lagos. The cloth and ornaments were therefore most likely collected by him on the Benue River; the Yoruba items on his cross- country trek to the sea (Church Missionary Gleaner 1859:6-7).4 african arts * spring 1995 41</page><page sequence="9">PHOTO COURTESY OF THE NATIONAL MUSEUM OF IRELAND Some of the earliest African material in the museum came from South Africa to the Royal Dublin Society in the 1820s, but it has not yet proved possible to iden- tify the specific items with certainty in the existing collections; unfortunately, one easily recognizable object, a "leather model of the Hottentot Venus" given to the Society in 1828, became infested and had to be destroyed.5 The range of objects from Southern Africa is typical of the region, consisting mainly of weapons, small household items such as snuffbox- es and spoons, and articles of dress and personal adornment. But two donations can be singled out, associated with the 14. Harp. Azande, Sudan(?). Wood, length 86.4cm (34"). Donor unknown.

The first is a decorated staff said to have been carved by the Xhosa chief Maqoma when he was a prisoner-one of the first of a long line of such political detainees-on Robben Island in the early 1870s. The second consists of fine dresses of animal hide and fur which, according to the donor, Major Hugh McCalmont, were taken from the Zulu and Pedi kings Cetshwayo and Sekhukhune at their capture in the war of 1879 (Fig. 11). (McCalmont was aide-de-camp to the British commander in chief Sir Garnet Wolseley.) Another object which may well have a similar pedigree is an unusu- 15. Sowei mask.

The extraordinary representation of a figure embedded in (or flattened by?) the heavy head of the knobkerrie recalls a host of images from cartoons and comic strips, but it is, of course, unlikely that humor-except of the most sardonic kind-was what its maker had in mind. Around the time when the National Museum was being set up (as the Dublin Science and Art Museum) in the late 1870s, there were two further acquisi- tions from southeastern Nigeria. The first was an object shaped somewhat like a two-headed table-tennis bat, described as a "dance ornament" (Fig. 7). There is a similar article in the Museum of Mankind (1954 Af23 859), but the Dublin example is more elaborate, having a human face carved in high relief on the flat surfaces, surrounded by tufts of red, yellow, and blue cotton threaded through holes in the wood. It was given to the museum by a Captain A.P. Allen, presumably a ship's captain. In the opin- ion of Keith Nicklin, the carving of the faces has the look of Igbo work from around Afikpo. This was followed in 1881 by a second piece from the same general area: a janus head with two smaller human figures carved from wood and painted (Fig. 13). The muse- um bought it at a Dublin auction and it is without documentation of any kind. The museum possesses a fine exam- ple of a Zande harp, but the circum- stances in which it was acquired are still obscure (Fig. 14). The one thing which is clear is that the number painted on it (1886.263) is a mistake, since that num- ber in the accession register relates to a Chinese drum. It is possibly the "stringed instrument, soundbox covered with skin (1880.1426)" referred to on one of the index cards in the museum store- room, which would mean that it had come from the Royal Dublin Society. There is no record of the donor. The harp could, of course, have been acquired somewhat later, although a trawl through the accession registers has failed to yield any description which would fit or the name of any donor who had worked in that part of Africa. From Sierra Leone in the 1890s came two important acquisitions. The first is a sowei mask of the women's society Bondo or Sande (Fig. 15), included in a collection of objects from "Senegambia." It is not recorded from whom these objects were purchased, but one of the items, an Asante stool, retains a label pasted to the base which tells us that it was shipped to Dublin by a firm of forwarding agents in Portsmouth for a Dr. Hart, and it was pre- sumably he or someone acting for him who sold the collection to the museum.6 The mask, a full helmet mask in black- stained wood decorated with metal and with a black raffia fringe, is important in being among the very oldest examples of the type. What is more, unlike other early examples it shows some signs of use. The style of the carving sets it apart from other early sowei masks collected in Vai areas near the Sierra Leone-Liberia border or on the coast around Sherbro Island, but so far it has not been possible to assign it a more exact provenance. The second object, described as a "chief's cloth," is a large (3.3m x 1.5m) piece of Sierra Leone (probably Vai) country cloth of native cotton in varied patterns of blue, white, and red (Fig. 8). This was initially on loan from a Captain Soden in 1892 and was purchased from him the following year. These elaborate- ly patterned, large cloths are called kpokpoisia (sing. kpokpo), and the Dublin example is one of the most spectacular known. It is also one of the earliest, pre- dating the kpokpoisia in the Brighton Museum which were deposited by T.J. Alldridge in the early 1900s. Such cloths are woven in strips which are then sewn together along the edge, and in the more elaborate examples such as this, it requires great skill to weave the designs into each strip in such a way that, when sewn together, they combine to form a larger pattern.7 16.

The largest and most wide-ranging African collection in the museum is that of Captain Wilfred Davidson-Houston, which was deposited in a series of loans and gifts between 1896 and 1910. David- son-Houston saw service in the Gold Coast in the 1890s and 1900s. He was Acting Resident in Kumase and, follow- ing the annexation of Asante and the Northern Territories, one of the two District Commissioners. Davidson-Hous- ton's collection has still to be properly analyzed. It contains a large and repre- sentative selection of objects from Asante, including objects from the royal palace at Kumase. One adinkra cloth, in the aban pattern which was reserved for the Asantehene, is recorded as having been given to Davidson-Houston by Prempeh himself. Prominent among these objects are three state swords with handles decorated with gold leaf (Fig. 16). Davidson-Houston loaned other specimens of Asante goldwork: gold rings, a brooch in the form of a butterfly, and numerous pendants and amulets- but these seem later to have been returned to the lender. The collection also contains a wide range of Asante brass- work (kuduo vessels and goldweights) and woodcarving (Asante stools, akua'ba dolls, boxes). Davidson-Houston's collection is not confined to Asante, but covers central and northern Ghana bordering the then French Sudan. His 1899 loan is notable for weapons and other objects from "Lobi country," including a carved wooden fig- ure and two carved Lobi stools which must be among the earliest examples of Lobi sculpture to have reached any muse- um.8 More important still, in the light of Rene Bravmann's 1960s research into masking traditions around Bondoukou in COte d'Ivoire and west central Ghana, are four "dancing masks from Bontuku" which Davidson-Houston gave to the museum in 1899, and which he followed up with three further masks six years later (Bravmann 1974). These gifts include four examples of what Bravmann called Do masks, which are the earliest ones known, apart from a mask collected by Austin Freeman that is now in the British 44 african arts * spring 1995</page><page sequence="12">AV 14: . ... ... . ....

Like many other museums around Europe, the Dublin museum acquired a number of pieces of Benin brasswork fol- lowing the destruction of the city and its looting by British troops in 1897. The first group of these was purchased from the dealer W.D. Webster in 1898 and 1900 (1898.189-193; 1990.126-7). It included a large commemorative head such as formed the base for a tusk on the Oba's ancestral altars (Fig. 18), a bell, an ornate lidded jug, a rattle, a female figure, and two armlets, all cast in brass. A second group of six pieces was purchased from a Dubliner, Thomas Graham, in 1907 (1907.401-8). According to the seller, they had belonged to his son who died in West Africa in 1898. Presumably he was a member of the punitive expedition. Probably the most famous person to have contributed to the National Muse- um's African collections is Roger Case- ment. In Ireland today he is chiefly remembered as an Irish patriot and mar- tyr, hanged by the British Government for his attempt during the First World War to enlist German support for Irish independence and for his involvement with the 1916 Easter Rising. But he has, quite independently, an honored place in the history of Africa. In 1903, as British Consul in the Congo Free State, he was called upon to investigate the methods used by the Belgian King Leopold and his agents to compel Africans to collect rubber for them in that country. Case- ment's report, which carefully docu- mented the systematic use of beatings, mutilation, and murder by the commer- cial concerns involved, provoked an international outcry and forced the Bel- gian Government to take over control of the Congo from the king, thereby curb- ing the worst excesses of that terrible period (Casement 1904). It seems likely that Casement collect- ed the objects now in Dublin in the Left: 19. Marionette. Ogoni, southeastern Nige- ria. Wood, height of figure 34cm (13.4"). Given by a Dr. Kelsall in 1937.

Most of the forty or so items are from peoples and places on the Upper and Lower Congo he visited in that year, and some of them, for example a loosely woven basket for bringing in rubber, can be associated directly with his inquiries. There are weapons, baskets, cloth and pottery, and items of equipment of a ritual specialist (nganga). Among these is a carved wood- en figure which Casement tells us was called Pemba, although it is not a Phemba, or mother-and-child composition, but rather a male nkisi figure (Fig. 9). Such figures are used for a variety of purposes. In a letter accompanying the collection, Casement explained that he had obtained the figure from a "Senhor Oliveira," a trader in Massabe, a coastal town eighty miles north of the mouth of the Congo, who told him that it had been used by "fetiche men" and "doctors" in that dis- trict.9 It is hung around with tiny carved wooden images of such things as canoes, dogs, and musical instruments, evocative perhaps of the figure's manifold powers. The museum would welcome sugges- tions as to the possible attribution and function of its only Zairian mask (Fig. 21). According to the donor, Mr. George Welsh, it was brought back to Ireland before the First World War by his wife's brother from Elizabethville (now Lum- bumbashi), in the extreme southeast of the country. It is a small, rather crudely carved wooden mask, edged around with fiber and sacking, and with a trail- ing black fiber "beard." Stylistically its affinities seem to be with the type of Makonde mask represented by the fa- mous example, much illustrated, in the Linden-Museum in Stuttgart-though without the distinctive Makonde ears- but the minimalist nature of its carving makes it hard to place. Apart from the "dance ornament" and janus-faced headpiece mentioned earlier, the museum has received from various sources a number of masks and other objects associated with masquerades in southeastern Nigeria. There are three knitted costumes of the Leopard Spirit Society called Ngbe (Ejagham) or Ekpe (Efik) (1906.271, NN 588, NN 669) from the Cross River area. A Dr. Kelsall gave a Below: 21. Mask.

Although acquired by the museum in 1937, they had, accord- ing to the donor, been "lying in a lumber room since 1912-13."10 If I am not mistak- en, P. Amaury Talbot used photographs of Kelsall's Ogoni pieces in his Life in Southern Nigeria (Talbot 1923:82). The most dramatic acquisition from the area is a robe and feathered crocodile headpiece of Akpambe, the short-lived Cross River antiwitchcraft cult. This was given to the museum in 1913 by Captain M.H. Corsellis. He does not say how he came to acquire the mask, but his description of it as having been "used in connection with sasswood oil poison- ing" (a traditional African form of trial by ordeal which the colonial authorities outlawed) makes it likely that it also had been confiscated. It was perhaps this c -n r- m O m 46 african arts * spring 1995</page><page sequence="14">which drove Akpambe underground and led to its being reincarnated under a new name by which it is is still known today: Obassi-Njom.11 Dublin's southern Nigerian material is matched in museums in the United Kingdom (notably the Liverpool Muse- um, the Horniman Museum, and the Museum of Mankind). A rarer collection of objects is from Nasarawa Province, north of the Benue, in northeastern Nigeria. It includes masks and other arti- facts of smaller ethnic groups in the area such as the Kantana (here called Mama), the Mada, and the Tel (often mistakenly called Montol). The highly abstract Kantana bushcow masks are familiar to lovers of African art. Dublin possesses no fewer than eight of these masks and one example of the rarer antelope type, along with other unusual items (e.g., a Jaba or Ham headdress with animal horns deco- rated with Abrus precatorius seeds, and from the same people a carved wooden anthropomorphic pipe). These were given to the National Museum in 1924 by Captain H.L. Norton Traill, who was a Commissioner and later Resident in Charge, Nasarawa Province, between 1904 and 1923 and, incidentally, one of the colonial officers Olive Temple cites as her authorities in her book Notes on the Tribes, Provinces, Emirates and States of the Northern Provinces of Nigeria (1919). The outstanding object in the Norton Traill collection is a mother and child sculpture, one of only five known in the distinctive angular style once attributed to Afo sculptors (Fig. 22). Norton Traill cred- its it to the "inland Igbira" (or Ebira). His failure to mention the Afo in this connec- tion is doubly significant, since Temple in her book cites him as an authority on the Afo people. This would support Sidney Kasfir's contention that such figures should be given a pan-tribal or regional provenance rather than be associated with any one ethnic group (Kasfir 1981). After the mid-1920s, when many other European and American museums were engaged in expanding their African collections, the stream of donations from Africa to the Dublin museum dwindled to a trickle. This was, one might suppose, an indirect effect of the 1922 Treaty with the British Government by which Ireland secured its independence, since it meant the severing of Ireland's contact with British colonies in Africa. As servicemen, missionaries, and colonial administra- tors, the Irish, like the Scots, had always had a disproportionately large part to play in the overseas territories-hence the steady flow of donations to the mu- seum throughout the nineteenth and 23.

Whatever the reason, in the last seven- ty years there are only two collections from Africa which recall the museum's heyday. One is a collection of objects from Ethiopia, mainly ornamental metalwork (e.g., hand crosses, pectoral crosses, jewel- ry) and paintings, given by Miss Marian McGuirk, who was a nurse in the French Legation, Addis Ababa, in the 1930s (Fig. 23). The other--of topical interest at this time of political developments in south- ern Africa-is a collection of traditional beadwork (Fig. 20) from Lesotho and Transkei, including items of apparel of an isangoma, or traditional healer. The objects were collected between 1950 and 1980 by Mrs. H.M.M. Moss, a businesswoman with her own trading stores in the area, and were given on loan to the museum by Dr. Colin Lewis, currently Professor of Geography at Rhodes University, Grahamstown (Lewis, pers. com. 1993). Nevertheless, the impression one might gather from this, looking at the African collections in Ireland's National Museum in isolation-that the years since 1922 have been years of disengage- ment, when the Irish collectively turned their backs on the outside world and on Africa in particular-is certainly a false one. There is hardly anyplace in Africa today where one does not come across Irish missionaries, doctors and nurses, engineers and teachers, U.N. officials and aid workers-not to mention the now traditional bottle of Guinness-at every turn. While the impact of Africa upon this and the immediately preced- ing generation of Irish men and women who have worked there is not reflected in the museum's collections, their story and the story of Africa since indepen- dence remains to be told.

PHOTO COURTESY OF THE NATIONAL MUSEUM OF IRELAND african arts o spring 1995 47</page><page sequence="15">HART: Notes, from page 47 [This article was accepted for publication in September 1994.1 I would like to express my thanks to Dr. Patrick Wallace, Director of the National Museum of Ireland, and to Eamonn Kelly, Raghnall O'Floinn, and Mary Cahill of the Division of Irish Antiquities for giving me access to the museum's African collections and patiently dealing with my inquiries. A special word of thanks also to Margaret Lannin for help in tracing objects and preparing them for photography. 1. The situation may be on the way to being remedied, as the Museum has obtained a go-ahead from the Irish Government to take over and renovate an eighteenth-century Dublin army bar- racks to provide exhibition space for its non-Irish collections. 2. More typical of this area is a figure given to the Natural History Museum in 1879 by W.A. Robertson (NH1879.459). It is the familiar type of Kongo nkisi, with glass eyes and a cav- ity, now empty, in the stomach for holding magical sub- stances. Nothing more is known about the donor or the cir- cumstances in which he acquired the piece. A third figure in a similar style was acquired in 1888, donor unknown, and is described as coming from "Loanga, West Africa" (1888.191). 3. There are two Gelede masks (1887.450, 1887.506) given to the museum by Cecil Digby, M.D., in 1887, which are unprovenanced but must have come from the same area. 4. Included among the Davis objects are examples of Nupe glass bangles. 5. There are five similar figures of roughly the same date in the Museum fuir V61kerkunde, Munich (see Kecskesi 1982:414-17). 6. Almost certainly this came from Dr. William Hume Hart, who was Colonial Surgeon in Sierra Leone in the early 1880s. Although Dr. Hart died of yellow fever in 1884, he had earli- er sent a collection of tropical insects to the Dublin museum through an intermediary, his brother Henry Chichester Hart. Following the death of their father, Dr. (latterly Sir) Andrew Searle Hart, in April 1890, H.C. Hart deposited a second col- lection, of "natural history objects from Sierra Leone," at the museum and, it seems reasonable to suppose, handed over the ethnographic collection at the same time. They were pre- sumably part of the younger Dr. Hart's effects which had been forwarded to Dublin. Hart made at least one trip into the interior of Sierra Leone, in 1882 to negotiate a peace between warring Temne chiefs. If the mask was collected by him it would be contemporary with the Vai sowei mask col- lected by Biittikofer, now in Bern, which is otherwise the ear- liest example known. 7. A still earlier, though plainer, example of country cloth from this area, a hammock made from strips of blue and white striped cotton, was acquired from an unknown source before 1880 (1880.2041). 8. According to J.-L. Paudrat's chart in Rubin 1987:166-67, the Mus4e du Trocadero, the forerunner of the Musee de I'Homme, did not acquire its first Lobi sculpture until after 1907. 9. The details are given in a note enclosed in a letter Casement wrote to the museum on June 23, 1904. Quoted by M.J.P. Scannell and 0. Snoddy in a paper on Roger Casement's contribution to the collection of ethnography and economic history in the National Museum of Ireland, which is in museum files. 10.
