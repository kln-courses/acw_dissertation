<plain_text><page sequence="1">School Culture. Edited by Jon Prosser. Pp. 182. Index. London: Paul Chapman Publishing Ltd. Thousand Oaks, California: Sage Publications Inc., New Delhi: Sage Publications India Pvt Ltd. 1999. ISBN 1-85396-377-1 (Pbk.) This edited collection aims to 'provide both an understanding and insight into school culture that will be of interest to practitioners, policy makers and theoreti- cians' (p. xii). This broad aim is ambitious in scope. It can easily run the risk of providing a superficial perspective of the main issue/s being addressed. Another important factor in an edited book is that it should represent a coherent whole, allowing key issues, concepts and themes to be explored systematically despite the various foci of individual contributors. In School Culture, the editor attempts to over- come these difficulties by presenting holistic perspectives of school culture in Chap- ters 1-6. This then serves to contextualise the discussions in Chapters 7-11, which view school cultures as comprising 'significant sub-cultures' (p.xii). Thus the editor argues '(t)he chapters in his book provide a blend of insights into school culture and represent the continuum that exists between the "holistic" and the "summation of sub-cultures" perspectives' (p.xvii). Chapter One provides an historical overview of some of the key theoretical influ- ences on the debate that surrounds the concept of school culture. Although this discussion does provide a comprehensive review of the educational literature, it does not relate this to broader societal influences. In particular, it neglects to explore the shift in educational development towards a micro-focus on institutional development and organisational theory, and the emergence of 'new managerial- ism' during the 1980s. This silence in the discussion gives the impression that these changes evolved within an ideological and political vacuum. It also creates a struc- tural weakness in that there are no clear links established with the perspective of global change in education presented in Sally Power and Geoff Whitty's compre- hensive discussion of shifting ideological paradigms in Chapter Two. Indeed, with- out clear linkage, this chapter looks somewhat discrete in the book as a whole. Chapters 3 and 4 return us to the dominant paradigm grounded in a 'real world', unproblematic and socially decontextualised view of school culture located firmly within the framework of school improvement. This paradigm is rich in metaphors, but focused as it is on micro-structures and operational processes, it presents no more than commonsense argument aiming to provide universal solu- tions to what in practice comprise complex networks of interactions within and beyond the institutional context. Instead, the management of cultural change is 332 @ Blackwell Publishers Ltd. and SCSE 2000</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS linked mainly to different management styles. There is no acknowledgement of the, by now, general acceptance that organisational cultures consist of multiple ratio- nalities and realities that overlap, interpenetrate and contradict one another. There is no scope presented for possibilities to imagine alternative realities; to negotiate different outcomes. We are advised instead that 'the cleverest heads learn how to channel dissent along positive paths that indirectly contribute to the school's goals (or at least to the harmless side-roads where most of us like to or need to dawdle sometimes' (Hargreaves, Chapter 4, p. 58). And thus it both assumes, and engen- ders, a compliant organisational culture. High reliance is placed on a rather parochial view of 'collegiality', 'peer coaching' and 'peer review'. The problem with this view is that it infers that a monolithic approach will yield universal solutions, despite the fact that disparate conditions prevail in different contexts. Moreover, anthropomorphic typologies of school cultures, e.g. 'moving;, 'strolling', 'cruising' 'struggling', serve a powerful means of classification. In practice, they represent value-laden diagnostic devices to screen out underperforming schools. These insti- tutionally focused perspectives serve fundamentally to legitimate truth discourses and, moreover, to sustain operationally grounded self-regulatory regimes. These meanings sit somewhat contradictorily alongside the ambiguities and conflicts that arise in the complex realities described in Nias' evaluation in Chapter 5 of the 'culture of care' historically associated with primary teaching. They also sit contradictorily alongside the issues of identity formation, special educational needs and gender disparities in the reading curriculum that feature throughout the rest of the book. These discussions reflect the chaos and tension in which school cultures are constituted, and address important aspects of schools as sites of cultural production and reproduction. By themselves they are significant arguments to explore in relation to developing a broader perspective of current educational policy and practice. Similarly, the chapters on visual sociology as a mode of inquiry into school culture, and teacher identity and popular culture, raise interesting issues individually. However, whether they are integrated sufficiently to make a coherent book is highly questionable. Without a clear theoretical overview and a narrative structure making intertextual links it is hard to make sense of the book as a whole. The main difficulty lies in the fact that there is no initial discussion of why school culture research is important in the current educational milieu. Addressing this issue would have gone a long way in helping to integrate the different perspec- tives presented in the book into a coherent whole. University of Reading NAs RASSOOL</page></plain_text>
