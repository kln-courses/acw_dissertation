Les references sont donnees avec page et ligne, ou avec le numero des paragraphes, s'il en existe: rien de plus facile au specialiste que de les verifier. Une derniere observation doit pourtaut etre faite: les auteurs se sont appuy6s, dans les trois- quart des cas, sur une bibliographie exclusivement allemande. II en est ainsi parce qu'ils la con- naissent mieux que l'ensemble des ouvrages en langue etrang6re. C'est pourquoi ils n'ont pu eviter, assez souvent, de citer des publications qui ne sont pas les meilleures a l'heure actuelle, dans chaque sujet dont ils traitent. L'ouvrage de Helck et d'Otto n'en est pas moins tres sir, tres pratique et utile. II est le meilleur dans sa categorie, a l'heure actuelle. Je souhaite qu'on le trouve en de nombreuses mains dans tous les lieux du monde ou notre science est en honneur. Sceaux Maurice Alliot JOHANNES FRIEDRICH, Hethitisches Worterbuch. Kurzge/asste kritische Sammlung der Deutungen hethitischer Worter. - Heidelberg, Carl Winter I952. 344 S. (Indogermanische Bibliothek, hrsg. v. Hans Krahe, Zweite Reihe: Worterbucher). Hittitology is still relatively young and therefore has not yet produced a dictionary in the sense of a collection of all the words of the language. In fact it would be hard to produce such a dictionary at a time when a large portion even of the texts excavated in I906-I912 is unpublished and when new tablets are being unearthed every year. Friedrich quite understandibly, therefore, set himself a more limited goal: as the subtitle indicates, his Hethitisches W6rterbuch (abbr. HW) is "a short critical collection of the interpretations of Hittite words" that were given or proposed in scholarly literature. In other words, the HW follows the example of Sturtevant's Hittite Glossary. Since the latter was published (in second edition) as early as I936, with a Supplement in I939, it is obvious that it had become outdated. The late professor Sturtevant, who rewrote the first part of his Comparative Grammar shortly before his death, never published a new edition of his Glossary. It is therefore highly to be welcomed that Friedrich took over this task. Again following the example of Sturtevant, Friedrich included some words that were not treated in literature but for which he was able to offer a translation. The HW differs from the Glossary in that it gives references for the less common inflectional forms. Even so, however, it is not a dictionary in the strict sense: it does not contain the many words whose meaning is still unknown, and references are primarily to scholarly literature, not to the texts themselves (except for the rarer inflectional forms). The title "Worterbuch", therefore, is not exact; the book is a glossary rather than a dictionary. I understand that the title was chosen mainly in order to make it fit into the series of "Wbrter- biicher" in which it is published. The subtitle just explained describes the nature of the book better than its main title. The HW is a useful, even indispensable tool indeed. It is being used by everybody, scholar and beginner alike, and will render its services for a long time to come. It contains, apart from the Hittite words (pp. I7-263), also ideograms and numerals (pp. 264-304), Akkadian words used in Hittite texts (pp. 305-315; the words used in Akkadian texts from Bogazk6y are not included, and rightly so; they were collected by Labat, L'Akkadien de Boghaz-koi, Bordeaux, I932), and words from the other Bogazk6y languages, as far as their meaning is known: Hattic (pp. 316-319), Hurrian (pp. 319-327), Indic (p. 327), Palaic (pp. 327 f.), Luwian (pp. 328-330), words provided with the "marker" or "Glossenkeil" (pp. 330-334) and words written in hieroglyphs (pp. 334-336). These separate listings are very welcome and, to my mind at least, preferable to a listing of all words in one alphabetical sequence. Those "marked" words whose meaning is known are listed both in the main body of the HW and in the special ,,Glossenkeil" list. It is natural for any work of this kind that there may be different opinions about the meaning 350</page><page sequence="2">Books: Germany 35I of some words, and that new evidence and new literature necessitate changes or additions. As far as possible during the time when the book was published in installments (until I954), Friedrich collected additions and corrections in the "Nachtrage" (pp. 337-344), which draw in part from reviews of the previous installments. [See Addendum.] The present reviewer was asked by Friedrich to read the first draft as well as the galley and page proofs; he was thereby enabled, so to speak, to make such remarks as are costumary in a review while they could be incorporated in the book itself. The obvious thing to do now seems to be to substantiate those of his proposals for which this is necessary. Before doing so I would like to comment on one more general point. It is my feeling that the listings of verbal composita under verbs (verbs with preverbs) include cases that I would not have listed as such. The distinction between adverbial, postpositional, and preverbal use of the words in question, made by L. Zuntz in her dissertation Ortsadverbien, is quite correct; each case should be analysed according to her principles, and only real preverbs should be entered. Since these listings in the HW are generally without reference, however, I was not able to check the examples given and did not dwell on them in the comments submitted to Friedrich. I think, however, that the matter deserves careful attention in a new edition of the HW and in any future Hittite dictionary. There follow some explanations to entries given in the HW with the remark "Giiterbock brief- lich". The abbreviations used are those familiar to Hittitologists; they are also listed in the HW itself, pp. 7-13. Some entries are either self-explanatory or immediately intelligible from the passages quoted in HW, so that they need not be mentioned here. A few words have in the mean time been treated in full, either by this reviewer or by others: For halai- (p. 46), haSduir (pp. 64 and 340), and tallai (p. 206) see Goetze, JAOS 74, i88 ff. appaSiwatta (p. 337) and DUGkattakurant- (p. I05) were treated by this reviewer in Corolla Linguistica, Festschrift F. Sommer, pp. 63 f., 65. sallakarta- and its derivatives (HW only the "marked" Sallakartatar, p. 332) were first established by Laroche, RA 48, 47, and then discussed by Gliterbock, Corolla 65 ff. For Suwaya- (p. 200) see Giiterbock and Hamp, RHA 58, 22 ff. For GAM tiyatar (p. 224) cf. Kammenhuber's cautious remarks MIO II 62 n. 47 and p. 76. For GUR as ideogram of damai- see the literature quoted (p. 344); I had independently noticed the equation and was able to add Landsberger's suggestion concerning the origin. Akkadian hazertu (p. 344) is now in the Chicago Assyrian Dictionary VI 130 s.v. hasartu. Other entries require more comment. Some of my suggestions were caused by the feeling that one has to look for a logical link between seemingly disparate meanings. One of these was igmeri- and igmeriyant- (p. 88 f.): the "lords of the ismeri-", obviously charioteers in the annals of Tudhaliya, and the animal awiti (lion or sphinx) which is described as ismeriyant- in a Bild- beschreibung (MVAG 46, 2, p. I4 ii 8) cannot be combined on the basis of a "Stellung" or "Gangart" (ibd. p. 32 n. 2) but only if ismeri- is a rein, the charioteers are "lords of the rein", and the lion is "provided with a line or leash" as so frequently depicted. This proposal was later confirmed by Laroche, RHA 57, 8i ff., who adduced the decisive passage where ismeri- is written with the determinative KU? "leather" from a Geneva text which had escaped me. See now also his article on the hieroglyph for "charioteer", which is a picture of reins, RHA 58, 29 ff. One may now safely read the well-known SA KU . KA. TAB. AN?U of Hatt. i 12 as ismeriyaS "(man) of the rein". Similarly, the two spheres of meaning proposed for the derivatives of lahlah- (p. I24 f.), "galop- pieren lassen" and "bekiimmert sein", etc., can only be reconciled on the grounds of an original "agitation". Kammenhuber, OLZ I954, 231, adduced new evidence for the hippological term, but this does not eliminate the necessity of finding a common basis for "galop" and a certain state of mind. A third example is purpura- and DUGpurpuri- (p. 173 f.). The former is doubtless some kind</page><page sequence="3">Kitablar: Almanya of "lump"; the latter can only refer to the shape of the vessel. Globular shape seems indicated since the German "Kloss", proposed beside "Klumpen" for the lump of clay or dough and for NINDA purpura- (the last two are real "dumplings"), carries the notion of something round, and since "globular jugs" are common in archeaology. Comments on other entries follow in alphabetical order: arahziyaz (p. 338 against p. 28): The analysis as arahza + ya + z(a) is based on the context of IBoT I 36 iii 6-22; cf. nu-za ... harzi (14) and arahza-ma-az ... harzi (I9); KUB VII I3 i o0 is broken. armahh- (p. 338): The intransitive meaning occurs in ABoT 2i i I: [m]dnza SAL-za armahhi "If a woman is pregnant", and also fits the Telipinu Myth, XVII Io i I4 f.: "Cattle, sheep, and men no longer become pregnant". hantiya(i)- (p. 53): I added "versorgen" because it seemed to suit the texts better than "betreuen, hegen", and I would maintain this even after Goetze's treatment, JAOS 74, I88. Thus, Tawagalawa iii 55-58 (AU p. I4): "Now, what does this word mean? (lit.: How is it, this word?) If he leaves his wife, sons, and household in My Brother's country, then your country will s u p p o rt him!"-Ulmi-Tesub treaty KBo IV io obv. 40-42 with dupl. ABoT 57: "When I, the Sun, came to Tattagsa, I saw the levy for the god (as laid down in) a treaty: it had become formidable (dasSeSta, see below), it was so that he could not raise it (UL(-aS)-Si-ia-at tar-ah-hu-u(-wa)-a? after the dupl., "es war fur ihn nicht zu leisten"). Formerly (I read an(!)-ni-sa-an-za), when Muwatalli "made for himself" Tattassa and the gods of Tatta?sa (i.e., made T. his capital and devoted himself to its gods), all Hatti-land s u p p o r t e d them. But now, the king and queen made Inara king in Tattagsa, and he was unable to raise the levy for the god out of his own country. Therefore the king and queen have (now) made the following treaty with you."-KBo VI 29 i I5 f. (Hatt. p. 46): "The estate that was mine-I s u p p o r t e d Ishtar of Samuha out of my estate." (XXVI 43 rev. 25 is fragmentary). harsi-, in NINDA harsi- and DUG harsi- (p. 60), also NINDA. KUR4. RA (p. 288): I maintain my interpretation in spite of Goetze's criticism, JAOS 74, I89, on the basis of the well-attested meaning "thick" of KUR4, especially said of bread, and of the fact that a DUG harsi- is a "pithos", for which a name "thick vessel" would be fitting. However, a few explanations and modifications are in place. I. Friedrich did not indicate that I considered the variant NINDA. SI . SA in the Plague Prayer a real textual variant (the passage adduced K1F I 200 is ibd., p. 2I4 ? 9, 8 with note v: B = XIV ii iii 4i LI. ME N. SI. SA against A = XIV 8 rev. I8 LI . MES N. K. R . -us): "men of normal loaves" as another word used instead of "men of the thick loaves". Upon second thought I would now even consider it a scribal error. NINDA. SI . SA does not occur elsewhere, but the sign combination is well known as NfG. SI . SA = misaru = handatar. The idea that "the men of righteousness" should not die would, in itself, fit the context just as well as "the few bread offerers and drink offerers who are left"; the wrong ideogram might thus have got into the text of B, although the word iSpantuzziyaleS, which follows both in B and A, shows that the same phrase as in ? 3, I and ? II, 2 was intended here. 2. Whatever the value of the variant, I agree that the LU. MES N . K . R. or harSiyaleS are simply "bread offerers", and that N. K. R. is often used for sacrifical bread in general; but I would regard this a secondary development, based on the fact that "thick loaves" were the most common kind of offering bread. 3. Even if N . K. R. and NINDA. SIG are not expressly contrasted, the fact remains that they are the two most common types of bread; since the second is "thin", the meaning "thick" fits the first very well. 4. I should not have explained "thick" by "gesauert", since, as we now know, there is a N . K . R. KU7 or mitgaimi- "sweet thick bread" beside N. K. R. EMSU "sour thick bread". Only the 352</page><page sequence="4">Books: Germany latter is "gesiuert", of course; for the former I would now think of some kind of leavening other than sour dough, for instance yeast, so that N. K. R. KU7 would be something like a yeast cake or a sweet roll. (Uzu)hupalla?- (p. 340 f.): In the sequence of parts of the body in KBo III 8 + KUB VII I, h. once follows "hair" (8 iii 32 f.) and is introduced with kattan-ma-af "below it" or "together with it"; in the following two sections (i iii ii and 20) it is described as being "on top of" the patient (?er) and precedes the hair. Hence the suggested meaning "scalp". Whether this word has anything to do with :hupala- "net" (HW p. 75) I am unable to tell. [See Addendum.] T6Ghuwammaliya- (p. 341): see below under SarpaSSi-. kamarS- (p. 97): Apart from the well-known gamarSuwant- in the Mesedi text (see HW s.v. and cf. below), the verb itself occurs in the passages mentioned in HW which read as follows: XVII 27 iii 12 ff.: natkan ANSU-a? etharre?kiddu (14) [nat]-kan GUD-u? kam-mar-Ni-eg-ki-id-du DUMU. Lt. ULJ. LU-ma-?a-an (I4) [kui?] Ser arha iyattari nuSSan ?er (I5) [all]appahhkikiddu (cf. Goetze in ANET 347) "Let the donkey make them (the words of witchcraft, 8) bloody, let the ox kammarS- them, let the man who walks over them spit upon them!"-XXXI oo00 rev. 8 ff.: [nu k]a-ma-ar-su-wa-a? uddani mekki nahh[antel eSten] (9) [nam]makan vURUfattufi ?er ha-aS-Su-uS le-e [........] (io) [n]a?ta [ha-a?]-?u-u? katta gallai hu-ulS-i-li-pdt [....] "And in the matter of kamarSuwar [be] very care[ful]! Do not let the king [.....] up in Hattusa, let him rather [go( ?)] down to the great pit!" I mentioned this passage to Friedrich as an example for ha??u- "king" spelled syllabically (cf. p. 64), but he did not consider this interpretation certain enough to be entered. ger and katta obviously refer to localities in Bogazkoy: HattuSi Ser to the royal acropolis, katta to a place in the lower town. hutSelli- (p. 77) seems here to be a special kind of pit, namely, a latrine; the adjective alli- may designate it as the one reserved for royal use, cf. Salli haS?atar "the great = royal family".-XVIII 41 rev. 8 has ka-mar-Si-eg-kdn-zi in fragmentary context. To these passages should be added XXX 31 i 6 kat-mar-Si-it-ti (cf. Orientalia N.S. 25, i2I). Although I do not see how the king and queen could be in Hattusa before sunrise (I-3) and in Kizwatna right after it (4 f.)-the solution may be that a part of Bogazk6y was called Kizwatna or vice versa-the neighborhood of gakniyanzi (3) and warpanzi (7) is in favor of taking katmarSitti as equivalent to *kammarSizzi or, since plural is required by the context, *kammar?anzi. It seems clear that kammar?- refers to some kind of bodily function; the question is: urinating or bowel movement? Sturtevant chose the former because of Sehuna which, in IBoT I 36 i 44, must refer to the same thing; Goetze (ANET 347 "muck") preferred the latter. The special emphasis laid on the kamartuwaS uttar speaks in favor of the latter, and so does the fact that the Mesedi text distinguishes two cases: ? 6-7 = i 33 ff. mdnanzakan (34) Sehunanzapat tamaSzi, in which case the guardsman goes to the DUGkalti- (36, 41); and ? 8 - i 43 mdnzakan gammarSu- wanza-ma kuin tamaSzi. If the meaning "to move the bowels" for kammar?- is correct, it would follow that gehur (in 44) has, in addition to "urine", also a wider meaning (or that it is used euphemistically also for the other thing). The question marks after 'urinieren" und "Harnblase" in HW, thus, are to be understood as indicating a doubt concerning the specific meaning, and I am now inclined to prefer "move the bowels" and "bowel movement". gangadai- (p. 98): The passage that indicates something like "kultisch reinigen, entsiihnen, vers6hnen" is XXIX 7 obv. I-20 containing such phrases as (i f.) nu hudak (2) DINGIR-LUM ISTU SA LUGAL humandaS hurdiya? uddani gangadaizzi (similar 7-io), (II) kinunaz DINGIR- LUM ape[z] uddanaz parkui? gangadanzaSSa eS, (I5 f.) nu LUGAL-AM ITTI DINGIR-LIM gangataizzi EGIR-SU-ma UNUT SAL. LUGAL (I6) ITTI DINGIR-LIM gangataizzi EGIR- S[U-m]a ISTU LUGAL UNUT SAL. LUGAL-ya takSan gangataizzi. This cannot possibly mean "mit Gemiise(suppe) bewirten"! The mention of gangatisAR in connection with the verb in I7 ff. of the same text as well as in KBo V 2 iv 54 ff. and XV 42 iii I7 ff. shows that the Hittites con- 353</page><page sequence="5">Kitablar: Almanya connected the name of the plant with the root of the verb, if only for the purpose of sympathetic magic; the connection may, of course, be based on folk etymology and therefore need not be taken seriously in an attempt to determine the meaning of either the verb or the plant name. GIAkuppiSSar (p. 342) see below under SarpaS?i-. luStani- (p. I3I): The material was presented by Laroche, RHA 5I, 25 ff. The first passage, quoted there after XXXI 89 and 86, is now in von Schuler, Heth. Dienstanweisungen, AfO Beih. o0, p. 43 D2 13 ff. I would follow Laroche in translating GIIG-anteS (GI?)hatalwanteg as "provided with doors and door-bolts", but von Schuler in taking KA. GAL-TIM lu?tanieS (var.) as co- ordinated, "gates and luItanis".-In IBoT I 36 i 60 (Laroche p. 26 top) I read the damaged sign GAL, not URU, after 62 f. and 67. A contrast is made between the GAL KA. GAL "great" or "main gate" and the luStani-, which is the reason for my "Seitentiir". Another point in which I differ from Laroche is the interpretation of katta. If luStaniyaz katta panzi meant "they descend from the lugtani-" (Laroche ad iv 7) and indicated that the 1. was on an upper storey, the same would apply to KA . GAL (i 60). I rather think that katta refers to the fact that leaving the acropolis always involves a descent. So I would translate IBoT I 36 i 50 ff.: "But when a Mesedi leaves the portico, he holds a spear (while walking) through the portico. (When) he arrives at the side door, he deposits the spear with the gatekeeper, and he himself goes down (= leaves the acropolis). (53) But if a Mesedi steals away and takes the spear down through the side door, and the gatekeeper apprehends him, .. . (etc.). (60 ff.) The Mesedis and the palace attendants do not go down through the great (= main) gate, they go down through the side door. (Only) a Mesedl who leads a Sarkanti-, and one whom the chief of messengers dispatches, that one goes down through the great one; also the lords and the chiefs of thousand go down through the great one." In view of recent finds on Btiyiikkale the luftani- might be a postern (MDOG 89,32 and fig. 28). miyanu- (p. I42): The passages discussed by von Brandenstein (ref. in HW) have to be re- interpreted since alkiSta(n)- is no longer "fruit" but rather "branch"; also because it is impossible to make fruit ripe by means of other fruit. The situation is rather this that in winter branches are given an artificial appearence of freshness by fruit tied to them. X 27 i 14 ff.: "Then they cut branches of fruit trees, each separately, and the bara [puts] them behind the god. (I9) If it is in the spring, [he cuts] fresh branches (alk[iOtanuS] miyan[duS kar?zi]); (22) but if it is in the f[all] or [wi]nter, then he makes the branches fresh by means of fresh fruit (alkistanut huelpit ISTU INBI miyanuzi) and deposits them each separately." XXVII I6 i io ff.: "If it is spring, they are cut fresh (miyan[te? ka]rSanda); but if it is winter or fall, [they make] them fresh with fresh f[ruit( ?)], (namely) grapes and apples (nat ISTU GII[N-BI( ?)] huelpit GEg TIN-it GI?UASHUR-it miya[nuwanzi]) and deposit them on both sides of the god and behind his back." UZUpanduha- (p. i57) was known as an inner organ from KUB VII i, where it follows lung, (heart), liver and genzu but precedes the anus. The proposal "stomach" or "bladder" is based on KUB IX I iii 20-22, according to which one pours water into it; it therefore must be a part that can hold a liquid. [See Addendum.] p argaweS- (p. i6o f.) and parkuya- (p. i6i): The attribution of derivatives to the two adjectival stems parku- "high" and parkui- "clean" is not always easy; Friedrich's listings are good, and my contributions only affect details. In the Appu story (XXIV 8 i 31 = Friedrich, ZA 49, 216 f.) it seemed easier to me to emendate pdr-ku-i-ia-ta-at inito par-ki(!)-i-ia-ta-at and to derive it from parkiya- "sich erheben" ("Appu arose from his sleep") than to posit parkuya- "to cleanse onself" as Friedrich did following Sturtevant (Glossary, parkwiyale- "be pure"). Since this proposal involves emendation, however, it is to be treated with reserve. For p argaweS-, the parallel in the Ullikummi Epic is important: pargaweSkattaru I C iii 25 f. 354</page><page sequence="6">Books: Germany 355 is taken up by parkiSkattari A iv 23 f. (the latter not listed in HW). My brief remark "lautlich wichtig" in Kumarbi p. 68 means that here we have a short stem parkeg- beside the normal pargawes- from the diphthong grade of parku-. This justifies derivation of dasSe?- from dasSu- (see below). I then take parkista, Ull. I A iv 27, as an active preterit from the same parkis-, rather than considering it an -?- preterit of parkiya- (the three passages are in JCS V I56 f.). paskuwai- (p. 165): As indicated in HW, I follow Landsberger in taking tepperikkianni in the Bilingual of Hattusili I as a form of naparkH "to discontinue", thus returning to Goetze's inter- pretation as against Falkenstein's in HAB. For the meaning, parallel passages in prayers are important: XXX ii obv. 7 f. + XXXI I35, 14 f. // XXXI 127 + ABoT 44 + XXXVI 79 i 46 ff.: antuhgann-a-z kuin DINGIR. MES ganzi nansan arha paskuwanzi nan appa zikpat DUTU-u? genzuwa?i (var.: nan appa zik kappuwaSi nan genzuwasi). XXX io rev. 2f.: [... numusSan kuis DINGIR-YA] Sait numut?an arha pa(!)-aS-ku(!)-ut-ta appayamuza (3) [apaspat kappuiddu ...] with the parallel ABoT 44a, 6 ff. (= ii 64 ff. of XXXI I27 + . ..): [numu]S?an kuis DINGIR-YA sait (7) [numu] arha pissiyat (8) [appaya]muza apaspat kappuiddu. arha pagku(wai)- is equivalent to arha peSSiya- "cast away" and contrasted to appa kappu(wai)- "take into consideration again". This leads to something like "reject". An unpublished text (Babilili ritual) furnishes another concrete meaning (1782/C, left col. 19 f.): PISAN-ma-wa ma-ah- ha-an (io) [ar-ha pa-as]-ku-ti i-da-a-lu-ia-wa ar-ha QA-TAM-MA pa-aS-ku-tu(m) "As the eaves remove (rain water), so let (it) also remove the evil!" ([pa-aS]-ku-ti, if correctly restored, is a Luwian 3d sing. pres.). In the Bilingual, "do not palku- me" (without arha) amounts to "do not reject, neglect, or ignore my admonitions", whereas nukan aSi memiyan arhapat paSkuwanun in Sprachl. obv. 5 may best be translated "I ignored this matter". patalha- (p. I66) is a crux. The word without determinative is a part of the foot: the vocabulary KBo I 5I iii 8-io lists: (8) [Sepu] = GIR[-x] "foot" (cf. HW 343) (9) [ ..... GI]R(?) = pa-tal-ha[-a?] "[... of the fo]ot" = p. (Io) [ubdn] GIR = GIR-ag kalulup[a?] "finger of the foot", i.e., toe. In XXIV 13 ii 2I it is listed after "feet", and in the incantation of the Telipinu Myth B iv I5 ff' (Otten, Uberlief. 25 f. = XXXIII 8 iii ii ff.) idalus patalhaS follows "evil anger, wrath and fury, sin, and evil tongue". GI?patalha- is a wooden object. In the sixth dream of Kessi (XVII I ii 9 f. I/ XXXIII I21 iii ii, ZA 49, 238 f.) "a dog collar is laid on his neck, a p. of women is laid below him". This passage was freely rendered by Gaster, The Oldest Stories of the World, p. I47, as "his feet shackled in chains such as women wear for adornment". According to XXXIII II5 iii 8, it can be made of GI?LAM. GAL, probably pistacio wood. I have considered either "sole" and wooden sole = "sandal", or "ankle" and "fetter", without arriving at a conclusion. If I understood what an "evil sole" is, I would prefer "sole, sandal". The problem is further complicated by the existence of (a) a verb katta pa/hat-tal-li-ya- which, if read patalliya-, could be "to fetter", but for which the reading hattalliya- is now preferred (to HW 65 and I66 add Laroche, RHA 57, 83 f.), and (b) a noun TtGpa-ta-al-la[-...] KBo VII 25, 5 (Werner, Orientalia N.S. 25, I69 "vielleicht eine Fussbekleidung? 'Strumpf(??)"'). [See Add.] pisen(a)- (p. I70): BoTU I43 19 + XXXI 4, 20 reads: nu pi-Se-e-nu[-us ha-a]t-re-eS-ki-iz-zi URUHalpa itten, and BoTU I4 a, 9 f. has pi-s4-ni-eS LUGAL-i u-i-e-er. The meaning "messenger", based on these two passages, is only a guess. galwina- (p. I8o): The word galwina-, -a- stem, designates some material and has to be kept apart from the -i- stem Salwini-, which is the name of a bird.</page><page sequence="7">Kitablar: Almanya Bo 2416 i I4 (Otten, OLZ I94I, I7) and FHG 6a iv 4 (Laroche, RA 45, I87, 23 with ABoT 4 etc.) are duplicates and can therefore be restored as follows: i-EN Sinan 4-il-na-a-agS a-lu-i-ni-it [ ....] "One image with galwina of clay [..... (verb lost)]". IX 39 i 2 f. mentions Sal-&amp;-i-na-a? purut and [... wa]ppuwaS IM-an "plaster of Salwina-" and "clay of the river bed". Something that can be of clay and also serve as material for purut seems to be the material called kerpif in Turkish, made of mud mixed with water and chaff and used both for sun-dried bricks and as wall plaster. In XXX I5 obv. 26-28 (Otten, ZA 46, 218), then, the SALSU. GI puts on one side of the scales "silver, gold, and all (precious) stones", on the other this worthless material; a nice contrast indeed! Whether the name of the bird is derived from this word, remains an open question; one could think of the color or the habitat of the bird as a link. GISSarra- (p. 184), to my knowledge only in Tunnawi i I9, iii 6, 12. From this text we only learn that it is mentioned beside combs, and that, like these, it is made of taskarinnu "boxwood". The combination with the verb Sarra- in iii 6-II is for sympathetic magic only and does not help. The reason for rejecting Sommer's tentative rendering as "tweezers" is that these would hardly be made of wood. "Spatula" is no more than another guess, just as Goetze's "brush". If a deter- mination of the exact meaning becomes possible at all, other articles of toiletry, such as manapnalla- (HW p. 135) will have to be considered too. GI?IKUv?arpa-, KU?SarpaSSi- (p. 187): The whole group is far from clear, except for the last word. The birth ritual XXX 29 obv. 1-7 follows in full, since it is they key passage also for other words.

When the child (is about to) fall down, the woman sits down on the stools, and the midwife holds the receiving blanket in her hand." The situation seems quite clear in spite of some inconsistencies in spelling. [2 GIO?ku-upp]i-iS in line 2 is either a mistake for ku-up-pi-iS&lt;-Sar&gt;&gt;, the form expected according to kuppiSni and kuppiSnaS, or a short stem kuppi- (in the nom. sg. in listing). It is clear that these two k.s are seats, set up so that the woman sits on both (plur. in line 6) with space between them to allow for the delivery. SarpaSSi-, twice determined with "leather" and put both on the k.s and on the ground between them, must be cushions or bolsters; the GIg in line 3 is another inconsistency of the scribe, rather than a mere mistake (see below on Sarpa-). Finally, the TfGhuwammaliya- must be the special kind of cloth used in the procedure, known as "receiving blanket". For sarpa-, again with determinatives KUg and GIS, in different contexts I cannot go much beyond what Gurney has said (AAA 27, 90 ff., not quoted in HW). It is tempting, however, to connect Sarpa- with SarpaSSi-. In KBo V 2 i 31 "one bolster" between a chair, a footstool, and a garment would not be bad. Bo 703 obv. 9 (AAA 27, 91) cannot be separated; it has Gl?garpa GUSKIN. GAR. RA i GI?GIR. GUB GUgKIN. GAR. RA, that is, both the Sarpa and the footstool are covered with gold, and the Sarpa is here written with GIS! Is this a piece of furniture, from which SarpalSi- "the one belonging to a Sarpa-" takes its name? According to GIl?arpaS eSat (XXXIII 20 iii I // 21 iii 2, Otten, Tel. D iii, p. 57) one can sit down on it (plural!). In the Arzawa letter the word also has to do with furniture: (36) 3 GI?GU.

According to Knodtzon, EA No. 31, p. 274 note e, there are two signs inserted: GIg and probably ESI (KAL), against VBoT I, 36, where only the former is given (Gurney, AAA 27, 91 follows EA). If this is correct, the interpretation of GIXSar-pa-x-x as the kind of wood the chairs are made of (Orientalia N.S. XII 355 based on VBoT) has to be given up. But whether this Tar- pa-... (which then has no determinative) can be connected with the assumed "bolster" remains uncertain, since the next two signs are not clear. Other passages containing Sarpa- are still more problematic. One could go on to say that the deified GISarpa- mentioned together with the plough among gods (X 92 v 13) could be a cushion or upholstered seat (symbols of work and rest, respectively), and that in the phrase naSta URVDU?epikkuwtag GIS?arpaz kunkueni (Plague Prayers and AAA 27, 28 line 23) ?arpa- is a pin cushion, since Sepikkusta- seems to be a pin or something similar (see below). But as long as the meaning of kunk- and the syntax of the phrase are not clear, nothing can be said. And finally, the A . SA terippiya? GIS?arpaS &amp;aSduir of the Anniwiyani ritual can hardly have anything to do with upholstery! It seems, therefore, safer to posit several words Sarpa-. Returning to HW 187, I doubt the existence of the first SGl?arpa- (ein Baum, etc.); the second GISarpa- (Gerat) is in order, as far as it goes; the GIlSarpa- of Anniw. should be listed separately (there is not even a reference to the text or the discussions of it in HW); and KU^Sarpa- "Kissen, Polster(?)" must keep its question mark; both here and under KU4arpafSi- the alternative deter- minative GIg should be mentioned. [See Addendum.] URUDUvepikkuSta- (p. I90, also URUDUZI . KIN. BAR, p. 301): Here, too, Gurney, AAA 27, 90 should have been quoted. That this bronze object is straight like a pin follows, apart from Gurney's suggestion "stylus" (based on the listing after "writing tablet" in XVII 20 ii 22), also from XXVII 49 iii I6-22, where the context requires restoration of a second URUDUZI .

BARs]. And [they call] it 'the head of the deity'." For pask- = Akkad. zaqdpu see HW I65; the specific verb is decisive for the nature of the object. guppala- (p. I98): The German rendering "Vieh" was chosen as a general term for domesticated animals. That Suppala- is a general term follows from XXXI I27 + XXXVI 79 i 43 (cf. Otten, KUB XXXI, Vorwort); that it refers to domesticated animals, from the Soldiers' Oath iv I3-I5, the Laws ? I63, and the possessive pronoun in BoTU 2I ii I (ZA 44, I04). Cf. already Laroche, JCS I I92 "(domesticated) animal"; cf. now the same, OLZ I956, 422, and Goetze, Language 30, 404. para Siyatar (p. 343): The phrase quoted is in KBo V 2 i 38; the interpretation is based on the meaning of the verb in XXIX i iv I3-I5: GI?GESTIN-wa (I4) marahan katta SurkufS aramawa (15) Gi?mahluS Siyaizzi "As the vine produces roots below and schoots above". Since Kammenhuber has given ample evidence (Infinitiv-Studien, MIO II-IV) for the set of infinite forms in -atar, -anna?, -anna (cf. previously Giiterbock, IF 6o, 20o n. I) as against the real nouns in -atar with full declension, the entry in HW should be changed: Siyatar "seal" is a noun, whereas para SiyannaS is the genitive of the infinitive and should be listed under the verb. This also applies to other -atar infinitives in the HW. Suwaru (p. 201): It seems to me that one has to separate two words: one, in X 27 i 31, is a noun, designating a substance that is "let" into, or dissolved in, water. The text adduced by G6tze, NBr. 64 n. 3, KBo V 2 iii 42 ff., is not such a close parallel as to warrant identification with GISINIG; many different substances were used for such solutions. The second is either an adjective or an adverb and is sometimes written with the "Glossenkeil".</page><page sequence="9">Kitablar: Almanya The "marker" is preserved in MGK = KUB XXXVI 2 b ii 22, :su-u-wa-ru-pdt in broken context. From there it can be restored in the letter XXIII 85, 8, where the queen writes to Tattamaru (3 f.) as follows: (5) "You, Tattamaru, had taken the daughter of my sister for a wife. (6) Then the Fate Goddess became hostile to you (so that) she died on you. (7) Why do people say [th]us: akkantaS-wa L6tHADANU (8) [:?]u-wa-ru-pdt LfHADANU 'The hatanu of a dead one is ?uwaru a hatdnu'? You were my hatdnu." In the fragmentary continuation there seem to have followed reproaches (UL gakti, 9 and io), followed perhaps by admonitions or requests, now lost. For the uses of hatanu it is interesting to note that the queen applies this term to the husband of her niece, whereas in the quoted saying akkantal L6HADANU must be either "husband of a deceased woman" or "in-law through marriage with a deceased woman". The saying would make good sense if one could translate "is a true in-law" or "is truly an in-law". A similar meaning is suggested by the following passages from prayers: XXXI I27 i o f.: DUTU-uS Su-wa-ru mayanza (i ) DUMU DNIN . GAL "Sun God, suwaru grown-up son of Ningal", and the parallel passage in XXX io rev 7 f., partly restored by the duplicate ABoT 44a iii 4: [....] arha namma tittanut (D) [UTU-u]s Su-wa-a-ru mayanza (8) [DUMU DEN. Z]U 0 DNIN . GAL. Here one is tempted to translate, either, "truly grown-up son" or "legitimate, grown-up son"; for the latter cf. aplu kenu, Tallquist, Gotterepitheta p. 30. In XXI 38 obv. 3 su-wa-ru is in fragmentary context which, at least, does not preclude its being an adverb. dariya-, tar(r)iya-, tariyant-, dariyanu- (p. 213 f.): Goetze (in Sturtevant's Glossary) was certainly right in establishing one verb "to grow weary, take pains"; Gurney (AAA 27, Ioo) followed him and correctly stated (ibd. n. i) that the alleged dariya- "to invoke" is less well established. I tried to find out whether it is not possible to get through with the first verb alone. For XXIV 3 (Gurney C) ii 35 f., XXI 27 iv 38 ff., KBo IV 12 obv. 7 and XXVI 33 iii ii see Gurney, l.c. Into the same sphere belong XIV 7 iv i6 and XXI 19 iii 37 (same text, different conjugation!) and KBo VI 28 obv. 30 (fragmentary). Less clear are XII 63 obv. 9 and KBo II 8 i 26, though Gurney's translation "weary" seems possible. I would translate Hatt. iv 19 ff. as follows: "To those nobelmen whom Urhi-Tesub had banished, Istar appeared in a dream (saying): 'In vain do you take pains for yourself, (for) I, Istar, have (already) turned all the lands of Hatti to Hattusili's side!"'-In XXIV 9 iii 14 with duplicates (Gurney, n. I), after the SALU . GI has made wax images of the sorcerers and shown them to the patient, the text goes on: "Thus speaks the person (the patient): 'We grew weary, (but) then (reading namma) you have brought the images."' I do not understand XXX io rev. 4 and 34 iii 12; in XXI 38 obv. 37, finally, the reading seems to be i-ia-an-du rather than tar-ia-an-du (OLZ I930, 757), so that this text would be eliminated. The causative dariyanu- is more difficult. The old meaning "to invoke" is impossible in XVII 29 ii 9 ff.: "For the Storm God, the boundaries are (his) knee, the road is (his) breast. If some-one violates a boundary, he dariyanuzi the Storm God's knees; if some-one violates a road, he dariyanuzi the Storm God's breast." Here, "makes weary, sore, hurts" or the like is indicated. In the three passages where "invoke" seems to be a good translation for dariyanu- (the object being either a person or a deity) I wonder whether something like German "jemanden bemiihen" is not equally possible; in English this may be rendered by "to trouble some-one, to bother him, to prevail upon him". Tawagalawa ii 57 (AU p. io): "[If he] should somehow bother My Brother (saying) '[I shall go] to the king of Ha[tti], let him put me on my way!"'-BoTU 4 A iii 7 ff. (Naramsin story, ZA 44, 56, if the restoration is correct): "Istar replied to him: 'Go, purify yourself and sleep on a pure bed! [Bo]ther your own gods and pray to your own gods!"' Even in VII 60 iii 13, where "I invoked the Storm God, my lord" is perfectly good, "I prevailed upon" is equally possible. 358</page><page sequence="10">Books: Germany 359 It thus seems to me that uniting all examples under one common meaning is possible, though the non-existence of "invoke" cannot strictly be proved. tarra- (med.), tarranu- (p. 213): Since an interchange of simple stem and -ya- stem is frequent, and since spellings with both single and double r are attested for tar(r)iya?ha-, I tried to combine tarra-, tarranu- with the foregoing words. Whereas I was rather optimistic about this possibility when writing to Friedrich, I am much less so now. The passages known to me are these: KUB XIII 9 + VAT 14574 i i ff. (Otten, ZA 50, 236): When Tudhaliya IV returned from his campaign to Assuwa, his subjects addressed him as follows: (6) "O My Sun, our lord! You are a lahhiyala?! ("Kriegsheld" Otten, cf. HW 124; "traveller" Laroche, again in RA 48, 46) (7) nuwaSSan hannenanni (8) hannuwanzi U-UL tar-ra-at-ta. (9 f.) Behold, bad persons have annihilated [ .....]."-tarratta may be middle 2d pers. sing. present or preterit. In this context I tried to compare the phrase from prayers, nu hanne?na? pidi da-ri-ia-aS-ha-as?-ti-i NU GAL (XXXI 127 + ABoT 44 + XXXVI 79 i 24 f.) or nutta hanne?na? pidi tar-ri-ia-a?-ha-as NU GAL (XXIV 3 = AAA 27, 24 C i 48) "in the place of judgment there is no tiring of thine", and accord- ingly to translate "you d o n o t t i r e of giving judgment in court". However, taking the form as pret. and as referring to the time of the king's absence, one may just as well translate "you were not able to give judgment in court." XV i ii 13 ff.: kugmu kue? MAMETEME? ariyaS?enaz (14) kuitta GIM-an SI x SA-at nu kinun kuit (15) arha aniyauwanzi U-UL tar-ra-ah-ha-ri (I6) nukan kuitman apiya EGIR-panda (I7) kuitmannaSza arha BAL-ahhi.... "Concerning these oaths, what was determined by oracle for each of them, since I do n o t tire of making good for them, or, since I am n o t able to make good for them, as long as I look after that matter and until I complete the offerings, ...."; here both interpretations seem possible. Kup. i 9 f. (Staatsv. I io6 f.): "But my father was in another country (io) nas U- UL tar-ra-ad-da-at and did not take care of him." Friedrich translates "sorgte sich(??) nicht", which would be our "took no pains", but "he was not able" is also possible. The causative tarranu- presents more difficulties. Concerning the phrase nu utne harninkiSkit nu utne arha tarranut of the Proclamation of Telipinu, i 7, I7, 27, I confess that the examples given by Zuntz, Ortsadv. 39 f. for arha turning the sense of a verb into its opposite, on which Sommer (HAB 192 n. 5) based his "entmachten", did not convince me and that I tried "he annihilated the countries and completely exhausted the countries". However, in the other passage for tarranu-, KBo III 2I = BoTU 6 ii 4, this latter sense does not fit at all. (i f.) "He gave his Enlil-ship to thee, and completed the glorification(?) and rule of the gods for thee. (3 ff.) Then to the Great Gods in the assembly he tarranut thy gul-aS-Salta, and he put into thy hand (the ability) to seize the soul of the land(s)". Whatever gul(a)?aa(?) may be-one would like to connect it with the verb "to draw, write"-, anything like "make weary, exhaust" would be out of place, whereas Sommer's "machtig machen" comes close to what is expected. As a result, I can no longer maintain what is given under my name in the HW for tarra(nu)-. tarhudu, tarhuzzi (p. 213), taruh- (p. 217): I fully agree with Goetze (JAOS 74, I90) that the verbs tarhu(i)- (tar-hu-du KBo IV 2 i 54 in contrast to tar-ah-zi 52 and tar-ah-ha-an har-zi 53; tar-hu-e-er XXIII 79 obv. 12; tar-hu-id-du XXXVI 75 iv io) and tar(r)uh- (ta-ru-uh-zi Law ? 50; tar-ru-uh-ha-an-zi KUB VII i ii 9) are to be separated from tarh-, although I cannot offer a trans- lation. tar-hu-uz-zi in the Telipinu Myth A = XVII IO i 33 may be a noun in -uzzi: nu UL tarhuzzi hasi may mean "he does not (= cannot) open the t. (lock?)". Goetze, ANET 126, translates the same sentence "but he is not there and opens not" (JCS VI ioI "but not being in, he does (not) open"). Whether the form is nominal or verbal will be decided when the meaning of the verb tarhu- is determined. dasseS- (p. 2I8): For interpretation as -eS- verb from daSgu- see above under pargawe?-; for the context, above under hantiya(i)-.</page><page sequence="11">Kitablar: Almanya (:)upati (p. 235): The meaning "fief, feudal holding(?)" was proposed as one that seemed to fit the Hittite as well as the "Cappadocian" and Ugaritic words. ::-pa-ti KBo IV io obv. 30 designates localities belonging to a town as dependencies or the like: (28 end) "From (i.e., in the direction of) the high mountain, (29) Saliya is its frontier (in such a way that) Saliya belongs to Hatti; but outside it (is) Walwara and (30) whatever upati (belongs) to Walwara, (namely) Mata, Sanbada, Larimma, Saranduwa, (and) DattasSi; (31) to what point, however, a weapon carries from the border of Saranduwa, that belongs to the country of the river Iulaya." In KBo VII 14 obv. 1o f., each u-ba-a-ti belongs to a man whose name, in the genitive, precedes. Whether some (or all) of the ubati are objects to takkilit "he surrounded" (io) or to [mKa]rah- nuiliyaS DUMU-ag appan da-a-[a?] "the son of K. afterwards too[k]" (12), they may very well be territorial units, the feudal holdings of the persons named (in spite of Laroche's doubts, OLZ 1955, 225). Among the festivals listed in XIII 4 i 44 (Sturtevant, Chrest. 15o) there is a festival of "the men of upati", which ties in with the upati of certain men just quoted and with "Capp." upatinnu, which seems to be some organization or body. The other passages are too fragmentary (KBo II I2 vi 3, 7; XIII 9 i 1i; XXXII 87 rev. 20). In XXVI 23 (a fragment of KBo V I1) the phrase in ii 15 may mean "and he calls the ubati and the LI . DUGUD by name"; here, the ubati may be the territory belonging to the Li . DUGUD. -For Ugaritic see now Gordon, Ugaritic Manual (AnOr. 35) p. 231, Glossary No. Io. *wahatar (p. 240): This is another case of a verbal -annas form, i.e., a genitive of the infinitive. The listing on p. 251, under the verb, is therefore better than that under a special lemma; note the form wehuwaS, genitive of the other set of infinitives. "Kriegswagenpferde" is an interpretation rather than a translation: I do not want to be quoted for *wahatar "war chariot"! The interpretation is based on the following: the reason for calling horses the delivery of which is part of the feudal duties, "horses of turning" can only be seen in the fact that in hippological texts a "round" is called wahnumar (HW 241). That wahnumar is from the causative, whereas wahannaS is from the simple verb, is no obstacle: wahnu- is what the trainers do to the horses; what the horses themselves do on the track is weh-. "Horses of turning" then are horses that were trained in rounds on the track, trained horses, that is, trained as chariot horses. DUMU (p. 269), TUR (p. 297) and their derivatives: I tried to distinguish between cases where the ideogram refers to age and those where it designates a relation. In Sumerian it should be read TUR in the first, DUMU in the second case. In English (and German), "child" (Kind) is used in both senses, "son" (Sohn) only in the second. Hatt. i 9 "My father had four children (DUMU. MES)", but line 12 "as long as I was still a child (TUR-ag)". The "boy" who is wearing a goat's skin and howling like a wolf (IX 31 ii I f.) is a TUR. NITA; "Tudhaliya the Younger" in the Plague Prayers is TUR-RI (K1F I I64, 12) and TtR-RU (p. 166, I3), Akkadian sehruli; and so on. In Hittite, however, the complements are the same, -(l)a-, in both meanings, and also with NITA; some examples are given in HW. It may be that Hittite had only one word which, like "child", had both functions. 1 . NA4 (DINGIR-LIM) (p. 270): That this is the last resting place of the bones of a deceased is known from the Ritual for the Dead (ZA 46, 220 f. n. 2 and p. 223 f.; a new edition by Otten is forthcoming). For the "bedroom (E . gA) in the Stone House" see ibid. For speculations about the origin of the name "Stone House" for a mausoleum, about its relation to E hegti- (cf. Goetze, JAOS 74, I89) and about possible candidates among known monuments, see MDOG 86, 74 ff. (esp. 76 n. 2). A spelling NA,-an parnag was added by Otten, OLZ 1955, 391; the complement -ni, XIII 8 obv. 2, is for Akkadian bit abni. What the addition DINGIR-LIM "of the god" may mean can only be guessed. It does not alter the meaning essentially. Pending further evidence, it seems permitted to take it as an allusion to the deification of a king. If so, l . NA4 would be "mausoleum" in general, and E . NA4 DINGIR-LIM would be "royal mausoleum". 36o</page><page sequence="12">Books: Germany LI . SAG (p. 283): My suggestion that this official was an eunuch was primarily based on the regulations for LIl. ME . SAG, XXVI i etc. and XXVI I2 etc., now transliterated and translated by von Schuler, AfO Beiheft io, as "SAG i" and "SAG 2". Leaving aside those rules that apply to all officials, namely, those demanding loyalty, the ones that are specific show that the LI . SAG was close to the person of the king (SAG i ? io = XXVI 8 ii 3 ff.; ? 20 end = I iii 23 ff.; SAG 2 ? 26 = XXVI I2 iv 33 ff.); he had access to the P . SA "bedroom" or "harem" (SAG 2 ? 24 = XXI 42 iv 3 ff., the first well-preserved section of the part dealing with the LI . SAG which begins, after a double rule, with ? 22); and he was employed in matters pertaining to women (SAG i ? 30 = XXVI I iv II ff., where the king asks him about a memiyaS ... SA SAL-TI; SAG 2 ? 31 = XXI 42 l.e., where he is sent out ANA INIM SAL-TI). Once this was recognized, the analogy of Akkadian Sa reii, short for ga ris sarri "(the man) of the head = person (of the king)", seemed obvious. The literal meaning of the Akkadian title reflects the same concern with the king's person that we found in the Hittite texts, whereas in practice sa rei, as is well known, means "eunuch" (cf., apart from the loanword saris in Hebrew, Weidner, AfO XVII 264). Further- more, the very ideogram LI . SAG "man of the head" is very close to the Akkadian term. It is my feeling, therefore, that von Schuler was over-cautious in his discussion of the term (op. cit. P. 34 f.). Final proof comes now from a Sultantepe vocabulary, the knowledge of which I owe to the members of the Assyrian Dictionary staff; it is now published by Landsberger and Gurney, "igi- dub-a == tmartu, short version", AfO XVIII 8I ff., and offers in line 232 the equation LUI. SAG = sd ri-Su. Incidentally, I think that the title LIl. 1 . SA "man of the bedroom" of Suppiluliuma's envoy to the widow of Tut-ankh-Amon (KBo V 6 iii 21 with dupl., JCS X 95) also means the same as Turkish harem agass, namely, "eunuch"; cf. the employment of the LI . SAG in the foreign service (SAG i ?? 22, 26 and probably also SAG 2 ? 3I). NIG. GUB, NfG. KI . GUB (p. 288): The first term describes animal figures and has the complement -(an)za (KBo III i 29; 34; I6 obv. II; KUB XII 2 ii 5) and once -as (KBo II I iv 3); it is parallel to GUB-anza "standing", said of anthropomorphic figures (Bildb. No. I i 2i etc.). The second term applies to animal figures (Bildb. No. 2 ii 6; iv I9) and to BIBRU in animal form (Bildb. No. 2 i 30; No. 3 i 2), which are in contrast to BIBRU GI . . ., vessels in the shape of the neck of an animal (von Brandenstein, Bildb. p. 24). This contrast implies that the BIBRU GUD "GAR". KI . GUB is a vessel in the shape of the whole animal which, if "standing" (GUB), would naturally stand on its four legs. I confess that it is hard to interpret the combination of signs syntactically if "GAR" were the figure "4"; but the fact that it only occurs with animals, whereas human figures are simply GUB-ant-, seems to point in this direction. "GAR" . GUB and "GAR". KI . GUB seem to be the same; one might take the KI as "ground": "standing (on the) ground (with) four (legs)", but this is mere speculation. Against the interpretation "Gestell" is the fact that in two of the Bildb. passages (No. 2 i 31 and No. 3 i 4) a GI?palzaSha- "pedestal" is expressly mentioned. Since "standing" is arant- in Hittite, I wonder whether X 89 i 20 f. should not be connected with the ideograms discussed here. In the sentence LUGAL SAL. LUGAL TUS-ag DZABABA ISTU BIBRI UR. MAUI (2I) "GAR" a-ra-an-ta-et akuwanzi, "GAR" aranret has been taken as equivalent of NINDA a-a-an-te-et with "superfluous" -r-. Obviously one cannot "drink with a hot bread". Since, however, arantet is in agreement with ISTU BIBRI, a translation "with a lion BIBRU standing (on) four (feet)" would make good sense, if, again, the syntax of the numeral could be explained. An unpublished text may help a little in this direction: I noted from Bo 6514 iv 3 f. the phrase ISTU BIBRI GUD. AMAR "GAR"-i[t ....?] arantet (the trace after "GAR" is the beginning of it or da). The instrumental arantet again agrees with ISTU BIBRI; is 4-i[t ....] an additional instrumental, "standing with four [legs" ?

In VBoT I, 36, Miss Rost did not take Knudtzon's reading into consideration, although the unpublished 336/f, I6 (her point 6), i-NU GISar-pa GI?ESI provides a parallel. The proposal (p. 340) to take the pa-na[-... ] which follows in Arz. as BA-NA[-A] is good. S. Alp's article "Zu den K6rperteilnamen im Hethitischen", Anatolia (Revue annuelle de l'Institut d'Archeologie de l'Universit6 d'Ankara) II 1 ff., includes some of the words treated here. For (vzU)hupalla?-, our "scalp", Alp (p. 6) proposes "skull". His argument that ger would make no sense with "scalp" does not carry conviction and could also be applied to "skull"; contrast his translation with ours. The connection with "net" is easier for "scalp" than for "skull". For panduha- (Alp, p. 24 f.) the reason for preferring "stomach" to "bladder" falls if our inter- pretation of kamar?- (above) is correct. For GI?patalha-, Alp (p. 32 ff.) proposes "anklet", which may be correct. Note that Gaster's interpretation of the dream of Kessi (above) comes very close to this notion. Even so, the result is not final in my opinion. Professer Friedrich informs me that a fascicle of Nachtrage to his HW is in the press. Chicago, Oriental Institute H. G. Giiterbock WILHELM VON BODE-ERNST KOjHNEL, Vorderasiatische Kniipfteppiche aus alter Zeit. Vierte, vollstandig umgearbeitete Auflage. - Braunschweig, Klinkhardt und Biermann 1955. 4?, 167 pp. with 122 text figs. and 4 color pls. This is the fourth edition of the classic handbook on the ancient oriental rug. The first version, by von Bode alone, appeared in I902 and it was republished and extended by Ktihnel in I9I4 and again in 1922. This newest edition, the first after von Bode's death in I929, presents itself again in a more enlarged, but still very handy form offering now 122 instead of the 95 black and white illustrations of the previous edition and 4 color plates instead of one. Unlike the third edition, the reader will find it easier to follow the arguments as the text and illustrations are again printed together. Besides these and other physical improvements the value of the book is greatly enhanced by the skillful reworking of the text. The old monograph form in which the carpets in each of the major regions was treated according to the organization of the field and decorative scheme is kept, but the order is changed. The book starts with the Turkish group which contains the oldest pieces instead of giving first place to the Persian carpets which are the most sumptuous and biggest- the order now being Anatolia, Caucasus, Egypt, Persia, and India. The publication represents, therefore, a happy medium between a historical and a morphological presentation of the material. There are also many other changes which bring the text up to date. Many carpets are published for the first time, while in some cases the ominous word "destroyed" had to be put into the cap- tions of well-known pieces referring to the disastrous fire in a Berlin depository at the end of the war. 362</page></plain_text>
