<plain_text><page sequence="1">ABRAHAM, ADAM, AND THE THEME OF EXILE IN PARADISE LOST BY MOTHER MARY CHRISTOPHER PECHEUX, O.S.U. AAMONG THE Biblical types which Milton used to enrich his theme in Paradise Lost was that of Abraham, father of the faithful. James Sims has shown the parallel between the visit of the angels to Abraham at Mamre and Raphael's descent to Eden in Book v; John Parish has elaborated the resemblance between Abraham's plea for the Sodomites and Adam's dialogue with God in Book viii; and Barbara Lewalski has emphasized the spiritual vision of the man of faith in Books xi and xii: Abraham and his heirs view the promises "afar off," just as Adam at this point sees far off the great symbolic Old Testament places.' It is the pur- pose of this article to explore further the Abra- ham-Adam parallel in the last two books, show- ing in particular the relationship between Abraham's departure from Ur and Adam's from Paradise. From this relationship flow certain effects: the tone of the concluding episodes of Paradise Lost becomes clearer, their universal significance is emphasized, and the exile motif is harmonized with the concept of the journey of the epic hero. The virtues of Abraham are precisely those which Adam as Christian hero is called upon to practice, while both Abraham's setting forth to the land of Canaan and Adam's exile from Paradise are types of man's setting forth on his earthly pilgrimage. Of the importance of Abraham's role in the last two books there can be no doubt. The lines devoted to him form one of the most significant parts of Michael's account (as of Adam's educa- tion), and the reiterated theme of "Abraham's seed" serves to keep him well within the reader's conscious focus. For the central passage discuss- ing him Milton has chosen from the episodes recounted in Genesis not the one that is perhaps best known-the sacrifice of Isaac-but the more fundamental one of the calling of Abraham and his response in faith and love. Summoned to leave his country, he departs at once, trusting in the God who called him-even as Adam is called upon to set out, at the end of the poem, on his long journey through the centuries. If the full artistic value of this parallel is to be exploited, we should expect to find in Paradise Lost certain elements: first, an emphasis on the departure from Eden as a test; second, a resem- blance between the treatment of Adam here and the traditional treatment of Abraham; and third, a reinforcement through the mingling of the two of the universal nature of Adam's experi- ence. The announcement to Adam of his sentence of banishment is presented as a crucial test-the first important choice he must make after the Fall. If he submits to it in the proper dispositions, he is to be consoled, but the great revelation is to be contingent on the nature of the response: it is only "if" he obeys patiently that Michael is commissioned to "reveal / To Adam what shall come in future days" (xi.112-114).2 In any case he must go forth, "sorrowing," but whether the saving phrase "yet in peace" is to be a reality depends on his own reaction. Milton takes pains to underline the importance of the event by using the device of exact repetition. God says: "to remove him I decree, / And send him from the Garden forth to Till / The Ground whence he was taken, fitter soil" (xi.96-98); Michael echoes the lines, changing only the personal pronouns (xi.260-262). Newton remarked that the words are repeated because "the catastrophe of the poem depends so much upon them, and by them the fate of Man is determined, and Paradise is lost."3 To this we might add that on their reception by Adam depends the emotional tone and the thematic emphasis of the conclusion of the poem. Between God's decree and Michael's delivery of it has intervened Eve's pathetically mistaken "Here let us live, though in fall'n state, content" (1. 180), the irony of which heightens the effect of the impact of the sentence on Adam. He is "heart-strook" (1. 307); the chill of exile has already touched him, as he sees in anticipation the world outside, inhospitable and desolate, "nor knowing us nor known." But he passes the test, acknowledging the supremacy of God and I James H. Sims, The Bible in Milton's Epics (Gaines- ville, Fla., 1962), pp. 202-204, 210-211; John E.

He speaks with humility and even, after Michael's first en- couraging words, with gratitude. At the end of the scene his ascent with the angel to the hill of vision is almost a rehearsal for the final expulsion to the trackless expanse beyond Eden: To whom thus Adam gratefully repli'd. Ascend, I follow thee, safe Guide, the path Thou lead'st me, and to the hand of Heav'n submit, However chast'ning, to the evil turn My obvious breast, arming to overcome By suffering, and earn rest from labor won, If so I may attain. (xi.370-376)4 The note of resignation and confidence here is part of a complex pattern closely linked with the exile-journey motif. The uncertainties of life's path have been mirrored in a series of literal and metaphorical references to wandering which ex- tend from Adam's reference to life as a journey- "Till we end / In dust, our final rest and native home" (x. 1084-85)-to Michael's declaration that the visions will help Adam to endure his "mortal passage" (xi.366) when it comes. Eve speaks both literally and metaphorically when she promises that she will never again "stray" from Adam's side (xi.176), which had been her native home, as dust was Adam's. Soon they are both to learn that their ultimate destiny is higher than anything material. Now, however, it is the nuptial bower which seems to her the highest bliss: from thee How shall I part, and whither wander down Into a lower World, to this obscure And wild. (xi.281-284) The metaphorical meaning had been dominant in Adam's soliloquy in Book x: his "evasions" (with the literal Latin meaning forcing its way through) move in "Mazes" (11. 829-830) and find no way (1. 844); he speaks of Eve's "wand' ring" vanity (1. 875), and she later acknowledges that her words had been "erroneous" (x.969). The connotations of helplessness, of lack of guidance in unknown territory, inherent in the term "wander" must have formed a large part of the grief of this first exile, as it has of many since. In contrast, Adam, in the speech just quoted, follows a safe guide on a secure path and looks forward, though still hesitantly-"if so I may attain"-to rest at the end. Milton gives a further qualification to the sense of helplessness associated with exile and wandering: what seems to man aimless move- ment may be in fact the following of a sure way marked out by Providence. Adam, beholding the vision of the Flood, laments that the few human beings left must surely perish, "wand'ring that wat'ry Desert" (xi.779). But the reader knows what at the moment Adam does not: that this catastrophe is part of God's plan; that the ark will come to a firm resting place and that from it a world will be restored. The ark only seems to be wandering. The phrase looks forward, more- over, to the passages describing the history of the Israelites in the desert and to the magnificently concise summary of that wandering and its meaning in salvation history: But Joshua whom the Gentiles Jesus call, His Name and Office bearing, who shall quell The adversary Serpent, and bring back Through the world's wilderness long wander'd man Safe to eternal Paradise of rest. (xii.310-314) This, not dust, is to be the final goal of Adam's journey. Adam's acceptance of the sentence of exile con- stitutes the first stage of his moral ascent. One of the first effects of his sin had been the desire to escape from God's presence-"hide me from the face / Of God, whom to behold was then my highth / Of happiness"-(x.723-725); now the first effect of his submission is a renewed ap- preciation of the "Presence divine" and a fear that he will be even more removed from it: This most afflicts me, that departing hence, As from his face I shall be hid, depriv'd His blessed count'nance; . * **.. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . * *. * *. . . . ......... In yonder nether World where shall I seek His bright appearances, or footstep trace? For though I fled him angry, yet recall'd To life prolong'd and promis'd Race, I now Gladly behold though but his utmost skirts Of glory, and far off his steps adore. (xi.315-317, 328-333) The words recall Cain's after the murder of Abel: "Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face shall I be hid" (Gen. iv.14).5 But they also recall God's injunction to Abraham: "Walk before me, and be thou perfect. I will make my covenant between me and thee, and will multiply thee exceedingly" (Gen. xvii.2). Michael gives as- I Eve's "lead on" in xii.614 balances Adam's "I follow thee" in the present passage, and the last four lines of the poem have several verbal echoes: the "safe Guide" here is re- placed by "Providence thir guide"; the "path" becomes the "solitary way" through Eden; the rest to be won from labor the "place of rest." As Adam turns here to face the evil, so the pair turn away from Paradise to the world at the end. 5 Biblical quotations in this article are from the King James version.

U. 367 surance of God's continued presence: Yet doubt not but in Valley and in Plain God is as here, and will be found alike Present, and of his presence many a sign Still following thee, still compassing thee round With goodness and paternal Love, his Face Express, and of his steps the track Divine. (xi.349-354) At the conclusion of the visions and prophecies Adam declares that he has learned "to walk / As in his presence" (xii.562-563) and has under- stood the meaning of the virtues which con- stitute perfection for him and his descendants. The visions are given partly as a consolation and partly as a guide to right action; hence Michael explains that they will confirm his faith- "Which that thou may'st believe, and be con- firm'd" (xI.355) and will teach him "patience" and "moderation." At the culmination of his education he has grown not only in his under- standing of the plan of redemption but also in his knowledge and acceptance of the demands on his cooperation made by this plan: like his descendants, he must embrace the offered benefit by "Faith not void of works" (xiI.427). When he departs, "greatly instructed," he enumerates the virtues whose meaning and necessity he has learned: intellectual humility, obedience, love, filial fear, awareness of God's presence, trust in His providence, meekness, patience, fortitude- all with the conviction that to the faithful death is the gate of life (xii.557-571). It is the finished picture of the better fortitude of patience and heroic martyrdom which Milton has come to see as the character of the Christian hero. In the light of these notions we may examine the long passage (lines 111-154) in Book xii dealing directly with Abraham. Michael relates how God, determining to select a peculiar nation "from one faithful man to spring," calls Abraham by a vision. His response is one of obedience and faith: he straight obeys, Not knowing to what Land, yet firm believes: I see him, but thou canst not, with what Faith He leaves his Gods, his Friends, and native Soil ... Not wand'ring poor, but trusting all his wealth With God, who call'd him, in a land unknown. (xII.126-134) The obedience and the faith mentioned here are the very qualities which Adam too must dis- play-the qualities he had failed to show in his first fateful choice and which the Second Adam is to present in their perfection. Abraham is "not wand'ring" precisely because he trusts, even though he is going forth to an unknown land. The passage ends with the bestowal on Abraham of his distinctive epithet: "this Patriarch blest, / Whom faithful Abraham due time shall call" (11. 151-152). We are to think here, of course, not only of the chapters in Genesis but also of the encomium in Hebrews xi.8-10: By faith Abraham, when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive as an inheritance, obeyed; and he went out not knowing whither he went, By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as in a strange country, dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise: For he looked for a city which hath foundations, whose builder and maker is God. Here we see the obedience-and-faith theme merging with that of the Pilgrimage of Man, with its familiar concomitants of exile and search.6 The theme of the Christian as a wanderer and exile on earth, a pilgrim on his way to the heavenly fatherland, has been one of the most pervasive in Christian literature, as it was one of the earliest. There are hints of it in several New Testament passages; the second-century Epistle to Diognetus speaks of Christians as men who dwell in their native countries as though aliens; every foreign land is their home, and the land of their birth is foreign soil.7 It is an im- portant motif in St. Augustine's City of God: "For the city of the saints is above, though it have citizens here upon earth, wherein it lives as a pilgrim until the time of the kingdom come, and then it gathers all the citizens together in the resurrection of the body and gives them a kingdom to reign in with their King for ever and ever."8 This detachment from the things of earth does not necessarily run counter to the ideals of humanism; rather the Christian humanist can use things as if he used them not. It is a detach- ment, not a repudiation. On that detachment, however, Milton insists; it is the key to his attitude towards Greek learning in Paradise Re- gained. Abraham had to leave behind him friends and gods and native soil; Adam, who, to some extent, though less than Eve, attached too much importance to the physical Garden, must be warned of his mistake. The culmination of the 6 The main verb of the second sentence, usually rendered as "sojourned," itself emphasizes in Greek the ideas of transitoriness and non-citizenship; see the discussion of the term in a note on Clement's "Epistle to the Corinthians," ed. James A. Kleist, in Ancient Christian Writers, I (West- minster, Md., 1949), 103-104. Clement's "Epistle" opens with a similar phrase: "The Church of God which resides as a stranger at Rome" (p. 9). 7 Ed. James A. Kleist, Ancient Christian Writers, vi (1948), 139. Cf.

(xi.829-831, 836-837) Of this detachment based on faith Abraham's journey was the example par excellence, widely exploited in Christian tradition. Thus Irenaeus calls him the father of all who follow the WVord of God and, bearing all things, sustain their pilgrimage in this world;9 John Chrysostom con- trasts his readiness to move and settle in a new place with the attachment of those who dwell in exile as if in their fatherland; he praises the promptness of his obedience, his patience, forti- tude, and gratitude to God.'0 Ambrose, who wrote a whole treatise on Abraham, dwells at length on his many virtues." Origen develops the idea allegorically: what was said to Abraham is said also to us who are his children: if we leave our own land (meaning our evil inclinations), we shall reach the land the Lord shows us.'2 One of the most extended treatments in this vein was that of Philo Judaeus. Since Milton certainly knew this writer, since he mentions him with something like respect, and since Philo was one of the greatest influences on Origen and the other ante-Nicene Fathers whom Milton quotes most often, his treatises may be taken as representa- tive of the connotations which Abraham probably had in Milton's mind.'3 Philo's two treatises "On Abraham" and "On the Migration of Abraham," together with some extended passages in "Who Is the Heir," develop at somewhat fantastic lengths the lessons to be drawn from the Biblical accounts. Many of his points, however, are legitimate extensions of the tvpology which, in Milton's eyes, could claim the sanction of St. Paul.'4 Philo sees Abraham as the virtue-loving soul in search of the true God and as a symbol of virtue acquired by teach- ing,'5 much as Milton shows Adam learning, through the visions and revelations transmitted by Michael, the fundamental virtues he must practice. Again, Philo remarks that God's first gift is the showing of things immortal and His second progress in the principles of virtue;"6 this might correspond to the visions Adam sees and his recognition, through them, of what his re- sponse must be. Adam's awareness of the direc- tion of Providence can be paralleled by Philo's explanation of the result of Abraham's call: "Then opening the soul's eye as though after profound sleep, and beginning to see the pure beam instead of the deep darkness, he followed the ray and discerned what he had not beheld before, a charioteer and pilot presiding over the world and directing in safety his own work . . ." 9 Contra Haereses, iv.xxv.1, in Migne, Patrologia Graeca (hereafter cited as PG), vii, 1050. 10 Genesis Homiliae, xlv.1 (PG, LIV, 414-415), xl.2 (PG, Liii, 370-371), xxxi.3-5 (PG, LIII, 286-287). 11 De Abraham, in Migne, Patrologia Latina, xiv, 441-524. 12 Commentarium in Joannem, xx.10, 13 (PG, xiv, 591, 594, 606-607). 13 In the First Defence, ch. ii, Milton speaks of "another solid authority, Josephus' contemporary Philo Judaeus, one very studious in the law of Moses, upon the whole of which he wrote an extensive commentary . . ." (The Works of John Milton, Columbia Edition [hereafter cited as C.E.], vii, 79). In the Doctrine and Discipline of Divorce, iiii, he himself uses "an allegory something different from that in Philo Judaeus concerning Amaleck, though haply more significant ..." (C.E., ini, 435). The breadth of Milton's reading obviously makes it impossible to contend that any one writer was the source of any one idea, but the presence in Paradise Lost of many of the implications contained also in Philo at least in- dicates the existence of a body of interpretation which fit perfectly into the framework of the epic. For a discussion of the widespread influence of Philo, see Harry F. Robins, If This Be Heresy: A Study of Milton and Origen (Urbana, Ill. 1963), pp. 17-19, 28. 14 Milton's attitude towards typology is expressed in the Christian Doctrine I.30: "No passage of Scripture is to be in- terpreted in more than one sense; in the Old Testament, however, this sense is sometimes a compound of the historical and typical, as in Hosea xi.1 compared with Matt. ii.15. 'out of Egypt have I called my son,' which may be explained in a double sense, as referring partly to the people of Israel, and partly to Christ in his infancy" (C.E., xvi, 263). For a com- parison of this passage with an almost identical one in Wol- leb's Compenidium see Maurice Kelley, "Milton's Debt to Wolleb," PMLA, L (1935), 158. For a discussion of Milton's views on typology see H. R. MacCallum, "Milton and Figurative Interpretation of the Bible," UTQ, xxxi (1962), 397-415, especially 407-409. Milton would certainly have admitted a type so well established in the New Testament as Abraham: in addition to many references in such symbolic terms as father of the faithful, St. Paul says specifically in Gal. iv.24 that the Abraham-Hagar-Ishmael story is "by way of allegory." Milton himself uses Abraham as a figure of divine election in CD i.xvii (C.E. xv, 351), as an example of faith and patience in i.viii (C.E. xv, 87) and of obedience in II.iii (C.E. xvii, 69). There is a difference, which Milton un- doubtedly recognized, between typology and allegory, and I think he would not have attached any doctrinal importance to Philo's interpretations; but he was not above using them, as has been seen, for polemic purposes, or a fortiori for poetic reasons. 15 On Abraham, xv.68 and xi.52; pp. 39, 31.

U. 369 Faith and obedience in accepting God's com- mands demand also the more concrete virtues of patience and fortitude. Philo, like Milton, sees the apparent insecurity of the path of exile: "The second migration which the man of worth undertakes, again in obedience to an oracle, is not as before from state to state but into a desert country in which he continued to wander, never complaining of the wandering or the insecurity which it caused."'18 Like Milton too he perceives that the knowledge of a loving Providence could temper such insecurity: "And further, the mere leaving of his fatherland, to emigrate without any possibility of dwelling there again, to be borne hither and thither and to wander over desolate and untrodden roads were in itself a grievous war for one who had no divine message or promise wherein to trust."19 Abraham jour- neyed as the Lord spoke to him; that is, explains Philo, the just man "walks in the track of right reason and follows God, mindful of his injunc- tions," always and everywhere in action and in speech.20 This resembles Adam's last speech: Henceforth I learn, that to obey is best, And love with fear the only God, to walk As in his presence, ever to observe His providence, and on him sole depend. (xii.561-564)2' The nature of true knowledge is another im- portant point for both Philo and Milton: "Quit, then, your meddling with heavenly concerns, and take up your abode . . . in yourselves."22 This is the first lesson which Adam draws from Michael's instruction: Greatly instructed I shall hence depart, Greatly in peace of thought, and have my fill Of knowledge, what this Vessel can contain; Beyond which was my folly to aspire. (xII.557-560) Self-knowledge is of more avail than curious searching into the secrets of the universe: "What, then, is the end of right-mindedness? To pronounce on himself and all created being the verdict of folly . . . For pray do not, 0 ye sense- less ones, spin your airy fables about moon or sun or the other objects in the sky and in the universe so far removed from us and so varied in their natures, until you have scrutiinized and come to know yourselves."23 Michael's words to Adam sound a similar note: This having learnt, thou hast attain'd the sum Of wisdom; hope no higher, though all the Stars Thou knew'st by name, and all th'ethereal Powers, All secrets of the deep, all Nature's works, Or works of God in Heav'n, Air, Earth, or Sea. (xii.575-579) Milton seems to have made some use of another link between Abraham and Adam in his oblique reference to John viii.56: "Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day: and he saw it, and was glad." Adam's first exclamation of joy as he begins to understand is something of a paraphrase of this text: Here Adam interpos'd. 0 sent from Heav'n, Enlight'ner of my darkness, gracious things Thou hast reveal'd, those chiefly which concern Just Abrakam and his Seed: now first I find Mine eyes true op'ning, and my heart much eas'd, Erewhile perplext with thoughts what would become Of mee and all Mankind; but now I see His day, in whom all Nations shall be blest. (xII.270-277) In the coming of the Savior he himself has a part to play, for he is father of the race, as Abraham is father of the Chosen People. Obedience, faith, patience, fortitude, the vir- tues demanded of Adam as of Abraham, are likewise the virtues of the Christian wayfarer throughout all time. For both Adam and Abra- ham their departure was a test; for both, it was to lead to a new destiny rich in promise. Tne parallel between them seems to lend force and credibility to the paradox of the "felix culpa" and to suggest its operation throughout the course of time. The separation from familiar surroundings, the hardships of the journey, the completely changed way of life are a cause of sorrow, but the assurance of God's presence and guidance brings peace; the blind advance into the unknown is rewarded with a paradise happier far. As Milton drew near the close of his epic, broadening its scope to include all space and all time, deepening it to focus on the paradise within, he must have welcomed the opportunity to universalize his theme by associating it with the multiple ambivalences of the typology of Abraham. The close association of Abraham and Adam seems, then, to be borne out by the available evidence. If this relationship is extended to in- clude Sarah and Eve, we can perhaps find an explanation for a rather puzzling aspect of the scene in Paradise Lost in which the exile is announced. Eve's retirement behind a tree and her inept revealing of her hiding place by her 18 Abr., xviiI.85 (Loeb, vi, 47). 19 Who Is the Heir, LVIII, 287 (Loeb, iv, 431). 20 Migr.

And her retirement is insufficiently motivated: Adam tells her to retire in order not to offend the heavenly visitant, but it is not clear why Eve's presence would be out of place; she is fallen now, it is true, as she was not when Raphael came; but so is Adam. It seems possible that Milton might have intended to evoke here Sarah's somewhat similar concealment and her unexpected dis- covery as related in Genesis xviii. Mr. Sims has shown, convincingly I think, that the visit to Abraham on the plains of Mamre underlies Adam's reception of Raphael in Book v;24 the transfer of this particular part of the Biblical episode to Book xi would thus have been pre- pared for. According to the narrative in Genesis, Sarah, who is listening just inside the entrance of the tent, hears the heavenly visitor prophesy that she will have a son. Since she is past the age for childbearing, "Sarah laughed within herself. ... And the Lord said to Abraham, 'Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, "Shall I of a surety bear a child, which am old?" Is anything too hard for the Lord?' . . . Then Sarah denied, saying, 'I laughed not': for she was afraid. And he said, 'Nay, but thou diddest laugh"' (xviii.10-15). The situations are obviously not exactly parallel, for Sarah reveals her hiding place by a laugh, Eve by a lament. Yet the overall effects are similar. Both are ironic: Sarah, hearing that she is to bear a son, expresses incredulity, un- aware that this announcement is in truth the first step in the generation of the children of Abraham, the Chosen People; Eve, learning of her impending exile, expresses grief, unaware that the departure from Eden is the first step on the long road of salvation history which will eventually bring the spiritual children of Abra- ham back to a new heaven and a new earth. Milton may well be using here the principle of ironic disparity to reinforce once more his theme of good coming from evil.25 Eve's lament, like Sarah's laugh, shows a humanly understandable reaction but an imper- fect apprehension of divine things; after the angel's response, although both narratives turn then to other matters, presumably in both cases belief and rejoicing ensue. As Philo comments: "The mind, which was about to be filled with joy and divine laughter, had not yet been freed from sorrow, fear, sense-pleasure and desire, by which it is shaken and compelled to stagger." "For sorrowful and suffering is he from whom God is distant, and full of joy and gladness is he to whom He is near."26 Michael's response to Eve gently corrects her viewpoint and sug- gests the role she is to play in the future: Lament not Eve, but patiently resign What justly thou hast lost; nor set thy heart, Thus over-fond, on that which is not thine; Thy going is not lonely, with thee goes Thy Husband, him to follow thou art bound; Where he abides, think there thy native soil. (xi.287-292) The last three lines are especially rich in as- sociations. Like Eve's final speech in Book xii, they recall Ruth's words to Naomi; they suggest also the theme of the Christian exile; and, if the parallel with Sarah is valid, they are linked with the development of her character as a devoted wife: "She showed her wifely love by numberless proofs, by sharing with him the severance from his kinsfolk, by bearing without hesitation the departure from her homeland, the continual and unceasing wanderings on a foreign soil and privation in famine, and by the campaigns in which she accompanied him. Everywhere and always she was at his side, no place or occasion omitted, his true partner in life and life's events, resolved to share alike the good and ill."27 The association of Adam with Abraham in Books xi and xii, then, enriches and universal- izes Milton's theme, helps to emphasize the virtues of the Christian hero, and reinforces the paradox of the fortunate fall. It also provides an element without which the poem as an epic would be in a sense incomplete. The journey of the epic hero, though not perhaps one of the constitutive elements of the epic genre, was nevertheless an important one which MSilton would surely wish to incorporate if he could. That he did include this motif in subordination by attaching it to Satan is the opinion of several critics,28 and Isabel MacCaffrey has developed this view, suggesting that the archetypal quest theme, part of the cycle of loss, search, and re- 21 The Bible in Milton's Epics, pp. 202-204.

She sees Adam as the true wayfaring hero, with the quests of the Old Testament related by Michael as a telescoping of the theme of the life journey, but believes that the scope and structure of the poem prevented AMilton from working out its details.29 With this position I am in substantial agreement, but I believe that the parallel estab- lished between Adam and Abraham gives a strong emphasis to the journey motif and thus makes it striking enough to balance the exploits of the anti-hero. Moreover, the reiterated refer- ences to Abraham throughout Michael's proph- ecy function as a device to show the symbolic unity of the wanderings of the Chosen People and of the human race. The Exodus from Egypt itself, the greatest of all these journeys, is associated with both the past and the future: first with Abraham: "and at length they come, / Conducted by his Angel to the Land / Promis'd to Abraham and his Seed" (xii.258-260) and then with the Savior who is to bring back "through the world's wilderness long wander'd man / Safe to eternal Paradise of rest" (xii.313- 314). Milton could have found a precedent for this unifying device in Psalm cv, which, re- counting the magnalia Dei, begins with Abraham and concludes with him: "For he remembered his holy promise; and Abraham his servant. And he brought forth his people with joy, and his chosen with gladness" (vv.42-43)A30 Seen from this aspect, Adam's exile-journey, long, arduous, and magnanimous, is "not less but more Heroic" than the exploits of Achilles or Aeneas. The details cannot be incorporated di- rectly into the action of the poem, which must end as that journey begins; but they are incor- porated through the figure of Abraham, and by extension through the figures of all the heroes of faith, who, wandering through the wilderness of the world, show forth the features of the Chris- tian hero. Both Adam and Abraham are types of the Christian wayfarer, moving slowly but al- ways with confidence towards the heavenly Jerusalem which awaits him in the dim future. The concluding lines of Paradise Lost brilliantly unite all these facets of the theme: The World was all before them, where to choose Thir place of rest, and Providence thir guide: They hand in hand with wand'ring steps and slow Through Eden took thir solitary way. (xii.646-649) As Adam and Eve move into history, they know that there will be for them and for their de- scendants provisional and temporary resting places, but that their lasting city lies only at the end of the circling road which will bring them finally home. Though they are leaving behind them the earthly Paradise, they are not leaving God, whose presence is with them. They have learned by sad experience in the hours after the Fall what it means to wander without a guide; now, though there will not always be visible divine interventions and they must use their human judgment to steady their sometimes hesitant steps, they know they can never lose their way in the wilderness, for they will always be led in the path that God has chosen. They are solitary, as every man must always be, an alien in a foreign land, but together in the fellowship of faith and love they await together the final consummation; their citizenship is in heaven, from whence they look for a Savior, the author and finisher of their faith (Phil. iii.20; Heb. xii. 2). They have seen, afar off, that day when Not only to the Sons of Abraham's Loins Salvation shall be Preacht, but to the Sons Of Abraham's Faith wherever through the world; So in his seed all Nations shall be blest. (xii.447-450) Ancestors of Abraham and of the King MIessiah, custodians of the faith which unites the elect, they can turn away from the past to look towards the future, when the Earth Shall all be Paradise, far happier. place Than this of Eden, and far happier days. (xii.463-465) The mingling of sorrow and joy in the last four lines, as in the whole of the last two books, is no mere mechanical paradox but a triumphant rec- onciliation of opposites.

This study is so rich in implications that it is difficult to assess an exact debt; the whole chapter on "Satan's Voyage" (pp. 179-206) has relevance. 30 Similarly, Abraham and a restored Eden are linked in Isaiah li.1-3: "Hearken to me, ye that follow after righteous- ness, ye that seek the Lord: . . . Looke unto Abraham your father, and unto Sarah that bare you: for I called him alone, and blessed him, and increased him. For the Lord shall com- fort Zion: he wil comfort all her waste places, and he wil make her wildernes like Eden, and her desert like the garden of the Lord."</page></plain_text>
