<plain_text><page sequence="1">Elizabeth Grubgeld Castleleslie.com: Autobiography, Heritage Tourism, and Digital Design In 1995, Samantha Leslie opened her family home in Glaslough, County Mon aghan, as a luxury hotel. Situated directly on the border dividing Northern Ire land from the Republic, Castle Leslie was purchased by the "fighting Bishop" John Leslie with funds awarded to him at the Restoration for his part in the overthrow of Cromwell. Unlike many such establishments, the estate has been continually occupied by the family and remains under their direct management. Castle Leslie also flourishes as a web presence centered around fifteen exuber ant essays in family history authored by Samantha Leslies father, the late Desmond Leslie. In these sketches, designed as much for self-expression and lit erary performance as for hotel advertisement, the distinct features of the Anglo Irish comic autobiography merge with the protocols of digital design to pro mote a commercial enterprise dependent on the appeal of heritage tourism. This unusual and elaborate web site provides an opportunity to query the inter relationship of historical representation, literary tradition, web design, and marketing. As it constructs the interpretive frame for a private business that is nevertheless dependent on governmental and European Union restoration funding, it also raises fundamental questions about the ownership of memory in contemporary Ireland. For many historical and cultural reasons, the life writing of those who have identified themselves as Anglo-Irish abounds with comic self-representations. Most Anglo-Irish autobiography is organized around the twin motifs of fami ly history and property, offering genealogical narratives and emotional evoca tions of family property as authentication of the claim to belonging in Ireland. With frequently outlandish tales of disorderly descent, domestic discord, and fiscal irresponsibility, the comic autobiography satirizes the very values on which it is structured. A colonial class propped up by its assertions of rational superiority over a majority population characterized as sentimental and super stitious nonetheless divulges its fantastic excesses and affectations in manner and speech.

As W. B. Yeats observes, recalling the stories told by servants of local fam ilies humble and powerful, "All the well-known families had their grotesque or romantic legends, and I often said to myself how terrible it would be to go away and die where nobody would know my story."1 In many of these "grotesque or romantic legends" that are passed down orally and eventually appear in auto biography and family history, action and speech are so eccentric as to suggest insanity, and satirically reductive accounts of sex, physical functions, and death Speak pointedly of the indignity of the body and the fragility of the self.2 The Leslies have long been prolific autobiographers in the comic mode. As Jonathan Swift inscribed in the guestbook of their home, Here I Am In Castle Leslie With Rows And Rows Of Books Upon The Shelves Written By The Leslies All About Themselves3 In addition to the mass of essays, letters, pamphlets, diaries, and personal sketch es produced through the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, during the twen tieth century the Leslie family published a great deal of life writing that is deeply serious and at the same time mordantly hilarious. These highly literate, witty, and occasionally sobering autobiographies chronicle their authors' lives within the context of family history and the broader historical framework of their time. Desmond Leslie's father, the critic and biographer Shane Leslie, published his first autobiography in 1918 as well as two more full-length autobiographies and many personal essays before his death in 1971. His uncle Seymour produced two family histories, and his sister, Anita, published two memoirs in addition to numerous biographies of the more famous members of the family.4 1. W. . Yeats, The Autobiography of William Butler Yeats (New York: Macmillan, 1965), p. 10. 2. With recognition of its imprecision and ambiguity, I use the term "Anglo-Irish" to describe those persons who saw themselves as distinct from the majority population for reasons of class, reli gion, culture, and ethnic origin. For an extended examination of the origins and characteristics of the comic autobiography as practiced in Anglo-Ireland, see "The Comic Autobiography and the Satiric Tradition" in my Anglo-Irish Autobiography: Class, Gender, and the Forms of Narrative (Syra cuse: Syracuse University Press, 2004), pp. 126-59.

The general navigation bar guides one not only toward such predictable components of a hotel web site as rates and reservations information but also to a narrative of the family and estate that in even its first sentence?"The Leslies can trace their ancestry back to Attila The Hun"?burlesques generic expectations of family history. The top item on the navigation bar seems innocuous?"Bedrooms and Bathrooms"? until the oddity of the latter being listed as a target destination sinks in and the pages open to descriptions of an "epic loo" of Samantha Leslie's own design and a toilet built within an enormous Victorian-era doll house. In "Bedrooms and Bathrooms" one reads the stories of the family members who once occupied the room named in their memory or, in the case of those rooms named only by color, engaged there in some outrageous escapade. Whereas other country house hotel web sites stress gentility, luxury, and escape from the harried pace of the twenty-first century, Desmond Leslie's sketches play havoc with decorum, satirizing class values, family life, religion, and nationality. There is no other web site like it. A survey of about forty web sites advertis ing similar establishments in Ireland, as well as an examination of the web sites established by plantation house hotels in the American south, suggest that this site is much more than a conventional marketing tool.5 As visitors open the door to a virtual room, they are met by a chapter of family history that in its irreverent tone, deflating double-entendres, and anticlimaxes, and in its focus on extravagant eccentricity, sexuality, and curious manners of death could have been lifted directly from any number of Anglo-Irish comic autobiographers from Sir Jonah Barrington's Personal Sketches of society in the late eighteenth century to George Moore's Hail and Farewell (1911-13) and Anita Leslie's own 1981 Gilt and Gingerbread. As such, the text of Castleleslie.com reflects traditions leading back to seventeenth-century satire and forward into a digital age of international tourism. Those traditions, of which the tourist probably knows Oriel and of the Noted Men Who have Dwelt There (privately printed: Glaslough, 1913) and The Jerome Connection (London: John Murray, 1964); Anita Leslie, The Gilt and Gingerbread: An Auto biography (London: Hutchinson, 1981); and A Story Half Told: A Wartime Autobiography (London: Hutchinson, 1983). The family's copious literary output through the generations is noted with deri sion and delight by many of its members. 5. To my knowledge, the only country house web sites that even approximate the style of Castle Leslie's are those of Hilton Park, Glenlohane, and Ballaghtobin. The Hilton Park text takes a comic approach to its eight generations of owners but is much less witty and pointed. The histories of Glenlohane and Ballaghtobin, both of which are very short, also adopt a comic tone while acknowl edging the decline of family fortunes, the profligate spending of an ancestor, and macabre manners of death. Both express great pride that the houses have never been sold.

Most prominent among those traditions is satirizing the very traits that are also presented as sources of cultural pride: a genealogy testifying to centuries of residence in a single place, connections to famous literary and historical figures, intellectual and social status, achievements in art and architecture, courage in the face of threats at home and from abroad, and devotion to the family house. This is not to say that the satirist rejects those values. Satire may expose a fissure or anxiety within a culture without repudiating either the source of the anxiety or the culture as a whole. It may simultaneously celebrate and open a moral inquiry into the object of its celebration. Ever since the late seventeenth centu ry, political cartoons that constitute Anglo-Ireland's first attempts at self-rep resentation, ridiculing one's own values and traditions has been itself a valued tradition. As the bearers of that legacy, the Leslies appear to have reckoned everything about their lives as fodder for anecdotes, some of which are serious and poignant, but most of which depict a family who?as Desmond Leslie once protested to the editors of a guidebook that deemed them "mildly eccentric"? has seen themselves as "very eccentric."6 Living within a tradition of factitious behavior that regarded performance as a kind of virtue, even a moral act of defi ance, they were willing to use the private life, as G. B. Shaw said of his own pow ers of "derisive dramatization," as "a mine from which I could dig highly amus ing material without the trouble of inventing a single incident."7 Desmond Leslie gives his highest praise to the one of his great-aunts who, unlike her scolding sister, "approved of almost everything, and had an endless repertoire of scandals and funny stories" (CL). W. B. Yeats once complained of George Moore that he would sacrifice the personal dignity of himself and anyone else for the sake of the story he was telling at the moment, and like Shaw, Moore, and many others, the Leslie fam ily lived a kind of highly pitched drama in which interactions with the world? in person and in text?were characterized by a ironic and often irreverent bravado that belies the earnestness revealed by their more private writings and their often profoundly idealistic actions.8 The Leslies affected a cool, bemused tone and a sophisticated, blas? attitude that are also characteristic of Anglo-Irish life writing more generally, but their lives reveal a surprising seriousness of purpose.

Thus, Desmond Leslie describes himself in the third person as "one of the few surviving wartime Spitfire pilots. . . . During the war he destroyed a number of aircraft, most of which he was piloting at the time" (CL).

Most Anglo-Irish families insist that they acted charitably during the Famine, but historian Anthony Doyle confirms the fair dealing and advanced farming practices that shielded the Leslies' tenants from the level of suffering experienced elsewhere in the region. See Charles Powell Leslie ITs Estates at Glaslough, County Monaghan, 1800-41; Portrait of a Landed Estate Business and its Com munity in Changing Times (Dublin: Irish Academic Press, 2001). Desmond Leslie's letters to his father during the 1960s evince how heavy he found the burden of trying to maintain a place about which he felt both affection and despair. In 1967 he writes, "Had I thought less of the children or of Glaslough I might have emigrated long ago. But because of both of these I have stayed on, trying to put the place in order as well as our lives_I took over Glaslough in 1963 with the determina tion to restore its ruined finances and despite so many setback and difficulties intend to carry on and make it work. With the new age of leisure and tourism, it could become a most valuable and unique asset, giving pleasure to many and supporting itself. It is with that single minded aim in view that I have devoted myself for the last four years. If I can keep the estate together until this plans [sic] succeeds, it will have been well worth the struggle, sleepless nights, and feelings of failure I have had to fight continually.... So pray that all succeeds. (I have in mind the first Charles Powell who also took over a bankrupted estate and made it well)!)"

In The Jerome Connection, Seymour Leslie relates the story of how his own father, Sir John, "had saved Castle Leslie in the Troubled times of 1920" through "deafness and vagueness": Being told there were armed men parading in the village, at a time when our neighbours' houses were going up in flames, he strode down and inspected them, supposing them to be police enforcing order. As the oldest living British Grenadier officer, he warmly complimented them on their fine turnout. They were I.R.A. commandos.11 On the one hand, the elderly, distracted Sir John is the butt of the joke, his courage a mere mockery; on the other, he is judged a successful defender of his property and his manner is echoed by his grandson Desmond some sixty years later when he makes a tragic-comic scene of the threats presented by the war ring factions along the border.12 Even the more personal hazards of family discord are recounted with amusement: Desmond Leslie reveals that as his great-grandfather Sir John "grew older, Lady Constance could bear the sight of him no more and designed an enormous floral table ornament which effectively hid her husband from view at the dinner table.. ..She called it 'un cache marie' (hide husband)" (CL). Seymour Leslie continues in The Jerome Connection, "When the old gentleman's dentures fell into his oxtail soup and there were some ominous bony sounds, Granny Boo threw her large napkin over her head, asking the butler faintly, and perhaps hopefully, 'Is it all over with Sir John?'"13 Despite the seriousness and pain with which Anita Leslie, her father Shane, and her uncle Seymour all wrote about their parents' lack of demonstrable love and warmth, in the web site's family his tories, the neglectful parent becomes a character in a mildly amusing incident. Desmond Leslie writes in "Shane's Room" that "As a father, he seemed rather puzzled at having children and was never quite sure what to do about us. Once, on meeting little Desmond (aged 4) on the stairs, he asked: 'Hello, who are you?"' (CL).

In addition to courage and family life, the Anglo-Irish comic autobiography treats ironically many of the other cultural ideals valorized by more solemn autobiographers. Augusta Gregory, Elizabeth Bowen, Raymond Brook, Joan de Vere, T. R. Henn, and dozens of others celebrate the achievements of their fam ilies in architecture, art, or literature, whereas the comic autobiography address es the same attributes with a battery of satirical techniques. Anita and Sey mour Leslie are divided as to the architectural merit of what Anita calls the "rambling Victorian edifice" that replaced "a rather nice Georgian" during the 1870s,14 but of earlier remodeling plans, the web site reports: Charles Powell Leslie III simply loved big house parties and wanted to entertain on the Grand scale. His taste in architecture ran from "Free Range Gothic," "Early Taj Mahal," "Late Rothschild," "Bahnhof Baroque," and "Jacobean Bloody". Some of his plans included a cut price copy of the French Chateau de Chambord at least six times larger than the present house and a nine storied gothic tower in the middle of the lake reachable only by Venetian gondolas_Sadly for Charles but fortunately for Leslie family finances he choked on a fish bone before he could realise any of his major architectural fantasies. (CL) The famous tree at Coole Park on which August Gregory had distinguished writers etch their names stands as an emblem of how often literary achieve ments become intertwined with evocations of property and family history. The Leslies were addicted to literary namedropping, and every Leslie autobiography and family history, including the hotel web site, cites the remarks Samuel John son made regarding their ancestor Charles Leslie, the "theologian with a fury," and alludes to the verses Jonathan Swift wrote about Charles Leslie's sons Henry and Robert. Yet what dubious celebrity the comments of the famous bestow on their victims! Johnson deemed the Non-Juror, "a reasoner not to be reasoned with," and of Henry and Robin, Swift quips that while reckless Robin may throw his last shilling to a beggar, "his Coachman must wait to be paid" (CL). Another verse, cited in Anita Leslie's Gz7r and Gingerbread, accuses Robin of impotency and hiding his inadequate sexual organs with foppish clothing. Charity shows its Janus head of cheapness, and modishness surfaces as a ruse to hide a sexual disaster. By repeating Johnson's and Swift's droll denunciations, the Leslies evoke the elegance and taste of the contemporary writer who sees through the pretensions of his or her ancestors, while at the same time drawing attention to their distinguished connections. 14- Anita Leslie, Gilt and Gingerbread, pp. 13,14. 52</page><page sequence="8">Autobiography, Heritage Tourism, and Digital Design Anglo-Irish autobiography reserves some of its most memorable satires for the human body as driven by sexual desire, digestion, disease, and death. Although in their autobiographies Shane, Seymour, and Anita Leslie are cir cumspect about the sexual peccadilloes of their parents, Desmond Leslie's web text revels in cheerful sexual innuendo, from the suggestion that Seymour was conceived in an opera box at Covent Garden during the love duet of Tristan and Isolde to his mother's reaction to his having received a summons from the Queen Charlotte Maternity Hospital where, unbeknownst to her, he had applied for the position of secretary general: "'Now Darling, who is the poor, unfortu nate girl'.... [she] seemed disappointed to learn that the great drama merely concerned a job" (CL). A tunnel under the floor of the Chinese Room, we are told, was useful "for visiting unsuspecting girlfriends" staying in adjacent rooms, and the particularly comfortable bed in the Mauve Room is especially recom mended for honeymooners. "Although Charles Powell Leslie II never married," reports the History portion of the web site, "he achieved a number of quite suc cessful erections, among them the Grain Merchant Store in Glaslough Village" (CL). This is odd material for a hotel web site, but entirely compatible with a lit erary tradition of self-representation that recounts comic tales of profligacy that bespeak the anxieties of a culture obsessed with genealogy and the transfer of property through patrilineal lines. Death enters the discourse through the figures of the ghost and corpse. Both are familiar presences from Anglo-Irish fiction as well as from autobiog raphy, embodying a preoccupation with entropy and extinction, the sense that one's way of life is endangered and near its end.15 Several of the web pages devoted to particular rooms relate stories of ghost sightings, often with the lightheartedness that underlies the story of Anita's ghost creating a whirlwind on the lake or, more recently, the use of Castle Leslie as a site for an episode of the film series, "Ghost Hunters" and the British reality show, "Most Haunted." Yet the Leslie family also takes apparitions seriously, as indicated by Shane Leslie's many letters concerning psychic phenomena and the unusual gravity attending the portion of the web site that recounts the ghostly presence of Nor man Leslie, killed as a young man during World War I. Ghosts can be amusing and on occasion mournful, but the macabre corpse appears even more frequently in Anglo-Irish autobiography than does the ghost. Reminding the reader of the materiality of human experience and its 5?

In her autobiography, Green and Gold (1948), Mary Hamilton describes an ancestor forced by the lack of space in the family vault to "take his eternal rest in a vertical position, with the soles of his feet splayed upwards toward heaven, and the crown of his head bur rowing towards hell," while another relative embalmed his seven children and took them on his travels to America in glass-topped coffins. On the web site of the Ballaghtobin Country House Hotel, young Sophie Gabbet recounts the death of an ancestor as a similarly absurd comedy: Capt. Baker's great, great, great grandson Abraham Whyte Baker whilst touring Europe with his wife Charity was involved in a horse carriage accident in which she was thrown against a wall and crushed; her tortoiseshell hair comb was dri ven into her head. Her body was embalmed so it could be brought to Ballaghto bin and it was put in a glass coffin_Whilst putting her into the vault a bit of the coffin was chipped off and there was her foot perfectly preserved. Shane Leslie wryly recalls in The Film of Memory how the corpses of grand parents in a nearby cemetery were sometimes cut in half to clear space for their grandchildren and explains his difficulty finding the remains of an ancient ancestor: "I could not find the Non-Juror, but at the time I happened to be seen carrying the bones of an extinct Irish elk which had been found in the Donagh Bog. It was immediately remarked that I had been successful in finding the remains of my ancestor: 'but weren't them auld Leslies thick in the hip?'" "The grave-digging scene in Hamlet" he writes, "could be often matched in Ire land."16 Accordingly, Castleleslie.com also subjects mortality?with the excep tion of Norman Leslie's premature death?to the materialist reductionism of satire. In the text of "Lionel's Room," Desmond Leslie blithely recounts that * Uncle Lionel' was always a cheerful character, a great individualist and a notable sculptor. But his mere presence was fatal to any form of machinery. During his recent funeral all the machinery of the West London Crematorium broke down, to the delight of his family and many friends?'There goes Lionel!' they said. (CL) In a similar tone, he gleefully explains the efforts made by a distant relative to remove her son's corpse from its proximity to the grave of Oscar Wilde: "His mother was so horrified that she had him reinterred at a respectable distance.

The conventional rhetoric of a tourist web site is again subsumed by a more powerful impulse to tell the family history in accordance with certain cultural patterns: in the case of the comedie corpse, the reflection of an ethic of sang froid in the face of mortality.17 Finally, the long decline of Anglo-Irish fortunes, so soberly rendered in the autobiographies of W. B. Yeats, Elizabeth Bowen, T. R. Henn, and many others, reduces at Castleleslie.com to a single event: "Finances took a dive when on the advice of the Queen's financial advisor Sir Ernest Cassel the Leslies invested their compensation money from the Wyndham Land Acts in Russian Railway Bonds. That was in 1917. The rest is history" (CL). That history encompasses about eighty lean years when the house could barely be maintained and increasing numbers of its prized art works, books, and memorabilia had to be sold at auc tion simply to keep the house inhabitable. Today, Castle Leslie exists as a thriv ing business employing nearly one hundred persons and the recipient of restoration grants in millions of euros, as well as occupying a space on the global medium of the web. The family histories of Castleleslie.com display a contemporary adaptation of an established tradition of life writing, but it is equally important to look at the relationship between this new form of autobi ography and the dynamics particular to web texts, as well as to consider how it functions within the world of Irish heritage tourism as it has changed in recent decades. Although a web text and one appearing between the two covers of a book necessarily utilize different methods of organization, the comparatively new medium of the commercial hotel web site underscores in its very structure two of the primary motifs of the Anglo-Irish autobiography: the interdependence of personal identity and family property and the effort to defeat a cultural narra tive of extinction by subordinating linear histories to the evocation of particu lar spaces. In Anglo-Irish life writing more generally, property is everywhere subject to anthropomorphism: in her memoir of her father, Lord Morris of Kil lanin, for example, Maude Wynne imagines that the ocean rocks along her father's house in the West of Ireland "played with us and... loved us to sit and idle with their golden heads of lichen"; Lady Gregory calls the trees around 17? As he approached seventy years of age, Desmond Leslie spoke to an interviewer about death with the attitude I have been identifying as distinctive of Anglo-Irish life writing: "I wish we could be more like the Romans. If life became intolerable, and you were fed up, you would invite all your ^friends to a very good dinner, get into a warm scented bath, have champagne cocktails or bloody Marys and then a surgeon would come and cut your wrists; as the water became tinted you just floated away It was all perfectly proper as you came back with a new body, so why wait and hang On to this one, my pet?"

The books in her husband's library "have felt the pressure of my fingers_They have been my friends." T. R. Henn laments in Five Arches the loss of landscape inseparable from the human experience within it: "woods named for men or women ... a springing well, where a girl had meditated; even a rustic bridge, named for a for gotten guest who, at the last drive on a winter's evening, had fallen though the handrail into the little stream below."18 Correspondingly, the Casde Leslie web site describes twice, in detail, the pink stone arch of the entrance porch on which the heads of his grandfather and four grand-aunts are carved. Even more than the many family portraits that line the walls, these carvings fuse the house with its inhabitants: the forms of the Leslie children are one with the archway through which we enter the building that contained their lives. However, the conjunction of person and place is nowhere more evident than in the association of rooms with those who lived in them. The stories of individual Leslie family members all appear within pages devoted to individual bedrooms, two-thirds of which are named by their association with the three generations who lived there in the early part of the twentieth century. Each story follows an organization that is only broadly chronological and primarily asso ciative, often in reference to events that had taken place in the room. As we vir tually enter the room inhabited by "Papa Jack" in his boyhood, for example, Desmond Leslie textually pans around the room, explaining how various items were obtained and allowing his story to segue from these objects to events in the lives of those family members connected to them. Spatial orientation dominates what web designers call the "logic structure" that governs organization and movement around a web site, and web reading practices tend toward lateral movements among portions of text or between texts rather than following the linear sequentiality of reading a print narrative.

I am not implying that the connections between web reading practice and Anglo-Irish ide ology are in any sense intentional in the design of the Castle Leslie web site. 56</page><page sequence="12">Autobiography Heritage Tourism, and Digital Design thus makes use of such protocols of reading to underscore ideological associa tions of identity and place.19 The design forcefully interconnects people with places, and subordinates chronology to a spatial organization in which life takes place in rooms rather than in time. As a virtual edifice, Castle Leslie itself remains the dominant figure and organizing principle of the family history. Lin earity is subservient to a narrative architecture that privileges the house as the center of meaningful experience. Linear time serves most frequently in twentieth-century Anglo-Irish life writing as an antagonist, the vehicle by which the familiar world hastened toward its extinction. As Robert Tobin has argued in his study of southern Protestant autobiography, "many Protestant writers themselves have embraced, or at least acquiesced in, the imagery and language of extinction," despite its inadequacy to mirror the diversity of Irish Anglican experience. He continues, "This form Ian d'Alton has broadly defined as the 'grand tragedy' model of his torical interpretation, one whose dramatic proportions and foregone conclu sions have made it perennially appealing to the Irish literary imagination."20 Given such wide acquiescence to a rhetoric of extinction, the obsessive evoca tion of place as that which endures beyond time emerges as a defensive gesture. How else can one explain, for example, Elizabeth Bowen's insistence on retain ing present-tense verbs in her 1964 revision of Bowen's Court when the house had been demolished several years before? In a sense, Castle Leslie has also gone extinct, having been replaced by the Castle Leslie Hotel. Yet, blessed by EU and government grants, favorable publicity associated with Paul McCartney's wedding there in 2002, and shrewd and energetic management, the actual build ing is in better shape than it has been in many decades, and each year brings more portions of the vast structure closer to their original splendor. The text of Castleleslie.com circumvents the narrative of extinction by draw ing on the very interconnectedness of place and persona] identity that stands as a preeminent feature of the Anglo-Irish autobiography. The web text, and the means by which it is navigated, offer the illusion of intimacy with family mem bers who are inextricably identified with particular rooms within a specific house and whom the visitor accesses by moving at will through various rooms. The well-known stories of the peculiarities of the Leslies who live there now and the equally intriguing histories of those who lived there in the past doubtless contribute to the hotel's success.21 The numerous single-evening events at Cas ao.

Through the web site, visitors are already afforded a degree of interaction, carrying with it again the sensation of intimacy with a glamorous past and the world of the present inheritors. A visitor to the home page is invited to use the virtual doorknocker that opens to what looks like a live feed from a web cam but is actually a video shot of the main room, giving the illusion of contemporane ity?although, as a prerecorded image, it is static in time. One crosses into the private lives of more than three centuries of Leslies and into the narratorial con sciousness of one of the last members of the older generation. By signing up for an e-mail newsletter (at one point authored by the family dogs), sending e-mail queries, or following links, one engages virtually with what appears to be a liv ing family community. A significant element of interactivity involves the use of hyperlinks between a web site and other web spaces outsides its domain; here again, although these links are somewhat limited, they do provide a sense of Cast?e Leslie as a living entity among other contemporary places. At the same time, hyperlinks can attempt to monitor context, however imperfectly. Absent, for example, are any allusions by means of hyperlinks to the hard decades of border violence among paramilitary groups and the British army.23 Unlike autobiography, web text is rarely read linearly, as a whole, or in isolation from other texts; therefore, efforts to manage context through limiting references or links to disturbing informa tion are often undercut by web reading practices. Most readers follow a strate gy known as "patching" in which a web page is read in juxtaposition with unpredictable combinations of other sites. Although links can suggest a context for reading, they cannot control it, and a potential visitor may perform a search 22. Samantha Leslie identifies her visitors in this way during a 2005 interview with RTE news. Rowan Hand, "Castle Leslie and Calladon Receive New Lease on Life," RT?

In 1974, seven people were killed by a car bomb in Monaghan that exploded shortly after three bombings in Dublin; loyalist paramilitaries are thought to have been behind the attacks. Five years later, loyalist politician Sir Norman Stronge and his son were assassinated and their home on an estate adjoining Castle Leslie was burned to the ground. Until the early 1990s, many of the roads around Castle Leslie were inaccessible or too dangerous for travel. 58</page><page sequence="14">Autobiography, Heritage Tourism, and Digital Design for information about Monaghan and inadvertently arrive at the Independent Commission of Inquiry into the Dublin and Monaghan bombings. The full context of any web site is inherently uncontrollable. In Ireland, as in many other nations, there is no clear consensus as to how places embedded with a complicated and controversial history should be con textualized. What a nation is prepared to say about its past must invariably reveal how it perceives its present. As Dean McCannell observes in his study of postmodern global tourism, Empty Meeting Grounds, "Tourism is not just an aggregate of merely commercial activities; it is also an ideological framing of history, nature and tradition: a framing that has the power to reshape culture and nature to its own needs."24 Those involved in the preservation and mar keting of Irish heritage must determine what kind of context is needed when displaying the houses of those who once controlled Ireland at the expense of the majority population. Until recently, few believed that such houses were even worth saving, and the government made little effort to preserve structures that for many Irish people expressed in their very size and design a way of life that spoke of class, ethnic, and religious oppression. Nuala Anderson has suggested that the role of the estate house in famine memory accounted in part for the lack of interest in its historic preservation, and as Luke Dodd has pointed out, "The destruction of the 'Big House' was an ideal means through which the Free State could symbolically be seen to break with the past. Equally, the pow erful symbol of Big House as burnt-out shell legitimated the retrogressive ide ology of the new state."25 Over the last two decades, new legislation and funding initiatives have sig naled a resolve to preserve at least some of the remaining country houses. In his study of this shift in attitude, Michael Cronin suggests four causal factors for the change: a decline in an exclusively nationalist vision of history and a consequent embrace of a more pluralistic vision of Ireland; a desire to attract tourists with more disposable income; a developing interest in the social context of "Big House" literature; and the environmental desirability of dispersing tourists away from a few concentrated areas.26 Samantha Leslie confesses her astonish ment at this transformation in attitude in a 2004 interview with the Belfast Tele graph following the announcement that Castle Leslie would receive a massive restoration grant for border area development: "If ten years ago I had been told 24.

Much has changed since her father attempted during the 1960s to open a nightclub and an equestrian center on the estate and finally had to give up his efforts at keeping the place going on his own.28 And much has changed since the 1970s and 1980s when the surrounding roads?if accessible at all?were dangerous places to be. Castle Leslie has realized the happy ending of a Cinderella story and the Irish government seems now determined to find ways of preserving historic Anglo Irish houses?but we are left with the problem of how such houses should be presented. In a 1970 article in Ireland of the Welcomes, Seymour Leslie suggests that if seen as repositories of art and architecture that can now be enjoyed by all, historic houses will atone for their pasts: "Time is effacing their older image of cruelty and stupidity and we are left with the more precious aspects of the ancient regimes." These "centers of autocratic power," he writes, "oppressive in their time and always exclusive," could now belong to the whole people of the nation both as museums and as residences of architectural and historical sig nificance,29 Seymour Leslie's approach is reminiscent of the British National Trust, which has come under strong criticism for its failure to adequately rep resent the social, political, and economic worlds in which grand houses func tioned and which has thus, however deliberately or inadvertently, reinforced the 27.

In a letter written in July, 1969, Desmond Leslie appears to be arranging a transfer of property to his cousin with plans to develop it for tourism. His tone is at turns apologetic, self-justifying, hopeful, and despairing. He writes, "It is not a question of'brutal Desmond turning out his wife and family'. It is no longer even a question of WHO is live [sic] there? The question is?Can anyone live there atall? The answer to this is 'yes', providing there is some goodwill and horse sense." The fam ily, he reminds his father, will "henceforth be guests of Larry and his corporation_I'm sure you will continue to be very welcome when it is convenient for him to have you. We all hope and pray that the heavy clouds that have for so long hung over the place and on me particularly may soon dis perse." I have been unable to ascertain whether this arrangement went into effect or in what ways it is related to the trust in which Castle Leslie is currently held.

Acts of preservation necessarily place that which they preserve into a narrative context. One context derives all too easily from certain motifs of the Anglo-Irish novel. Noting the close connection between literature and tourism in Ireland, Michael Cronin observes, "A revival of interest in the literature of the Big House ... led to a recomposition of the literary landscape. The whitewashed cottages of Rosmuc give way to the castles and demesnes. The dogged literalism of tourism means that readers mutate into visitors."30 John Colclough s essays on the country house, which appear as part of the Adams and Butler travel agency web site, confirm Cronins observation in suggesting that "the country is still peopled with characters out of the novels of Maria Edgeworth, Somerville and Ross and Molly Keane" and there one will find versions of the "tweedy major" and his fantastic eighteenth-century ancestors. Clearly aware of certain tourist expectations, the Adams and Butler web site also lists "eccentric" as a category of hotels and rentals, along with "pet friendly" or "seaside."31 In a 1975 issue of Ireland of the Welcomes, an article on country house hotels suggests that if one chooses to visit the "rather fey lady with an interest in astrology" whose house is designed with "rakish abandon," one will encounter "affable hounds" while the hostess "materializes to rummage among the pile of books and magazines on the hall table before triumphantly extracting the Visitor's Book from under a stuffed pheasant."32 Although an accent on eccentricity has been part of Anglo-Irish self-representation from the late 1600s, it can quickly become a pre fabricated product, as authentic as the snugs reproduced in the "Irish pubs" found in shopping malls and airports from Cincinnati to Abu Dhabi. At worst, the eccentric uncle and the cracked family portrait join the leprechaun and shil lelagh as caricatures of Irish life. Authentic or not, mere eccentricity is an insufficient frame of reference in which to place sites that in most cases continue to depend on the taxation of their surrounding communities. Luke Dodd has argued for a full contextual ization of such houses, incorporating, as in Strokestown Park, recognition of the role of the estate house in political and social history as well as the lives of the laboring community that supported it. To convert country houses to luxury hotels or homes for millionaires, according to Dodd, is to render them "a mod ern-day equivalent of what they once were?the preserve of the elite."33 In what 30.

This tendency is in keeping with reactions everywhere to the phenomenon of globalisation but in the Irish instance by concentrating on the local, on the parish, historical events are often simply juxtaposed, with no larger narrative communicating interpretations that are seen to be hopelessly contaminated by the political tensions of the present. The spatialisation of history leads to the relentless dehistoricisation of the there and now, thereby sustaining an illusion of an Ireland which 'has in essence, remained the same.*34 As do many of the plantation houses visited by tourists to the American South, Castleleslie.com creates a virtual space without a recent past or signs of the laborers who supported what was once a massive estate. Like the web text and promotional materials that create a family narrative for the Laura Planta tion in Vacherie, Louisiana, Castleleslie.com depends upon a strong genealogi cal plot, an emphasis on exoticism and aesthetic beauty, and a breezy relegation of political conflict to comic anecdote.35 Although in keeping with heritage tourism practices that most commonly idealize environments, the absence of a fuller social, political, and economic context holds the danger of diminishing this historically rich place into Edwardian gingerbread.36 The web text, like the hotel itself, presents the past through the glass of the happy ending. As to the role of the Leslie estate in the larger narrative of history, Desmond Leslie employs characteristic comic reductionism: They say the Battle of Waterloo was won on the playing fields of Eton. More like ly it was won at Castle Leslie, when Charles Powell Leslie decided to educate his son Arthur. Had he not done so Arthur would never have grown up to become the famous Duke of Wellington and defeat Napoleon at Waterloo. We would have passed the years since 1814 coping with EEC bureaucracy, speaking compulsory French and enduring good cooking. (CL) What can be said in defense of what Castle Leslie has become?

Unquestionably, the narrative presented by the web text is incomplete, much more so than many Anglo-Irish autobiographies, including Shane Leslie's, that acknowledge not only the contribution of the working class to the family estate but also the problematic hegemony of the class to which their authors belonged.37 Although in practical terms, the kind of museum that has been so admirably created at Strokestown Park cannot be developed for every remaining country house, some greater historical contextualization of Castle Leslie is arguably due the people whose taxes have helped it sustain itself in a new century. That said, it is also true that although Castle Leslie is filled with art treasures collected during the late nineteenth century and is of some significance as the home of famous and influential persons, it would not be first on a list of places to be restored for purely historical or architectural importance. There are many such places, all in desperate need of attention and restoration efforts.38 Instead, Casde Leslie is remarkable because it was, and is, a place where people lived with extraordinary vitality: where an aged ancestor rode one hundred-and-eighty miles in less than a day to congratulate Charles II on his restoration to the kingship, where for generations the family passionately scribbled sermons, essays, and poems, and where Desmond Leslie composed strange yet prescient electronic music and communed with visitors from other planets. The idiosyncratic and often playful decoration of the rooms, the insistence on retaining and even highlighting family memorabilia, and a zest for the unusual reflect an enterprise that, if in truth a simulacrum of the life that once existed there, is yet faithful to the spirit of a family that has long practiced fan tasy as a way of life. We hear of Desmond Leslie's notoriety on the UFO circuit 37? Among those autobiographies that most directly address these issues, see: Lionel Fleming, Head or Harp (London: Barrier and Rockliff, 1965); Joan De Vere, In Ruin Reconciled: A Memoir of Angfo-Ireland 1913-1959 (Dublin: Lilliput, 1990); and Alannah Heather, Errislannan: Scenes from a Painter's Life (Dublin: Lilliput, 1993). Shane Leslie's most forcefully worded statement on land reform appears in his pamphlet The Landlords of Ireland at the Cross-Roads: A Letter Written by Shane Leslie of Castle Leslie, Monaghan (Dublin: James Duffy 1906). 38. A 2004 article in the Irish Independent interviews eight owners of historic homes, all of whom speak of the enormous and often daunting expense and labor required to restore and maintain such houses. Although Samantha Leslie cheerfully reports the success of her venture and her plans for more extensive restorations, Desmond Fitzgerald speaks for the rest in calling such efforts "quite hair-raising."

In A Story Half Told, Anita Leslie recollects the bare satin dinner gowns that at her father's directive remained requisite attire during the dark, freezing winter evenings of the Second World War. In the tradition of the Anglo-Irish comic autobiography, such stories acknowledge the gravity of a situation by insisting on a self-consciously fantas tic way of responding to it. The public importance of Castle Leslie lies perhaps less in its architecture or its art collections than its preservation as a site of famil ial and cultural memory, and as the text of Castleleslie.com is understood to reflect the cultural and narrative practices of Anglo-Irish autobiography over several centuries, the hotel emerges as a curiously accurate representation of a significant aspect of Anglo-Irish experience, particularly as that narrative engages in the self-conscious fantasy and premeditated irony that characterizes its tradition. When, in Hail and Farewell, George Moore insists to his brother that there is little point in attempting to modernize Moore Hall, he argues, "Nobody wants a real house unless an American millionaire, and it is not because of its reality that he wants it but for its unreality. It is unreal to him, and having a great deal of money, he indulges in eccentricity. In this way the old world is carried on by Americans."38 Castle Leslie is both strangely real and unreal. If it is a fan tasy, it is one promulgated by a family who has lived on performative notions of language and selfhood for generations. Samantha Leslie has maintained its real ity precisely by maintaining its unreality, just as her father's life writings bring to Castleleslie.com the satiric outlook, that for the Anglo-Irish, served to nego tiate the precarious and often contradictory experience of their position in Ireland.
