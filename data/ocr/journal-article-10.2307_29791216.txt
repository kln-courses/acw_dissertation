While working on it the writer realized anew that this subject is not only a vast field of investigation but also a most rewarding one. This paper, though rather long, is limited to the Negritos and certainly does not exhaust the subject matter. But it will, so the writer hopes, provide a somewhat fuller and also more clarifying description and make a wider circle of anthropologists and students of anthropology aware of the various aspects of the field research and theoretical studies on the Philippine Negritos accomplished during this century. It may also help us to see what future research about them still needs to be done. As stated in the Dedication, this issue of the Quarterly is in honor of a great missionary anthropologist, Father Morice Vanoverbergh of the Scheut Missionary Society. At the same time, however, I would like to dedicate it to the Society of the Divine Word which cele? brated its first centenary on September 8, 1975. I am sure that Fr. Vanoverbergh will not mind sharing the honor with the Society, especially since his work as an anthropologist has from the very outset linked him closely with it. As will be detailed in the pages of this article, several members of the S.V.D. (Societas Verbi Divini, which is the Latin name of the Society) have participated, like our honoree, in the work of studying the Philippine Negritos, and it is for that reason that the writer wishes to dedicate this paper also to the S.V.D. on the occasion of the first centenary of its existence. In his work, the late Father Wilhelm Schmidt, the founder of Anthropos, was generously encouraged and prudently guided by Father</page><page sequence="2">Rahmann / THE PHILIPPINE NEGRITOS 205 Arnold Janssen, the Founder of the S.V.D. There can be no doubt that the strong and general interest given to the short-statured peoples of the world in this century's anthro? pological field research and systematic studies goes largely back to the initiative of Father Schmidt. Father Paul Schebesta, belonging to the first post-Schmidt generation in the Anthro? pos Institute, called Schmidt the Rufer zur Pygm?enforschung (Herald of Pygmy Research), a title which delighted Schmidt (cf. Schebesta 1938:v). Father Peter Schumacher of the White Fathers, a Pygmy explorer like Schebesta dedicates his work on the Kivu-Pygmies in East Africa to Father Schmidt, the "Standard Bearer" (Bannertraeger) of Pygmy research (Schumacher 1950:iii). This paper will also try to demonstrate how strongly Schmidt in? fluenced the studies on the Philippine Negritos. It was he who attracted Father Vanoverbergh to his field work and obtained from Pope Pius XI the financial means for an expedition to the Negritos of northern Luzon in 1925. Vanoverbergh's expedition to the Negritos of eastern Luzon was discussed by him and Schmidt when the two met, on the occasion of Schmidt's world tour, in Manila in the year 1935. The funds for this expedition were in equal amounts provided by the Provincial of the Society of the Divine Word in the Philip? pines and by Professor Joseph Schrijnen (Holland), General Secretary of the (inter? national) Commission d' Enquete Linguistique. Vanoverbergh writes that: "These grants, together with the unanimous support of the officials of the Philippine Com? monwealth, have allowed me to make a fairly intensive study of several of the Negrito groups who inhabit eastern Luzon." (See Vanoverbergh 1937:9 - Vanoverbergh writes that he met Schmidt in Manila in November 1936. However, the year was certainly 1935; see Henninger 1956:31. - I, more? over, remember that Father Bornemann and myself put, prior to Father Schmidt's return, some order into the considerable amount of mail that was await? ing him on his desk in St. Gabriel's. I left for my assignment at Fu Jen University in Peking in early August 1936). The value of the studies made by the late Father Schebesta to our present knowledge of the Philippine Negritos equal that of W. Schmidt's. Mention should also be made of another S.V.D. anthropologist, likewise of the first post-Schmidt generation, the late Father Martin Gusinde, who had a keen interest in the Philippine Negritos although his merits are of a more peripheral nature. Other outstanding contributions to our pre? sent-day knowledge of the Philippine Negritos have been made by three more S.V.D. members, namely Fritz Bornemann, Hermann Hochegger, and Jesus Azcona. This writer is grateful that, having been a student of Schmidt and Sche? besta, he belongs to this fine group of anthro? pologists. Another personal remark may be allowed. This article was written amidst various other, and partly rather heavy, duties; not infrequently fragments of time had to be used for it. This by necessity entails some shortcomings in the paper. On the other hand, hardly any other anthropologist would, so it seems to me, be in an equally good position to deal in a somewhat comprehensive way with the subject matter as I am; and I felt that it should be dealt with at once. I wish to add that I would almost never have been able to write this paper in a relatively short time without the faithful and constant help of Lydia Colina, Secretary of the Editorial Office of San Carlos Publications. Miss Colina completely spared me the trouble of going to the Library of the University of San Carlos in order to get the literature needed. She patiently typed and retyped my drafts, prepared the Bibliography as well as the Appendices, and did most of the proof reading. So I am deeply, indebted to her. I. W. Schmidt's appeal to study the f oodgather ers and the response of anthropologists. In 1910, Father Wilhelm Schmidt published his rather extensive work on the position of the Pygmy peoples in the history of the development of man (Schmidt 1910). In the animatedly written conclusion of the work (pp. 304-309), he made an appeal to the anthro? pologists and ethnologists as well as the scientific institutes and governments of the countries concerned for the study of these peoples. Moreover, he recommended the</page><page sequence="3">206 PHILIPPINE QUARTERLY OF CULTURE AND SOCIETY creation of an international commission for re? search on the "Pygmies." In Schmidt's opinion, such studies would be a valuable contribution to the elucidation of the earliest history of mankind. But Schmidt's appeal found at that time no echo whatsoever, as he himself ad? mitted fifteen years later (Schmidt 1925). Furthermore, the outbreak of World War I in 1914 made field work of that kind practically impossible. After the war Schmidt took the matter energetically into his own hands. The year 1925 saw the beginning of the field work of Father Mo rice Vanoverbergh, C.I.CM., as already mentioned, among the Negritos of northern Luzon; of Father Peter Schumacher among the Pygmies of Ruanda (supra); and of Father Schebesta among the Semang Negritos of Malaya. During the following years, these three missionaries continued their field work. In particular, Schebesta devoted his whole life to research among the Semang, the Pygmies of central Africa, the Negritos of the Philippines as well as to the subsequent preparation of comprehensive scientific publications on these populations. During the years 1926-28 Viktor Lehzelter did field work among the Bushmen (Kala? hari Desert, south Africa), which was continued during the years 1951 and 1953 by Father Martin Gusinde (Rahmann 1956:7 f.). However, Gusinde's life work concentrated on the vanishing Indian tribes of Tierrade Fuego, called Fuegians, after their habitat, the southernmost part of South America. Even before Vanoverbergh did the field work mentioned above, Gusinde had begun (in 1918) to organize his field work among the Fuegians. He had been in Santiago de Chile since 1912, and among other duties he had at the time he held the position of a Section Chief of the Museo de Etnologia y Antropologia of the Chilean capital. The Chilean Government and the Archbishop of Santiago grant? ed financial support (Gusinde 1931, I:66f.). In the Preface to the first volume of his great work on the Fuegians Gusinde writes (p.viii) that Father Schmidt had included the Fuegians in his far-ranging plan of promoting research among the ethnologically oldest primitive people when he (Gusinde) was still a stu? dent (in St. Gabriel's Mission Seminary, M?dling, near Vienna, where Schmidt was a member of the Faculty and editor of Anthropos). When Gusinde reported to Schmidt at the end of World War I about his field work, the latter encouraged him unreserved? ly and gave support. Gusinde stayed among the Fuegians altogether four times; he concluded his field work in 1924. Father Wilhelm Koppers, S.V.D., joined him during his third visit (1921-1922) to the Fuegians. During the months of July-August 1955, Gusinde spent a few weeks in the Philippines. This gave him a chance to have a look at the Negritos in "central and northern Luzon." He also visited Father Vano? verbergh in the Mountain Province with whom he had long discussions (Gusinde 1962:212). During a short visit to Cebu, he undertook field trips to Panay and Mindanao in the company of Marcelino Maceda. In Panay he met several Negrito groups in the interior of the Province of Iloilo. A second trip took him to the Mamanua in northeastern Mindanao. His plan to do field work among the Philippine Negritos the following year unfortunately did not materialize. It would have been very desirable to have Gusinde's views on the racial problems that the Negritos of the Philippines pose. In this connection reference may be made to Schebesta's opinion that the eye is a more reliable guide (in matters of racial characteristics) than dead measurement-data (Schebesta 1938, I:x). It may be said that both Gusinde and Schebesta did have a keen eye in matters of race (concerning the oft-mentioned Papuan racial element among the Philippine Negritos, see Rahmann and Maceda 1955:820). We may men? tion further that Gusinde briefly gave his views on the "Aeta", views that are largely still valid today, in 1962:239-242. Gusinde did his last field work in the Schr?der Range of eastern central New Guinea during the middle of the year 1956. He felt that he had verified the assumption that the short-statured people living in isolation in those highlands were Pygmies. He called them, after their habitat, Ayom Pygmies (Gusinde 1958; 1962:252). As early as the third decade of this century, the New Guinea missionary Franz Kirschbaum, S.V.D., had dealt with these Pygmies in several brief publications; Lord Moyne also wrote about them (cf. Gusinde 1958:503; regarding Kirschbaum see also Rahmann 1956:9). May I be permitted to mention here that I met Father Gusinde at the Manila International Airport when he arrived in the Philippines in the second half of July 1955. I was then on my way to Switzerland in order to work for some years in the editorial office ofAnthropos. In the second half of September 1956, I had the pleasure of meeting Gusinde, then already a septuagenarian, at the airport of Washing? ton, D.C., upon his return from his just-mentioned field work in New Guinea.</page><page sequence="4">Rahmann / THE PHILIPPINE NEGRITOS 207 II. The re-discovery of the African Pygmies and studies generated thereby. It will be useful to realize that W. Schmidt's personal interest in the "Pygmy peoples" was not simply accidental. The scientific trends that characterized ethnological studies in Europe during the first half of this century were largely part of the keen interest which anthropologists, physical anthropologists first of all, had had for some decades in these short statured peoples, generally considered remnants of early mankind. That interest was aroused in 1870, when the German explorer, Georg Schweinfurth, re-discovered the African Pygmies by meeting some of them in a Negro village of the northern Congo. It is true that ten years earlier the French African explorer, Paul du Chaillu, claimed to have seen Pygmies in West Africa, near the Ogowe river. However, since du Chaillu's report was somewhat roman? tic in tone, European scholars hesitated to be? lieve him; the authority of Schweinfurth dis? pelled all doubts. Since then reports of ex? plorers, whose main interest were, however, geographic, about their meeting with Pygmies became more and more numerous. Finally, in 1929, Schebesta began his systematic field work among the Pygmies of Central Africa (Schebesta 1938,1:30 f; 36f.). Schebesta chose for all African Pygmies the name Bambuti-see Schebesta 1938, 1:24-26. In the Bush? men he sees Bambutoids?ibid. 355f. It is correct to say that Schweinfurth re-dis? covered the African Pygmies. Thousands of years before him, the ancient Egyptian had a fairly good knowledge of the dwarfs in tropical Africa who were highly cherished cultic dancers at the court of the pharaohs. A letter of pharaoh Phiops II of the Sixth Dynasty (2500-2300 B.C.; cf. Sellman 1960:63) is of special im? portance for our knowledge of the African Pygmies. The letter is addressed to the leader of an expedition who was returning from the south and who had, through a special mes? senger, reported to the pharaoh from one of his halting places that he was bringing along from the Tree and Ghost Country (tropical Africa) a dwarf who could dance the dances of God. The pharaoh is enthusiastic. He enjoins the expedition leader to have the dwarf well guarded lest he find his death in the waters of the Nile. He furthermore instructs him to re? port immediately to his court, after his return, together with the dwarf. In his letter, he al? ready welcomes the dwarf with the words: "To the Heavenly Dancer, greetings. Salutations to him who makes the heart glad, to whom the King Neferkara . . . sends homage" (quotation from Ballif 1955:15). Pharaoh Phi ops mentions in his letter that at an earlier time, under King Asosi, a dwarf had come to the court of the pharaoh. This was, according to Gusinde, who had more specific sources at his disposal, about one hundred years earlier, around 2460 B.C. Gusinde comments on the mentioning of Asosi by Phiops that the coming of a dwarf to the court of the pharaoh at Asosi's time must have left a deep imprint in the minds of the Egyptians. The Pygmies' art of dancing is even today astonishing and their joy in dancing so great that Eugen Fischer speaks of a dancing mania. He believes this extraordinary vitality is due to the rich intake of insect food by the Pygmies. This kind of food contains the vitamin complex T which produces such effects (Fischer 1955:35). The role of dancers of the Pygmies at the courts of the pharaohs provided the title of a book by Noel Ballif, leader of a French expedition to the Pygmies: Les danseurs de Dieu, which appeared in 1954. The following year an English as well as a German translation appeared under the respective titles: The Dancers of God (see References), Die Taenzer Gottes. Greek-Roman antiquity had a rather ex? tensive, although vague, knowledge of the African Pygmies. Phoenician merchants traded amulets that represented Pygmies to Mediterra? nean countries, especially to Cyprus. In the literary sources it is shown that the by then largely fabulous Pygmies had come to the attention of the Greeks and Romans. Even at the time of Homer (ca. 800 B.C.), Pygmy tales must have been already widespread in the Greek-speaking world because in the third song of the Iliad (III, 2-7) Homer explains the fight of the Trojans against the Greek by referring to the cranes which, flying from the cold and</page><page sequence="5">208 PHILIPPINE QUARTERLY OF CULTURE AND SOCIETY rain (from the north towards the south?they still fly every autumn from northern Europe to the swamps of the Nile), threaten the small race of Pygmies with death and destruction. There may be a factual element in Homer's tale. The big flocks of this large wading bird, which suddenly appeared every autumn in their habitat, presumably consumed the fruits from which the Pygmies obtained their livelihood, and they, in turn attacked the birds, which must have been for them also a source of meat, with their weapons. Could it furthermore be that the irritated cranes, which probably were much more numerous in the then thinly populated world, attacked on their part the Pygmies in large formations? Whatever may be the truth of the matter, the antique story about the enmity between Pygmies and cranes became a migratory tale that got as far as Japan. Certainly not all such narratives should be considered as belonging to the realm of fairy tales. A report of Herodot (5th century B.C.) speaks of five adventurous young men who crossed the Lybian desert and saw south of it little men who were below medium stature. Of special interest is what Aristotle (+322 B.C.) writes in his Historia Animalium (VII, 12) when he speaks about the migration of birds: In some cases they [the birds] migrate from places near at hand; in others they may be said to come from the ends of the world, as in the case of the crane; for these birds migrate from the steppes of Scy thia to the marshlands south of Egypt where the Nile has its source. And it is here, by the way, that they are said to fight with the Pygmies; and the story is not fabulous, but there is in reality a race of dwarfish men, and the horses are little in proportion, and the men live in caves underground. The horses are most probably an unhistorical part in this report although the Hyksos, a people from Asia Minor, brought the horse to Egypt around 1700 B.C. That those Pygmies were (as a rule) cave dwellers (troglodytes), and even underground ones, can hardly be reconciled with the fact that they lived in a swampy region. Nowadays the typical dwelling of the Pygmies of eastern and central Africa is the beehive hut (see respectively Schumacher 1950:184-186; Schebesta 1941:142-150. How? ever, the hut of the former shows, as Schumacher points out, influences of the farmers and herders in their territories). According to Le Roy (around 1900:242; see also 238 ff.) the Pygmies of western Africa are occasional troglodytes but the caves are formed by over? hanging rocks, and Le Roy found it pleasant (p. 239) to spend a night in them when travelling. It can be deduced from Le Roy (238) that the Pygmies whom the five adven? turous youths in Herodot's report saw (supra), were troglodytes. A further comment would be difficult to make; the matter must be left at that. Only one more question may be asked. Aristotle writes that the cranes flew in autumn from Scythia to the swamps of the Nile. May we conclude from this statement that one part of the birds flew in spring to the Black Sea regions (and not to northern Europe)? The Roman writer, Pliny the Elder (23-79 A.D.), considers in his Naturalis Historia the Upper Nile region the home of the Pygmies. There is also a report in Greek antiquity about the existence of Pygmies in India. It is by Ktesias, physician of the Persian King Artaxerxes II (405-358 B.C.). Perhaps Ktesias was in? fluenced by reports about the African Pygmies (although there must have been Negritos in India in former times; cf. Fuchs 1973:27 f.). In this survey one report should not be over? looked; it is that of Nonnosus, a Byzantine Jew whom Emperor Justinian entrusted around the year 533 A.D. with an ambassadorial mission to the Ethiopians and other nations. Nonnosus reports that along the southern part of the (western) coast of the Red Sea, there existed whole peoples who looked like human beings but were of very short stature. Le Roy, who gives details of Nonnosus' report, remarks (p. 13) that it could, in its entirety,be applied to the Pygmies whom modern travelers redis? covered. Two points are of special interest in Nonnosus' report. The first is that he saw these dwarfs, and many of them, along the southern (western) coast of the Red Sea. This seems to prove that the territory of the Pygmies stretched at that time rather far to the northeast of the</page><page sequence="6">Rahmann/THE PHILIPPINE NEGRITOS 209 African continent, even to the sea. The second point is that these Pygmies lived on sea shells and fish washed ashore. This seems to be a good example of the ability of foodgatherers to adapt themselves in their economic life to the environment. It is of special interest that St. Augustine (+430) and St. Albert the Great (+1280) also had some knowledge of the existence of the Pygmies. Augustine (The City of God, XVI, 8) reckons them among the human monstrosities and asks whether they are descendants of Noah and ultimately of Adam. Albert sees in them, after some hesitation, beings that are to be placed (of course, not in the sense of the modern theory of evolution) between man and the brute animal. Apparently, these two great Christian thinkers faced the theological problem of how the existence of such a race would be compatible with the universality of redemption by Christ, the Second Adam. Le Roy remarks rightly (p. 12) that Augustine looks at the question solely from a dogmatic viewpoint. From the beginning of the seventeenth century until about the middle of the last century, the Pygmies are occasionally men? tioned in travel reports; but this had no effect upon the scientific world. This changes sudden? ly after the re-discovery of the African Pygmies by Schweinfurth. For the preceding section of this article see especially Gusinde 1962:211-224, Le Roy ca. 1900: Part I, and Schebesta 1938:1-14; furthermore Wolf 1938:445-514, Hennig 1944:357-361, Fischer 1955:1-37 and 1958:611-614, and Schebesta 1957: 24-32. John Garvan, with whom a large part of this article will deal, devotes Chapter 32 (see Appendix II, infra) of his manuscript on the Philippine Negritos to the knowledge of the Egyptians and to the knowledge as well as (fabulous) stories of other ancient peoples about Pygmy races, and, further? more, to the existence of real or alleged Pygmies in our time. - In his article of August 1934 (see References) Garvan gives as the date of the above mentioned letter of the pharaoh ca. 4400 B.C.; that it was written "some 6334 years ago." In Chapter 32 of his manuscript (Bornemann's micro? film edition), the date is correct. The last scholarly concern about the Pygmies before modern times, namely that of Augustine and Albert the Great was, in a vague sense, of a racial nature. This was the uppermost concern again, but now on a modern scientific basis, after the rediscovery of the Pygmies by Schweinfurth; and this concern reflected the prevailing scholarly atmosphere of the second half of the last century. It should, however, be noted that in spite of the modern scientific approach, it look some time before the racial peculiarities of the foodgatherers were more clearly seen. A better understanding was gained only after some erroneous views had been ex? pressed; this should be a consolation and at the same time an incentive to humility for scholars of our day. The starting point was the biogenetic law advocated by Ernst Haeckel (then accepted but later rejected), according to which each human individual repeats in the development of his body the development of the human race as such (ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny). Applying this so-called law, the Swiss anatomist, J. Kollmann, advocated a special evolutionary theory. According to him the oldest races of mankind were dwarfish or pygmaean. It was from these short-statured races that the tall races slowly developed, and this in such a way that each present-day tall race was preceded by a correlated pygmy race; and Kollmann con? sidered the pygmies of our time the last rem? nants of the original pygmy races (Schmidt 1910:2). Father Schmidt was also of the opinion that the Pygmy peoples represent an infant stage of the human race. In contrast to Kollmann, however, he assumed that there was originally only one uniform Pygmy race (cf. Schebesta 1938, 1:217. Here as in the para? graphs immediately following, I use some per? sonal notes which I compiled about twenty years ago). It may be added that Father Schmidt's view in this matter was probably (as in the case of Augustine and Albert the Great) influenced by theological considerations. Opposed to Kollmann's (and W. Schmidt's) views were those of anthropologists who saw the Pygmy populations as the outcome of racial degeneration. Among Kollmann's foremost</page><page sequence="7">210 PHILIPPINE QUARTERLY OF CULTURE AND SOCIETY critics are G. Schwalbe and E. Schmidt. The best-known advocate of the degeneration theory is the physical anthropologist and pioneer in studies on human heredity, Eugen Fischer. He is of the opinion that humanization could not have taken place in the virginal forest. According to him, it took place in the steppe, and the first human beings were hunters of big game. Consequently, the life of the African Pygmies in the virginal forest is, in the opinion of Fischer, of a secondary nature, and they developed their present economy, namely, foodgathering, only when they moved from the steppe into the virginal forest (Fischer 1955:1-35). This view is opposed by Schebesta (1957:24-32). He holds that Bambuti culture is of a primary-primitive nature; i.e., it developed within the virginal forest. But he admits that there was a mutation towards a bodily pygmaean growth. Rudolf Martin, who in 1897 did field work among the inland tribes of Malaya (see Schebesta 1952:35), agrees partly with Kollmann's views. He sees in the low stature of the Semang Negritos of Malaya an original element that was preserved by heredity, and consequently not a form of degeneration. Like Kollmann, he also assumes that a high age must be ascribed to the low stature forms of the human race but he rejects the rest of Kollmann's conclusions. Rudolf Poech (Vienna) distinguished from the viewpoint of race five groups of Pygmy peoples: the Southeast Asian Negritos; the central African Pygmies; the Bushmen; the Lapps; the Veddoid. He does not, however, assume their racial unity. Among the Negroid peoples he also numbers the low-stature (moun? tain) people of New Guinea. (This last assump? tion may be said to have been confirmed by Gusinde's field work mentioned above. As to the rest, I refer the reader to the extensive summary about the whole problem in Martin Sailer 1959:790-792). Schebesta made (1952:458-479) a thorough study of the problem of a racial affinity be? tween the Negritos of Southeast Asia and the African Pygmies. The main points of his con? clusions (p. 478f.) are: 1. Only the Andamanese, Semang and the Philippine Negritos (Aeta) belong to the Negritos. 2. The Negritos are a short-statured but by no means dwarfish group of mankind; some characteristics exhibit them as Negroid. 3. Basic to all Negrito groups is a (pygmoid) racial complex (dark skin, curly hair, brachycephalism, short-stature, with some un differentiated characteristics), found among the three groups, although in varying combinations. Thereby the similarity of the racial image is accounted for. The differences result from other racial components through racial mixture. 4. The Negritos are not a homogeneous race. Since prehistoric times, racial elements of melanesoid, Veddoid, premongoloid and australoid origin, together with the negroid base, have entered into the constitution of the Negrito race. 5. The Aeta exhibit more geographically limited groups (local and regional groups), each with its typical pattern whilst among the Semang racial mixture stretches horizontally through their entire habitat in a more uniform way. 6. The Negritos are not Pygmies since they in their present-day appearance differ from the Bambuti in most of the characteristics. Negrito and Bambuti are two short-statured races of the negroid form complex. 7. There is, however a possible genetic con? nection between the dwarfish more light skinned and brachycephalic Negrito element with peppercorn hair and the brachycephalic Bambuti component. Schebesta's more explicit views seem to con? cur with what A.L.Kroeber wrote about ten year earlier (1943:41): It is . . . certain that there is a close similarity between the East Indian [Southeast AsianJNegritos and the Negrillos or pygmy blacks of Central Africa. Most students are inclined to identify these two far flung groups as members of the same race. This of course makes the question of their origin and dis? persion still more mysterious. Kroeber then goes on to say that "several theories have been propounded in explanations" but he did not consider it profitable to discuss them.</page><page sequence="8">Rahmann / THE PHILIPPINE NEGRITOS 211 Regarding the term Negrillos used above by Kroeber, it is, of course, derived from the French negrilles (see the title of Le Roy's work in the References) which has the same meaning as the Spanish negritos. It has in the meantime become rather generally accepted terminology to speak about Southeast Asian Negritos and African Pygmies (or Bambuti). Schebesta (1938:217f.) rejects the term Negrillos. As concerns Wilhelm Schmidt, his main interest in the Pygmies did not involve racial questions?they were for him only the starting point?but the culture of these peoples. In particular, his attention was drawn to their belief in the existence of a high god or Supreme Being. The data, largely the result of the above-mentioned field work, which he amassed on this belief among the "Urvoelker" (primor? dial peoples) of the two Americas, of Asia, Australia and Africa are dealt with in volumes 2-5 of his twelve-volume work Der Ursprung der Gottesidee (Schmidt 1926-1935). Volume 1 (1926) is an historical-critical and positive study of the various theories about the origin of religion. The last chapter of that volume deals with the cultural-historical method in anthropology. Volume 6 contains the final synthesis. The Philippine Negritos are dealt with on pp. 280-317 in Volume 2 (1931). At that time Schmidt had rather scanty material at his disposal, as he admits in his introductory remarks. Volume 5 (1934) has an Appendix of a few pages (800-804) on the Philippine Negritos. There is strong evidence that this specific interest of Schmidt was aroused through stimuli from without. At the beginning of this century the former Mission bishop in West Africa and then Superior General of the Congregation of the Holy Ghost, Alexandre Le Roy, published his Les Pygmees Negrilles d' Afrique et Negritos de V Asie. Schmidt re? viewed this work in the first volume of Anthropos (1906) in the very first book review appearing in the new periodical (pp. 389-392). In this review Schmidt gives special prominence to Le Roy's description of the Pygmies' belief in a high god (un Dieu personel et souverain). In connection with this he refers his readers to Andrew Lang's work, The Making of Religion, which had appeared in 1898. In his work Lang surprised scholars of England and other parts of the world with his assertion that belief in a high god existed among the materially low tribes of Southeast Australia and (besides other peoples) among the Andamanese (cf. Schmidt 1926:134 ff.). Since the publication of Lang's book, the question of the belief in the existence of a high god or (still more sharply formulated) a Supreme Being among the primitive peoples has agitated the minds of anthropologists and scholars specializing in the various fields of studies in religion. Against this background it is understandable that it became Schmidt's resolve to collect all the available data about the high-god belief and the religious cults of those peoples which were thought to be *the representatives of earliest mankind; they are now frequently called food gatherers (or wildbooters; see Kern 1960). Later in his life Schmidt also collected the corres? ponding data about the herdsmen civilizations. These data are contained in volumes 7-11 of his Ursprung der Gottesidee. Volume 12, posthumously published by F. Bornemann, contains the synthesis of Volumes 7-11. Whatever the shortcomings of Schmidt in certain respects may be, it cannot be denied that he has amassed an impressive amount of material about the existence of the belief in a high god or Supreme being among preliterate peoples. It is hard to see how those anthro? pologists who cannot find anything but "super? natural powers" or "supernaturals" among these peoples can do justice to the facts. The acceptance of the frequency of the belief in a personal god (whatever the details about him) does not, of course, mean that it is found among all "Urvoelker" or preliterate ethnic groups in general. If Schmidt erred (and which scholar does not? ), the anthropologists who simply reject or ignore Schmidt (and perhaps never read him) err likewise. It may be appro? priate to quote here Schebesta who, although very close to Schmidt, was certainly always alert to the necessity of being objective and critical. He states that Schmidt, in his attack against mechanical evolutionism, may have</page><page sequence="9">212 PHILIPPINE QUARTERLY OF CULTURE AND SOCIETY pushed the high-god belief too vehemently to the fore but that he (Schmidt) was perfectly right with his thesis of the existence of a high god belief among the oldest peoples (Altvoelker). He adds that Schmidt's Ursprung der Gottesidee is a warm-hearted apology; how? ever not an apology for Christianity, but for primordial man (Urmensch) whom Schmidt did not consider as a mere animal but as fully human (Schebesta 1954:689). What Father Schmidt (and probably most of the European anthropologists) did not know when he made his appeal in 1910 to study the Pygmy peoples of the earth was the fact that rather intensive field work was already being done on the Negritos of the Philippines. Even? tually?presumably after World War I?Schmidt learned that there existed in Manila a bundle (Konvolut) of manuscripts on the Negritos. He wrote several times to the Bureau of Science but his requests were taken care of, as he states ironically in a footnote, by giving him no answer (Schmidt 1931:280). Perhaps Schmidt's letters were passed on to Beyer, who apparent? ly was not very good in correspondence (cf. Rahmann and Ang 1968:3). For the part of this paper that now follows, 1 draw very largely upon two important publications which, because they are written in German, may be less accessible to a larger number of anthropologists. These publications are Bornemann's article (1955) on the Garvan materials together with his microfilm edition thereof, as well as Azcona's critical examination of the more recent Negrito research with special regard to Garvan (Azcona 1975). At this juncture it should be pointed out that Azcona implicitly limits the term Negrito to the dark-skinned short-statured population of the Philip? pines. Only so can the title of the study (the Philippines is not mentioned in the title) be correctly understood. However, such a narrowing down of the term Negrito runs counter to the currently accepted terminology, and an explanation by Azcona would have been desirable. Reference may be made to Kroeber (1943:40 f.) who, however, also includes the short-statured people of New-Guinea (supra) among the Negritos (together with the Aeta, Semang and Andamanese). Recently Geoffrey Benjamin called the Semang "Malayan Negritos" (see Benjamin's Introduction (p. vi) to Schebesta 1973). There is no need of mentioning Schebesta in this respect. It was through Bornemann's efforts that the Garvan manuscript was rescued from the near oblivion into which it had fallen. To him we also owe the first, and truly keen, analysis of Garvan's manuscript as well as most of what we know about Garvan himself. Bomemann collected these data soon after World War II in Washington, D.C., they were mainly obtained from the papers of the former Bureau of Insular Affairs (Bornemann 1955:907, footnote 9). The photographic portrait of Garvan, first published by Bornemann and reproduced in this article, was also found among these papers. Garvan's manuscript is now available in book form, thanks to the efforts of Father Hermann Hochegger, S.V.D., who undertook the task at the suggestion of Schebesta, his professor during his seminary days in St. Gabriel's at Moedling, near Vienna. The critical investigation into the more recent Negrito research by my junior Spanish confrere, Father Azcona, is a highly erudite contribution to the subject matter. This is all the more admirable since the author has never been in the Philippines and has, consequently, had no field experience with the Negritos. For the past two years, in answer to a request made to me, I had been thinking of writing this present article but various other duties made it difficult to carry out that purpose earlier. Azcona's extensive study, actually his doctoral dissertation, has greatly facilitated my task and I am profiting fully from his presentation and insights. In passing, I would like to mention that I have preferred an approach somewhat different from that of Azcona, viz., to "direct attention to the salient contributions to the advance in ideas and know? ledge." This was the approach adopted by Arsenio Manuel on the occasion of the symposium held in honor of H. Otley Beyer on the occasion of his 82nd birthday at the University of the Philippines (Manuel 1967:23). III. Negrito research in the Philippines III. A. 1. The Bureau of Non-Christian Tribes and David P. Barrows In October 1901 the U.S. Philippine Com? mission set up "The Bureau of Non-Christian Tribes for the Philippine Islands." In view of</page><page sequence="10">Rahmann / THE PHILIPPINE NEGRITOS 213 the great progress that the new science of anthropology had made in the United States towards the end of the last century it was, so to speak, but natural that American anthro? pologists wanted to get as complete as possible a picture of the ethnic situation of the Philip? pine archipelago. David P. Barrows, the Chief of the Bureau just mentioned, did not let the grass grow under his feet. In December of the same year, 1901, he published a "Circular of Information" which contained "Instructions for Volunteer Workers" (Barrows 1901). It may be assumed that these volunteers were attached to "The Museum of Ethnology, Natural History and Commerce" (see title page of the Circular and pp. 15-16). It hardly needs saying that these instructions were not con? fined to field work among the Negritos. How? ever, they are the first ethnic groups of which Barrows gives abrief survey and characterization (p. 4 f.; see also p. 10 f.). He is also aware that "The existence of these little people in the Philippines is given an added interest by the presence elsewhere of similar pygmies" (p. 4). He then mentions the Semang of the Malay peninsula, mistakingly calling them Sakai, and the Andamanese for whom he uses the name, now obsolete, "Mincopies." About the Sakai see Schebesta 1952:69-72. This Malay word has the meaning of "follower, retainer, dependent associate" (p. 71). The word is used for inland dwellers of the Malay peninsula (but with the exclusion of the Semang). A Malay would consider it an insult to be called Sakai. In an earlier publication (1928) Schebesta calls the Sakai "a strange, enigmatical, and primitive race" (see Schebesta 1973, 2nd edition: 13). ? The name Mincopies, which came into use towards the end of the last century, seems to stem from a misunder? standing (Schebesta 1952:17). In the second part of his Circular, Barrows gives for investigators "of fewer opportunities" rather inclusive "suggestions for observations". He furthermore announces that for investigators who are able "to make an exhaustive study of any tribe, a detailed syllabus is under pre? paration" and that this "will be sent as soon as printed" (p. 9). This syllabus must be identical with the Questionnaire (marked "Paper Nr. 121") of which I obtained a copy from Professor Beyer a little over twenty years ago and which is entitled "Preguntas para el estudio etnologico de las tribus." It is Publication No. 1 of the Bureau of Non-Christian Tribes, and dated Manila 1901. This date shows that the promised detailed syllabus was not long in coming. There are no less than 390 questions, not num? bered consecutively, but separately for each of the 31 sections in which they are arranged. That the questionnaire was worded in Spanish is easily understandable; it was in the beginning of this century still the better-known language of the prospective recipients. The choice of the language also shows that an all-around par? ticipation of the Filipinos in the large-scale ethnographic endeavor was desired and expect? ed. On August 1, 1912, Beyer wrote a Preface to the Preguntas. He states therein that they were contained in "a mimeographed circular, of which 1000 copies were sent out to all ^residentes of municipalities and other officials throughout the provinces." He further remarks that it was Dean C. Worcester who prepared the original list of questions. Of special im? portance is Beyer's statement that "Over five hundred manuscripts were received in answer to the questions asked" and that "most of these manuscripts are still on file in the Records of the Division of Ethnology." The recipients of the questionnaire were, as stated in Beyer's Preface, besides the ^residentes of the municipalities, other interested persons such as officers of the armed forces, students, teachers, etc. Barrows' "Instructions for Volun? teer Field Workers" in his Circular was meant for an even wider range of persons, including inspectors of the Insular Constabulary, superin? tendents of the Department of Public In? struction, officials of the provincial govern? ments, and other "persons who through residence or investments have become familiar with the conditions there prevailing." I received from Beyer, together with the Preguntas, one of the original answers by Camilo Abrico, dated June 13, 1902. It is a point-to-point answer about the "Mountain People near</page><page sequence="11">214 PHILIPPINE QUARTERLY OF CULTURE AND SOCIETY Valderrama" (Antique, Panay), and the second entry in the Beyer (?Holleman) Collection on the Negritos (see Appendix I of this paper). Here, the question inevitably arises as to what happened to those answers and this leads us to the matter of the Beyer Collection; however, before we deal with it, William Reed must be given due attention. III. A. 2. William A. Reed William Reed was one of the earliest mem? bers of the Bureau of Non-Christian Tribes (cf. Azcona:209). On the strength of the field work he pursued during the months of May and June 1903 (Reed 1905:9), he wrote a monograph on the Negritos of Zambales which was published under the auspices of the Bureau upon the recommendation of Albert Ernst Jenks, Chief of the Ethnological Survey. It appeared in 1905 in Volume II of the Ethnological Survey Publications. If one considers the little time which Reed could spend in gathering his information and the still rather unsatisfactory state of know? ledge about the foodgatherers in general, Reed's work must be rated as a remarkable achieve? ment. As far as the Philippine Negritos are con? cerned, it was the richest coherent outcome of the research work organized and sponsored by the Bureau of Non-Christian Tribes. Azcona (1975:209) has a brief paragraph on Reed. After stating that the results of Reed's field work are mainly descriptions of the material culture, he goes on to say that physical anthropology and language are not covered at all ("ueberhaupt nicht behandelt") and that just as little attention is given to the spiritual culture. Finally, so Azcona remarks, there are no references ("Hinweise") to social life and social structure (political organization, kinship, and legal systems.). About this criticism of Azcona it must be said that it is largely unwarrantable, although it must be admitted that Reed's treatment of the various aspects of the culture of these Negritos is not as thorough as might have been desirable. In the case of the Negritos' spiritual culture, Azcona himself refers to pp. 61-64 in Reed's monograph. As concerns physical anthropology and language, Reed deals with them in Appendix A and Appendix B res? pectively. In Appendix A, Anthropomorphic Measure? ments (pp. 75-77), Reed gives the measure? ments on 77 individuals on standing height, span of arms, length of nose, breadth of nose, nasal index, and length of ear. It is rather obvious that in making these simple measure? ments, Reed followed the instructions of Barrows (cf. Barrows 1901:10). In general, it may be said that Reed was aware of the defects of his study. In his Preface he states (p. 9) that the short time at his disposal for the in? vestigation is his "only excuse for the meager treatment given some lines of study?as, for example, physical anthropology and language." In Appendix B, Vocabularies (pp. 79-83), Reed states in the introductory part (p. 79) that the Negritos of Zambales "seem to have lost entirely their own language and to have adopted that of the Christianized Zambal." Before making this statement, Reed refers to his previous remarks on the language situation in Zambales; these remarks are found on p. 28f. There, Reed expresses his opinion that the Sambal imposed their language on the Negritos, and that they did so "thoroughly". One of the evidences of a former close contact between the Negritos and the Sambal, as Reed sees it, lies "in the fact that the Negritos of southern Zambales who have never personally come in contact with the Zambal but only with the Tagalog also speak Sambal with some slight variations . . ." The (Malay) Sambal are "much the smallest of the recognized Christian nationalities." Their habitat, the Province of Zambales, is "somewhat off the main tracks of communication," and they came under the Spanish rule "considerably later than the other Christian peoples. As might be expected, they therefore lag somewhat behind in their general advancement" (Kroeber 1943:59). Even now, what Reed has to say about the assumed existence of a Negrito language in Zambales and the neighboring areas may be of interest. He himself seems rather inclined to assume that research into an eventual original language of these Negritos would not lead very</page><page sequence="12">Rahmann/THE PHILIPPINE NEGRITOS 215 far. Reed writes (p. 29): Close study and special investigation into the linguistics of this region, carried also into Bataan and across the mountain into Pampanga and Tarlac, may throw more light on this very interesting and important subject and may reveal traces of an original Negrito dialect. Prominent natives of Zam? bales, whom I have questioned, and who are familiar with the subject, affirm that the Negritos know only the dialect of Zambal. Indeed those are not lacking who believe in a blood relationship between the Negritos and the Zambal, but this belief cannot be taken seriously. Reed then gives a comparative vocabulary (pp. 80-83) of one hundred entries (with some omissions) for Zambal of Bolinao, Zambal of Iba, Zambal-Aeta, Zambal of Santa Fe, Aeta of Subic, Aeta of Bataan Province, Dumagat of Bulacan Province. The choice of Reed's words was not his own. These words were taken as Reed states on p. 83, from Montano 1885, and from manuscripts by C. J. Cooke and E. J. Simons in "The Ethnological Survey" (infra). In any case, Reed gave, considering the time he spent for his field work among the Negritos of Zambales, a good degree of attention to their language situation. Azcona is furthermore, as already stated, of the opinion that in Reed's monograph, any references to social life and social structure are lacking. Anent this statement it may be said that Reed entitles Chapter VI (pp. 55-67): "General Social Life," and in previous chapters he deals with such matters as group action in hunting (p. 47), as well as with games and dancing (pp. 49-51) which are part of social life. Reed might, as already remarked, not have been fully familiar with that kind of civilization to which his Negritos basically still belonged, but even so he bears witness of the existence of the local kinship group among the Negritos of the then (still) more remote areas of Zam? bales. It seems to be advisable to quote Reed (p. 70) about this point at length: Those Negritos still living in a wild state have very simple government. They simply gather around the most powerful man, whom they recognize as a sort of chief and whom they follow into raids on the plains or neighboring tribes of Negritos: But when peaceably scattered through their mountains each head of a family is a small autrocrat and rules his family and those of his sons who elect to remain with him. When he dies the oldest son becomes the head of the [extended] family. Usually, however, a group of families living in one locality recognizes one man as a capit?n. He may be chosen by the president of the nearest pueblo or by the Negritos themselves, who are quick to recognize in this way superior ability or greater wealth. The capit?n settles disputes between families. May it also be briefly mentioned that the preliminaries of a marriage and of the wedding ceremonies of the Negritos of Zambales des? cribed by Reed (pp. 56-60) have their parallels among other Philippine Negritos. Reed's description of the religion of the Negritos of Zambales (under the heading "Superstitions") appears to be somewhat in? adequate in spite of its relative length (pp. 65-67). However, in his vivid description of their hunting activities (pp. 44-48), he gives proof (p. 48) of the existence of what could be called a "primitial" sacrifice or "first offer? ing" (cf. Kern 1960:97; Koppers 1952:183). The prayer accompanying the ceremony is clearly a prayer of thanksgiving. Reed therefore seems to give a partly wrong interpretation when he says that the purpose of the ceremony is to "feed and appease" the spirits (p. 48; cf. p. 65). May it be said in conclusion that the use of Reed's monograph is made somewhat difficult for two reasons. The first is that the logical arrangement of the report is rather poor. The second, that the text proper of only 61 pages contains 62 full-page illustrations on glossy paper. Thus, one has to search a little for the text pages. Furthermore, Reed's monograph is bound into one volume with Otto Scheerer's The Nahaloi Dialect, and Edward Y. Miller's The Bataks of Palawan. These handicaps make the use of Reed's work in some measure time consuming. As concerns the Plates, quite a few of them may be useful for future racial studies on the Philippine Negritos. Reed was accom? panied in his field work by a photographer, Mr. J. Diamond (p. 9).</page><page sequence="13">216 PHILIPPINE QUARTERLY OF CULTURE AND SOCIETY III. A. 3. The Beyer Papers We now come to the matter of the Beyer Papers. It is a difficult matter, and one cannot write about it without the fear of making mistakes. Father Joseph Baumgartner has given me considerable help for this part of the article; however, any mistakes re? main mine. I do hope that this whole article, but especially this section of it will, in spite of all short? comings, be a contribution to the history of Philip? pine ethnology. It is my further hope that other, in particular younger Philippine anthropologists, will take up the matter and shed further light on it. The first question that arises was already introduced above, viz.: Did the Barrows papers become part of the Beyer Papers? There seems to be little doubt about the matter. As Beyer was to explain in his introduction to Set 20 of the Philippine Ethnographic Series (Manuel 1958:48), henceforth PES, "There was turned over to me at this time [i.e., ca. 1917] by the Director of Science, to dispose of in whatever manner I deemed best, all of the former re? cords, papers, and correspondence of the old Bureau of Non-Christian Tribes, The Ethno? logical Survey, Division of Ethnology, and Philippine Museum. The mass of these papers was considerable and their condition deplo? rable. . .". Beyer himself had started collecting ethno? graphic material in 1911. At first his interest was focused on the Ifugao, but his search for such material gave him a growing "insight into the wealth of important and unpublished data (mostly buried in Government and Church re? cords) relating to the neighboring groups; and at the same time my interest was greatly broadened through a clearer understanding of the extensive inter-relationship and diverse ramifications of the different cultures." As Beyer began to cast his net in ever wider sweeps, an immense mass of papers began to accumulate. The task of sifting and ordering them also became more pressing. In response to this need "a more or less definite and work? able scheme for collecting information, classify? ing and copying it, and finally having it bound up in usable form, was developed and put into execution" by Beyer. Two events intervened to stop Beyer from going ahead with his plans: one was an "anti? cipated government ban on ethnographic work in 1914," accompanied by the abolition of the existing machinery (ethnological division of the Bureau of Science, elimination of employees and closing of the museum). The other was Beyer's appointment to the newly created chair of Anthropology and Ethnology at the University of the Philippines. By 1917, with the routine work of teaching and administering his department fairly well settled, Beyer was able to resume where he had left off in 1914. As he remarks (preface, ibid.) "the impetus of the fresh start in 1917 was such that during 1918 and 1919 no less than forty-five volumes of text and plates were completed and bound up, and a number of other volumes partially prepared" (Manuel 1958:47f.). Eventually there would be a total of "about 150 volumes" (Manuel 1967:24). According to Azcona, p. 211, footnote 11, the completed Series consists of 165 volumes. In his 1967 symposium address, Manuel briefly speaks about another collection of papers which Beyer compiled during his active years, "Philippine Customary Law," comprising 11 volumes, which he edited together with Dr. F. D. Holleman "a Dutch scholar of inter? national repute" (Manuel in Zamora 1967:26). According to Azcona, Holleman came to Manila in 1930 for three months; his work was subsidized by the American Council of Learned Societies (Azcona 1975:213). According to Beyer, Holleman seems to have been in Manila 1931. We quote Beyer from Manuel (1958:48 f.): In 1931 ... the new period of intensive work on my ethnographic series was made necessary by the customary law investigation?with Dr. Holleman? which resulted in the addition of a new ten-volume set on Philippine Customary Law to my ethnographic series during that year. In order to adequately get at and compile the customary law material, it was necessary to proceed with the working and binding of my ethnographic series at an unusually rapid rate. The result, of course, was the addition of many completed volumes or papers to my various sets....</page><page sequence="14">Rahmann/THE PHILIPPINE NEGRITOS 217 Beyer then goes on to say that due to lack of funds and the shifting of his interest to archaeology, he had to suspend any special work on the ethnographic series until near the end of 1932. Manuel adds that due to Beyer's "engrossment in Philippine archaeology in later years the ethnographic series had to suffer. Much material accumulated from year to year has remained in raw form, uncopied and un? classified." To return to the "Philippine Customary Law," it may be pointed out that its relation? ship to the PES is not entirely clear. Holleman was expected to select pertinent material from about 3000 papers and to arrange it by regions. The result of his labors, which lasted, as already indicated, a bare three months, are vols. 3 to 9 of the Collection. Vols. 1 and 2 were compiled by Beyer himself, with contributions from his own pen and papers written by his students. What vols. 10 and 11, which according to Manuel must have formed part of the col? lection, contained, I am not able to ascertain. Beyer himself speaks of 10 volumes (supra). Both Bornemann and Azcona know of only 9 volumes (Manuel in Zamora 1967:26; Azcona 1975:211?the part of Holleman in the com? pilation work should not be overestimated). The foregoing digression was in my opinion necessary in order to know the setting in which the Negrito papers appear. The part dealing with the Negritos is found in vol. 9 of what, for brevity's sake, I shall call the Beyer-Holleman Collection (henceforth BHC). The material for this volume was drawn from the PES, set 17: Negrito-Aeta. The latter consists of a total of five volumes, but vol. 4 consists entirely of Plates. Azcona does not say anything about vol. 5 (which, according to Manuel's list con? tained more original reports?Papers 91-100). In some way, to this material also belongs Paper 107 "Life of the Mountain People near the Town of Calinog, Iloilo," by Norberto Castronuevo, Feb. 1924, 18pp. Possibly this volume is a later addition to PES that was not available at the time the BHC was complied. Azcona lists in his Bibliography a total of 43 papers (see Appendix I of this article) which, mostly in the form of extracts, were incor porated in the Negrito volume. Among these papers is an introduction, written by Beyer, and a nine-page excerpt from Montano's des? cription of the Negritos of Bataan (J. Montano, Rapport aM. leMinistre d} Instruction Publique sur une mission aux lies Philippines et en Malaisie (Archives des missions scientifiques et litteraires . . . Paris 1885); cf. Montano 1886; viii). III. B. John M. Garvan I. Biodata. - Bornemann (1955:90If.), who made a painstaking search for the biodata on Garvan, states that we possess only a few verified data. Garvan was born on November 19, 1875. No reliable documentary evidence exists about the place of his birth. Bornemann is inclined to assume that Garvan avoided men? tioning his birthplace because he did not want to draw attention to the fact that he was not born in the United States. The (U.S.A.) "Official Roster of the Civil Service of the Philippines" mentions for 1904 as birthplace "Oregon"; the Roster for 1905 omits the entry whilst that for 1907 mentions "Ireland." According to Beyer, Garvan was born in poor circumstances in a suburb of Dublin. In an application dated May 18,1903, to the (U.S.A.)</page><page sequence="15">218 PHILIPPINE QUARTERLY OF CULTURE AND SOCIETY Bureau of Insular Affairs he writes: "My classical studies I completed in Conglowes Wood College, Ireland." He was in the United States at the age of about twenty. From the end of 1895 or beginning of 1896, he attended for three years a College in the State of Louisiana and studied Philosophy, Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry, but uncertainty exists about the college at which he studied. In an application to the Bureau of Insular Affairs, dated May 18, 1903, he writes: "I made a very strong . . . course for proficiency in which I received the degree of Master of Arts from the College of the Immaculate Conception, New Orleans, Louisiana (1898)." However, the Re? cords of which he encloses copies are from St. Charles College in Grand Couteau, Louisiana. Moreover, no Master's degree is mentioned therein; it simply states: ". . . gave complete satisfaction while going through the following studies. . ." This uncertainty concerning his Master's degree is still augmented by the fact that Garvan writes later in Philippine Magazine, September 1934 (p. 399): "M.A. (Dublin)." In the same magazine of the same year he adds on p. 323 to the printed "M.A." in handwriting "British", and similarly, on p. 387: "Ireland." ?See the reproduction in the microfilm edition of Garvan's manuscript: Garvan?Bornemann 1954:55, 63, 66. In an application of 1926 Garvan mentions his "Master's degree at Trinity College, Dublin, Ireland." Bornemann's inquiries in Dublin resulted in negative answers. The answer of the University of Dublin, Trinity College, dated October 6, 1955, was: "I have been unable to find his name appearing in either set of records." The answer of the National University of Ireland, dated October 18,1955, was: "I am unable to trace that name in the records of this University" (Bornemann 1955:902). After giving these data, Bornemann makes (p.903) the following noteworthy remark: If these uncertainties and contradictions in rather elementary matters of his own life are no reason to simply doubt the trustworthiness of Garvan's great ethnographic reports (on the Manobo and the Negritos), they are certainly to be taken into consideration in the final evaluation of his work. After the completion of his studies Garvan was, according to his statement, for "five years" a teacher in various Colleges: two years at St. Charles' College in Grand Couteau, Louisiana; about ten months at St. Mary's College in Oakland, California; then one year at the College of Our Lady of Lourdes in South Park, Washington. These add up to just four years and they are attested by the records which he encloses in his application to the Bureau of Insular Affairs. For the Application he used the stationery of Columbia University (sic), University Park, Oregon, which suggests the possibility that he studied or taught there. His last stay in the United States may have been at the University of Notre Dame. The docu? ments mention his excellent qualities as a teacher. He himself mentions his "great control of boys. My education qualifies me to teach al? most any branch, but my inclinations and past experiences predispose me to the teaching of Latin, Greek, French and Spanish." In the beginning of 1903, after having ob? tained American citizenship the year before, Garvan applied for a position as teacher in the Philippines. In June 13, 1903, he received from the War Department, Bureau of Insular Affairs, communication of his provisional appointment. Thus Garvan left in July 1903, when nearly thirty years old, for the Philippines. However, after four years (May 23, 1907), he severed his connection with the Philippine Civil Service but he remained in the Philippines (Bornemann, 1955:903). As Bornemann puts it, this was the start of a period in Garvan's life characterized by repeat? ed ups and down, and a definite downward trend. For years, so it seems, he looked for his economic security as merchant in the interior of the islands. In sober hours he seemed to have been conscious of his personal weakness [alcohol], but in the long run he was over? whelmed by that weakness. His last conflict during his years as a teacher was with the famous Jesuit missionary in Mindanao, Father Saturnino Urios, of whom he speaks, however, with great respect in his Man ob o monograph (Garvan 1931:250).</page><page sequence="16">Rahmann/THE PHILIPPINE NEGRITOS 219 Bornemann then qoutes a piece of in? formation which I had sent him from Cebu City on June 24, 1952, and which I obtained from Miguel Matildo, then a student for the Master's degree at the University of San Carlos. In turn, Matildo had received the information from Manobos who had known Garvan personally. Bornemann remarks rightly that this in? formation, which shows the style of life he could adopt in the interior of Mindanao, would retain its value, even if not all details should prove to be true. This is the information I for? warded from Miguel Matildo to Bornemann: Garvan visited most of the places occupied by the Manobo tribe. According to some old Manobos, he worked, ate and danced with them. He colored his teeth, chewed their betel nut, spoke their language, and wore i their clothings. He went with them hunt? ing and fishing in the lakes and in the tribularis of the Agusan River. He joined them in their religious feasts and ceremonies. My informants said that when Garvan and a group of Manobos came down on a raft to Butuan, the capital of Agusan, and they happened to meet some Americans, he did not stop for a chat. He was always with his Manobo com? panions. Azcona (p. 229, footnote 52) mistakenly states that Matildo did field work among the Negritos of Mindanao. He actually worked among the Manobo (Matildo 1953). Later, around 1928, Garvan began looking back on the positive aspects of his past years. He called himself "ethnologist for the Philip? pine Government, Lecturer in Philippine Tribes in the University of the Philippines, Secretary and Interpreter of Sulu Chiefs." In a mimeo? graphed application of the same time, Garvan listed his previous occupations: "Organizer, investigator, statistician, explorer, governor and conciliator, ethnologist, translator, professor, journalist, haciendero, author, reviewer, lec? turer and purchaser of curios, secretary and political adviser to the Sultan of Sulu." In various ways, even in his personal troubles, he had, at that time, the support of H. Otley Beyer. To him Garvan frequently sent his first field reports and he must have received useful suggestions from Beyer. Around 1924-25 Garvan returned to the United States. On his way there (or even earlier) he might have spent some time in Japan, South-China, and Malacca. In 1926 he lived in Berkeley, California. Two years later, he was given the opportunity to work for a year or two on part of his materials in the Department of Anthropology at the University of California (Berkeley). In 1938, he entrusted some of his manuscripts to Professor J. M. Cooper of the Catholic University of America, Washington, D.C. (file entry of Cooper, Sep? tember 9, 1938). In a note inserted in the Negrito manuscript by Professor A. L. Kroeber on December 22, 1941, Kroeber presupposes the death of Garvan; so he would have died between the 63rd and 64th year of his life. Could it be concluded from the fact that Garvan entrusted some of his manuscripts to Professor (Monsignor) Cooper that he found in the priest a personal friend? ? A number of years ago I (R.R.) heard of a rumor that Garvan died in Burma. I mention this because it may one day be helpful in obtaining more certainty about the last years of Garvan's life. Bornemann concludes his sketch of Garvan's life with the remark that these few data about which we can be certain, allow the outsider to sense something of the tragedy that character? ized the outward course of Garvan's life whilst his literary legacy proves him to have been a talented man with a vast store of knowledge (Bornemann 1955:901-905). III. B. 2. Garvan's Negrito manuscript This seems to be the place to remark that Wilhelm Schmidt learned about Garvan's Negrito manuscript from a paper which John M. Copper had published in 1940 on cultural relations among the Southeast Asian Negritos (see References). Since 1947 Schmidt had tried to get that manuscript (Bornemann 1955: 899). Certainly Schmidt also knew the 1941 publication of Cooper, into which the foregoing paper had been incorporated. Because of the exor? bitant costs for the printing of the voluminous manuscript, Cooper had already thought of a micro? film edition. Hie plan was, however, not carried out, as Professor Regina Flannery-Herzfeld, first Cooper's assistant and then his successor, wrote to Fr.</page><page sequence="17">220 PHILIPPINE QUARTERLY OF CULTURE AND SOCIETY Schmidt on April 15, 1950 (Bornemann, loc. cit., footnote 2). After devoting about two pages to Garvan's scientific work in general, Bornemann deals with the versions of his Negrito manuscript and its origin. He distinguishes three main versions, calling them Ms A, Ms B, Ms C; there are other versions. a) Ms A. - In the fall of 1949, Father Schmidt received from the Department of Anthropology, Catholic University, Washington, D.C, a micro? film of the manuscript materials which Garvan himself had entrusted to Cooper in 1938 (supra). This microfilm had, as Bornemann points out (p. 908), some technical short? comings, e.g., it began with Chapter 22, and the first part followed after the last chapter. Schmidt's very minute study of Garvan is based on this microfilm. He was then already an octogenarian, and it was the first time that he worked with microfilm and reader. He went patiently three times through the whole micro? film, all the while taking notes and re-arranging the material. These notes are now part of the Anthropos microfilm-edition of Garvan's work. In this edition (Garvan-Bornemann 1954), the technical deficiencies of the Wasliington micro? film were eliminated and several improvements made. b) Ms. B. ? At (about) the same time that the Anthropos Institute received Ms A, Professor R. Lowie (Department of Anthropology, Uni? versity of California, Berkeley) sent to the Institute another copy of Garvan's manuscript, which Bornemann calls Ms B. This copy is in several respects different from the Washington copy. Ms B is in its entirety typewritten on yellow paper. It is, according to Bornemann, not an original but a carbon copy. On the other hand, Ms A is in all parts which are found in A and B, an original copy; and it is clearly that copy of which B is (in the same process of typing) a carbon copy. The length of lines, the typing errors, corrections made during the typing, etc., correspond with one another exactly; the character of the types is also identical. On the other hand, Ms A contains parts which are not found in Ms B. Bornemann gives the following details: Of the total of 1000 pages of Ms A, three hundred pages are missing in Ms B. As far as the contents are concerned, the difference is not quite as big because in the parts which Ms A has over and above Ms B, there are repetitions. Moreover, it has many hand-written pages which contain fewer words than the typed pages. Among the machine written pages there are sections which are not original but carbon copies, e.g., the long Chapter 31, comprising over 100 pages and containing reports from the Archives of Manila. Ms B also lacks the galley proofs of an article: "Our Philippine Pygmies?a remnant of an ancient race" (1001-1004). c) Ms C. ? Sent together with Ms A which the Anthropos Institute received from Washington, D.C., was a bundle of mostly hand-written pages, altogether about 475. There is strong evidence, so Bornemann states, that they are part of that hand-written copy of Garvan, which was afterwards typewritten. However, the Ms contains only a few complete or in? complete chapters, viz., Chapters 16-19, 25, 28, 30 and 32 of Ms A. Several checks proved the identity of the handwritten copy C with Ms A. In the opinion of Bornemann an exact comparison is superfluous because we have in A a copy that was completed and approved by the author. d) Other manuscript forms. Bornemann refers (p. 909) to a statement in the aforementioned two publications of Cooper about Garvan's work. Cooper cites (see Cooper 1941:24, foot? note 25): "J. M. Garvan, The Pygmies of the Philippines. Ms." He adds: "(copies in the Department of Anthropology, University of California [original], Catholic University of America [carbon]." Bornemann then refers to his statement that the copy which was sent to Anthropos Institute from Washington, D.C. is, in its biggest part original, therefore not "car? bon" and the copy from Berkeley was in its entirety not "original" but "carbon". He gives further reasons that this must have been the situation concerning the two manuscript copies. Bornemann concludes that, as far as evidences allow, Ms B is identical with the manuscript</page><page sequence="18">Rahmann/THE PHILIPPINE NEGRITOS 221 which Garvan (according to a note of Professor Kroeber, dated December 22, 1941) completed and handed over to the University of California around 1930, and which was then copied around 1935. The university kept a carbon copy of it. Other copies were given to Garvan, among them the original copy. It was this original copy of the "recopy" of 1935, Bornemann continues to reason, that was entrusted by Garvan to Professor Cooper. However, Garvan first checked that copy, cor? rected it, and completed it with short remarks as well as lengthy insertions either in machine script or in handwriting. Bornemann remarks in conclusion that we owe the preservation of the extensive Ms A to Garvan's confidence in Professor Cooper and to the care which Cooper himself as well as Professor Regina Flannery Herzfeld bestowed on this manuscript (Bornemann 1955:905-910). III. B. 3. The contents of Garvan's Negrito manuscript and Bornemann's evaluation of it. Bornemann deals first with the contents of Garvan's manuscript (Appendix II of this article gives the chapter titles of the manuscript. The reader will notice Garvan's love for alliterations). Bornemann begins with the Table of Contents and states that a comparison of the "extra? ordinary great wealth of data" contained in Garvan's Negrito manuscript and in his mono? graph on the Manobo reveals the latter to be a much more thorough scholarly study whilst the Negrito manuscript has not been completed, in so far as can be seen from its content. The literature used is not worked into the Negrito manuscript but remains external to it; this is especially true of Chapters 30 and 31. In Chapter 30, Garvan offers a compilation from literature. In a previous section (p. 913) Bor? nemann remarks that this chapter reveals how early Government and Church had already occupied themselves with the problems posed by the Negritos. But he adds that these ex? cerpts can be used only after a thorough critique of the sources. In Chapter 31 (100 pages) unpublished materials belonging to the years 1900-1915 are made use of. Bornemann praises this chapter because of the meticulous listing and arrangement of all data. Notwith? standing the shortcomings in Chapters 30 and 31, he considers these two chapters which list the data collected by others, methodologically (formellJthe best chapters in the whole manus? cript (p. 913). In the evaluation of Garvan's manuscript Bornemann deals a) with its unfinished state, b) the generalizations therein, c) the relative formlessness (Ungeformtheit) of Negrito cul? ture, d) and Garvan's world view. As to a). In the manuscripts (B and A) there are notes made by the typist that show that she was not clear about the sequence of pages, etc. There are unintelligible texts and doubts about some statements, and the remarks thereto show that a competent person went through the manuscript material. But in his own check? ing of the scripts, Garvan very seldom gave his comments on such questions, seemingly be? cause he could not answer them. Bornemann thinks (p. 915) that therein we have an indirect proof of the reliability of his other statements. As to b), Garvan localized many of his des? criptions. This can, e.g., be seen from the geographical synthesis of W. Schmidt who, in his eighties (supraj, arranged with the conscious? ness of a serious doctorand the geographical aspects of Garvan's reports (Bornemann 1955: 925-927 ;Garvan-Bornemann 1954:1075-1154). However, Garvan frequently mentions only the part of the island concerned, not the exact habitat; still less frequently, he states the year during which he made an observation (and his research extended over fifteen years). Since it will presently be seen that Garvan pays so much attention to the fluctuations in Negrito culture, a greater exactness in mentioning the localities in which he made his observations could have been expected. Bornemann remarks that we would, for instance, like to know whether Garvan's important statement that only songs for the dead have legendary motifs and are sung only during night, holds good for all groups, or only for some and, if so, for which ones. ? (For more about singing among the Negrito, see Garvan-Hochegger 1964:148f.). Bornemann goes on to say that besides detailed individual observations which fill the</page><page sequence="19">222 PHILIPPINE QUARTERLY OF CULTURE AND SOCIETY biggest part of Garvan's work, large sections are also devoted to the description of Negrito culture as such. Moreover, even his individual descriptions are frequently interwoven with general judgments. As a matter of fact, there is the unmistakable tendency of drawing a general? ized image of the Negrito. Even if drawing such a picture were warranted, Bornemann thinks it desirable to indicate among which groups the pertinent observations were made, especially since the Filipino Negrito groups are separated from each other by large distances. The demand for monographs on the various groups is especially applicable in this case. As to c). In contradiction to Garvan's generalizations, there are more specific obser? vations on the multiformity and variety of the elements of Negrito culture, and on the con? tinuous change of these forms from group to group, as well as within the group and the individual. Garvan observes that the customs and beliefs in connection with planting and harvesting are found "in almost infinite variety." (For some details, see Garvan Hochegger 1964:78). There is, according to Garvan, much arbitrariness and fortuitousness in the matter of incest tabus. Whilst he speaks of a traditional form for the hair comb, the little bag used for betel nuts, tobacco, etc., varies from group to group and within the individual group. This variety of forms also holds true of earrings (cf. Garvan-Hochegger 1964:137;40 f.). Clearly dis? tinguished from each other are the religious dances and those for entertainment (festive dances); the varieties thereof are so numerous that their description would fill a whole volume. Although hardly the same text is sung twice, characteristic geographical zones can be recognized (see, e.g., Garvan-Hochegger 1964: 146 ff.). Among the menstruation and preg? nancy taboos some similarities are found, but there are also differences from group to group which have set in with the passage of time (see Garvan-Hochegger 1964:129, 132 f.). Concern? ing "taboo-like rules and magic" (exact head? ing in Hochegger) Garvan writes: "I have deliberately omitted a very great deal of material because it seems so puerile and in many cases contradictory" (Garvan-Hochegger 1964:208). Puerile and contradictory or not, it is the first duty of an ethnographer to report accurately his findings. In order to show that a deeper study of such phenomena seems to be necessary, I quote once more from Garvan and add Hochegger's annotation on Garvan's state? ment. Garvan writes: Among our Pygmies, as amongst ourselves, ideas wax and wane and what was bad at one time might become indifferent or even good at another, and what one group might consider harmful, another group might deem to be beneficial (Garvan Hochegger 1964:129). On this statement Hochegger comments (p. 257): It should be mentioned here that such con? tradictions are found frequently within the mor? phology of the taboo. As reliable authors pointed out, this phenomenon is based on the fact that tabooed things and/or acts are sometimes thought to have contrary values or qualities, i.e., they are ambivalent. Hochegger then refers to Eliade's treatment of this problem (see Eliade 1958:14-19).?Hochegger consulted the French original of Eliade's work: Traite d' histoire des religions, 1949, 2nd edition, 1959. On the other hand, Bornemann values as a highly positive element the fact that the mere presentation of these differences by Garvan, if it is reliable, reveals the vivacity and creative activity of these Negritos which surpasses everything that W. Schmidt said about the fully human qualities of the man of his Urkultur. Bornemann concludes this paragraph with the basic statement that constancy cannot a priori be postulated for any culture. He adds that no other monograph on foodgatherers has pointed out this principle as clearly as Garvan's has. As to d). In the critique of W. Schmidt's theses on the primordial conditions of man? kind, with monotheism and monogamy, etc., the ideological a priori of Schmidt, so Borne? mann states, has been offered as an explanation of his allegedly idealized descriptions of pri? mordial times. In reality, the basis for Schmidt's starting position was mainly the conditions obtaining among the short-statured peoples.</page><page sequence="20">Rahmann / THE PHILIPPINE NEGRITOS 223 Whoever reads the three first chapters and many other parts of Garvan's work will get the impression of having authentic "Schmidtian" descriptions before him. However, it is prac? tically certain that Garvan did not know Schmidt's writings, and there seems to be no evidence that Beyer may have introduced Garvan to Schmidt's works. The similarity between Schmidt's and Garvan's presentations and views acquires more significance when we consider the fact that Garvan, although brought up as a Catholic, showed, so Bornemann holds, at the time of his field work an anti-Christian, if not anti-religious attitude. Azcona (p. 243, footnote 71) is, however, of the opinion that it is not justifiable to con? clude from some of Garvan's statements or from the fact that he wanted to keep Christian? ity away from the Negritos that his attitude towards religion and his evaluation of it was negative. It is to be appreciated that Azcona rises to the defense of Garvan in this respect. But the matter to be considered here is not so much Garvan's personal attitude towards religion as his reliability in dealing with the religion of the Negritos. And in this respect Bomemann's view still deserves to be heeded and to be taken as a guideline. Previously, two shortcomings of Garvan's work were mentioned: the unfinished state of his manuscript and the generalizations therein. As far as religion is concerned, a third short? coming must be added: Garvan's somewhat negative evaluation of his data. It is true that Garvan makes an excellent basic announcement about his approach in gathering data on the religion of the Negritos. He writes: In arriving at conclusions in these matters I made every effort to secure the truth and based the fol? lowing information on information furnished me for my own guidance and protection on hundreds of other occasions when my informants had no motives to mislead me (Garvan-Hochegger 1964: 211. - All quotations in this section are taken from the Hochegger edition). Garvan goes on to say (p. 211): Just as we found that the Pygmies lacked clothes and so many other things in a material way and slavery and other institutions in a social way, so we find that in religion they lack sacrifices, idols, religious charms and fetiches. Even charms are not found as frequently as among other forest and mountain tribes; nor are there sacred places except in a few places such as Zambales where an odd rock or cave would be looked upon as inhabited by one spirit or another. Leaving aside Garvan's contradictory state? ments about nudity and dress among the Negritos (cf. p. 211 and pp. 36-40; Hochegger's arrangement of the manuscript?infra), it is difficult to see no contradiction in first saying that the Negritos "lack. . . religious charms and fetiches" and then state immediately after that "even charms are not found as frequently as among other. . . tribes." His assertion that the Negritos lack sacrifices is modified by the other statement (p. 228): "It should be noted from the beginning that with very few exceptions there are no sacrifices in Pygmy dorn, and with not many more exceptions, few offerings." About religion itself he then makes the statement: In religion too we find no trace of ethics nor of sinfulness as among ourselves. A thing is good or bad because long tradition in the inner sense of every individual tells him there is good and bad. Hochegger remarks rightly in his annotations (p. 207) that "this sentence remains unin? telligible," for according to Garvan's own account, the Negritos in Zambales believe in a supreme spirit (the existence of whom Garvan admits for some groups, and "even a number of contiguous groups"), whom they call Kadai and "who became angry with humankind because of the commission of some such things as murder incest and so on" (p. 227). Kadai, "chief of all supernatural spirits" of the Pinatubo Negritos, was supposed (we keep Garvan's past tense) "to indicate his displeasure by speaking through the thunder." Garvan then goes on to say that Kadai "had certain likes and dislikes such as for instance that quarry should be quartered in a certain way and so on and so on" (p. 227). One cannot help thinking that Garvan portrays Kadai as a whimsical old man. Neither an ethnographer nor an ethnologist will, as a rule, express him? self that way. Even so, the data which Garvan</page><page sequence="21">224 PHILIPPINE QUARTERLY OF CULTURE AND SOCIETY reports remain valuable; and such elements as fear of incest and murder as well as of thunder, and the rules concerning the quartering of animals, will have to be considered in a solid methodological way when questions about the religious beliefs and the ethical views of the Negritos have to be answered. One more instance to show that there are contradictions in Garvan should be mentioned here; what is said is again based on Bornemann (p. 922). Garvan states that the little Negrito "grows up in an atmosphere of human loving ness, free from dogma, don't's and drill." Such a sentence would never be made by Schmidt; and Garvan himself would never state that if he held on to another, earlier statement: "The main motive that seems to guide the Pygmy in his daily life is not to distress the dead. Another principle is that this or the other thing will bring good or bad luck. These ideas, together with the natural imitativeness and ambition to be like their elders, are sufficient to explain the human lines along which they grow." But there is also among these human lines the reverence towards their ancestors in the world beyond. A further investigation (so Bornemann believes) would show that this world of the beyond (not only the dead there? in) plays, according to Garvan's presentation, a greater role in the life of the Negritos than he admits in some of his assertions. Even in his description of Negrito personality, which is in praise of the naturally-good man, several times, though incidentally, the world of the beyond, inclusive of the dead, is mentioned; and to the "things of honor in a Pygmy group" also be? longs the admonition "to remember the dead." Bornemann concludes that with all the caution which is, in the interest of truth, required when one is confronted with an idealizing extreme, the assumption is warranted, and this on the basis of Garvan's own material, that Garvan did not do justice to the religious element in the life of the Philippine Negritos. III. B. 4. Azcona's analysis of Garvan Azcona has made an excellent contribution to the study of Garvan. A few almost inevitable shortcomings therein largely stem from the fact that he has not yet had, as already stated, a chance of field experience with the Philip? pine Negritos. In the first part, his analysis deals with Garvan and his work; in the second, mainly with Garvan as a researcher (field worker); and in the third, with Garvan's report, i.e., his manuscript. The last part contains a categorizing of the various aspects of Negrito life described by Garvan and an inquiry into the scientific reliability (Wissenschaftlichkeit) of the report as well as into the question of its originality. ? In this summary of Azcona's analysis and his comments, efforts are made to avoid repetitions. Azcona had, of course, to base his study of Garvan to a good extent on Bornemann. He also had to take into consideration Hochegger's edition of Garvan. About this edition Azcona remarks that several deviations (AbweichungenJ are found therein, e.g., a change of the data about Mindanao, Alabat (island in the Lamon Bay, belonging to Quezon Province, eastern Luzon) and Palawan. He mentions that Rahmann and Maceda were expected to publish the data about the Mamanua of Mindanao (infra). The minority groups of Alabat and Palawan were not considered Negritos by Hochegger (and Schebesta); consequently, Garvan's data about them were omitted in the book edition. The same happened with a series of interpretations which, in most cases, were considered by Hochegger (and Azcona) as unimportant remarks of Garvan. Other omissions, however, would have made possible, according to Azcona, a better judgment about the reliability and the value of Garvan's manus? cript (Azcona 1975:225). This last point is certainly to be considered in the final evaluation of Garvan's work. Basing his judgment on Garvan's own state? ments, Azcona finds that Garvan was critical of himself, although not always free from pre? conceived ideas, and critical of informants (p. 230 f.). A few points may now be singled out for comment, viz., the peculiarity of Garvan's approach in his field work; his knowledge of languages; and his originality or his dependence on other sources.</page><page sequence="22">Rahmann / THE PHILIPPINE NEGRITOS 225 As concerns Garvan's approach in his field work, Azcona makes the felicitous statement that Garvan (who was not a trained ethnologist) adopted (so to speak, anticipated) in his field work a method which has, since B. Malrnowski's research among the Triobriand islanders, been designated "participant observation." For Garvan it meant sharing the daily life of the Negritos and even playing with their children (p. 227, 250). Because of Garvan's excellent gift of observation, this method yielded detail? ed and exact descriptions which are enhanced by Garvan's ability to write (p. 228). However, contrary to Malinowski, Garvan did not have the ability to point out the functional interrelation and inner dynamics of the various aspects of Negrito culture. As an amateur field worker, so Azcona remarks (p. 231), he had no preparation for analytic work of that kind. This then, it may be added, makes more understandable Schebesta's view of Garvan whom he (Schebesta) criticizes, inter alia, for his journalistic style, his subject? ive reasoning, and his chattiness (cf. Azcona, p. 226). Regarding Garvan's knowledge of languages, Azcona writes (p. 229) that Garvan seems to have known many (zahlreiche) Negrito dialects. Since Azcona could be familiar only in a general way with the language situation as it apparently was in the early part of this century through his acquaintance with pertinent literature, such a statement seems to need specification in two respects. The first point concerns the number of Negrito dialects (languages) actually spoken at Garvan's time; the second pertains to his own knowledge of them. Knowledge does not of course, mean mastery; and Garvan also used, as Azcona notes, interpreters. Azcona himself admits that Garvan's chapter on the language (Ch. 29, see Appendix II; altogether 18 pages) is not well done. Bornemann (1955:912) considers it the weakest of all chapters. As he perceptively adds (p. 916, footnote 49), we have a legitimate interest in knowing Garvan's linguistic equip? ment in view of the statements Garvan makes about the most intimate spheres of Negrito life, and this in a generalizing fashion. After this has been said, it should be stated, however, that Azcona's view sounds acceptable and that Garvan was indeed well prepared for his field work also as far as his knowledge of languages is concerned, especially since many Negrito groups, as Azcona states, also knew the language of the neighboring population. Azcona men? tions Garvan's "vocabularies" (pi. - Vokabulare). Probably we can conclude from Manuel's re? port on the Beyer Collection (Manuel 1958:61) that what is meant here is Volume I of Set 17 of the "Philippine Ethnographic Series." I quote from Manuel: Set 17: Negrito-Aeta Volume 1: papers 1-19. 1 "Negrito Vocabulary," by John M. Garvan. Manila, 1914. 240 pp. 2 "Notes to Garvan's 'Negrito Vocabulary', by Edwin E. Schneider. Manila 1914. 70pp. As early as 1955 (1955:913, footnote 43), Bornemann offered to publish Garvan's language material in the Micro-Bibliotheca Anthropos. (Pro? bably that offer still stands even twenty years later! ). As concerns the problem of a Negrito language or Negrito languages of their own, attention is drawn to the papers of Headland and Baumgartner in this issue of the Quarterly. As concerns Garvan's originality, an in? vestigation into the matter is, according to Azcona, made difficult because Garvan hardly quotes other authors. That he did have ex? tensive knowledge of other contemporary sources when he prepared his manuscript at the University of California follows from his own statement: "I have looked over all the literature in this university and in the libraries in Manila" (quoted by Azcona, p. 246; see also Garvan-Hochegger 1964:194 f.). In particular there is the question whether Garvan made use of Father Vanoverbergh's 1925 article which could hardly have escaped his notice when he worked on his manuscript. It may also be assumed that he was in northern Luzon and did field work there. However Azcona's map (p. 223) of the parts of the Philippines where Garvan worked has no entry for northern Luzon; the two northernmost areas in it are Pampanga and Zambales.</page><page sequence="23">226 PHILIPPINE QUARTERLY OF CULTURE AND SOCIETY In this matter as well as in that of Garvan's dependence on the Beyer materials and other sources, it seems to this writer that originality is not proven as long as doubts remain. How? ever, the reliability of the data reported does not necessarily depend on their originality. Schebesta is, in spite his various misgivings about Garvan, of the opinion that Garvan's facts are credible (Schebesta II, 2, 1952:245). This may be the occasion to remark that Gusinde, in his sketch of the Aeta (1962:239-242), deliberate? ly omits Garvan'as a source (p. 241). Gusinde writes that Garvan's big manuscript is in several respects a reservoir of valuable individual data but that it does not fulfill, in every regard, the demands of a serious critique of sources. Gusinde's view is, however, of limited value because, although a great authority on the civilizations of foodgatherers, he had only a limited knowledge of the Philippine Negritos. On the other hand, he clearly saw the need for (the still lacking) comprehensive monographs on the various Negrito groups (p. 240). Azcona concludes (p. 251) his well-docu? mented study with the statement that Garvan, although not a trained ethnographer, intuitive? ly sensed the importance of that closeness bet? ween investigator and ethnic group which he had, and which enabled him to reach a deep understanding of the Negritos of the Philippines. And so, according to Azcona, Garvan's report is a rehab le document and, consequently, John M. Garvan can rightly be called "explorer of the [Philippine] Negritos" (Erforscher der Negritos). In bestowing that title on Garvan, Azcona was certainly aware that Schebesta had already con? sidered the same title for Garvan. However, Schebesta saw one condition for it unfulfilled. He stated: If Garvan had taken the trouble to systematically publish (the data of) his Aeta research, then he would today rightly hold the title ''Erforscher der Aeta" (Schebesta II, 2, 1957:245, footnote 1). But here again, as in the case of Gusinde, the critic's com? petence must be considered. Schebesta was rather late in getting acquainted with Garvan's manuscript (infra) and so he might not have been fully com? petent for passing an objective judgment on it. III. B. 5. Hochegger's book edition of Garvan's manuscript. We owe it to the initiative of Father Schebesta that the Garvan manuscript was finally published in book form. The edition was prepared by Hermann Hochegger who at that time attended Schebesta's lectures in ethnology and his ethnological seminar in the Mission Seminary of St. Gabriel's near Vienna. The book appeared in 1964 as Volume XIV of the Publications of the Institute of Ethno? logy of the University of Vienna (Institut fuer Voelkerkunde der Universitaet Wien). The printing was jointly financed by the Austrian Ministry of Education and Schebesta, Hochegger later continued his ethnological studies at the University of Paris from which he also ob? tained his Ph.D. He is the founder and now a mem berof the Centre d'Etudes Ethnologiques de Ban dundu, Zaire. In his Foreword to the book Schebesta says: My intention of making Garvan's work available in print needs no justification. Had it been published prior to 1938, I would hardly have thought it necessary to go to the Philippines in 1938-39. . . [Garvan] was, of course, able to gather more facts concerning the social and spiritual life of the Aeta than I could within just six months, and this under rather unfavorable circumstances. In Volume I of his three-part work on the Negritos in Asia, Schebesta had stated that a thorough, systematic investigation of the Aeta had, properly speaking, never taken place al? though there were more partial studies on the Aeta than on the Sem ang and Andamanese (Schebesta 1952:56 f.). Garvan was still un? known to Schebesta at that time. His name begins to appear only in Part II, 1 and is then mentioned frequently in Part II, 2. In his foreword to the Hochegger edition, Schebesta explains the choice of the title "The Negritos of the Philippines" instead of "The Pygmies of the Philippines," but he adds that Garvan's promiscuous use of the terms "Pygmy" and "Negrito" within the manuscript has been left unchanged. Schebesta writes: I am probably the only anthropologist who knows both the Asiatic Negritos and the African Pygmies</page><page sequence="24">Rahmann / THE PHILIPPINE NEGRITOS 227 by personal experience. A comparison showed that they form by no means -a racial or cultural unit, as had been claimed since the times of A. de Quatre fages and Father Schmidt. This justifies reserving the term "Pygmies" for the African dwarfs, for whom it had originally been coined, and calling the dwarf populations of Southeast Asia (Andamanese, Semang, Aeta) "Negritos". Schebesta then states that the "unusual form" of the Garvan manuscript "made critical editing necessary". Hochegger rearranged the material. His "Contents" of Garvan is given in Appendix III. A comparison with Appendix II shows the difference. Hochegger achieved fully what Schebesta (1957:245) considered possible, mainly to re? duce a 1000-page manuscript, as far as the con? tents are concerned, to a book of 300 pages. Moreover, he provided the fourteen chapters of his edition (Garvan-Hochegger 1964) with extensive annotations (pp. 237-271) which contain numerous references to the literature on the Negritos of the Philippines as well as on the Semang amd Andamanese. Azcona thinks (p. 226) that Hochegger's dependence upon Schebesta's hypothesis of the (original) unity of the Negrito culture (Aeta, Semang, Anda? manese) diminishes a little the personal con? tribution of Hochegger. Regarding this matter, it may be said that on principle it is valid to adopt an hypothesis of another scholar as one's own. It should also be noted that in his Annotations, Hochegger goes beyond Sche? besta's presentation of the subject matter. Hochegger omitted in his edition the first three chapters of Garvan's manuscript (see Appendix II). They had already been published in Anthropos about ten years earlier (Garvan 1955). As Hochegger remarks "they contain only sweeping generalizations and add nothing to the contents of the other chapters" (Garvan Hochegger 1964, p. 5, Introduction). Bor? nemann (1955:916, footnote 50) also felt that these three chapters show most clearly Garvan's generalizations. Garvan himself must have thought much of these three chapters since he published a large part of them in Philippine Magazine 1934 (see Bibliography). As far as their style is concerned, these three chapters are among the best elaborated (cf. Editor's Note to Garvan 1955, p. 769). Hochegger further remarks in his Introduction (p. 5) that the portion of Garvan's manuscript "dealing with the Mamanua of Mindanao has been work upon and sifted by J. Thiel, and will be pub? lished as a separate monograph by R. Rahmann and M. Maceda . . .". Unfortunately, other duties have prevented us from attending to that matter. How? ever, the long overdue monograph on the Mamanua is now in preparation. Another unpaid academic debt should be men? tioned in this connection. Bornemann writes (1955: 927, footnote 58) that I would publish in Anthropos 1956 an article on "The Solemn Religious Cere? monies of the Negritos of the Philippines." Because of my various duties I have also not found the time to write that article. To anticipate concretely what I am going to say in the Concluding Remarks to this paper, it may be stated at this point that these ceremonies would be a worthy scholarly topic for a younger anthropologist to work on. III. C. Morice Vanoverbergh, Paul Schebesta, Robert Fox, Marcelino Maceda, and others After going in detail into many questions in the foregoing section of this article, the writer feels that he should be brief from now on. As concerns Father Vanoverbergh, the Dedication in this issue of the Quarterly con? tains the desired information about his work as an explorer and the bibliography of his writings speaks for itself. In addition, there have been references to him in this article. As Azcona stresses, Vanoverbergh's contribution to the ethnography of the Philippine Negritos is especially noteworthy in the field of religion. Azcona rates Vanoverbergh's information about the soul, the belief in a Supreme Being, and his description of the prayer ceremony of the Negritos of northern Luzon as belonging to the most important parts of Negrito literature. His unique mastery of languages stood Vanover? bergh in good stead in his field work. In a more critical way, Azcona suggests that Vanoverbergh may at times have overshot the mark in his interpretations. Father Schebesta's name has come up very</page><page sequence="25">228 PHILIPPINE QUARTERLY OF CULTURE AND SOCIETY frequently in this article. One can actually not write on the Negritos of the Philippines, still less on those elsewhere in Southeast Asia, without referring continually to him. He did field work in the Philippines during the year 1938-39 for about six months (supra). In December 1938 and January 1939 he worked among the Negritos of Zambales and Bataan; in this he was greatly handicapped, as he remarks, by having to rely (rather unusual for him! ) on interpreters. In April-May 1939 he spent about three weeks among the Cama rines Negritos; then he made a brief visit to the Mountain Province where he studied a group of Negritos in the Palanan region. Later he was also briefly in southern Negros, where he met a mixed population of Negritos and "Bukid non". More important than these details of Sche besta's own work among the Philippine Negritos are the general insights he gained. During his six-month stay in the archipelago, he realized clearly how difficult field work among the Philippine Negritos was and why Negrito research in the Philippines had re? mained so backward. He expressed his regret that until then no explorer had been found to submit all Negrito tribes to a thorough study. When Schebesta wrote this, Garvan was not yet known to him but even so, his statement is still largely to the point. Schebesta goes on to say that Malaya demanded greater (physical) efforts and derpivations from an explorer; he was, however, compensated by the fact that he worked in a racially and ethnographically uniform territory where the deterioration (destruction) of Negrito culture had not yet progressed as far as in the Philippines. Among the Aeta, so Schebesta believes, only an ex? plorer who is well acquainted with the land and people and knows several languages would be able to do thorough work. Every other explorer would from the beginning be limited to partial results. The conditions as they existed in the Philippines explained why the ex? ploration of the Philippine Negritos had, in comparison with that on the Semang and Andamanese, remained so confused and piece? meal (Schebesta 1952:63-65). All in all, Azcona is certainly right when he calls Garvan, in spite of his limitations, "Explorer of the [Philippine] Negritos" (supra). In parenthesis it may be said that Schebesta can, until now, with equal right be called "The Ethnologist of the Negritos of Southeast Asia." Robert Fox's mainly ethnobotanical study of the Pinatubo Negritos (Zambales) proves the author to be an outstanding ethnographer; he has also made a name for himself as an out? standing archaeologist. Instead of going into the details of Fox's work (being in English, it is more readily accessible to our readers), I prefer to quote from the author's Introduction in which he expresses ideas that are similar to those of Schebesta and indirectly stresses the need for thorough future field work and comparative studies. Fox (1952:173 f.) writes (and the question may be asked whether he would substantially modify his views, now that Gar? van's work is known): One of the most challenging problems in Philip? pine ethnology is the search for those elements of culture of the Philippine pygmies ? tools, language, beliefs, and attitudes ? which might be held in common by the widely scattered Negrito groups, distinct from other Philippine people, and which might define basic elements of an earlier Negrito culture or cultures. The difficulties of this type of inquiry are mani? fold, for the Negritos, like other Philippine ethnic groups, have recently undergone tremendous cultural change, and it is necessary, in part, to reconstruct their past cultural activities through statements of the oldest informants. In addition, the Philippine pygmies have borrowed extensively from the culture of the surrounding people . . . and it is difficult to define which elements of their culture or cultures might be unique without a tremendous body of readily available data. Unfortunately, very little research has been completed among the Philippine Negritos. Most of the groups have never been studied thoroughly, and consequently few detailed and critical papers are available for comparative purposes. Another important publication that deserves mention is Nippold's work on the racial and cultural history of the Negrito peoples of Southeast Asia (Nippold 1936). (Unfortunate</page><page sequence="26">Rahmann / THE PHILIPPINE NEGRITOS 229 ly the copy of the book in the Library of the University of San Carlos could not be located in time). Suffice it to say that Schebesta places Nippold's book among those works which, though they do not take into view the entire problem of the research on short-statured peoples, offer nevertheless through a careful and critical compilation of all available data, an excellent racial and cultural history of these peoples, in Nippold's case, the Negritos of Southeast Asia (Schebesta I, 1952:ix). Bor? nemann also calls Nippold's book valuable, especially because of the rich and careful col? lection of sources (Bornemann 1955:928). Since the publication of Fox's monograph on the Pinatubo Negritos, the University of San Carlos has made a modest contribution to the study of the Negritos of northeastern Min? danao (Mamanua), and of northern Negros and Panay (see Rahmann and Maceda in the Biblio? graphy). Maceda's monograph on the Mamanua, which deserves special mention, was originally published in 1964; a photostatic reprint with a supplementary bibliography was published last year. As I stated in the Foreword (p. in) to this second edition, it is until now "the best and most handy survey on the Negritos of Southeast Asia in the English language, not? withstanding the fact that Maceda's starting point is always the Mamanua Negritos" (see the review of the second edition in this issue of the Quarterly by Gertrudes Ang). Silliman Univer? sity started in 1968 its own Negrito Action-Re? search Project in southern Negros (see Cadeina 1973:220). The Summer Institute of Linguis? tics likewise deserves mention. The three field reports published in this issue, namely by Estioko and Griffin, by Headland, and by Maceda, are a proof that field work among the Negritos is going on. We have to return to Bornemann once more. He states (Bornemann 1955:929) that Beyer, in his Introduction to the Negrito-Aeta Papers (Beyer-Holleman Series on Philippine Cus? tomary Law. Vol. IX, pp. 178-181), does not mention Garvan; but perhaps Beyer thought of him when he recommended in his introduction that the carrying out of major plans for the ex? ploration of the Negritos be postponed until the material already gathered on them had been systematically studied. In reality, so Bornemann remarks, this systematic study was continued without (or almost without) considering the Beyer materials, and certainly without con? sidering those of Garvan. Those involved in this task were W. Schmidt, W. Nippold, and P. Schebesta. No doubt their work of synthesis would have been more perfect if they had been able to make use of the ethnographic materials that were in Manila and Berkeley. But even so, theory ? and here we have to think especially of W. Schmidt ? stimulated field work. It began with Vanoverbergh. This progress in field work and systematic studies entailed a certain re-evaluation of the material collected by Gar? van. However, the scientific achievement of Garvan is, in large parts of his work, not out? dated. Bornemann already stressed this fact twenty years ago, and Azcona points it out anew. And anthropologists have to be thankful to Schmidt and Bornemann for having brought Garvan out of oblivion and making him inter? nationally known; to Azcona for having recent? ly made him still better known; as well as to Schebesta and Hochegger for having made Garvan's work accessible in book form. Finally, Bornemann's, Schebesta's, Fox's and Gusinde's appeals for more field work among the Philip? pine Negritos are largely still waiting to be heeded. However, this issue of the Quarterly gives proof that, to an appreciable extent, the desired work is going on. CONCLUDING REMARKS 1. The foodgatherer cultures are now, thanks to the extensive field work done among them, as well as to the intensive attention given to them by ethnologists during this century, rather well known, both somatologically as well as culturally. But there still exist many lacunae, especially in the knowledge about the Philip? pine Negritos. In this paper the fact as well as the reasons for this have been sufficiently inti? mated; and so have the procedures to be adopt? ed for filling the gaps: systematic field work among the various groups scattered over large areas of the archipelago and the subsequent</page><page sequence="27">230 PHILIPPINE QUARTERLY OF CULTURE AND SOCIETY publication of comprehensive monographs of a purely ethnographic (descriptive) nature. These monographs, together with the existing rather rich literature (which might, it is hoped, be further enriched by the data probably still hidden in older Spanish sources), would then make possible comparative studies on the dif? ferent aspects of the social, economic, and spiritual life of the various Negrito groups as well as on the culture change that is taking place among them. Such comparative studies may eventually put us in a position to ascertain what was in the past common to some groups of the Philippine Negritos and, perhaps, even to all of them. The comparison may then later be extended to the Semang and Andamanese as a check on Schebesta's hypothesis of a basic cultural unity of the Southeast Asian Negritos. There can be no doubt that the studies on the foodgatherers (or wildbooters) have con? tributed considerably to our knowledge of man's remote past and, by giving us a clearer image of early man, enhanced our understand? ing of man in general. Should intensive studies on the Philippine Negritos still add to that knowledge and delineate more clearly the image of the genuine humanism of early man, the gain would indeed be great. 2. The foregoing remarks are relevant to cultural (historical) anthropology. But social anthropology also, especially its noble humani? tarian oriented offshoot, applied anthropology, should have a full share in the scholarly en? deavor. Social anthropology will have to provide us with a deeper understanding of the various components of Negrito society and their function therein. As concerns applied anthro? pology, the reminder may be allowed that we have a faint anticipation of it in the early interest of State and Church in the well-being of the Negritos (supra, p. 221). Recently Fred Eggan has briefly but impressively written about this professional approach in anthro? pology (Eggan 1974). Although Eggan deals basically with the cultural minorities in the Mountain Province, his statements have a general validity, especially in what he has to say about the history of applied anthropology in the Philippines. Eggan writes (p. 207): In the Philippines, applied anthropology has come full circle, beginning with the early anthropologists who were perhaps the first "applied" anthropologists in the sense of professionally trained scholars applying their anthropological knowledge to admi? nistrative problems, through a period in which anthropological research was discouraged, to the pre? sent period where Filipino scholars are in a position to apply their special knowledge in more sophis? ticated ways. Filipino anthropologists will be par? ticularly helpful in evaluating the problems involved in reorienting social institutions and basic cultural beliefs as industrialization proceeds and population continues to expand. With regard to the cultural minorities they might also prevent the application of policies which may have costly effects. Here indeed is a task for Philippine anthro? pologists the performance of which will reflect true national concern and greatness. 3. Although the Garvan manuscript has, in its essence, been made easily accessible ever since it has been published in book form by Hochegger, an exact critique of sources will have to be based on the manuscript itself, now available in Bornemann's microfilm publication which can rightly be considered a critical edition. But the critique of sources will have to go further. All manuscripts and printed materials incorporated into Garvan's manus? cript which he included with inexact quotations or with no mention of his sources, will have to be checked against those sources. Furthermore, the Negrito papers listed in Appendix I will have to be checked against the reports from which they were condensed, viz., the papers collected in Beyer's "Philippine Ethnographic Series" (supra, p. 216), the ultimate source of most of the material. 4. The last remark is a kind of corollary. This paper has, although rather indirectly, brought out the fact that a very rich manus? cript material exists or existed in the "Beyer Collection." Manuel writes (1958:64) that these "unpublished materials form a formidable collection of ethnographic, historical and linguistic sources, and cover many more phases of Filipino culture." This unique national treasure certainly deserves unqualified care and poses a challenge for scholarly exploration.</page><page sequence="28">Rahmann/THE PHILIPPINE NEGRITOS 231 REFERENCES Azcona, Jesus 1975 Kritische Untersuchung ueber die neuere Negrito-Forschung mit besonderer Berueck sichtigung John M.
