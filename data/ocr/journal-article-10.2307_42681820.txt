The unusual form of the E for such an era is curious as having escaped the notice of so sagacious an investigator, and the same type published by Mionnet ( ij. p.290 &amp; pl.xxxv.

The first letter of the inscription, which is like a square sigma, is the JEolic Digamma, and from the ex- ample cited by Mr. Millingen on the coin, edited by him, of Hipponium, and its application among the Greeco-Italian states, was apparently an H.7 The difficulty of reading this name considerably embarrassed Eckhel, who felt disposed to consider it one of the Cretan dialect; if, however, accord- ing to the observations of Mr. Akerman, the © is a new power given to the O, or even the O itself,8 the term is reducible to HeÀicai/ooç or HtÂicavoç; in retaining the © it would be HcXica vOç. The only word approaching to either of them is that of Alcon, a Cretan archer;9 but the dialect of Crete, which, like the mythology of that island, was dis- tremely archaic mode of writing &lt;¡&gt;anmar or 0a kttiwv. The 3 semicircular letter is either a form of the digamma L used for a 0, or an imperfect «&gt; [Coins of Phocis or Phocea, &lt;j&gt; for &lt;/&gt;wKiaEU)v~] the M as a S in its most ancient form is attested by several mo- numents. Both these words much embarrassed Eckhel. 6 This name recais to mind that of Talus, son of Kres, and father of Hephaistos, and Talus the nephew of Daedalus. On the Hamilton vase No. 33, Hephaistus is called A AI A A AOS, and he with Ares (EycvaXioç) fights over Hera (hHpa) confined to the golden throne. If one could feel certain that the word TAAÍ1N referred to the figure, one would see in it the allusion to the metamorphosis of Talus into a partridge ; if not Talus we might recognise Icarus ; of Eros no other trace occurs either in the myth- ology or types. TaXwj/ is apparently, if rightly read, another form of the accusative TciXw which is in the Attic declension TaXw, and the whole mean 4ť the Cretans to Talus." He holds in each hand a ball (sphaera), with which he is playing. 7 For the value of this character, Cf.

I will, however, now proceed to consider the type of these remark- able coins, which have not hitherto, that I am aware of, received any certain explanation. The types of deities bearing in their hands the vital em- blems of their power are attested by a host of monuments : Poseidon holding the dolphin,10 Thetis with the same fish,11 Pallas- Athené holding on her hand the owl,12 Aphrodite holding the flower,13 are all to be found on monuments of the most ancient epochs. When the animal was too large, the sculptor or engraver placed it at the side ; and thus are found Dionusos, and the pard14 or goat,15 Hephaistos or Hebon,16 and the old Sileni with the ithyphallic mule,1® Artemis and the hind Arge, Hermes and the ram ; 17 while in the case of metamorphosis, the individual retained its anthropomorphic form, and the change was alluded to by the presence of the type, as Thetis with the snake round her arm,18 or lion upon the back of Peleus; or else the human type was blended with the animal, as the Achelous with a bull's body and human head, or with a fish's body, the horned human head of the river Gelas, &amp;c. One fine statue re- presents Apollo standing, having at his feet a swan;19 and the evidence of the works of ancient art as frequently in- dicates the type of a god by the presence of an animal, as 10 De Witte, Des. des Vases, 1837, p. 64. 11 De Witte, Desc. des Vases Peints, 8vo. 1837, p. 81. 12 Ibid. p. 51. 13 Ibid. p. 6. p. 64. 14 Ibid. p. 16. 15 Ibid. p. 25.

On the other hand, heroic personages seldom appear with animals, especially of the smaller kind ; and no connection can be traced between the protean emarifia, or armorial bearings of the fictile vases and the subjects represented, while the recognition of Idomeneus on the present coin is totally unsupported by other monuments, since he must be the solitary hero thus represented. Again, there is no reason to assign to Ido- meneus an androgynous type. Independent of the character, age, and circumstances of this hero never mentioning him in such a capacity, his form is rarely, if ever, seen upon works of ancient art, and, when depicted, was armed.18 Neither does the androgynous type apply to the son of Maia, whose personification is almost always attended with the kerukeion, or caduceus, the winged talaria, and the petasus, the inseparable attire of the archaic forms of Hermes, who, on the contrary, on the fictile vases of the earlier epoch, is always bearded. There are, however, several statues which represent Hermes as lord of the stadia, standing with this bird by his side; and for the same reason the cock appeared on the Hermaic steles of the stadia, and upon the helmet of Minerva.1^ This, however, appears to have been the recognised function of the bird in its warlike capacity, as connected with the Attic myths; for the vases of Vulci and Nola, offsets of the Athenian people, and perpetually offer- ing their traditions, always represent the bird of day with relation to some agon or contest of the Athenaia.20 On several of the class of vases inscribed Tov AOeveQtv aOXov , the cock appears on the Hermai ; and in one instance an 18 Paus. lib. v. fo.

This, in its turn, accounts for the per- petual presence and intervention of Pallas-Athené and Hermes in the Heracleid, as every labour may be considered an act of single combat by the hero against some individual power. Again, on the sepulchral monuments of the Athen- ians, Pallas-Athené crowns the leading individual of the myth ; and we may consequently recognise in her the Nike or Victory, as in Hermes, the brabeus, or umpire, whose functions at an earlier epoch were allied with KrjpvKEç , or heralds. The same objections do not apply to the story of Iphis," the daughter of Ligdus and Telethusa, and which is said to have given rise to the celebration of the Ecdysia23 (E icdvvia) in honour of Leto, for we might in the present type see the androgynous form of the virgin Iphis, yet there are several grave objections to this hypothesis. What con- nection has the plane tree on which the figure is seated with the story, and what has the bird of the god of day to do with it? Eckhel supposes it to represent an offering to Latona or Leto, an opinion which we shall subsequently examine. But the story of Iphis must be actually posterior to the coin, for the account of Ovid mixes up the tradition with the Isiac worship, whose appearance in the Cretan mythology is certainly of a period far more recent, - probably about the first century before our own era - unless it can be 21 Basseggio's Cat. p. 15. No. 50. 22 A different version of this story is given. Iphis is called Leu- cippe, her mother Galatea, her father Lamprus, and the deity who interposes her kind offices is Leto or Latona, not Isis. Cf. An- toninus, Lib. 17. After all, this is not a mythological change, and would consequently have scarcely appeared upon the coins. 23 Cf. Ovid. Metam. lib. ix. p. 665-796.</page><page sequence="6">74 NUMISMATIC CHRONICLE. conceded that the Latin poet has confused the functions of the Egyptian Ilithyia with her name.24 The only other hypothesis with regard to this type, is the one partially es- tablished by the French Numismatists, " Iasion peut être in which I suppose the fact of this bird being sacred to Demeter,25 has given rise to the supposition that this heroic personage, whose story must have been imported with the Arcadian colonists, may be meant. The loves of Iasion and the Telluric goddess, as mentioned in Hesiod to have taken place in Crete, are well known; but as the Telluric deities are not on the contemporaneous currency which offers infallible marks of the prevalence of the Doric myths, it is not probable that Iasion is meant ; and of this hero no hint of any androgynous type has ever been given. There are, consequently, only two circumstances in favour of the supposition of Iasion or Iasius ; the fact of this bird being sacred to Demeter, and the deification of this hero by the Arcadians, with the correlative circumstance of Phaestus having been founded by Minos, to justify the appear- ance of the androgynous type being assigned to Iasion ; while the Arcadian currency does not offer the form of the supposed importer of the worship of Cybele into the Troad, in the person of Corybas: and here we have an evident confusion of myths, for while the worship of Jupiter, pro- bably the Achaian Zeus, is said to have been brought by the Corybantes or Curetes, to whom his education was 24 Which is hardly probable ; and the numerous hermaphroditic changes at a late epoch justify the supposition of the nuper in Ovid applying to his own times.

Eliac, lib. v.), with Hercules, Paeoneus, Epimedes, and Ida.</page><page sequence="7">NOTES UPON A TYPE OF PH^ESTUS IN CRETE. 75 confided, in the caves of the Cretan Ida, from the Phry- gian Ida it is from the same Crete that the Arcadian and Doric colonists passed at an early period, evidently bearing with them the Telluric and other deities of their worship, and, subsequently, justly vindicating to themselves the tra- ditions of their own race,26 Corybas, for example, the son of an Arcadian, along with Dardanus, imports the worship of Demeter and the Idœan Pallas- Athene into Asia Minor. Phaestus, one of the Heraclidœ, institutes divine honours to Hercules, and founds a Doric state in Crete whose cur- rency in many a beautiful specimen prove the high honours rendered to that hero. The Cretan colonists accompany- ing Teucer in search of a settlement, are instructed by Apollon where to settle, and name the deity Smintheus, while the worship of Demeter, and the dances of the Corybantes are instituted by the same Teucer, who is subsequently named the son of Ida and Scamander. The Cretan Apollo of Cicero is, in his turn, the son of Corybas, born in Crete, and disputes for the possession of the island with Jupiter himself, a tradition under which are probably veiled the struggles of the Doric and Pelasgian religions. The occupiers of the Cretan throne trace, in their turn, their origin to Sol, to Europa (the Phenician line), and to Zeus. This discussion is necessary, in order to show the deity whom I imagine to be represented on the present coin ; for the fact of Ganymedes having been supposed to be found upon two vases 27 holding or riding upon the bird of the Sun would favour the supposition that the figure seated upon the tree might be Ganymedes, borne off by Jupiter, 26 Cf. Paus. iv. p. 278. 1. 30. The incunabula of Jove are also said to have been in Messenia. 27 Cf. De Witte. Descr. des Vases Peints, 1837, p. 27. p. 73. Passeri, Piet. Etr., pl. vi.</page><page sequence="8">76 NUMISMATIC CHRONICLE. in the same manner as Europa appears depicted upon the plane tree, on the contemporaneous currency of Gortyna.28 This explanation, which if admissible, would connect the type with the Phrygian myths, instantly recalls to mind the cock29 seen upon the currency of Dardanus in the Troad: yet even this attribution is embarrassed with considerable difficulties ; for it does not appear that any of these vases offer the name of Ganymedes, and they may possibly merely represent an athletes holding the game cock as the emblem of the palaestra.30 Nine statues of Gany- medes,31 which exist in Europe, never represent him under a similar character, for the personification of the cup-bearer of the gods is the type of male youthful beauty, and there is nothing androgynous about him,32 except the occasional , Phrygian head-dress of the bonnet cidaris, which may have caused him to be allied with the form of Atys. The locks of Ganymedes roll in the rich profusion of youth upon his shoulders, or are lightly restrained by the tainia or tricho- desmos, the phialé and the oinochoe are either in his hands, or the bird of Jove, placed at his side, plays with the Phry- gian boy, or else soars with him through the air. A con- sideration of all these types renders it hardly probable that Ganymedes is represented. There is, however, one deity, with whose form that on the present coins offers an analogy so striking that it can hardly escape instant remark; and that is the androgynous type of 28 Eckhel, Doct.

Here, then, is found the perpetual allusion to the solar type of the Phoibos Apollo, and the explanation of its appear- ance on the shield of Idomeneus, as proposed by Homer; while the intimate connection of this bird with the tradi- tions of the Sun, proves that the reference of its quality of saluting the rising of the day, was the prominent feature of his connection with the traditions of that island. In reality, the evidence of the medals almost uniformly points to the worship rendered to the Helios Apollo, even waving the deduction which might be drawn in favour of this deity on the currency of Dardanus in the Troad, the Campa- nian types of Cales and Teanum 33 present the cock occa- sionally as a reverse to the head of Apollo, and it is fre- quently accompanied by the star of Helios, or the Sun. The currency of Carystus in Eubœa,34 a town remarkable for the adoration it paid Apollo, again presents the cock apparently in reference to the same deity; while the obverses 33 Cf.

Again, the types of Selinus 36 which re- present the river god sacrificing to Apollo, have at the foot of the altar the bird of day, and this is replaced by the serpent emblem of the Hygeic influence of Apollo, since no trace of any adoration to Asclepios, a deity whose Asiatic worship was at all times more extensive than his European appears : and the reverses of the tetradrachms of Selinus represent the children of Latona in the quad- riga,57 the gods who at the earliest epoch presided over the care of health; and passing again to the coins inscribed AITNAI&amp;N 38 we find the head of the Sun (Helios) in the radiated diadem, alluding to the curative powers of the hot springs of Sicily, while on the coins inscribed Oepfiaiwv and allied with Himera is the head of Hercules, in allusion to the demigod39 going to the thermal sources of the Island: a form of the Attic myths of Thermopylae, where Pallas- Athene discovers the waters of that defile to the same demigod,40 since Selinus owed its origin to a colony from Megara.41 In the story of Alectryon, another allusion occurs to the solar myths, as the angry Mars changes his favourite into a cock, a bird which salutes the rising of the morn ; under which allegory is perhaps to be traced the 35 Mionnet, i. p. 239.

With regard, indeed, to the hygeic type of Apollo, the authority of the most archaic poet presents us this god in the character of one whose arrows are winged with pestilence, and who at the same time holds in his power the life and health of men, which, in the hymn 42 to Apollo is still more explicitly stated by the terms and epithets ßtoSwrijc, ¿rítoç, 'pv'oSorfip ; and the same hymn identifies him with the Sun, as o-iyaXoàç, aeXarj- yevvi tïjç, Ttrav; while the passage of Porphyry 43 which men- tions the cock sacred to Demeter is, at least, ambiguous ; since the fact of this bird being dedicated to her, if we admit such construction to the passage, is because Demeter is identified with Pherephatta, or (the terrestrial) Perse- phone, who is, in the opinion of Porphyry, the same as her mother Deo or Demeter, for the crane was the bird pecu- liarly sacred to Demeter44, and appears in the area of the coins of Selinus : while, in the vase of the Canino collec- tion, where Hercules comes to the thermal sources, he is attended by Hermes, Demeter,45 and Koré, who appear in the scene to indicate the production of the thermal sources from the same deities who have conferred upon mankind the blessings of agriculture. To pass, however, from the relation of this bird with the hygeic and solar influence, in which respect it even appears to have been held sacred in the Attic myths, as in 42 Cf. Anthol. Ed.

So striking did the analogy appear to the Persian Datis, that he spared the fane of Delos in order that he might not seem to insult the worship of his country- men. The account of Hesiod makes Helios the son of Thea and Hyperion,57 a legend with which that of Diodorus 58 nearly agrees, who, however, calls the daughter of Tit sea, subsequently named the Magna Mater, the mother of Helios and Selene by the same; and the Theogonia of Hesiod makes Apollo and Artemis the children of Leto by Zeus, so that it appears that the two forms are reduplications of the identical myth, or that by some almost inexplicable confusion, the story of Phaëthon and his sisters, the Heliades, has been substituted into the extra- ordinary legend of Diodorus; for the later mythologists all of them assign the parentage of Phaëthon to Phoebus and one of the Oceanides.59 The Cretan mythology was, 54 Anthol.

The worship of Apollo may, however, have been imported from iEgialea when the twin children of Leto first arrived after the death of the Python ; and this place, under the guidance of one of the Heraclidœ, subsequently sent a colony to Phaestus, and the solicitation for the return of these deities tends to prove that at an early period a religious intercourse was kept up between this place and Crete ; since Apollo and Artemis are repre- sented as being driven from iEgialea to Crete, and taking refuge with Carmanor. We find, indeed, on the tetra- drachms of Phaestus, Hercules seated with the vase behind him which he has obtained from the centaur Pholus, stand- ing before the tree of the Hesperides, or else killing the Lernean hydra, and it is not impossible but in the tree may be traced an allusion to the term 3&lt;k™'oç, a date or finger, which may indicate the mountain character of the Curetes or Corybantes.61 The Apollo may be either the aboriginal deity of the island, the Arcadian Apollo Nomios identified with Aristaeus, the lawgiver or shepherd, or else the Doric deity, the child of Leto and Zeus, introduced by the Hera- clidae into Crete. The results of my researches are, con- sequently, to repudiate the attribution of this figure to Ido- meneus, Iphis, or Leucippe, or Iasion, and to recognise in it the Cretan Helios, or Abellio or Abelios,62 identified with the Doric Apollo. 60 Lib. viii.
