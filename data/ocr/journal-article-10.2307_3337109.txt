Sissela Bok, Secrets: On the Ethics of Concealment and Revelation, 1982 0 6 a: 0-- o veryone knows the powers and values of secrecy, and everyone knows its dangers. Secrecy, with its ability both to conceal and to reveal, is "rooted in the most basic experience of what it is to live as one human being among others, needing both to hide and to share, both to explore and to beware of the unknown" (Bok 1982:281). We master secrecy in early childhood, then grow up to see it in our newspaper headlines daily. It creeps into our personal relation- ships, and into our professional lives-- whether in politics, business, medicine, law, psychotherapy, academia, or art, secrecy is everywhere. In fact it perme- ates the cultures in which we live. In Western societies knowledge is seen as a public good, to be shared as widely as possible. At the same time, however, a premium is placed on personal privacy, and a ban on secrets, if it could be execut- ed, would surely render government and business impossible.2 Furthermore, the entire Western project of understanding other cultures is implicated in the secret. Ethnographic research, anthropological writing, and cultural representation are all lodged in the encounter of self and 1. Mask for the Kifwebe association. Songye, Zaire. Wood, pigments; 30.4cm.

Names such as "the opening of a fur- nace" for the nostrils, "the snout of a crocodile" for the chin, and "the swellings of sorcerers" for the eyes form the core of the secret knowledge acquired in initiation. The names themselves are not secret; they are simply vehicles for a constellation of mean- ings understood only partially by any single person at a given moment (Hersak 1990). other, an encounter determined by each party's management of the dual strategies of secrecy: concealment and revelation. I doubt there is a culture in the world that has not discovered secrecy's secret. In African epistemology and art, secrecy operates in complex, subtle ways, being a key strategy in much secular and ritu- al experience, including traditional forms of education and the arts.3 The lit- erature on Africa has misrepresented secrecy there: early visitors talked of the "dark continent," and described myste- rious, clandestine practices performed in the seclusion of "secret society" hous- es. These sensational accounts reflected obvious Eurocentric biases, as well as their authors' ignorance of the nature and necessity of secrecy, and of its sophisticated role in African life. Such stereotypes were rife during the colonial era, when European missionar- ies and functionaries deliberately project- ed an image of a "primitive" Africa in order to raise funds for campaigns to convert Africans to Christianity, and to support the mandate of foreign control. Many African traditions were sup- pressed in this process, and a number of formerly open associations went under- ground or disguised certain of their prac- tices to deflect the repressive attentions of the colonial regimes. No discussion of knowledge and power in the Africa of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries can neglect these historical exchanges, in which secrecy played a key role. Secrecy, in fact, must sometimes be credited with the very survival of esoteric forms of phi- losophy and religion. Westerners and Africans see secrets differently. To the Western mind, the word "secrecy" tends to summon up sin- "Secrecy: African Art That Conceals and Reveals" will inaugurate the Museum for African Art on February 13 in newly renovated space at 593 Broadway in the SoHo district of New York City. (The Museum was formerly the Center for African Art, on East 68th Street.) Organized and curated by Senior Curator Mary H. Nooter, the exhibition will present approximately 100 objects drawn from public and private collections in Europe and the United States. Coinciding with the opening, a symposium will be held on the weekend of February 13-14. After closing at the Museum on August 15, 1993, the exhibition begins a tour that includes the Bermuda National Gallery, Hamilton (October-December 1993); the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts, Richmond (February-April 1994); the Walters Art Gallery, Baltimore (May-September 1994); and the Des Moines Art Center, Des Moines (January-March 1995). The following article incorporates portions of the preface, introduction, and conclusion from the volume that accompanies the exhibition. The book, by Nooter, includes illustrations of all the works in the exhibition and an array of field photographs, in addition to ten essays by scholars' and a foreword by Kwame Anthony Appiah, Professor of African-American Studies at Harvard University.

In Africa, on the other hand, secrecy is viewed less as sinister than as a necessary part of social reality (Fernandez in Bellman 1984:ix), and as a coherent part of the methodologies of cer- tain systems of knowledge. Nii Otokunor Quarcoopome notes in Secrecy: African Art That Conceals and Reveals, "There are as many shades of secrecy as there are variations of power." Other authors in the book document the same point. Although secrecy is universal, then, it is not constant. It is socially and cultural- ly constructed, and must be considered within the societal frameworks in which it operates, as Allen F. Roberts, 'Wande Abimbola, and Barry Hallen write in Secrecy. Conventional Western approach- es to knowledge and art may not accom- modate other cultures' expressions of secrecy-which leads to the purpose and challenge of this book and exhibition. Writing, Exhibiting, and Researching Secrecy By its nature, the enterprise of writing contradicts the processes of concealment implicit in secrecy. "Writing," Georg Simmel remarks, "is opposed to all secre- cy....Writing possesses an objective exis- tence which renounces all guarantees of remaining secret" (1950:352). Similarly, Western methods of ethnographic re- search and museum exhibition-with 2. Mask for the Kifwebe association. Songye, Zaire. Wood, pigment; 49.8cm. Collection of J.W. Mestach. The signs that can be read in Songye Kifwebe masks allude to a cosmology that describes the planets, certain animals, and mythical cul- ture heroes. The allusive meanings of these signs are understood only progressively by initiates in the context of larger metaphors. The possession of this secret knowledge sets the boundary between group members and outsiders (Hersak 1990). their emphases on scrutiny, analysis, meticulous observation, and the dissemi- nation of information-inherently run counter to the indirect, allusive, and metaphoric means by which knowledge is often both restricted and transmitted in Africa, and to the reserved and con- trolled ways in which African art is de- ployed and displayed in its original contexts (Murphy 1992). Most art history focuses on visible, perceptible art. Yet some African art forms are intended to be viewed only in brief, often seasonal interludes, or not at all (Gottlieb forthcoming, Drewal 1977). The aesthetic effect of a work of art in Africa may depend on the deliberate ob- struction, obscuring, or withholding of its presence. Wyatt MacGaffey remarks, "Modern art theory assumes that the gallery or museum-goer can or should be able to see, and so 'grasp,' the work, which is taken to be, as it were, open. The essence of African art may be that in 'see- ing' you do not see. Not surprisingly, some of the most respected objects are rarely seen by anybody."4 Furthermore, not only is the aesthetic encounter often multisensory, but it is centered on senses other than seeing. These issues present challenges to curator and ethnographer alike: as Fredrik Barth says of a New Guinea culture he has studied, the mo- ment he writes about secrecy he has already betrayed the subtle, nonlinguis- tic sensory modes through which secrets are communicated there (1975:224). The goal of most art history of non- Western art is to penetrate other cultures' systems of social organization, ritual, symbolism, belief, and ideology in order to understand their art. Sometimes, how- ever, that pursuit may involve domains of knowledge that are off-limits to all but a few, domains not only restricted but dangerous. Sissela Bok writes of secrecy: From earliest childhood we feel its mystery and attraction. We know both the power it confers and the burden it imposes. We learn how it can delight, give breathing-space, and protect. But we come to under- stand its dangers, too: how it is used to oppress and exclude; what can befall those who come too close to secrets they were not meant to share; and the price of betrayal. (Bok 1982:xv) 56 african arts</page><page sequence="4">Secrecy is a subject of great allure, but also of moral weight. The researcher confronts difficult questions of privacy, ownership, and accountability. Ven- turing into the field clothed in all of what Gary van Wyk, in his essay in Secrecy, calls the "epistemological armor of the West," one is already poised on a precarious tightrope of cultural respon- sibility. Seldom are researchers pre- pared for the ethical dilemmas they will face; seldom are they trained to negoti- ate the burdens they will bear as they acquire knowledge, or find themselves excluded from it. They only know that they must emerge from the field know- ing more than they did when they went in. The tools they bring with them, from pens and papers to cameras, flashes, binoculars, tape recorders, and video equipment, are themselves designed to recover, even extract, bodies of knowl- edge otherwise hidden or dormant (Clifford 1988:83-84). Most of the time, of course, knowl- edge is not as retrievable as one would like it to be. Art historian Frederick Lamp summarizes the comments of one Baga elder regarding the researcher's inquiry into the esoteric and guarded aspects of Baga masking traditions: We just don't do it that way. We just don't sit down one day and decide to tell the secrets. Learning happens in stages; it is gained little by little over the course of a per- son's life. Much knowledge is com- municated without words. One is lucky if by the end of a lifetime one has grasped even just a few bits and pieces of all there is to know.5 During my fieldwork among the Luba in Zaire, I underwent initiation into an association, where secrets were revealed in terms so proverbial and enigmatic that I realized it would be virtually impossi- ble for me to "tell" them, even if I wanted to. Was this because my initiators were deliberately obscuring the meanings of the secrets in order to prevent my full understanding, or was it because such knowledge is polysemous and multiva- lent by nature? The articulation of secrets, where a single concrete symbol can serve as a vehicle for several distinct metaphors (Barth 1975:263, Turner 1967), is entirely dependent upon their context and upon the interlocutors of their trans- mission. Meaning is elusive, in part because secret knowledge is organic, always in the process of change, and also because its interpretation will vary according to each initiate's unique degree of indoctrination and understanding. In the words of one of the most famous Bamana blacksmiths, "Knowledge is something that you have and no one else has" (McNaughton 1982a:501). No mat- ter what level of initiation you may have achieved, in other words, your particu- lar understanding of that knowledge will differ from another's.6 I came to understand that the power of the initiation secrets among the Luba lay not in their surrender, nor in the dis- closure of some "within," but in the strategies of their concealment, and in the tensions and boundaries they created both among Luba people themselves and between Luba people and me. This is not to say that secrets were nonexistent there, but their substance was perhaps less important than social delineations result- ing from their acquisition, ownership, PHOTO: COURTESY OF LENDER 3.

Encoding the secrets of Ndengese chiefly authority, the spiral alludes to the saying "All that comes from the chief returns to the chief." Chiefly protection is invoked in the lozenge patterns on the arms, meaning "He who will liberate the multitudes"; and chiefly solidari- ty is cited in the cone on the headdress, which refers to the saying "Your secret, do not tell it to your spouse" (Faik-Nzuji 1992). january 1993 57</page><page sequence="5">and controlled revelation. As previous studies have shown, any piece of infor- mation has the potential to be a secret; it is a question of how that information is constituted (Guidieri and Pellizzi 1981:22), and of "the way concealed information is withheld, restricted, intentionally altered and exposed" (Bellman 1984:144). Secrecy and the Visual Arts of Africa Secrecy explores how art both structures and selectively disseminates secret knowledge in Africa (Figs. 1, 2). This book and the exhibition it accompanies make two main points: first, art is inti- mately related to knowledge in Africa, being fundamental to processes of teaching and revelation that confer sta- tus and disclose information, meanings, and symbols; and second, secrets are often central to the making, ownership, use, and interpretation of art. The essays in the book-by thirteen Africanist scholars of diverse intellectual orienta- tions--explore relationships among art, secrecy, knowledge, and power in African societies.7 They may also pro- voke consideration of how secrecy influ- ences our own lives. Studies of secrecy in Africa suggest that the content of a secret is less impor- tant than the use of secrecy as a strategy. According to William Murphy, "The con- tent of the secret is often insignificant compared to the rights, obligations and privileges generated by the fact of secre- cy" (1980:127). There is a paradox here: although the content of a secret may be guarded and concealed, the secret's exis- tence is often flaunted. To own secret knowledge, and to show that one does, is a form of power. One function of art in Africa, then, is to act as a visual means of broadcasting secrecy--of publicly pro- claiming the ownership of privileged information while protecting its contents. As Philip Ravenhill states, "The visible functions to keep the invisible invisible."8 Secrecy confronts the tensions of this paradox. Examples from different soci- eties across most of the continent pre- sent secrecy in art as an aesthetic means of ordering knowledge, regulating power, and demarcating differences between genders, classes, titles, and pro- fessions. Secrecy is a channel of commu- nication and commentary, a social and political boundary marker, and a medi- um of property and power. Through cross-cultural analysis within Africa, the book documents the complex, nuanced role of art as both shield and advertise- ment for the presence of secrets in a range of African contexts, including ini- tiation, the royal courts, systems of div- ination and healing, the tourist trade, and arenas of contemporary political resistance. The purpose is not to tell secrets but to explore secrecy as a strate- gy, and as an important dimension of African knowledge, power, and aesthet- ic experience. What is secret in Africa is often either completely invisible (a family genealogy, for example, or the breath of a departed ancestor) or ordinary-looking: grains, medicines, bones, and so on, may all be secret. Works of art and architecture may invoke secrecy in one of three ways: by attracting attention to secret realms; by distracting viewers away from restricted places such as shrines, for example through public masquerades; or by con- taining or enclosing secret things. The emphasis of Secrecy is on objects that have visible, public dimensions and invisible or secret ones as well, such as the unworked insides of Yoruba beaded crowns, which have been treated with medicines and are considered more pow- erful, more forbidden, than the elaborate exteriors. Works like these play a crucial role in expressing secret knowledge, but are not secret themselves. Rather, they serve as an agency through which com- plex relationships of secrecy and disclo- sure are negotiated and mediated. The book thus addresses the various means by which art demarcates the realms of secrecy that regulate access to knowledge. It investigates the social and cultural construction of secrecy, and examines how Africans of various soci- eties constitute, recognize, and commu- nicate realms of knowledge through art.9 Just as proverbs and other verbal art forms make use of metaphor and allu- sion in their communication of things secret, visual arts relating to secret knowledge are often characterized by a play of concealment and revelation. Thus the second part of the book's title. The first part of the title invokes secrecy by name, since the concept of the secret is articulated in many African languages. Although African habits of secrecy have often been misunderstood in the West, they are not a Western invention, and they are not a myth. Often the etymologies of African words for secrecy convey something of the concept's culturally specific nature. In KiLuba, for example, the word for secre- cy also means "prohibitions," while in other languages it is linked to "lies." For members of the Poro association of West Africa, secrecy is "that which cannot be discussed"lo; in Mande languages, do or dwo refers to a secret association, but also simply to "the secret." And in many Bantu cultures the vocabulary of secrecy also relates to the concept of obscurity, with connotations of introspection, insight, and creative potential (as Roberts writes in Secrecy). In each of the areas presented in the exhibition, art elucidates these linguistic concepts.

This figure combines accumulation and con- tainment as it encases medicinal substances on its chest, back, and in the top of its head. X-rays reveal that each of the cloth bundles suspended from the shoulders contains hol- low reeds wrapped in layers of fabric. Con- cealed inside the reeds are numerous small medicinal crystals (Kecsk6si 1987). ordered according to four principal themes: how art embodies secret knowl- edge through specific aesthetic devices; who has the right to own secret knowl- edge and its emblems of power; how art transmits secret knowledge through such processes as initiation, and how, in so doing, it marks physical and social boundaries (between, say, children and adults, men and women, royalty and public); and how the presence of secret knowledge influences outsiders' under- standing of African art. The book focuses mainly on sub- Saharan African cultures of the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Individual works of art and the prac- tices surrounding their use are dated historically whenever possible. Though the authors recognize the importance in today's Africa of a contemporary culture with political power resting in the nation, and of university-based systems of knowledge, the modern, largely urban culture of Africa is not the main focus here. Secrecy's Visual Language Recent art-historical studies have dis- cussed how African works of art phrase secret knowledge according to a visual grammar (Adams 1989, Brett-Smith 1984). Abstraction, accumulation, obscu- rity, omission, and containment are some of the principles of secrecy's visual language in many African cultures (Figs. 3-6). In the art of the Akan, the Bamana, and other cultures, for example, there is often a dialectic between what is seen and what is unseen: the more secret something is, the more enigmatic and nonrepresentational its form. Sarah Catherine Brett-Smith has discussed the deliberate uses of irregularity and incon- sistency in Bamana textile patterning as an unofficial discourse formulated and shared by select women only (1984), and Monni Adams, exploring the variations and the "silent beat" in African geomet- ric designs, has discovered that behind them sometimes lies the codification of secret information or the invocation of invisible presences (1989:38-40). Similarly, the visual language of many initiation rituals becomes increasingly abstract and metaphoric in the advanced stages. Initiation masks from the various Bamana associations of Mali demonstrate that the more secret the association, and the "deeper" its knowledge, the more ambiguous and the less "beautiful" its emblems, in materials, iconography, and form. Projections, accretions, contain- ments, and accumulations characterize the most secret komo masks. As one Bamana man explained, "The komo mask is made to look like an animal. But it is not an animal, it is a secret" (McNaugh- ton 1979:n.p.). One's degree of compre- hension depends upon how far one has progressed through the initiation cycle. In Part I of the book, "The Visual Lan- guage of Secrecy," a selection of two- and three-dimensional objects-including masks, textiles, tablets, and figural sculpture-illustrates these aesthetic strategies at work. Some African art- works are characterized by more than one such strategy, demonstrating that their artistic devices are neither rigid nor mutually exclusive. Furthermore, they all share one overriding feature: ambiguity. Through an aesthetic of par- january 1993 59</page><page sequence="7">tial revelation and partial concealment, devices of coding, obscurity, accumula- tion, and containment all produce am- biguity of form and of meaning. The ambiguity serves to disclose secrets, or the simulacrum of secrets, to some, while at the same time withholding them from others (Fig. 7). The essays following "The Visual Language of Secrecy" examine two of these devices, obscurity and coding, within specific cognitive frameworks and sociocultural contexts. Roberts demonstrates that the word for secrecy in six central Bantu-speaking groups derives from a root that means "black." He traces the concept of obscurity, or "black secrecy," through language, myth, ritual, magic, and other forms of expressive culture among Tabwa and other Luba-related peoples of southeast- PHOTO JOHN TSANTES 7.

The discussion presents secre- cy as a paradoxical, ambivalent category embodying both vision and insight, danger and creative potentiality, and shows how knowledge and cosmology accommodate change and transforma- tion through the contradictory logic of obscure, black secrecy." A second essay, by van Wyk, analyzes the mural art of southern African women who use abstraction as a medium of secret political resistance to apartheid. The messages covertly contained in the geometric patterns that Ndebele and Southern Sotho women incise into the earthen facades of their homes are onto- logically linked with the landscape, and with the labors of their own bodies. Like other contemporary African art, these mural designs encode both Western sig- nification systems and arcane beliefs per- taining to the occupation, habitation, and use of the land and space. They express strong political positions, including sup- I PHOTO COURTESY OF LENDER 9. Two-headed dog. Vili, Zaire. Wood, resin- ous mass, metal; h. 34.9cm. Staatliches Museum fOr V81kerkunde, Munich.

Ownership Studies have shown that secret knowl- edge-whether historical, medicinal, moral, or other-may constitute property and power (d'Azevedo 1962, Murphy 1980). The purchase, acquisition, owner- ship, and maintenance of secrets and their emblems are both markers of status and avenues to authority. Ownership may be controlled by a whole association, its members sharing a secret meeting house, a secret dialect, and a collection of objects used to initiate new members (Fig. 8). Other forms of secret knowledge may be owned collectively by a whole village, for example (Figs. 9, 10), or individually, to be used in healing, hunting, divination, and other practices of personal and apotropaic efficacy (Fig. 11). In the book's second section, "Secret Knowledge as Ownership and Power," two essays address the ownership of secret knowledge in the context of politi- cal authority. Both Michelle Gilbert and Nii Quarcoopome explore the predomi- nant emblems of Akan royalty-the chiefly stool in particular-as embodi- ments of political and worldly secrets. They also investigate the different aes- thetics surrounding the ownership of regalia in two distinct locales of Ghana ^VOW JOIN.~ PHOTO JERRY L . THOMPSON january 1993 61</page><page sequence="9">where Akan kingship is superimposed on preexisting, local systems of leadership. Discussing the Akuapem kingdom of southern Ghana, Gilbert presents the essential dialectic in that region be- tween gold-covered (public) insignia and blackened (private) insignia, and the concealed and revealed dualities of the king. She demonstrates the way regalia constitute concrete representa- tions of the king's sacred person, public manifestations of the secret power that lies within and behind the kingship. Quarcoopome analyzes the qualities characterizing possession of Dangme political secrets, and the way remnants of an earlier political theocracy that equates secrecy with power have shaped the aesthetics of ownership. Whereas ownership of secret authority is ex- pressed in Akuapem through a dialectic of flamboyant display and clandestine worship, the emphasis in Dangme chieftaincies is on invisibility and con- cealment. Quarcoopome summarizes the aesthetics surrounding Dangme ownership of secret knowledge: "Power is not how it is expressed, but rather how it is concealed."12 Transmission and Boundaries In Africa, the arts relating to secret knowledge are often part of a society's educational process, and convey mean- ings in initiation ceremonies (Fig. 12). The progressive nature of the learning process is often implied in the art forms themselves: the sequencing and assem- bling of works of art, or the explanation of visual arts through words and sounds, may reflect the step-by-step initiatory process. Initiation through the grades of the Lega bwami association in eastern Zaire, for example, involves the use of complex configurations of objects, their careful manipulation and explanation through proverbs ensuring the proper sequences, displays, and interpretations of the rites (Biebuyck 1973:93). Knowledge, then, is often conveyed through a performative aesthetic, or through extended processes such as apprenticeship. Among southern Kuba peoples, boys may attend an initiation camp in the bush, where their education includes training in secret verbal and performing arts and in the fabrication of costumes and masks from wilderness materials: "The making and dancing of masks is integral to the secret knowl- edge passed from elder to junior during the rite" (Binkley 1990:160). The sanctions against disclosing secrets, and the severe taboos associated with membership in secret associations, contribute to the conservation of tradi- tion and to the transmission of knowl- edge and ritual practice from one generation to the next. The knowledge imparted to members of secret groups is often sealed by the taking of vows, a characteristic part of the initiation pro- cess. Oaths of secrecy may also be sworn in the presence of artworks or may be commemorated by them. Sometimes an artwork may depict the punishment for violating secrecy. In the form of doors, house posts, veils, screens, and thresholds, some art- works serve as literal boundary markers to keep the uninitiated out (Fig. 13). Often the purpose of the boundary is simply to enhance the aura of whatever is on the other side: as Jan Vansina writes, in a well-known article about Kuba men's initiations, "The secret of their initiation was that they had none" (1973:304). Kuba initiation practices and emblems, Vansina shows, were a means of aggrandizing and mystifying male power through the possession of "se- crets" forbidden to women. Three essays are included in the book's third section, which is entitled "The Physical and Social Boundaries of Secrecy." These essays address the role of art in the establishment of boundaries, both concrete and conceptual, between different social groupings. They explore boundaries of the most literal sort- architectural structures, for example-as well as the ideological principles these boundaries enforce. They also investi- gate the metaphoric boundaries created between, for example, men and women, adults and children, through the identity transformations produced during initia- tion processes. Z. S. Strother documents the con- struction of Eastern Pende chiefs' hous- es in Zaire as a process that establishes both physical and conceptual bound- aries between the rulers and the ruled (Fig. 14). Architecturally, the house defines the parameters of access to potent forms of secret knowledge asso- ciated with chiefship. It also reifies the chief's role as the society's highest-rank- ing initiate, and as the mediator be- tween the secrets of the living and those of the dead. Concepts of boundary, and of form over content, are further reinforced in Suzanne Blier's essay, which traces the linguistic roots of secrecy in the Fon dialects of Benin to images of fences, hedges, and screens, as well as to no- tions of opening something up through plucking, peeling, and cutting out. Blier examines arts of secrecy both personal and psychological, both corporate and political, to show the ways secrecy is manifested through ideas of disclosure and revelation at least as much as through concealment. Her analysis of personal arts, communal shrines, and royal emblems emphasizes that the most important secrets, paradoxically, are those open to public view. Finally, Cesare Poppi-an initiate of the "secret" association about which he writes-examines the way secrecy is constituted in Vagla initiations in north- western Ghana. The strategies of com- munication in these ceremonies, he concludes, are more important than any hard content. Secrets are created through initiation, where multisensory signals are used to erect boundaries between the initiated and the noninitiat- ed, and also between novices of differ- ent levels. Poppi extends the metaphor of boundaries to boxes and frames, and determines that initiation involves not the acquisition of new information but the ability to "see" information in a new way. An initiate proceeds through a hierarchy of the senses, progressing from listening to hearing, from looking to seeing-and finally, in Poppi's case, to writing. The anthropological enter- prise of "writing secrecy" is the final focus of this essay. Coda: Secrecy and the Other The essays collected in the book also reflect on how secrecy affects outside researchers' understanding of art in African societies. Using the well-docu- mented example of the Dogon of Mali, the last part of the book contrasts the work of Marcel Griaule, who published on the Dogon from the early 1930s until his death in 1956, with the work of later scholars (Clifford 1988, van Beek 1991). Griaule's reconstruction of Dogon cos- mology, and its relationship to art, has not generally been verified by later research. As in the recent reassessment of Margaret Mead's work, and many other studies in a similar vein, the final section of this book and exhibition questions how we know what we know about other societies. In this case, the specific focus is on the role of secret knowledge in influencing outsiders' differing inter- pretations of Dogon art (Fig. 15). As the Dogon example demonstrates, cultural representation is never an objective pre- sentation of facts, but is filtered once through the perspectives of the members of the African society studied, again through the eyes of fieldworkers, and finally through the medium of publica- tions and museum exhibitions. Contributors to this final section fur- ther explore the role of secrecy in Western understandings of other cul- tures and their art. The first essay, by 'Wande Abimbola and Barry Hallen, defends Ifd divination, practiced among the Yoruba people of Nigeria, as an objective system of explanation, predic- tion, and control. Proponents of the Western scientific method question the viability of divination and other forms of exclusive, esoteric, and secret knowl- edge. Yet Abimbola, himself an Ifd priest (babalawo, father of the secrets), and Hallen, a philosopher, present Ifd as a coherent system of knowledge, within 62 african arts</page><page sequence="10">11.

The last essay, by Rachel Hoffman, returns to the Dogon, this time to show how secrecy functions as a powerful tool in the secular contexts of contempo- rary Dogon art and artists. Hoffman seeks to dispel the myths about Dogon sculpture that were embraced by earlier scholars. She shows that secrecy is not restricted to arcane knowledge and ritu- als, but operates as well within the 13. Osugbo association door. Yoruba, Nigeria, workshop in the Ijebu area. Wood, 129.8cm.

Secrecy's Significance Although secrecy has been addressed in a number of sociological, anthropologi- cal, and psychosocial studies-from George Simmel's classic study of secret associations (1950), first published in 1908, to such recent publications as those of Murphy (1980), Stanton K. Tefft (1980), Bok (1982), Beryl Bellman (1984), Corinne Kratz (1990), and Alma Gottlieb (forthcoming)13-it has never to my knowledge been the focus of an art exhi- bition or an art-history book.

THOMPSON Africanist working on art. Merging the art-historical data of local studies throughout Africa with broader theoreti- cal observations concerning boundaries, property, language, and power, Secrecy: African Art That Conceals and Reveals seeks to discover new relationships among knowledge, authority, and artis- tic creativity in Africa. Considering sacred and secular African art in the context of secret knowledge provides a more nuanced understanding of both function and form. Not only will an outsider's view of art differ from an insider's, but inter- pretations of art by members of a given society will vary according to age, gen- der, status, and many other factors. The arts of African leadership, for example, have generally been analyzed as dis- play-visible and extravagant signs of wealth, privilege, and grandeur that magnify the ruler and his realm. In this study, however, it emerges that what is hidden, however visually insignificant, may be far more essential and powerful than what is displayed. Examination of artworks demonstrates that the internal and unseen are usually crucial: power- ful, sacred things are often invisible, or visually insignificant. Secrecy explicitly examines the rela- tionship between African art and epis- temology. Exploring the way many 14. Mother-and-child rooftop figure for chief's house. Eastern Pende (Kasai province), Zaire. Wood, pigment, 81.3 cm. Private collection. The mother-and-child rooftop sculpture is a mid-twentieth-century innovation in a dynamically changing tradition of Eastern Pende royal architectural sculpture first doc- umented by Westerners in 1905. The figure's purpose was to announce the presence of secret powers within the chief's residence, while at the same time deterring any would- be malefactors from the sacred space. The perimeter of the house marks the boundary between royalty and populace, and also cre- ates a foyer to the other world. African societies sanctify knowledge and regulate access to it through secre- cy, exhibition and book together present knowledge and art as linked in process, as if art were knowledge in action. Above all, they show art's use in the construction of meaning, and its role in the progressive attainment of under- standing over time. Speaking of some- one who has passed through all the stages of the initiation process, the Fang say, "A man now sees hidden things" (Fernandez 1982:259). And as the Mende view it, initiation is "a condition of see- ing" (Boone 1986:xi). Secrecy, Personhood, and the Everyday The arts associated with secrecy are often focal points of ritual and ceremo- ny, cosmology, mythology, and mystical belief, yet the aesthetics of secrecy oper- ate at every level of human discourse and interaction, as a number of studies have recently emphasized (Gottlieb forthcoming, Kratz 1990, Piot 1989). In the introductory essay to Secrecy, T. O. Beidelman argues that secrecy is central to all human affairs, and that the para- doxes and ambiguities of concealment and revelation infuse most every form of human behavior-from the ways we dress to the ways we speak, from formal modes of etiquette to the most routine daily encounters. Secrecy begins with the individual. The same strategies by which ordinary folk define themselves as social beings also dictate the forms of works of art, anrd the lives of people quite out of the ordinary-rulers, for example, who embody entire systems of cosmology, authority, and belief. As Beidelman points out, concepts of per- sonhood in the West and in Africa are closely linked to concepts of masking: something is always concealed, some- thing revealed. And it is this most fun- Opposite: 15. Equestrian figure. Dogon, Mall. Wood, 91.4cm. Private collection.

THOMPSON damental of paradoxes-as well as the knowledge of its necessity-that makes human society possible. The Impact of the Unseen What is unseen, yet intellectually and emotionally acknowledged by spectators, must be considered part of the work of art. Henry Drewal, "Art and the Perception of Women in Yoruba Culture," 1977 Secrecy: African Art That Conceals and Reveals presents varying shades of secre- cy, from partial revelation to total con- cealment, in arts associated with knowledge and power. The aesthetics of secrecy operate both in ritual and in secular prac- tice. As William Murphy notes, the Mende people of West Africa apply the same aesthetic appreciation to politics as they do to art (1992); certain works of art are governed by aesthetic principles that make them effective expressions of secre- 16.

Initiation can be a lifelong process; this figure was carried in the funeral processions of important elders to initiate the deceased into the society of ancestors. The figure was meant to be viewed in motion, and was swung slowly back and forth to the accompaniment of rhythmic drums and horns (Glaze 1988). cy, but these emblems are microcosms of political strategies on a larger social scale. "Secrecy," Allen Roberts writes, "is the essence of politics, for it implies a hierarchy of privilege and dependency; some people know something, others do not." Secrecy maximizes the power of knowledge by regulating its flow and by restricting access to it (Lowry 1972). Through the dual strategies of conceal- ment and revelation, secrecy renders knowledge a commodity (of value), a currency (of negotiation), and a source of social and political authority and control. Works of art enable this transformation. "The Aesthetic of Looking Is Not to Look Too Closely"14 A Luba royal basket containing ances- tral relics can harm an unauthorized onlooker. The interior of a Yoruba bead- ed crown forbids the gaze of its owner on pain of blindness. An Akan throne is carried shrouded in cloth in a public procession. A Fang head deflects the approach of trespassers, and averts their gaze from the sanctuary where it pro- tects the relics of ancestors. Many noc- turnal masks in Africa never reveal themselves to the human eye, and are represented only by sound. All of these objects warn bystanders that there is danger in looking too close- ly. In many African societies, close scrutiny is associated with sorcery, witchcraft, and other potentially divi- sive acts (Murphy 1992, Speed 1992). Certain art forms, then, are meant to be perceived only partially: dancers are concealed by masks and costumes, speech is cloaked in proverb and metaphor, drum beats conceal tonal messages, sculpted human figures are camouflaged by screens and veils, and shrines may be approached only by crossing many barriers, signposts, and thresholds. Other arts, including figura- tive sculptures of the Fang, Lega, and Senufo, are seen in motion, used in per- formative contexts such as dances and processions, which preclude extended contemplation (Fig. 16). Murphy discusses the irony of the way most African art is presented in museums-on lighted pedestals, with explanatory labels encouraging viewers to scrutinize and analyze. In their origi- nal contexts, most African artworks are not meant to be perceived this way. In some mask performances, for example, direct observation is forbidden to the uninitiated. Even when allowed, look- ing at the masks may be less meaningful and powerfully evocative than other, more indirect forms of apprehension: the distant melodies of flutes, the aroma of certain foods, the deceptive light of dusk, the cooing of particular birds- these are the mostly invisible signs that masks are present. (In his essay in Secrecy, Poppi discusses this hierarchy of the senses.) These signs also tell the uninitiated to stay away from the ritual precinct. Multisensory, they draw one in and keep one out at the same time, alert and avert simultaneously. Some masquerades are intended for public view in only a circumscribed way. Henry Drewal describes how Yoruba spectators extinguish fires and other lights the moment the Great Mother mask Iyanla emerges; this nocturnal mask performs in darkness, surrounded by a moving wall of attendants. The guardianship of the mask in conceal- ment, in a shrine or other sacred space, is as important to the mask's effectiveness as the performance itself: Concealment is the dominant theme of Iyanla in performance, shrine context, and iconography. The striking feature of Iyanla's per- formance during the Efe is that its impact is based upon what is unseen rather than what is seen. In shrine context, the wrapped, veiled or guarded image of Iyanla sus- tains an aura of mystery. Through the invested interest of the commu- nity, each member having con- tributed to the purchase of her cloth, Iyanla remains accessible although visually restricted. (Drewal 1977:564) What has the greatest impact upon all present is the invisible-the obstructed view and concealed medicine-that gives the mask a special aura of power. Iyanla's awesome power resides in its un- knowableness. Like women, as perceived by men in Yoruba cul- ture, Iyanla is secretive. (Drewal 1977:560) An aesthetic of restricted access and partial perception is integral to the effect of many works of art in Africa, and reflects the inevitably partial nature of knowledge more generally. "Keep What You Know Not in Your Head but in Your Kneecap"Is Sometimes, and more often than out- siders may ever know, artworks in Africa are withheld from public view entirely. This is especially common with the arts of royalty. Often, the im- 66 african arts</page><page sequence="14">portant contents of a royal treasury are completely hidden, and only a select corps of officials has access to them. Quarcoopome, for example, describes in his essay the obscurity that sur- rounds a Dangme chief's stool: The stool must stay hidden in total darkness. It must never see the sun. Once a year it is ritually bathed, at around midnight, but it returns to its special room be- fore dawn. It is concealment, the Dangme believe, that makes a stool efficacious. Usually, however, the aesthetic of concealment is counterbalanced by one of revelation. The shrouding of some arts and altars is accompanied by the display of others. These are the public and private faces of secrecy-a dualism that informs virtually every case pre- sented in this book, including the royal art of Cameroon, of the Akan, and of the Luba. Concealment and revelation charac- terize the use of regalia in many African kingdoms. They also govern the aesthet- ics of court practice more generally, as Beidelman writes in his introductory essay. Secrecy, silence, and concealment infuse all aspects of Luba court eti- quette, for example-ritual behavior, royal ceremony, titleship, political com- mentary. Kings eat and drink in isola- tion; they demonstrate authority by remaining silent when addressed; the king's mother is called M'Fyama, or "the hidden one"; and much of the king's regalia-including the royal throne and bow stand-are never pub- licly shown, or are shown to the popu- lace only on the occasion of the king's investiture, before being secreted in a sacred shrine house (Nooter 1991). These customs remind onlookers not only of the dangers of looking too close- ly, but of the dangers of looking-and knowing-at all. A single kingship often maintains two treasuries-one public, the other private. Gilbert describes the dialectic underlying, on the one hand, the tri- umphant public display of gold-covered regalia by royals of Akuapem, and on the other the even more potent black- ened regalia, guarded in an obscure shrine room to which only select digni- taries have access. Similarly, the Kuba court kept relatively well-known public regalia and also a hidden treasury, guarded in the hands of a "ritual king."16 Concealment and revelation define the dialectic of Bangwa night-society perfor- mances, staged after dark, and the more overt, public displays of kingly regalia. And the nocturnal performances of the Yoruba Iyanla mask, which depicts the secret, potentially dangerous powers of women, are counterbalanced by the diurnal Gelede performances (Fig. 17), in which the identity of the dancer is open- ly visible (Drewal 1977). The aesthetics of concealment in art and culture mirror Fredrik Barth's observation that the value of informa- tion is inversely proportional to how many share it (1975:217). From this it would follow that "if you seek to create highly valued information, i.e. basic sacred truths, you must arrange wor- ship so that few persons gain access to these truths." The Visual Inconspicuousness of Secrets In chapter after chapter of Secrecy, we learn of the visual insignificance of secrets. The artworks used to announce a secret are often ornate, while the objects constituting the secret may be ordinary looking. Z. S. Strother, for example, dis- cusses the most secret part of the entire Pende chief's house: not the masks hid- den within, or the medicines kept in the innermost chamber, but a few seeds buried under the house's central post. The ordinariness of the secret ap- pears in almost every artwork discussed or illustrated in Secrecy. The most pow- erful of all the stools of the Dangme chiefs are not the gold-covered Akan- style stools but the plain stone ones. And what makes the latter powerful is not an imposing stone shrine but rather some herbs, buried and invisible in the 17. Gelede mask. Yoruba, Nigeria. Wood, 26.7cm. Private collection. Men perform Gelede masquerades to dra- matize their perceptions of the female, to make visible the invisible natures of men and women, and to express something of the Inner power and knowledge possessed by women, which is covert, composed, secret, and mysterious (Drewal &amp; Drewal 1983:151).

The Western eye may be drawn to the sculpted female kabwelulu figures of the Luba, yet what originally contained the secret in these works was the ordi- nary calabash to which the figure was attached-before it was removed, per- haps by Western collectors who thought the calabash diminished the sculpture's beauty, perhaps by the original owners, who knew what was essential to keep when they relinquished the object to for- eigners. Finally, Luba regalia are often embellished with sculpted human fig- ures, but it is their simple carved geo- metric patterns that are the sign and the secret of royal authority. The visual insignificance of secret things raises questions as to the impor- tance of the container's outward form, a subject David Freedberg addresses in relation to medieval relics (1989:97-98) (Fig. 18). Sometimes the external form of a work of art would seem insignificant, as Quarcoopome found with regard to secret stools among the Dangme: A state stool can take any form. It may be a carved wooden object, a human skull, or even a piece of rock. It does not have to...con- form to any set shape to perform its functions... .The stool's physi- cal form is only essential as a focus of ritual; it provides visual metaphors for the stool's nonvisi- ble qualities. Elsewhere, however, the outward form is considered responsible for the work's efficacy. This is true in the case of both Luba and Fang art, where sculp- tures must exhibit specific aesthetic cri- teria if they are to activate the potent spiritual energies invested in them (Fernandez 1982, Nooter 1991). The Open Secret Another paradox of art associated with secrecy is the fact that the secret is fre- quently right on the surface for all to see. Transparent, like glass it is visible yet impenetrable. Poppi discusses the secret practices that sometimes occur, in the clear light of day, around the time of a Sigma-society masquerade among the Vagla. As association members explained to Poppi, concealment of these activities is only necessary if the community rec- ognizes them as secret. A secret, in other words, is only secret when identified as such. Van Wyk shows how Sotho- Tswana women paint their houses to declare resistance in visible yet transpar- ent ways for the most part imperceptible to outsiders. And Blier demonstrates how shrine structures announce them- selves overtly, and how bocio figures expose the psyche, even turn it inside out: suffering, guilt, anxiety, paranoia, are all laid bare on the figure's surface, communicating the most inner, secretive, dangerous facets of human being and becoming (Fig. 19). The visual availability of certain secrets shows how secrets can be public knowledge, though unspoken. As Strother notes, for example, everyone knows what the most important part of the Eastern Pende royal house is, and the entire community knows when its most secret rites-the planting of the sacred seeds-will occur, but there is a tacit agreement not to discuss it openly. What makes the shared secret a secret, then, is the sharers' collusion in keeping it a secret: "Any item of information is a candidate for being a secret; it is the way in which the information is concealed and discreetly communicated that marks it as such. Thus secrecy is best understood according to the methods used to withhold and convey knowl- edge" (Bellman 1984:50). Knowledge of a secret does not always diminish its value: an Igbo woman may recognize the socks worn by a masquerader- whose identity is meant to be secret-as the same ones she washed the previous night for her husband. But she may also acknowledge the mask as a vehicle for the spirit, and respect its secret at the same time that she sees through it.17 Fences, Frames, Onions, and Chinese Boxes Often associated with secrecy is the idea of the boundary-whether a literal boundary, such as a fence or a threshold, or a behavioral barrier, like the psycho- logical wall that two people create by whispering in front of others. And then there are still more complex kinds of boundaries-those that separate entire groupings of people by gender, age group, and class. In Africa, these barriers are established most often through initi- ation rites, which create social divisions that are expressed visually through buildings, masquerades, badges, and body arts, including dress, accoutre- ments, and scarification. Architecture forms the most obvious boundaries. The structures of a royal court, for example, ensure the inaccessi- bility of both the regalia and the king himself. Strother describes the Eastern Pende chief's royal residence as a suc- cession of increasingly prohibitive barri- ers that clearly separate insiders and outsiders. The pathway to the sanctuary where Fang reliquaries are kept is also barred; to gain access to the sacred site, novices must pass a progression of raf- fia-palm barricades at the forest edge (Fernandez 1982:260). Blier shows that the word for "secret" in Fon dialects is linked etymologically to the word for "fence" or "boundary." These barriers are not rigid, howev- er, and they are often potentially pene- trable. As several of the contributors to this book point out, the secret is a barri- er that seduces the outsider to break through. To describe the structure of Baktaman knowledge in New Guinea, Barth has used the metaphor of the Chinese box, suggesting a continual un- folding of layers of knowledge, each obscuring the one within it, and each subsequent level denouncing the previ- ous one: "The initiate realizes the exis- tence of veil behind veil, and how modest and largely incorrect his own understandings have been" (Barth 1975:219). The authors of Secrecy use similar metaphors-Suzanne Blier refers to the onion, for example, where layers lead only to more layers, and finally to the discovery that there is no core, no center. Gary van Wyk posits the black hole-the ineffable, ultimately unknow- able secret. And Allen Roberts's explo- rations of realms of obscurity and "black secrecy" demonstrate that "there is no 'ultimate truth' in this sense of knowl- edge." Implicated in the secret is the possibility of something unknown wait- ing to be discovered, but the secret is always poised on the threshold of un- derstanding and obscurity, of penetra- tion and prohibition. Whether the search for the secret occurs from within a society or from without, secrecy eludes and dissolves, PHOTO COURTESY OF SOTHEBY'S 18. Reliquary guardian figure. Sango, Gabon.

By the end...there are no more ultimate depths: the search for revelations is shown to be end- less. What remains are surfaces, mirrors, doubles-an ethnography of signs without essential content. (Clifford 1988:159) Secrecy: Signified and Signifying Secrecy proves to be an end in itself: it is neither that secrets lack substance nor that their content is insignificant, but that the assignation of fixed meanings and interpretations is only tangential to the real essence and purpose of the secret, which resides in its own signification. In linguistic terms, secrets favor the signifying over the signified. Unlike most of the signs that have only an arbi- trary correspondence to the object or idea they are intended to represent, a secret is a sign that stands for itself, and within that sign is both the presence and the absence of its own being. Inscribed into the secret is the erasure of the secret, and somehow the secret makes us (the viewers) as acutely aware of what is unseen and invisible as we are of what is there on the surface for every- one to behold. Bellman notes that "con- cealment and revelation are similar because the same text is used for both activities" (1984:5). Secrecy-as the paradoxical unity of revelation and concealment, of mean- ing and nonmeaning, of both signified and signifying-transcends the arbi- trary nature of the sign. A work of art can be a locale for the dialectics of pres- ence and absence to play themselves out, a landscape where the secret may emerge and submerge, manifest and recede, announce itself and then de- nounce itself. Secrecy: African Art That Conceals and Reveals naturally focuses on African art, distinguishing it from more broad-based studies of the secret.

From such an endeavor, much can be learned about both epistemology and aesthetic experi- ence in Africa, and also about the limits and obstacles to understanding those systems. This exhibition and book invite insiders and outsiders to step back, pause, and consider for a moment to whom knowledge ultimately belongs, and whether one can ever really know the secrets of other cultures and their art. As Barth remarks, "Secrecy...dramatizes and inculcates a deep emotional experi- ence of the partial nature of our under- standing compared to the uncharted fulness of reality" (1975:221).
