NUSSBAUM Brown University It will be seen how in place of the wealth and poverty of political economy come the rich human being and rich human need. The rich human being is simultaneously the human being in need of totality of human life-activities- the man in whom his own realization exists as an inner necessity, as need. -Marx, Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844 Svetaketu abstained from food for fifteen days.

'Go and eat! Then wilt thou understand me.' Then Svetaketu ate, and afterwards approached his father. And whatever his father asked him, he knew it all by heart.... After that, he understood what his father meant when he said: 'Mind, my son, comes from food, breath from water, speech from fire.' He understood what he said, yea, he understood it. -Chandogya-Upanihad4 WPrapathaka 7Kanda When you love a man you want him to live and when you hate him you want him to die.

I have in some cases conflated two separate conversations into one, but otherwise, things happened as I describe them.3 1. At a conference on value and technology, an American economist who has long been considered a radical delivers a paper urging the preservation of traditional ways of life in a rural area of India, now under threat of contamination from Western values. As evidence of the excellence of this rural way of life, he points to the fact that, whereas we Westemers experience a sharp split between the values that prevail in the workplace and the values that prevail in the home, here, by contrast, there exists what the economist calls "the embedded way of life." His example: just as in the home a menstruating woman is thought to pollute the kitchen and so may not enter it, so too in the workplace a menstruating women is taken to pollute the loom and may not enter the room where looms are kept. An economist from India objects that this example is repellent rather than admirable, for surely such practices both degrade the women in question and inhibit their freedom. The first economist's collaborator, an elegant French anthropologist (who would, I suspect, object violently to a purity check at the seminar room door) addresses the objector in contemptuous tones. Doesn't he realize that there is, in these matters, no privileged place to stand? Doesn't he know that he is neglecting the radical otherness of these village people by bringing his Western essentialist values into the picture? 2. The same French anthropologist now delivers her paper. She expresses regret that the introduction of smallpox vaccination to India by the British eradicated the cult of Sittala Devi, the goddess to whom one used to pray in order to avert smallpox. Here, she says, is another example of Western neglect of difference. Someone (it might have been me) objects that it is surely better to be healthy rather than ill, to live rather than to die. The frosty answer comes back: Western essentialist medicine conceives of things in terms of binary oppositions: life is opposed to death, health to disease. But if we cast away this blinkered way of seeing things, we will comprehend the radical otherness</page><page sequence="3">204 POLITICAL THEORY / May 1992 of Indian traditions. At this point, Eric Hobsbawm, who has been listening to the proceedings in increasingly uneasy silence, rises to deliver a blistering indictment of the traditionalism and relativism that prevail in this group. He lists examples of how the appeal to tradition has been used in history to defend various types of oppression and violence. His final example is that of National Socialism. In the chaos that ensues, most of the traditionalist social scientists (above all the ones from abroad, who do not know who Hobsbawm is) demand that Hobsbawm be asked to leave the conference room. The radical American economist, covered with embarrassment at this evidence of a split between his relativism and his left-wing affiliations, convinces them, with much difficulty, to let Hobsbawm remain. 3. We shift now to another conference,4 a philosophical conference organ- ized by me and by the objector of my first story, the economist from India who objected to the degradation of women by menstruation taboos. (He also holds the unsophisticated view that life is opposed to death.) His paper contains much "essentialist" talk of human functioning and human capabil- ity; he begins to speak of freedom of choice as a basic human good. At this point he is interrupted by the radical economist, who points out, with the air of one in the know, that contemporary anthropology has shown that non- Western people are not especially attached to freedom of choice. His exam- ple: a new book on Japan has shown that Japanese males, when they get home from work, do not wish to choose what to eat for dinner, what to wear, and so on. They wish all these choices to be taken out of their hands by their wives.5 A heated exchange follows about what this example really shows. I leave it to your imaginations to reconstruct it; it did have some humorous dimensions. But in the end, the confidence of the radical economist is unshaken: we are both victims of bad essentialist thinking, who fail to recognize the beauty of otherness. These examples are not unusual; I could cite many more. What we see in such cases is an odd phenomenon indeed. Highly intelligent people, people deeply committed to the good of women and men in developing countries, people who think of themselves as progressive and feminist and antiracist, are taking up positions that converge, as Hobsbawm correctly saw, with the positions of reaction, oppression, and sexism. Under the banner of their radical and politically correct "antiessentialism" march ancient religious taboos, the luxury of the pampered husband, ill health, ignorance, and death. (And in my own essentialist way, I say it at the outset. I do hold that death is opposed to life in the most binary way imaginable, and slavery to freedom, and hunger to adequate nutrition, and ignorance to knowledge.)</page><page sequence="4">Nussbaum / DEFENSE OF ARISTOTELIAN ESSENTIALISM 205 Essentialism is becoming a dirty word in the academy and in those parts of human life that are influenced by it. Essentialism -which for these purpose I shall understand as the view that human life has certain central defining features-is linked by its opponents with an ignorance of history, with lack of sensitivity to the voices of women and minorities.6 It is taken, usually without extended argument, to be in league with racism and sexism, with "patriarchal" thinking generally, whereas extreme relativism is taken to be a recipe for social progress. In this essay, I question these connections. I grant that some criticisms of some forms of essentialism have been fruitful and important: they have established the ethical debate on a more defensible metaphysical foundation and have redirected our gaze from unexamined abstract assumptions to the world and its actual history. But I argue that those who would throw out all appeals to a determinate account of the human being, human functioning, and human flourishing are throwing away far too much - in terms even, and especially, of their own compassionate ends. I argue, first, that the legitimate criticisms of essentialism still leave room for essentialism of a kind: for a historically sensitive account of the most basic human needs and human functions. I then sketch such an account, which I have developed at length elsewhere, showing how it can meet the legitimate objections. I then argue that without such an account, we do not have an adequate basis for an account of social justice and the ends of social distribution. With it, on the other hand, we have -what we urgently need at this time -the basis for a global ethic and a fully international account of distributive justice. Finally, I argue that without essentialism of a kind, we are deprived of two moral sentiments that are absolutely necessary if we are to live together decently in the world: compassion and respect.7 THE ASSA ULT ON ESSENTIALISM The contemporary assault on universal accounts of the human being and human functioning is not always accompanied by clear and explicit philo- sophical arguments. All too often, as in my examples, the opponents of essentialism use the word polemically as a term of abuse and with a certain air of superiority, as if they were in the know about some new and decisive discovery that removes the need for argument.8 So, the first task for anyone who wishes to defend a position in this debate must be, it seems to me, to introduce some clarity into the picture by sorting out the varieties of anti- essentialist argument and describing the train of thought that has led to the</page><page sequence="5">206 POLITICAL THEORY / May 1992 extreme relativist traditionalism exemplified in my Helsinki conversations. The attacks can, I believe, be divided into two groups: attacks that depend on a general attack on metaphysical realism and attacks that are independent of the attack on realism and might be pressed, therefore, against versions of essentialism that do not depend on realism. Attacks on Metaphysical-Realist Essentialism Metaphysical realism claims that there is some determinate way that the world is apart from the interpretive workings of the cognitive faculties of living beings. A description of the world is true just in case it corresponds to that independently existing structure, false insofar as it does not so corre- spond. Unless the metaphysical realist is also a skeptic - a combination rarely found, since it is hard to sustain confidence in realism without the belief that someone can adequately grasp reality -realism is accompanied by some related account of knowledge. Some mind or other-whether God's alone or certain human minds also - is said to be able to grasp this real structure as it is in itself; knowledge is defined in terms of this grasp. In thinking about this position, it is useful to consider the myth in Plato's Phaedrus. The gods, who have no internal impediments to understanding, march out to the rim of the heavens, and here, as the heavens tum, they see going past them the true forms or structures of the world, independent, eternal, and unchanging. Other souls, whose internal structure is more turbulent and conflicted, fail to stand serenely on the rim of heaven, and so fail to know the whole of reality. Some souls see bits and pieces of reality as they struggle upwards: these are the ones that will be human beings. Others grasp nothing of the truth - and these will be animals. On such a view, the way the human being essentially is will be a part of the independent furniture of the universe, something the gods can see and study independently of any experience of human life and human history. The paradigms that yield knowledge of what we in our nature are, are radically independent of our actual choices, our self-understandings, our hopes and loves and fears. They are there to be discovered by experts-whether philosophical, biological, or religious - and delivered to us by these figures or their intermediaries as a correct account of the way things are. This account is usually understood to have normative force: the heavenly account of what we are constrains what we may legitimately seek to be. The common objection to this sort of realism is that this sort of meta- physical truth is not in fact available. Sometimes this is put skeptically: the independent structure may still exist, but we can know nothing of it. More</page><page sequence="6">Nussbaum / DEFENSE OF ARISTOTELIAN ESSENTIALISM 207 often, today, doubt is cast on the coherence of the whole realist idea that there is some one determinate structure to the way things are, independent of all human interpretation. This is the objection that nonphilosophers tend to associate with Jacques Derrida's assault on the "metaphysics of presence," which he takes to have dominated the entirety of the Westem philosophical tradition.9 But it actually has a much longer and more complicated history. It begins in the Western tradition at least as early as Kant's assault on transcendent metaphysics -and perhaps far earlier, since some scholars have found a version of it in Aristotle's anti-Platonist arguments.10 Its con- temporary versions are themselves many and complex - involving, fre- quently, technical issues in the philosophy of science and the philosophy of language. In this sophisticated literature-whose major contributors in- clude such outstanding philosophers as Ludwig Wittgenstein, W.V.O. Quine, Donald Davidson, Hilary Putnam, and Nelson Goodman -the arguments of Derrida are relatively minor contributions, which do not even confront a great many of the pressing questions that are at issue." The attack on metaphysical realism is far too complex to be summarized here, but its implications for essentialism are clear. If the only available (or perhaps even coherent) picture of reality is one in the derivation of which human interpretations play a part, if the only defensible conceptions of truth and knowledge hold truth and knowledge to be in certain ways dependent on human cognitive activity within history, then the hope for a pure unmediated account of our human essence as it is in itself, apart from history and interpretation, is no hope at all but a deep confusion. To cling to it as a goal is to pretend that it is possible for us to be told from outside what to be and what to do, when in reality the only answers we can ever hope to have must come, in some manner, from ourselves. Attacks on Internalist Essentialism But one might accept these conclusions and still be an essentialist. One might, that is, believe that the deepest examination of human history and human cognitionfrom within still reveals a more or less determinate account of the human being, one that divides its essential from its accidental proper- ties. Such an account would say: take away properties X, Y, and Z (a suntan, let us say, or a knowledge of Chinese, or an income of $40,000 a year) and we will still have what we count as a human being on our hands. On the other hand, take away properties A, B, and C (the ability to think about the future, say, or the ability to respond to the claims of others, or the ability to choose and act) and we no longer have a human life at all. Separating these two</page><page sequence="7">208 POLITICAL THEORY / May 1992 groups of properties requires an evaluative inquiry: for we must ask, which things are so important that we will not count a life as a human life without them? Such an evaluative inquiry into what is deepest and most indispensable in our lives need not presuppose an external metaphysical foundation, clearly: it can be a way of looking at ourselves, asking what we really think about ourselves and what holds our history together. Later on, I shall pro- pose one version of such a historically grounded empirical essentialism - which, since it takes its stand within human experience, I shall now call "internalist" essentialism.'2 Such internalist conceptions of the human being are still vulnerable to some, if not all, of the charges brought against essentialism generally. So even though the opposition rarely makes the externalist/intemalist distinction, I shall myself introduce it, mentioning three charges that I think any good internalist account will need to answer. 1. NEGLECT OF HISTORICAL AND CULTURAL DIFFERENCES The opposition charges that any attempt to pick out some elements of human life as more fundamental than others, even without appeal to a transhistorical reality, is bound to be insufficiently respectful of actual historical and cultural differences. People, it is claimed, understand human life and humanness in widely different ways, and any attempt to produce a list of "essential properties" is bound to enshrine certain understandings of the human and to demote others. Usually, the objector continues, this takes the form of enshrining the understanding of a dominant group at the expense of minority understandings. Such objectors usually also suggest that only an actual unanimous agreement would be sufficient to justify an essentialist conclusion. But in practice, such agreements are not forthcoming, so essen- tialism is bound to consist of the imposition of someone's authority on someone else. 2. NEGLECT OFAUTONOMY A different objection is pressed by liberal opponents of essentialism; usually these opponents are themselves willing to be essentialist about the central importance of human freedom and autonomy.'3 The objection is that by determining in advance what elements of human life have most impor- tance, the essentialist is failing to respect the right of people to choose a plan of life according to their own lights, determining what is most central and what is not. Such evaluative choices must be left to each citizen. For this</page><page sequence="8">Nussbaum / DEFENSE OF ARISTOTELIAN ESSENTIALISM 209 reason, politics must refuse itself a determinate theory of the human being and the human good. 3. PREJUDICIAL APPLICATION If we operate with a determinate conception of the human being that is meant to have some normative moral and political weight, we must also, in applying it, ask which beings we take to fall under the concept. Here, the objector notes that all too easily the powerless can be excluded. Aristotle himself, it is pointed out, held that women and slaves were not full-fledged human beings; and since his politics was based on his essentialism, the failure of these beings (in his view) to exhibit the desired essence led to their political exclusion and oppression. The suggestion is that renouncing the use of such a determinate conception of the human will make it easier for such people to be heard and included. The Collapse into Subjectivism Each of these objections has some force. Later on in the essay, I ask how much force each of them has and whether there is a version of essentialism that can survive them. But what is alarming about the current debate in a variety of fields - literary theory, some parts of legal theory, and much of economic theory and development studies -is that this further inquiry has not taken place. Very often, as in my Helsinki examples, the collapse of metaphysical realism is taken to entail not only the collapse of essentialism about the human being but a retreat into an extreme relativism, or even subjectivism, about all questions of evaluation.14 The retreat usually takes the following form. First, an impossible demand is made, say, for unmediated presentness to reality as it is in itself or for an actual universal agreement about matters of value. Next, it is claimed that this demand cannot be met. Then, without any further ado -without looking at internal realist positions, such as those of Charles Taylor and Hilary Putnam, and without asking what more moderate cognitive demands can be met- the theorist concludes that everything is up for grabs and there are no norms to give us guidance in matters of evaluation. For some theorists, evaluation then becomes a matter of power: the criterion of truth will derive from one's contingent position of social authority.15 For others, it becomes, instead, a matter of play and self-assertion: what is good is what I (whether for reasons or arbitrarily or whimsically) choose to assert."6 For still others,</page><page sequence="9">210 POLITICAL THEORY / May 1992 as we shall see, value collapses into utility: to judge something good is part of a transaction in which one seeks to maximize one's utility (understood as desire-satisfaction or wealth or whatever). And if you ask how come the theorist can confidently assert that normative theory of evaluation, the answer (as in the case of the ancient Greek skeptics) tums back on itself: what I say is itself an exercise of power or playfulness or utility-maximizing, like everything else. Let's see whether you will be influenced or play along or join in the profit-taking game.'7 In this exercise, accounts of the human being go the way of everything else: give the one you like, and let's see who likes (or is influenced by) it. None can be said to be better than any other, except in the sense that individuals may, playing their games, assert that this or that one is better. But there are no good reasons and no rational persuasion. Furthermore, in a more general attack on distinction-making, all "binary oppositions" are frequently called into question - as if it is always both illegitimate and somehow bad to oppose one thing clearly to another, as if such distinction-making were always a preparation for some cruelty or oppression.'8 By these steps we arrive, in some cases, at the complete banishment of logic-that allegedly male patriarchal imperialist phenomenon. Since we are talking of the collapse of distinctions, nothing is stranger than the way in which positions that take themselves to be in crucial respects distinct collapse together at this point. The proponents of these extreme antiessentialist views usually take themselves, as I said, to be politically progressive and compassionate, moved by thought about the good of women, minorities, poor, and excluded people everywhere. Much of the force of their rhetoric trades on this, suggesting that if one disagrees with them, one is thereby manifesting at best callousness, at worst racism and sexism. But consider for a moment whose company these allegedly compassionate critics are keeping. Fish says that all judgment is a matter of power- no good and bad reasons. This implies that one can never give a morally good reason for criticizing the verdicts of established authority: when one does so one is by definition just playing for power and is thus no better, morally, than one's opponent. Where the game is power, weakness is always worse. The poor are losers, and that's that. A more lighthearted deconstructionist says it is all a matter of free play. So, if I want to play around with torture and slavery and you want to stop me, nothing can be said about the moral superiority of you to me. You have your way of playing, I have mine. This very point is made, using very similar arguments, by people who really do want to use the conclusion to deny certain substantive claims of justice. I urge a reading of Robert Bork's The Tempting of America'9 along-</page><page sequence="10">Nussbaum / DEFENSE OF ARISTOTELIAN ESSENTIALISM 211 side the works of Fish and the deconstructionists, for a crucial part of Bork's argument against the idea that judges may invoke substantive moral princi- ples in constitutional interpretation - and thus a crucial part of his assault on the right to privacy -is a very general assault on ethical evaluation. This assault has the same structure as the allegedly progressive arguments just examined. Bork begins by demanding universal agreement as the criterion of acceptability for an ethical principle.20 No principles, of course, pass the test. Without further ado and without any search for other criteria of evalua- tion, Bork concludes that all moral evaluation is altogether arbitrary and subjective. The evaluator is "adrift on an uncertain sea," with "no principled way to make the necessary distinctions."2' All attempted persuasion is really seduction - and Bork evidently has a very low opinion of seduction, which he does not connect with judgment or deep needs or even good taste. Judges who attempt to decide cases on the basis of principle are simply asserting their own "value preferences."22 Bork now gives a striking example of his subjectivist view. There is, he says, no principled way to distinguish the pain of a living being who is being tortured from the pain caused to a religious conservative by the knowledge that some couples in the state of Connecticut are using contraception.' Therefore, there is also no way to distinguish, morally, between the action of the torturer and the action of the user of contraception. This being the case, we must leave such matters to the struggle of power -that is, to a majority vote understood, as Bork understands voting, as the aggregation of a lot of different subjective preferences. In other words, torture should be illegal only because at this time in our history, the majority votes that way. Sexual privacy, on the other hand, should not be protected where state laws give evidence that a majority would prefer to interfere.24 Here, we see clearly what ends the rhetoric of subjectivism can actually serve and is serving in American political life. Caveat deconstructor. Perhaps the clearest case of the collapse of the progressive into the reac- tionary through the denial of substantive evaluation is Barbara Herrnstein Smith's book, Contingencies of Value.25 Smith begins by attacking all nor- mative evaluation in a variety of ways - above all, by suggesting that all nor- mative views of value are committed both to metaphysical realism and to transcendent religious authority as the source of normative claims.' She clearly takes her own view, by contrast, to be open-minded, secular, and pro- gressive. But what does she put in the place of evaluation? The idea of the market, and a model of value judgment as utility maximization. She agrees vigorously with Chicago school economists such as Gary Becker and George Stigler (whom she praises)27 concerning the subjectivity of evaluation. Milton Friedman's famous remark that about matters of value "men can only fight"28</page><page sequence="11">212 POLITICAL THEORY / May 1992 could have been a sentence in her book, were it not for Friedman's greater succinctness and clarity of expression. Moreover, Smith goes further even than Friedman: she follows the lead of Gary Becker and Richard Posner29 in extending this model to areas of human life, such as the law, and even family life and child rearing, that were not previously covered by the market idea.30 Later on, I will be speaking about criticisms of utility within economics and about ways in which the normative appeal to utility serves to bolster the status quo in developing countries. For now, I need only point to the odd situation at which we have arrived: after a lot of radical fanfare, a lot of promises to think new thoughts, and to undo age-old ways -how do we end up? With neoclassical economics, Chicago style, a view neither new nor especially progressive. Free play and power games, American style. Now we are in a better position to understand why alleged radicals nearly threw Eric Hobsbawm out of the room. The commitment that he, as a Marxist, has to a determinate conception of human need and human flourishing is profoundly at odds with the new subjectivism, which takes itself to be the truly progressive and compassionate force. To this company, Hobsbawm and Amartya Sen (who was, I now reveal, the objector of my first two examples and the speaker in the third) looked like unfashionable paternalistic author- ities, insensitive to the play of difference. On the other hand, Hobsbawm and Sen saw what the subjectivists did not perhaps so clearly see: that to give up on all evaluation and, in particular, on a normative account of the human being and human functioning was to turn things over to the free play of forces in a world situation in which the social forces affecting the lives of women, minorities, and the poor are rarely benign. CONFRONTING THE OBJECTIONS Let me say very directly where I stand on the objections to essentialism. I believe that Kantian and related contemporary arguments (by Quine, Davidson, Putnam, and Goodman in particular) have indeed successfully established the untenability of extreme metaphysical realism. I cannot argue this here, but I hope it can at least be agreed that it would be extremely unwise for a political proposal to rely on the truth of metaphysical realism, given our current argumentative situation. On the other hand, it does not seem to me that such a result shows anything like what the relativist objectors think it shows. When we get rid of the hope of a transcendent metaphysical grounding for our evaluative judgments -about the human being as about anything else -we are not left with the abyss. We have everything that we always had</page><page sequence="12">Nussbaum / DEFENSE OF ARISTOTELIAN ESSENTIALISM 213 all along: the exchange of reasons and arguments by human beings within history, in which, for reasons that are historical and human but not the worse for that, we hold some things to be good and others bad, some arguments to be sound and others not sound. Why, indeed, should the relativist conclude that the absence of a transcendent basis for judgment - a basis that, according to them, was never there anyway -should make us despair of doing as we have done all along, distinguishing persuasion from manipulation? In fact, the collapse into extreme relativism or subjectivism seems to me to betray a deep attachment to metaphysical realism itself. For it is only to one who has pinned everything to that hope that its collapse will seem to entail the collapse of all evaluation -just as it is only to a deeply believing religious person, as Nietzsche saw, that the news of the death of God brings the threat of nihilism. What we see here, I think, is a reaction of shame -a turning away of the eyes from our poor humanity, which looks so mean and bare -by contrast to a dream of another sort. What do we have here, these critics seem to say? Only our poor old human conversations, our human bodies that interpret things so imperfectly? Well, if that is all there is, we do not really want to study it too closely, to look into the distinctions it exhibits. We will just say that they are all alike, for, really, they do look pretty similar when compared to the heavenly standard we were seeking. It is like the moment reported by Aristotle when some students arrived at the home of Heraclitus, eager to see the great sage and cosmologist. They found him -not on a hilltop gazing at the heavens but sitting in his kitchen or, perhaps, on the toilet (for there is a philological dispute at this point!). He looked at their disappointed faces, saw that they were about to turn away their eyes, and said, "Come in, don't be afraid. There are gods here too." Aristotle uses this story to nudge his reluctant students out of the shame that is preventing them from looking closely at the parts of animals. When you get rid of your shame, he says, you will notice that there is order and structure in the animal world.3" So too, I think, with realism: the failure to take an interest in studying our practices of analyzing and reasoning, human and historical as they are, the insistence that we would have good arguments only if they came from heaven - all this betrays a shame before the human. On the other hand, if we really think of the hope of a transcendent ground for value as uninteresting and irrelevant, as we should, then the news of its collapse will not change the way we do things: it will just let us get on with the business of reasoning in which we were already engaged. And as Hilary Putnam argues,32 the demise of realism may even boost the status of ethical evaluation. For the metaphysical realist frequently made a sharp distinction between fact and value, believing that truth of the sort the</page><page sequence="13">214 POLMCAL THEORY / May 1992 realist is after was available in the scientific realm but not in the realm of value. Bringing science inside human history makes what was already believed to be in there look better, not worse -because its claims are no longer contrasted sharply with claims that look "harder" and more "factual." Thus the polarity between scientific fact and subjective ethical value on which much of neoclassical economics rests is called into question by the collapse of realism - from the side of science, to be sure, but this reopens the whole question of the relationship between ethics and science and makes it possible to argue, as does Putnam, that ethics is no worse off than any science. As for the objections to internalist essentialism, each of them has some force. Many essentialist conceptions have been insular in an arrogant way and neglectful of differences among cultures and ways of life. Some have been neglectful of choice and autonomy. And some have been prejudicially applied - sometimes even by their inventors (as in the cases of Aristotle and Rousseau). But none of this, it seems to me, shows that all essentialism must fail in one or more of these ways. And if one feels that there are urgent reasons why we need such an account of human functioning, one will be motivated to try to construct one that will in fact meet the objections. I now propose such an account and then return to the area of development policy, offering my reasons for thinking that we do in fact urgently need such an account. ANESSENTIALISTPROPOSAL: THE BASIC HUMAN FUNCTIONS Here, then, is a sketch of an internal-essentialist proposal, an account of the most important functions of the human being, in terms of which human life is defined.33 The idea is that once we identify a group of especially important functions in human life, we are then in a position to ask what social and political institutions are doing about them. Are they giving people what they need in order to be capable of functioning in all these human ways? And are they doing this in a minimal way, or are they making it possible for citizens to function well? I will consider the political implications of the account in the next section; now I must describe the account itself. I call this account of the human functions the "thick vague theory of the good."34 The point of this name is to insist, first of all, on the normative character of the list. We are not pretending to discover some value-neutral facts about ourselves, independently of all evaluation; instead, we are con- ducting an especially probing and basic sort of evaluative inquiry. The name is also chosen to contrast the account with John Rawls's "thin theory of the</page><page sequence="14">Nussbaum / DEFENSE OF ARISTOTELIAN ESSENTIALISM 215 good," which insists on confining the list of the "primary goods" that will be used by the members of the Original Position to a group of allegedly all-purpose means that have a role in any conception of the human good whatever. By contrast, my Aristotelian conception is concerned with ends and with the overall shape and content of the human form of life.35 Finally, the list is "vague," and this deliberately so and in a good sense, for, as we shall see, it admits of much multiple specification in accordance with varied local and personal conceptions. The idea is that it is better to be vaguely right than precisely wrong; I claim that without the guidance offered by such a list,what we often get in public policy is precise wrongness. This conception is emphatically not metaphysical; that is, it does not claim to derive from any source external to the actual self-interpretations and self-evaluations of human beings in history.36 Nor is it peculiar to a single metaphysical or religious tradition. It aims to be as universal as possible, and its guiding intuition, in fact, directs it to cross religious, cultural, and metaphysical gulfs. For it begins from two facts: first, that we do recognize others as human across many divisions of time and place. Whatever the differences we encounter, we are rarely in doubt as to when we are dealing with a human being and when we are not. The essentialist account attempts to describe the bases for these recognitions, by mapping out the general shape of the human form of life, those features that constitute a life as human wherever it is. Second, we do have a broadly shared general consensus about the features whose absence means the end of a human form of life. We have in medicine and mythology alike an idea that some transitions or changes just are not compatible with the continued existence of that being as a member of the human kind (and thus as the same individual, since species identity seems to be necessary for personal identity). This is really just another way of coming at the first question, of asking what the most central features of our common humanity are, without which no individual can be counted (or counted any longer) as human.3" This evaluative inquiry proceeds by examining a wide variety of self- understandings of people in many times and places. Especially valuable are myths and stories that situate the human being in some way in the universe: between the beasts, on one hand, and the gods, on the other; stories that ask what it is to live as a being with certain abilities that set it apart from the rest of the living beings in the world of nature, and with, on the other hand, certain limits that derive from our membership in the world of nature. The idea is that we do share at least a very general outline of such a conception. Frequently, we find such ideas elucidated in stories of beings who look like humans but are not recognized as human. When we ask ourselves, "Why, if</page><page sequence="15">216 POLITICAL THEORY/ May 1992 these creatures resemble human beings, don't we count them as human?" we learn something about ourselves. Consider, for example, the many stories told by ancient Greeks about the Olympian gods -beings who look like human beings, who have many of the same desires and ways of acting, but who are also immortal and, in certain ways, unlimited. Imagining their way of life tells us something about the role of certain natural limits in making us the beings we are. Consider, on the other hand, the Cyclopes of Homer's Odyssey, beings who have a human form but who live in isolation from one another and lack all sensitivity to the needs of others, all sense of community and affiliation. Again, we learn something about our own self-understanding when we notice that our stories treat such creatures as nonhuman monsters.38 The great convergence across cultures in such recognitions and refusals of recognition gives us some reason for optimism that if we proceed in this way, using our imaginations, we will have in the end a theory that is not the mere projection of our own customs but is also fully international and a basis for cross-cultural attunement. The list of features that we get if we reflect in this way is, and should be, open-ended. For we want to allow the possibility that we will learn from our encounters with other human societies to recognize things about ourselves that we had not seen before, or even to change in certain ways, according more importance to something we had considered more peripheral. The list is an intuitive approximation, whose purpose is not to cut off discussion but to direct attention to certain features of importance. The list, moreover, is heterogeneous, for it contains both limits against which we press and capa- bilities through which we aspire. This is not surprising, since we begin from the idea of a creature who is both capable and needy. We shall return to this point, showing how it affects the political use of the list. Here, then, as a first approximation, is a story about what seems to be part of any life that we will count as a human life: Level I of the Thick Vague Conception: The Shape of the Human Form of Life Mortality. All human beings face death and, after a certain age, know that they face it. This fact shapes more or less every other element of human life. Moreover, all human beings have an aversion to death. Although in many circumstances death will be preferred to the available alternatives, the death of a loved one or the prospect of one's own death is an occasion for grief and/or fear. If we encountered an immortal anthropomorphic being or a mortal being that showed no aversion to death and no tendency to avoid</page><page sequence="16">Nussbaum / DEFENSE OF ARISTOTELIAN ESSENTIALISM 217 death, we would judge, in both these cases, that the form of life was so different from our own that the being could not be acknowledged as human. The human body. We live all our lives in bodies of a certain sort, whose possibilities and vulnerabilities do not as such belong to one human society rather than another. These bodies, similar far more than dissimilar (given the enormous range of possibilities), are our homes, so to speak, opening certain options and denying others, giving us certain needs and also certain possibil- ities for excellence. The fact that any given human being might have lived anywhere and belonged to any culture is a great part of what grounds our mutual recognitions; this fact, in turn, has a great deal to do with the general humanness of the body, its great distinctness from other bodies. The experi- ence of the body is, to be sure, culturally shaped, but the body itself, not culturally variant in its nutritional and other related requirements, sets limits on what can be experienced, ensuring a great deal of overlap. There is much disagreement, of course, about how much of human experience is rooted in the body. Here, religion and metaphysics enter the picture in a nontrivial way. Therefore, in keeping with the nonmetaphysical character of the list, I shall include at this point only those features that would be agreed to be bodily even by determined dualists. The more controversial features, such as thinking, perceiving, and emotion, I shall discuss separately, taking no stand on the question of dualism.39 1. Hunger and thirst; the need for food and drink. All human beings need food and drink in order to live; all have comparable, though varying, nutritional requirements. Being in one culture rather than another does not make one metabolize food differently. Furthermore, all human beings have appetites that are indices of need. Appetitive experience is to some extent culturally shaped, but we are not surprised to discover much similarity and overlap. Moreover, human beings in general do not wish to be hungry or thirsty (though, of course, they might choose to fast for some reason). If we discovered someone who really did not experience hunger or thirst at all, or, experiencing them, really did not care about eating and drinking, we would judge that this creature was (in Aristotle's words) "far from being a human being." 2. Need for shelter. A recurrent theme in myths of humanness is the nakedness of the human being, its relative susceptibility to heat, cold, and the ravages of the elements. Stories that explore the difference between our needs and those of furry or scaly or otherwise protected creatures remind us how far our life is constituted by the need to find refuge from the cold, the withering heat of the sun, from rain, wind, snow, and frost. 3. Sexual desire. Though less urgent as a need than the needs for food, drink, and shelter (in the sense that one can live without its satisfaction), sexual need</page><page sequence="17">218 POLITICAL THEORY / May 1992 and desire are features of more or less every human life. It is, and has been all along, a most important basis for the recognition of others different from ourselves as human beings. 4. Mobility. Human beings are, as the old definition goes, featherless bipeds - that is, creatures whose form of life is in part constituted by the ability to move from place to place in a certain characteristic way, not only through the aid of tools that we have made but with our very own bodies. Human beings like moving about and dislike being deprived of mobility. An anthropomorphic being who, without disability, chose never to move from birth to death would be hard to view as human. Capacity for pleasure and pain. Experiences of pain and pleasure are common to all human life (though once again both their expression and, to some extent, the experience itself may be culturally shaped). Moreover, the aversion to pain as a fundamental evil is a primitive and, it appears, unlearned part of being a human animal. A society whose members altogether lacked that aversion would surely be judged to be beyond the bounds of humanness. Cognitive capability: perceiving, imagining, thinks:q. All human beings have sense perception, the ability to imagine, and the ability to think, making distinctions and "reaching out for understanding,'"40 and these abilities are regarded as of central importance. It is an open question what sorts of accidents or impediments to individuals in these areas will be sufficient for us to judge that the life in question is not really human any longer. But it is safe to say that if we imagine a tribe whose members totally lack sense perception or totally lack imagination or totally lack reasoning and thinking, we are not in any of these cases imagining a tribe of human beings, no matter what they look like. Early infant development. All human beings begin as hungry babies, aware of their own helplessness, experiencing their altemating closeness to and distance from that, and those, on whom they depend. This common structure to early life -which clearly is shaped in many different ways by different social arrangements -gives rise to a great deal of overlapping experience that is central in the formation of desires and of complex emo- tions such as grief, love, and anger. This, in tum, is a major source of our ability to recognize ourselves in the emotional experiences of those whose lives are very different in other respects from our own. If we encountered a tribe of apparent humans and then discovered that they never had been babies and had never, in consequence, had those experiences of extreme depen- dency, need, and affection, we would, I think, have to conclude that their</page><page sequence="18">Nussbaum / DEFENSE OF ARISTOTELLAN ESSENTIALISM 219 form of life was sufficiently different from our own that they could not be considered part of the same kind. Practical reason. All human beings participate (or try to) in the planning and managing of their own lives, asking and answering questions about what is good and how one should live. Moreover, they wish to enact their thought in their lives - to be able to choose and evaluate and to function accordingly. This general capability has many concrete forms and is related in complex ways to the other capabilities, emotional, imaginative, and intellectual. But a being who altogether lacks this would not be likely to be regarded as fully human in any society. Affiliation with other human beings. All human beings recognize and feel some sense of affiliation and concern for other human beings. Moreover, we value the form of life that is constituted by these recognitions and affiliations. We live for and with others and regard a life not lived in affiliation with others to be a life not worth living. (Here, I would really wish, along with Aristotle, to spell things out further. We define ourselves in terms of at least two sorts of affiliation: intimate family and/or personal relations and social or civic relations.) Relatedness to other species and to nature. Human beings recognize that they are not the only living things in their world, that they are animals living alongside other animals and also alongside plants in a universe that, as a complex interlocking order, both supports and limits them. We are dependent on that order in countless ways, and we also sense that we owe that order some respect and concern, however much we may differ about exactly what we owe, to whom, and on what basis. Again, a creature who treated animals exactly like stones and could not be brought to see any difference would probably be regarded as too strange to be human. So, too, would a creature who did not in any way respond to the beauty and wonder of the natural world. Humor and play. Human life, wherever it is lived, makes room for recreation and laughter. The forms that play takes are enormously varied; yet we recognize other humans, across cultural barriers, as the animals who laugh. Laughter and play are frequently among the deepest and also the first modes of our mutual recognition. Inability to play or laugh is taken, correctly, as a sign of deep disturbance in an individual child; if it proves permanent, we will doubt whether the child is capable of leading a fully human life. An</page><page sequence="19">220 POLITICAL THEORY / May 1992 entire society that lacked this ability would seem to us both terribly strange and terribly frightening. Separateness. However much we live with and for others, we are, each of us, "one in number," proceeding on a separate path through the world from birth to death. Each person feels only his or her own pain and not anyone else's. Each person dies without entailing logically the death of anyone else. When one person walks across the room, no other person follows automati- cally. When we count the number of human beings in a room, we have no difficulty figuring out where one begins and the other ends. These obvious facts need stating because they might have been otherwise. We should bear them in mind when we hear talk of the absence of individualism in certain societies. Even the most intense forms of human interaction, for example, sexual experience, are experiences of responsiveness, not of fusion. If fusion is made the goal, the result is bound to be bitter disappointment. Because of separateness, each human life has, so to speak, its own peculiar context and surroundings -objects, places, a history, particular friendships, locations, sexual ties - that are not exactly the same as those of anyone else, and in terms of which the person to some extent identifies oneself. Although societies vary a great deal in the degree and type of strong separateness that they permit and foster, there is no life yet known that really does (as Plato wished) fail to use the words "mine" and "not mine" in some personal and nonshared way. What I use, touch, love, and respond to, I touch, use, love, and respond to from my own separate existence. And on the whole, human beings recognize one another as beings who wish to have at least some separateness of context, a little space to move around in, some special items to love or use. As already said, the list is composed of two different sorts of items: limits and capabilities. As far as capabilities go, to call them part of humanness is to make a very basic sort of evaluation. It is to say that a life without this item would be too lacking, too impoverished, to be human at all. Obviously, then, it could not be a good human life. So, this list of capabilities is a ground-floor, or minimal, conception of the good. With the limits, things are more compli- cated. For we have said that human life, in its general form, consists in a struggle against these limits. Humans do not wish to be hungry, to feel pain, to die. (Separateness is highly complex-both a limit and a capability.) Yet we cannot assume that the correct evaluative conclusion to draw is that we should try as hard as possible to get rid of the limit altogether. It is charac- teristic of human life to prefer recurrent hunger plus eating to a life with neither hunger nor eating, to prefer sexual desire and its satisfaction to a life</page><page sequence="20">Nussbaum / DEFENSE OF ARISTOTELIAN ESSENTIALISM 221 with neither desire nor satisfaction. Even where death is concerned, the desire for immortality, which human beings certainly seem to have, is a peculiar desire. For it is not clear that the wish to lose one's finitude completely is a desire that one can coherently wish for oneself or for someone whom one loves. That would seem to be a wish for a transition to a way of life so wholly different, with such different values and ends, that it is not clear that the identity of the individual could be preserved. So the evaluative conclusion needs to be expressed with much caution, clearly, in terms of what would be a humanly good way of countering the limitation.41 Things now get complicated, for we want to describe two distinct thresh- holds: a threshhold of capability to function, beneath which a life will be so impoverished that it will not be human at all, and a somewhat higher thresh- hold, beneath which those characteristic functions are available in such a reduced way that although we may judge the form of life a human one, we will not think it a good human life. The latter threshhold is the one that will eventually concern us most when we turn to public policy, for we do not want societies to make their citizens capable of the bare minimum. These are clearly, in many areas, two distinct threshholds, requiring distinct levels of resource and capability. Yet there is need for caution here. For, in many cases, the move from human life to good human life is supplied by the citizens' own powers of choice and self-definition, in such a way that once society places them above the first threshhold, moving above the second is more or less up to them. This is especially likely to be so, I think, in areas such as affiliation and practical reasoning, where what we want from society and from other associations within it, such as the family, is a development of the child so that it passes the first threshhold. On the other hand, it is clear that where bodily health and nutrition, for example, are concerned, there is a consider- able difference between the two threshholds, a difference made by resources over which individuals do not have full control. Clearly, there is a continuum here, and it is always going to be difficult to say where the upper threshhold, especially, should be located. Here, then, as the next level of the conception of the human being, I now specify certain basic functional capabilities at which societies should aim for their citizens (in accordance with the political idea more fully investigated in the next section). In other words, this will be an account of the second threshhold - although in some areas, it seems to me to coincide with the first. I shall actually introduce the list as one of related capabilities rather than of actual functionings, since I shall argue that capability to function, not actual functioning, should be the goal of legislation and public planning.</page><page sequence="21">222 POLITICAL THEORY / May 1992 Level 2 of the Thick Vague Conception: Basic Human Functional Capabilities 1. Being able to live to the end of a complete human life, as far as is possible; not dying prematurely, or before one's life is so reduced as to be not worth living. 2. Being able to have good health; to be adequately nourished; to have adequate shelter; having opportunities for sexual satisfaction; being able to move from place to place. 3. Being able to avoid unnecessary and nonbeneficial pain and to have pleasur- able experiences. 4. Being able to use the five senses; being able to imagine, to think, and to reason. 5. Being able to have attachments to things and persons outside ourselves; to love those who love and care for us, to grieve at their absence, in general, to love, grieve, to feel longing and gratitude. 6. Being able to form a conception of the good and to engage in critical reflection about the planning of one's own life. 7. Being able to live for and with others, to recognize and show concern for other human beings, to engage in various forms of familial and social interaction. 8. Being able to live with concern for and in relation to animals, plants, and the world of nature. 9. Being able to laugh, to play, to enjoy recreational activities. 10. Being able to live one's on life and nobody else's; being able to live one's own life in one's very own surroundings and context. The Aristotelian essentialist claims that a life that lacks any one of these, no matter what else it has, will be lacking in humanness. So it would be reasonable to take these things as a focus for concern, in asking how public policy can promote the good of human beings. The list is, emphatically, a list of separate components. We cannot satisfy the need for one of them by giving a larger amount of another one. All are of central importance, and all are distinct in quality. This limits the trade-offs that it will be reasonable to make, and thus limits the applicability of quantitative cost-benefit analysis. At the same time, the items on the list are related to one another in many complex ways. For example, our characteristic mode of nutrition, unlike that of sponges, requires moving from here to there. And we do whatever we do as separate beings, tracing distinct paths through space and time. Among the capabilities, two - practical reason and affiliation - play a special role as architectonic, holding the whole enterprise together and making it human. All animals nourish themselves, use their senses, move about, and so forth; what is distinctive and distinctively valuable to us about the human way of doing all this is that each and every one of these functions</page><page sequence="22">Nussbaum / DEFENSE OF ARISTOTELLAN ESSENTIALISM 223 is, first of all, planned and organized by practical reason and, second, done with and to others. Human nourishing is not like animal nourishing, nor human sex like animal sex, because human beings can choose to regulate their nutrition and their sexual activity by their very own practical reason; also because they do so not as solitary Cyclopes (who would eat anything at all, even their own guests) but as beings who are bound to other human beings by ties of mutual attention and concern.42 ANSWERING THE OBJECTIONS I must now try to show how the thick vague theory of the good can answer the objections most commonly made against essentialism. First of all, it should be clear by now that the list does not derive from any extrahistorical metaphysical conception, or rely on the truth of any form of metaphysical realism. As I have said, its guiding intuition is that we do recognize as human, people who do not share our own metaphysical and religious ideas; it aims to get at the root of those recognitions. It does so by conducting an inquiry that is, frankly, both evaluative and internal to human history. Furthermore, the conception does not even demand universal actual agreement among human beings in order to play the moral and political role that we want it to play. I have tried to arrive at a list that will command a very wide consensus, and a consensus that is fully international. Its very close resemblance to other similar lists worked out independently in parts of the world as divergent as Finland and Sri Lanka43 gives some reason for optimism about consensus. On the other hand, unanimity is not required; for people who have not been willing to engage in the cross-cultural study and the probing evaluation that is behind the list may well refuse assent for varied reasons. Even among those who do engage in the inquiry, there may be differences of opinion. With regard to some components of the list, the very act of entering a disagreement seems to be an acknowledgment of the importance of the component: this seems true, for example, of both practical reasoning and affiliation. But with regard to others, there will be room for ongoing debate and reformulation. The aim is, simply, to achieve enough of a working consensus that we can use the list as a basis for the kind of political reflection that I describe in the next section. (We may usefully compare, at this point, John Rawls's idea of an "overlapping consensus" that is political and not metaphysical.44) So, the objections to essentialism that assume its dependence on realism seem to fail, in this particular case.</page><page sequence="23">224 POLITICAL THEORY / May 1992 As for the three objections to "internalist" essentialism, each one of them is, and should remain, a central concern of the Aristotelian essentialist. For the list will command the sort of broad consensus she wishes only if these objections can be successfully met. Concerning neglect of historical and cultural difference, the Aristotelian begins by insisting that the thick vague conception is vague for precisely this reason. The list claims to have identified in a very general way components that are fundamental to any human life. But it allows in its very design for the possibility of multiple specifications of each of the components. This is so in several different ways. First, the constitutive circumstances of human life, while broadly shared, are themselves realized in different forms in different societies. The fear of death, the love of play, relationships of friend- ship and affiliation with others, even the experience of the bodily appetites - these never turn up in simply the vague and general form in which they have been introduced here but always in some specific and historically rich cultural realization, which can profoundly shape not only the conceptions used by the citizens in these areas but their experiences themselves. None- theless, we do have in these areas of our common humanity sufficient overlap to sustain a general conversation, focusing on our common problems and prospects. Sometimes, the common conversation will permit us to criticize some conceptions of the grounding experiences themselves, as at odds with other things that human beings want to do and to be.45 When we are choosing a conception of good functioning with respect to these circumstances, we can expect an even greater degree of plurality to become evident. Here, the Aristotelian essentialist wants to retain plurality in two significantly different ways: what we may call the way of plural specification and the way of local specification.46 Plural specification means what its name implies. The political plan, while using a determinate conception of the good at a high level of generality, leaves a great deal of latitude for citizens to specify each of the components more concretely and with much variety, in accordance with local traditions or individual tastes. As for local specification, Aristotelian practical reasoning is always done, when well done, with a rich sensitivity to the concrete context, to the characters of the agents and their social situation. This means that in addition to the pluralism I have just described, the Aristotelian needs to consider a different sort of plural specification of the good. For sometimes what is a good way of promoting education in one part of the world will be completely ineffectual in another. Forms of affiliation that flourish in one community may prove impossible to sustain in another. In such cases, the Aristotelian</page><page sequence="24">Nussbaum / DEFENSE OF ARISTOTELIAN ESSENTIALISM 225 must aim at some concrete specification of the general list that suits and develops out of the local conditions. This will always most reasonably be done in a participatory dialogue with those who are most deeply immersed in those conditions. For although Aristotelianism does not hesitate to criticize tradition where tradition perpetrates injustice or oppression, it does not believe in saying anything at all without rich and full information, gathered not so much from detached study as from the voices of those who live the ways of life in question. Later, when I discuss efforts made to enhance female literacy in rural Bangladesh, I shall give a concrete example of this sort of participatory dialogue and draw some further conclusions about this problem. The liberal charges the Aristotelian with neglect of autonomy, arguing that any such determinate conception removes from the citizens the chance to make their own choices about the good life. This is a complicated issue; four points can be stressed.47 First, the list is a list of capabilities, and not actual functions, precisely because the conception is designed to leave room for choice. Government is not directed to push citizens into acting in certain valued ways; instead, it is directed to make sure that all human beings have the necessary resources and conditions for acting in those ways. It leaves the choice up to them. A person with plenty of food can always choose to fast; a person who has access to subsidized university education can always decide to do something else instead. By making opportunities available, govemment enhances, and does not remove, choice.48 Second, this respect for choice is built deeply into the list itself in the architectonic role it gives to practical reasoning. One of the most central capabilities promoted by the conception will be the capability of choosing itself, which is made among the most fundamental elements of the human essence.49 Third, we should note that the major liberal view in this area, the view of John Rawls, does not shrink from essentialism of our internal sort in just this area. Rawls insists that satisfac- tions that are not the outgrowth of one's very own choices have no moral worth, and he conceives of the "two moral powers" (analogous to our practical reasoning) and of sociability (corresponding to our affiliation) as built into the definition of the parties in the original position and thus as necessary constraints on any outcome they will select.5 In this way, the liberal view and the Aristotelian view converge more than one might initially suppose. Finally, the Aristotelian insists that choice is not pure spontaneity, flourishing independently of material and social conditions. If one cares about autonomy, then one must care about the rest of the form of life that supports it and the material conditions that enable one to live that form of life. Thus the Aristotelian claims that her own comprehensive concern with flourishing across all areas of life is a better way of promoting choice than is</page><page sequence="25">226 POLITICAL THEORY / May 1992 the liberal's narrower concern with spontaneity alone, which sometimes tolerates situations in which individuals are in other ways cut off from the fully human use of their faculties. The Aristotelian conception can indeed be prejudicially applied. It is possible to say all the right things about humanness and then to deny that women or blacks or other minorities fall under the concept. How should the essentialist deal with this problem? First of all, it should be stressed that the fact that a conception can be withheld for reasons of prejudice or lack of love undermines not the conception itself but the person who withholds it. One may, looking at a minority whom one hates, speak of them as beetles or ants, and one may carry this refusal of humanity into the sphere of law and public action. Does this undermine our idea that a conception of the human being is a good basis for moral obligation? It seems to me that it does not. For what such cases reveal is the great power of the conception of the human. Acknowledging this other person as a member of the very same kind would have generated a sense of affiliation and responsibility; this was why the self- deceptive stratagem of splitting the other off from one's own species seemed so urgent and so seductive. And the stratagem of denying humanness to be- ings with whom one lives in conversation and some form of human interac- tion is a fragile sort of self-deceptive tactic, vulnerable to sustained and consistent reflection and also to experiences that cut through self-deceptive rationalization.5" Raul Hilberg, for example, has amassed an impressive amount of evidence concerning the psychology of such denials."2 He argues that whenever circumstances arose that made it possible for the Nazi functionaries, whose actions depended on the denial of humanness to Jews, to sustain this denial in a particular case, what ensued was an emotional "breakthrough," in which action was indeed, at least temporarily, transformed. What were these occa- sions? Times, above all, when it became impossible to avoid the fact that one was interacting with a Jewish prisoner in a human manner: occasions of personal conversation or emotional connection that eluded the watchful protective mechanisms of denial. Thus one can say, I think, that focusing on the importance of the shared human functions makes it harder for prejudicial applications of the conception to take place: if we get clearer about what we are looking for in calling a being human, we will hardly avoid noticing the extent to which we acknowledge such functions, implicitly, in our dealings with others. Any moral conception may be withheld, out of ambition or hatred or shame. But the conception of the human being seems so much more difficult to withhold than other conceptions that have been put forward as the basis</page><page sequence="26">Nussbaum / DEFENSE OF ARISTOTELIAN ESSENTIALISM 227 for ethical obligation. The notion of the "person," for example, has sometimes been preferred to the notion of the human being as a basis for ethics, on the grounds that it is clearly a normative conception, whose connection with certain sorts of ethical obligations is especially evident. I have argued that the conception of the human being is itself, in a certain way, a normative conception, in that it involves singling out certain functions as more basic than others. And there is no getting around the fact that correct application of the concept will involve answering evaluative questions that will some- times be difficult to answer: for a creature falls under the concept only if it possesses some basic, though perhaps altogether undeveloped, capability to perform the functions in question. It will sometimes be very difficult to say whether a certain patient with senile dementia or a certain extremely dam- aged infant has enough of those basic capabilities to fall under the concept. On the other hand, we have far less flexibility in the application of the concept than we do with "person," which has in history been applied and withheld extremely capriciously, more or less as the lawgiver decides to favor one group over another. In Virginia in the 1890s, a woman excluded from the practice of law appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, basing her case on a statute that used the word "person." The Court rejected her case, concluding that it was up to that state "to determine whether the word 'person' is confined to males." In Massachusetts in 1932, women were declared ineligible for jury service, although the law stated that "every person qualified to vote" is eligible. The state supreme court wrote, "No intention to include women can be deduced from the omission of the word male.""3 It is perfectly clear that statutes worded in terms of "human being" would have been far more difficult to evade in this manner. With "person," the defender of equality is on uncertain ground, ground that the opponent can at any moment shift under her feet. With "human being," on the other hand, it is always open to her to say to the opponent, "Look at these beings: you cannot fail to grant that they use their senses, that they think about the future, that they engage in ethical conversation, that they have needs and vulnerabilities similar to your own. Grant this, and you grant that they are human. Grant that they are human, and you grant that they have needs for flourishing that exert a moral pull on anyone who would deny them." As I have said, it is always possible to deny such an appeal, even when looking into the face of a woman with whom one lives and bears children. On the other hand, it is impossible to do so with full and honest and consistent reflection, that is to say, at the conclusion of a fully human process of deliberation. So far, I have focused on the higher-level (developed) human capabilities that make a life a good human life but have not spoken at length about the</page><page sequence="27">228 POLMCAL THEORY / May 1992 empirical basis for the application of the concept "human being" to a creature before us. The basis cannot, of course, be the presence of the higher-level capabilities on my list, for one of the main points of the list is to enable us to say, of some being before us, that this being might possibly come to have these higher-level capabilities but does not now have them. It is that gap between basic (potential) humanness and its full realization that exerts a claim on society and government. What, then, is to be the basis for a determination that this being is one of the human beings, one of the ones whose functioning concerns us? I claim that it is the presence of a lower-level (undeveloped) capability to perform the functions in question, such that with the provision of suitable support and education, the being would be capable of choosing these functions.54 There is, of course, enormous potential for abuse in determining who has these basic capabilities. The history of IQ testing is just one chapter in an inglorious saga of prejudiced capability testing that goes back at least to the Noble Lie of Plato's Republic. Therefore we should, I think, proceed as if every offspring of two human parents has the basic capabilities, unless and until long experience with the individual has convinced us that damage to that individual's condition is so great that it could never in any way, through however great an expenditure of resources, arrive at the higher capability level. (Certain patients with irreversible senile dementia or a permanent vegetative condition would fall into this category, as would certain very severely damaged infants. It would then fall to other moral arguments to decide what treatment we owe to such individuals, who are unable ever to reach the higher capabilities to function humanly. It certainly does not follow that we would be licensed to treat such individuals harshly; we simply would not aim at making them fully capable of the various functions on our list.) Concerning individuals who can profit from education, care, and resources - and I emphasize that in practice this is to be taken to include all individuals, with the very rare exceptions just noted- the Aristotelian view observes that these basic human capabilities exert a claim on society that they should be developed. Human beings are creatures such that, provided with the right educational and material support, they can become capable of the major human functions. When their basic capabilities are depnrved of the nourishment that would transform them into the higher-level capabilities that figure on my list, they are fruitless, cut off, in some way but a shadow of themselves. They are like actors who never get to go on the stage or a musical score that is never performed. The very being of these basic capa- bilities makes forward reference to functioning; thus if functioning never</page><page sequence="28">Nussbaum / DEFENSE OF ARISTOTELIAN ESSENTIALISM 229 arrives on the scene, they are hardly even what they are. This basic intuition underlies the recommendations that the Aristotelian view will make for public action: certain basic and central human powers have a claim to be developed and will exert that claim on others -and especially, as Aristotle held, on government.55 OUR NEED FOR ESSENTIALISM IN PUBLIC POLICY I have said that we urgently need a version of essentialism in public life. If we reject it, we reject guidance that is crucial if we are to construct an adequate account of distributive justice to guide public policy in many areas. It is time for me to substantiate these claims. I shall focus on the area with which I began: the assessment of the "quality of life" in developing countries, with a view to formulating policy, both within each separate country and between one country and another. The general direction of my argument should by now be clear: we cannot tell how a country is doing unless we know how the people in it are able to function in the central human ways. And without an account of the good, however vague, that we take to be shared, we have no adequate basis for saying what is missing from the lives of the poor or marginalized or excluded, no adequate way of justifying the claim that any deeply embedded tradition that we encounter is unjust. Public policy analyses of the quality of life in developing countries often use measures that are extremely crude."6 It is still common to find countries ranked in accordance with their gross national product per capita, even though this measure does not even concern itself with the distribution of resources and thus can give good marks to a country with enormous inequal- ities. Such an approach, furthermore, does not look at all at other human goods that are not reliably correlated with the presence of resources: infant mortality, for example, or access to education, or the quality of racial and gender relations, or the presence or absence of political freedoms. Such an approach might fail to arouse the ire of the antiessentialist because it appears to take no stand on questions of value. But, first of all, it really does take a stand, albeit a perverse one, for it assumes that the presence of more money and resources is the one important determinant of life quality. And second, insofar as it fails to take a stand on other components of the human good, such as freedom, or health, or education, it fails to offer useful guidance to the social scientist seeking to understand how countries are doing or to the policymaker seeking to make things better.</page><page sequence="29">230 POLITICAL THEORY / May 1992 One step up in level of sophistication is an approach that measures the quality of life in terms of utility. This would be done, for example, by polling people about whether they are satisfied with their current health status or their current level of education. This approach at least has the merit of focusing on people and viewing resources as valuable because of what they do in human lives. But its narrow focus on subjective expressions of satisfaction brings with it a number of serious problems. First of all, desires and subjective preference are not always reliable indices of what a person really needs, of what would really be required to make that life a flourishing one. Desires and satisfactions are highly malleable. The rich and pampered easily become accustomed to their luxury and view with pain and frustration a life in which they are treated just like everyone else. The poor and deprived frequently adjust their expectations and aspirations to the low level of life they have known; thus their failure to express dissatisfaction can often be a sign that they really do have enough. This is all the more true when the deprivations in question include deprivation of education and other information about alternative ways of life. Circumstances confine the imagination.57 Thus, if we rely on utility as our measure of life quality, we most often will get results that support the status quo and oppose radical change. A poll of widowers and widows in India showed that the widowers were full of complaint about their health status; the widows, on the other hand, in most cases ranked their health status as "good." On the other hand, a medical examination showed that the widows were actually suffering far more than the males from diseases associated with nutritional deficiency. The point was that they had lived all their lives expecting that women will eat less, and the weakened health status produced in this way was second nature to them. Some years later, after a period of political "consciousness raising," the study was repeated. The utility of the women had gone down, in the sense that they expressed far more dissatisfaction with their health. (Their objective medical situation was pretty much unchanged."8) On the other hand, to the Aristote- lian, this is progress, for their desires and expectations are now more in tune with information about what a flourishing life could be. They know what functioning they are missing. Similar results obtain in the educational sphere - where, once again, polls of women in India asking whether they are satisfied with their educational status usually produce affirmative results, so deep are the cultural forces militating against any change in this area and so little information is there concerning how education has transformed and could transform female lives. Even if this problem were to be removed and the utility theorist were able to operate with a sophisticated view of corrected preferences, the Aristotelian</page><page sequence="30">Nussbaum / DEFENSE OF ARISTOTELIAN ESSENTIALISM 231 would still have a number of serious questions to raise about the whole idea of utility as a basis for public policy. If utility is understood as a single thing, as in some vague sense it usually is, then the theory is implicitly committed to the commensurability of values and to the idea that for any two distinct ends, we can always imagine trade-offs in purely quantitative terms. The Aristotelian is profoundly opposed to this idea. The account that she gives of the basic human functionings shows a rich plurality of distinct items, each of which must be represented in a fully human life. You cannot pay for the absence of one function by using the coin of another."9 Furthermore, the usual pretense of economic utilitarianism - that all this can be modeled by attaching a monetary value to the relevant human functionings -is, to the Aristotelian, especially repellant. The Aristotelian holds that money is merely a tool of human functioning and has value in human life only insofar as it subserves these functionings. More is not always better, and in general, the right amount is what makes functioning best.' To treat the functions themselves as commodities that have a cash value is to treat them as fungible, as alienable from the self for a price; this implicitly denies what the Aristotelian asserts: that we define ourselves in terms of them and that there is no self without them. To treat deep parts of our identity as alienable commodities is to do violence to the conception of the self that we actually have and to the texture of the world of human practice and interaction revealed through this conception. As Marx put it, "Assume the human being to be the human being and its relation to the world to be a human one, then you can exchange love only for love, trust for trust, etc.""6' Finally, utilitarianism, neglecting as it does the inalienability of certain elements of the self, neglects also the ethical salience of the boundaries between persons. As a theory of public measurement, utilitarianism is com- mitted to the aggregation of satisfactions. Individuals are treated as centers of pleasure or pain, satisfaction or dissatisfaction, and the fact of their separateness one from another is not given special weight in the theory, which proceeds by summing. But in the world we actually inhabit, it is a highly relevant fact that my pain is not yours, nor yours mine. If trade-offs between functions are problematic where a single life is concerned, they are all the more problematic when they cross the boundaries of lives, purchasing one person's satisfaction at the price of another's misery. It is easy to see what consequences this can have for policy. For the utilitarian is frequently willing to tolerate huge inequalities for the sake of a larger total or average sum. The Aristotelian's fundamental commitment, by contrast, is to bring each and every person across the threshhold into capability for good functioning. This means devoting resources to getting everyone across before any more is given</page><page sequence="31">232 POLMCAL THEORY / May 1992 to those who are already capable of functioning at some basic level. If all cannot be brought across the threshhold, to this extent the ends of public policy have not been met. The local tradition relativism endorsed in my Helsinki examples claims to be different from prevailing economic-utilitarian views, on account of its close attention to the fabric of daily life in traditional societies. But it actually shares many of the defects of the utilitarian view, for it refuses to subject preferences, as formed in traditional societies, to any sort of critical scrutiny. It seems to assume that all criticism must be a form of imperialism, the imposition of an outsider's power on local ways. Nor does it simply claim (as do utilitarian economists) to avoid normative judgments altogether, for it actually endorses the locally formed norms as good and even romanticizes them in no small degree. It confers a bogus air of legitimacy on these deeply embedded preferences by refusing to subject them to ethical scrutiny. So far as my other objections to utilitarianism go, it does not really avoid them either, for if some local tradition wishes to treat all values as commensurable or to commodify parts of the self (or even as often happens, whole women), the "embedded" view (associated with writers like S. A. and F. A. Marglin) must accept this result and accept it as good. The concrete consequences of this emerge clearly from the conclusions of their volume, for they end by rejecting most of what is usually called "development" -that is, most agri- cultural, technological, and economic change and most educational change as well - and supporting as good ways of life in which it is unlikely that they would themselves wish to dwell for more than a brief period of time, es- pecially as a woman. One may sympathize with some of the Marglins' goals - respect for diversity, desire to protect from exploitation ways of life that seem to be rich in spiritual and artistic value -without agreeing that extreme relativism of the sort they defend is the best way to articulate and pursue these goals. One more antiessentialist approach to questions of distributive justice must now be considered. It is by far the most powerful alternative to the Aristotelian approach, and its differences from it are subtle and complex. This is the liberal idea, defended in different forms by John Rawls and Ronald Dworkin, that distribution should aim at an equal allotment of certain basic resources (or, in the case of Rawls, should tolerate inequalities only where this would improve the situation of the worst off).62 The Rawlsian liberal insists on distributing basic resources without tak- ing a stand on the human good, even in the vague way in which the "thick vague theory" has done so. The aim is to leave to each citizen a choice of the conception of the good by which he or she will live. As we have said, Rawls</page><page sequence="32">Nussbaum / DEFENSE OF ARISTOTELIAN ESSENTIALISM 233 does take a stand on some of the components of our conception. For sociability and practical reason are treated as essential to any conception of human flourishing that can be entertained; liberty is on the list of "primary goods" as are the "social conditions of self-respect"; and in argument against utilitarianism, Rawls commits himself very strongly to the centrality of the separateness of persons.63 On the other hand, as we have seen, the Aristotelian conception does itself insist on the fundamental role of choice and autonomy. But there are still significant differences between the two conceptions, for the Rawlsian view treats income and wealth as "primary goods" of which more is always better, independently of the concrete conception of the good. And he does define the "better off" and "worse off" in terms of quantities of these basic resources rather than in terms of functioning or capability. To this, the Aristotelian has three replies. First, as we have said, wealth and income are not good in their own right; they are good only insofar as they promote human functioning. Rawls's view, which appears to treat them as having independent significance, obscures the role that they actually play in human life. Second, human beings have variable needs for resources, and any ade- quate definition of the better off and worse off must reflect that fact. A pregnant woman has nutritional needs that are different from those of a nonpregnant woman and a child from those of an adult. The child who has exactly the same amount of protein in her diet as an adult is less well off, given her greater needs. A person whose mobility is impaired will need a sig- nificantly greater amount of resources than will a person of average mobility in order to achieve the same level of capability to move about. These are not just rare exceptions; they are pervasive facts of life. Thus the failure of the liberal theory to deal with them is a serious defect. And yet, to deal with them, we need a general conception of what functions we are trying to support."M Third, the liberal, by defining being well-off in terms of possessions alone, fails to go deep enough in imagining the impediments to functioning that are actually present in many human lives. Marx argued, for example, that workers who lack control over their own activity and its products lead lives less than fully human, even if they do get adequate wages. In general, the structure of labor relations, of class relations, and of race and gender relations in a society can alienate its members from the fully human use of their faculties even when their material needs are met. It is possible to hold that a pampered middle-class housewife is well off, despite the barriers that prevent her from expressing herself fully in employment and education. What is very unclear is whether Rawls -who does indeed decide to postpone consider- ation of structures of power within the household - should allow himself to</page><page sequence="33">234 POLITICAL THEORY / May 1992 be in this position, given his commitment to the realization of the two moral powers for each and every citizen. At the very least, there is a tension internal to the view, which can be dispelled only by a more explicit consideration of the relationship between the two moral powers and various other human functions and their material and institutional necessary conditions.' With political liberty, Rawls fully seizes this problem; therefore he places liberty among the primary goods. My claim is that he needs to go further in this direction, making the list of primary goods not a list of resources and commodities at all but a list of basic capabilities of the person. The political and economic alternative to these various antiessentialist views does exist and is in use in a variety of areas. In development economics, a position strikingly similar to the Aristotelian position has been developed by economist-philosopher Amartya Sen. Arguing that the focus of develop- ment analysis should be on human capabilities rather than on opulence or utility or resources, he has proposed ways of assessing the quality of life in developing countries that begin from a list of interrelated capabilities. His arguments for this approach and against others are closely related to the arguments of this essay. Other related approaches have been worked out by Scandinavian social scientists, by doctors measuring patients' quality of life, by teachers in a troubled society interested in laying a foundation for the peaceful resolution of conflict.6' Now I return to the antiessentialist stories with which I began, showing how the Aristotelian view would handle them. The case of smallpox vacci- nation is relatively clear-cut. The Aristotelian, while not wishing to interfere with the capability of citizens to use their imaginations and their senses for the purposes of religious expression should they choose to do so, would certainly make bodily health a top priority and would not be deterred in a program of smallpox vaccination by the likelihood that it would eradicate the cult of Sittala Devi. The Aristotelian would introduce the vaccination scheme and then leave it to the citizens to see whether they wished to continue their relationship with that goddess. Nothing would prevent them from doing so, but if they ceased to see the point in the observances, once the disease had been eradicated, the Aristotelian would weep no nostalgic tears. As for freedom and the Japanese husband, the Aristotelian will simply remind the objector of what she means by freedom, which is the power to form a conception of the good and to select action toward its realization. She will point out that in that sense of freedom, the Japanese husband in the example has (and no doubt values) freedom; his freedom, indeed, is enhanced by having someone who will look after boring details of life. But if the freedom of one person requires pushing someone else below the threshhold</page><page sequence="34">Nussbaum / DEFENSE OF ARISTOTELIAN ESSENTLALISM 235 of capability to exercise practical reason, the Aristotelian will call this injustice and exploitation, and will not rest content until a searching exami- nation of gender relations in this case has shown to what extent the capabil- ities of women are in fact being undercut in the name of male leisure. As for menstruation taboos, they look like a clear restriction on women's power to execute a plan of life that they have chosen. This is so even if, as is sometimes claimed, such taboos end up giving women more rest and a little more pleasure than they would have had if they were working; for trade-offs that diminish the power of choice, even when they result in greater comfort, are not supported by the Aristotelian view. To conclude this part of my argument, I would now like to examine a case that is more complicated and problematic than the ones I have just treated rather briefly. This case will dramatize the difference between the Aristote- lian approach and its rivals in the development sphere, and will also indicate how the Aristotelian proposes to balance sensitivity to local tradition against her commitment to a theory of the human being. The case concerns a literacy campaign directed at women in rural Bangladesh. It is described in Marty Chen's excellent book, A Quiet Revolution: Women in Transition in Rural Bangladesh.6" The women in the village in which Chen worked had low status in every area, in terms of our account of human functioning. They were less well nourished than males, less educated, less free, and less respected. Let us now consider their situation with respect to just one question: the question of literacy. As I have said, polls based on the idea of utility typically show, in this and related cases, that women have no desire for a higher rate of literacy. The poll is taken; women express satisfaction; no action follows. This, of course, is not surprising, given the weight of the cultural forces pressing these women not to demand more education (and also not to feel that they want more) given, as well, the absence in their daily lives of paradigms of what education could do and be in lives similar to theirs. The development agency with which Chen was working went into the village holding firmly to the conviction that literacy was an important basic good. At first, they tried a liberal approach, based on the distribution of resources: in cooperation with the local government, they handed out to the women of the village ample adult literacy materials, taking no stand on whether they should choose to use them. (Notice that already this approach is not really a liberal approach, in that it takes a stand on the importance of education, giving these women literacy materials rather than cash. It is also not a pure liberal approach because it singled out the women of the village, recognizing their special impediments to functioning as giving them a greater</page><page sequence="35">236 POLMCAL THEORY / May 1992 claim on resources.) The distribution had little impact on women's function- ing. This was so because the development people made no attempt to perceive the women's lives in a broad or deep way or to ask what role literacy might play in those lives and what strategies of education were most suited for their particular case. Perhaps even more important, they did not ask the women to tell their own story. The liberal project had failed. Yet the development workers did not simply drop their general conception of the good, concluding that local traditions should in each case be the arbiter of value and that belief in their own way was bound to be paternalistic. Instead, they made a transition to a more Aristotelian approach. Over a period of several years, they set up women's cooperatives in which members of the development agency joined with the local women in a searching participatory dialogue concerning the whole form of life in the village. They discussed with the women the role that literacy was currently playing in the lives of women elsewhere, showing concrete examples of transformations in empowerment and self-respect. The women, in turn, told them their own story of the special impediments to education that their traditions had given them. The result, over time, was a gradual but deep transformation in the entire shape of the women's lives. Once literacy was perceived not as a separate and highly general thing but as a skill that might be deployed in particular ways in their particular context, it became of enormous interest and led to many changes in women's lives. For example, women were able to take over the tailoring industry in the village as well as other similar functions. In this way, they began to earn wages outside the home, a circumstance that has been shown to give women a stronger claim to food and medical care when resources are scarce. On the other hand, none of these concrete transformations could have happened had the women of the development agency not held fast to their general conception, showing the women its many other concrete realizations, and proceeding with confidence that it did have some concrete realization in these particular lives. Essential- ism and particular perception were not opposed: they were complementary aspects of a single process of deliberation. Had the women not been seen as human beings who shared with the other women a common humanity, the local women could not have told their story in the way they did, nor could the development workers have brought their own experiences of feminism to the participatory dialogue as if they had some relevance for the local women. The very structure of the dialogue presupposed the recognition of common humanity, and it was only with this basis securely established that they could fruitfully explore the concrete circumstances in which they were</page><page sequence="36">Nussbaum / DEFENSE OF ARISTOTELIAN ESSENTIALISM 237 trying, in the one case, to live and in the other case, to promote flourishing human lives. COMPASSION AND RESPECT A new dimension of our question emerges if we now ask ourselves what moral sentiments we are encouraged and permitted to have by antiessentialist subjectivism, on one hand, or by Aristotelian essentialism, on the other. I now argue that two moral sentiments that we take to be particularly important for the human community can have their home only within a view that recog- nizes a determinate conception of the human being. Insofar as relativist and subjectivist views appear to incorporate them, they do so only by being partially or tacitly essentialist. These two sentiments are compassion and respect.' Eleos, pity or compassion, is, according to ancient Greek analyses that are still unsurpassed, a painful emotion felt toward the pain or suffering of another person. It has three cognitive requirements: first, the belief that the suffering is not trivial but serious; second, the belief that the person who is suffering did not cause the suffering by deliberate fault; third, the belief that one's own possibilities are similar to those of the person suffering. It involves, then, in its very structure, the injunction to recognize common human limits and vulnerabilities; and the plausible claim is that the person who does not recognize him- or herself as sharing a common humanity with the sufferer will react to the suffering with an arrogant hardness, rather than with compassion. This structure is built into many literary and historical situations in which people appeal to others for compassion: and in such situations we see that the response that acknowledges shared possibilities is a humane response, closely connected with beneficent action. Consider two archetypal cases from Homer. Priam comes to Achilles to ask for the return of the body of his son. He knows that in order to move Achilles to compassion, he must first move him to fellow feeling. This will not be easy to do, since Achilles, as a Greek, is accustomed to separating himself, in imagination, from the Trojans; as a hero, he is accustomed to separating himself from vulnerable and suffering people of all sorts. Priam's strategy is to ask Achilles to consider his own father, who is probably suffering in some of the ways in which Priam is suffering. Achilles, who might not have yielded so easily to a reminder of his own personal vulnera- bility, does yield at the thought of his father:</page><page sequence="37">238 POLITICAL THEORY / May 1992 So he spoke, and stirred in the other a passion of grieving for his own father. He took the old man's hand and pushed him gently away, and the two remembered, as Priam sat huddled at the feet of Achilleus and wept close for manslaughtering Hektor and Achilleus wept now for his own father, now again for Patroklos. The sound of their mourning moved in the house. (24.503-12, tr. Lattimore) Through Priam's appeal, Achilles arrives at a new understanding of the shared vulnerabilities of human beings and becomes able to think of his enemy as a human being like himself. Only this makes possible (indeed, it goes to constitute) his emotion of compassion, which prompts the return of the corpse, the cease-fire, the dignity of the public funeral. In the Odyssey, things happen otherwise. Odysseus appears in his own home disguised as a beggar. He tests the character of the suitors by seeing whether they will respond to an appeal to their compassion, giving the beggar some food from their table. He reminds Antinoos that all human beings face similar possibilities in life: the one who was rich may soon be poor. In the light of this, he says, you should sympathize with my plight and give to me. Then Antinoos answered him in turn, and said to him: "What spirit brought this pain upon us, to spoil our feasting? Stand off, so, in the middle, and keep away from my table." (17.445-47, tr. Lattimore) To Antinoos, the beggar is only a stranger, a useless "pain." He refuses to recognize in him a common set of human powers and vulnerabilities. The result is a failure of compassion and a failure in justice. This link between compassion and the recognition of the common be- comes the central starting point of Rosseau's account of social morality in the Emile. Drawing on this classical tradition,69 he argues that Emile will be a good and just citizen only if, from an early age, he leams to understand the possibility of suffering and understands that it is a possibility he shares with all human beings. Compassion requires the recognition of a shared humanity; without compassion (pitie'), we have no reason not to be harsh and tyrannical to those who are weaker. Why are kings without pity for their subjects? It is because they count on never being human beings. Why are the rich so harsh to the poor? It is because they do not have fear of becoming poor. Why does a noble have such contempt for a peasant? It is because he never will be a peasant. It is the weakness of the human being that makes it sociable, it is our common sufferings that carry our hearts to humanity; we would owe it nothing if we were not humans.</page><page sequence="38">Nussbaum / DEFENSE OF ARISTOTELIAN ESSENTIALISM 239 Accordingly, the young Emile, who does not yet identify with the pain of others, is to be given lessons in common humanity. "Make him understand clearly," the teacher is told, "that the fate of the unhappy can be his own, that all their ills are beneath his feet, that a thousand unforeseen and unavoidable events can plunge him into those ills at every moment." I claim that the ancient Greek tradition and Rousseau are right: compas- sion does require the belief in a common humanity. We do not grasp the significance of suffering or lack or impediment unless and until we set it in the context of a view of what it is for a human being to flourish. And we do not respond compassionately to that gap between norm and fulfillment un- less we think that this is a possibility in which we too partake. Compassion requires us to say: however far these people are from us in fortune or class or race or gender, those differences are morally arbitrary and might have befallen me as well. And if we are not in a position to say that, it is not at all clear on what grounds we can be persuaded to give to these people. Like Antinoos - who cannot make sense of the beggar's suffering but views it as an alien incursion -we will lack a framework that is necessary if we are to make sense of the pain of others and to be moved to relieve it. There is a deep moral tradition that says that compassion is not required, for we can be sufficiently motivated to other-regarding action by respect for the dignity of humanity. This tradition, exemplified in the thought of the ancient Stoics, Spinoza, Kant, and in a different way, Nietzsche, still makes central use of a notion of common humanity, for respect is not groundless or arbitrary. It has a foundation: the recognition in the object of certain powers or capabilities. Usually, these are taken to be specifically human powers- although one might motivate respect from a broader notion of the animal or, on the other hand, from notions of the rational being or the person that might be narrower in their application. For Kant, respect is due to humanity; a basic moral principle is to treat humanity, wherever it is found, as an end in itself. For the ancient Stoics similarly, respect is owed to that which is recognized as a human being, having certain powers and capabilities. One needs to have an account of what those powers and capabilities are, and it had better be an account that links many times and places together. Otherwise, we will have no moral motive for other-regarding action toward people at a distance or toward people of other races and genders. I have suggested that without a notion of common human functioning, we will have to do without compassion and without a full-blooded notion of respect. What, by contrast, are the moral sentiments of extreme relativism? Here, we must say, I believe, that most relativists are not fully consistent.</page><page sequence="39">240 POLITICAL THEORY / May 1992 Insofar as they do show for human life everywhere a concern that they do not show for rocks or stones, or even, in the same way, for all animals, they trade tacitly on beliefs and related sentiments that their official view does not allow them. Some utilitarians, especially those intensely concerned with animal rights, really are willing to jettison the species boundary in favor of a broader generic notion of concern for all creatures capable of the experience of pleasure and pain; some pursue this goal with reasonable consistency. But we must say, I think, that even that view attains what coherence and power it has by being essentialist at the generic level. It is certainly very far from being a subjectivist view. And, unlike these thinkers, most alleged subjectivists cheat. They commend their view to us on the grounds of compassion, saying that it will help the situation of the excluded, of minori- ties, and of women. Yet the theoretical apparatus they then introduce is insufficient to make sense of that very compassion. It permits only narrow, self-regarding sentiments and a relatively detached and curious attitude to the situation of others. Even when subjectivism has moderated itself into local tradition relativ- ism, as in the examples given in my Helsinki conversations, its range of moral sentiments seems narrow indeed. How quaint, these theorists seem to be saying, how curious. They do not appear to be able to delve very deeply into the lives in question, imagining for themselves what it really is like to be told that you cannot work when you have your period or that you must pray to a terrifying goddess to avert a life-threatening disease. There is both distance and a certain condescension in this refusal of imagination and acknowledg- ment. But anything more would require the admission that it is relevant to ask themselves how they would feel in that situation. And this their theory forbids them to do. That menstrual period and that work they must treat as something different in kind (or at least not the same in kind) as the comparable elements in their own lives. It is not surprising, then, that they do not think of the pain of exclusion as something that might be their own or see its significance in and for a life that could have been their own. The moral sentiments of this sort of relativism, I claim, are the sentiments of the tourist: wonder, curiosity, and amused interest. But the pain of the stranger is seen as pain only if its significance is understood as that of pain: as similar, then, to the pain that we know. And it is only in the light of such an acknowledg- ment that wonder turns to grief, curiosity to practical determination, and amused interest to compassion. In Marty Chen's work, by contrast, we see compassion operating at a very basic level, motivating the choice of methods and procedures; compassion here is guided by a general, though not dogmatic, conception of human</page><page sequence="40">Nussbaum / DEFENSE OF ARISTOTELIAN ESSENTIALISM 241 flourishing. We see that such compassionate identification need not ignore concrete local differences; in fact, at its best, it demands a searching analysis of differences in order that the general good be appropriately realized in the new concrete case. But the learning about and from the other is motivated as it is in Aristotle's own studies of other cultures: by the conviction that the other is one of us. Somewhere in the vast reaches of literary-theoretical space, there is a planet known as Textualite. Its inhabitants look very much like human beings -except that they are very large and each one has only a single eye. Their mythology reports that they are the descendents of some emigrants from Earth, who fled that planet in search of a home where they could escape patriarchal authority and binary thinking to take delight in the free play of difference, utility, and power. There are on Textualite many nations. Some are rich and some are very poor. Within most of the nations, there are also large inequalities that have perceptible effects on the health and mobility and educational level of the inhabitants. The people of Textualite, however, do not see such things as we see them. For they really have discarded -not just in theory but in the fabric of their daily lives - the Earthly tendencies of thought that link the perception of one's neighbor's pain to the memory of one's own and the perception of a stranger's pain to the experience of a neighbor's, all this through the general idea of the human being and human flourishing. To these people, strangers simply look very strange. They are seen as other forms of life, who have nothing in common with their own lives. Occasionally they share perceptions and ideas with a few other beings in locally bounded communities that establish group norms. At other times, each one goes out after his or her own utility or power, treating every other being as foreign. Do the people of Textualite feel pain when they see a stranger who is hungry or ill or abused? They do dislike the sight of such ugly things. But they do not feel the pain of fellow-feeling, for that has been declared a remnant of outmoded Earthly thinking. How should we know, they say, that this being is suffering from lack of food? For that is a different form of life from ours, and we have been brought up to appreciate the play of difference. Saying this, they go on with their play and turn away their eyes. Do the people of Textualite construct government programs to improve literacy or health care or agriculture in the distant poorer regions of their planet? Why, indeed,</page><page sequence="41">242 POLITICAL THEORY / May 1992 should they? Doing so is unlikely to maximize their own expected utility, and they cannot bring themselves to make any judgment about the form of life in a strange part of the globe, about people with whom they could never be in conversation. Perhaps those inhabitants are enjoying their embedded way of life, they remark at conferences. Do the people of Textualite feel love for one another? Or isn't love of one's fellow humans one of those shopworn essentialist ideals that they left behind on Earth? We do not live right now on the planet of Textualite. Right now, the new subjectivism -whether in economics or in literary theory - is false of our experiences and responses. But we can choose to follow theory into our lives, focusing on our differences from one another and refusing to acknowledge what is common to all. And then perhaps one day, the texture of the human world will be differently perceived, perceived through the play of difference and strangeness. Then we will, I think, not be human beings any longer. NOTES 1.

Because of such pervasive assumptions, in general I have not used the vocabulary of "essentialism" in describing my own (historically embedded and historically sensitive) account of the central human functions. I do so here, somewhat polemically, in order to reclaim the word for reasoned debate, and I assume that the reader will look closely at my account of what the "es- sentialism" I recommend, in fact, entails. For further comments on this, see HN, ASC, and HC. 7. It is important to note at the outset that my account of an Aristotelian position is very different from other accounts of Aristotle that are well known in current political thought-in particular, both from the Aristotle that is criticized in Bernard Williams's Ethics and the Limits of Philosophy (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1985), and from the Aristotle of Alasdair MacIntyre's Whose Justice? Which Rationality? (Notre Dame, IN: University of Notre Dame Press, 1988). I discuss William's Aristotle in HN, Maclntyre's in a review in The New York Review of Books, December 7, 1989. 8. Much the same has been true of at least some of the opponents of relativist "antiessential- ism," who speak of relativism as the source of all modern evil, without saying how they themselves would answer relativist arguments. See, for example, my criticisms of Allan Bloom's The Closing of the American Mind (New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1987) in "Undemocratic Vistas," The New York Review of Books, November 5, 1987. 9. Jacques Derrida, Of Grammatology, translated by G. C. Spivak (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1977). 10. For my account of Aristotle's position, see The Fragility of Goodness: Luck and Ethics in Greek Tragedy and Philosophy (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1986), chap. 8. Related debates in Indian philosophy are given a most illuminating discussion in B. K. Matilal, Perception (Oxford: Clarendon, 1985). 11. In two areas above all, the argument familiar in the literature of deconstruction have gaps: they do not confront debates within the philosophy of science- for example, concerning the interpretation of quantum mechanics -that have great importance for the realism question, and they rarely confront in a detailed way the issues concerning reference and translation that have been debated with considerable subtlety within the philosophy of language. 12. In this category, as close relatives of my view, I would place the "internal-realist" conception of Hilary Putnam, Reason, Truth and History (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1981), The Many Faces of Realism (La Salle: Open Court, 1987), and Realism With a Human Face (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1990); and also Charles Taylor, Sources of the Self: TheMaking ofModern Identity (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1989). For my discussion of Taylor's arguments, see New Republic, April 1990. 13. See esp. John Rawls, A Theory of Justice (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1971). Rawls's position and its relationship to the Aristotelian view is discussed in NFC, in HC, and especially in ASD, with references to other later articles in which Rawls has further developed his position concerning the role of a conception of the good in his theory. 14. By relativism I mean the view that the only available standard to value is some local group or individual; by subjectivism I mean the view that the standard is given by each individual's subjective preferences; thus relativism, as I understand it here, is a genus of which subjectivism is one extreme species. 15. A clear example of this view is Stanley Fish: see Doing What Come Naturally: Change, Rhetoric, and the Practice of Theory and Legal Studies (Durham and London: Duke University Press, 1989). I criticized Fish's position in "Sophistry About Conventions," in Love's Knowl- edge: Essays on Philosophy and Literature (New York: Oxford University Press, 1990), 220-29, and in "Skepticism About Practical Reason," a Dewey Lecture delivered at the Harvard University Law School, October 1991, and forthcoming.</page><page sequence="43">244 POLITICAL THEORY / May 1992 16. This is the position that Derrida appeared to take up in a number of works-for example, in tp*rons: Les styles deNietzsche (Paris 1979); he has more recently insisted that his position does leave room for one view to be better than another, see his Afterword to Limited Inc., translated by Samuel Weber and Jeffrey Mehlmann (Evanston, IL: Northwestern University Press, 1988). Certainly, the former position is the one frequently found in the writings of followers of Derrida in literary theory and criticism. 17. I discuss the parallels to ancient skepticism in detail in "Skepticism About Practical Reason"; see also my "Therapeutic Arguments in Ancient Skepticism," Journal of the History of Philosophy (Fall 1991). 18. S. A. Marglin (pp. 22-23) suggests that this sort of thinking is peculiarly Western. My (entirely typical) epigraphs from non-Western traditions already cast doubt on this. Opponents of such oppositions have not explained how one can speak coherently without bounding off one thing against another, opposing one thing to another. 19.

Bork hereafter refers approvingly to the arguments of Alasdair Maclntyre's After Virtue. 21. Bork, 252, 258. 22. P. 257. Bork denies that he is either a relativist or a skeptic-on the grounds that he himself has moral convictions and lives by them (p. 259). But this fact is, of course, not at all incompatible with relativism, since he at the same time denies that good reasons can be given to others for these convictions. The fact that Allan Bloom has warmly endorsed this book (p. i) is one of the striking anomalies of the current political/intellectual scene. 23. P. 258: "Knowledge that it is taking place and that the state makes no attempt to inhibit it causes those in the majority moral anguish and so impairs their gratifications." 24. On p. 258, Bork suggests that the unavailability of an "objectively 'correct' hierarchy" of moral principles in nature implies the subjectivist result. Unless there is such a hierarchy, he says, "the judge must let the majority have its way. There is, however, no principled way to make the necessary distinctions. Why is sexual gratification more worthy than moral gratification? . . . There is no way to decide these questions other than by reference to some system of moral or ethical principles about which people can and do disagree. Because we disagree, we put such issues to a vote." 25. Barbara Hermstein Smith, Contingencies of Value: Alternative Perspectives for Critical Theory (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1988). 1 discuss her position further in "Skepticism About Practical Reason." 26. This same suggestion is made by Fish in "Anti-Professionalism," in Doing What Comes Naturally. 27. See esp. 191-92, n. 6, where she praises the Stigler-Becker article "De Gustibus non est disputandum,"American Economics Review 67 (1977): 76-90, which argues that differences in behavior and judgment are best explained along economic lines, with the assumption that we behave so as to maximize utility.

See esp. chaps. 6 and 7, where Smith seems to hold that utilitarianism of the economic variety is the only available alternative to a view that bases value judgments on appeal to tran- scendent authority. The rejection of Chicago School economics is tantamount to the endorse- ment of the "entire - dualistic- conception of the universe that defines humanistic redemption- ism and that grounds its belief in, and promises of, an ultimate deliverance from all economy." 31.

Aristotle notes that anyone who has this shame about looking at the animal world is bound to take up the same attitude to himself, since an animal is what he is. 32. See esp.

From the debate about the adequacy of economic utilitarianism is a basis for legal judgment, see Margaret Jane Radin's outstanding article, "Market-Inalienability," HarvardLaw Review 100 (1987) 1848ff., which criticizes Richard Posner for speaking of a woman's body as a commodity of which she may dispose in the market. 62.

See also Chen, "A Matter of Survival: Women's Right to Work in India and Bangladesh," forthcoming in Nussbaum and Glover, eds., Human Capabilities. 68. I discuss compassion further in "Tragedy and Self-Sufficiency: Plato and Aristotle on Fear and Pity," in Essays on Aristotle's Poetics, edited by A. Rorty (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1992), and in a longer version in Oxford Studies in Ancient Philosophy 10 (1992). Here I use "compassion" rather than the more usual "pity" for both Greek eleos and French pitie because "pity" in contemporary use often connotes a condescension toward the sufferer and a lofty distance. These attitudes are not only not implied but are actually repudiated in the accounts standardly given of the original Greek and French words. 69. The epigraph to the section of Book 4 that discusses pity is taken from Virgil's Aeneid: "Not inexperienced in hardships, I learn how to bring aid to the wretched." The entire discussion owes an obvious debt to classical sources, as does the corresponding discussion in the Discourse. All translations of Rousseau's French are my own. Martha C. Nussbaum teaches philosophy and classics atBrown University and is author of several books, most recently Love's Knowledge: Essays on Philosophy and Literature.</page></plain_text>
