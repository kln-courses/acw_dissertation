<plain_text><page sequence="1">"Chaplain to the Hunters": Henry David Thoreau's Ambivalence Toward Hunting THOMAS L. ALTHERR Metropolitan State College DECOUNTING his participation in an i 853 moose hunt in Maine, IL~ Henry David Thoreau wrote, "I went as reporter or chaplain to the hunters,-and the chaplain has been known to carry a gun himself.' To persons convinced that Thoreau was a vegetarian or at least an anti-hunter, that statement comes as a shock. Since his death in i 862, the popular and, to some extent, the scholarly estimate of Thoreau has described his penchant for wildness as bloodless, innocent, devoid of death-dealing acts. A distortion of his environmental thought has ensued, a misreading most unfor- tunate, because his work has been central to much later environ- mental theory and perception.2 In conscripting Thoreau for the fight against hunting, anti-hunters have paid attention to only half of his pronouncements on the matter. Actually he hunted occa- sionally, and he alternately praised hunting and preached against it. Throughout his intense preoccupation with nature and wildness, Thoreau was ambivalent about hunting and hunters in America. His published works and private journals reflect much intellectual anguish over the question of killing animals and much elation about that killing as an affirmation of man's connections to nature. A close look at his writings, particularly the journals, reveals that hunting, for Thoreau, was an earthly endeavor fraught with spiritual potential, an activity which both stimulated and disturbed his moral notions about environmental confrontation between man and animal.

In the first couple of decades after his death, Emerson and other literary men depicted him as a latter-day Saint Francis of Assisi, who neither killed nor ate animals.3 Near the turn of the century, wildlife preservation groups followed Emerson and abstracted from Thoreau's thought some support for anti- hunting drives.4 The famous English humanitarian, Henry S. Salt, claimed in his biography that "humanity to animals was one of the most conspicuous virtues in Thoreau's character," that he was a vegetarian for the "greater part of his life."5 In recent times, ecologists, pantheists, pacifists, wildlife preservation clubs, and other environmental activists, most of whom have been non-hunters or anti-hunters, have adopted Thoreau as the patron saint of their causes.6 Until recently, moreover, scholars have been slow to chal- 3 See Emerson's essay, "Thoreau," written shortly after Thoreau's death, Atlantic Monthly, I0 (i 862), 239-49, or one of its several reprintings.

I3. 5 Life of Henry David Thoreau (London: Walter Scott, I 896), pp. I 66-67. The issue of Thoreau's vegetarianism remains problematic. He made very strong pronounce- ments in favor of a meatless diet, especially in Walden, and several writers have assumed that he was indeed a vegetarian. See Roy Walker, "The Natural Life: Henry David Thoreau," Vegetarian News, 26 (Spring I948), 3-8. Yet there are plenty of instances in his writings where Thoreau referred to his own eating of meat and, perhaps self mockingly, his taste for the wild and savage. As enamored as he was of the Hindu doctrines of The Laws or Institutes of Menu, which argued forcefully that slaughter and eating of animals prevented humanity from attaining the good, Thoreau made no mention of these dietary prescriptions in his essay, "The Laws of Menu," Dial, 3 (i 843), 33 I-40. See Kenneth A. Robinson, Thoreau and the Wild Appetite (Thoreau Society Bulletin # I2, I957), pp. I I-I2. Perhaps Thoreau's vegetarian convictions had not yet hardened in I 843, or perhaps they never became rigid. Perhaps Joseph Wood Krutch phrased it best in his biography, Henry David Thoreau (New York: William Sloane, I 948), p. 2 0 I: "This ascetic tendency which, combined with his sympathy for the members of the animal family, produced the persistent, uneasy approval of the vegetarianism he never practiced for long with absolute consistency." 6 Philip and Kathryn Whitford, "Thoreau: Pioneer Ecologist and Conservationist," Scientific Monthly, 73 (I95 I), 29I-96; for more popular versions of this view, recall the various Sierra Club posters and photography books, or see The Illustrated World of Thoreau, ed. Howard Chapnick (New York: Grosset &amp; Dunlap, I974). These sources, as well as most of the biographies, have given little indication that Thoreau was aware of the hunting in his vicinity.</page><page sequence="3">Thoreau's Ambivalence Toward Hunting 347 lenge this rather incomplete understanding of his environmental thought.7 The main source of inspiration for this viewpoint has been the "Higher Laws" chapter in Walden. In the course of several pages, Thoreau managed to defend, recommend, and denigrate hunting and to propose vegetarianism as a worthy alternative. For Thoreau hunting was a necessary introduction to nature, but the finer in- stincts of the poet-naturalist must supplant baser emotions and an ascetic, fleshless diet must replace one of flesh. Yet he seemed hardly convinced by his own argument; he backslid into feelings of "strange abandonment" in which he felt tempted to seize and devour a woodchuck raw. For the most part, Walden seemed to declare against hunting, but Thoreau's reminders that there had been periods in history when the "best men" were hunters clouded the seeming clarity of the anti-hunting message.8 Other published works, such as The Maine Woods, evoke the same sort of ambi- guity. He found the moose-hunting repulsive, as the following passage shows, but he did not refrain from eating the moose's meat: But on more accounts than one I had had enough of moose-hunting. I had not come to the woods for this purpose, nor had I foreseen it, though I had been willing to learn how the Indian manoeuvred; but one moose killed was as good, if not as bad, as a dozen. The afternoon's tragedy, and my share in it, as it affected the innocence, destroyed the pleasure of my adventure. It is true, I came as near to being a hunter and miss it, as possible myself, and as it is, I think that I could spend a year in the woods fishing and hunting just enough to sustain myself, with sat- isfaction. This would be next to living like a philosopher on the fruits of the earth which you had raised, which also attracts me. But this hunting of the moose merely for the satisfaction of killing him-not even for the sake of his hide, without making any extraordinary exertion or running any risk yourself, is too much like going out by night to some woodside pasture and shooting your neighbor's horses. These are God's own horses, poor timid creatures. . . . (MW, pp. I I8-I9) 7 A few scholars have questioned the traditional interpretation of Thoreau as the "natural innocent." See James McIntosh, Thoreau as Romantic Naturalist: His Shifting Stance Toward Nature (Ithaca: Cornell Univ. Press, I974), passim, and Richard Bridg- man, Dark Thoreau (Lincoln: Univ. of Nebraska Press, I982), especially pp. Io8- I6.

Press, I97I), pp. 2IO-I2.</page><page sequence="4">348 American Literature Yet Thoreau had allowed his curiosity to overcome his compunc- tions. He had gone with the hunters, watched the tracking and killing with the detachment of an expert, and offered his usual torrent of scientific speculation. After the kill, he had helped drag the dead moose from the stream and had begun measuring the beast. That night he supped on fried moosemeat, which he found tasted "like tender beef, with perhaps more flavor; sometimes like veal" (MW, p. I I 7). Students of Thoreau have mostly forgotten or ignored his savorings of freshly-killed meat. Published literary works pose a problem for the intellectual historian, raise the old question of art versus life. Thoreau's playful metaphors and serious polemics compound the problem of inter- pretation. Which attracted Thoreau more, the impulse of savagism, or the one of spirituality, or paradoxically did both appeal equally to him? Literature thrives on such ambiguity, and it is tempting to suggest that Thoreau's vacillation about hunting is simply the product of his artful strategies. Yet Thoreau left records of his less artful thought, journals of his private speculations. Although schol- ars disagree on the immediacy of his journal jottings, they valuably display his persistent ambivalence about hunting.9 In these "con- versations with himself" over the years, he continually reassessed his opinions about various local hunters and their bloody deeds. The journals show that far from shrinking away from the hunting and hunters in his vicinity, Thoreau kept abreast of who was shooting what when and where. He made repeated notations of the following types: "Saw Goodwin this afternoon returning from the river with two minks, one trapped, the other shot, and half a dozen muskrats" (VIII, 27, i6 Nov. I855); "I meet Goodwin and afterward Melvin. They are musquash-shooting. The latter has killed nineteen to-day downstream, thirty-one yesterday up the Assabet" (X, 140, 29 Oct. I857); "Melvin and others are out after muskrats again, and [I] see them with their pouches stuffed out with their round bodies" (VII, I54, 30 Jan. I 855); "Melvin 9 Odell Shepard, for example, called the journals "the most valuable articles of private property left by" Thoreau, and labeled Walden a "sprout of the journals." He argued that the journals were an authentic source because of their immediacy and privacy of impressions; see The Heart of Thoreau's Journals (New York: Dover, I96 i), pp. vii- x.

He has killed another [musk]rat" (VIII, 25 8, 8 Apr. i 856); "Stedman Buttrick tells me that a great many ducks and large yellow-legs have been killed within a day or two" (X, I29, 27 Oct. i 857); and "Saw Melvin buying an extra quantity of shot in anticipation of the freshet and musquash-shooting tomorrow" (XI, 41 6, 2 I Jan. I 859).1O Although Thoreau did not seek out these hunters purposely, he followed their activity with an interest approaching the proprietary. Knowing of Thoreau's intense curiosity about animals, several local hunters brought him specimens of unusual and even usual fauna to examine. On 24 April i 85 6, Thoreau recorded that "Good- win shot, about 6 P.M., and brought to me a cinereous coot. . ." (VIII, 307). Two years later Goodwin brought him "this year's loon, which he just killed on the river" (XI, 309, i i Nov. i 85 8). Frank Brown showed him "some lesser redpolls which he shot yesterday" on 5 March i 85 3, and "a white hare he had killed" on 30 January i854 (V, 3; VI, 83). On 8 December i855, he noted the following without seeing a hint of incongruity in the situation: "Jacob Farmer brought the head of a mink tonight and took tea here" (VIII, 40). If Thoreau found these specimens any bit repulsive because hunters had killed them, his journals did not indicate so. Along with observing the local hunting and serving as a collection point for some of its victims, Thoreau acted as a repository for hunting lore and stories.

On I5 June I857, he mentioned a hunter whose shot had killed his dog as well as the deer and had nearly nicked his wife and children (IX, 423-24). On 8 September i 854, he noted yet another rather unusual event: "Had heard an old Mr. Hosmer . . . say that he had shot three dozen muskrats at one shot at Birch Island" (VII, 26). On i9 March I859, he reported, "The newspapers state that a man in Connecticut lately shot ninety-three musquash in one day" (XII, 67). Thoreau was also interested in hunting technique and animal behavior: "Good- win and Farmer think that a dog will not touch the dead body of a mink, it smells so strongly. The former, after skinning them, throws the carcass into a tree for the crows" (VIII, 36, 27 Nov. i 855); "F. Brown, who has been chasing a white rabbit this after- noon with a dog, says that they do not run off far,-often play round within the'same swamp only, if it is large, and return to where they started" (VI, I23, I4 Feb. I854); "He [Goodwin] has caught skunks in traps set for minks with a piece of muskrat" (VI, I 63, i o Mar. I 854). No hunting item seemed too offensive for Thoreau's compendium. George Minott, Concord's aging hunter and raconteur, appears to have groomed Thoreau as his successor. Of Minott, Thoreau wrote on 29 February i 85 6, "He loves to recall his hunting days and adventures, and I willingly listen to the stories he has told me half a dozen times already" (VIII, I94). Sometimes Thoreau grew impatient with him. On i 8 October i 85 8, he groused that Minott "tried to detain me to listen to some of his hunting-stories" (XI, 223), but he stayed that day and others and usually found the tales marvelous. "Minott has a story for every woodland path. He has hunted in them all. Where we walked last, he had once caught a partridge by the wing!" he exclaimed in the I 2 November i85i entry (III, I09). Minott, who had begun carrying a gun "when he was fifteen or sixteen years old," constantly impressed Thoreau as a man who had kept vital contact with nature throughout the years (IX, I30, 2I Oct. i856)."

Thoreau's letter to the Emersons on 8 July I 843 commented that Minott "looms up considerably" in his thoughts; see The Correspondence of Henry David Thoreau, eds.

I23.</page><page sequence="7">Thoreau's Ambivalence Toward Hunting 35I Throughout his journals, Thoreau generally praised hunting if it was inspiring or ennobling in aim and result. On 7 July I840 he declared, "I have experienced such simple joy in the trivial matters of fishing and sporting formerly-as might inspire the muse of Homer or Shakspeare [sic]." 12 Some eighteen years later, he confessed to deeper sensations: "I hear the guns going to-day, and I must confess they are to me a springlike and exhilarating sound, like cock-crowing, though each may report the death of a musquash. This, methinks, or the like of this, with whatever mixture of dross, is the real morning or evening hymn that goes up from these vales to-day, and which the stars echo. This is the best sort of glorifying of God and enjoying him that at all prevails here to- day. . . (XI, 424, 22 Jan. I 859). Hunting, for Thoreau, was an affirmation of ancient mythic connections and Indian traditions, a necessary growth stage for adolescents. Hunters were often better perceivers of nature than non-hunters, Thoreau insisted, and pra- iseworthy because they were conversant with wildness. They were infinitely preferable in his mind to farmers, shopkeepers, and study- bound intellectuals. Hunting which evoked mythic or fabulous elements excited Thoreau. "Did not the young Achilles (?) spend his youth learning how to hunt?" he queried, as part of a meditation on how to spend a day, to get the most of life (II, 47I, 7 Sept. I85I). Discussing the marvels of antlered animals, he told of an old fable about hunters shooting cherry pits at their game; the pits then sprouted into cherry tree antlers, whose fruit provided juicy refreshment for the hunters. "It is a perfect piece of mythology which belongs to these days," he mused (III, 306, i6 Feb. I852). At times he compared contemporary hunters to men of myth: Goodwin was a "one-eyed Ajax" (XI, 283, 4 Nov. i858).13 Diana and Apollo, goddess and god of the chase, romped through his hunting passages. Once Thoreau recounted thinking of Diana while he chased a fox: "So yielding to the instinct of the chase, I tossed my head aloft and bounded away, snuffing the air like a foxhound; and spurning the world and the humane society at each bound. It seemed the woods rang with the hunter's horn, and Diana and all the satyrs joined in the chace [sic] and cheered me on." 14 Another time he 12 The Writings of Henry D. Thoreau: Journal i, p. I5I. 13 But see The Maine Woods, pp. I28-29, where Thoreau sarcastically likened a hunter to Hercules. 14 The Writings of Henry D. Thoreau: Journal I, p. 24I.</page><page sequence="8">352 American Literature invoked both deities: "Let the divine spirits like the huntsman with his bugle accompany the animal spirit that would fain range the forest and meadow. Even the gods and goddesses, Apollo and Diana are found in the field, though they are superior to the dog and the deer" (V, 379, I9 Aug. i853)."I Hunting also kept Indian traditions alive in Thoreau's mind. After lauding Goodwin and Haynes for their hunting competency, he thought them allied to savages in a positive sense (VI, 240, 6 May i854). Five years later, he returned to the theme: "In the musquash-hunters I see the Almouchicois still pushing swiftly over the dark stream in their canoes. These aboriginal men cannot be repressed, but under some guise or other they survive and reappear continually" (XI, 424-25, 22 Jan. I 859). Although often Thoreau expressed ambivalence about Indians, in these contexts the com- parison seemed complimentary. The "embryo man" passed through the "hunter stage of development" on the way to finer sentiments in adulthood, yet Thoreau did not wish to see that ancient phase vanish in modern life (V, 304, 26 June 1853). Thoreau hungered for wildness continually and lamented its demise. "I wish my neighbors were wilder. . . . Wild as if we lived on the marrow of antelopes devoured raw," he wrote in i 85 i (II, I7'). Proudly he boasted to Mrs. Lucy Brown on 2I July I84I, "I grow savager and savager every day, as if fed on raw meat, and my tameness is only the repose of untamableness." 16 What he noted in William Wood's New England's Prospect ( I 639), which he read in i 855, was the list of wilder species which had once inhabited the Concord area (VII, I 32-37, 24 Jan. i 855). The next year he voiced his lament directly: "I spend a considerable portion of my time observing the habits of the wild animals, my brute neighbors. . . . But when I consider that the nobler animals have been exterminated here, -the cougar, panther, lynx, wol- verene, wolf, bear, moose, deer, the beaver, the turkey, etc., etc.,- I cannot but feel as if I lived in a tamed, and as it were, emasculated 15 Thoreau referred twice more to Diana in contexts that suggest he was thinking of hunting as a metaphorical, intellectual exercise. See II, 78, I 850: "0 my sister! 0 Diana, thy tracks are on the eastern hills. Thou surely passedst that way. I, the hunter, saw them in the morning dew. My eyes are the hounds that pursue thee." See also IV, 472, 2I Jan. I 85 3: "I listen from time to time to hear the hounds of Silence baying the Moon,-to know if they are on the track of any game. If there's no Diana in the night, what is the worth? I hark the goddess Diana." 16 The Correspondence of Henry David Thoreau, p. 45.</page><page sequence="9">Thoreau's Ambivalence Toward Hunting 353 country. Would not the motions of those larger and wilder animals have been more significant still? Is it not a maimed and imperfect nature that I am conversant with" (VIII, 2 20-2 I, 23 Mar. I 856)? Although Thoreau must have realized that hunters had been partly responsible for driving out those large mammals, he still found hunters intriguing because they had such close contact with the wilds. Hunters in the fields symbolized for him the hope that his present-day neighbors would keep at least a lingering hold on the savage within themselves. Several times Thoreau flatly declared hunting the best way to perceive nature. On 28 February i 856 he asserted: "How various are the talents of men! . . . How much more game he will see who carries a gun, i.e. who goes to see it! Though you roam the woods all your days, you never will see by chance what he sees who goes on purpose to see it. One gets his living by shooting woodcocks; most never see one in their lives" (VIII, I92). A year later, he wrote down similar advice: "If, as a poet or naturalist, you wish to explore a given neighborhood, go and live in it. . . . Fish in its streams, hunt in its forests, gather fuel from its water, its woods, cultivate the ground, etc. This will be the surest and speediest way to those perceptions you covet" (X, I46, 29 Oct. i 85 7). Perhaps his strongest statement to this effect came in a passage which he penned on 4 November i 85 8. After a long discourse on how the seeker of beauty must imitate the trained sportsman and learn how to dream of and anticipate it, "know its seasons and haunts," Thoreau bragged about the hunter: "The true sportsman can shoot you almost any of his game from his windows. It comes and perches at last on the barrel of his gun; but the rest of the world never see it, with feathers on. . . . The geese fly exactly under his zenith, and honk when they get there. Twenty musquash have the refusal of each one of his traps before it is empty" (XI, 286-87). The muse of wildness, perhaps even in death-throes, received the constant attention of the hunters. Occasionally Thoreau elevated the local hunters to mythic stature or simply praised their everyday competency and cheerfulness. He was equally as grateful that Minott, Rice, Melvin, Goodwin, and Puffer lived as he was that Homer, Christ, and Shakespeare had lived (IX, I5 I, 3 Dec. i 856). He waxed particularly eloquent about Melvin:</page><page sequence="10">354 American Literature He follows hunting, praise be to him, as regularly in our tame fields as farmers follow farming. Persistent Genius! How I respect him and thank him for him [sic]! I trust the Lord will provide us with another Melvin when he is gone. How good in him to follow his own bent, and not continue at the Sabbath-school all his days! What a wealth he thus becomes in the neighborhood . . . I thank my stars for Melvin. I think of him with gratitude when I am going to sleep. . . . Yet he is agreeable to me as a tinge of russet on the hillside. . . . He is my contemporary and neighbor. He is one tribe, I am another, and we are not at war. (IX, I48, 2 Dec. I856) Probably Thoreau romanticized the lives of these hunters, and perhaps he saw his own passions mirrored in Melvin's career, but the image of independence connected with hunting invigorated his intellect. Whereas he applauded the hunters, Thoreau usually reserved scorn for farmers and housebound townsmen. On 22 December I853 he declaimed, "Sportsmen and loafers are better company" than dull, moralizing farmers (VI, 2 i). Two years later, he repeated his preference, "I have more taste for the wild sports of hunting, fishing, etc. . . . than for . . . farming" (VII, 5 I9-20, 26 Oct. I855). Shopkeepers also were less worthy than the hunters. He remarked about Melvin, who had been collecting nuts he had noticed while hunting all year, "It is pleasanter to me to meet him with his gun . . . than to meet some portly caterer for a family, basket on arm, at the stalls of Quincy Market" (X, I I I, 20 Oct. I857). The hunter's methods of obtaining meat seemed more authentic to Thoreau. The "humane society will not make the hunter despicable so soon as the butcher," he posited in I 840.17 Even intellectuals like Emerson did not escape his disdain: "While Emerson sits writing [in] his study this still, overcast, moist day, Goodwin is paddling up the still, dark river" (IX, 296, i 8 Mar. I857).18 Richard Bridgman summed up these Thoreauvian atti- tudes in his recent book: "One can see the attraction of hunting for Thoreau: the primitive expression of self in the act of mastery, 17 The Writings of Henry D. Thoreau: Journal i, I76. 18 Thoreau once mocked Emerson's hunting abilities: "Emerson is gone to the Ad- irondack country with a hunting party. Eddy says he has carried a double-barrelled gun, one side for shot, the other for ball, for Lowell killed a bear there last year. But the story on the Mill-Dam is that he [Emerson] has taken a gun which throws shot from one end and ball from the other!" (XI, 77, 6 Aug. i858).</page><page sequence="11">Thoreau's Ambivalence Toward Hunting 355 it is equivalent to life, to energy, to action. Opposed to it is the bookish despair, the disease of civilization, of those who live in- doors.""9 Dynamism, even that touched with killing, appealed to the intellectually restless Thoreau. And yet Thoreau found much repulsiveness, much impurity, much coarseness of motive in hunting. He prided himself on having outgrown the need to hunt or carry a gun. He saw that the very hunters he praised so highly were guilty of brutishness, wastefulness, and mercenary acts. He also came to decry the "inhumane" use of animals for scientific study, a condemnation which struck at the heart of some of his own nature study. In these negative feelings, something of the puritan loomed up in Thoreau. The same man who could look unflinchingly on many gruesome details of nature now grew squeamish and questioned the very morality of humans killing and ingesting animals, or selling their pelts for a few pennies. "Now I go a-fishing and a-hunting everyday, but omit the fish and the game, which are the least important part," Thoreau con- gratulated himself on 26 January I853. "I have learned to do without them. They were indispensable only as long as I was a boy" (IV, 480). Thoreau believed in the social stages of history, an evolutionary scheme in which the hunter gave way eventually to the poet-naturalist: "Such is oftenest the young man's intro- duction to the forest and wild. He goes thither at first as a hunter and fisher, until at last the naturalist or poet distinguishes that which attracted him and leaves the gun and fishing-rod be- hind. . ." (V, 304, 26 June I 853). By that definition, adult men who still hunted were depriving themselves of nature's subtler revelations. Because Thoreau subscribed to this theory of social evolution, he found any example of impurity or coarseness of motive in hunting especially disappointing. The sight of Goodwin and Haynes hunting prompted this remark once: "How pitiful a man looks about this sport! Haynes reminded me of the Penobscots" (VI, 23 3, I May I 854) . With some little indignation the next year, he recalled Goodwin killing a muskrat wastefully: "Yesterday I met Goodwin shooting muskrats and saw the form and bloody stains of two through his game-bag. He shot such as were close to the shore where he could get them, for he had no dog, the water being 19 Dark Thoreau, p. I I 0.</page><page sequence="12">356 American Literature too cold, he said. I saw one poor rat lying on the edge of the ice reddened with its blood, half a dozen rods from the shore, which he had shot but was unwilling to wade for" (VII, I32, 23 Jan. I855). Five years later, although Thoreau had praised hunters in the intervening years, his indictment of wasteful hunting was harsher yet: "I see a brute with a gun in his hand, standing motionless over a musquash-house which he has destroyed.... There lies the red carcass of one whose pelt he has taken on the spot, flat on the bloody ice. And for his afternoon's cruelty that fellow will be rewarded with a ninepence, perchance. When I consider what are the opportunities of the civilized man for getting ninepences and getting light, this seems to me more savage than savages are" (XIII, 53-54, 26 Dec. I 859). For Thoreau now, hunting was "a pitiful business," a morally degrading pursuit: "When we see men and boys spend their time shooting and trapping musquash and mink, we cannot but have a poorer opinion of them" (XII, I 2I, 8 Apr. I 859). Over and over he raged against displays of wanton slaughter. On I 6 July I 85 I he railed, "Some thoughtless and cruel sportsman has killed twenty-two young partridges not much bigger than robins, against the laws of Massachusetts and humanity" (II, 3I3). With grim irony, he repeated a story about a hunter who had taken revenge upon a squirrel which had dis- tracted the ducks the hunter had been stalking (X, I I 3). He smarted at the indignity of a proud hawk's body "delivered up to the children and the dog, and, like the body of Hector, is dragged so many times round Troy" (XI, 305, 9 Nov. I858). The next year he complained bitterly, "The unsympathizing man regards the wildness of some animals, their strangeness to him as a sin; as if all their virtue consisted in their tamableness. He has always a charge in his gun ready for their extermination" (XI, 450, I 6 Feb. I 859). The matter of the hunters' indiscriminate killing forced Thoreau to ponder the issues of innocence and barbarity regarding animals, but the savage urge to hunt men as animals especially incensed him. On 2I October I859 he blasted away in his journal: "In California and Oregon, if not nearer home, it is common to treat men exactly like deer which are hunted, and I read from time to time in Christian newspapers how many 'bucks,' that is, Indian men their sportsmen have killed" (XII, 4I6-I7). One day later, commenting on John Brown's raid, Thoreau expanded his obser-</page><page sequence="13">Thoreau's Ambivalence Toward Hunting 357 vation to include treatment of runaway slaves: "For once the Sharp's rifle and the revolver were employed in a righteous cause. The tools were in the hands of one who could use them. I know that the mass of my neighbors think that the only righteous use that can be made of them is to fight duels with them when we are insulted by other nations, or hunt Indians, or shoot fugitive slaves with them" (XII, 422, 22 Oct. I 859). "Think what a pitiful kind of life ours is," he cried on 2 i December I 856, "eating our kindred animals! and in some places one another!" (IX, I92). He urged Americans to examine their consciences, to meditate upon the matter of innocence concerning other denizens of nature: "It would be worth the while to ask ourselves weekly, Is our life innocent enough? Do we live inhumanely toward man or beast, in thought or act? To be serene and successful we must be at one with the universe. The least conscious and needless injury inflicted on any creature is to its extent a suicide. What peace-or life- can a murderer have" (VI, 3 I 0- I I, 28 May I 854)? When hunting appeared to be nothing more than murder, Thoreau's anger flashed. His attitude about hunting for scientific purposes presents an- other curious quirk in his ambivalent stance. Thoreau did shoot or capture some of his specimens, but he remained very troubled by the morality of his acts. "The inhumanity of science concerns me," he wrote on 28 May I 854, "as when I am tempted to kill a rare snake that I may ascertain its species. I feel that this is not the means of acquiring true knowledge" (VI, 3I i).2o Three months later he again begged for absolution: "I have just been through the process of killing the cistudo [Blanding's tortoise] for the sake of science; but I cannot excuse myself for this murder, and see that such actions are inconsistent with the poetic perception, how- ever they may serve science, and will affect the quality of my observations. I pray that I may walk more innocently and serenely through nature. No reasoning whatever reconciles me to this act. It affects my day injuriously. I have lost some self-respect. I have a murderer's experience in a degree" (VI, 452, i8 Aug. I854). Yet Thoreau was far from perfect in putting his repentance into practice. He apparently worried little about the moral condition of his neighbors who constantly brought him specimens for investi- gation. He gladly accepted freshly-killed animals and filled pages 20 See also IX, 343, 25 Apr- I857-</page><page sequence="14">358 American Literature of his journals with notation about them. Once after wishing that he might find a duck that sportsmen had downed, he found a dead goosander and wrote three pages of enthralled description (VII, 287-92, 6 Apr. I855). Another time he recorded, "I buy a male muskrat of Goodwin, just killed." Two pages of comment followed (VIII, 297-98, 22 Apr. I 856). Of a trip to Vermont in I 856, he wrote, "The most interesting sight I saw in Brattleboro was the skin and skull of a panther." Three pages of panther lore ensued (IX, 7I-74, 9 Sept. I856). Four years later, the sight of the body of a Canada lynx just killed near Concord elicited the same response (XIV, 78-8I, 83-87, i i and I3 Sept. i86o). In I 853, while on the moosehunt in Maine, he eagerly measured and recorded details about the bloody carcass, despite his disgust. On the matter of hunting and science, Thoreau often let his scientific curiosity override his ethics. Why Thoreau should have been so susceptible to this ambiva- lence about hunting demands explanation. The fact that he was ambivalent about certain human activities should hardly be sur- prising. This form of uncertainty, however, has gone basically unnoticed or even ignored, as Thoreauvians have gloried in his image as environmentalist prophet. In actuality Thoreau would have found such uses of his writings incomplete, although he might not have even recognized himself how he vacillated about hunting. Most of the hunting he witnessed was for food or fur, not for sport. He could not criticize those hunters for indulging in idle play, yet their activities triggered his sporadic disgust for commerce and carnivorousness. He preferred and idealized a morally ascetic lifestyle, which included pleas for human innocence in the natural world and vegetarianism. Yet again and again in his writings, Thoreau found himself dwelling on incidents of death, killing, and destruction. Bridgman suggested that even though Thoreau ob- jected strongly to killing animals and still praised hunting, "the two opposed selves were never permitted to confront one another," that he "kept his mind protectively compartmentalized."2' But perhaps Thoreau was not so divided after all; perhaps he found himself mired in a deep paradox in which contradictory emotions welled up repeatedly and simultaneously. His early realization of the ecological cycles of death and decay, birth and growth, undercut 21 Dark Thoreau, p. I I 2.</page><page sequence="15">Thoreau's Ambivalence Toward Hunting 359 his pleas for cosmic innocence. Hunters appeared to him alternately as grand actors on the stage of nature or as petty killers skulking through the shadows. Whether he was aware of his intellectual teeter-tottering about hunting or not, the ambivalence about this level of activity may have added to his more pervasive ambivalence about nature in general. Perhaps Thoreau's best chance to resolve this paradox was to remove the blood from hunting, to place the act in the realm of metaphor. Several passages in the journals reveal that hunting meant much more to him than mere killing. He employed hunting as a fruitful metaphor to describe his intellectual pursuit of nature, animals, himself. The interchange of identity between man and beast intrigued Thoreau greatly. He attributed anthropomorphic qualities to animals and animalistic traits to humans. In his jottings, for example, a grizzly bear took on resemblances of a human being, a muskrat shared kindred mortality with man, and swans protected two wounded compatriots much as would a retreating army (IV, 49I, 9 Feb. I853; VI, 98-99, 5 Feb. I854; VII, 209, 22 Feb. I855). Even sympathetic magic was possible to Thoreau. "Possi- bly," he speculated, the Hottentots by eating their antelope raw derived "a certain wild-animal vigor therefrom, which the most artfully cooked meats do not furnish" (II, I6I, I4 Feb. I85I). But the most enticing equation of man and beast, in Thoreau's estimate, was the man adopting the thought patterns and move- ments of the pursued and observed animal. In his own modes of thinking, Thoreau often slipped into the manner of a hunter chasing prey. While on the trail of an animal, he reveled in matching wits with the beast. For instance, after prowling after a fox, he confided to his journal on 5 February I 854: "I followed on his trail so long that my thoughts grew foxy; though I was on the back track, I drew nearer and nearer to the fox each step. Strange as it may seem, I thought several times that I scented him, though I did not stoop" (VI, iOi). Proceeding from that sort of bloodless hunt, it was an easy step for Thoreau to remove the animal and substitute an abstract entity, to elevate all his hunting to a plane of spirituality, to ask, "Are there not hunters who seek something higher than foxes, with judgment more discriminating than the senses of fox-hounds, who rally to nobler music than that of the hunting-horn?" (VI, 44, I Jan. I 854). Five years later, after mentioning that a score of townsmen were</page><page sequence="16">3 6o American Literature out shooting and setting traps, Thoreau again posed his rhetorical question: "Am I not a trapper too, early and late scanning the rising flood, ranging by distant wood-sides, setting my traps in solitude, and baiting them as well as I know how, that I may catch life and light, that my intellectual part may taste some venison and be invigorated, that my nakedness may be clad in some wild, furry warmth" (XII, 82-83, 25 Mar. I859)? Aside from the possibly sexual imagery of the last clause, this passage probably phrased best Thoreau's constant struggle to infuse a wild activity with some spiritual meaning, to reconcile the two spheres of en- vironmental perception, that of man acting as the animal in his skin and that of man feeling separate from the beast and thus observing and pursuing it. Hence his relentless search through heaps of natural fact; Thoreau always tried, as Emerson posed, to discover the spiritual truth behind the natural fact. Thinking about hunting, Thoreau happened upon the disconcerting paradox that he was both of nature and not of nature. This paradox in turn fueled his continuing ambivalence about hunting. The last reference that Thoreau made about hunting, a journal entry on 2I February i86i in which he quoted from William Elliott's Carolina Sports, manifests the persistence of his uncer- tainty. In Elliott's casual sketches of Southern hunting, Thoreau found his worst fears confirmed. Elliott's hunters showed little respect toward animals, only flippancy and amusement. To Tho- reau, who had spent so many years in observation of nature and various modes of the hunt, Elliott and his ilk were irresponsible. Thoreau sought to demonstrate Elliott's "human inconsistency" by juxtaposing contrary paragraphs from the book. That may have been his final position on the subject of hunting; yet when he advised Elliott, "Physician, heal thyself!" he might have just as easily applied that dictum to himself (XIV, 3I5-I9). More than likely, Thoreau remained uncertain about the moral worth of hunt- ing right up until the end.22 If his long-time friend, William Ellery 22 Charles Anderson summed up Thoreau's interest in Elliott's book thus: "There was probably a dual motivation. There was first his lifelong interest in hunting and fishing, which would have drawn him to any book on the subject; then there was the growing awareness of his ambiguous attitude toward sports, his growing fear that men brutify themselves by these amusements"; see "Thoreau Takes a Pot Shot at Carolina Sports," Georgia Review, 2 2 (I968), 295.</page><page sequence="17">Thoreau's Ambivalence Toward Hunting 36I Channing, was not creating legend when he claimed that Thoreau's last subconscious words were "Moose" and "Indian," perhaps those cryptic utterances capped a lifelong ambivalence toward the urge to hunt in America.</page></plain_text>
