<plain_text><page sequence="1">Spinoza as Educator. By WILLIAM Louis RABENORT. New York, Teachers College, Columbia University, Contributions to Education, No. 38, i9ii. -pp. 87. Although this thesis contains but little positive contribution either to the interpretation of Spinoza's philosophy or to the theory of education, it raises some interesting questions. In the first place, the general subject of the thesis, Spinoza's relation to education, is well worth considering; for Spinoza not only treats concretely subjects connected with education, such as ethics and politics, but he contemplated formulating his ideas on education directly. In the second place, the author's interpretation of the Spinozistic substance is not the traditional one; yet it is scarcely valid as it stands, for there is not an entire 'absence of justification for the suspicion that Spinoza based his system upon an abstraction of substance' (p. 2I). One cannot ignore the statement, 'all determination is negation,' for it represents a real phase of Spinoza's metaphysics. Moreover, in so far as the doctrines of substance and essence are abstract they are not suitable subject-matter for a treatise on education; although they are interesting in philosophical speculation and history, they are not helpful practically. In the third place, there is the good suggestion that the classification of Spinoza as pantheist is either vague or misleading (pp. 6, 7). Unfortunately the author could not presuppose in students of educa- tion any acquaintance with Spinoza and so was forced to burden his thesis with a good deal of mere exposition. He' begins with an account of Spinoza's personal connection with education. In the discussion of the metaphysics which follows he points out Spinoza's freedom from anthropomorphic concep- tions and his scientific treatment of the relation of the attributes. But what is more important for his particular purposes, he does justice in the last three</page><page sequence="2">No. 5.] NOTICES OF NEW BOOKS. 567 chapters to Spinoza's concrete treatment of the ethical nature of man; he explains that reason is the organizing principle of the good life, the social character of virtue, and the place of emotion in the life of reason. A consider- able number of quotations from Spinoza are used to good advantage. On the whole, the thesis lacks the accuracy and thoroughness of a careful piece of research. The first sentence of the preface contains a miscalculation by a century of the time since Spinoza's period; pantheism is sometimes capitalized and sometimes not (pp. 6, 7); there are typographical errors on pp. 17, 35, and 45.
