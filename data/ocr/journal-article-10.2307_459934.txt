<plain_text><page sequence="1">HOW WELL DID POE KNOW MILTON? BY THOMAS P. HAVILAND " ALL literary history," wrote Edgar Allan Poe, "demonstrates that for the most frequent and palpable plagiarisms, we must search the works of the most eminent poets."' The term "plagiarism" may be variously defined in connection with a work of literary art, the crime rang- ing in degree from servile reproduction to such creative use of sources as one finds in Shakespeare and Milton. Indeed, the term is all too often used without any apparent recognition of the fact that an idea-or a phrase-may occur independently to two different minds. To Edgar Poe, harried, beset, frustrated, the thing became an obsession and for him the term gained the widest applicability-particularly as he saw, or fancied he saw, others poaching on his own preserves. Yet ironically the question arises as to whether the author of "Al Aaraaf" might not, by his own definition, be indicted for plagiarizing John Milton; whether, indeed, his reply to Outis -"Can any man doubt that between the Iliad and the Paradise Lost there might be established even a thousand idiosyncratic identities?-And yet is any man fool enough to maintain that the Iliad is the only original of Paradise Lost?"2-represents to some degree a de- fensive attitude? In view of Poe's several footnotes indicating Milton as his source, additional annotation by his editors,3 and a considerable num- ber of references to the blind bard in his essays and critical pieces, it would seem of considerable importance to determine just how familiar the poet was with his great predecessor. At first thought, the definitions of the poet's art presented by the two would seem to offer no common ground, indeed would appear directly antithetical. Writes Poe: "We would define in brief the poetry of words as the Rhythmical Creation of Beauty. Beyond the limits of Beauty its province does not extend." And specifically, "with the intellect or with the conscience it has only collateral relations. It has no dependence, unless incidentally, upon either Duty or Truth.... If," he continues, "truth is the highest aim of either Painting or Poesy, then Jan Steen was a greater artist than Angelo, and Crabbe is a nobler poet than Milton."4 Although Milton could heartily subscribe to Poe's further statement 1 "Reply to Outis, V," in Complete Works of Edgar Allan Poe, ed. James A. Harrison (N. Y., 1902), xII, 106-hereafter "Harrison." This edition has been used for material not available in The Complete Poems and Stories, ed. A. H. Quinn and E. H. O'Neill (N.

(PR 11.220-223) Nor could he recognize "the heresy of the didactic." Indeed, he heartily maintained, contra Poe, that "the ultimate object of all poetry is truth"; he could not accept, any more than could Keats, the Baltimorean's con- viction that "the demands of truth are severe; she has no sympathy with the myrtles." An art, Milton says in the "Preface" to his rendering of the Logic of Ramus, is what it is because of what it teaches, and no rule of art, but the higher utility resulting from the practice of rules constitutes its form.6 And finally: "True eloquence I find to be none, but the serious and hearty love of truth."7 As for rhyme, to Poe one of the components of music "of so vast a moment in poetry as never to be wisely rejected,"8 the poet of Paradise Lost (if not the young poet of "L'Allegro" and "I1 Penseroso") had reached the confirmed belief that it is "no necessary Adjunct or true Ornament of Poem or good Verse . . . but the Invention of a barbarous Age, to set off wretched matter and lame Meeter ... a thing of it self, to all judicious eares, triveal and of no true musical de- light; which consists only in apt Numbers, fit quantity of Syllables, and the sense variously drawn out from one Verse into another, not in the jingling sound of like endings."9 Yet these men are much closer in poetic theory than the statements indicate. Many are the faces of truth, and many are the forms of loveli- ness. Milton could subscribe without reservation to Poe's words: "In- spired by an ecstatic prescience of the glories beyond the grave, we struggle, by multiform combinations among the things and thoughts of time, to attain a portion of that Loveliness whose very elements, per- haps, appertain to eternity alone."'? What else, after all, is Paradise Lost? If for the older poet sheer Beauty is placed in the inferior position, if the lovely Minor Poems are to be regarded as merely practice work while his Pegasus gained feathers enough to wing him into a more rarefied ether, it is still true that he wrote "Lycidas" and "L'Allegro" (as well as many passages of lush beauty in his principal epic), and thus amply 5"Poetic Principle," Quinn and O'Neill, II, 1021 et passim. 6 Ida Langdon, Milton's Theory of Poetry and Fine Art (New Haven, 1924), p. 40. 7An Apology for Smectymnuus, in The Student's Milton, ed.

Haviland clear that beauty is still far from being a thing scorned. After all, if the child is father to the man, let us remember that this is the boy who was led to Spenser by Alexander Gill at St. Paul's, and early found delight in "the smooth elegiac poets ... for the pleasing sound of their numerous writing, which in imitation I found most easy, and most agreeable to nature's part in me... . "1 It is the young man who wrote the lovely Latin elegies and the "Nativity Ode"; it is the man with whom "David's Psalms were in esteem . . . above all poetry." Milton, as Poe, was deeply aware of the power of music, having often leaned over his gifted com- poser-father at the organ, mastering that instrument himself. Possessed, as Aubrey records, of "a delicate, tuneable Voice," he paid due homage to that Blest pair of Sirens, pledges of Heavns joy, Sphear-born, harmonious Sisters, Voice and Verse, ("At a Solemn Music") and constantly used, as Miss Langdon notes (p. 40), "song" as synony- mous for "poetry." And while Poe might insist that "he must be grossly wedded to con- ventionalisms who . . . shall still attempt to reconcile the obstinate oils and waters of Poetry and Truth," still he concedes that Poesy "is not forbidden to moralize-in her own fashion. She is not forbidden to depict -but to reason and preach of virtue [italics mine].... Taste contents herself with displaying the beauty; waging war with vice merely on the ground of its fitness, harmony, proportion ...."12 Or, may not one ask, justifying the ways of God to men? Furthermore: "It by no means fol- lows . . that the incitements of Passion, or the precepts of Duty, or even the lessons of Truth, may not be introduced into a poem, and with advantage; for they may subserve, in various ways, the general purposes of the work; but the true artist will always continue to tone them down in proper subjection to that Beauty which is the atmosphere and the real essence of the poem."'3 There seems no question that Poe revered the poet of Comus and of Paradise Lost as "the true artist," that, for him, Crabbe could never be a nobler poet than Milton-that he realized, in the words of Professor C. S. Lewis, that "when the old poets made some virtue their theme they were not teaching but adoring; what we take for the didactic is often the enchanted."14 On the shelves of young Edgar's room at his foster father's, Hervey Allen pictures a small collection of books: the classics, several of the popu- 1 Apology, Patterson, p. 548. 12 "Longfellow's Ballads," II, 938-939. 13 "Poetic Principle," in, 1027. 14 A Preface to Paradise Lost (London, 1944), p. v. 843</page><page sequence="4">How Well Did Poe Know Milton? lar Gothic romances, Byron, Moore, Wordsworth. "Milton was there, the boy knew him."'5 For something considerably more concrete, the present writer is indebted to Professor T. O. Mabbott, who has generous- ly made available his photostat of a leaf of selected passages in Poe's own beautiful hand, which he inclines to date 1831-34. Drawn for the most part from Comus, "Lycidas," and the sonnets, they constitute a most illuminating document, at his suggestion printed in full as an ap- pendix herewith. The letter to Mr. prefatory to the 1831 edition of the poems, dubbed by Allen "a rather youthful parade of erudition resounding with the names of Shakespeare and Milton" (I, 306), supports a poet's ability to make a just critique of his own work with the passage: "Milton is a great example to the contrary; but his opinion with respect to Paradise Regained is by no means fairly ascertained. By what trivial circumstances men are often led to assert what they do not really be- lieve! . . . But, in fact, the Paradise Regained is little, if at all, inferior to the Paradise Lost, and is only supposed to be so because men do not like epics, whatever they may say to the contrary, and reading those of Milton in their natural order, are too much wearied with the first to derive any pleasure from the second."'6 This is certainly an ingenious ex- planation, but not so ingenious as to indicate young Poe is talking from indirect information; it merely ties in with his several-times-stated con- viction that there can be no such thing as a long poem. He concludes the discussion with a personal opinion: "I dare say Milton preferred Comus to either-if so-justly. ... " Probably the most familiar reference to Paradise Lost, supporting Poe's dictum concerning the necessity of brevity, is found in the "Philos- ophy of Composition": "It is needless to demonstrate that a poem is such only inasmuch as it intensely excites, by elevating the soul; and all intense excitements are, through a psychal necessity, brief. For this reason, at least one-half of the Paradise Lost is essentially prose-a suc- cession of poetical excitements interspersed, inevitably, with correspond- ing depressions-the whole being deprived, through the extremeness of its length, of the vastly important artistic element, totality or unity of effect" (II, 980). He returns to the attack upon the long poem four years later in the opening of "The Poetic Principle," devoting a lengthy paragraph to debunking "the critical dictum that the Paradise Lost is to be devoutly admired throughout," maintaining that "this great work ... is to be regarded as poetical, only when ... we view it merely as a series of minor poems" (II, 1021). On such questions Poe attests his famil- iarity with, and-despite his quarrel with the epic form-his admiration for, Milton's "great work." 16 Israfel: The Life and Times of Edgar Allan Poe (N. Y., 1934), I, 129. 16 Titled "Letter to B ," Quinn and O'Neill, II, 857. 844</page><page sequence="5">Thomas P. Haviland Throughout his critical writing we find him using Milton as a touch- stone with considerable frequency, directly quoting him, footnoting; likewise finding appropriate mottoes for his prose and verse in the works of the blind bard. To mock indiscriminate praise of American reviewing he says, "All our poets are Miltons, neither mute nor inglorious.""7 In "The Domain of Arnheim" he asks (II, 674-675): "Is it not indeed possible that, while a high order of genius is necessarily ambitious, the highest is above that which is termed ambition? And may it not thus happen that many far greater than Milton have contentedly remained 'mute and inglorious'?" Excluding from present consideration merely general allusions to Milton and his works, one finds a good fifty-odd specific references or quotations, Paradise Lost leading off with close to thirty, Comus following next with ten, and such less-familiar poems as "The Death of a Fair Infant" and the Latin "De Idea Platonica quemad- modum Aristoteles Intellexit" finding representation. Milton's Prose Works in two volumes as edited by the Rev. Rufus Griswold are also intelligently and appreciatively discussed; the Areopagitica and De Doctrina Christiana in both the original and Dr. Sumner's translation are cited, the latter four times. "Pinakidia," apparently gathered as fillers, show the editor of the Southern Literary Messenger jotting down amidst a variety of information gleaned here and there a number of items attesting his interest in the blind poet: The noble simile of Milton, of Satan with the rising sun, in the first book of the Paradise Lost, had nearly occasioned the suppression of that epic; it was supposed to contain a treasonable allusion. Milton has the expression "Forget thyself to marble." Pope has the line "I have not yet forgot myself to stone."'8 The idea of "no light but rather darkness visible" was perhaps suggested to Milton by Spenser's "A little glooming light much like a shade." His form had not yet lost all her original brightness, is a very remarkable passage in Milton's Paradise Lost, wherein a person is personified. The "Marginalia" similarly note this passage, and in addition offer: One of the most singular pieces of literary mosaic is Mr. Longfellow's "Midnight Mass for the Dying Year" . . . And the line about the "hooded friars" is from the Comus of Milton (xvI, 74) which latter questionable identification he is to repeat the next year in the "Reply to Outis." 17 "The Quacks of Helicon," II, 926. 18 Harrison, xiv; the first and fourth are to be found on p. 47, the second on p. 53, the third on p. 54. 845</page><page sequence="6">How Well Did Poe Know Milton? Incidentally, Comus was sufficiently familiar to our poet to offer as a motto prefixed to "Al Aaraaf" in 1829: "What has night to do with sleep?" and to the story of the unfortunate Miss Psyche Zenobia: "What chance, good lady, hath bereft you thus?" A review of Thomas Moore's "Alci- phron" assures us: "If we carefully examine those poems ... or prose romances which mankind is accustomed to designate as imaginative . . . they are strongly mystic"; it offers a list of such poems, in which select company "The Comus of Milton" holds a high position (x, 65-66). One of its companions in the pastoral mood is cited as an example in his notice of an anthology of Old English Poetry: "In common with all the world we have been much delighted with 'The Shepherd's Hunting' by Wither-a poem partaking, in a remarkable degree, of the peculiarities of 'Il Penseroso' .... But these lines quoted, however good, do not bear with them much of the general character of the English antique."'9 As before remarked, the largest number of references is to the great epic; he is quick to defend it against the claims of little talents, he is critical of certain aspects, and, in the review of R. H. Horne's work, he is capable of grossly underestimating it. But at any rate his familiarity with the poem is such that our editor will not be taken in by the pen of any audacious, thieving Thingum Bob who confessed that: "From a fourth poem which was also the work of a blind man, I selected a page or two about 'hail' and 'holy light'; and although a blind man has no business to write about light, still the verses were sufficiently good."20 One feels that Poe might have had some passing qualms, at least, about Book ii of his own "Al Aaraaf!" Waxing ecstatic over R. H. Horne's Orion, he states that, though "there are tens of thousands who will con- demn us as heretical, the description of the Hell in Paradise Lost is al- together inferior in graphic effect, in originality, in expression, in the true imagination.... "21 Poe voices on several occasions a Johnsonian dislike for Milton's bestowing human form upon deity and the angels, quoting apropos of the matter in a review of J. G. C. Brainard's The Fall of Niagara "Dr. Summer's [Sumner's] notes on Milton's Christian Doc- trine"(x, 108-109) and confronting anthropomorphism again in a critical article on Elizabeth Barrett Barrett which gave that lady considerable pleasure and some embarrassment. He criticizes the niaseries... the mass of inconsistency and antagonism in which 'A drama of Exile' has inextricably involved her. She has made allusion to Milton, and no doubt felt secure in her theme . . . when she considered his Paradise Lost. But even in Milton's own day, when men had the habit of believing all things, the more nonsensical the more readily, and of worshipping, in blind acquiescence, the 19 Edited by S. C.

Haviland most preposterous of impossibilities-even then there were not wanting indi- viduals who would have read the great epic with more zest, could it have been explained to their satisfaction, how and why it was, not only that a snake quoted Aristotle's ethics, and behaved otherwise pretty much as he pleased, but that bloody battles were continually being fought between bloodless 'innumerable angels' as new the next morning, in time to be a reville roll-call. ... If the Para- dise Lost were written today . . . not even its eminent although overestimated merits would counter-balance... the multitudinous incongruities which are part and parcel of its plot.2 Finally, in what is possibly a superfluity of evidence concerning Poe's knowledge of John Milton, some further quotation from his review of Griswold's edition of the prose may be permitted. He remarks that the volumes contain "nearly all" the prose, but regrets "an unwarrantable omission in The Christian Doctrine," adding: It was found in 1823, by Mr. Lemon, Deputy Keeper of the State Papers, in the course of some researches among his book-shelves. It was a Latin MS. enveloped with some foreign dispatches in Milton's own hand, and superscribed 'To Mr. Skinner, Merchant.' According to Toland, this treatise was finished by its author soon after the Restoration .... Its value depends chiefly on the curious develop- ments it affords in relation to the poet's Arianism and opinions about polygamy- but its Latinity is so peculiarly forcible and fluent, that on this score alone, the treatise demands insertion ... it should be left untranslated, of course! Dr. Sumner's version is feeble.... Dr. Griswold says ... that 'in none of his great works is there a passage from which it can be inferred that he (Milton) was an Arian.' Here we entirely disagree with the compiler. The Paradise Lost abounds in such passages. In this review Poe has unstinted words of praise for Milton's style, with one example of which we may rest this section of our paper: "Some of his more directly controversial works rise at times into a species of lyrical rhapsody-divinely energetic-constituting for itself a department of composition which is neither prose nor poetry, but something with all the best qualities of each, and upon the whole superior to either" (xII, 244-246). "I would much rather have written the best song of a nation than its noblest epic," wrote Edgar Poe;23 yet, as we have seen, he was not un- appreciative of the noblest English epic, nor, as we shall see, did he es- cape receiving, either consciously or unconsciously, the imprint of the Grand Style. For a definition of this style one turns not to Matthew Arnold, who offers none, but to that fine scholar, Raymond Dexter Havens, who lists its characteristics as: 1. "Dignity, reserve, stateliness"; 2 Harrison, xII, 7-8. 23 "George P. Morris," Harrison, x, 44. 847</page><page sequence="8">How Well Did Poe Know Milton? 2. "The Organ Tone, the sonorous orotund which is always associated with Milton's name: 'Against the throne and monarchy of God', 'Who durst defy the Omnipotent to arms' "; 3. "Inversion of the natural order of words and phrases, one of Milton's many Latinisms" (particularly a word between two others which depend upon it-as a noun between two adjectives); 4. "The omission of words not necessary to the sense, one feature of the condensation that marks Milton's style: 'Though all our glory extinct, and happy state / Here swallow'd up in endless misery' "; 5. "Parenthesis and apposition.... 'Of Abbana and Pharphar, lucid streams' "; 6. "The use of one part of speech for another" (not restricted to, but particularly frequent in, Milton); 7. "Vocabulary" from reading in the classics, from admiration for Spenser, Shakespeare and other Elizabethans. (Archaic words, unusual Latinisms and Hellenisms, words in their older basic meanings); 8. "A considerable number of proper names"; 9. "Unusual compound epithets." Also noted by Professor Havens are the verse paragraph and pleasure in repetition.24 Let us briefly observe these characteristics as Poe employs them, most ready illustration coming from "Al Aaraaf." And let us do so humbly, remembering the Poet-critic's suggestion concerning the study of versification by a thous- and profound scholars over the centuries who "may have failed, first, because they were scholars, secondly, because they were profound, and, thirdly, because they were a thousand-the impotency of scholarship and profundity having been thus multiplied a thousandfold."25 One cannot, of course, make of these categories air-tight compart- ments, for all swell together into the Miltonic symphony. When Poe writes: "no man has ever surpassed if, indeed, any man has ever equalled the author of the Areopagitica in purity--in force-in copiousness,-in majesty-or, in what may be termed without the least exaggeration, a gorgeous magnificence of style,"26 he is speaking in terms of "Dignity, reserve, stateliness"-nor of the prose alone. Pausing to praise a passage of Mrs. Sigourney's Zinzendorf, he remarks: "these lines are glowing all over with the true radiance of poetry .. .; of the versification it is not too much to say that it reminds us of Miltonic power."27 When he offers as a single item without comment in Pinakidia: "Milton in Paradise Lost [it. 90-92] has this passage: ... when the scourge Inexorably, and the torturing hour Call us to penance";28 24 The Influence of Milton upon English Poetry (Cambridge, 1922), pp. 80-85 passim. 25 "The Rationale of Verse," Quinn and O'Neill, II, 987-988. 26 Prose Works, Harrison, xII, 244. 27 "Zinzendorff and Other Poems," Southern Literary Messenger (Jan. 1836), Harrison, vii, 131. 28 Harrison, xII, 57. 848</page><page sequence="9">Thomas P. Haviland he is presumably putting down an example-a sonorous one-of this Miltonic grandeur. In criticizing Bryant's poems he pounces upon "Go forth under the open sky and list" as "sadly out of place amid the forcible and even Miltonic rhythm of such lines as Take the wings Of morning, and the Barcan desert pierce; Or lose thyself in the continuous woods Where rolls the Oregon."29 Poe not only recognizes something like Miltonic grandeur, but he con- sciously reaches for it. A Broadway Journal review of Mrs. Browning (1845) and a later one in Graham's Magazine (1850), wherein he "ele- vates into unexceptionability" her lines, illustrate this: Hear the far generations-how they crash From crag to crag down the precipitous Time, In multitudinous thunders that upstartle Aghast, the echoes from their cavernous lairs. (Harrison, xIII, 193) His preoccupation seems to have been life-long, for we find lines of his own creation in the early (Oct. 1833) prize poem, "The Coliseum": These stones-alas! these gray stones-are they all- All of the famed and the colossal left By the corrosive Hours to Fate and me? "Not all"-the Echoes answer me-"not all! Prophetic sounds and loud arise forever From us, and from all Ruin, unto the wise." (11. 30-35) "Al Aaraaf," already remarked as something of a tour de force in the Miltonic, offers numerous examples, none more effective in its combina- tion of the various elements entering into the Grand Style than the following (11. 156-158): Up rose the maiden from her shrine of flowers, And bent o'er sheeny mountain and dim plain Her way-but left not yet her Therasaean reign. To the "Organ Tone," Israfel was attuned as to the heavenly lyre; This would have to be true of the consummate musician of "Ulalume' and "The Bells." "The elements of that beauty which is felt in sound' may be, the mutual or common heritage of Earth and Heaven. In the soul's struggles at combination it is thus not impossible that a harp may strike notes not unfamiliar to the angels."30 His use of the actual word 29 Quinn and O'Neill, II, 911 (the reference is to "Thanatopsis," 1. 41 and 11. 50-53). 30 "Longfellow's Ballads," Harrison, II, 941 (cf.

"sonorous" in connection with the Blind Poet is of interest in this con- nection; finding some fault with stanza xii of the Rev. Ralph Hoyt's "A Chant of Life," he yet remarks that "as a whole it is particularly sonorous and Miltonic."31 The quality is to be found in many of Poe's lines as, for instance: " ... seas of rays that roll / Empyrean splendor oer th'unchained soul"; or "A thousand seraphs burst th' Empyrean thro." Nor may one speak of "the Base of Heav'n's deep Organ" to the exclusion of the more fragile music of Nesace's two songs, both in the tra- dition of the songs of Comus, the second calling upon Ligeia very much as Sabrina Fair is besought. Indeed, the "Marginalia" offer direct evidence of his consciousness of this word-magic: The great force derivable from repetition of particular vowel sounds in verse, is little understood, or quite overlooked, even by those versifiers who dwell most upon what is commonly called "alliteration." How richly melodious are these lines of Milton's "Comus": May thy brimmed waves for this Their full tribute never miss- May thy billows roll ashore The beryl and the golden ore! Yet it seems especially singular that, with the full and noble volume of the long o resounding in his ears, the poet should have written, in the last line, "beryl" when he might so well have written "onyx."32 Inversion of natural word order has already been illustrated in a quo- tation above. Despite his later condemnation of, in particular, putting the adjective after the noun as "merely an inexcusable Gallicism,"33 exam- ples of inversion, not excepting the latter type, are a definite part of "Al Aaraaf's" technique: "hills Achaian," "into chaos hurled," "the heavens athwart," "in grief / Disconsolate linger," "And gemmy flower, of Trebizond misnamed," "A wreath that twin'd each starry form around / And all the opal'd air in color bound." The omission of words, condensation, parenthesis and apposition, the use of one part of speech for another are also to be noted, though some- what in dilution: "Of molten stars their pavement [was]," "Oh! the wave / Is now upon thee-but [it is] too late to save [thee]"; such parentheses as the "gemmy flower" just mentioned ("of Trebizond misnamed"), the two indicated in Part I or the series in Part ii, lines 2-10, are in the Miltonic manner. On Professor Havens' seventh count, "vocabulary archaic or drawn from the classics," much evidence may be deduced, from such gentle archaisms-if they actually are that-as: " 'mid," "O'er," "yon," 31 Broadway Journal (26 July 1845), Harrison, xII, 195. 32 Harrison, xvi, 26 and 27. 33 "Marginalia," Harrison, xvI, 153; see also xvr, 58 ("Inversions should be dismissed"). 850</page><page sequence="11">Thomas P. Haviland "erst"34 (admittedly by no means uncommon in the era of Bryant, Longfellow, et al.) to things more specifically antique. The poet justifies the word "pennoned" in a footnote "Pennon-for pinion-Milton"; we may add to the list from the same poem: "pettish tears," "unwonted reverie," "nursled the young mountain in its lair," "a red Daedalion." That he was well aware of a more immediate source for such locutions than the classics or Milton's master, Spenser, is clearly indicated in his review of Bryant's Poems: "Milton, it is true, uses it ['affect']-we remember it especially in Comus- 'Tis most true That musing meditation most affects The pensive secrecy of desert cell- but then, Milton would not use it were he writing Comus today."35 This does not, however, deter Poe. Well schooled in Latin himself, he responds appreciatively to the man whose Latin Macaulay named "the best ever achieved by an Englishman," praising De Doctrina Christiana for its "Latinity-so peculiarly forcible and fluent."36 In the midst of "Elea- nora," he places "light ineffable" in quotation marks, having in mind, it would seem, either Milton's "joy ineffable" or, more likely, "the son .../ Lightning Divine, ineffable, serene" (PL v.734-735). Among his latinisms in the poems, one finds "what time" (for "when," Lat. "quo tempore"), "charm" for song (Lat. "carmen": "the charm the maiden sang"), "the last ecstacy of satiate life," etc. While the Love of Names does not lead to the long series of Milton, yet it is obvious that the Baltimorean savors them in much the same fashion: "The gems of Circassy," "Nesace,"87 "Capo Deucato," "Trebi- zond," "Isola d'ore-Fior di Levante," "Therasaean reign," "Parian marble," "Eyraco" or, at some length, its inspiration patent: Achaian statues in a world so rich! Friezes from Tadmor and Persepolis From Balbec, and the stilly, clear abyss Of beautiful Gomorrah! . . . ("Al Aaraaf," II. 35-38) In the matter of unusual descriptive epithets, "Al Aaraaf," "Tamerlane," "Ulalume," in particular, offer their share, though not, as so often with Milton, in compound form. We meet "the ebon air," "the headlong air," "the winged strife," "single-mooned eve," "the unburthen'd air," 34 But cf. Harrison, xvi, 58, "All contractions are awkward. It is no paradox that the more prosaic the construction of verse, the better." 35 "Bryant's Poems," Quinn and O'Neill, II, 904. 36 "Prose Works," Harrison, xII, 244. 37 Professor Mabbott is convinced that this name, nowhere else recorded, is a misprint for NESAEE, a sea nymph mentioned by Homer. 851</page><page sequence="12">How Well Did Poe Know Milton? "ghoul-haunted woodland," "nebulous lustre," "lethean peace," "scoriac rivers," "the boreal pole," "crystalline light," "sibyllic splendor," "wood- landish ghouls." A certain pleasure in repeating words themselves, cited by Havens as also a minor characteristic, is to be noted in the compari- son of two such passages as: and feel by turns the bitter change Of fierce extreams, extreams by change more fierce ... (PL II.598-599) Unthought-like thoughts that are the souls of thought.38 This is to be distinguished from repetition of phrase with the effect of a refrain, a device of Poe's finding its chief expression in "The Raven" and "Ulalume." Final in the Miltonic categories is the so-called verse-paragraph, the skillful use of run-on lines, usually involving cunning variations in cae- sura, mentioned also by Professor Havens. The later poet was fully aware of this, and of Milton as a-if not the-source: "Milton, whose accurate ear (although he cannot be justly called the best of versifiers) included and balanced without difficulty, the rhythm of the longest pas- sages." He cites seven majestic lines of "Our Sire" to Michael (PL xii.479-485) by way of proof. "It is the nicety of this species of equaliza- tion more than any other metrical merit, which elevates Pope as a versi- fier ... it is the extension of the principle to sentences of greater length [italics mine] which elevates Milton above Pope."39 A reading of the youthful "Al Aaraaf" will indicate how well this lesson has been learned. Our study should involve a careful annotation of the narrative "Al Aaraaf" with its note of the mystical, its setting on a far planet, its Mil- tonic concern with angels and deities. The last attempt at length be- fore he reached the unalterable conclusion that there could be no such thing as a long poem, it marks, for W. B. Cairns, "a change from the manner of Tamerlane.... It has been customary to consider Moore as the chief influence in bringing about the change; and Professor Wood- berry also names Milton.... Milton is three times referred to in the notes, and there are several suggestions of Miltonic imagery."40 Killis Campbell sees his chief indebtedness to Sale, Milton, and Moore: "... from Milton he took the suggestion of much of the imagery of the second half of the poem" (p. 174). Although "Al Aaraaf" is by no means merely "the shadow of a shade," to the present writer there seems no question that its indebtedness to Milton is major. From the very outset there are lines, if not traceable to Milton, at 38 Poe's "To [Marie Louise Shew]," March 1848, Quinn and O'Neill, I, 80. 39 "Bryant's Poems," Quinn and O'Neill, ii, 895, 892. 40 "Some Notes on Poe's Al Aaraaf," MP, xIII, i, 41-42. 852</page><page sequence="13">Thomas P. Haviland least embodying the qualities which in combination we term Miltonic, for example (11. 28-29): "And, amid incense and high spiritual hymns, / Laves in quadruple light her angel limbs ... "or (11. 40-41): "A wreath that twined each starry form around, / And all the opal'd air in color bound.'41 These continue consistently, page by page. The opening picture of Nesace and her realm in space, looking into infinity, "Rich clouds, for canopies, about her curled," is in concept purely Miltonic. The flower passage, opening Stanza four (calling to mind the device in "Lyci- das") abounds in such images, phrases, locutions, allusions. The naming of the exotics is typical: the Sephalica "gemmy flower of Trebizond,"42 Nyctanthes, Clytia, serpentine aloes, Valesnerian lotus, hyacinth, the Nelumbo bud-all these carefully footnoted to show a complete aware- ness and depth of allusion typical of the older author. The figure of grief that hangs her head ... Heaving her white breast to the balmy air, Like guilty beauty, chasten'd and more fair: if found in the verses of another would be enough to make Poe cry, as he had so often, "The coincidences here are too markedly peculiar to be gainsayed," and send him to the second stanza of "The Nativity Hymn," where nature " . . woo's the gentle Air / To hide her guilty front with innocent Snow." Nesace's song to the great spirit (11. 82-117) seems suggested by the songs in Comus. That his predecessor was definitely in his mind at the moment is indicated by Poe's note to the lines: "Have dream'd for thy Infinity / A model of their own-."43 The passage from 41 See also lines 14-15 in the 1831 edition, cited by Killis Campbell, reminiscent of "II Penseroso": "Thou! thy framing is so holy / Sorrow is not melancholy." 42 Although Campbell (p. 176) calls attention to lines from Lalla Rookh, he agrees that one might compare with this tradition of the Asphodel, amaranth in PL III.353-357. 43 "The Humanitarians held that God was to be held as having really a human form- vide Clarke's Sermon, Vol. I, page 26, fol. edition. "The drift of Milton's argument leads him to employ language which would appear, at first sight, to verge upon their doctrine; but it will be seen immediately that he guards himself against the charge of having adopted one of the most ignorant errors of the dark ages of the church. Dr. Sumner's Notes on Milton's Christian Doctrine "Among Milton's minor poems are these lines: Dicite sacrorum praesides nemorum Deae &amp;c Quis ille primus cujus ex imagine Natura solers finxit humanum genus? Eternus, incorruptus, aequaevus polo, Unusque et universus exemplar Dei. "And afterwards: Non cui profundus Caecitas lumen dedit Dircaeus augur vidit hunc alto sinu, &amp;c." 853</page><page sequence="14">How Well Did Poe Know Milton? the "Nativity" also seems referred to in the pathetic fallacy which fol- lows-always granting that the thing itself is constant in seventeenth- century verse: She ceas'd-and buried then her burning cheek Abash'd, amid the lilies there, to seek A shelter from the fervour of his eye; For the stars trembled at the Deity. He refers to "a sound of silence" . . . "which dreamy poets call 'the music of the sphere' "; this music is so named in "Arcades" (63-64), "Comus" (111-113), "Nativity Hymn" (125-129). The tone of Poe's lines (131-132), The eternal voice of God is passing by; And the red winds are withering in the sky! in view of many things, is hardly accidental. Nor is the opening of Part In, "High on a mountain of enamell'd head," mere chance in its resemblance to the opening of Paradise Lost, book two: "High on a throne of Royal State," as will be seen by Poe's own note of reference to that epic a few lines farther on. While the de- scription of Nesace's palace which follows is not Pandemonium's "Fab- rick huge" which "Rose like an Exhalation," in general theme and man- ner it is definitely in the debt of Paradise Lost, book one. Such locutions as "uprear'd," "What time the moon is quadrated in Heaven," "the sun- lit ether," "While the moon danc'd with the fair stranger light" (almost like one of the Blind Poet's references to the "light denied,"44 "Th' un- burthen'd air," "Parian marble," are followed by the lines: Of molten stars their pavement, such as fall Thro' the ebon air, besilvering the pall Of their own dissolution, while they die- which Poe footnotes with lines from stanza vii of "The Death of a Fair Infant"- "Some star which, from the ruined roof Of shak'd Olympus, by mischance, did fall-Milton" Certainly the "dome by linked light from Heaven let down / Sat gently on these columns as a crown" is the same as Pandemonium's: "Doric the Latin lines, as Killis Campbell points out, from his De Idea Platonica quemadmodum Aristoteles Intellexit, I. 7-10, 25-26. The whole was later used as the first three paragraphs of "A Few Words about Brainard" Graham's, Feb. 1842. 44 See also PL v.395: "Spring and Autumn here / Danc'd hand in hand"; vTT.374: "Dawn and the Pleiades before him danc'd"; and rx.103. 854</page><page sequence="15">Thomas P. Haviland pillars overlaid / With golden Architrave."45 In fact, Poe puts the matter beyond further doubt with the line: "Lurk'd in each cornice, round each architrave." Campbell suggests further parallels here.46 Nesace's lovely song which follows shortly, bidding the "bright be- ings" arise, and calling upon the siren Ligeia to: hie thee away To springs that lie clearest Beneath the moon-ray- To lone lake that smiles In its dream of deep rest, and "arouse them" certainly finds its inspiration in the attendant spirit's fragile appeal (11. 859-889) to "Sabrina fair" to "appear to us" by the Songs of Sirens sweet By dead Parthenope's dear tomb And fair Ligea's golden comb. Whereupon "Sabrina rises, attended by water-nymphs." Two lines in Nesace's song (II.88-89): "(Oh, how, without you, Love! / Could angels be blest?)" suggest Adam's query of Raphael: "Love not the heavenly spirits . . . ?" and the angel's answer "with a smile that glow'd / Celestial rosie red.... 'Let it suffice that thou know'st / Us happie, and without Love no happiness'," (vIII.618-621). As for individual lines, at this point "Young dreams still hovering on their drowsy flight" (II.158) seems clearly a reflection of "Il Penseroso" (147-148): "And let som strange mysterious dream / Wave at his [waver on his?] Wings in Airy stream." Poe himself cites after "Unguided Love hath fallen-'mid 'tears of perfect moan'." There be tears of perfect moan Wept for thee in Helicon. Milton.47 Of lines 221 to 224 Campbell rightly observes "the passage is Miltonic" (p. 191).48 By the same token, four lines later, Ianthe's reassuring words for Angelo, "A brighter dwelling-place is here for thee," seem to be, in substance, lines 462 to 465 of Paradise Lost, Book xI. Angelo's account 45 PL 1.714-715. Interestingly enough, in "Our Amateur Poets, no. 1, Flaccus," Poe cites lines as "perhaps not altogether original with Mr. Ward," but taken from his own Al Aaraaf! 46 Campbell sees as a basis for 1. 20 of this passage, PL II.1004 f.; for "the window of one circular diamond, etc.," the stairway which Milton describes in PL III.503 ff. He finds "Al Aaraaf" I.60 "vaguely suggestive of the immortal scene in the fourth book of Paradise Lost (598 ff.) describing the coming of evening in Paradise." 47 I.181. The lines cited are 56-57 of the "Epitaph for the Marchioness of Winchester." 48 He refers to PL m.418 ff. and 543 ff. 855</page><page sequence="16">How Well Did Poe Know Milton? to Ianthe of his fall is of the same stuff as Satan's flight from Hell-bounds to the Garden: when the air so soft Fail'd, as my pennon'd spirit leapt aloft and he fell-not swiftly as I rose before, But with a downward, tremulous motion thro' Light, brazen rays, this golden star unto!49 and finally: "When first Al Aaraaf knew her course to be Headlong thitherward o'er the starry sea" (II.255-256) certainly it was to become as Satan and his rebellious crew: "Hurled headlong, flaming from th'Etherial Skie." Of the other poems but a few concluding words. One comparing the opening lines of "Tamerlane" with the last lines of the "Nativity Ode," stanza xvi and the first three of stanza xvii will find convincing similari- ties there, far beyond the association of "Love's very hair" and Ne- aera's.50 "Fairyland," appearing two years later, could easily owe "that what d'ye call it" to "the shallow Edwards and Scotch 'What-d'-ye- call' " of the sonnet "On the New Forcers of Conscience." "To Helen's" famed "Nicean barks" may, as W. M. Rossetti thought, be Poe's spelling of Nyseian, leading us to line 275 of Paradise Lost, the fifth book.51 And though we won't insist that "While the dim sheeted ghosts go by" is Milton, Poe has only himself to blame if we pronounce it at least Mil- tonic: The flocking shadows pale, Troop to th'infernall jail, Each fetter'd Ghost slips to his severall grave .. . ("Nat. Ode," xxvI) In that peculiar verse tragedy, "Politian," Lalage sits listlessly at her casement in Rome. Poe cites this very scene as plagiarized in Longfel- low's Spanish Student,52 yet fails to note that his own lady is evidently reading a strangely hashed-up edition of Comus. True, the lines (not quite correct) "It in another climate," so he said, "Bore a bright golden flower, but not i' this soil" (II.7-8) 49 II.231 ff., bearing the tell-tale note: "pennon-for pinion.-Milton." 50 Campbell, p. 154 ("Lycidas," 1. 69). 51 Ibid., pp. 198, 201. 52 "Mr. Poe's Reply to the Letter of Outis," Iv (29 Mar. 1845), Harrison, xiI, 98. 856</page><page sequence="17">Thomas P. Haviland open with quotation marks, but Lalage pauses, turns over some leaves and resumes with three lines from the Odyssey, to close the quotation, sighing sorrowfully "the maiden died"! "Dreamland" certainly feels the magic of "L'Allegro" and "I1 Penseroso," particularly the second and third stanzas with their preponderance of trochaic tetrameter and the unmistakable lines (31-32): By each spot the most unholy- In each nook most melancholy. One cannot feel that "the chill seas / Around the misty Hebrides" of "The Valley of Unrest," are likely to have been, without the previous "sounding seas" that hurled the bones of Lycidas "beyond the stormy Hebrides." So much for the accumulated evidence; yet be it understood, the pur- pose is not to fix upon Poe himself the epithet which he applied to so many others, but rather to arrive at some conclusion as to how great was the familiarity of the one poet with the other. Indeed, Poe should be permitted the final word: It appears to me that what seems to be the gross inconsistency of plagiarism as perpetrated by a poet, is very easily thus resolved:-The poetic sentiment (even without reference to the poetic power) implies a peculiarly, perhaps an abnormally keen appreciation of the beautiful, with a longing for its assimilation, or ab- sorption, into poetic identity. What the poet intensely admires, becomes thus, in very fact, although only partially, a portion of his own intellect. It has a sec- ondary origination within his own soul-an origination altogether apart, al- though springing, from its primary origination from without. The poet is thus possessed by another's thought, and cannot be said to take of it, possession. But, in either view, he feels it as his own-and the feeling is counteracted only by the sensible presence of its true, palpable origin in the volume from which he has derived it.... When the poet has written it, and on its account is charged with plagiarism, there will be no one in the world more entirely astounded than himself.53 UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA Philadelphia 4 APPENDIX The photostat of selected passages from Milton so kindly sent me by Pro- fessor Mabbott is of a MS. deposited in the Poe Foundation at Richmond by the Griswold family.

I quote his letter: "These were collected by Harrison from the files of Graham's Magazine, which Harrison thought Poe edited from January 1841. But we now know Poe began editing only the April number. There is now no prima facie evidence for his authorship of these reviews, and nothing characteristic of Poe in their style. The review of Mrs. Norton is unexpec- tedly enthusiastic, and that of McHenry's Antediluvians greatly at variance with a rather kindly remark in the Autography papers a few months later. I feel sure Poe had no hand in either review. McHenry's denouncers included some of the people Poe loved least, Professor Wilson being a leader."
