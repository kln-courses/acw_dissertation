ISBN: 978-0-521-82720-1. doi : 1 0. 1 0 1 7/S0009840X 1 00003 1 4 This collection of sixteen articles is both the culmination and product of the recent renaissance of interest in Philostratus which is so frequently alluded to within its own pages. With many of the leading names in Second Sophistic scholarship among its list of contributors and what I estimate to be almost a decade's delay in its pub- lication, this volume constitutes a long-anticipated landmark in Philostratean studies. If one central position might be identified in this multifaceted collection, it is that Philostratus' works are paradigmatic of the Second Sophistic's reassertion and renegotiation of classical Greek heritage and Greek cultural identity. This both builds on and perpetuates the general consensus that has emerged over the last 40 years regarding much imperial Greek literature. Two further watchwords are 'complexity' and 'ambiguity', with the contributors frequently identifying previously unheralded literary sophistication and unresolved tensions in the texts. The collection's first division consists of three introductory chapters. Eisner's summarises the issues surrounding Philostratean authorship and subscribes to the view that all the works dealt with in this volume were written by the Philostratus The Classical Review vol. 60 no. 2 © The Classical Association 2010; all rights reserved</page><page sequence="2">398 THE CLASSICAL REVIEW who was active in the Severan court during the early third century c.e. He argues that although the corpus consciously aims at generic diversity, two interrelated preoccupations run throughout the body of his works: sophia in all its forms and the display and spread of Hellenic education (paideia). Bowie's chapter succinctly reconstructs what we know of Philostratus' life. He then considers the corpus in the context of Second Sophistic literature and concludes with a summary of the extant works (in which he incorrectly attributes 48, rather than 65, descriptions to the Imagines). S. Swain's chapter complements Eisner's holistic approach by arguing that the corpus' coherent and central goal is to promote the restoration of ancient cultural standards in the face of social change and threats from Christianity. This is perhaps too single-minded a reading of all these works, ignoring the unresolved tensions and humour that this collection itself identifies. S. concludes with a discussion of the new English translation he provides for the second Dialexis attributed to Philostratus. Section 2 is on Lives of the Sophists (the VS), a set of 59 biographies of soph- ists from the classical and imperial periods. In what is an unusual and refreshing move, T. Schmitz 's chapter subjects the VS to narratological scrutiny. He asserts that Philostratus has constructed the persona of the work's first-person narrator to seem particularly authoritative. This narrator offers no criteria for his claims about the sophists, which leaves the audience with a challenge to its paideia. do they risk revealing their ignorance by criticising the narrator's judgements, or do they show their superior learning by confidently dismissing the narrator? Ultimately Philostratus' intention is ambiguous and ever-shifting. H. Sidebottom makes use of passages from the VS to clarify the differences between philosophers and sophists during the Second Sophistic. Although both professions shared the same rhetorical education and performed many of the same functions, the two roles could not be combined (although S. admits that a man might 'convert' from one profession to the other). S. argues that in terms of their appearance and behaviour, philosophers embodied the image of the outsider, whilst sophists (as members of the urban elite) embodied that of the insider. J. Rife's chapter is a welcome marriage of textual and archaeological analysis. He compares the VS's frequent discussions of the sophists' funerals to what we find in the archaeological record and, at times, Pausanias, to reveal whether Philostratus' (laudatory) presentation of their place in society is correct. Ultimately Philostratus is shown to have exaggerated sophists' status, as their tombs and burial locations reveal a professional group which, complete with their own internal hierarchy, reflected other subsets of the urban elite. Section 3 concerns On Apollonius (VA), the biography of the first-century c.e. holy man from Tyana. V. Platt argues that Philostratus often presents Apollonius as an exegete who educates his audience in the use of phantasia ('imagination') in order to perceive higher (and fundamentally Hellenic) truths when viewing religious art. P. asserts that phantasia is put forward by Apollonius in order to justify the traditional system of Hellenic anthropomorphism particularly against Platonic criti- cisms. J.-J. Flinterman sees Apollonius' connection to Pythagoras as part of the unre- solved tension in the VA between the apologetic and the encomiastic - Philostratus on the one hand defending Apollonius from accusations that he was a sorcerer, whilst simultaneously presenting him as an extraordinary individual. The result is</page><page sequence="3">THE CLASSICAL REVIEW 399 that Philostratus allows seemingly discordant claims about Apollonius' ontological nature to coexist within the work. G.-J. van Dijk, like Flinterman, investigates a commonly recognised but previously uninvestigated aspect of the VA. He asserts that Apollonius and his companions' travels are modelled on those of Odysseus and his men. This is perhaps rather an exclusive reading for such a multilayered and intertextually rich work, but he makes a strong case for the primacy of the Odyssey. A central conclusion is that this intertextuality presents Apollonius as superior to Odysseus as part of the work's encomiastic programme. Section 4 concerns the Heroicus, a dialogue on heroes between a Phoenician merchant and a Greek vinegrower at the sanctuary of Protesilaus in the Thracian Chersonese. Contrary to Swain's reading, Whitmarsh contends that it is naïve to take this work as an earnest invocation of hero cult. Rather it challenges readers to consider where they stand on questions of cultural identity by both subverting their expectations and presenting a past that is vivaciously relevant and attractive and yet physically elusive. I. Rutherford examines the vinegrower 's account of the Thessalians' pilgrimage (theôria) to the Achilleion in the Troad. Through comparison with accounts of theôriai from other sources he finds that the vinegrower 's account lacks historical veracity. He also compares this with the similar account of the theôria to Delphi in Heliodorus' Aithiopica. In both cases he dismisses the details of the pilgrimages but believes that the flawed accounts might have been based on pilgrimages that conformed to a more traditional reality. The fifth section is on the Gymnasticus, a technical treatise offering insights and advice regarding athletics. J. König's chapter argues that much of the Gymnasticus is a rhetorical defence of athletics against criticisms advanced most specifically by Galen. The treatise is also concerned with the corpus' wider project of questioning exactly how to engage with aspects of Hellenic tradition. The result is that the Gymnasticus is to be viewed as a sophisticated piece of literature, with K. warning against viewing it as totally reliable evidence for ancient athletics. Section 6 concerns Philostratus' Love Letters. S. Goldhill's chapter demonstrates the strangeness of Philostratus' collection of 73 predominantly amatory letters when compared with other letter collections. The typical dynamic between the readers and the letters is effected by the anonymity and Protean nature of the narrator and the almost complete lack of narrative and personal names. The result is that the whole collection actually constitutes an educational handbook for fulfilling the role of the educated lover. Section 7 concerns the Imagines, a collection of 65 descriptions (ecphraseis) of paintings by an exegete in Naples to a group of young men and his host's young son. S. Dubel demonstrates that the exegete 's mentions of colour are deployed strategically as part of his display of paideia and florid rhetorical agendas. Z. Newby's chapter deals with the tension between the speaker's educated, detached comments on the paintings and his lapses into viewing the action of the paintings as if it were immediately real. Her assertion that the speaker is unable to escape being deluded by the paintings seems to ignore the self-awareness that permeates both the work's play on text and image and the speakers' relationship with his young addressee. S. Bann argues that Caravaggio's Narcissus is based on the Imagines' description of the youth due to the similarity of the arrangement of Narcissus' hair. Although the chapter might have benefited from a discussion of contemporary hairstyles, his</page><page sequence="4">400 THE CLASSICAL REVIEW assertion rests on the valid observations that Caravaggio's incorporation of these details in an image of Narcissus is without precedent, and that it is likely that Stephanus Niger's 1521 Latin translation of the Imagines was known to Caravaggio and his circle. I have one main criticism of an otherwise superb collection. The Gymnasticus and Letters are two of the most under-represented Philostratean works in modern scholarship and, considering that there have recently been collections dedicated to VA, Imagines and Heroicus,1 it would have made a greater contribution to Philostratean scholarship to have dedicated more than one chapter to each of these works.
