<plain_text><page sequence="1">51 Irish High Crosses : Some Evidence from the Plainer Examples Dorothy Kelly, Member The concept of the high cross is discussed. New estimates of numbers of extant crosses are presented; the range of sizes and the variety of ornament and morphology are indicated. On the evidence of morphology, numbers and distribution, it is suggested that crosses with solid rings constitute a class in their own right. Irish high crosses have been the subject of a wide variety of studies since the mid-nineteenth century when O'Neill published his Illustrations of the Most Interesting of the Sculptured Crosses of Ancient Ireland (1857). Besides the large number of articles and monographs on individual crosses and groups of crosses published since then, notably by Stokes (1898,1901), Crawford (1909,1915,1926,1927) and Roe (1954,1955,1956,1962, 1966, 1981), major studies have been provided by Porter (1931), Henry (1933, 1964) and Sexton (1946). With these major studies, which dealt in a comprehensive manner with large numbers of crosses, may be included Crawford's Lists of Early Irish Crosses (1907, 1908, 1918), which, while eschewing an analytical approach, cover a much wider range of material than the other studies, providing brief descriptions of over 290 crosses, including admittedly 'Late' examples, with outline drawings of fifty-one of these. In the analysis of these monuments, studies to date have relied heavily on an art historical approach, understandably so in that it is their ornament and iconography which have provided the best possibility of assessing the chronology and relationships of the crosses. Yet it may be suggested that this approach has led to the neglect of a large body of evidence, since crosses which are undecorated or carry only minimal ornament, providing little scope for art historical analysis, have been relegated to the position of an obscure penumbra to the body of highly decorated examples, mentioned, if at all, merely in passing (see for example Henry 1967, 136; Hamlin and Hughes 1977, 88). The possible scale of this neglect, at least in numerical terms, will have been apparent to anyone comparing the numbers of crosses listed by Crawford with, for example, the numbers listed by Henry in 1964 (1964, 63-70). Yet, as Herity indicated in 1983 (1983, 276), the plain crosses have been largely ignored as a subject for study since their inclusion by Crawford in his Lists. A study of undecorated crosses of the Early Christian period completed recently (Kelly 1985) indicated that the analysis of these monuments as a part of the class as a whole can provide significant information on aspects of the crosses not previously highlighted. The potential inherent in a study of the total population of crosses, ranging from undecorated to highly decorated examples, 23 Deerpark Road, Mount Merrion, Co. Dublin. JRSAI Vol. 116 (1986): 51-67</page><page sequence="2">52 DOROTHY KELLY is suggested in this article. The group of crosses with solid discs or unpierced rings is selected for extended treatment. The Profile of Irish High Crosses It is valuable to consider initially the profile of the population of Irish high crosses which currently obtains and which has emerged from research concentrating mainly on the more highly decorated examples; three main aspects are relevant here, morphology, numbers and distribution. This profile is most readily available in works which offer a synthesis of the topic. Fran?oise Henry introduced her publication on Irish High Crosses with a chapter on 'General Features', where she offered a description of the form of the monuments: These high crosses are self-contained monuments, articulated into various elements: a large, somewhat cubic or pyramidal base ... a separate block of stone indented with a deep rectangular hollow at the top, into which the stem of the cross can fit securely. The cross itself has a nearly square or rectangular section .... The shaft tapers slightly towards the top. The stone ring which often connects the arms is usually in open-work, but in some cases it has been left as a sort of solid wheel. It is not necessarily always present, but occurs often enough to be considered as a characteristic feature of the Irish crosses. (Henry 1964, 15). The view of the morphology of the crosses presented in Henry's Irish Art in the Early Christian Period to A.D. 800^1965) is essentially the same as that of her 1964 publication but she emphasised that 'the circle is the rule; though in a less absolute way than is generally assumed' (1965, 134) and added some detail relating to the size of the monuments : They do not vary widely in size. Most of them are between 10 and 15 feet in height, including a base of 2 to 3 feet and a finial which in some cases is more than 1 foot high. (Henry 1965, 136). The views propounded by Henry in the 1960s have been changed little in the interim period. Hamlin and Hughes, for example, offer a similar description of the morphology of the crosses : The most usual form is a tall ringed cross set in a shapely base, but within this framework there is much scope for variation .... The size ranges from tall examples, eighteen to twenty feet or more in height, as at Arboe, Monasterboice (West Cross) and Moone, to short, stubby crosses, six to eight feet high, as at Duleek. The head is usually (though not always) ringed, the ring sometimes solid but more usually open .... The most usual shape for the base is a truncated pyramid, though rectangular, cubical and circular bases are also found. (Hamlin and Hughes 1977, 88). On numbers and distribution one again finds substantial common ground in the views expressed by these authors. Henry's List of Carved Stone Crosses (1964, 63-70), which included examples from the eighth to the eleventh/twelfth centuries, suggested that Ireland possessed the remains of approximately 120 crosses and she estimated that</page><page sequence="3">IRISH HIGH CROSSES 53 'there are from sixty to seventy Irish carved crosses or remains of crosses belonging to the pre-Romanesque period' (1964, 13). Hamlin and Hughes conclude that the total of crosses 'must run into three figures' (1977, 87). Neither Hamlin and Hughes nor Henry offer any detailed analysis or explanation of the distribution patterns of the crosses. Both treat the monuments as a single, undifferentiated group in this respect, Hamlin and Hughes restricting their remarks to comments on their 'oddly uneven' distribution which concentrates in the midlands and the east (1977, 87). Henry, noting this distinctive distribution, was not hopeful that any meaning could be made of the pattern, asserting that 'what we have is only what remains after centuries of destruction of all kinds, distributed in an erratic pattern from which some of the most important monuments may well be missing' (1964, 21). The profile of the population of high crosses presented by Henry in the early 1960s and confirmed by Hamlin and Hughes at the end of the 1970s has not been seriously questioned in any other publication on the topic. The view of Irish high crosses articulated by Henry over twenty years ago as a group of monuments numbering a little in excess of one hundred, with a distinctive but unexplained distribution pattern and a particular morphological character which normally includes a ring, most usually open or pierced, still stands today. Assessing Total Populations The purpose of my study completed in 1985 was to catalogue and evaluate those undecorated crosses which might be ascribed to the Early Christian period, including the eleventh and twelfth centuries. The crosses were assigned to the period on the basis of four main variables : (i) morphological similarities to those features characteristically found in the group of better-known decorated crosses, (ii) typical carved ornament which is sometimes found on small decorative features, bosses or small panels at the centre of the head for example, on otherwise undecorated crosses, (iii) siting at an extant church site, on an historically recorded ecclesiastical site or where other archaeological remains provide evidence of the existence of an ecclesiastical site in the Early Christian period; and additionally where the siting suggests adherence to a hypothetical rule of siting in positions possibly delimiting a sanctified area around the church (Herity 1983, 270-79), (iv) the orientation of the crosses which, it was noted in the course of the study, not only adhere to a general east/west orientation (Henry 1964, 20) but are more particularly orientated so that the main face of the monument is that which faces west. Part of the evaluation of these plainer crosses concentrated on their relationship to the decorated examples. For this purpose these latter crosses were also briefly catalogued; thus virtually a total survey of all known monuments of the type was undertaken. In all a maximum of just over three hundred crosses or fragments of crosses were recorded at 151 sites throughout the country. Since it is possible that at some sites multiple fragments represent the remains of a fewer number of actual crosses, or that crosses and bases</page><page sequence="4">54 DOROTHY KELLY now separate may originally have belonged together, it was estimated that the three hundred crosses or fragments probably represent a smaller number of actual crosses, perhaps about two hundred and seventy in all. This is a great increase on the figure of approximately one hundred and twenty crosses documented by Henry in 1964 and mapped by her at 75 sites (Henry 1965, 137; 1967, 135). Apart from a few previously little-known decorated crosses and a handful of new discoveries made since the 1960s the increase is entirely due to the inclusion of the plainer crosses. The survey of all known remains of high crosses further highlighted the great diversity present within the group, a diversity which the concentration on highly decorated examples has tended to obscure. This diversity is to be seen in the variety of approaches to ornamentation and size, and variations in morphology. The survey further indicated that the consideration of the total population of crosses can provide new information on aspects which previously have been assessed on the evidence of the partial sample of decorated crosses, in some instances without achieving any satisfactory conclusions, as in the case of distribution patterns. Decorated and Undecorated Crosses The terms undecorated and decorated, while useful as a form of shorthand in making a distinction between individual monuments, are quite inadequate in representing the great range of decorative approaches to be found on the crosses. The range is perhaps best viewed as a continuum which includes : (a) crosses which are undecorated. Decoration is here taken to be carved orna ment, geometric or anthropomorphic. Some crosses with plain edge-mouldings or plain raised bosses at the centre of the head are considered undecorated, (b) crosses otherwise undecorated but with limited areas of carved geometric ornament, on bosses or roundels or in small panels at the extremities of the arms, for example. (Included in this group are eight crosses which have some element of figure sculpture, a feature usually only associated with highly decorated examples but in these cases found on otherwise undecorated crosses, at Tully, county Dublin, and Fassaroe, county Wicklow, and on one face of the N cross at Monasterboice, county Louth, for example), (c) crosses which bear ornament which is restricted to certain areas of the surface, typically a single face or the head of the cross, (d) crosses where the ornament comprises of loosely interlocked geometric designs dispersed over the surface to give an overall ornamental appearance while leaving large areas of the background plain, (e) crosses which are highly ornamented on all four faces or the main broad faces, the well-known classic examples of the high cross. This analysis of the range of approaches to ornament is not put forward as any form of rigid classification but rather as a means of drawing attention to the great variety which exists within the total population of crosses. A further dimension may be added by an assessment of the numerical strength of each of the groups. One hundred and eighty-two crosses, excluding cross bases, are sufficiently well preserved to permit one to assign them to these groups with some confidence. Of these 30% are undecorated</page><page sequence="5">IRISH HIGH CROSSES 55 ^////y^ 1811 s/ Decorated Crosses Fig. 1 Range of ornament on high crosses; percentage representation of groups a-e in sample population. (a) and 44% are highly decorated (e); of the remainder 16% are plain except for very restricted ornamental features (b), while 10% have carving restricted to specific areas of the surface or have loosely arranged geometric designs ornamenting but not completely covering the surfaces (c and d) (Fig. 1). Within this sample, which constitutes two-thirds of the suggested total population, highly decorated crosses are thus the largest group but undecorated crosses represent a considerable proportion of the total while crosses with some ornament, but falling short of the classic highly decorated range, constitute 26% of the total. To return to a more polarized view one might reconstitute the groups to form two large sub-groups of plainer (groups a and b) and more ornate (groups c, d and e) crosses, comprising of 46% and 54% of the total, respectively. 'High' Crosses The first recorded use of the term 'High Cross' is found in the Annals of the Four Masters', there under the year 957 it is recorded that 'The Termon of Ciarain was burned this year, from the High Cross to the Sinainn, both corn and mills' (O'Donovan 1851, Vol. II, 677). The term as employed at present seems not to have gained currency until the latter part of the 19th and the early 20th century when it was used equally with 'sculptured crosses', 'ancient stone crosses', 'early Irish crosses' and 'Celtic crosses'. It was not until after the middle of this century that the term 'high cross' attained its present currency, possibly due to its use by such influential writers as Henry and Roe. The designation high cross is used in this article in deference to the prevailing terminology but not without some reservations. As employed in the literature it usefully defines this particular group of free-standing monuments and distinguishes between these and other monuments which are sometimes loosely termed crosses, i.e. cross-slabs and</page><page sequence="6">56 DOROTHY KELLY 12- r-?-1?|-1 - 11 10 9 8-r?I co7--rr~ I 6--? i?i?i?I? - - -.

Decorated crosses indicated by shading. grave-markers, and between these Early Christian free-standing crosses and those of other periods, later medieval crosses for example. It thus has very specific connotations in that it defines a class of monuments and further implies attributes which are common to all members of the class. It is in relation to these implied attributes that some reservations may be expressed. What are the implications of the use of word 'high' in regard to these monuments? It may be suggested that the term has implications for the actual size of the monuments; Hamlin (1987, 139) suspects that the reference to the 'high cross' at Clonmacnois in 957 was to differentiate between a tall cross and other crosses at the site. It is a plausible interpretation and it does seem that in the modern use of the term some reflection of this implication of impressive physical stature is to be found, Hamlin and Hughes for example considered crosses six feet in height to be 'stubby' (1977, 87). Henry (1967,136), acknowledging the existence of smaller crosses, seemed to make a distinction between these and taller examples when she added 'few examples have survived because they were even more vulnerable than the high crosses' (my italics). Size is a difficult variable to assess since a large number of crosses are now in a damaged or fragmentary condition. Nevertheless a sufficient number of complete or near complete crosses remain for one to be able to suggest the range of sizes probably present in the original population. Figure 2 shows the range of sizes of 85 complete or near-complete crosses (the latter missing their capstones), 50 plain, 35 decorated; this sample represents 31% of the suggested total remains of 270 monuments. The range of heights indicated is from 51 cm to 6.75 metres. The smallest cross (Kilmokea, county Wexford, PI. 8b) is 56</page><page sequence="7">IRISH HIGH CROSSES 57 cm high, the tallest (Monasterboice W, county Louth) 6.67 metres. Within this extended range it will be noted that the greater bulk of crosses (74) is found within the more restricted range of 1 to 4 metres where there is a fairly even distribution of crosses within the 25 centimetre bands chosen with a slight peak at 325 to 350 cm. Thirteen crosses are now missing their capstones; these fall within the range 1.76 to 5.50 metres; the exclusion of these crosses would leave the general pattern of heights unchanged, merely altering slightly the numbers in some of the bands. In no case would the numbers in these bands be altered by more than three examples. This sample may well reflect with reasonable accuracy the original profile of heights within the total population; the fact that the exclusion of crosses missing capstones makes no difference to the general pattern seems to support this suggestion. It would appear therefore that the preferred range of sizes lay between 1 and 4 metres with only a few exceptional monuments, most of them taller than 4 metres, lying outside this range. This analysis suggests that previous estimates of the range of heights of high crosses have not taken account of crosses at the lower end of the scale. As Figure 2 indicates this may be attributable to the neglect of the plainer examples which are the only crosses found in the range 1.00 to 1.50 metres and the majority of those in the range 1.50 to 3.00 metres. The term 'high cross', in view of its implied attribute of impressive height, may not be the ideal nomenclature to embrace the total population of these monuments, including as it does many of quite insignificant height. The case demonstrates a situation where a terminology developed in the initial stages of research no longer seems as appropriate when the full range of attributes becomes clear. It is not suggested here that the term high cross should be abandoned, rather it is suggested that our concept of the high cross be broadened to include the total population, including small examples. The Typical Irish High Cross It is in the area of the morphology of the crosses that perhaps the most significant advances can be made from the study of total populations. Implicit in the descriptions of the morphological characteristics offered by Henry and Hamlin and Hughes is a two-fold classification of the crosses into ringed crosses and unringed crosses; also implied is some sub-division of the ringed class into groups with open rings and solid rings, the former seen as the more typical and numerous form. As with other aspects already discussed this is a valid picture based on the evidence of the highly decorated examples; however, the inclusion of the plainer examples changes the balance suggested by previous research. Of the total of approximately 270 crosses or fragments of crosses 180 are sufficiently complete to permit of classification as either ringed or unringed. Of these 51 (28%) are unringed, 129 (72%) have either open or solid rings. These proportions are not out of line with the pattern suggested by Henry (1965, 134) except that the 28% representation of unringed crosses is more impressive than one might have been led to expect from her comments. At over one quarter of the total they constitute a significant sub-group. Further analysis of the group of crosses with rings indicates that those with solid rings also form a much more significant group within the total population than has previously been suggested. Of the 129 ringed crosses, 61 (47%) are crosses with solid rings, while just 68 (53%), are those crosses with open-work rings traditionally regarded as the</page><page sequence="8">58 DOROTHY KELLY 'typical' Irish or 'Celtic' cross form. The numerical strength of the crosses with solid rings suggests that they deserve to be regarded as a separate class rather than as an adjunct to the group with open-work rings. If this group is accepted as a valid class and the weight of the class of crosses without rings is taken into consideration, then the group of high crosses as a whole takes on a morphological profile with quite a different balance to that formerly suggested. In fact there is a remarkably even division of the total classifiable remains between the three groups : unringed crosses (28%), crosses with solid rings (34%) and crosses with open-work rings (38%). Crosses with open-work rings, hitherto regarded as the majority group, thus constitute only a little over one-third of the total population. While destruction has no doubt left us with a less than complete record of the high crosses (Henry 1964, 21) there is no reason to assume differential destruction of types of crosses. The modern pattern may thus be taken broadly to reflect the early historic situation. That this pattern has not previously been noted is undoubtedly due to the neglect of the plainer crosses since these plain examples are a considerable component of both the unringed and solid-ringed groups, 67% and 69% respectively. The group of crosses with open-work or pierced rings, on the other hand, contains a much higher proportion of decorated examples (73%); thus the high profile of the decorated crosses may well have been responsible for the equally high profile of the form of cross with pierced ring. The analysis of the total population of about 270 crosses, including 46% of plainer examples which have been neglected in the past, suggests that parameters of size and numerical strength, previously defined on the basis of the limited sample of highly decorated crosses, were too restricted in scope. The Irish high crosses are a more numerous and much more varied group than has previously been appreciated and this variety includes a diverse approach to ornamentation. The isolation of the solid-ringed cross as a class in its own right is one of the more important results of this analysis. This has wider implications for the study of high crosses than merely the identification of a particular morphological type; this group has therefore been selected here for a more detailed discussion. Solid-Ringed Crosses This group of crosses is united by the feature of an unpierced ring or solid disc on the head of the cross. This solid ring takes the place of the open-work ring which is regarded as characteristic of the Irish series of high crosses. If the reason for the use of the pierced ring is obscure (6 Riord?in 1940 and references) the preference for a solid disc may be regarded as even more puzzling. With an open ring at least the cruciform element of the cross remains pronounced but with a solid disc this element is obscured, especially when the monument is viewed from a distance. In some cases, indeed, the sculptor appears not to have seen it as necessary to include a basic cruciform element and the cross takes the shape of a disc on a shaft with the arms developing not from the shaft but from the edge of the disc (Ballymore Eustace, county Kildare, Sleaty, county Laois, Aghowle, county Wicklow, for example, PI. 5a). In other cases it seems that the sculptors, conscious of the obscuring of the cross form, made some attempt to lessen the impact of the solid ring; at Burgage, county Kildare, (PI. 5b) the solid ring is of unusually small diameter relative to the armspan, at Ferns, county Wexford, the cruciform element has been given pronounced edge-mouldings while the solid ring has not, thus emphasising the basic cross shape. On a few crosses the deep recessing of the</page><page sequence="9">IRISH HIGH CROSSES 59 area of the ring within the hollowed angles creates areas of dark shadow helping to define the cruciform element (PI. 5c). The argument for considering these crosses as a separate class rests initially on their distinctive morphology; this is supported by their numerical strength, constituting as they do 34% of the total classifiable population of high crosses. However, there are a number of features which suggest that these crosses are closely related to the group of crosses with pierced or open-work rings. The morphological forms of the two types are similar, typically both include a trapezoidal or pyramidal base, a cruciform element of broad rectangular section and a profile which displays the characteristic hollowing of the angles of the cruciform element within the ring. There are, inevitably, some exceptions to these general rules. Some solid-ringed crosses lack a base or have an integral plinth rather than a separate base, others lack hollowed angles; the cross near the Cathedral in Glendalough for example has an integral plinth and right-angled 'armpits'; the majority however conform to the characteristics outlined above. One element quite frequently found on crosses with open-work rings is a capstone (29 instances known), a feature not often seen on crosses with solid rings. No solid-ringed cross retains a capstone and only five of these crosses show evidence, in the form of tenons or mortice holes on the upper shaft, of the former existence of this feature: Aghowle and Burgage, county Wicklow, Ballymore Eustace, county Kildare, Tynan (Well Cross), county Armagh, and one at Ferns, county Wexford. There are, however, crosses with pierced rings which also lack capstones, including those at Castledermot, county Kildare, and the North cross at Monasterboice, county Louth. The main morphological differences between the two groups of ringed crosses lie in the range of sizes and the treatment of the ring. While the group with pierced rings has its share of smaller examples the majority are in excess of 1.50 m high. The group with solid rings contains examples which match those with pierced rings towards the taller end of the range, Burgage, county Wicklow (4.41 m) and Drumadonnell, county Down (3.58 m), for example, but this group has a more sizeable percentage of modestly-sized crosses, at least 30% of them under 3 m in height. The difference in the treatment of the ring is largely confined to the lack of piercing; in other respects the rings on solid-ringed crosses differ little from those on crosses with pierced rings. The size of the ring relative to other elements of the cross, armspan or total height, is very similar in both groups. The practice of recessing the ring so that it is of lesser depth than the shaft and arms can be demonstrated for both groups. More importantly there are details of the treatment of some of the solid rings which are anomalous in the context of the lack of piercing and which suggest that in the working of these rings the sculptors were looking to examples with pierced rings. One such is the use of double raised edge-mouldings on the ring, one defining the outer edge, the second defining what on a pierced ring would be the inner edge of the ring but which on a solid ring serves no purpose other than decorative (PL 6a). Another is the presence of cylindrical mouldings or billets on the 'armpit' of the cross or on the inner edge of the ring; these objects, which may reflect the influence of examplars in other media (Allen 1904, 190; Harbison 1977, 287), being probably skeumorphs of constructional features used in metalwork to cover rivets, dramatically affect the profile of crosses with open-work rings but become a purely ornamental feature on those with solid rings (PI. 6b). Finally there is on solid-ringed crosses the device of recessing the area of the disc between the inner edge-moulding and the hollowed angles; this recessing is frequently deep, often stopping just short of piercing the disc completely. All of these features,</page><page sequence="10">60 DOROTHY KELLY but particularly the last, suggest an acknowledgement of the cultural 'correctness' of the pierced ring on the part of the sculptors of at least some of the crosses with solid rings. Ornament The majority of crosses with solid rings are undecorated crosses. The small percentage which may be assigned to the decorated groups c-e have typical carvings of geometric ornament or scripture scenes; these are demonstrably closely related to similarly carved crosses with pierced rings. A sizeable proportion (39%) of the plainer solid-ringed crosses, and a few of those with largely geometric ornament, feature bosses in relief or related details such as roundels or rectilinear panels at the centre of the head of the cross; a few have sunken circular or rectilinear panels which may conceivably have held separate ornaments, possibly bosses (such as the metal bosses which are thought to have been placed originally in the circular recessed features on the west face of St John's cross on Iona (RCHAMS 1982, 203), or like the wooden boss possibly from a high cross in this material found during excavations at Wood Quay, Dublin (Wallace 1984, 123)). In possessing these decorative features on one or both of the two main faces these crosses also appear to be closely related to crosses with pierced rings, of which 17% also have bosses, roundels or rectilinear panels on the head. Such features may,as suggested by Henry (1965, 140) and Harbison (1977, 284-288), indicate the imitation of prototypes in other media, specifically metal work, where similar bosses would have covered constructional details. Harbison (1977, 286-288) has analysed the distribution of high crosses with these distinctive facial features, contrasting their distribution with crosses which have cylindrical mouldings on armpit or ring, and further contrasting these two distributions with that of crosses which possess neither of these features. He suggests that the occurrences of bosses and cylindrical mouldings 'seem to be mutually exclusive' (p. 287); he further suggests that each of the three groups has its own 'geographic concentration, though distributionally the groups are by no means mutually exclusive' (1977, 188). On the basis of this analysis be suggests that the three groups probably derive from different metal prototypes. Harbison's analysis appeals to be based on a less than total sample. His contention that bosses and roll-mouldings are mutually exclusive is contradicted by the evidence of crosses at Eglish and Tynan, county Armagh (Roe 1954, 111; 1955, 113-4), Clogher, county Tyrone (PI. 6b), Castlekeeran, county Meath, and Inishcealtra, county Clare, all of which have both bosses and cylindrical mouldings. (This last cross Harbison unaccountably includes in his group of crosses with neither bosses nor cylindrical mouldings; he similarly assigns to this group the cross at Bealin which has on its W face the remains of bosses of similar form to those on the S cross at Clonmacnois). The recognition of these examples has the further effect of diluting the geographic concentrations suggested by Harbison. While the evidence for possible influences of metal prototypes on the stone crosses is accepted by this writer it may be contended, on the basis of the analysis of the total population of crosses, that more specific reasons existed for the change from the use of bosses and roundels on the head, to the use of cylindrical mouldings on the armpits and ring, and that this may have chronological rather than spatial implications, as may have been intimated by Henry (1964, 15). An analysis of ringed crosses with facial features</page><page sequence="11">IRISH HIGH CROSSES 61 such as bosses, the majority of them crosses with solid rings, indicates that they belong to one of three groups: (a) Undecorated or plain crosses (at Kilkieran, county Kilkenny, Castlekeeran, county Meath, Nurney, county Carlow, for example). (b) Decorated crosses where the ornament is largely of geometric/zoomorphic ornament (at Ahenny, county Tipperary, Kilkieran, county Kilkenny, for example). (c) Crosses with sculpted figure scenes where these scenes are restricted to specific areas of the surfaces, one face of the shaft at Clonmacnois (S cross), also at Kilree and Killamery, county Kilkenny, Inishcealtra, county Clare, and Dromiskin, county Louth. Notably absent from these groups are the large numbers of crosses in the full scripture tradition where the faces of the head are taken up by representations of Christ in majesty, the Crucifixion, the Fall etc. The inclusion of facial features such as bosses would have been inimical to the use of the head for these large scenes. On this evidence it may be suggested that the advent of crosses in the full scripture tradition necessitated the change from bosses to cylindrical mouldings, the latter frequently seen on crosses of this tradition. If, however, these mouldings are best seen as skeumorphs of constructional features in metalwork it is possible the change occurred initially in works in that medium. Such a possibility allows a further speculation that metalwork crosses with figure scenes similar to those on the high crosses, covering the face of the head, existed at this period although none such are now known. It is notable that a number of the crosses with facial features such as bosses belong to a stratum generally regarded as having an early date, Ahenny, county Tipperary, Kilkieran, county Kilkenny, for example. Regardless of origins or influences, this feature, found early in the tradition of high crosses, though largely lost in the scripture group because of new priorities, is a strong component of the ornament of crosses with solid rings. This does not necessarily indicate that solid-ringed crosses with central facial features are all of an early date, although some may be. It does however suggest that they perpetuate an early tradition, otherwise lost, this being possible because so many of these crosses are of the plainer variety without scripture scenes; they may thus represent a continuous development from the earliest examples. The Distribution of Solid-Ringed Crosses The historic treatment of high crosses as a single undifferentiated group has failed to produce any satisfactory explanations for their distinctive distribution. Any number of factors influencing distribution patterns may be proposed and the intermeshing of these factors can suggest a complexity which appears to defy solution. While no advance on the question of the gross distribution pattern can be offered, it can be argued that the pattern as it exists today is not as incapable of explanation as Henry suggested (1964, 21). In many of the details of morphology and ornament outlined above, it has been noted that solid-ringed crosses may be closely compared to those with open-work rings. The validity of classifying them as a separate group may therefore seem to be open to question since the only significant difference appears to be in the treatment of the ring.

The results of this exercise support the hypothesis that the two belong to separate classes. Firstly it is of note that only at two sites, Kilfenora, county Clare, and Glenarb, county Armagh (crosses now found at Tynan and Caledon; Reeves 1884 supplies evidence of the removal of these crosses from Glenarb), do we know of instances of the co-existence of solid-ringed and pierced-ring crosses. As Figure 3 indicates, the geographic distribution of solid-ringed crosses shows a similar tendency to stand apart from that of crosses with pierced rings. Crosses with unpierced rings have a heavy south-eastern distribution with a further, less dense, linear distribution in south-east and south mid-Ulster with some representation in Donegal, Sligo, Clare and South Tipperary. Only three examples of solid-ringed crosses are found in North Leinster and the midlands, the heartland of the type with pierced ring. The most marked boundary between the two forms occurs in south Leinster, where the distribution of crosses with pierced rings ends in an abrupt line on the edge of the distribution of crosses with solid rings. A variety of factors was considered in assessing these patterns, including the possible impact of cultural and political influences. However, the most persuasive explanation for the discrete distributions of the two classes of ringed crosses relates to the availability of materials. The overlaying of the two distributions on a map of the solid geology of the country (Fig. 4 a,b) demonstrates a very close relationship between the separate distributions and the types of stone available for quarrying within these localities. Crosses with solid rings are found very largely in areas where quarried sandstone is locally unavailable and not close enough to be easily transported, and where the local stones are granite, shale, slate or schist. The vast majority of crosses with solid rings are sculpted from these less tractable materials; only those at Clogher and Caledon, county Tyrone, and Tynan (Well Cross), county Armagh, all of which may be tenth century or later in date, and that at Ballynilard, county Tipperary, are made from sandstone. It may well be that by the time these crosses were being carved the solid ring had become culturally acceptable rather than being, as its distribution suggests, a device imposed by the lack of easily worked stone, the sculptors opting to leave the ring unpierced because of the intractability or unreliability of the material. Conversely, crosses with pierced rings are usually found in areas where sandstone is locally available or within easy reach (Henry 1964,15-16). The majority are cut from this more easily worked material; just a few, at Castledermot, Kildare and Moone, county Kildare, and Donaghmore, county Down, for example, are of granite; none appear to have been made from the least reliable materials, shales or slates. Some crosses with pierced rings found in Clare and Aran are of limestone and have regularly circular piercing, possibly drilled, a method which may have overcome the technical problems associated with perforating the rings in crosses of this material. It may be that other slight differences noted between solid-ringed and pierced-ring crosses also relate to the materials used. The higher proportion of solid-ringed crosses of modest size and the dearth of capstones in this class might also be related to the difficulties inherent in working unreliable stone. It is interesting that granite, difficult to work but probably more reliable than shales, is the stone used for some of the largest solid-ringed crosses, Burgage and Ballymore Eustace, county Kildare, for example, and that these crosses also had capstones.</page><page sequence="15">IRISH HIGH CROSSES 65 A Group of Carlow Crosses One small group of plain solid-ringed crosses in county Carlow is worthy of special attention. One of these crosses, at Killogan in Garryhundon townland, has recently been discussed in an article by Fanning (1984, 43-9). He designates this cross as one of a sub-type of the so-called 'Granite or Barrow Group' linking it with the solid-ringed crosses at Nurney and Kildreenagh, the pierced-ring cross at Old Leighlin and cross-bases at Agha, all in Carlow. He suggests a general date of late eighth to early tenth century for this sub-group, based apparently on dates usually advanced for crosses such as Moone, Castledermot and Old Kilcullen, county Kildare. While the area of the Barrow Valley is notably rich in remains of high crosses and the terms used by Fanning have a long history in the literature (Henry 1967, 148; de Paor 1978, 150) it may be misleading to allude to the crosses found here as a 'group' since they include many disparate monuments which may vary considerably in date; the evidence of the pyramidal base at Bray, county Wicklow (Crawford 1907, 234), so closely related to that at Moone, county Kildare, one of the 'Barrow Group', further suggests a more widespread distribution than is implied by the nomenclature. On the question of the Garryhundon cross the comparanda offered by Fanning are rather diverse: the monument at Nurney is in fact the only one which can be validly compared with that at Garryhundon; he further seems to be unaware of the remains of two other crosses, at Tullow and Orchard, also in Carlow, which are closely related to those two already mentioned. The head of a badly-weathered solid-ringed cross in the churchyard at Nurney may be the remains of a further example. These crosses are morphologically very similar: all are solid-ringed, three have similar raised bosses at the centre of the head, two, Garryhundon and Tullow, have panels of fret ornament restricted to the narrow sides of the arnjs. The feature which unites the group, however, is the characteristic continuation of the edge-moulding which defines the ring across the face of the cross where it may be traced crossing the arms and upper and lower shaft (Pis. 6c, 7a-c). The clustering of these crosses within a radius of about 6 miles further underlines the close relationship of the group. The distinctive morphology and ornament of the crosses and their close geographic distribution suggest that they may, indeed, be products of a single workshop. Some comparanda may be offered for the feature of the 'imposed ring' seen on the Garryhundon and related crosses. The feature is also found on the cross at Finglas, county Dublin (PI. 8a), and may be compared to the imposed rings seen on the west cross at Clonmacnois and the north cross at Duleek; on the latter two crosses the ring is 'fixed' in place by medallions, a feature not seen on the Carlow and Dublin crosses. Crosses with imposed rings are also found in Britain, mostly along the western seaboard in Cumbria and Cheshire; these appear to date to the Viking period (Bailey 1980,177-8). Only one of the Irish crosses with imposed rings may be relatively closely dated, that at Clonmacnois, which, on the basis of its inscription, is probably of early tenth century date (Henry 1980, 45, controverting Harbison 1979). The similarity of the concept of the imposed ring on the Carlow crosses suggests that they are not too far divorced in time from that at Clonmacnois. Some suspicion of an even later date is raised by the presence of a large, worn, protruding boss on the base now supporting the cross-head at Orchard. This might be compared to the human heads seen on the base of the cross at Fassaroe, county Wicklow, for which a date in the twelfth century has been suggested by 6 hEailidhe (1958, 110). Since it is possible, however, that the base at Orchard does not belong with the cross-head this must remain in the realms of speculation.</page><page sequence="16">66 DOROTHY KELLY The comparative material thus suggests that the Killogan and related crosses are likely to date to the late ninth or tenth century. Fanning argues that the cross at Killogan is indicative of monastic activity in the area. The period in which such activity took place, if it is to be related to the erection of the cross at the site, is more likely to have been later rather than earlier in the late eighth to early tenth century time-span suggested by him. The Chronology of Solid-Ringed Crosses There has been a tendency to regard solid-ringed crosses as predominantly late in date (de Paor 1958, 151). The assessing of the dates of these crosses is not helped by the fact that such a large number are plain crosses which are not generally susceptible to close dating. Certain indications of date based on loosely-fixed points may be suggested. The solid-ringed cross at Dromiskin, with similar anthropomorphic carvings to those seen at Killamery and Kilree, may belong, like these, to the late eighth or early ninth century (Henry 1965, 139-43). It may be that the cross at Kilquiggin, county Wicklow (PL 8c), with its superb triskele comparable to those found on early metalwork pieces {cf the Ardagh Chalice, detail reproduced in Rynne 1987, PL 1), is also of an early date, perhaps the eighth century. Other crosses of this class belong to the tradition which has carved scripture scenes and may thus be assigned to a ninth/tenth century dating spectrum. As already indicated the crosses at Garryhundon, Tullow, Orchard and Nurney are probably best assigned a date in the late ninth or tenth century. Other examples such as the Doorty cross at Kilfenora and that at Killaloe in Clare indicate the existence of this type into the eleventh/twelfth century. Crosses with solid rings therefore seem to have been an integral part of the whole high cross tradition in Ireland, probably from an early period. They constitute one-third of the known total of classifiable high crosses and are the only type of ringed cross found in the south-eastern corner of the country, in counties Wicklow and Wexford; with a single exception (Old Leighlin), they are also the only ringed crosses found in county Carlow. The evidence suggests that these crosses were erected within the same time-span as those with pierced rings, the absence of the latter within the main distribution area of solid-ringed crosses in south Leinster supporting this suggestion. The two groups share so many common characteristics that it seems that they are parallel traditions, the essential difference in the treatment of the ring being a result of the need to overcome the difficulties inherent in sculpting the unreliable local stone.
