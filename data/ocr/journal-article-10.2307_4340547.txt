<plain_text><page sequence="1">Gods of the Gentiles. By GEORGE C. RING. Pages 343. Bruce Publishing Company, Milwaukee 1938 In clear, non-technical, but always adequate fashion, Doctor Ring describes the religions of the great cul- tural nations of pagan antiquity. The period covered is some three millennia before the coming of Christ. The scene of the action is the Mediterranean region. While the work is popular in tone, with flashes of genial humor throughout, it is strictly scientific. The author's purpose has been to present a purely objective account with no intrusion of religious apologetics. However he does not fail to level criticism at works otherwise learned and judicious which would find in the worship of the Egyptian triad Isis, Serapis, and Horus a basis for familiarizing the ancients with the idea of the triune God of Christianity. There is no less censure for the Christian apologete who in study- ing pagan cults tries to defend or confirm the divinely revealed origin of Christianity. Even though the field of the history of religions touches closely the field of revealed religion, the same scientific attitude must be maintained as in the pursuit of other branches of knowledge. The book is divided into five sections treating re- spectively the religion of the Assyro-Babylonians, the Persians, the Egyptians, the Greeks, and the Romans. There is first a concise and adequate treatment of the historic background of the Tigris-Euphrates valley. In view of the lushness of material, Doctor Ring's selec- tive judgment would satisfy the most ardent fan of 'Digests'. There follows a sketch of the gods and heroes who won the loyalty of the various peoples in- habiting successively the cradle of Mediterranean cul- ture. The significance of cults and myths is discussed and defined as far as existing evidence warrants. The religions of Persia and Egypt are treated in about the same way. All three divisions are accompanied by outlines in graphic form of the barest essentials of the chronological history of each country. The treatment of the Greek religion is slightly different, since it is, as Professor Farnell says, "almost co-extensive with the study of Greek literature." There is an exceptionally informing chapter on the Gods of Homer followed by Hesiod the Theologian, Apollo and the Mystics, Dawn of the Golden Age, Gods and Philosophers. In this developmental series of the history of religious thought in Greece, Doctor Ring shows very forcibly that the pure element of religion is more evident in primitive religions, and that the growth of anthropomorphic myth causes a devolution of religious insight. The his- tory of Roman religious thought is traced in the Reign of the Numina and the Di Indigites with the accom- panying development of honor, justice, and decency of life. Then the engrafting of the Greek system shows on Roman soil the same moral breaking-up that had occurred in Greece. This is followed by the Religious Psychology of the Hannibalic War, which in postwar days brought a profound alteration in the temperament and views of the people. The Reforms of Augustus, The Deified Emperors, and The Oriental Cults at Rome complete a full and excellent exposition of the religious experience of the Roman people.
