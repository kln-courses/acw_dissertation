<plain_text><page sequence="1">NEMI AND THE GOLDEN BOUGH1 BY SAMUEL C. CHEW On one of the first days of spring we went out across the Campagna by the Via Appia Nuova. Before us the Alban Hills were partially shrouded in mist, but as we began the long ascent the clouds were breaking. We passed through Albano and Aricia, over deep gorges to Genzano, where we inquired the way to Nemi, and by muddy back streets came suddenly upon a path which sloped steeply to the lake nestled in the hills. We lingered on the hillside to pick some of the violets and crocuses that were scattered thickly along the vineclad terraces. In half an hour we reached the border of the lake where the breeze sent tiny waves to break among the pebbles. By midday we were beneath the walls and campanile of the town of Nemi, dominating the heights on the side of the lake opposite that from which we had come. The mellow noontide bells of Genzano were answered sweetly by those of Nemi. As we followed the path along the shore, we thought of those so contrasting pilgrims who by night long ago had one after the other, at longer or shorter intervals, skirted stealthily "Diana's Mirror" on a ghastly quest; and of the priest of Diana who, with drawn sword and peering warily, had watched for the coming of the man stronger than he who should slay him as he had slain his predecessor. We thought, too, of an other quest, which had begun at the sanctuary of Diana Nemoren sis and had led far away in time and space from Nemi. For at the beginning of The Golden Bough Sir James Frazer promises his readers "the interest and charm of a voyage of dis covery, in which we shall visit strange foreign lands." "The wind is in the shrouds," he says; "we shake out our sails to it, and leave the coast of Italy behind us for a time." Yet when he first applied himself to the solution of the problems: Why was the 11 have borrowed a few sentences in this article from my review of the new abridged edition of The Golden Bough, published in The Nation.?S. C. C.</page><page sequence="2">NEMI AND THE GOLDEN BOUGH 815 succession to the office of priest of Diana determined by mortal combat? and Why, before the aspirant to the office might attack the incumbent, must he pluck the golden bough from the tree beside the temple? Frazer had apparently no idea of the tortuous length of the quest before him. For the first edition of his book was in but two volumes, while the third and definitive edition is in twelve. The Golden Bough has put down branches into the ground in many directions and has become "a golden banyan tree". The forest is of such density that at times it is difficult to force a way through the tangled undergrowths. One result of Frazer's many years of patient investigation is an anthology of unique interest. We are, as it were, in a dark-room, where the magic lantern throws curious and melancholy pictures upon the screen. A priest, accompanied by his leman, is seen in the ruined church at midnight, where he mumbles the mass back ward. In place of wine he uses ditchwater; and though he makes the sign of the Cross, it is with his left foot and upon the ground. This is the Mass of Saint S?caire, and the man for whom it is said will surely die. A crowd of Sicilian peasants, during a great drought, pitch their saints into the parched gardens to view the havoc they have wrought by their negligence; the people threaten the image of Sant' Angelo with frenzied cries of "Rain or the Rope!" The scene shifts to Bohemia, and we see the image of Death hustled out of the village and tumbled unceremo niously into the water. A moment later we are at Paphos or Heliopolis or Baalbec, and see the women waiting at the temple of Mylitta or Ishtar or Astarte, to submit to the embraces of the stranger that they may dedicate to the goddess the wages of their sanctified harlotry. And then another ghastlier dedication: in the sanctuary of Cybele, to the sound of clashing cymbals, the priests gash their bodies and bespatter the altar with their blood. Presently we are in India and hear the hunters beg pardon of the elephant before they kill him; or in Madagascar and hear the propitiation of the whale; or somewhere in the heart of Africa and see a black man smearing himself with red paint so that the ghost of his victim will not recognise him. The picture changes; the Wotyaks are beating every corner of their houses that Satan may find no lurking place therein. And then we are afloat on the</page><page sequence="3">816 THE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW turquoise blue waters at the foot of Cape Leucadia, while from the Lover's Leap the scapegoat is hurled headlong with the cry " Be thou our offscouring !" And now we mingle with the crowds of the Roman Saturnalia, where drunken slaves rail at their masters who wait upon them at table. This picture melts into one of mediaeval ecclesiasticism, and the Abbot of Unreason censes the altar with burning shoe leather. Shrinking and horrified, we are next witnesses in Mexico of the festival called Toxcatl, and see the priest hold the heart, torn fresh from the breast of the victim, to the sun. And in the light of fire festivals the spectacle comes to an end. When in Flaubert's Tentation de Saint Antoine, the gods of Olympus, evoked by the power of Hilari?n, have passed before the saint and have disappeared into the abyss, the Etruscan divin ities follow after: Tages and Janus and Summanus and Bellona; and among them there appears a naked woman, four-footed as a beast, and served by a black man who holds in each hand a torch. Hilari?n whispers : C'est la d?esse d'?rida, avec le d?mon Virbius. Son sacerdoce, le roi du bois, devait ?tre un assassin;?et les esclaves en fuite, les d?pouilleurs de cadavres, les brigands de la voie Salaria, les ?clop?s du pont Sublicius, toute la vermine des galetas de Suburre n'avait pas de d?votion plus ch?re! A procession similar to that which troubled the bemused eyes of Saint Anthony streams past us as we read The Golden Bough, a huddled rout of figures quaint and curious, grotesque, terrible and pathetic by turns, nightmare phantasies as from the brain of some Brueghel or Jerome Bosch. The King of the Wood is the fugleman of this parade. Behind him a gibbering crone from the Scotch Highlands carries a knotted handkerchief that contains a favorable wind which she will sell to sailors. And behind her follows a stately figure, in satin and velvet and lace, with pointed beard and melancholy eyes; a crowd of evil-smelling scrofulous wretches jostle one another to get near him; he is Charles the First, touching for the King's Evil. The Bantu twins sing ribald songs and dance immodest dances to bring rain. Then come a lunatic crew who endeavor by obscene antics to further the ascent of the soul towards the Father; they are the Brethren of the Free Spirit. They pass ; and the perfume</page><page sequence="4">NEMI AND THE GOLDEN BOUGH 817 of the English spring steals over us, and the sound of maidens' laughter, as we see garlanded girls tripping out before the dawn to welcome the coming of the May. The centre of the proces sion is at hand. It is led by the Roman king, impersonating Jupiter, with eagle-topped sceptre and oaken crown. Beside him is the Mikado, burdened with his innumerable taboos. And then a long train of kings and kings' sons and mock kings, and slaves and criminals who carry the pretense of royalty. Carnivals ap pear bearing effigies of Shrove Tuesday and Ash Wednesday and Death and Summer and other oddities. And the mourners for Tammuz go wailing by, and the Egyptian rustics lamenting for Osiris. The maiden tribute to Minos passes; and the effeminate priests of Attis, with whitened faces, walk mincingly along. Mithra, a grand and solitary figure, vague and ill-defined but with something of divinity about him, next is seen; and Isis, suckling Horus, gracious and Madonna-like. Maenads and bassarids riot around Dionysos, the many-shaped. By torchlight a stately company moves as though through the rocky defile where the Via Sacra leads down to the Eleusinian plain. In grotesque con trast to this momentary vision of Hellas is a man of the Punjaub who hurries by crying "May every ill be far! Obey the serpent and you will thrive!" Base, foolish and degraded scapegoats come; he of Lhassa, shaking the yak's tail over the people that they may transfer their bad luck to him; he of Rome, Mamurius Veturius, beaten with rods. But what is this nauseating ap parition that succeeds him? A priest dressed in the bloody skin of the girl who has impersonated the great goddess Chicomecohuatl and who has been flayed alive. We turn away, our last glimpse being of witches speeding on their errands of mischief. The fairies, too, are loose; and a rabble of gnomes and trolls, elves and bogles, pixies, kobolds and jinns, lamise and succubse, vampires, ghouls and afreets, and all manner of wraiths and hobgoblins, brings up the rear. But amid this picturesque and multi-coloured evocation of the past, there runs a thread of serious and significant argument which can be followed only with some difficulty; for though the author at times arrests his progress to scrutinize the evidence collected and the results achieved, at no place does he offer a vol. ccxvm.?no. 817 52</page><page sequence="5">818 THE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW summary of his entire theme. Such an epitome I shall attempt here. The guardian of Diana's temple at Nemi was at once priest and king. The origin of kingship is discoverable in the principles of magic which are based upon two "laws" that are in reality but perversions of the phenomenon of the association of ideas. These laws are, first, that things which resemble one another are the same (the Law of Similarity) and, second, that things which have once been in contact with each other are always in contact (the Law of Contagion). From the former notion Imitative Magic (like the melting of the wax image of an enemy to destroy his life) is evolved; from the latter, Contagious Magic (like the beat ing of an enemy's coat to harm the distant enemy) comes. Some magicians sincerely believe in their preposterous claims, but the very nature of their calling offers a reward to the clever mounte bank; and the power wielded by the medicine man tends to fall into the hands of the person of keenest and most unscrupulous intelligence. With the emergence of the single resolute mind from the sluggish conservatism of primitive democracy, monarchy in its essentials has begun. The fallacy of magic was not so quickly detected as might be thought, for in most cases the rite performed was to bring about a result which, like rain or sunrise, was bound to happen sooner or later anyway. But in time the realization is borne in upon men that the proud art by which they claim to control nature is but a delusion. Now, the magician has this in common with the modern scientist, that he assumes a se quence of events determined by law. Only, he totally misunder stands the nature of the laws which govern that sequence. And the first step towards an understanding of his error leads him astray. If he cannot control nature, he thinks, it is because beings more powerful than himself control it. In this error lies one of the origins of religion. We have thenceforth the opposi tion of the two principles: Magic, which, operating by given laws, claims to produce desired effects; and Religion, which seeks to propitiate and conciliate higher powers who, it is believed, can produce those effects if they will. At times there is a confusion between the two, and even today the peasantry of Europe oc casionally resort to magical practices when the prayers of their</page><page sequence="6">NEMI AND THE GOLDEN BOUGH 819 priests have been unavailing. But fundamentally the two systems are opposed; the arrogance of the magician arouses the jealousy of the humble priest. The drift of Frazer's argument now sets in toward a more detailed inquiry into the origin of the kingship. The magician claimed to control the great forces of nature, and by virtue of his pretensions he often gained the highest position of authority over his credulous fellows. He became king. But he was punished if he failed in his duties; and with the waning of trust in magic he gradually tended to exchange its practice for the priestly functions of prayer and sacrifice. Not only did he become a priest; the imperfect distinction between the human and the divine combined with other causes to make men imagine that temporarily or per manently some men may be possessed by a powerful spirit and even attain to godhead in this life. The god-men descended from the old order of public magicians or medicine men do not always control all nature. Often they seem to have specialized, so to speak, in some particular side of nature; they are depart mental kings. Kings of Rain and Fire have been discovered in Africa; but to bring home the analogy to the priest of Aricia it is necessary to discover other Kings of the Wood. This need opens up the vast theme of the Worship of Trees. (Frazer expressly disclaims any belief in the supreme importance of such worship in the evolution of religion; he holds it altogether secondary to other factors, especially to fear and worship of the human dead.) Beliefs in tree spirits and their beneficent power, and the relics of tree worship in modern Europe, are passed under review. The purpose of the spring and summer festivals was to quicken magically the growth of trees and plants. The attendant license was not accidental excess but was originally an essential part of these rites; for the intercourse of the sexes promoted, it was thought, the fertility of the earth, though one finds the contrary practice of continence as a method of turning the vigour of human beings into a store of energy for the vegetable world. By a somewhat precarious analogy Frazer now draws together the Whitsuntide Bride and Bridegroom of modern Europe, and the priest of Diana who had, perhaps, the goddess herself for his mate. Diana's male partner Virbius was perhaps embodied in</page><page sequence="7">820 THE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW the King of the Wood. Annually their sacred nuptials were per formed at Nemi, or at least so the argument from analogy sug gests, for there is no ancient testimony to this portion of the Arician ritual. At this point we encounter one of the tenuous links in the chain that binds these theories and suggestions to gether. There is weakness as well as strength in the comparative method, and no one is better aware of its dangers, as of its allure ments, than is Frazer himself. Upon the priest-king and god-man depends the course of nature; any smallest act of his may overset the nice equipoise of the world. Care must be taken so to regulate his life that no act of his shall disturb this established order. He is bound around by prohibitions; the burden of royalty is great. The purpose of these restrictions or taboos is to preserve the divine man's life for the good of his people. But what dangers threaten the king??a question that provokes another: What does early man under stand by death? The soul is conceived as a frail and tiny replica of the human body, a facsimile much reduced but complete at all points.1 Many people believe that the soul may be absent temporarily from the body, in sleep or at other times. The departure is not always voluntary, and the soul may become lost or its return to the body prevented. In the Malay Peninsula the art of abducting souls is carried to a high pitch of perfection. The shadow of a man or his reflection in a mirror or in water is sometimes regarded as his soul, and harm may be done him by trampling on his shadow or by striking his reflection. To such dangers the wandering spirit is exposed. Each individual is concerned to protect his own soul; but the welfare of the whole tribe is bound up with the soul of the king. The anthropomorphic conception of a divine being implied in its first stages the supposition that gods, like men, must die. Tombs of the gods were shown at various places: Dionysos was 11 leave Frazer's argument for a moment to note that on the wall of the smaller cloister of the Certosa di Pa via there is a terra-cotta Annunciation: the Virgin kneels meekly in the right-hand corner; at the upper left the Father is seen blessing her; and from him, on a stream of light, the Holy Spirit, in likeness of a dove, glides down towards Mary. So much of the bas-relief follows the tradition of Christian iconography. But on the tail of the dove rides a tiny baby, the image in little of the Christ-child. He is about to enter his mother. It is a quaintly ingenuous conception.</page><page sequence="8">NEMI AND THE GOLDEN BOUGH 821 buried at Delphi; Zeus in Crete; the mummy of Osiris was to be seen at Mendes. If even the high remote gods die at last, so, surely, must a god who abides within the frail shelter of a man's body. Yet the prosperity of a community depends upon its man-god. How avert the calamity of his death? This question opens up the central theme of The Golden Bough: the Dying God. The instances are multitudinous of the killing of kings either when their strength begins to fail or at the end of a fixed term of office. In this way the king's soul can be transferred to a vigorous suc cessor before it is impaired by decay. The old custom of regicide is gradually softened down; the king abdicates annually and a temporary king assumes the office. Often he is a criminal al ready under sentence of death; but always he is treated with reverence and is granted regal privileges. His subsequent death, since he is to die in any case, is less shocking to feelings that have acquired some degree of humaneness. Relics of this periodic regicide still exist in the mummings and carnivals of Europe. Frazer now applies the evidence as to the natural or accelerated death of various gods of nature to a study of the ancient myths of Adonis, Attis, and Osiris, and abandons the main line of his argu ment to investigate many interesting but only faintly related problems. And then the ceremonies of the annual renewal of the life of vegetation are studied; the idea common to all such rites is that the life of the god-man passes into his successor in full strength. But another and originally unrelated idea is inter twined with that of this transference of vitality. This is the grandiose idea of the Scapegoat, which the progress of time has, as Frazer says, refined from a foolish notion "into the sublime conception of a God Who dies to take away the sins of the world." At the base of this notion is a confusion between the real possibility of transferring a physical load and the supposed possi bility of shifting mental and moral ailments to another person. A finely characteristic passage opens Frazer's discussion of the Scapegoat: For ages the army of spirits, once so near, has been receding farther and farther from us, banished by the magic wand of science from hearth and home, from ruined cell and ivied tower, from haunted glade and lonely mere, from the riven murky cloud that belches forth the lightning, and from those fairer clouds</page><page sequence="9">822 THE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW that pillow the silvery moon or fret with flakes of burning red the golden eve. The spirits are gone from their last stronghold in the sky, whose blue arch no longer passes, except with children, for the screen that hides from mortal eyes the glory of the celestial world. Only in poets' dreams or impassioned flights of oratory is it given to catch a glimpse of the last flutter of the standards of the retreating host, to hear the beat of their invisible wings, the sound of their mocking laughter, or the swell of angel music dying away in the distance. Far otherwise is it with the savage. To his imagination the world still teems with those motley beings whom a more sober philosophy has discarded. . . . Their constant presence wearies him, their sleepless malignity exasperates him; he longs with an unspeakable longing to be rid of them altogether, and from time to time, driven to bay, his patience utterly exhausted, he turns fiercely on his persecutors, and makes a desperate effort to chase the whole pack of them from the land, to clear the air of their swarming multitudes. All over the world there have been occasional or periodic expul sions of intangible, inaudible and invisible evils, often driven out with sticks and stones and shouts, or bundled off in some sort of vehicle, as when certain savages launch a demon-laden ship with the cry, "Fly away, devil; never come again!" Or the evil may be embodied in a material form which is sometimes an animal; in Assam a monkey was formerly crucified annually as a public scapegoat. Or the scapegoat may be a human being; and that human being may be a god. The expulsion of evils usually marks the beginning of a new year, and the periodic riddance is often followed or preceded by a period of general license. Thus far the long inquiry has been directed towards the solu tion of the question: Why had the priest of Aricia to slay his predecessor? In the final part of Frazer's work the problem of the golden bough is approached through the story of Balder. This in turn leads to an account of the fire-festivals of Europe, which is one of the most beautiful and romantic portions of the book. A parallel between Balder and the priest of Nemi is drawn. The conclusion of the whole matter is that the Arician priest was a departmental king of nature, the representative of the oak-god Virbius, wedded annually to Diana, and put to death when his strength began to fail, that his life might go into his successor. Upon his existence, that of the grove and the sur rounding vegetation was believed to depend; and upon the mistletoe his own life depended.</page><page sequence="10">NEMI AND THE GOLDEN BOUGH 823 Thus in the end Frazer returns to Nemi, a tentative solution in hand, having sometimes solved and more often indicated many other problems by the way, and having gathered a mass of evi dence of the slow, discouraging progress of the human mind and of the ignorance and credulity and cruelty and superstition of which our poor race has been guilty in its long history. Beside the lake he bids it and us farewell; these are his majestic words of parting: Our long voyage of discovery is over and our bark has dropped her weary sails in port at last. Once more we take the road to Nemi. It is evening, and as we climb the long slope of the Appian Way up to the Alban Hills, we look back and see the sky aflame with sunset, and touching with a crest of fire the dome of St. Peter's. The sight once seen can never be forgotten, but we turn from it and pursue our way darkling along the mountain side, till we come to Nemi and look down on the lake in its deep hollow, now fast disappearing in the evening shadows. The place has changed but little since Diana received the homage of her worshippers in the sacred grove. The temple of the sylvan goddess, indeed, has vanished and the King of the Wood no longer stands sentinel over the Golden Bough. But Nemi's woods are still green, and as the sunset fades above them in the west, there comes to us, borne on the swell of the wind, the sound of the church bells of Aricia ringing the ?ngelus. Ave Maria! Sweet and solemn they chime out from the distant town and die lingeringly away across the wide Campagnan marshes. Le roi est mort, vive le roi! Ave Maria! As one reads these words one hears Hilari?n?himself the personi fication of Science?whispering in the ear of Saint Anthony: Ils vivent toujours! L'empereur Constantine adore Afollan. Tu retrouveras la Trinit? dans les myst?res de Samothrace, le bapt?me chez Isis, la r?demption chez Mithra, le martyre d'un Dieu aux f?tes de Bacchus. Proserpine est la Vierge! Frazer's wide range of evidence embraces matter of very vary ing degrees of reliability; some of his theories and conjectures are untenable; some of his conclusions are uncertain or even fantastic. His initial "laws" of magic tend to exaggerate the intellectual element in the savage's life and to obscure the emotional. Some links in his argument are weak. He pushes the comparative method to an extreme. Upon the agricultural aspects of primi tive religion he lays an emphasis which his own later writings are serving to modify. Anthropologists of the future must re-sift and rearrange his vast stores of material. The science of anthro</page><page sequence="11">824 THE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW pology, despite the labours of Mannhardt and Tylor and Robert son Smith, was in its infancy when he began his work; even now a proper methodology is not completely formulated. All this may be granted. But the author of The Golden Bough has often emphasized the fact that his conclusions are but tentative and that he has ever been ready to revise or discard them when better explanations present themselves. Meanwhile he has used his theories as "pegs" on which to hang the collections of data that he has brought together from the reports and recollections of the army of explorers who for the sake of religion or conquest or com merce or science have penetrated into the wild places of the earth, or of that other army which in the cause of scholarship has groped inquiringly into the dark background of human history. Even if every one of his theories is at length swept away by the rising tide of knowledge, I find it impossible to believe that in any future state of literary culture thoughtful people will allow this great achievement of learning and imagination and literary art to accumulate dust upon high, unsought shelves. But we, too, were forced to bid farewell to Nemi. The walk around the lake was quickly over, notwithstanding our delays to pluck the first flowers of the spring. For the flowers return, though the magician who once brought them year by year and who died that they might live again has long since vanished. Fitful showers and more fitful sunshine fell upon us while we pursued our way around the shore; and the long shadows were reaching across the water as we climbed the heights of Genzano and turned away from Nemi's immemorial woods.
