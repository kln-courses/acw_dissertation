<plain_text><page sequence="1">DER URSPRUNG DER RELIGION UND KUNST. Von K. TH. PREUSS. Globus, LXXXVI, LXXXVII. Sonderabdruck, PP. 54. DR. PREUSS' "provisional communication" to Globus is, in my opinion at least, of the highest interest and importance. It embodies an almost wholly novel view of cultural, and in particular of religious, origins. A fuller treatment, however, would be welcome. As at present sketched out the theory is somewhat hard to grasp in its completeness, and it may well be that in what follows I have hardly done it justice. To put it shortly, Dr. Preuss holds magic to lie at the root of all our culture-of religion, of art, of games, of speech itself, not to mention clothing, agriculture, marriage, and a miscellaneous host of other institutions hardly less fundamental. How this and that particular development took place is dealt with mostly by the way. The chief concern throughout is with magic itself as parent source. Now Dr. Preuss, like the sound anthropologist that he is, pursues a concrete method, and is as lavish of illustrations as he is sparing of universal definitions. Two essential characters, however, he seems ready to predicate of magic in general. In the first place, magic is the exertion of a kind of power-orenda,</page><page sequence="2">Reviews. I 27 mana. In the second place, such power manifests itself pre- eminently in a Verwandlungsfihigkei/, a capacity for metamorphosis -for 'multipresence,' to coin a word-which maintains the self- identity of the magical agency though it be there but in the shape of a nail-paring, an image, or a mere name. Mark the corollary. Animism, the theory that the essence of divinity consists in soul, must forego a large portion of its empire. What has been hitherto invariably taken for indwelling incorporeal soul is in many, nay most, cases naught else but indwelling mana, virtually incorporeal since indifferent as to the form in which it clothes itself. Thus the Mexican maize-goddess Chicome coatl is a young maiden, an old woman, the actual maize growing in the field, the life-giving food, and so on; but, whether person or thing, is in all appear- ances a power. Asks Dr. Preuss: "Ist zu all dem ein Geist notig?" Now I am at any rate at one with Dr. Preuss in believing (a) that a "pre-animistic" religion is to be found in active existence amongst savages, the objects of which are "powers," liable, indeed, to be more or less personified, but lacking the distinctive attribute of soul; (b) that magic may directly generate religion. Indeed, I have already expressed in Folk-Lore similar views, to which Dr. Preuss is kind enough to refer. But can one go further, and, with Dr. Preuss, regard magic as the generating cause of all religion? I am inclined, provisionally, to follow him, revising, that is, enlarging, my conception of magic accordingly. My previous notion of magic was that it was primarily the mysterious activity exerted by the man who casts a spell on his neighbour; whereas anything mysterious might, in my view, be an object of pre-animistic religion. Dr. Preuss, however, would apparently identify magic with any kind of mysterious activity. Now, if we may legitimately do this, magic would, I allow, become virtually coextensive with the most primitive kind of religion; for there is good psychological ground for thinking that, in order to objectify the mysterious at all, the savage must endow it with some sort of activity, some power of holding its own, so to speak, against him. It remains to show that we may legitimately widen our idea of magic so as to embrace all kinds of mysterious activity, and still preserve some definite meaning for the word, and one allied to, and continuous with, the sense or senses it ordinarily bears.</page><page sequence="3">1 2 8 Reviews. Now man, it may be assumed, is bound to wear anthropomorphic spectacles, and to project into his surroundings the likeness of himself. Given, then, a stimulus, say, the sight of blood, that excites curiosity and fear together, that is, awe, how will he tend to interpret its effect on his nerves ? According to our assumption, it will be interpreted on the analogy of the mysterious activity he feels and knows in himself. Casting a spell is one form of such activity, which he may have become aware of pretty early in his career. But there are others, and it is the great merit of Dr. Preuss' work that he points them out. The power of procreation is a wonder-working which must in very early days have been perceived to be such. Then there is the experience of exaltation as produced by dancing or what not, such excitement directly causing the subject to feel wonderfully active, and in many cases to be so in the sight of all men. Once more, life as such is a wonderful thing, if only because death-the not being alive and active-is so awful. Hence breath and vital warmth, as signs and supposed vehicles of the mysterious life-force, will soon come to furnish typical modes of representing the idea of indwelling orenda. And so on. Dr. Preuss has, I think, made out at least a prima facie case for holding that magic is the wonder-working mood and experience in all those forms in which early man perceives it in himself; which mood and experience he then projects into all objects that cause him awe, so that their inwardness becomes for him just the echo of his own. Why the mysteriously-active object should display a capacity for "multi- presence" Dr. Preuss does not explain. Probably he would account for it in the usual way, namely, as the effect of association of ideas called into play by the strong interest which the object of awe awakens. The applications of Dr. Preuss' general theory are on their own account of great value. Perhaps the two most novel of the detailed explanations are the account of the part played by the idea of vital warmth in various scatological rites, and the theory of the life-giving procreative breath as the reason for the custom of knocking out a tooth at puberty.
