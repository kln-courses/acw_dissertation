<plain_text><page sequence="1">Artistic Creativity in Benin Kingdom PAULA BEN-AMOS In many African cultures artistic crea- tivity is ultimately linked to divine cre- ation. This association can be expressed in language by the utilization of the same verb for both phenomena. Thus, in his discussion of carving, Bohannon (1961:87) points out that the Tiv "use the word 'create' (gba) for working wood- its only other use is for God's creation of the World." In mythology, primordial creation is frequently presented as an essentially artistic act: the Creator God of the Fon (Herskovits 1967, vol. 2:232) and the Lodagaa (Goody 1962:209), for example, modeled the first human beings from clay and water, like a builder or potter. Indeed, the image of God as artist ap- pears to be widespread in Africa. In his compilation African Concepts of God, Mbiti (1970:45-46) cites numerous examples of this image, among them the Akan, who 1. OLOKUN CHALK DESIGN OF EGHUGHU, THE SNUB-NOSED CROCODILE. refer to God as the "Excavator, Hewer, Carver, Creator, Originator, Inventor, Architect," the Ila, who call God "the Creator, Moulder, and Constructor," and the Kiga, who refer to God as the "Fashioner," the one who gives shape to things. In some African cultures the analogy goes even farther: the artist at work is viewed as enacting or recreating the ori- gin myth. The Dogon weaver, according to Griaule and Dieterlen, "imitates the Nommo [a primordial being] who, springing from the clavicles of God, forthwith wove together the four ele- ments contained therein and made from them the whole universe. Just as he drew the four elements from the clavicles of God, so the weaver draws his threads- that is, the four elements-from the spindles, the clavicles of the loom" (1954:107). This paradigmatic linkage of cosmic creation with artistic creation is found in the Edo Kingdom of Benin as well.1 In the Edo language, the verb yi, "to create," is combined with the object ag- bon, "world," to express cosmological creation, and with the object ama, "mark" or "design," for artistic crea- tion.2 In Benin mythology, Osanobua, the Supreme Deity, formed the human body from clay, the same material that artists use to mold pots and elaborate shrine tableaux. Other artists as well work with the mythic paradigm, but adapt it to their own particular media. Thus, Omoruyi Obasoyen of the carvers' guild told me: "The members of Ig- besanmwan were formerly in the spirit world and were considered very intelli- gent. They were the only people work- ing with Osanobua, the Creator God. As soon as they carved a figure it was so beautiful that Osanobua would give it life and send it to earth." The phrase yi ama, "to create a mark or design," is a clue to the broader concept of artistic creativity in Benin. In whatever media they work, artists see themselves as possessing a body of forms and pat- terns that belong to them and define them as a group. The importance of these designs for artistic self-identity can be seen in the invocation that members of the carvers' guild make to their patron deity, Ugbe n'Owewe, upon commenc- ing a carving: "Ugbe n'Owewe, ances- tors, let us prosper./Don't let us forget the patterns that we make./Don't let our children forget them." These patterns are seen as part of the guild heritage, handed down from generation to gener- ation through the inspiration of Ugbe n'Owewe. The basic aesthetic principle behind the work done by the guild is strict adherence to these designs, as can be seen in this comment by Samson Okungbowa: "To make a proper com- memorative head it is necessary to get all the patterns right. Someone who does not know how to make it will lose parts of the pattern." While it is expected as a matter of course that carvers and casters will ex- hibit "an aptitude for design and techni- cal ability" (Cordwell 1952:212), indi- vidual differences in talent are recog- nized, as Ugbo Ineh explains: "When someone learns [to carve], there is al- ways something he likes better and has beautiful ideas about and so he becomes an expert at making it." Outside the structure of guilds, mem- bership in an age grade, residence in a craft village, or divine selection are the primary means of recruitment to artistic activity. Among these artists there is a similar sense of ownership of designs, al- though it is much less formalized than in the guilds. The owuorhue of Olokun (chalk markers for the god of the waters), for example, decorate the shrines of that deity with elaborate abstract designs, "Olokun designs," representing beings and objects in his undersea world. These include the snub-nosed crocodile (eghughu, Fig. 1), river leaves (ebe amen), ceremonial swords (ada and eben), and the ladder to Olokun's storehouse of wealth (egbelaka Olokun). The owuorhue, as well as the artists who create ritual pots (the omakhe) or mold life-sized mud figures (the omebo) for Olokun and other deities, are chosen by the particular deity and receive their training from that god in the form of dream instruction. For example, Priestess lyahen Olaye (Fig. 3), anomebo ("molder of the gods"), told me that she had suffered greatly in her life 60</page><page sequence="2">and out share a belief that the deities or ancestors are the ultimate source of their designs. In the very process of creation, artists work in close contact with these divine beings, asking for their favor, de- pending on their guidance, seeking their protection against accidents and witch- craft. It is necessary, therefore, for artists to be in a state of ritual purity: for some this involves sexual abstinence, for others a bath and the donning of "clean" cloth if sexual relations have taken place during the previous night. Traditional artists work in a secluded spot-a shrine house, a lean-to in the bush, a special room in the palace-but those who produce for external con- sumption (for expatriates, tourists, or Nigerian civil servants) usually can be found in open workshops. Even in these situations, they insist on freedom from interruption when thinking or working out a design (Dark 1973:42). In their important discussion of Tiwi (Australia) creativity, Goodale and Koss (1967) attempt to set up a model of the creative process that may be applicable cross-culturally. Their description of a preliminary stage of contemplation and inspiration followed by alternations of periods of activity and "incubation" seem to fit well what we know about Benin artistic work. Both Cordwell (1952:180) and Dark (1973:42) point out that Edo craftsmen generally conceive the finished form in their minds before commencing work. In doing this, they _ _A.P~~~~~~ a 1utilize "a reservoir of set forms, of stereotypes, which [they draw] upon to express a theme" (Dark 1973:42). As Co rdwell explains: "The manipulation of prescribed symbols... takes place in the preliminary stage of composition and appears to involve a mental re- examination of known artistic forms made not only by the carver himself but 2. THE PRIESTESS AND MOLDER AGHAYERE EV- BOKHUAIYERU'S PERSONAL OLOKUN SHRINE. RIGHT: 3. PRIESTESS IYAHEN OLAYE SITTING IN FRONT OF HER PERSONAL SHRINE. until one night she had a dream in which Olokun came to her and told her that she could end her sufferings by becoming his devotee and creating decorative pots and molded shrines for him. In the dream he gave her the authority (ase, "effective power") to mold without being harmed. Iyahen Olaye had made domestic pot- tery before this, but did not know how to make images. But, as she explains, "as soon as the authority was given to me in the dream, someone was molding over there [in Olokun's kingdom], showing me how to do it. I learned by watching him." Thus, although they differ in the ac- _ I quisition of skills, artists inside the guild _ I</page><page sequence="3">by his father and the father of his father and so back to unknown specialists cen- turies before him. Creation of a given form seems to involve the memory of known designs, the successful arrange- ment of these in appropriate forms and surfaces, and over all a perfection of technical skill by which designs are given as perfect form as possible" (Cordwell 1952:180). Once the design is formulated, artists set to work with speed and deep concen- tration. Cordwell describes an interview with an elderly member of the carvers' guild who "claimed that the criteria for a fine carver is the ability to design a com- plete composition in the imagination and render it swiftly, without hesitation in secondary decisions, into its final form in wood. It is for this reason that he and the other traditional carvers scoff at the work of the palace carvers [former pages at work in the king's Arts and Crafts School], saying: 'They have to see a drawing before they can carve, while we design in our heads' " (Cordwell 1952:180). This period of intense activity is absorbing and exhilarating, a time when, as the carver Ovia Idah told Dark (1973:42), the world outside becomes excluded. Priestess Aghayere Ev- bokhuaiyeru, a molder of Olokun shrines, describes how she feels when she is at work: "I find great joy in mold- ing. I love doing it. The ideas will be pouring out of me. Molding is very, very sweet." Intense activity alternates with quietude or incubation, in Goodale and Koss's words, "a period of selective cor- rection leading to the accentuation of new and surprisingly pleasant effects" (1967:177). In Benin this often takes place during dreams, which are a major source of innovations. As David Omergie of the carvers' guild explains: "The spirit of the ancestors works in me, directing me. When I sleep I see things I have never carved before. If I have a big order I will do it step by step, and every night the ancestors will teach me step by step. I have faith in the ancestors because I have learned more from dreams than from ac- tual studying." The issue of gender differentiation in artistic production has been discussed by Adams (1980) and Teilhet (1978). Adams argues that male artistic activity (in her example, carving in Africa) parallels in a deep symbolic way women's reproduct- ive capacities. That is, when men pro- duce small human figures in wood, they are conceptually replicating women's giving birth to small human creatures. The parallel exists in processes of creation-in both carving and childbirth the creator is isolated and ringed by taboos-and in the behavior surround- ing that which is ultimately produced- both carvers and mothers are shaping creations to suit their culture's needs. Looking cross-culturally, Teilhet sees differences rather than similarities. She claims that "the disparities of style, technique and media between men and women artists appear to be universal. In most cultures women are rarely allowed to make anthropomorphic or zoomor- phic forms; these are the prerogative of men. In most cultures women are rarely permitted to make objects requiring the knowledge of ritual process or the skill and knowledge of manipulating certain specialized tools. And there seems to be a universal taboo against women's sculpting in hard materials such as wood, bone, ivory, stone, gold and metal compounds; these materials are used exclusively by men. Women can work only with soft, malleable materials: clay, gourds, basketry, leather or weav- ing. We can therefore say that a distinc- tion exists in traditional nonliterate societies between the arts made by men and women" (1978:97). Teilhet relates this distinction to questions of power and dominance. She argues that an- thropomorphic and zoomorphic forms are usually reserved for the most cultur- ally important sacred religious and polit- ical representations of deities or ances- tors, and therefore their production is a privilege given almost exclusively to men. In a few exceptional cases, the women who are able to create an- thropomorphic sculpture are clearly de- marcated from others of their sex by vir- tue of being chosen by a deity or by hav- ing reached menopause. The allocation of artistic materials is a further expres- sion of gender ideology in Teilhet's view. The soft materials generally used by women reflect their femininity and are "common and secularly oriented to women's work, i.e. the home, garden, cooking and childraising' (1978:99). In contrast, the hard materials used by men are identified with their maleness and are "more highly rated within their cul- ture for their durability, scarcity and the skill and/or technology necessary to work it and the medium's innate magico-religious properties" (Teilhet 1978:99). This pattern of artistic differentiation holds true in Benin in the sense that women have access to a narrower range of materials than men. Much of men's creative activity takes place within the guilds, where they cast, carve, forge, and weave prestigious regalia and sculp- ture for the king and court (Fig. 5). Out- side the guilds, men work iron, sculpt in wood and mud, create elaborate mas- querade costumes, and construct and decorate shrines for a variety of village cults. Because of religious strictures pre- venting their handling metal or metal tools, women's participation is limited to all but the weaver's guild, where they create woven hip pennants and elabo- rate rams'-hair wigs (Ben-Amos 1978), and the brass-casters' guild, in which in recent times female members have begun making highly decorated Olokun pots (Ben-Amos 1973: figs. 1-4). Domes- tic weaving used to be an important women's craft until the early part of this century, and pottery-making is still a female specialization in a number of vil- lages (Willett &amp; Connah 1969). Gender differentiation breaks down, however, in one significant area: the cre- ation of art forms for Olokun and for his pantheon of river deities. Both men and women participate in the numerous ac- tivities involved in the decoration of shrines, including the creation of large- scale anthropomorphic figures. The god is envisioned as a king living in an un- derwater palace that is the source of all worldly wealth and beauty (Ben-Amos 1973). These shrines evoke his underwa- ter paradise and thus contain some of the most powerful and sacred imagery in Benin. As a deity, Olokun is especially as- sociated with creativity. Egharevba ex- plains: "Olokun is.. .the god of inspira- tion and idealism, and works upon the hidden spirit of man. Those who come under his influence are original, often eccentric, usually of highly sensitive na- tures and may be geniuses in one line or another" (1949:84). Men and women who become devotees of Olokun are re- cruited through divine inspiration ex- pressed in dreams and states of trance. Since Olokun is a god who demands beauty, many of these devotees are channeled into artistic activities as- sociated with the decoration of his shrines, which are found both in villages and in the urban homes of chiefs and cult leaders. In both village and private shrines, people are chosen by divination or pos- session to be decorators (imona), whose task is to beautify the shrine by hanging large pieces of cloth behind the altar. This cloth is either white, symbolizing the absolute ritual purity of Olokun's kingdom, or red, embodying the power to drive away evil forces. Others (primar- ily but not necessarily women) are ap- pointed as owuorhue, who use ground kaolin to create the most ephemeral of art forms: elaborate abstract designs sur- rounding Olokun altars (Fig. 4). The making of these designs is a crucial tem- poral marking that is said to "open the day for Olokun in the water," a ritual that must be performed on a regular basis, otherwise no other activity can be undertaken. The artist assigned as de- signer is "directed by Olokun" in choos- ing the patterns, which are all emblema- 62</page><page sequence="4">tic of Olokun's undersea world. Kaolin chalk is considered the essence of white- ness and is the symbol of ritual purity, so important to Olokun worship. In some cult groups, women are selected to create decorated ritual pots, which are the central object on an Olo- kun shrine. The omakhe make them of river clay, a sacred substance represent- ing the cycle of life and death. Depicted on the pots are the participants in Olo- kun ceremonies: drummers, dancing priestesses, women holding children, who are the main hoped-for benefit of cult membership. The water in the pot is kept fresh to represent the river as con- tact point and source of all the devotees desire. River clay is used as well in the con- struction of elaborate, often life-sized ta- bleaux representing the undersea palace of Olokun and his wives and chiefs. The artists (omebo), both men and women, who make these shrine figures are com- missioned by a priest or priestess who has had a dream or vision in which Olo- kun demands a molded shrine to honor him. The imagery of these shrines is con- sidered to be an accurate portrayal of Olokun's kingdom under the waters. Most devotees, whether artists or not, have seen Olokun's palace in visions, dreams, or (in a few rare cases) in actual voyages under the river, and thus have a clear idea of the artistic forms required. The central figure is Olokun dressed in the finest royal regalia (in shrines dedi- cated to his subordinate deities the cen- tral figure might be one of his queens or high-ranking chiefs), surrounded by his wives, all beautiful and fruitful, his im- portant chiefs, and a wide variety of at- tendants, including sword bearers, "policemen," herbalists, and gate keep- ers (Fig. 2). The molding of such an Olokun shrine is a special kind of creativity. While car- vers, casters, and weavers make images that control or reflect social, political, and magical power, the molder of an Olokun shrine is in effect recreating or replicating on earth an ontological real- ity. While it is true that the material omebo use to mold these shrines-clay from the riverbank-is soft, pliable and com- mon, it is not associated with "home, garden, cooking, and childraising" in the Benin view, but with the moment of creation, for it is the very material that Osanobua, the father of Olokun, used to form the first human beings. Thus, the creativity of these omebo-women and men-refers not only to a parallel reality but to a primordial time, and the artist becomes not only a molder of the gods but a molder like the gods.

Discussing Hausa calabashes, Berns states that "a concen- tration on the recognizable, representational imagery shows the artists' sensitivity to the aesthetic preferences of their Western customer" (1985:45). 6. Chappel found that in northeastern Nigeria the Fulani were more concerned with the overall design structure of the gourd than the meaning of individual motifs (1977:56). His observation among the Fulani is similar to what Norma Wolff and I observed among the Hausa. 7. The incidence of Kode calabash decorators inscribing their names into the design scheme was fairly common. This prac- tice seems to be associated with calabashes destined for the outgroup tourist market, as those decorated for traditional use are not "signed." 8. With the exception of certain types of musical instru- ments, containers for henna dye, and calabashes decorated for the Fulani people, imported enameled metal vessels have largely superseded decorated calabash containers among both the urban and rural Hausa during this century. If it were not for the demand and market created by European and other Nigerian patrons, the craft would seriously decline. Compared to the northeastern Nigerian Fulani tradition of calabash decoration, documented by Chappel (1977), the Hausa generally do not have a tradition of ceremonial use for decorated calabashes, the single exception being their inclu- sion, in the past, in bride-price exchanges. Because their use of decorated calabashes was mostly utilitarian, the tradition was probably more susceptible to replacement by imported vessels. Bibliography Bascom, William. 1969.

This combination of local and imported elements pro- duces a culturally authenticated appearance (Daly, Eicher, &amp; Erekosima 1984).

According to Jones (1963), "The war-canoe house was a compact and well-organized trading and fighting corpora- tion, capable of manning and maintaining a war canoe." He suggests that it replaced the earlier Kalabari term polo, which designated each major lineage. Prior to the rule of King Amakiri, the term for ward or lineage was ivari. Today these terms are often interchangeable. 6. Names of the various stages of iria indicate the materials and techniques emphasized: for example bite pakiri iwain, when a girl wears a "half length of a piece of cloth"; ikuta de, "bead display"; konu fina, "to put something on the waist." 7.

My fieldwork was supported by a Fulbright-Hays Doctoral Dissertation Grant and done with the cooperation of the University of Zimbabwe and the National Museums of Zimbabwe. I wish to thank the many museums and scholars all over the world who generously helped in my research. Special thanks to George Mvenge and Godfrey Kativhu of the Queen Victoria Museum and my field assistant, Noel Mtetwa, who accompanied me on field trips. Finally I wish to thank the many people in Zimbabwe who aided me. An ear- lier version of this paper was delivered on April 26,1985, for the panel "Concepts of Creativity" at the University of Min- nesota's African Studies Council Symposium, "Male and Female Artistry in Africa." 1. Zimbabwe, the newest nation in Africa, achieved inde- pendence in 1980. The Shona are a patrilineal people of the Bantu language group who have customarily engaged in cat- tle raising and mixed farming. Traditionally they have or- ganized into numerous independentchiefdoms, though over the last thousand years powerful states such as Great Zim- babwe and Mutapa have arisen in this area (Beach 1980). 2. According to Tlit A;merican Heritage Dictionary of the Einglish Language (New York, 1975:311) "creative" can mean, "charac- terized by originality and expressiveness" or "having the ability or power to create things." 3. When people become possessed during religious cere- monies, they act in a manner characteristic of the particular spirit. Those possessed by European shaves, for instance, pick up knives and forks (whereas they would normally eat with their fingers), and speak English words. For photographs of peoples possessed by baboon spirits, see Gelfand 1962, plates 86-87 and 102-03. 4. Vatete is the name for family spirit mediums among the Karanga and Manvika Shona. The higher-ranking spirit mediums are known assvikiro among the Karanga, Manyika, and Zezuru; and mnamnvura among the Korekore. 5. Peter Frv documented this in Slpirits of Protest (1976). 6. She even went with them into their staging areas in Mozambique (see Frederikse 1982: 42; Martin &amp; Johnson 1981: 75-78). The original Nehanda and Kaguvi are now considered national heroes, and a sculpture of them has recently been erected in the Parliament buildings in the capital city of Ha- rare (Tthe Herai , June 26,1984). 7. To mv knowledge the only photographs of this are the ones taken on Frobenius's expedition to Southern Africa in 1928. (Frobenius Institute, Frankfurt, Expedition IX, Sud- Afrika Band 3, #10642,3). They show what Frobenius called a "rain priest" wearing a fringed hat of barkcloth. The man was, in fact, a regional spirit medium. 8. Interview with J. Madzivire, acting chief Musarurwa, Nharira, Charter District, May 31 and September 2,1984. 9. Interview with Chief Nvoka, Manyene, Charter District, June 2,1984. Several artists I interviewed said they had been commissioned to make headrests forspirit mediums. Though thev were not always sure of the intended purpose, they surmised that the headrests were meant to facilitate dream- ing of the ancestors. 10. Intervies with Sekuru Bwanva, Shamva, June 30,1984. 11. The exact nature of these ceremonies is not clear to me, and the artists were hesitant to explain the circumstances in depth. Brewing beer is a precursor for possession ceremonies of vatdimni and shave. Beer is also brewed at regular intervals to; honor the ancestors more generally. During these cere- monies the ancestors are addressed or beseeched, and offer- ings of beer are made. Whether or not possession occurs, the ceremonies mentioned bv the artists constitute a formal ac- knowledgement of the role of the spirits in their inspiration. 12. Interview with MunvikwaTitiya, Makoni District, July 11, 1984. 13. Interview with Mrs. Movosvi, Nvamazuwe, Mutoko Dis- trict, June 20,1984, The ritual pottery that she said she made, which is typical of the area, is placed either in or on graves. 14. Paul Berliner (1978) has documented that Shona musi- cians, particularly the tibira (thumb piano) players, also claim to receive inspiration from the ancestors through dreams. 15. Interview with Johwani Nvamukapa, Mutoko, June 20, 1984. 16. Interview with Mrs. Kwari from Chimanimani, July 8, 1984. 17. Interviews with Peter Gamanva, Chikwaka, Mav 1 and June 2, 1984. 18. Interview with Taundi Kahuni, Bwanva, Mutoko Dis- trict, June 19,1984. 19. Kaemmer (1975: 144) mentions that in the Madziwa area of Mt. Darwin, inadainba -shave spirits are associated with pot- terv making. BOOKS Rare, important and out-of-print books on Afri- can, Primitive and Ancient art purchased and sold.
