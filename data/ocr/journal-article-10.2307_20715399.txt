<plain_text><page sequence="1">Holistic Art Instruction and Narrative Thinking Sharon Johnson Maryland Institute College of Art Abstract This paper investigates how recent research on narrative thinking and the construction of nar rative meaning by cognitive psychologists, edu cators, and art educators (Bruner 1986, 1990, 1997; Egan, 1991; Johnson, 2001; Lyle, 2000; Polkinghorne, 1988; Rosen, 1985; Siegal, 1999) aligns with the goals of holistic art instruction as described by London et al. (2004). Particular at tention is given to Bruner's theory of narrative cognition as well as Bruner's definitions of the grammatical and aesthetic elements of narrative form. Three examples of art problems grounding holistic art instruction in K-12 classrooms are an alyzed to demonstrate how the elements of nar rative thinking operate when students engage in the process of solving holistic art problems. The paper argues that the synergistic relation ship between narrative thinking and holistic art instruction provides a rationale for establishing narrative learning theory as an appropriate cog nitive framework for the development of holistic approaches to teaching and learning in art. Holistic Art Instruction and Narrative Thinking Recent scholarship on narrative thinking that addresses the ways humans construct meaning offers a cognitive framework that appears well aligned with the goals of ho listic art instruction as defined by London et al. (2004). To examine the relationship between narrative thinking and holistic art instruction, this paper will focus on how the structure of art problems used to ground holistic art instruction relates to Bruner's (1986; 1990; 1997) and other scholars' re search on narrative thinking. Holistic Art Instruction In a recent monograph on holistic art edu cation practice, London (2004) describes some of the grounding principles of holistic art instruction. These include: (a) the in tegration of body, mind, and spirit; (b) the creation of safe and nurturing learning en vironments; and (c) the use of holistic art problems that invite the student to connect their individual life experience to univer sal, existential themes of human experi ence. This paper will focus on one of these grounding principles: the holistic art prob lem. Three holistic art problems designed by K-12 art teachers are used to frame the inquiry presented in this paper. The Holistic Art Problem The three art problems listed below appear in London et al.'s (2004) monograph on ho listic art education. They demonstrate how a universal or existential human theme is used to relate to the lived experience of the student. As an example, in the first art prob lem designed by Carroll (2004), the univer sal human struggle for personal growth and self-realization frames the problem. The student is invited to represent his or her own struggle for self actualization as experienced in his or her own life. In a simi lar manner, the second and third art prob lem below also present a universal theme to which the student can respond from his or her own life experience. 1. Carroll (2004) invited college age students to consider journey as a metaphor for separating, getting lost, finding oneself, conquering a chal lenge, and returning home renewed. 2. Wittner (2004) asked 5th grade stu dents to turn their attention to them selves, and think about what truly bothered them in their lives and from what or from whom they each want VISUAL ARTS RESEARCH ? 2006 by the Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois 35</page><page sequence="2">ed protection. After sharing their concerns, students were told that they would each have the opportu nity to make a personal gargoyle in clay that could be used as an object for their personal protection. 3. McKenna (2004) asked high school students to imagine that they have each been selected for a new epi sode of Survivor Island. They will be leaving on a very small boat to get to the island. They are not permitted to take anything but themselves as rep resented by three different shapes of colored paper that symbolize the three most important qualities of their personality. They are asked to arrange the colored shapes to con vey a relationship among these three essential qualities. Once on the boat, they are told that the group's survival requires that every one give up one of the qualities of their personality. They must discard one of the col ored shapes and create a new de sign. When they land on the island, they are again told that the group's survival requires that they give up another quality of their personality. They must discard a second colored shape. After the students have gone through each of these steps and discussed their choices with their classmates, they are asked to cre ate a nonobjective design using line, shape, and color to metaphorically represent the essential aspects(s) of their personality. Narrative Structure It is critical to the thesis of this paper to observe that, in addition to the universal themes of human experience that ground each of these art problems, there is also a structure to each of the art problems that engages students in a specific kind of thinking process. Bruner (1990; 1997) would argue that both the structure of the art problem and the thinking process in voked by the art problems are narrative. Each of the art problems presents a narra tive structure that allows the student to en ter into a narrative plot as a main character within his or her own imagined world and resolve the inherent dramatic conflict from his or her personal point of view. In other words, the three holistic art problems are also examples of narrative structures that engage students in narrative thinking. The Narrative Thinking Process Long associated with his interest in educa tion and curricular reform in the 1960s, set forth in his book The Process of Education, Bruner's research interests shifted in the 1980s to the processes of cognition that occur within sociocultural contexts. Spe cifically, he was interested in ways people make meaning about the experiences they encounter in their everyday lives. Bruner (1986; 1990; 1997) asserts that the major scientific theories of cognition in the twentieth century?Behaviorism, Social Cognitive Theory, Information Pro cessing and Cognitive Constructivism? have limited the ways in which the concept of meaning-making could be investigated and applied in educational contexts. He also argues that alternative conceptions of learning and knowledge were constrained by early 20th-century philosophers in America who made a complete separa tion between the process of thinking and pure thought. The former was considered faulted because the process of thinking was considered subjective, private, con text sensitive, and idiosyncratic. On the other hand, pure thought as embodied in the propositional language of formal logic was considered able to reflect the true na ture of reality. In an effort to reconceptualize the pro cess of meaning-making beyond the lim ited paradigms of early to mid-20th century experimental psychology, Bruner (1986, 1990) drew from Vygotsky's (1962) work on social constructivism with its emphasis on culturally situated cognition as well as other scholarship in the new field of narra tive psychology (Sarbin,1986). From these 36 Sharon Johnson</page><page sequence="3">sources and related scholarship, Bruner developed his theory of narrative as a pri mary cognitive process. For Bruner (1990, p. 80), "there is a human predisposition to organize experience into narrative forms and the ability to comprehend stories is more basic to human intelligence than any thing measured through Piagetian tests of logio-mathematical development." Bruner asserts that the process of narrative think ing occurs as people negotiate meaning within sociocultural settings by construct ing, telling, and/or understanding stories about how people resolve conflict around events in their own lives. Narrative mean ing is represented through storied forms that appear as cultural myths, fictional lit erature, historical accounts, cinema, and everyday discourse of a person's life. Bruner's theory on narrative construc tion of meaning is supported by other scholars in the fields of cognitive psycholo gy and education (Egan, 1991 ; Lyle, 2000; Polkinghorne, 1988; Rosen, 1985; Siegal, 1999). All share the belief that there is a hard-wired, universal human readiness to construct meaning through narrative. Egan (pp.96-97) states, "We are storied animals; we make sense of things commonly in story forms; ours is a largely story-shaped world." Siegal focuses on the relationship between the neurobiology of the brain and the construction of narrative when he as serts: Narrative may have originated as a fun damental part of social discourse.... De scribing an interpersonal neurobiology of stories may be helpful in elucidating the fundamental processes involved in how narrative facilitates the integration of co herence within the mind. (p. 330) In the field of art education, Johnson (2001 ; 2003) has investigated the relation ship between Bruner's (1990; 1997) theory of narrative cognition/text and the art mak ing process of adolescent artists. Johnson asserts that all the critical elements of narrative cognition/text defined by Bruner were also observed in her case study of the self-initiated art work produced by an adolescent artist over a 3-year period. Grammatical and Aesthetic Components of Narrative Form Bruner (1990, p. 132) qualifies the defini tion of narrative with the disclaimer, "It is impossible to distinguish sharply what is a narrative mode of thought and what is a narrative 'text' or 'discourse'." Bruner (1990; 1997) proceeds, however, to offer definitions of the grammatical and aes thetic qualities of narrative form, which are summarized below. Grammatical Elements of Narrative 1. Dramatic content. A necessary im balance between any of the five ele ments of drama: actor, action, goals, scene, or instrument. The imbalance is the conflict or trouble that be comes resolved (1990). 2. Sequential order. Narrative events must be "linearized" in a standard way and be maintained, that is, there is a beginning, middle, and an end. The order of telling does not, howev er, need to follow the order in which events occur (1990, p. 43). 3. Sensitivity to the canonical. Narrative requires a sense of what violates the canonical in human interaction. To be worth telling, a narrative must run counter to expectancy, must breach a canonical script or deviate from "legitimacy." The function of the story is to find an intentional state that mit igates or at least makes comprehen sible a deviation from a canonical cultural pattern (1990, pp. 49-50). 4. Narrator's perspective. Narrative cannot, in the jargon of narratology, be "voiceless." The interpretive per spective of the teller must be evident to the telling of the event (1990, p. 77). Aesthetic Elements of Narrative Generic particularity. Genres are cul turally specialized ways of both envisaging and communicating about the human con Holistic Art Instruction and Narrative Thinking 37</page><page sequence="4">dition. We people our world with characters out of narrative genres; we make sense of events by assimilating them to the shape of comedy, tragedy, irony, and romance. But genre must ascend to the particular, that is, Albert Schweitzer becomes com passion (Bruner, 1997). Narrative Structure of Holistic Art Problems Using Bruner's (1990; 1997) definitions of the grammatical and aesthetic qualities of narrative, it is possible to examine more thoroughly how these elements of narrative form occur in the structure of the holistic art problem. In reference to the grammatical quality sensitivity to the canonical, it should be noted that the canonical may reference cultural expectations that exist within a range of cultural contexts including family, community, school, or those cultural expec tations incorporated into notions of self. It should also be noted that the aesthet ic quality of narrative form, generic par ticularity is the narrative equivalent of the holistic concept of lived experience. A con sideration of the content of the student's art work would be required to demonstrate how generic particularity would operate in relation to the student's lived experience. Because a consideration of the content of the student's art work is beyond the scope of this paper, the specific ways generic particularity operates can not be analyzed in the examples below, except to say that the structure of each problem allows for its occurrence. The same three holistic art problems presented below were intro duced at the beginning of this paper. Art Problem One Carroll (2004). In this problem, high school students are invited to consider journey as a metaphor. They are asked to represent the process of separating, getting lost, finding oneself, conquering a challenge, and returning home renewed. The dramatic content o\ this art problem creates conflict by imposing the conditions of separation, loss, and an obstacle that must be overcome before the main char acter can attain his or her goal o? returning home renewed. The conflict is resolved by enduring a loss of direction and conquering a challenge. A sequential order is imposed by the linear time structure of a journey that has by definition a beginning, middle, and end. The problem requires the student to be sensitive to the canonical by consider ing how the direction of his or her path may differ from the expectations of others. In this problem, the student is cast as the main character and it is his or her perspective that becomes the narrator's perspective. Art Problem Two Wittner (2004). In this problem 5th grade students are asked to turn their at tention to themselves, and think about what truly bothered them in their lives and from what or from whom they each wanted protection. After sharing their concerns, students were told that they would each have the opportunity to make a personal gargoyle in clay that could be used as an object for their personal protection. The dramatic content in this problem is created by the ways each student's goal of being safe or happy is obstructed by partic ular people (characters) or events (actions and settings) in their lives. The gargoyle object becomes the instrument for the res olution of the conflict. The sequential order of time is structured by the creation of the object in present time to address a conflict originating at an earlier time. The canoni cal expectations broached in the students' lives take many possible forms depending on the student's experience, but all relate to what are expected conditions of safety, justice, or caring. The student's identifica tion with the character and power of the gargoyle provides the instrument for the narrator's perspective. Art Problem Three McKenna (2004). Students are asked to imagine that they have each been se 38 Sharon Johnson</page><page sequence="5">lected for a new episode of Survivor Island. They will be leaving on a very small boat to get to the island. They are not permitted to take anything but themselves as repre sented by three different shapes of colored paper that symbolize the three most im portant qualities of their personality. They are asked to arrange the colored shapes to convey a relationship among these three essential qualities. Once on the boat, they are told that the group's survival requires that every one give up one of the qualities of their personality. They must discard one of the colored shapes and create a new design. When they land on the island, they are again told that the group's survival re quires that they give up another quality of their personality. They must discard a sec ond colored shape. After the students have gone through each of these steps and discussed their choices with their class mates, they are asked to create a nonob jective design using line, shape, and color to metaphorically represent the essential aspects(s) of their personality. This problem provides an excellent ex ample of how nonobjective forms (shapes of color) can assume anthropomorphic qualities within a narrative context. Once the expectation for narrative is established, any object, setting, or person may be im bued with narrative power. Thus, holistic art problems utilizing narrative structures can provide excellent strategies for engaging students in the exploration of the abstract design concepts like those encountered in the study of the elements and principles of design. In this example, the dramatic content of the art problem is created by the con flict between maintaining self-identity and the goal of survival. The resolution of the conflict requires giving up parts of self to insure survival. The sequential order of the narrative is provided by the beginning, middle, and end of the ship's journey to the island. In this narrative, the canonical ex pectation of a person's right to individual autonomy and the individual's right to per sonal survival is violated when the narra tive requires the individual to give up parts of self for the good of the group. This par ticular problem also does an excellent job of structuring the narrator's point of view. Since the art problem casts the student as the main character in the narrative, it is his or her point of view or values that will determine which personal qualities will be discarded or kept. Bruner's definitions of the grammatical and aesthetic structure of narrative form have provided the criteria for the above analysis of three examples of holistic art problems. The analysis demonstrates a structural relationship between the quali ties of the holistic art problem as described by London et al. (2004) and the narrative thinking process described by Bruner (1990; 1997). Conclusions It is argued that Bruner's (1986; 1990; 1997) scholarship on narrative cognition is well aligned with the goals and practice of holistic art instruction as described by Lon don et al. (2004). The evidence presented demonstrates that narrative operates as an organizing cognitive structure in the ex amples of art problems teachers have suc cessfully used to conduct holistic art les sons. It is further argued that Bruner's and others' scholarship on narrative thinking and the construction of narrative meaning offers art education a theory of cognition that can support holistic instructional prac tice in art education. Researchers in art education need to further examine how narrative learning processes can inform and transform the way art is currently taught in our schools. It is this researcher's belief that holistic approaches to instruction informed by an understanding of narrative cognition can be used to engage students in learning a wide range of curricular content in art? everything from art media and technical processes to visual culture. As multiple examples of successful holistic practice are beginning to emerge from the field and new scholarship is emerging on how stu dent learning occurs in narrative contexts, Holistic Art Instruction and Narrative Thinking 39</page><page sequence="6">art educators are presented with the op portunity to engage in research address ing how students learn in the arts?a sub ject neglected in the current art education scholarship which is primarily focused on what students should learn in the arts.
