The twelve studies on Arabic and Judaeo-Arabic philosophy, Jewish mysticism, and modern thought presented here display Professor Altmann's rare skill in interpreting religious motifs and in relating Jewish mystical and philosophical ideas to each other and to philosophy in general. Much of the book deals with the imagery in which God and the realm of divinity have been variously portrayed and with the manner in which philosophers have grappled with the language of anthropomorphism. A closely related theme treated here is that of man's ultimate felicity as conceived in medieval thought. The final essays critically examine three modern religious thinkers: William Wollaston, Moses Mendelssohn, and Franz Rosenzweig. 375 pages, $10.00 CORNELL UNIVERSITY PRESS Ithaca, New York</page><page sequence="3">arper Editions 1817 AN ORIGINAL WORK ON CERTAINTY by Ludwig Wittgenstein Edited by G. E. M. Anscombe and G. H. von Wright Translated by Denis Paul and G. E. M. Anscombe In this volume of notes written at the end of his life, Wittgen- stein raises problems of knowledge and certainty. He examines Moore's view that we cannot be mistaken in what we are con- vinced we know. "Is 'I know,'" he asks, "merely a grammatical proposition used in accordance with the rules of the language-game?" Again, "Why am I so certain that this is my hand? Doesn't the whole language-game rest on this kind of certainty?" This volume is another valuable extension of the Wittgenstein corpus. The German text is reproduced side by side with the English translation. 186 pp. $7.50 HARDCOVER REPRINTS OF PAPERBACK ORIGINALS HISTORICAL THINKING by Trygve Tholfsen 336 pp. $7.50 WHAT PHILOSOPHY IS by Arthur Danto 192 pp. $7.95 SPECIAL PRE-PUBLICATION FACULTY DISCOUNT 20% on the titles listed above.

W. BOWERSOCK, Harvard University. This is a full-scale analysis, the first ever to be done wholly in historical terms, of the Greek cultural renaissance of the second and third centuries A. D. That great revival, which left behind it a vast literature, is shown through a study of its representatives to be an integral and important part of the history of the Roman Empire. The surviving literary texts in Greek, Latin, and Arabic are considered in close conjunction with the abundant non-literary evidence for the various issues and personalities. $6.25 Pleasure and Desire THE CASE FOR HEDONISM REVIEWED By J. C. B. GOSLING, Oxford University. The author's belief is that recent dis- missals of hedonism have been too cavalier. This volume suggests that hedonists have been feeling their way towards points of some importance for ethics. The argument raises the question of what claims to conceptual priority or centrality might amount to, and some brief suggestions are made on this point. $4.25 Hegel's Philosophy of Nature BEING PART II OF THE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF THE PHILOSOPHICAL SCIENCES (1830) By A. V. MILLER. Those who still think of Hegel as merely an a priori philo- sopher will here find abundant evidence that he was keenly interested in and very well-informed on the sciences of his day. Far from being an expendable part of his own system, the Philosophy of Nature is integral to it and deserves the most serious attention. This translation also includes one of the Zusdtze or lecture notes, which provide valuable commentary on Hegel's own published Paragraphs. Cloth, $8.75. Paper, $4.25 The Philosophy of Plato SECOND EDITION By G. C. FIELD, second edition edited by R. C. CROSS, University of Aberdeen. The author shows that Plato's philosophy was not a fixed and final system but a continually growing and developing body of thought, and he endeavors, while always keeping closely to Plato's own words, to present this in terms readily intelligible to modern readers. For this new edition Professor Cross has added a Revised Bibliography and an Appendix reviewing some of the book's topics in light of work done on Plato since it was first published in 1949.
