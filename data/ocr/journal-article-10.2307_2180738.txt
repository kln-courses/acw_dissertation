<plain_text><page sequence="1">ON THE POSSIBILITY OF A BETTER WORLD* JN the novel position which comes to a president of such a so- ciety as this one when he is thrust upon the stage, he will search his soul with more than ordinary candor to see if there be any wisdom or knowledge appropriately to be displayed to those who, whether in confident or in gambling mood, have singled him out to play the part. One of the differences between those of us whose vocation is the study and teaching of philosophy and other reflec- tive men is that we conceal our ultimate beliefs behind a more or less unconscious mask of technicality. The pragmatists among us are disguised moralists. The realists come in the disguise of laboratory men. Then there are the logistic Sherlock Holmeses who offer to reconstruct the crime of existence by an analysis of the cigarette-ashes of our words. The logical positivists, with their claim that "every kind of metaphysics is meaningless, in short nothing but a play upon words",1 do but give us a play within the play-a play upon the play upon words. These Hamlets, thrice disguised, would have us believe that on the world's stage there is but a representation of a representation of a representation. "A philosopher", says Santayana, "cannot wish to be deceived. His philosophy is a declaration of policy in the presence of the facts; and therefore his first care must be to ascertain and heartily to acknowledge all such facts as are relevant to his action or sentiment-not less, and not necessarily more."2 But Santayana like each of us is a metaphysician at heart. His disclaimer of meta- physics, with the by-play about natural science and the wayward conduct of other metaphysicians, is but a thin disguise. If per- chance philosophy is "a declaration of policy in the presence of the facts", does he not offer for our consideration the hypothesis of a universe divided against itself-"the presence of the facts" and a "declaration of policy"-things and events on the one hand and a willed perception of them on the other? Surely this is not a promising course by which to escape a metaphysic. * The presidential address to the Pacific division of the American Philo- sophical Association at Mills College, December 29, i936. 1Hans Reichenbach, "Logistic Empiricism in Germany", Jour. of Phil.

I32</page><page sequence="2">A BETTER WORLD 133 Which of us in our sober reflection escapes the tantalizing necessity of prying more impertinently into such a dualism? Can it be that the facts and our interpretation of them are so loosely hung together that inquiry can be dismissed with this simple formula? Are the facts which we interpret the same as our inter- pretation of the facts? Are the facts relevant to our action or sentiment the very facts of nature? Such questions cannot be set aside for very long. They recur with the pertinacity and the finality of death. Through the lengthening years of man's discourse these questions are pervasive. Now and again with possible rhythms passing our comprehension they become recessive or dominant, quiescent or clamorous. In our time they are clamorous. After Kant, philosophy has been, by and large, metaphysical. It was a shrewd mind which paraphrased the cry 'back to Kant' with the sounder admonition 'back around Kant'. In Kant, the protestant reformation having divested the mind of its trust in an orthodox metaphysic based on ecclesiastical authority, there was an elaborate critique of pure reason which withered in the bud the springing hope of a meta- physic rooted within the narrow boundaries of logomachous ex- perience. The Kantian critique found fruit in empirical psychology with its descriptive analysis of 'streams of consciousness', psychic 'structures', and behavioristic 'patterns' on the one hand, and in a correspondingly empirical biophysics on the other. But the main current of philosophical speculation swept around and be- yond Kant to issue in a variety of realisms new and old. In its essence philosophy is realistic; for it addresses itself to the central, continuing and complex problem of the nature of the real world. The greatest philosophies are distinguished from the sciences, arts, and religions, by being thus realistic in intention and emphasis. This they cannot escape. I intend by this dogma to assert that all of the supreme efforts of the philosophical mind are metaphysical. All speculations con- cerning acts, words, meanings, values, internal and external rela- tions, categories, phenomena, persons, and prejudices, are but subsidiary efforts to get at the nature of things. If by this open attempt at a definition of philosophy I can persuade you to con- sider what I am about to say as more than a profession of faith</page><page sequence="3">I34 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XLVI. to be accepted or rejected by you as your prejudices in turn con- form to or diverge from mine, I shall have accomplished my initial purpose. Within the marginal shadows of the given world at any specified moment or moments lurks a possible world. What is the ontological status of the possible? No significant answer can be offered to this question at least until an agreement has been reached as to what we are to mean by the 'given world'. This definition must be established as a base within the chosen realm of discourse by reference to which any determinations of direction or distance may be made. By the 'given world' I do not mean to refer to a psychological present. The experience of a waking mind is unmistakably a part, but only a part, of such a world. The ivy-covered wall outside my window in the slanting light of an autumn sun, the pungent fumes of burning tobacco, the distant half-melody of men and machines -these fall together in my psychic span. Psychologically they are co-existent aspects of a determinate order of nature which they do not exhaust. By no stretch of my imagination am I able to suppose that the de facto world is encompassed within the feeble reach of a psychic now. The given or actual world for the purposes of this discussion is rather a determinate state of affairs here and else- where of which my experience is but a selected fragment. The characteristic distinguishing it from the possible world is that it is radically determinate. Whatever else we may mean when we speak of an actual world, we at least denote the complex, diversi- fied, stubborn, -objective state of affairs. It is necessary to suppose that physical conditions beyond my present perception are a part of such an objective state of affairs. This necessity is so obtrusive that the physical world has often been identified with the actual world. But this is misleading; for the actual world is of a surety more than matter even if matter is, as Mill called it, the "permanent possibility of sensation". If it is a fact that, as we sit here in each other's physical presence, there are co-existent processes and events beyond these walls, then those processes and events are part of the given world. Entia rationis, whether called laws of nature, universals, or objective ideas in the mind of God, belong unmistakably to the determinate world.</page><page sequence="4">No. 2.] A BETTER WORLD 135 But this is not all; for the past belongs to the actual. If it is a fact that Woodrow Wilson signed the Treaty of Versailles it is a part of the determinate world of which I speak, even if the docu- ment bearing the signature together with all subsidiary records were subsequently destroyed and with them the possibility of verification. If an eighteenth-century philosopher dreamed of perpetual peace, that fact is as ineluctable as the fact that London is now located on the river Thames, that we face each other across this room, or that there are structured processes involved in speaking and hearing. The dream of perpetual peace can occupy its station in an actual world without the slightest embarrassment. It is the perpetual peace which hangs back with leaden steps and does not venture out of the shadows of a possible world. Of whatever it may truly be said that so-and-so is or was thus-and-so, of that the actual world is constituted. By all this I mean then that the actual world is made up of "shoes and ships and sealing wax, of cabbages and kings", but also of structured events, processes, purposes, and dreams of perpetual peace. But having handed over the present and the past to the reign of complete determination, what shall be said of the future? Is it also determined or are many distinctions first to be',made? Fatalism is the theory that future events are already predetermined, i.e., fore- ordained in such a way that no present choice or action can enter as a determining factor. Fatalism does not mean that tomorrow's events are, here and now, being determined, but that they have been determined. If this supposition were entirely false it would be impossible to account for successful anticipation or prediction. If it were entirely true, though it would be possible to account for failure of anticipation and prediction by the further supposition of the fallibility of human knowledge, it would be impossible to find any rational ground for human hopes of a better world and the vast expenditure of human energy in programs of reform. I do not want to suggest that a justification of human hopes is necessary. I do not even ask whether or not it is desirable. I ask only whether or not it is possible. I shall therefore adopt the hypothesis that tomorrow is partly predetermined and partly un- predetermined.</page><page sequence="5">136 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XLVI. Consider briefly the nature of these hopes. Man finds himself alive in a dangerous world. Tremblingly he moves, looking before and after, longing for what is not. If by chance he escapes the immanent dangers of his individual environment, he takes note of and becomes concerned about the plight of his fellowmen. He generalizes on the basis of his individual needs and capacities- erecting programs of tribal, national, or international reform. Man is the planning animal. His dissatisfaction is not -only the un- easiness of the hungry carp, but it is generalized and focused upon the future. Not half only but nine tenths of life is anticipatory. The hopes of man may be discovered in many or even all aspects of his history. We in our own professional caves and dens express by our continuing activity the human hope for knowledge and understanding. In many respects this is the deepest and most abid- ing hope of all. In it there is the essence of hope, for all other hopes are at least symbolically present. Nevertheless it is hardly common enough to stand as the typical human hope, for the great majority of men do not share it, or share it only in its weakest form as instrumental to some more immediate animal striving. The zeal of this house has not eaten them up. On the whole the most uni- versal hope of our race is probably the hope of overcoming the narrow limits of finite existence. Such hopes find expression in religion. Whether the religion be at the level of low animal cunning characterized by a ritual of sacrifices and prayers to a divine power whom we may propitiate, cajole, bargain with, and even intimidate, or whether it be at the level of systematic theology-one thread of common hope runs through it all. Or consider the history of medicine, which is a kind of mundane theology, as another exhibition of man's hope. As you turn the pages of a work like Thorndyke's History of Magic and Experi- mental Science the cumulative impression of some deeper hope which lies beneath the search for health and long life is over- powering. Men are not reconciled to their mortality. Cautery, surgery, antiseptics, anaesthetics are but episodes of the vast struggle with pain, disease, weakness, and cold death. Few pause to observe that when we conquer a disease, as the current phrase has it, we but turn the victim from one to another torture. Those who do pause to reflect upon such a somber conclusion have but</page><page sequence="6">No. 2.] A BETTER WORLD I37 a step from medicine to eschatology. Confused and trivial minds at this point exhibit that strange and more poignant mystery of the struggle between hope and despair which brings religion and medicine together in the desperate abracadabra of such monstrous hypotheses as the non-reality of evil in all its forms. They seem to suppose that the defeat of their fondest dreams can be avoided by the simple device of shutting their eyes and pronouncing magic words. But messiahs appear in fields other than religion and medicine. No observant person can live to mature life unmindful of the continual rise and fall of schemes for economic and social better- ment. Here on this western shore we are in the midst of the most recent and perhaps the last outpost of a great migration which brought the Mayflower to our eastern shores and sent the covered wagon lumbering across the trackless wilderness. And for what? If you will for an idle hour cruise about on the sea of sound which comes into your living room through the mysterious devices of 'tubes', 'dials', and 'frequencies', unprejudiced in favor of "such facts as are relevant to your action or sentiment", you will discover the wake of many a passing ship bound for the ports of economic bliss. These captains and their crews are frequently guileless visionaries enchanted by a tawdry heaven of shabby creature com- forts. In bovine candor they are searching for green pastures. They can severally be dismissed as trivial, ephemeral, mercenary, dim- witted; but collectively they record the springing hope of mankind for a better social order to be -established in an apparently indif- ferent universe. But the hopes of mankind are not all equally extravagant and improbable of realization. It is a relief to turn from the somewhat melodramatic phenomena of human hopes to the more sustained labor of men on the way to civilized living. Creative art, whether pure or applied, furnishes plenty of illustration of the search for beauty, utility, and such other values as may be suggested by the quaint phrase 'the pleasures of the imagination'. Science may be summoned to testify to man's lasting desire to understand. Codified law is perhaps the most ancient expression of man's desire to escape the haphazard brutality of an undocumented, single-handed struggle with economic, social, and political forces. In law, as in</page><page sequence="7">I38 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XLVI. science and in art, there is revealed to the discerning mind more than surface phenomena of statutes, procedures, and precedents; instruments, techniques, and results. In all of these there is dis- coverable an essential yearning, not for existence, but for a quality called civilized existence. Mere existence, even an existence moving by internal forces of biophysical evolution, is distinguishable from civilization. History, enacted or recorded, is full of axiology. Valuation is the essence of it. This crucial fact must be reckoned with by philosophy. Voluntarism as a metaphysics may take the high ontological road leading from the hypothesis of a divine purpose which created the universe by a willed act, or it may take the low road -of em- pirical pluralistic meliorism with its hypothesis of the recreative power of finite wills to modify the actually existent world in the direction of human tastes. Time forbids more than mention of the vast theological speculation concerning the primacy of the will in the creative genesis of things. "Olympian Zeus", says the poet, "himself distributes prosperity to men, good or bad, to each ac- cording as he wills."3 The form of this speculation is no longer in fashion, though the essence of it is retained in current voluntar- isms. What most distinguishes contemporary will-philosophies from their classic antecedents is their humanism and avowed empiricism. "Any philosophy", says the official spokesman of the Hitler state, "is exactly as strong as the will of its representatives to defend it."4 In this extreme dictum voluntarism as a philosophy is almost reduced to a patent madness. The undisciplined frenzy of political power will one day have to reckon with an objective world which was at least partly created before Hitler was born. He is safe who ventures no farther than this in predicting the future. But the real question of interest is: To what extent and by what means can any order, political or otherwise, be willed into existence ? The voluntaristic reformer seems to start with an unchallenged acceptance of de facto desires, and expends his energy in the ac- quisition of techniques and instruments rather than in critical re- flection upon the form and limits of the desires in a structured Od.

He is frequently so absorbed in getting what he wants that he may hardly be said to know what he really wants or what the world is in which those wants occur. His meliorism is fre- quently joined with a doctrine akin to the Spencerian faith in a "far off divine event toward which the whole creation moves". There are various doctrines of emergence offered to furnish a kind of natural history of human values. They seem to agree that a coherent purposiveness arises out of a chance collocation of atoms or other determinate elements of reality, until consciousness appears with its mysterious power of catching the melody, or dis- sonance, of nature and carrying it to a greater pitch of symphonic excellence. The anthropomorphic implications of this theory are fairly evident. Man is the fruit of the tree of existence. He comes by his genius for reform naturally and undertakes the task of re- making the world with confidence. Value is treated as a simple function of human desire, and tends to be joined with operational maxims rather than with a set of categories and propositions hav- ing an intellectual or critical content. Value is carelessly taken to be a part of nature in its simple existential givenness rather than what it really is-a function of critical intelligence with its reflec- tive interpretation of the given. Meliorism, as a theory of value, implies certain metaphysical dogmas. I mention only two. First, it implies that nature is cog- nate to human desires and so articulated with them that they may become determinants of it in the plastic processes of its formation. All instrumentalisms imply such a dogma. With this I take no issue; for it seems evident to me that the classic severance of man from the rest of nature, giving him some transcendent status, can no longer hold up its head in the presence of common observation and the systematic study of the biological sciences. It may be granted by all of us, so it would seem, that, however peculiar in structure, aptitudes, habits, et cetera, man may be, he is neverthe- less bounded by and set within the vast matrix of the natural world and of a single piece and pattern with it. The second implication of meliorism is that the nature of things is not only undergoing some transformation involving and closely articulated with human desires as operative factors, but that the transformation is convergent and cumulative in the production</page><page sequence="9">140 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XLVI. and conservation of values. In order to make such an hypothesis acceptable it would be necessary, first of all, to suppose that there is an actual congruence of the de facto desires and willed acts of human beings. If the evidence on this point is sufficient, it would still be necessary to show that, in addition to the natural congru- ence of human desires, there is also an integration of them in such a way that they can become effective for the production of a better world. All institutions and organizations among men, however ephe- meral, are, as far as they go, evidence of congruent purposes. That there are some central tendencies amidst the variety, the diversity, and the conflicts, of human desires is, therefore, sufficiently at- tested. These central tendencies, however, have so far been pro- ductive of conflicting social organizations such as nations, labor unions, churches, and seem actually to have intensified the conflict between the groups rather than to have led in the direction of peace and amity among them. We seem as far from universal peace as we ever were. But however improbable such a unification or harmonization of all human interests may appear to be, it is not inherently impossi- ble. More rigorous analysis of the flux of psychological desire might yield some common denominator, some irreducible basic factor of which the others are rational variables. If a universal dictator with occult powers of insight and persuasion should arise, the minds of men might become so fused and coordinated as to be almost or quite dominated by some single common purpose. Political or religious leaders have accomplished marvels on small scales, and their reign of influence has often persisted well beyond the time of their generation. The fact that new interests have arisen to dissipate the power of such unifying ideas is no guarantee that a better analysis of human nature or a more miraculous in- tuition of its central tendency should not succeed in time to come. However improbable, therefore, let us grant that it might chance to be so. It is the second condition mentioned, namely, that a mere multi- tude of human desires, whether they be the successive desires of an individual or the simultaneous and successive desires of many men, can become effective in the betterment of the objective world,</page><page sequence="10">No. 2.] A BETTER WORLD I41 which seems to me to be inherently unrealizable. The evils which confront the race are unconquerable, not because they constitute a brute stone wall erected by a sardonic power against which men are predestined to beat out their futile lives, but because in the exercise of multiple choice itself there are far-reaching ontological effects which, in part, at least, enter creatively into the determinate constitution of the world. What a man wants is never what he gets-at the very least, he gets more than he wants, because the determinate order which makes wants and the processes of their satisfaction significant is such that X's are linked with Y's and Z's. The discovery and identification of X involves other determinate conditions and thus on to infinity. The Sisyphean labor does not suffice to make the actual and the possible worlds one. There is, however, an important difference between the desires of an individual and the desires of a society or a race. The desires of the individual may be integrated or unified through a process of critical growth. The desires of a group of individuals show no corresponding process. In order to say more nearly what I mean I need to distinguish between two kinds of desire. There are mere psychological desires which I shall call desires of the first intention, appropriating a phrase from logic. The character- istics of such a desire are a maximum degree of immediacy, ac- companied on its psychophysical side by heightened vital processes, an energizing of nerves and muscles, certain definite and appropri- ate orientation of the whole psychophysical organism to the anticipation and reception of stimuli connoted by the name of some desired object. A second desire or class of desires might be called desires of the second intention. They differ from the first in degree of immediacy and intensity, in instrumentation and direc- tion. The most significant distinction between the two classes of desire, however, amounts to a difference in kind. Desires of the first class are analogous to the particular object or event as treated in classic epistemological theory, while those of the second inten- tion are of the order of universals or generalizations. Though it would be egregious to pursue this analogy into the intricate jungle of distinctions and difficulties familiar to us all, it may furnish some connotation for the terms about to be used. The desires which appear as matters of psychological fact in or on</page><page sequence="11">I42 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XLVI. the surface of the psychic stream, or pond as the case may be, are the moment-by-moment wants of a mind or any number of such minds if taken discretely. I shall call them merely desires. When these same desires are taken in their relational or patterned integration, I shall call them the rational will or the will. Desires of the first intention, that is, in their variety and multi- plicity, may properly be attributed to the individual and to the sum of individuals which make up the race. The rational will or desire taken in the second intention, however, is a characteristic of individual minds only and not a characteristic of groups of minds however large or small. The quality and intensity or the social extensity of any given psychological desire offers no reliable indication of the proba- bility of its realization in the objective world-order. The intensity of my desire for any result is no presumptive evidence whatever of the possibility of its objective realization. It is only in so far as I desire also all means leading to it and all consequences of it in an actual determinate world that my desire for it becomes a signifi- cant index of effective realization. It is not the psychological but the logical will'which enters into the ethically significant formation of tomorrow. The evidence for an integrated or rational will as a phenomenon of a growing individual person is readily at hand. The phenomena of 'closure' or psychological integration are well known and call for no review in this connection. Where the desires or willed acts in question are the acts of a single conscious mind they 'may form an effective instrument for the reconstruction of an objective state of affairs. Such a rational will is the laborious achievement of individual minds and may almost be taken as the essence of the person. The process of growth and education by which such inte- grated persons arise is familiar to reflective minds. That the im- mediate objective order can be transformed by such rational persons is also well within the experience of each of us. But meliorism is a metaphysical not a psychological doctrine. The question for us therefore is whether or not there may be a ra- tional integration of the desires and willed acts of different individuals such as to warrant the hope of a better world as the result of combined human effort.</page><page sequence="12">No. 2.] A BETTER WORLD I43 I do not doubt that the objective structure of the social and economic order is probably in part a resultant of willed acts in their collective relation. All that I do assert is that this objective structure shows no one-to-one correspondence to any desire or impulse discoverable in the desires of the first intention or any possible collection thereof. The satisfaction of any random desire or uncoordinated number of desires at the level of the first inten- tion is as likely to make the world worse as it is to make it better. The acts of many persons taken together may produce in an objective world-order any transformation which you care to sup- pose, save only that the emergent or eventual state of affairs will be far different from what was psychologically desired by any or all of them. It will be complex, impersonal, distributive, and determinate. Suppose we imagine a society of any number of individuals each of whom is severally actuated by an identical desire for food or diversion, that is, a desire of the first intention. Make the particular supposition that every individual in the group desires a ham sandwich or an hour's diversion at the moving pictures. The direct satisfaction of either of these desires would breed or pro- duce a very complex world-order having no remote resemblance to a ham sandwich or a moving picture. It would be more like the determinate world which we actually confront. There would be breeders and farmers, slaughterhouses and Hollywoods, trans- portation and markets and-trouble. None of the individuals, being consulted, could properly declare that he contemplated the entire objective state of affairs as the object of his desire, though some of them might reasonably be expected to know enough about the interrelation of things and events of a determinate world to achieve a dispassionate view of the entire transaction and perhaps even to will it at the level of second-intention desires and thus to incarnate the rational will in their individual lives. There is a world of difference between the wild impulse to eat, to run, or to breed, and a logical will which intelligently anticipates and accepts the implications of its action. Roughly this is the difference between a biophysical existence in an actual world and a civilized life in a possible one. Individual men are capable of civilized participation in a rational or possible world. There is no</page><page sequence="13">I44 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XLVI. evidence that a group of men large or small exhibits the phenom- ena of desire at the level of second intention. The collocation of civilized individuals has as its emergent or resultant a determinate state of affairs called society. But we may not attribute to the ag- gregate or composite structure the characteristics of its several components. Here at least we seem to have an episode in evolu- tionary emergence in which the 'onward and upward' is turned back to a subpersonal and prevaluative structure. 'Better' and 'worse' have no footing in the actual world if taken all by itself. Value is a function of a perceived relation between worlds actual and possible, and occurs only at the level of the understanding mind-neither below it nor above it. I hold it to be reasonably certain that the factual satisfaction of a desire or impulse at the level of first intention has existential status but no value-significance. It occurs below the level of the understand- ing mind. Above that level in the evolutionary series is society, which has as such neither the desire and its satisfaction nor the understanding mind. A recent writer seems to say what I mean. "This is the irony of the situation. Is evolution progress? Yes, but only to those who, themselves 'produced' in the evolutionary process itself, make those assumptions, either tacitly or explicitly, that imply this conclusion. But to the evolutionary process itself, as a whole, neither 'Yes' nor 'No'. To it it is a matter of supreme indifference whether such assumptions are made as will enable one of its own products to show that it is progress or not. The Evolu- tionary Process, as a whole, does not value; it has no interests; it does not make selections as to what shall be regarded as instances of the good; it does not attempt to order these 'goods' so as to find a Summum Bonum; it does not assume one of these values to be something that is both a standard and not a standard. I con- clude, then not that value and the instances of this, Goodness, Beauty and Aesthetic value, are dependent on human beings- indeed, I maintain the opposite-but only that the selecting and the ordering is 'human'."5 He who wants peace at the level of first-intention desire must learn to want what peace entails. If peace entails war, as many reasonably suppose, then he who wants peace must learn to want 5 Spaulding, E. G., A4 World of Chance 267-8. His italics.</page><page sequence="14">No. 2.] A BETTER WORLD I45 peace and war. In the words of Heraclitus, "Homer was wrong in saying 'Would that strife might perish from among gods and men'. He did not see that he was praying for the destruction of the uni- verse; for, if his prayer were heard, all things would pass away."6 The invention of the bridge enabled men to cross the river with- out getting wet. By the same token it is not impossible that peace can be had without war. But it is certain that no peace without war can be had unless it is a complex state of affairs involving many determinate conditions, operations, and repressions. Whoever says that, if men would only be rational in times of crisis, wars could be averted is offering more than a remedy for war. If men would only be rational, crisis or no crisis, the mil- lennium would ipso facto come into being. Reason is the clue and the instrument by which the possible good may become actual; and some men are reasonable. The rewards of the rational will are the charms of philosophy according to the ancient wisdom of poets and prophets. "Until philosophers are kings, cities", says Plato, "will not cease from evil." Coming after Plato we must add-and until all men shall have achieved individually the power and wisdom of philosophy. To us who are acquainted with the context of such sentiments in Plato and throughout the history of philosophy, this is no canting arrogance. If it be rationalism or intellectualism, as I think it is, it is not therefore indistinguishable from some theories which have borne the name. It is not committed to a block universe against which James fulminated. It does not identify the rational with the real, at least not with the determinate real. It does not make a fetish of the rules of formal logic. It does not postulate a finished rational order-"a ghostly ballet of bloodless cate- gories". It merely holds to the belief that the objective order of things lends itself in some measure to the uses of the sustained and rational will of the individual, and that reason is not without prospect of building her house in a world of sticks and stones. It can agree with Peirce that the primal condition of an ordered world is the indeterminate and that order is the work of creative intelligence. The best of all possible worlds may be more like this one than 8 Heraclitus Fr. 43.</page><page sequence="15">I46 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW we suspect. In any case this world is probably a world in which reason has a chance rather than one in which everything is rea- sonable. However, I did not set out to find the best of all possible worlds but only to consider the possibility of a better one. As Plato distinguished a second best state I would distinguish a second best world. The better world is second best. Earth cannot contain it nor heaven give it birth. It is possible, and because it is possible it orders the life of a man who, dreaming, thinks; and through him it orders the world. It can never lose itself in the actual because it is a creature of a reasoned life. "Everything", says Peirce, "is possible which does not contradict the laws of reason."7 H. G.
