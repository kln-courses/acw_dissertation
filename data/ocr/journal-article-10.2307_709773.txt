On the notes, which are concerned almost exclusively with mythological matters, I am incompetent to pass judgement; they cover an imposing array of ancient and modern authorities. Practically no linguistic comment is offered; for this readers are referred (p. xxii) to Verheyk, Oder, Blum, and Martini, works of which only the last is sure to be found in most libraries. It would have been of interest to note at all events the handful of Antoninian hapax legomena, one of which, avkTral',rpm~a, occurs three times. Peterhouse, Cambridge E. J. KENNEY THE GERMANIA RUDOLF MUCH: Tacitus, Germania. 3e erweiterte Auflage. Pp. 584; 20 plates, 3 maps. Heidelberg: Winter, 1967. Cloth, DM. 48. IN the preface to the first edition of this work (1937) Much expressed wonder that so few among the many commentaries on the Germania were written by Germanists; his own work in notable measure met the need for a commentary written by one conversant with the native material of Germanic antiquity and archaeology, and it was fittingly described by J. G. C. Anderson in this journal as 'the most interesting and helpful commentary that has appeared'. A second edition, published in 1959, did no more than rectify some of the misprints of the original edition. There now appears a greatly enlarged edition, revised by Wolfgang Lange, Professor of Germanic Philology at G6ttingen. The most sub- stantial additions are those on archaeological matters, contributed by Herbert Jankuhn, Professor of Prehistory at G6ttingen. These additions, enclosed in square brackets and signed J., range from brief bibliographical notes to essays extending over several pages. So, of the 46 pages of commentary on chapters 5 (the land and its products) and 6 (arms and warfare) almost half is new material contributed by Jankuhn, and the same is true of chapters 15-1 7, the last of which includes important information on German dress. The intrinsic interest of new discoveries can too easily lead to the inclusion of material that is not strictly relevant to the text of Tacitus; this is a temptation that Lange and Jankuhn have consciously sought to avoid. Thus it is customary to illustrate the forma nauium of the Suiones (= Swedes) by the boat found in a peat-bog at Nydam in Schleswig. The boat is illustrated in the present volume too, but Jankuhn's notes (pp. 495-7 and 497-9) point out that the Nydam boat not only is some 300 years later than the time of which Tacitus writes, but lacks a re- versible stern and was propelled by oars, not paddles; a far closer parallel to Tacitus' description is a pre-Roman boat from Hjortspring. Wherever Tacitus</page><page sequence="2">18o THE CLASSICAL REVIEW makes statements about material objects, archaeological evidence increasingly enables us to confirm or deny, in whole or in part, what he says. Though skeletal remains of the Stone and Bronze Ages in Germany show a considerable mingling of racial types, Germans, at least of central and northern Europe, of the time of Tacitus show a considerable degree of similarity in height, physique, and skull (8o per cent are dolichocephalic), thus justifying Tacitus' statement habitus quoque corporum, tamquam in tanto numero, idem omnibus (chapter 4). His assertion (5. 3) that the Germans had little regard for Roman silverware does not correspond to the facts, and is therefore presumably a generalization derived from Roman ethnography about the attitude of primitive peoples to luxury and civilization. On the other hand, the statement in the same chapter that proximi . . . aurum et argentum in pretio habent is amply confirmed for the first century A.D. by the distribution of finds, which are almost exclusively confined to a strip of 200 kilometres beyond the Rhine and Danube frontiers. Other instances of important conclusions based on archaeological evidence include the existence of anthropomorphic cult-figures in wood (Germ. 9. 2-Much, p. 183), torques (I5. 2-p. 243), clothing (17. I-pp. 270, 271; 17. 2-p. 281), wine imports (23. I-p. 316), burial of weapons (27. I-p. 344), rotunda scuta (43 fin.-p. 49I), breues gladii (ibid.-p. 492). In at least one place archaeology gives strong support in favour of the manuscript reading. At the beginning of chapter 15, speaking of the retinue of a princeps, our manuscripts read 'Quotiens bella non ineunt, non multum uenatibus, plus per otium transigunt, dediti somno ciboque'; but because of statements elsewhere (including Caesar B.G. iv. i. 8 multum sunt in uenationibus; cf. vi. 21. 3) many editors from Acidalius and Lipsius onwards have made the simple deletion of non in front of multum. Analysis of bones found in settlements enables one to deduce what was the meat diet of the German of the first century A.D., and it is clear that the produce of hunting played only a small part in his diet. The argument is perhaps not quite decisive, for, as some of the examples already quoted show, what Tacitus states is not always the truth. A good example is afforded by the interpretation of the notorious sentence at the end of chapter 2 ('The name of a tribe, now called Tungri, but then named Germani, gradually came to prevail with the result that . .') omnes primum a uictore ob metum, mox etiam a se ipsis inuento nomine Germani uocarentur. Analogy with names such as Hellenes, Graeci, Welsh-all tribal names promoted to national names-makes it almost certain that such names are given, not by the tribe itself, but by the foreigners with whom they come into contact. Such a sense has been wrung from the Latin by Norden, taking a in a uictore as 'nach', dird, and in a se ipsis as 'von', eiro'. But Much correctly insists that, though this is what Tacitus ought to have said, the parallelism between a uictore and a se ipsis, in this sentence, necessitates that they should both be translated as 'von', errod. In general the present edition, like its predecessors, leaves to the Latinist detailed discussion of problems of text and linguistic interpretation; so, for the interpretation of the controversial urgentibus imperiifatis (33 fin.) Lange refers the reader to W. Steidle's consideration of the problem in Museum Helveticum, xxii (1965) 81 f. Though some attention is paid in the commentary to the most notable textual variants, the text (printed a chapter at a time, immediately followed by its commentary) has no apparatus criticus and reproduces Much's 1937 text, even where, as at 36. I (nomina superioris), Lange clearly prefers the manuscript reading, nomine superioris.</page><page sequence="3">THE CLASSICAL REVIEW 18x Though some errors and misprints are unavoidable in a work of this magni- tude, few of them will much mislead. In discussing the etymology of 'Danube' Much notes that with its German form, Donau, it is cognate with 'Don', found as a river name in England, thus giving 'Doncaster, altcymr. Cair Daun (aus Ddn)'. But the second Don in England is not, as stated, in Northumberland, but in Durham, and runs into the Tyne at Jarrow, close to the monastery where Bede spent much of his working life. The note on Romanis classibus (34. I) should not end 'im Jahre 5 n. Chr. unter Germanicus', but 'in A.D. 5 under Tiberius, and in A.D. 15-16 under Germanicus'. On 41. I it would be worth adding that though splendidissima Raetiae prouinciae colonia refers to Augsburg (Augusta Vindelicorum), it was not in fact a colonia, being raised to the status of a municipium only in the reign of Hadrian. The text of chapter 43 contains a transposed line-line I8 should stand after line 20. Much envisaged his edition as supplementing, not replacing, other editions, and the same holds good for the present edition. Within the areas of Germanic philology, antiquities, and archaeology it is the commentary to which scholars will first turn. If it pays less attention to textual, literary, and historical matters, that is the result of deliberate decision on the editor's part. But it also reflects how small has been the contribution made to the understanding of the Ger- mania by Latinists during the last thirty years. The solid underpinning of archaeological information that the revised Much commentary offers should encourage Latin scholars to look anew at the text of this aureus libellus. University of Leeds R. H. MARTIN RELIGION AND PHILOSOPHY IN TACITUS RUSSELL T. SCOTT: Religion and Philosophy in the Histories of Tacitus. (Papers and Monographs, xxii.) Pp. xiv+140. Rome: American Academy, 1968. Cloth. THIS book, shrouded under the uniform cover of Papers and Monographs of the American Academy at Rome, may not get the attention it deserves. It is a valuable contribution to Tacitean scholarship, written at times in a lively kind of shorthand, with long digressive footnotes. It follows Fabia, Syme, Klingner, and P6schl in treating Tacitus not as an 'isolk' but as 'le representant le plus typique d'une 6poque' (Fabia's phrases). The printing (in Rome) includes an unusually large number of errors, especially in Latin quotations. Scott's general topic, presented in the first chapter, is the Roman religious and ethical tradition as it relates to the structure and presentation of the Histories. In the main part of the work Scott examines particular passages, where he maintains that religious preoccupations have informed the structure and embody the significance of the narrative. Scott makes no artificial distinction between Tacitus as thinker and as artist. The first chapter, 'Roman Religion', is a focusing chapter consisting of compressed statement rather than argument. Roman religion was a matter of state obligation, imposing a collective morality and concerned with securing right relationships with the gods. Such relationships had been achieved in the past, by ritual observances, and could by careful ritual practice and by the observation of omina and prodigia be achieved again. Scott regards this tradition</page></plain_text>
