<plain_text><page sequence="1">cultural interpretations and intracultural variability in Navajo beliefs about breastfeeding ANNE L. WRIGHT-University of Arizona, Tucson MARK BAUER-Navajo Community College, Shiprock CLARINA CLARK-Navajo Community College, Shiprock FRANK MORGAN-Navajo Community College, Shiprock KENNETH BEGISHE-Shonto, Arizona Body symbolism has been an important subject of anthropological inquiry. The body provides a complex structure available to all cultures, one that can "stand for any bounded system," and "the functions of its different parts and their relation afford a source of symbols for other complex structures" (Douglas 1966:138) that are important in particular cultural contexts. As such, the body has always been one important means of metaphoric expression and symbolic commu- nication, transmitting "information for and from the social system" (Douglas 1971:387). The meanings attached to the body, its boundaries and fluids, are constructed on the basis of cultural understandings rather than universal physiologic facts. Consequently, societies differ in their interpretations of bodily functions in ways that reflect social organization, the natural world (Bastien 1985), and other culturally meaningful symbols. For example, perceptions of the body often mirror kinship and other aspects of social organization. In their excellent review of the "ways in which society is inscribed on the expectant canvas of human flesh," Scheper- Hughes and Lock suggest (1987:19) that until recently, when the mechanics of reproduction came to be better understood, Western theories of reproduction reflected the prevailing bilateral kinship system more than scientific evidence. At the other end of the spectrum, O'Neill has suggested that social institutions themselves are created in the image of the human body; people Societies differ in their interpretations of the body and its fluids in ways that seem to reflect the organization of society, the natural world, and other culturally meaningful symbols. However, portrayals of these interpretations, often both static and concealing, mask internal diversity, change over time, and methodologic forces for consistency. This article reports on beliefs about breastfeeding gleaned from ethnographic interviews with 35 Navajo men and women, and from survey interviews with 250 postpartum Navajo women. Working with Navajo consultants, the authors developed a "cultural text," a coherent portrayal that synthesized respondents' beliefs. The text stressed certain beliefs: that breastfeeding is proper behavior, that it is a means of passing on the mother's attributes, and that it is a means of showing children they are loved. However, only a minority of the ethnographic interviews elicited these beliefs, and only about half the Navajo women surveyed agreed with them as statements. These findings suggest that meanings attached to the body are dynamic, changing over time as aspects of the cultura I context are a tered; diverse, reflecting individual experiences and exposure to varied beliefs; and contingent, being influenced by data collection and interpre- tation techniques.

Thus, the body serves both as a means of expression and as a way of conceptualizing the surrounding world. The meanings attached to breastfeeding, as the universally available means of feeding human infants, also vary across cultures. Among the Bambara, a periurban patrilineal and patrilocal culture in Mali, children are thought to be of the same blood as the mother, not through birth but through nursing (Dettwyler 1988). Thus, two children who have been nursed by the same woman cannot marry, even if they are biologically unrelated. Similarly, Fijians believe that when a woman breastfeeds a child who is not her own, a special bond and a concomitant sense of responsibility develop (Morse 1985). However, breast milk and breastfeeding are not universally regarded as symbols of nurturance and love. In an impoverished area of northeast Brazil, breast milk is distrusted, seen as "worthless," dirty, sour, or curdled, an image that Scheper-Hughes interprets (1984:544) as a metaphor related to the scarcity and bitterness of life for women there. Haitian women consider thin, watery milk worthless (Farmer 1988), and they worry that it may be turned to poison as a result of some malignant emotion. Women in industrialized societies voice similar negative perceptions (Jones and Belsey 1977). While concerns about the quantity and quality of breast milk are common (Hull and Simpson 1985), exaggerated views such as these seem to reflect larger conflicts about maternal responsibilities. Clearly, interpretations of breastfeeding vary across cultures, depending on social, economic, and perceptual factors. While we have stated that cultures differ in the meanings they ascribe to the body, one of the major advances in interpretive anthropology in the past decade has been the recognition that the notion of culture as a shared body of knowledge-"culture as consensus"-is simplistic. From a more modern perspective, culture is regarded as a multivocal exchange, as an ensemble of behaviors (Clifford 1988:31) that rather than being uniform, reflects substantial intracultural variability. Static representations of cultural beliefs neglect the diversity of beliefs about the body that may exist in a particular culture, a diversity fostered by role and class differences (Martin 1987) as well as by differences in the "lived experience" of the body (Scheper-Hughes and Lock 1987). Further, they do not reflect the changes that must occur in beliefs over time, some of which have been documented (Gallagher and Laqueur 1987) in industrialized societies. Consideration of these issues has informed several recent discussions of gender differences in herbal knowledge (Browner 1991), the evolution of beliefs about AIDS among Haitians (Farmer 1990), and decisions about the treatment of illness in rural Costa Rica (Mathews and Hil 1 990). A second important development in interpretive anthropology has been an increasing recognition of the role that the ethnographer and his or her data-gathering techniques play in the creation of a particular interpretation (Clifford and Marcus 1986). Clifford has shown (1988:10) how strategies used to uncover "constricted domains of truth, [the] serious fictions" of ethnographic inquiry, change over time, thereby changing the resulting ethnographic portrayals. The methods anthropologists commonly use may have contributed to overly static portrayals of beliefs. Specifically, discussions with a few "key" consultants, often selected on the basis of their "traditionality" and articulateness, may elicit a false sense of uniformity. Although the beliefs professed by the more articulate consultant are more poetic and consistent, interviews with a larger number of individuals may reveal a significant disparity in beliefs. The ethnographic portrayal is therefore influenced by what questions we ask, of which respondents, and under which circumstances (Briggs 1986), as well as by what processes we use to interpret the data. In this article, we explore Navajo beliefs about breastfeeding and show how our data collection and interpretive strategies have shaped the resulting portrayal. Ethnographic inter- views with articulate Navajo respondents formed the basis of a cultural interpretation of breastfeeding that we then developed in discussions between anthropologists and native experts 782 american ethnologist</page><page sequence="3">in Navajo culture. After presenting this "cultural text," we discuss differences in our respondents' beliefs and consider the process of creating the text itself. We also analyze our survey interviews with younger Navajo women to determine to what extent traditional notions are espoused by individual women who have recently given birth. This combination of approaches permits us to consider how data collection and interpretive strategies affect results, and to look at the roles of consensus and diversity, continuity and change, in anthropological understandings of body symbolism. cultural background Navajo society has been extensively studied and documented (Aberle 1963; Kluckhohn and Leighton 1946; Reichard 1928).1 Navajo social life is organized around localized matrilineal clans, whose major function is to regulate marriage and sexual relations as well as kinship and cooperation networks. Personal property is individually acquired, possessed, and disposed of, so Navajo men and women acquire wealth independently. At least in the past (Reichard 1928), however, inheritance followed clan lines: children inherited from their mothers, and when a man died, his property went to his siblings and their children. The preferred form of residence after marriage was with the wife's family, although there has always been diversity in postnuptial residence. These social rules have fostered enduring networks of women who assist one another with child care, transportation, and the obtaining of food or other resources (Conte 1982; Lamphere 1977). Current lifestyles on the reservation are diverse: some traditional families live in remote "camps" and rely on their sheep for food, while modern families live in small towns and work 9-to-5 jobs. Although economic relations and household structure have changed dramatically over the decades, the clan structure remains absolute. Few beliefs regarding breastfeeding are reported in the early literature on Navajo society. Bailey cites (1950:90) one informant as saying, "If the mother doesn't nurse the baby, it's pretty hard for her to claim it. It looks like it doesn't belong to her." Consequently, women were told to drink lots of broth, eat lots of meat, and use herbs to maintain milk production (Bailey 1950; Kluckhohn 1947). More recently, Kunitz and Levy (1981:383) have stated that breast milk is considered a weak food and therefore fit only for infants; it is not clear if this belief is attributable to modern or to past generations. The literature goes into greater detail on traditional feeding practices. In the 1940s, Bailey observed (1950) that newborns were given a mixture of corn pollen and water before nursing; it served as an emetic, which caused them to vomit any swallowed amniotic fluid, and as a blessing for the new life. Sometimes augmented with goat's milk, the mixture was given whenever the child cried during the four days following birth or until the mother's milk came in. Kluckhohn suggests (1947) that colostrum was not given.2 Infants were fed goat's, cow's, or sheep's milk by bottle if the mother's milk failed. All sources (Bailey 1950; Kluckhohn 1947; Leighton and Kluckhohn 1947) agree that Navajo infants were fed on demand. It was commonly left up to the child to determine when to be weaned, which was usually between 18 and 24 months of age. ethnographic and analytic methods Ethnographic interviews were conducted with 35 Navajo women and men between Novem- ber 1988 and March 1989, and from those interviews we developed a cultural interpretation of breastfeeding.3 The interviewees included women of childbearing age as well as older, more traditional Navajos. The older respondents were frequently chosen on the basis of their reputations as knowledgeable sources on traditional Navajo culture, although some were approached randomly, as they happened to be home when the interviewers drove by. The younger respondents were often acquaintances of the interviewers, assoc.ated with Navajo cultural interpretations 783</page><page sequence="4">Community College, or approached randomly at clinics or flea markets. Twelve of the interviews were conducted in Navajo. The younger respondents usually spoke English, but expressed many ideas in Navajo. Both the ethnographic and the survey interviews occurred at three research sites (Shiprock, New Mexico; Kayenta, Arizona; and Gallup, New Mexico), which were chosen to reflect the diversity of lifestyles on the reservation, from the economically developed east to the more traditional, rural west. For the ethnographic interviews, we made no attempt to select a representative sample of respondents. Rather, we sought respondents who were articulate and knowledgeable about traditional beliefs regarding breastfeeding. Additional interviews were conducted until no new beliefs were elicited. Respondents ranged in age from the late teens to the mid-seventies and in occupation from shepherd to secretary. The ethnographic interviews were open-ended and wide-ranging in an attempt to explore how various infant feeding practices were related to daily life, to family and kinship, and to cultural meanings both traditional and modern. The interviewers began with a general descrip- tion of the research problem and avoided questions that would structure the responses too much. (A common strategy for eliciting naturally structured text from the younger group was to ask each respondent to talk about her experiences feeding her most recent child.) In that way, interviewers could generate questions based on specific terms and situations that arose naturally from the respondents' own descriptive texts, thus avoiding the problem of eliciting expected answers. In some cases they asked supplementary questions based on material from previous interviews, hoping to obtain more extensive responses. Interviews were tape-recorded and transcribed so that we could use the respondents' own words in the analysis. The first step in our analysis was to identify key words or phrases that referred to important concepts, actions, or objects. Careful literal translations of Navajo terms, and of the sentences in which they appeared, were used to develop folk definitions of the terms. We then explored the relationship between these and other important terms by analyzing certain textual structures, notably taxonomy and causality. In meetings of the research staff, we expanded the analysis by discussing the resultant taxonomies and exploring how the emergent concepts articulated with previous understandings of the Navajo universe, child development and traditional oral instruction.4 Two of us (Anne Wright and Mark Bauer) summarized the resultant portrayal of Navajo beliefs about breastfeeding in a document that we then submitted to the other authors for comments and revisions. A final version of that document follows. awee' t'aa ho hatt'o': the baby feeds from one Breastfeeding is part of a large corpus of beliefs regarding proper traditional Navajo behavior. The Holy People gave the Navajo detailed instructions (dine be'iina) regarding proper care for all the objects that had been bestowed on them. Caring for these objects involves having proper judgment and goals (proper thinking, or ya'at'6ehgo ntsahakees) and doing acceptable, respect- able things (yia't'6ehgo na'adi), the result of which will be a successful life. At the most general level, acceptable behavior entails observing taboos, caring for one's self, and caring for children (aichini baa ahojilyi). During pregnancy, one cares for the child by eating right and, to appease the supernaturals, by avoiding prohibited behavior such as tying knots. In addition, one participates in proper rituals, including the Blessing Way, to assure an easy delivery, promote healing, and hasten the return to harmony. Once a child is born, the parents and other adults have a responsibility to raise it in the proper way. Thus, after birth, respectable and acceptable behaviors include teaching, disciplining, and breastfeeding or aw6e' t'aa h6 hat t'o', literally, "the baby feeds from one." Breast milk is one of three different types of bodily fluid in the Navajo universe (see Figure 1). There are the sacred fluids, which are associated with life: blood, semen, and breast milk. 784 american ethnologist</page><page sequence="5">There are also the by-products of bodily functions: sweat, tears, and urine. Finally, there are the fluids that are considered dangerous and powerful, which must be handled with care and must not be touched after disposal. One of these, amniotic fluid, can be dangerous to the infant, so the newborn is given an emetic to induce vomiting. Menstrual fluid is also considered dangerous, possibly because it is associated with witchcraft (Bailey 1950; Reichard 1928),5 matter out of place (Douglas 1966), the mysterious power to create (Frazer 1941), and infertility (Wright 1983). Babies are nourished by bodily fluids beginning at conception. According to Navajo belief, they are created from the bodily fluids of the mother and father, from the semen (t6biyjizh) and either the menstrual fluid or the female sexual fluid (toalahnaschchiia). During pregnancy, the mother's bodily fluids nourish the unborn baby. After birth, there were traditionally four days of sacred care, after which time the baby continued to be nourished by the mother's bodily fluids, that is, breast milk: "And then the baby was to be fed from the mother's breast, the fluid of the mother's body; it came into existence and it continued to be fed from the mother's body to grow in a normal way," as one of our respondents put it. Breastfeeding furthers the body building that began with conception. The nursing mother is enjoined to care for herself to be sure she has enough milk for the baby. She is supposed to watch what she eats-to drink a lot of broth, eat a lot of food, and avoid chilies. Several respondents noted that in the past, women were told to eat the good, nutritious "old" foods: homegrown corn, squash, mutton, and its broth. By taking care of herself and nursing, a mother assures good nutrition for herself and the baby: "Your baby is healthy when you breastfeed. You watch what you eat, they nurse all that, and they live healthy." Because breastfeeding is part of the proper way to care for infants as decreed by the Holy People, it is expected to promote a successful life. As one respondent said: "You don't just goof off, you don't eat the wrong things, you don't do the wrong things, and you start [chi dren] way back then [by breastfeeding]. Children do better in school and in life if they are breastfed." Another respondent agreed, stating, "Breastfed children are raised good; their life is good." By demonstrating that responsible people engage in proper behavior and by providing optimal nourishment, the mother assures a successful life for her child.

The Navajo taxonomy of body fluids. cultural interpretations 785</page><page sequence="6">the physical benefits of breastfeeding Breastfeeding is thought to promote the physical growth and development of infants in a variety of ways. Human milk is thought to be more nutritious than formula. Thus, breastfed infants are said to be healthy and strong (ti'a h6 hats/ yitro'go aw6' bitahg6o ya'ahoot'eeh) and to have nice, healthy bodies (awe' bits'iis nizh6oni. Breast milk also promotes the growth of good, strong teeth. One woman told us: "My grandchildren are bottlefed. Their teeth are somehow. ... They have crooked teeth. The breastfed ones have very good, straight, smooth teeth." Development is said to be faster in breastfed children, with breastfed infants being more likely to walk by the time they are a year old: "We were told [breastfeeding] was good for babies, and they start walking without any problems." Many respondents noted that breastfeeding protected infants from illness: [The elderly said] that breastfeeding was good. And [children] didn't get sick if you breastfed them too. They didn't really catch a cold or anything. After I got them off [the breast] it seemed like they all came down with colds and got sick all the time. One respondent even reported that breastfeeding saved one "a lot of time going to the clinic." Some respondents did not distinguish colostrum from breast milk, but others asserted that colostrum was nutritious in its own way: "The first milk that comes out, that's good for them too." Still others noted that ewe's colostrum was particularly nutritious and was sometimes used to make bread that helped control infant diarrhea. Many people discussed breastfeeding in terms of their experience with sheep. Bottlefed lambs (or, in the words of one consultant, "disowned sheep") are considered runts; they are less well cared for and get sick more easily than breastfed ones. They are useful as food but are not considered strong enough to reproduce: When they are fed from the mother's body... they will grow in health, and in two or three months they will be big. You see, sheep are similar: when they feed on local plants the lambs will be perfect; in the same way the people will be in health. When the baby is breastfed it will be able to walk in one year and will be active.... As the baby is breastfed from ones own body, it will be normal in every way. Sheep are of central importance in Navajo culture, both symbolically (Witherspoon 1975) and pragmatically, as a source of food and wealth. The use of sheep as a metaphor suggests both the salience of breastfeeding and its status as traditional proper behavior. the psychological benefits of breastfeeding Navajo feel that breastfeeding provides not only nourishment but a variety of psychological benefits as well. First and foremost, by nursing her baby a mother marks the child both as her own and as human, part of a larger society. If the nursing came from the mother then there was no identity problem. The young child would automatically feel that that's the mother and there is that closeness. The child is more secure, and also the child is stronger mentally for it, because of the attachment and the identification and the self-esteem for the child. [We] always felt that putting a child on a bottle was rather alien, not natural, and we felt like you were rejecting your child by alienating it, by giving the child a bottle. There was no human comfort or the human stroking which was very beneficial to children. Our consultants noted that "T'aa h6 hatoo' yidlI," "The mother feeds the baby her bodily fluids," is a philosophical statement: by nursing her baby, the mother is feeding it a part of herself, passing on both traditional values and some of her own attributes. One important attribute that may be communicated through breastfeeding is the sense of family. One respondent explained her decision to breastfeed with reference to the wonderful foster home in which she had grown up: Maybe it's the family environment. Over there [where she had grown up] a family is a family. The environment was all right. Maybe that's what got me into doing it. Like over here, the family is not a family. Mostly broken families over here. Over there the families stay together and all that. By breastfeeding, this mother hoped to assure that her family would remain close. 786 american ethnologist</page><page sequence="7">From a psychological standpoint, breastfeeding is valuable because it shows children that they are loved: For me, breastfeeding was the time to sit and be with my babies, just talk to them and hold them. That was about the only time I really got the chance to be with my babies. So that was very important for me, that time to get really close to them and just be with them. For me, bottlefeeding is like you're holding them way over there and ... that's not really being close.... I feel that you're showing them you love them when you're nursing them. In the words of another respondent: "Breastfeeding provides a sense of security to let children know they are loved, and when you hold them close you express the love you have for them." As the result of this sense of security, breastfed children are emotionally closer to their parents: "[My mother] told me that it will keep your kids a lot closer to you if you breastfeed them." Another respondent attributed her close relationship with her children to breastfeeding:'"l'm really close to my children. I think it started from the beginning: how they were fed, how they were treated, how you talk to them and hug and hold them. I think it's important." As the result of this attention and closeness, infants who are fed bodily fluids are better able to "hear" the Navajo teachings: You see, if a baby is breastfed and partakes of the mother's bodily fluid, the child will be teachable. You see, when a baby doesn't partake of the mother's body fluid, it will have discipline problems. Babies that are bottlefed have been fed the fluid of something other than the mother and [are] affected in this way. Another respondent stated: "When they are breastfed, they listen. Kids don't listen when they are bottlefed." Children whose lives are begun in the properway, in the manner the Holy People directed, are better able to hear other Navajo teachings. the use of breast-milk substitutes As one might expect, the introduction of formula is thought to have had a variety of deleterious effects. Generally, people feel that bottlefeeding is not the right way to feed an infant. Bottlefeeding was not part of the original teachings: I for one have spoken against it; this custom [bottlefeeding] was never given to be part of the Navajo way of life [doo sh/ nihaa deet'Oda ei biniinaa at'e]. You see, we as Navajos have done wrong by accepting this custom. Because of it our children have been affected, and [it has] disrupted their way of life. As a corollary to the notion that breastfeeding demonstrates a child is loved, several respondents asserted that bottlefed children were not loved. Some babies are said to be bottlefed because the mothers do not want the child. Rather than holding the baby close, it is said, such mothers just "stick the bottle in the baby's mouth" and pay no attention to the baby: My sister used to prop up the bottle against the pillow and into the baby's mouth. She'll be doing other things like working and cooking, and the baby starts crying. She just puts the bottle into the baby's mouth. She doesn't pay attention, she just goes outside and the milk is just leaking. Bottlefed babies may be permanently damaged by the neglect: "[They] needlessly cry all the time, and they will develop an inner feeling of rejection that will never be cured. And perhaps in later years, because of the inner hurt, the children will be abnormal in some way." A baby who is thought to cry "needlessly" distresses all observers and reflects poorly on the parents, for Navajos feel that babies should not experience discomfort. In the past, a crying baby would have been given the breast quickly (Kluckhohn 1947:46). Bottlefed infants are fed the fluids of something other than the mother. Because an infant is thought to take on the attributes of the woman who feeds it, bottlefeeding is associated with aberrant behavior. Because they are fed a form of cow's milk, our respondents said, bottlefed children end up wandering up and down along the side of the road like cows, with few ties to their people: "My grandchildren, they are bottlefed. They are cow babies. Because the grandchildren are bottlefed, they don't listen." Bottlefeeding is blamed for bad behavior generally: "I wonder if bottlefeeding is the reason why children have bad behaviors." More specifically, several respondents linked bottlefeeding to alcoholism: "There's just the one cultural interpretations 787</page><page sequence="8">[person] who was bottlefed. He's been drinking [alcohol]. Maybe he's doing that because of that [bottlefeeding]." Bottlefed infants are thought to be less healthy than breastfed babies: The present generation are now bottlefed, and it is not beneficial. You see, their teeth are affected and they are weakened by bottlefeeding.... This custom was never given to be part of the Navajo way of life. Another respondent noted: My sister, she just stuck the bottle into her kids' mouths. But then her kids, they got constipated; they got sick a lot; they got ear infections. Almost every time I saw them they had a cold. Something, always sick. It seems like every little bit of draft got them sick.6 Attitudes about the breast are also changing, in part because it is less common to see a woman nursing. The word for breast milk, habe' literally means "one's milk" (h indicates the possessive "one's"; abe'means "milk"). The word for breast, habe', thus derives from the word for "milk." Some modern husbands tease their wives about breastfeeding in public, saying that there is something nasty (baayahasin) about it: At the time I was young and embarrassed to let anybody see it [her breast]. It seemed like I was shy at that time, and I was embarrassed. I didn't want my husband to see it although he already knew, but it seems like he was going to make fun of me. In the past, seeing a woman breastfeeding was common and acceptable. coherence of and diversity within the cultural text The beliefs that make up this cultural text are interesting, with some being, to our knowledge, unique to the Navajo. First is the notion that breast milk is one of the objects or behaviors specifically given to the Navajo by their spiritual ancestors. Werner, Manning, and Begishe (1983:583) state that reference to this class of items is usually made only when speakers are implicitly contrasting themselves with others (or, in their words, "enemies"). Such references commonly lead to discussions of what constitutes a good or a bad life for the Navajo. The Navajo classification of bodily fluids is elaborate, with a variety of rules for dealing with each type of fluid. The belief that a mother marks a child as her own and passes on certain attributes by breastfeeding is unique, as is the notion that breastfed infants are better behaved than others. Finally, unlike Western thinking, Navajo beliefs about breastfeeding-and about life in gen- eral-emphasize a continuity between mind and body. Rather than perceiving a dichotomy between spirit and matter, between mental and physical entities, the Navajo see action as a continuation of thought: proper thinking leads to proper behavior, which in turn leads to success in life. This constellation of bel iefs is consistent with several central tenets of Navajo society. Perhaps most important, it reflects the importance of the mother as a person and as a symbol in Navajo society. In Reichard's words (1928:51), "wherever the mother is is home." The mother-child bond is the primary bond of kinship and the model for all kinship relations: "The solidarity of mother and child, symbolized in patterns of giving life and sharing items which sustain life, is projected in Navajo culture as the ideal relationship between and among all people" (Wither- spoon 1975:125). The sharing of food, another important symbol of solidarity, of relationship, of kinship, is also evoked in discussions of breastfeeding. The preparation and consumption of such traditional Navajo fare as mutton stew, fried bread, and coffee is the focus of much activity on ceremonial occasions. Assisting with food preparation at such times displays the type of cooperation that is considered a hallmark of kinship (Lamphere 1977). By feeding her infant with her own bodily fluids, the mother provides the original symbol of relationship, of solidarity, of nurturing. 788 american ethnologist</page><page sequence="9">By nursing, it is believed, the mother passes on certain of her own attributes as well as the breast milk. This notion is reminiscent of the fact that Navajo receive another important attribute from their mothers: clan identity. It is through the mother that a Navajo child is identified as a member of a clan and, indeed, as a member of society. Scheper-Hughes and Lock have noted (1987) that in a unilineal society, folk theories emphasize the reproductive contribution of the gender emphasized in that society. While this hypothesis has not been tested here, it is supported by the Navajo interpretation of breastfeeding in this matrilineal society. Our portrayal of Navajo breastfeeding beliefs is coherent and logical, given Navajo social structure and philosophy generally. However, its coherence masks internal diversity. First, relatively few respondents cited the notions that seem to be uniquely Navajo. Table 1 displays the percentage of ethnographic interviews in which each belief was cited. Only five (14.3 percent) of the 35 respondents said that breastfeeding demonstrated proper thinking and behavior, and only two (5.7 percent) described breastfeeding as the feeding of bodily fluids. Two other hallmarks of traditional thinking, the notions that breastfed children are better behaved and that breastfeeding passes on the mother's attributes, were cited by four (11.4 percent) and two (5.7 percent) respondents, respectively. Statements that reflected beliefs overlapping with Anglo notions were much more common, with the belief that breastfeeding protects the child from illness cited in 22 (62.9 percent) of the 35 ethnographic interviews. Second, the respondents who cited uniquely Navajo beliefs were not representative of the sample. A total of nine respondents were responsible for giving the five uniquely Navajo answers listed (two mentioned more than one). Eight of these respondents were from Kayenta, the most rural of the three sites, and were over 60 years old; of the nine, seven were interviewed in Navajo. Respondents from all three areas mentioned some of the "overlap" ideas, but it should be recalled that all of the overlap ideas also reflect traditional Navajo beliefs about breastfeed- ing. In all cases, the respondents appeared to believe their statements rather than simply to report them. beliefs about breastfeeding among postpartum Navajo women survey methodology We have shown that in the ethnographic interviews, our articulate Navajo respondents revealed a diversity of beliefs about breastfeeding and that itwas principally older men and women, speaking in Navajo, who cited traditional beliefs. A second group of interviews was conducted with 250 Navajo women of childbearing age to see how traditional beliefs were reflected in the statements of modern mothers. These respondents were recruited while they waited for postpartum appointments at the Women, Infants and Children (WIC) or at Indian Health Service (IHS) clinics, while they worked at Navajo Community College, or while they waited for classes at the college. Other respondents were simply approached randomly at clinics or flea markets. The research team developed a structured, open-ended questionnaire that covered notions elicited in the earlier ethnographic interviews as well as hypotheses gleaned from the literature on breastfeeding beliefs. Respondents were asked who had influenced their thinking about feeding choices, what their mothers and grandmothers had said about feeding, and whether they knew of traditional sayings about breastfeeding. Finally, they were asked to indicate on a checklist if they agreed or disagreed with a series of statements about breastfeeding that had been elicited in the ethnographic interviews. The open-ended questions were asked early in the interviews, while the checklist was used near the end. The questions were generally asked in English, but appropriate Navajo translations were listed on the survey form if clarification was necessary. cultural interpretations 789</page><page sequence="10">-4&lt;^~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~Table 1.

The first two uniquely Navajo items are difficult to ask about in a yes-or-no question. Thus, they were volunteered by some women in response to the open-ended questions, but we made no attempt to el icit them in the checklist. Two other notions that are not to our knowledge in general circulation in Anglo society, that breastfed children are better behaved and that breastfeeding passes on maternal attributes, appeared in the checklist and were volunteered by some women. A final group of statements appearing in the checklist had also been elicited in ethnographic interviews as aspects of traditional Navajo belief about breastfeeding. However, these ideas overlap with Anglo notions, such as that breast feeding is better than bottlefeeding or that breastfeeding protects a chi Id from illness. On average, women in the survey were 27 years old (they ranged from 14 to 42), had completed high school, and had 2.7 children. Slightly more than half (52 percent) were married. Most (60 percent) described themselves as being both traditional and modern, while 31 percent considered themselves modern and 9 percent traditional. Fifty-four percent were not working outside the home or going to school.7 A high percentage of the respondents (81 percent) had initiated breastfeeding, with 47 infants receiving formula only (Wright and Bauer 1992). Most of the women (62 percent of all respondents and 48 percent of those who breastfed at all) had also introduced formula in the first week, resulting in the "combination feeding" pattern that predominates among the Navajo. On average, exclusive breastfeeding lasted 4.6 weeks and partial breastfeeding continued another 3.9 months; formula was the first breast milk substitute given for most (85 percent) infants who were not being breastfed exclusively. Because this article focuses on breastfeeding beliefs rather than behaviors, all 250 respondents are included in the analysis, regardless of how they fed their infants. volunteered responses A total of 19 women (7.6 percent) volunteered the idea that breastfeeding was proper behavior. (In the words of one woman, "You don't see cows and horses buying bottles.") Five respondents (2 percent) indicated that the mother's bodily fluid was best: "Breastfeeding gives the proper fluid for a baby; it's not man-made." Five women (2 percent) had heard that breastfeeding made a child better behaved, while two (0.8 percent) made statements reflecting the idea that breastfeeding passes on maternal values or attributes: "This baby was special. She had a chance to get what mothers give their babies." In some cases these responses clearly reflected the respondents' opinions; whereas in others the respondents seemed to be reporting what they had heard. Forty-one respondents mentioned other traditional beliefs, such as that breastfeeding helps the child grow faster or develop stronger teeth. checklist responses A much larger percentage of the respondents agreed with traditional Navajo statements when such statements were included in the checklist. Almost 57 percent felt that breastfeeding passed on certain of the mother's attributes or values. Additionally, 46.4 percent believed that breastfeeding ensured good behavior in a child. An even higher percent- age agreed with the checklist statements that overlapped with Anglo perceptions. A full 97.6 percent felt that breastfeeding was better for the baby than bottlefeeding, 95.6 percent felt that it protected the baby from illness, 94 percent felt that it made the mother and child closer, and 87.6 percent felt that it gave the child a sense of security. While almost half of the respondents espoused beliefs that appeared to be distinctively Navajo, only 38 women said that someone had told them "traditional Navajo beliefs about how to feed babies." One striking finding evident in Table 1 is that a much smaller percentage of respondents volunteered a particular belief than agreed with a checklist statement reflecting that belief. This was true to some extent for the "overlap" beliefs, and still more so for the traditional Navajo beliefs. For example, while less than one percent of the respondents said that breastfeeding cultural interpretations 791</page><page sequence="12">passed on a mother's values or attributes, 56.6 percent agreed with such a statement in the checklist. To find out whether those who cited traditional beliefs differed from those who did not, we constructed a variable measuring how many of the four primary traditional beliefs each woman cited, either voluntarily or in response to the checklist. None of the 250 respondents cited all four. Seventy-two women cited none, 85 cited one, 84 cited two, and 9 cited three. We combined the last two categories to provide a larger group for analysis. Women who cited two or three beliefs were significantly more likely to consider themselves "traditional" (40 percent) or "both modern and traditional" (42 percent) than "modern" (26 percent; x2 = 10.3, p &lt; .05). These women were also older: the average age of those citing two or more beliefs was 27.2 years; of those citing one belief, 25.8 years; and of those citing no traditional beliefs, 24.8 years (p &lt; .05). Mean years of education and research site were unrelated to the number of traditional beliefs a woman held. When asked directly, women who cited two or more traditional beliefs were more Iikely than the others to say that they knew some traditional beliefs (47 percent versus 34 percent; x2 = 6.8, p &lt; .05) and that traditional beliefs influenced their feeding practices (55 percent versus 28 percent; x2 = 6.9, p &lt; .05). cultural and individual beliefs: coherence and diversity, persistence and change In this article we have analyzed Navajo beliefs about breastfeeding using several interview and interpretation strategies. We have created a cultural text suggesting that traditionally, breastfeeding was considered a display of proper behavior, the most nutritious way to feed an infant, and an indication that a child was loved. Breastfed children were said to be better able to "hear" traditional teachings, to be well behaved, and thus to be on the path to a good life. However, while this text may reflect certain cultural beliefs about breastfeeding among the Navajo, it masks substantial intracultural variability. Rather than being uniformly volunteered by our respondents, the core traditional beliefs were only elicited in interviews with a few individuals, suggesting that textual coherence is an artifact of methodology. Methodological forces for consistency do exist. Discussions of the research staff focused on abstracting central concepts from the interviews, identifying key phrases, and exploring how these concepts and phrases fit with Navajo philosophy generally. Thus, the text emerged from dialogue between anthropologists and native experts in Navajo culture, who were seeking coherence and consistency in a variable data set. However, it may still be an accurate portrayal of traditional beliefs. Most subjects who discussed the traditional beliefs were elderly, spoke Navajo only, and lived in the most rural research area. Their beliefs are consistent with major tenets of Navajo philosophy and with the older anthropologic literature on breastfeeding beliefs. Finally, as shown in the survey, many younger Navajo still believe the uniquely Navajo notions. These facts suggest that cultural conservatism is at work: traditional Navajo hold to traditional beliefs that are becoming less prevalent with the passage of time. The methods used to elicit information clearly influenced the resulting portraits. Unstructured, open-ended interviews suggested that, while there was a core set of Navajo beliefs, traditional notions that overlapped with Anglo ones were quite common. Responses to the open-ended survey questions suggested, similarly, that a very small proportion of postpartum women held these traditional beliefs, with many more accepting the beliefs that overlapped with Anglo beliefs. However, when a checklist was used, about half the respondents agreed with two statements reflecting distinctive Navajo beliefs and almost all agreed with statements common to both Navajo and Anglo traditions. Undoubtedly, more of those participating in the ethno- 792 american ethnologist</page><page sequence="13">graphic interviews would have agreed with the distinctively Navajo statements if we had specifically asked their opinions as we did with survey respondents. Why did the different methods produce different responses? Volunteered responses may have identified the most salient beliefs or may simply have reflected what was on the respondents' minds at the time. While the respondents may have had opinions on a multitude of statements about breastfeeding, they volunteered only a few beliefs. Volunteering a large number of responses may seem socially inappropriate in a structured interview, where each question follows immediately upon the preceding one. In an ethnographic interview, by contrast, discussion follows the respondent's thought processes, at his or her pace, permitting the respondent to expand upon a topic at will. A checklist may be useful in prompting the respondent to remember beliefs, which seems to have been the case here, where there is actually a high level of agreement with core cultural values. It may also elicit false positive responses however, because answering yes is frequently considered better than answering no (Baylor 1991). These findings raise important questions regarding diversity and change in cultural beliefs. Does the variability in postpartum women's beliefs reflect a departure from traditional thinking, which would have been more cohesive in the past, when all women breastfed? Breastfeeding beliefs have almost certainly changed as Navajo society has been exposed to the larger, Anglo society and to the recommendations of health-care providers, who until the 1970s advocated the use of formula. Further, social relations, which are often mirrored in beliefs, have also changed: older Navajo women interviewed in the 1970s could not imagine being a woman without being a mother (Wright 1982), but women's other roles, as wage earners and wives in smaller households, receive greater emphasis today. The fact that it was elderly Navajo living in a remote area of the reservation who volunteered traditional elements of the cultural text suggests that those elements may have been more widespread in the past, before Anglo influences were so pervasive. The fact that younger postpartum women and those who considered themselves "modern" were less likely to hold such beliefs also suggests that breastfeeding beliefs have changed.8 However, proving that change has occurred would require that interviews be conducted at different points in time. Clearly, although a society may be described as subscribing to a particular set of beliefs, not all individuals will know or espouse these beliefs. In describing two idealized models of Thai breastfeeding beliefs, Van Esterik asserts that the models are used by members of the culture as reference points for interpreting... infant feeding behavior and the behavior of those around them. These models frame activities and help women make sense out of the complexities underlying their decisions. Of necessity, they simplify, exaggerate, and stereotype behavior, presenting to themselves and others cliche models which we might refer to as traditional and modern patterns of infant feeding. [1985:1 50] We are less sanguine that the text outlined here is known or used by individual Navajos. The cultural text, with all its coherence and consistency, exists as such in the minds of few individual Navajos (only one respondent mentioned most of the distinctively Navajo notions in her ethnographic interview). Rather than representing a body of shared knowledge, the cultural text is in part a product of the observers' attempt to wrest analytic coherence out of interviews, analysis, and discussions. Unlike the idealized model, most individuals' understandings of a particular domain consist of shreds and patches of traditional thinking, exposure to a variety of other sources such as the Western medical system and Anglo beliefs, and individual experi- ences. We would argue, however, that the text is more than a "serious fiction."9 First, many of the notions espoused by Navajo respondents appear to be unique to their culture, particularly the notion that breastfeeding exemplifies proper behavior. Further, the beliefs of the two groups of respondents-older people and modern mothers-are remarkably consistent. The fact that the individual interviews do not reflect great coherence suggests that our respondents were not cultural interpretations 793</page><page sequence="14">attempting to impress the researchers with the coherence of their thought, as other respondents have been reported to do (Van der Geest 1991). Finally, the text accords with the main tenents of Navajo philosophy, although its accordance may reflect either the internal coherence of Navajo philosophy or the striving for a consistent interpretation on the part of Anglo anthro- pologists and native experts alike. Tedlock has shown that there may be inconsistency "from consultant to consultant, and even with the same consultant from day to day" (1987:1076). Nevertheless, she concludes that while the coherence of a belief system may be "blown up out of proportion in the process of answering anthropologic questions," that does not mean the coherence is entirely an artifact of analysis (1987:1080). In conclusion, we suggestthat a traditional corpus of beliefs about breastfeeding exists among the Navajo, one that is consistent with Navajo philosophy and social order. Thus, although breastfeeding is a universal human adaptation, the Navajo see it in a culturally specific fashion that accords with important Navajo principles such as matrilineality and cooperation. The coherence of the cultural interpretation does not, however, reflect consistency in the beliefs of individuals, which are influenced by individual experience and background. Further, Navajo beliefs about breastfeeding are changing in response to Anglo influences and new feeding practices. Clearly, cultural beliefs about the body and its fluids are dynamic and diverse, and portrayals of such beliefs depend upon the methods used to obtain them. notes Acknowledgments.

The Navajo reservation is located in northeastern Arizona, although parts of it spill into New Mexico and Utah. The tribe is the largest in the United States, in both population and size of reservation. 2. These assertions were denied by some of our ethnographic interviewees and by our Navajo consult- ants. 3. Four Navajo researchers, all of whom speak fluent Navajo, conducted the ethnographic interviews; two of them interviewed women as part of the survey. All four researchers also served as consultants in the creation of the cultural text. 4. Two of us (Frank Morgan and Kenneth Begishe) had previously used these strategies extensively in interviewing and analysis about Navajo cultural traditions and attitudes. Therefore wedid not have to extend the study further into Navajo religion, legends, teachings, and traditional means of living, as a great deal of material was already available in a compatible form. 5. Our consultants, however, rejected the notion that menstrual fluid was dangerous because it could be used by witches. 6. One respondent felt it was the rubber of the nipple that posed the biggest threat to a baby's health. The rubber was thought to upset the digestive system, causing the diarrhea frequently seen in bottlefed infants. 7. These statistics are similar to those provided by the IHS for women who had borne children in 1986-87 (Carol Milligan, personal communication 1988), suggesting that our sample is generally representative of childbearing Navajo women. 8. Some respondents interpreted particular traditional beliefs negatively. The expected closeness be- tween a nursing mother and her baby was disparaged by younger women, one of whom said "When you breastfeed you can't get away from the baby." This finding supports Douglas' notion that any complex of symbols "can take on a cultural life of its own and even acquire initiative in developing social institutions" and behavior (1966:14). 9. Kevin Birth has also reminded us that ethnography is only accountable if it is presented as "fact" (1990). references cited Aberle, David F. 1963 Some Sources of Flexibility in Navaho Social Organization.
