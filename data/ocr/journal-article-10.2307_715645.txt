<plain_text><page sequence="1">265 ARTS AND CRAFTS OF ASHANTI1 ABOUT a year ago I was appointed section officer, as we call it, in charge of the following sections at Wembley Exhibition, viz. : I. Manufactures of the Empire. 2. Fine and industrial art. 3. Machinery and electrical appliances. Now I am somewhat inclined to think that some person or persons who really did not believe that our wonderful little Gold Coast contained anything of any interest or value under the above categories had turned these over to myself to see what one who was credited with a facile pen or imagination could make of them. I can certainly forgive anyone who thought as above, for I must confess that a year ago I did not know how much of interest and value a certain delving into these dead or dying arts and crafts of Ashanti would reveal. The machinery and electrical appliances, it is true, had to be eliminated, unless we cared to include the drum language and the amusing experiments of the little black children to construct some super-mechanical wonder out of the guts of old Bee clocks and derelict Ford cars as showing latent electrical and mechanical aspirations. Now at first, as I have said, I really feared that many of these arts and crafts I was setting out to study only survived as words in the vernacular. I think, therefore, that my audience will agree with me before I have concluded this paper that an event which I had at first been inclined to look upon as diverting my attention from these social and religious problems in Ashanti, which had hitherto chiefly interested me, will have turned out all for the best. It is very unlikely that funds on the scale now generously 1 This lecture, which was followed by a series of excellent lantern slides, was delivered at a Meeting of the Society held on June 3rd, I924.

For our present purpose I propose to divide my subject matter into distinct and separate headings: Weaving, Pottery-making, Metal-working and Wood-carving. While it is possible to treat them thus separately, there is one side which is common to all, i.e. the religion in these arts and crafts. This runs like a golden thread through one and all, and shows to us materialistic Westerners how so-called primitive peoples would not dream of divorcing the mystic, the mythical and the spiritual even from their arts and the toil of their crafts. Indeed they could hardly do so, for these very arts and crafts often owed their origin to these religious factors, and their disappearance and decay will, I believe, often be found to coincide with a falling away from the old rituals, the old religion and the old beliefs. WEAVING As to the art of weaving,l I give this craft pride of place, both because its commercial possibilities are perhaps the greatest and because of the exceeding beauty shown in the results obtained. I shall not in this place enter into details of the actual looms and appliances used-the needles, the combs, the sword, the beaters-in, the shuttles, etc., because you will presently see one and all on the screen. Here I shall only draw attention to one or two interesting points. In the first place, I do not think that if any of you were to examine these looms and implements alone, you would ever imagine it possible to produce upon them the very beautiful textiles, some of which I will ask you to examine at the end of my lecture. Again, prior to these investigations it was not, I believe, generally known that in Ashanti at any rate, almost every cloth had not only its own special name, but had a further 1 A large number of slides illustrating the art of weaving were shown upon the screen. 266</page><page sequence="3">SOME DESIGNS USED IN THE MAKING OF ASHANTI STAMPED CLOTHS.

Yet again, the stamped cloths and the process of their manufacture which I shall presently describe were, I believe, equally unknown. I cannot but hope that, from an examination of the designs, names and colouring of Ashanti textiles, Man- chester cotton and silk weavers will find that here the anthro- pologist and the merchant may mutually benefit. The trade would find, I believe, that it would pay to repro- duce stuff which is not only artistically beautiful, but conforms to the details and accuracy sought for by these people, while anthropology would be the trader's debtor because the latter would perpetuate and preserve all that is most beautiful and artistic in a past that is rapidly disappearing. I have mentioned already the religious elements in these crafts. In the case of this particular craft, weaving, the following are very briefly some of the taboos and restrictions in connection with it. In case of seduction of a weaver's wife by another weaver, not only the injured husband but his loom would have to have propitiation made to it. In the case of the loom really puri- fication. The words spoken on such an occasion are somewhat as follows:-" Oh, Creative weaving sticks, whose sacred day is a Friday . . . so and so . . . has committed adultery with my wife, wherefore I beg of you to receive this sheep from my hand and partake of it, that no unclean thing may come upon you, and I also sprinkle water upon you to cleanse you. Do not permit that I fall sick, and as I sit between your sticks let me find content." On no account may an old, about to be discarded loom be used as firewood. No piece of weaving may be commenced or finished on a Friday. WOOD-CARVING Passing to the wood-carver's art,' here we have an art directly owing its technique, if not its very origin, to religion, for it 1 A number of slides illustrating this art were shown. 267</page><page sequence="5">JOURNAL OF THE AFRICAN SOCIETY was to satisfy the demands of the priestly class that figures in anthropomorphic and zoomorphic forms were first carved. Even as a very great admirer of Ashanti religious beliefs in its purest form, the worship of that great Being who is of all the earth the King and Elder (as one of their sayings runs), I did not wish to encourage a revival in the manufacture of suman or talisman or shrines for lower graded spiritual powers. For the Exhibition I therefore sought for some outlet for these clever wood-carvers, and commissioned them to carve for me a group of figures representing an Ashanti King and Queen Mother, with their whole retinue of Court officials. This group is literally the history of Ashanti in wood. From many of these clever carvings, which will be cast upon the screen, I think you will agree that they are wonderfully good. Many of their artistic stools will also be shown. Readers of my book Ashanti will know how religiously significant such a seat becomes in Ashanti. Here again, every stool has its own name, and in many cases designates the status or sex of the owner. Wood-carving, like weaving, is the work of men only. There are specialists in every branch of this craft. Men who only carve stools, others who make umbrella frames for the great State umbrellas; others who carve only drums. A wood-carver will propitiate his tools and pray that they will not slip and cut him and that his skill may not fail. POTTERY Turning to pottery-making, this is an art almost wholly in the hands of women. Specimens of ancient pottery will be shown on the screen, and you will see how highly ornate it was compared with its modern equivalents. There may be one or two reasons for this change. A possible explanation, and one which readers of Ashanti will know I am inclined to favour, is that the Ashanti were not the indigenous inhabitants of the territory which they now occupy. Legend supplies yet another possible explanation. There is a tradition to the effect that women once made figure pots, but that a certain woman who was barren, on consulting a 268</page><page sequence="6">FIRING POTS. MARKETING POTS. [To face page 268.</page><page sequence="7">ARTS AND CRAFTS OF ASHANTI local god was informed that the cause of her being unblessed with children was due to the fact that she made pots in anthro- pomorphic forms. To anyone who knows this people it is quite within reason that such an oracular utterance might well alter the entire fashion in this particular branch of art. Be that as it may, it is only men who to-day make figure pottery. A very plausible explanation as to why it is women who are the chief potters was given me by an old Ashanti. He stated that in ancient times pots were not sold for gold dust (the then local currency), but were bartered only for food. Hence it was not worth the while of the male to learn this art, which was thus left to the women. Tabus of Pottery-making At Taffo, no water may be taken from the Santan River on a Friday and no clay dug on that date. This is possibly a local tabu observed in connection with the samanfo (or spirits) of ancestors. No unbaked pot may be carried away from the village where made. Pots may not be counted before baking. At Taffo, a ceremony is performed annually (or more often if pots keep breaking). Palm wines and a fowl are offered to the stream, the words spoken on the occasion being: " Oh, Santan, which is sometimes black; oh, Santan, which is sometimes red; oh, Santan, which is friend of the orphan and the widow, Santan that rests upon the old woman's jaws, receive this wine and drink, and this fowl and eat." OTHER ARTS The arts which I shall discourse upon, do not, of course, in anv way exhaust them all. Basket-making, gold work, and mat-making are all worthy of closer examination. I hope, however, that I shall have been able to impress upon you that Ashanti craftsmen are artists in their own way of no mean skill. The brain, the hand, the eye guide tools which their European 269</page><page sequence="8">270 JOURNAL OF THE AFRICAN SOCIETY brothers or sisters would. disdain and with which they would declare it was impossible to work. In the future I beg to predict that these Ashanti, or at any rate their descendants, will take their part in producing handi- work which will find its place on our markets because of its originality and its individuality, which is all West Africa and all its own.
