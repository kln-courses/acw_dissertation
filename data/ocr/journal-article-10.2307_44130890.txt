Herbert Bayer, Mosaik (1980), a 15-color screenprint signed and numbered by the artist in an edition of 175. Each print is 17x17 in. (image size) and 24x23 in. (paper size) and was printed on Beau Brilliant paper by Nick Farina in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. Successive prin- tings with transparent inks add kinetic flow to Bayer's rigorous grid design. Price: $300. Co- published by Editions Limited - Joseph Pelkey, Pittsfield, and Patricia Moore; Aspen. Richard Bosman, Man Overboard (1981), an eight-color woodcut signed and numbered by the artist in an edition of 36 with ten artist's proofs. Each print is 26-1/8x16-1/4 in. and was printed on Japanese Etching paper by Chip El- well and Ted Warner in New York. Bosman first carved the image into one block. Once he decided - and learned (this is his first edition) - color separations, he cut four blocks for the edition. The image derives from a book jacket he liked - other ideas might come from comic books - that showed a man falling from an ocean liner. Though Bosman never read the book in question and knows no more than we why the man is falling, "it does look rather like he was pushed." The natty suit and tie are his own additions, and using a "rather primitive medium," he finds further fun in the catastro- phe. Delightful. Price: $300.

Chris Burden, The Atomic Alphabet (1980), a hand-colored etching signed and numbered by the artist in an edition of 25. Each print is 57-1/2x39-1/4 in. and was printed on Arches 88 Roll paper by Hidekatsu Takada assisted by Peter Pettengill at Crown Point Press in Oakland. A print to convince doubters that Burden is serious. At left, running vertically, is an abecedarium, "A for Atomic" to "Z for Zero." Japanese equivalents, lettered by Hide- katsu Takada, run at center, and at right are images drawn and hand-colored by profession- al illustrator Tony Morse. The print's success, however, depends on Burden's choice pairing of antiwar word and image. ' 'D," for example, is "dumb" and illustrated by a dunce; "Y" is "yeller," illustrated by a chicken. Price: $1,200. Published by Crown Point Press, Oakland. Cynthia Carlson, Dott, Fleur-de-Lis , Loop (1981), three hand-painted cast paperworks signed and numbered by the artist in editions of 15. Dott is 21x21x4-1/2 in., Fleur-de-Lis is 36x32x3-1/2 in., and Loop is 26x24x4-1/2 in. All were editioned with 100% cotton pigment- ed pulp by A. Lynn Forgach at Exeter Press in New York. The three paperworks, cast in latex molds, can be seen as a tryptych, the key ele- ment in one a detail in another. The dot fea- tured in Dott appears as ground pattern for Fleur-de-Lis , and so on. Carlson's first multiple is effectively bizarre and bumpy. Price: $1,400 each. Published by 724 Prints, New York. Ron Cooper, Untitled (1981), a photolitho- graph signed and numbered by the artist in an edition of 30. Each print is 5x35-3/4 in. (image size) and 10-1/8x38-1/4 in. (paper size) and was printed on Arches 88 paper at Cirrus Edi- tions in Los Angeles. Cooper photographed a model wearing black hood, gloves, and leg- gings to make that typical art gestalt - a torso. To further remove the figure from a human context, he imposed a small grid over the im- age, which he then presented to a computer at the Image Processing Institute at the Universi- ty of Southern California in Los Angeles. The computer calculated the average light within each block of the grid to make a new negative that Cooper printed for his second segment. He then arbitrarily chose a larger grid, which the computer further "dehanced." Such dehancement reverses the technique used by NASA, for example, to enhance images to clarify space shots. The sequence also reads right to left, another reversal Cooper enjoys, though like many not too familiar with prints, he did not originally plan for it. The mechanical breaking down of one image he finds creates images much like Mondrian, Albers, and Malevich, encapsulating some 50-75 years of art history with one program. Price: publication $225. Published by Cirrus Editions, Los Angeles. Enzo Cucchi, Immagine feroce (1981), a port- folio of five black and white lithographs signed and numbered by the artist in editions of 50 with six artist's proofs each. Each print is 21-1/2x17 in. in vertical and horizontal format and was printed on Fabriano Rosapina paper by Valter and Eleanora Rossi at 2RC in Rome. Individual titles axe Al buio sul mare Adri- atico (Darkness over the Adriatic Sea), Immagine minore Marchigiana (M inor image of the ' ' Marche * ') , Il Santo di Loreto (The Saint of Loreto ), Tutti i pesci devono andare piano (All fish must go slowly ), and Tutte le montagne sono sante (All the mountains are saintly). These are intriguing prints by one of Italy's most intriguing New Imagists/New Wavists/Naive Nouveaus - whatever's your favorite from the newly fashionable terminol- ogy. Each is an energetic rendering keyed to Cucchi' s very personal view of life by the Adri- atic, with repeated printings in black effective- ly accenting some images. Price: portfolio $1,850. Published by Peter Blum Edition, New York. Jim Dine, White Ground, Night Tree (1981), an etching signed and numbered by the artist in an edition of 15. Each print is 44-1/2x34-1/4 in. (plate size) and 45-3/4x35-1/4 in. (paper size) and was printed on Arches Roll paper by Susan Hennesey at Palm Press in Tampa. This is the darkest and, technically, the simplest of several recent Dine renderings of a tree. Others in the series, worked from the same four plates, continually altered, include vari- ous hand-coloring and/or monotype. The Tree in Soot , for example, includes a cognate taken from the monotype done for A Tree , Curvacious and Blue. All in the series seem more than slightly anthropomorphic, but the suggestion of a femcile figure is most mysterious in the dark shades of White Ground, Night Tree. Price: $2,500 each. Published by Pace Editions, New York. Joel Fisher, States (1980), ten unique series of intaglios signed and numbered by the artist with five series for sale. Each print is 26x21 in. and was printed on handmade paper chine collé on Arches Satine at Crown Point Press in Oak- land. The collaged sheets were made by the artist using pulp from old Crown Point prints. The felt blanket used to couch these sheets leaves small hairs. As with his drawings, Fisher selects one such hair in the paper and magni- fies its line on a plate. A second hair is selected from the next sheet that will connect with the first to print the second state in the series, Fisher continuing to choose hairs till he com- pletes his connections. In a season of much paper mush, these are excellent paperworks. For sale are the following. Dry point, five states. Price: $2,250. Hardground II, five states. Price: $2,250. Softground , seven states. Price: $3,150. Softground II, four states. Price: $1,800. Sugarlift 77, four states. Price: $1,800. Published by Crown Point Press, Oakland. Buckminster Fuller, Inventions : Twelve Around One (1980), a portfolio of 13 prints sign- ed and numbered by the artist in an arabie edi- tion of 60 with 20 hors commerce in roman. Each print is 30x40 in. and was produced by Colophon in Cincinnati. Each print has three elements: a sheet of clear polyester Trans Stay printed by American Sérigraphies Co. in Detroit, a duotone screenprint printed on Lenox 100% rag by Hennegan Co. in Cincin- nati, and a blue backing paper of Curtis Weave. The duotone screenprints repeat various photographs from Fuller's files and/or magazines of projects he has submitted to the U.S. Patent Office, beginning with his 4D house in 1928 to nonsymmetrical tension- integrity structures in 1973. Design diagrams have been blown up and placed by a graphic designer to correspond visually with the photographs. Printed legends tell that all but the house were granted patents in two to five years. A suitably handsome and "comprehen- sivist" record of Fuller's synergetic inven- tiveness. Price: portfolio $9,000. Published by Carl Solway Gallery, Cincinnati. Available in New York at Getler/Pall. Tina Girouard, Hidden Meanings (1980), a series of 15 unique screenprints with embossing signed by the artist. Each print is 31x53 in. and was printed on T. H. Saunders paper by Larry B. Wright with Donald Sheridan and Doug Evans in New York. Each in the series is a dou- 48</page><page sequence="3">ble panel with four screens and two embossings chosen from a Girouard lexicon of six screens and four embossings. The title of each print tells the six elements used. For example, Tina, Fiery Gift, Moon Mother - Hui, Monument, Work combines Tina in Braille (c. 1860), Fiery Gift and Moon Mother in Ojibwa (to 1500), Hut à la Girouard (1980), Monument in Cuneiform (2500 B.C.), etc. Overprinting with transpar- ent inks allows each sign to cover but not hide others in a panel, making for a dramatic con- frontation of centuries. Less successful are the single-panel prints, Stacked Signs, an edition of 25. Price: double-panel $1,200; single-panel $750. Published by Holly Solomon Editions, New York. Stephen Hartman, Rosa's Red (1981), a screenprint with collage signed and numbered by the artist in an edition of 20. Each print is 39x24-1/2 in. and was printed on Sekishu paper by Angus Davis in Santa Fe. Two panels of di- agonal bands in many colors seem the same, but deviants in pattern abound. Adding fur- ther painterly intrigue is an oversheet of thin Sekishu that is unevenly glued. Price: $350. Published by Hard Pressed Ink, Minneapolis. Available in Minneapolis at Glen Hanson Gallery. Charles Hinman, Untitled (1981), a series of c. 50 unique paperworks signed by the artist. Each piece is 22x28x2 in. and was made with pigmented pulp by the artist working with Steve Kasher at Bummy Huss Paper in New York. Each is a three-dimensional construction made with a changing cast of styrofoam molds and two to four colors of pulp, a fluid medium with more texture than Hinman 's usual con- structions of canvas. His aim is, however, un- changed: to confound real with illusory space through overlapping planes and juxtaposing color. Hinman finds himself excited by the constructivist possibilities of paperwork: "I'm just getting started." Price: $2,500 each. Pub- lished by the artist, New York. Christopher James, Union Boat Club/ Boston (1980), a toned black and white photograph with hand-coloring signed and numbered by the artist in an edition of 25. Each print is 5-1/2x9 in. and was printed by the artist in Boston. James photographs with an old Brooks-Plaubel camera. He then tones his prints with sepia and/or selinium and washes them. While still wet, they are selectively painted with silver, re washed and dried, and mounted before he adds accents with buffed oil pencil and paints with tinted and transparent enamels and lacquers. This fairly elaborate process begins as it should - with an excellent eye for the interesting angle, the unusual detail, which James consistendy shows small. Even a squash court turns precious, elegant. Seductive. Price: $325. Published by the artist, Boston. Available in New York at Witkin Gallery. Stevan Jennis, Block House (1981), a hard- and soft-ground etching with hand-coloring signed and numbered by the artist in an edi- tion of 60 with ten artist's proofs. Each print is 39x29-1/4 in. and was printed on American Etching paper by Alan Koslin at Xpress in New York. Centered on a sheet ruled with lines and holes à la school notebook is a house within a black square. Other images - a carpenter, flower, ladder, etc. - sprinkle the margins along with various markings. No art-historical ponderings with this one. Bright and pleasant. Price: $600. Copublished by Barbara Toll Fine Art and Diane Villani Editions, New York. Stephanie Brody Lederman, Utter Madness (1981), a rubber-stamp print with hand-letter- ing and painting signed and numbered by the artist in an edition with two states of 65 each. Each print is 11x7 in. and was printed on Bris- tol Board by the artist in New York. The stamp, which shows a lady's face with "an Ivory Soap feeling,' ' is fairly new to the Leder- man collection. Enhancing its Mary Martin/ South Pacific charm are the words "those spring winds" lettered by hand and a painted swatch like floral wallpaper. The swatch is a different pattern in each state. Price: $100. Published by the artist, Great Neck. Available in New York at Kathryn Markel Fine Arts. Marisol, Sun (1981), a hand- painted cast paperwork signed and numbered by the artist in an edition of 30. Each paperwork is 19x 22-1/2x5-1/8 in. and was made at Atelier Royce in New York. A bronze casting of Marisol 's face radiating 22 fingers was used as a positive mold to cast paper pulp, which was then painted with graphite and lacquer and sprayed. Old Marisol, newly effective. Price: $2,000. Published by Atelier Royce, New York. Tom Nakashima, Kimono /, Kimono II (1981), two lithographs signed and numbered by the artist in editions of 25 with eight artist's proofs each. Kimono I is 23x22-5/8 in. and was printed in six colors on British Barcham Green Regent paper; Kimono II is 22-l/.4x22-3/4 in. and was printed in four colors on Arches Cover buff paper, all at Plucked Chicken Press in Chicago. Like his recent paintings, these prints are a vertical ordering of geometric patterns - in this case, concentric circles, arcs, and triangles. Though most of these patterns are based on photographic enlargements of fabric designs, Nakashima follows his own prefer- ence when it comes to color. The two kimonos, one dark, one light, printed with the same four plates, with some alterations, are best as a dip- tych. Price: $250 each. Published by Balkin Fine Arts, Chicago. Philip Pearlstein, Two Nudes with Federal Sofa (1981), an aquatint with drypoint, engrav- ing, and line etching signed and numbered by the artist in an edition of 41 with seven artist's proofs. Each print is 31x41 in. (plate size) and 28-3/4x40-5/16 in. (paper size) and was print- ed on Rives BFK paper by Orlando Condeso at Condeso &amp; Brokopp in New York. Pearl- stein in especially fine form, deftly balancing two nudes, a sofa covered with floral swirls, and a rug patterned in geometries, all on a planked floor. This is the first time the artist has combined two« such strong patterns in print. Price: $2,400. Published by 724 Prints, New York. James Reineking, Vier Aquatinten (1980), a portfolio of four black and white aquatints signed and numbered by the artist in an edi- James Reineking, II and IV from Vier Aquatinten, aquatint (17x22 in. ea.), 1980.

Each print is 17x22 in. and was printed on Hahnemühl Bütten 300-gr. paper at Druckwerk München in Munich. Each of the four prints was printed from a square metal plate cut into three shapes that create open and closed structures related to the artist's massive steel sculptures. Interesting. Price: portfolio $800. Published by Druckwerk München, Munich. Available in Cologne at Galerie de Gestio. George Schneemann, Upside Down Flannel Shirt (1980), a two-color lithograph signed and numbered by the artist in an edition of 45 with ten artist's proofs. Each print is 24-1/2x18-1/2 in. and was printed on Arches paper by Maurice Sanchez in New York. Once again Schneeman finds cheer in a checked flannel shirt - this time the checks blue and black, the shirt upside down. Price: $350. Published by Holly Solomon Editions, New York. Joel Shapiro, Untitled (1980), a series of ten screenprints signed and numbered by the artist in editions ranging from 11 to 30. Each print is 29x21-1/2 in. in vertical or horizontal format and was printed on Japanese handmade paper by Hiroshi of Simca Print Artists in Tokyo. All but one in the series are black and white, ec- centric shapes that grow according to their own interior logic. Most interesting are two in which Shapiro has added curves to ovoids to complicate shape and create strangely negative space, as well as one in which a black circular shape sprouts two more in red. Each shape seems alive, implying three-dimensional movement and change. Price: editions under 25 $400; editions over 25 $350. Published by Simca Print Artists, New York. Available in New York at Paula Cooper Gallery. Phil Sims, Untitled (1979), a series of etch- ings signed and numbered by the artist in edi- tions ranging from three to ten. Plate and paper size vary; all were printed by Liz Peak at Connecticut College, New London. Close to such fundamental painters as Ryman and Hafif, Sims proves a fundamentalist can trans- late the message to print, creating a richly sub- tle surface, in color or in black and white. Price: $250 each. Published by the artist, New York. Frank Stella, Sinjerli Variations (Squared with Colored Grounds) (1981), six lithographs printed on a handfed offset press and signed and num- bered by the artist in varying editions with ten artist's proofs each. I is 39 colors in an edition of 38; la is 40 colors in an edition of 61 ; II is 45 colors in an edition of 50; IIa is 45 colors in an edition of 29; III is 52 colors in an edition of 32; IV is 65 colors in an edition of 44. In 1977, on completing the six Sinjerli Variations (PCN, Vol. VIII, p. 116), Stella asked that extensive over- printings be saved as he might like to do a sec- ond series. The plates were canceled but no an- nouncement was made of his intentions. For this new series the overprintings were torn to 32x32 in. so that each protractor image is cen- tered and a new plate drawn for each variation, adding a brightly colored ground. These grounds were printed by John Hutcheson and James Welty at Petersburg Studios in New York. Stella is not an artist who has flooded the print market, but many dealers would have preferred that an announcement of his inten- tions, no matter how uncertain, had been made on publication of the first series. Price: publication $3,750 each. Published by Peters- burg Press, London. William Weege, Untitled (1981), a series of unique paper constructions on string signed by the artist. Sizes vary but many are c. 30x40 in. ; all were done by the artist at Jones Road Print Shop &amp; Stable in Barneveld, Wisconsin. Each is a paper construction cast on woven string, embossed, and colored with liquitex paint and batik dyes, often in relief, Weege using various Weege combinations of zinc plates, wood- blocks, teletype tapes, and vinyl records to print. He compares the completed works to an- tique artifacts. Price: $800-$ 1,000 each. Pub- lished by Jones Road Print Shop &amp; Stable, Barneveld. Available in New York at Pace. Robert Zakanitch, How I Love Ya, How I Love Ya (1981), a 21-color lithograph with screenprint and pochoir signed and numbered by the artist in an edition of 43. Each print is 42x120 in. and was printed on Rives BFK paper at Tyler Graphics in Bedford Village, New York. This is a dramatic and beautiful twin image of two swans atop flowers against a flowered ground, a very sure Zakanitch freely stretching for maximum rhythm and jazz. Other recent works of interest include a series of unique paperworks ranging in size from 34x37 in. to 85-1/2x103 in. and recently shown at Robert Miller Gallery in New York. Price: $3,000.
