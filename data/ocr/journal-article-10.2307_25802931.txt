<plain_text><page sequence="1">OFER LIVNE-KAFRI FAD AIL BAYT AL-MAQDIS (THE MERITS OF JERUSALEM') TWO ADDITIONAL NOTES The development of the idea of the sanctity of Jerusalem in early Islam is mainly reflected in Muslim traditions belonging to the literary genre of Fada'il Bayt al-Maqdis (The Praises of Jerusalem'), which is a branch of the hadith literature.1 Many publications of mine are devoted to this field.2 In this article I address some other matters, not necessarily related at first sight, but together adding still more diversity to the complex picture. 1 On this literary genre see, e.g., I.

Ibrahim al-Maqdisi, an Early Composer of the Literature on the Praises of Jerusalem (Fadd'il Bayt al Maqdis) Compositions of Fadd'il Bayt al-Maqdis genre are known only from the first half of the eleventh century A.D. (fifth century of the hijra), but traditions concerning Jerusalem were already in circulation during the seventh and eighth centuries A.D. (first two centuries of the hijra)} The most important composer of the genre was Abu al-Ma'all al-Musharraf b. al-Murajja b. Ibrahim al MaqdisI, whose book Kitab Fadd'il Bayt al-Maqdis wa-al-Khalil wa-Fada'il al Sham (The Praises of Jerusalem, Hebron and Syria'; the scientific edition was prepared by me) was written in the first half of the eleventh century A.D. It was an important source for many of my publications (cf. note 2). This is an extremely important composition, containing much of information; it preserves older materials (especially from the seventh and the eighth centuries A.D.); the guide to the pilgrims included in it is the first of its kind; it seems to have influenced the shaping of similar later compositions. Surprisingly, almost nothing on Ibn al-Murajja is found in the Arabic biographical literature. Nevertheless, it is possible to extract some biographical data from his own work, for example, a list of authorities directly quoted by him or the places where he went from Jerusalem for the purpose of talab al-'ilm ('the pursuit of knowledge'). Also, most of the scholars quoted directly by Ibn al-Murajja are not mentioned in the biographical literature and only scant information is available on them. We know nothing about Ibn al-Murajja's family, his social and religious environment, the way in which his cultural world was shaped, or his students; nor do we know if he wrote other compositions.4 I. 2. The Fadd'il Bayt al-Maqdis literature is in fact a part of the hadith, the Muslim tradition.5 Ibn al-Murajja as is evident from his book, was an erudite scholar of hadith, who tried to be as accurate as possible in the quotation of the traditions, as regards content (matn) and chain of transmitters (isnad), hardly ever adding his own interpretation. The same may be said of Abu Muhammad al-Wasitl, the first author of Fadd'il Bayt al-Maqdis, who composed his book in the beginning of the eleventh century.6 The immediate impression is that the Jerusalem. 3 Cf. sources in note 1, above and al-Wasiti, Abu Bakr Muhammad b.

Is this impression correct? Was Ibn al-Murajja but an erudite scholar in the preservation of old traditions, but lacking any other special characteristics of intellectual interest? Fortunately, a rare piece of evidence is to be found in Ibn al-Murajja's own book that elucidates an unknown aspect of his personality: he was a learned man of broad knowledge, who was also well trained in the field of intellectual debates. The relevant chapter is almost a small monograph,8 and it is related to a tradition mentioned elsewhere in his book.9 This tradition reflects ambivalent attitudes of Muslim scholars to the Rock of Jerusalem (al-Sakhra),10 as well as conceptions concerning the importance of the Rock and Jerusalem in cosmology and eschatology.11 It is told there that 'Ubada b. al-Samit and Rafi' b. Khudayj, both among the Sahaba (the Companions of the Prophet Muhammad) and enjoying high Islamic prestige,12 were asked: "Have you perceived what the existence in the ninth century. 7 Cf. al-Sulami, Kitdb Addb al-Suhba, ed.

Is it true that we have to follow, or is it something originating from the book13 [of Jews or Christians],14 so that we shoud leave it? Both of them said: Glory be to God! Who doubts it? When God, may He be exalted, ascended from it (istawd)15 to Heaven, He said to the Rock of Jerusalem: This is my Place (maqdm), and the place of my Throne on the Day of Resurrection (yawm al-qiyama), and of the assembly of my servants, and this is the place of my Paradise at its right side, and my Hell at its left side, and I shall set my scales in front of it; I am God, the Judge of Judgement-Day (dayydn yawm al-din). After that He ascended to Heaven".16 'Ubada b. al-Samit appears in another such discussion. He and another Companion of the Prophet, 'Abd Allah b. Mas'ud,17 disagreed on a certain matter, and 'Ubada b. al-Samit said [in a vow]: "No, In the name of Him, who had the Rock of Jerusalem a place (maqdm) for himself for forty years, such and such did not happen, and 'Abd Allah b. Mas'ud held what he said as trustworthy...".18 Ibn al-Murajja connects that vow (which emphasizes the importance attached to the Rock) to the tradition of a pre-creation of the Ka'ba, then Jerusalem after forty years and thinks it possibble that the matter is connected with earlier revelations (most probably of Jews or Christians).19 He mentions that elsewhere in his book he gives a more complete explanation of Damascus 1329-1349, vol. 7, p. 206; Mujir al-Din al-Hanbali, Kitab al-Uns al-Jalll bi Tdrikh al-Quds wa-l-Khalll, Cairo 1283, vol. 1, p. 231;'al-Dhahabi (this note), vol. 2, p. 1; al-Bukhari (this note), vol. 6, p. 93; Muhammad b.

Moreover, he appears well trained in the art of argumentation of the kaldm (Muslim theology) and to possess the the skill of writing well constructed reasoning tract. The problem here lies in the possibility of anthropomorphism (tajslm), where God appears as having limbs and standing on his feet on the Rock like a human being. Mu'tazill theologians were very much against such views, contrary to certain orthodox circles 22 Idioms such as "He was standing upon it" (qdma 'alayha) or "In the name of Him, who had the Rock of Jerusalem a place (maqdm) to himself for forty years", and the like, are said by the author to have been taken by the Sahaba from "the Books of God sent down upon the Sons of Israel (kutub Allah al-munazzala 'aid Ban! Israll)', it was but a way of expression and it means: "Allah undertook it (qdma bi-) to respect it... before he sent to it his prophets that they might respect it..." The significance of the expression "and it was a standing place (maqdm) for him" is that "he respected it before [the anticipated] resurrection". The author gives similar usages in Arabic based on Koranic verses and their interpretation, where qdma 'aid appears as a metaphor and is not to be understood literally. He claims that here it is in accord with the Hebrew, and he presents examples of what he sees as mistakes in the interpretation of idioms. He attacks the Christians, who believe that Jesus is the son of God on the grounds of New Testament verses in which Jesus calls God "my father", while in other verses others refer to God as 'father* metaphorically (e.g., "But when thou givest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth... and thy Father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly" (Matth. 6:3-4) or "Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name" (ibid., 6:9; see also verses 17-18). In a similar manner he cites Old Testament passages regarding Solomon and Jacob (probably 2 Samuel, 7:13; 1 Chronicles, 22:9-10; Exodus 4:22) in which, according to him, the relationship of son and father (God) is a metaphor for the love and compassion of a father for his son. In the same way, he argues, the Arabs used to call the earth metaphorically 'our mother' because it was the source of their survival, the origin of creation to which they will return. As an example he quotes a verse of the jahili poet Umayya b. Abl al-Salt. He notes that although many examples are present in the hadith of what seems to be anthropomorphism, this is no more than idiomatic expression. One important example is, "And God blessed 20 Cf.itoU,p. 114, no. 132. 21 Ibid., pp. 150-153, no. 192. 22 See D. Gimaret, 'Mu'tazila', ?/2 vol. 7,1993, pp. 787-789. 65</page><page sequence="6">the seventh day and made it holy because on it he rested from all the work of creating that he had done" (Genesis, 2:3). Ibn al-Murajja argues that istiraha Crest') should not be taken literally; here it means 'to finish', 'to be free from work'.23 Even if the author does not present an original tract and argumentations here, this kind of knowledge still provides a different perspective on his major work of fadd'il bayt al-maqdis. II. Prayers in a Jerusalem Guide for Muslim Pilgrims24 An important novelty by Abu al-Ma'all al-Musharraf b. al-Murajja is his detailed guide for pilgrims in Jerusalem, not known from previous Arabic works 25 The different sites mentioned in the guide, al-Aqsa Mosque, the Dome of the Rock, and minor sites, were treated in great detail by A. Elad 26 The part of Ibn al-Murajja's book dedicated to the Praises of Hebron also contains a guide for Muslim pilgrims in that town.27 Religious visits to the holy sites in Jerusalem were a very old custom, at least from the Umayyad period. One narrative might reflect a kind of an early tour, though we do not know its exact nature.28 This is implied more specifically in the middle of the tenth century in a dream of a certain person in Jerusalem in which he visited specific holy sites in Jerusalem.29 Parts of Ibn al-Murajja's guide to the pilgrims are quoted in 23 Cf. H. Lazarus-Yafeh, Intertwined Worlds, Medieval Islam and Bible Criticism, Princeton 1992, p. 30 speaks of 'the Islamic rejection of the anthropomorphic idea that God rested on the seventh day, which resulted in the total rejection of a weekly day of rest...'. 24 In its original (not identical) form this chapter was published in Cathedra, 66 (1992), pp. 57-60 (in Hebrew). 25 Ibn al-Murajja (above, note 2), pp. 64-81, nos. 52-69. Cf. A. Elad, Medieval Jerusalem (above, note 1), pp. 68 ff.; Hasson, 'Muslim View of Jerusalem' (above, note 1), p. 371. In fact traditions in praise of Jerusalem are scattered throughout the various genres of the Arabic literature such as commentaries to the Quran, different hadlth collections, chronicles, geographical compositions, and 'Merits of Towns', the adab, special monographs, etc. (cf., e.g., Hasson's introduction to al-Wasiti's work [above, note 3], pp. 21-23). 26 Elad, Medieval Jerusalem (above, note 1), the whole work. 27 Ibn al-Murajja (above, note 2), pp. 340-343, nos. 565-569. The part of the composition dedicated to Hebron is the oldest we know. See Hasson, 'Muslim View of Jerusalem' (above, note 1), p. 369, n. 105; Livne-Kafri, 'Early Arabic Literary Works' (above, note 2), p. 22, n. 5. 28 Al-Wasiti (above, note 3), p. 102, no. 165. This tradition refers to walking around the sites, including praying there, which is the basic format of the later guides. Cf. citation of the same tradition in Hasson's introduction to al-Wasiti (above, note 3), p. 21; A. Elad, 'The History and Topography of Jerusalem during the Early Islamic period: The Historical Value of Fada'il al-Quds Literature: A Reconsideration', Jerusalem Studies in Arabic and Islam, 14 (1991), p. 55. 29 Which might hint at the possibility of a more formal guide for Muslims in Jerusalem already in the tenth century (Ibn al-Murajja [above, note 2], pp. 268-269, no. 407; this is also a desire for the legitimation for these sites). I reached similar conclusions concerning this dream (see O. Livne-Kafri, The Sanctity of Jerusalem in Islam, Ph.D. 66</page><page sequence="7">later tracts in praise of Jerusalem.30 In this article I restrict myself to certain aspects only, relating to the prayers that the guide recommends be offered at the different sites. These prayers belong to the category of du'a\ a prayer of invocation and supplication.31 The main questions are: Were these prayers composed in the eleventh century or are they earlier, and can they be found in other literary genres? What is the role of the author, Ibn al-Murajja, in the creation of the prayers? To what extent do they express a direct connection to Jerusalem and its specific holy sites? Is there any influence of Jewish and Christian versions of prayers in Jerusalem on the wording of the Muslim prayers?32 This is connected to the entire question of the reflection of Jewish and Christian materials in the Muslim tradition and the way in which they became a part of the Muslim system of values.33 Traditions concerning Jerusalem reflect that process as well.34 In quoting the prayers, Ibn al-Murajja relies on chains of transmitters, but the impression is that he was the one who arranged them in the guide. At least in one place he mentions a certain biblical source (al-zabur [Psalms]) dissertation, The Hebrew University, 1985, p. 302 [in Hebrew]) as did Elad, Medieval Jerusalem (above, note 1), p. 70. The person who had the dream, Abu Muhammad, was considered one of the abddl, the substitute-saints, a concept connected with the sanctification of Jerusalem and Syria in early Islam. Cf. O. Livne-Kafri, 'Early Muslim Ascetics' (above, note 2), pp. 122-124. In the tenth century this term referred most probably to a Sufi. 30 For specific references to these compositions see our notes below.

Ashtor, 'An Arabic Book concerning the Praises of Jerusalem', Tar biz, 30 (1961), pp. 209-214 (in Hebrew). 31 See L. Gardet, 'Du'a", El2, vol. 2 (1965), pp. 617-618.

See Y. Braslavi, 'A Jerusalem Guide from the Cairo Geniza', Eretz Israel, 1 (1964), pp. 69-80 (in Hebrew), in which are mentioned some sites reminiscent of sites mentioned in the Muslim guide such as the Gate of Mercy and the Mount of Olives; E.

Livne-Kafri, 'Christian Attitudes Reflected in the Muslim Literature in Praise of Jerusalem', (submitted for publication). 67</page><page sequence="8">quoted by him.35 Only rarely is a prayer listed connected directly to its specific site. One such prayer is the "prayer that Jesus offered when Allah made him ascend to heaven" and it should be said on the Mount of Olives.36 This tradition has an anti-Christian tendency, probably to emphasize that following a Christian custom, in no way means, an affirmation of Christian beliefs.37 An old text of that tradition is found in Vyun al-akhbdr of Ibn Qutayba, the famous adab writer (d. 889).38 In two other places the guide counsels the pilgrim to read Qur'anic chapters having to do with the sites. Following ancient traditions, the guide advises the visitor to Mihrab Dawud to read Sura S, just as the caliph 'Umar b. al-Khattab did when he visited Jerusalem,39 and it recommends the visitor to Mihrab Maryam (Mary) to read Sura Maryam there.40 These seem to be the only prayers connected directly to the holy sites of Jerusalem. Systematic examination of the other prayers shows that they are generally taken from the great treasure of the hadith, which was collected centuries before. They appear in the so-called 'canonical collections' from the ninth century and in the adab literature 41 They were seemingly arranged by Ibn al Murajja. Ibn al-Firkah (d. 1329), referring to Ibn al-Murajja's sayings about the prayers in the Rock (al-sakhra\ justly states that these traditions have nothing special to do with this site, and that they could be recited elsewhere as well.42 As for origins, the prayer that one should say at the entrance to the al Aqsa Mosque proves in fact to be an ancient one, connected with entering a mosque, and it is attributed to the Prophet Muhammad.43 Another prayer that one is recommended to offer, at the entrance to the Dome of the Rock, is also very old 44 The source of an additional prayer connected to the Dome of the 35 Ibn al-Murajja (above, note 2), p. 81, end of tradition no. 69 (I did not identify it in the Bible); cf. note 54. 36 Ibid., p. 80, no. 69, line 5. 37 Ibid., p. 81, line 7 (against the Divine character of Jesus). 38 Ibn Qutayba, Vyun al-Akhbdr, Cairo 1963, vol. 2, pp. 281-282.

Any possible connection is to be found in earlier periods, and not in relation to Jewish or Christian customs in Jerusalem. In conclusion, most of the prayers mentioned in Ibn al-Murajja's guide to the pilgrims from the eleventh century A.D. are not related especially to Jerusalem, nor do they express direct connections to Muslim religious sites in Jerusalem. Most of these prayers were taken from collections assembled long before. We have no conclusive proofs of Jewish or Christian influence on the creation of the prayers, but this is not improbable, not as an imitation of Jewish or Christian cults in Jerusalem but as part of processes of absorption and crystallization in the first centuries of the Muslim era. It is difficult to know how far Muslim pilgrims used this guide and the prayers included in it. In this part of the article we again see the author, Ibn al-Murajja, as a scholar strictly of hadith who preferred to rely on long chains of transmitters even for materials found in well known compositions. Still, he uses his knowledge to create or crystallize an itinerary for the Muslim pilgrims in Jerusalem, including specific prayers to be recited in the different sites. I hope that these additional notes to my earlier studies on Jerusalem will contribute to a better understanding of the conception of sanctity attached to that city in Islam, bridging another gap in that complex and diversified picture. UNIVERSITY OF HAIFA SUMMARY These two notes are additional to the many publications of 0. Livne-Kafri on the sanctity of Jerusalem in early Islam. They bring a unique piece of information on the cultural world of the most important composer of the "Praises of Jerusalem", the eleventh century Ibn al-Murajja, and a discussion on the origins of the prayers included in his guide for pilgrims in Jerusalem. A scientific edition of the book was published by the author in 1995. 54 Ibn al-Murajja (above, note 2), p. 81 bottom, end of tradition no. 69. 70</page></plain_text>
