<plain_text><page sequence="1">Basketry in the Aghem-Fungom Area of the Cameroon Grassfields CHRISTRAUD GEARY Baskets from the Cameroon Grassfieldst can be found in many collections in European and American museums, and some better-known types are occasionally illustrated in books and catalogues. Baskets are still being made in the region, although a large proportion is intended for sale to tourists. The casual visitor to Bamenda, the capital of the North West Pro- vince in which much of the Grassfields lies, may admire the large selection of baskets in Prescraft, the handicraft store of the Presbyterian Church. There are brightly colored ones from Bafut, small, tightly coiled basketry dishes from Kom, and the so-called wedding baskets from Wum (Fig. 4), a town some 80 kilometers north of Bamenda. Examples of this popular type (alas, without the high foot) even made their way to a Scan- dinavian design store in Cambridge, Massachusetts, when bas- ketry became fashionable in interior decorating in the United States. In villages all over the Grassfields, travelers can still see baskets being used by women in everyday activities, although lately many are being replaced by large enamel dishes and plastic containers. I found a seemingly endless variety of bas- '4Ala Rivr tiSSNGMUDAB, ES 8MUNKENKOHI ABAR iso KUNG FANG ZUA .F UN'GOM to o &amp; take BU **Lakmom kets during my years of research in the region. During my first visit in 1969, I noticed that they differed from area to area, and that one way of telling whether I was still in Bafut, for example, or had already crossed into Befang, a chiefdom in the Menchum valley, was by looking at the baskets the women carried to the fields. In Bafut, oblong baskets tower on their heads, while in Befang, heavy loads of wood, maize, or yam are lugged in sturdy back baskets supported by a strap across the forehead. Baskets, then, are a means of distinction in the politically complex Grassfields. Although it would be erroneous to ascribe a different type to each chiefdom (neighboring polities may share basketry forms), styles and carrying modes clearly de- lineate regions and indicate that the polities in these regions have interacted throughout their history One factor contribut- ing to the regional distribution of styles is of course the net- works of trade, although it should be pointed out that basketry products were traded on a much smaller scale than pottery or works in wood, partly because women traditionally produced these items for their own everyday domestic needs. One might then assume that women's geographical movements due to intermarriage also favored the regional distribution of basketry styles. Traditionally, marriage relationships between members of different political units were prescribed and can be easily deduced through interviews and statistical analysis (Geary 1986:32, fn. 23). It would certainly be interesting to map bas- ketry styles and explore their relationship to marriage patterns and forms of trade, but unfortunately we do not yet have the basic data to embark on such a study. For that matter, baskets as an art form2- in Africa in general as well as the Grassfields in particular - have not drawn the attention they deserve.3 Typically most baskets are part of the female domestic sphere and are made by women. Men may make some items for their own exclusive use or for trade, but rarely do both sexes work together on the same product. It seems that baskets, being a predominantly female art form, are considered less interesting than men's more spectacular woodcarvings or metalwork. Their study, however, may open avenues to the understanding of societal concepts, such as the articulation of the relationship between men and women, and gender-specific ritual expression. It is the aim of this paper to explore some of these aspects in one area of the Grassfields. In the few recent works that have considered Grassfields basketry, the information has been superficial and flawed by two problems that recur constantly in art historical writings on this region. One is misinformation because of a lack of fieldwork in other than a few areas; the other is the tendency to generalize whatever has been found in those specific areas. Time and time again we are faced with catchwords such as kingship, palace, secret societies, retainers, and hierarchy, 42</page><page sequence="2">. . . , . . . . . . . . . .. - ..

Of course there are characteristics common to all regions of the Grassfields that allow us to delineate it as a distinct cultural and art-producing entity in the first place, but there is also a diversity, especially in details, that has not been taken into account.4 In this paper I will avoid the generalizing approach in favor of a detailed analysis of one art form in a particular region of the Grassfields, the Aghem-Fungom area.5 In art historical writ- ing it is often referred to as "Bafum," an ethnonym used by the Germans (e.g., Ankermann 1910:291, Detzner 1923: ch. 14). This term, very likely coined by the Hausa, not only is unknown to the area's present inhabitants but also has been ill defined and wrongly applied by scholars.6 After outlining the scant litera- ture on Grassfields baskets, I will describe the production, use, and meaning of different basketry forms made by women and men in the Aghem-Fungom area. Some historical reconstruc- tion is involved, as some forms of basketry are no longer made or used.7 Most chiefdoms in the Aghem-Fungom area display similar socio-political characteristics. One of them is the absence of the strong chiefship found elsewhere in the Grassfields. Indeed, before colonial intervention, generally the position of a chief in this region (where he is known as batum8) could be characterized at best as that of primus inter pares who fulfilled ritual tasks for the chiefdom. The majority of these chiefs acquired political power only as a result of German and British colonial interfer- ence. Besides the chief, the elders are the main protagonists in village politics. These men also form the membership of secret societies such as Kweifo, which was introduced to most village chiefdoms shortly before the turn of the century It has never exerted the power ascribed to societies of the same name in other areas of the Grassfields. In Weh, Kweifo is owned not by the chief but by the heads of the five wards, who independently acquired the rights to and the paraphernalia of Kweifo from neighboring villages (Geary 1976:98 ff.). Access to prestigious materials like beads and to high-status objects like finely carved stools was never restricted to chiefs or a "palace elite." Heads of large compounds (ngarre wuu in Weh language, big men in Pid- gin) who had acquired wealth could also display prestige mate- rials and purchase or commission objects of high status. 43</page><page sequence="3">A 2.

PHOTOGRAPH BY WILHELM SCHNEIDER, CA. 1934. Just as there is some confusion in art historical writing about the ethnonyms and political structure of this peripheral area of the Grassfields, so is there also misinformation, especially recently, on its baskets. The first to mention baskets from the Aghem-Fungom area was Ber- nhard Ankermann (1910), who spent a year and a half in the Bamenda district (November 1907-April 1909). He traveled extensively, briefly visiting the northern periphery of Kom and the adjacent Fun- gom area, spending some time in Bafu- men (also called Mmen), Nyos, Ise, and then continuing on to Bum. Unfortu- nately, his notes on this trip are rather sketchy (Baumann &amp; Vajda 1959:293-94). His appreciation of Grassfields basketry and particularly the products of the Aghem-Fungom area, however, is clearly expressed in his writings: "A high level of accomplishment is also achieved by basketry making, which has pro- duced very carefully woven and taste- fully decorated products in different techniques. Here too, Bamum is at the top, but the Bali also make very beautiful baskets with black and red patterns, and ravishingly beautiful covered baskets braided with black and red string and with a high foot come from Bafum [Aghem-Fungom area]" (Ankermann 1910:307-8, translated from the German). Some forty years later, in his book on the art of Cameroon, Paul Gebauer pro- vided the first fairly comprehensive dis- cussion of Grassfields basketry. It is to his merit that he points to the impor- tance of baskets at all, but his remarks are still very general, and unfortunately in- correct in regard to some types (Gebauer 1979:95-96, 257 ff.). Basketry from sev- eral regions of Cameroon is included in Tamara Northern's recent catalogue (1984:112-13). Three of the four Grassfields examples pictured come from the Aghem-Fungom area. She in- terprets one of them as a utility basket (no. 39, similar to Fig. 4), another as a ceremonial basket probably used by a title holder (no. 38, similar to Fig. 14), and the third as a prestige basket used in the palace (Fig. 1). Her inferences are obviously drawn from the materials and the composition of the baskets, going from the simple (all raffia) to the more elaborate (having a wooden base) to the fancy (having the wooden base and em- bellishments of cloth, glass beads, and cowrie shells). These interpretations need revision, as will be shown. Let us now look at the production of baskets in the Aghem-Fungom area, in particular in the village chiefdom of Weh. For the most part, basketry items in Weh were and still are made by women. It is an activity that, as we shall see, fits into their everyday patterns of agricultural and domestic work.9 The Grassfields provides a classic example of an all- 44</page><page sequence="4">female farming system. Men occasion- ally help with very heavy tasks like re- moving the thick growth of grass when new farming areas are opened, or, in the past, harvesting heavy crops like cocoyam. Traditionally they have been in charge of tree cultures, including raffia palms used in basketry, and have oc- cupied themselves with hunting, trad- ing, warfare, and village politics. A woman's day during the season of intensive farm work begins before dawn, when she gets up and cooks a meal for the children and the husband, if it is her turn.10 Then, carrying hoe and baskets, she walks to her fields, not all of which are located in the same area of Weh, covering up to five or six kilometers each way (Fig. 3). Returning in the late afternoon, she washes herself and cooks an evening meal. Every eighth day (the last day of the traditional Weh week) is a day of rest, the "day of the village" (tshu ina'). The women stay in the village and may do their laundry in the morning at one of the small rivers crisscrossing Weh territory.1' The afternoon is reserved for social activities: visits from relatives and friends, and meetings of the women's secret societies - the powerful Kefab and its prerequisite, Fembwi - and of the savings association (njangi or bang = bank). People sit together, converse, and drink palm wine. In the dry season, from November to March, these patterns change. The landscape transforms from lush tones of green to dry yellows and browns. Begin- ning in December, the harmattan brings clouds of fine dust from the Sahara de- sert, shrouding the countryside like fog. Farm work is suspended, and when the moon lights up the night, there is danc- ing and singing all over the village. This is the period of the annual festivals, when men will be admitted into the Djitisem and Okum societies, and women into Fembwi or Kefab.12 Now is the time to make pottery and baskets. During these days the women will some- times sit on little "bamboo'"13 stools in a shady spot in the compound or by the door inside the house and work on bas- kets. Some who are known for their beautiful handiwork and some who are too old to farm will produce baskets the year around. As the activity requires a certain amount of strength and the abil- ity to go out and collect the necessary materials, it excludes the very old and frail. Utility baskets last two years on the average, but heavy usage and the pres- ence of small children in the house often mean that they have to be replaced at least once a year. This is done by the woman herself or by female relatives, neighbors, or friends. In the past, little girls, observing their mothers at work, would soon begin to practice weaving their own. Although every woman knew how to make all kinds of baskets, the less skilled restricted themselves to the easier utility types, while those well known for 4. WOVEN IFU BASKET FROM AGHEM.

They were paid in kind for their services, or if it was the farming season their female customers helped them with the farm work for one or two days. Typically the customer brought the materials or helped the bas- ket maker to procure them. The basket maker also received enough groundnuts to fill a medium-size basket. On the av- erage, it took the woman one day to make a plain utility basket, two days if she added decoration. A decorated bas- ket with a cylindrical foot (ifu, pl. tefu) took approximately four days. It was not until the colonial period that markets were introduced to Weh and most other villages in the area. Today one can buy baskets in these markets, al- though not many women produce them for sale. Only a few in Weh still know how to make the more complicated types. The outstanding work of two or three women is sold to Bamenda along with baskets of lesser quality.14 There are two basic types of basketry: woven and coiled. The woven baskets are made out of fiber from the raffia palm that grows in groves along the small riv- ers in Weh. The swampy territory around the palm stands is assigned to patrilineages (sare kebi) and in turn is di- vided among the compounds (kebi). Raf- fia palms also provide building materials and "bamboo" for furniture. Life inWeh revolves around the production and consumption of palm wine (nle in Weh, mimbo in Pidgin). There is no activity without the drinking and sharing of mimbo, no ritual without its libation. Thus, the raffia palms are a Weh man's most cherished possession. s15 Most of the men work daily in their groves (bush in Pidgin) tapping palm wine and procur- ing building supplies. The basket maker or a friend gathers and prepares the raf- fia, cutting fresh shoots into narrow strips or making wider strips from the soft pith of the central rib of the fernlike fronds. The raffia baskets are made by the plain weave technique common all over Africa.'6 The warps are wide and flat, radiating from the bottom of the basket, while the wefts are thinner and more flexible. The women make the strips pli- able by immersing them in water. Typi- cally they finish the edge of a basket by cutting off the warps and tightening them between two slats, such as an outer and an inner ring of thin, flexible reeds; the edge can be embellished by in- tertwining thin raffia fiber strands in a braided pattern. For structural rein- forcement and decorative effect, an addi- tional layer of flat raffia strips is threaded through the weave on the outside of the basket (Fig. 4) with a small awl (Inside Back Cover), once one of the main prod- ucts of the local blacksmiths. As a final touch, the women attach twisted strings of fiber in x-like patterns or in solid squares (Fig. 4). The high foot of an ifu is built up from wider raffia strips and completely covered with twisted (some- times braided) strands of fiber. Small baskets may also be covered with strands of twisted fiber (Fig. 2). The fiber is dyed locally Black used to be produced by pounding the bark of the ughai tree and boiling it with the leaves of the usiie tree. After the raffia was boiled with this liquid, it was buried in a muddy spot. Camwood (kebiH in Weh, bundu in Pidgin), used to obtain red, was im- ported to Weh in dried loaves; the tree 46</page><page sequence="6">(Pterocarpus soyanxii) from which it is pro- duced does not grow in Weh territory (Warnier 1985:69). Camwood, applied as paint to the body and to a wide variety of objects, is of major importance in ritual (see Rowlands 1985:205, 209). With the introduction of markets and European goods, ready-made dyes became avail- able. The red is now either a dye of Euro- pean manufacture or garulua, a sub- stance purchased from Hausa traders. In fact, during the last few years baskets produced for the tourist market with decoration in green and violet fiber or colorful plastic threads have become very popular. Raffia baskets, except for the plainest ones and some specific types, resemble other household receptacles, such as the wooden or clay bowls in which food is served. All such containers have a rounded bottom, requiring that they be set on supporting fiber rings. This characteristic distinguishes baskets in Weh, Aghem, Esu, and some other vil- lages from the products of nearby areas. The slightly concave walls typical of most clay and wooden containers are achieved by tightening the wefts in the lower third of the form. Coiled baskets come in all sizes, and, as in the case of the woven variety, the technique is relatively simple compared with coiling techniques found elsewhere. Smaller baskets are composed com- pletely of grass fibers, the foundation wound into a spiral. Larger baskets are made from the flexible stalks of a reed- like plant (tebunnge) that grows in the raf- fia groves. It is relatively hard to find, so once a spot is discovered, the women regularly return to it. An iron awl serves to wind grass around the coils of tebunnge that form the walls and to stitch the coils together every so often. Typically the spi- ral foundation is not completely covered with grass threads. Decorative effects like triangular patterns may be created by stitching across two coils. Sometimes coiled baskets are also attached to cylin- drical supports (Fig. 5). In the past, every activity in women's lives was accompanied by baskets. For their major task, farm work, they usually had three that were taken to the fields. Most conspicuous was the large raffia basket (fekile, pl. ukile) carried on the head on a supporting fiber ring used for transporting heavy loads of freshly har- vested corn or cocoyam (Fig. 3). These baskets were not only sturdily con- structed but also finely decorated with geometric designs of twisted raffia fiber string threaded through the gaps in the weave. Clearly, much effort went into their making. Young girls received afekiie when they were about seven or eight and began to accompany their mothers to the farms. They had previously carried smal- ler baskets of this type made for them by their mothers, which they would prac- tice balancing and occasionally playfully dance with in the village (Fig. 6). Ukiie have been largely replaced by enamel dishes, and only a few older women carry them to the farm today. Large bas- kets are still commonly used, however, for washing groundnuts and other small crops, either in the rivers (Fig. 8) or at the modern water outlets all over the village. Sa'afefu (pl. sa'atefu), the second type of basket taken to the fields, was also made of raffia but was smaller and of simpler construction. It was usually placed in- side or on top of the large working basket (Fig. 3). Every woman knew how to weave the sa'afefu. The women, and oc- casionally men,17 used it to carry seeds during planting (Fig. 9) and small vege- tables harvested during weeding. It was a true utility basket, serving numerous other purposes. One could, for example, 7A -, , . 8. CLEANING GROUNDNUTS IN A RIVER IN AGHEM. PHOTOGRAPH BY WILHELM SCHNEIDER, 1934. . .....- -- , ..,. . 9.

Similar small baskets (ketamm, pl. utamm) were used in the house as containers for corn kernels, vegetables, groundnuts, and other foods. Some had covers and were hung on the wall so that rodents and small children could not get to them. These baskets were basically every- where, and to this day, older women fre- quently use them as containers. The last type of basket used in farm work was the small kesunngi (pl. usunngi), which was suspended from the back of the waist (Fig. 2; Fig. 3, woman at right). The twisted raffia strings hanging from the rim covered the buttocks of the woman when she sat on the ground and also served to balance the container, into which she might put edible caterpillars or crickets collected while weeding and harvesting. During the planting season, the kesunngi held ready a small supply of seeds, such as corn and pumpkin or groundnuts. Ankermann took to Berlin two of these small baskets, acquired in Bum and in Nyos (Museum fuir V61olker- kunde, Berlin, nos. C III 24948, 24949; lost during World War II). According to his catalogue entry dated 1909, this type "is supposedly worn as apron on the buttocks during their [women's] work (?)," and "it is carried by men (?) on their backs when they dance." This second ten- tative statement is, like the first, correct; during dance entertainments men play- fully tie such baskets to their backs in im- itation of women. In Weh men dance with them during performances like ndong or baya, much to the delight of the crowd. Coiled baskets of different sizes were also used in the domestic sphere, along with those of woven raffia. The larger ones, for example, held corn flour. Small- er baskets, tightly stitched to make them watertight, were once used to serve food, such asfufu (Pidgin for ground and cooked maize, which in Weh is called kebaa, pl. ubaa). There are different ways of preparing fufu. Most commonly, though, it is made into fairly hard loaves that would be arranged in the baskets when hot and offered first to the hus- band. These serving baskets, and their clay dish counterparts as well, have been replaced by colorful enamel pots of all sizes with equally bright lids. .&lt; ~ '\\ i -- 10.

Foreign visitors to the area noticed that a wife would serve cooked cocoyam to her husband in such a container on the days of rest. For this reason, it has come to be known as a "wedding basket," an allusion to its con- nection to the marital relationship. Nevertheless, this designation is rather misleading, as there was no wedding ceremony in which the basket played a specific part; marriages were formed slowly over time with few ceremonial culminations. In earlier times, in Weh and surround- ing villages, infants to six- or seven- year-olds were married18 to men much their senior (see also Geary 1985:11-12). Once the arrangements had been made with the parents, the husband, with the support of other members of his pat- rilineage,19 would begin to pay bridewealth to the in-laws. When the girl menstruated for the first time, her mother informed the husband that his wife was ready for sexual relations. The young woman would stay in her parents' compound until she became a mother, and only move to her husband's com- pound when the child was walking. A little girl was well aware of who her hus- band was, and would occasionally bring him food and let him participate in her steps toward womanhood. After one such step, the planting of her first corn, she would give her husband some espe- cially well-grown ears from that harvest. She would take her first nicely woven basket to her husband as well. A woman pregnant for the first time commissioned an ifu, called fu'iwaa in this context ("basket [for] child"), from a woman expert in weaving especially beautiful baskets. She would keep food for the child in it. It should be noted that even very small children who were still nursing were occasionally given solid food. Soon after birth, they were ritually fed cooked plantain, a practice that con- tributed to a very high infant mortality rate and was discontinued only in the 1940s. A woman used the same basket for each child. While in Weh, I never saw afu'iwaa, but was told that it was slightly larger and had a somewhat lower foot than the tefu made presently in the area. Of all the basketry types from the Aghem-Fungom area, the ifu is to this day the most important in ritual life. It figures, for example, in the initiation into prestige societies for men who have es- tablished a big compound, amassed wives and wealth, and, most impor- tantly, fathered children. They have shown that they are no small men (a Pid- gin term used to mean "unimportant men"), but prominent members of the community. Weh has Djitisem and the more important senior Okum society, for which the membership in Djitisem is a precondition. Similar but variously named prestige societies exist in most vil- lages in the area; in Aghem, for example, the senior society is called Okum, but the equivalent of Djitisem is known as Tidua. During the dry season in Weh, ini- tiation into these two societies is per- formed in a house in the society own- er's20 compound, after which the new member displays his status by dancing around the village. The wife who bore him the first child, thus being responsi- ble for his acceptance into the society, dances with him, carrying a new ifu bas- ket filled with food on top of her head (Fig. 10). The basket is traditionally supplied by the wife's mother, whose in- volvement seems to allude to the con- tinuity provided by the female line in bringing forth children. She too dances with the celebrants through the village, and even dances with the ifu in her daughter's place if the latter has just de- livered another child and cannot partici- pate in the festivities. The meaning of baskets in the lives of women is most clearly expressed during their funerals, where baskets and their specific contents are a metaphor for women's productivity as farmers and 13.

On the wall of another dwelling in the compound, a raffia lad- der of the type that leads to the attic of a woman's house is put up, and new cloths displayed on it, some of which will later on be put into the grave. The de- ceased, clothed in a new dress22 that she reserved particularly for her funeral, is seated outside on a raffia stool in front of this ladder and held up from behind by a son-in-law (Fig. 11). Another relative, often a sister, sits in front of the corpse and holds its hands. If the deceased bore many children and acquired mem- bership in Fembwi and Kefab, thus giv- ing her the title of na'tum (big mami in Pidgin),23 a small delicately coiled basket filled with pumpkin seeds (egusi) is set on her lap, indicating that she was a "mother of crops," as the Weh put it. A chicken is ritually killed and one of its wings roasted in a small fire. Then the compound head brings a big basket (fekiie) filled with uncooked cocoyams, which is emptied out on the ground, and some of the cocoyams are put one by one into an ifu - referred to as fu'sike in the funeral context - that has been placed beside the deceased. Each compound keeps one, to be used over and over again. They are often heavily patinated from having hung inside the smoky houses for many years. A smaller coiled basket filled with cowpeas is placed on top of the fu'sike. Finally, a piece of the deceased's raffia-pith sleeping mat, pos- sibly an allusion to the most intimate sphere of her life, is put next to the bas- ket with the cocoyams. A small quantity of salt, highly cherished, and a small clay dish with palm oil are set atop it. Both ingredients, which have to be im- ported,24 are an important part of a good meal. Like the fu'sike, the cocoyams and the cowpeas, planted and harvested by women, stand for the woman's capabil- ity as a producer and preparer of food. Once the corpse has been placed out- side, people begin to file by They bring food for the die (Pidgin for funeral cele- bration) and bid farewell to the deceased (Fig. 12). In the meantime, a goat is ritu- ally slaughtered by one of the sons-in- law, who must be a member in Okum, and a small piece of its leg is roasted and put into a little calabash of the type used for drinking palm wine. The roasted and cut-up chicken wing, a little salt, and some palm oil are added. A large basket of the fekiie type is placed on a fiber ring in front of the deceased's paternal aunt. The women of the matrilineage then re- move all the cowpeas from the small coiled basket on top of the fa'sike and some cocoyams from the fu'sike, putting them into the big basket, which the women then rub with palm oil. Finally a son-in-law places the calabash with the meats into it. The women empty the coiled basket containing the egusi, which had been placed on the corpse's lap, and carry the egusi into the house, where they will mourn the death in the days to come. They may use it later in a dish cooked for the mourners. 14 ORNATE COILED BASKET WITH WOODEN FOOT 25cm COLLECTED BY CAPTAIN MENZEL IN AGHEM, 1909 MUSEUM FOR VOLKERKUNDE, BERLIN. 15 LARGE RAIN COVER, HEIGHT 116cm.

WOMEN WITH RAIN COVERS WORKING THEIR FIELDS IN THE BUSH TERRITORY OF WEH. PHOTOGRAPH BY WILHELM SCHNEIDER, 1934. Before the deceased is finally put into the grave chamber by her sons-in-law, all women must leave. I interpret this exclu- sion as protecting women, who give life, from witnessing the transition to the other world. 25The men lay the corpse in the grave chamber on its right side, fac- ing out of the chamber. They add some of the cloths that were displayed on the raf- fia ladder and put the coiled basket that had contained the egusi either below or behind the corpse's feet. The drinking calabash with the meats, salt, and oil from the large basket is placed below the feet as well. Then the grave chamber is closed with raffia sticks and the raffia covered with soil. After tamping down some of the soil with a heavy stone, the men remove the cowpeas and cocoyams from the large basket, smash the basket, and put it into the grave. They then fill in the grave. These descriptions of the baskets in ritual reveal how the ifu in particular is a symbol of the woman's life cycle, from childhood marriage to motherhood to death. More than any other basket it stands as a metaphor for the productive and reproductive aspects of womanhood and for the husband-wife relationship, which is most obviously expressed by the wife's dancing with the ifu during the initiation celebration for Djitisem. To a lesser degree, baskets in general seem to assume this meaning, as can be deduced from their use in women's funerals. Smashing a big farming basket, for example, and putting it into the grave indicate the end of a productive life in this world. It is possible that men once partici- pated in the production of some basket- ry forms; some types were entirely made by men, as is probably the case with the ornate baskets composed of various mate- rials; some have a wooden foot, and beads or cowries may be attached to the basketry. As I pointed out earlier, the possession of such elaborate baskets was not a prerogative of the chiefs. Al- though, of course, chiefs were wealthy enough to commission these prestige ob- jects, big men could have done so as well, and to this day such baskets can be found in some of their compounds. Elaborated forms of the ifu basket ap- pear in museum collections. None is as extraordinary as a piece in the Institute of Ethnography, Leningrad, collected be- fore the First World War (Fig. 13). This unique example has a basket supported by two anthropomorphic figures in the typical angular carving style of the Aghem-Fungom area.26 Another ornate ifu is in the collection of the Museum fur Vol61kerkunde, Berlin (Fig. 1).27 Here the high foot is a wooden cylinder decorated with geometrical designs carved in relief. Beads and cowries on the basketry com- ponent add further elaboration. Such wooden cylinders, which also occur in combination with small coiled baskets (Fig. 14), display a wide variety of geometrical designs in bas-relief. The carvers of the Aghem-Fungom area re- fined the art of relief carving to an extraordinarily high standard, as can be seen, for example, in their carved door- posts. The ornate ifu prestige basket was probably for serving cocoyam to a wealthy and prominent compound head, and also for use in funerals. There are indica- tions that the elaborate coiled baskets with the wooden foot served mainly as receptacles on ceremonial occasions. The only time I observed one in use was dur- ing a divination session and sacrifice per- formed on the second day of a man's funeral. Small amounts of sacrificial food were placed in it, and the rest given out to the male participants in the ritual. I have already suggested that men and women produced the ornate baskets to- gether, the women making the basketry part, the men sculpting the wooden support. The involvement of both sexes in their production seems a logical exten- sion of the ifu as a metaphor for the male-female relationship. However, none of my questioning in Weh led to an affirmation of this assumption, as this item has not been made for decades. Besides these women's baskets, there were some utilitarian basketry products made by both men and women. Most notable among them were the so-called umbrellas (sing. uba') that women would 51</page><page sequence="11">wear for protection from the rain during farm work (Figs. 15, 16). Their design al- lowed them to stay dry as they bent over to work the soil with their rather short- handled hoes. These were produced in different sizes from wide pith strips of the raffia palm and padded with dried banana leaves. They were common not only in the Aghem-Fungom area but all the way to the Bamenda Plateau. The production of the uba' for sale was a prof- itable venture, and men engaged heavily in this activity, outnumbering the few female makers.28 Today, the basketry rain covers have been replaced by Western-style umbrellas, although lately tailors have begun to stitch together clear plastic material in the shape of the tradi- tional uba'. It remains to be seen whether this design will be popular. There are two or three old men in Weh who still pro- duce the basketry version, but as in so many other traditional trades, the occu- pation is virtually a thing of the past. Typical men's basketry products in- cluded fairly large baskets (ketiie, pl. utfie) made from soft strips of raffia palm shoots, set on four pieces of "bamboo" (Figs. 18, 19). They were strictly utilita- rian and undecorated except for very simple patterns produced by reversing some of the wefts, the outside of the strip's shiny bark being darker than the inside. Every man knew how to make his own utile, but there seem to have been some who specialized in their produc- tion, because the export of these items to low-lying neighboring areas like Esimbi, lacking in raffia palms, offered potential for profit (Fig. 17). Boys and men carried the baskets in the typical fashion, on the left shoulder, occasionally supporting the load with a walking stick placed over the right shoulder (Fig. 20). When the indigenous smelting and blacksmithing industry still functioned, they used them- to transport charcoal. They also used them when they helped women with the harvesting of heavy crops, such as maize and cocoyam. Since the advent of cash crop farming for men and the drain on manpower by labor migration, only a few men have been assisting women with the harvest. Their baskets have been replaced by sacks carried over the shoulder or strapped onto bicycles. Other basketry products made by men and older boys were simple sleeping mats, sturdy mats used for fencing com- pounds, and hats. While the mats and fencing were traditional items, it seems that hat production was inspired by Hausa models. Some major long- distance trade routes crossed the Aghem-Fungom area and connected the northern part of the Grassfields with the Takum and Benue regions. Hausa trad- ers traveled this route around 1900, pos- sibly much earlier. For many decades Weh has had a Hausa colony located near the market square, providing ample op- portunity for Weh men to familiarize themselves with Hausa products. Hats, as opposed to rain covers, have not gone completely out of style, and there are two or three men in Weh who still make them for sale. Men in the Aghem-Fungom area also produced coiled basketry. By this method they used to make small round or rectangular hand-held shields, used against adversaries from the same village or from a neighboring chiefdom to which they had close ties. Carried out with sticks, this type of fighting, called kengdit in Weh, avoided ritual pollution caused by bloodshed and killing within close so- cial circles. Some of the shields are still kept in Weh compounds, and men will occasionally bring them out for dancing ndong or the forceful dance of the Man- jong warrior association. A fine dance shield in Berlin's Museum ffir V61ker- kunde attests not only to the craftsman- ship of the makers, but also to their art- istry, displayed in the dark geometric de- sign (Fig. 21). In summary, it seems obvious that the analysis of traditional basketry in Weh and of its use in daily life offers in- sights into the structure of the Weh 17.

While both men and women were traditionally involved in its produc- tion, the motivation and direction of their activities differed. Men clearly made basketry for commercial purposes, but women's production was mainly for consumption within the domestic unit (see also Aronson 1984:119). Today, men have almost completely abandoned the art, as their products have been re- placed by Western goods, while some women still weave baskets for their own use. Moreover, it is now women who produce their type of basketry for sale to tourists in Bamenda, although it is doubtful whether this new industry will ultimately be successful. A rather complex picture has emerged of specific types of baskets being used on particular occasions. While some baskets were produced and exclusively used in certain rituals, others that might be clas- sified as utilitarian forms could be en- dowed with ritual meaning. For exam- ple, the fekiie, the big decorated farming basket, is smashed during a woman's funeral and buried with her. Most in- triguing is the ifu, the basket with the cylindrical foot, representing the female element in the metaphoric scheme of several rituals in which it appears. The ifualso marks the social stages of a woman's life from marriage to death. It thus seems appropriate to consider the baskets made by women as one of the elements symbolizing femaleness in Weh society. The light shed on these issues by studying basketry should encourage us to look at other neglected art forms as well. While masking and the court arts are certainly of major importance, the preoccupation with these aspects of art historical research in the Grassfields may have kept us from large-scale explora- tion of all areas of artistic expression. In- tensive study of the less spectacular art forms may ultimately allow us a better understanding of the dynamics that shaped this area's artistic output and remedy some of the confusion created by overgeneralized and one-dimensional accounts on Grassfields arts. It is hoped that this paper is a beginning. El Notes, page 89 OL ?-l Zzt I,, j. P ji 77 '04? OPA si 21 COILED BASKETRY SHIELD, HEIGHT 63cm. COLLECTED BY CAPTAIN MENZEL IN AGHEM, 1909.

My stay was sponsored by a grant from the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft. I thank Professor Riidiger Schott for his kind support of my work at the University of Munster, the institution with which I was affiliated during this research project. Iam most grateful to Fon Nji II of Weh for making my stay in Weh a successful one. I also thank my assistant, Mr. J.C. Mebeng, for his untiring support, Miss Deborah Bei Kum, who helped with the work of collecting data on bas- ketry, and Mr. Richard Kumengisa for his written communi- cation. Dr. Monni Adams read the draft of this paper, for which I am most appreciative. Finally I want to express my deep gratitude to Mbong Nkuo Saa Lei Saa, who patiently put up with my sometimes awkward questions about bas- kets. She was even then very old and frail, and died a few months after I left Weh. This paper is dedicated to her. To keep phonetic transcriptions as simple as possible, I have eliminated tonal markings and used the Germanai and ii where they come very close to the actual pronounciation. 1. The Cameroon Grassfields is a highland area in western Cameroon. To the north it is bordered by the savannas of Adamawa, to the south and west by the low-lying belt of the coastal rain forest. The term "Grassfields" was introduced by the British administration and, as in many such instances, has been adopted by the population to characterize the region as a whole or their inhabitants. Thus, a person from the Grassfields may designate himself as a "Grafi." The name is also used by the seminomadic Fulbe herdsmen who have migrated into the region; they call the sedentary population "Garafis." While "Cameroon Grassfields" is now most com- monly used in English scholarly writing, the designation "Grasslands" (from the German "Kameruner Grasland") also occurs. Finally, there is a new and rather cumbersome construction, "Grassy Uplands of Cameroon" (Koloss 1985:3). 2. I am using the term "art" in the broadest way, thus eliminating the artificial separation of "craft" and "art." As another option, Paul Gebauer uses the term "minor art" in reference to Cameroon basketry (1979:95). 3. When looking through back issues of African Arts, I found only a few papers on basketry One of the most recent dealt with rural Kwazulu basketry (Levinsohn 1980). In 1978, Joffe described the revival of traditional Botswana basketry for sale to tourists, and in the same issue of African Arts, Smith studied gender-specific forms of basketry among the Gurensi. The dearth of studies is typical for an art produced by women, and may also reflect the replacement of baskets as domestic containers by imported enamelware, a process that began early in the colonial period. Thus, much of the research on baskets requires historical reconstruction. 4. The best critical evaluation of art historical research in the Grassfields to date is a short paragraph on the "musle im- aginaire [of the Grassfields]" by Warnier, a French an- thropologist (1985:70 ff.). Having spent many years doing fieldwork in the area, he is well aware of the lack of systematic art historical studies. His criticism should not be taken lightly 5. I have chosen the designation "Aghem-Fungom area" be- cause it is commonly used when referring to the numerous chiefdoms to the north of the kingdom of Kom. This classifi- cation originated during the British colonial period. After the Germans left in 1915, the British had considerable difficulty organizing the administration of the independent chiefdoms. They finally created the Wum Native Authority, identical to the traditional chiefdom federation of Aghem, composed of eight independent chiefdoms; and later on the Fungom Na- tive Authority (see Chilver 1963), named after one of its cen- trally located village chiefdoms. The creation of the Fungom Native Authority reflected some of the British perceptions of the ethnic and historical composition of the area, which had been studied in detail by assessment officers (Chilver 1963:110 ft.). Most of the village chiefdoms it encompasses indeed show common characteristics. The administrative division between the two Native Authorities was, however, artificial, since Aghem and many of the village chiefdoms in the Fun- gom area have interacted for centuries, although claiming di- verse origins and speaking different languages. Aghem and the chiefdoms in the Fungom area are linked through inter- marriage and trade. 6. The term appeared most recently in Northern's 1984 catalogue, where it mistakenly designates the kingdom of Bum, judging by the map on page 16. That kingdom, how- ever, was usually called Bafumbum (or Bafum-Bum and occa- sionally Gross-Bafum) in the German literature. On Moisel's 1913 map, the standard map for Cameroon under German domination, Bafum and Bum are marked separately as neighboring regions. The pieces that Northern attributes to "Bafum" originate from the Aghem-Fungom area and not from Bum, where very little collecting activity took place dur- ing the German colonial period. Her "Esu" pieces have the same provenience, Esu being part of the "Bafum" area in old German terminology (Northern 1984; 110 ff., 158 ff.). 7. For my research in Weh, I took along about 100 photo- graphs by the Reverend Wilhelm Schneider, who lived in Weh from 1932 to 1936, and discussed them with the people. I thank him for allowing me to use them in my research and to publish some of the pictures in this paper. 8. The present chief of Weh took the titlefon after his installa- tion in 1976, indicating his desire to be on equal footing with the other chiefs in the Grassfields. This change coincided with the administrative ranking of the Grassfields chiefs ac- cording to official categories. 9. See a short discussion of the women's workload in Weh in Geary 1986:9-10. 10. Most Weh women live in polygynous marriages and take turns caring for their husbands. 11. In 1977, a Swiss development organization installed a water system in Weh. Now women do their laundry at outlets all over the village. 12. See a description of societies and associations in Weh in Geary 1979. 13. The term "bamboo" is commonly used in Pidgin English for the ribs of the raffia palm, which resemble bamboo. 14. One of the elders of the Presbyterian church was in charge of buying "wedding baskets" from women in Weh and taking them to Prescraft in Bamenda. About twice a year, he would transport a big sackful in a bush taxi. When I was there, this method of transport had become expensive, and the women makers wanted to charge more for their products (they received about 400 CFA for one basket). The store's managers found that even at a selling price of 1200 CFA per basket, the profit margin was too low. Consequently, the supply of these baskets has dried up in Prescraft. 15. Although the raffia palm is of tremendous importance, only Valentin (1970) has dealt with this topic in his short pa- per. 16. For the analysis of basketry techniques I drew on Balfet's paper (1957) on basket classification. 17. Occasionally men would plant, as the Weh saw a direct relationship between the planter and the growth of the crop. Planting done by men symbolized the desire for a strong and healthy harvest. Children often would help with the sowing as well. It was thought that they, who were growing, might stimulate quick development of the crop. 18. I prefer to designate this relationship, even at this early stage, as marriage and not betrothal; the girl is addressed as "wife of [husband's name]" as soon as the parents have agreed to her suitor's request and begun to receive bridewealth. It should be stressed that the term "marriage," if understood in the Western sense, is rather misleading, as the formation of a conjugal union follows a very different pat- tern. 19. Weh has a patrilineal system of kinship, while some of the other village chiefdoms in Aghem and Fungom have mat- rilineal institutions. 20. As in other parts of the Grassfields, societies can be ac- quired from other owners of the same society; that is, the paraphernalia and the right to perform the rituals associated with them and to draw the benefits from the incoming pay- ments of the members are transferred. This purchase is des- ignated as nei (to take) in Weh, as opposed to so'o (to buy something in the market). See also Geary 1979:56-57. 21. I have restricted my description here to women's funer- als. Men's funerals contain some of the same elements and similar rituals, but it is not baskets but rather the deceased's raffia bag that plays a prominent part in them. This account of the funeral is necessarily abbreviated. 22. Until the 1950s, most women in Weh wore no more than a belt, ear and lip plugs, and occasionally iron bracelets. But as early as the German colonial period some women were either working on the plantations on the coast or accompany- ing their husbands to other parts of Cameroon. They re- turned to Weh wearing coastal- and Western-style clothes, thus acting as innovators. 23. Women who have completed the high payments for membership in Kefab and have been initiated in the esoteric knowledge of this society thus acquire the title na'tum. 24. See Warnier 1985:102 ff. His analysis of internal and ex- ternal trade relationships is the first comprehensive effort on this subject, and is of great importance to art historical re- search in the Grassfields. 25. The Weh believe that the deceased goes to an afterworld that is the exact replica of the world he or she came from. This place is located in the ground under Weh, and there are en- trances to it in the Weh bush that are known to some clair- voyants. 26. This piece (no. 4790-5) is pictured twice in Olderogge 1969 (figs. 152, 153). When I showed a photograph of it to older men and women in Weh, none of them remembered ever having seen an ifu with caryatid figures. Caryatid fig- ures, however, frequently support carved wooden bowls. 27. Museum fir V61olkerkunde, Berlin, no. 26528 a,b, also pic- tured in Northern 1984:112. The basket was collected by Lieutenant Fechtner, who engaged in a punitive expedition in the Fungom area in June 1910, after the chief of Kung, whom the Germans considered the paramount of the area, com- plained that some of the surrounding chiefdoms had raided his village (Fechtner 1910). Fechtner carefully noted down where he had acquired or confiscated the pieces in the collec- tion. This basket comes from "Ijuo," the German designation for the small chiefdom of Zua (or Zhoaw according to British spelling), which is an offshoot of Weh (Geary 1976:83 ff.). 28. In the only analysis of Aghem trade to date, Kopytoff explores the oil-kola-salt long-distance trade, a venture in which Aghem actively participated. He briefly mentions rain covers under "other items of trade." Aghem as well as Weh exported raffia products to the low-lying areas of Befang and Esimbi, for example, where raffia palms did not grow well (Kopytoff 1981:376-77).
