Tie On the vast the richest south interior areas line plain in of of eastern low Drama hills Macedonia. crossed is one of the richest areas in eastern Macedonia. On the south a line of low hills crossed by the road to Kavala separates the plain from the littoral of the Aegean Sea. Mt. Pangaeus over- looks it to the southwest, and on the north the foothills of the Rhodope Mountains border Bul- garia, which is easily accessible through the two river valleys of the Nes tos and the Strymon. In Roman and Byzantine times, the plain was important and the city of Philippi on its southern edge was a thriving center on the route from Dyrrachium (modern Durazzo) to Byzantium (modern Istanbul), the famous via Egnatia. Near Philippi a small hill rises some fourteen meters high. On it is a ruined building overgrown with vegetation. It is called nowadays Dikili Tash, a Turkish word that means "upright stone" and refers to a Roman funeral monument at the foot of the hill.

By JEAN DESHAYES picked up numerous painted or incised sherds dating to the Neolithic period. From that time, sherds and figurines continued to be collected until 1961 when the Greek Archaeological Ser- vice fenced off the hill. Except for some minor and unpublished soundings made by the French School at Athens in 1921 and 1922, this promis- ing site remained unexplored. In 1961, Mr. Georges Daux, Director of the French School, ob- tained permission from the Greek authorities to proceed with soundings in collaboration with a team of Greek archaeologists directed by Dr. Theochares. After a long delay, a second cam- paign took place in 1967 and a third, in 1969. Up to the present we have undertaken only stratigraphie soundings, but the wealth of mate- rial encourages continuation. The French team made two series of soundings: a to d near the summit and e to i about halfway up the south- ern slope which faces the plain and is less steep than the other slopes. Because innumerable fox- holes had disturbed the stratification at the top of the hill, the soundings a to d were abandoned as soon as the Neolithic level was reached which was comparable to thé first level found in the soundings e to h. Twenty-seven successive levels of occupation have been discovered. Only level 1 on the summit (near the surface in squares a to c) dates from an historic period; it contained ruined Byzantine walls and a stone tumulus, probably Hellenistic. The other twenty-six levels belong to prehistoric periods, either the Neolithic or the Early Bronze Age. The Bronze Age material was found ex- clusively in soundings a to d where it corresponds to levels 2 to 16. The total depth of these layers reached a little more than three meters and few architectural structures were found. Only level 2 which is the latest yielded in squares b and c vestiges of a mud brick wall on foundations of stone sunken in a ditch. It is the abundant ceramic material that makes this excavation im- portant, especially the mixture of elements indi- cating diverse origins among the ceramic finds. 199</page><page sequence="3">ducili tas h continued Early Bronze Age pottery at Dikili Tash can be divided into two phases : eb i and eb ii. eb ii comes from levels 2 to 1 1 and has obvious affin- ities with the pottery from Asia Minor. Slanted- mouthed pitchers with handles joining the lip and shoulder were found in the latest eb levels. Prob- ably of Anatolian origin, vessels of this type ap- pear in the heart of the Anatolian plateau, no- tably in the Early Bronze i levels of Etiyoku§u and at a later period at Thermi in Lesbos in a shape akin to shapes found in Troy i. Of uncer- tain origin are trumpet handles, cut off obliquely at both ends and sometimes protruding above the lip. This form is known in western Anatolia and is characteristic of the earliest levels a to / of Troy i. At Dikili Tash trumpet handles occur from levels 11 on (i.e. the eb ii levels). Slanted- mouthed pitchers and trumpet handles are wide- spread throughout the Danubian countries: for example, both occur at Tell Ezero in southern Bulgaria from the earliest phase of the Bronze Age on. This latter phase at Tell Ezero may there- fore correspond chronologically to eb h at Dikili Tash and Troy I. Several incised patterns confirm the contem- poraneity of Troy i and the Early Bronze n at Dikili Tash. At both sites sherds occur with hatched triangles alternating to form a zig-zag band and lozenges also occur filled with dots, also cross- hatched triangles under which is placed a series of parallel bands hatched transversally. These incised patterns do not seem to have originated at Troy and they are not found elsewhere in Anatolia, but are common in the Danubian countries, especially on the Yugoslavian slope of the Balkan peninsula. Moreover, at Dikili Tash, they are accompanied by numerous other patterns that are unknown in the ceramics at Troy or Thermi: checkerboards with squares either decorated with small round im- pressions or cross-hatched alternately and dec- orated with small round impressions, as well as triangles that are excised or impressed into the clay and set in vertical or horizontal rows, to form a zig-zag band. These and other patterns are characteristic of Bosnian cultures at the end of the Chalcolithic period. They are found in the Slavonian culture of Gradina and numerous other sites, and they ob- viously originated there. A figurine found in level 5 belongs to a group of figurines called Zuto Brdo, the center of production of which was in the Dan- ube valley within the confines of Serbia and Ru- mania. Up to now, they were dated from the mid- dle of the second millennium b.c., but no strati- graphic evidence justified this assertion. The Dikili Tash excavations allow an earlier date and here, as on many other points, correct our knowledge of Danubian prehistory. Other elements of Danubian origin appear at Dikili Tash in the first phase of Early Bronze (eb i). This period must predate the beginning of Troy i. Dotted triangles forming a zig-zag band are found in the Baden Chalcolithic culture of Hungary and Northern Yugoslavia; but they are also found as early as the Middle Neolithic period at Danilo in Dalmatia. More typical of the Baden culture are the pitchers and the cups decorated with vertical or slightly oblique fluting; they are frequently found in the eb i levels at Dikili Tash. The relative chronology of Troy i, the Early Bronze Age at Dikili Tash and on the Greek main- land and the Baden culture is made more definite by the discovery in the eb i of Dikili Tash of a very significant form that does not occur at Troy i and Thermi but which has been found in Thessaly in the first levels of the Early Bronze Age at Argissa* namely cups with rounded, almost pointed, bot- toms and large loop handles rising above the rim. This type also is characteristic of the Baden culture. The conclusion we must draw - and it is an im- portant one - is that not only at Dikili Tash, but also in Thessaly and probably in the Greek main- land, the Early Bronze Age began at a date earlier than the beginning of Troy i. Relations between Dikili Ťash and the Aegean world are not limited to these traits alone, however. All during the Early Bronze Age we found vases, sherds and small objects which con- firm our conclusion about the relative chronol- ogy. Level 5 for example contained a bowl with an incurving rim and lateral spout which is like one recently found at Isthmia. Moreover, this form, absent in Dikili Tash eb i, appears at Tell Ezero from the earliest level of the Early Bronze Age. Again we have evidence of the contem- poraneity of the Early Bronze Age at Ezero and the second phase (eb ii) at Dikili Tash. Barbed arrowheads of flint parallel finds from the Early Bronze Age in the Aegean as for example at Eu- tresis and Korakou, situated in Boeotia and the Gorinthia respectively. Among the flint blades, we found an obsidian blade considered to be Melian in origin so that we may infer relations with the Gyclades and explain the diffusion as far as to Syros of such characteristic patterns as triangles excised or impressed in clay.

No evidence, however, of this relationship with the Cyclades appears in any earlier levels, which have exclu- sively Danubian affinities. D irectly below the earliest Bronze Age level is a thick burned layer in which were found many vases from the Late Neolithic (or Chalcolithic) periôd. The same destruction layer was found on the summit of the settlement (soundings a to d) and in soundings e to h where no Bronze Age re- mains covered it. The disaster represented by the burned layer was accompanied by a total change in the material remains. There are almost no points in common between the eleven or twelve levels of the Late Neolithic and those of the Bronze Age. Again, the architectural remains are badly pre- served with the exception of several remarkable ovens in the form of a thick deposit of sherds and stones surrounded by a curb of unbaked clay and covered with a sole or floor made of smooth clay and turned up at the edges. One end of this clay floor is curved up where a vault-like side could have reflected the heat. Several models of terracotta justify this restoration. 201</page><page sequence="5">Oven from square h, level 4.

DiKiLi tas h continued 202</page><page sequence="6">Study of the pottery allows us to connect the Late Neolithic of Dikili Tash to the Neolithic cultures of Rumania and Bulgaria. At the same time we can define its own special characteristics. The pottery is abundant and has very diverse fabric. Different decorative techniques are rep- resented and often combined on the same vase: ( 1 ) incisions frequently filled with a white paste ; (2) graphite-painted patterns; and (3) an ochre- red paint applied after baking. A fourth tech- nique, a black paint decoration often changing to a silvery-grey shade, is never combined with the other three techniques. It is placed against a red clay or red slip background. For the most part, the repertory of shapes in this last category is identical to the repertory of the graphite and the incised wares and we find the same preference for vases of elliptical, subrectangular or even perfectly square section and for irregular rims with large, protruding triangular lobes. The most characteristic types are made up of high, concave-necked vases with two vertical han- dles; biconical vases with large cylindrical necks and small angular handles placed at the top of the shoulder; large, necked-craters without han- dles ; and widemouthed bowls sometimes with a sinuous profile. The most significant decorative patterns are found in all the categories, espe- cially meanders, the placement of which follows various principles : horizontal bands, oblique bands, facing meanders placed two by two, a net- work of meanders covering the whole surface of the vase, in particular inside bowls or plates. Black-on-red ware offers certain traits all of its own: ring bases are frequent and the reper- tory of patterns is distinctive. There are, for ex- ample, large spiral volutes on both sides of a hori- zontal line encircling the belly about halfway down. These volutes do not exist in any other category. We find also at Dikili Tash the most typical patterns of the so-called Galepsos style - large black disks or half-disks, vertical bands which shrink to a point toward the lip or the bottom of the vase, and triangles with one ser- rated side. For the first time, sherds of the once controversial Galepsos style have been discovered in a well stratified context. It is significant that they all come from the highest (i.e. latest) level of the Neolithic period. Thus a bothersome prob- lem is resolved. The stratified finds of pottery reveal to us the development of the ceramic industry of the Neo- lithic period. Stylistic elements confirm the evo- lution, especially the use of the spiral. In the first phase, the spiral is very abundant, whether graphite-painted or incised or painted in black- on-red. It is most often placed in a continuous chain. In the second phase, the spiral becomes rarer and is used only separately, for example, to decorate triangles. Finally it is absent in the last layers of Late Neolithic. There is a parallel evo- lution in the incised decoration. In the earliest levels, the principal lines which are deeply en- graved are linked two by two with transverse lines much more lightly incised. The decoration thus amounts to a simple alteration between plain and hatched bands. This technique is not found in the latest levels. Toward the end of the period we see the checker pattern, notably in the graphite ware. In the case of the repertory of shapes, we find rolled-rim bowls decorated with fluting or oblique incisions. Finally, in the last levels of Late Neolithic, we discovered a metallurgical industry which left us various small copper instru- ments such as awls and chisels - all square in section. This evolution is, to some extent, parallel to the development which distinguishes the Maritza from the Gumelnitza phase in Danubian coun- tries; or to put this in other words using the equivalents of the Bulgarian site Karanovo on a tributary of the Maritza River, this evolution is equivalent to Karanovo v and vi. Yet the Late Neolithic (or Chalcolithic) of Dikili Tash gives the impression of a perfect unbroken sequence and not of two distinct cultures. In the case of the graphite ware in particular, we cannot com- pare a first phase with a "positive" decoration (cor- responding to the Maritza period in Bulgaria) and a second phase with a "negative" or reserved decoration (corresponding to the Gumelnitza period). The two techniques are found juxta- posed at the earliest levels and are still side by side in the latest levels. In the latest levels, however, bowls with inward rolling rims, bicon- ical vases with two vertical handles and various copper objects attest to the fact that these layers date from the last phase of the Gumelnitza period as it is represented in Bulgaria and Ru- mania. In Bulgaria and Rumania, however, we must take into account the fact that the reserved graphite decoration, never found side by side with the "positive" decoration, is characteristic of the Gumelnitza period but that it disappears in the later levels of this culture where graphite paint- ing no longer exists. Incised wares attest to the 203</page><page sequence="7">Female figurine from square h, level 3. Spindle whorl with incised signs from square g, level 5. Antler socket from square g, level 9. Middle Neolithic sherds with a brown matt decoration on a büß background from square f. dikili tas h continued same traditionalism at Dikili Tash: right up to the latest levels, the incised wares have numerous elements that are considered generally as con- temporary with Maritza and earlier than Gumel- nitza. This continuity and conservatism, added to the originality of the black-on-red decoration not found in the Late Neolithic period of Bulgaria, all confer a unique character upon the culture of Dikili Tash. w have discovered a multitude of small ob- jects of all kinds, in addition to the rich and varied pottery. There are flint tools, stone axes, adzes, chisels, mace heads of shell, bone imple- ments, antler sockets used to mount a handle on stone axes in accordance with the common prac- tice of Danubian Neolithic; sling pellets of dried clay (no arrowheads were picked up in these levels) and incised spindle whorls, complete the list. One of the spindle whorls has on its upper face a whole series of engraved designs all differ- ing from each other. Since the Tordos culture (dated to about the same period) has yielded several spindle whorls in Transylvania inscribed on their whole circumference, as well as numer- ous bottoms of vases where the signs suggest those of Dikili Tash, we wonder if we are not dealing with some system of writing in an embryonic stage. Numerous figurines have been inventoried. Some represent animals, in particular the two- headed animals like those found in Bulgaria since the beginning of the Neolithic period at Tell Asmak i. The Dikili Tash figurines, however, have the body ornamented with vertical or con- centric ribs. Other figurines are anthropomorphic, either male or, more commonly, female. The female figurines are sometimes very flat, but more often they are steatopygic and often incised or painted in black-on-red designs. The Late Neolithic of Dikili Tash comprises a level about 2.20 meters deep. At the bottom of this deposit a restricted exploratory sounding penetrated deep into Middle Neolithic levels with- out reaching, however, the earliest level. The latest Middle Neolithic levels have also been reached in squares g, h and i. There is a complete and abrupt change between the Late and Middle Neo- lithic cultures. Certain clues allow us to link the Middle Neolithic culture to the cultures of the Danubian countries: for example, antler sockets, the almost cylindrical elongated feet of vases which suggest the four-footed cups from Karanovo hi or even some cups from Vinča c. Finally a link is in- dicated by the black-topped red bowls covered over with a shiny glaze and by the bowls decorated with fluted spirals that recall respectively periods b and c of Vinca - which appear consequently, to date from the Middle Neolithic period. The fluted spiral ware is also found at Servia in western Macedonia. Other parallels also exist between Dikili Tash and western Macedonia. The sherds of light clay decorated with brownish bands of shiny paint underlined with incisions can easily be compared with some fragments from Nea Nikomedeia that, in the absence of comparative terms, have been attributed to the Late Neolithic period. On the other hand, burnished grey bowls with a horned 204</page><page sequence="8">Middle Neolithic bowl with shiny black glaze and fluted spirals from square f.

Various kinds of painted pottery known only in eastern Macedonia have been found : a buff ware decorated with brown matt patterns like that from Akropotamos; a pottery with stringy brown- ish bands on a greyish or orange-colored clay background, characteristic of the Drama plain (at Sitagri). are dealing, it seems, with a culture belonging to the northern districts of Greece, Macedonia and western Thrace, but with obvious affinities to several of the Danubian Middle Neolithic cultures, especially with Vinca b-c. As noted above, this culture at Dikili Tash was suddenly interrupted by an intrusion of an entirely differ- ent culture originating in the lower basin of the Danube. This change is probably explained as an invasion of peoples coming from the north to whom we owe the formation on the Drama plain of a civilization akin to the cultures of Maritza and Gumelnitza, yet quite different from both. Since this culture has first been investigated at Dikili Tash, it should carry the name of "Dikili Tash culture." Without doubt it is another in- vasion from the western slope of the Balkan penin- sula which annihilated this civilization before going on to the Anatolian coasts. Excavation at Dikili Tash for the first time has established an uninterrupted sequence from the Middle Neolithic to the Early Bronze Age and it has enabled us to define more precisely the rela- tive chronology of cultures which up to now we have had great difficulty in linking together. Troy i appears now fixed with respect to Gumelnitza and with respect to the Early Bronze Age of Greece and Bulgaria. Moreover, the excavation has brought to light the importance of elements of European origin in the culture of Troy i along- side of elements from the previous cultures of western Asia Minor and the heart of the Ana- tolian plateau. Traces of these Anatolian elements are found at Dikili Tash and as far away as the Danubian countries. In reality Troy i appears to be a crossroad where currents of diverse origins met. So it is with Dikili Tash, but at Dikili Tash the Danubian elements played a more decisive role in the genesis of the Early Bronze Age civil- ization. For Further Reading: G.
