<plain_text><page sequence="1">A Study in Architectural Iconography: Kaisersaal and the Imperial Cult FikretK. Yegiil The recent excavations and the subsequent reconstruction by the Harvard-Cornell Archaeological Expedition of a large and richly ornamented hall in Sardis, Turkey, provides the occasion for a closer look at the meaning and uses of similar spaces that may be associated with the Im- perial Cult (Figs. 1-3).1 Many of these, including the one from Sardis, form a part of "bath-gymnasium com- plexes," a new architectural type developed in Asia Minor during the Roman Imperial period which combines the Hellenistic gymnasium with the Roman bath.2 In Sardis the eastern half of the complex is occupied by a large courtyard surrounded by colonnades, the palaestra; the western half consists of many symmetrically arranged vaulted halls and is intended for bathing (Fig. 4). Separated from the west end of the palaestra by a row of double-engaged columns and positioned directly on the main axis of the building is the hall under discussion, dis- playing an opulent faCade architecture of alternating aediculae in two stories. A double-storied, pedimented group, supported by eight spirally fluted columns, crowns the main, semidomed apse of the west side. This space, named the "Marble Court" by the excavators, was reconstructed from the ground up between 1964 and 1973.3 At least half a dozen parallels from Asia Minor can be pointed to in which rectangular halls of similar propor- tions, displaying similar architecture, have been incor- porated into the design of Imperial bathing complexes. Ephesus leads the list with at least three good examples: the Harbor Bath-Gymnasium, the East Bath-Gymnasium, and the Bath-Gymnasium of Vedius. The Harbor Bath- Gymnasium displays two such halls facing each other across the palaestra. A reconstruction study of the north hall, based on actual evidence of architectural elements found inside the space, shows a scheme composed of superimposed marble columns and aediculae raised on a continuous high podium and intercepted by smaller niches and shrines housing statuary (Figs. 5, 6).4 The major axes of the room are emphasized by apsidal and pedimented recessions; the space is screened off from the palaestra by a monumental row of double-engaged columns com- parable to the Marble Court of Sardis, but, unlike the lat- ter, the Ephesian hall has been shown in the reconstruc- tion drawing with a timber-trussed roof. The same general arrangement can be seen in the East Bath-Gymnasium.5 Here the rectangular hall with the rich aedicular facades is the one on the west side of the courtyard. The closest parallel to Sardis with its marble hall placed on the building's main axis of symmetry is the Bath-Gymnasium of Vedius (Fig. 7).6 Other examples are in Aphrodisias, 1 I am grateful to G.

This space has a continuous podium running along the sides and back walls and may have been covered by a barrel vault. Although the overall design of the Large Baths in Hierapolis is very close to the baths in Aphrodisias with a comparable exedra opening into an intermediary hall (apodyterium), two rectangular halls of the Ephesian/Sardian type face each other across the palaestra proper. The northern one of these, containing wall niches on two stories (but with no trace of any decorative architecture left), appears to be a more suitable space as an Imperial hall. In the Caracallan Baths in Ankyra, the meager evidence of foundations and a few courses preserved above ground attests to the presence of rectangular halls with colonnaded facades on the north and the south sides of the colossal palaestra.

It opens into the barrel-vaulted ambulatory along most of its width between two square piers. Although this space lacks the sumptuous columnar architecture typical of the "marble halls" and is located inside the bath block instead of the palaestra, in view of its size, proportions, and unique situation, the possibility of an "internalized Kaisersaal" may not be such a farfetched one. An internal hall of honorific nature can be found in the Faustina Baths in Miletus and probably in the Roman baths in Argos. In Miletus, this is the space identified as a museion located at the north end of the long apodyterium; a spacious apse which contained the statues of Apollo and the Muses terminates the room.

Let us begin by considering evidence of a tangible nature such as archaeological and epigraphical data, architectural and ideological parallels, and then proceed into the enticing but dangerous realm of vaguely established, secondary meanings and symbolisms.

Rosenbaum and the Warburg Institute, London) Julia Domna as Mater Castrorum,12 and to the Roman Senate and the People.13 Can this be taken as sufficiently clear evidence to declare that the Court was used as a special space dedicated to the observance of the Imperial Cult? Regardless of the form or function of a building, dedications of the parts or the whole of it to the emperor and his family jointly with the gods of the state were a com- mon occurrence.14 In Ceramus, Asia Minor, an aleipterion (an anointing room for athletes, part of a gymnasium or a bath) is dedicated by the agoranomoi of the city "to Trajan, the Gods of Ceramus, and the People."15 Sometimes the structure may not even be a building proper to merit Imperial dedications; a gate, a fountain, or some other public monument could easily qualify. As A. D. Nock points out, these are simply dedicatory inscrip- tions demonstrating love and respect for the emperor; honorific and political in nature, they are not necessarily intended to associate the structure with his cult or worship.16 Yet inscriptions suggesting a more direct line of linkage between the baths and the Imperial Cult do exist; in Side, a dedication to Tiberius Magnus, who was a priest of the Imperial Cult and the goddess Roma, was found inside the Agora Baths (now the Museum).17 Archaeological and iconographical considerations supported by a number of epigraphical sources lead to the conclusion that the building of the palaestra of the East Bath-Gymnasium in Ephesus, including the hall on the west (the candidate for the cult exedra), was undertaken by the prominent citizen and Sophist Flavius Damianus, who might have dedicated the work to Septimius Severus.18 The statue of Damianus, which was displayed in the hall, showed him as a priest of the Imperial Cult (Figs. 9, 10). He wears a full toga and a wreath crown with twelve small busts representing the 12 It is interesting that the Imperial inscription from the Marble Court of Sardis honors Julia Domna as Mater Castrorum ("Mother of Camps"), a title often conferred on the deified empress in the context of the Imperial Cult in military camps.

The thirteenth element in the crown represents the ruling emperor as a divus.19 In at least a few cases epigraphical evidence goes beyond the usual allusive content in identifying a specific space with the Imperial Cult. The inscription found in the exedra of the Middle Gymnasium in Pergamon (Room No. 57, with double columns in antis) is a dedication to theoi sebastoi, the "new gods" Augustus and Livia, alongside the traditional ones Hermes and Herakles, indicating that the room was used for joint worship.20 The statues of these deities must originally have been displayed on the seven- meter-long podium in front of the back wall. The architrave inscription of "Hall G" from the Upper Terrace of the same building probably dates from the time of Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus, when the room was rebuilt with double apses and polychrome marble columns and revetment; the inscription honors the god-emperors and, according to D6rpfeld, confirms the practice of the Imperial Cult in this room and hence its identification as a Kaisersaal.21 The use of these halls for cult purposes can also be deduced from the discovery in them of certain objects es- sential to the ritual - namely the altar and the Imperial im- age. An altar of Hadrian was found in the Middle Gym- nasium at Pergamon, but it cannot be placed in a specific architectural context.22 Perhaps the most interesting in- sight about the presence and the somewhat informal use of Imperial altars in baths and gymnasia is offered by a Hadrianic inscription from Magnesia on the Meander in Asia Minor. It appears that certain amenities connected with the public baths were placed under the care and supervision of the Council of Elders (the gerousia). Among various commercial enterprises - such as manag- ing a restaurant and a bakery, selling sausages and pretzels in the baths, furnishing the bathers with fresh towels - the club claims ownership of a small altar which the citizens could rent for a modest fee and use for their sacrifices. Although the nature of the sacrifice is not specified, direct linkage with the Imperial Cult is apparent since the inscription states that the altar was known as the "Hearth of Caesar."23 In Sardis, excavations in the Marble Court produced neither an altar nor an Imperial image, but no such dis- covery should have been expected considering the long history of the room and the successive alterations it under- went.24 But adjacent to it, inside the main apse of the Syn- agogue, a large marble table has been uncovered and reconstructed in situ. The massive legs of the table are decorated with a pair of Imperial eagles in high relief holding thunderbolts in their talons (Fig. 11). The design and decoration fit the general scheme of altar tables (Opfertische) of Greco-Roman origin known from other sites (Fig. 12). Although it has been pointed out that the so-called "Eagle Table" clearly belongs to an earlier Roman context than the Synagogue, the possibility that it may have been the Imperial altar and may have come from the Marble Court - which, after all, supplied a fair amount of the architectural material re-used in the Syn- agogue - should be considered.25 In the Bath-Gymnasium of Vedius, both an altar and a statue of the donor Publius Vedius Antoninus were found inside the marble hall: the altar, in situ, upon a platform for the priest, immediately in front of the central apse; the statue, inside the apse between two tall columns.26 We do 19 Hanfmann, 71, figs. 150a and 150b.

Robert demonstrates that such crowns decorated with the bust of the deified Roman emperor among those of the traditional deities were part of the insignia of the chief priests and priestesses of the Imperial Cult, and that the custom goes back to the Oriental and Hellenistic practice of the Ruler Cult.

It would be logical to expect that the base carried an image of the emperor and originally belonged to the Marble Court. But it is difficult to assign it a particular position inside that space, or to declare that it carried the Imperial image which would have corresponded, visually, to the dedicatory inscription of the architrave. One of the objections against the placement of the base inside the main west apse is its comparatively small size in relation to the proportions of the apse. One might suggest that the base and the statue belonged to a smaller niche of the second story, directly above the apse.

The excavators believe that a statue of Pius originally occupied the position of honor inside the apse, or shared it with statues of the goddess and the donor.27 In this establishment, at least, there seems to be highly persuasive evidence pointing to the localization of the Imperial Cult in the so-called Kaisersaal. In view of the overall design, the association of these halls with the Imperial Cult makes sense. In the particular combination of the Roman bath with the Greek gym- nasium typical of Asia Minor, it is demonstrable that the Kaisersaal as an architectural element is the direct con- tinuation of the ephebeum (the main club room, youth room, the exedra) of the Hellenistic gymnasium, bearing the same relationship to the palaestra court as do its Greek counterparts.28 The ephebeum of the fourth-century B.C. Gymnasium in Delphi is a large, rectangular hall prominently located on one side of the palaestra and open- ing into it by a row of columns (Fig. 13). In Delos, Olym- pia, and Miletus the same element is positioned at the cen- ter, opposite the entrance, its axiality emphasized by the pair of smaller rooms flanking it (Fig. 14). Even in the small Lower Gymnasium in Priene, the ephebeum, located off-center on the north side, has a certain architectural dis- tinction with its open facade of double columns in antis.29 Yet no matter how convincing the argument supporting the formal and architectural kinship and continuity be- tween the ephebeum and the Kaisersaal, it is immaterial unless the presumed cult associations of the Roman bath and its Imperial hall can also be shown to have a meaningful continuity with the religious and ideological content of its Hellenistic prototype. The question can be rephrased: Can one ascribe religious and cult functions to the gymnasium in general and find them focused in the ephebeum? The emergence of an institutionalized Cult of the Ruler is primarily a post-Alexandrian phenomenon. Infused with Oriental ideas of divinity and kingship, the suc- cessors of Alexander's vast but short-lived empire recognized the dynastic advantages of encouraging the religiously and politically inspired continuation of the cult gill gin:~bLY~i;irYIMI . ?~- r S, iiiiM i .......? i ir1222n ti!!t -----IIhlP ~~ ~I - 11 The "Eagle Table" (Altar of the Imperial Cult?), the Bath- Gymnasium Complex and the Synagogue, Sardis.

It is not surprising that by the late Hellenistic era the gymnasium had established itself as one of the accepted locations for the worship of the principal royal families - the Ptolemies, the Seleucids, and the Attalids.32 Numerous inscriptions, dating from the third century B.C. onwards, record diverse forms of cult activity in or associated with gymnasia. These include the organization of religious ceremonies, athletic games, and festivals celebrating the birthdays or inauguration anniversaries of the rulers, the arrangements for sacrifices or provisions connected with sacrifices on such occasions, and the 27 Keil, JOAI, xxv, 1929, Beiblatt, 29f. 28 In his description of the Greek palaestra, Vitruvius specifies the ephebeum as, "the young men's hall in the middle; this is a very spacious recess (exedra) with seats in it, and it should be one third longer than it is broad" (v. 11. 2). 29 Delorme, pl. vi, 11, 12 (Delphi); pl. xv, 28 ("Palaestra of the Lake," Delos); pl. xix, 36 ("The Gymnasium," Delos); pl. xii, 21 (Olympia); pl. xvin, 34 (Miletus); pl. xxx, 49 (Priene). 30 Nock, 134-157, esp. 143-44; 213-14.

By the early first century A.D. some of the dynastic cults in the gymnasia were being replaced by the Cult of Roma. The Imperial Cult had been foreshadowed by the hero and ruler cults of the Greek east and it developed slowly and steadily during the two formative centuries before the Em- pire. The admission of the Cult of Roma into a religious and civic context can be construed only as an important intermediate step in the process of admitting the Cult of the Roman Emperor there.3" As early as the second cen- tury B.C. the goddess Roma had appeared in thematic ac- companiment to the Hellenistic sovereign in the dedication of a temple in Smyrna, no doubt as a symbolic proclama- tion of the city's good will and respect for its benefac- tors.36 Later, the presence of the goddess provided the proper religious and mythical aura and made the bestowal of divine honors upon a number of Republican governors and generals stationed in the East easier.37 The sharing of divine favors with Roma, or with some other traditional god or goddess, or the Senate, was indeed a widely used formula during the Augustan and early Imperial era, preparing the conceptual basis for the full acceptance of the Cult of the Emperor in the West.38 It would seem logical to think that sometime during this period the cult moved into the gymnasium alongside, or independent of the Cult of Roma, replacing its Hellenistic forerunner, which had already lost much of its meaning in a world in- creasingly dominated by a single Roman authority. Moreover, quite apart from the idea that the development 33 At Apamea on the Meander, the cult statues of King Eumenes II (ruled 197-160 B.c.) and his son Attalos III (ruled 138-33 B.C.) were installed in the gymnasium; a statue of Alexander the Great was in the gymnasium at Bargylia and was renewed by the city as late as the early 3rd century A.D. Orientis Graeci Inscriptiones Selectae, ed. W. Dittenberger, I, 1903, No. 3. At Thyatira, a sacrifice to the Attalids is recorded (ca. 133 B.c.); at Il- ion, annual and monthly rites in honor of King Seleucos were celebrated by a special meeting of the ephebes and the neoi; in Chios, a decree men- tions the distribution of oil and perfume by the gymnasiarch (possibly during the annual sacrificial ceremony to the Royal Cult).

Robert, Etudes anatoliennes, Paris, 1937, 175-76, 239. 34 This was undoubtedly the case in Ephesus, as revealed by an inscrip- tion from the gymnasium in which the name of Eumenes II is given in connection with those of Hercules (and Hermes).

Tiberius is referred to as a god (theos) and ac- quires a place among the traditional gods worshipped there.40 There is, however, no indication that the ephebeum was the chosen locale for the concentration of the Ruler Cult in the Hellenistic gymnasium. In fact the observation of the Ruler Cult does not seem to have been fixed in any par- ticular place in the layout of the palaestra. This might be explained partially by the traditional aura of sanctity dif- fused throughout the whole of the space within the walls of the institution, so that even the accommodations for the familiar gods consisted generally of simple, outdoor altars, rustic shrines, and images - and partially by the enor- mous flexibility possible in the design of the Greek gym- nasium. An inscription from Pharbaithos, Egypt, informs us that a special "chapel" was constructed where a throne symbolizing the power of Ptolemy VII (ruled 145-44 B.c.) and his mother Cleopatra II was placed.41 In Pergamon, the center for the Hellenistic cult in the gymnasium ap- pears to have been the exedra (Hall "H") in the north side of the Upper Terrace, where a semicircular base for the statues of the Attalid family was placed before a shallow niche cut into the thickness of the wall. In the Middle Gymnasium, the Doric Exedra (Room No. 57), in which the base dedicated to theoi sebastoi (Augustus and Livia) was found, is a more probable candidate for the cult center. 42 In most of the Hellenistic palaestrae whose plans are known to us, there are a number of exedra-like spaces - spaces with niches, apses, or recesses - that can answer to the simple definition of a cult chapel and serve as viable candidates.43 Small wonder that it was the Romans who, with their penchant for organizing space around ritual, brought an architectural definition (an "Imperial inter- pretation," one might say) to the hitherto vaguely con- ceived cult chapel, and assigned it a particular position within the flexible layout of palaestral design. It also seems logical that they should have recognized the ephebeum, the most prominent room of the traditional palaestra (though ordinarily not a cult room), as the ap- propriate candidate for the cult function.44 Two important buildings of the quadriporticus type, 39 A considerable amount of controversy exists concerning the religious value of the Imperial Cult and the cult ritual, which might bias considera- tion of the choice and the use of a space designated for it. While Nock. and Nilsson - and to a certain extent D. Fishwick - take a conservative stand on the issue, considering the cult and its ritual a politically motivated "empty shell," or a formal act of homage rather than worship, E. Will, H. W. Pleket, and above all L. Robert maintain that despite the obvious political nature of the cult, and despite the absence of ex votos, the cult and its mysteries were based on traditional models, and were quite genuine in emotional and religious content. A sensible attitude to the problem is represented by G. Bowersock who suggests that we con- sider the issue separately, depending on which group or class of the an- cient society is in consideration. According to Bowersock, there was no question of any confusion between a real god (deus = theos) and a deified emperor (divus) as far as the educated 'lite were concerned. They took the cult for granted as a form of extravagant compliment based on the philosophical and sophisticated notion of assimilating divinity through virtue; it is only after the shocking abuse of the institution by the last 2nd century emperors Commodus and Elagabalus that the opin- ion of the intelligentsia changed and they were moved sufficiently to admonish and reject the cult. No small part of the modern controversy may be attributed to a certain reluctance of the Western mind to accept the possibility of a subtle and comfortable coexistence of a ritualistic and emotional form of hero worship with an independent concept of true religion and gods, or of homage and worship. One might suggest a modern analogy in the case of the deep and sincere homage paid in Turkey to K. Atatiirk, the founder of the modern state, whose cult has developed in a well-organized ritual framework, none of which, however, violates the precepts of faith and the conventional religion, an essentially jealous and monotheistic one at that.

To this one might add the room with the double columns in antis on the northeast side of the gymnasium of Delphi (Fig. 13), and the small recess (exedra) immediately north of the entrance in the Lower Gymnasium of Priene.

The ephebeum, or its equivalent in the context of the Roman bath-gymnasium complexes, could have been any of the rooms (exedrae) opening into the palaestra, and it would have been hardly distinguishable from its neighbors except in cases where it assumed a more significant, civic function as a public lecture hall or meeting room, such as the "Sophists' Hall" in the East bath-gymnasium of Ephesus or the semicir- cular auditorium of the Upper Gymnasium in Pergamon.

The earlier of the two, the Temenos for the Ruler Cult in Pergamon, is of the late third century B.C.; the other is the Heroon in Calydon, placed somewhere in the latter half of the second century B.C.45 Both of these buildings are rectangular enclosures with a peristyle in the middle and rooms on two or more sides (Figs. 15-17). In both, one of the sides in emphasized by an axially placed cult-room (exedra) of square proportions, extending out of the main body of the structure but preceded by a forehall of wider frontage. In Pergamon, this frontal hall opens directly into the courtyard through an Ionic colonnade which replaces the fourth side of the peristyle; in Calydon two Ionic columns in antis connect the same space with the ambulatory of the Doric peristyle. The investigators, E. Boehringer for Pergamon and E. Dygvve for Calydon, concur in isolating the Greek gym- nasium of the East as the primary source of inspiration for this type.46 In the Temenos at Pergamon, a niche at the back wall of the cult chamber is all that can be properly linked with the cult; no altar or statue-base has been found. In Calydon, two dedicatory inscriptions allude to Leon, the deified, an- cestral hero of the family, as the New Herakles, and in ad- dition to this the evidence for cult use is unequivocal:47 a vaulted crypt directly under the cult chamber establishes the funerary characteristics of hero worship; and the room on the northwest corner, next to the forehall, has been firm- ly identified as the cult dining room (triclinium) on the basis of archaeological finds. In Pergamon, the rooms on the southwest side are believed to have been used for similar purposes.48 A set of medallions representing gods and the mythical heroes of the city decorates the walls of the forehall in Calydon; a continuous podium which once supported ancestral statuary runs along the back wall of the cult chamber (Fig. 18).49 In front of this podium was placed a dark marble altar-table ornamented with acanthus scrolls and lion heads.50 The similarity of this altar to the "Eagle Table" of the Sardis Synagogue has already been mentioned (see note 25). In the light of inscriptions found in Pergamon, Teos, and Miletus which inform us of the existence of sanctuaries and cult centers for Attalus I (269-197 B.C.) and his son Eumenes II (died 159 B.c.), the likelihood that the Pergamene building was a public institution for the Cult of the Attalid dynasty becomes very strong. The same inscriptions reveal that these monarchs were deified as theoi after death and were worshipped and honored at a number of special feasts and festivals. Religious conser- vatism and political concerns may have been responsible for the persistence of the cults under Roman rule in Asia Minor. Consequently, the continuation of the sacred func- tions of the Pergamene Temenos during this period would have been by far the most normal thing; the Cult of the Roman Governor and later that of the Emperor must have simply replaced the Cult of the Hellenistic Sovereign. The architecture, too, appears to have responded promptly to the taste of the new masters and of the new age for luxury and monumentality: the forehall was entirely refurbished in marble, and the cult chamber itself was raised above the rest of the structure as a tall, tower-like pavilion.51 Along with the gymnasium proper, these Hellenistic cult buildings52 may be seen to have a combined and con- tinuing influence not only on the Kaisersile of the bath- 45 Boehringer, 60f. Dygvve, 310f. 46 Boehringer, especially, is very careful to downplay any outside in- fluence for the Temenos in Pergamon in favor of the well-known and readily available models from the Hellenistic repertory of Asia Minor, such as the Hellenistic Gymnasium (of Eudemos? ca. 80 B.c.) in Miletus or the famed Bouleterion of the same city. Less well known, but of par- ticular interest, is the Prytaneion in Magnesia on the Meander introduced by Dygvve. The plan of this building, with its large peristyle courtyard and prominent, axially placed exedra, strikes one with assuring familiarity. This is hardly surprising when we consider the ideological and formal content of a prytaneion as an institution of state containing the altar and the sacred hearth of Hestia, and one which straddles the realm between a house and a cult center.

Miller, The Prytaneion, Berkeley, 1978, 112-15, figs. 12, 34. 47 Dygvve, 353-55, 387. 48 The agonistic character exhibited in the design and dedications of many heroa and temenoi - i.e., the provision for special rooms for feasts and festivals, the inclusion of literary, musical, and athletic contests among their primary activities - further strengthens the connection with the traditional gymnasium. Of singular interest is the Temenos of An- tigonos Gonotas at Knidos, which included not only the ordinary cultic and gymnastic facilities such as the cult chamber (e6Kcb'), altar (6opirl), running tracks (&amp;6p'oC) and palaestra, but also baths (Goovrpa): Epigrammata Graeca ex lapidibus conclecta, ed.

The architecture of these temenoi displays a flexible but recognizable pattern: an independent, walled-in enclosure containing an informal and sparse grouping of various modestly scaled structures, rooms, porticoes, and gardens. Some even included certain gymnastic facilities such as running tracks. Statuary, of religious and iconographical significance, appears to have played an important part in the decoration of many. Apart from the Temenos of Antigonos Gonotas in Knidos, which has already been men- tioned in connection with its elaborate layout and agonistic functions (see n. 48), the best known and studied of these sanctuaries is the Heroon in Golbashi-Trysa, in Lycia, whose sculptured reliefs are among the most important productions of late Classical art from Asia Minor. Of par- ticular interest is the layout described for a Heroon in Myra, which in- cludes, in addition to the cult chamber set in an enclosed garden, two separate, smaller structures in which the caretakers lived. The existence of other cult temenoi in the following cities can be established on the basis of epigraphical evidence: Smyrna, Halicarnassus, Hierapolis, Nicomedia, and Pessinus. O. Benndorf and G.

Judged by the frequency of references to these institutions, they must have been among the regular fixtures of the Classical city, although, surprisingly, very few actual buildings have been found.53 The common definition of a sebasteion is a -temple dedicated to the Cult of the Roman Emperor.54 But the precise architectural identity of the institution is harder to determine. No doubt the conventional image of a single, 53 The word Kaisareion was used for the first time, ca. A.D. 40, by Philo of Alexandria in reference to the famed establishment in the same city. He also made it clear that many other cities already had kaisareia (De Legatione ad Gaium xxii. 150-51). For a list of epigraphical references for sebasteion/kaisareion/caesareum, see Ward-Perkins and Ballance, 177-78.

Yet there is a difference - sometimes a very vague one - between this type of sanctuary and one whose porticoed courtyard is occupied by rows of rooms, of which one is singled out and emphasized as the cult chapel, or one that even includes a small, freestanding naiskos as the official "place" for the Imperial godhead. The latter - the "porticus type" - clearly relates directly to the planning of the Hellenistic temenos or gymnasium, and it must have been by far the more common type on ac- count of its simplicity and familiarity. Perhaps a deter- mination of the architectural identity of the sebasteion/ kaisareion should be totally flexible, as there seems to be a wide variety of possible interpretations even for the porticus type alone, since, in J. B. Ward-Perkins's words, "... in antiquity, as today, architectural terminology and architectural form were independent though closely related variables, it would be rash to assume that all of them were derived from the same models." 55 Thanks to an excellent study by E. Sj6qvist, an in- dependent group of sebasteia or kaisareia can be seen to offer a more concrete view of another version of the porticus type, serving as centers for the Imperial Cult.56 The earliest and the best known of the structures was in Alexandria, established in 48 B.C. in honor of Julius Caesar (Caesar Epibaterius = disembarking) containing a temple dedicated to him. The premises were reorganized under Augustus as a sebasteion, and may have become one of the first official centers for the worship of a Roman emperor. Although not more than a corner of the precinct wall had been uncovered in 1874, a fortuitously preserved descrip- tion by Philo of Alexandria (written ca. A.D. 40) leaves no doubt about the general architectural layout and the character of the foundation as a quadriporticus building: "... it is a very large enclosure adorned with porticoes, libraries, club rooms, gardens, propylaea, terraces, and courtyards open to the sky.'"57 In searching for the ideological and architectural roots for Caesar's kaisareion, Sj6qvist traces the genealogy of this type of building in the Hellenistic repertory of Pharaonic architecture in Egypt, the center for the Ptolemaic ruler cult, and he concludes that a major cult building in Alexandria, now no longer existing or traceable, must have served as the model.58 Two other roughly contemporary kaisareia come from Antioch-on-the-Orontes and Cyrene. The former, es- tablished by Caesar himself in 47 B.C., is known through a rather imprecise description by Malalas.59 After some ad- justments of wording and terminology are taken into ac- count, it appears also to have been a courtyard type of building with four enclosing porticoes, one of which con- tained a centrally positioned apse originally housing the statues of Caesar and Roma. The structure was restored by Valens in A.D. 371, and his image took the place of honor in the apse. The other is a substantially well-preserved Augustan establishment in Cyrene, securely identified as the Caesareum by a building inscription. It was excavated and partially reconstructed by Italian archaeologists in the 1920's.60 Following from this, and from the findings of a survey undertaken in 1956-58 by a British team, J. B. Ward-Perkins's study and publication of the building in relation to the kaisareion type and its broader meaning in the development of Roman architecture makes a worthy sequel to Sj6qvist's earlier work on the subject.61 Follow- ing the models of Alexandria and Antioch, the Caesareum at Cyrene displays the quadriporticus arrangement; the propylaea on the south and west sides of the tall enclosure wall and the small, freestanding temple in the middle of the open space impart a sense of loose axiality. The entire wing of the complex was rebuilt under Hadrian as a three- aisled basilica terminating in a large apse (Fig. 19). What seems significant, and not touched upon by either Sj6qvist or Ward-Perkins, is the fact that regardless of the possible Western origins for the particular planning type manifested in Cyrene (with a basilica occupying one whole wing of the quadriporticus), the broader view of the kaisareion as a "large enclosure adorned with porticoes, libraries, club rooms, gardens, propylaea, terraces and courtyards open to the sky" compares well with the kind of layout adopted as early as the fourth century B.C. for the palaestra of the typical Greek gymnasium. This basic palaestral and "porticoed" type of the Eastern Mediterra- nean is probably the underlying generic source for the 55 Ward-Perkins and Ballance, 178. A recent salvage operation in Bubon, Lycia, may have brought to light a sebasteion originally dedicated to Nero but maintained as a cult center late into the 3rd century A.D. A small, rectangular chamber, which is only partially excavated, housed an impressive array of Imperial statuary, as attested by their inscribed bases, and must have been a part of a larger architectural complex - possibly a walled, porticoed enclosure.

Clearly, the need and the desire to provide a proper place for the Ruler and Dynastic Cults of the Hellenistic Age seems to have found expression in two separate but interrelated architec- tural settings: a wholly independent and specialized form of cult building (kaisareia, private and public temenoi and heroa), and the familiar civic gymnasium which absorbed the new function within its flexible form and content - neither of these types necessarily exclusive of the other. The continuation of the tradition under the Roman Em- pire, while prompting the foundation of sebasteia/ kaisareia on a wider geographical and architectural basis, appears to have provided the momentum for the reloca- tion of the Emperor Cult in the bath-gymnasium complex (Figs. 20, 21).63 It may be that the main source of influence for a num- ber of Julio-Claudian and Flavian porticus buildings in Rome, like the Forum of Caesar, Saepta Julia, Porticus Divorum, and even the Forum Pacis (Fig. 22), was in the Kaisareion in Alexandria and other Ptolemaic structures of the same type, which Sj6qvist illustrates - a derivation that could be explained by certain historical links like Caesar's long stay in the same city and his familiarity with its architecture.64 But it should be remembered that these same Ptolemaic sources themselves were informed by an older and more diffuse architectural tradition based on ax- iality and symmetry which was as current in the East as it was in the West.65 In the case of the bath-gymnasium complexes of Asia Minor, I have tried to show that the ul- timate prototype for the particular design formula applied in the arrangement of the Kaisersaal vis-a-vis the palaestra comes from the Hellenistic gymnasium,66 and to a lesser extent from the independent temenos/heroon building. Nonetheless, the architecture of a prestigious and famed establishment like the Kaisareion of Alexandria and its possible derivatives in the capital could favorably in- fluence the general acceptance of the palaestra of the Roman bath-gymnasium as the right sort of setting for the Imperial Cult and assist in creating an effective iconography of design and decoration.67 Indeed, the recognition of this iconography in its entirety or in its parts and motifs and a consideration of its symbolism 62 Ward-Perkins sees the planning of the Caesareum at Cyrene as representative of a particular architectural tradition whose sources are to be found in the "familiar forum-basilica complex of the Western provinces," whereas in the East, "the stoa remains the normal ... coun- terpart of the basilica." Ward-Perkins and Ballance, 182f. 63 The diffused and continuing influence of these temenoi may be extend- ed to cover not only the Kaisersiile of the bath-gymnasium complexes but even a number of independent porticus buildings in Asia Minor whose use and purpose have always been somewhat difficult to pin down. Among the more prominent of these which appear to have created new and diverse contexts for the presentation of the Imperial Cult are the Palaestra of Cornutus in Perge and the so-called "Building M" in Side. The dedication of the former to Claudius is confirmed by an inscription (a private "Claudianum"?). The latter, an Antonine establishment iden- tified recently as the state agora ("Building M") by A. M. Mansel, is a large rectangular enclosure with a row of three halls on the east side (Figs. 20, 21). The central hall, larger than the rest, opens to the eastern colonnade of the peristyle through a row of Corinthian columns. The arrangement, complete with identical flanking units (libraries?) is direct- ly comparable to the exedra/palaestra combinations of contemporary bath-gymnasium complexes. The analogy is further supported by the architecture of the central hall which displays an ornate build-up of aedicular facades in two stories, raised over the marble floor by a podium. Over the podium, and inside the first- and second-story niches of the back walls stood an extremely rich array of over-lifesize statues of deities and athletes. The cuirassed male figure which occupied the middle niche has been tentatively identified as an emperor, possibly Antoninus Pius. Mansel is unequivocal in calling the hall a Kaisersaal (Imperator Salonu) and finds its occurrence within the context of a state agora quite an ap- propriate one. For the Palaestra of Cornutus in Perge, see K. G. Lanckoronski, Stiidte Pamphyliens und Pisidiens, I, Vienna, 1890, 43-44, figs. 30-32; G. Bean, Turkey's Southern Shore, New York, 1968, 56.

Mansel, Side, Ankara, 1978, 169-186, figs. 184- 204. 64 Of these, the Porticus Divorum in Campus Martius, built for the worship of his deified Flavian predecessors by Domitian, was definitely a center for the Imperial Cult and displays a general resemblance to the Alexandrian Kaisareion.

Gjerstad's study of the planning of Roman Im- perial fora and acknowledges his ideas about "the mixed Hellenistic and remote Oriental origins" for the characteristic axiality and frontality of these Italian schemes. However, he disagrees with Gjerstad's conclusions that Anatolia was the intermediary in the process of this transition, but would rather have "the point of contact where the creative process was brought to focus [be] Ptolemaic Egypt and particularly, Alexandria."

Also compare the "State Agora/Kaisersaal" in Side (Fig. 20). Both schemes represent peristyle arrangements in which one side is emphasized by a centrally located, prominent rectangular hall flanked by identical, square units. In both, the central hall opens into the large peristyle courtyard through a colonnaded front and contains an apse for the cult image terminating the main axis of the composition. The Forum Pacis, as a distinguished and much admired establishment in the capital, was in a position to act as an effective and potent model in cutting across the natural lines of development in Asia Minor, but also, ironically, in fortifying some of the deeply rooted Italian tendencies of the land for axial arrangements. The fact that it was a building very much in the tradition of the Hellenistic East only illustrates the complexity of the reciprocal network of ideas and influences operating under the Em- pire and should not confuse the issue: this is a case where it may be more important to find the immediate and most prestigious sources rather than the ultimate ones.</page><page sequence="14">20 THE ART BULLETIN MARCH 1982 VOLUME LXIV NUMBER 1 0 a i m0.1 19 The Caesareum, Cyrene.

Restored perspective study (from Boethius and Ward-Perkins, fig. 92) could be instrumental in our understanding of the purpose and meaning of Imperial halls.68 In the Marble Court of Sardis two independent but in- terrelated schemes can be identified: first, a two-storied central group with a pediment broken by an arch and en- veloping a semidomed apse; second, extending out from this center, an alternating arrangement of columnar aediculae, raised on a continuous podium (Figs. 1, 2, 23). The arched pediment (to be termed a "Syrian Gable" or "arcuated lintel" if not topped by a pediment) is one of the most remarkable and popular creations of the ancient world, combining in a single motif the entire range of royal and celestial associations invested in the pediment, the arch, and the semidome, and a pair of flanking columns.69 The apse is the unique and proper place for the image of the emperor and establishes his position in the symmetrical center of the architectural composition, and, 68 I believe that the objectives and limitations of any study that employs the investigation of symbolism as a method - as the following one at- tempts to do - will gain clarity and definition by emphasizing that the choice of a particular iconographical motif, used singly or in combination with others, cannot be conceived independent of architectural, structural, and historical considerations. R. Krautheimer's illuminating views on the subject, brought forth by his discussion of medieval plans, may be equally valid for this study: "... it would certainly be a mistake to assume that symbolical interpretations ... were always the preponderant reason for giving a structure a certain shape. ... The process is of a much more intricate nature; probably the relation between pattern and symbolical meaning could be better described as being determined by a network of half-distinct connotations. Rather than being the starting point or else a post festum interpretation, the symbolic significance is something that merely accompanied the particular form which was chosen for the struc- ture. It accompanied it as a more or less uncertain connotation which was only dimly visible and whose specific interpretation was not necessarily agreed upon." R. Krautheimer, "Introduction to an 'Iconography of Mediaeval Architecture,"' Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes, v, 1942, 9.</page><page sequence="15">KAISERSALE IN IMPERIAL ROME 21 by extension, in the center of the Roman world and the universe.70 The fastigium carried by four spirally fluted columns suggests a temple front and implies the basis for the emperor's divine and worldly powers.71 Altogether, the motif creates a fitting regal and sacred frame, a gable of glorification, or a kind of heavenly baldachin, for the ruler. The symbolic linkage of the throne and the baldachin with the idea of divine rulership goes back to an iconographical convention current in Hellenistic and Oriental courts, but the motif gains increasing popularity under the Romans and serves with equal ease for Christian purposes. Representations of emperors and gods or their images in similar enframements as divine objects of adora- tion and worship are not uncommon in Roman usage, as exemplified by the coin of Domitian showing dominus et deus enthroned inside a pedimented shrine; and the coins of Antoninus Pius depicting a statue of the emperor under an arched canopy; and those which portray Commodus as the double-faced Janus (Figs. 24a,b,c, 25).72 Perhaps the most effective and cogent demonstration of the same theme in a full architectural setting comes from the magnificently painted chamber for the Imperial Cult in the Temple of Ammon in Luxor. The chamber was com- pletely redesigned during the Tetrarchy to include a semidomed apse in the center of the main south wall framed by a pair of columns which most probably carried an arcuated lintel (Fig. 26). The center of focus inside the apse is the painting of the four standing and frontally posed tetrarchs with divine attributes. They wear long, purple cloaks in the Greek style (pallium) and have yellow haloes around their heads. The center-left figure (on the -7 7 A Xjth 23 The Marble Court, Sardis. View toward southwest with head-capitals (photo: Sardis Archaeological Exploration) right with respect to the apse) is identified as Diocletian, and holds a long sceptre in his extended right hand and a globe (urbs) in his left. Above, the Imperial eagle holds a wreath and his outstretched wings majestically fill the semidome. The monumental paintings that once entirely covered the walls of the room depicted a military proces- sion of soldiers and horses along the east and possibly the west walls; on the wall facing the entrance, on both sides of the apse, are depicted tiers of standing dignitaries clad in magnificently embroidered togas and carrying religious objects and signs. The iconographical theme represented is identified as the adventus, possibly related to Diocletian's 69 No small part of the success and popularity of the motif should be at- tributed to the richness of its own structural and graphic potential: the middle bay, crowned by an arch, is singled out and emphasized; the arch, which breaks into the pedimented area, provides a natural enframement and greater "headroom" for the anthropomorphic image and allows a more monumental representation. Developed in depth with a semidome or as a freestanding pavilion with a dome behind the pediment, it is transformed into a baldachin. See nn. 72 and 75.

B. Smith's observation that Imperial adventus and Hellenistic epiphany had much in common with the Roman triumph, as "all were ceremonies of welcome whose rites of deification gave celestial content to the ar- cuated portal."74 Similarly, the arched-pediment motif was intimately connected with the idea of triumph and Im- perial presence, undoubtedly equating the two concepts.75 Interestingly, its earliest monumental architectural ap- plication is in the context of a triumphal arch: the short sides of the Julio-Claudian arch in Orange are built up as a pair of Syrian pediments in high relief, carried by four tall engaged columns.76 Some 250 years later, in Diocletian's 73 The use of the room as a "temple" for the Imperial Cult was first suggested by Monneret de Villard, who deserves the lion's share of the credit for the correct identification of the paintings as Roman Imperial rather than Early Christian. Recently, the study of the room's architec- ture and the iconography of the paintings was developed in two suc- cessive articles by J. G. Deckers, in 1973 and 1979, and in one of 1973 by I. Kalavrezou-Maxeiner, who had defended the thesis that the room could have functioned as an audience hall for Diocletian rather than as a cult center. Although the iconographical themes and conventions that are appropriate for one would be quite acceptable for the other, Decker's latest study benefits from the results of considerable fieldwork under- taken in 1977 (including the discovery of new fragments of the paintings), and it establishes a firm ground for the recognition of the chamber as a space dedicated to the Imperial Cult.

In the West, the motif is frequently em- ployed in the Second and Fourth Pompeian styles. But the full architec- tural popularity of the Syrian pediment belongs to the Antonine and Severan eras. The form could well have been born out of simple struc- tural expedience: the convenience of spanning a substantially wider cen- ter bay by the use of an arch. Precisely when it came to be invested with symbolic meaning is hard to answer. For the long and interesting history of this motif and its variations, see D. F.

Detail drawing (from Smith, fig. 74) emerge before the eyes of a bedazzled and adoring audience (Fig. 27).77 In the Madrid missorium, Theodosius is enthroned under a classically inspired "glorification gable"78 which may have been modeled after the facade of the Temple of Deified Hadrian in Ephesus (Fig. 28).79 An even higher order of associations is suggested by the use of comparable motifs in the late fourth- (or fifth-?) cen- tury mosaic decorations of the dome of St. George (for- merly the Mausoleum of Galerius?) in Thessaloniki (Fig. 29). A broken and arched pediment carried by a pair of spirally fluted columns in two stories enframes an empty throne (or an altar); two saints in white garments stand in awe and attention on either side; above, the shimmering undulations of mosaic aediculae encircle the vast dome in an endless girdle of heavenly abodes.80 Extending out from the pedimented group in the center, the facade of the Marble Court also unfolds in a mul- tilayered range of aediculae projecting and receding in rhythmic sequence: the profusion of columns, capitals, entablatures; the rich layering of carved ornament; the polychromatic splendor of costly marbles and statuary - all this might be thought of as the proper imagery for magnificent celestial, or at any rate royal, residences (Figs. 1, 2, 23). An arrangement composed of similar elements is directly related to kingly surroundings in the well-known passage in Vitruvius describing the proper stage scenery for tragedy: "Tragic scenes are delineated with columns, pediments, statues, and other objects suited to kings ..." (Book v. 6, 9). The faqade compositions of typical Kaisersiile, indeed, closely approximate the scaenae frons arrangement of the Roman theater.

Even when the stage served as an immediate source of in- spiration and a practical model, the deeper link with the palace image might have been maintained. Some of the earliest representations of aedicular faqades belong to Second and Fourth Style Pompeian paintings. Most scholars agree that such scenery in paintings is either directly derived from the idea and conventions of the aula regia for Hellenistic monarchs, as with the scene from the House of Apollo in Pompeii (vi.7,23) showing Apollo as a divine prince enthroned before the porta regia (Fig. 30), or that the depicted scenery originates in actual stage representations, as with the so-called House of the Gladiators (also known as the House of the Warrior, 1.23,25) and another unnamed house from Pompeii (viii. 2,23) which ultimately hark back to palace sources (Fig. 31).81 Where could palaces be found that would be possi- ble candidates as these sources? In view of the close historical and geographic ties of the Late Republic with Egypt, Alexandria is traditionally singled out as the logical choice. The sophisticated Ptolemaic capital could provide the formal and iconographic models for the needs and aspirations of the new, rising power in the West. Yet archaeology so far has not been able to come up with any real remains from Alex- andria or from any other center of the Hellenistic world like Pergamon or Antioch which bear out the alleged relationship between the architecture of the Roman scaenae frons and the famed palaces.82 These claims are, indeed, largely based on, and partially satisfied by, descriptions and secondary references found in ancient sources.83 Perhaps the most useful for the purposes of this inquiry are the famous passages from the Deip- nosophistae of Athenaeus (who lived ca. A.D. 200) describing a festival pavilion (or a banquet hall) built by Ptolemy II (Philadelphos, ruled 285-246 B.C.) and a pleasure boat belonging to Ptolemy IV (Philopator, ruled 221-205 B.C.)84 The accounts of these surroundings, with their slender, palm-shaped columns of wood and ivory, gilded capitals and architraves, red canopied roofs, purple hangings, and decorative statues, and even freestanding tholoi, recreate, in a generalized way, the familiar elements of Pompeian paintings, though they might not have been grouped quite in the same way (Fig. 32). In fact, there is even a brief and solitary direct reference to stage architec- ture in the description of Philopator's river boat, in which the facade of a colonnaded upper-deck vestibule is com- pared to a proskenion with a roof over it.85 Nevertheless, the descriptions are long, detailed, and somewhat rhetorical accounts mainly aimed at creating a sense of the 81 For palace symbolism in the design of Roman scaenae frons and Pom- peian paintings, see Smith, 120-22, fig. 113.

Bieber thinks that "theater scenes" such as the one from the "House of the Gladiators" (1.23.25) showing mime, pantomime, and athletes correspond to real per- formances in the contemporary theaters of Pompeii, Herculaneum, and Rome. M. Bieber, A History of the Greek and Roman Theater (repr. of 1939 ed.), Princeton, 1961, 231-32, figs. 774-78. 82 Excavations on the acropolis of Pergamon have shown that the palaces of the Hellenistic monarchs were essentially complexes of peristyle struc- tures relatively modest in size despite their impressive location. G. Kawerau and T. Wiegand, Die Paliiste der Hochburg (Altertiumer von Pergamon, v.1), Berlin, 1930. R. Martin, L'Urbanisme dans la Grace antique, Paris, 1956, 127, 235-36, fig. 47, pl. ix. Hanfmann, 29. In An- tioch on the Orontes we have no documentation of a palace earlier than the one built by Q. Marcius Rex, the Roman governor of Cilicia, in con- nection with his visit to the city in 67 B.C. (Malalas [as in n. 11], 225, 7- 11). Excavations have yielded only the site of the fortified palace and circus established by Diocletian on the Island of the Orontes, which would be a likely location for earlier palaces. G. Downey, Ancient Antioch, Princeton, 1963, 55-56. In Alexandria, archaeology has met with sporadic and limited success. Our knowledge of the Ptolemaic city and its primary monuments is largely based on Strabo's description in Book xvii of his Geography and to a lesser extent on the World History of Diodorus Siculus (wrote ca. 60-30 B.C.), xvII. 52. The information is still much too general to allow a precise architectural picture to emerge. It seems that the palace complex was composed of many independent or semi-independent units and courts spread over an area of extensive parks and gardens - comparable to the Topkapi Palace of the Ottoman Sultans in Istanbul. (See also Polybius, xv. 25-34; Lucan, x. 111-126.) None of this even comes close to suggesting whether the pavilions and the royal halls were articulated by an architecture of aedicular and illusionistic nature. P. M. Fraser, Ptolemaic Alexandria, i, II, III, Oxford, 1972, 3-37, esp. 14-17, n. 145. A. Adriani, Repertorio d'arte dell'Egitto Greco- Romano, Ser. C, Vols. I-II, 50, 226. At least one likely avenue of in- vestigation was indicated by J. B. Ward-Perkins when he brought up the Palazzo delle Colonne in Ptolemais, a late Hellenistic early Imperial struc- ture which makes a highly decorative and imaginative use of aedicular screens, as representative of a sophisticated architectural tradition whose roots may go back to the lost late Hellenistic palaces of Alexandria. Boethius and Ward-Perkins, 462-64. For a more complete study of the building and its connection to Alexandrian architecture: H. Lauter, "Ptolemais in Libyen: Ein Beitrag zur Baukunst Alexandrias," Jahrbuch des Deutschen Archiologischen Instituts, LXXXVI, 1971, 149-178, esp. 167f. 83 Vitruvius's story about Apaturius of Alabanda who had designed and painted the stage decorations for a small theater in Tralles pointedly refers to a scheme composed of bizarre and decorative architectural ele- ments and illusionistic effects of Second and Third Style painting (Book vIi.5.5). This account places Hellenistic Asia Minor and the Eastern Mediterranean in an important position in the early development of these fanciful schemes involving the interplay of architecture and painting; the story is, however, given strictly in the context of actual stage design and not palaces. Also see Lauter (as in n. 82), 172f. 84Athenaeus, Deipnosophistae, v. 196A, 204E, 207C. Athenaeus's source for these descriptions is Callixeinus of Rhodes who lived in the 2nd century B.c. and wrote a book on Alexandria. The relevant excerpts are included in J. J.

In confronting the question of the extent to which the stone and marble architecture of Roman scaenae frons can be viewed as a product and extension of Ptolemaic royal halls, one should not overlook the purely architectonic and visual potential of these schemes to undergo an in- dependent development of their own. Without touching on the subject of palace symbolism at all, Margarete Bieber presents a convincing picture of a step-by-step structural and functional evolution of the Roman stage, and con- cludes with unchallengeable good sense that "the Roman materialistic spirit, their love of pomp and luxury, created the splendid display of architectural triumphs of the scaenae frons."86 Indeed, it should be possible to accept the magnificent interiors of the Kaisersaile as settings in which the emperor's symbolic presence through images and inscriptions could recall proper iconographical associations with numerous well-known and easily ac- cessible royal halls and basilicae of the Imperial period even without the need for allusion to the distant authority of Alexandrian palaces.87 The content of the theater itself can be a more fruitful subject to pursue in establishing an iconographical link between the sumptuous colonnaded architecture of the stage and the idea of the Roman emperor - one, at least, that might be less complicated than attempts at art- historical derivations of this design. The presence of an unmistakable link between the Classical theater and Classical religion, particularly with its patron deity Dionysus, has been illustrated by, among various scholars, J. A. Hanson, in his book on Roman theater- temples."s But more to the point for this discussion is the use of the theater for the purposes of dynastic propaganda I! ;ir_ ~-~-~- r u I; Ir~e~a*~"?c? ft~r*~tTS-~~F? j i 9 L;C;.

The interior architecture and marble decoration of these halls, with their undulating, baroque walls articulated by columnar rows, shrines, statue niches, and apsidal recessions, were created expressly for the official use and presentation of an emperor who quite believed himself to be a god, or perceived advantages in presenting himself as one and demanded worship. Whatever the reasons for choosing this architectural setting, it is quite unthinkable that a host of readily recognizable, Imperial and sacred connotations would not have become a permanent part of the symbolism after their use in such an important project. In later years, similar sorts of interiors were found to be appropriate for temples and cult buildings - the Temple of Venus and Roma in Rome or the Temple of Bacchus in Baalbek. For a fine discussion of the imagery and meaning of the apsed halls of the Domus Flavia in the context of the Imperial civilization, see W. L.

One can even go a step further, and suggest the ex- istence of another and more direct channel of association, between the theater and its patron god Dionysus and the Roman emperor as Neo-Dionysus. It is true that the Dionysiac aspect was one of the more common of the divine attributes assumed by Roman emperors (such as Jupiter-Apollo, Apollo-Helius, and Hercules), and it was not cultivated with equal fervor by all emperors.91 There is also no proof of a direct and exclusive link between the Imperial Cult and Dionysus. Nonetheless, there is a cer- tain parallelism of ritual, and, whether a particular em- peror claimed a Dionysiac nature or not, the inclusion and the practice of the cult in an environment where the God of the Stage could implicitly "feel at home" might not be entirely without meaning.92 Like the Ruler Cult itself, the origins and iconography of the Neo-Dionysus can be traced back to Egypt as a special development of the Alexander legend worked out for the benefit of the Ptolemaic court.93 Plutarch tells us that: "... when Anthony made his entry into Ephesus, women dressed as bacchantes and men and boys like satyrs and pans led the way before him, and the city was full of ivy and thyrsus-wands, harps, pipes and flutes, the people hailing him as Dionysus, giver of joy and beneficence" (Anthony xxIv).94 Even when the full theatrical splendor of the Ephesian performance could not 89 For the possible connection of the theater in Pergamon with the Hellenistic Ruler Cult and a comparison between the layout of theaters with peristyle courts and the cult sanctuary of the kaisareion type, see Hanson, 36, 53-55, 95-97. 90 To quote Hanson: "The Imperial cult enters the religious parapher- nalia of the theater building in a rather high proportion. This seems natural, since the theater as a gathering place for large numbers of people could be an obvious propaganda site" (p. 91). For evidence of cult statuary and objects directly relatable to the divine rights and presence of the Roman emperor, see Hanson, 60, n. 62, 81-92, 97. In the stage building of many Roman theaters, the central niche (or the niche above the Porta Regia) was reserved for the statue of the emperor. Crema (as in n. 75), 191-92, fig. 189. In this connection one could cite the Severan Septizodium in Rome whose impressive fa;ade of superimposed aediculae in three stories may have served as a backdrop for the colossal statue of the emperor inside the middle apse.

The Dionysiac godhead could also be syncreticized with other divine attributions, as Nock quotes from Aelius Aristedes: "Zeus himself is Dionysus. ... He is above all the gods warlike and peaceful. They identify with him also Pan ..."; A. Aristedes, ed. W. Din- dorf, 1829, Iv, 49. Nock further observes that, "... Dionysus and Herakles were the typical examples of men honored as gods after death for their achievements. ..." Two colossal statues of Hercules and Dionysus in green basalt were placed just outside the Aula Regia of the Domus Flavia in Rome in the 18th century (they are now in the museum at Parma). F. Bianchini, Del Palazzo de' Cesari, Verona, 1738, 54f., pls. xIx and xx. 92 According to a decree found in Athens, the Guild of Dionysiac Actors (technitae) decided to place the image (avaApa) of Ariarthes V of Cap- padocia next to the god, to crown it with a wreath, to offer incense to it, and to illuminate it with torches. A second image (euccbv) placed in the propylaea of the temenos received sacrifices. I tend to disagree with Nock who interprets all this merely as an expression of gratitude; I find, on the contrary, that this document provides us with an instance of emperor worship and a fairly explicit description of cult ritual. Nock, 218-19. Op- posing some of Nock's views is F. Millar, "The Imperial Cult and the Persecutions" (as in n. 39), 147-48.

Dionysus was a world conqueror as the Roman emperor was or hoped to be; he was triumphant over mor- tality, also as the emperor, if deified, would be.95 The em- peror, like Dionysus, often took the attributes of a sun god and claimed a radiant, reveling, and joyful existence in the center of the universe.96 Some of the third-century em- perors such as Caracalla, Elagabalus, and Aurelian - no doubt under strong Eastern influence and in appropriate Eastern context - even encouraged the creation of actual "Dionysiac tableaux" and exotic triumphal scenes in which they could pose as the god himself.97 It is probably no accident that the Dionysiac theme played an important part in the decoration of the Imperial hall of the Vedius Bath-Gymnasium in Ephesus and the Marble Court in Sardis. From Ephesus comes a set of reliefs showing the god visiting the poet Menander98 and the infant Dionysus with nymphs.99 Of the statues and statuettes from the Marble Court of Sardis, many represent Apollo-Dionysus types, dancing satyrs, and Dionysus groups (panther and satyr).100 Even more significant in establishing a thematic link between the architecture and sculpture of the Marble Court are the capitals of the colonnade which screen the Court from the palaestra; these capitals, which greet the approaching visitor as he first begins to catch glimpses of the interior between oval-shaped columns, are carved with head motifs representing satyrs, maenads, and possibly Dionysus himself. At least in one particular capital, the features of the god appear to have been merged with those of Caracalla.101 A study by H. W. Pleket throws a new and exciting light on the appropriateness of the Dionysiac theme and theater symbolism in the architectural and sculptural iconography of Imperial halls.102 Pleket points to the existence of Im- perial mysteries in Asia Minor and the East as an aspect of the Imperial Cult in which the part of the emperor was played by special functionaries who revealed his image (sebastrophant) and extolled his virtues (theophant or theologos).103 All evidence seems to indicate that such ceremonies largely grew out of the context of traditional Greek religion as well as certain Oriental cults with pop- ular local application - emperor worship was syncretized into an existing mystery framework in which the 95 In a short and lucid summary of the significance of the god in the religious life of the Roman Empire, G. M. A. Hanfmann observes that, "His cult societies were numerous, well-organized and betray an active spirit. In his Indian campaign and his other conquests Dionysus had set an example of the vita activa which appealed to the minds interested in this world. The deification of various rulers as Neoi Dionysoi is associated with this aspect of the god"; American Journal of Archaeology, XLIII, 1939, 236-37.

Elagabalus is reported to have amused himself in similar manner, as well as harnessing lions and tigers to his chariot to make it look like that of Magna Mater or Dionysus - these being perhaps among the least offensive excesses of the repugnant emperor (The Scriptores Historiae Augustae, A. Elagabalus, xxvIII. 2). Aurelian's ceremony of triumph in Rome over Queen Zenobia of Palmyra was even more spec- tacular. Rivaling Anthony's entrance into Ephesus nearly three centuries earlier, the emperor was carried up to the Capitol in a chariot drawn by four stags accompanied by twenty elephants and a phalanx of exotic and wild beasts, including tigers, giraffes and elks (The Scriptores Historiae Augustae, Aurelian, xxxIII. 3-4).

Professor Hanfmann justly cautions me that the obvious and overriding reason for emphasizing Dionysiac subjects in Sardis is the traditional belief that the god in his Anatolian identity (Baki = Bacchus) was born on Mt. Tmolus, just south of Sardis. There should be, however, no objection to considering the presence of multiple factors which rein- force the reasons behind the choice of iconographical themes.

Pedley, Sardis in the Age of Croesus, Norman, Okla., 1968, 131. A parallel situation can be found in Lepcis Magna: the Labors of Hercules and Dionysiac myths are the sub- jects represented in the decoration of the sculptured pilasters from the Basilica. Hercules and Dionysus were the titulary deities of the city; but obviously the choice of the theme was pleasing to Septimius Severus and judged to be quite an appropriate one for the decoration of a forum which served as a center for his cult.

The scene is generally accepted as a representation of a Dionysiac ceremony. But C. Picard goes one step further and associates the ceremony with the rituals of the Im- perial Cult.s05 According to a badly preserved text from Ephesus, Hadrian appears to be joined with Dionysus in cult per- formances.106 Caracalla adopted the title of Neo- Dionysus; he was included in the traditional mystery celebrations in Pergamon and shared with the god the small Ionic temple of Dionysus Kathegemon, situated next to the theater.107 A second-century A.D. inscription from Ankyra (possibly Trajanic) informs us of the meeting of the koinon of the Galatians in connection with the Im- perial Cult. The assembly dedicates a stele containing the names of the delegates as a record of their duty. The names and the positions of several officials, including a woman whose title is given as the sebastophantissa, may relate to the municipal mysteries of the emperor.108 None of these sources reveal much about the content of the cult or its ritual. Most of what we know about the ritual comes from the "Hymondes Inscription" of Pergamon (see notes 92 and 102) and, indirectly, from the content and structure of other mystery cults.109 In keeping with the underlying Dionysiac character, the ritual in- cludes, in addition to the mystery play and the display of Imperial images, singing of hymns, music, dancing, in- cense offerings, and banquets.110 Particular emphasis seems to have been placed on light effects, as is the case for mysteries in general.111 This kind of program, even with the vaguest of definitions, is enhanced by an architectural setting, and preferably a theatrical one for the maximum impact. Modern-day torch illuminations of the reconstructed Marble Court of Sardis have con- firmed the dramatic effectiveness of the decor for such performances.112 The Cult of the Emperor and its pagan rites could not be 104 Compared to other mystery cults, the Dionysiac mysteries retained much of the traditional, Western structure of the Greek religion. It is not surprising that the majority of the believers were drawn from aristocratic and intellectual circles. In Nilsson's words, the mysteries "appealed to well-to-do people who loved a pleasant and luxurious life ... who from education and conservatism kept to the old culture and religion and yielded less easily to the lure of the more demanding foreign religions. ." This is precisely the same class of people who would have been the most ardent supporters of the Imperial system and the Imperial cult, and it goes a long way in explaining the alleged parallel between Dionysiac and Imperial mysteries. Also see n. 102. Nilsson, 144-47. G. M. A. Hanfmann, The Season Sarcophagus in Dumbarton Oaks, I, Cambridge, Mass., 1951, 237. The list of the mystae given in the famous "Bacchic In- scription" of the Metropolitan Museum of New York contains a large proportion of names from Roman aristocracy, including P. Agrippinilla, the wife of a Roman consul in A.D. 150, whose statue was supported by the base. See A. Vogliano and F.

See Delorme, 239, 255, 355-56. Forbes (as in n. 31), 39-40. In the ancient Roman tradition, the use of the temples for ritual dinners by some of the collegia was not unprecedented. In the Temenos of the Ruler cult in Pergamon, and the Heroon in Calydon, special rooms for banqueting functions were identified on archaeological evidence. (See n. 48.) On banqueting and banquet halls connected with mystery cults, especially that of Dionysus Kathegemon, see Nilsson, 62f. The luxurious columnar style in which the interiors of some of the more ambitious Roman dining halls were decorated recalls the opulent marble interiors of the Kaisersiile. Seneca describes a cenatio decorated with "expensive Egyptian and African columns in various colors" (Letters cxv. 8). Pliny mentions another one built by a freedman with thirty onyx columns (Letters xxxvi. 60). Also see Tamm, 190-96. 111 Pleket, 343. 112 An agonistic coin of Sardis issued under Elagabalus, to commemorate the short-lived third neokoria received by Sardis, depicts four temples and four prize crowns as symbols of four festivals.

Burrell asks if these could represent neokorate festivals for the city, and observes, "One at least must by the Koraia ... But no specifically imperial festivals are known on coins of Sardis.

But the sacredness invested in the person of the emperor as divina majestas, and his position in the center of the universe, the controller of fate, did not change - they only assumed a different nature and came from a different source. The entire iconography of architecture and the language of symbols that had developed over centuries around the notion of the Ruler Cult were placed at the service of the new Christian emperor as God's elect and were assimilated into the Christian context. The pagan settings in which the cult was observed were for the most part retained and kept up; the Imperial halls and exedrae, throne rooms and basilicae, were all too precious to abandon. Besides, it would have been foolish to reject them, because, once purged of their heathen connections, they could speak for the new ruler, regime, and ideology with the same eloquence and effec- tiveness as they had done for the old.115 It has even been argued - convincingly - that one of the formative influ- ences on the Early Church and the design of the Constan- tinian basilica came from the rituals of the Imperial Cult. 116 In Sardis, the apse of the Marble Court was cut open and made into a passageway, the pedimented ensemble thus becoming a glorious gate. In one ingenious stroke the Kaisersaal was transformed into a magnificent vestibule, an atrium, to evoke the triumphal appearance of an absent emperor (reminiscent of the forecourt of Diocletian's Palace at Split), and it led with shocking directness into the swimming pool of the frigidarium. To return to our original question: did the so-called Kaisersile have any meaningful association with the Im- perial Cult or were they merely a witness of the Roman love of luxury and lavishly decorated interiors? Many contain inscriptions dedicating the room to the emperor and his family in general terms, but only the one from the Middle Gymnasium in Pergamon (and, in a broader con- text, the Lapethos inscription, too) identify the space with the actual worship of Imperial personages as gods. Although altars have been found inside baths and gym- nasia, only in the Vedius Bath-Gymnasium of Ephesus has one been recovered in situ, in front of the main apse of the Kaisersaal. None reveals definitely what might be described as a devotional image of the emperor (with the possible exception of the cuirassed male statue from the "Kaisersaal" in Side, identified as Antoninus Pius on stylistic grounds), but a statue of the priest of the Imperial Cult wearing a crown of busts with allusions to the presence of the emperor among the traditional gods comes 113 Alfoldi, 1934, 76f. 114 I agree with Karayannopoulos's thesis that the view supporting the continuation of the Imperial Cult after the acceptance of Christianity is somewhat overblown - including the argument that Constantine iden- tified himself with Helios and expected worship (L. Brehier, "Constan- tine et la fondation de Constantinople," Revue historique, cxIx, 1915, 263; P. Batiffol, and L. Br6hier, Les Survivances du culte imperial romain, Paris, 1920.) Karayannopoulos clearly demonstrates that starting from the early years of the 4th century, Constantine's religious policy moved steadily towards Christianity: he never used divus as a title for himself, and after A.D. 326, all pagan emblems and symbols disappeared from the coinage. Although in his early rule he gave his consent to a request from certain cities in Umbria to build a temple in Hispellum dedicated to the Flavians, at the same time he deemed it necessary to include the injunc- tion that "the temple dedicated to our name shall not be polluted by the deceptions of any contagious superstition" (= "ne aedis nostro nomini dedicata cuiusquam contagiose superstitionis fraudibus polluatur," Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum, xI. No. 5265. A. H. M. Jones, The Later Roman Empire, I, Norman, Okla., 1964, 763. Also, Wissowa, 348). This temple was closed in A.D. 331 along with a number of other pagan temples. I. Karayannopoulos, "Konstantin der Grosse und der Kaiserkult," Romischer Kaiserkult, ed., A. Wlosok, Darmstadt, 1978, 485-508 (repr. from Historia, v, 1956, 341-357). Also see: D. L. Jones, "Christianity and the Roman Imperial Cult" (as in n. 39, 11.23.2, 1980), 1023-54, esp. 1050f. 115 In a number of Byzantine manuscript illuminations of the Gospels (9- 11th centuries) an architectural background of highly classicizing nature composed of columnar and aedicular elements appears behind the seated Evangelist (Fig. 33). In two articles published in 1927 and 1929, A. M. Friend demonstrated that the background for the Evangelist portraits was derived from Asiatic sarcophagi, and ultimately from the scaenae frons of the Classical theater where the seated statues of philosophers, poets and Muses were displayed: the aedicular background simply ac- companied the ancient sages in their Christian rebirth as Evangelists. The results of half a century of excavations and investigations since these perceptive studies were published may call for a few adjustments to Friend's theories. First, he did not take into consideration that stage architecture was only one of the various applications of aedicular faqades incorporating a lavish display of statuary: the rich architectural imagery and the thematic content represented in Roman gate structures, nymphaea, audience halls, basilicas and Kaisersile might have been just as appropriate and effective background for the Evangelists as for the theater. Second, Friend places a singular and undue emphasis on Ephesus as the center of sarcophagus production and a source for the creative transference of the types; we now know that Ephesus was only one among a number of important centers of sculpture flourishing in Asia Minor during Imperial times and in Late Antiquity: Aphrodisias, Side, and Sardis are others, to name a few. In all probability, the process ap- pears to have occurred along a much wider geographical and architec- tural front and involve a fuller iconographical content than Friend out- lined. See A. M. Friend, Jr., "The Portraits of the Evangelists in Greek and Latin Manuscripts," Art Studies, v, 1927, 115-47, pl. viii, esp. fig. 97, "Luke," fol. 12v; vii, 1929, 3-29. 116 G.

In a separate study of Theodoric's lost palace in Ravenna, Dygvve argues for the use of the "glorification gable" in Roman and Christian architecture (and in the minor arts) as a symbol of kingship and he emphasizes the continuity of Imperial iconography in the forms and liturgy of the early Church.

The design origins and backgrounds of these halls can be traced back to the Hellenistic gymnasium and even related specifically to its ephebeum. But the ephebeum cannot be proved to be directly connected with cult activity. The Hellenistic Ruler Cult and later the Cult of Roma, an important adjunct or a forerunner of the Im- perial Cult, had already been admitted into the gym- nasium, but it appears that a specific center of worship containing the image and the altar had not been fixed within the palaestral layout. If the Kaisersaal could be shown to be what the assigned name implies, then the credit for localizing the function must go to the Romans. Apart from the Hellenistic gymnasium, but closely comparable to its porticus/palaestra setting, independent centers for ruler worship and private, dynastic cults (such as the Kaisareion in Alexandria or the Temenos for the Ruler Cult in Pergamon) did actually exist. These buildings fall into the general category of the "porticus type" and provide an architectural precedent or authority for the suitability of the layout for similar purposes, and assure an active line of influence and tradition into the Roman era. The silent language of architectural and decorative forms typical of Kaisersiile, composed of rich and varied columnar fagades, pediments, and continuous podia for the display of statuary, alludes to kingly and palatial sub- jects and singles out Kaisersile as environments eminently suitable for the unfolding of the Imperial idea. The same kind of setting is quite appropriate for Roman stage architecture and suggests a link with Dionysus, and by ex- tension with the Dionysiac nature of the Roman emperor. The preeminence of the Dionysiac theme in the sculptural program of the Kaisersiile in Ephesus and Sardis may in- dicate, at least partially, the recognition of these implica- tions. Finally, although it is not provable at present, the possible association of these halls with the performance of Imperial mysteries is an extremely tempting idea. Admittedly, there is no single example that supports all these considerations. But it would be exceptionally skep- tical not to see the consistency and cumulative importance of the evidence that suggests a strong probability of the association of these halls with the Imperial Cult. Although the lack of firm information should not justify doling out imaginary names and functions to institutions we know little about, it helps to keep in mind that, after all, the an- cient world was generally quite reluctant to provide that kind of hard, "clinching evidence" we would dearly like to have. Even a building of extraordinary importance such as the Pantheon, a direct Imperial commission in the middle of the capital, lacks an identifying inscription that dis- closes its exact use and purpose. Beyond what has already been discussed, a valuable in- sight into the problem could perhaps be gained by con- sidering briefly something of the internal evidence - the nature of the Imperial Cult itself. Although there is much scholarly discussion on interpretation and details, a general agreement on two important points does exist: the cult was politically oriented, and it enjoyed considerable flexibility in its practices. Its acceptance within the framework of the bath-gymnasium complexes should be viewed as a reflection of these two prominent charac- teristics. Given its political nature, it thrived in active, ur- ban settings; its flexibility, which sustained few, if any binding traditions, allowed and even encouraged this in- clination. The public baths offer a tremendously fertile setting and politically advantageous base for the operation of the Imperial Cult. They, more than any other single in- stitution of the Classical world, created a vast and lux- urious environment in which the ideals of happiness and the good life could take shape; they involved the in- dividual actively in the pursuit and realization of this sense of well-being and reminded him effectively that all good was owed to the peace and prosperity made possible by a strong, unified state and a divinely inspired, benefi- cent emperor. Seen in this light, the Imperial hall merely represents the condensation of an idea in a specific architectural setting. It is important to understand that this particularization did not, immediately and ex- clusively, result in the kind of Kaisersaal treated in this paper. This type, as represented by the Sardian and Ephe- sian examples, displaying rich, aedicular fagades of mar- ble, is to be viewed as the culmination of a peculiar line in the general development of Roman architecture, and is es- pecially meaningful within the context of the "Marble Style" of Asia Minor in the second century. It is also important to point out that the Kaisersaal was not the official seat of the cult in the same sense as a neokorate temple."' Rather, it appears to be a kind of "Hall of Honor" for the ruling emperor and the Imperial 117 On neokoria and neokorate temples of the Imperial Cult in Asia Minor, see Hanfmann, 72-73. Nock, 230f. At the time the Marble Court took its final shape under Septimius Severus and Caracalla, Sardis had already received its second neokorate title, and hence had two temples as official seats of the Imperial Cult. The Hellenistic Temple of Artemis in which colossal cult statues of Antoninus Pius and Faustina accompanied those of Zeus and Artemis was the second neokorate temple.

The Kaisersaal of the bath-gymnasium was very much an active and living part of the overall establishment."19 The special type that has been the sub- ject of this study, which is best illustrated by the reconstructed Marble Court of Sardis, is distinguished by an extraordinary architecture, laden with symbolic con- notations and proving to be capable of remarkable flex- ibility in accommodating the changing ideals of a new age.

'" The general tendency in the observance of the Imperial Cult was toward an increasing acceptance of simple and cheap altar offerings of wine and incense (supplicatio) instead of costly animal sacrifices (immolatio). It would be logical to assume that the greater part of the daily ceremonies in Kaisersiile belonged to the first category, undertaken by the townspeople who had come to use the baths and the gymnasia. (See page 12 for the inscription from Magnesia on the Meander about the rentable altar in the baths.) Yet, the public nature of these complexes - especially the gymnasia with their deeply rooted associations with the Ruler Cult - must have also necessitated a certain number of official ob- servances, including the traditional blood sacrifices on some of the festival days; some might have regularly included the gymnastic games and contests, distribution of prizes, banquets, symposia, even the Im- perial mysteries. Fink, Hoey, and Snyder (as in n. 12), 190-201; Pleket, 342. 119 It appears that the Marble Court of Sardis continued to be used for civic and administrative purposes in the early Byzantine era, as attested by two crude inscriptions cut into the opus sectile floor mentioning the place (topos) of the city council and the gerousia. This is in keeping with the information gathered from other sites in Asia Minor indicating the long drawn-out existence of these institutions into the 6th century and it is significant in suggesting the continued use of the palaestra for such functions long after its athletic use had come to an end.
