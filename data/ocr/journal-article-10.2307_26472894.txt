Elsner, 2007. ‘Archéologie  classique et histoire de l’art en Grande-Bretagne.’ Perspective, 231-42, at 236- 8). Then there’s the implication, despite all the rhetoric to the contrary, that  understanding images is somehow ‘easy’: ‘pictures and artifacts’ can ‘speak for  themselves’ (a telling verb!), just as viewers can be ‘educated’ merely by  looking – without the need for further mediation, reflection or theoretical  framing. I was reminded of a throw-away comment by Ernst Robert Curtius,  who mused that ‘to understand Pindar’s poems requires mental effort, to  understand the Parthenon frieze does not’ (‘Pindars Gedichte zu verstehen,  kostet Kopfzerbrechen; der Parthenonfries nicht’); like Curtius, I suspect  many classicists still think that ‘knowing pictures is effortless compared with  knowing books’ (‘Die Bilderwissenschaft ist mühelos, verglichen mit der  Bücherwissenschaft’: E. R. Curtius, 1948. Europäische Literatur und  lateinisches Mittelalter. Bern, 23; 1953. European Literature and the Latin  Middle Ages, trans. W. R. Trask. New York, 15).   As an introduction to ‘encourage text-based scholars to explore that  [visual] heritage, use it, and enjoy it’ (p. xiv), the volume more or less  succeeds in fulfilling its objectives. As a reflection of the state of classical  visual cultural studies, though, the book makes for rather depressing reading.  If nothing else, it demonstrates the urgent need to re-build bridges between  ‘classics’ and ‘art history’, and from both sides of the academic divide.  MICHAEL SQUIRE  King’s College London  Grasp and Dissent: Cicero and Epicurean Philosophy. (Philosophie    hellénistique et romaine, 2).   STEFANO MASO.   Brepols publishers: Turnhout, 2015.  Pp. 272. Price: €70.00. Paperback.  ISBN 978-2-50-355030-5.   Stefano Maso’s Grasp and Dissent: Cicero and Epicurean Philosophy is a  welcome addition to the growing body of scholarship on Cicero’s  philosophical writings and on the Roman contribution to Hellenistic  philosophy. There is much of value in the book, which advertises itself as an  ‘amended English version of the original Italian volume’, 2008. Capire e  dissentire: Cicerone e la filosofia di Epicuro. Bibliopolis. (p. 7). It also has some  significant drawbacks.  The study purports to analyse Cicero’s philosophical training, in  particular his relationship with Epicurean philosophy and his expertise in it.  M. claims that Cicero is a reliable source on Epicureanism, not just a critic of </page> <page sequence="2"> 84 Reviews  it – indeed, that a generally accurate and competent presentation of the  material served Cicero’s own didactic ends. M. believes that Roman culture,  and Cicero more specifically, contributed something original to the history of  philosophy – as opposed to merely transmitting Greek philosophy through  translation into Latin. Following scholars like Görler and Griffin, M. takes  Cicero’s philosophical works to constitute a coherent system, reflecting the  plan outlined in De divinatione II 2-4. According to M., in these works,  through a method and style of argument combining both Platonic and  Skeptic elements, as well as his rhetorical skills, Cicero tried to transcend  doubt and find ‘reliable ethical and civic propositions’ (pp. 11-12).  M.’s analysis is mainly based on textual exegesis. He rejects  Quellenforschung as a way of analysing Cicero’s philosophical works because  he disagrees with its implications for the originality of Cicero’s thought (pp.  12-13). M. is correct that using sources does not necessarily make Cicero a  translator. Nevertheless, a systematic understanding of which sources  (written, oral, and remembered) Cicero had access to, which ones he chose to  use, and how, is an essential foundation on which to build the sort of analysis  which M. is attempting. Moreover, the contents, aims, intended uses, and  audiences of those sources might well also have affected Cicero’s  interpretation of Epicurean thought. (The differences between Epicurus’  K.D., Ad Hdt, and Peri Phuseos are a case in point.) One cannot convincingly  evaluate a thinker’s originality, biases, or accuracy, and thus reliability as a  witness, without such foundations. Instead, M. asserts throughout the volume that Cicero’s early studies  with Phaedrus and Zeno of Sidon were the main source of Cicero’s  knowledge of Epicureanism. M. does acknowledge (e.g. pp. 15-16, 36-37)  that Cicero also would have had access to other Epicurean figures and texts,  not least Lucretius’ De rerum natura and the works of Philodemus, as well as  testimonia recorded in works like the Vetusta Placita. However, M. generally  neglects these in his analysis of Cicero’s representation of Epicurean thought;  this is a problem, given that they were probably Cicero’s intertexts as well as  among his sources. Similarly, Epicurean thought is generally treated by M. as  a monolith, rather than as a tradition within which there was a certain  amount of variation (cf. D. N. Sedley, ‘Philosophical Allegiance in the  Greco-Roman World’, in M. Griffin and J. Barnes (eds.), 1989.  Philosophia Togata, pp. 97-119). Thus, the volume’s more general claims –  namely that Cicero understood Epicureanism well, knew how to  confront it, and, especially, that apparent misinterpretations were  intentional (p. 14) – fall short of being demonstrated.  The book has a number of other serious shortcomings. Although the  chapters proceed topically, the organisation and expression of the material  within each chapter makes the logic of the arguments difficult to follow. A  summary of the contents is therefore in order.  </page> <page sequence="3"> Reviews 85  The introduction purports to assess Cicero’s anti-Epicureanism; it sets  out most of the volume’s main claims and underlying assumptions. M.  disagrees with the theory that Cicero was only dedicated to philosophy from  46-44 BCE, during his enforced retirement from politics, when he composed most of his philosophical works. He also disagrees that this oeuvre was little more than translation. Instead he proposes the alternative hypothesis that ‘Cicero owes his philosophical education to his early years, a period of his life in which this type of education was integrated seamlessly with more general cultural and rhetorical training’, which then facilitated both his political and career and later philosophical endeavors (p. 13, cf. 33-5). The original part, for M., is that Cicero made the legacy of Greek philosophy accessible to his Roman audience and did so by adapting Greek philosophy, especially ethics, and Roman exempla to one another. According to M., Cicero’s study of Epicureanism was at least formative in the sense that it provided a foil for his later philosophical allegiances, but he disliked its dogmatism, materialist physics, and ethical preference for the vita contemplativa. M. proposes that this rejection was not wholesale; he suggests that Cicero – not coincidentally towards the end of his life – became increasingly inclined towards a version of otium which he interpreted as both dignified and consistent with Roman virtue, a version not unlike Epicurean ataraxia. That version consisted of using Greek philosophy to educate the Roman man. The first chapter gives a brief overview of the main texts upon which M.  draws for his analysis – namely De natura deorum, De finibus, and Tusculanae  disputationes (others include De fato, De officiis, and Academica). It surveys  their contents, structure, and chronology, focusing on the sections devoted to  Epicureanism. It also considers Cicero’s knowledge of Greek philosophy,  with particular emphasis on his acquaintance with and evolving opinion of  Epicurean thinkers.   The second chapter, drawing especially on ND I and De fato, deals with  Cicero’s knowledge specifically of Epicurean physics, with particular  emphasis on the swerve or clinamen, with a view to validating Cicero’s  credibility as a source and thus his ‘foundational education’ (p. 47), from  which M. assumes that it is derived. When M. does attempt to factor in  Cicero’s later reading here, including of Epicurus, Lucretius’ DRN, and  Carneades, Cicero actually comes across as initially less than well-informed,  vacillating, and a not particularly accurate or effective interpreter of his  intertexts.  The third and fourth chapters also focus on ND I. The third concerns  the Epicurean anthropomorphic conception of the gods, friendship, and the  physics underlying ideas about the gods. The fourth chapter proposes that the  Laelius and De officiis were a reaction to the failure of Cicero’s plan to  educate the Romans as well as to control Octavian and considers Cicero’s  Academic Skepticism. It then returns to ND I, focusing on its potted history  </page> <page sequence="4"> 86 Reviews  of philosophy and arguing that Cicero’s critique, especially of Aristotelian  theology, through the persona of Velleius, evinces Cicero’s knowledge of  Epicureanism and skill at employing Epicurean ideas. M. claims that  Epicureanism serves as a ‘litmus test’ against which the positions of other  schools can be judged (p. 146).  The fifth chapter deals with what M. considers the heart of Cicero’s  opposition to Epicureanism, i.e. its hedonism – the position that pleasure is  the highest good and goal of life. This argument is based primarily on the  first two books of De finibus. M. attempts to show that Cicero’s critique of  Epicurean theories of kinetic and katastematic pleasure shows Cicero’s  technical expertise, ’reliable and excellent knowledge’, and thus his  importance as a witness (p. 162). M. also discusses Epicurean friendship and  emphasis on utility, Cicero’s preference for virtue, conceived of as that which  is honorable, and Cicero’s strategy of presenting this material.  The sixth chapter picks up Cicero’s criticism of the idea that pleasure  involves a lack of suffering; using the Tusculanae and De finibus, it develops  this criticism in relation to Epicureanism’s tetrapharmakon and ideas about  the nature of death, the limits of pleasure and pain, the goal of life, and how  to achieve it. For M., Cicero’s criticisms amount to rejecting the Epicurean  ethical system because it denies his own personal highest goods, virtue and  action, i.e. the vita activa as negotium (p. 199). Using a range of texts, M.  then tries to show that Cicero was not entirely unsympathetic to a dignified  kind of otium, particularly when his political star waned.  The Epilogue is actually more of a conclusion. It summarises and  synthesises the ideas which the rest of the book attempt to tease out, and is  the volume’s clearest exposition of both the ideas and their potential  significance. A reader would do well to begin here.  The expression is also a problem; the volume is poorly edited. No part of  the book is free from error. It abounds with typographical as well as more  serious mistakes, especially of English idiom, grammar, and punctuation,  which often interfere with the clarity of M.’s ideas. Given that the translation  was apparently either done or edited by a native English speaker, this is  surprising. (The Preface implies that the translation is the author’s own and  edited by one Travis A. Sadler [p. 7]. Sadler’s LinkedIn page, on the other  hand, claims credit for the translation [https://www.linkedin.com/in/  travisadler, last accessed 20 February 2018].) There are also a few errors in  translations from ancient languages, for instance: dies as dates, not days (p.  19, n. 26); and principiorum as first principles, not first-beginnings, which  they clearly are at DRN 2.292: id facit exiguum clinamen principiorum (p. 65).  M. also makes some potentially misleading word choices, like rendering the cessation of perception at death as ‘insensitivity’ (p. 185, n. 25). Some of M.’s sentences run on the length of a paragraph (e.g. p. 38), and numerous </page> <page sequence="5"> Reviews 87  pages contain single footnotes which take up half to three-quarters of a page  (e.g. p. 75, n. 38; p. 148, n. 3).  Certain conventions are not adopted consistently. They include: spelling  (e.g. Plutarch/Plutarchus, Octavian/Octavius, and Lucretius Caro),  hyphenation (e.g. antiepicureanism vs anti-Epicureanism), italicising,  capitalisation of titles in bibliography entries (including with respect to works  in the same language), the sorts of quotation marks used to set off the titles of  articles and essays, and translation practices. Italian, French, and German are  generally left untranslated. There are no stated or readily discernible criteria  governing whether or not quotations from Latin and Ancient Greek are  translated into English, when a translation is preferred to the original Latin or  Greek, and, in the instances when both original and translation are given,  when one is relegated to the footnotes. The cumulative effect of M.’s  translation practices is substantial, as a significant proportion of this book’s  text and footnotes is devoted to extensive quotations. In both the text and  notes, M.’s general practice is to quote from a work, rather than to cite the  relevant passage, even if he is neither analysing that passage nor building on  philological evidence from it. While this is handy for reference, it exceeds  what is necessary for the analysis.  There are inconsistencies in the content as well. Crucially for the book’s  argument: although M. frequently asserts Cicero’s competence, reliability,  perfect understanding, and objectivity in representing Epicurean doctrine,  this is undermined by the numerous cases in which M. notes that Cicero is  biased, making an error, and/or misrepresenting Epicurean thought. I have  counted at least eighteen instances of the latter. M. also claims to distinguish  between Cicero the rhetorician and Cicero the philosopher (p. 26); the rest of  the book suggests otherwise, and indeed this is one of its most valuable  contributions. M. suggests that Cicero uses rhetoric to persuade of his own  version of the truth, explicitly stating at one point that ‘Cicero seeks to  exploit his materials by adapting them for his own rhetorical, argumentative,  and therefore potentially polemical, perspective.’ (p. 146).   Another shortcoming is the lack of a general index. The volume provides  an Afterword, an Index Nominum and an Index Fontium. Including a general  index as well would have rendered it more user-friendly. M. discusses certain  topics in multiple parts of the book, generally without cross-references; these  include Epicurean theology, the tetrapharmakon, and Cicero’s Academic  Skepticism. Particularly in the last instance, one must rely on one’s own  perusal of the volume to glean how this relates to Cicero’s engagement with  Epicureanism.   The reader must infer much of the justification for the second  publication of this material, as it specifies no emendation other than the  translation and an Afterword. One might have expected that it would in part  be taking account of the wealth of significant scholarship relevant to this  </page> <page sequence="6"> 88 Reviews  investigation which has been published since the original version likely went  to press. While a small handful of works published since 2007 are considered  in the amended chapters, most of those are M.’s own. The Afterword  sketches some scholarship published, mostly between 2007 and 2014, which  M. has not otherwise taken account of in this English version. It amounts to  little more than a selective, briefly annotated bibliography, with comments  dispersed rather randomly between the footnotes and the main text. Despite  the intention stated in the Preface of also using the Afterword as an  opportunity to engage with his critics (p. 7), M. only does so explicitly with  S. Marchand’s 2010 review of the 2008 version. A footnote to the Preface  similarly mentions a few works published between 2011 and 2015 which it  will not take into account.   The scholarship neglected is perhaps even more surprising. M. overlooks  some highly pertinent literature. Not even when discussing the  tetrapharmakon does M. consider the work of Nussbaum, although important  works such as The Therapy of Desire (1994) were published some time ago.  Also underutilised or altogether neglected is much valuable scholarship on the  swerve, determinism, and the relationship between Epicurean thought and  both Skeptic and Stoic thought. More recent scholarship, such as V.  Tousna’s The Ethics of Philodemus (2007) and J. Fish and K.R. Sanders’  Epicurus and the Epicurean Tradition (2011), are also omitted, despite their  relevance to M.’s study. The essays in the latter by Sedley and Konstan,  debating the nature of the Epicurean gods, may well have impacted M.’s  analysis of Cicero’s interpretation of Epicurean theology.  In sum, this book is uneven in both form and content. It is best suited  for specialists in Hellenistic philosophy, and would not work well for  undergraduates. Some of its claims are attractive, and no doubt the lot will be  tested by further research. One need not agree with all of M.’s interpretations  of Epicurean doctrines and their underlying logic, or indeed with all of his  analyses of Cicero’s understanding of these things, to find value in the wealth  of examples M. provides in which Cicero represents Epicureanism in ways  that advance his own didactic aims. By thus furthering our understanding of  the relationship between rhetoric and philosophy in Cicero’s philosophical  works, M.’s volume makes its most significant contribution to the field.
