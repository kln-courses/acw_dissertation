<plain_text><page sequence="1">HUNGARIAN HUMOR BY JOSEPH REMENYI IN THIS ESSAY no distinction will be made between humor and the comic spirit. While, no doubt, the form alid content of humor is apt to bring to the listener or reader results differing from those of any expression of the comic spirit, the inherent differences only then be- come conspicuous when the social and individual causes of both pre- vent them from being integrated. In judging things sub specie aeternitatis humor is apt to equalize differences, and the comic spirit is apt to emphasize contrasts. The representational attribute of hu- mor in relation to the intention of understanding is a certain inno- cence of the spirit, confidence, sometimes credulity; that of the comic strain answers those demands of human insight which should be considered as correlatives of man's complicated nature. Nevertheless, the distance between humor and comedy can be shortened when the latter is willing to be less critical and the former less innocent. To be sure, this approach does not aim to improve the understanding of the psychology of humor and of the comic spirit; but it aims to simplify issues which sinc-e Kant have sometimes been unduly magnified in their oppositions. II Is there national taste which includes humor as a collective experi- ence? If there is, it would mean that certain humorous occurrences affect the people of a nation similarly. Comic characters like Reynard the Fox or Brer' Rabbit, puppets like Punch and Judy, seem to indi- cate a universality of the comic spirit which is immune to national boundaries. However, a joke or a comic character that goes around the world is naturally passing through experiences which imply the influence of various environments; hence, it often happens that an anecdote, let us say, born in Russia scarcely recognizes its adult face in America. A Faustian puppet play produced in Salzburg compared with one produced in a Czech village may recall mirth of similar intensity or lack of sophistication; but the manner of dramatic inter- pretation shows an unmistakable deviation in the adoption of ideas and wit related to the philosophy and character of Faust. The spirit of fun is universal; its attributes vary in time and space. If this universality is the basic principle of humor, is it reasonable to speak about a pronounced Hungarian humor? Are there character- 194</page><page sequence="2">Hungarian Humor 195 istic Hungarian foibles, dominating aberrations, manifestations of ignorance; aridity, meddlesomeness and braggart heroism, limitations of judgment and perspectives of credulous innocence? Yes, there is a definite Hungarian humor, a definite Hungarian comic spirit; but in the light of evidence that Hungarian humor offers it is important to state that the question is only then approached sensibly when its possible and plausible answer excludes a belief in the infallibility of so-called racial homogeneousness. It would be utterly wrong to dis- credit the racial validity of Hungarian humor by stating that scientifically speaking there is no pure race; "racial validity" involves less than "pure race," but restates the faith in symbols which provide the key for the understanding of the relativity of racial contributions. Racial memories are more deep-rooted than theories about racial purity. That is true in the case of the Hungarians (Magyars) as well as in the case of the Serbs, Croats, Roumanians, Slovaks, Ruthe- nians. But it is a mistake when "scientists" speak about the "organic unit" of a race, and use this impressive fallacy in the estimation of humor. Bela Bartok, the great Hungarian composer and student of folklore has given a comprehensive interpretation of the interconnec- tion of Hungarian, Roumanian, and Slav folksongs and peasant customs; with intuition and factual knowledge he revealed that there is a considerable affinity of recreational tradition among these people, intrinsic and extrinsic, despite racial differences. Yet, while one must make allowances for the interrelation between the humor of the surrounding nations and the Hungarians themselves, it would be wrong to go to another extreme and recognize nothing but these interrelations in the quality and quantity of Hungarian humor. The truth, as so often in other problems, lies in the similarity and dissimilarity of the question. The ethnological and folkloristical investigations of Hungarian writers in recent times suggest that Hungarian folklore is a bearer of the epic tradition of common Euro- pean 'culture. The homogeneous Hungarian elements and the hetero- geneous elements imposed on each other do not inflict confusion on Hungarian culture. This is true in the microcosm of humor and in its relationship to the world of other creative expressions. In the Popular Ballads of the Szekely people the collector, Gyula Ortutay and the illustrator, Gyorgy Buday, imply that "Transylvania is a mysterious island" which, however, "never lost its contact with Europe." What is said about Transylvania, is rightly said about Hungary proper. But the image of a "mysterious island" also suggests uniqueness, that is Hungarianism par excellenice. Charlotte Lederer in her Made in Hungary gives a romaintic picture of Hungarian life. She speaks about</page><page sequence="3">196 Joseph Remenyi the "perfect line and harmony of design" observable in Hungarian peasant art, showing that there are forms and colors in Hungary that cannot be recaptured in foreign lands. No doubt, in Hungarian min- strel shows, Christmas, Carnival and Easter customs, in weddings and wakes, in grape festivals, in embroideries and dances, one recog- nizes expressions of a humorous fancy which give a positive answer to the question whether there is a national taste that includes humor as a collective experience. From all this one may gather that, indeed, there is a Hungarian humor that may be considered a transmitter of certain racial funda- mentals and there is a Hungarian humor which participates in the humor of other nations. Humor that is severed from the soil and has urban sophistication is, of course, also a Hungarian attribute; so is irony, satire, sardonic superiority, diabolical conceit, bizarreness and the kind of madness to which Horace says it is good to be sometimes subjected. Finally, the subtlety and legitimate delicacy of mature or decadent minds expressing themselves by means of shadowy and smiling sensitiveness is also known in Hungarian life. Things that make the people of Budapest laugh and things that make the people of the villages gay are interplaying experiences as they spring from the invisible unifying spirit of the nation. The intellectual differences of Hungarians do not prevent them from having certain similar reac- tions. There are Hungarians who like caviar, but almost every Hungarian likes his native dish, the goulash. There are Hungarians who may not like every Hungarian anecdote, comedy or farce, but most Hungarians will find something entertaining in them. Summa summarum: there is a Hungarian national mind revealing the na- tion's particular and universal sense of humor. IIt In a world of unreason in which materialistic concepts prevail, often no account is taken of attempts through which the impossible could be accomplished. As so many know, one of these "impossible" attempts is to win understanding for the peaceful solution of the problems of Hungary and the surrotunding states. Domonkos G. Kosary, in his "History of Hungarv," speaks about Carpathian Europe, implying a climatic habit and political temper which has its characteristic form. Oscar Jaszi's more emphatic pattern of a Danubian confederation indicates a vision of cooperation which, as yet, has not been asserted on a large scale by those who could cure the injustice of the present situation. There are others, whatever their nationality may be, who maintain that all the chauvinistic pain and</page><page sequence="4">Hungarian Humor 197 sorrow of East-Central Europe would disappear if justice should dis- place terror, understanding displace hatred, and coercion be replaced by cooperation. In fact, the interrelationship of the folklore spirit and of the humor- ous mentality of the Hungarians and the surrounding people implies a possible diminishment of misunderstanding and strife. In the deep- est mental stratum of this section of Europe, as has been suggested in this essay, there are sublime and ridiculous factors which, so to say, invite the cessation of differences. Rituals with the symbolic significance of prehistoric magic or pastoral sweetness or jesting masqueraders are not merely expressions of religious or rural foolish- ness, but reflections of creative imagination which introduce us to a collective honesty of the spirit that has been somewhat defaced by modern times. When, for example, Stojan Pribishevich in his World Without End declared that the southeastern European peasants have a sense of the meaninglessness of time, like the Chinese, when he de- clared that the true cultural division is between the village and the city, knowingly or unknowingly he included in this sphere of psy- chology the Magyar peasants, though they are neither Slavs nor Roumanians. Folk-humor should bridge the gap between the Hun- garians and the surrounding Slavs and Roumanians; but this "dream" may make politicians wonder whether they have anything in common with "non-political" minds who wish to hasten the solution of this problem in such an innocent manner. They are prone to forget that one of the ingredients of humor is introspective freedom; that is a capacity to reject unfairness. Humor adds to intimacy, and thus turns suspicion into confidence. Naturally, from a purely practical point of view, this vision of humor as a conciliator of opposing forces has only an academic value; but, if really applied, it might have an equally practical value. Precisely because it seems easier to be prejudiced than fair, more majorum the latent and visible forces of Central and South-Eastern Europe, institutionalized and otherwise, interfere with ideas that may lead to understanding. Consequently, it becomes comprehensible why the Hungarians should be considered by some historians unwelcomed in the midst of Slavs and Roumanians. The Hungarians are accused of being unduly proud; especially their rul- ing class which, according to this accusation, is an unregenerate anachronism of European society. It is stated that the Hungarian attitude is dominated by a stubborn illusionism of a Herrenvolk which Count Keyserling likes, but which neither the Hungarian landless peasants and underpaid proletarians nor the surrounding na- tions seem to enjoy. As a matter of fact, the Hungarians who set-</page><page sequence="5">198 Joseph Remenyi tled in the Carpathian valley in the year 896 A.D. are neither better nor worse than the Slavs or the Roumanians, and while they are a mixture of the Finnish-Ugrian and the Turkish people, during their one thousand years in Europe, much of their Asiatic strain has been obliterated with the infusion of foreign blood. Information about the ancient Hungarian spirit, including humor, is meager and is inevitably based on speculation. Nevertheless there are folktales that can be traced back to their sources, but not to their original sources. Geza Feja, a present-day Hungarian writer, identifies the decorative richness of peasant art (that of the districts of Sarkoz and Kalotaszeg) with the beauty of folklore, and considers its pensiveness and gayness an expression of "Hungarian home- coming." He claims the emotional and spiritual freedom of the people is achieved through an adherence to folk-imagination. Whether the tales portray the fate of a poor peasant woman's son, whom the Princess marries because he is strong and honest, or of the poor girl whose magic gifts enabled her to pluck golden flowers and spread happiness wherever she went, or whether they spoke about the charm of the golden-fleeced lamb of King Matthias, or show a conformity with other accumstomed themes of fairy tales, they imply an under- standing of folklore imagination which has pronounced traditions in Hungary. The Hungarian peasant habits of which Karoly Viski speaks in his book display the same freshness of an imaginative spirit which lurks in every recreational expression of the people. The fertile spirit of Hungarian humor is not an extraneous feature of folk- imagination; it is an organic part of its dreams and fashions, of iLs home]y and visionary philosophy. It shines through the darkness of Hungarian destiny; it clears away fears and anxieties. There are no written Hungarian documents before the acceptance of Christianity in the year of 1000 A.D. It is logical to assume that Christianity affected, in its correlative function, the character of Hungarian humor and the humorous behavior of the people. How- ever, it is also logical to assume that the primitive impetus of the original imagination was strong enough not to permit Christian con- sciousness to modify it entirely. Hungarian folk-tales are obviously naive or heroic in their humorous aspects. The humor is apt to be didactic. In many folk-tales, the ridiculed person is identical with the subject of moral condemnation. Cowardice, deceptiveness, double- crossing, cunning, when found out, must be punished. There are philosophers and psychologists who maintain that with laughter we punish the person whose absurd or dishonest actions or frivolous re- flex-motions fully deserve this. Sometimes learned wisdom and in-</page><page sequence="6">Hungarian Humor 199 stinctive wisdom meet. Hungarian humor of early times, as well as that of today, resents humbug; but not heroic lies (the people know how to differentiate between lies and imagination), even though these lies should be as incredible as those of Janos Hary, who, according to folk-stories, was a contemporary of Napoleon and boasted of heroic deeds. Zoltan Kodaly succeeded in musically portraying the delightful humor of this harmless impostor, this Hungarian miles gloriosus. Sandor Petofi's Janos Vitez ("Hero John," a folk-character) contains abundant humorous material. This young hero, who travelled much and had many adventures, attains in the greatest Hungarian lyric poets epic presentation a symbolic significance that upholds the traditions of genuine Hungarian folk-humor. In modern times Jeno Heltai made of this theme a light comedy, and Pongrac Kacsoh set it to music. Martial humor was always popular in Hun- gary. Psychologically there is hardly any difference between naiveness and heroism. Yet, especially in folk-tales, folk-songs and superstitions communicated orally from one generation to the next, one must draw a line of demarcation between these two postulates of folk-humor. While naiveness in this atmosphere is rather anthropomorphic (like the totem cult of the Indians) heroism is more of a rational experi- ence. The imaginative relationship between trees and flowers, storms and sunshine, the humanization of natural facts may be a parallel, but not a similar experience of someone who proved to be a hero in battle, saved the life of his sweetheart, punished the villain, conquered the enemy, and went through other heroic actions. NaYvite is imagina- tion per se, and heroism is action that suggests imagination. Probably the most interesting part of this kind of humor is indulgence, a sign of secure superiority, and maturity in regard to judgment; a sign of collective mental and moral ripeness. The evaluation of the Corpus Huingaricum must have recourse to views which consider the criterion of humerous fancies. Humor, by the virtue of its purpose, is a creative expression. Balzac was right when he said that through creation everything grows: space, concept, word and man. Hungarian humor, not confined to anecdotes, but in its motivation dictated by creative urge, is as much a true history of the idiosyncrasies and virtues of the people as of the virtues and terrors of the ruling class. There are more smiles than laughter in Hungarian folk-tales and farces. Once I asked an American-Hungarian unskilled laborer of peasant extraction why he liked to read Mark Twain. "He makes me smile," he replied. That was generous appreciation, because the ap- preciation of the Hungarian peasant is controlled by an inner dignity</page><page sequence="7">200 Joseph Remenyi and is not exuberant. For example, when he likes someone, he will not say: "I love him." He is apt to say, "I rather like him," which is a complete surrender of his emotions to the other man. Hungarian folk-humor is not boisterously gay like that of the Latins, where tipsy friars and monks become the target of amused observers and listen- ers; it is a smiling experience; it is not an explosion of one's pent-up energies, but release from monotony and deep silences. Horses, ducks, geese, chickens, roosters, foxes, wolves, song-birds and dragons may appear in these stories; their source, indeed, may be prehistoric, or they may be emphatically modified by modern times, though still adhering to some traditions; they may contain rustic scenes almost vulgar or coarse (which, by the way, is seldom so) but the result, as a rule even in its cosmic perspective, is a smiling affirmation of this adventure, and not a laughing approval of it. What is the relationship of Hungarian humor to love and death? It has been said that these two phenomena of human life do not require intelligence. The keenest analytical equipment cannot prevent the experience of human bondage and the inevitableness of death. In contradiction to this statement one might say that the recognition of these two factors is already a sign of applied intelligence. Humor, be- ing a certain expression of active intelligence (quite often an antith- esis of intellectuality), must be related to love and death. As to love, it should be stated that the Hungariani peasant's imagination is not sensual. He resents innuendos; yet he may use blunt expressions which are embarrassing or grotesquely entertaining. He calls a spade a spade, not because of brutal frankness, but because his nature re- sents obscenity. Hence humor related to sex is rarely, almost never, lewd; thus there is revealed a smiling sense of evaluation motivated by the tragicomic aspects of male-female relationship. Steeped in the conviction of moral decency (not moralization), the abused passions of sex-life, by virtue of their low quality, may furnish the Hungarian peasant either with a laughter that separates him from filth, or with a farcical sense of superiority that gives him a chuckling satisfaction that sees beneath the evident desire for pleasure. But when he laughs with the freedom that the caprice or fulfillment of sex-urge symbolizes, one may be sure that his laughter is healthy and refreshing. Dionys- iac frenzy is unknown to him. When he is sensually aroused, like cer- tain characters in the stories of the able realistic writer Zsigmond Moricz, his sense of humor deserts him. Death to the Hungarian people is not always a mournful fact. Ho- mer considers Sleep and Death twins. Around these two realities many stories have been woven; in Hungarian folktales, one frequently</page><page sequence="8">Hungarian Humor 201 finds a verification of the Homeric conception. Even today we will find rural districts (mostly in the Trans-Danubian section of Hun- gary proper and in Transylvania) where man's relationship to death is rather cordial. It seems an unconscious revenge upon fear caused by tales of ghosts and other visitors of the supernatural world. One of the most pathetic and humorous expressions as to death is the custom in some Transylvanian-Hungarian villages where, before burial, the corpse is given a farewell party by a member of the family; in this farewell speech the corpse is asked to forward sad and happy greet- ings to those who departed from this earth before him. Something should be said about the wakes given by members of the family. Dezso Szabo, a contemporary Hungarian writer, made an artistic and psychologically successful use of this traditional weird humor of such wakes in one of his novels. Jozsef Nyiro, a Transylvanian writer, de- scribes the train ride of a dead peasant from the city to his village. His widow accompanies the corpse; the passengers and the conductor are unaware or pretend to be unaware that the husband is dead. He travels, as a passenger, his fare has been paid, he is therefore entitled to a seat. There is nothing gruesome in this trip. The wife travels with her husband as if he were alive, thus saving the shipment of the body which would cost much more. The story touches one's heart, yet makes one smile. In discussing folk-humor one must also refer to the humor of the proletarians. Hungary is chiefly an agrarian country; the stress of city-life and its splendorless vocabulary have affected less people than in western European countries. Nevertheless the human condition called the proletarian lot is known in Hungary, i.e., in Budapest and in the provincial cities. It is expressed with a certain argot, but its character derives rather from a class-position that has an interna- tional terminology than from the soil of the nation. It contains the defeated or poorly compensated man's arrogance in relationship to social, political and economic unfairness; but it has also good sense. It professes an admission of social pressure which is disheartening and justifies rough and tough reactions. In modern Hungarian litera- ture there is much that can be traced to the interplay of proletarian- ism and exploitation, usurping and creating humorous scenes and characters. The humorous taste of the skilled worker is closer to the cliche of the petty bourgoisie. Gypsy humor suggests awkwardness of a low social position; supercilious contempt for the poor peasant, hypocritical or honest admiration for the "gentleman." As to the part that children play in Hungarian folk-humor, one must remember that irreverence for parents is highly deplorable in</page><page sequence="9">202 Joseph Remenyi the light of the patriarchal standards of the peasants. Hence children are expected to mind their business, and respect their elders. The re- sult is limited freedom obtained through gayety, generally expressed in fairy tales with a didactic purpose and in games. In the humor and games of children living in the cities one discerns the shadows of an embryonic sophistication. IV Too often, foreigners visiting Hungary expect only exotic gypsy music and homespun atmosphere. The world today is so complicated that a nation known for gypsy music, gypsy humor, gay dances, pretty women, good wine, and large wheat fields, seeks to justify a romantic concept of return to nature. In the jokes of the Hungarian peasants one finds recognition of traditional and present-day social unrest; the spirit of the people exercises the right of expressing trans- parent dissatisfaction through humor. But it would be unjust to the Hungarian nation to assume that in the realm of humor their contri- bution is only that of the common people. Such is not the case. Hungarian culture has never been separated from the west of Eu- rope. This being the case, one should overcome the temptation of westerners to see in the cultural process of the nation merely a reflec- tion of peasant-taste or an unsuccessful attempt at being urbane. In fact, at the time of the Renaissance, Hungarian humanists, while they expressed themselves in Latin, were adding to the intellectual and esthetic richness of the European continent. A Hungarian poet, Janus Pannonius, had the same discriminating intelligence and hu- manistic inquisitiveness as his contemporaries in Italy. Erasmus of Rotterdam exerted a profound influence on Hungarian humanists. At the time of the Reformation and anti-Reformation not only did the theologically controversial western vocabulary enter Hungary, but also its complimentary color, a rather harsh humor with religious and ecclesiastical references. In the earlier and later chronicle writers, to judge them from the standpoint of cultural history, one finds an an- ecdotical intelligence that does not show an indifference to western habits and taste, though they pursued their own particular Hungarian themes. Balint Balassa, a Hungarian warrior and poet of the six- teenth century, the first genuine lyric poet of Hungary, (sometimes compared with Francois Villon) could fight like a soldier, dream like a poet, hate like an emotionally disturbed man, show pity, and terror like a humane human being and could entertain and be entertained like a gentleman. Instances are known of his experiences with a gypsy girl in Poland or with another girl in Vienna which are delight-</page><page sequence="10">Hungarian Humor 203 fully and hilariously masculine. In the first part of the eighteenth century a Hungarian writer, Kelemen Mikes, a political emigre in the company of his ruler, Ferenc Rakoczy, wrote letters from Turkey to an assumed relative. These letters, besides being informative, con- tain charming humor, Gallic in its individuality. A western European or an American will discover not only in present-day Hungarian writ- ers, but in those of the past, humorous qualities and conceptions which remind him of home. After all, the mingling of blood and Hun- gary's cultural adjustment to the west were realities which cannot be denied; they produced in the realm of humor psychological paral- lels often unknown or unrecognized by foreigners. It is significant, as Gyula Illyes points out in his excellent book on the Hungarians, that there was an eighteenth-century Hungarian poet of the minor nobility, Mihaly Fazekas, who during the whole of his life was so discerning in his humorous manner that the distinction of belonging to the minor nobility did not flatter his ego. He wrote hexameters to a potato which shows his attachment to the simple things of life. His major work, however, was a comic epic poem en- titled Ludas Matyi, apparently written under the influence of a thir- teenth-century fabliau. The peasant who was whipped by his master, a country gentleman, paid back his score on three different occasions. The democratic tendency of the poem is obvious. Mihaly Csokonai Vitez, eighteenth-century Hungary's greatest lyric poet, also wrote humorous works. Though influenced by Alexander Pope, the couleur locale in his comic epic poem, entitled Dorottya, the story of a spinster, is undeniable. Count Jozsef Gvadanyi's narrative poem about the vil- lage notary who visited the city of Buda is abundant in comic scenes, and represents the outbursts of village moralists against the city. It is a commentary on Hungariars life, explaining much of the dis- tress of that nation, when Hungarians say, "sirva vigad a magyar." (The Magyar's good time is in a tearful laughter.) The fusion of tears and laughter cannot be ignored in the interpretation of Hungarian humor. It is observable in the humor of the common people as well as in those whose social plane is higher. The unfortunate economic status of the people led to devastating poverty, and was caused as, in other European countries, by a wrong relationship of the have's and the have not's. Gyorgy Dozsa, the sixteenth-century Hungarian- Transylvanian peasant leader, raised questions of social justice which had their counterpart in the west of Europe. As to the ruling class, this "tearful laughter" finds explanation in the doubtful security of its own existence. The geographical position of the country made of Hungary a battlefield for ages. Hungary, like Poland, was partitioned</page><page sequence="11">204 Joseph Remenyi in the past. These external dangers were detrimental to the internal peace of the country. When there was peace and calm and little fear of attack by enemy powers, the facts that many parts of the land were devastated by Tartar and Turkish forces and that the ruling class was unwilling or incapable of adjusting conditions led to an intro- spective and tangible uneasiness which fused laughter with tears. Nineteenth-century and early twentieth-century Hungarian writ- ers and poets like Karoly Kisfaludy, Gereben Vas, Moricz Jokai, Lajos Tolnai, Kalman Mikszath, Sipulusz, Ferenc Herczeg, Karoly Eotvos, Geza Gardonyi, Istvan Tomorkeny, and Ferenc Mora por- trayed this tearful laughter of Hungarian humor with more or less success. Some of their humor, especially that of a rather indigenous writer like Gereben Vas, would be abracadabra to foreigners; some of it would be convincing and disarming, as, for instance, the colorful and inexhaustible imagination of Jokai and the satirically inventive and observing mind of Mikszath. There is much anecdotical material in their stories, but they are free of the cheap glory of puns. The anec- dotical quality of their stories indicates the leisureliness of an agrarian civilization; of country gentlemen who smoke long-stemmed pipes; of young people who are good lovers, dancers, and gamblers and who in later life become hearty drinkers who love their country and treat their people paternally, and are sometimes victims of a nationalistic megalomania; they are pleasant hosts, appreciate rich food, and live in an atmosphere that seems to suit them. Only here and there, chiefly in some stories of Mikszath, one detects an anxiety on the part of the writer to arouse them and convince them of their various individual and collective duties. But Mikszath, himself a member of the Hun- garian landed gentry, was too comfortable or, in some respects, too decadent, to go into constructive criticism of his class; evidently con- genital easygoingness and solidarity with his own class prevented him from being a Hungarian Voltaire. The collapse of the war of free- dom in 1848-1849, because of overwhelming Austrian and Russian forces, called for a censure of Hungarian vainglory. Janos Arany, Hungary's classical poet, could be idyllic and humorous in his epic magnum opus, Toldi, especially in a part called "Toldi Esteje" ("Tol- di's Evening"). But the stream of times was such that it carried him into the waters of irony and bitterness; his Nagyidai Ciganyok ("The Gypsies of Nagyida") is a poetic diatribe against those countrymen of his who do not seem to know the difference between applied and declamatory responsibilities. This satirical poem appeared in 1852, at a time when Hungary's independence was practically nil. Nineteenth-century Hungarian humor was conditioned by political</page><page sequence="12">Hungarian Humor 205 illusionism. Even Gardonyi's exaggerated village Justice of Peace, Gabor Gore (Gardonyi had sometimes the farcical taste of Plautus), shared something of the illusion of political power. The Procustean bed of Hungarian politics was enlarged or made smaller according to those whose interests were involved. Austria expected conformity from Hungary; enlightened Hungarian leaders like Count Istvan Szechenyi or Baron Miklos Wesselenyi expected evoluttionary changes, and Baron Jozsef Eotvos and Lajos Kossuth expected revolutionary changes in accord with the doctrines of nineteenth-century liberalism and humanitarianism. The failure of the war of freedom did not pre- vent Hungarians in their hearts from believinlg that the symbolic meaning of freedom remained victorious. In the second part of the nineteenth century, until the outbreak of the World War in 1914, the Austro-Hungarian Anschluss of 1867 functioned well according to some interests, badly according to others. This political affliction re- sulted in the establishment of magazines and weeklies, and led to the art of political caricatures. These political papers, which sometimes aimed to be a combination of Punch and of Jugend plus Hungarian- ism, no doubt fulfilled an important functionl, because they not only published good or bad jokes about marital triangles, misplaced um- brellas, and other provocations for laughter or smiles, but criticized, through caricatures, and through remarks, stories, axioms, epigrams, some of the inconsistencies of Hungarian political life. One element was missing in these publications: real judical objec- tivity. They were political sheets, serving the aim of a political party, and they portrayed truth in the reflection of a deforming mirror. While Hungary did not have caricaturists like Daumier, or Gavarni, or Dore, yet there were Hungarian caricaturists in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries whose intimate association with formlessness found an artistically valuable critical vehicle in their drawings. Janos Janko, Elemer Janko, Akos Garay, Jozsef Farago, Lajos Linek, Dezso Ber, Henrik Major illustrated Borsszern Janko, Bol ond Istok, Ustokos, Kakas Marton and other comic papers, reserving the supreme right of the artist to link up their assigned works with art. They did not portray exclusively political deformities. Gypsy chicken-thieves and rhetorical patriots enabled them to make fun of the two extremes of Hungarian life. Between these two amusing realities there were minor objects of ridicule; for example, the mercantile middle-class in the process of undermining "historical" rights; bloodless aristocrats and old fogies of the gentry; recently acclimatized citizens who maltreated the Hungarian language; women who made the life of the male agree- able or disagreeable; or the plebeian element of the country invading</page><page sequence="13">206 Joseph Remenyi new territories of social life from which heretofore they were excluded. There were editors of humorous sheets and caricaturists who arrived at the conclusion that there is such a thing as class-struggle. V When one compares the liberal political humor, let us say, of Adolf Agai, or the conventional humor of Ede Szigligeti and Gergely Csiky, the playwrights, with the humor of the late nineteenth and with that of the twentieth centuries, one will see an essential difference which is psychological and esthetic. In the second part of the nineteenth cen- tury in some stories and sketches of Sandor Brody and in the works of Zoltan Ambrus one finds finesse, a new symptom in Hungarian hu- mor. Both writers like to portray with a humorous or satirical inten- tion, people floundering about with the exalted sensation of self-im- portance. Brody rather recognized the erratic or erotic heretics of the lower middle-class, or the proletarian and landless peasant and vaga- bond stratum of society; in a larger sense, of course, his "realism" adapted itself to the "respectable" elements or to the artists of mid- dle-class society. Zoltan Ambrus was apt to see the ambivalence of the Hungarian fin de siecle. His wide-awake sensibilities, influenced by French views, resented the mannerisms of parvenues. Finesse, however, was not a sudden innovation; there were signs of it in some Hungarian writers at the time of the Renaissance, Baroque and Rococo era. But a subtle and humorous awareness of sense and non- sense, a proper Hungarian rhythm of complicated perceptions and expressions was a new experience, and it certainly enriched Hunga- rian life and letters. The cultural contribution of Budapest, a city of almost American growth, was remarkable. The peculiar turn that was given to Hun- garian humorous taste, was that of cosmopolitanism, as a proof of Hungary's "modernity." Ferenc Molnar is the most representative literary voice of Budapestian humor. As Charles Lamb is unimagina- ble without London, so is Molnar unimaginable without Budapest, though he now resides in New York. His witty and concise dialogues and articles published in pre-war times in Budapest newspapers, his sentimentalism allied with cynicism, his civilized smoothness spiked by devilish cleverness, his delicately and sometimes artistically con- stituted stories and plays show creative qualities of sophistication. He also wrote children's stories in a humorous vein. For a long time Buda- pest was so much the center of the country, as Paris was in France, that consequently Hungarian humor was conditioned by the intellec- tual and esthetic preponderance of the capital. Humor created outside</page><page sequence="14">Hungarian Humor, 207 of Budapest was considered provincial; this was true, to a degree, but not always so. For example in the stories of Mihaly Cserzy (pen- name: Homok), who lived in Szeged, one could discover a pattern of rural simplicity and joyfulness that had the promise of a minor liter- ary Pieter Bruegel. The pavement-superiority of Budapest neglected the innate humor of the provinces. Then too, in justice to this ques- tion in general, it should be stated that writers and editors of abomi- nable taste and damned with unscrupulous commercial disposition, published books and magazines that contained jokes and yarns of utterly low quality. The Hungarian Treasure Book of Anecdotes, edited by Bela Toth, an excellent and eminent journalist, contained much naYve and much good material. But this book appeared in the first decade of the twentieth century, at which time, and later, much more so, cheap, yellow sheets of artificial "Bohemianism" pretended to be exponents of French esprit and they affected and infected Buda- pest and the countryside. The counterpart of these publications would be certain American monthlies and weeklies, kow-towing to the most vulgar table instincts of human nature. Filth and ignorance are international diseases. Free from the handicaps of conservative Hungarian traditions, yet creating a freedom through humor that became traditional, was the literary art of Frigyes Karinthy. He became known with a book, en- titled Igy Irtok Ti ("Thus you write") somewhat resembling Bret Harte's Condensed Novels. Stephen Leacock's comment on Bret Harte's volume can be used in connection with Karinthy's book: "He achieved a quite unparalleled success in his burlesque stories - the parodies, if one must call them so, in which he imitated the hand and exposed the shortcomings of the great masters of contemporary litera- ture." In Karinthy's book some were "masters," some at the thresh- old of "greatness," but most of them did not rise above the average; it was Karinthy's skill that made them seem more original than they actually were. Karinthy's metaphysical intelligence and imagination is sometimes Swiftian in its rational relation; a confession, like A Journey Around Mly Skull, which is the story of a brain-tumor and of its operation, chronicles of a spirit that knows no limitations from the viewpoint of humorous (though at the same time pathetic) under- standing. The poet and critic Ignotus revealed subtlety and wisdom in his humorous and ironic writings. The poetic universality of Mihaly Babits also possessed the consciousness of paradoxical perspectives; he could write fantastic stories with a comic passion, honoring stupid- ity and hypocrisy by recognizing it with penetrating creative intel- ligence. Dezso Kosztolanyi knew how to amuse and discomfort the</page><page sequence="15">208 Joseph Remenyi civilized selfishness of readers and he did this with an extraordinary insight into human frailties and with charity. The founder of the best Hungarian literary cabaret was Endre Nagy; today the most popular traditional writer of drawing room comedies and of comedies of errors is Kalman Csatho. What Gyula Szekfu, the prominent Hungarian historian, calls the post-war "neo-baroque," produced little orna- mental or involved humor. After 1918 something happened to the cultural life of Hungary to which one should pay special attention. Hungarians, dispersed in the newly established countries of Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia and in enlarged Roumania, were wondering what was really memorable and lasting in the genius of their nation. This same and sane question was asked by Hungarians in Hungary proper. Dimly, and then more clearly, they recognized the inherent artistic qualities of the people, immune to demagogy. They remembered that in the nineteenth cen- tury Janos Kriza and later Elek Benedek revived Transylvanian folktales and fables, thus enabling their successors to understand the symbolic and empirical aim of imaginative gayness and delight. Writers, poets, artists appeared on the horizon of Hungarian life and of that of the Succession States; many of them were educated or un- educated descendants of peasants, and they wished to and sometimes were able to transpose the congenital humor and the comic spirit of the people into the experience of art and literature, shaped by con- sciously applied artistic principles. A Hungarian bibliography of post- war literary and artistic activities would present names of peasant origin in a much greater number than ever before. Rousseau would have been pleased by all this; Apollo less so, because while in the pre- ceding age the gentry and the bourgeois spirit regulated the char- acter of Hungarian humor (too often without esthetic taste) at this period much inferior material was accepted as superior, thereby cater- ing to peasant vanity, but not helping genuine peasant art. Nevertheless, the best of these poets and writers of peasant stock, Gyula Illyes, and Jozsef Erdelyi in Hungary proper, Aron Tamasi in Transylvania, represent admirable qualities of creative integrity, pure humor, impulsive and pensive gayness, and, sometimes, satirical intelligence. Their humor, by its very nature, is primeval, hence rather devoid of the spirit of twentieth-century machinations. This does not mean that their literary art and their smiling sense of propor- tion is not related to contemporariness. Gyula Illyes replaced bucolic sentiments and peasant directness with Marxist dialectics which he no longer uses; Erdelyi's poetry was and still is exposed to present day problems, unfortunately sometimes with undesirable political results;</page><page sequence="16">Hungarian Humor 209 Tamasi's ethical symbols are not fanciful escapes from the present, but implications that the writer is unable and unwilling to degrade his smiling and laughing spirit to the level of mere momentariness. Tamasi created a character by the name of Abel. He is the hero of a trilogy. This young fellow Abel is the incarnation of the Szekely (Transylvanian-Hungarian) people. He is frank, but when necessary cautious; he is obliging, but when necessary, indifferent; he is fond of his natfve soil, but when necessary, he leaves it for a time. Sometimes he is a charming rascal. Abel migrates to America, but returns to Transylvania. He does and says the most unexpected things; he is a practical psychologist; if there is such a paradox, he is a vital stoic, that is, while he accepts the inevitable as a determinist, he still won- ders ... as he likes to be surprised and curiosity is assisting him in his imagination and pragmatic activities. The underlying motive of the novel is the singing and merry courageousness of a people of whom the world knows very little, but who knows the world. VI That Hungarian humor and the conmic spirit is not dead is a good sign of the healthy spirit of the Hungarian people. The fact that this humor, whether it is racial or national or universal, as a rule provokes a smile rather than laughter, shows that Hungarian common sense sees the ridiculous but does not wish to compete with it. It recognizes immanent features of life and living, and it recognizes transitory con- ditions. It jabs at ignoramuses whatever their positions may be, yet it does not claim infallibility. It may indulge in mother-in-law jokes and it may tease Olympian gods. It is collective because it registers the sense of humor of many people; it is personal because it reveals the sense of humor of an individual who is an artist or a writer. It is immeasurable in its quality; it is a part of the creative spirit of Hun- gary. It is Hungarian, Carpathian, European and cosmopolitan; in other words, familar to those who speak the language; familiar in spirit to those who do not speak the language but who capture its essence in translation, and familiar to those who visualize a future of the world without wars and other sadistic separations of nations.
