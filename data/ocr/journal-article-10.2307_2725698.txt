The paper argues that the answer to the title question is no, and that, accordingly, the cost- price performance of the U.S. industrial sector can be described as "competitive." The argu- ment is developed in two steps. First an equa- tion is derived that makes it possible to specify what rates of return would be for leading firms in concentrated markets if the firms priced to maximize current period profits. Then data are presented that show that the rates of return actually generated by typical oligopolists are small fractions of profit-maximizing rates; in- deed, observed rates of return on average ap- proximate percentage capital costs.

T.-Small Firms' Seedbed Role and the Concept of Turbulence "Turbulence" is measured, relating births and deaths in an industry to its starting popula- tion of establishments. The findings support the idea of a "seedbed" of independent small firms challenging existing firms by new activi- ties. In explaining industry variation in turbu- lence, small independent establishments, not firms' subsidiaries, are important. Entry barri- ers, profits, and concentration are not. Turbu- lent industries tend to have novel products. In concentrated industries, newcomers tend to be subsidiaries. Turbulence is greater with industry growth, probably because high birth and death rates coincide.

Galbraith, James K.-Galbraith and the The- ory of the Corporation John Kenneth Galbraith's professional col- leagues have taken a long time, and a circui- tous road, to arrive where he stood fifteen years ago before the void, which is-economics per- tinent to the modern corporation. The essence of that void is the underdevelopment in eco- nomics of a theory of power. Power relations, not market relations, are the heart of the cor- poration and its dealings with other corpora- tions, government and labor, and often also with the consumer. Without a theory of power, no theory of the modern corporation can go beyond the anthropomorphism of the neoclas- sical view. It is perhaps not so strange, there- fore, that Galbraith's own theoretical develop- ment has led him from The New Industrial State to The Anatomy of Power. One might hope that the elaboration of a theory of the corporation will now pick up again from here. J Post Keynesian Econ., Fall 1984, 7(1), pp. 43-60. U.S. Congress, Joint Economic Commit- tee.

The empirical results of this study indirectly lend support to a plausible hypothesis that a small group of firms makes a big impact on the pro- ductivity of an initially unconcentrated indus- try and thereby concentrates it. Later, the small firms imitate the now big firms, and con- centration goes down while productivity keeps rising. J. Polit. Econ., Dec. 1984, 92(6), pp. 1035-48.

First it proposes the FARE acronym in place of the confusing</page><page sequence="3">1036 Journal of Economic Literature term "contestability" and "brief entry" in place of "hit-and-run entry." It then suggests that FARE analysis adds little to the established entry and exit literature. Key FARE points (such as exit-dominated monopoly) are illogical because they rest on contradictory assump- tions about entry and response. FARE analysis restricts the reach of the "invisible hand," and it lacks significant facts and cases to reverse the lessons of mainstream research.

Smirlock, Michael; Gilligan, Thomas and Mar- shall, William-Tobin's q and the Structure- Performance Relationship The "traditional" interpretation of the struc- ture-conduct-performance relationship asserts that market concentration fosters collusion and allows firms to earn monopoly rents. The "effi- cient structure" hypothesis argues that concen- tration emerges from competition and is the result of the superior efficiency of leading firms. This paper conducts an empirical test of these hypotheses. A major innovation is the use of Tobin's q, which mitigates or eliminates the shortcomings of accounting rates of return, to measure firm rents.

Each ac- quisition eliminated a major rival in a well de- fined product line and significantly increased concentration, providing an example where discernible price effects might be expected. Circumstances regarding the production of the two products and the availability of transaction price data allow a relatively straightforward test for price effects.

The al- ternative "pure" signals considered are quan- tity instructions and price signals either to pro- ducer or consumer. "Mixed" signals are also analyzed, combining a quantity signal for one good with a price signal for another. The re- sults depend on the interaction of substitutabil- ity/complementarity in consumption and pro- duction with errors in supply and demand estimation. The author shows that (with at least two goods) there is always some mixed set of signals superior to pure quantity signals; but pure price signals cannot be eliminated in the same way. Z.

In this article, the authors develop a comprehen- sive methodology for analyzing residential time-of-use rates and contrast this methodol- ogy with the approaches previously taken. They apply this methodology to a study of residential time-of-use rates for four Illinois electric utilities. They conclude from this analysis that the time-of-use rates are not cost justified. Furthermore, they show the large errors that can result from using the incom- plete approaches: Coauthors are: Laurits R. Christensen, Philip E. Schoech, and Wallace Hendricks. J.

Ronald and Koenker, Roger W.- Costs and Benefits of Peak-Load Pricing of Electricity: A Continuous-Time Economet- ric Approach The authors address the following question of current policy interest: would the efficiency gains from residential time-of-use pricing for electricity exceed the metering costs necessi- tated by these more complex rates? A continu- ous-time model of consumer preferences for daily electricity consumption is estimated based on data from the North Carolina Rate Experiment. A model of long-run electricity costs-viewed as a function of the daily load cycle-is constructed based on engineering data. The models of demand and cost are com- bined to compute solutions to several optimal pricing problems and to estimate the potential long-run welfare gain from several alternative time-of-use pricing policies, including policies incorporating so-called "demand charges." De- mand charges, while they are quite successful in smoothing the demand cycle, are not as suc- cessful as conventional pricing policies in achieving the welfare objective.

The authors find a significant response of households to TOD rates through appliance purchases.

They model taste differ- ences across households in a variance compo- nents framework and derive an iterative esti- mator, which is relatively easy to compute, for systems of demand equations with vari- ance components. Finally, they present an example of the methods, which involves time-of-day pricing of electricity. They are able to calculate the fraction of the population that would prefer such pricing policies to flat rate pricing. J Econometrics, Sept./ Oct. 1984, 26(1/2), pp. 65-82.

Makhija, Anil K. and Thompson, Howard E.- Capitalized Interest and the Cost of Money to Electric Utilities One hypothesis suggested that AFUDC earnings are valued less than non-AFUDC earnings because of regulatory risks. But valua- tion of AFUDC may also be affected by tax laws, which reduce the cost of equity in some instances. Risk and tax effects are examined with a valuation model that accounts for AFUDC. Data for electric utilities reveal no unambiguous risk effect and weak support for the tax effect. The latter is minor in valuation. This paper suggests that the cost of equity capi- tal will be unaffected by elimination of AFUDC in favor of inclusion of CWIP in the rate base. Land Econ., Aug. 1984, 60(3), pp. 278-91.

Parks, Richard W. and Weitzel, David-Mea- suring the Consumer Welfare Effects of Time-differentiated Electricity Prices The paper derives measures of the consumer welfare effects of a change from flat- to time- differentiated prices for electricity using July 1977 data from the Wisconsin Residential Time-of-Use Electricity Pricing Experiment. Preferences are assumed to be homothetically separable, and generalized Leontief condi- tional demand functions are estimated for four distinct time periods. Conditional elasticities of substitution are small, but significant. Wel- fare effects of the experimental price changes are small because price changes were designed to be revenue-neutral. The data show evidence of a "treatment" effect, which is not explained by a standard neoclassical model of consumer choice. J Econometrics, Sept. / Oct. 1984, 26(1 / 2), pp. 35-64.

Relative peak loads declined about one percentage point on average when TOD rates were introduced. A small fraction of customers reduced their peak loads a lot, but most customers have ap- parently not changed their consumption pat- terns in response to TOD rates. Average change in load differs significantly by utility, industry, and year, and those changes are sta- tistically related to the terms of the time-of- day rates. Changes in load, while small in percentage terms, are large enough to justify TOD rates on a benefit/cost evaluation. J. Econometrics, Sept./Oct. 1984, 26(1/2), pp. 229-52.

At the same time, they attempt to prod the enterprises to- ward a set of government goals. The resulting relationships between ministers and managers have produced a pattern of behavior by state- owned enterprises that differs considerably at times from those of private enterprises. But articulating the goals of the government in ways that are internally consistent has proved difficult, as has securing the benefits of auton- omy. Some governments are attempting to im- prove the relationship with their state-owned enterprises by developing explicit agreements, even contracts, between ministers and manag- ers. Although this approach does not face up to some basic problems in the manager-minis- ter relationship, it cannot be ruled out as a significant step in improving the link. j Policy Anal.

A simple two-market model shows that discrimi- nation can be expected in a wide variety of circumstances, and differential prices alone are not therefore a very useful guide to the under- lying motives of the firm. British Rail is seen to be an industry well suited to discriminatory pricing, subject to the possibility of customer resentment becoming a significant factor. J. Transp. Econ.

In Czechoslovakia, where management of the economy was more centralized than in Hun- gary and Poland, a policy of promoting produc- tion and export of nuclear equipment was ef- fectively carried out; other product groups were less successful. In Poland, bureaucratic resistance undermined the implementation of industrial policies (which were never unambig- uously formulated). The Hungarian policy was chiefly oriented toward import substitution. The statistical evidence gives only weak sup- port for the effective conduct of industrial poli- cies in these countries. J.

A firm with a large cost advantage may license its technology because doing so will reduce the rival's incentive to develop its own, possibly better technology. From the firms' collective viewpoint, licensing saves excessive expendi- tures that would be incurred in the absence of licensing opportunities. In contrast to theo- ries in which R&amp;D deters entry into the prod- uct market, firms are induced into the product market to deter them from R&amp;D activity. Amer. Econ.

Iwai, Katsuhito-Schumpeterian Dynamics, Part II: Technological Progress, Firm Growth and 'Economic Selection' In this paper, the second in the series on Schumpeterian dynamics, the author con- structs a simple mathematical model, which is capable of studying the evolution of an indus- try's state of technology as a dynamic outcome of the interactions among innovation, imita- tion, and capacity growth at the micro level of firms. The doctrine of "economic selection" insists, by means of the analogy to the biologi- cal theory of natural selection, that only the most efficient firms will survive the long-run competitive struggle for capacity growth. If the possibility of technological imitation is al- lowed for the firms, the industry will settle down to a static equilibrium of perfect techno- logical knowledge, not by the success of the</page><page sequence="8">Selected Abstracts 1041 most efficient firms in their striving for the higher growth rate, but by the success of the less efficient in their effort to imitate the others. The blind force of economic selection is thus outwitted by the human force of imitative ac- tivities. Finally when firms are allowed to inno- vate in their technology, the selective force of market competition is no longer capable of weeding out the less fit even in the long run. Indeed, it is shown that the dynamic interplay of the processes of innovation, imitation, and growth will reproduce in the long run a rela- tive dispersion of efficiencies across firms in a statistically balanced form.

The economic findings pro- vide additional insights into the nature of the production structure of the textile industry during the postwar period. The author finds that the textile industry production process is nonhomogeneous and of a variable elasticity of substitution. In general, overall productivity growth averages around 4.1 percent per year from 1957 to 1978. Since the industry is very labor-intensive, the low estimates of the elastic- ity of substitution suggest capital is not readily substituted for labor. Weltwirtsch.

This paper defines these changes as depletion and measures depletion in two ways: first, by how much lower extraction costs would be had there been no depletion and sec- ond, by mineral royalties, a market signal of depletion. A test was conducted to determine if the pace of copper, oil, and coal depletion (as defined by the first measure) is faster or slower than is warranted by market royalty payments in those industries. The results of this test suggest that mineral royalty markets regulate mineral depletion efficiently and that the pace of depletion is optimal in a neoclassi- cal sense.
