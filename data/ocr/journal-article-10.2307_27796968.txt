<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE PHENOMENOLOGY AND PEDAGOGY OF READING: AN EXAMPLE FROM AFRICAN DRAMA Edward A. Sere The link" between reading and pedagogy as human activities is to be found in the observation that they both make us reflect and induce us to use our imagination creatively. In this paper I propose to relate the reading process to the teaching process and thus to clarify the relationship between phenomenology and pedagogy. As a focus for this inquiry into the relationship between phenome nology and pedagogy, I will use the most recent play written by Wole Soy inka, Death and the King's Horseman. After summarizing and interpreting the play I will demonstrate how reading enables us to see the relationship between phenomenology (or, more broadly, philosophy) and teaching, and how both of these help students to learn and to write. The Play and Its Interpretation The play is based on actual events which took place in 1946 in Oyo, an ancient Yoruba city of Nigeria. The main characters are Elesin Oba, the King's Chief Horseman; his son Olunde; and Simon Pil kings, the Colonial District Officer. The major confrontation occurs in the play when Pilkings learns that native law and custom require that when a king dies, his chief horseman must commit suicide in order to accompany the king to heaven. The King has died thirty days earlier and while plans are being made for Elesin's ritual sui cide, Simon Pilkings is determined to prevent it. Olunde, having heard of the King's death, returns from England where he has been studying medicine, a situation made possible by Pilkings. Olunde is quite prepared for his father's suicide, and he and Pilkings clash over Pilking's plan to interfere. The results are disastrous.1 Soyinka prepares the reader, and anyone who would direct his play, for a creative adventure when he warns that no one must read into the play a "clash of cultures" or any other preconceived no tion. Rather, he enjoins the reader (or director) to aim at the more difficult task of bringing out what is essential in the play and which is latent in the threnody, or song of lamentation, as given in the play. When a reader does this, Soyinka insists, he will find that "the confrontation in the play is largely metaphysical, contained in the</page><page sequence="2">230 THE JOURNAL OF GENERAL EDUCATION human vehicle which is Elesin and the universe of the Yoruba mind?the world of the living, the dead and the unborn, and the numinous passage which links all: transition." The artistic or creative work of the author begins to emerge when Olunde poses to Pilkings a problem of justification for Pilkings' action in wanting to prevent the suicide. The episode occurs in Scene Four when dialogue between Olunde and Pilkings' wife cen ters on the conduct and courage of the British during World War II.2 Here it is disclosed how a captain deliberately blows up his ship and himself with it. But this is suicide. "The ship had to be blown up" we are told, "because it had become dangerous to the other ships, even to the city itself. Hundreds of the coastal population would have died."3 In this brief episode, the Pilkings are confronted with the reality of self-sacrifice as a part of their own mores and culture, which rules out any glib talk about a "clash of cultures" as an explanation for Pilkings' opposition to the prescribed death of the King's Horse man. Is it possible, however, that Mr. Pilkings was motivated by a higher sense of morality?respect or reverence for human life?to oppose the ritual suicide? In reply to this question, we are told that the British culture condones mass suicide in war.4 And as Olunde points out, the blasphemy is not removed when "murderous defeats are described as strategic victories."5 Again, the question of moral ity is met by a recollection of the horrors of slavery and the conduct of the British towards the slaves.6 But could we attribute Pilkings' desire to interfere with the ritual suicide to a high personal sense of values or morals? Not really, for there is nothing in his conduct to suggest this. Pilkings betrays his standard of morality when he says (to Iy aloja), "... my men have orders to shoot at the first sign of trouble."7 To which Iyaloja replies, "To prevent one death you will actually make other deaths? Ah, great is the wisdom of the white race. . . ."8 Soy inka leads us to believe that there is nothing to be found in Pilkings' culture which gives him "the right to pass judge ment on other peoples and their ways. Nothing at all."9 Moreover, the Britisher's interference with the ritual suicide is not explained by reference to a disparity in culture or to a clash in a standard or sense of values. But the question remains: why does Pilkings choose to interfere with the ritual suicide, and to prevent it, if he can? It is not enough to say Pilkings is acting on orders. For the force of the question is directed precisely to the purpose of instituting such an order against</page><page sequence="3">THE PHENOMENOLOGY AND PEDAGOGY OF READING 231 a practice entrenched in the Yoruba culture. To come to grips with this question, we must examine the reality of self-sacrifice in both the British and the Yoruba cultures. What they share in common is that both hold up self-sacrifice as a virtue. The captain deliberately chooses to commit suicide in order to protect the lives of a large population. Similarly, Elesin is determined to commit suicide to guide the King's passage in the netherworld so that the well-being of his tribe, living and unborn, might be preserved. If self-sacrifice as a virtue is not foreign to the thinking of Pil kings, however, then what is the source of his problem concerning Elesin's ritual suicide? It is, I feel, with the level ofbelief associated with Elesin's ritual suicide. It is easy for Pilkings, and for that mat ter any of us, to see why a captain might sacrifice himself in order to spare a city and the people in it from destruction by the explosion of a load of deadly weapons in the ship. The belief that a people might be saved by the captain's suicide is a belief on the commonsense level. Consequently, the suicide committed by the captain is readily accepted by Pilkings?and perhaps by all of us?as a courageous and altruistic act. The case is different, however, when we examine the belief asso ciated with Elesin's ritual suicide. This belief, as revealed in many parts of the play, is tied to the unseen world?the world of the dead and the unborn. The contrast between this belief and the earlier one is the difference between a belief that lies beyond the bound of sense and one within it. One is a commonsense belief and hence empiri cal; the other belief is metaphysical. One can be shown to be either true or false. The other belief, in contrast, is metaphysical and can neither be shown to be true nor proven false. Soy inka is correct, then, when he insists that the confrontation in the play is largely metaphysical. Probing into Pilkings' problem demonstrates the point the author is making. Consider, if you will, the metaphysical belief about the existence of God. Some of us be lieve that God exists, other do not. The agonizing experience here is that neither of these conflicting beliefs is susceptible to any objec tive proof. The philosophers of the Middle Ages, and even philoso phers in relatively modern time, have learned this simple truth the hard way. The interesting point here is that, if God exists, His exis tence must somehow be open to human experience if we are to talk meaningfully about Him. Yet the proof of God's existence lies pre cisely in experience which at best is subjective. Nevertheless, it would be naive, if not downright foolish, to brand the philosophers of the Middle Ages as simple-minded or superstitious in their belief</page><page sequence="4">232 THE JOURNAL OF GENERAL EDUCATION about God simply because we do not understand why they enter tained the belief. The crux of Pilkings' problem lies here. Pilkings' problem is that he simply does not know what to do with a belief he does not understand. In one instance he is complacent in treating such a belief lightly, as symbolized by his desecration of a Yoruba mask.10 Later, he allows his emotion to get the better part of his reason by engaging in a wanton destruction of the object associ ated with Yoruba belief. This point is significant. Recall that Pilkings is prepared to shoot down those who oppose his efforts to prevent the ritual suicide. This intent on Pilkings' part betrays the underlying motive for his interference with the suicide ritual. The point is that, by his determination to kill many people to save one life, Pilkings shows that he is not so much concerned with the sanctity of life itself (be it Elesin's or any other) as he is eager to destroy a custom, and hence a belief, whose significance he cannot begin to fathom. In matters affecting any belief that transcends the commonsense level, Pilkings prefers to eliminate the belief rather than to struggle to understand it. Symbolically, then, Pilkings is any person who allows his commonsense orientation towards life to dis tort his higher vision of the world. His behavior epitomizes a clash between an empirical view of life and a transcendental one. And Elesin is not merely an African courtier, but is a fitting character to dramatize for us this universal experience. The Problem of Death Reflect upon the title of the play?Death and the King's Horseman. The stress is on death, death as it relates to the ritual of the King's Horseman. How can we get at the fundamental problem which is hidden in this plot? A plausible approach would be to probe into the plight of the leading character?Elesin, the King's Horseman?and to see if we can discover levels of beliefs about death which may account for his suffering. Portions of the play provide an opportu nity for this approach. In particular, Scene Three and Scene Five of the play relate to the death ritual.11 In Scene Three12 Elesin ap proaches death joyfully, aided by a sophisticated ritual of songs and dances. With the aid of this ritual, Elesin passes gradually through different levels of consciousness. His ability to function on the con scious level becomes weaker and weaker as the ritual progresses. On this occasion the ritual is fated for an abrupt termination, but we witness enough of it to conclude that, in the context of this ritual, death can only mean a change from one level of consciousness to another. Death in Scene Three means transition, the bridge which links the seen world (the world of the living) to the unseen (the</page><page sequence="5">THE PHENOMENOLOGY AND PEDAGOGY OF READING 233 world of the dead and the unborn). Later, throughout Scene Five,13 Elesin is in a state of despondency culminating in the violent act that puts an end to his life. Here death is a plague?the destroyer of life. Clearly, there is a conflict in the meanings of death which emerge from the two scenes. In Scene Five, the conception of death is crude and anthropomorphic. Death is seen as a thing to fear and as a means of escape from the unpleasant realities of life. Opposed to this is the refined earlier conception of death, as a natural state pro viding opportunity for further engagement with an important di mension of existence. This earlier idea of death should bring joy as one who believes in it approaches death. In contrast, the anthropo morphic conception of death can only generate fear as death ap proaches. Obviously, the conception of death in Scene Five fits into our commonsense belief system. By contrast, the meaning of death in Scene Three goes beyond the ordinary level of thinking of the European philosophical or metaphysical realm.14 The action in Scene Three can only be described as (1) death ritual, while the event in Scene Five fits the description of (2) a murder or violent suicide. Moreover, the distinction between the two is, respectively, the difference between the sacred and the pro fane. In Scene Two15 Joseph elucidates this difference when he tells Pilkings that Elesin "will not kill anybody and no one will kill him. He will simply die." Compare what Joseph says in Scene Two with what Iyaloja and Praise-Singer say in Scene Three about the King's Horseman: "It takes an Elesin to die the death of death . . . Only Elesin . . . dies the unknowable death of death . . . Gracefully, gracefully does the horseman regain the stables at the end of day, gracefully . . . ."l6 Again, "A child returning homewards craves no leading by the hand. . . . Gracefully does the mask dance Homeward at the end of day, gracefully . . . ,"17 We must ever be vigilant in distinguishing between a death ritual of the African, as explicated here, and a murder. What the explication of the death ritual and murder brings out is that the plight of Elesin centers upon the relation between his con flicting beliefs about death. But to say this is to say that Elesin's problem (not to mention the suffering associated with it) is largely metaphysical. The conflict arises because the two beliefs about death belong to different levels of thinking, even though they are held simutaneously by the same person. But a mind in such conflict can only generate a destructive skepticism. Doubt, in a philosophi cal sense, is a symptom of a mind divided against itself. It is the basis of confusion (normal cases) and of psychosis (abnormal cases). This is the crux of Elesin's woes.</page><page sequence="6">234 THE JOURNAL OF GENERAL EDUCATION That a destructive error in thinking, and hence in action, is basic to Elesin's agony is supported in Scene Five when Elesin attempts to pinpoint the ground for his difficulties and confusions. Elesin, giving a matter-of-fact reply to Iyaloja's chastisement, laments, My powers deserted me. My charms, my spells, even my voice lacked strength when I made to summon the powers that would lead me over the last measure of earth into the land of the flesh less.18 Later, raising the question as to why this woe betides him, he says: It is when the alien hand pollutes the source of will, when a stranger force of violence shatters the mind's calm resolution, this is when a man is made to commit in his thought the un speakable blasphemy of seeing the hand of the gods in this alien rupture of his world. I know it was this thought that killed me, sapped my powers and turned me into an infant in the hands of unnamable strangers. I made to utter my spells anew but my tongue merely rattled in my mouth . . . and all because I had committed this blasphemy of thought?that there might be the hand of the gods in a stranger's intervention.19 The "alien of his world" is, of course, Elesin's lower level of belief which has come to shatter his higher vision of death and dying. And the reason for this is, as he says, "that there might be the hand of the gods in a stranger's intervention." But why does Elesin describe the thought as a "blasphemy"? The thought is blasphemous because his belief "that there might be the hand of the gods in a stranger's intervention" is merely assumed by Elesin. He has no valid ground for entertaining this belief. And yet it is this belief which is fundamental to his fall. Basic to the plight of Elesin is the problem of assumption. An assumption or belief becomes a problem when the belief is false and yet the person holding it acts upon the belief as if it were true. In this case, Elesin has inherited a profound tradition concerning a belief about death, but he has not inherited the corresponding deep knowl edge which underlies the belief. A profound knowledge about death should generate a profound appreciation of life in much the same way as our experience of darkness enables us to enjoy and appreci ate the presence of light. In fact, what a metaphysical interpretation of the play leads us to see is that the death ritual, in its pristine form, is a clear demonstration of the meaning of death as only a transition and therefore an affirmation of the immortality of human life. In</page><page sequence="7">THE PHENOMENOLOGY AND PEDAGOGY OF READING 235 deed, the ritual is a demonstration that life can neither be destroyed nor created. Life simply is. Insofar as Elesin's conflicting beliefs about death are incompati ble with each other he remains skeptical, and the meaning of the idea of death is lost to him as long as this doubt is sustained. Central to the plight of Elesin is his confusion about the meaning of death. With his loss of certainty goes the corresponding loss of an appro priate part of the ritual, loss of the knowledge associated with it, and loss of the power that is generated in the application of the knowledge. This is tragedy. Death and the King's Horseman is not a tragedy of individual limitation. Although the tragedy is linked with a loss of ritual and the corresponding knowledge, the ritual belongs to a whole people. And because the ritual is a ritual of music and dances, it is a choric tragedy. Altogether the tragedy is a social one. With this realization it becomes easy for us to understand why the lives of Elesin, Olunde, and the Pilkings are intertwined. They all share a common element in their problems and agonies, namely, the problem of as sumption described earlier. The characters appear to need one an other in order to reflect and amplify this fundamental flaw in human nature. And we, as spectators, need them that they may mirror to us our natural inclination to be in bondage to beliefs which are false and to act upon them as if they were true. Elesin, Olunde and Pilkings are bound together for another rea son: to generate Yoruba life. Culture is not static, but constitutes a dynamic social force whose social justification for a continued exis tence lies precisely in the capacity of its ideas to educate. The Pil kings arrive at a crucial moment in the history of the tribe and are a fitting channel to bring about needed change, notwithstanding their erroneous ideas about the death ritual. Similarly, the fate of Olunde and that of Elesin together serve to impress upon the tribe the urgent need for change, for it is difficult to reconcile what is learned (from Iyaloja and the Praise-Singer) about the role of an Elesin with the performance of Elesin Oba, whose actions culminated in violent suicide.21 However, it is hinted that even if the Pilkings were not there, society would have corrected itself anyway. Soyinka gets this point across succintly when he says: The principal character of Death and the King's Horseman has therefore been saved a nasty end on the gallows and, one hopes, was also reprieved from the gallows of public opinion. For, as the District Officer (Pilkings) himself reminds the doomed</page><page sequence="8">236 THE JOURNAL OF GENERAL EDUCATION Horseman, a proverb of the Yoruba does protest: "The elder grimly approaches heaven and you ask him to bear your greet ings yonder; do you think he makes the journey willingly?" At the heart of the lyric and the dance of transition in Yoruba tragic art, that core of ambivalence is always implanted. This is how society, even on its own, reveals and demonstrates its capacity for change.22 Olunde serves as the character that links the plight of Elesin to a fundamental crisis in the world today. This association emerges in Scenes Four and Five, wherein Olunde discovers the basic flaw in Elesin's character. Elesin, the mighty one, falls simply because there is a gap between what he has inherited from tradition and his outer shell of knowledge about death. The deeper meaning eludes him. The shock that Olunde receives upon the frustration of his assumptions concerning his father is so severe as to be fatal. A Phenomenological Interpretation Elesin's plight is directly relevant to a fundamental crisis in our time: the crisis of quality in our education. The symptoms of this crisis are commonplace. For example, though many universities throughout the world no longer have genuine programs in liberal education, they still confer on their graduates liberal arts degrees. Consider, too, the common practice of calling a janitor a building engineer, without his having attained the knowledge that a building engineer would have. The errors in such instances, as in the play, lie in one or another assumption. In the play it is assumed that the profound knowledge of an Elesin is transmitted by blood rather than being learned here on earth by one who aspires to be an Elesin. In our time it is wrongly assumed that we change the man by merely changing a title or by conferring it upon the person. I have deliberately focused upon a philosophical interpretation of the play, but it can be discussed from other points of view (social, political, artistic, aesthetic) as well. Clearly, Death and the King's Horseman is a classic in every meaningful sense of that term. It is a classic tragedy. Death and the King's Horseman takes us to one fundamental of human existence?death?and its counterpart?life. In so doing, Soyinka has transformed an incident of local interest into an expres sion of a universal human experience. Soyinka thus reveals himself not only as an artist but as a poet and philosopher as well. Along the way, he urges his audience to probe into an African culture with open-mindedness.</page><page sequence="9">THE PHENOMENOLOGY AND PEDAGOGY OF READING 237 We have demonstrated the idea and meaning of reading as a crea tive process by means of a formal interpretation of Death and the King's Horseman. Let us turn now to examine more closely the reading process itself. Wolfgang Iser summarises our interaction with a text very well when he says: The unwritten aspects of apparently trivial scenes and the un spoken dialogue within "turns and twists" not only draw the reader into action, but also lead him to shade in the many out lines suggested by the given situation, so that these take on a reality of their own. But as the reader's imagination animates these "outlines," they in turn will influence the effect of the unwritten part of the text. Thus begins a whole dynamic pro cess: the written text imposes certain limits on its unwritten implications in order to prevent these from becoming too blurred and hazy, but at the same time these implications, worked out by the reader's imagination, set the given situation against a background which endows it with far greater signifi cance than it might have seemed to possess on its own. In this way, trivial scenes suddenly take on the shape of an "enduring form of life." What constitutes this form is never named, let alone explained in the text, although in fact it is the end product of the interaction between text and reader.23 By sharing with you my own experience in reading Death and the King 's Horseman y my hope is to farther clarify this interactive pro cess. Before reading a book in its entirety, I usually taste it by scan ning some selected portion, or by simply reading its summary on the cover of the book?as I did here. Immediately, I recalled a word in Yoruba which relates to the idea and meaning of an Elesin or the Chief Horseman of the King. The word is "abobaku". Translated literally, the word "abobaku" means "one who dies with the king." But the idiomatic meaning of "abobaku" is "obse quiousness" or "one who readily complies with the will of another no matter how distasteful." The authentic deeper meaning of an Elesin is now lost, and only the pejorative sense of it remains to the Yorubas of today. However, reading with an open mind Death and the King 's Hoseman we can all see that the original meaning and role of an Elesin is far removed from obsequiousness and a slavish obedience to a questionable custom and tradition. But suppose that, in reading the text, I had permitted the com monsense meaning of an Elesin as an "abobaku" (an obsequious individual) to guide and control my thinking? The result would have been disastrous. I could not have been able to penetrate the illusions</page><page sequence="10">238 THE JOURNAL OF GENERAL EDUCATION created by the author. Consequently, I would have failed to gain anything from the reading except a reaffirmation of my original limiting prejudices. To succeed, I am obliged to put out of my mind, temporarily at least, the commonsense meaning of that term in order to gain access to and grasp its less accessible metaphysical meaning. This is what we mean by "suspension of beliefs:" banishment of all preconceptions that may interfere with the legitimate power of the text. This requirement holds true even in reading a text in mathe matics or in physical science. I should remain confused about the meaning of "a point" in geometry if I allow my mind to be gov erned and dominated by the commonsense meaning of point as a place of limited but real space. The same thing applies to the read ing of a theory about color, for example, in science. "Suspension of beliefs" also requires that I keep out of the work the life story of the author. In addition, I must push to the back ground my own personal disposition. Having done all this, I am now left with the world of the text, so to speak. Inasmuch as this world has an existence all its own, it can be regarded as a realm of consciousness. This realm is an alien world. If I am to make any thing out of it, I must transform it into a part of my world by grasp ing the thoughts of the author. But in making the "alien" thought my own, I thereby obliterate a sharp distinction between "author" and "reader" or "subject" and "object." As a result, at this point I am prepared to reflect, to think the idea through on my own. But if I am to be successful in my interpretation of a literary work, I must endeavor to interpret any portion of it in the light of the whole text. The significance of these processes can be illustrated by reference to my own experience on seeing Death and the King's Horseman performed on the stage. The stage setting was a market. In Yoruba this "market" is associated metaphorically with the idea of "mother." These two concepts appear in the title 'Mother'-of-the market or Iyaloja (literally "Iya" means "mother" and "loja" means "of the market"). But what are we to understand by the association of these two disparate referents? "Mother" ("Iya") has to do with the bringing into this world of a human life, and nuturing and caring for it. By extension, mother hood covers the passage into this world of any life, as well as the protection and care for life. This interpretation is valid because we project and apply the concept of mothering to plants and animals and even to insects. When a life ceases, we bury the dead remains in the ground or simply leave them to rot and decay. In effect, the dead body is consigned back to the womb of Mother Nature. Here again the idea of mother is associated with protection and transformation, for the</page><page sequence="11">THE PHENOMENOLOGY AND PEDAGOGY OF READING 239 remains are converted back into the elements of nature whence they came. In birth, then, there is the idea of motherhood as a nurturing of life and the passage through which life comes to be. In death is the idea of motherhood as a medium of conversion and transforma tion of one element into another coinciding with the function of a mother in the period of pregnancy and gestation. Consequently, it is befitting for a woman to be chosen to participate in the ritual associ ated with death and life, to be called "mother" regardless of whether in real life she is anyone's parent. Market as a concept has to do with buying and selling of products. The idea of market is thus connected with objects used in sustaining human life. But it is also from the market that we purchase other items for taking care of other lives, namely, plants and animals. Therefore the market is a source of supplies for life. This is pre cisely the role of Iyaloja ("Mother"-of-the-market) in the play. We can now understand why Iyaloja is surrounded by many women and men in the play, all said to be her children. For in her role as Iyaloja, she is indeed mother of all in a pure and fundamental sense of that term: one serving as a passage for life as well as serving for the nurturing and transformation of life. But this is the metaphysical or philosophical meaning of mother. This analysis of Iyaloja helps us to see how Death and the King 's Horseman is rich in symbolism as well. For just as mother is associ ated with market in the title Iyaloja, so also are horses associated with the chiefs in the service of the King. But "esin" (horse) carries the burden of man and "Elesin" (the Chief Horseman of the King) is accordingly expected to carry the burden of the tribe and the race. Making discoveries, or bringing out from the obvious that which is not obvious, is what phenomenology is all about. This aspect of philosophy concerns itself with objects?with phenomena?with a view toward gaining appropriate knowledge about them. Any such inquiry is a legitimate philosophical inquiry only if the solution can be grasped by no other means except thinking. The essence of phe nomenological description lies in interpretation. Teaching Death and the King's Horseman Teaching is a creative activity. Its goal is to communicate an experi ence. But, more importantly, teaching must be done in such a way as to make learning a creative experience for the student. This is where the challenge in teaching comes in, and it is what distin guishes teaching from mere instruction.24 Let me illustrate my two points about teaching with an example. Suppose I were to teach Death and the King's Horseman. The first</page><page sequence="12">240 THE JOURNAL OF GENERAL EDUCATION requirement is for me to read and understand the play?otherwise I should have nothing to give to the student. Then comes the problem of how to present the knowledge I have gained from my reading of the play in such a way as to make learning a creative experience for my students. If I am to be successful in teaching Death and the King 's Horse man, I must lead the students to uncover as I did, for example, the philosophical meaning of "mother" in the title Iyaloja or "Mother"-of-the-market. To accomplish this end, I must engage their imaginations. I may therefore employ dialogue as ?. method of teaching (the Socratic method); I can spice the lecture with meta phor and allegories (the ancient method used in the Bible); or, I can make use of story and riddle techniques. What all these methods share is that they allow me to create gaps in my analysis of the play. ? must not tell all I know about the work if learning is to be a creative experience for the student. In creating gaps in my analysis of the play, I throw the students back upon themselves, forcing them to think and to use their imaginations creatively. In effect I have assumed a position comparable to that of the author when he was writing the play. And, just as the author has to bear in mind the kind of audience for whom he is writing, so must I not lose sight of the grade and level of understanding of the students I am teaching. Teaching, learning, writing, and reading can all be seen as creative activities. Success in teaching and in the phenomenological realm of philos ophy is governed by a common structure of creativity. The value of teaching and phenomenology is that both make us to reflect and to use our imaginations creatively. In bringing out the unity between teaching and phenomenology, and the juncture of these with learn ing, writing, and reading, my hope is that a good phenomenology of reading may produce a good pedagogy of reading.

The transmission of vital ideas is the role of formal education both in the oral tradition (ancient) and in the written tradition (modern). 21.
