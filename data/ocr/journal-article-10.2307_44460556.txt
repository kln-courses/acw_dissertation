<plain_text><page sequence="1">650171 Human Tolerance to Impact - Basis for Safety Design Lawrence M. Patrick Department of Engineering Mechanics, Wayne State University INCREASED EMPHASIS is currently being placed on auto- mobile safety as evidenced by a nationwide drive for in- stallation and use of seat belts, safety legislation under con- sideration or already passed at both the local and national level, technical groups organized to promote and disseminate research results on safety, and, most significantly, increased importance placed on safety by the automobile manufacturers . If maximum benefits are to accrue from this widespread ef- fort, the syndrome of impact trauma must be thoroughly un- derstood, not from the viewpoint of how to cure the disease (this is the physician's domain), but from the standpoint of understanding the mechanics of how the injury is produced. Ultimately , the degree of injury from any given set of im- pact conditions must be translated into quantitative design data so that the design engineer can design safer vehicles, and the test engineer can evaluate their safety character- istics. The purpose of this paper is to: 1. Present some of the fundamental principles of crash safety. 2. Discuss the different categories of impact injury from an engineering viewpoint. 3. Point out the major injury-producing components in the passenger compartment. 4. Review some of the methods and programs currently employed to establish quantitative human tolerance levels. FUNDAMENTALS OF CRASH SAFETY In many ways the human body is remarkably tough, dur- able , and able to absorb punishment without permanent in- ABSTRACT jury. Records of falls from great heights in which the individ- uals survived, sometimes with only minor injuries, prove that survival of impacts at great speed and violence is pos- sible. Why, then, do some people survive such violent im- pacts while others succumb to accidents which are apparently much less severe? The answer to this question will provide the automobile designer with the necessary design criteria to minimize injuries. There are certain factors that affect the degree of injury from a blow, fall, or automobile accident which are known intuitively from a qualitative standpoint such as : striking a soft surface is less injurious than striking a hard one; hit- ting a large area is preferable to hitting a small area; a sharp edge is more dangerous than a dull one; and a blow to the head is worse than a similar blow to the thigh. Unfortunately, quantitative data on most of these items are not yet avail- able and probably will not be for several years. Neverthe- less, one has only to examine current model automobiles to find a few examples of disregard of obvious principles of safety design. Whether this is attributed to "styling over safety, " public apathy toward safety, or lack of concrete specification for safe design is immaterial - - they are still unsafe. Recent legislation on safety requirements for future fed- eral government vehicles (Roberts Bill*) is, undoubtedly, the forerunner of similar legislation at the state level aimed at safer automobiles. Such legislation will be effective only if ♦Public Law 88-515. Fundamental principles of crash safety are discussed from a qualitative and quantitative engineering viewpoint. Cate- gories of impact injury , together with the passenger com- partment injury -producing components, are presented. Tech- niques used for establishing measurable parameters of injury utilizing live anesthetized animals, cadavers, human vol- unteers, and anthropomorphic dummies are outlined. Sev- eral types of experimental impact devices are evaluated with limitations and advantages of each listed. Human im- pact tolerance levels based on measurable physical quantities, such as force or acceleration, are recommended with values given for forehead impact. 785</page><page sequence="2">786 L. M. PATRICK it is based upon valid premises. Therefore, it is imperative that research effort be accelerated in the area of human tol- erance to impact, including all of its ramifications. If injury potential is to graduate from a qualitative to a quantitative measure, some measurable parameter (s) must be found with a correlation to injury potential. As used herein injury potential covers two distinct phases: first , the range up to the injury level; and second , the range from minor injury through the various degrees of injury up to and including death. Obviously, there is no sharp line of de- markation between the two ranges . Instead , "tolerance levels" are recommended which are values on the injury potential scale corresponding to a prescribed minor, nonincapacitating , fully recoverable injury. Many tolerance levels will be re- quired to cover the different body areas and injury -producing devices. Practically, the lowest tolerance level for the most ad- verse combination of body area and injury -producing com- ponent will govern safety design. The steering wheel rim can serve as an illustration of this design concept. For illus- trative purposes the following assumptions are made based upon force as the measurable quantity: 1. The face, throat, chest, and abdomen are the body areas that can hit the rim. 2. The facial tolerance level is 150 lb. 3. The throat tolerance level is 100 lb. 4. The chest tolerance level is 1000 lb. 5. The abdomen tolerance level is 500 lb. 6. The tolerance levels are based upon a rim of 3/4 in. in diameter. Obviously, the most adverse combination in this hypothet- ical example (the values used herein are not proposed as limits) is the steering wheel rim and the throat with a tol- erance level of 100 lb. However, a design specification for the rim of 100 lb is incomplete . A distance through which it must deflect without exceeding the 100 lb force must be included based upon the velocity of impact and/or the de- flection distance before the hub strikes the chest. If á smaller rim cross-section diameter is to be used, the tolerance levels must be adjusted accordingly. Realistic impact tolerance levels are difficult to estab- lish because of the many variables involved . Physiological variations are so wide that a tolerance level based on the weakest individual would probably result in an impractical design specification , Consequently, a level which will be adequate for the average individual (minor injury), nonfatal to the weakest (serious injury), and noiiinjurious to the strong- est is probably the best compromise . Other important con- siderations are: 1. Body component (s) impacted. 2. Direction of the impact. 3. Impact speed. 4. Contact area. 5. Surface finish. 6. Surface hardness. 7. Load deflection characteristics of impact structure . 8. Time duration. 9. Jerk (third derivative of displacement with respect to time). 10. Type of injury under consideration. Many of these items are interrelated, and the large num- ber of combinations results in a formidable program if all factors are to be considered. Fortunately, as one progresses with an orderly investigation of effects of each for a single set of conditions, data are obtained which can be applied to other facets of the program. For example, about the same protection from laceration is applicable to several parts of the body. Generally, large forces, high accelerations, and short time durations are the phenomena an engineer associates with impact, and accelerations and/or forces are the two measurements used most frequently as injury indices. Force can be measured with load cells if the impacting or impacted target can be so mounted , but problems are encountered if the structure to be struck is an integral part of a vehicle , such as an instrument panel wherein the rigidity varies from point to point and with the direction of the force. Mounting the panel on a load cell is difficult and can modify the rigidity of the entire panel to produce erroneous results. Also, the head, chest, and both knees strike the panel so that it would be necessary to subdivide it into four parts with individual load cells for each. Obviously, this is most undesirable . An alternative would be to establish the tolerance levels by impacting targets mounted on load cells with body components, such as the knees, of dummies, cadavers, and volunteers. The instrument panel can then be evaluated by impacting it with an instrumented ram sim- ulating the knee and having a force measuring system in- corporated into it. If the forces so measured are below the established tolerance level, the panel is satisfactory. Acceleration is used as the injury criterion by many in- vestigators. It should be noted at the outset that correlation is poor between measured force and a force calculated from mass and acceleration due to the fact that the dummy or cadaver is not a rigid body. An example of a chest impact with both acceleration and force measured in which the force calculated from the mass and acceleration is over three times the measured force is reported by Kroell and Patrick (1)*. Thus, gross errors may be encountered if impact forces are inferred from mass and accelerations. While impact forces cannot be calculated from mass and acceleration on nonrigid bodies, the use of acceleration as the injury parameter is valid , if used consistently , and has the advantage that the same configuration can be used to impact a passenger compartment component as was used in establishing the tolerance level. Accelerometers mounted on the back of the head of a cadaver have produced the most valid scale of injury as a function of impact velocity. Du- plication of the same impact with an anthropomorphic dummy with accelerometers mounted inside the head provides •Numbers in parentheses designated References at end of paper.</page><page sequence="3">HUMAN TOLERANCE TO IMPACT - BASIS FOR SAFETY DESIGN 787 a calibration permitting the dummy to be used to measure injury potential - the acceleration magnitude is different, but it describes the same blow for which the degree of in- jury is known. IMPACT INJURIES Bone Damage - Fracture of bones is the injury most ame- nable to analysis by the usual engineering techniques. Bone can be, and has been, tested to obtain stress-strain curves, the modulus of elasticity, elongation, ultimate strength, and other physical properties (2). It is a nonhomogene ous, non- isotropic, fibrous material with physical properties that vary with direction, moisture content, age of the individual, lo- cation in a particular bone, and location in the body. Two properties of bone warrant particular mention - self- healing and stress reduction. Healing of fractures is well known, but one of the less obvious results of healing that is particularly significant is the virtual elimination of pro- gressive failure and fatigue failure due to healing of minute cracks or fiber failures as they appear. The second property is one in which additional bone is added through growth at points of high stress, thus reducing the stress. There have been many experimental and theoretical analyses of the stress in different bones due to assumed load- ing conditions which give a valuable insight into the stress distribution. However, the complex loading through the many ligament attachment points, plus the direct loading from joints and external loads, make analyses of individual bones of limited value . Impact loading of the intact body under impact gives much more reliable data , even though the muscle loads are not present. Comparison of fractures obtained experimentally with clinical cases proves the va- lidity of this approach. Impact fracture data must be recorded for the various com- binations of conditions. Surface finish , area, hardness, shaper and rigidity play important roles in the dynamic forces re- quired to fracture bones. They can even change the loca- tion of the fracture . A hard impact surface might cause pa- tella or condyle fracture in a knee impact, while a soft sur- face might result in a femoral shaft fracture . Fractures can be detected from Xrays, palpitation, or changes in load cell or acceleration records (1). The mag- nitude of the load or acceleration at fracture must be recorded along with the type and location of the fracture for enough tests to assure statistical confidence. Fracture tolerance levels must be correlated with the impact conditions to be valid. Soft Tissue Injury - Impact to a blunt object often causes bruises or contusions. If the blow is not too severe these in- juries are not dangerous and cause only discomfort. Since the skin is not broken, the danger of infection is low and com- plete recovery follows. More severe impacts to a blunt ob- ject can result in internal soft tissue damage, including tear- ing of muscles and connecting tissue. Still greater severity can cause rupture of the skin and underlying tissue . Laceration is associated with impact to sharp edges such as sheet metal and broken glass. Bmises and minor contusions can be investigated with vol- unteers satisfactorily at low impact severity; higher energy impacts and the more severe injuries can be studied with cadavers with a calibration from the low level volunteer data. Lacerations can be measured on cadavers and animals. Chamois skin and pig skin have been used to represent human skin with good results. The animal skin is placed over the cadaver, and if the laceration is only through the animal skin, it is considered minor. If the tissue under the animal skin is damaged , the injury is more serious and the degree is noted (3). Internal Organ Injury - Contusions, lacerations, and rup- tures of internal organs result from automobile accidents and are particularly dangerous because there are often no exter- nal indications or symptoms of the injury. The victim some- times dies before proper diagnosis is made. Only limited data are available on impact organ injury from cadaver research. Animals must be used so that func- tional impairment of the organs can be determined as a func- tion of impact conditions. After the criteria for degree of injury are established, instrumentation and. techniques for measuring them must be developed . Once the injury mech- anisms are understood , trauma indicating models of the or- gans can be devised for use in dummies or cadavers to indicate organ damage from impact to passenger compart- ment components. Evans and Patrick (4) discuss internal organ damage and a program for evaluating it. Kulowski (5) provides an excellent summary of internal organ dam- age from automobile accidents. CAUSES OF INJURY Consideration of the crash environment provides a guide to the tolerance levels required. The passenger compart- ment in an automobile is generally designed so there is little danger from impact to the back or seat of the passen- ger. The automobile seat is cushioned and designed to dis- tribute loads over large areas of the body. Consequently, the injuries to be considered are generally those in the for- ward facing direction. A major exception to this is the " whiplash" injury occurring when a vehicle is struck from behind causing hyperextension injuries to the soft tissues of the neck and in severe instances to the cervical vertebrae. The so-called whiplash injury is not the same type of in- jury usually encountered in an impact where the body strikes , or is struck by, some object. Whiplash is more accurately described as an acceleration of the body and is character- ized by a longer duration of the acceleration than is the case with most impacts. Starting with the driver, the most obvious component which he will strike in a forward accident is the steering wheel. The lower part of the rim of the steering wheel strikes the abdomen, while the upper rim may strike the chest, neck, or the face depending upon the size of the driver, the po- sition of the seat, and whether he is wearing a seat belt. If the accident is severe enough, the steering wheel rim will be deformed, and the chest will strike the hub of the wheel.</page><page sequence="4">788 L. M. PATRICK Recapping the impact phenomena encountered in steer- ing wheel accidents, one has the face on a comparatively small rim area, the throat - - again on a small area - - the chest with a comparatively long, narrow area in the case of the rim, and a smaller concentrated area when the chest hits the hub. In violent accidents the driver may hit the header, the "A" post on his side, the windshield over the wheel, and if the accident is not directly head-on, he may strike the wind- shield on the passenger side or the window on his side. In addition to the aforementioned impact areas, his knees usu- ally hit the instrument panel and /or the steering column. The passenger does not have the steering wheel to con- tend with, but often hits the windshield with disastrous re- sults. If the passenger is not belted, he generally moves forward in an upright position, hits the instrument panel with his knees, continues forward in a jackknifing motion with his head traveling in an arc about the waist, the head hits the windshield and penetrates or rebounds from it , and the chest hits the instrument panel. In the case of the center passenger, the knees hit the instrument panel and are more likely to contact radio or heater control knobs. In addition, he is exposed to injury from the rear view mirror, the wind- shield , and instrument panel similar to the passenger in the right-hand seat. Both passengers may' hit the header. The passenger wearing a seat belt minimizes the danger of severe lacerations and facial bone injuries from the wind- shield , but is still subject to injuries to the facial bones by impacting the instrument panel. The knees do not hit the instrument panel with the same severity or do not hit it at , all, but the body pivots around the seat belt and the head travels in an arc striking the instrument panel with great force . The driver and passengers must be protected from impacts to the head from objects of various sizes, impacts to the face from the windshield or from comparatively rigid structures of different size and impact area, impacts to the neck and chest from the steering wheel rim - a comparatively small area - impacts to the chest from the steering wheel hub which can be a large or small area, impacts to the chest on the instrument panel which is usually a large area but can be almost a knife edge with some of the current sharp eyebrow designs. The knees strike the instrument panel causing in- jury to the knee -thigh -hip complex. The lower limbs move under the instrument panel and strike the heater and duct work under the instrument panel with sufficient force to frac- ture the lower limbs. ESTABLISHING TOLERANCE LEVELS When one wishes to determine the physical character- istics of an engineering material , he conducts suitable tests on it. Obviously, it is not feasible to conduct destructive impact tests on the human being. However, volunteers have been used to determine the voluntary tolerance level which is an excellent aid in establishing the injury tolerance level of interest to the automobile designer. The approach taken at Wayne State University to estab- lish tolerance levels is to start with cadavers , since none of the current anthropomorphic dummies adequately simu- lates the complexity of the human body. The cadaver's joints are manipulated so they are articulated to the degree desired for the particular series of tests. Thereafter, the cadaver is subjected to an impact duplicating the actual ac- cident conditions as closely as possible . Sleds used for this purpose will be described later. The cadaver is impacted with increasing severity until fracture of bones occurs or the soft tissue is seriously lacerated . The object of running a series of impacts of increasing severity is to determine the trend of the strains in the bones with increasing impact severity. Measurements are made with strain gages mounted on the bones and accelerometers mounted at various places in the body. After data are obtained on the simulated impacts, a de- sirable step , but one not always taken because of the danger involved, is to have a volunteer go through the same series of tests with increasing impact severity up to his voluntary tolerance level. The volunteer data is compared with the cadaver data. If there is a significant difference at the non- injury level , the volunteer data is extrapolated to compare the results at higher impact levels with those from the ca- daver. This is one means of determining whether the ca- daver data is valid. In addition to the strain gage and accelerometer readings, the cadavers are X rayed before each series of tests and after any test in which fracture is suspected . Medical doctors are part of the team and examine the X rays and injuries to de- termine the extent of injury , and to determine whether the injuries are comparable to those found in automobile acci- dents. The inclusion of clinical data in the program makes the results more valid. There are many cases where experi- mental injuries are almost identical to those seen clinically, thus verifying the validity of the test procedure . The use of cadavers is limited primarily to bone damage. There is some information to be obtained on soft tissue dam- age , but the soft tissue is considerably different after em- balming than living tissue. On the other hand, it has been found that bone is quite similar after embalming to living bone insofar as physical properties are concerned. This holds true if the bone is kept moist as it is in the embalmed ca- daver. The use of cadavers for injuries to organs has not been satisfactory, although recent studies, in which vessels have been injected with a radiopaque dye, show promise of eval- uating the effects of impact on the vascular system. How- ever, for the most part the determination of injury from im- pact to organs and soft tissue is better carried out on animals. For this purpose the Biomechanics Research Center has used mice, rats, rabbits, guinea pigs, dogs, pigs, and monkeys. Whenever live animals are used in this research they are treated humanely and surgery, if needed, is conducted un- der the direct supervision of qualified surgeons using good operative techniques. Currently, animals are being used to compare the results from living and embalmed specimens; to determine the movement of the internal organsunder im-</page><page sequence="5">HUMAN TOLERANCE TO IMPACT - BASIS FOR SAFETY DESIGN 789 pact and vibration; to measure the effects of blows to the head in a concussion study; to measure the lacera ti ve prop- erties of glass; and to find the effect of hype rex tension on the soft tissues of the neck. Anthropomorphic dummies are used by a majority of the investigators in the experimental accident field as a meas- ure of injury (6). These dummies are of the proper shape and size but have several shortcomings as well as several advantages. The advantages are that they can be used in many more tests than the cadavers since the components if damaged can be replaced; they are more uniform than the cadavers. This is desirable when the results from several experiments are to be compared. If two investigators use cadavers, the chances of their being the same size, age, and weight are rather remote. On the other hand, dummies can be reproduced with almost identical characteristics and thus provide an excellent means of comparison for different experiments. The main disadvantage of the use of anthropomorphic dummies for experimental crash investigation is that there is no direct method of measuring injury on the dummy. The construction is necessarily simple compared to the complex human body. The simulated skeleton is limited to a verte- bral column, ribs, and comparatively few other bones. The articulation is not as complete as it is in the human, Most of the joints are of the hinge type, while more degrees of freedom are available in each human joint. The attach- ment of the "muscles and soft tissue" is different in the dummy than in the human resulting in different forces and ac- celerations from a blow. Dummies are being improved constantly, and methods of indicating trauma are being included in the more sophis- ticated dummies. If, by comparison with cadavers and clin- ical data, the trauma indicating dummy is developed to a point where it can be relied upon, it will be a step for- ward in evaluating the injury potential of components and measuring whether a given impact is below the human tol- erance level. Finally, the investigations of injuries incurred in acci- dents provide an excellent base for measuring the injury to be expected from different components. Unfortunately, there are many unknowns in this type of investigation. The exact speed, attitude of the passenger, objects struck, and other important aspects of the accident are unknown. How- ever , the data when treated statistically are valuable . Huelke (7-9), Lange (10), and Moseley (11) are doing outstanding work in this area. EXPERIMENTAL IMPACT DEVICES Experimental impact devices can be divided into two cat- egories depending upon whether the whole body or a portion' of the body is under investigation. For example, head im- pacts studied by striking the head with some object is one category, while investigation of impact to the entire body in a drop test facility represents the other category. The primary interest in this paper is in the latter category in which the entire body is investigated. Perhaps the earliest investigation of this type involved experimental car crashes which, on first consideration, ap- pear to be the optimum means of studying crash safety since the conditions are essentially identical to those of accidents. Obvious limitations become apparent upon closer scrutiny: 1. Individual vehicles can be used in only a few crashes of other than minor severity resulting in a limited number of experiments. 2. The complete vehicle is available for test only after it has progressed to the preproduction stage and then in very limited numbers. It is too late to evaluate safety designs and modify them, if necessary, for current production. 3. Impact conditions are difficult to control. It is amai- jor problem to make the vehicle hit the barrier or other car at exactly the desired velocity and location. Variations from test to test can invalidate component comparisons. 4. Instrumentation and recording of results are complex and affected by ambient weather conditions. 5. The cost is prohibitive for making the necessary sta- tistical comparisons of the many safety components. While investigations of this type are after the fact, they are still the final check and essential for the evaluation of the results of other test methods; that is , components can be evaluated in the laboratory by whatever means are avail- able , but the final check comes when they are installed in the vehicle and tested at the track. Experimental devices, in which full size dummies, ca- davers, or volunteers have been tested, include centrifuges, drop facilities, pendulums, whole body vibrators, explosive impactors, and sleds. The purpose of this paper is to pre- sent information on crash simulators in which sleds are the primary test device. Early sleds, on which human tolerance was investigated, were at Edwards Air Force Base and Holloman Air Force Base with Col. J. P. S tapp as the principal investigator and vol- unteer. His work is still the outstanding example of the use of volunteers for establishing tolerance levels (12-15). At Edwards Air Force Base in 1947 Col. Stapp, after a series of tests on anthropomorphic dummies, conducted tests in which he was the volunteer. These tests continued through 1948 during which time he made 16 rides in a backward- facing seat at acceleration levels up to 35 g. Additional work was conducted by Col. Stapp at Holloman Air ForceBase on a gigantic sled capable of supersonic speeds. In 1954 he conducted a test, with himself as the volunteer, in which he stopped from a speed of 632 mph in 1.4 sec at accelerations in excess of40g. This is still the maximum that a human has achieved voluntarily. Since then many other sleds have been constructed to use in crash research. These include one at the University of Minnesota (16), one at the General Motors Proving Ground (17), and two at Wayne State University (1, 3). One of the sleds at Wayne will be discussed in detail under the section in which the method of obtaining human tolerance is pre- sented.</page><page sequence="6">790 L. M. PATRICK HEAD IMPACT INJURY RESEARCH The most important part of the body to protect from in- jury is the head. Injury to other body components can be sustained without a major effect on the ability of the in- dividual to continue a normal life , whereas serious head in- jury can incapacitate the individual even though from out- ward appearances he is in good health. Research on head injury started in 1939 at Wayne State University when Dr. Gurdjian and Professor Lissner initiated a research program on skull fracture. This was one of the earliest cooperative ventures between a medical doctor and an engineer and has grown to the present team of engineers and doctors working in the Biomechanics Research Center. The early part of this project was conducted on dry skulls in an effort to determine the energy required to fracture and the location of fracture . The dry skull was found to fracture at energies of about 30 in. -lb when dropped on a hard steel surface . Following the study on bare skulls, intact heads were dropped on steel blocks to determine the energy level with the soft tissue in place . The results show an energy level of 400-700 in. -lb to cause fracture with the intact head. This is a dramatic illustration of the advantages of a com- paratively small amount of padding or energy- absorbing ma- terial in attenuating impacts. The scalp is in the order of 1/4 in. thick and increased fracture energy from the 30 in.- lb to 400-700 in. -lb. Stresscoat and strain gages were used in this early head injury research to measure strain distri- bution and magnitude. Continuation of the head injury research involved the use Fig. 1 - Drop test facility for establishing forehead impact tolerance and comparing the injury potential of tempered and laminated glass. The door and window are replaced by a heavy steel slab for the impact tolerance study. Ac- celerarne te rs and pressure transducers are mounted on the head of living animals. Concussion and closed head injury with- out skull fracture is often more serious than when skull frac- ture occurs. It was necessary to use living animals so that the physiological reactions could be studied and the injury to the brain ascertained from pathological examinations. The combined efforts of the doctors and engineers resulted in accurate measurement of the causes of concussion and also of the responses of the living animal to the concussion. In order to control the forces on the brain causing con- concussion and to determine the effect of time and accel- eration magnitude of the concussive impact, a device was designed which applied pressure to the dura of the brain for a controlled time period. This device produced an accu- rate time-pressure relationship for concussion and is the ba- sis for the present tolerance curve for humans. Impacts to the human head, in which the brain had been removed and replaced with a gelatin of the same specific gravity , were made with pressure transducers inserted in the skull . Pressure as a function of impact energy and force was measured with a drop test facility (Fig. l)in which the en- tire cadaver was dropped with the head striking a hard steel plate. Accelerometers mounted on the back of the skull provided acceleration data along with the pressure data which were combined with clinical observations of concussion to obtain an acceleration-time tolerance curve for impact to Fig. 2 - Acceleration -time tolerance curve for moderate concussion from forehead impact to a hard flat surface with acceleration measured on the back of the head opposite point of impact</page><page sequence="7">HUMAN TOLERANCE TO IMPACT - BASIS FOR SAFETY DESIGN 791 the forehead as shown in Fig. 2(18) - it is valid only for fore- head impact to a hard flat surface. AUTOMOBILE GLAZING INVESTIGATION Side Window - When the use of tempered glass in the side windows of automobiles was first suggested , there was con- siderable controversy over whether such glass would be more conducive to closed head (concussion) injury than laminated safety glass. As a result a program was inflated to evaluate the comparative injury potential from the two types of glass. Since the tempered glass was proposed for use only in side windows, the experimental setup was made for investigating such windows. A door from an automobile was mounted in a fixture in the drop test facility so that the head of the ca- daver mounted on the sled would strike the center of the glass . Tempered and laminated glass were used in the door with the impact injury potential of both measured with accel- erometers mounted on the back of the head and pressure trans- ducers in the temporal area. Fig. 1 shows the experimental setup, while Figs. 3 and 4 are photographs of impact to laminated and tempered glass, respectively. The laminated glass is held in the frame: after it breaks by the plastic interlay er, and the jagged edges are in a position to lacerate the head as it goes through, or is retracted out of, the hole in the glass. The tempered glass, on the other hand , breaks into small particles and is com- pletely knocked out of the window in most cases so that lac- erations are not so prevalent. Another interesting feature of the tempered glass is that the edges of the particles are not as sharp as they are on regular glass. The results of this study are shown in Fig. 5 as temporal pressure as a function of impact velocity for laminated , 3/16 in. tempered, and 7/32 in. tempered sheet glass along with similar data for impact to a 300 lb steel slab. There is not much danger of concussion which occurs at 28 to 30 psi from any of the glazing materials shown. However, with the var- iations encountered in glass manufacture , the 7/32 in. tem- pered sheet glass could be considered marginal. The pres- sures reach a peak just prior to break velocity , while at higher velocities the pressure is less and danger of close head in- jury is reduced. Additional details of this research are pre- sented by Haynes and Lissner (19). Windshield - It has been estimated that 200, 000 persons are disabled annually by injuries from the windshield. ACIR (20), with their 1-2-4-8 injury rating, lists the windshield as third in injury production from frontal force accidents. The number of injuries produced would probably be higher on an unweighted basis. Most of the windshield injury is considered nondangerous to life and , therefore , not given an important role in automobile injury; but they are dis- figuring, disabling, expensive, and require long convales- cence which makes them most important to the victim. Clinical and experimental evidence indicates that wind- shield injuries are generally of a minor nature until pene- tration occurs. Minor injuries include abrasions, gouges, Fig. 3 - Penetration of laminated side window showing sharp, jagged edges of glass which produce severe lacera- tions Fig. 4 - Head impact to tempered glass with the glass knocked out of the frame and no chance of laceration. Note the small size of the particles on the frame with blunt ends</page><page sequence="8">792 L. M. PATRICK and shallow lacerations. After penetration severe lacera- tions and fracture of facial bones occur and, in general, the injuries are far more serious. In an attempt to decrease the injuries from windshields, a joint effort between the glass , plastic , and automotive com- panies and Wayne State University to develop and evaluate an improved windshield has been initiated. Research by these industries has resulted in a thicker interlayer and con- trolled adhesion which increases the penetration velocity considerably. Laboratory tests with a spherical impactor, plus dummy tests by one of the automotive companies , showed the improved laminated glass to have a higher penetration velocity. While these tests indicated a considerable im* provement , it was decided to evaluate the glass still further by using human cadavers in experimental impacts at Wayne. Complete results of the experimental windshield program are reported by Patrick and Daniel (3). Fig. 5 - Temporal pressure as a function of impact veloc- ity for forehead impacts to a steel slab and different types of glazing material The research program has the following objectives: 1. Comparison of injury potential of standard and ex- perimental windshields. 2. Establishment of penetration speed for each type of glass. 3. Determination of depth of penetration as a function of sled speed. 4. Determination of injuries occurring at the different speed ranges. 5. Comparison of dummy and cadaver results from simi- lar impacts. The experimental investigation was conducted on a hori- zontal impact sled shown in Fig. 6. An automobile seat is mounted on the pneumatically propelled sled with speeds up to 40 mph available. A body buck, consisting of an auto- mobile body from the firewall back to and including the "B" post , is mounted on the frame of the sled . The sled is de- celerated with a predetermined acceleration pulse from the sled speed to zero and stopped. with ťhe seat in proper rela- tive position with respect to the vehicle interior. The non- restrained passenger (dummy or cadaver) continues forward and strikes the vehicle interior in a manner simulating a bar- rier impact wherein the vehicle is stopped before the pas- senger hits the interior. The feet rest on the floor or inclined toe board, the knees strike the instrument panel, and the body moves with the same kinematics as would be the case in a barrier impact. The body jackknifes forward, pivoting about the waist with the head striking the glass while traveling in an arc. This produces a component of velocity in the plane of the glass as noted by an initial impact point usually about 4 in. below the top of the glass, while the center of penetration is 4-8 in. below the initial impact point. Accelerometers mounted in the occipital region meas- Fig. 6 - Horizontal impact sled with dummy on the seat approaching the body buck</page><page sequence="9">HUMAN TOLERANCE TO IMPACT - BASIS FOR SAFETY DESIGN 793 ure biaxial head acceleration. Other instrumentation in- cludes sled accelerarne ters, velocity transducer, and several high speed cameras. Penetration occurred in the standard windshields at sled speeds above approximately 12.5 mph. With the experi- mental windshields the minimum penetration speed was about 24 mph. A comparison of the penetration with the standard windshield (15 mil interlayer) and the improved windshield (30 mil interlayer) is dramatically illustrated in Fig. 7 in which the windshields were replaced in the body buck and a dummy positioned with its head at approximately the max- imum penetration position for each impact condition. Pene- tration of the standard windshields occurred in all tests at speeds above 12.5 mph, while penetration of the experi- mental windshield occurred only once at approximately 24 mph sled speed (29 mph head-to-glass speed , an increased velocity caused by the body rotating at the waist). Other impacts with experimental windshields at even higher velocities did not result in penetration. The accel- erations accompanying the impacts were below the concus- sion level for both types of glass. A bulge of several inches with the experimental glass without penetration produces a sufficient decelerating distance to minimize closed head in- juries. Fig. 8 is a graph of head impact speed versus result- ant head acceleration. Prior to penetration the peak accel- erations are quite low. After penetration the head is forced down against the glass producing edge loading which causes higher accelerations. Prior to penetration the injuries to the cadavers consisted of gouges, scratches, abrasions, and minor lacerations. With penetration severe lacerations occurred and facial bones were fractured when penetration was more than about 2 in. In one instance with a standard windshield the primary impact on the edge of the penetrated glass was below the zygomatic arch. The zygoma, zygomatic arch, maxilla, and nasal bones were fractured, and the nose was nearly severed. There was also a deep laceration across the forehead just above Fig. 8 - Resultant maximum head deceleration for stand- ard and experimental windshield impacts Fig. 7 - Comparison of penetration of standard windshields and experi- mental windshields at three different head-to- glass impact speeds</page><page sequence="10">794 L. M. PATRICK the eyebrow, and the right eyelid was lacerated. The ex- ternal injuries are shown in Fig. 9. In the only penetration with the experimental windshield a deep laceration angling from above the right eye , across the bridge of the nose , and through the left eye was noted. The nose and lateral rim of the orbit were fractured. The eyeball was damaged severely . A skin flap extending across the forehead and going down to the bone also resulted as shown in Fig. 10. From the limited data available it ap- pears that injuries are comparable from the two types of windshields after penetration occurs, but the higher pene- tration speed with the experimental windshield should mark- edly reduce the number of injuries. Fig. 9 - Injuries from standard windshield with penetration to the upper lip (below zygomatic arch) Fig. 10 - Injuries from experimental windshield with pen- etration to the bridge of the nose Research is continuing on increasing penetration velocity. The goal is 35 mph or more which, if achieved, should re- duce the number of windshield injuries drastically. Injury from Flying Glass Particles - During experimental crash investigations, high speed cameras mounted on the car showed glass particles moving at high speed inside the ve- hicle. The particles of tempered glass from the side win- dows were traveling at high speeds , and it was feared that they might cause injury to the passengers. This was investi- gated by mounting glass panes from automobile doors in a vertical frame and striking them with a rotary impactor to produce flying particles of the desired velocity. Laminated, standard tempered, and chemically tempered glass was used. The single impact with laminated glass with sufficient force to rupture the plastic interlayer resulted in a comparatively large section of the laminate with sharp edges to fly into the area occupied by the passengers. Since this has not been found to occur often in accident surveys, no further work was done on it. Standard tempered glass was struck and the flying par- ticles were permitted to strike anesthetized rabbits with the fur shaved from the area exposed to the glass. At particle velocities of up to 65 fps only minor lacerations (less than 1/ 16 in. long) resulted. It was concluded that only minor soft tissue damage could be expected from these flying par- ticles, and no bone damage would occur. A similar investigation was made with chemically tem- pered glass with velocities up to 75 fps. Even less injury was observed with the chemically tempered glass particles which were smaller than the standard tempered glass particles. On the basis of the minor injuries resulting from these par- ticles, a human volunteered to permit the particles to strike his back to determine whether greater injury would occur in the human than on the rabbits. The particle velocity at im- pact was 66 fps (45 mph). Hundreds of particles struck his back with only minor skin perforations. Fig. 11 shows the volunteer's back immediately after being struck with the Fig. 11 - Volunteer's back immediately after being struck with glass particles traveling at 66 fps</page><page sequence="11">HUMAN TOLERANCE TO IMPACT - BASIS FOR SAFETY DESIGN 795 glass particles. The vertebral column was protected with a strip of heavy cardboard. The particles were removed and the back washed with soap and water as shown in Fig. 12, which is a photograph taken about 20 minutes after the ini- tial impact. The injury was so slight that only two or three small welts could be observed 12 hr later. The volunteer had no discomfort after the initial stinging sensation from the impact of the particles. From these experiments it was concluded that chances of injury from the flying glass particles is slight. A direct hit on the surface of the eye would probably cause injury , but the eye would probably be closed before the glass particles struck and the eyelid would not be penetrated. WHIPLASH Investigation of the whiplash syndrome is under way using the sled shown in Fig. 6. The so-called whiplash is induced in either one of two ways. First, the passenger is seated in a normal position and the sled accelerated in a manner du- plicating a rear end collision. Sled accelerations are limited to lOgin this mode of operation which correspond to about a 23 mph rear end collision. Higher velocity impacts are sim- ulated by reversing the seat on the sled and using the de- celeration at the end of travel to produce the whiplash. Se- vere whiplash conditions can be duplicated in the latter man- ner. Biaxial accelerometers are mounted on the back of the head and high speed X rays are taken during the hyperex- tension period. Four X rays of 6/10 of a microsecond du- ration are taken at spaced intervals to show the position of the cervical vertebrae during the extension. Radiopaque dye has been injected into the head and neck vessels of a cadaver to indicate the effect of the acceleration and stretching on the vessels. The effect of head rests on attenuating the injury sever- ity will be included in this study. Since most of the injuries from the so-called whiplash accident are to soft tissue , anes- thetized primates will be used in future experiments. Fig. 12 - Volunteer's back about 20 minutes after glass particles had been removed Other injury tolerance investigations currently under way at Wayne include knee impacts (1), injury to the facial bones (21), vibrations tolerance (22), chest impacts , steering wheel impacts, injuries from the instrument panel , effects of whole body acceleration, and the attenuation of injury by suitable head protection padding and helmets. These research pro- grams are fundamental in nature and will provide data for design of components to minimize injury. Similar investigations at other universities, government agencies, and private companies , when combined, will even- tually provide a basis for design within human tolerance . However, due to the wide variation of resistance to injury between individuals , it will probably never be possible to eliminate all injuries. Although increasing speed makes in- jury protection more difficult , application of the results of research programs, as described briefly herein, to safety de- sign will minimize injuries and fatalities. SUMMARY Automobile safety design has not been given adequate consideration in the past with even obvious safety features often ignored. Recent legislation regarding safety in gov- ernment-owned vehicles will undoubtedly result in further legislation making safety features mandatory. Automobile manufacturers are currently giving safety a more important role in design of vehicle interiors. Before safety design can be optimized, it is necessary to know more about human tolerance to impact. Tolerance levels must be supplied in quantitative details which can be translated into design by engineers. Such data are being gathered by biomechanics laboratories and will be available in increasing amounts in the future. One of the important injury parameters is acceleration. The human body can stand high 'accelerations for short time periods. The safety design goal is to provide padding and /or deformable structures which will reduce the relative velocity between the passenger and the vehicle interior to zero with- out exceeding the tolerable acceleration magnitude. With optimum load deflection characteristics this can be achieved with a few inches of relative motion. Careful design based on qualitative injury data will re- duce automobile injuries and fatalities. REFERENCES 1. C. K. Kroell and L. M.
