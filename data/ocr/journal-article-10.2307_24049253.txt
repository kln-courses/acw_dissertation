Two holes bored within millimetres of each other at the transition of the outer rim and the narrow slanting band appear in two diametri cally opposite emplacements. They could have been used for riveting the brass sheet to a wooden or leather support. The elaborate and delicate nature of the decoration suggests that this may have been one of several things—a pa rade shield, a shield made for dedication to a shrine, or one made for funerary purposes which would in any case have had a hard supporting base. Stylistically, the object is related to a small group of beakers dating from the 10th or 9th century b.c., particularly one in the Louvre Museum.26 If a shield, as I believe, it is of great interest for the floral motif which appears in the central area. It is of the marguerite or mari gold type. As will be seen in Part Three, the notion of the sun as "the yellow flower of heaven" or simply the "flower of the sun" is well entrenched in metaphorical Persian po etry. Similarly, the image of the multi-petal flower as a symbol of the sun is well estab lished in the iconography of Islamic Iran. This must have been the case long before Islam.

A century later, examples of the Sun Shield with the sun as a floral rosette are found in the art of Urartu.

Alongside the metaphorical motif of the "golden rosette," a more direct representation of the sun is found at about the same time, i.e., the 7th or early 8th century a.D., in the Eastern Iranian world. It once appeared in a now destroyed mural painting uncovered with the remains of a Buddhist shrine in present-day Afghanistan (fig. 10). The site, located at Siyäh gerd, in the Fondüqestän valley, lies 120 kilo meters to the west of Bämiyän and 117 kilometers to the northwest of Kabul.44 The French archeologist Jean Carl who excavated it, using primitive methods, was unable to pre serve the paintings in their integrity. He took a black and white photograph of a group of two standing characters, now lost, and in addition made a copy in pen and red and blue wash. The watercolor shows that Carl did not fully understand the subject matter. He drew the highly distinctive ribs of a parasol carried by a man behind the character in the foreground but left out the upper trapezoidal outline of the parasol of which a section can be made out in the black and white photograph of the origi nal.45 Hackin, who published a report on the SF* *• Fig. 9.

The character in the foreground was dubbed by him a "dieu lunaire." In fact, it is a king whose crown is fitted with a crescent bor rowed from Sasanian regalia. He wears a typi cal Eastern Iranian costume consisting of a tunic opening in the middle and falling just be low the knee, with two large lapels.46 The rigid, funnel-like elements protecting his wrists are probably those of leather gauntlets indicating that he is depicted as a royal hunter ready for hawking.47 With one hand he steadies his sheathed sword while holding with the other a medium-sized buckler—both would be used when hunting felines. Interestingly, the Buddhist king wears trou sers made of tiger-skin. Iranian metalwork shows examples of tiger-skin trousers, worn by kings—a royal hunter wears them on a wine phiale in the Hermitage.48 This garment may have designated the Buddhist ruler in the Siyähgerd mural as "the Rostam of our time."49 In any case, the "dieu lunaire" and the "dieu solaire" are definitely not deities. One is a lo cal Iranian royal donor, perhaps the man who dedicated the stüpa in the courtyard. The other is his attendant holding a parasol over the king's head in keeping with a tradition that goes back to Persepolis and, beyond, to Assyr ian regalia. Not surprisingly, the medium-sized 14</page><page sequence="15">MELIKIAN-CHIRV a N i: The Iranian Sun Shield Fig. 10.

In Carl's copy, which is now framed and ap pears to have undergone prolonged exposure to sunlight, the main field of the shield is a pale pink. Originally, it must have been closer to carmine red. Around the formerly red sun disc, a narrow, pale grey band probably stands for sil ver which may have been oxidised when exca vated by Carl. In the outer band, painted black, white arcs painted in twos give the shield a whirling movement, a motif still found six cen turies later (fig. 14). Red is one of the colors considered to be typi cal of the sun in the Iranian repertoire of im ages.50 Indeed, "cinnabar [red] shield" is one of the recognized metaphors of the sun in litera ture, as has been said. A more specific image for the sun is that of "the blazing quicksilver" [slmäb-e âtashln] or "the quicksilver-with-a blazing-head" [slmäb-e âtashïn sur].51 This im plies a red disc allowing some silver to appear, which is precisely the case with the shield that was held by the royal character standing on the wall of the Buddhist shrine. Thus, the lost mural from the Siyähgerd shrine preserved the earliest visual illustration, in literal terms, of the "quicksilver-with-the-blazing-head." Its destruction resulting from crude archaeological methods adds one more to the long list of disasters that befell major sites excavated in Afghanistan by French, Italian and Soviet archaeologists. Part Three. The Sun Shield in the Art of Islamic Iran A long gap follows these representations of the 7th and early 8th century, the last two of which must have been made very shortly be fore the spread of Islam in the northeast and southeast of the Iranian world. No significance can be attached to it. It reflects the almost total destruction of the objects themselves. Armenia provides an example of a Sun Shield that conveniently bridges the gap between the 8th century and the earliest illustrations of royal Sun Shields from Islamic Iran. It can be seen on the southern wall of the Church of the Holy Cross, which was built by King Gagik on the island of Aght'amar, probably between a.d. 915 and 921.52 Among the characters carved in low relief on the facade, Goliath is shown standing facing David, who holds a sling in his right hand. Goliath rests a sword on his shoul der with one hand while holding up a medium sized rondache.53 In the middle of the rondache a twelve petal rosette—the same number of petals as on the 10th-9th century shield in New York—stands for the "golden flower of the sun." Regrettably, no shield from Iran survives in tact prior to the 15th century a.d., unless some bronzes which may well be bucklers or shield umbos are taken into account.54 Moreover, al most all of the figurai material which we know to have been abundant from historical and lit erary sources has likewise vanished.

Originally, the circular knop with flat top must either have been gilded or covered with a rosette in gold overlay, re moved since by rough sandpapering. Twelve twisted ribs whirl counterclockwise, standing for the rays of sunlight across the spinning sky. The rays stop about three centimeters from the outer edge. A shadowy line running along the tips of the rays survives in some areas. It sug gests that some material may have been fixed to the steel surface in some way (glueing if fab ric, riveting if hard-boiled hide). Small holes apparently drilled at a late date along the rim indicate that the steel convex disc was then nailed into some hard support, perhaps leather, with padding to conceal it.

Conversely, the sun is the "King of Stars" in poetry. And since the very appearance of the sun conjured up to the Iranian mind the image of a golden shield ("As long as the sun in heaven shall be like a golden shield," Manuchehri says [see pp. 2-3]), it was inevi table that the shield with the effigy of the sun, in any of its straight représentations or its metaphorical guises, would have been Seen as the attribute of royalty in military equipment. Its literary foundations, starting with the Shah Name, guaranteed that in any Eastern court where Persian was the Kultursprache and Per sian literature held sway, the Symbol would be perceived with the same intensity. The Sun Shield thus became the royal shield in the Ira nian World, from the highlands of Kurdistan to those of Kabulistan, from the Persian Gulf to Bokhara and Samarqand. From there it trav elled thousands of miles beyond Iranian bor ders, as far afield as Ottoman Istanbul and the great cities of Hindüstan. Notes *CNRS, Paris A Note of Thanks I wish to convey my deepest gratitude to Dr. Marion True of the j. Paul Getty Museum for giving me the great privilège of Publishing the highly important royal shield to the name of Pharnaces, and to my colleague Paul Bernard for allowing me to mention in advance the outcome of his historical research on Pharnaces I, due to be published in full in the next issue of this journal. Among the many friends in muséums who gave me special help, Anatol Ivanov, Head of the Oriental Department at the Hermitage Museum, and Oleg Kramarovsky, Golden Horde Curator at the Hermit age, sacrifrced a Weekend; Boris Marshak came in on a Sunday to allow me to work in the limited time I had in Saint Petersburg. All were generous beyond the call of scholarly collaboration with a colleague. I similarly wish to acknowledge my debt to Jeanne Mouliérac, head of the Musée de l'Institut du Monde Arabe, Paris; Prudence Oliver Harper, Chief Curator of the Ancient Near East, and Daniel Walker, Cura tor of the Islamic Department, in the Metropolitan Museum in New York; to Jef Teske, Curator of Applied Arts in the Gemeente Museum, the Hague; to Catherine and Ralph Benkaim of Los Angeles, who so kindly gave me the run of their house on a Sunday to allow me to photograph their highly important miniature by sheykh cAbbasI; and to Madame AnneMarie Kevorkian of Paris, expert at the Hôtel Drouot through whose good offices I was able to photograph the Steel shield. Ernst Grube, helpful as ever, allowed me to plunder out of his su perb archive the important photograph of the loose page from a Shäh-Näme. In the course of editing the manuscript, Carol Bromberg drew my attention to the excellent frontal shot showing the king's shield at Tâq-e Bostan published in the second Tokyo Daigaku volume on the site, and John Downey, Ara bic and Persian bibliographer of the Bulletin of the Asia Institute, obligingly arranged to have the pho tograph reproduced.

Sacid Nafisi (Tehran, 1336/1957), p. 9, writes (Hazaj metre): نومني ذلة يض بنير مد كرددن لياشو مند هر ماعت همى ير وغم يكديكر You'd think that under the Dome of Heaven silver atoms Are roused every moment against each other 17. Among the few surviving Sun rosettes painted on plaster at the apex of the dorne, on the inner face, one may cite a monument in Nâ'în identified as the Masjed-e Bäbä ؛Abdolläh, and the mausoleum of Sayyed Rokn ad-Dïn in Yazd. See D. Wilber, The Architecture of Islamic Iran: The إئ Khänid Period (Princeton, 1955), flg. 41, cat. no. 29 and flg. 143, cat. no. 67. Wilber, p. 128, quotes M[yron] Bfement] Smith as saying that a date of Rablc I 737 [/8 Octo berB November 1336] is painted on the frieze be low the squinches of the mosque Chamber. The équivalence of a rosette at the apex of an actual palatial dorne with the sun at the apex of the sky is stated in the highly important poem read by Mo hammad Taql Mostafavi and reproduced by [André Godard] "Darb-é Imam," Àthar-é îrân 2.1 (1937), p. 52. The French translation makes little sense. The relevant distich in this ninedistich dating ghazal or târîkh ["chronogramme"] is this one: ر رثكا شه ابن هثت طاق و نه منظر حو ذره نمص حورثيد كشته مركردان So jealous was it of the rosette [shamse١ of these Eight Vaults and Nine Palaces That the rosette [shumse] of the Sun had its head spinning like the [dancing] atom (misunderstood by the late Godard in his [or, more probably, his wife Yedda's] French translation pro duced, he Said, on the basis of the explanation given by one "Mr. Khan-é Malek" [sie, cited in n. 1 p. 53] as: "De ses huit voûtes et de ses neuf points de vue, la lu mière, jalouse d'un tel éclat, semble aussi égarée qu'un atome dans un rai de soleil"). 18.

The clearest illustrations are to be found in Moghul painting where the emphasis on accurate detail is greatest. See for example G. Sen, Paintings from the Akbar Nama (Calcutta, 1984), pl. 44, with an inscription in red ink calligraphed during the exécution of the manuscript specifying that the painter is Tara Kalan in a composition and outline [tarh١ by Basâvan. The red shield at the bottom shows the four rings to which are attached two cords joined in the middle as a grip. 33</page><page sequence="34">MELiKiAN-CHiRVANi: The Iranian Sun Shield 20. One of these would appear to be represented in the Akbai-Näme mentioned in the previous note: see Paintings from the Akbar Nama, pi. 55. An ob ject, probably a shield, covered with a brocade, is laid on a tray (gold? gilded? bronze?) whose circular outline, seen sideways, appears as an oval. The con text of the miniature would agree with such an in terpretation. Presents are being brought by members of the establishment from the city which opens its gate to the conqueror: a boat-flask for wine, a splen did bird of prey used in falconry, etc., in other words, precious possessions. This makes food on a tray rather unlikely. A shield, on the contrary, could be a truly royal present and in addition symbolize surrender by giving away the royal shield. 21. E.

Embroi dered with deep pinkish red, golden, turquoise, white and yellow silk and silver,- "gold-sheathed" [sic] central boss set with rubies and turquoise. The inscriptions remained unread. Mrs. Atil dates the object to the second quarter of the 16th century. There is a strong possibility that the shield could have been made in the Istanbul royal atelier by Iranian craftsmen. 22.

In the Shäh-Näme, shields are made of steel, rhinoceros hide and wood. Ferdowsl (Mohl IV 98 1. 1107) mentions "rhinoceros [hide] shields" [sepa rhä-ye karg) among the arms and defences accumu lated by Afräsiyäb in his citadel at Gang while preparing to resist the forthcoming onslaught of Keykhosrow. Earlier, as Gorgin and Andariman con front each other, both wield a rhinoceros-hide shield in one hand and, somehow, a bow in the other (III 578 1. 1981). When Siyävush gets ready to dis play his prowess in the lists against Garsivaz and his warriors armed with long spears [neyzehd-ye daräz], the Iranian hero requests four Gilan shields, two of wood [chübin] and two of watered iron [sic: z'ähan-e äbedär], Mohl II 362 1. 1967.

The Ameri can scholar writes p. 252: "Calmeyer suggests that tondi (sic) are not shields or shield buckles [meaning bucklers?], an opinion I share, but rather decorative disks worn on the body. We do not really know how the present tondo was employed but it is obvious that it was meant to be hung or riveted somehow by the pair of holes." He makes no attempt to support this "opinion" on the decorative use of the object with any arguments. A parade shield, or one made for funerary purposes, while not utilitarian stricto sensu, is not quite a "decorative disk." 26. See principally P.

Mrs. Mer hav points out that shields are shown hanging on the walls and pillars of a temple in the Urartian town of Musasir, in the Assyrian bas-reliefs from Khorsabad which were lost in the 19th century. Thus, the Greeks later followed the Urartian tradition. Mrs. Merhav further gives examples of Urartian shields obviously made for ritual display use, not for combat. It is in this context that the Getty shield discussed further must be seen. 33. Accession no. 80.AC.60. Diameter 79.8 by 81.4 cm measured from one rectangular flange to the other.

When consulted on the possibility of the derivation of Pharnaces from Far nah, the ending -ag, Prods Oktor Skjaervo kindly confirmed that it must be the case. F. Justi, Iran isches Namenbuch (Hildesheim, 19632 [repr. of Marburg, 1895]), pp. 92-93, gives a list of historical characters named Pharnak, beginning with a legend ary king of Armenia and, in Hellenized form, Phar naces, of which the earliest is the brother-in-law of Darius III, who fell at Granikos according to Diodor ius and Arrian. 35.

Dalton, Treasure of the Oxus, pp. 42-45, was the first, in 1905, to publish silver from Armenia un der an explicit title "Silver Vessels from Armenia." These include the remarkable drinking horns with a "griffin" (horned eagle) head found in Erzingan (Ar zanjän in Persian, Erzincan on modern Turkish maps) reproduced under no. 178 pl. XXII; a cylin drical box with horizontal fluting "found near Erzingan"; a silver phiale of typical Achaemenid ap pearance no. 80 pl. XXIII; and three silver bowls, the lower part rounded, the other part with everted out curving sides, nos. 182 and 183 identical (illustrated in a line drawing fig. 72 p. 45) and a third one. I can match these with a quasi-identical bronze photo graphed in a Tehran collection in 1968 and have seen similar pieces in Tehran. Dalton draws atten tion (p. 43) to a drinking horn of the rhyton type with a wild goat head illustrated in Les Arts (January 1902), p. 18, and to a similar phiale from Armenia in the Louvre [ibid.). Many more vessels have come to light since then, invariably without officially stated provenance when dug up within the borders of Tur key. Such is the most remarkable of all Achaemenid silver vase-rhyta in the Rothschild collection, Paris, first reproduced in Connaissance des Arts in 1958 and later illustrated by Roman Ghirshman in Perse: Proto-Iraniens, Mèdes, Achéménides (Paris, 1963), fig. 307 p. 254 (provenance not mentioned). More re cently, spectacular objects came to light at Arin Berd on the outskirts of Yerevan of which some actually present features not matched in known Iranian metalwork: see S. Der Nersessian, L'Art Arménien (Paris, 1977) for excellent reproductions of two of these. This raises the question of Arme nian metalwork in the Achaemenid taste, just as in later times metalwork in styles related to Iranian styles continued to be produced. This cannot be dis cussed further here. Such interconnections lead one to expect massive iconographie borrowings by Ar menia from Iran. 40.

Unfortu nately, it is slightly out of focus, overexposed by half an aperture and marred by a magenta cast. The true identity of the horseman remains in doubt. In the past, it has often been established on the basis of insufficient evidence. Friedrich Sarre considered the king to be Khosrow II: Die Kunst des alten Persien, pl. 85. His text p. 43 makes no effort to support the identification other than to state that "the cave, richly decorated with rock reliefs goes back to Khos row (590-629) [and is] according to legend the work of [the sculptor] Farhad." In other words, Nezâmî's 12th-century romance Khosrow o Shirin is Sarre's main argument for identifying Khosrow II. 41. The rendering of the low relief suggests metal lic bands riveted or fixed to some convex surface. One could imagine silver foil covering the surface and gilding for the rosette and radiating strips. Alter natively, the shield could have been made of low grade silver (with about 30 percent of copper, making it harder than pure silver) and gold applications. In modern times polychrome effects were created on North Indian shields with golden brass applications riveted on to a watered steel surface. I have been un able to examine the bas-relief on the spot, which might help narrow down the assumptions. 42. Found in Kulagysh, in the Perm district and discussed many times. See latterly B. Marschak, Sil berschätze des Orients (Leipzig, 1986) pi. 198 (in color). On p. 437, Marshak dates it to the 7th cen tury and places it in "Sogdia or an adjacent area." Best color reproduction with a close-up of the two warriors: The Grand Exhibition of Silk Road Civili zations: The Oasis and Steppe Routes (Nara, 1988), no. 194.

The theme of two heroes fighting it out with every weapon is found elsewhere in Persian litera ture but first occurs in the Shäh-Näme. More partic ularly, there are mentions in the Shäh-Näme of one hero seizing his spear while the other shoots an ar row at his opponent. Precisely the same theme is dealt with in the mural paintings in Panjikand as A. M. Belenizki, Kunst der Sogden (Leipzig, 1980), noted. Compare the line drawing p. 80 and the silver phiale fig. 13. 44. J. Hackin, "Le monastère bouddhique de Fon dukistân (1937)," in ]. Hackin, f. Carl, and J. Meunié, Diverses recherches archéologiques en Afghanistan (1933-1940), MDAFA 8 (Paris, 1959), pp. 49-59. The painting appeared on the lateral wall of one of the nine barrel-vaulted recesses (called "niches" by Hackin) which were dug into the four walls of a vast square hall in the middle of which stood a stüpa. The plan is given p. 51 fig. HI. The recess ("niche K") in which the painting appeared will be found in pp. 57-58. 45. Compare the original fig. 195 top part left, where the left extremity of the trapezoidal outline of the shade of the parasol can be made out, only just, above the lotus bud that appears in the middle of the king's crown, with Carl's copy fig. 199, where that top part is left out altogether. This lotus bud has no parallel in Sasanian crowns but it is common in the royal headdresses worn in the Islamic period down to the 7/13th century by royal figures whose iconographie background is Buddhist. On the Bud dhist background, see A. S. Melikian-Chirvani, Le Roman de Varqe et Golsâh, AAS 22 (1970), pp. 89 96, and "The Buddhist Heritage in the Art of Iran," in Mahayanist Ait after a.d. 900, ed. W. Watson, Colloquies on Art &amp; Archaeology in Asia, no. 2 (London, 1971), pp. 56-65. For an example of the lotus bud in a royal headdress in the Islamic period, see the famous revetment tile with Bahräm Gür and Äzäde molded in low relief now in the Victoria &amp;. Albert Museum, SPA, pl. 727-B. The bud appears between the two wings, a distant reminder of the Sasanian crown. Another example of a masculine headdress with the lotus bud between highly styl ized wings, effectively changed to palmettes, occurs on a polychrome bowl of the 7/13th century [SPA, pi. 687). 46. A similar tunic, for example, is worn by a seated character in room 10 in the Panjikand palace. See Belenizki, Kunst del Sogden, pi. 39, character to the left. 47. They should be compared at that early date with those of an unpublished horseman hawking, his hawk on his extended wrist, which is engraved on a white bronze of the 4/10th century. This was in a private foundation, the cAtä Mohammad Naqsh bandl Collection, in Herat in 1969 when I photo graphed it. I hope to publish it in full in the future. A section of the tray showing the face of the hawk and part of the Kufic inscription was illustrated by me in "The Buddhist Heritage in the Art of Iran," pi. 13 p. 117. 48. Illustrated many times.

Lukonin, Sasanidskoe seiebro (Moscow, 1987), no. 11 pi. 23 (full view, in color) and pi. 22 (detail, including part of leg). The phiale was proba bly made in the 7th or 8th century in Tabarestän. 49. The tiger-skin is Rostam's attribute par excel lence in the Shäh-Näme. 50. Hence the frequent comparison of the sun with the red ruby; hence, too, the perception of red wine as liquid sunlight in reference to sunset and early dawn sunlight.

Gol-e sorkh is entered as "well known" (i.e., "common usage") with the commen tary "that is, any flower that is red." Contrary to widely held belief, the "red flower" is not generally the rose in classical Persian as it is in modern Persian. It describes any cultivated flower of a red color, as stated by Borhän Tabriz!. Similarly, läle, discussed below, is "any flower that grows spontane ously [ = wild flower]" as Borhän notes ibid., p. 1027. He goes on to say that this can be, specifically, the läle-ye Nocmân, in turn subdivided into several spe cies, läle-ye kühl, läle-ye sahrä'i, läle-ye shaqäyeq, etc. In effect, läle mostly refers to the anemone. "Tulip" is a grossly anachronistic translation, in fluenced by the meaning it took in Ottoman Persian and Turkish and, later, in the Persian of Iran when the European tulip arrived via Turkey. 58. In a personal communication dated Sept. 10, 1992, the eminent Iranian specialist in botanical and zoological terminology Hüshang Aclam writes that "the gol-e zard (literally, "yellow rose") must refer (in earlier works) to a yellow rose—most prob ably a variety of tea-rose (Fr. rose-thé), Rosa odorata var. lutea, a 'double' (sad-barg "centifolia") variety of which is mentioned by the vizier Rasid-al-Din Fazl-Allah (d. 718/1318; Atar o ahya', p. 63)." 59.

Here gol is in contrasted parallel with süsan "lily" and must therefore refer to a specific flower which I assume to be the ultimate flower, i.e., the rose. 63. Tarbiyat, "education," and, more specifically, "initiation." The word is used here with a double meaning "to educate" but also "to nurse" a plant. It defies translation in this verse, which is a Sufi state ment meaning that he enjoys knowledge through in herent intuition. 64. An 8/14th century example of such "luminar ies," in this case, candlesticks, is found in a minia ture now in the Freer Gallery of Art. It illustrates Eskandar [Alexander the Great] lying in state, in a wooden sarcophagus set on a high platform. The miniature once formed part of a Shâh-Nâme manu script sold off piecemeal by the French dealer Demotte whose supplier threw away the text, in cluding the colophon. See O. Grabar and S. Blair, Epic Images and Contemporary History (Chicago, 1980), pp. 134-35 (where it is illustrated under no. 39). 65. SPA, pi. 675. 66. Entirely through commercial excavations. Scattered digging started in the late 19th century. Brief mentions are to be found in writings by travel lers such as Dorothy de Warzée, Peeps into Persia (London, 1913), p. 184, with a fragmentary footed bowl and a ten-rayed revetment tile on the plate fac ing it. 67. There is abundant evidence that the artists who painted scenes on polychrome pottery called in classical Persian haftrang [i.e., "polychrome," the word used in this essay rather than the 20th-century dealers' label "mînâ'ï" adopted in the West] were primarily trained to paint in a horizontal format, i.e., came from painters' ateliers. Figurai scenes on some vessels are actually arranged in horizontal registers: SPA, pl. 660-A (three main registers with figurai scenes separated by bands of calligraphy); 660-B (the famous beaker in the Freer Gallery in which Levon Guzalian recognized scenes from the story of Bizhan and Manïzhe); 661-B (two horizontal friezes on a de canter, the main frieze between bands of calligraphy and formal ornament); 676 (two horizontal friezes 37</page><page sequence="38">melikjan-chirvani: The Iranian Sun Shield similarly isolated on a ewer), etc. I intend to discuss this aspect in detail in a paper, showing that the entire body of polychrome pottery was primarily il lustrated with Shäh-Näme motifs and, sometimes, successions of episodes. 68.

The miniature precisely illustrâtes the last four hemi Stichs (out of six) over the frame and the six hemi Stichs under the frame (Mohl II 460 1. 331-33, 339, 334, in that order). The previous distich describes Rostam trying to grab Afrasiyâb by the belt. Fer dowsï then relates how Hümän, who was watching on the side [az karan], brings down his mace, strik ing Rostam's Shoulder. Rostam's face turns red and while he looks back, Afrasiyâb slips away and mounts a steed. The character standing, shield in hand, is Afrasiyâb. 76. W. Schultz, Persische Miniatur Malerei (Leip zig, 1914), p. 3.

These describe the battle in general terms. "Sword-wielding," the epithet attached to Kohram in the Shäh-Näme, is matched in the painting by the sword brandished by the rider at arm's length—the only such weapon amidst the spears held by the oth ers. It identifies Kohram beyond doubt. 78. E. Blochet, Les enluminures des manuscrits orientaux (Paris, 1926|, pl. XXV, upper plate BN. Suppl. pers. 1113, folio 65B.

The miniature clearly shows the concentric circles of wicker or fig tree twigs wrapped in silk withes. On the manuscript, see p. 65, which leaves many questions in suspense ("there was a colophon whose authenticity has, how ever, been questioned": but the writers referred to by Grube are not epigraphers, nor readers of Persian, and the colophon has not been reproduced). In the caption p. 66, Grube says that "this painting is 38</page><page sequence="39">MELiKiAN-cHiRVANi: The Iranian Sun Shield signed by the painter 'Farhad, the most humble of the slaves,' and is dated A.H. 881 (a.D. 1476-1477)."

Kevorkian," BSOAS 5.1 (1928), pp. 97 108. 82. Grube, Muslim Miniature Paintings, pl. 31A. Princeton University Library inventory 94G. Grube, like all other Western art historians who discussed such pages, was unaware of the nature of Moham mad b. Badr Jâjarmî's work, an anthology with short biographical entries composed by a man of letters, who wrote poetry himself. It is a source of major im portance for Persian literature. In his introductory remarks, pp. 39-40, Grube dwells on the character of this supposed "encyclopédie work," which he compares p. 41 with the "Picture-Larousse," mean ing the French populär dictionary Le Petit Larousse Illustré. Neither he nor his colleagues realize that several pages now scattered in American museums relate to two poems, one by Mohammad Ravandi, the other by Jäjarmi himself. The text of the poem concerned here corresponds to vol. 2, pp. 1217-18 of the printed édition. 83. Curiously, the Persian editor did not try to identify "Ostad Mohammad Ravandi," as he is named in the Anthology. This is clearly the famous historian and author of the Rähat os-5odür. See: The Râhatu's-suâûr wa Âyat-us surtir, ed. Muhammad Iqbal (London, 1921). Sultän Suleymanshah, whom the poem celebrates, is the Saljuq sultan of Rum, Rukn ad-Dîn Suleymanshah who seized the throne from his eider brother Ghiyäs ad-Dîn Keykhosrow in 597/1200-1201 and ruled until his death in 601/ 1204-1205. See the volume cited above, English pref ace pp. XIX-XX, on the imperfect efforts of Ravandi to eliminate traces of his original intention to dedi cate the whole work to Suleymanshäh. (He later changed it to Keykhosrow.) This is probably why the poem does not appear in the printed text of Rä vandl's chronicle. It is remarkable that it should have found its way into Jâjarmï's Anthology and sug gests that Jäjarmi had collected early, and probably autograph manuscripts of the rarest type. This is an important aspect of literary and cultural history to which I hope to come back in an appropriate context. 84. I identified in 1983 the nature of the Western "؛azarant" (also "jazeran," "jazerenc" in French) which was considered a "total riddle" by Alwin Schultz, the great German historian of arms and armor. It is a corruption of Persian kazhägandا kazhagan/qazäkand, etc., which reached the West via Syria and was borrowed simultaneously through Arabie, hence jazarant and the Turkish pronuncia tion kazagan echoed in the Latinized form casigans. See A. s. Melikian-Chirvani, "The Westward Jour ney of the Kazhagand," The Journal ٥/ the Arms and Armour Society 11.1 (June 1983), pp. 8 35. 85. M. Jenkins, ed., Islamic Art in the Kuwait Na tional Museum (London, 1983), reproduced in color p. 98. The text begins at the top with the distich: ندبمان نكى دهش بمكني محاق بحة بيكاه ايكنى You are breaking your promise of bestowing good By thus rejecting an innocent boy (Mohl I 222 1. 123; Berfels I 142 1. 102) The miniature illustrâtes the first hemistich in the last of the three distichs in the line above it which reads (Mohl I 224 1. 161-62; Bert'els leaves out the fol lowing two distichs but mentions them in I 144 n. 1؛ محكه كرد بمئ ز انراز كسره بداث حون مام ليد و كروه َف آن آملنش اذبى بمج بود نه ار مهر بميغ او رب بود The Slmorgh looked down from the mountain top He knew when he saw Säm and his party That this Coming of his was on account of the child That this concem did not stem from love for the Slmorgh Not a Word is Said about the number or appearance of the warriors in the party [goruh] or retinue [hasham] accompanying Säm, the Keyanid king. The detail of the three bonded officers, sword and Sun shield in hand, is an addition of the artist. The placement of the significant line over the image is usual at that date in the Fars school.

And not the "Encounter between Tus and Afrasiyab," as stated by Grube.

The next distich, not found in Mohl or Bert'els, reads: دو يّألو برانان براو يخني هى حاك با حون بمراميختند The two heroes grappled in this way Mixing dust with blood Next the two heroes corne to grips by wrestling. There is no mention of the shield anywhere. It is an addition of the artist's own initiative which intro duces a supplementary nuance to what the text says, in this case the characterization of the hero as the one equipped with the Sun shield. This is a subtle process which I first described in my essay on Mirak (A. s. MelikianChirvani "Khwaje Mirak Naqqash," JA 276 [1988.1 2], pp. 97-146; see partie ularly pp. 120ff.) and hope to analyze in greater de tail regarding the Shäh-Näme. 88.
