Inter-sexual interactions also have 'indirect effects' by affecting the fitness of relatives, with important consequences for inclusive fitness. However, inclusive fitness arguments have received limited consideration in this context, and definitions of 'direct' and 'indirect' fitness effects in this field are often inconsistent with those of inclusive fitness theory. Here, we use a sociobiology approach based on inclusive fitness theory to distinguish between direct and indirect fitness effects. We first consider direct effects: we review how competition leads to sexual conflict, and discuss the conditions under which repression of competition fosters sexual mutualism. We then clarify indirect effects, and show that greenbeard effects, kin recognition and population viscosity can all lead to episodes of indirect selection on sexual interactions creating potential for sexual altruism and spite. We argue that the integration of direct and indirect fitness effects within a sociobiology approach enables us to consider a more diverse spectrum of evolutionary outcomes of sexual interactions, and may help resolving current debates over sexual selection and sexual conflict.

INTRODUCTION In sexually reproducing organisms - from yeast to pri- mates - interactions between reproductive partners over mating and/or fertilization are exceptionally diverse and often extravagant. In some species, part- ners feed and groom each other to form a long-term cooperative bond, while in other species they regularly kill or cannibalize each other. The evolutionary signifi- cance of this diversity has been largely interpreted in the light of a balance between direct fitness payoffs to partners and resulting progeny, with focus on the role of sexual selection. While at a proximate level (i.e. regardless of fitness payoffs), successful sexual repro- duction ultimately requires a degree of cooperation between partners, as with most transactions between cooperators, sexual reproduction is also fraught with evolutionary tension. The possibility for members of one sex both to help and to harm members of the opposite sex was already implicit in Darwin's idea of sexual selection [1]. Darwin [1] recognized that sex can introduce two sources of variation in individual fitness: competition among members of one sex over access to reproductive opportunities, and choosiness by members of one sex of reproductive partners of the opposite sex. Together, these mechanisms create opportunity for sexual * Author for correspondence (tommaso.pizzari@zoo.ox.ac.uk).

Owing to the disparity in size of male versus female gametes (anisogamy), it is males that often compete more intensely over access to ova and females that - as a result - display more conspicuous choosiness of potential partners and/or their sperm [2,3] . However, females may also compete, sometimes more fiercely than males [4], and males may discrimi- nate among different females [5] . This approach has therefore helped elucidate con- ditions under which - at a functional level - the direct fitness interests of partners are aligned or diverge, and thus where sexual and viability selection interact to foster mutualistic or antagonistic interactions between males and females. Indeed, much of the recent research can be framed within a framework that seeks to establish the extent to which sexual inter- actions are driven by cooperation or conflict between the sexes. However, this framework fails to consider that inter-sexual interactions do not only affect the fit- ness of the interactants but often also that of their relatives. This has critical repercussions for inclusive fitness and for the evolutionary significance of social interactions between sexual partners. One of the major advances in modern evolutionary theory stems from the Hamiltonian insight of inclusive fitness, 'which allows for interactions between relatives on one another's fitness' [6], by decomposing selection into direct and indirect components, where the latter is mediated by the relatedness-weighted effects on the fitness of social partners. Natural selection leads organisms to appear designed as if to maximize their 2314 This journal is © 2012 The Royal Society</page><page sequence="2">Review. Sexual selection and kin selection T. Pizzari and A. Gardner 2315 Table 1. Behaviours that improve the fitness of the actor are "mutually beneficial' if they also improve the fitness of the recipient (c &lt; 0, b &lt; 0) and are 'selfish' if they reduce the recipient's fitness (c &lt; 0, b &lt; 0). Behaviours that reduce the fitness of the actor are 'altruistic' if they improve the recipient's fitness (c &gt; 0, b &gt; 0), and 'spiteful' if they reduce the fitness of the recipient (c &gt; 0, b &lt; 0). Behaviours that improve the fitness of the recipient (6 &gt; 0) are termed 'helping' and those that reduce the recipient's fitness (6 &lt; 0) are 'harming', irrespective of the fitness consequences for the actor. If behaviours impact upon the fitness of multiple recipients, helping some and harming others, then classification can be done according to the effects felt by the actor's 'primary' recipients. Finally, helping behaviours that have evolved, at least in part, owing to the benefits that they grant the recipient are termed 'cooperation'. This includes all altruistic and some mutually beneficial behaviours. inclusive fitness, which is the sum of their direct and indirect fitness [6-8]. There are two routes by which the organism may increase inclusive fitness, either by increasing the organism's own reproductive success (direct fitness effect) or else by increasing the repro- ductive success of the organism's genetic relatives (indirect fitness effect) [6]. The overall condition for natural selection to favour a social behaviour that incurs a cost c for the actor and provides a benefit b to the recipient is Hamilton's rule rb &gt; c, where r is the genetic relatedness of these two individuals [6,7,9]. If multiple individuals are affected, then Hamilton's rule may be written as rjbi &gt; c, where b{ and r, are the benefit and relatedness corresponding to the ¿th recipient [8]. Hamilton's rule is a fully gen- eral separation of natural selection into its direct and indirect components [10]. Hamilton [6,9] showed that natural selection could drive the evolution of altruistic behaviours, so long as the recipients of altruism are sufficiently related to the actor. More generally, Hamilton's rule predicts when any trait - i.e. altruism, selfishness, mutual benefit, spite and also non-social characters - are favoured by natural selection. The intentional language employed in the study of social evolution is sometimes felt to be undesirable, and efforts have been made in the past to purge the field of such loaded, anthropomorphic termi- nology. However, this concern is misguided. The intentional language is formally justified by the math- ematical correspondence between the dynamics of natural selection and the analogy of the individual organism as 'maximizing agent' [8,11,12]. Moreover, such language defines whole programmes of scientific research in behavioural ecology, for example, on sexual 'conflict'. If agents and their intentions are part of the question, then they must also form a part of the solution [13]. There is growing appreciation that the study of sexual interactions, including studies of sexual selection and sexual conflict, would stand to gain by embracing an inclusive fitness approach, and recent efforts have been made in this direction [14-19]. However, at present, these efforts remain isolated and focused on specific questions. Here, we integrate these studies within a broader sociobiology approach based on inclusive fit- ness theory, to explain the diversity of social interactions observed among sexual partners across a range of sexual organisms by simultaneously considering direct and indirect selection episodes. 2. AN INCLUSIVE FITNESS APPROACH In most organisms, sex is a social trait, an interaction between an actor and recipient(s) of two discrete cat- egories (males and females), which has the potential to change the fitness of each party. The consequences of sexual interactions for the selective process can therefore be categorized using a standard inclusive fitness approach, which decomposes genetic change into 'direct selection' - i.e. owing to the impact of the trait upon the individual's own reproductive success - and 'indirect selection' - i.e. owing to the impact of the trait upon the reproductive success of the individual's genetic rela- tives. The separation of direct and indirect selection (table 1) provides the basis for classifying social beha- viours [6,20], and represents the most fundamental branching in the hierarchy of explanations for Darwinian adaptations, such as cooperation [21]. The idea that natural selection comprises direct and indirect effects is well known in the sexual selection Phil Trans. R. Soc. B (2012)</page><page sequence="3">2316 T. Pizzari and A. Gardner Review . Sexual selection and kin selection literature. However, there is a diversity of meanings attached to these terms, which requires some clarifica- tion. In sexual selection literature, the mechanisms driving sexual preferences are often divided into those conveying net fitness benefits to the individual selecting mates (i.e. preference for specific mates increases its lifetime reproductive success of an indi- vidual), and those conveying net benefits to the offspring produced by mating with preferred mates, through genetic covariance between ornament and via- bility ('good genes') and/or linkage disequilibrium between preference and ornament genes ('Fisherian runaway'). Traditionally, the former benefits are defined as 'direct' and the latter as 'indirect' [22,23] . However, the distinction between 'direct' and 'indir- ect' effects can cause confusion, as offspring survival may be viewed as part of the parent's reproductive suc- cess and, as such, a direct (rather than indirect) contribution to the parent's fitness. Considerable debate has focused on whether 'direct' fitness costs imposed by an actor on its partner(s) might be rescued by 'indirect' benefits associated with reproducing with harmful partners [24-26], and on whether 'good genes' and 'Fisherian runaway' represent two distinct indirect mechanisms [26-28]. Key to resolving these debates is the correct assignment of direct and indirect effects. Here, we employ the formal definitions of direct and indirect fitness that are provided by inclusive fitness theory, as they are unambiguous and funda- mentally connected to the design objective of all Darwinian adaptation. 3. DIRECT FITNESS EFFECTS (a) Selfishness and sexual conflict Conflict arises whenever two prospective partners maximize fitness through different, mutually exclusive reproductive decisions at any stage of the reproductive process, from mating to parental investment [15]. This tension can occur whenever multiple reproductive opportunities are available to members of at least one sex, for the combination of two inter-related factors. First, by its very nature, reproductive invest- ment incurs a fitness cost. This means that the reproductive resources available to an individual are limited and investment in reproduction with a particu- lar partner will automatically reduce the availability of resources for reproduction with other current or future partners. Therefore, evolutionary conflict between interacting males and females is implicit in any mechanism of mate choice, postmating gamete selection or postzygo- tic differential reproductive investment. Second, owing to limited availability of reproductive opportunities, there is competition among members of one sex to access sexual partners. Intrasexual competition can promote traits that enable the carrier to outcompete rivals even when they harm reproductive partners. The 'tragedy of the commons' provides a useful meta- phor [29-31]. This refers to a situation in which individuals compete selfishly over access to a resource, which as a result becomes depleted to the detriment of the whole group. One could argue that males them- selves can often be regarded as a tragedy of the commons, because although relatively few would be required to guarantee the growth of a population, it often pays individuals to produce more than required. In the context of sexual selection, competition between sexual rivals can damage the reproductive ability of members of the opposite sex, and thus reduce the whole mating group's fitness. For example, male harassment of females in their pursuit of mating opportunities can be so damaging to females as to lead local populations to extinction (figure la). Harm can also be mediated by insemination costs (figure 1 b&gt;c). For example, in several invertebrates, insemination is 'traumatic'. In contrast to orthodox genitálie intromis- sion, traumatic insemination occurs through the puncture of the female body wall by highly derived male organs [40]. Similarly, when females mate with multiple males, males are often selected to inseminate larger ejaculates in order to outcompete the sperm of their rivals [41]. However, in many organisms, if too many sperm penetrate the oocyte, the resulting excess of centrosomes may jeopardize zygote develop- ment (pathological polyspermy [42]), resulting in a post-mating tragedy of the commons. (b) Mutual benefits Mutual benefits occur when a male and a female stand to gain simultaneously from the same reproductive decision. The only way to enforce complete sexual mutualism is through the absence of sexual selection. Imagine a species with lifetime monogamy, even sex ratio and zero variance in intrinsic individual fecundity or reproductive quality. Here, we have essentially removed intrasexual competition and individual vari- ation in reproductive success due to differential access to mating and fertilization, the ingredients of sexual selection. Under such conditions, the interests of an individual will coincide with those of its repro- ductive partner, such that the only way for an individual to increase its own fitness is to increase that of its partner. Such 'repression of competition' is one of the mechanisms driving major transitions in evolution, whereby social groups that effectively abol- ish their internal conflicts can be viewed as single adaptive individuals in their own right [43-46]. For example, an ancestral condition of strict lifetime mon- ogamy has probably been a catalyst for the evolution of eusociality [47,48]. The complete absence of sexual selection is clearly rare. However, specific ecological conditions can lead to mating systems in which sexual selection is strongly limited. For example, when reproductive resources are limited and spatially dispersed, strict lifetime mon- ogamy is often the best reproductive strategy, for a range of organisms (figure 1 d,e). Some potential for mutualism for specific reproductive decisions persists even under sexual selection. For example, inbreeding or hybridization may result in such low reproductive success that both partners might 'agree' to avoid mating [14,15,17]. Similarly, in species where males can stimulate female fecundity (for example, through nuptial gifts or spermatophylaxes, figure 1/) to a degree where female reproductive success more than doubles if the female mates with two males, then all Phil.

However, Acps also have a toxic side effect on females, which pay a net fitness cost when exposed to high insemination rates [35]. Credit: R.

Anker (Universidade Federal do Ceará, Brazil). (/) In some organisms, males can boost female fecundity, e.g. through the provision of a highly nutritious nuptial gift or, as in some orthopterans, a spermatophylax (credit: N. W. Bailey). When male stimulation more than doubles female fecundity, both male and female gain if the female remates with another male [39]. three individuals may do better if the female mates with both males [39]. Clearly, the mutualism of this 'ménage à trois' is limited to the decision of whether or not a female should mate with both males. Her promiscuity will generate competition between the sperm of the two males over fertilization (sperm com- petition) and thus sexual conflict over differential sperm utilization and fertilization [39]. Similarly, when male speřm reserves are limited, females might mate suboptimally, paying a fertility cost. However, high mating rates driven by strong male competition might reduce this particular conflict by automatically leading to assortative mating, e.g. more fertile males mating with more fecund females [49]. In fact, we can find some potential of mutualism even in beha- viours such as sexual cannibalism. The females of a diverse range of invertebrate species typically eat the often smaller partners [50]. One would expect this to lead irrevocably to conflict, but this is not necessarily the case. Conflict clearly occurs when the male is eaten before he mates with a female [50]. However, when cannibalism occurs during or after mating, things are different. In some species such as the red- back spider, Latrodectus hasselti&gt; a male has a low chance of mating successfully with more than one female, while females are likely to mate with more than one male [51,52], which means that the ejaculate of a male is likely to face sperm competition. During Phil. Trans. It Soc. B (2012)</page><page sequence="5">2318 T. Pizzari and A. Gardner Review . Sexual selection and kin selection mating, the male red-backed spider somersaults to offer his abdomen to the female mouthparts, and can- nibalism ensues. By feeding himself to the female, a male increases the fecundity of the female and doubles his share of paternity by prolonging mating [53] . Even if a male survived a female, mating damages the male twin intromittent organs (pedipalps) so as to render a male effectively sterile after two copulations [54]. Clearly, a male red-backed spider might have more to gain by defending his paternity with a female than by leaving her to the attention of other males in search of new females. This arrangement would also benefit females unless there are strong benefits associated with polyan- dry. Therefore, under some conditions, male self- sacrifice might represent a mutually beneficial strategy. Clearly, this is a precarious balance: males should avoid such sexual sacrifice as soon as ecological con- ditions shift to make remating beneficial for either sex. And this is what may happen in other species, where males feign their own death [55] or preferentially target well-fed females to reduce the risk of cannibalism [56]. In short, while the potential for sexual conflict appears to increase proportionally with the opportunity of sexual selection, sexual selection and sexual conflict are two distinct evolutionary mechanisms [20], and the former does not necessarily lead to the latter. (c) Enforcing sexual cooperation Cooperation can be enforced even when evolutionary conflict would otherwise occur between partners. There is a diversity of mechanisms through which cooperation can be secured in spite of conflict. These fall into two non-mutually exclusive categories: coopera- tion can be traded for concessions and fitness rewards to cooperating partners, or it can be coerced with the threat of sanctions and punishments of non-cooperating partners. For example, female dunnocks, Prunella modularise often mate and form pair bonds with two males simultaneously. Because these female sexual con- cessions give both males a realistic chance of paternity, both provide paternal care (albeit proportionally to perceived confidence of paternity), enabling females to invest less into maternal care [57]. Similarly, field observations suggest that in Adélie penguins, Pygoscelis adeliae , females might obtain nest material by engaging in extra-pair copulations with unpaired males [58]. A particular case of reciprocal concessions occurs in non-selfing simultaneous hermaphrodites [59]. Here, anisogamy means that each individual produces more sperm than eggs, and at mating will benefit more by giving sperm to fertilize its partner's eggs rather than receiving its partner's sperm to fertilize its own eggs. Therefore, there is a conflict of interest over male (giving sperm) and female (accepting sperm) roles. This stalemate can be resolved by partners taking turns, through reciprocal spawning or inseminations. However, the equilibrium of this tit-for-tat can be vulner- able to the invasion of cheating strategies in which an individual can impose its own reproductive interests (i.e. give sperm). A number of extravagant traits appear to have this function, from the 'love darts' of some snails, coated with allohormones which inhibit sperm digestion by the recipient [60] to the 'penis-fencing' [61], traumatic inseminations and 'sperm-sucking' of some flatworms [62] and the apophallation of the banana slug, Ariolimax columbianus [63]. An additional mechanism to enforce cooperation is by punishing partners when they do not cooperate, i.e. when they behave in a way that reduces the fitness of the focal individual [64,65]. In principle, sexual pun- ishment occurs when an actor is able to prevent a recipient from acting selfishly by imposing (or threa- tening to impose) fitness costs to refrain the recipient from being selfish [64]. In practice, however, sexual punishment is difficult to demonstrate experimentally, although a number of behaviours might have this func- tion. In several mammalian societies, males have been observed to attack females that refuse to mate with them or stray away from their territory [65] . In socially monogamous birds with bi-parental care, males have been speculated to punish their partner when she mates with other males (extra-pair copulations) [66]. For example, in lesser grey shrikes, Lanius minor , where partners often leave the nest to engage in extra-pair copulations, males attacked their social mates when these were experimentally removed from and returned to the nest while fertile (shortly before the onset of egg-laying) but not when the same manipulation was performed when females were no longer fertile (all the eggs were already laid) [67]. A similar pattern may occur in monogamous termites, where inter-sexual aggression (especially male aggres- sion of females) may function to pre-empt rejection [68]. Finally, the high mating costs imposed by males in some species might function as a form of sanction to discourage females from remating [69], or encourage them to invest more in the current reproductive event [70]. 4. INDIRECT FITNESS EFFECTS (а) Sexual altruism and sexual spite Altruism occurs when the actor pays a direct fitness cost to convey a fitness benefit to a recipient. Hamilton [б] showed that genes for altruism can be favoured provided that the recipients of altruism are sufficiently genetically related to the actor. Spite is the more sinister flipside of altruism, whereby the actor incurs a cost in order to harm the recipient, and can be favoured if the relatedness between recipient and actor is less than the average relatedness between indi- viduals in their economic neighbourhood (negative relatedness [7,71-73]). In other words, harming the recipient at your own cost might increase your inclus- ive fitness if the recipient is in competition with your relatives. Often altruism and spite are interchangeable: the same action may benefit some recipients while harming others, so classification depends upon which individuals are deemed the 'primary' recipients and which are merely 'secondary' recipients [74,75]. While altruism has been extensively explored in sev- eral social contexts, its role in sexual interactions has received much less attention. Here, indirect benefits can arise for two reasons: (i) the recipient is related to the actor; or (ii) the actor is related to a third party, who will at some point also interact with the recipient. The former case represents inbreeding, as Phil. Trans. R. Soc. B (2012)</page><page sequence="6">Review. Sexual selection and kin selection T. Pizzari and A. Gardner 2319 Figure 2. Spiteful Wolbachia . Wolbachia is a genus of bacteria, which live symbiotically in many species of invertebrates. (&lt; a ) Mating between infected males (star) and non-infected females leads to cytoplasmic incompatibility, which depresses reproductive success, while assortative matings result in healthy reproductive success. (6) In structured populations, infected males might pay a reproductive cost to mate with uninfected females. The resulting cytoplasmic incompatibility will depress the fitness of the competitors of the male's female relatives [79,80]. it concerns the reproductive decisions of related part- ners (see below). The latter refers to, for example, situations in which intrasexual competition occurs mainly among relatives. In this case, behaviours that harm a partner might also reduce the fitness of the actor's related competitors. Recent theoretical work demonstrates the potential for indirect selection to buffer sexual selection for male harm of females [18,19]. Few studies have explicitly tested these predic- tions. However, a recent study of killifish, Heterandria formosa , demonstrated that females mated to three males genetically unrelated to each other suffer from higher mortality rates than females mated to three full-sib males (unrelated to the female) [76] . Proximally, these results may be mediated by a number of factors, e.g. higher immunological costs associated with responding to three genetically different ejaculates; however, functionally, these results are also consistent with the prediction that males are more benign to their partners when male relatedness increases. A plethora of intra- and inter-sexual behaviours have also been interpreted as spiteful in the past. On closer scrutiny, many of these examples represent the outcome of costly selfish competition. Conditions for spite are stringent [75]. However, under some situations, an actor could be indirectly selected to pay a cost for harming partners of negatively related competitors. For example, male punishment of asexual females has recently been proposed as an explanation for the maintenance of sexual reproduction [77,78]. Cytoplasmic incompatibility induced by maternally inherited symbionts, such as Wolbachia , may also create potential for sexual spite [79,80] (figure 2). Both altruism and spite require that non-zero genetic relatedness arises between social partners. Inclusive fit- ness theory has shown that there are three basic mechanisms for generating this: the greenbeard effect, kin discrimination and population viscosity. (b) Fisherian greenbeards Greenbeards are single genes (or multiple genes, in link- age disequilibrium with each other) that enable their carriers to recognize each other and also behave so as to increase each other's fitness [6,81]. Such genes may be selectively favoured owing to genetic relatedness at the greenbeard locus, even when social partners are not genealogical kin. The Fisherian runaway process, defined as the coevolution of preference and ornament under linkage disequilibrium [28,82], can be usefully thought Phil. Trans. R. Soc. B (2012)</page><page sequence="7">2320 T. Pizzari and A. Gardner Review . Sexual selection and kin selection Figure 3. Fisherian greenbeards. The greenbeard effect is mediated by linkage disequilibrium between a locus coding for a phenotypic marker and a locus coding for a behavioural response to the marker [81]. In a sexual context, allele O codes for a greenbeard ornament and allele P codes for a sexual preference for partners expressing O. Linkage disequili- brium between O and P evolves through assortative mating. Owing to the preference and linkage disequilibrium associ- ations, there is an overall relatedness association (dashed green line). It is likely that allele expression is specific to two discrete categories: individuals expressing O but not P (e.g. males), and individuals expressing P but not O (females), as indicated by reciprocal transparency of Pand O loci. of as a greenbeard effect ( sensu [81]). Here, a gene encod- ing a male sexual ornament is in linkage disequilibrium with a gene encoding a female preference for the orna- ment, because offspring of preferring females tend to have ornamented fathers. The female preference in this case is indirectly favoured because females who express the preference gene will increase the relative reproductive success of ornamented males who will tend to carry copies of the female preference gene, i.e. the preference gene is helping out copies of itself (figure 3). The extent to which the Fisherian runaway and good genes are distinct mechanisms has been the subject of recent debate [26-28]. While these mechanisms are not mutually exclusive and in fact are likely to occur sim- ultaneously, the distinction between direct and indirect effects helps us to identify their inherent difference. The Fisherian runaway works in a greenbeard-like fashion because of indirect selection caused by linkage disequi- librium, while good genes work largely because of the direct effect of viability benefits conveyed to the off- spring through the genetic covariance between the ornament and viability, independently of linkage disequilibrium between preference and ornament. Specifically, the Fisherian runaway requires that prefer- ence is exerted within a generation in which there is linkage disequilibrium between the female preference gene and the male ornament, whereas the good genes mechanism does not. That is, if the female preference gene were 'switched on' in only one generation, it would not be favoured under the Fisherian runaway (it would generate an association with the ornament in the subsequent generation, but the ornament would no longer benefit its bearers), but it would be favoured under good genes (it would generate an association with the ornament, and hence with the good genes, and the latter would remain beneficial to their bearers even in the absence of female preference behaviour). Although greenbeards are known to occur in the natural world - particularly in microbes - they are gen- erally expected to be rare owing to the possibility that 'falsebeard' [81] genotypes arise that express the phe- notypic marker but not the social behaviour, and thus free-ride on the social benefits provided by green- beards. However, in the context of Fisher's runaway model, cheating is less likely because any breakdown of the association between male ornament genes and female preference genes will be countered by the build-up of this association owing to preferential mating of discriminating females with ornamented males. Thus, Fisher's runaway model represents an example of a greenbeard effect that is intrinsically pro- tected against usurpation by falsebeards. An additional peculiarity of sexual greenbeard effects is that they could lead to higher rates of inbreeding [83,84], especially in structured populations, where the prefer- ence and ornament genes are rare, so inbreeding depression may pose a barrier to its evolution that is not experienced by other kinds of greenbeard gene. (c) Kin discrimination Parker [85] had already recognized that inbreeding decisions create potential for both direct and indirect effects, which can result in sex-specific selection on kin discrimination. Imagine a male that has the oppor- tunity to increase his reproductive success by mating with a related female. Because inbreeding may result in inbreeding depression, the male would simul- taneously increase his reproductive success but also reduce the reproductive success of his relative (who might otherwise have mated with an unrelated partner, thus avoiding the costs of inbreeding depression). When the female is sufficiently closely related to the male and inbreeding depression is sufficiently strong, the male will increase his inclusive fitness by altruisti- cally foregoing his chances of mating with his relative [14,15,17]. Similarly, a female might maximize her inclusive fitness by altruistically increasing the repro- ductive success of a relative rather than mating with an unrelated male [14,15,17]. However, because par- ental investment is often higher in females than in males, the male may tolerate a greater cost of inbreed- ing than would the female, leading to sexual conflict over the threshold for inbreeding. As expected, when experimentally exposed to only one female at a time, male red junglefowl, Gallus gallus , will readily mate with their sisters. However, females will typically neu- tralize the sperm of their brothers following copulation [86]. Interestingly, when they are simultaneously exposed to multiple related and unrelated females, males become more discriminant and prefer unrelated partners (Lovlie &amp; Pizzari 2012, unpublished). (d) Reduced sexual ' virulence ' in a viscous world Having clarified that genetic relatedness can strongly mediate the intensity of sexual conflict, we emphasize the importance of population demography. In viscous populations, where dispersal is limited, the genetic relat- edness of neighbours will differ from the population average creating potential for indirect selection on social behaviours. The realization that population Phil. Trans. R. Soc. B (2012)</page><page sequence="8">Review . Sexual selection and kin selection T. Pizzari and A. Gardner 2321 structure might have a strong influence on sexual dynamics is surprisingly recent [87,88]. However, the role of population viscosity has been extensively explored in the context of the evolution of pathogen- induced harm to its host (virulence). Here, the level of virulence is expected to change with the viscosity of the pathogen population and the mechanism underpin- ning harm [89]. Similar arguments can be developed to study the way population viscosity impacts on the extent to which members of opposite sex are selected to harm each other ('sexual virulence'). Recent theoretical efforts in this direction have revealed that patterns of sex-specific dispersal and the scale of competition can have a fundamental influ- ence. In general, when sexual interactions occur on a local scale, individuals have higher potential to simul- taneously help and compete with kin. Imagine, for example, a rather typical situation in which males are sexually selected to harm females (see above). When male competition is largely restricted among male rela- tives (e.g. male dispersal before mating is limited), sexual selection leading to female harm will be coun- teracted by inclusive fitness costs due to reductions in the reproductive success of male relatives caused by female harm [18,19]. Interestingly, when females mate locally they can be evolutionarily indifferent to male harm because inclusive fitness benefits and costs cancel each other out [19]. Imagine now a situ- ation where males disperse before mating but females disperse after mating. Here, the scale of competition for males and females can change drastically. In gen- eral, we would expect females to always prefer the smallest amount of male-induced harm, and males to prefer a level of sexually selected harm inversely pro- portional to local relatedness [19]. The biological reality is likely to be often more complex. For example, in species where a female mates with only one out of several males in a patch and then moves on to a new patch to mate with yet another male, male competi- tion for mating opportunities will be local but sperm competition will occur more globally. It is also likely that - just as in the case for pathogen virulence - the mechanisms through which males reduce female fit- ness (e.g. by shortening their life or by stimulating oviposition rates) interact with relatedness to influence selection on sexual harm. 5. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS Resolving the evolutionary significance of sexual interactions is the first step towards understanding inter-sexual coevolution. Current debate over the evol- utionary significance of sexual interactions is strongly polarized between those proposing that sexual selec- tion necessarily leads to sexual conflict and those advocating that the theory of sexual selection should be rejected and replaced by a theoretical framework entrenched in cooperation. So what do we need to move the field forward? First, we do not need to replace Darwin's theory of sexual selection, as has been proposed recently [90]. This body of theory has clearly withstood the test of time as a very success- ful heuristic tool, providing parsimonious, adaptive explanations for a bewildering diversity of traits and patterns, and revealing the almost universal potential for sexual conflict. However, we have argued here that direct selection alone (mediated by viability and intrasexual competition) is not always sufficient to explain the entire diversity of inter-sexual interactions, and that it is fundamental to integrate direct with indirect effects within an inclusive fitness approach to reach a fuller understanding of the evolutionary signifi- cance of such diversity. We show that this requires a clear definition of direct and indirect fitness and that, out of the two sexual selection models traditionally considered to involve indirect selection - good genes and Fisherian runaway - only the latter conforms to indirect selection as defined by inclusive fitness theory (through a greenbeard-like effect), while the former represents direct selection. This distinction transcends semantics: we argue that when both direct and indirect effects are considered and correctly measured, this enables one to detect a wider range of evolutionary outcomes of sexual interactions (conflict, cooperation, altruism and even spite), and make more sophisticated predictions about how such outcomes are modulated by specific socio-ecological factors, such as population structure, sex-biased dispersal, kin recognition and inbreeding depression. We identify two main integrated goals for future research. First, we need to bring sexual selection and sexual conflict theory more firmly within the wider fra- mework of social evolution. Several authors have recently lamented the gap between sexual selection and social evolution studies, despite the fact that sex is by its very nature a social trait [16,18,91]. Second, we need more emphasis on the ecological details of sexual interactions. Recent work clearly indicates that, for example, the physiological mechanisms through which males manipulate females, and the social structure of the population, can have drastic consequences on the evolutionary significance of sexual interactions, shifting from conflict to altruism or mutual benefit.
