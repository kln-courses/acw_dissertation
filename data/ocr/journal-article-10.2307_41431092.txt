He taught in the Writers' Workshop , University of Iowa 1968-69. This article is an extract from a book on the poets of World War /, to be published by Oxford University Press. 38 Isaac Rosenberg's Rat-God Rosenberg's idea of God can be described with greater precision than can his 'root' image in that he presents the 'idea' as idea and not symbol. The Divine is an idea which if Rosenberg ceased to believe in as an anthropomorphic being, he nevertheless con- tinued to draw on. But the Judiac nature of the Divine undergoes re-interpretation. Initially, as an idea (and not for what it represented) God was for him one who prescribed certain laws, codified through scholarly and rabbinic care, and whose nature was understood in complementary completeness to man's vulnerability and mortality. Any interpretation of or relationship with Him was therefore subject to the strength of that belief which saw man's nature and position as dominated, or rather, fixed, by certain specific manifold demands made by God upon man. Such beliefs were maintained by the Jews in the teeth of, as well as partly through, persecution; and the strength of the human response to the codified beliefs (through whatever motivation) may be attested by any who knew that generation of Jews adult by the end of the nineteenth century. Rosenberg's idea of God changed in the course of living and writing, but because this image of God in its various stages was composed of fairly precise elements (which is partly an oblique commentary on the protective nature of them) one can see the idea changing progressively rather than, as in the symbolic handling of the root, it being used for differing and agglomerative purposes without phased and gradated relation. In Spiritual Isolation (printed in Night and Day , 1912) the relationship involves, as it occurs between God and the human speaker, a diseased or malignant partner and, of course, in the earlier stages of conscious belief, where the image of a deity is a benign one, it is the human that is defective. Arnold in Culture and Anarchy strikingly anticipates the plot of Rosenberg's poem with this comment on The discipline of the Old Testament (which) may be summed up as a discipline teaching us to abhor and</page><page sequence="2">flee from sin ' (my italics). These are the tactics of Rosenberg's poem My Maker shunneth me. Even as a wretch stricken with leprosy So hold I pestilent supremacy. Yea! He hath fled as far as the uttermost star. Yea! all seeing My Maker hath such dread, Even mine own self-love wists not but to fly To Him, and sore besped Leaves me, its captain, in such mutiny. In The One Lost , printed in Youth (1915) but probably written in 1914, Rosenberg introduces the idea that structures God Made Blind. Perhaps tactics would be the right description here, also And I, lying so safe Within you, hearing all, To have cheated God shall laugh, Freed by your thrall. The paradoxical, but quite workable, idea here is of one (human) imprisonment of him being voluntarily used, and in such a way as to cheat the divine agent of a spiritual imprisonment. Compare this with And then, when Love's power hath increased so That we must burst or grow to give it room, And we can no more cheat our God with gloom, We'll cheat Him with our joy. For say! What can God do To us, to Love, whom we have grown into? We are grown God - and shall His self-hate be ? The idea of bursting or growing with love is however found in the last line of Rosenberg's even earlier poem Tess 'Ah, why has God made love so great that love must burst her heart ?' Love must, it seems pay a price for itself to God, or 'cheat', meaning rebel against, God. Thus not only is God Made Blind a more amplified and involuted version of the idea in The One Lost , but it has also an idea from Tess ramified into it. One sees Rosenberg working together his ideas, and composing them into 39 more complex and fuller wholes. It is as though he were gradually writing fuller and fuller statements composed of the earlier partial ones. In both God Made Blind and The One Lost the only way Rosenberg sees for two human beings to enact their love is for them to cheat their God; but one might rephase the emphasis in this situation by saying that the idea of love as the rival imprisoner to God disappears, as does the emphasis on cheating, and that the human beings share their love as they deliberately league against a God jealous of their love for each other. 'For thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul' is the Judeo-Christian view of man's relationship to his God. The human relationship, it adds, may be of another kind, but it is also of a lower. By making his lovers rebel against God, Rosenberg forces this attitude into question. what can God do To us, to Love, whom we have grown into ? We are love, we are God? The rebellion explicitly depends on the ingenious manipulation of the paradox, but implicitly it depends on the courageous rejection of the priorities (above) that religion has hitherto insisted on. The rendering unto Caesar of what is Caesar's (Love) is ingenious superficially, but on a deeper level profoundly antagonistic. That God is love is the merest of verbal declarations here. The emphasis in the poem is upon growth; love must grow, if necessary, subterraneously, as it were, and in the condition of the root. Change and growth are the essence of Rosenberg's ideas. In Midsummer Frost printed 1915 (but written probably before June 1914) Rosenberg uses a tension in which one polarity is made to contain its opposite - as is done in The One Lost and God Made Blind , although with these less for the purpose of exploring the tension itself. In the third of the poems about God, printed 1916, this suspension of one opposite in another constitutes the entire poem's tension In his malodorous brain what slugs and mire</page><page sequence="3">Jon Silkin | Isaac Rosenberg's Rat-God Lanthorned in his oblique eyes, guttering burned! His body lodged a rat where men nursed souls. The Divine body nurses the soul of a rat. This is certainly complex theology, if only because Judaism does not in the main recognise the neo-platonic division of the human being into a mortal body and immortal soul. Thus what Rosenberg the Jew is rendering to both Christians and Jews (who alike believe in a benign God) is a neo-platonically divided, anthropomorphic God, whose soul is malign. And not malign merely, but with a rat-soul, equipped with something that as human beings we generally regard as of inferior creaturely status, even among the animals. This treble hierarchy and concentration of contrasting entities (God:man/man:rat/rat:God) helps to emphasise the idea of the divine but not in- dividually immortal soul of man as nurtured in a human and mortal frame. Both nurtured and nurturing, one might add. But whether this immortal soul is entirely, if at all, within a malign God's competence to give is at least questionable. One implication of Rosenberg's thought here is that the benign God system so far from changing the human system is, rather, itself qualified by the latter. Rosenberg has changed round the relationship that existed between man and his God in Spiritual Isola- tion. In God , it is man that stands firm, representing a comparatively ideal condition, in which he is, after all, striving for that unattainable goodness not how- ever found in God. And to speak of goodness in this context is entirely too static; it is the process and flux of life in which decency is continually evolved, rather than a static idea of condition, to which Rosenberg aspires. But in the progression of these three poems concerning God, Rosenberg has taken an ultimate step; for if in God Made Blind the divinity was to be cheated, He was at least in his authoritarianism thought of as supreme; here He is rejected. And if in the former poem He was morally dubious (jealous) He is here malignant and not to be treated with 40 except as an enemy to be fought; a bully. On fragments of an old shrunk power, On shy and maimed, on women hung awry, He lay, a bullying hulk, to crush them more. But when one, fearless, turned and clawed like bronze, Cringing was easy to blunt these stern paws, And he would weigh the heavier on those after. The bully must be opposed; the bully's only real response to fearless opposition is cringing, which blunts the (magnanimous) claws of the truly strong. All He has is His weight (authoritarian) and this is what He of course crushes His subjects with. The heavier He weighs the more you may know His power is waning. Certainly God is seen as a changing entity in that He once had real power, now a 'shrunk power'. Rosenberg also images God's bullying as psychological as well as physical in manifestation, in that He creates conditions impossible for humanity to fulfil And he has made the market for your beauty Too poor to buy, although you die to sell. 'You die to sell' suggests 'you die in the attempt' as well as the alternative, of 'very much want to', an extremity of wanting that is also of God's creation, tormenting since He has also created those very impediments to your attaining your goal. As in God Made Blind the controller is envious Your wealth Is but his cunning to make death more hard. And again as in the earlier poem, but with the power not as dominating Only that he has never heard of sleep; And when the cats come out the rats are sly. Here we are safe till he slinks in at dawn. The power is not merely less dominating; it is also decayed and sleazy. The confusing part in this passage is I think due to the fact that the rats are the human beings (not God), and that God is the cat. Butperhaps this is an inevitable difficulty forced on Rosenberg by</page><page sequence="4">his pushing on with the main idea, in which, at this junction, we, the humans are not always fearless. Sometimes it is better if we are sly than always in open confrontation with our enemy. Survival dictates the best tactics. I do not think that we should carry over too much if anything of the rat-like character of God onto ourselves who are now in a rat -like predicament. Or if it is there it consists in our temporarily adopting some of the very rat-like characteristics previously of God's character, and that it is His character which forces on us fragments of His conduct. The last stanza, intrinsically, and in its relation to the previous two, is extremely complex, and this interpretation is tentatively offered. The rat- God has gnawed a fibre from strange roots he has eaten at the roots of an alien community, as perhaps (it is intended to show) the Jews have, or as any alien minority must do subsisting in its larger alien host. But as a result the Jewish God is no longer entirely Judaic ; if it weakens, its Judaism has weakened with it. The two results may not be directly inter- related but there is surely some meaning to their suffering similarly. The larger community housing the smaller alien one is of course an instance of the tension of one polarity containing its opposite, as indeed the idea of God containing a rat-soul is. This may seem very like an argument (a partial one since Rosenberg is not altogether deploring the situation) for racial purity, but it might be remembered that racial purity is more terrifying when it is applied by the larger community onto its minorities. I am of course trying to explain the Jewish position as a minority group, not upholding its intolerances, but it might also be recalled that it is the fear among the minority which strengthens these. The problem of relating these two ideas, that of the Judaic strain being diluted, and an authoritarian God suffering similar dilution, remains. That they are related is suggested I think by the fact that at the end of the 41 poem, we, opposed to a weakened God, are ourselves weakened and listless, not perhaps as a result of energy expended in the struggle so much as because we are in relation to a weaker God. And in the morning some pale wonder ceases. Things are not strange and strange things are forgetful. Ah! if the day were arid, somehow lost Out of us, but it is as hair of us, And only in the hush no wind stirs it. We are so motionless that not even the wind stirs us (by implication). 'Hair of us' recalls the thinking in Chagrin (Absolom) and suggests the same kind of depending vulnerability. The only way to avoid the rotting condition of this God Ah! this miasma of a rotting God! and the infecting decay of authority, is to change the character of the authority (if indeed it is to be kept at all) and one's relationship with it. This struggle to change the terms of one's existence is much more overtly the single, dramatic theme of Moses , and in a slightly more oblique way that of The Unicorn and all its versions. It is of course the crucial problem of the individual in a process where démocratisation has given so much power to the state. This theme, of changing the terms of one's existence, is Maccabean in Rosenberg, and in this Rosenberg is a ramifier of ideas. Ramify is the correct word in that Rosenberg never sees the theme simply or the change as easy. Change involves struggle, whether with one's God, or one's society, and for Rosenberg the struggle meant being perpetually open to the present and its pressures. For Rosenberg the past is valuable for what it yields and not for its pro- tective uses as a repository of ideal states and artefacts, and in this, he differs from Yeats. For Rosenberg, although the present might not be ideal he must nevertheless experience it rather than berate it: One might succumb be destroyed [he wrote to</page><page sequence="5">Jon Silkin | Isaac Rosenberg's Rat-God Schiff c. 1915] but one might also (and the chances are even greater for it) be renewed, made larger, healthier. Rosenberg was by this time in the army (as we know from the address heading this letter). He wrote in a similar way, and with regard to the same context of war to Laurence Binyon in 1916: I am determined that this war, with all its powers for devastation, shall not master my poeting, that is, if I am lucky enough to come through all right. I will not leave a corner of my consciousness covered up, but saturate myself with the strange and extraordinary new conditions of this life, and it will all refine itself into poetry later on. Rosenberg was of course extremely vulnerable and open to experience. As a Jew, a working-class man, and a private soldier, he knew vulnerability and its relation to oppression, whether by God (as he con- ceived it), a moral code, a class, the military authority, or the hostile weight of the English. Finally he knew it, alongside millions, in relation to the inescapable war: Thank you for the cheque [he wrote to Schiff] which is as much to me now as all the money in America is to the Allies. As to what you say about my being luckier than other victims [but not more fortunately placed than Schiff apparently] I can only say that one's individual situation is more real and im- portant to oneself than the devastation of fates and empires especially when they do not vitally affect oneself. I can only give my personal and if you like selfish point of view that I feeling myself in the prime and vigour of my powers (whatever they may be) have no more free will than a tree; seeing with helpless clear eyes the utter destruction of the railways and avenues of approaches to outer com- munication cut off. Being by the nature of my up- bringing, all my energies having been directed to one channel of activity, crippled from other activities and made helpless even to live. It is true 42 I have not been killed or crippled, been a loser in the stocks, or had to foreswear my fatherland, but I have not quite gone free and have a right to say something [to Schiff it would seem]. After the impulse of the complaint, the strength of the less heated judgement on himself in comparison to others who were at the moment less fortunate than he, is striking, and attests that the kind of strength he possessed was not so much forceful but robust, the energy of emotion balanced by a deliberate, conscious fortitude. It is an intelligence that could not, to judge from this letter, be shamed into silence by the accusation of selfishness, and could after all speak up for the man. Finally there is in any case a generosity displayed for what was being destroyed. In the struggle to change the conditions of his life, and others, through his writing, and in his daily living, one senses, Rosenberg struck down the orthodox image of a benign God, and of a benign authority which (paternalistically) cared for its subjects (but did not hesitate, either, to rule them if its own interests were at all threatened). Rosenberg wrote the fourth of the 'God' poems before he experienced the trenches (he sailed for France in May or June 1916) so that, taking into consideration the direction of his thinking already established in the others, it seems unlikely that he revoked the image of a benign God through a disillusionment abruptly en- tailed by experience of trench warfare. Such swift, and perhaps, easy change was not Rosenberg's ex- perience, but the gradual shift through perpetual harsh exposure to a variety of pressures that Brooke, for instance could never have been open to. The question of sudden change through French experience is perhaps judged unnecessarily harshly in that such disillusion is perfectly respectable. But I am trying to suggest that such crumbling of belief as Rosenberg experienced in relation to the supposed pity and love of God for his creatures was not produced by a sudden shock. It was, to put it differently, a perfectly</page><page sequence="6">understandable shock, not an abrupt reaction, but an interlocking consideration that grappled with ex- perience over a considerable length of time, judged the issues and found them cast in an image he found unacceptable. His experience of the war merely seemed to deepen by way of confirming his prior direction. And having taken this direction, his abandonment of the struggle with his disposal of a supposedly divine image of God, released him for a closer examination of change and its contingent problems. This is not to say that he was unresponsive to the war, but that like Clausewitz, though from an utterly different position, he treated war as an intensification of pre-war social struggle. He was an almost meticulous reflection of Clausewitz's dictum that: 'War is a continuation of State policy by other means'. And unlike C. E. Montague, who did, it seems, suffer disillusion, he seems not to have believed that there should exist one morality for peace and one for war. Rosenberg's struggle with the image of God (a jealous Old Testament and Christian neo-platonic one) is to be associated, emblematically, with his social struggle as projected, for example, in his Moses wrestling with the Egyptians. Moses' flirtations with the luxuries and benefits obtainable through his co- operation with the Egyptians may have to some extent parallelled Rosenberg's flirtation (it was little more than this) with the richer English literati. Rosenberg eventually realised that he could not join with this God; He had to be fought, as Moses had to fight with the Egyptians. Rosenburg had to struggle with the various pressures of both Jewish authoritarianism and, interwoven with them, the English authoritarian structures, with which he was also intimately involved. He was involved as a Jew, and as a human being existing without ultimate allegiances, except those which make basic human demands. By basic, I should distinguish from it 43 primitive, for Rosenberg was concerned with social relations and the growth of the individual as he comprises the social organism (see the end of Moses). Rosenberg brilliantly projected this human struggle by speaking in personal genuine responses of his ex- perience of the Anglo-Jewish predicament, and by relating it to an (ultimately) human wrestling with divine demands (the struggle with the image of an orthodox God was not only a symbolic struggle). In doing this he showed the inter-relation between the inner and outer complexities and in what way they modified each other; what the individual had to give up by force of circumstance, or choice. He did this without experiencing the lassitude and prostration alternating with cheerful optimism which we find in Brooke's life. In that, he was fortunate.</page></plain_text>
