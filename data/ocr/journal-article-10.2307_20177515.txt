Cobb13 and Adam King2 Frequent population movement and political re-organization spurred a pattern of repeated abandonment at the Mississippian mound center of Etowah in the south eastern United States. These processes also characterized the larger surrounding region in north Georgia and southeast Tennessee. The Etowah abandonments provided inflection points where interest groups were able to distance themselves from previous conventions of structure and reformulate new forms of sociopolit ical organization. Re-invented traditions were embedded in changing definitions of genealogical and mythical time, and mediated through the built environment and iconography. KEY WORDS: Etowah; landscape; iconography; temporality. INTRODUCTION At one time Mississippian mound centers (ca. AD 1000-1500) across the southeastern United States were widely envisioned as following a smooth politi cal curve of ascent, apogee, and eventual dissolution. Numerous case studies have now replaced that universal image of slowly unfolding social reproduction with a ramified one where some towns witnessed brief, violent histories; others en joyed sustained periods of prosperity; and yet others shifted from bustling, secular communities to vacant, sacred centers (Anderson, 1994; Blitz, 1999; King, 2001; Pauketat, 1997; Steponaitis, 1991). Indeed, in many regions of the late prehistoric Southeast, the disjuncture from warfare, conflicts over political succession, and other dramatic events appears to have paralleled the upheaval among contempo rary societies in medieval Europe. Consequently, notions of practice, agency, and 1 Department of Anthropology, State University of New York at Binghamton, Binghamton, New York. 2 Savannah River Archaeological Research Program, P.O.

Various forms of population relocation are now recognized as one of the driving forces behind these disruptions (e.g., Blitz and Steinen, 2002; Cobb and Butler, 2005; Pauketat, 2003). We use the case of Etowah, Georgia?at its peak one of the larger towns in the Mississippian Southeast?to argue that cycles of abandonment and re-occupation highlight the shifting dynamics between structure and agency. We are particularly interested in the ways in which interest groups may have used resettlement to constitute new notions of temporality and power. Even given what we now know about variability in the trajectories of Mississippian mound centers, Etowah underwent a particularly distinct, staccato history characterized by multiple abandonments, re-occupations, and physical transformations. These dynamics simultaneously served to physically erase por tions of the past and to draw a cloak of ambiguity around the dispositions governing structure. As a consequence, each successive occupation at Etowah embodied a distancing from the past, a distancing manifested by different arrangements of genealogical and mythic time. We suggest that the initial Mississippian occupa tion of Etowah was characterized by an emphasis on mythic time and egalitarian relations; the second occupation witnessed the emergence of a hierarchical order predicated on genealogical time linked to a pan-regional emergence of elites; and in its third and final occupation, Etowah became a satellite center of a new capital, where local groups were immersed in a mythic time that disguised hierarchical relations. The successive construction of subjects through the temporal order was accomplished in large part through the built environment and through iconography. MISSISSIPPIAN "STRUCTURES" Since there is no consensus for the ontological or epistemological basis for either agency or structure (Archer, 2003, p. 1), one can at least speculate that some of the enduring patterns in the Mississippian material world comprise some form of structure involving ideas, beliefs, ritual, and rules. At its broadest scope, the Mississippian phenomenon represents a radical transformation of Southeastern societies in North America around AD 1000 (Fig. 1). Maize rapidly gained in importance in the diet, social ranking became greatly pronounced (with the usual reference to "chiefdoms"), population levels climbed, the mound and plaza com plex assumed prominence on the landscape, and certain forms of symbolism and iconography were widely shared (Cobb, 2003; Smith, 1986; Steponaitis, 1986). But this expansive tableau was dynamic, continuing to develop emergent proper ties that came and went through time (Anderson, 1999; King, 2003; Kowalewski, 1996). In one such example, the rise of the Southeastern Ceremonial Complex (SECC) around AD 1200-1350 involved a dramatic upsurge in the production</page><page sequence="3">Re-Inventing Mississippian Tradition 169 Fig. 1. The southeastern United States, with major Mississippian sites referenced in text. and exchange of a range of ritual and prestige objects across the Southeast. These included copper plates, engraved shell, fancy ceramics, and many other items. In another example of a pan-regional concordance, after AD 1300 Mississip pian societies greatly scaled back their earthwork construction throughout the Southeast (Anderson, 1999; M?ller, 1997, pp. 276-279). Nevertheless, sizable polities emerged in the absence of enormous mounds, so the diminished emphasis on erecting earthworks cannot necessarily be attributed to a general waning of the Mississippian phenomenon or of the strength of individual chiefdoms. Within the pan-regional themes, a number of distinctive regional traditions are evident throughout the Southeast. Some of these traditions persist through out the Mississippian period. Whereas wall-trench structures and shell-tempered ceramics dominate in the Central Mississippi Valley, single-post houses and grit tempered pottery prevail in the southern Appalachian region. Briefer, widespread trends also evince regional contrasts. SECC materials are clustered heavily at Spiro, Moundville, and Etowah (see Fig. 1), yet there are marked differences be tween the centers in terms of raw materials and themes (Brown, 2004; Lankford, 2004). In some respects, the Mississippian phenomenon appears to consist of macro- and meso-structures?regional traditions playing off of a grand stage. It</page><page sequence="4">170 Cobb and King would be possible, in fact, to create a conceptual diagram of nested Mississippian structures, growing successively smaller until we reached the level of the site. Such a mechanical, top-down perspective, however, would not dynamically por tray how historical actors were constituted within this milieu, and at the same time contributed to its formation. King's (2001, 2003, 2004) recent syntheses of the punctuated occupational history of Etowah and the surrounding region in northern Georgia have provided the groundwork for moving a step closer toward revealing the various practices that underlay the formation of community and self within the larger Mississippian world. We propose that transformations in these practices were set in motion by pulses of displacement and migration that now appear to have been more common than previously believed (Blitz, 1999; Blitz and Steinen, 2002; Cobb and Butler, 2005; Pauketat, 2003; Williams, 1994). As these studies suggest, population movement fostered episodes of liminality that provided opportunities for distancing from, and scrutiny of, the taken-for-granteds comprising structure. In the case of Etowah, the resulting re-invention of community with each occupation was distinguished to a large degree by differing conceptions of genealogical and mythical time. EVENT AND AMBIGUITY, LANDSCAPE AND TIME It is now widely accepted that the cultural landscape constitutes both a medium and outcome of human action and structure. The production of the built environment is particularly integral to the formation of identity, the construction of belonging, and the establishment of meaning (e.g., Layton and Ucko, 1999; Lovell, 1998; Thomas, 2001; Tilley, 1994). As a consequence, human agency is immersed in the power of place. Places are a product of human action, but they also galvanize action in response to the memories and histories evoked by archi tecture and locations in the landscape (Holtorf, 1998, p. 24; Whitridge, 2004). Mississippian mound and plaza complexes were particularly impressive invest ments of labor that conferred an aura of permanence and power relations rendered tangible and concrete. Yet, spatial discourses are not just about the constitution of identity and belonging, or resistance and domination. Space also invokes acts of forgetting (Yaeger, 1996, pp. 6-8), an obscuring of the past that simultaneously provides the opportunity to rewrite the present and future. With the increasing evidence that population movement was an important process in the production and reproduction of Mississippian places, identities, and relations of power, we suggest that displacement in some regions was a particularly powerful means for the erasure of memory and setting the stage for new ways of "being" Mississippian through the manipulation of different notions of time and history. Our interpreta tion of this long-term process is predicated on the notion that structure frequently is not a taken-for-granted, and at certain junctures may come under acute scrutiny</page><page sequence="5">Re-Inventing Mississippian Tradition 171 and questioning. Therefore, before turning to a consideration of the interplay of Mississippian migration, the physical erasure of memory, and the (re)construction of place and time, we consider the importance of dramatic junctures and ambiguity in the reproduction of agency and structure. Event, Ambiguity, and the Transformation of Structure Despite all of the pathbreaking conceptual work on agency and structure car ried out by Bourdieu (e.g., 1977,1990) and Giddens (e.g., 1979,1984), and despite their provocative case studies that range from Berber households to Modernism, neither has carried out the kind of nuanced, longitudinal class or interest group analysis of the sort one associates with historical Marxists like E. P. Thompson (Mouzelis, 1995, pp. 115-116; Post, 1996). Their approaches do not rule out such an analysis, particularly given the influences of Marxism on their own work. Yet, even Bourdieu's later empirical works on distinction and Giddens' ruminations on the individual and modernism still lack that sense of the construction and recon struction of the historic subject within the framework of the long-term to satisfy the archaeological craving. Their studies are more imbued with a notion of stable social reproduction rather than change (Calhoun, 1993; Lash, 1993). A focus on synchrony does not necessarily undermine the efficacy of various practice approaches, as long as they can accommodate the notion that individuals or interest groups often have the ability to strategically distance themselves and assume a discriminatory stance vis-?-vis habitus and structure (Calhoun, 1993, p. 72; Mouzelis, 1995). No one actor is guided completely by structure or un thinking dispositions, and it is difficult to envision a society composed primarily of what Margaret Archer (2003) refers to as "impeded" agents. Individuals always interact with one another in a relational and often strategic way. Thus habits, customs, and dispositions that stem from structure are enacted and potentially modified in response to the practices of those surrounding us, many of whom may have agendas (and readings of structure) that do not conform to our own. Certainly, actors unconsciously reproduce habituated practices, but they are si multaneously engaged in creative practices?a point central to Gramsci's view of praxis (Crehan, 2002, pp. 81-82). Over-reliance on the dispositional perspective promotes a notion of interaction where rules are governed by structural-functional roles and positions rather than people. In this sense, Bourdieu's habitus shares a weakness with neo-evolutionary schema, such as the chiefdom taxon favored by Mississippian archaeologists. In the Southeast we often portray societies as composed of Elite Suns dominating lowly stinkards, red chiefs competing with white chiefs, and ritual leaders pitched against rank and file. Social roles rather than historical actors or interest groups are portrayed as interacting. However, traditional categories must be deconstructed if there is to be any hope of retrieving the historical subject. At the same time, the move away from categories does</page><page sequence="6">172 Cobb and King not rule out the importance of collective agency or shared practices. At the level of macro-historical change in particular we must be concerned with how interest groups go about constructing social and cultural projects (Barnes, 2001 ; Mouzelis, 1995, p. 113; Post, 1996, pp. 78-81). Groups engaging in collective practices, however, are nonetheless highly fluid as a result of the complex web of shifting relations and obligations idiosyncratic to each member of that group. For this reason agency has an ambiguating quality where pre-defined roles are often unclear and subject to change. Individuals or interest groups engage in a politics of equivocation where their links and identities are multi-faceted rather than strictly fixed (Barnes, 2001; Bartky, 1995; Battaglia, 1997; Chang, 1994). Periods of heightened ambiguity may occur at critical junc tures that are inflection points of structural transformation?periods of abrupt change not well addressed under models of practice theory that stress the incre mental (Calhoun, 1993, p. 72; Post, 1996, p. 102). Bourdieu (1977, pp. 168-169) himself conceded that crisis of some sort was necessary (if not a sufficient condi tion) for the questioning of doxa. Sewell (1996) provides one such example from the eve of the French Revolution, where Parisians found their interrelationships uncertainly suspended between two poles of a proper social order. Were political relations to be based on a spiritual ideology represented by a hierarchical pyramid with King at the apex, or a natural ideology where the General Assembly embod ied the sentiment that all were equal? Not until the storming of the Bastille did it become apparent that a new form of political and social structure was to replace the old. Importantly, such shifts are also accompanied by erasure and silencing, as past dispositions, rules, and beliefs are selectively discarded or altered (Trouillot, 1995; Young, 1990). What could be a more forceful implement and metaphor for rejection of the past than the guillotine? Nevertheless, as we will argue for the case of Etowah, to rewrite the past is not to discard it entirely. Various aspects of tradition may be appropriated in whole or in part by actors, who then frame the connections between past, present, and future as a manifestation of destiny. In this sense, transformations, such as the French Revolution, may be cast in "official" histories as inevitable. In other words, they enunciate a temporal worldview where events may existentially prefigure one another in a way that may not always seem to have a logical cause-and-effect relationship to the outside observer. Landscape, Ambiguity and Time So, how does one transfer this perspective to the material world? Appadurai (1995, p. 207) has pointed out that anthropological studies of place require more than just a history of localities, they need a history of techniques for the production of locality. In many respects, archaeologists have embarked on this history of techniques along a number of fronts. A key element of many landscape studies is</page><page sequence="7">Re-Inventing Mississippian Tradition 173 the relation between the built environment and the temporal order. The production of a landscape and its concurrent (and subsequent) occupation imbue a sense of time through the organization of space and the erection of monuments (e.g., Barrett, 1999; Chapman, 1997; Ingold, 1993; Thomas, 2000). While the spatial order may be an important means for inculcating existential and practical rhythms of the community, space and time are always subject to reworking. Gosden and Lock (1998) propose that many societies employ concepts of both genealogical history (where the past is created through links to ancestors) and mythical history (where a more distant past is evoked), and the ways in which specific groups articulate these histories relative to one another foster different notions of continuity and change. They suggest, for instance, that occupations in the Bronze Age of southern England were dictated by somewhat stable genealog ical histories associated with long-term sedentism and continued burial interment in barrows. In contrast, the subsequent Iron Age was typified by brief occupa tions and short genealogical histories which were potentially disruptive to cultural continuity, but disruptions were offset by a widespread subscription to a shared mythological past. Iron Age groups presenced their mythological past by reusing Bronze Age megalithic tombs and copying decorations from Neolithic pottery. It is important to point out that this pattern does not reflect a simple re placement of one temporal worldview with another. Gosden and Lock (1998) em phasize that different conceptions of time co-exist, yet certain ones may dominate under certain circumstances. Like agency, temporality itself may be conceived and portrayed as heterogeneous and ambiguous within the same setting. As another illustration, Augustus played on different Roman ties to the past to rationalize the fall of the republic and his ascension as the first emperor?a disjuncture of some note in the eyes of Classical scholars. In homage to the more distant roots of Roman power Augustus had his mausoleum built in the style of an Etruscan tomb, capped with a mound of earth and planted with trees. Within his reign he also dedicated the Ara Pacis (Altar of Peace), containing friezes that displayed, among other things, Augustus and his family practicing republican rites which at that point in time (9 BC) had long since been discarded. The processional art, as well as other aspects of the sculpture, elided his sedition of Roman political lineage, promoting the notion that he was a direct and acceptable product of it (Castriota, 1995; Conlin, 1997). Given that the Ara Pacis commemorated several successful years of military campaigning by Augustus, it is easy to see how this narrative was readily embraced. The Roman practice of evoking mos maiorum (the way things used to be) (Castriota, 1995, pp. 144-169), while at the same time subverting it, has?we will argue?its parallels at Etowah. The construction or modification of Mississippian earthworks and archi tecture also played an important role in the creation of identity and the con struction of time and memory at different scales. Although we cannot draw the same detail as for Roman and other well-documented histories, it is possible to</page><page sequence="8">174 Cobb and King characterize broader trends in the manipulation of temporality. Some have ar gued that Mississippian monumental architectural configurations were maps of the cosmos, rooting the community in a sense of universal, ritual time (Wesson, 1998). Other features also may have contributed to the temporality of communi ties. Woodhenges at Cahokia (circular arrangements of wooden posts, apparently aligned with the solstices) possibly represented cosmograms and calendrical de vices (Demel and Hall, 1998; Smith, 1992). Furthermore, plazas formed the center of many Mississippian communities and were likely important settings for ritual activities (Kidder, 2004; Stout and Lewis, 1998, p. 159). These kinds of links be tween Mississippian landscapes and temporality seem to evoke the kind of distant, mythical time referred to by Gosden and Lock (1998). They are suggestive of the universalizing tempo of ritual that stands apart from daily life (Bloch, 1989; Bourdieu, 1977, p. 163). As Joyce observes (1998, p. 159), this dimension of time (which she refers to as "monumental," from Herzfeld, 1991) reduces social experience to collective predictability, where the past is construed as a mosaic of unquestioned categories and stereotypes. Shorter intervals of time, likely genealogical in nature, were also embedded in the landscape. Large platform mounds?typically the residences of chiefly leaders?were built in a series of stages. The addition of each new mantle often accompanied the inauguration of a new chief, and this construction episode was a form of symbolic purification and renewal (Hally, 1996; Knight, 1989). Certain other mounds were consistently used for interring the dead, creating a practice and memory of ancestry. Whereas the larger configuration of earthworks and architecture may have imbued the daily life of actors with a temporal gestalt that spanned generations, the inauguration of chiefs and the burial of the dead were participatory episodes where actors directly forged their ties to past and future. These different conceptions of time were materialized in other realms as well, particularly in certain forms of iconography (Table I). So-called charter myths? allusions to prominent figures in indigenous origin stories or heroic narratives? appear with some frequency in representational art, particularly engraved shell and copper plates. These anthropomorphized references to a somewhat extended genealogical time are offset by motifs that are more cosmological or existential in nature. The latter include representations of the four corners of the earth and the sun (cross-in-circle) and animals (snakes, birds) that dwell in other spiritual planes. Many of these motifs have a history that extends to the present, and our Table I.

While we recognize the dangers of projecting the historical meaning of symbols into the past, we interpret them in only a very general way and will further argue that the contextual evidence supports these inferences. It is our contention that the history of Etowah was distinguished by changing configurations of genealogical and mythical conceptions of time, manipulated by actors and interest groups through iconography and the built environment. Representational art and architecture may confer an omniscient sense of time, but they are also imbued with dislocation and uncertainty. Some iconography may have been intended to evoke charter myths, yet its interpretation was subject to multiple readings. The addition of a new mantle to a mound celebrated the new, yet blurred the past. Earthworks and mound centers were never completed overnight, they typically were the product of centuries of production, accretion, and modification. Their construction simultaneously created and obscured, arranged and rearranged. As a result, the long-term use of symbols and of space may contribute to the ambiguity of signification and to different readings depending upon one's social perspective (Thomas, 1993). This kind of unfolding praxis seems to typify the trajectories of many Mississippian communities, where beliefs, ideologies, rituals, and other dimen sions of life may have imperceptibly changed in the short-term, yet culminated in profound long-term effects (Pauketat, 2000). In contrast, more overt acts of ambi guity, erasure, and renaissance can be seen throughout the landscape and material practices of Etowah's occupation. These appear to have been prompted and ratio nalized through a pattern of repeated abandonments and re-occupations that were common throughout northwest Georgia. Unveiling these regional patterns remains a project for the future as the data for many sites are scanty, whereas several major excavations at Etowah since the late 1800s provide us at least a starting point for addressing transformations in temporal world views. Finally, as we segue into the case study, we should point out that our propositions concerning ambiguity are a work in progress at the empirical level. We use our preceding discussion to make the supposition that abandonments fostered a history of structural uncertainty between periods of occupation, and frame our discussion accordingly. However, it can be anticipated that ambiguity was also pervasive within the occupational phases, particularly with regard to variation among agents about interpretations of iconography, the meanings of landscape, and so on. Such issues receive less consideration here, important though they are. ETOWAH AND THE HIGHTOWER REGION Whereas some Mississippian regions witnessed the precocious appearance of mound centers that quickly attained large size and regional dominance (such</page><page sequence="10">176 Cobb and King ./ "^ j mm W { / '' ^ 9FL3 - Plant Hammond 9BR3 - Two Run Creek 9BR6 ?- Free Bridge 9BR26 - Raccoon Creek 9BR4?* Cony ers Farm 9BR1 - Etowah 9CK5 * Wilbanks 9CK1 - Long Swamp 9CK4 - Horseshoe Bend Fig. 2. Etowah (9BR1) and other mound centers in the Etowah River valley. as Cahokia and Moundville), in other areas smaller regional centers appear to have vied for some time before one ultimately rose to the forefront. One such region fitting the latter characterization is found in eastern Tennessee and north western Georgia and includes the Etowah site (Fig. 2). Years of archaeological research have shown that sites between the Etowah River valley in Georgia and the Chickamauga Basin in Tennessee share a great many elements of material culture ranging from architectural styles to burial practices. King (2004) has called this the Hightower region (see Fig. 1) after a particularly well-defined artistic style recognized by M?ller (1989). Throughout the Mississippian period the Hightower region was a contested political landscape where no single center managed to remain at the fore for more than a century (King, 2001). Regional mound centers rapidly experienced cycles of death and rebirth while populations shifted back and forth in a flux of abandonment and re-occupation (Hally, 1996; King, 2003; see also Williams and Shapiro, 1990, for the larger region). Etowah was clearly in the thick of these unstable developments, charting an undulating life history comprised of three stages, each constituting a distinct set of relations. mm? a Multiple Mound Site Single Mound Site 20 Km</page><page sequence="11">Re-Inventing Mississippian Tradition 177 Stage I. The Mississippian Emergence and the Politics of Universalizing (AD 1000-1200) During the period AD 1000-1200 a small number of Mississippian commu nities emerged in the Hightower region, with the Etowah site established around AD 1000. All were fairly modest places of roughly equal size. Presumably Etowah and these other centers functioned as independent capitals of small chiefdoms. To understand the emergence of these centers, we need to go back to the preceding Late Woodland period (AD 600-1000). At this time, a series of what appear to be autonomous social groups occupied the landscape of northern Georgia and adjoining portions of Tennessee and Alabama. These groups became increasingly dependent on maize agriculture at the same time that intercommunity violence escalated (Cobb and Garrow, 1996; Little, 1999). Some of the earliest palisaded villages in the Southeast appear in northwest Georgia at this time, ca. AD 800 1000. King (2003) has argued that conflict between competing groups was mediated (if not "eradicated) by appealing to universally important themes, primarily world renewal and the fertility of the earth. The evidence for this comes from architecture, iconography, and mortuary treatment throughout the Hightower region, including Etowah. Mound construction was a communal rite of intensification that had a deep history in the Southeast and was associated with renewing the earth and insuring its fertility (Knight, 1986, 1989). The earliest earthwork construction at Etowah, which was modest (two small mounds) and openly accessible (Fig. 3a, Late Etowah phase), suggests that the beginnings of the polity were based at least in part on an ideology that appealed to universal themes that called upon a shared, deep mythical past. This was a past apparently available to a wide spectrum of society rooted in an egalitarian ethos. Architecture also embedded the communal underpinnings of Early Mississippian societies in the Hightower region. Large and sometimes elaborately furnished buildings have been recorded at centers across the region (Kelly et al, 1965; King, 2003; Lewis, 1995; Lewis and Kneberg, 1946; Sears, 1958). The size and configuration of these so-called community buildings suggests that, like the council houses of the historic period, they were designed to host ritual and decision-making events attended by a broad segment of society. One building at Etowah measured over 33 m long (Structure 5) and another (Structure 3) had a two-tiered clay platform and a floor covered with red ochre (King, 2003; Larson, 1971). Burial practices also show little social distinction. During the Early Mississippian period human burials are conspicuously lacking from habitation sites throughout the Hightower region. Schroedl and Boyd (1991) have argued that burials are not found at Early Mississippian habitation sites in eastern Ten nessee because dispersed communities shared communal burial mounds away from residential areas. Differential social ranking in these cemeteries, if it existed, was not materialized through grave goods or treatment. While no burial mounds</page><page sequence="12">178 Cobb and King (a) Phase 1 Fig. 3. Changes in Etowah site structure through time: (a) phase 1; (b) and (c) phase 2; (d) phase 3. are known from northwestern Georgia, the broad cultural similarities between the two regions suggest that some form of modest cemetery burial likely was practiced in northwestern Georgia as well. While the architecture and mortuary practices at Etowah are suggestive of the communal nature of society, the best evidence for a universalizing ideology rooted in mythic time comes in the form of representational art, which is found primarily on engraved shell gorgets (circular ornaments typically worn around the neck). Since these ornaments are most often found in burials, few have been recovered dating to the very earliest part of the Mississippian period. By late in the twelfth century, however, gorgets exhibiting some variant of the cross-in-circle motif (Fig. 4a) have been found (Brain and Phillips, 1996, pp. 21-24; Kneberg,</page><page sequence="13">Re-Inventing Mississippian Tradition 179 Fig. 4. Shell gorget styles: (a) cross-and-circle (?2004 David Dye, used with permission of the Georgia Department of Natural Resources); (b) Hightower turkey cock (?2004 John Bigelow Taylor, courtesy of the Frank H.

McClung Museum, University of Tennessee); (e) Citico (?2004 John Bigelow Taylor, courtesy of the Frank H. McClung Museum, University of Tennessee).</page><page sequence="14">180 Cobb and King 1959, p. 5). This symbol has deep and extensive historical roots in North America and similar gorgets are found elsewhere in the Southeast. The same theme is likely represented in the filfot cross and concentric diamond motifs found stamped onto pottery in northern Georgia at this time (Hally and Langford, 1988). The cross-in circle is believed to be a direct cognate of the four-log fire that burns at the center of Muskogee (Creek) summer ceremonial grounds (Howard, 1968; Lankford, 2004). That fire plays an important role in the world renewal aspects of the Green Corn ceremony (the puskita) held at Muskogee ceremonial grounds every summer. Traditionally and today (Howard, 1968; Knight, 1986) the Green Corn ceremony is a rite of intensification participated in by entire communities. Its purpose is multiple but includes elements relating to the fertility of the earth, spiritual purity, and world renewal. Given these associations, the circle-in-cross references themes that all people in Mississippian society likely had a stake. It was not until AD 1200 that the first recognizable gorget style endemic to the Hightower region appears. M?ller (1989) has named this style Hightower and it has two recognized themes. The most common is paired turkey cocks (Fig. 4b), which Lankford (2004) argues is a representation of the Mississippian conception of the cosmos viewed from the side. The birds represent the Above World, the flat surface This World, and the open space below the Beneath World. A striped pole is the axis mundi that extends from the sun in the Above World, through This World into the Beneath World. The second, and much less common, Hightower theme is the spider (Fig. 4c). The Hightower cut-out spider superimposed over a circle itself creates the circle-in-cross motif. Both the Turkey Cock and Spider themes reference some conception of the proper order of the cosmos and, like the cross in-circle, represent universalizing themes that connect all members of society to some shared conception of the supernatural as formed in the mythical past. By AD 1200, Etowah and the other small centers in the Etowah valley were abandoned. Throughout the rest of the valley little evidence has been found for contemporary non-mound settlements. Across the rest of the Hightower region, the locations of centers shifted within river valleys but otherwise life went on as before. Only in the Etowah valley is there evidence for a fairly dramatic erasure of the Mississippian presence. Stage II. Regional Consolidation and the Politics of Individualizing (AD 1250-1375) The first abandonment of Etowah was not to last particularly long. By some time after AD 1250, Etowah and the surrounding river valley were re-occupied, and the growing mound center experienced a florescence over the course of the Early and Late Wilbanks phases (AD 1250-1375). The bulk of the three largest mounds at the site was built during these phases; the town was modified to create</page><page sequence="15">Re-Inventing Mississippian Tradition 181 a more formalized mound and plaza configuration; and, ultimately, the site was fortified with a ditch and substantial palisade (Fig. 3b and c, Early and Late Wilbanks phases). In the immediate vicinity of Etowah as many as four additional secondary mound centers were constructed and it is clear that Etowah was the dominant center in the Hightower region (King, 2003). The large area encom passed by the fortification ditch (22 ha), and the impressive amount of mound building attest to a considerable investment of labor. Moreover, the layout of the site?with its central plaza set off by earthworks and large platform mounds for elite residences?provides a sense of formal space and an emerging politics of exclusion. A shift to a more exclusive political order is also seen in the arrangement of non-monumental architecture at Etowah. While large buildings did not disappear from the Hightower region, they were now frequently characterized by an associa tion with mounds and with restricted access. At Etowah, a large building was built on the west side of Mound B during the Early Wilbanks phase (AD 1250-1325) (King, 2001). This circular shed-like structure had a ring of benches, an unroofed center, and a central hearth. While seemingly designed for group functions like the communal earth lodges known from historic times, access was clearly restricted: It was enclosed within a wooden palisade wall connecting to Mound B's western flank, positioned within the sacred center of Etowah, and obscured from the view of much of the community by Mounds A and B. The practice of surrounding the bases or tops of mounds (also seen at Mound C, discussed below) with pal isades to disguise the activities within was common throughout the Mississippian Southeast. Such practices of "invisible foregrounding" (see Battaglia, 1995) draw attention to that which is notably absent or cannot be perceived, and in the case of Etowah marks a strong departure from the communal ethos that appears to have prevailed in earlier architecture. Clearly noticeable changes in the Hightower region also occur in mortuary treatment. For the first time, burials appear at habitation sites, including Etowah, in appreciable numbers. While some people were buried in the floors of domestic structures, specialized mortuary facilities in mounds were intended for a limited, and presumably elite, segment of society (Hatch, 1976; Larson, 1971). Burial mounds within sites mark a transition to the importance of genealogical time, where the repeated interment of individuals over several generations provided a visible link to the past. Importantly, the individuals in the earthwork mortuary facilities at Etowah were buried with the often elaborately decorated objects or symbols associated with the SECC. The most spectacular and best known of these mortuary facilities is Etowah's Mound C. Over the course of three different investigations, archaeologists ex cavated some 350 burials from this mound and recovered one of the largest collections of SECC goods in the Southeast (Larson, 1971). Many these ob jects are made of marine shell, copper, and flaked stone. Further, they appear</page><page sequence="16">182 Cobb and King to constitute a relatively redundant set of items that were likely parts of rit ual regalia (Larson, 1971). Many individuals were accompanied by the very same headdresses and other accouterments worn by presumed supernaturals de picted on embossed copper plates and shell gorgets (see below), as if they were literally impersonating or becoming those supernatural beings. This emphasis on the individual stands in stark contrast to the politics of universalizing seen in the Early Mississippian and marks one of the clearest disjunctures brought about by the collapse and re-occupation of Etowah. It is particularly notewor thy that the construction of Mound C was an overt act of erasure, as it obliter ated the location of the large, communal buildings of the earlier Mississippian period. The nature of the representational art made in the Hightower region makes this disjuncture more pronounced. With the re-occupation of Etowah, a new style was introduced to the region: Classic Braden. The imagery on the Classic Braden pieces seems to focus on a single theme, the birdman depicted on famous cop per plates (Fig. 5a) (Thomas, 1894), and originally worn as either head pieces or breast ornaments. The birdman symbolic set is rounded out by raptors, raptor parts (plumes, talons, wings) and the bi-lobed arrow (Brown, n.d.). The introduction of the Braden imagery spurred the creation of a new theme in the local Hightower gorget style and even sparked the emergence of a new copper-working tradition in the region. More importantly, it introduced imagery into the region that focused on a theme that could be used by individuals stressing connections to a super natural hero whose ties to a "charter myth" (Knight et al.y 2001) strongly evoked genealogical time. Fig. 5. The birdman theme: (a) Braden style copper plates (Fig. 243 from Phillip Phillips and James A. Brown, Pre-Columbian Shell Engravings from the Craig Mound at Spiro, Oklahoma, part /, Peabody Museum Press, Copyright 1978 by the President and Fellows of Harvard College); (b) Hightower anthropomorphic gorget (?2004 David Dye, used with permission of the Georgia Department of Natural Resources).</page><page sequence="17">Re-Inventing Mississippian Tradition 183 The Classic Braden style apparently had its roots in the American Bottom of the Mississippi Valley several hundred kilometers to the west, and the cultural mi lieu that saw the dramatic emergence of Cahokia as the major Early Mississippian center in eastern North America (Brown, 2004; Brown and Kelly, 2000). This brings up one of the most interesting elements of Etowah's re-occupation and rise to prominence. The return of people to Etowah marked the creation of a new chief dom with its own justification for a clearly ranked social order. The charter for that new ranking system appealed to beliefs, imagery, and art work that were foreign to the Hightower region. Not only were they foreign, but they also alluded to what may have been thought of as a mythical place of great power in the Mississippian world. At about the same time that the imported, Classic Braden imagery appeared in the mortuary record of Mound C, it appears that a related, anthropomorphic theme was added to the local Hightower gorget style. These gorgets depict a variant of the same birdman featured in the Classic Braden imagery (Fig. 5b). Given the apparent importance of the birdman in chartering the new social order of Etowah, it should not be surprising that it quickly found its way into the local gorget crafting tradition. Just as the anthropomorphic theme emerged in the Hightower style gorgets, a new gorget engraving style known as Hixon appeared in the region (M?ller, 1989). Its main theme is the same turkey cock of the earlier Hightower style. However, its execution is simpler and more conventionalized. Evidently, the universalizing themes traditionally emphasized in the Hightower region may have persisted, at least in eastern Tennessee, along side or as an undercurrent to the new, individual centric birdman theme. This evidence emphasizes that the rise of genealogical time and an individualizing ethos did not displace completely earlier themes of mythical time. Stage III. Decentralization, Re-organization and a New Political Order (AD 1475-1550) By AD 1400, and probably before, Etowah and the centers in the Etowah valley were again abandoned. While smaller settlements remained in the valley, no political centers were established there again until the dawn of the sixteenth century. Etowah's collapse, while dramatic, was part of a larger regional trend toward decentralization and re-organization. Throughout the rest of the Hightower region, by AD 1450 large and centralized polities had fragmented and created a landscape of numerous, small mound centers on the landscape (King, 2003). Also at this time, the exchange networks that dispersed SECC goods across the Southeast became much more regionalized and in many cases the goods that moved within them became less elaborate. Copper working all but disappeared. Mortuary practices show only traces of the individualizing emphasis seen in the Middle Mississippian period (Hatch, 1976; Humpf, 1995).</page><page sequence="18">184 Cobb and King By the turn of the sixteenth century, a new political order had emerged across much of the interior Southeast?an order witnessed by the Spanish expedition of Hernando de Soto and his chroniclers (Clayton et al, 1993). Rather than the dispersed large and centralized polities that dominated much of the interior Southeast during the Middle Mississippian period, Late Mississippian was the age of paramount chiefdoms. These polities were loosely affiliated collections of smaller chiefdoms and communities strung out over wide areas and held together through some combination of threat and consent. By the early 1500s the Hightower region was apparently drawn into one of those federations, known as Coosa to the Spaniards. Its capital was not at Etowah, but instead was located 100 km to the north at the Little Egypt site. Etowah itself remained abandoned until the end of the fifteenth century and by the time it was re-occupied the Little Egypt site had clearly established itself as the dominant center in the region. Although its history of earthwork construction made Etowah the physically largest site in the Coosa polity, the final occupation focused on a few small mounds at the eastern portion of the site, reminiscent of its first, humble occupation (Fig. 3d, Brewster phase). This denouement appears to have represented both a physical and social distancing from the previous social order that had been constituted around the large mound and plaza complex. Stylistic themes reflect the resurfacing of the politics of universalizing. This is particularly apparent in the evolving representational art of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries AD. Sometime around the end of the fourteenth century, the Hightower and Hixon gorget styles were supplanted by new themes: the rattlesnake in the Lick Creek style and an anthropomorphic Williams Island style (M?ller, 1989). The Lick Creek gorgets depict a wide-eyed, open-mouthed rattlesnake forming a cross with excised portions of the gorget (Fig. 4d). In eastern North American cosmology snakes are associated with the Beneath World (Hudson, 1976, pp. 165-166; Lankford, 1987, p. 83). This symbolism also references the cross-and-circle and its association with both the sacred fire and centered axis mundi (the cross). Again, as in Early Mississippian times, we see emphasis on the proper ordering of the cosmos and perhaps also fertility. The Williams Island style, sometimes referred to as spaghetti gorgets, depicts a lone figure or two figures standing side-by-side. The figures are usually executed as if in motion against a backdrop of swirls. Lankford (1987, pp. 160-165, 2003) has argued that this theme is related to the historically known twins Lodge Boy and Thrown Away. In recorded versions of Creek mythology, the twins have a series of adventures and eventually leave This World to reside in the Above World where they are associated with natural forces, like wind, thunder, and lightening. Therefore, they represent yet another kind of universalizing theme attached to a mythical past that references powers of the natural world. By the sixteenth century, the Lick Creek style was supplanted by the related Citico style (M?ller, 1989). Citico gorgets depict the same coiled rattlesnake theme</page><page sequence="19">Re-Inventing Mississippian Tradition 185 of the Lick Creek style except that the images are more conventionalized and complex (Fig. 4e). At about the same time, engraved shell "mask" gorgets appear in the Hightower region. These are likely the faces of Above World supernaturals (Thunderers) probably not unrelated to the figures in the Williams Island gorgets that referenced Above World natural powers, like thunder and lightning (Smith and Smith, 1989). Interestingly, the Spanish documents describe social systems, like Coosa, as possessing clearly defined hierarchical ranking systems. The chiefs were often dis tinguished from the rest of the populace through special dress, important symbols, residences on mound summits, and being carried on litters (see DePratter, 1991). Thus, an emphasis on individual leaders persists from the previous period, de spite the prevalence of universalizing iconography (King, 1999). Instead of being linked to a specific supernatural entity, however, their positions and power were sustained through political competition and warfare conducted with other elites in the surrounding region. M?ller (1997) convincingly argues that these Late Missis sippian chiefs rarely made important decisions without consulting some broader corporate body of advisors. The renewed appeal to universal themes rooted in mythical time may have reflected an ideology of communalism that belied the actual power wielded by chiefs and other leaders. In the Hightower region, the shifting of the power base to Little Egypt rendered Etowah into a satellite center which may, in fact, have been purposefully populated to draw on the ritual power of a former sacred center. SITES, SUBJECTS, AND APPEALS TO A MISSISSIPPIAN MOSMAIORUM The Mississippian trajectory in northern Georgia embodied a rapid succes sion and spatial relocation of centers of power, mitigating against the sustained climax of any primate centers. Etowah stands out for its size during one phase of its life, but otherwise rose and fell and rose again much like any other center in the region. These political rebirths were defined in part by changes in constitutive rules or acts (see Swidler, 2001), involving new strategies for enacting power relations at a structural level. Thus far, however, we have pitched our arguments more at the level of sites, rather than interest groups and historical subjects. Given our relative lack of robust contextual data for the first phase of Mississippian Etowah, it is difficult to say more than that there was a strong likelihood that it was inhabited by a relatively egalitarian society defined by common interests where accumulation and display were downplayed. Notions of time marked by iconography and architecture appear to have been communal and mythic in na ture, and may have helped to ameliorate growing conflict in the region. For reasons only dimly understood, communities in the larger Hightower region were drawn</page><page sequence="20">186 Cobb and King into the rapidly accelerating events that define the Mississippian period, intensi fying the cultivation of maize and participating in the construction of earthworks. Although these changes eventually would become profound, initially the reproduc tion of everyday life appears to have changed little from earlier Woodland period times. In the second phase of Etowah the relationship of certain interest groups to the larger SECC played a fundamental role in defining their subjectivities. What is particularly compelling about this phase is that, for a brief interval in Mississippian history, a cornerstone of aggrandizement was the appropriation of otherness (see Friedman, 1994, pp. 102-116). In other words, notions of selfhood among certain groups of elites became enveloped in the assumption of identities with foreign origins. The idea of identity appropriation is further supported by the fact that many of the key SECC objects were those of personal adornment. Importantly, this particular embodiment of otherness involved supernatural characteristics, re curring representations in regalia of an apparent eagle or falcon with connotations of the Upper World in Southeastern Native American cosmology. The figure may also reference a warrior-hero from Siouan belief systems?historically bordering the traditional Mississippian culture area?known as Red Horn (Brown, 2004; Knight et al, 2001). Thus, the foreign origins of this identity may have been both geographical and supernatural. We know from Southeastern ethnohistory that important individuals accrued power from their ability to dissolve boundaries of the mortal coil, assuming the characteristics and capabilities of birds, dogs, bears, and so on (Hudson, 1976, pp. 139-148). We propose that the network of important individuals who had preferred access to the materiality of hybridity (raptors and humans) comprised an "imagined community": a group of individuals who may never meet face-to-face, "yet in the mind each lives the image of their communion" (Anderson, 1991, p. 15). For select individuals dispersed across the Mississippian world (but partic ularly at Cahokia, Moundville, Spiro, and Etowah), the dissolution of human and animal ontologies, with particular reference to one or more warrior heroes and ge nealogical time, appears to have been a cornerstone of this imagined community. In contrast, the ideological construction of local subjects was circumscribed. Ac tors in the periphery of Etowah were largely limited to prestige goods displaying communal themes in their construction of selfhood, as opposed to the powerful individualizing themes evidenced in the birdmen. In other words, practices of exclusion emanating from Etowah set a metaphorical ceiling beyond which local agents were denied access to the complete complex of raw materials (particu larly copper) and symbols that indexed the imagined community of charter myth heroes. Different notions of temporality existed side-by-side, but participation in the realm of genealogical time was restricted to only a few. Nevertheless, exclusion was not absolute. Representations of the birdman are found in contexts outside of Mound C at Etowah, but figures do not have the canonical attributes of posture and</page><page sequence="21">Re-Inventing Mississippian Tradition 187 motifs seen with Mound C representational objects, and they are not rendered in copper. The final occupation of Etowah was typified by some degree of hierarchy, but with an allegiance directed toward another center and consolidated primarily through secular power and military prowess rather than referencing supernatural charter heroes. It would be easy to suggest that Etowah had been reduced to a secondary center within the paramount center of Coosa. Yet, this is a very typical argument with regard to the political-economic structure of chiefdoms, and it is more interesting to speculate as to why Etowah would have been re-occupied once again. One possibility is that leaders or interest groups at Coosa decided to populate Etowah with the intent of capturing its power as a symbolic referent to a potent past. The gorget iconography from this phase marks a return to new forms of universalizing motifs, as interest groups re-staked claims to distant, mythical time. At this late juncture in history, however, established patterns of hierarchy established in the Hightower region during Etowah's peak appear to have lent themselves to naturalization through universal themes in a way not possible during the initial occupation of Etowah when experimentations with hierarchy were just on the verge of beginning. How and why decisions were made to vacate Etowah and other settlements? and whether we are dealing with several generations of the same or different peoples?remain a tantalizing mystery. Still, the re-settlements of Etowah did not occur on a tabula rasa. After all, the most recent occupation was still a matter of relatively recent history to the new inhabitants, and they were faced with a sense of the previous order already inscribed into the landscape. Such re occupations were likely attempts to assert ties to the past (Hally, 1996, p. 119). Residents of the Hightower region appear to have incorporated Etowah into their own conception of mos maiorum, making claims to tradition and conti nuity through place, landscape, and iconography, while at the same time con stantly altering the temporal foundations of these traditions through practices of erasure and revamping. Such practices impart a notion of time held among many cultures that mark no radical distinction between past, present, and fu ture, and where history may be ideological rather than contingent. As Anderson (1991) observes, Medieval European notions of the simultaneity of time pro vided a framework where both Biblical and everyday events could be rational ized through prefiguring and fulfillment. To the medieval mind, the sacrifice of Isaac and the sacrifice of Christ bore an obvious, transcendent connection that stood apart from the sequential causality of standardized and incremen tal linear time. Likewise, we believe that successive occupations of Etowah, different though they were, were nonetheless likely rationalized as part of a larger natural order. This natural order not only invoked claims to the past, but articulated a worldview where the past foretells and constitutes present and future.</page><page sequence="22">188 Cobb and King CONCLUSION Although we have focused on iconography and ostentatious aspects of the built environment at Etowah, marked changes in the materiality of everyday life were also felt in the realm of domestic architecture and utilitarian ceramic tradi tions with each re-occupation (e.g., Hally and Langford, 1988, p. 88). Considerable more research needs to be directed toward segments of society beyond the elites that we emphasize, in order to round out this study. Nevertheless, the question remains as to how the distinct occupational stages at Etowah could successively unfold in the same locale?and in a recognizably Mississippian idiom?if they were so very different? It appears that abandonment and re-occupation provided acute historical moments of discriminatory agency where earlier dispositions could be critically evaluated, accepted, rejected, and modified. Opportunistic inflection points were accompanied by significant changes related to the re-organization of structure at the same time that a recognizable veneer of "Mississippian" was reproduced. These were periods when the interactive effect of agency and structure had freer play precisely because unanchored categorizations could be brought into question. Yet, the power of place provided a continuity to these traditions. We have framed the successive occupations as predicated on differing notions of power and temporality, where mythical time loses importance to genealogical time, only to regain prominence?albeit under altered circumstances?in the fif teenth century. This admittedly somewhat mechanical perspective is in part a function of the data currently available to us, and certainly the inhabitants of Etowah were embedded in a world of multifaceted rhythms worthy of further exploration and analysis. Moreover, these inferred temporal shifts characterize agency in a collective sense?a portrayal for which we are less apologetic. As we argued earlier, while agency writ small may be an important point of depar ture for immersing oneself in the quotidian, at the level of political, economic, and cultural transformation, the importance of collective action and its manifes tation in landscape, iconography, and other realms of material culture cannot be overestimated. In terms of collective agency, what is fascinating about northern Georgia is that abandonment and population movement were not epiphenomenal to the deep structure of the region, they were in fact fundamental to the reproduction of what appears to be a tradition with a predilection for fresh starts. Abandonment set the stage for a Zeitgeist of ambiguity and distancing from dispositions, as re occupations fostered reworkings of the cultural landscape, material culture, and temporality. Nevertheless, we do not wish to leave the impression that the struc ture/agency dyad undergoes significant change only in the form of saltations; the Mississippian case in northern Georgia merely offers a significant example of one key avenue toward transformation. However, in the same way that both Darwinian gradualists and punctuated equilibrium adherents in evolutionary theory had to</page><page sequence="23">Re-Inventing Mississippian Tradition 189 find a rapprochement, adherents of practice theory must accommodate the myriad avenues and tempos that lead to alterations in the social sphere.
