<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Science of Culture. By LESLIE A. WHITE. New York: Farrar, Straus and Company, 1949. xx, 444 pp. $6. In the history of American anthropology, three men each symbolize and focus the emergence of an era of revolutionary formula- tions and methodology. While he did not by any means stand alone, Lewis Henry Morgan did more than any other American of the nineteenth century to launch the scientific study of primitive society and to bring to bear upon it the resources of secular evolutionary philosophy. He thus rescued it from the my- thology and piety of explorers and missionaries. Franz Boas, originally trained mainly in the physical sciences, developed the culture-area concept and applied it as an inductive technique to investigate and describe many phases of primitive life. Incidental to this he called attention to what he regarded as many errors in the orderly evolutionism of Morgan, especially hasty generalizations and many errors in detail. Boas and his school gained all but complete dominion over American anthropplogy during the generation following about 1910. Now Leslie 87</page><page sequence="2">88 BOOK REVIEWS A. White has arisen to challenge the dogmatic discreteness and inconclusiveness of the Boas School and has sought to rehabilitate evolutionism in the setting of contemporary anthropological knowledge, mainly that which Boas and his disciples accumulated, partly with the aim of discrediting the evolutionary position. Whatever one may think concerning the validity of Dr. White's program, nobody who is fair and informed can well deny his great courage, energy, determi- nation and consistency. Morgan had to battle against ignorance and the vested supernaturalism, but the trend of the scholarship and thought of the time was overwhelmingly on his side. Boas had to attack the vested interests of evolution- ary anthropology and sociology which had provided an orderly and succinct scheme of social and cultural evolution that was pree-minently easy to memorize and expound. But he soon built up a large group of powerful disciples who took over the controversy that his critical strictures produced. Dr. White was com- pelled to struggle almost single-handed against virtually the whole anthropologi- cal profession for some years. This required both nerve and conviction, as the reviewer has good grounds for realizing by recalling his own battle against con- ventional historical and sociological tenets. In this, his first substantial theoretical treatise, Dr. White is not so much con- cerned with his campaign to reestablish evolutionism as he with the effort to define, describe and launch a new social and historical science, which he calls culturology, though he makes it clear that this new science must rest upon firm and unabashed evolutionary principles. He would put this new science at the apex of the hierarchy of the sciences, thus displacing sociology as it appeared in the classifications of Comte, Spencer, Ward and others. While it would make use of historical, psychological, sociological and anthropological data, culturology is a distinct, more inclusive and more advanced science. Its central theme, culture, is "a distinct and separate class of super-psychological, super-social phenomena; a process sui generis with its own laws." It is constituted of "all the ideas, beliefs, languages, tools, utensils, customs, sentiments, and institutions that make up the civilization of any people, regardless of time, place, or degree of development." It is limited solely to the human species since man, alone, is able to make use of symbols, a matter to which Dr. White devotes a special chapter. Chapters V and XIV of the book are given over to an account of the gradual development of culturology and a delineation of its nature and problems. Part II, which is the main controversial section of the volume, is concerned with many cogent illustrations of the manner in which cultural factors determine and guide individual and social behavior, mental patterns, the achievements of men of genius, and the main trends of civilization. He seeks to put to rest for all time the illusion of "anthropomorphism." While Dr. White's broad conception of culture makes this theory of the cultural causation or determination of history an inclusive one, he agrees with Morgan that material factors are the most important in the whole range of cultural influences, a matter which he elucidates in a brilliant chapter on "Energy and the Evolution of Culture," laying great stress on what he calls the "Fuel Revolu-</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 89 tion," which many would identify with the Industrial Revolution follow- ing 1750. We have no space here to weigh counter arguments or to suggest the qualifi- cations which many who are in general sympathy with Dr. White's position might wish to interject at various points in his discussion. But no fairminded person can deny that the author has argued his case with great power and com- plete consistency. His book is a masterly contribution to a new perspective on human development and a fruitful technique wherewith to describe and interpret the historic experience of mankind. It rises above the level of supernatural dogma, metaphysical quibbling and personal wrangling, and suggests stimulating vistas in the formulation of human knowledge and its governing concepts. It will take its place along with Morgan's Ancient Society and Boas's Mind of Primitive Man as a seminal and epoch-making book in the history of anthropological and social thought.
