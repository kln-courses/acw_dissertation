THE MESSAGES OF THE PROPHETIC NARRATIVES J AND E. § 8X. Understanding that the Judean Prophetic Narrative Called J (§ 58, I) had its origin in southern Israel between 800 and 850 B. C., we may ask ourselves: What was its message ? What ideas, new and old, concerning God, and man, and life did it teach to the people of that period ? This message, we must note, is not the story, nor the series of stories, which J contains, but the lesson which these stories were meant to convey. It will be discovered by (a) analyzing the stories one by one, (b) determining the underlying ideas, and (c) studying the point of connection between these ideas and the times of the prophet who tells the story. The follow- ing selections will perhaps indicate the scope of the narrative and furnish a basis for the inquiry proposed: I. The formation of man after the animals; the garden Gen. 2:4b-3:2I. Of Eden, and the temptation; sin, followed by the curse and expulsion from the garden. 2. The murder of Abel by Cain; the building of the first 4:I-26. city, and the progress of sin in the development of the arts of civilization. 3. The sinful intercourse between angels and women, 6:I-8;7:I-5,7-IO, the birth of giants; further development of sin, followed sI2I7b3b222f&gt;28 by the deluge, in which all are destroyed save the family of Noah. 4. The beginning of vine-culture and drunkenness; the 9:I8-27; II:I-9 further growth of sin, followed by the confusion of tongues 4I-28 ff&gt;; I2 I- and the dispersion, with the selection of Abraham's line. 5. The stories of the several collateral branches of I6:Ib, 2, 4-I4; I9: Abraham's family, viz., Moab and Ammon, Ishmael, Arab 235.-638; 24 I descendants through Keturah, and others with the selection of Isaac's line. 36I</page><page sequence="2">362 THE BIBLICAL U'ORLD 25-2I-26a 27 Ia 6.

Keep in mind (I) that J is history (not like D, § 29, 5&gt; which is largely legal), and that this history indicates the- spirit of the prophet (not, like P, § 29, 5, which is strongly priestly); (2) that J, like other prophets, speaks for God, i. e.&gt; he interprets the events of past times from the point of view of God, as he conceives him; (3) that Jselects only such material as will enable him to accomplish the purpose he has in mind; (4) that his selection, therefore, will be greatly affected by his thought concerning God and sin, i. e., by the thought on these subjects which he wishes to present to his contemporaries.t § 82. Constructive Study. Study each section of J included in the analysis given above (§ 82), with a view to collecting data that will throw- light upon ie following heads: I. The prophetic character of the narrative. 2. The idea of God which it represents, including all references to art overrulirg prov?derce. 3. The sdea entertained concerning man and his relation to God, sin,. and ddiverance. 4. The ethical standards which the narrative seems to advocate. x The pragmatic element in I (nsd in E) is, of course, but slightly manifest, if- we compare it with the later represetion of this sasne element in D and P. At the same time, neither J nor E may be regarded as a collection of uncolored folk-lore. Cf. GEORGE F. MOORE, art.

The feeling of the writer toward outside nations and his idea of Israel's future as a nation. 7. The degree of importance attached to the land of Canaan and the representations made concerning it. § 83. The Prophetic Element in the narrative as a whole should be formulated. In connection with such effort- I. Study the general framework of the narrative, from the story of Eden to the settlement in Canaan: (I) Is a definite purpose to be discovered ? Does this purpose relate to the origin of the people of Israel ? (2) Is there evidence of a desire to connect Jehovah with this origin and with its subse- quent development ? 2. Is the spirit throughout that of insight into Jehovah's plans, recognition of the consequences of sin, encouragement toward higher ideals of life ? 3. Is there a reflective element to be seen in the fondness for incorporating (I) songs and sayings which involve Gen. 6:I-4; 6:5- anthropological observations, or (2) remarks which contain Gen. I6:9I3, Esod. reference to the origin of customs and of names? (3) Is it II5-.34 Gen. 32x. possible to make out quite clearly a definite purpose which, 32- one may suppose, explains the presence in the collection of a given story, or, at all events, its general form and colonng ? 4. Is there evident everywhere a strong interest in the Numb. 22:3b-36;: national, as distinguished from the institutional,2 side of J48h.27.32b;8:23. affairs ? Why is this element to be treated as pre-eminently prophetic ? 5. To what extent is the predictive element present? Consider, e. g., (I) the first prediction concerning the history Gen. 3:I4, I5. Of sin, its long struggle with mankind, but the final triumph of humanity, though wounded in the conflict; (2) the repre- @:26, 27. sentation of the relations of Shem, Ham, and Japheth; (3) Ge4 I72:t53I 8t3 the patriarchal blessings (involving great numbers, great 27:27-29. prosperity, and blessing to the world) placed in the mouth of 49 8-I29 (a) Abraham, (b) Isaac, and (c) Jacob; (4) the forecast of Numb.24 I7-Ig. Israel's relation to the nations. How far, now, are these utterances the very message of the prophet for his timesN 2 The narrative of the origin of the Passover (Exod.

Is there to be noted throughout the narrative a tend- ency toward idealism Z Just how can this best be defined ? Does the writer present pictures of life, which he would have his contemporaries observe in order that their life, still lower than the ideals presented, may be lifted to a higher plane ? Consider the picture thus presented in the pen-portrait Gen. I2:I-4a,68; of (I) Abraham, representing the ideal of intimate acquaint- 26.6I433I6,IF33; ance and communion with Jehovah; (2) Isaac and Jacob, I7-w 323:43-59 representing the superiority of the Hebrews in all relations with other peoples because of their especial relation to Jeho- 39:IH23;43:I-44: vah; (3) Joseph, representing the vindication and triumph of the pure and upright, notwithstanding the machinations Exod. I.8-I2, I4a, of wicked opponents; (4) the oppression in Egypt and deliver- 555, 8-:20-9-7; ance from the same, representing the wonderful power of 34-,4etc. 9- Jehovah in triumphing over the mighty gods of Egypt; (5) 34:I-28.9 5; the giving of the law on Sinai, teaching the awful sanctits- Numb. I4:4I-45; of Jehovah and the absolute authoritsr of his law; (6) Moses, 0 * 4 2- representing the ideal of a national leader, taking every step Josh. 5:I3-I5; 6: in absolute dependence upon the guidance of Jehovah; (7) I67b'I 7;37 Joshua, representing courage and success due to obedience to Jehovah's command to exterminate the Canaanites. § 84. Constructive Study. Consider the message, in general, intended for people linng 800 to 850 B. C. contained in a presentation of (I) Israel's actual origin under circumstances of so peculiar and elevated a character; (2) the origin of Israel's neighbors under circumstances of an entirely oppo- site character; (3) the origin of customs (e. g., marriage) and of names (e. g., Jacob and Israel); (4) stories like that of Cain and Abel, or the angels and women, or the elevation of Joseph, or deliverance from Egypt, or the giving of the law on Sinai; (5) so many points relating to the nation as such, at a time when Israel believed herself to be a nation side by side vith other nations; (6) predictions assuring plents- and prosperity; the degradation of enemies, and victory and world-power for Israel herself; (7) pictures of ideal life for individual and for nation. § 85 The Conception of God, of supernatural beings, and of an overruling providence is after all, the most funda- mental element in the message of anv prophet.

Consider (I) the significance of the fact that Jehovah is everywhere, from the earliest times to the end, the name Gen. 4:26. and title of the Deity; (2) the principal meanings which have been suggested for Jehovah.3 2. Inquireinto (I) thewriter'srepresentationof Jehovah as doing many things ordinarily ascribed to men, some of them being quite undignified; e. g., (a) as molding, blowing, smelling, coming down; also (b) as fearing, repenting, argu- 2:7; 8:2X; I: ing, etc.; note, further, (c) the still more strange represen- 32:24-30; E tations in the stories of the wrestling of Jacob and the cir- 4 4- cumcision of Moses; and (2) the proper interpretation of this material (a) as expressing J's conception of God, (b) as reflecting the opinion of J's times. 3. Note the agents through whom Jehovah is repre- sented as acting in his intercourse with men, viz., (I) Gen. I6:7: angeGs what was the idea entertained in J's times of the 4° Exod- nature, abode, and function of angels? (2) captains of the Joshb52I23- hosts what is meant by "hosts" in this phrase, and in the phrase Jehovah of hosts?4 (3) piGar of cGoud and fire- EXOd.I3:2I. CI 7.

What is it ? I Consider (I) the story of the origin of man, including Gen. 2:4b9, I5- as it does the idea of molding from clay, the contempora- 4- neous origin of animals, and the later creation of woman; (2) the writer's teaching of the dualism of human nature, 2:7. the two elements being matter (dust) and spirit, each being independent of the other; (3) the character of man, viz., 8:2I. 4'evil from his youth." (4) Is it of man as an individual, or of the people as a whole, that this prophet speaks ? 2. Study (I) the account of the beginning of sin through Gen. 3:I2I. disobedience; (2) the forecast of the struggle between sin 3 t5. and humanity, a struggle in which man will at last be victor; (3) the representation of the writer that sin increases with 4:I24. each forward step of civilization, that is, with the develop- ment of the various arts; (4) the terrible growth of sin, until 7 t-5- it is so great that the race itself (except a single family) must perish; (5) the sin of Noah in introducing vine-culture; 9:20 27. (6) the rebellion of men against the Deity, followed by the tI:I. confusion of tongues and the dispersion. 3. Take up, likewise, the writer's conception of deliv- erance from sin, as illustrated (I) in the stories of the heroes, Gen. 26:6I3. Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, and Moses; especially their 345a.94II9 deliverance from evil situations consequent upon sin, e. g., Isaac's equivocation in calling Rebekah his sister and Abimelech's discovery of the deception; Jehovah blesses Jacob on his way to meet Esau whom he has defrauded. Joseph is freed from prison and made governor of Egypt and so enabled to help his treacherous brethren; (2) in the I4:II-I4. stories of the nation's frequent deliverances, in spite of sin, from hostile foes, and after disgraceful acts involving rebel- lion and backsliding; e. g., the deliverance from Pharaoh's pursuing army notwithstanding the murmuring and lack of confidence of the Israelites; the defeat at Gibeon of the five Josh. Io &lt;7; Ix kings allied against Israel; the victory over another body of 4 allies at the waters of Merom. (3) Note, likewise, (a) the Gen. 3:I-24; 4:9 fundamental place occupied by the idea of Jehovah's atti- 2 ;33. 5; tude toward sin and his readiness to bring deliverance (cf. the name of Joshua=Jesus=Jehovah delivers; (b) the Gen. 3:ISI9. prophet's explanation of all labor and toil, of all misery and</page><page sequence="8">368 THE BIBLICAL TFORLD J°Eh dchap. 7; suffering; (c) the strictly national coloring of the idea which always appears, and the consequent uniqueness of Israel's Gen.2g:26,3I. position among the nations; (d) the certainty of the disas- trous consequences of sin in the case of good as well as bad men; e. g., Jacob's treachery repaid by that of Laban; Esod. I:22&lt; It: Pharaoh's scheme for destroying Israel's children avenged by the killing of the first-born of Egypt. 4 Take up for examination those instances of deliver- ance, suggested by J, which perhaps point forward to the messianic hope and prepare the way for its realization, and Gen. 3G15. include at all events, (I) the promise that the seed of the woman shall wage continual warfare with sin as represented 27:2ga. by the serpent; (2) Isaac's blessing of Jacob, which con- templates a future pre-eminence of Israel among the nations 49:IO. of the earth; (3) the outlook for Judah which finds expres- Numb.24:x7. sion in Jacob's blessing of his sons; (4) the lofty position predicted for Israel in one of the oracles of Balaam. § 88. Constructive Study. Upon the basis of § 88 prepare a statement which will connect J's teaching concerning sin and deliverance with the needs of the times of 800 to 850 B. C., remembering that never before in Israel's history had the sinful character of the nation been more strongly pronounced, and also that, if exer in the nation's history deliverance was needed, this was such a time. In this statement include (I) a definition of sin as it seems to have been understood in these days; (2) a catalogue of the acts which are regarded as sinful; (3) a definition, also, of the word " deliverance," with reasons for using this term rather than the more technical word "salvation;" (4) specific instances of national deliverance between 800 and goo B. C., with specific instances, likewise, of what might be called the very opposite of deliverance. § 89. The Ethical Standards of J are closely related to the writer's doctrine of sin (§ 87); hut some phases of the subject deserve, perhaps, independent study. I. Consider (I) the frankness with which J represents Gen. I2:IO ff. the shortcomings of the patriarchs; e. g., (a) the deception 26:I4. practiced by Abraham; (b) the similar deception practiced 738a9; *4I f.3; 6. by Isaac; (c) the crookedness of Jacob's policy; (d) the 254.I -6; 29 3xff.; polygamy of Abraham and Jacob; (2) the simplicity, andt 30:4ff. in fact, seeming unconcern, with which certain immoral Ig:30-38. transactions are described; e. g., (a) the incest of Lot with 38:I26. his own daughters; (b) the immoral conduct of Judah; (c}</page><page sequence="9">PROPHETIC ELEMENT IN THE OLD TESTAMENT 369 the treacherous and cruel treatment of the men of Shechem 3s,-x9, 26, 2gb-3x. by the sons of Jacob; (d) the drunkenness of Noah; (3) the g-20f. foundation on which the distinction between right and wrong is based; (a) is it law, or the personal relation to Jehovah ? (b) in what respect and why are Abraham and Noah for example, standards, by comparison with whom others are tested ? (c) what other great types of moral rectitude are put forward ? (d) in what sense were Adam and Eve, Pharaoh and Esau types of an opposite charac- ter? (e) what, after all, was the complete duty of man according to J ? 2. Study the relation of the foregoing facts to J's times: (I) How far is the representation here given a reflection of the higher standards of the period? In how far does J hold up ideals which have thus far never been realized? (2) What, briefly, were the national shortcomings between 800 and 900 B. C. ? What were, perhaps, the most striking individual vices of.this period? (3) How definite in J is Elijah's conception of righteousness on the part of rulers ? (4) To what extent does J really adopt the ethical code of the Decalogue ? (5) Does the Zex taZionis, or law of revenge, appear to have prevailed in these times ? (6) State in a few words J 's ethical message to his times. § go. Attitude toward Worship.- I. Prepare a statement which will present J's attitude Gen. 8 Xo; IX 8; toward the prevailing method of worship, including (I) the 4:I3f.4;' IE8Yod. 34 use of altars; (2) the conception of the offering, a present of 35II94f X 26 fruit or from the flock; (3) its cleanness oruncleanness; (4) Ge34.2852°26b.EG°en the use of fire; (5) the necessity of having a priest; (6) the 252°;GeEnY°dXI.8°, use of the oracle; (7) reference to sacred trees, or wells, or :Bx5°dgI9G2en'324. stones; (8) the significance of the large number of stones JO^h.4I6.5I22f;. which are associated with sanctuaries; (9) the emphasis 64ffI,7I3Ge8, II26. placed on the Passover; (IO) the large ritualistic element I4.fXo2IJo3sh34 in the J edition of the Book of the Covenant. Ex30d IX 3-I6. 2. Compare this with the obseryance of the cult in chaP-34 J's times, and determine (I) whether J is in any sense under Canaanitish or Baalistic influence; does he possess Elijah's point of view ? (2) Is he hostile to the high-places ? (3) \hat ideals, if anv, does he present for adoption? (4)</page><page sequence="10">THE BIBLICAL T ORLD 3 Avo Formulate his message on this subject in a proposition of fifty words. § 9I. The Outside World and Israel as a Nation. \hat are J's representations on this subject ? I. Consider the influence on Israel's own thought con- cerning herself of (I) the study of the deliverance from Egypt, an event marking Israel's birth as a nation; (2) the idea which is now entertained of Israel's special mission to the world; (3) the assurance given, doubtless many times, that she is to occupy a place of political supremacy. 2. Observe, further, that, in general, J's point of view with reference to Israel's world-relations is large and broad, as is shown (I) by the world-stories which were collected and made an introduction to Israeljs history; (2) by the very neighborly relations which the patriarchs are repre- sented as sustaining to those about them; (3) by the attitude toward the religious institutions of other nations which from time to time appears. 3. Note (I) that, while no allusion has yet been made which points to the actual separation of Israel from the world at large, other nations are represented as serving Israel, and likewise Israel's god Jehovah (cf. the later specific statements of a different character); (2) that Israel's superiority is clearly indicated in J's stories of the origin of (a) Moab and Ammon, (b) Esau, (c) Canaan, (d) various Arab tribes; (3) that apparently no diiculty is seen in the fact that Joseph marries an Egyptian; Moses, a Midianite; (4) that definite promises of land and national life are made to the patriarchs from time to time, while the necessity is clearly seen of training the nation for its work; (5) the messianic import involved in these assurances.

In view of the extreme importance which must attach to J's conceptions on this question of Israel's relation to the nations, prepare a statement, based on § 9I, which will show (I) the importance of a definite policy at this particular time in Israel's history; (2) what we may suppose to have been the essence of J's position on this question. It is of special interest to inquire (a) whether the idea of isola- tion has yet prevailed to any extent;.(b) the wisdom of the policy, from a pedagogical point of view, of bringing Israel into touch with the other nations; (c) the falsitv of the view which treats Israel even from Abraham's</page><page sequence="11">PROPHETIC ELEMF,NT 131 THE OLD TESTAMF,NT 37I times as " cut off " from the world; (d) the influence of the prophets in con- vincing Israel of her world-mission. § 93. The Relation Sustained to J by Later Prophets and by J to later prophets is of importance in determining with exactitude J's own position. Consider- I. The ideas of J, already mentioned, which were taken up and developed by later prophecy; e. g., (I) the conception of Jehovah (§ 86) as faithful, merciful, just, hating sin, all-powerful, and ever-present among his people, all of which attributes are dwelt upon by Amos, Hosea, and Isaiah; (2) the conception of sin (§ 88) as essentially a product of the will of man, and the large place given to pointing out the evil effects of sin; is not this characteristic of all genuine prophecy? (3) the germ of the messianic hope (§ 87, 4) which became later so large an element in prophetic thought; and (4) the conception of Israel's mission to the world in general (§ 92). 2. Specific allusions to the traditions and utterances of J found in the prophecies of Amos and Hosea; e. g., (I) Am. 2:IO; 9:,; citations of the Exodus and wilderness wanderings as proofs HOS.

Understanding that the Prophetic Narrative E (§ 58, 2) had its origin in northern Israel between 800 and 750 B. C., we are to ask ourselves the same question that was suggested concerning J (§ 85): M;hat was his message ? It will be noted, at the very outset, that, since J and E are both prophets or prophetic schools, and live about the same time, great similarity will be expected in their teachings. In the study of E emphasis may be placed on points in which he differs from J. The fact that one wrote primarily for southerr Israel, the other for northern Israel, will explain many of the points in respect to which differences are found. The following passages may be regarded as representatire of E: I. Abraham's deception of Abimelech with reference to Sarah. 2. The expulsion of Hagar and her son from Abraham's family. 3. The proposed sacrifice of Isaac. 4. The flight of Jacob from Laban with the theft of Laban's gods. 5. Jacob's journey to Bethel where he builds an altar. 6. Joseph's experiences in prison and his interpretation of Pharaoh's dream. 7. Joseph's treatment of his brethren in Egypt. 8. The birth of Moses and his adoption by Pharaoh's daughter. 9. Israel's victory over Amalek. IO. Jethro's advice to Moses concerning the administra- tion of justice. I I. The story of the seventy elders. I 2. The blessing of Moses. Gen. ZO:I-I7.

These include- I. A strongly marked prophetic character, which is seen in (I) the representation of Abraham as a prophet; (2) the 4GIen38so 7 ascribing of Elohim's spirit to Joseph; (3) the lifting of Deut.34 Io-Is. Moses to the highest possible position in prophecy; (4) the Bsod. I 5: 20; representation of Miriam as a prophetess, and of Balaam Numb- 23 5&lt;4- as a prophet, although a non-Israelite; (5) the continuation Numb. II:I6,24&gt; of the divine direction through the seventy elders; (6) the JO38°h.x:I. characterization of Joshua as Moses's minister and as the servant of Jehovah; (7) the presentation (although rare) of Gen. I5 5; 46 3. predictions concerning Israel's greatness, including fore- casts of the future by Isaac and Jacob; and, still further, (8) the hero-stories which are intended to serve as ideals for 27:39f.; 48:2o. the Israel of the writer's own day, and, as such, to be 2°3I 47I6setIc I3 regarded as his anticipations, in fact his predictions, of Israel's future glory; (g) the general representation of theo- Josh.,chap.X4. cratic guidance and control which prevails. 2. A conception of God characterized by several striking facts; viz.: (I) the recognition of three different stages of growth, including (a) the situation of Israel's early ances- tors, when polytheism and idolatry were in vogue; (b) the Jo8h.24:2. religion of Abraham, and especially that of Jacob, who has seen the angels of Elohim and immediately introduces a reformation in his clientage by burying the strange gods under the oak at Shechem; (c) this is followed by the later Gen. 3s s-4. revelation of Jehovah; (2) the use of Elohim as the word ltwod. 3:I5. for the Deity, until Jehovah is revealed, and its continuation Gen. I3:I7-I9; I8: afterward side by side with Jehovah and in certain special tgff., Gen. ZI.' phrases; (3) the frequent allusion to angels; (4) the frequent 28'.3IX, ;3I--II7, use of the dream as a means of revelation, especially in the Gen. 2o:34 69;- s8: story of Joseph; (5) the very significant use of the plural 42-s9.3t t° 24; of the verb when employed as a predicate to the word for Gen- :IO:I3; 3I 53- God Elohim; (6) the fact that the representations of the Deity are generally less crude than those of J, and partake far less of the anthropomorphic character; (7) the use of Gen.3I 4a,53;s the phrase "fear of Isaac;" the sacred stone; the pillar at Jo8hBX4dX7.33 9 the door of the tent speaking; the stone of witness; (8) the Gen.22:x. peculiar representation of the deity as "trying" his people;</page><page sequence="14">THE BIBLICAL WORLD  374 Josh. 6.20; Exod. (9) the custom of treating important events as the result of the direct action of the Deity, and not as having come about Gen.so:2g; 45:58. through the interposition of human effort; (IO) the use by the Deity of men to accomplish his plans, although they may be ignorant of them or hostile to them. 3. Other characteristic teachings may, perhaps, be grouped Cf.Gen. chaps.x6 together, the more important being (I) a clesire to shield the reputation of the patriarchs by relieving them of the responsibility in certain transactions, thus showing a keener Gen s8.J,8:soa, ethical sense than J exhibited; (2) a definite recognition of 27, E:sodb33 7- the patriarchal cultus, including the tent of meeting (which 1S30. was placed under the charge of Joshua, rather than Aaron Gen. 20:I-I7; 2I: and his sons), altars, pillars, but no priests; (3) a lack of interest in the outside world, and in the connection of Israel's history with this world, but an attitude toward neighboring nations altogether friendly; (4) points of contact with Amos and Hosea; cf., e. g., (a) the widely differing conceptions of Hos.o I3f.;8 IIf. Israel's future in E and Amos; (b) the contrast between the attitude of E and that of the prophets toward the high- Hos. 9:I0; cf. places and ancient sanctuaries of Canaan; (c) Hosea's * 5 3 * reference to the sin of Israel in joining themselves unto AmOs 2 :9; cf. Baal-peor; (d) Amos's allusion to the great stature of the * 3 33 Amorites; (e) the high ethical standard of Hosea and Amos AmO8 I:2-2:3; as related to the corresponding standards of E; (/) the atti- 8-8.; Ho8-7 8 *; tude of E toward the surrounding nations, and that of Amos and Hosea toward them. § 96. Constructive Study.-Formulate, on the basis of § 95, the special points to be noted in E's message to his times, including (I) that which is new in E as compared with J; (2) that which is different in E as compared with J; (3) that which is lacking in E as compared with J.

The Early Laws of the Israelitish nation5 found in three main groups viz., the Decalogue, the larger and smaller books of the Covenant stand related to the prophecy of this period in three ways: (I) they are codified in this period a step which involved general and, indeed, official acceptance; (2) they are appropriated and made a part of the prophetic history of JE a step which signifies their endorsement by these prophets; (3) they serve as the legal basis for the prophetic utterance until the year 62I B. C. They may rightly be regarded as representing prophetic thought. Accordingly, the following study is suggested with a view to determining the character of the prophetic message which was conveyed through these codes to the people of the ninth and tenth centuries B. C. I. An examination of the principal passages relating Exod. 20:2ff., 7; to God, and a formulation of the results; viz., (a) the idea I4,I77 253f.; 34 of Jehovah's jealousy what is meant by this term ? (b) the prohibition of improper use of the divine name what is involved here? (c) the thought of God as bestowing the blessings of crops and herds; (d) the thought of God as Israel's God. 2. Similar treatment of passages in which allusion is 20:4ff.,7,8ff.,23; made to actions or conduct which may be termed trargs- I3, 24, 32;;343. gressions against God; e. g., idolatry, polytheism, improper use of the divine name, sorcery, blasphemy, uncleanness. 3. Similar treatment of passages in which allusion is 20:8ff.,24-26;22: made to worship, dealing, e. g., with the sabbath, the altar, I8f.3 34.31846.7 offerings of first-fruits, sacrifices, clean and unclean, the feasts. 4 A classification of the laws involving the relation of (a) Exod. 20:I3; man to man in various activities of life, together with a 22 25,28-32,(b) statement of the fundamental principles which seem to I-4,57f., IO'I3-, (C) 2I :2-II, 20, underlie these enactments; e. g., those relating to (a) per- 26f-; (d7) 2(0tI2, sonal injuries and loss of life; (b) theft and violation of I4; 2I 33-36 trust; (c) the rights of slaves; (d) filial reverence; (e) dam- (o 2(2 4f., 256- age to property; (/) loans; (g) testimony; (h) the exercise of 23-I-3; (h) 22 kindness; (i) bribery; (j) covetousness.

Constructive Study on the Early Judean Narratives in Judges, Samuel, and llings.-Take up these narratives (see § 58, 3-6) for considera- tion in the same way as the foregoing materials, and endeavor to formulate (I) the writer's point of view as seen in his choice of materials and in his version of the story; (2) the purpose of the writer as revealed in his pre- sentation of his materials; (3) the prophetic element in his narrative; (4) the teachings on the great themes of prophecy, viz., God, sin, Israel's future, righteousness, and deliverance; (5) the points of agreement and difference in comparison with the method and ideas of the J narrative in the Hexateuch. What conception of Israel's history prevails in these narratives ? What national ideals are here presented ? § 99. Constructive Study on the Early Ephraimitish Rarratives of Judges, Samuel, and lRillgs. In the same general way, consider these nar- ratives (see § 58, 3-6) and compare them with the foregoing Judean material on the various points at issue, noting (a) the points of agreement and (b) those of variation, and formulate the teaching of these writers with refer- ence to the times and circumstances which they were striving to influence. How far is the teaching determined and influenced by the environment amid which it found utterance ? What outlook for Israel is here presented ? The material, thus far considered, might for many reasons be called pre-prophetism, i. e., the movement which arose, developed, and prepared the way for true or real prophetism, i. e., prophetism in the purest and highest sense. It is generally recognized that the latter begins with Amos.</page></plain_text>
