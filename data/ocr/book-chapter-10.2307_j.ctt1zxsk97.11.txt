<plain_text> <page sequence="1">  Dialectical Theology in the Search for  Modern Islam Abdulkader Tayob Studies on Islam and modernity have grappled with what has happened  to Islam in the modern world. As a tradition, culture, or religion, what has  become of Islam since the transformation of the globe through industrialisa- tion, capitalism, and colonialism? Has Islam taken on a new form, or does it  continue earlier forms and traditions in essential ways? What are the values  promoted by Islam and Muslims in the modern world? Most recent studies  on these questions f ind the focus on Islam and modernity too broad and  generalised. Preferring local and contextual studies, Islam in modernity in  its most general sense has been moved to the background, or into the public  sphere. However, terms referring to the broader interaction between Islam  and modernity have not been given up. Terms such as “Islamic modernity,”  “Islamic modernism,” “modernist Islam,” or simply “modern Islam” have not  disappeared completely. To these may be added the plural forms of Islams  and modernities, producing a bewildering variety of representations. They  still appear repeatedly in the literature, begging for clarif ication or f illing  an un-f illable space. The questions and formulations of modern Islam have been depend- ent on the use and meaning of “modern” and “Islam.” Both these terms  are used extensively, and unavoidably, to identify the particular turn of  modern Islam. The use of “modern” ranges from the Marxist, to the liberal,  to Weberian, and also to postcolonial and postmodern def initions and  inclinations. The Weberian definition and assumptions of modernity have  dominated literature on modern Islam, and occupy pride of place. Like the  term “modern,” the reference to Islam cannot be taken for granted. The  unified and obvious reference to a single tradition breaks down upon closer  scrutiny. In his magisterial study of Islam, Hodgson offered a set of terms  (Islam, Islamic, Islamicate and Islamdom) that privileged religious founda- tions, while giving space to cultural and other historical developments. His  suggestions have not found great favour among scholars of Islam, least of  all among those who work in the study of modern Islam. But the search for  a proper term for Islam has continued into the twenty-f irst century. One  persistent suggestion since the 1970s has been the use of “Islams” to reflect  the multiplicity of interpretations and cultural formations that constitute  </page> <page sequence="2"> 162 aBdulk ader TayoB  religious experiences (El-Zein 1977). Varisco argued for “Islams” in anthro- pology to stand for “how Islam is lived in a unique social setting” (Varisco  2005, 140). This contextual focus has become the preferred approach among  scholars generally suspicious about the viability of any generalisation that  can be made on Islam and modernity. But the use of “modern” and “Islam”  persists in the literature, including in the use of the plural. And this usage  begs clearer explanation, on how “Islam” or “Islams” in local context are  related to each other. In the following, I propose that these questions on modernity and Islam  be placed in the framework of the much longer history of kalām (dialectical  theology). Scholars in the modern academy, usually focused on variations  of a Weberian framework, were addressing questions that were uncannily  similar to those asked by Muslim theologians within kalām in the past.  Kalām questions were f irst posed during political disputes among Muslims  after the demise of the Prophet, and then ref ined further in the encounter  of Muslim intellectuals with the Greek Hellenic heritage. The consequent  theological disputes turned around questions such as “What is the nature of  God?,” “Who is a Muslim?,” “What is Islam and faith?,” and “What are values?”  Under the impact of Max Weber’s sociology of religion, scholars have asked  similar questions with regard to modernity. Explicitly or implicitly, they  often asked if Islam and Muslims were modern, modernisable, or modernis- ing. Their questions too could be summarised as “What is Islam?” and “Who  are the Muslims?” This chapter focuses on modern studies on Islam and examines their  theses and perspectives in the framework of kalām. It argues that modern  studies on Islam were adding new dimensions to the identity of Muslims  and the meaning of Islam. If kalām was an exercise in identifying the true  believer, modern studies were separating modern from traditional Muslims.  The binary opposition between the modern and traditional became the basis  of a new sectarianism, constructed and debated in the same way as earlier  sects ( firaq) were debated by kalām scholars in the past. Similarly, under  the impact of Hellenism, and new intellectual and cultural changes, kalām  scholars had defined Islam in relation to custom (sunna), to a mythological  past, or to rationality (ʿ aql). In modern Islam, Islam was identif ied as a  tradition as opposed to modernity, and later as text and as discourse. Fol- lowing leads in the social sciences, such perspectives added new meanings  to Islam. Modern “Weberian” scholars were admittedly merely describing  Muslims in the modern world. From a kalām perspective, however, they  will be shown to frame the meaning of being Muslim in the modern world.  I pursue this identif ication and framing, and conclude that justif ication  </page> <page sequence="3"> dIaleC TICal Theology In The SearCh for modern ISlam 163 and representation were the major pre-occupations of studies of modern  Islam. Modern Islam, f irstly, was a justif ication of Islam in the shadow  of a Western trajectory of modernisation. Secondly, it was a diff icult and  eventually failed attempt to represent Islam and Muslims. 1 Working with Modernity and Kalām Weber is not always quoted at great length in the literature on Islam and  modernity, but the questions that he asked of traditions and their relation  to the emergence of the modern West abound in the literature on modern  Islam. Weber closely examined the theologies and ethics of emerging Prot- estant cults and sects and their impact on social and economic behaviour. In  Max Weber’s sociology, a constellation of theologies, ethics, and economic  conditions gave rise to modernity (Weber 1958). In a similar way, he also  examined the sociology of other religions, including Islam, and suggested  how and why they did not lead to modernisation. Masud and Salvatore  have correctly identif ied this Weberian trend in the literature on Islam  and modernity (Masud and Salvatore 2009). They suggested that scholars  have investigated the nature of Islam, the values it promotes, the societies  it generates, and the identities it upholds. In addition, they proposed that  the Weberian framework could be updated and modified to escape Weber’s  European bias of the nineteenth century. Islam in the modern world could  be examined from the perspective of its impact on social relations (Turner  1974; Eickelman 1981, 269; Salvatore 1997; Stauth 1998). In this chapter, I consider the Weberian questions from a different  perspective. I ask if these Weberian questions may be matched with what  Muslims have done in an identifiable, discursive tradition in the past and the  present. The Weberian questions may be placed alongside similar questions  that Muslims have asked in kalām (dialectical theology) when it emerged  as a scholarly discipline on the meaning of Islamic beliefs, practices, and  values. How have these Weberian studies framed Muslim identities, and  religious objectives and goals? To which identities of Muslims, and which  aspects of Islam, have they directed our attention? Kalām emerged as a discipline in response to political disputes among  Muslims, and then later in response to the impact of Hellenistic philosophy  and the expansion of the Islamic Empire into territories previously domi- nated and occupied by the Sassanian and Byzantine Empires. Thus, one of  the f irst and persistent questions challenging the Islamic community was  the status of a believer who committed grave sins. Does such a person remain  </page> <page sequence="4"> 164 aBdulk ader TayoB  a Muslim? Was a Muslim, thus, def inable in relation to his or her works?  The eponymous founder of the Hanafi legal school, Abu Hanifa (d. 148/767)  is reported to have favoured the view that belief and works were distinct,  and that the f inal judgement should be left to God. This became known as  a murjiʿa position, literally meaning “bringing hope” (in the mercy of God).  It implied that God would forgive a believer on the Day of Judgement, in  spite of his or her misdeeds. Abu Hanifa was opposed to the position that  declared that belief and works (especially grave sins) may not be separated  (Rahman 1979, 85). This was the position taken by the early radical Kharijite  groups who opposed what they regarded as iniquitous rulers that assumed  authority in the Islamic state. Their iniquity rendered them disbelievers, the  Kharijites claimed, and thus unfit to govern. Such political questions were  developed into comprehensive theologies that progressively incorporated  questions of free will, predestination and everything to do with human  agency. These queries may be said to be deliberations and intense debates  on the nature and identity of a Muslim: what makes a Muslim? What makes  a heretic? What distinguished a true Muslim from another? Another set of questions emerged from thinking about human obligations  in a changing environment. The expansion of political authority outside  Arabia created new conditions, and thus new questions for the early Islamic  state and society. They included questions on what to do with spoils of  war, but also how to manage social relations, trade agreements, and ritual  obligations. In response to these questions, schools (madhāhib) developed  in the important towns such as Medina, Mecca, Damascus, Basra, and  Kufah (Schacht 1959). Al-Shaf iʿi (d. 204/820), the eponymous founder of  another important juridical school, attempted to limit the use of independ- ent reason, and subject all decisions to the Qurʾan and the hadith of the  Prophet Muhammad. In particular, he circumscribed the application of  qiyās (analogy) and ijtihād (juristic reasoning) used by his contemporaries  and predecessors (Al-Shafiʿi 1940, 1961; Calder 1983). Other scholars took  a different stand, proposing that revelation and reason were compatible  with each other. In their view, the opinion (raʾy) of a believer need not only  be controlled by devotion to tradition. It could also be disciplined by the  exercise of reason. Such a view was held by the Muʿtazilites of Iraq, the earli- est theologians in Islam, who developed an elaborate theology based on the  equivalence of revelation and reason. Many of them held that the exercise  of reason constituted the f irst duty of a Muslim. The nature of God and his  attributes, the meaning of good and evil, and the obligations of a believer  should and could be developed from revelation on the basis of rational  reflection (Watt 1962, 47). These debates on the merits of texts, traditions,  </page> <page sequence="5"> dIaleC TICal Theology In The SearCh for modern ISlam 165 and rationality became the foundation of a discursive tradition on the  fundamental meaning of Islam, and the absolute necessity of key beliefs  that should be adopted by all Muslims. This was the discourse of kalām  that was eventually also shared with Christian and Jewish theologians in  the Middle Ages. Modern scholars have offered interesting perspectives on the purpose  and objectives of these questions and debates among kalām scholars. Gardet  suggested that kalām was “a defensive apologia, the function of which [was]  f irmly to establish religious beliefs by producing proofs, and to cast aside  doubts” (Gardet 1995, 592). Moreover, reason (ʿ aql) was used to “purify the  idea of God from all anthropomorphism,” the aim being to “justify it against  the enticements of Greek thought and the attacks of the zanādiqa (free  thinkers)” (Gardet 1995, 592). Kalām, then, was a discourse that def ined  Islam (God, values) and Muslims. Hodgson offers a more expansive and  comparative perspective of kalām as a vision of religious experience. Kalām,  he says, rejected the vision of timelessness offered by Platonic philosophy at  the time, and offered a religiosity that embraced the historically signif icant  events of revelation (Hodgson 1974, 437-442). Martin, more radically, does  not see kalām as an alternative vision of religion, but a practice that stood  in place of one. Whereas Islam meant peace, the opposite (pathos) was war  and violence. The disputation of kalām, according to Martin, took its place  between Islam and pathos: “a powerful mode of discourse for constructing  and maintaining those sectarian and political boundaries that would ideally  have to be overcome for Muslims to realise their eschatological vision of  world order and peace” (Martin 1988, 111). Kalām for Martin, then, was  not itself a spiritual engagement, but an important means of overcoming  obstacles towards one. In the medieval world, schisms and sectarian divi- sions stood in the way of this vision. Some of the essays in Tim Winter,  ed., The Cambridge Companion to Classical Islamic Theology (2008) follow  a similar but more direct analysis. The history and success of kalām was  a long and necessary path to return Muslims to the essential message of  revelation (Mayer 2008; Michot 2008). Notwithstanding the f iner points  of detail, it is clear that kalām became a discursive tradition pursuing the  answer to two major questions: “Who is a Muslim?” and “What is Islam?” Coming from two very distinctive traditions, dialectical theologians and  Weberian scholars asked these overlapping questions. I present a map of  studies on modern Islam, as they documented and analysed the meaning  and role of Islam in modern societies. I identify their unique approaches  to modernity, and also their approach and understanding of culture and  religion. I show that they were progressively applying new ideas in the  </page> <page sequence="6"> 166 aBdulk ader TayoB  social sciences to identify Islam and Muslims. At each stage, I analyse this  identif ication from a kalām perspective. 2 Modern Islam: The Field of Study I divide the literature into three approaches in terms of their approach to  modernity. Firstly, earlier twentieth-century scholars worked with standard  modernisation theories where Enlightenment values and European social  and political formations were accepted as normative, and in turn confronted  and challenged traditional ideas and societies. In this f irst framework, Islam  as tradition was bound to disappear in the face of modernity (Lerner 1958).  Later historians like John Voll focused on the encounter between Islam and  the modern West. This second approach was open to the possibility of a  transformed tradition in the modern world, similar to what had happened  in the past between Islam and the Greek intellectual tradition, or Islam and  the Persian Empire. A third group challenged the Weberian conception of  modernity, proposing constructivist approaches to modernities in different  cultural contexts (Taylor 1993; Eisenstadt 2000; Salvatore 2009). In this third  group, we may speak of Islamic modernity or modernities. 2.1 Modernity Confronts Islam: The Impossibility of Islamic  Modernism Hamilton Gibb, W.C. Smith, Kenneth Cragg, and Gustave von Grunebaum  regarded Islam as a culture and civilisation that reached a high level of  maturity in the past, but was challenged and threatened by the values and  systems of Western modernity. In their work, modernisation was associated  with both Western culture and Western political and economic power.  Islam and Muslims were identif ied as traditional, the antithesis of modern,  and sometimes even non-modernisable. Some suggested that Muslims could  modernise if they adopted some features of modern Western culture. Others  were less hopeful, and advocated that Muslims ought to fundamentally  redefine Islam for a modern world. Ignaz Goldziher, William Montgomery Watt, and Kenneth Cragg were  among those aware of the attempts by contemporary Muslims to produce  new interpretations of Islam, and they give us a glimpse of the possibili- ties available. Goldziher’s book Introduction to Islamic Theology and Law  presents a strong argument for the ability of Islam’s adaptation to new  ideas and institutions. Taking a long historical view, he shows that Islamic  </page> <page sequence="7"> dIaleC TICal Theology In The SearCh for modern ISlam 167 theology systematically opposed new ideas but then incorporated them  in its expansive embrace through consensus (ijmāʿ). Historical examples  of these included the celebration of the birthday of the Prophet (mawlid),  dialectical theology, and the cults of saints. In modern times, he suggested,  the same process was at work. Muslims, for example, at f irst resisted  government bonds and printing presses, but then accepted them through  consensus (ijmāʿ). Goldziher does not forget to remind his readers, though,  that there was a strong and persistent tendency to resist change in Islam.  This tendency was symbolised most clearly by the Hanbali school of law and  its followers who regularly invoked a return to the example of the Prophet  (Goldziher 1981). Such a tendency committed Muslims to the past, and thus  posed an obstacle to their modernisation. Watt and Cragg accepted the main outline of Goldziher’s model, but  pointed to some new approaches developed by Muslims. While Goldziher  referred to the mechanism of consensus (ijmāʿ) that almost imperceptibly  accommodated Muslims to new developments, they pointed to attempts to  create indigenous Islamic modernisms. Watt admired Iqbal for his imagina- tive approach, but for which “the time was not ripe for further theological  speculation” (Watt 1962, 162). Cragg also reviewed a large number of Muslim  modernists grappling with modernity and modernisation – presenting  a synopsis of developments since the nineteenth century. In conclusion,  though, he suggested that Muslims might follow the example of Christianity  in responding to the philosophical challenge of modernity. As Christians  had adopted the cross as a key symbol, Muslims may similarly focus on the  compassionate God in the Qurʾan (Cragg 1967, 193). Von Grunebaum and Gibb were even less hopeful for an Islamic moder- nity than Goldziher, Watt, and Cragg. Von Grunebaum certainly recognised  Islam’s adaptation to new contexts, but argued that the ideal itself was a  problem. For Von Grunebaum, it was an immutable ideal that f ixed the  gaze of Muslims on the past (Von Grunebaum 1962, 209). Gibb presented  a history of Islam as a pendulum swing between transcendentalism and  immanentism. At times, Muslims focused on God as transcendent, and  they developed attitudes, values, and practices accordingly. At other times,  God as immanent produced tendencies towards inwardness and personal  orientations. In the modern period, transcendent Islam was dominant and,  according to Gibb, incompatible with the immanentist mood of modernity  (Gibb 1947, ch. 2). Gibb seemed to give Islam the benefit of the doubt, but  his general prognosis was sombre, and it emerged clearly in three essays  published in 1970 and 1971 on the “Heritage of Islam in the Modern World.”  In these essays, Gibb focused on the modern nation-state as the greatest  </page> <page sequence="8"> 168 aBdulk ader TayoB  challenge to Islam. The latter was held together, according to Gibb, by a  “sense of community and community values [that] always have been the  strongest motive force in the internal history of Islam.” This sense of com- munity, Watt went on, was “largely responsible for the remarkable degree  of success which it achieved ... as a socio-religious system” (Gibb 1970a, 4).  However, it was now challenged by the nation-state and nationalism, against  which it had no real response. All the achievements of the past were helpless  against the tide of nationalism (Gibb 1970a, b, 1971). These studies did not all explicitly follow Max Weber. They hardly ever  presented a detailed or general study of the ethics, economics, and values of  Muslims during this period. However, the studies were directly concerned  with Islam’s contribution to the development of modern societies. There was  some hope for modern Islam if Muslims maintained a judicious adaptation  of the legacy, against the example of the Prophet. Alternatively, they could  re-examine the sources to f ind something valuable, akin to the history of  modern Christianity (Cragg and Watt). The sub-text is a clear sense of the  diff iculty or impossibility of Islam’s experience in the modern world. These reflections and propositions of modern Islam take on an interesting  meaning from the perspective of kalām. Two aspects of the kalām question  “What is Islam?” are worth noting. Islam was located within a dominant  binary logic of the time. In this view, Islam was clearly part of tradition, as  opposed to the modernity of the West. Most of the scholars examined, in  fact, do not define modernity or tradition very explicitly. They work with the  presumption of an obvious modernity represented by Europe. Modernity  implied change, progressive development, and the status quo. Tradition  was its opposite, and it was associated with negative qualities. Islam was  clearly def ined as traditional. Whereas Muslims previously had answered  this question by presenting a list of duties or beliefs, or argued the rationality  of God’s essences and attributes, these studies place Islam in the world of  tradition. This binary opposition added a new dimension to the meaning of  Islam. Henceforth, questions pertaining to Islam were not limited to reason,  justif ication, and belief, but to its modern or tradition-like characteristics. One direct consequence of this reflection on the modernisation of Islam  was the splitting of Islam between its ideal and reality. From Goldziher to  Gibb, we were reminded that Islam could be separated between its ideal  and reality. Islam was more clearly identif ied with its ideal in the past, best  represented by the community of Muhammad. This perspective reflects the  approach of Muslim intellectuals in the nineteenth century who claimed  to go back to the pious ancestors (al-salaf ), reflecting a familiar historical  reference to the past (Moosa and Tareen 2012). They turned away from the  </page> <page sequence="9"> dIaleC TICal Theology In The SearCh for modern ISlam 169 existing “traditions” of Islam to the original model of Islam. In the perspec- tive of these studies, however, the future of a modernised Islam did not lie  with this ideal. Muslims would and should adopt contemporary traditions  and turn away from this ideal. Historical Islam’s redeeming feature had  been its tendency to adapt to local circumstances, away from this f ixed,  complete, and unchangeable ideal (Von Grunebaum). For Goldziher, also,  modernist Islam might be successful if it was not too faithful to the ideals of  the past. For modernist Islam, thus, the ideal past should be an anti-vision.  Unlike European modernity, which found its visions in Greece, Muslims  will modernise by adopting and adapting Western models. The origin of  Islam, unlike Athens, did not offer a recipe for modernisation. The literature on Islam and modernity divided Muslims into modernists  and traditionalists. Religious scholars are repeatedly identif ied as those  who most resist change, while modernisers receive the most attention as  they represent a promising future. In general, though, the binary division of  modernists and traditionalists replaces the sectarian divisions of Islam. In  the literature, they constitute a new sectarianism for Islam in the modern  world. 2.2 Islam Meets Modernity: Modern Islams Voll, Hoebink, and Lapidus offered a very different approach to Islam and  modernity (Voll 1982; Hoebink 1998; Lapidus 1997). They did not see a one- sided meeting of Islam and modernity, leading to an inevitable end. They  focused on a productive encounter, producing multiple responses. Draw- ing on the longer durée of Islamic history, they also compared the Islamic  encounter of modernity with early experiences. These earlier encounters  did not lead to the destruction of Islam, but were, in fact, productive and  fertile for dynamic change. Voll’s study, f irst published in 1982, presented a general overview of Islam  and its encounters. For Voll, there was a stable core around which Muslims  responded to modernity and similar challenges in the past. For Voll, “Islam  is not just religion, it is a total way of life” and “to be a Muslim is not simply a  matter of individual belief; it means participating in the effort to implement  God’s will on earth” (Voll 1982, 4, 8). It is this vision that faced modernity,  as it had faced earlier challenges. The f irst challenge, according to Voll, was  the death of the Prophet, who had to be replaced with someone to lead the  community. This was followed by the building of an empire, new cultural  and intellectual encounters with Hellenism, and challenging political and  social conditions (Voll 1982, 17-21). In each case, Muslims adapted and  </page> <page sequence="10"> 170 aBdulk ader TayoB  developed the original vision of Islam as a “way of life.” In the f irst, for  example, Muslims were preoccupied with identifying the kind of leaders  that should replace the Prophet. Out of this experience emerged new ideas  of charismatic succession (Shiʿite imams, Suf i teachers) and communal  boundaries and instruments (salaf, jamāʿa, ijmāʿ). Such developments grew  out of the original vision of Islam meeting new conditions. Voll’s framework  offers a constantly changing and developing vision of Islam as a “way of life.” The other significant aspect of Voll’s study is his identification of Muslims  in these encounters. He divided Muslims in terms of their response to these  encounters: “the pragmatic adapters, the conservatives, the fundamental- ists, and those who emphasize personal charisma” (Voll 1982, 12). Voll called  these “basic styles” and “forms of Islam.” Pragmatic adaptors were those  who were willing to reinterpret the original message, f inding elements  that had not been seen there before. On the other extreme, fundamental- ists resisted change and put up a defence for a primordial Islamic way of  life. Conservatives were in the majority, who adapted more slowly and  often imperceptibly. Those who emphasised personal charisma focused on  inspired and guided individuals who were regarded as the carriers of the  “way of life” in their persons. According to Voll, modernity was a complex set of changes and institu- tions that dominated the world over the last few centuries. It included  capitalism, the modern state, and general Western influences on a global  scale. Muslims were divided in their responses to these developments, and  they drew on the above-mentioned styles of action. Voll does not def ine  modern Islam any further than pointing to the diversity of responses. The  vision of “implementing the will of God” was kept alive, in different forms  by diverse groups. Michel Hoebink also adopted the framework of an encounter, but was  more specif ic on the cultural challenge of modernity posed to Islam and  Muslims. Working with the hermeneutical strategies of contemporary Arab  thinkers, he identif ied the face of modernity as secularisation according to  Western models, and the nature of the modern state. These were the key  issues that Arab thinkers were grappling with in their works. Emerging from  the Enlightenment, modernity was closely associated with secularism, the  modern state, and a generally a-religious or anti-religious view of life. The  hermeneutics of Islam was founded on diametrically opposed foundations,  and Arab thinkers were f inding a way to resolve or resist such changes.  Hoebink, however, did not regard Western modernity as unique and distinc- tive, and did not think that this was the f irst hermeneutical challenge  faced by Muslims. Modernisation, according to Hoebink, was “a cultural  </page> <page sequence="11"> dIaleC TICal Theology In The SearCh for modern ISlam 171 adaptation to social change – a process which occurs continuously and in  all cultures” (Hoebink 1998, 30). In this perspective, Muslims encountered  “modernisation” in the past. In response to such challenges, Muslims dif- fered among themselves on their willingness to interpret the essential  message of the Qurʾan: modernists adopted continuous interpretation;  fundamentalists opposed interpretation in principle; while conservatives  supported change to a limited extent. With contemporary modernity, a  similar process was under way. Muslims in the modern context were finding  appropriate responses to the challenges of secularism and the modern state. Both Voll and Hoebink offered an approach that did not lead to the  capitulation of Islam to modernisation. The encounter between Islam  and modernity was not as inevitable as it seemed to someone like Von  Grunebaum or Gibb. They did not assume the superiority of the modern  West, and certainly did not portray the dire consequences for a tradition  that failed to respond adequately to these challenges. Nevertheless, mo- dernity challenged the vision of Islam (Voll) or the meaning of its sacred  text (Hoebink). Muslims responded to these challenges as they had done in  the past. Modernity, in this framework, was domesticated to Islam’s longer  history. It was merely the latest of the challenges that f irst began with the  death of the Prophet Muhammad. The resources of history were employed  to respond to modernity. Voll and Hoebink stress different aspects of modernity, elucidating differ- ent aspects of modern Islam. Focusing on general historical changes brought  along by capitalism and globalisation, Voll focuses on how the community  (umma) met these challenges. Unlike Gibb, who saw only the threat of  nationalism to the umma, Voll stressed that Muslims were producing new  ways of thinking of the original vision (“implementing the will of God  on earth”). Hoebink focused on the threat of secularisation to Islam, and  similarly showed how Muslims responded with hermeneutical inventions.  Modern Islam, according to Hoebink, was an intense grappling with the  production of or resistance to a new hermeneutic. Voll and Hoebink offered new answers to the kalām question “What is Is- lam?” Islam was a unified symbol, more clearly specified. For Voll, Islam was  a community seeking to implement the Will of God on earth. For Hoebink,  Islam represented a hermeneutical engagement with revelation. This speci- f icity relating to “a vision” or “a hermeneutic” replaced a general reference to  Islam in the work of their predecessors as a grand civilisation or a religion.  From both Voll and Hoebink, however, the vision and the hermeneutic were  in a state of continuous change, periodically adapting and modernising  themselves. In fact, Muslims were by def inition re-inventing the vision  </page> <page sequence="12"> 172 aBdulk ader TayoB  and hermeneutic in history. Islam re-invented itself as a new hermeneutic  (Hoebink) or a new vision of implementing the will of God (Voll). “What is  Islam?” gained more specif icity, but it was by definition changing. The frameworks proposed by Voll and Hoebink also offered new answers  to the question “Who is a Muslim?” Voll and Hoebink split the dichotomous  modernist-traditionalist binary pair, and pointed to multiple responses of  Muslims. In response to change, Muslims were conservatives, traditional- ists, adaptationists and focused on personal models. Voll and Hoebink  suggested new foundations for modern Muslim identities. Moreover, all  such responses were modern by definition. Adaptationists, conservatives,  and fundamentalists were constituted in their encounter with modernity.  They were all modern, even if their responses appeared to be tradition-like.  A Muslim was still identif ied through the encounter, but her identity had  been fully absorbed into modernity. 2.3 Constructing Islamic Modernities More recent reflections have developed Voll and Hoebink’s approaches.  Drawing on a postcolonial mood that emphasised multiple and constructed  modernities, they have asked how Muslims produced modernity or moder- nities. They have taken one further step from modernity as def ined and  normalised by the West, whilst still engaged with it. Richard Martin and  Armando Salvatore provide two contrasting approaches to this engagement.  Martin worked with the implications of modern hermeneutics on the study  of Islam. Salvatore turned to the “Axial Age” of Jaspers, predating both Islam  and the modern West, to focus on how Muslims created discourses. If Voll  and Hoebink’s work can be seen as turning around Muslim responses to  challenges, Martin and Salvatore worked with Muslim engagements. The  difference between the two lies in the elevation of Muslims as agents, and  the disappearance of the West as principal actor. Richard Martin has promoted the study of Islam within the compara- tive study of religions. In two key essays, he put forwards a proposal for  the study of Islam in modern contexts that elucidates his model (Martin  1982, 1984). He built his proposal on the work of the anthropologist Clifford  Geertz who def ined religion as a system of symbols that negotiated the  gap that inevitably arose between a world view and ethos. World view was  a society and community’s conceptual map that was passed down over  time, and ethos represented the particular historical conditions in which  world view was actualised. Symbols in general, and religious symbols in  particular, created a semblance of reality through synthesising “a people’s  </page> <page sequence="13"> dIaleC TICal Theology In The SearCh for modern ISlam 173 ethos ... and their world view” (Geertz 1966, 3). Martin suggested that this  symbolic system from anthropology could be applied to the comparative  study of religions. Geertz himself was not overly concerned with the history  of the Islamic cultural system in general. He was more focused on the  difference between cultural systems in Morocco and Indonesia. For Martin,  the historical legacy of Islam could not be ignored in the study of Islam in  context. The historical legacy of texts, theologies, and rituals was inherited  through a variety of formal and informal ways, and it impacted upon local  contexts. In the Geertzian model, the world view of Muslims was the sum  total of Islam inherited over time. This was the ideal, the moral vision and  the tool of interpretation that were identif ied respectively by Goldziher,  Voll, and Hoebink, among others. Martin asked scholars of Islam to pay  attention to how this world view was used, appropriated, and translated  in modern local contexts. Martin went one step further, and reminded his readers that Husserl and  Heidegger offered two ways of reading the legacy of Islam. With Husserl,  scholars of Islam retrieved the legacy as a model and world view with suf- f icient bracketing and empathy. Geertz followed this line of interpretation.  However, with Heidegger, scholars might also reproduce the legacy in every  new reading. Whether one preferred Husserl or Heidegger, the inherited  world view was read and re-read in modern contexts. Martin asked that  scholars of Islam take into consideration these hermeneutical strategies of  reading an inherited world view. Working with the example of the Qurʾan,  he argued that the ritual could be read as an attempt to connect Qurʾan  recitation to its performance, exegesis, and meaning to the past, the present,  and the future. This history impacted upon a particular reading in a new  context – negotiating between the past and the present. In this case, Martin  also suggested that reading the Qurʾan in new contexts was a re-enactment  of the Qurʾan recited f irst by the Prophet Muhammad in the presence  of Gabriel (Martin 1982, 384). Martin was offering a phenomenological  perspective of a modern recitation of the Qurʾan, one that mirrored the  f irst recitation between Muhammad and Gabriel. Modern Islam, then,  would be a re-construction of primordial experiences of Prophetic times.  Martin was asking scholars of Islam to recognise this phenomenology. It  seems that Martin was not specif ically asking academic colleagues to pay  attention to how modern Muslims were reading this inherited world view  from texts and practices as hermeneutical exercises. He was focused on the  theoretical models available to academic scholarship. Martin did not particularly focus on the uniqueness of modernity. He  assumed a radical alterity of each experience, however, and his application  </page> <page sequence="14"> 174 aBdulk ader TayoB  of Geertz’s model suggests a construction of an Islamic experience in the  modern world. Following different approaches and different f ields, other  scholars have traced the production of modern Islam in similar ways. Aziz  al-Azmeh’s widely read book, Islams and Modernities, identif ies Muslim  responses to modernity as a form of Romanticism (Al-Azmeh 1993, ch. 2).  Examining Islamist criticism of the West, Euben argues that they were  producing critiques of modernity that should be compared with similar  Western critiques (Euben 1997). Working with political formations, Schulze  recognised familiar political ideologies in Arab societies since the nine- teenth century, pointing to the modernity of these formations (Schulze  2000). Salvatore has taken a very different approach to Islamic modernity, one  that shies away from the phenomenological direction of Martin’s work, and  also the critical readings of others that I have mentioned above. Working  with a structural approach to modernity, he has followed two distinctive  but related paths. In the f irst, he worked with the ideas of Max Weber and  pushed the limits of his theoretical application to the history of Islam. In  the second, he has worked with Dale Eickelman on the idea of the public  sphere. Both converge around the discursive construction of alternative  Islamic modernities. With regard to the first, Salvatore joined other scholars  of Islam who proposed an updated Weberian approach, one that expunged  the latter’s limited or prejudicial understanding of Islam. According to  Salvatore, Weber offered a dynamic approach to culture and religion, within  which the history of modern Islam may be reconstructed. Salvatore engages  in a rich theoretical engagement with Weber, showing how an Islamic  modernity may be imagined. He begins, however, with Jasper’s theory of  the “Axial Age” that began 5,000 years earlier. The key transformative ideas  of the “Axial Age” were the absolute separation between the human and  divine, and the pursuit of happiness (salvation) in an otherworldly imagined  realm. Salvatore argued for an Islamic engagement with these foundational  ideas, producing two distinctive features for society. In theology, philoso- phy, and mysticism, he suggested, the individual believer and his or her  engagement with salvation was placed above everything else. Moreover,  the Islamic legacy was marked by diversity and the pursuit of consensus  through discourse. Salvatore focuses on the history of Islam as a continuing  contribution to deep cultural changes inaugurated before Muhammad  (Salvatore 2009). He appeals to scholars to recognise Islam’s engagement  with these ideas. He sees modern Islam, in turn, as a continuing engagement  with the “Axial” ideas within new contexts and new possibilities. Muslims  were producing a unique modernity with these ideas, as Europe too had  </page> <page sequence="15"> dIaleC TICal Theology In The SearCh for modern ISlam 175 done. Both were continuing engagements with key ideas inaugurated in  the “Axial Age.” With specif ic respect to the modern period, Salvatore worked closely  with Dale Eickelman to apply the theory of Jürgen Habermas for Islam in  the public sphere. They brought a number of scholars together to reflect  and write on what they call “public Islam” and “Muslim publics.” Public  Islam referred to highly diverse invocations of Islam as ideas and practices that religious  scholars, self-ascribed religious authorities, secular intellectuals, Suf i  orders, mothers, students, workers, engineers, and many others make  to civic debate and public life. In this “public” capacity, “Islam” makes a  difference in configuring the politics and social life of large parts of the  globe, and not just for self-ascribed religious authorities. (Salvatore and  Eickelman 2004b, xii) “Public Islam” referred to articulations on Islam within public spaces.  These voices and gestures produced new possibilities of both agreement  and disagreement, but most importantly contributed to the production  and maintenance of discursive worlds (Salvatore and Eickelman 2004a,  16). The net effect of “public Islam” was the production of “Muslim publics,”  which by def inition were discursive spaces within cities, regions, nations,  and the global cyber-world. In any one place and time, multiple publics  were deliberating on notions of the common good on various issues. Two  features stand out in the production, as reflected in the work of Salvatore,  Eickelman, and their collaborators. The role of new media was crucial,  beginning with print and continuing in the era of virtual worlds. Modern  media made religious texts more widely available, provided access to  present one’s views, and increased the possibility of sharing such ideas  with others across space. Secondly, non-specialists joined in the production  of “public Islam” and the constitution of “Muslim publics.” Participation  in “public Islam” was not limited to those who studied Islamic sciences  over many years. Anyone with access to media could and did participate  in the production. Participation in “Muslim publics” was not even limited  to Muslims. In an early book, Salvatore had suggested how an open and  cumulative discursive engagement between Arab and European observers  and social scientists had produced “political Islam” for the public sphere  (Salvatore 1997). Salvatore was suggesting that modern technology pro- vided another step in the path of Islam’s engagement with “Axial” values.  Its earlier focus on the individual believer was further consolidated by  </page> <page sequence="16"> 176 aBdulk ader TayoB  technology’s ability to extend access to each and every participant in the  discourse. Taking the two lines of argument together, we can see Salvatore drawing  on the theory of the “Axial Age” to locate the intellectual history of Islam. He  then employed the idea of the public sphere to indicate how modern Islam  was being produced as publics. New political structures and technologi- cal innovations were presenting opportunities for the elaboration of this  longue durée of Islamic engagement. Modern Islam was thus presented as  an alternative modernity, the modernisation of Europe being one particular  instance of this engagement. In different ways, Martin and Salvatore approached modern Islam as a  language game in the Wittgensteinian sense of the term. Martin developed  Geertz’s approach for a religious tradition with a long history, with a focus  on the role of symbols. His model suggested that Muslims worked with  symbols, and modern experiences should be appreciated for this symbolic  work. Similarly, Salvatore proposed that Islam was a discursive tradition  that engaged with “Axial” values, and was now re-imagining those values  in an age with different experiences and technological possibilities. For  both Martin and Salvatore, one aspect of the question “What is Islam?” was  answered: Islam is a language. It is a specif ic application of the proposal by  Talal Asad to regard Islam as a discursive system. Asad had been critical of  Geertz and others who regarded Islam as a closed and distinctive cultural  system, and argued for a discourse that managed and produced selves,  communities, and values (Asad 1986). With Islam as language and discourse,  Martin and Salvatore put Muslims at the centre of modern Islam. Muslims  read and wrote Islam. While the meaning of Islam was clearly identif ied as language, it lost  any specif ic substance, however. By definition, Islam was what its language  participants made it to be. Martin reminded us about the complexities of  reading a language and texts that others have produced. The hermeneutical  reflections of Husserl and Heidegger made it hazardous to guess what Islam  was at any one particular time. In the essays studied, Martin’s approach  focused on the re-enactment of the Prophetic period that gave modern Islam  a focus. He was following a Husserlian approach to the phenomenology of  recitation. However, his general model did not prevent a scholar of Islam  from taking a Heideggerian approach to reading the legacy of Islam. Modern  Islam potentially becomes a hermeneutical exercise that does not simply  repeat the approaches of the past (as Hoebink seems to suggest). Salvatore’s  discursive approach was equally centrifugal around core “Axial” values. The  public sphere prepared opportunities for multiple values and discourses that  </page> <page sequence="17"> dIaleC TICal Theology In The SearCh for modern ISlam 177 were not bound and limited to the legacy of Islam. No longer controlled by  religious leaders or even by Muslims, the discourse of Islam was thrown  wide open. In both Martin and Salvatore, “What is Islam?” lost its centre  in Islam, as it revolved around the meaning of Islam that each participant  brought to the language and discourse at play. No special group of Muslims or even believers were privileged in these  models of engaging in the language of modern Islam. The question “Who is  a Muslim?” was not directly connected with modernity or modernisation.  Yet, each participant was engaged personally and directly in constructing  a modern religious experience. The modernists, the traditionalists, and  the groups in between have been dropped in the models. Both Martin and  Salvatore want to pay attention to the engaged participant. The public  sphere dimension of “public Islam” and “Muslim publics” does not even limit  the engagement to Muslims. “Who is a Muslim?” has lost any specif icity  apart from a presumed interest or experience. 3 Discussion and Conclusion Studies on modern Islam have offered fascinating insights into what has  become of Islam in the modern world. I have tracked their journey that  began with a search for an Islamic modernism, to the pursuit of personal  engagements in discourse. At each stage, new perspectives were offered  on questions that were f irst formulated by Max Weber about the history  of religious traditions. The binary opposition of modernity and tradition  was used by earlier twentieth-century scholars, but then progressively  replaced with more sophisticated and nuanced approaches to change and  modernisation. Similarly, earlier Western assumptions of modernity were  moved from the centre to the periphery, and Islam and Western modernity  were placed in a rubric that went beyond them both. The literature, from  one perspective, may be seen as a progressive grappling with modernity  and its meaning in relation to Islam. And this chapter has shown how more  nuanced models of modernity were used implicitly and explicitly to define  and identify Islam in the modern world. My main purpose, however, has been to put these Weberian reflections  under the framework of kalām questions. From the perspective of kalām,  what was the search for modern Islam telling us about the identity of Muslims  (“Who is a Muslim?”) and the meaning of Islam (“What is Islam?”)? I propose  that two main preoccupations are present in the literature. The f irst was  a form of justif ication that behoves any good theological discourse. While  </page> <page sequence="18"> 178 aBdulk ader TayoB  earlier kalām was concerned with justifying revelation against reason, the  study of modern Islam could not escape justif ication against modernity.  Secondly, the study of modern Islam has been a search for representation  that has become progressively more diff icult. The representation of Islam  suffered the fate of all representations in the social sciences and humani- ties in the twentieth century. For Islam in the modern world, the story of  representation has been a progressive and perpetual postponement of being  Muslim, and of Islam itself. The justif icatory preoccupation of the literature of modern Islam is most  clearly evident among the f irst group of scholars mentioned above. From  Goldziher to Gibb, modern Islam was justif ied against the successes and  achievements of modern, Western Europe. As in the past, when Muslims  found a rational basis for belief, scholars of modern Islam were examining  the possibility of an Islamic theology or interpretation of modernity that  would be similar or compatible with modern Europe. Most invariably found  that Muslims, even modernist Muslims, failed in this endeavour. There were,  however, some who believed that a truly modernist Islam was available and  within reach. As Muslims had produced arguments for the rational basis of  Islamic beliefs and values in the past, a similar exercise might be possible  for Islam in the modern world. This explicit justification of modern Islam was avoided by those who used  different models of modernity and of religion/culture. Voll and Hoebink  took the f irst step to relativise Western modernity. From the perspective  of Muslim responses, they referred to other “modernities” in the past that  had prepared Muslims for the present. Salvatore took a bigger step, as he  proposed an alternative Weberian model for Islam and Europe that reached  into the “Axial Age.” These attempts to move beyond the shadow of the West  reflected a change in world politics, and also a change in social sciences and  the humanities. Europe and the West were no longer the models against  which developments were measured in the rest of the world. And these  studies in modern Islam were clearly successful in their endeavour to show  this new mood. However, Western experience was not completely displaced.  Voll and Hoebink avoided an obvious comparison between the West and  modern Islam, but Western experience and history loomed large against  which Muslims responded. Salvatore, too, did not go beyond the impact of  the West as a parallel model that preceded the history of modern Islam.  Modern Muslims as such were responding to major changes and challenges  emanating from the West. There is more than a hint of justif ication that  continued to pervade the discourse. Modern Islam, as pursued in the litera- ture, was by definition tied to the coat-tails of a Western experience. Just as  </page> <page sequence="19"> dIaleC TICal Theology In The SearCh for modern ISlam 179 reason could not be shrugged off in kalām in the past, the West cannot be  ignored or avoided in the definition of modern Islam and modern Muslims. If the search for justif ication was clearly uneasy, another preoccupation  was more widely shared. The search for modern Islam was a quest or desire  to f ind the most adequate representation of Islam in the modern world. This  was the self-evident task of scholars of Islam such as historians, philologists,  and social scientists. From a kalām perspective, however, this preoccupation  takes on some revealing dimensions. The quest began with great clarity,  but concluded with an almost total obliteration of Islam and Muslims. The  answers to “What is Islam?” and “Who are Muslims?” became progressively  impossible. For those working with modernity as a normative model of the West,  Islam was represented as tradition. In this perspective, Muslims were  classif ied according to their willingness and readiness to modernise. For  those who placed an emphasis on Muslims responding to the challenges  of modernity, however, the definition of Islam became opaque. Islam was  a perpetual adaptation to successive challenges that had f irst emerged  with the death of the Prophet Muhammad. Modernity was only the latest  challenge to which Muslims were responding, adapting, and resisting.  They adopted different styles of action (Voll) or hermeneutical strategies  (Hoebink). The third group of scholars, applying a constructive perspective  to modernity, also contributed to this opaqueness. As language, text, and  discourse, Islam lost any specif ic meaning with regard to belief, ritual,  or value. Islam had been emptied of all contents. What started as a clear  definition of Islam in the binary logic of modernity and tradition ended with  elimination of any recognisable feature, ritual, or practice. Focus shifted  from the “thingness” of Islam, to responses and engagements. Similarly, the representations of Muslim identities (“Who is a Muslim?”)  ended the same way. Goldziher and others replaced the earlier sectarian  divisions among Muslims, and between Muslims and other religious groups,  with identities determined by Western modernity. In this perspective, mod- ernists and traditionalists replaced Sunnis, Shiʿis, Alawis, apostates, and  heretics. Voll and Hoebink broke the stranglehold of the binary logic, and  focused on multiple responses to modernity. Where Muslims were previ- ously divided between modernists and traditionalists, they were henceforth  respondents, and all modernists. They were perpetually modern and always  responding to challenges. The Muslim had lost his and her centre of identity.  Salvatore turned to the “Axial Age” to search for an Islamic engagement  that ran parallel to the West’s engagement with the same tradition. Such  a parallel modernity def ined a particular Muslim and Islamic engagement  </page> <page sequence="20"> 180 aBdulk ader TayoB  in public spheres. Modern technology made it possible for an increasing  number of individuals to participate in these discourses (Salvatore). The  Muslim public became invocations of Islam. The Muslim was emptied of  fundamental notions of modernity, but also of any tangible belief and of  action. Identity moved from the person to the “invocations of Islam” in  the public sphere. In Salvatore’s model, the Muslim also disappeared. Like  Islam, the meaning of being a Muslim also lost any tangible reference.  Muslims were defined by their engaging and reading discourses and texts  respectively. The centre had fallen through. Together with justif ication, then, representation occupied a central role  in the quest to identify modern Islam. Islam and Muslims had been placed  in the twilight shadow of Western modernity. The shadow was lifted, but  enough to mark an outline. More critically, as the quest for representation  had come under the challenge of Foucault in general, and Edward Said on  the study of Islam in particular (Foucault 1980; Said 1995), representation  became impossible. The meaning of Islam and Muslims became responses  and engagements around activities and beliefs. From the perspective of  kalām, such “representations” emptied Islam and Muslims of any clear  and tangible centre. There was no belief, or ritual, or narrative that held  Islam or Muslims together. The meaning of Islam, and of being Muslim,  dissolved from any specif ic belief, act, or value. All was language, deferred  progressively and perpetually. The meaning of modern Islam and Muslims  were subject to the fate of all postmodernist def initions of terms. Bibliography Al-Azmeh, Aziz. 1993. Islams and Modernities. London: Verso.
