ROBINSON, Editor Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore EGYPT New Discoveries at Tell el-Amarna.-J. D. S. PENDLEBURY in the Illustrated London News, May 6, 1933, pp. 629-633, reports most interesting dis- coveries of the past season, the chief object of which was the clearance of the temple to the Sun. Work upon the sanctuary remains still to be done, but the complex of buildings adjoining is now cleared. The enclosure is seen to be a rectangle 800 yards long by 300 wide. A ramp led up to an entrance in the middle of the west wall. At the left was a pavilion with rows of columns on cement foundations. The path was flanked by sunken plaster receptacles for liquid offerings. Ahead lay the House of Rejoicing, comprising two pavilions, at the east end of each of which steps led into small open courts. The next division of the temple, the Finding of Aten, consisted of open 1 The department of Archaeological News and Discussions and of Bibliography of Archaeological Books is conducted by Professor DAVID M.

The last court, surrounded by chapels, contained the high altar. Outside the building but within the temenos wall stood innumerable square brick piers, either for the offerings of those who could not afford tables within, or else, as Dr. Frankfort has suggested, the tables of every town and city in the empire. After Akhenaten died, his enemies razed the place and filled it with sand, covering the whole with a layer of cement. A few pieces of decoration have survived, notably sculptors' trial-pieces for portraits of Nefertiti, Akhenaten and Smenkhara. By chance, in the south part of the town, a group of artists' houses was discovered and in them were some extraordinarily fine pieces, a steatite group of the Ape of Thoth and a scribe, an inlay relief portrait of Akhenaten, a quartzite head per- haps representing Nefertiti, and several other portrait heads. New Discoveries at Hermopolis.-West of the ancient city of Hermopolis Dr. SAMY GABR of the Egyptian University is reported to have unearthed whole streets lined with buildings dating from the first century B.C. to the second A.D. These in- clude a Greek temple with a nearly intact stone altar in front of it, a Greco-Egyptian temple, tombs and two-storeyed houses decorated with fairly well-preserved wall-paintings. Early lat- tice windows, stone-carvings, coins and inscrip- tions are among the small finds. Illustrated London News, March 4, 1933, pp. 310-311. Excavations at Ballana.-During the past sea- son this site, about seven miles south of Abu Simbel, has yielded additional discoveries to the Egyptian Government Archaeological Survey of Nubia under the direction of Mr. W. B. Emery. Fewer traces of purely Egyptian worship were in evidence, and there was much more indication of the infiltration of Christianity than had been 313</page><page sequence="2">314 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY formerly observed. The identification of the people awaits further investigation, but it is sup- posed that they were a Nubian tribe flourishing here from the fourth to the sixth centuries A.D. Epigraphical traces are rare. A tomb disclosed the body of a man lying in a contracted position and bearing, still in place, a silver crown studded with jewels and decorated with busts of the god- dess Isis, bracelets, anklets and earrings. Among the miscellaneous finds are bronze bowls and lamps of somewhat crude but interesting design. Illustrated London News, Feb. 25, 1933, pp. 264-5. ORIENTAL ASSYRIA AND BABYLONIA Discoveries at Tell Halaf.-The Illustrated London News, April 22, 1933, pp. 562-3, repro- duces photographs of some of the more interesting sculptures found by BARON VON OPPENHEIM at this site. Among these are two colossal basalt statues of a male and female divinity, fitted at the base for insertion into the back of a lion and lion- ess, and reliefs representing hunting scenes. These show the prey under or above the horse. Other reliefs show a spotted panther squatting on his hind-quarters, a lion, a demi-god with four wings, a goddess with six, and a warrior armed with a boomerang. An interesting socle carved with five male sphinxes is also reproduced. A further article in the issue for April 929, 1933, sum- marizes the historical significance of the site. Tell Halaf is thought to be the home of the broad- nosed "Hither Asiatics" or Subaraeans, whose culture is represented by the lowest layer, the "Painted Pottery" Period, beginning in 4000 B.C. The Hittite invaders of 2000 B.C. perhaps de- stroyed Tell Halaf, but in any case did not re- build, but settled on the site of the present Fekheria. In the twelfth century the Aramaeans under their king Kapara rebuilt Tell Halaf. To him is due the hilani, a building with an open space before a great hall entered through a large gateway, of which remains were found. About 1100 nB.c. Tiglath-pileser destroyed the city and rebuilt it. The Assyrian dominion lasted about 500 years, until the city became part of Cyrus' kingdom. In late Roman times there was a considerable settlement here. In the seventh century it was overrun by the Arabs, and again in the thirteenth by the Tartars, since which time it has remained a wilderness. Archaeology of the Ancient East.-In Archaeo- logische Mitteilungen aus Iran, vol. V, 1, ERNST HERZFELD begins a series of essays dealing with the archaeology of the Ancient East. The pres- ent contribution contains the introductory discus- sion on the subject of "History and Prehistory" (pp. 1-48). The author's views are frequently at variance with those that are generally held; his theories are often premised on the inner logic of the arguments rather than upon exhaustive docu- mentation. The study is largely polemical and the author makes a point of "arguing only against those views that actually deserve it." According to Herzfeld, the period of the Royal Tombs of Ur must not be placed earlier than the First Dynasty of Ur, as Woolley has suggested, but rather later, between the reigns of Eannatum of Lagash and of Sargon of Agade. The oldest historical period of Sumer is represented by the inscriptions of Mesilim of Kish, which antedate considerably the epigraphic material relating to Mesannipadda, the founder of the First Dynasty of Ur. Gudea of Lagash could not have ruled during the period of the Guti domination; his reign must have preceded the invasion of the mountaineers. The origin of the civilizations of Egypt, Lower Mesopotamia, and of the Hittite-Caspian region must have been roughly contemporary. Inci- dentally, the antiquity of the so-called "Hittite" hieroglyphs is much greater than scholars are willing to admit. There need be no doubt that the prototypes of the cuneiform writing were in- vented by the Sumerians. In fact, it is difficult to disprove the assumption that no other cul- tural element preceded the Sumerians in Mesopo- tamia. Their chief rivals were the Semites, who eventually cut the Sumerians off from their north- ern relatives. The significance of other ethnic elements is subject to doubt. As proof for his assertion concerning the priority of the Sumerians in the land, Herzfeld reminds the reader that the most important place-names, including the desig- nations for the Tigris and the Euphrates, are Sumerian. The discussion is concluded with the presentation of a table of prehistoric periods in Babylonia and the neighboring regions; the his- toric age is said to begin about 3100 B.c. lonians at Susa.-The part taken by Ionians in the construction of the palace of Darius I at Susa, as revealed in the trilingual inscription first published in 1929, is discussed by SCHAEDER (Arch. Anz. 1932, 9269-74). Once they are men-</page><page sequence="3">ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS AND DISCUSSIONS, 1933 315 tioned as workmen, perhaps masons. Again they helped transport cedar from Babylon to Susa; these would be the transferred Milesians. "Or- nament for walls" or "relief-ornament" was brought from Ionia. W. ZSCHIETZSCHMANN (ibid.) suggests that this might be terracottas. SYRIA AND PALESTINE Recent Excavations at Ras Shamra.-During the fourth season of work in 1932 new discoveries of the greatest interest were made. Excavation was begun in the necropolis on a rock command- ing the ancient port, the shore-line of which was 120 metres behind the modern one. The oldest tombs are simple trenches cut in the chalk, de- signed to hold but one body and its equipment, but occasionally the same grave was used for more than one burial; in this case, the other previously interred bodies were simply pushed aside. The pottery, of Cypriote or local origin, is dated in the fifteenth century. Mycenaean pottery is absent, though found in abundance in the two chamber- tombs discovered, both of which had unfortu- nately been pillaged. One of them had a window, outside which had been placed a large jar and several cups, an arrangement of offerings paral- leled by the tombs already discovered. The other tomb, larger and more impressive, contained 28 skeletons and a mass of perishable objects, most of which were broken. Of these, among the most interesting are tall goblets decorated with polychrome female heads. Between the tombs was a sacred enclosure for a fertility cult, the ritual of which is known through one of the Ras Shamra tablets: over vases buried in the earth, two liquids were to be poured. On the acropolis of Ras Shamra itself were discovered three super- imposed towns. Nearby were found chamber- tombs containing Mycenaean pottery with still more ancient burials at a lower level. Two in- teresting tablets have been deciphered, one a religious text, the other a warrant of arrest. South of the library was found a Mycenaean tomb; its location testifies to the invasions of Greek conquerors. Sculptural finds include two silver statuettes with gold necklaces and loin- cloths, both of the rude style of the thirteenth- twelfth centuries; a splendid relief of Baal bearing a club and stylized thunderbolt; statues of human beings and lions at the great temple, and a fine sphinx of greenstone with an inscription on the chest stating that it was the gift of Amenemhat III (about 1849-1801) to the temple of Ras Shamra.

Excavations in Palestine and Syria.-It is believed that the stables of Solomon for the royal cavalry at Megiddo have been discovered. The cartouche of Sheshonq I (c. 945-924), the biblical Shishak, has been found and proves the march of the king against Jerusalem (I Kings 14, 25-26). Palestine Exploration Fund, April, 1933. Nineveh.-The British Museum excavations at the temple of Ishtar, 1930-31, are published in Liverpool Annals, xix, 3-4, 193R, pp. 55-116, pls. XLVI-XCII, by R. C. THOMPSON and R. W. HAMILTON. Little was learned of the temple it- self, but a substructure of sun-dried brick, ca. 300 by 150 feet, was proved by inscriptions to belong to it, and its history can be traced by the aid of the inscriptions. The first known builder was Manishtushu, ca. 92450 B.C.; the second, Shamshi- Adad I, ca. 1840 B.C.; and there is evidence of six other reconstructions, the last by Ashur-bani-pal. The substructure is assigned, though not cer- tainly, to Ashur-rish-ishi, ca. 1120 B.C. It is about 6 feet thick, but a central part is 19 feet thick. In it are several "cellars." Five vaulted tombs of sun-dried brick were also found; floor to keystone, 9 feet; the five tombs occupied an area of 60 by 50 feet. These apparently belong to the fourth millennium. The pottery falls into two groups: one Romano-Parthian; the second group, an interesting painted or incised ware, already known from various sites in northern Mesopo- tamia and assigned to the third millennium de- spite some indications of a much later date. Among the numerous inscriptions found on the site is a long one of Ashur-nazir-pal and one of Shamshi-Adad I which helps to establish him as the first important Assyrian ruler. A notable dis- covery is a life-size bronze head, perhaps a part of Ashur-bani-pal's booty. In some points it re- sembles the gold "helmet " of Mes-kalam-shar and may be contemporary with it (ca. 3000 B.c.). Prehistoric Finds near Bethlehem.-In a cave seven miles east of Bethlehem there were found on the rock-wall carvings dating from the Natufian period (c. 12,000 B.C.); the pictures represent the elephant, wild pig, rhinoceros, and gazelle; the objects included scythe-heads and fishing and agricultural implements. In the same cave remains were found of a flint industry dating from the Clactonian period (dated variously from 100,000 to 200,000 years B.C.) Palestine Exploration Fund, April, 1933.</page><page sequence="4">316 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY Jericho.-JoHN GARSTANG publishes (Liver- pool Annals, xix, 3-4, 19392, pp. 35-54, pls. XXVI-XLV) a second instalment of his report on the excavations at Jericho (cf. A.J.A. xxxv, 1931, pp. 98 ff.). It is devoted chiefly to graves. One tomb belongs to the Early Bronze Age. The description of Tomb A, Middle Bronze Age I, is completed; it received some 500 interments, 2000- 1800 B.C. When each new burial was added, the old burials and offerings were swept aside. A score of M.B.A. II (1700-1500) tombs was found, the earlier of grotto type, the later, shallow graves. Three of the earlier sort are described in some de- tail. Tomb 9 contained a unique head-vase and nine scarabs of Hyksos and early XVIIIth dynasty types. Tomb 192, containing five Hyksos scarabs, was used during a short period, ca. 1650-1600. Tomb 22, with nine Hyksos scarabs, is contem- porary with and later than 12. All the graves yielded pottery, including more than 1000 vases in good condition. The investigations thus far made indicate a marked break in ceramic develop- ment between M.B.A. I and M.B.A. II; before it no Egyptian connections are perceptible. From 1400 to 19200 the site was relatively deserted. Greek Coins at Beth-zur.-Greek coins of the fifth and fourth centuries B.c. found at Beth-zur testify to Greek influence in Palestine two centuries before Alexander the Great. Palestine Exploration Fund, January, 1933. Another leaden coffin from Palestine.-A cof- fin of lead, since 19092 in the Museum of Archaeology in Leyden and said to have been found near Tyre, is to be classed with the three in Jerusalem which were published and discussed in J.H.S. for 1930 (see A.J.A. 1931, p. 3926, where B.C. is a mistake for A.D.). The bottom and the lower edges of the Leyden example are missing, but the arched cover, clamped to the long sides, and the greater part of the four sides are pre- served. Like the oldest of the Jerusalem coffins, this one has the long sides divided into panels by columns spirally fluted in the upper two-thirds of their height, the spaces being filled with reliefs of sphinxes, winged gorgon-heads in medallions, fluted canthari, dolphins, and groups of three lanceolate leaves. Similar groups of leaves laid horizontally between rope mouldings form a bor- der above the panels and along both edges of the cover, while along the top of the cover is a decora- tion of vines, medallions and rosettes. One end of the chest represents the facade of a temple or tomb, with four spiral columns, fruit-laden vines in the side openings, a Syrian archivolt over the middle one, and canthari as acroteria. This archivolt architecture was used in Syria and Asia Minor in the second century A.D. and later adopted in the West, where it is best known from the palace of Diocletian at Spalato. The other end shows a sort of wheel made of six rope-like spokes ending in double, six-leaved rosettes, with similar rosettes in the angles. The plates cast in moulds from which these coffins were made, evi- dently, from their identical technique and limited range of motives, come from a single factory, prob- ably Roman, which operated in Syria for several centuries and served Pagans, Jews and Christians alike.

PERSIA Islamic Architecture in Persia.-In February there was exhibited in London a series of photo- graphs of Islamic monuments in Persia made by Mr. ARTHUR UPHAM POPE. Some of the most interesting of these present the Tari(kh) Khaneh, Damghan, the earliest mosque in Islam, of the seventh or early eighth century, showing columns of purely Sassanian construction; the Masjid-i- Jami, Isfahan, about 1080, of Seljuk construction with affinities to later Gothic building in Europe; the Masjid-i-Jameh, Ardistan, of the eleventh- twelfth centuries, with the transverse arch form- ing a bridge between piers, which, like other fea- tures of brick building, appears in India in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, and the superb Seljuk brick minaret at Saveh, dated in 1110.

Anz. 1932, pp. 208-230; 33 ills.), on the results of the excavations of 1931 and previous years. The last campaign was devoted chiefly to an area 50 by 60 metres in the south- eastern part of the site. The earliest settlement was neolithic, the hill probably surrounded by a swamp; ware coarse gray, with incised decoration. In the following Copper Period (Period I of earlier reports) the hill and terrace were thickly settled and fortified. The Early Bronze Period (Period III) is closely connected with the preceding by pottery, though it is now somewhat elaborately painted instead of merely polished, and by burial customs. The Early Hittite Period (Period II to ca. 1200 B.C.) brings a decided change. Three</page><page sequence="5">ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS AND DISCUSSIONS, 1983 817 parts of this period are distinguishable: to the first belong various streets and groups of build- ings, to the second unbaked cuneiform tablets of the "Cappadocian" sort, to the third one large building, palace, or temple. In the Later Hittite Period the hill was strongly fortified, the settle- ment small; seals with Hittite hieroglyphs and Egyptian imports occur. Then followed the Phrygian settlement and several of less impor- tance belonging to the last millennium B.c., a larger one of the Romano-Byzantine period, and small ones later. There is brief mention of sev- eral sites visited by the writer. Excavations atHas Hiiyiik.-Louis DELAPORTE reports (Arch. Anz. 1932, pp. 230-233) on a small excavation at this Hittite site. The ceramic sequence was similar to that of other central and western Anatolian sites. Good black pottery was followed by coarser ware; then by polished red ware, in a stratum 10 m. thick, which in its later stages had painted geometric decoration. To- ward 1000 B.C. the site was deserted. Antiquities from Angora.-Various antiquities which came to light, chiefly in road-building in 1931, are described (Arch. Anz. 1932, pp. 233-261; 11 ills.) by DALMAN, SCHNEIDER, and BITTEL. The chief things are: a paved street with a colon- nade, belonging to the time of Hadrian or later; a large building of uncertain purpose with an inter- esting vaulted drain (?), probably of the third century; a Christian cemetery with some inscrip- tions and a chapel of the early fourth century; a fragment of a sarcophagus closely resembling those found at Sidamara. The (unstratified) Roman pottery is also described, and a few objects and sites near Angora. Antissa.-Excavations.-In B.S.A. xxxi, ses- sion 1980-1981, pp. 166-178 (92 pls.; 6 figs. Cf. p. 189), Miss W. LAMB reports on excavations at Antissa, now Ovriokastro, 16 km. southwest of Methymna, in Lesbos. The site may be divided into (1) the Castro, where are the Genoese and Turkish fortifications, (2) the Promontory be- tween the Castro and the Acropolis, (3) the Acropolis, and (4) the Tombs. The report deals with the last three. On the Promontory fine walls belong to the period of the Lesbian Red Ware. There has evidently been a subsidence of the earth since that time. Mycenaean imports, Red Ware, and Grey Ware are found. The latter develops into archaic bucchero. Black glazed wares of the fourth century and later and mediae- val wares were found, and also other classes of pottery in small quantities. The stratification is not always clear. On the Acropolis is a fine polygonal wall with a later continuation. No remains of any temple were found. The pottery belongs to the archaic period and to the fourth and third centuries B.C., the polygonal wall prob- ably to the sixth century and its continuation to the fourth. The tombs contain stone sarcophagi, clay coffins, and jars. All sarcophagi and coffins but one had been opened. The pottery found in and about the tombs was of various types, in part East Greek, in part bucchero, in part Lesbian Red and Grey Wares. A Protocorinthian aryballos is of a type belonging to the first half of the seventh century. A small red jug and five Attic black-figured lekythoi belong to the late sixth and early fifth centuries. The vases illustrated are described in some detail. Thermi.-Continuation of Excavations.-In B.S.A. xxxi, session 1930-1931, pp. 148-165 (5 pls.; 5 figs. Cf. also p. 188), Miss W. LAMB and J. K. BROCK give a report of excavations at Thermi in 1931. The Early Bronze Age Settle- ment shows five successive "towns." The en- trance seems to have been at all times from the west. Towns I and II resemble each other closely, though in Town II some houses of the broader type associated with Crete occur beside other houses of the narrower Anatolian type. Town III covers the interlude between Troy I and II and introduces the bothroi, which may have been made for purposes of drainage. They dis- appear after Town IVa. Town IV (a and b) was larger than its predecessors and was fortified, though the whole course of the walls cannot be traced. This town belongs to the time of Troy II. In the central area of Town V is a single house with antae, which probably has some connection with the megaron at Troy II. The fortifications consisted of triple walls, and two gateways are fairly well preserved. Evidently some new hos- tile power threatened, the seat of which was doubtless in Anatolia. Outside the Early Bronze Age Settlement are traces of a later culture, in- cluding some walls and much "Lesbian Red Ware," with Grey Ware and Mycenaean importa- tions. Some vases of the Lesbian Red and Grey Wares are made on a slow wheel, some on a quick wheel, and some by hand; the last are not con- fined to the earlier stages of development. Some shapes resemble those of Troy VI, some are survivals from the Early Bronze Age, but most are hard to parallel. The Grey Ware occurs more</page><page sequence="6">318 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY frequently at Antissa than at Thermi. Two phases (A and B) are distinguished. Copies of Mycenaean vases are peculiar to phase B. Im- ported Mycenaean vases also occur. Phase B can be dated about 1375 to about 1200 B.c., but phase A cannot be dated until more is known about Troy and Western Anatolia. The similar- ity in fabric of these vases and those of the Middle Bronze Age in Central Anatolia is so striking as to make it probable that the settlers came from somewhere in or near the Hittite region; but Lesbos was in touch with Troy and Crete and later with Mycenae. Small finds of copper and terracotta are also described. Scopas at Chryse.-Three ancient writers cited by Overbeck on the temple of Apollo Smintheus at Chryse in the Troad, speak of the cult statue as a xoanon, a word especially suited to the stiff, archaic figure seen on coins of the neighboring Alexandria Troas. Two of them mention the image of a mouse which accompanies the god and accounts for his specific name, and give Scopas as the artist, in one case (Strabo), of the works, epya, in the other (Eustathius), of the work, p-yov. It is difficult to believe either that Scopas made the un-Scopadic statue or that he made only the mouse, but it is possible that he made the temple itself, for he was an architect as well as a sculptor, and also the mouse, as an important adjunct to an ancient xoanon or a reproduction of an ancient xoanon.

A Water-Cistern at Salamis, Cyprus.-JOAN DU PLAT TAYLOR publishes in the Antiquaries Journal, April, 1933, pp. 97-108, the results of an excavation of a cistern containing Byzantine paintings and inscriptions. Above ground is a complex of walls, in which only two rooms have been cleared as yet. The remains consist of two cisterns joined by a short passageway, and each reached by a shaft from above. The paintings are all in the first cistern except for three crosses in the passageway. Above the doorway leading to the passage are inscriptions calling on Constan- tine for help, mentioning Barnabas the Apostle and the Governor Epiphanios, and quoting scrip- tural passages on the subject of water. On the wall opposite is a head of Christ Pantokrator flanked by aquatic scenes, and three other in- scriptions, in one of which Nicodemus is men- tioned. In the layer of earth on silt which cov- ered the floor, the bones of two small ponies and a foal were found, as well as a number of small bronze, terracotta, and glass objects and some coins. The history is reconstructed as follows: The first cistern was probably built in the first century A.D. and later fell into disuse either after the Jewish sack in the next century or after the earthquake in 345. When Constantius II founded the new city of Constantia here in 350, the need for water increased. Perhaps Nicode- mus, mentioned in an inscription, built a small house over the cistern in the fifth or sixth cen- tury, for the second building is dated by coins to the late sixth. Probably the cistern was aban- doned after Moawiyeh I of Damascus destroyed Constantia in 647, and it is probably to his fol- lowers that several large holes in the cisterns are due. Physicians of Kos.-The Asklepieion of Kos was founded in the fourth century B.c. by the dis- ciples of Hippokrates. In its treatment of the sick, the scientific attitude was always predom- inant; at Epidauros, the religious attitude. The Koan medical service was highly organized. The prestige of these physicians was maintained till the second century after Christ, when they gave way to the Pergamenes. R. HERZOG in Arch. Anz. 1932, pp. 274-276. GREECE GENERAL AND MISCELLANEOUS Archaeology in Greece, 1931-1932.-An illus- trated summary of work and discoveries in Greece and the Greek islands, based in part on that of G. Karo (see A.J.A. 1932, pt. 1, pp. 126 ff.), by H. G. G. PAYNE, is published in J.H.S. lii, 1932, pt. 2, pp. 9235-9255; 17 figs. Funerary and Domestic Cults in Minoan Crete. -In B.C.H. Ivi, 1932, pp. 60-88 (5 figs.; pls. III- VII), PIERRE DEMARGNE publishes an altar and two offering tables from the very important M.M. I cemetery at Mallia. As is known to students, this cemetery is of a new type, composed of tomb-chambers grouped together inside a common wall. These monuments would appear to prove the existence of a cult in this necropolis. The two tables of offerings resemble one found in the palace of Mallia in 1926, and published as such by Chapouthier (B.C.H. lii, 1928, p. 292 f.). The contention of Sir Arthur Evans that this object was a gaming table is to be absolutely rejected. The one from the necropolis, published as Fig. 1 of this article, was discovered in Sep- tember, 1930, and although not actually found in the necropolis, the evidence points strongly to its</page><page sequence="7">ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS AND DISCUSSIONS, 1933 319 having belonged there. It contains two concen- tric circles of cup-like depressions; the outer ring (much damaged by erosion) of 30 to 36, the inner of 13. In the centre is a very large, deep cavity, while one of the depressions of the outer ring is also very large, and deeper than the others. The smaller cups were for first fruits, and the cult in question was probably that of the great Mother Goddess of the Minoans. A second table, similar to this, was found in situ in the cemetery, in a closed chamber. This table was stuccoed over, and the stucco still exists. It was of circular form, with an oval central cavity, of considerable depth and diameter. The stucco shows evidences of having been discolored by fire, showing that in all probability a lamp was kept burning in the central cavity, in honor of the dead. In the chamber with this table was a bench, either to hold cult accessories, or to serve as a seat for worship- pers. Still more interesting is the third monu- ment to be published, the existence of which was known as far back as 1921, and which surely belongs in M.M. I. It was completely uncovered in 1930, and enclosed in a chamber, corresponding to that in which it was originally situated, and a careful study of it was made, in 1931. It was proved that in antiquity it was hollow; the out- side was stuccoed, and around the circular core were dentellated gradations in stucco, making the outside plan square. The interior diameter was 1.08 min., the outside dimensions ca. 1.12 m. square. It is naturally impossible to determine its original height. Owing to its fragile nature, it cannot be an architectural member, although it resembles in plan a column base from Hagia Triada. By parallel examples from Palaikastro and Mycenae, it is decided that this object is an altar. Around it, by the west wall, and the outer necropolis wall, the pavement was stuccoed, and there is evidence to prove that this stucco was frequently renewed. Beside the stucco pavement were a number of cups for offerings, similar to those on the tables. It was here that many of the rites for the dead were performed, and this is the earliest example of such a cult so far discovered. The altar was hollow to receive liquid libations, while the cups were for solid offerings, such as first fruits, as suggested by the combination of both in the paintings on the sarcophagus from Hagia Triada. The writer believes that the rites celebrated in the necropolis are related to the cult of the Earth Mother, whose empire is thus extended to the dead, and that further proof of this is attested by Sir Arthur Evans' discovery, in 1931 of the funerary temple of the priest-kings at Knossos. The second part of the article (pp. 76-88) deals with the discoveries, in the region of private houses, surrounding the palace. Soundings were made in 1931, northwest of the palace, near the excavations of 19924 and 1925. The Minoan remains are close to the surface. This region was first inhabited in M.M. I, but remained occupied up to M.M. III and L.M. I. In two of the houses a room with distinct traces of a stuccoed floor was found, having in each case in the centre, a circular disc of brick, discolored by fire, with a small de- pression in the centre. The discs rest on a very hard base, and are raised some 10 cm. above the floor. It is believed that they are in effect the hearths of the houses in question, and parallels from Mycenae (of much later date, of course) are cited; also from Troy and Phylakopi, but espe- cially the discoveries of Blegen at Korakou, where hearths dating in the Minyan period (M.H.) were found, and to Miss Goldman's E.H. and M.H. finds at Eutresis, where circular hearths of clay or stone, similar to those at Mallia, have been uncovered. Hearths of the E.H. period from Zygouries are also cited. In Thessaly, also, Tsountas has found hearths going back to Neolithic times (corresponding to the E.M. period). In Crete itself Sir Arthur Evans has found fixed hearths in late Neolithic houses at Knossos, and this neolithic culture passes easily into E.M. I; the fixed hearth may have continued till M.M. III, when it disappeared in Crete. The movable hearth first seems to appear in M.M. I. A possible fixed hearth of M.M. Ia has been recently (1930) discovered at Knossos. The ap pearance, therefore, of the fixed hearth at Mallia is not as surprising as might have been believed. Knossos.-Mortuary Chamber and Sanctuary. -In B.S.A. xxxi, session 1930-1931, pp. 191-192, is a brief report by SIR ARTHUR EVANS on the discovery and excavation of a tomb chamber with a mortuary sanctuary and the residence of the priestly warden. See A.J.A. xxxv, 1931, pp. 3492-343. Stalactites.-In the Eph. Arch. 1930, pp. 160- 168, Mr. NICOLAos E. PLATON draws attention to and describes 12 pieces of stalactites roughly anthropomorphic in shape, found with other cult objects in Minoan sites and sanctuaries. These stalactites were taken from sacred caves where stalactite worship, as proved by Dr. Marinatos,</page><page sequence="8">320 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY was common. It is probable that the pillar wor- ship, as suggested by Sir Arthur Evans, was de- rived from stalactite worship and that the latter followed the worship of stalactite forms. Later stalactites outside of their natural surroundings were considered sacred and are found in sanc- tuaries. Stalactites are represented on a sea] impression from Knossos and on another from Hagia Triada. The Sea in Minoan Times.-In the Eph. Arch. 1930, pp. 108-1926, Dr. SPYRIDON N. MARINATOS points out the importance of the sea in Minoan times for artistic and religious inspiration which accounts for the many marine designs and for the association of the Minoan Goddess with marine life, and then he proceeds to describe the various ways in which the sea was pictured. Finally he illustrates the steps which led to the stylization of marine and sea designs. In carving, sea and water in general were usually represented by thin wavy parallel lines, but in painting by means of a net pattern, or of spirals, or even of spray. Often it was omitted, especially in monumental wall paintings and also in Early Minoan Seals. Sea representations appear in E.M. ivory seals, be- come common in the M.M. period, and last to the end of the Minoan-Mycenaean Age. Early Inhabitants of Greece.-In the Ephe- meris Archaiologike, 1930, pp. 1-929, Dr. GEORGE E. MYLONAS discusses the different waves of people which invaded Greece in prehistoric times on the basis of the cultures revealed thus far by excavations. The first two waves were respon- sible for the neolithic culture in Thessaly and the rest of the mainland and probably started from the S.E. corner of Russia. The third introduced Bronze into the mainland of Greece in E.H. times and belonged to the same homophyly with the inhabitants of Crete and the Cyclades. The fourth brought from the north the Minyan culture and formed the first group of the Indo-European tribes which pushed their way into Greece. In this he follows Blegen's conclusions, but he further identifies the Minyan invaders with the lonians. He does not believe that the Minyan culture originated in Troy. The Aeolians and Achaeans followed, and they created the Mycenaean Em- pire. From the assimilation of these different tribes evolved the historic inhabitants of Greece. Excavations in the Kerameikos.-A condensed account of the excavations carried on in the Kerameikos in the spring of 1932 is given by KYBLER, EILMANN, and KRAIKER (Arch. Anz., 1932, pp. 183-9208; 13 ills.). The vicinity of the church of Agia Trias, removed in 1931, was in- vestigated. No traces of an earlier church were found; there were a few burials, not antique and devoid of interest, immediately below the church, and a fragment of a list of names of the Argives who fell at Tanagra in 458 and were buried in the Kerameikos. At deeper levels and near by there were burials ranging from late antiquity back to early Geometric times. Several inscribed stelae and early vases were found. The stratification and chronological indications are described in considerable detail. East of the precinct of the Messenians, the "Querweg9" of the fourth century was investigated. In making the way some burials were disturbed; remains and offerings from them were brought together and buried in a hole dug for the pur- pose. Farther east were many Hellenistic graves, mostly mere holes covered with bricks or the like; and fifth century burials of children in amphoras. Twenty-five graves were found in an area bounded by the central aisle of the Roman Pompeion, the Dipylon wall, the northwest rooms of the Greek Pompeion and the southeast part of its court. Altogether 65 graves have now been found in this region. They belong to early post- Mycenaean times, as the vases of "Salamis" and Protogeometric types show, and indicate an un- broken transition from late Mycenaean to Geo- metric. Particularly interesting is a small group of cremation burials with Protogeometric pot- tery and bronzes of Mycenaean types. Pharsalos.-Archaeological Researches.- Continuing his Thessalian Studies (in B.C.H. lvi, 1932, pp. 89-191; 592 figs.; pls. VIII-X; see also ibid., lii, 1928, pp. 9-44, 444-465; liii, 1929, pp. 101-116; liv, 1930, pp. 367-375; and lv, 1931, Chronique, pp. 492-493), Y. BEQUIGNON de- scribes at great length excavations made by him to establish the position of the town of Palaio- pharsalos. His previous views had been chal- lenged by Stihlin (Bayer. Bldtter f. d. Gymnasial- schulw. lxvii, 1931, pp. 1-17) and differed from those of Heuzey; consequently he wished to dig at the points suggested by them. Stihlin's opin- ion was that this place was to be found on the hill called Palaiokastro-Derengli, and he suggested that as he was unable to make the excavation him- self, he would willingly waive whatever claim he might have in B(quignon's favor. Work was therefore undertaken there in the spring of 1931 (May 18-31). The topography of the place is</page><page sequence="9">ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS AND DISCUSSIONS, 1933 321 given, with a map of the site. Stihlin had noticed remains above the surface, but these Bequignon could not locate. A wall was, however, found at the western part of the hill, made of small stones, cemented together by sand. Parts of it had been taken in the past for building materials. On the west it follows the contour of the hill. It has suffered from the action of spring torrents flowing down from the summit of the hill. This wall completely encircled the hill, and inside it was a settlement, quite easily unearthed, being only about 0.40 m. below the present surface. The walls of this settlement are of a type common in Thessaly. Evidences of a street were also found, but no entire house plan. It was in looking for such a plan that, on May 25, the fragments of a black-figured deinos, signed by the painter Sophilos (see B.C.H. Iv, 1931, pl. XIX) were found. Many tombs were opened; they were below the house levels, and in several cases con- tained vases and sherds. The pottery belonged in four periods; black glazed ware and ordinary red ware on the upper level, sub-Mycenaean and Geometric a little below, then Minyan, and, lowest of all, hand-made ware, similar to sherds found by Blegen at Korakou and Zygouries, and by Heurtley in Macedonia, and belonging in the Early Helladic period. All the finds are illus- trated by photographs (except the Sophilos vase, for which see reference above), each specimen being described, and parallels from other sites being given. It is apparent that this site was inhabited from the Early Helladic period to the end of the Middle Helladic; habitation was then resumed in L.H. III, and continued till the end of the sixth century B.C. No later material was found, and habitation was never resumed from then till the present day. Bequignon, however, is now inclined to agree with Stihlin in placing the site of Palaiopharsalos here, on the basis of the Sophilos vase, explaining its abandonment by the fact of the growing importance of the new Pharsalos, attracting the inhabitants away from their old home. The second part of the article (pp. 119-1920) publishes a terracotta figurine from the as yet unexcavated site of Orman Magoula, of a type frequently found in Thessaly, and belonging in the neolithic period. The third part (pp. 1921- 19292) discusses the course of the Enipeus River, verifying observations previously made. The fourth and longest part, which occupies the rest of the article (pp. 19292-191), takes up excavations conducted at Ktouri, 111 2 km. N.W. of Phar- salos, from May 31 to June 10, 1931. The im- portance of this site had been discussed already by Bequignon in B.C.H. lii, 1928, p. 25 f. A topo- graphical description of the acropolis of Ktouri is given. It is feared that many ancient walls have been destroyed to provide building materials for nearby villages. It is on a height commanding the Pharsalian plain, but has no water supply, other than springs in a marshy district to the west. But it was an important strategic point, easily defended, and this did not escape the atten- tion of the ancients, for well-preserved remains of two fortress walls at different levels exist. The lower one is of large polygonal masonry-the base is 0.65 m. below the present level, and rests on bed rock. This lower wall was pierced with several gates, the most important of which seems to be the north. Between this wall and the second enceinte, or phrourion, was a region apparently uninhabited in antiquity. The phrourion was at the top of the hill, and a description and plan are given. It was built of two parallel walls of smaller stones, with the interior space filled with rubble, and was coarsely but solidly built. Five towers of a primitive type were placed at different points along the wall. The finds within the phrourion were insignificant, the most interesting being four tiles with the inscription EbKparlbov, dating probably in the third century. No house or cistern remains were found, but fragments of pithoi for holding water, weights, a spear head, and some sherds of sub-Mycenaean and undec- orated wares were found. It is apparent that no permanent habitations existed within the acro- polis, which was used as a point of refuge in times of invasion and war. Therefore the city was be- low the hill. Trenches were dug in the region of the swamps to the west (now abandoned and un- healthy) at a magoula, between the springs and a deserted mill of modern construction, where re- mains of walls existed, and at a point to the north, where the ground plan of a building was unearthed, yielding sherds from Minyan to Protogeometric. Other remains, however, suggest that it was a temple of the archaic period, which had been com- pletely destroyed and pillaged. A list of the finds is given, including six circular terracotta plaques, similar to those found at Delphi and Olynthos, weights, stone objects, etc. West of the magoula is a large plain; stone blocks and sherds on the surface suggested cutting trial trenches, one of which yielded interesting re-</page><page sequence="10">322 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY sults,-a tomb, with a pithos and a larnax, within which were a vase and fragments of others, show- ing that a possible necropolis had been discovered. The pottery fragments found in these trenches and the magoula show continuous habitation into the archaic period, which is further attested by the discovery of a bronze statuette. The earliest pottery is Minyan, of which a few isolated and insignificant sherds were found; but there is an abundance of sub-Mycenaean ware, of which, however, only one complete vase can be put to- gether, probably of a local ware. The spiral is the motive most frequently employed, and the sherds with this design are photographed and listed. Vases with banded design also prevail-these ex- amples are similarly treated, and others with sim- ple linear designs. There are also undecorated wares, similar to vases of the end of L.H. III, found at Mycenae, Korakou, and Zygouries. Ktouri is much richer in sub-Mycenaean than most Thessalian sites. Protogeometric sherds were also found, similar to finds elsewhere in Thessaly and Macedonia, and at Vrokastro in Crete, but here, as elsewhere, it seems to be of local manufacture. Finally, west of the magoula, a bronze statuette of a warrior (pl. X) was found by a Greek, who brought it to Bequignon. The preservation is good. A detailed study of the statuette shows that it belongs in the beginning of the sixth century, as it observes the law of fron- tality, and all the characteristics of early archaic sculpture. There is a strong resemblance to similar work in the Peloponnese, suggesting that this statuette is an importation. Returning from the magoula to the acropolis, the ancient cemetery is now in the middle of the marsh, making excava- tion impossible, but at the N.W. border of the acropolis the principal spring of Ktouri is to be found. Today barely accessible, it was in an- tiquity reached by a paved causeway. At the north, near the present chapel of Hagios loannis, was another spring, which the present inhabitants believe to have miraculous properties. There- fore Bequignon dug trenches near this spring, thinking it might be the survival of an ancient cult. Ancient pavements and a peribolos wall were found, but the pottery fragments were prin- cipally Byzantine; it is believed, however, that further investigation would reveal Greek remains. The Byzantine sherds would date from the tenth to the fourteenth century. These excavations at Ktouri, therefore, show continuous occupation from L.H. III into the Byzantine period, and that the acropolis, never inhabited, remained a place of refuge. No inscriptions were found in this cam- paign, but Heuzey found one in Latin, and a funerary inscription in Greek, of the Roman period, exists in the nearby village of Simikli. Bequignon follows Stihlin and others in believing Ktouri to be identified with Euhydrion, destroyed in 198, and mentioned only by Livy. The nu- merous springs in the district suggest the identifi- cation, as well as the continuous occupation. This short campaign has, therefore, succeeded in placing Palaiopharsalos and Euhydrion in their correct situations. Excavations at Thasos, 1925, 1931.-Y. BEQUIGNON and P. DEVAMBEZ describe in B.C.H. lvi, 1932, pp. 232-386 (28 figs.; pls. XI-XVIII) a Roman quarter, the principal building of which was the Odeion, which is situated in the im- mediate neighborhood of the modern village, making complete excavation impossible. The buildings unearthed all appear to belong in the same period,-the second century A.D., about the time of the reign of Hadrian. First, a street is described, going from N.E. to S.W., through the centre of the quarter, and connecting it with the Prytaneum and Agora. It was obviously one of the principal arteries of the city, and is well paved with large blocks of local marble of varying size and shape. On each side was a narrow sidewalk. An exedra is next described, first excavated in 19925, which was in ruins when first found, but has now been rebuilt out of the original blocks. It has an Ionic entablature with a frieze design of garlands, boukrania, and rosettes, and a dentel- lated cornice. On the top is a series of dowel- holes for statues, the precise number of which it is not possible to determine. In the interior is a dedicatory inscription in Greek, showing that a statue was set up here by the city to one Komis, daughter of Leodamas; another inscription shows that this Komis dedicated a statue to her hus- band; and lastly we have the artist's signature, Li- mendas. None of these names except that of the sculptor is new. Although the excavators were first tempted to date this honorific monument in Hellenistic times, it cannot be earlier than the period of Hadrian. The most important building in the district is the Odeion, which is very poorly preserved, exposed to autumn and spring torrents, as it lies at the foot of the slopes of the Acropolis. The original skene has either completely dis- appeared, or was never built. The Odeion was never finished, but was put into use before com-</page><page sequence="11">ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS AND DISCUSSIONS, 1933 323 pletion, and shows evidences of rebuilding at some subsequent period. The seats were divided into six sections by stairways at regular intervals, the two on the ends bordering on the walls of the paro- doi, which were not covered. Evidence also shows that the building was erected in haste. Even the stairways were for the most part un- finished; possibly only two of them were ever completed. The parodos walls are the best pre- served part of the building. The work, although at first glance fairly good, shows signs of careless- ness and faulty construction, and many blocks were reused from other buildings. The specta- tors' seats were supported by earth for the lower rows, by pillars of masonry for the upper, seven of which were laid bare; they are thick and of rubble held together with mortar, and were connected together by other walls forming a semicircle, under the koilon. The pillars were naturally higher and larger at the centre. The higher rows were also supported by a vaulted gallery, as is customary in Roman theaters. There were paro- dos entrances at north and south, and interior stair-wells, the stairs of which have disappeared, and were doubtless of wood. The nearest parallel is the Odeion at Gortyn. No inscriptions which could set a date were found in this building, but architectural evidence places it in the second century A.D. We cannot determine the reasons why it was never finished. At a later time the southern stair-well was entirely filled in with heavy masonry, as was the southern parodos en- trance, and four blocks from other buildings, of different patterns, were brought together to form a skene. Several graffiti were found at different parts of the Odeion. Further soundings prove that it was built on the ruins of a building of the archaic period. Next to be described is a rec- tangular portico unearthed near the Odeion, on the other side of the street; it was to be expected from Vitruvius (IX, 1) that such a building, to afford a refuge for spectators in bad weather, would be found in its vicinity. It consists of a central court, surrounded by four porticoes to form a rectangle. The court is well preserved and is paved by one hundred slabs of local marble, of equal size and shape, very regularly laid in ten rows of ten each; a well at the east end served to drain off water when it rained. The interior colonnade rested on a low stylobate, and carried seven columns on the sides, and five on the ends. Only on the east stylobate do the bases of columns exist; but the anathyroses for the bases of the others are plainly visible, and it is possible that the columns were never set up. On the west end this anathyrosis has been made for Doric columns, but elsewhere the order was Ionic or Corinthian. There was an outer colonnade on the east where the building runs along the street, and on the west, exactly corresponding to the inner; but ap- parently there were no columns on the north or south sides. These walls end in engaged pilasters at the west. The south wall was pierced by a door near the eastern end. Immediately west of this portico is a rectangular building, built at a good period, but subsequently rebuilt. It is en- tered by four doors, two on the north opening into different rooms, one on the east and one on the west. It had once been destroyed, and the re- building took place afterwards. In the interior it is divided into two parts, north and south. In the south part is a construction resembling an altar. It is impossible to determine the purpose of this building, the earlier part of which is prob- ably pre-Roman. At the north of the area is a ruined foundation which may be another portico, extending N.E. to S.W., and may have had shops behind it, but the evidence is not sufficient to make any definite statement. Several houses were found; across the street from the rectangular portico was a large house, pierced on the street by six doors. This house was built largely of reused materials of poor quality. The doors may have been of shops, and the evidence shows that the builder wished to convey an impression of luxury. One other Roman house is described, the court of which was excavated. Some pieces of sculpture were found in this Roman quarter, which have either already been noted in the Chronique des Fouilles of the B.C.H. as they were found, or will subsequently be separately published. None of them can be dated earlier than the end of the first century A.D. The article ends with the publica- tion of a dedicatory base in Greek in honor of Hadrian and Sabina, found near the Odeion, in which the emperor is described as rKTL0oTT or builder, showing that it was due to him that much of this quarter was built. The Palace of Kadmos.-In the Ephemeris Archaiologike, 1930, pp. 929-58, Professor ANT. D. KERAMOPOULLOS briefly describes the excavations of the Palace of Kadmos discovered by him in 1906 on the Acropolis of Thebes, of which he gives a ground plan. The most important re- mains date from the L.H. III times, but a few remains of an earlier palace built in L.H. II are</page><page sequence="12">324 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY also preserved. The later structure was de- stroyed by fire caused by lightning. The spot was considered sacred in the classical period and was not built over even in Byzantine times. Below the L.H. level an earlier filling was dis- closed from which M.H. Minyan sherds and espe- cially some E.H. ware, fully described now, were obtained. The corridors were found full of new vases among which were the well-known in- scribed stirrup vases. In the south part of the palace he discovered a quantity of unworked precious stones-blocks of agate, rock crystal, onyx, etc. These objects are now fully described and illustrated and seem to have formed com- mercial commodities obtained by the king through exchange; vases being the articles manufactured at Thebes and given for the stones. This conclu- sion leads to an interesting discussion of the com- mercial activities of the rulers of the prehistoric city-states. Haliartos.-Excavations on the Acropolis.-In B.S.A. xxxi, session 1930-1931, pp. 189-191, is a brief report by R. P. AUSTIN of excavations at Haliartos in 1931. The eastern end of the temple is entirely destroyed, but the building was about 18 m. long. Foundations of a building to the north of the temple, about 16 m. long and 2 m. wide, built of poros blocks, may be what remains of an earlier temple. A votive deposit found outside the temenos contained a mass of pottery, chiefly black glaze, including sherds with incised inscrip- tions. Among these was a dedication to Athena which indicates that the temple was hers. Pau- sanias mentions no temple of Athena, and prob- ably this was one of those ruined temples which he could not identify. The long rectangular building to the south of the temple, scarcely more than outlined in the excavation of 1928, was appar- ently a hall, 21 m. in length, with a row of col- umns in the middle. It may have been a store- house. It had two doorways in the east side. Outside a paved passage led into the precinct, giving access to the temple and also to the long building. The small finds include pottery, chiefly of the period from the sixth to the fourth century; fragments of two proxeny decrees; some coins, terracottas, bronze rings, and an excellent painted clay antefix. The Tholos Tombs of Marmariane.-In B.S.A. xxxi, session 1930-1931, pp. 1-55 (11 pls.; 2o figs.), W. A. HEURTLEY and T. C. SKEAT de- scribe and discuss six tholos tombs at Marmariane, about 20 km. from Larisa in Thessaly. The tombs were explored by Dr. Leonardos in 1896 and Professor Tsountas in 1898. The present writers visited them in 1931. Their description of the tombs and their contents is based upon the earlier records and personal examination. The tombs are approximately circular and have a level dromos, the inner end of which is covered with slabs. The largest tholos is 5.75 m. long and 5.4 m. wide, the smallest is 2.3 m. in diameter. A Mycenaean tomb described by Tsountas has en- tirely collapsed. In the tombs were found many terracotta vases and fragments, also objects of metal and some of stone, glass, and clay. These are described in detail with abundant illustra- tions. The vases are hand-made local ware and Protogeometric. A Mycenaean jug is probably of local manufacture. The Protogeometric vases show survivals of the earlier local motifs. The affiliations of the pottery and other objects (which include the spectacle fibula) are with Macedonia and Thessaly, but the date seems to make it impossible to connect them with the coming of the Dorians; for careful examination of them shows that they are contemporary with the Protogeometric vases from Knossos and are to be dated about 1000-800 B.C. Late Helladic III Pottery.-R. W. HUTCHIN- SON briefly considers (Liverpool Annals, xix, 3-4, 1932, pp. 117-1920) the differing views of Wace and Forsdyke on the classification of Late Helladic III pottery, and tentatively proposes this scheme: L.H. IIIa, 1400-1300 (Amarna, Gurob, most of Ialysos and Enkomi, Ramp House, perhaps first three strata at Lion Gate); L.H. IIIb, 1300-19200 (Zygouries, strata four to seven at Lion Gate); L.H. IIIc, 19200-1100 (late pottery fromPhylakopi and Paros, Granary, late vases from Tomb I at Asine). The Heroon at Alyzia.-In the Eph. Arch. 1930, pp. 141-159, Professor K. A. RHOMAIOS gives a full description of the heroon excavated by him in 1919-1922 at Alyzia. It was built in the form of an altar towards the end of the second century A.D. and with materials taken from the temple of Herakles, which was probably located near by. It enclosed a marble sarcophagus, and it stood on an almost square foundation and on four steps, the second of which ended at the four corners in the form of a griffin. The walls of the monument, built of regular ashlar masonry, were crowned with an Ionic frieze over which rose a row of low orthostatae bearing at the corners akroteria. The latter are of an interesting and</page><page sequence="13">ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS AND DISCUSSIONS, 1933 3125 elaborate type composed of an acanthus and anthemium design in the center of which is repre- sented an eagle holding a wreath in its beak, or an eagle with a snake on his wing. No traces of a door were found, and it is uncertain how later interments were effected. It is also unknown to whom this monument belonged. Roxana and Alexander IV in Epirus.-The way in which reputable historians can promulgate a false tradition by following the initial blunder of one of their number is illustrated by the general assumption that Roxana and her son Alexander were with Olympias in Epirus during the years between 323 and 317. This belief apparently rests only on the misinterpretation of a passage in Diodorus (19, 11, 2) where Polyperchon ts said to be endeavoring to restore Olympias and her grandson to the throne of Macedonia (Kar~jyfp 'OXtvipr6a Er&amp; 0ro 'AXe?iv'pov irat&amp; fir rln 13acaXElaP) as meaning that Polyperchon brought Roxana, Olympias, and Alexander back from Epirus to Macedonia. The word f3WaacxEa is consistently used by Diodorus and others to mean, not the country ruled over, but the royal power, and it is so used by him (18, 2, 2) of an attempt to place on the throne of Macedonia the bastard Herakles, who had never been in that country. There is every reason to suppose that Polyperchon had kept the little king in his own hands, although he more than once invited Olympias to come to Macedonia and assume the guardianship herself. G. H. MACURDY, J.H.S. lii, 1932, pt. 2, pp. 256-261. Delphi and the Amphictyony after the Aetolian War.-In B.C.H. lvi, 1932, pp. 1-36, P. ROUSSEL studies the inscriptions which show the reaction on Delphi of the war between the Romans and the Aetolians, allied to Antiochus III. The recent studies of Holleaux on the Consul Fulvius and the siege of Same (ibid., liv, 1930, pp. 1-41, and lv, 1981, pp. 1-10) show that these inscriptions have previously been incorrectly interpreted and in- completely published. Roussel comments on and republishes several inscriptions previously pub- lished by Holleaux, Pomtow and others, particu- larly a list of properties and houses given to Apollo and to the city, to be found in Syll.3, nos. 609, 610. A commentary is given. The letter preceding the list is from the consul M'. Acilius, on whose dedi- catory base it is found. It was undoubtedly he who made the donations mentioned above. Be- fore 191 the Aetolians governed Delphi by direct control of the Amphictyony; on their defeat the Delphians seemed to rid themselves of this con- trol, and sought the protection of Rome, through Acilius. His donation to the god was through the confiscation of the goods of a certain number of aliens living within the boundaries of Delphi, who were a disturbing element, and came mostly from adjoining territories. Some of these persons held high positions in the Aetolian League. Acilius seems also to have attempted to delimit the boun- daries of Delphi, for an inscription of the time of Trajan refers to his decisions in this matter. There was also, in 119 B.C., a further delimitation of the territory, and it is to this that Pomtow thinks the inscription of the time of Trajan refers. Roussel believes that the decision of 190 was still in operation in 119. Acilius increased the sacred territory with the consent of the Roman Senate. He also promised that if the Thessalians or others should send an embassy, he would do his utmost to uphold the ancestral rights of the Delphians, and safeguard the autonomy of the city and sanctuary. To enforce this, the Senate passed a senatus-consultum in 189, after the Delphians had sent ambassadors to Rome to urge such action. After the defeat of the Aetolians, the Thessalians attempted, by securing control of the Amphicty- ony, to rule over the sanctuary, and this was not in the interest either of Delphi or of Rome. Consequently an embassy of three Delphians went to Rome to plead their cause against the Thessalians, and in the end of April, 189, re- ceived from the Senate a decision wholly in their favor, and in defiance of the Amphictyons, who were deprived of all authority at Delphi. For questions of disputed boundaries, the Senate recommended recourse to umpires from outside; thus, in 180, we hear of nine Rhodians and one Athenian at Delphi to settle such a case. On their return to Greece in 189 these ambassadors were assassinated, and a second embassy was sent that autumn to demand satisfaction, which was obtained. But Delphi was still under the menace of the Aetolian League, which, having been obliged to quit the area, bore her a distinct enmity. This, however, died down in the years following, with the gradual restoration to civic rights of most of those whose property had been confis- cated. Moreover, the Aetolian League seemed to continue to regard the Pythian sanctuary as a federal shrine. Shorn of all its authority, the Amphictyony seems to have gone on, and meet- ings were resumed in 186, after an embassy had been sent to Rome, and in due course the pretence</page><page sequence="14">326 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY was adopted of its being the rallying ground for autonomous peoples and democratic city-states- the one being Thessaly, the other, Athens, and directed against Macedonia. Pomtow believes that it was also hostile to the Aetolian League, but this hypothesis is unlikely. The senatus- consultum regarding the Amphictyony is in very vague terms, and the theories of Pomtow on this document are to be rejected. Even the date is doubtful. The Name of the Island of Salamis.-In the Ephemeris Archaiologike, 1930, pp. 59-73, Dr. ANTONIOS CH. HADJIs publishes again an in- scription from Salamis originally published by H. Friinkel in Ath. Mitt. xlviii, 19923, and further discusses the ancient names of the island of Salamis. A collection of ten names mentioned by ancient authors is given and discussed, and the conclusion is reached that in the third century B.c. the island was called Kolouris from the promontory known to-day as Pounta and not because of its circular shape. The name Kolou- ris-Koulouri along with the more classical Salamis was in use in mediaeval times and to the end of the eighteenth century. Telephos and Auge.-In the Ephemeris Arch- aiologike, 1930, pp. 73-76, Dr. A. CH. HADJIS calls attention to a passage in Kedrinos A, p. 245, 7 (Bekker), relative to Telephos and Auge, and points out that the relief on the Etruscan urn given by J. Schmidt in Roscher's Lex. d. Myth. for the word Telephos, has no connection with that hero, but represents the queen Pasiphae seated on an altar, Daidalos, a nurse holding the Minotaur, and Minos. The Paean to Dionysos.-In B.C.H. lvi, 19322, p. p289, P. R(OUSSEL) announces that new devel- opments have necessitated certain changes in some of the readings of Strophes iv and vii of this hymn, and that a new article by R. Vallois will shortly appear on this subject. SCULPTURE Colossus in Naxian Quarry.-Good photo- graphs of the unfinished colossal statue in the quarry at Naxos are published by voN MAssow (Arch. Anz. 1932, 264-68) who interprets it as a bearded Dionysos, late sixth or early fifth century. The Composition of the Niobids.-H. SCHRA- DER considers (Arch. Anz. 1932, pp. 285-9288) the Niobid composition, sometimes believed to be imitated from that on the sides of the throne of the Pheidian Zeus. The known composition apparently was intended to be viewed as a whole, and its groups seem to be designed for the slabs of a frieze; hence a connection with the Zeus group is improbable. Possibly the original frieze belonged to the temple on the Ilissos. Signature of a Son of Lysippos.-A mutilated inscription, found by Orlandos at Pellana in Achaea, and published by him (Hpa'rtK&amp;a, 1931, p. 79) is commented on by P. ROUSSEL in B.C.H. lvi, 1939, pp. 287-9289. He disputes the text as first published, and sees in it a statue base set up to the gods, and the name of Euthykrates of Sicyon, the son of Lysippos, as sculptor,-a name and date which would correspond with the forms of the letters of the stone. The statue was of the wife of the dedicant, and confirms the report in ancient writers that this sculptor made many portraits of women. Stelae with Horsemen.-The Stele of Menas in Istanbul, probably of the third century B.c., represents with great precision his last combat, as described in the accompanying epigram. The stele of Dexileos is ideal in treatment. The "five horsemen" are to be understood, with the aid of Xenophon, Hipparch. 8, 923 ff., as a detachment of "shock troops," such as each taxis would have. It was in a similar conflict that Menas fell. ERNST PFUHL, in Arch. Anz. 1932, pp. 1-7. A Terracotta Statuette of a Barbarian.-In the Miinchner Jahrbuch der Bildenden Kunst, N. F. IX (1932), pp. 9291-9295 (6 figs.), J. SIEVEKING de- scribes an unusual and interesting statuette from Centuripe, Sicily, recently presented to the Museum antiker Kleinkunst in Munich. The statuette, which is 45 cm. high, represents the muscular figure of a nude boxer in a well-balanced pose of vigorous action. There are traces of a reddish brown color on the body as well as on the face and in the hair and eyebrows. The hair consists of heavy strands growing back from the low, flat forehead and gathered into a knot at the back of the head. The features are coarse, the expression a combination of savagery and bru- tality. Though there is no other work known which can be closely compared with this one, its realism and balanced pose place it stylistically in the Hellenistic period, possibly about the be- ginning of the first century B.c. It would be in- teresting to know what race of barbarians is here so admirably portrayed. Pergamene Frieze and Hellenistic Painting.- In the east, south, and southwest parts of the Pergamene frieze, the movement of the figures is</page><page sequence="15">ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS AND DISCUSSIONS, 1933 327 either parallel or perpendicular to the background. On the north side and northern part of the west side the movement is at an oblique angle to the background. The former was the old style of the third century, the latter the new style of the second; evidently there were two directing sculp- tors. The later style continues into the first century after Christ, but in Augustan relief the oblique angle is made by groups rather than by single figures. In the reliefs of the arch of Titus and often thereafter, there is a different style, which had been used in Italy since the second century B.c.: the center is the foreground, while at the sides the depth increases. From this development in the treatment of space various influences on Roman paintings are drawn; e.g. the last style (of the reliefs) appears in the third Pompeian style and more in the fourth; the Aldobrandini Wedding is a classicistic creation of the late Hellenistic period. F. MATZ, in Arch. Anz. 1932, pp. 9278-285. Relief of Bellerophon and Pegasos.-In the Ephemeris Archaiologike, 1930, pp. 76-89, Mr. J. PAPADEMETRIOU publishes relief No. 9225 found in 19925 and now in the collection of the Theseum at Athens. Bellerophon holding back Pegasos is represented on this relief which is proved to be- long to a sarcophagus of Imperial times. The author believes that the composition is a copy of a more famous work in Corinth where Bellerophon was worshipped. VASES AND PAINTING Early Greek Vases from Crete.-In B.S.A. xxxi, session 1930-1931, pp. 56-114 (10 pls.; 36 figs.), M. HARTLEY describes and discusses early Greek vases and fragments found at different times at Episkopi and Arkhanes in the province of Pedhiadha, Fortezza and Kephala near Knos- sos, and various parts of the Palace and Little Palace at Knossos and their neighborhood. A few pieces from Eleutherna are added, and a plastic clay head from the Little Palace, a plaque, and a head (both in the Louvre) are published. The Louvre head and the Knossos head are earlier than the plaque, "perhaps not later than the mid- dle of the seventh century." The pottery is Protogeometric, Geometric, and Orientalizing, though some examples of L.M. III ware are in- cluded. There are fragments of imported wares, Mycenaean, Rhodian, Protocorinthian, and Attic Geometric. From Eleutherna come a few Corin- thian fragments and a Laconian crater. The marked differences in fabric and decoration be- tween the Protogeometric and the Geometric styles may be attributed rather to increased com- munication with more developed regions than to the invasion of a new race. The shapes and deco- rations of individual vases are described in detail, and their possible affiliations are discussed. Little-Master Cups.-Certain classes of little- master cups, the so-called lip-cups and band-cups, with a few small subdivisions such as Gordion and Cassel cups, are listed under the names of the artists signing them and briefly described, dis- cussed and illustrated by J. D. BEAZLEY in J.H.S. lii, 1932, pt. 2 (pp. 167-204; 5 pls., 20 figs.). The vases are found in all the great public museums, including those of New York and Bos- ton, and some private collections. Some twenty- five different "makers" are represented. The writer considers a lip-cup by Phrynos, in London, "the best of all little-master cups." A Klazomenian Sarcophagus.-LENNART KJELLBERG publishes (Jb. Arch. I. xlvii, 1932, pp. 1-11) a Klazomenian sarcophagus in Dresden, no. 23 in Joubin's list. By its marked diminution toward the bottom, it belongs to the late group of Class B. There are three bands at the top repre- senting animals, a battle scene, chariots-and animals at the bottom; these last are in "white- figure" technique. All details are discussed with citation of analogies, and attribution to the painter of the Berlin sarcophagus (Ant. Denk. ii, pl. 25) is suggested. Resemblances between these sar- cophagi and the style of the Andokides painter are alleged; Miss Pryce's revision of Kjellberg's chronology is rejected; the probable importance in art of Klazomenai and of Asia Minor is emphasized. Spinning Women.-G. RODENWALDT (Arch. Anz. 1932, pp. 7-21) disputes Beazley's rule that a woman shown spinning in a vase-painting is necessarily respectable. He discusses several doubtful cases. INSCRIPTIONS Inscriptions from Thessaly.-In the Eph. Arch. 1930, pp. 97-107, Mr. NICOLAOS J. YIANNOPOULOS publishes two inscriptions of freed slaves of the Roman period and eight inscriptions on stelae, one of which dates from the Archaic period. They were discovered in various parts of Thessaly. Inscriptions from Philippi.-PAuL COLLART publishes, in B.C.H. lvi, 1932, pp. 192-231 (19 figs.), twenty-one inscriptions, found, with one</page><page sequence="16">328 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY exception, in the campaigns of the French School at Athens at Philippi in 1930 and 1931. The in- scriptions fall into three categories: (1) monu- mental (nos. 1-3); (2) honorific (nos. 4-14); and (3) funerary (nos. 15-21). The principal monu- mental inscription is carved on architrave and cornice blocks of a temple of the Corinthian order, set up after the death of Antoninus Pius. This is proven by the use of the word divus before the em- peror's name, never employed by Antoninus in his lifetime, so that the temple dates, therefore, in the time of Marcus Aurelius. The second is from the architrave of a building set up to replace one that had been destroyed by fire, the third from a temple of Mercury. Of the honorific inscriptions, the first and most important is in honor of a king Rhoemetalkes of Thrace, of whom we begin to hear from other sources about 19 A.D. No. 5 is in honor of M. Lollius, proconsul of Macedonia p20- 18 B.C.; no. 7 is in honor of the Emperor Constan- tine (it being estimated to have been set up some time between 3524 and 337 A.D.). Of great inter- est is no. 8, set up by veterans in honor of their former centurion, L. Tatinius, during the reign of Domitian. The importance of this lies in its giving his full military career, step by step. This same officer himself set up the stone numbered 9 in this article, and it is believed that he was a native of Philippi. The other inscriptions in this group are of less importance. The funerary in- scriptions are not of great interest. Nos. 17 and !21 are in Greek, and no. 19 is a fragmentary stele of a horseman in relief, without any inscription. COINS The Chronological Classification of Athenian Coins with Names of Archons.-In B.C.H. lvi- 1932, pp. 37-59 (pls. I, II) MICHEL L. KAM- BANIS takes up the study of ten groups of coins, of which the finds at Delos have provided a large number of examples. The scheme adopted is that of bringing together the matrices, in their artistic sequence. The dates arrived at by this process disagree with those of Kirchner (Zeitschr. fir Numism. 1898, p. 74) and Sundwall (Unter- suchungen z. att. Miinzen, p. 108). The groups studied are spread by the latter scholar over a period of seventy-one years, but the present writer believes them to have been struck off in a period of ten years. On stylistic grounds, Sundwall's con- clusions are open to suspicion. The first series, that with the names of Euboulides and Agatho- kles, lasted, according to Kambanis, for only two months. The year is completed by the series with the names of Zoflos and Evandros. The next year begins with the names of Damon and Sosikrates, and runs through an entire year; this is followed by Eumelos and Kalliphon, also a year in duration. Then follow Herakleides and Euk- les, under whom there is a large list of monetary officers, whose names, together with those of the archons, are always given. In fact, these names form one of the means by which the sequence is arrived at. By a study of these names, Kambanis reaches the conclusion that coins with the names of these two archons were struck off over a period of two years. They are followed by Andreas and Charinautes, lasting a year, and then by Ikeios and Asklepiades, also lasting a year. The next series, that of Timos- tratos and Poses, appear to last for thirteen months, and are overlapped by Amphikrates and Epistratos. The final pair are Dositheos and Charias. While no definite dates are assigned by the writer, previous scholars have dated the series from 171 (ZoYlos and Evandros) to as late as 32 (Andreas-Charinautes; so dated by Beule). Sundwall's latest date is 104 (Amphikrates- Epistratos). In some decade between 171 and 104, therefore, according to Kambanis, these coins were minted. ITALY GENERAL AND MISCELLANEOUS Excavations in the Forum of Caesar.-Only the summit of three arches above ground marked the spot where archaeological finds of the greatest interest are now coming to light. These include a number of shops; the basilica argentaria, a banking establishment; a block of buildings on the Clivus Argentarius, which linked the Via Flaminia and the Via Sacra; and, most interesting of all, perhaps, architectural members of the Trajanic rebuilding of Caesar's temple to Venus Genetrix. These last include Corinthian capi- tals, column-bases, richly ornamented architrave blocks, and fragments of a frieze of putti, the at- tendants of Cupid in his mother's shrine. SENA- TOR CORRADO RICCI, in the Illustrated London News, March 18, 1933, pp. 386-7. Excavations at Minturno.-" We began on March 30, with a gang of thirty men. Our prin- cipal purpose being topographical this season, we started at a point on the north wall of the Roman colony of 295 B.C. where, as I reported in my paper at Syracuse in December, we believed that we had</page><page sequence="17">ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS AND DISCUSSIONS, 1933 329 found a gate at the close of the last campaign. This gate is now almost cleared and proves to be a remarkably interesting monument. Instead of being in the center of a stretch of straight wall (as we should have expected from the example of Ostia) it is at the point of a flat angle. The pas- sage of the gate is about five meters wide, and is flanked by two amazing pentagonal towers of the best quadratum construction. The courses are 59 cm. (i.e., two Roman feet) in height and ex- tend three courses below the outer.ancient ground level. A curious feature is that although the town lies in a flat alluvial plain, we have found absolutely no trace of a moat or ditch. "Our second trench is in the theater. Last season we opened up the E. parodos as far as the edge of the orchestra circle. The theater is Augustan with a considerable rebuilding early in the second century A.D., and perhaps another in the early fourth century. The pavement and the lowest seats are pretty well in place, and we expect to lay bare the entire cavea this season, deferring until a later time the excavation of the outer arcades. "The third sector is in the Imperial Forum, which lies across the Appian Way from the Re- publican Forum which was dug last year. The pavement lies only a few centimeters under the modern level, and the building foundations there are in bad shape; we hope, however, to recover the ground plan of the Forum. We are at present working on a row of small shops along the north front of the Forum and on a colonnade which bounds it on the east. "My volume on the twenty-nine altars from the early first century B.C., found last year, has gone to press. The altars contain the annual lists of the magistri and magistrae of the cults of Venus, Ceres, Spes and Mercury Felix. The book will be out early in July. In the meantime we are working on volumes on the architectural terracottas and on the topography and monu- ments of the Republican city." Letter of JOTHAM JOHNSON. SCULPTURE A Medallion of the Arch of Constantine.-Carl BlUmel publishes (Jb. Arch. I. xlvii, 1932, pp. 90-96) a head recently acquired by the Berlin Museum. By fitting it to a cast of the medallion of the Arch of Constantine which represents a sacrifice to Hercules, it is found certainly to be- long to a figure behind the Emperor. Better preserved than the other heads on the medallions, it is identifiable as Antoninus Pius. The emperor therefore is Hadrian and three medallions, in which Antoninus appears, are dated 138. The medallion with the lion-hunt apparently contains a portrait of Aelius Verus and belongs to 136 or 137. COINS Coins of Lucius Antonius.-Struck in 41 B.c., these coins have on the reverse a figure of Fortuna Primigenia; in some examples she holds in her hand what is to be regarded, in view of Lucius's connection with Praeneste, as a "sors Praenes- tina." L. LIEGLE in Arch. Anz. 1932, pp. p276 ff.; 3 ills.; the topic discussed more fully in Zeit. Num. xlii, 19392, pp. 80 ff. MALTA A New Discovery in Malta.-The Imjar megalithic sanctuary recently excavated is com- posed of three nearly circular rooms grouped in the shape of an ace of clubs. Three wide, shallow steps lead to the entrance, once a covered passage over which one of the great roof-blocks still lies in place. This passage and the rooms were once paved with large flagstones. Nearby is a smaller replica, built of smaller stones and paved only with beaten earth. The larger sanctuary con- tained flint implements and Neolithic sherds similar to those found elsewhere in Malta, but the sherds in the smaller building were of a later and inferior type. Ill. London News, March 11, 1933, p. 339. AUSTRIA Zwendorf on the March.-A New Prehistoric Site in Lower Austria.-In Mit. Anth. Ges. Wien, LXIII Band, I-II Heft (1933), pp. 17-~27 (2 pl., 2 t. f.), K. WILLVONSENDER describes the finds from this hitherto unexplored and unknown settlement with remains of the Neolithic and Bronze Ages, as well as of the "Hallstatt" and Germanic periods. Among the Neolithic pottery and stonework, three phases were recognized: (1) the Incised (Linear-keramik) phase representing the oldest Central European development; (2) the Jordans- mtIhl phase (a part of the so-called Lengyel com- plex which developed out of the Incised and which also includes the Central European Neolithic painted wares); (3) the "Nordic" phase (called "Danordic" by V. Gordon Childe in Danube, etc.</page><page sequence="18">330 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [Oxford, 1929], pp. 116 ff.). The first two are designated as Danubian cultures, the last as the south-Nordic mixed culture as defined by Men- ghin (Weltgeschichte [Wien, 1931], pp. 411 ff.). A copper flat celt is ascribed to the Jordansmlthl phase. (Important if truly authentic.) The "Nordic" material represents the largest part of the Neolithic finds. Its general character is similar to the Bohemian and Moravian material of the same period. (Compare Stocky, A., La BohIme Prdhistorique I, L'dge de pierre [Prague, 19926], and Schranil, J., Vorgeschichte Bdhmens und Mdihrens [Berlin, 1929] etc.) The Bronze Age material, comprising grave and domestic pottery, an axe and a bone blade, belongs to the Lausitz phase (advanced Bronze Age). Middle "Hallstatt" is postulated on the basis of only two sherds. Similarly, the Germanic period is scantily documented by a few ceramic remains. Apparently, the first to third centuries A.D. are indicated. There are a few uncertain specimens. (The antler axe might well be "Nordic.") Animal bones are described collectively without chronological differentiation, and are, therefore, meaningless. Bronze Swords from Austria.-In Mit. Anth. Ges. Wien, LXIII Band, I-II Heft (1933), pp. 1-16 (192 text figs., ~2 pl., 1 map), L. NISCHER- FALKENHOF writes about Late Bronze and Early Iron Age bronze swords, covering 78 finds. It is the first time this material has been collectively written up (indeed, in certain cases, the specimens have never been published), and a distribution map presented. Many of these finds indicate the routes of the salt trade from Hallstatt towards the Danube and further northward. A variety of types is figured. The Hallstatt Settlement on Steinberg at Ernstbrunn.-In Mit. Anth. Ges. Wien, LXII1 Band, I-II Heft (1933), pp. 108-1925 (16 text ills.), V. LEBZELTER reports upon his excavation pur- sued on this site in the fall of 1930, which revealed dwellings of the "Hallstatt" C period, datable roughly to 600 B.C. The finds are described as follows: (1) disturbed human bones of one individual; (Q) bones of domesticated animals: cattle, horse (only two phalanges), sheep and goat (both numerous), dog (Canis fam. matris-obtimae Jeitt), but no pig; (3) game: elk, deer, boar, wild cat, fox; (4) remnants of huts, consisting of lightly burnt flooring (plaster?) which suggested rectangular structures (a single sentence describes so important a fea- ture!); (5) stone implements, namely polishing and grit stones, jasper strike-a-lights, and sundry fragments; (6) pottery which is divided into (a) crude ware, irregular in paste, poorly baked, with simple decoration, (b) medium ware, of finer clay, and well fired either with or without the admix- ture of graphite in the paste, with punctate, dim- pled, and impressed decoration, (c) fine ware (usually from graves) with rich decoration ("Kerbschnitt" prominent); (7) weaver's arti- facts, i.e. weights, spindle whorls; (8) bone and horn implements, such as a spear head, a spatula (both of bone), polished antler prongs of proble- matic forms; (9) sherds of sieve vessels; (10) frag- ments of ceramic ladles; (11) metal is scarce; one pin, part of a pendant; one piece of slag found;(12) cult objects: moon idols of clay, part of a wagon wheel, also of clay, a perforated astragalus; (13) three stray minute Neolithic celts were recovered and are interpreted as indicating a cult. There is no summary or any generalization or specific comparison. Burial Tumuli of the Terminal Hallstatt Period in Lindetwalde near Scharding.-In Mit. Anth. Ges. Wien, LXII Band, V Heft (1932), pp. ~258- 9265, G. KYRLE publishes the finds from six burial mounds which yielded pottery, fragments of iron, and a few flints, dated to the end of "Hallstatt," and transition into La Thne, if not already La Tene A. Of special interest are the poly- chrome and graphite-slipped vessels from tumulus No. 3. E. Hofmann adds analyses of the botanical re- mains among which several varieties of trees have been identified. The Foundation of a Late Keltic Dwelling from Roggendorf, near Eggenburg.-In Mit. Anth. Ges. Wien, LXII Band, V Heft (1932), pp. 266-275 (6 pl., 2 t. f.), A. STIFFT-GOTTLIEB presents an interesting account of his excavation of a unique rectangular house foundation with an entrance ramp, an elevated fireplace, hearth with a flue, and a "Schnabelgrube." The material found within it comprises pottery, iron artifacts and bone im- plements and belongs to the Late La Thne phase (La Thne D, roughly the first century A.D.). Similar remains exist in the Eggenburg Museum. (Material shows a striking resemblance to that of the extensive fortified Late La Thne seat at Stra- donice in Bohemia. See Pi6, J. L., Le Hradischt Stradonitz en Bohrme [Leipzig, 1906].)</page><page sequence="19">ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS AND DISCUSSIONS, 1933 331 GREAT BRITAIN Excavations on Thundersbarrow Hill, Sussex. -In the Antiquaries Journal, April, 1933, pp. 109-151, E. C. CURWEN publishes the results of excavations carried out on a ridge stretching from Southwick near Brighton to a point about four miles from Shoreham-by-Sea. The remains in- clude a small camp containing a quadrilateral en- closure; some depressions representing a Romano- British village; and an extensive series of lynchets, cultivation terraces. The camp consists of a weak earth rampart enclosing a roughly circular area of about three acres, with two original en- trances, on the North and South sides. Within is a trapezoidal area of about one and a half acres, defined by a small ditch, and to which access was obtained through entrances on the East and West. That the entrances do not correspond may be an indication that the camp and the enclosure are not contemporary. The Romano-British settlement contains numerous pits in which were found pot- tery and grain. In some pits had been construct- ed furnaces for the parching of grain. Grind- stones were found, as well. The excavators con- clude that the inner enclosure was constructed in the fifth century B.C. and the camp perhaps a century later. Then the hill was deserted until 50 B.C. when an agricultural settlement grew up, lasting about a century. To this period the lynchets belong. The furnaces remained in use until about 400 A.D. The pottery, published by KENNETH P. OAKLEY, consisted of terra sigillata, color-coated ware, domestic Roman ware, and domestic ware. Etruscan Antiquities in Liverpool.-An account of the Etruscan collection in the Public Museums of Liverpool is given by MARY A. JOHNSTONE (Liverpool Annals, xix, 3-4, 1932, pp. 1921-137, pls. XCIII-XCIV). Forty-two pieces are listed; most are jewelry. The various classes that are represented are briefly discussed. A gold lamina with an obscure scene in repousse is interesting; the finest piece is perhaps a "tiara." AFRICA South Africa in the Stone Age.-In the Illus- trated London News, April 29, 1933, pp. 606, 6928, and an illustrated color supplement, C. VAN RIET LOWE describes an expedition conducted by him- self through South Africa. He reports the finding in great abundance of Stone Age implements of all periods, and expresses his belief that the strik- ing parallels with European implements indicate a common origin, and the probability that the cradle of this prehistoric civilization was in South Africa. He illustrates many of the polychrome rock-paintings, among them one with character- istics so strikingly Egyptian that he considers it probable that the Bushman artist is recording an actual appearance of these invaders. CHRISTIAN, BYZANTINE AND MEDIAEVAL GREECE The Morning Hymns of the Emperor Leo.-In B.S.A. xxxi, session 1930-1931, pp. 115-147, H. J. W. TILLYARD records a resolution passed at the Conference on Byzantine Music held at Copenhagen in 1931, which recommends a uni- form method of transcription, and he adds to this a supplement concerning intervals, groups, and interval signs, with comments of his own. He then publishes translations and musical versions of Morning Hymns VI-XI of the Emperor Leo. Marble Tables in Athens.-In the Eph. Arch. 1930, pp. 90-96, Mr. DEM. J. PALLAS pub- lishes four pieces of marble tables, now in the Byzantine Museum at Athens, dating from the third-fifth centuries A.D. and bearing a decora- tion carved in low relief. On the first from Arcadia a return from a successful hunt is repre- sented, on the second from Nelos a charging lion is depicted, on the third from New Anchialos two animals facing each other, and on the fourth a bird is represented in a square formed by a maeandral pattern. A Clay Incense Burner.-In the Eph. Arch. 1930, pp. 1927-140, Dr. ANDREAS XYNGOPOULOS publishes an important fragment belonging to a clay incense burner of an interesting and not very common shape. The fragment bears a deeply incised decoration representing a bird with a male human head, differing from the type of the harpies and sirens, and apparently derived from Persian and Mesopotamian prototypes. Such creatures are common in Anatolian relics of the twelfth and the thirteenth centuries A.D. and on Persian vases of the ninth-thirteenth centuries, and seem to be connected with the Moslem conception of Para- dise. In Byzantine works of art they are not uncommon, five such representations carved in stone, one on ivory, and two painted on vases being known. The Byzantine artists, however, developed the type borrowed, and gave to this</page><page sequence="20">332 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY unique bird a male head instead of the female head common in Moslem Art. The fragment probably dates from the fourteenth century A.D. ITALY The Cathedral of Pisa and the Riddle of Its Origin.-In the Miinchner Jahrbuch der Bildenden Kunst, N.F. IX (1932), Heft 4, pp. 351-376 (3 figs.), S. GUYER deals with the unsolved riddle of the origin of that strikingly individual style seen in the Pisa Cathedral which played so important a part in Tuscan architecture, especially in the initiation of the Italian Renaissance. The historical facts about the building of the cathedral are well known; the difficulty is to be sure how much of the present structure belongs to the earliest period. Guyer is convinced that at least the cruciform plan, the columns and pilasters of the nave, the archivolts and timberwork as well as the external ornamental colonnades are the original conception of the architect whose name, Busketo of Dulichion, is inscribed on the facade. Older tradition made him a Greek, whose coming to Pisa from Ionia would not be unusual consider- ing the close relations between Pisa and the East. Guyer, however, thinks he was an Italian whose father had possibly emigrated to the Greek East, and that his name was Boschetto, the Italian diminutive of the family name of Bosco. How- ever that may be, it seems certain that the archi- tect was thoroughly familiar with East Greek building traditions and that he may even have meant to reproduce in Pisa the form of some one of the buildings which in general conception as well as in special features show a strikingly close relationship with the Italian cathedral. For in- stance, the triforium galleries of Pisa are almost identical with those in the Apulian churches of Bari, Trani, and Barletta attributed to Greeks. The lavish use of rich materials as decoration and the emphasis on this surface decoration are Byzan- tine features which in Pisa, however, are treated with a new spirit of carefully planned and bal- anced arrangement of design which is character- istic of Greek, as opposed to the Oriental all-over tapestry style. The cruciform plan of the Pisa Cathedral is most closely allied to churches in the vicinity of Antioch, especially the martyrium type, with the central quadrangular or octangu- lar space of the martyrdom and the four basilicas extending in four directions such as we see in Kal'at Sim'an, or, even better, in the cruciform churches of Cappadocia. In methods of construc- tion the cathedral resembles again rather the "hinterland," of Antioch than Byzantium, in the timber ceiling instead of the dome and vault; and the wall columns and pilasters of the exterior. But the strongest point of affiliation between Pisa and the Christian East is the underlying tectonic feeling: the horizontality suggests an- tique temples; the absence of the atrium links up with the antique Syrian, non-Byzantine idea; and finally, the strong architectonic conception of the whole structure in space, built from the outside toward the inside, rather than vice versa as in the Byzantine buildings. Notwithstanding this East Christian conception, however, the details of the building are chiefly Italian, that is Lombardic, the work being done undoubtedly by Italian rather than Eastern craftsmen. In conclusion the author reasserts the impossi- bility of solving the riddle of the exact origin of the Pisa Cathedral, but modestly hopes his expo- sition of its possible stylistic relationships may form some slight contribution toward clearing up the important question of the position of Pisa in the cultural life of the Middle Ages. A Madonna of 1262 by a Follower of Guido da Siena.-Within the maximum range of seventy years, from 1215 to 1985, various approximately dated Sienese paintings have been grouped around the name of Guido da Siena. In L'Arte, xxxvi (1933), pp. 3-13 (3 figs.), C. BRANDI adds a new date to the few certain ones, that of 19~62 for the Madonna, No. 16 of the gallery at Siena. This he calls a provincial school version of a Guido type. Brandi also corroborates Weigelt's inter- esting reconstruction of the great ancona of Guido, the central portion of which contained the Madonna of 1221 and whose side panels bore scenes from the Passion formerly in the Badia, Ardenza. Five of these scenes are now in the gallery at Siena; the others are dispersed. A Carved Madonna and Crucifix of the Thir- teenth Century at Brindisi.-In L'Arte, xxxvi (1933), pp. 18-29 (4 figs.), T. KRAUTHEIMER-HESS assigns to the second quarter of the thirteenth century two pieces of wooden sculpture in the Church of the Crucifixion at Brindisi. The Cruci- fix is by an Italian following a French model of the early school of Chartres. Likewise the seated Madonna, of about the same period, shows a strong affinity to French sculpture of about the middle of the century, but is indubitably the work of an Italian. French influence in Italy in the</page><page sequence="21">ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS AND DISCUSSIONS, 1933 333 thirteenth century has long been recognized, re- sulting partly, doubtless, from the presence of French archbishops in Brindisi both early and late in the century. Romanesque Wall Paintings in Frauen- chiemsee.-In the Miinchner Jahrbuch, N.F. IX (19392), Heft 3, pp. 211-!252 (16 figs.), A. F. vON REITZENSTEIN describes for the first time in de- tail some frescoed figures in the arches of the arcades of the nave aisles of the monastery church in Frauenchiemsee. The figures represented are Christ, Mary and Martha, some angels, some crane-like birds and some doves. The coloring corresponds to that described by Theophilus for Romanesque painting; the type of colors used, moreover, relates the frescoes to the Salzburg- Regensburg illuminated manuscripts. The iconography of the figures is not very clear, but seems to deal with some phase or phases of the story of Christ, Mary, and Martha; Lazarus also is represented. The question of the date of the frescoes is considered at length by the author on the basis of relationship to the manuscripts, whose chronology von Reitzenstein has worked out elaborately. The frescoes seem to fit in between the Antiphonal of St. Peter (c. 1150-60) and two manuscripts of the Liutold group, the Michel- beurern Breviary and the Ranshofener Gospels, both by the same hand and dated 1171-1178. They may, therefore, with confidence be assigned to the end of the 1160's. Frankish Manuscripts and the Bamberg Cathedral Choir Screen Reliefs.-In the Miinch- ner Jahrbuch der Bildenden Kunst, N.F. IX (1932), Heft 4, pp. 339-350 (10 figs.), E. LUTZE reviews the relationship of manuscripts to sculpture in the first third of the thirteenth century as exemplified in the sculptures on the screen of the choir of St. George in Bamberg. The Cathedral derivation of these latter from manuscripts was first sug- gested by Panofsky and Jantzen and later sup- ported by Mihle, who, however, considers the relationship not so much an influence of the one reflected on the other as a simultaneous develop- ment of the two from the Byzantine traditions in France and in Germany along parallel but dis- tinct lines. With this theory Lutze agrees. After calling attention to the importance of the pattern books as a means of exchanging motifs and stylistic details in sculpture and in manuscripts, he sums up his argument briefly as follows: the style of the Bamberg choir screen and that of the Bamberg manuscripts can be traced back to the same roots. During one generation, 19200-19Z30, there can be recognized a parallel growth in which the Frankish style is clearly distinguished from contemporary monuments in Germany. The form elements of the Byzantine style were not superficially adapted and put together in a loose coherence, but were united in an organic synthe- sis. In Bamberg can be seen, up until the dis- placing of this fused style by Gothic, the same phases of local style in sculpture and in painting. In the case of the Bamberg reliefs, it is not possi- ble to trace back in detail just how the forms evolved, for the preceding sculpturesque steps are wanting. With the introduction of the influence of the Rheims school of sculpture, into Bamberg, the stylistic relationship with manuscripts ceased, sculpture forging rapidly ahead toward the devel- opment of the high Gothic. Early Gothic thus cut the thread which had up to this time bound together the two arts, and it was only at this moment that manuscripts lost their importance in the history of style development. FRANCE An Early Christian Sarcophagus.-HANs VON SCHONEBECK discusses (Jb. Arch. I. xlvii, 1932, pp. 97-125) an important Christian sarcophagus in St. Guilhem-du-Desert (southern France, near Montpellier). Most of the fragments had been studied by Hamann (Marb. Jahrb. ii, 1925, pp. 71 ff.) and dated about 1140. On one side there was a standing figure of the dead in the center and six miracles: the raising of Lazarus, the sacrifice of Isaac, the healing of the blind, the miracle of Cana, the loaves and fishes, and Peter's fountain. On the other side there is in the center a scene of instruction; on the left the adoration of the magi; on the right three men before a king, Nebuchad- nezzar or Herod. On one end is the expulsion from Paradise, on the other the three youths in the furnace. The first side is typical of a large class ("Orans" sarcophagi) in composition and, with the exception of the central figure, in style; and the scenes on the ends are remarkable chiefly for their high relief and good execution. No ex- ample of this class of sarcophagi has both sides sculptured, and no good parallel for the composi- tion of the second side is known; but the "city- gate" sarcophagi afford the closest analogies. The style of the groups of Magi and of the central figure on the first side is unusual and best paral- leled in minor arts. The costumes indicate a date in the first half of the fourth century. Various</page><page sequence="22">334 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY problems in the study of Early Christian sarcoph- agi are briefly discussed. A Reliquary in the Massena Museum.-The Analecta Bollandiana, Tomus L, fasc. 1 and 2 (1939~), pp. 147-151, describes a reliquary in the Joubert collection in the Massena Museum at Nice. It is a rectangular casket ornamented by two rows of figures in high relief telling the story of the passio of St. Commodus. The reliquary was produced by order of Bernard II of Montaigu, Bishop of Puy (19236-19248), but of St. Commodus no trace of any kind can be found. SPAIN A Pieta by Bermejo.-In Butlleti dels Museus d'Art de Barcelona, March, 1933, pp. 86-90 (10 figs.), J. FOLCH I TORREs publishes some interest- ing illustrations of the Pieta altarpiece by Bartolmeu Bermejo in the cathedral at Barcelona. The photographs, taken after recent restorations, show many details not formerly visible. GREAT BRITAIN Re-appearance of the Colesville Helm.-J. G. MANN in the Antiquaries Journal, April, 1933, pp. 1592-4, announces the discovery by the Duke of Rutland of this helm, which had not been seen since 1855. It is a fine example of a class of which only a few specimens survive, dating from the third quarter of the fifteenth century. RENAISSANCE GENERAL AND MISCELLANEOUS The Origin of the Van Eyck Style.-In the Miinchner Jahrbuch der Bildenden Kunst, N. F. Band IX (19392), Heft 4, pp. 3920-338 (7 figs.), K. VON TOLNAI attempts to bridge the deep gap be- tween the compositional principles of the French miniature style of the late fourteenth and early fifteenth century and the works of the van Eyck brothers. In the former, among which are in- cluded both the Parisian school (Mattre du Mare- chal de Boucicaut), and work done at the court of the Duc de Berry in Bourges (Limburg broth- ers), in spite of the introduction of Italian tre- cento painting with its use of space and figures, the flat color composition still remains a decora- tive arrangement on the page. The colors are solid, mostly blue and red with much gold and silver. In the pictures of the van Eyck brothers, however, even at the outset, this technique is altogether lacking. The colors are shaded both in figures and in landscape; every detail of the picture is selected with the idea of contributing to the naturalistic, light-filled space conception of the whole. If this new style has any roots in the late mediaeval French miniatures, no con- clusive evidence of it has as yet been presented. Between the Annunciation of the Ghent altar- piece, however, and the Annunciation of the Merode altarpiece by Robert Campin there are some striking similarities, such as the bourgeois type of the Madonna pictured in everyday sur- roundings. Moreover, grisaille figures, such as are used on the Ghent altarpiece, first appear in Netherlandish art on the reverse of Campin's Marriage of the Virgin in the Prado, where they seem to be closely related to Claus Sluter's Bur- gundian style of sculpture. A third innovation in Campin's work is the light-admitting window affording a glimpse of a landscape, such as is seen in the right wing of the Merode altarpiece; this same device is used by Jan van Eyck in the Chan- cellor Rolin Madonna. The compositional ideas thus developed by Campin are evident especially in the early work of Jan, and though they gradu- ally diminish, they never completely die out. Robert Campin, therefore, according to von Tol- nai, represents the bridge between the earlier miniature art, especially Netherlandish, and the new style. Campin's landscape is an outgrowth of that of Jacquemart de Hesdin, while his heavy figures and rich drapery come from the Burgun- dian sculpture of Sluter. The introduction of modelled figures into their spatial surroundings gives a unity to the pictures of Campin which is lacking in the miniature style with its dualism consisting of flat figures against a landscape suggesting space. The decorative plane tradi- tion, however, is retained by Campin in his ar- rangement of details in a formal scheme; this latter superficial unity is first discarded by the van Eycks through whom the new microcosmic picture form reaches its fullest development. The symbolism of the earlier abstract style is retained by Campin; he not only represents details with the greatest realism but "lends them a supernatural lustre through which they appear as valuable and sacred relics. He translates super- natural symbols into real objects. In his nature, God is seen no longer as a person: God is trans- formed into His world. A Pantheistic interpre- tation of reality has been evolved." This Pan- theism reaches its full development in the work of Jan van Eyck.</page><page sequence="23">ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS AND DISCUSSIONS, 1933 335 The Artistic Development of Filippo Lippi.- In L'Arte, XXXVI (1933), pp. 39-45 (5 figs.), L. VENTURI reiestablishes the recognized course of Fra Filippo's artistic development as proceeding from L. Monaco and Fra Angelico, passing through Masaccio's influence to its third phase, that of clearly rhythmic line which was his be- quest to Botticelli. The study primarily refutes Berenson's reversal of the accepted order, as pre- sented in Bollettino d'Arte, July and August, 1932. Venturi maintains that while the influence of Angelico on Filippo is indisputable, the insertion of this influence into the midst of the Masaccesque period can neither be proved by facts nor as- sumed as a logical hypothesis on the basis of style. The Madonna in the Cook Adoration of the Magi, in which Berenson finds no trace of any style except that of Angelico, according to Venturi has also distinct Filippesque traits. As to the dates of the various phases of Lippi's artistic career, Venturi maintains the accepted chronology, namely, the early Angelico phase, between 1430 and 1437, the Masaccio period, 1437-47, and the flowering of Lippi's distinctive style after 1447. ITALY Pietro da Rimini.-In Dedalo, Anno XIII, Fasc. I (1933), pp. 3-17 (1~2 figs.), M. SALMI adds considerably to the artistic output of Pietro da Rimini, at the same time placing him in a much more important position in relation to the Rimini school. Hitherto, the only work attrib- uted to him has been the large signed Crucifixion in the Chiesa dei Morti at Urbania, considered by some critics to be a poor reflection of Baronzio. Salmi, however, finds the situation reversed, that is, he considers the Crucifix a fine work of Pietro's middle period which had its influence on Baronzio; he dates it between 1330-40. As an earlier work (1316-20) he attributes to Pietro the frescoes in the Abbazia at Pomposa which show influence from Giotto's Paduan frescoes as does also a Deposition formerly in the Gentili collection at Viterbo, here assigned to Pietro for the first time. The last phase of development of the art of Pietro is seen in the frescoes of Santa Chiara at Ravenna, in which two other hands collaborated with him; the date is about 1340. Between the Pomposa frescoes, the masterpiece of the Rimini school, according to Salmi, and the Santa Chiara frescoes there is a great gap. Pietro, with a true artist's spirit, though he turns to Giotto and the Sienese, never forgets his fundamental elegance and Byzan- tinesque distinction. After Giuliano, who was the earliest of the Rimini school, Pietro appears as a most potent master of the school. Fifteenth Century Frescoed Hunting Scenes in Lombardy.-In Dedalo, Anno XIII, Fasc. II (1933), pp. 65-83 (17 figs.), F. WITTGENS pub- lishes an interesting series of frescoes of hunting scenes discovered in 1927 by Gian Carlo Borro- meo in a small country house on his estate at Oreno. There are four scenes, one large one on the long uninterrupted wall, and three smaller ones. The scenes are probably symbolic but ap- parently the figures represent actual people. There are numerous coats of arms which, however, so far have yielded no definite information as to the identity of the figures. Moreover, the mean- ing of the scenes is not quite clear. In the prin- cipal fresco a hunting party is escorting a noble, who kneels at the entrance to a garden. The landscape appears to have been painted from reality; an interesting feature is the duck pond containing a number of ducks in various positions, some of them having dived in head first. The three phases of the hunt are portrayed: falconry, bird-snaring, and the chase. The style has the familiar "international" characteristics seen so frequently in Lombardy, suggesting rather tapes- tries than frescoes, in drawing as well as in color- ing. The frescoes have no great artistic value but like those in Casa Borromeo (Milan), which they resemble, are valuable as charming illustrations of the hunt for which Lombardy is famous. The artists are not identifiable; the date of the frescoes is the middle of the fifteenth century. GERMANY J*rg Lederer von Kaufbeuren and his Workshop.-In the Miinchner Jahrbuch, N. F. IX (1932), Heft 3, pp. 253-278 (20 figs.), C. T. MtLLER recognizes in a group of carved wooden altarpieces in Vintschgau (South Tyrol) the style of the Suabian school of Allgau and more par- ticularly, of Jorg Lederer. MUller traces in detail the successive phases of style in Lederer's works and places them in a reasonable chrono- logical order, into which the Vintschgau group fits somewhere about the 1590's. The diversity in style among the many works attributed to Lederer argues a large workshop whose products were in demand even outside the vicinity of Kaufbeuren. The altars are characterized by in- creased plasticity of form and stronger emphasis on the organic function of the figures.</page><page sequence="24">NEWS ITEMS FROM ATHENS Although it was not possible to hold a third festival at Delphi this year, Mrs. Sikelianou staged in Athens a very fine presentation of an Orphic Dithyramb written by her husband. They chose a natural hollow on the far side of the Philopappos Hill for their outdoor theatre and erected a tem- porary circular orchestra, or stage, for the actors, while the spectators sat on the hillside. The actors were students, not professionals, but owing to Mrs. Sikelianou's training gave a most beautiful performance. Two Open Meetings were held at the British School during these past months, one on February 9th when Miss Winifred Lamb spoke on Prehis- toric Lesbos, summarizing the results of her exca- vations at Thermi and Antissa, and the second on March 29th when the Director of the School, Mr. Payne, told of the third campaign at the site of the Temple of Hera Limenia on Perachora, the promontory opposite Corinth.1 The American School held an Open Meeting on February 28th when Mr. Shear reported on the Excavations in the Athenian Agora in 1932, and a second meeting is announced for April 29th at which Mr. Kourouniotes will speak on the Teles- teria of Eleusis,' and Mr. Broneer on his excava- tions of the North Slope of the Acropolis. The French School also held two archaeological meet- ings; at the first, on March 30th, Mr. Roussel, the Director, reported on the work of the French School during 1932 at Mallia in Crete, Thasos, and Philippi.2 On April 6th M. Bon gave a very interesting summary of his study of the mediaeval fortifications on Akrocorinth. M. Bon has made a very complete investigation of the Frankish and Venetian castles of Greece. In the Byzantine field Mr. Sotiriou, the Direc- tor of the Byzantine Museum, gave two lectures, in the first of which he discussed the origin of the Arabic letters (Koufic ornament) appearing in conventionalized form as part of the ornamenta- tion of Byzantine churches. These letters are found on the terracotta frieze on the outside of the churches of St. Theodore and St. Nicodemus in Athens, at Daphni, and at St. Luke's in Phocis. Mr. Sotiriou believes that these letters were brought to the mainland of Greece by the Arabs 1Reported in the last News Items. 2 Reported below. who were driven out of Crete after the conquest of that island by Nicephoros Phocas in 961. His second conference on March 1st dealt with the Byzantine Monuments in the Island of Cyprus. Mr. Sotiriou spent some time in Cyprus in the summer of 1931 collecting material and photo- graphs for a publication of these monuments. On March 2nd Mr. Makrides, Director of the Be- naki Museum in Athens, and formerly Assistant Director of the Museum in Constantinople, read a paper on the columns of Constantinople and the legends attached to them. At one of the meetings of the Society of Christian Archaeology Mr. P. Trembelas spoke on Orpheus in Early Christian Art, where the representation is apparently meant to symbolize the domination of sublime harmony over savage instincts. Although the best known examples of this representation of Orpheus are in the catacombs and crypts in Rome, the Byzan- tine Museum of Athens has a bit of sculpture- dating from the fourth to fifth century A.D. which shows Orpheus playing his lyre in the midst of deer and stags, birds and other animals, some legendary like the sphinx and the griffin. At the second meeting Mrs. Sotiriou read a paper on the cupola type of basilica, of which Santa Sophia is the supreme example. Santa Sophia represents also the combination of two types, that of the Hel- lenistic basilica with galleries and that of a central basilica with cupola. As a more primitive ex- ample of this same combination Mrs. Sotiriou mentioned the so-called Basilica on the Ilissos, at the foot of Ardettos, which has been recently entirely cleared by Mr. Sotiriou. The spring excavation campaigns have begun in several regions. The American excavations in the Agora, having been resumed in January, will continue until July. They have now opened a vast area to the east of the Theseum besides working in two other areas, one to the southeast of the first and the other near the Stoa of Attalos.3 In Corinth the American School are carrying on excavations in two areas: Mr. Broneer is investi- gating the south side of the market place with its long south stoa while Mr. de Waele is continu- ing his last year's clearing of the Precinct of a Mr. Shear's preliminary report on the results of this year's campaign will appear in this number of the JOURNAL. 336</page><page sequence="25">NEWS ITEMS FROM ATHENS 337 Lerna near the Asklepieion. Mr. Payne, with some of his students from the British School, is carrying on a short campaign, his fourth, at Perachora. The University of Cincinnati ex- pedition under Mr. Blegen and Mr. Semple is continuing the work begun at Troy last year. The chief activity of the French School in 1932 was the continuation of their work at Mallia in Crete where M. Chapouthier completed the resto- ration of the Palace magazines and made some supplementary researches at the northwest angle of the Palace and on its south facade. At this point the superposition of the two Palaces is clearly visible, since a metre of deposit separates them. The first Palace extended further to the south and a series of rooms with a corridor has here been explored. The walls are well built and still retain their stuccoed coverings. At the foot of the walls are benches and sockets or niches for lamps, as the excavator judged from the traces of fire surrounding them. Rich deposits of Middle Minoan I pottery were found. M. Demargne continued his exploration of the Necropolis of Chrysolakko where the stratification is now clear; there is a lower level of Middle Minoan I date, composed of a series of sepulchral chambers. Later, but still in Middle Minoan I, an enclosure wall of fine masonry was built around the tomb chambers. At the west of this enclosing wall were found numerous fragments of half columns in the local stone covered with yellowish stucco. Further investigation of private houses was made in two regions. The first, about 300 m. north- west of the Palace near the houses explored in 1924-5, showed little more than foundations, as the soil is very shallow. Two large clay circular areas 0.70 m. in diameter were found, however, which seem to have been hearths; one, as at My- cenae, stood in the open air in the middle of the room with four columns surrounding it. This is one of few examples of the fixed hearth in Crete. In the second region, nearer the Palace, on the west, a large house of Middle Minoan III to Late Minoan I date was cleared. A wall of good masonry faced the road, and a corridor gave ac- cess to magazines filled with vases, and led to a large paved court with a light-well, while a side corridor led to a bathroom. Among the small finds from this house were a bronze double-axe, a Cycladic idol and a table of offerings. Near the modern road remains of houses were encountered which, to judge from the objects already recov- ered, should provide a rich harvest in next sea- son's exploration. A bathroom and a large chamber with stuccoed walls have already been cleared. Part of the frescoes from the north wall, consisting of stylized plant motives in blue and red on a white background, were so well pre- served that they have been removed for restora- tion. Other finds include a stone lamp with lily decoration and a magnificent stone vase. In Thasos MM. Devambez and Launey of the French School continued the excavations in two regions. M. Devambez explored the sanctuary located in 1927 north of the Poseideion. The foundations are of the archaic period, but Roman rebuilding and later destructions make it difficult to obtain a coherent plan, nor can the identifica- tion of the building be established. Pottery ranging from the seventh to the second centuries B.c. was found in this region. South of the Agora a further section of the Odeion has been explored. Here were found quantities of archaic Cycladic, Corinthian, and Attic pottery, and fragments of a large archaic pithos with decoration in incised relief of a sphinx, a sea monster, and a horse's head. The rectangular court, or "hypostyle hall," has been entirely cleared. To the south- east of the Arch of Caracalia another large struc- ture has been revealed further exploration of which was left to a later campaign. From it, however, came a very fine nude male torso of local marble with the left leg preserved as far as the knee. It is of excellent workmanship and should be dated about 470-460 B.C. Near the sea a whole complex of monastic buildings and churches, two of the basilica type, were discovered by means of trial trenches but not cleared. At Philippi, MM. Collart and Ducoux have continued their exploration along the Drama- Cavalla road. The Roman temple found the preceding year was completely cleared; it is of the Corinthian order and consists of a rectangular cella with a pronaos and two columns in antis; the date is the end of the second century A.D. Many architectural fragments were found which will assist in the restoration of the faqade. This temple formed part of a great architectural scheme rising above a large open space, probably the forum. Flights of steps led up from the forum to the higher level where the Corinthian temple and other buildings were symmetrically placed. Many statues of Roman date came to light as well as a great number of Latin inscrip- tions, including a large part of the dedicatory inscription of the Temple and a dedication by</page><page sequence="26">338 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY the Thracian King, Roemetalces.

The mound on which the church stood covered a considerable area to the north of the Street of the Tombs. Mr. Kubler and his as- sistants investigated this area to bed rock. The earliest burials belong to the first millennium B.C., to judge from the geometric pottery found with them. In the seventh century cremation graves and shallow offering-channels made of clay tiles were constructed on the slope rising to the south of the Eridanos brook. Offering-channels of this type have been found hitherto only near Vourva in Attica (2 km. south of Pikerini). One of the Dipylon examples is preserved to a length of more than 12 m. They contained, in addition to the bones of birds and carbonized matter, very fine vases of the Protocorinthian and Early Attic style of the seventh century, some of them having rich plastic decoration. About 600 B.c. a massive grave enclosure of crude brick walls and stone cover slabs was built above these offering chan- nels (Fig. 1). This is the first important grave monument of the time of Solon which has come to light. It contained merely the ashes of a single burial. .About the middle of the sixth century B.c. a grave mound about 5 m. high and 30 m. in diameter was erected over this fine structure, composed of the rubbish from earlier tombs, as is seen from the mass of Early Geometric and Early Attic pottery. This tumulus contained four shaft graves; in each lay one skeleton with funerary equipment dating from the middle of the sixth century B.c. The next generation and on down into the fifth century, distributed their graves, both burial and cremation, over the whole hill. Similar stratification was found to the west of the mound, between it and the modern Piraeus Street. Soon after 350 B.c. the appearance of this area was transformed by a large filling of limestone rubble which left all the east side and summit of the old tumulus exposed, and which sloped down to the Sacred Way beside the Eri- danos. From the rubbish forming this grave- area was recovered a very fine relief of the begin- ning of the fourth century with a metrical inscrip- tion.1 The stele represents a grandmother, the German Institute, and to Dr. Kubler, the Director of the excavations. 1TEKNON EMH: OYFATPO: TOA EXQ ,IAON ONTEP OTE AYTA: OMMA:IN HEAlQ ZQNTES EAEPKOMEOA EXON Ampharete, holding her grandchild who had died before her.

Again, after the destruction of the Kerameikos during the siege of the city by Philip V the whole area was transformed and new monuments erected and a great building of the second century B.c. arose at a higher level above the fourth century B.c. tombs bordering the Sacred Way. In the Sullan reconstruction there was a new fill 3 m. high above the Sacred Way. There were no more graves but remains of houses were found.

This was used until the third or fourth century A.D. Mr. Kuibler has reinforced the foun- dations of the later monuments over the whole area so that the different periods of Attic grave building may be clearly distinguished one above the other (Fig. 3).

Hess has concluded his investigation of the Sacred Gate of the Eridanos and in addition to important conclusions in regard to the fortifications of Athens at this point, he discovered two very fine archaic marble sculp- tures: the torso of a horse and rider (Fig. 4), and a lion, of the end of the sixth century B.c. Both are half life-size and came from grave monu- ments. Like so many others, these had been .......... ............ - - --- - ------ . .......... . ............ 4 op. X ... ..... ... . . .........

FIG. 3.-MOUND OF HAGIA TRIADA IN THE KERAMEIKOS AS IT Now APPEARS WITH TOMBS OF VARIOUS PERIODS SUPERIMPOSED ONE ABOVE THE OTHER Eilmann has cleared an important necropolis, in the lower stratum of which a children's ceme- tery of the fifth century B.C. was discovered. The tiny bodies lay in small terracotta tubs or in simple amphorae. To this period also belongs a relief of a mother with a child in swaddling clothes. Higher up are graves dating from the fourth century B.C. to the third century A.D. Very much older are the graves inside the city wall in the Pompeion precinct. In addition to those already known Dr. Kraiker has exca- vated about sixty new ones; they contained sub- Mycenaean and Protogeometric offerings from the twelfth to the eleventh centuries and permit the important conclusion that between the latest built into the hastily constructed wall of Themis- tokles. The report of the excavations undertaken by the Greek Archaeological Society in 1932 is now available. Professor Orlandos continued the clearing of the Odeion of Pericles at the southeast corner of the Acropolis. The entire north side of the structure has been laid bare and its exact length can be given as 60.60 m. This wall is well preserved and is built of orthostates of Hymettos marble and above that Pentelic marble and still higher four courses of poros covered with a layer of painted stucco. During this clearing of the north wall were found an altar in the shape of an omphalos with the symbolic fillets painted on it,</page><page sequence="29">NEWS ITEMS FROM ATHENS 341 and pottery ranging from Byzantine times to the sixth century B.C. with one very fine black-figured fragment depicting Herakles pursuing an Amazon. Professor Orlandos also excavated at Sikyon, where he selected the site about 60 m. northwest of the great Roman ruins called Palati, where there had been visible part of a long supporting wall built of large squared blocks. This supporting wall was cleared for a length of 55 m. and it appears to have supported a rectangular terrace, 70 m. long by 35 m. wide extending towards the north up to the rock of the Acropolis where a vertical cutting was made for the end of the wall. On the terrace were found remains of a great horseshoe-shaped build- ing whose inner dimensions are 18 m. by 58 m. with an interior colonnade whose roof is supported by the exterior wall. In front of the stylobate of the columns there was a large water-channel of tufa covered with waterproof ce- ment and having at intervals ellipitical cavities to catch the solid matter carried along by the water. The existence of this channel indi- cates that the central space between the colon- nades was open to the sky. A similar supporting wall was discovered on the slope east of the ter- race at a depth of 2.50 m. In this eastern sup- porting wall was found a curved stairway of nine and six steps and in the centre a rectangular fountain which is cut back four metres into the terrace. The fountain consists of a rectangular reservoir with its outer side formed of a low bar- rier placed on two pillars. In front of the reser- voir is a vestibule in antis. The walls of the fountain are covered with a very hard plaster. The water was brought to the fountain by three conduits ending in bronze lions' heads. With the help of still other architectural fragments Mr. Orlandos was able to restore the complete design of this structure. In the north side of the sup- porting wall a narrower stairway was discovered which also led to the top of the terrace and near it were found traces of a propylon whose faqade towards the north was closed at a later date. Behind the propylon remains of a portico ap- peared, following the line of the terrace toward the east. These consisted of the stylobate and a pilaster with an Ionic base. Mr. Orlandos be- lieves that he has found here the western end of the Agora as described by Pausanias. The most FIG. 4.-HORSE AND RIDER FROM A GRAVE MONUMENT BUILT INTO THE WALL OF THEMISTOKLES NEAR THE SACRED GATE OF THE ERIDANOS important of the movable finds are: an inscription referring to the athletic games of the first half of the fifth century B.C., written in the Sikyonian alphabet and mentioning the victories in the Pythian, the Isthmian, Nemean, Sikyonian, and Athenian games; fragments of terracotta roof tiles; the torso and separate head of a Roman marble statue; a marble head, perhaps a portrait of Agrippa the Younger; two marble torsos, one male and one of a woman. All this sculpture belongs probably to the first century A.D. The excavations near the long portico brought to light the torso of a statue of Artemis, less than life size, of the type of the Rospigliosi Artemis and to be dated in the fourth century B.c. A certain number of fourth and third century B.c. terra- cotta figurines were found as well as some small vases from the tomb of a child. Mr. Orlandos in the course of his campaign made a topographical plan showing all the traces of the ancient Sikyon known up to date. In Aetolia Mr. Rhomaios resumed his work at</page><page sequence="30">342 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY Thermon. To the west of the great temple he discovered walls of prehistoric date and also con- tinued his study of the elliptical temple, part of which had come to light the preceding year. This building contained in the middle of its large apse a circular hearth made of stones and flat slabs which must have been constructed in the last two or three centuries of the second millen- nium. Around the hearth were found many superimposed layers of bones and ashes coming undoubtedly from the large sacrificial pyres dedi- cated to Artemis Laphria and Apollo Thermios. Among the terracotta fragments were some which confirmed the view that the roof of the third century B.C. temple of Apollo Lykeios was vaulted at one end. Other terracotta fragments led Mr. Rhomaios to conclude that in place of any early acroterion there had been a simple crowning band above the pediment peculiar in that it took the place of the sima. There were also found many fragments of sun-dried bricks from the walls of the cellas of the temples. In the region of Kalabaka and Kastraki in Thessaly, the Ephor, Mr. Xyngopoulos, under- took an exploratory campaign to determine the site of the mediaeval town of Stagi and to study the church and its surroundings at Doupiani. At neither Kalabaka nor Kastraki could he find any traces of the Stagi of the Middle Ages but his investigations at Doupiani were more successful. To the northwest of Kastraki, opposite the princi- pal group of Meteora, rises a solitary rock, called the column of Doupiani. At the foot of this rock is a chapel of the Virgin which formerly served as the church of the first monastery of Stagi before the founding of the large churches of Meteora. On the summit of Doupiani are still visible re- mains of the two monasteries of the Pantocrator and of Doupiani, now inaccessible. The chapel of the Virgin, the dimensions of which are 4.90 m. by 7.95 m., is a small basilica with a single aisle and a semi-circular apse on the east. It had a wooden saddle-roof and in the course of the exca- vations the remains of a veranda were also found which surrounded the chapel on the north, west, and south. In spite of the fact that the church had been repaired at various epochs the chapel as it now stands is the same as that built in the twelfth century. This is proved by the style of the architecture and masonry and shows that it must be classed with similar structures in Mace- donia, at Castoria, Verria, etc. It is well known that the architecture of Byzantine Thessaly and, in particular, that of Meteora, is closely connected with that of Macedonia. In the island of Cos, just now suffering from a severe earthquake, important discoveries were made by the Italian excavators in 193c2. At Kephalos, situated at the extreme southwest end of Cos, two churches belonging to the first By- zantine period were cleared. These churches are of the ordinary basilica type with three aisles, semi-circular apses, a narthex, and a pronaos with four doors. It has been possible, in the first church, to set up four marble columns with their Ionic capitals. In the second, the bema was found in good condition, with the episcopal throne, some columns and some fragments of marble which permit the reconstruction, on paper, of the iconostasis and the other parts of the church which had marble revetments. The most inter- esting discoveries, however, were the well pre- served mosaics which covered an area of almost 1300 square metres. They are divided into several sections and show chiefly geometric de- signs, although the dove and the peacock also appear. The colors used are white, red, blue, black, rose, light-blue, yellow, and orange. A corridor paved with mosaic joins the two churches to the Baptistery, while there are other sacred edifices nearby. The severity of their architec- ture and the fineness of the execution of the mo- saics leads the excavators to place the churches at the end of the fourth or beginning of the fifth century A.D., in the pre-Justinian period. The larger of the two may have been dedicated to St. Stephen and the second to St. Thomas, although no definite evidence for these attributions has yet come to light.
