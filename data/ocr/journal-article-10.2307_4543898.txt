<plain_text><page sequence="1">133 VI.-ON THE RELATION OF THE THEORETIC TO THE PRACTICAL ACTIVITY. By HILDA D. OAKELEY. PHILOSOPHY is inherently a matter of theory, and it may seem that in asking for a philosophy we ipsofacto preclude ourselves from the understanding of practice. True insight is made impossible by our procedure, and yet no other procedure is conceivable. Practice, in submitting to be philosophised upon, has already capitulated to theory; it must stretch itself out as dead for the dissecting knife, the life it has given up involves movement, change, succession, time. These must either be abandoned or they must be prepared before they can become material for philosophy. In the process of preparation they pass into new forms: time becomes space, or time and space alike become phenomena of an order in reality which is not temporal or spatial. The irreversible must be conceived as that over which the mind can pass backwards and forwards, or as though the cause might follow, the effect precede (cf. Bradley, Appearance and Reality). For a hypothetical consciousness, past may be future and future past. Cause and effect rnust be resolved into reason and consequent, and these again into relations equal in their rank -for knowledge, however profoundly unequal for practice. Thus does philosophy play with its prey when it attempts to rationalise practice, and, having destroyed in it all the tremors which render it unfit for a place in the world of theory, it sets the practical side by side with the theoretic as an activity of thought, or mind, or spirit, having, in fact, omitted that which separates and distinguishes it from the proper object of knowledge. Is any other I 2</page><page sequence="2">134 HILDA D. OAKELEY. treatment, indeed, possible ? If we ask thought to pronounce upon life, to reflect or plhotograph it, life in-Lst be brought into position so that the vision of thought can reach it, though in conveying it to that position we mlay find ourselves conveyinig only its dead body. Have we any choice except between the two alternatives ? Either this which we have spreadl out here for the analysis of thought is the reality, and all that appear- ance of ceaseless change and production of the niew and irrecoverably unique is .illusory, unreal, a semblance which must be transformed into sonmething nearer truth for thought. Or action and life are for ever removed from the touch of philosoplhy, since at that cold touch they perish; with their real nature philosophy cannot deal. To some extent the latter position may seem to have been admitted, consciously or uncon- sciously, by some of Bergsoni's followers (if iot by Bergson himself), in the tacit acceptance of the description of their tendency as anti-intellectualistic. Bergson (as I understand him) rejects the verdict of the itntellect upon the nature of life, movement, time, the true character of reality, without setting up any reliable faculty which can take its place in philosophy. For instinct is not a faculty which can provide us with theory -indeed its possession in perfection appears to be denied to the thinking being. The embryonic power of intuition which, when fully growin and united with intellect, may lead us to a wider uinderstanding of truth can, in its present condition, only at rare mnoments give us an elusive insight into that creative movement which is reality, and it is (I think) left unexplained how the vision thus gained can, as our minds are niow, be elaborated into philosophy without the inevitable initroduction of fatal error by the intellect which must complete the task. For the present the anti-intellectualist must surely abandon the hope of attaining a true philosophy of life, and with that a philosophy of any object, since we are nearest to reality in the process of life. Can he do imiore thani spade-work, preparing for the greater mind of the futuie ? The intellectualist, also,</page><page sequence="3">RELATION OF THE THEORETIC TO THE PRACTICAL ACTIVITY. 135 who holds that experience cannot be fully rationalised without transformation by thought, seems to confess the failure to present a philosophy of life. For it must be agreed that in such transformation-at least, as performed by the absolube idealist-life becomes hardly recognisable by the great mass of those who experience it. The satisfaction, then, that we seek in philosophy is a " special " (i.e., theoretic) satisfaction, a satisfaction for the baffled knower wlho has been labouring to bring the scattered and apparently incompatible fragments of his knowledge into that unity whieh thoug,ht demands; it is niot satisfaction for the same being as practical, the hope of finding the truth of practical life is not set before the seeker. Has, indeed, the attempt ever been made on the basis of practical life itself ? This is the question which it is the object of this paper to put, or inake the attempt to state. What I would ask this Society to consider is whether the question is a valid one or ab initio to be ruled out as self-contradictory, or whether the possibility of philosophically understanding practice may not have been hindered by the choice of the standpoint from which the subject has been in general approached. Philosophy began (in Europe) with that question concerning the niatuire or original principle of things, in which was imiplicit (before the development of the special sciences) that conception of the relation between philosophic and scientific methods which has, o01 the whole, been maintained through the history of thought. When a philosophy appeared (in Heraclitus) asserting the principle withlout which all life and action must be condeemned to a low degree of reality, the principle of flow and change as the very core of thiings, it was already a protest, a heresy which could never become orthodox. And when philosophy began to concern itself with practical life, it was regarded as coming down from heaven to earth, i.e., this seemed to be a departure from the true subject and method of philosophy, for these were concerned with the universe of objects which can be conceived as spread out as a vast</page><page sequence="4">136 HILDA D. OAKELEY. whole, every part of which would be accessible to a perfect mind. Into such a conception when (in the course of philosophic history) developed to its full extent, a realm of things changing and growing could be admitted. For all the phases of change and growth, though so elusive as to be incapable of grasp, and calling for the notion of the infinitesimial, can be represented as innumerable shades of difference, all interrelated under some category which need not, for intelligi- bility, be a temporal or causal category or, if these, only as transformed by thought. And thus the vast scheme which floated before philosophic speculation as a " regulative ideal" may be said to have remained capable of absorbing one after another of the spheres of existenlce, including, life in plants and animals, and finally including man. So at least it might seem, but into such a scheme man cannot enter as a practical being. For Aristotle ethics was a department of practical philosophy. Philosophy had already been defined, its nature determined, frorn the point of view involved in early Greek speculation. From a true conception of practical philosophy which should place it side by side with the theoretic he was precluded by his treatment of Ethics and Politics in the somewhat narrow inter- pretation given by Greek thought (except in Plato) as the whole of the subject. It had nothing to do with First Philosophy, Ontology, or Metaphysic. There is some truth in the observation of Signor Croce that "on reading, without prejudice, the parts of the Memorabilia, the Platonic Dialogues, the Nicomachean Ethics and the Maona Moralia that relate to it" (the principle that virtue is know- ledge) "it appears evident that what is treated in them is the altogether empirical question of the iinportance that mental development has for practical life, and whether knowledge suffices for this, or natural dispositions and discipline of the faculties be not also necessary." In modern philosophy Ethics has, on the whole, been treated either as an empirical study, or, where a metaphysic of Ethics has been formulated, the method</page><page sequence="5">RELATION OF THE THEORETIC TO THE PRACTICAL ACTIVITY. 137 has really involved taking the uncriticised categories of moral judg,ment and relating them to a metaphysic developed out of reflection upon the theoretic activity only. Thus Kant's Categorical Imperative is an attempt to make that move and live in the practical world, which has been formulated without any reference to practical reality. Or, to put it otherwise, his expedient for endowing the universal of reason with life is to embody it in a system of motive and act which has relative existence for the intellect when analysing the practical from its own abstract standpoint, but is not the original truth of the practical reality. Nevertheless Kant's recognition of the ultimate validity of the practical, as expressed in the position given to the Critique of Practical Reason in relatioln to the Critique of Pure Reason, anld the conception of the Primacy of the Practical, seems to come near to a truer view. His main position, however, is based on the always orthodox philosophic method which really proceeds upon the static view of the universe, even when concerned with phenomena that are irreducibly dynamic. And even Plato's discovery in the latter stage of his thought that the Ideas are forces, though containing in it the truth, the understanding of which might have altered the whole course of philosophy, could not restore to life that which his genius had already petrified,in forms so glorious as to hypnotise the minds of all succeeding students. The ultimate tendency of such a inethod may be inidicated by reference to Professor Royce's attempt, in his article on Logic, in the new Encyclopcedia, to relate together types of action and modes of thought, by applying to the universe of action, in order to establish its absolute character, the samile process of reasoning as he applies in the universe of thought. He suggests, for instance, that the number-system can be so applied as to characterise the process of action. " Any orderly succession of deeds in which men pass from one to the next has certain of the characteristics of the series</page><page sequence="6">138 IIILDA D. OAKELEY. of ordinal whole niunbers." Our knowledge of the whole numbers, like our knowledge of the difference between yes and no, may be fouinded (in his view) upon the consciousness of our own activity, and some of its necessary characters. He supposes, presumably, that he is thus treating action as the more fundamental experience, and carrying its modes over into thought. But is he not, in fact, transferring the logical mode of thought into the sphere of action ? "Perhaps there is something about the nature of our activity, so far as it is rational, which necessitates a possible next deed after any deed that has been actually accomplished ?" There does not appear to be anything in this analogy between next deeds and next numbers, beyond the fact that the two are both orders belonging to a world known partially, and not as a whole, immediately. For we cannot trace a bond in the succession of deeds which should furnish a clue to the quality :of the necessity in the number series. The bond in the action series is quite other. Is there, indeed, anythino more in this conlception of "next deeds" than a form in human life of the universal mode of succession ? Since he is under the condition of time, the active being must pass on to the next phase, and it belongs to his nature to pass on with consciousness, or creatively. Again, Professor Royce (followina Kempe) tries to apply logical principles in the practical sphere. To any mode of action-such as singing-there corresponds, he thinks, a nmode which is contradictory, e.g., "not-singing," and lbe conicluides: " The modes of action are a set of entities that in any case conform to the same logical laws to which classes and propositions conform." A set of modes of action may therefore be viewed as a system within which the principles of logical order must be regarded as applicable. He admits that it would be impossible to define with any exactness the totality of all possible modes of action. This would involve a contradiction such as the class of all classes, or greatest possible ordinal number. There is, in</page><page sequence="7">RELATION OF THE THEORETIC TO THE PRACTICAL ACTrvITY. 139 fact, no such totality. But it is possible to define a certain set or " logical universe" of modes of action in case there is some rational being who is capable of performing soine one rational act. Having named some definite mode of action, which the rational being in question is capable of conceiving, the system may be determinied, and will possess its own logical order-type. The fallacy of this kind of speculation seems to be due to that abstraction from the real process which generally characterises philosophies of practice. All activity has the theoretic as well as the practical aspect, but, in this application of logical categories to action, what has happened is that to the active process, after there has beeni abstracted its own proper theoretic element, there is added the theoretic form belonging to another kind of theoretic activity. As a result, the type of action presented is a mutilated form. The infinity in the possibilities of action is lost sight of, as well as the uniqueness and inidividuality of each of its stages. In order to approach the question of the orig,inal truLth of practical activity, we must endeavour, then, to make the experiment of estimating the experience at a moment prior to all such abstraction. We abstract in the process of living not less than in the process of knowing. This is inevitable at the stage of practice at which we find ourselves in ordinary experienice. The will is not fully informied with thought, because both thought and will are weakened except in rare experienices. It is because we are accustomed to abstract these aspects froin the real process that we find it so difficult to understand their relation to each other. Action and thought are aspects of one and the same process, as thouight and extension are in Spinoza aspects of one substance. Spinoza himself, in the form he gives to his parallel, renders impossible a presentation of the real process, for if thought is an aspect corresponding lnot to the livinig movement but to the skeleton outline of the object of consciousness, then thought also is lifeless.</page><page sequence="8">140 HILDA D. OAKELEY. Practice in general is doubly abstract, abstracted from the creative action of mind, abstracted from the reality of the practical process; over the whole extent of life we see it in weakened form. The view that the process of reality is creative as presented by M. Bergson, in spite of its profound insight both into the nature of consciousness and the nature of experience, appears to stop short of the whole truth in taking as its starting point a mutilated view of reality. It is conceded to the pragmatist that in the fact of life, the process of living, we must seek the key to the universe, as though this fact, this process, could be taken as anything real in abstrac- tion from that content of value without which we could have no experience of life and change-or not of life and change as creative. We must still ask-how does the dlan de vie become valuable ? Bergson describes the stream as flowing on from the original dlan and creating, but if the flow is without meaning there is no force to maintain it in movement. Creativeness must be of that which has value. I think that through criticism of experience taken at its highest point- that is when most real-it might be shown that our conscious- ness perceives no sequence, our acts do not follow one on the other except as held together by value. It appears, then, that the notion of creativeness superadded to the conception of the irresistible flow of life cannot give reality to this flow alone, or rather creativeness itself is an incomplete notion unless it inean increase of that energy which is the source of all value, the energy of a spiritual reality through activity of persons. Our President, who, as I venture to think, in his book on The Philosophy of Change somewhat spiritualises M. Bergson's theory, writes in a sense with which the view I am trying to state would so far accord, that " there are no things but only actions," "things are our eventual actions." This is Bergson's view. When he observes further that "there is a reality much wider which overflows it" (i.e., the nature of the body)</page><page sequence="9">RELATION OF THE THEORETIC TO THE PRACTICAL ACTIVITY. 141 on every side, a reality which we call mind, or soul, or spirit," I am still able to agree, but he seems to be overpassing Bergson, at least in the language used. The emphasis, how- ever, laid by Dr. Carr as by M. Bergson on the necessity of the material instrument for action, indicates that action as under- stood in the Philosophy of Change is something other than that practical activity which is the main subject of this paper, and (from my point of view) less real. Take, for example, the statement that " the body is the insertion of our being into the reality, our contact with the becoming, that is the manifestation of universal life," and that therefore " without the body we are nothing, for we can do nothing," and "that which can do nothing in a world of action is nothing." For according to the standpoint of the presenlt paper that superficial appearance of activity which is produced by the physical change is in general but a phenomenon of the real process of the practical, and its place, the degree of reality it possesses, may have a very slight relation or none at all to the amount of apparent change involved. The difference of view is here profound. For it seems that for Dr. Carr and M. Bergson the quality of activity cannot be predicated of ultimate reality. "Without the body we are nothing, for we can do nothing." We, i.e., presumably the world of persons in the practical activity of whom-as it seems to me-we are nearest in our experience to the ultimately real. Thus, as it may be put-on the one hand the universal flow of life in the Philosophy of Change, the most real for that philosophy, seems (to me) lacking in reality, because lacking in value. On the other hand the activity of persons which is apparently conceived as developing out of that primal source of change is for Dr. Carr as for M. Bergson only real in a secondary sense, and in my view, since not endowed by them with the reality it should have in its own right, it would be devoid of reality as of value. For philosophy the question of the starting point is of the</page><page sequence="10">142 HILDA D. OAKELEY. greatest moment. Bergson starts from the process of life, because no doubt through intuition this is found by him to be the primal real, but also as it seems, because science has prepared the way for him, since his philosophy would raise to a higher power the scientific conception of evolution. But in the search for philosophic truth, is this necessarily the safest beginning ? (I am not here considering intuition, but the basis of scientific theory). Science must abstract. For philosophy it is a matter of life and death to start from a point previous to the abstraction. The new criticism, as I conceive it in the sphere of practice and of thought, would reveal the one as unreal, the other as unintelligible without the assumption that action and thouaht over a great part of experience are, as it were, abstracts of a fuller experience which is seldom reached, anld are therefore fragmentary, requiring for their interpreta- tion to be seen in relation to that comiplete activity, practical and theoretic, which is always creative of value. Such a criticism would be analogous to the idealistic treatmeint of the special sciences or departments of knowledge as having only a relative or partial truth when taken in isolation from the wvhole. But the reality of which, in the conception here advanced, we only experienice in our ordinary life as doers and knowers, a thin abstraction, is the complete movement of a spiritual process rather than that totality which is, in the view of Absolutism, always completed and perfected as eternal, since this itself is lacking in a fundamental quality of the real, its creative process. Mr. F. H. Bradley in the Essays on Truth and Reality comes at times very near to the conception of the practical which appears to be true (though lnot in his use of the words practical and practice), especially when distinguishing his standpoint from that of the Pragmatists, but, as I venture to think. his elaboration of the truth of activity still comes short of its reality, on account of the method which has its starting point in logic.</page><page sequence="11">RELATION OF THE THEORETIC TO THE PRACTICAL ACTIVITY. 143 In the note to the Essay " On Truth and Practice," Mr. Bradley expresses the view that the differenice which exists betweeni practical and non-practical activity is a difference which is not absolute. The merely practical, he insists, would be nothing real. It would be " the miaintenance and alteration of existence in comiiplete abstraction from the quality of existence and the change. Its end would be to produce the greatest quantity of bare doing." And he goes on to point olut that there is no creature out of whose life quiality can be struck as irrelevant. However low you descend, you will reach no stage where the " what" that is sought and done is subordinate to bare doing, and, except as a means to bare doing, is irrelevant. Thus, " on the one hand, no activity is barely practical, there is in the end no activity which exists for its own sake as a process, without any regard for its own nature and quality, and in abstraction from all that ccan be regarded as a prodluct. OIn the other hand, we may say that in the end, all activity is practical. For there is nothinig which is apart froii process and change in existence." That no activity is barely " practical " in the sense intended, is a propositioin with which this paper is entirely in accord, though the practical-as I conceive it-has always a totally different signiificance from that of mere maintenance and alteration of existence. The concession which Mr. Bradley apparently makes to the Pragmatists in allowing the sinalingu out of the notion of mere doing as a bare alteration of existenice with, it seems, as little of value included beyond this as possible-this mere doing being, the most essential elemiient in the " Practical" (even though hardly to be found in ani actual instance devoid of all value)-appears to involve a misconception of the Practical which is more than a matter of terminology, anid is not really consistent with Mr. Bradley's general position. If we turn to the illustrations given, we find that he places in the same class as practical activities:-</page><page sequence="12">144 HILDA D. OAKELEY. (1) The act of digging the ground, which produces an alteration in the " world " for the individual. (2) The set of deeds involved in a moral reformation, which alters his own " existence." (3) That course of action which brings him into co-operation with his fellows, in the development of a social community, a result which becomes an " adjective of our organised existence." And as example of the theoretic is given the intellectual act of apprehension, from mere perception up to imagination, and the products of activity, testhetic, theoretic, which go beyond " practice," as desirable in themselves. Thus the act of percep- tion or imagination of a horse is not practical because it has not brou,ght the horse into existence, nor the contemplation of the ground I have digged-as a good work-" For I can hardly be taken to have altered the ground or myself, and to have given to them a new quality not owned before." And wherever there is a " revelation," there so far we go beyond practice. The underlying assumption in regard to the practical seems to be that it is (as in Pragmatism) essentially the strictly utilitarian, subserving miere life, though Mr. Bradley does insist that no doing can be nothing but this. From the point of view taken in this paper, the line must be drawn between the first example, the act of digging the ground (as here understood, apart from possible transformation by meaning involved), and all the examples which follow. The digging may be an act which is (in the view I am taking) hardly practical at all, because the true will, the person, is not fully engaged in it. In so far as it has any reality it is not a mere change in the world of time and space, it may be a moment in a course of action which is, as a whole, the true expression of personal activity. But the alteration in the individual character, or the organisa- tion of the social community, are real activities because there is in them the quality of creativeness, or the increase of that energy the development of which seems the nearest approach we can conceive to the ultimately real. In the creative factor</page><page sequence="13">RELATION OF THE THEORETIC TO THE PRACTICAL ACTIVITY. 145 we find the meeting point between practical and theoretic. The instances of the typically theoretic given by Mr. Bradley are chosen as showing that the activity has not changed its object -there has been no creation in so far as the change is a revela- tion. " The pursuit of the beautifuil and the true does indeed involve an alteration in personal existence, but this is not the essential character of the activity." Without questioning the significance of the aspect which is here indicated as " revelation," I would urge that all real experience, whether theoretic or practical, is characterised by the quality of creativeness, and that this implies the increase of value, value being that which is primary object of knowledge to the rational and personal consciousness. The theoretic, then, is not to be marked off from the practical as non-creative, for the ideal value which seems to be revealed to the knowing consciousness as eternal is nevertheless there as aspect of the creating movement of that spiritual reality which works through persons. But neither is the practical to be distinguished from the theoretic as devoid of revelation. For every moment of that increase of eneray which is the creation of the practical movement is a re.velation to the doer, who may be said from, the empirical point of view (or as empirically estimated) to be working with forces, the tendency, direction and power of which are beyond his comprehension.* He is, indeed, drawing the infinite into the finite by his action and realising the finite in relation to the infinite in his knowledge. As Signior Benedetto Croce observes, action involves at every moment that infinite possibility becomes actuality, and the standpoint here taken is, I think, in important aspects near to that of his practical philosophy (as presented in * Cf. Croce: "The will becomes will of the unknown -- . . . Our surprise when we come to understand the actions that we have accom- plished is often not small, we realise that we have not done what we thought we had done, and have, on the contrary, done what we had not foreseen."</page><page sequence="14">146 HILDA D. OAKELEY. Mr. Douiglas Ainslie's translation). In attempting to put my view into relation with certain fundamental ideas of Croce (whose work has at least had the effect of an inspiration, upoln my conception of the practical), I would begin by referring to some typical theoretic activities. On what ground can it be aroued that they, in their full reality, are practical in the sense given ? I am thinking of intellectual activity at a higlh level, as in scientjific search, mathematical calculationi, philo- sophic reflection. I do not meani that these are all practical in the exact sense intended by Croce when he says,* "The theoretic man is also practical-he lives, he wills, he acts, like all the others; the so-called practical iian- is also theoretical-he contemplates, believes, thinks." Here the two activities are evidenltly conceived as separate though unite(l in one person. Or again, " Those works that had been assumed to be manifestations of the purely artistic and philosophic spirit are also products of the will, fol without the will nothing can be done." This only shows that the will must be conceived as setting the theoretic process going at that level of reflection at which we separate will fromii thought. Croce's reference to the implication of theoretic elements in the practical seems to come nearer to a suggestion of the true nature of the relation. "Those works that had been lookecl upon as inspired enitirely by the practical spirit, when examined inore closely, are found to be exceedingly complex and rich in theoretic elements-mneditations, reasonings, historical research, ideal contemplation." For in one an.d the same woA7- (not olnly personal consciousness) both elements are here shown to be essential. As I conceive the relation, it is niot only that nio consciousness in our experience can be only theoretic or only practical, but also that no real work of consciousness can be the one without the other-consciousness in personal experienlce does not fully work except in a process which is both theoretic * Philosophy of the Practicad, Section I (i).</page><page sequence="15">RELATION OF THE THEORETIC TO THE PRACTICAL ACTIVITY. 147 and practical, or in reality something prior in nature to the abstract experience of which the-se distinctions are clharacteristic. Take as an example the labours of a Darwin, in the cease- less collection of facts, in the hope of the discovery of an intelligible principle or reasonable muode of connecting these facts. The method is first to bring, before the mind as many facts as possible under the condition of direct observation, actual experience. Then all the gaps are filled in by the scientific imaoination, so that the whole process seems to lie before the mind, as if the time span were enormously extended or the individual able to move over the field of time, as over a field of space, step by step. If this ideal could be realised, the whole series there, as a complete chain of events or stream of clhanges, are we satisfied ? The fundanmental passion for know- ledge of the cause remains. This, if anialysed, becomes the desire to assimilate the whole process to that which is known in the real sense of knowledge, understood as moving in a way intelligible, because akin to the movement of mind. This is the truth of the principle of which all anthropomorphism is the miockery. And this, again, resolves itself into the spiritual niecessity of creativeness. The mind must so comprehend the nature of the moment it grasps as to be able to proceed fron that re-creatively through all the past arid future which the life of that moment requires. It might be possible to show that the usual, if not the essential, origin of error is some loss of this creative element in the theoretic activity, a loss which occurs most frequently through the narrowinig down of the activity, a degradation of its energy towards the level of that bare doing, that mere effort after maintenance of existence, or the utilitarian end which, in Mr. Bradley's estiniate, is the typically practical. Analogous to this is the error of the practical in the more familiar sense. The true significance of the practical genius, the strong decisive will " that knows no doubt, that feels no fear," is in its creative power to move other wills, and so forward the process of increasing energy. But it K</page><page sequence="16">148 HILDA D. OAKELEY. matters very much whether the decision is this way or that; the decision which does not make for progress (as here understood) is an act lamied by abstraction, the vision or insight into the nature of progress, or of the other wills with which the master will has to do, is lacking. These two kinds of defect are essentially one, since that increase of energy which is progress involves the realisation of the true xelations of persons to each other in a development which will enable each and all to act creativelv. But the source of this error is also most generally a degradation of the will towards pursuit of bare existence. Then is the will " sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought," not the true thought which belongs to its real activity, but the false or weakened thinking which would deflect it from its native path. It is only the false practical which discovers for its own needs a false kind of theorising,, by which in the end it is destroyed. Suich is the error of the practical man who is dangerous because "he. thinks too much," though not neces- sarily in Caesar's sense, perhaps in a sense still more fatal to the cause of historic progress. In Croce's philosophy it is clearly shown that the true practical has its own kind of thought, though the action inay seem to take place without thought, becatuse we cannot easily trace the theoretic element by our theoretic methods. His criticism,* however, of the position that "the will is the intelligence itself, that action well conducted is truth," seenis to reveal a standpoint with which I am not in complete agreement. He points out that, "Intellectual light is cold, the will is hot .... With the greatest intellectual clearniess we yet remain inert if something does not intervene that rouses to action." And with reference to the definition of the will as " thought in so far as it is translated into act, . . . or imprinted upon nature," etc., he observes that this "trans- forming, imprintinr, that holding fast, which did not exist in * Section I (1).</page><page sequence="17">RELATION OF THE THEORETIC TO TIlE PRACTICAL ACTIVITY. 149 the simple theory, conceal precisely the will." Hence is practical activity a particular form of the spirit. Here the view I should take would be that both the intellectual liaht which is cold, the intellectual clearness which remains inert, and the " transforming, imprinting, holding fast," in which the essence of will is to be found, when taken apart, suffer from abstraction, and do not containi any moment of the real process in all its completeness. In the Third Section), however, on the Unity of the Theoretic and the Practical, I find very little from which I should differ, and if I understand this part of Croce's Pr-actical Philosophy aright, much that I am endeavour- ing to express may be taken as a commentary upon it. For here this unity is understood in a sense which makes it impossible to state absolutely either that knowledge comes before will and action, or that will is the necessary precedent of knowledge, not merely as a "will to know," but as "a constitutive will, because knowledge is the remaking of a fact, an ideal re-creation of a real creation." And " both in action and thought, man is making himself finite to attaini the infinite." Hence, "all questions as to the primacy of thought or will, the contemplative or the active life, thinker or man of action disappear." To this I should venture to add that the consciousness of reality in personal experience appears to be bound up with the will. It is a kind of spiritual experience wlhich may not be essential to all the experience of spirit, but is certainly so in the experience known to us. The root and original of this consciousness is the effort to pass beyond the condition of the degradation of energy, the resistance to that tendency to weakening which appears as the reduction of practical activity to mere doing, and of knowledge to the thinking which only subserves such doing. Every other form in which the sense of reality takes shape would be a shadow of this original experience. Thus psychology has described the sense of resistance as that which makes us aware of the external K 2</page><page sequence="18">150 HIILDA D. OAKELEY. world. Pure thought, bound uip witli the pure practical activity, would move entirely in a world of value. It is the experience of loss of value which occasions the effort which is will as ordinarily known, the holdina fast, the grip, the affirmation. The sphere of thought which seems pure theory, remote from practice, e.g., in mathematics or philosophy, is always in experience attended by effort of will. Yet in that sphere we know, perhaps, more of the nature of that thought which l elongs to pure activity, the creative act is not concerned primarily with the increase of energy through relations of individuials. It is practical in the largest sense, the creative- ness into which we gain insight is nearest to the original actualisation of the conditions for experienice in space and time. It is, however, rather on the basis of that experience which is conmmonly regarded as practical, and practical in a great, or supremne sense, than on the basis of the experience commonly regarded as theoretic, that it seems best to proceed in an attenipt to estimate the nature of the real process which we partly know in experience. For in the thought which is a part of this practical experienice, though further from that of a pure activity, we are more likely to find the clue to that practical process to which personal consciousness is necessary. The view of practical experieilce involved, or the conception of the proper point of departure, is as far as possible removed from that of Pragmatism. Or as Croce observes of his view of the relation between theory and practice, " from this bond .. is obtained a pragmatism of a new sort, of which the pragmatists have never thouight or at least have not been able to distinguish from the others and to give it value." For the thought, which in Pragmatism is evolved first on account of the necessities of living, and the living to which it is enslaved, are alike mere extracts, broken pieces as it were, of the reality of which thought and practice are aspects. To the understanding of this reality we are more likely</page><page sequence="19">RELATION OF TIIE ThIEORETIC TO THE PRACTICAL ACTlVITY. 151 to approach if we take human historv as our point of departure than if we take conclusions based on the study of life, or of consciousness as oile amongst the special sciences. This is perhaps what Croce mealns by the observation that the summit of kn-owledg,e is "not Art, nor strictly speaking Philosophy, but History, the knowledge of the concrete real, that is the actuality of Philosophy." Life and consciousness are conceived by Pragmatism as in biology and biological psychology; they are not the moving forces of the world of practice as realised in history, and in those moments of con- sciousness in whiclh the individual knows his experience as part of the universal process of history. When the theoretic intelligence is, in separation from the practical, surveying experienice as spread out before it, in different departments, it is necessary for the purposes of that suirvey to contemplate each set of phenomena as though existing and occurring in severalnce from the whole, and, conceiving the whole as complex, to build it up architecturally out of these distinguish- able elements, treated as simple. But stuch a proceduire will not lead us to a philosophy or insigrht into the inoving force of the whole process which is ex hypothesi excluded. In the system of Herbert Spencer we have a leading example of the outcomle of such a procedure. In usinig the word "archi- tecturally," I intend to sig,nify that the process by which the Evolutionary philosophy would explain the place and relation of all the greater realities of human life to the lesser realities which are prior in orig,in (i.e., from the genetic point of view), though described as growth, is not organic-for there is no organic relation between the values when they appear, and those life interests out of which they are supposed to evolve. This fallacy of philosophic reflection arises from the applica- tion of that theorising in accordance with categories which is proper to the consideration of objects in abstraction from the whole-to the whole itself. Analogous to it, and resulting from the same tendency, is the fallacious attempt to find the</page><page sequence="20">152 IIILDA D. OAKELEY. secret of the practical process, in the law of relation between phenoomena arrived at by abstraction of one line in the totality of the movement from the full streanm to which it belonas. Such a line in the activity of the practical is taken when the facts of the development of life are treated as furnishing the key to the nature of the process as a whole. The hope, then, of attaining to a philosophy of the practical lies, as I think, in a treatment of history as our basis, history not in the form to which it is reduced by the scientific intellig,ence, when for special purposes of knowledge it is subjected, as far as possible, to the methods of science, but history prior to this abstraction, as the process of that practical spirit of which we have in ouir own consciousness a more direct kind of kniowledge than in any other subject-nmatter. For however frequently and generally the abstraction may lhave been performed, each person is capable of resolving the parts agnain into the orioinal fulness of the whole, through his own experience, and because this is the one case in which the severance of knower from doer can never be maintainied. We never experience life which is not history, and which we can so divide from the historic process in ourselves (of which taken in its reality life is but a single thread) as to treat it adequately as an object like other objects of science. And when in the grasp of history we realise that it is truer to say that life follows because the forces work-ing through history required this field of experience for their expression, than that out of life, when it had reached a certain degree of complexity, history arose or evolved. History is always with us, but the majority have to be awoken to its actuality by one of those experiences through which we realise that, in our own conscious activity, there is present the universal shown through time. To the presence in the individual of the universal conceived apart from time (or as instance of the timeless), we are more easily aroused. It seemis to require somne world-wide series of events or experiences, which, calling forth the creative</page><page sequence="21">RELATIO.N OF THE THEORETIC TO THE PRACTICAL ACTIVITY. 153 energy of the practical spirit with unusual intensity, draws every individual out of the unreal abstraction of his life into the central movement, to make the ordinary consciousness realise the universal whose differences are the successive ages and successive lives of persons, and to free it from the fallacy of the present, the illusory effect of that vivid experience associated with a special point ill time. OuLr chief leader in idealistic thought at the present time has expressed in emphatic terms his rejection of history in connection with his re-statement of the theory of the Concrete Universal. That the course of reflection indicated in this paper tends to a result so different seems to be due to the following reason:-Whilst the view is accepted that the reality of experience must be sought in the whole, and that it is there- fore the task of philosophy to rethink much of the originally given, the experience of which the complete reality is sought is differently understood. Nothing can exceed the catholicity of Dr. Bosanquet's survey of human experience. Everything has a place in the Absolute. But it has its place as conceived by a reflection, which, in spite of the wealth of sympathy with the practical revealed in almost every page of the two sets of Gifford Lectures, still seems to remain outside the practical, because its point of departure is beyond. In the determina- tion of that basic Hegelian view of logical thlought as reality, was reality itself allowed an equal voice with thought? If this voice had been allowed, would there not have been avoided the sacrifice of that something fundamental to its being with which looical thought cannot deal, viz., the creative process of which time and change are essential elements, not merely phenomena? Plhilosophy, then, it would seem, cannot seek or find a completed totality, because the factor which involves incompleteness is incapable of transformation. If the truth of practice can be found, it will not be found by taking as the ideal, however qualified, the abiding object of the theoretic understanding. No manipulation of experience will restore</page><page sequence="22">154 HILDA D. OAKELEY. to it that actuality which it loses when the attemipt is made to know it as reflecting this type. The thought which is a part of this actuality will certainly express it at every stage of the creative movement, in static forms, but the universals whichl these reveal are all subordinate to the universal of the movement. And this can never be fully stated, because its differences are only known as acted, consciousness beiilg olne in knowing and doing. History, then, is the starting-point, not as *"a reality consistinog in the fragmentary diorama of finite life-processes, unrolling themselves in time, seen fromli the outside, a tissue of mere conjunctions-and yet not given, because a mere construction on the basis of the present," or as " a hybrid experienice," " a doubtful story of successive events." This survey of history is a contemplation of it as object for arn independent or detached subject. It is as though man were surveying the history of the amoeba, or perhaps an intelligent horse the battle in which he falls on behalf of man's i(leal of freedom or civilisation. The history which-it is here urged-when futlly interpreted, with all its implications revealed, would be the ante-room of philosophy, is that process into which the conscious being has an insight, because it comes to pass through the creative action of a consciousness which works through him, as through all persons. It is this character of consciousness as universal which is the ground of the universalisinig mode of thought, thought being an activity of consciousness. The difficulty, then of L'Evolu,tion Cr&amp;atrice, that error is introduced by this mode, would seem to vanish, or to present a less formidable obstacle to the comprehension of the real. Thought does not necessarily in transforming overmuch deform. The truth-giving activity of thought is, however, that which never rests in any one universal, nor even in the whole of universals, but is cease- lessly creative of fresh universals in relation to the practical * The Principle of Individuality and Value, Section II.</page><page sequence="23">RELATION OF THE THEORETIC TO THE PRACTICAL ACTITITY. 155 energy of which it is an inherent accompanimeit. To the same character of the consciousness which is the reality of experience would (on this view) be due the fact that it is at times when individuals are most actively aware of those lesser unities which connect them in some whole, as the unity of a nation, or of a common civilisation brought into being by the energy of many peoples and generations, that they are most capable of an insight into the nature of that creative process in which they are links.</page></plain_text>
