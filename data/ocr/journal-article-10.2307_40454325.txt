The station is situated at 25° s. lat., 118° e. long., in the Murchison area of Western Australia, 84 miles north-east of Meekatharra. The Murchison river bed runs through the southern paddocks of Yarlarweelor. Although I am not academically qualified in agricultural studies, I have always taken an interest in animal breeding ; also while staying at Yarlarweelor I was able to indulge in my other interest, the study of aboriginal art and artefacts. During the first week of my stay, the Forresters, who both know of my interest in anthropology, told me about the engravings to be found at Red Rock on their property. These engravings have long been known locally to exist, but have not, to Mr. Forrester's knowledge, been inspected and photographed by anthropologists. David- son makes no mention of the Red Rock engravings in his report of pictographic and petroglyphic sites in Western Australia, although he x mentions unconfirmed reports of engravings on Birengarra, formerly the southerly neighbour of Yarlarweelor station, but now broken up and incorporated in Yarlarweelor and other neighbouring stations. I was unable to rediscover any traces of these engravings. Thanks to the kindness of the Forrester family, I was able to make many visits to the Red Rock site, where I photographed and measured engravings and collected artefacts in the area. Later in the year, a native stockman "rediscovered" another petro- glyphic site on Yarlarweelor, a group of granite boulders about two miles south of Yadyarra windmill. 1 D. S. Davidson, Proc. American Philosophical Society 96, 1, 1952.</page><page sequence="2">58 Leona Stokoe Amhropos ôí. íosu Fig. I. Topography of Red Rock, Yarlarweelor. The oblong marks near Nos. 4 and 5 indicate sites of rock holes. While staying at Yarlarweelor, I inspected three different sites on the station, and one on a neighbouring station to the north. These sites were all granite outcrops, on which were many and varied engravings. a) Three sites Site number one, Red Rock : The largest outcrop, about five eighths of a mile in perimeter at its base, was one solid mass of granite, eroded in certain areas, mainly flake erosion on the surface. This granite mass, known locally as Red Rock, is situated about 20 miles due north of the station homestead, about a mile and a half west of the Yarlarweelor-Milgun road. There are other outcrops surrounding Red Rock, but none as big or as complete. I found no engravings on these outlying outcrops. There is a semi- permanent spring at Red Rock (Fig. 1), and after rains rockholes on the surface contain water for several weeks. Around the base of the rock is a piece of ground varying in width from about twelve to fifty feet, known locally as a "soak", which becomes very boggy after rains ; beyond this "soak" lies gibber, clothed with mulga, acacia, and other shrubs indigenous to the area. Red Rock itself has many shrubs and trees growing from cracks on its top and sides,</page><page sequence="3">Aboriginal Rock Engravings at Yarlarweelor, Western Australia 59 but the north-eastern section, where the engravings are to be found, is quite bare and exposed to the weather. On one flat section on top of the rock are large boulders, placed on end, whether by natural ór human means is hard to determine. Red Rock is the most important locality as far as engravings are concerned, for they are more numerous and varied in design here. Site number two, Yadyarra: The Yadyarra Outcrop is found in Yadyarra paddock, about 2 y2 miles south of the Yadyarra windmill, that is about 10 miles east-north-east of Red Rock. This site is quite different from Red Rock. Here is a series of small granite boulders scattered in an area of about two hundred and fifty square yards. There are engravings on two groups among these boulders. This outcrop occurs in sparsely timbered gibber country. A sheep "pad", a track made by the sheep following in line across the gibber, wanders through the boulders, connecting the two groups of engravings, and this "pad" was the means of their discovery ; a station stockman was tracking sheep along this "pad" when he noticed the "marks on the rocks". The northern group consists of one large boulder, the largest in the area, surrounded by seven or eight smaller rocks jutting out of the red sand, which covers this area between the gibber. The southern group, twenty-five yards away, consists of several smaller and more broken boulders, with a yandi-like stone at the eastern end where water collects after rain. A yandi is the local native name for a basket, made from wood, often used for carrying young children. Site number three, Divide Outcrop : Eight miles due south of Red Rock, a few feet to the south of the Yaxlarweelor-Milgun road are two smooth granite boulders rising out of red sand ; on the larger of the two, an oval-shaped boulder about six feet by four, engravings are found on the surface. This outcrop is situated in the divide between the Murchison and Gascoyne rivers. b) Situation of engravings at sites Red Rock : All engravings at Red Rock are on a horizontal surface, that is the north-eastern slope of the granite mass. The motifs are small so that when viewed from above, there is no distortion of objects represented as e. g. in the twenty foot long engravings in New South Wales at Brookvale. There were eight different groups of engravings at Red Rock, all on the north- eastern slope ; group one around the spring and water-eroded crack in the rock surface ; group two about thirty yards to the north and about eight feet from the base of the rock ; group three, the most impressive and varied in motif, is situated approximately fifty yards to the north of group two, and again about eight to nine feet from the rock base, these engravings extended over a considerable area, about fifteen or twenty square feet ; group four is found about forty yards further up towards the top of the rock ; group five, the highest found on the rock, is situated near a deep rockhole containing about a foot of water when I inspected the engravings for the first time. This rockhole had not completely dried up at the time of my last visit to Red Rock, although there was only seventy-eight points of rain during my stay at the</page><page sequence="4">60 LEONA StOKOE Anthropos St. 195» station ; thus I feel that this rockhole would provide an adequate alternative supply of water to the semi-permanent spring for visiting aboriginals of the past. I hesitate to call it a natntna-hole, because of its width 2. Group six is found north of group five, on a lower and steeper slope. Groups seven and eight are also on this slope (Fig. 1). As well as these eight main groups of engravings, there are scattered engravings representing one or two objects in the vicinity of the major groups, all on the north-eastern slope of the rock. The rock surface in this area is the most suitable for engravings, as in other areas to the south and the west, the surface is no longer smooth, but deeply pecked and cracked ; erosion has been more pronounced here, as the prevailing winds for most of the year are northwesterlies. Yadyarra : The engravings at Yadyarra are found on both horizontal and vertical surfaces of the boulders, sides and tops being utilized. Animal tracks, both kangaroo and emu tracks, lead to and from the yandi-like rockhole where water collects after rains. This rockhole was dry when I visited the site, and as it is only of shallow depth, any rainwater caught here soon evaporates, for this is an area where evaporation is ten times the rainfall. Animal tracks leading to and from a source of water are a feature of the Yarlarweelor engravings, as they occur at all three sites. Divide : At the Divide site, the engravings are found all over the rock surface, top and sloping sides to within four inches of its base. The technique used to make the engravings in all three localities is similar, an intaglio technique, either pecking with a sharp pointed stone, or pounding with a blunter hammerstone. Natural flaking and scaling of the rock surface has damaged many of the engravings, portion of a snake-like line is missing at Yadyarra, while wind and water erosion has caused many of the engravings to become very faint, merely worn scratches on the surface. However, many of the engravings are distinct, and the pecking has reached almost a centimeter in depth. Many of the representations are easily discer- nible, the lighter colouring where pecking has occurred greatly contrasting with the red of the granite surface. The battering does not show such a great contrast, but is easily discernible as can be seen in the accompanying photographs. c) Subjects of the Yarlarweelor engravings The subjects of the engravings are varied, as in most cases where a large number of rock engravings are found in one area. They can be divided into three groups : 1) Representative 2) Tracks and 3) Abstract designs. 2 A namma-hole is the local native name for a deep hole in rocky surfaces, some- times ten or twelve feet deep, with a very small diameter, less than twelve inches. This hole contains a good supply of water after rains. Many old camps in this area are to be found near namma-holes. There is ample evidence of such a camp near Deep Well windmill, where the namma-hole was carefully covered over by the natives with large stones to conserve water. The rockhole at Red Rock is three feet in diameter.</page><page sequence="5">Aboriginal Rock Engravings at Yarlarweelor, Western Australia 61 The representative group can be further divided into four sub-headings : a) anthropomorphic 6) zoomorphic c) phyllomorphic and d) material objects. As Red Rock was an important initiation ground of the Wanmullah tribe and perhaps of the Coobaroo, I suppose that some of the unidentifiable engravings at this site may represent and refer to differing stages of initiatioln. It is interesting to note that full-blood women, even today when tribes are no longer "wild" in this region, dislike to approach Red Rock. I propose to deal with the second group, that of tracks, first as these are the easiest to identify. Kangaroo tracks of three differing designs are to be found at Red Rock. There is the stylized "acute angles side by side" design, near the spring. Actually there is a series of tracks here, as if the kangaroo was coming along to water, while along the eroded gully are other isolated tracks, some pointing towards the water, some parallel with the stream, others pointing away. These kangaroo track engravings are part of group one at Red Rock. A second design is a design similar to that interpreted by Basedow as a hafted knife 3. See PI. 1, a. However, having seen a deeply indented track in clay of an old stationary kangaroo one afternoon while riding around one of the station paddocks, I am inclined to interpret these engravings as marvellously realistic representations of a kangaroo track, showing the long pointed nail of the kangaroo's foot, with the softer oval-shaped pad behind. The third type of kangaroo track can be seen at the top of PI. 2, 6, where the two "acute angle" marks are separated by a long thick line, probably representing the tail of an animal that has just begun to move along, dragging his tail behind him. At both Red Rock and Yadyarra, kangaroo tracks are found near the source of water, at Yadyarra this is particularly noticeable as kangaroo tracks are the only engravings in the immediate vicinity of the yandi-iike rockhole. At Red Rock there are kangaroo tracks near both rockholes on the north- eastern slopes, as well as those tracks near the spring on the southern side of the rock. There are isolated instances of kangaroo tracks at the Divide site. The second easily identified track is the emu track. There are many emus to be seen on Yarlarweelor station, and I was fortunate to see an excellent series of actual emu tracks along the sandy bed of a creek. It is extremely interesting to compare the actual tracks with those engraved on rock surfaces by aboriginals many years ago. The engravings are very realistic. See PL 1, c for an excellent example. Some of the emu tracks are of a more stylized variety, as the arrow-like representation walking over the top of a vertical boulder at Yadyarra. These particular tracks are heading towards the rockhole, which is situated at the foot of the next boulder. There are emu tracks at all three sites, and this motif was the most often repeated 8 D. S. Davidson, Memoirs American philosophical Soc. 5, 1936, p. 50.</page><page sequence="6">62 Leona Stokoe Anthropos sí. 1959 one. The emu tracks seem to follow one another, one foot, then the other ; while the kangaroo tracks show both feet planted together, as a kangaroo hops or rather bounds along, both hind feet striking the ground at once. Where there are a series of tracks, whether realistic or stylized, the position of the tracks is a real one. The tracks vary in size, some life-size, others smaller, but there were few (I noticed only three), emu or kangaroo tracks at any of the three sites that were larger than life size. A third set of tracks seen at Red Rock and Divide, but not at Yadyarra, were tracks of human feet. Of course these engravings may represent the actual feet, and not tracks at all, but I will deal with them in this section. These tracks differed greatly in size and outline, but they were all battered surface representations. At Divide, human feet tracked up the side and over the top of the sloping boulder, while in PL 1, a at Red Rock, two long thin feet with seven and eight digits respectively march across the upper half of the photograph. These latter are probably a freehand interpretation. The Divide tracks show only four toes. However, quite often it has been discovered that the number of digits portrayed in aboriginal art do not correspond with actuality 4. There was a very interesting possible group at Red Rock (PL 1, c). It is very difficult to group any engravings together without aboriginal interpre- tation, for what may appear to be a logical group to a European mind may not be such to the natives. However, in this area, there are few natives remaining who can interpret these engravings. Mr. Forrester told me that there had been one old native wandering around hunting his own food with spear and boomerang and living as his ancestors had done before the advent of white man. Sometimes the stockmen, searching for sheep in the vast pad- docks, would come across the ashes of his fire, and the blackened bones of a roasted kangaroo, but it was rarely that they saw the aboriginal himself, or even his foot tracks. Had we been able to persuade this man to come to Red Rock, he might have been able to interpret the engravings there, but certainly the mission-trained natives know nothing of their meaning. And now this last "wild" man seems to have vanished. However, this group seen in PL 2, b may well be one entity, as the three engravings seem to have been pecked and battered at the same time ; there is another object at the top left of the photograph which is much fainter, and does not seem to have any relation to the main group, which consists of two human feet tracks, or feet, both with five toes, one either side of a third engraving that may represent a human figure. It is unlikely that this third engraving is that of a lizard, or bungarra, as all varieties of lizard are called locally, as there is no tail, although stumpy-tailed lizards are prevalent in this region. Yet the head is dissimilar in shape from that of other lizards portrayed at Red Rock, see PL 1, bf where the lizard has a much longer neck, while the figure between the two feet has hardly any neck at all. The hind legs of the central figure have four toes on the left foot and three on the right ; 4 Cf. L. Adam, Polydactyly in Australian Art. Man 51, 1951, Ant. 80.</page><page sequence="7">Aboriginal Rock Engravings at Yarlarweelor, Western Australia 63 there are no digits represented on the forearms, which are raised above the head in a conventionalized dancing posture. Measurements are as follows : Left foot : 19 cm. in length 3 x/4 cm. width across the heel 7 y2 cm. width across the toes Right foot : 23 cm. in length 3 y2 cm. width across the heel 10 cm. width across the toes Central figure : 39 % cm- overall length 19 y2 cm. width across arms 7 cm. width of body 25 y2 cm. length of body 5 cm. length of head Fig. 2. Snake-like line This central figure is possibly that of a male human being ; it is unlikely that a female figure would be portrayed at an initiation ground, and sexual indications point to a male. The position of the figure departs from the conventionalized dancing form, in that the legs are not bent but are straight ; in fact the position of the figure resembles that of an animal skin "pegged out" to dry. This group of engravings shows the objects represented from above, as though one is looking down on a ground plan. This is not a unique position in aboriginal art ; Davidson gives an example from Central Australia of an emu sitting on a nest of eggs executed in this same ground plan style ; the bird is represented by two tracks, one each side of a group of eggs 5. To try and interpret the group at Red Rock without sufficient knowledge of local tribal practices is inconclusive, but one is often tempted to base a conjecture on native interpretations of similar motifs elsewhere, whether in the same or in different groupings. The Red Rock group could represent a young initiate lying on the ground with an older man, symbolized by the feet so much larger in proportion, standing over him. This is a feasible interpretation to the European mind, but to the aboriginal, by whom and for whom the engraving was made, it probably has a very different meaning. Actually this group may well have been discussed under the repre- sentative heading in the anthropomorphic section, to which I will now turn for discussion of some other rock engravings found on Yarlarweelor station. The most prevalent anthropomorphic representation at Red Rock and Divide is the human hand. There were no hands at Yadyarra. But both left and right hands are portrayed at Red Rock. The hands vary in shape and size, some long and slender, others squat and broad. Some hands have six » D. S. Davidson, Proc. American philosophic Soc. 5, 1936, p. 100.</page><page sequence="8">64 LEONA StOKOE Anthropos 54. 1959 fingerb, one has seven, another eight. PI. 1, a, also at Red Rock, shows con- trasting styles side by side, a small thin palm with six extraordinarily long fingers, and immediately at the fingertips of this hand is another of far different proportions, a large broad palm with five short fingers. At the Divide site, there are three claw-like hands stretching across the boulder's eastern slope (PI. 3, b). There is one engraving at Red Rock (PL 1, a), that may be classed in this section, if one interprets it as an unfinished representation of a human head, full face. It is a circle with short straight lines (representing hair ?) radiating from the top. The centre of the circle has crude smudged battering in a very rough triangular shape in the bottom half of the circle ; this may be a nose and mouth, or it may be another engraving superimposed on the circle and straight lines. The circle has a diameter of nearly 15 cm., the length of the longest line (the lines are almost parallel) is 17 cm. There are ten lines emanating from the circle's perimeter. But this may not be an anthropomorphic representation at all, it may be an abstract design, perhaps concerned with the initiation ceremonies that formerly took place at Red Rock. There have been no ceremonies here for the past thirty years, as far as the station people can tell. d) Zoomorphic representations The most common zoomorphic representation at Red Rock was not the snake, but the lizard. There were twenty-seven complete and incomplete, distinct and indistinct engravings of lizards, to be found in groups three, six, seven and eight on the north-eastern rock face. PI. 2, b shows an excellent example, where a large lizard almost nullifies the tiny headless lizard near his right foreleg. This smaller lizard is just a little longer in its entirety than the foreleg of the larger reptile. The lizards also vary in shape, perhaps to show different species in the district, or perhaps this is the differing freehand interpretation of the aboriginal artists. The bodies of the lizards differ in shape, some almost round, others quite oval-shaped ; their legs are of different length, while one lizard has claws or nails appended to both hind and forelegs. Snakes or snake tracks were found at all three localities. At Yadyarra a snake-like line has a prominent position on the large boulder of the first and lesser group. (Fig. 2). It faces the west. The snake measures 125 cm. in length from the head (?) to where a flaking of the rock surface has destroyed part of the engraving. The width varies, at some places it reaches one centimeter. The head or top of the engraving is interesting. There are two outlines of oval shape joined together where the body of the snake begins, this head portion measures almost four centimeters in length and width. There is a similar outline representation at Divide (see PI. 3, b), but here the head part of the engraving is much larger in proportion than the one at Yadyarra, and the two oval shapes are not as distinctly pecked in the rock. The tail of the snake at Divide is much straighter than the one at Yadyarra. There are some meander- ing lines at Red Rock with an open circle at one end (a snake coming out of a hole ?), and others where there is a short spiral before the line continues a winding track along the rock surface (a coiled snake striking ?).</page><page sequence="9">Ä 2 u CO « &amp; 2 bp W tf "3 g 'Sb 'S h" o CD O w a (2 Top 1 •s i&gt; tf | a. ä) ex G *5* ¿ s *2 a. s u i 3 a. &lt;î Anthropo« 54. 1959</page><page sequence="10">.2 I &lt; I OS i i 3 4-» co I l o tf C !&amp; O u o I o í 1 Vi O "S 'Õ G ¡ a* I so 'õ o, ¿4 I 3 'S 3 u N "o 3" &lt;o ^) c Anthropos 54. 1959</page><page sequence="11">Plate 3 Leona Stokoe, Aboriginal Rock Engravings at Yarlarweelor, Western Australia Close-up of group (Vadyarra) Close-up of Divide Close-up of figure and half circle (Red Rock) Top c Top b Top a</page><page sequence="12">Aboriginal Rock Engravings at Yarlarweelor, Western Australia 65 PI. 2, c shows what may well be a representation of a frilled lizard which has been disturbed and has its neck frill ruffled to the full, shown by the four lines to the left and the five lines to the right of neck and head. These lines are joined on to the neck, which is extra long on this particular engraving, almost as long as the body. e) Phyllomorphic representations There were two possible engravings that could be said to have phyllo- morphic motifs. Both are found at Red Rock, and the most interesting is found only at Red Rock, and there was only one example (PL 1, c), whereas the star-like engraving, which may represent the white everlasting flowers of the area, a small dot with seven radiating lines about two to three centi- meters long. This engraving is very like the white flowers, except for the irregular length of the "petals". But the most interesting motif under the phyllomorphic heading is a leaf-like representation at Red Rock (PI. 1, c). The measurements are : length : 40 cm. from projecting tip to top, width : 34 % cm- across greatest width. There is another interpretation that could be given to this engraving, and that is that it represents a tortoise shell, the projecting tip being the tortoise head just emerging from its shell. There are small tortoises to be found near the creeks in this region after a heavy rainstorm, and one must remember that most of the foliage in this desert area is not broad-leafed as indicated by this engraving if we accept it as a phyllomorphic representation, but needle-like leaves prevail in order to present as little surface area as possible to the high evaporation rate. The cogla vine, indigenous to the area, has a broader leaf than most of the plants, but its leaves are quite a different shape, broad at the base and curving to a gentle point. However, the radial lines in the engraving strongly suggest the veins of a leaf, while the projecting end could be the stalk. /) Representations of material objects These included star-like representations that may be intended for the sun, boomerang-shaped engravings, and large oval shapes, possibly representing shields. Some of the latter have irregular markings, seemingly of the same age, in the centres of the oval. These engravings were found only at Red Rock, and mainly in the third group on the rock face. One oval measured over 200 centimeters, and this was the largest engraving that I saw at Yarlarweelor. g) Abstract designs among rock engravings at Yarlarweelor As one may expect there are many abstract designs to be found at Red Rock, the old initiation ground. Two of these designs were also painted on the bodies of men during the initiation ceremonies, according to the report of an old initiated native stockman who worked at Yarlarweelor under the present station manager's father. These two designs were the series of half- Anthropos 54. 1959 5</page><page sequence="13">66 LEONA StOKOE Anthropos 54 . 1959 circles (see PL 2, a), and the whorl-like design seen at the top centre of the same photograph, overlapping another engraving. The old native was very reticent to give further details of the ceremonies or meanings of other designs when pressed to do so by the station manager. There is a similar design to the half circles painted at Walga Rock in the same district 6. PI. 1, « shows an interesting engraving among a group at Red Rock, the fourth group on the rock face. A vertical line is crossed by five horizontal lines of similar length. These lines are deeply and carefully pecked in the rock. The vertical line extends about 12 cm. before the first horizontal line crosses it, then the five horizontal lines cross the vertical at about 6 cm. intervals. Around the projecting end there is a more lightly pecked battering, which extends between the deep lines, forming a rough rectangle about the horizontal lines, something like a child's drawing of a tree with heavily marked branches and trunk and lighter marked foliage. There is a similar design to the heavily pecked outline painted on the ceiling at the Ooraminna waterhole cave in Central Australia 7. At Red Rock, the stick-like figure with arms, a head, but no legs, merely the body continued to tail, is similar to a painting at Walga Rock, which Davidson has interpreted as a lizard silhouette 9. The Red Rock engraving has a faint but definite circle around the head of the lizard, suggestive of a halo. Davidson does not report this extra circle at Walga Rock, but it may well be merely an overlapping design at Red Rock and have nothing to do with the lizard silhouette at all. At Yadyarra I found a very interesting but unidentifiable design (PL 3, c). Seven straight lines running from a point form an almost solid triangle with a 6 y2 cm. base. This base joins a thick straight line about 6 cm. long. This line merges with another triangle at right angles to it. This triangle, too, is made up of deeply pecked lines, but they are not as definite as the lines in the first triangle. The base which is curved is also about 6 y2 cm. in length. Almost immediately the base of this triangle joins the top of a third, which shows a battered surface and not the pecked lines. This is the largest of the three, measuring 10 cm. across the base. Just near this design lies a simple "star" with two five-pronged "crowns" resting on two different points of the star, which has six points. A feature of the Yadyarra engravings is the number of "mazes" or single lines meandering all over and crossing at will, and covering a considerable portion of one boulder's surface. At Divide there is a squiggly line reminiscent of a child's attempt to draw a bird in flight. Another abstract design found at Red Rock is the intaglioed outlines of a half-circle. This figure measuring 11 cm. by 19 y2 cm. may have been a somewhat irregular circle, but there has been damaging erosion here and 6 D. S. Davidson, Proc. American Philosophical Soc. 1, 1952, fig. 8, p. 86. 7 I photographed this design at Ooraminna while on a Melbourne University expedition led by Dr. Leonhard Adam. 9 D.S.Davidson, Proc. American Philosophical Soc. 1, 1952, fig. 13.</page><page sequence="14">Aboriginal Rock Engravings at Yarlarweelor, Western Australia 67 quite a large piece of granite has flaked off the surface, carrying part of this engraving with it. Near this damaged half circle are two other engravings (see PI. 3, a), the larger of which may represent a human figure (male). This figure, in a dancing position, has a suggestion of hair or headdress on the head, while there are three fingers on one hand and four on the other. There are no digits on the feet. The figure measures 27 y2 cm. in overall length, 16 % cm. across the outstretched arms, and 12 3/4 cm. across the outstretched feet. The third object in this group is more difficult to interpret. A stylized kangaroo ? Rather a stumpy tail for this animal. If one added corresponding lines to the near horizontal offshoots of the vertical stem, joined all ends, leaving a protruding point at the bottom, one would have a representation similar to the one portrayed in PL 3, a. Other abstract motifs include barred circles (Yadyarra, Red Rock), with and without tails; bifurcated figures, perhaps phallic symbols (all three localities) similar to those mentioned by Davidson found at several other West Australian sites including Willow Gully, Walga Rock (pictographs), Gifford Creek and Port Hedland (petroglyphs) 10, "trident-like" designs at Red Rock, and circle outlines. Several local station owners and managers told me of having seen engravings at some time on their properties, but many of these sites were either forgotten, or were in inaccessible areas. I did discover one other site, while riding the 100 miles to the north to the racecourse. This site, again a red granite outcrop, is situated south of the Yarlarweelor-Mt. Clere road half a mile beyond the 40 mile windmill on Milgun station. The engravings found here were very old and weathered. Owing to insufficient time, I cannot say how many engravings may be present here. The ones we saw had been badly damaged by wind and sand erosion. The technique was intaglio, and the main distinguishable motifs included emu tracks near a dried-up semi-permanent spring, snakes, and a very worn lizard, too faint to reproduce in a photograph. There were many artefacts found in the immediate vicinity, suggesting that this had been a favoured camping spot. These artefacts included scrapers, knife blades (broken), spear heads (broken), pieces of digging sticks and small grinders. The best piece collected was a very large grinding stone, measuring 42 y2 cm. in width, 48 cm. in length and 2 % cm. in depth. There have been two narrow grooves worn on one side of the stone, the largest about 31 cm. long, and one groove worn to a depth of 1 */4 cm. on the other side. The grooves run diagonally across the oblong stone. This grinder was hidden between the vertical walls of two large boulders, not far from the emu track engravings and the spring. In concluding this paper, I would like to' express my deepest thanks to Dr. Leonhard Adam without whose help and encouragement it would never have been written, and also to Ross and Shirley Forrester who have given so much of their valuable time in order that I might inspect and photograph the rock engravings at Yarlarweelor. 10 D.
