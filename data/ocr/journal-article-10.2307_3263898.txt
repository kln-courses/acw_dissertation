We cannot often tell whether the figures represent deities or humans, or if indeed such distinctions were intended. But by the late fourth and early third millennia B.C., background sce- nery or physical attributes and activities were included that can sometimes help us to distinguish gods from men. It is difficult, however, to tell an ordinary citizen-a priest or a worshiper, for example-from a ruler. In the course of the third millennium B.C. various Near Eastern states were engaged in organized trade and imperial conquest, and then, politically and eco- nomically secure, their rulers began to have themselves portrayed unambigu- ously and sometimes with inscriptions. They were depicted performing secular, military, and religious functions, and the forms employed were statuary in the round or carvings on cylinder seals and reliefs, usually in stone. The figures reproduced here are clearly rulers, identified as such either by inscrip- tions or their regal characteristics. Possi- bly the earliest is the heavy, almost solid-cast head (fig. 1), masterfully and subtly executed to indicate calm dignity and inherent power. The heavy-lidded eyes, the prominent but not overlarge nose, the full-lipped mouth, and the intri- cately coiffed beard are all so carefully and skillfully modeled that the head may well be a portrait, almost certainly of a ruler. If this is a portrait, then the head is unique among Near Eastern artifacts. Some scholars date it to the second millennium B.C., others to the late third millennium B.C., which, considering the style, seems more likely. The maker and the date of the piece remain unknown, as does the identity of this king, whose representation, mute and nameless, nev- ertheless remains one of the great works of ancient art. The seated stone figure (fig. 2) repre- sents Gudea (2144-2124 B.C.), the ensi, or governor, of the ancient Sumerian state of Lagash, whose name and title are included in the long inscription. A number of stone statues of Gudea, seated or standing, were excavated at Tello (ancient Girsu), in southern Mesopotamia, while others, presumably from Tello, sur- faced on the art market; many from both sources are fragmented, lacking heads or bodies. The Museum's Gudea is com- plete and depicts the ruler characteristi- cally dressed in a brimmed hat decorated with hairlike spirals and a long garment 2 that leaves one shoulder bare. His hands 7</page><page sequence="6">are clasped in prayer-appropriately so, for the inscription informs us that the statue was placed in a temple to represent Gudea in supplication before the gods. The Museum also possesses a stone head, which was joined to a body in the Louvre, of Ur-Ningirsu, the son of Gudea; the complete statue (fig. 69) is exhibited at the Metropolitan and the Louvre in alternating three-year periods. During the first millennium B.C. Assyrian and Persian Achaemenid kings ruled many nations and peoples. They were masters of political propaganda, which was expressed in numerous texts and in various forms of art. The Assyrian pal- aces were embellished with stone wall reliefs (see inside covers) depicting royal activities in war, the hunt, and domestic and religious ceremonies. On the illus- trated relief from Nimrud (fig. 3), the king Assurnasirpal 11 (883-859 B.C.) holds a bow -a symbol of his authority-and a ceremonial bowl. Facing him, an atten- dant holds a fly whisk and a ladle for replenishing the royal vessel. The peace- ful, perhaps religious, nature of the scene is reflected in the calm, dignified compo- sure of the figures. The Achaemenid kings (550-331 B.C.) employed the political and artistic iconog- 3 raphy of earlier periods. Although warlike activities do not appear on their palace reliefs, the Persian kings did represent themselves on cylinder seals vanquishing enemies. On the seal at the lower left (fig. 4) an Achaemenid king holds a bow, again a symbol of authority, and thrusts his spear into a soldier, identified as Greek by his helmet and clothing. The naturalism of the carving and details suggests that the artist was either a Greek working for the Per- sians or a Persian trained in the West. The Persian Sasanians (third to sev- enth century A.D.) considered themselves the spiritual and political heirs to the Achaemenid kings. Representations of Sasanian rulers appear on coins, vessels, and rock reliefs, and in stucco busts. On the coins each king is named by an inscription and wears a personalized 4 crown, which usually helps to identify other, uninscribed portraits. Unfortunately, this is not the case with the Museum's slightly under-life-size head (fig. 5), which was hammered from a single piece of silver. Because of slight variations in the crown and the presence of the striated globe headdress, we can infer that he was a fourth-century king, whose con- trolled fierceness characterizes a pos- ture depicted for millennia. We do not know the function of the piece, but it is a rare example of a Sasanian king por- trayed in the round.

The collapse of successive mud- brick walls gradually led to the formation of mounds, which mark the sites of human occupation in the Near East (see figs. 44, 49, 51). Because stone is rare in south- ern Mesopotamia, mud brick and reeds were used to fashion structures. Wood was also generally lacking in the south, where the only common tree was the date palm (see figs. 4, 39). In Syria and Anatolia, however, wood formed an inte- gral part of all large structures. On a clay cult tower probably made in Syria (see fig. 22), sizable wooden beams are repre- sented between the two stories and in the framework of the building. The walls and doorways of most impor- tant royal and cult buildings were embel- lished with different materials, stone, metal, and painted plaster. Clay bricks molded into figural and plant forms first appear as a type of decoration in architec- ture of the second millennium B.C. in Mesopotamia and Syria. Some of the most impressive examples of molded bricks come from the city of Babylon. The walls of gateways, the royal build- ings, and a long processional road, built during the reign of Nebuchadnezzar II (604-562 B.C.), were faced with molded bricks covered with yellow, blue, black, 7 lgSIBW Iwhite, and red glazes. The lions (see fig. 11</page><page sequence="10">9 9), symbols of Ishtar, the great Mesopota- mian goddess of love and war (see fig. 27), are from the walls of the proces- sional road leading to the Bit Akitu, or house of the New Year's Festival (see p. 23). The Babylonian taste for molded and glazed bricks spread to Iran, and in the Achaemenid period (550-331 B.C.) the walls of the palaces at Susa had brightly colored glazed surfaces. The most familiar Achaemenid architecture, however, is at the site of Persepolis, in southwestern Iran. Many of the stone sculptures decorating the entrance gates, stairs, and walls of the royal buildings still stand, but the mud bricks that formed the walls of these buildings have long since crumbled away. Some of the halls at Persepolis had huge stone columns over sixty feet high. On the tops of these columns and the capitals surmounting them, impost blocks held the wooden ceiling beams. These blocks were carved to represent the foreparts of various animals: griffins, bulls, and human-headed bulls. The head of a bull (fig. 6) in the Museum's collection is part of one of these blocks and combines realistic and decorative forms in the typical style of the Achaemenid royal workshops. The ani- mal's ears and horns, now lost, were made from separate pieces of stone. Royal and cult buildings were con- structed with considerable care and deliberation. The ground chosen for tem- 12</page><page sequence="11">pie buildings was cleared before construc- tion and the soil specially prepared. One customary practice, dating from as early as the mid-third millennium B.C., was the burial of foundation figures at selected points beneath the temple. A nude male figure supporting a box (fig. 7) may have originally served this purpose. Founda- tion figures often end in a tapered nail- like form so that, in a sense, they secure the building in place. This is true of many Sumerian figures (see fig. 45) and of a particularly striking example (see fig. 35), probably from northern Mesopotamia, topped with a snarling lion. The conquest of the Near Eastern lands in the fourth century B.C. by the Greek ruler Alexander of Macedon brought foreign craftsmen in consider- able numbers to the Near East, and the architecture soon reflected their presence. Stone was used more frequently for build- ings of importance, and Greek capitals, columns, and moldings began to trans- form the appearance of buildings. A bearded male head of Parthian date (first to second century A.D.) provides evi- dence of western influence in the rather realistic style and the function of the piece as a waterspout (fig. 8). The person portrayed, however, has the moustache, long, loose locks of hair, and prominent nose of a Near Easterner, probably an Iranian. The head was originally glazed, and the beard still retains traces of iron pyrites.

Ores producing silver exist in Iran, and silver was brought back from Anatolia by merchants from north- ern Mesopotamia (Assyria) in the early second millennium B.C. Gold came to Mesopotamia from a variety of sources, including the Taurus and Caucasus moun- tains in the northwest and Egypt in the southwest. Texts also record the ship- ment of gold from the Indus coastline (Meluhha) in the east. Some of the most spectacular and earliest objects in gold come from the Royal Cemetery at Ur (ca. 2500 B.C.) in Mesopotamia (see fig. 66). Neither gold nor silver is native to Mesopotamia, and the appearance of these materials indi- cates that an effective system of trade had developed by this time. Slightly later in date than the objects discovered at Ur are gold vessels found in royal tombs in north-central Anatolia. A ewer made of hammered gold (fig. 10) originally had a long spout that projected from the narrow neck. During the second millennium B.C. spouted jugs became ex- tremely elaborate and elegant in form. A representation of a cult scene on a Hittite cup (see back cover) shows one of these jugs in use at a ceremony where a liquid offering is being poured out before a god. One vessel type that had a long history in the ancient Near East incorporates the head or forepart of an animal. A spectacu- lar example (see front cover) comes from Anatolia and was made during the peri- od of Hittite rule (fifteenth to thirteenth century B.C.). The handled cup is in the shape of the forepart of a recumbent stag, an animal commonly represented in the art of Anatolia and associated with a stag god, who can be seen on the band en- circling the neck of the vessel (see back cover). The meaning of this cult scene is ~11 ~ uncertain, but the association of certain animal-shaped vessels with particular divinities is described in Hittite texts. Religious or cult scenes of the type found on the Hittite cup are unknown on later vessels of gold or silver that are preserved from the period of Achaemenid rule in Iran. In general, the decoration of these works of art is fairly simple. Bodies are often fluted and decorated with egg- shaped bosses (see fig. 72), designs that appear on Near Eastern ceramics and metalwork in the second and early first millennia B.C. Stylized plant motifs in- clude lotuses, palmettes, and rosettes. An Achaemenid cup made of silver is in the shape of a horse's head (fig. 12). The bridle and the file of birds around the 15</page><page sequence="14">neck are covered with gold foil. This combination of gold and silver was commonly used on metalwork of the Achaemenid period, and the fashion con- tinued on later works of Parthian and Sasanian date. Another Achaemenid vessel (fig. 14) ends in the forepart of a lion. The mouth of the lion is open, and in characteristic Near Eastern fashion the tongue pro- trudes from between the teeth. The ves- sel is made of seven different parts, almost invisibly joined. A gilded silver rhyton (fig. 13), horn- shaped and having a small spout for pouring, dates from the Parthian period (ca. first century B.C.) and is much influ- enced, in form and style, by the art of the late Hellenistic West. The panther wears a grape-and-leaf vine wound around its chest, and an ivy wreath encircles the rim of the vessel. These motifs are symbols of the Greek wine god Dionysos, whose cult spread eastward at the time of the invasion of Alexander the Great in the late fourth century B.C. Dionysiac images -panthers, grapevines, and dancing fe- males (see fig. 26)- continue to appear on the silverware of the Sasanian period (A.D. 226-651). On an oval bowl (see fig. 11) dating from the end of this period a curling grapevine scroll is populated with birds and animals and frames a small male figure, bearded and partially nude. The vine scroll and the nude male figure (an unusual subject in Sasanian art) reflect the influence of Dionysiac imagery. The significance of the Dionysiac motifs in Iranian art is unknown. They are com- mon on silverware of late Sasanian date and, during that period, may have re- ferred to Iranian court festivals rather than to specific Dionysiac cult practices. Although royal images do not appear on the gold and silver vessels that have survived from the Achaemenid period, names of kings were inscribed on some examples around the rim (see fig. 72). On later vessels, notably those of the Sasanian period, there are no royal inscrip- tions but the king himself is represented, usually in a hunting scene (see fig. 63). Silver-gilt plates decorated in this fashion were probably intended as gifts for neigh- boring rulers or for members of the king's own court. Ancient texts state that goldsmiths fash- ioned not only vessels but also statues of kings and divinities and many small ob- jects, such as jewelry and other decora- tions for the clothing of the king and god. Only a small number of these treasured objects have survived, but the remains provide a glimpse of the luxury wares that were used at the royal court and dedi- cated by rulers to their gods. P.O.H.

They were initially made of stone and probably wood, and as soon as metallurgy was exploited, they were fashioned of copper, then bronze, and later iron. Our knowledge of weapons and their use in war and the hunt is based on finds from cemeteries, settlements, and on representations. Sennacherib, king of Assyria (704-681 B.C.), was frequently at war with his neighbors, and his palace walls at Nineveh were lined with stone reliefs depicting his victories. Many of the battle scenes are bloody and dramatic; others, like the Museum's fragmentary example (fig. 15), illustrate troops on the march. Here two cavalry soldiers are shown wearing hel- mets, armor, and boots; they carry spears, swords, and bows for both close- and long-range combat. Because of the rough terrain-mountains and a spring-the soldiers walk their horses, an example of Assyrian concern for verisimilitude. The horses wear tassels, for decoration, and bells, to create a terrifying noise during charges. The reliefs not only inform us of historical events, but they also yield docu- mentation of contemporary artifacts-in this case, weapons, clothing, and eques- trian paraphernalia. Archaeological finds often match items depicted on the reliefs, which play an important role in dating and attribution. Although approximately eighty exam- ples of iron swords like the Museum's (fig. 16) are known, not one is repre- sented in art or has been excavated by archaeologists. Fortunately the culture and general time of their manufacture are revealed by stylistic analysis of both the figures and the blade shape. The two bearded male heads that project from the pommel and the crouching lions on either side of the ricasso resemble Luristan styles from the late eighth and early seventh centuries B.C., and the willow-leaf blade is paralleled on plain swords exca- vated from Luristan tombs of the same period. The placement of the blade at right angles to the hilt and the complex method of construction make this class of sword unique. Each sword was individually hand-forged and consists of about ten separate pieces neatly joined to give the impression that the sword was cast in one piece. Why these swords were so painstakingly made is unknown, but the large number suggests that they may have signaled the special rank of their bearers. Identical in form, they were probably manufactured in one place. The sword with a gilt bronze guard and a hollow gold hilt (fig. 17) is more difficult to attribute to a specific area. The iron blade (not shown) is preserved in a gold scabbard decorated with a stamped or punched feather pattern on the obverse and with five pairs of spiral wires on the reverse. The hilt and the two mounts with P-shaped flanges are decorated with granulations and garnet and glass inlays. These mounts held leather straps that allowed the sword to hang from a belt for a "quick draw." More than a half-dozen other exam- ples of this form of sword and scabbard are known, but none are so elaborately decorated; a few are also represented in art. The double P-shaped mounts are found on swords recovered from Europe to the Eurasian steppes, including Iran, and are associated with the nomadic Turkish- speaking Avars of the sixth and seventh centuries A.D. A rock relief at Taq-i Bustan in Iran provides the only known example of a Sasanian king wearing a similar sword and mounting; other repre- sentations of Sasanian swords depict a different form of attachment. Therefore, we cannot be certain whether our sword was once in the armory of a Sasanian king, or whether it and its mates were once in the possession of an Avar chief. O.W.M. 15 18</page><page sequence="17">16 17 19</page><page sequence="18">The peoples of the Near Ea like those of other cultures, preoccupied with the world ( eternally mysterious spiritual demonic forces. Their artisti impulses were largely expre, in conceptualizing and doci menting their manifold beliefs, interpreta- tions, and fears. Ancient Near Eastern art and textual material eloquently reveal how over the millennia these people re- solved their need to relate to and placate the ever-present spirits and deities that manifested themselves in nature and in daily life. The gold necklace (fig. 19) is a good example of how decorative and spiritual functions were often combined. It is com- posed of double and triple strands of st, hollow beads with seven pendants, each were in the form of a deity or a symbol of a of deity. Although apparently complete, the I and reconstruction of the more than two hun- ic dred pieces is modern, so the original ssed position of each element is not absolutely J- certain. The two horned females in long flounced dresses most probably repre- sent Lama, a protective goddess; the central disk with rays emanating from a boss represents Shamash, the sun god; the crescent, the moon god, Sin; and the forked lightning symbol, probably Adad, the storm god. The two disks with granu- lated rosettes may be purely decorative. While no other elaborate example exists in complete form, wall reliefs depict Assyrian kings of the first millennium B.C. wearing necklaces like this one with pen- dant divine symbols, indicating that they were to be worn by royalty. The necklace was most probably apotropaic-that is, it protected the royal wearer from harm. Similar individual elements excavated at Larsa in Mesopotamia lead us to assume that this necklace was made in the early 19 20</page><page sequence="19">second millennium B.C., and as Assyrian examples attest, necklaces with apo- tropaic features had a long history in the region. The bronze helmet (fig. 20) with four raised figures prominently positioned on its front had apotropaic value in addition to its immediate practical function. Each of the figures was sculpted from a bitu- men core overlaid with silver and gold and then fastened to a bronze plate riv- eted to the helmet. In the central position is a bearded male deity, identified as a mountain-water god by the scales on a conical background and the water flowing from the vessel he holds. He is flanked by two identical goddesses and protected from above by a giant raptor. The goddesses hold their hands open in rever- ence before their breasts. They, too, are placed against backgrounds with scales, which suggests that they may be moun- tain deities associated with the male god, who is probably dominant since his crown has multiple pairs of horns while theirs have only single pairs. Because of the style and deportment of the figures depicted, and the special technique of manufacture, the helmet may be attrib- uted to the Elamites of the fourteenth century B.C. That our helmet was worn by a person of rank is suggested by the precious material used and the complex- ity of the construction. Its symbolic and spiritually protective value is implied by the presence of the deities in such a prom- inent and charged position. The Neo-Assyrian cylinder seal (fig. 18) depicts a religious scene commonly found on these ubiquitous objects. A human worshiper is in reverence before the storm god Adad, who stands on a bull, the animal usually associated with him. A bull-man, one of many mixed- creature spirits depicted by ancient Near Easterners, appears in attendance be- hind Adad, and various symbols of other deities-the standards of Marduk and Nabu, the seven dots representing the Pleiades, and the winged sun disk-are distributed unobtrusively throughout the scene, which interestingly mixes the anthropomorphic forms of the gods and their symbols. While the owner probably used this device to seal documents and cargo, he no doubt also carried it as his personal talisman and sign of piety. O.W.M. 21</page><page sequence="20">In Mesopotamia man's relationship with his gods was not the personal and imme- diate one of many modern believers. Instead, it was distant and formal, de- fined essentially through the perfor- mance of elaborate rituals. Ancient man's primary function on earth was to serve the gods, whose decisions and actions determined the outcome of all events and mankind's ultimate fate. It seems that the common man was excluded from all but the major religious festivals; in most rituals participation was the privilege and the responsibility of priests and, most important, of the king. These rites are not clearly understood, and what little we know comes largely through texts written in various dialects, visual representations, and archaeologi- cal remains. Mesopotamian deities were conceived in human form and were believed to reside in images erected in cult buildings. This image was the focus of the cult and was carefully nurtured through many pre- cisely prescribed rituals for feeding, cloth- ing, and washing, in the hope that the god might then be pleased and disposed to act favorably toward his subjects. Cuneiform texts tell us that most of the cult images-none of which are entirely preserved-were made of precious woods and were either dressed in elaborate garments or covered entirely with gold. They had staring eyes inlaid with pre- cious stones, often lapis lazuli, for the pupil and shell or alabaster for the sur- rounding white. Statues of other deities and of important, often royal, worshipers were frequently placed in the temples. The gypsum statue (fig. 21) was found at Tell Asmar in the Square Temple, which was built shortly before the middle of the third millennium B.C. It is probably an image of a pious worshiper, not a deity; his hypnotically staring eyes may re- semble those of his revered god. Offerings of food and drink were brought to the deity every day; they were "con- sumed" by it behind drawn curtains. In addition to the ritual feeding, libations were offered, usually of water, wine, beer, oil, or the blood of a sacrificial animal. These liquids were poured from a special vessel onto an altar or into another sa- cred receptacle or object. Such a ceramic vessel (fig. 22), probably from Syria, is in the shape of a two-storied tower topped by a human figure wearing a conical cap and restraining two felines by their tails. Between them is a narrow-necked open- ing through which a blessed liquid was poured, to flow from one of the two doors cut into the front of the tower vessel. 22</page><page sequence="21">Across the top of the tower a cylinder- seal impression shows a variation of the presentation scene. The figurine of a kneeling bull (fig. 23), from early third-millennium Iran, is magnifi- cently sculpted in silver (see p. 46). It is clothed as a human, in a textile deco- rated with a stepped pattern, and holds a tall, spouted vessel in its outstretched hooves in the posture of a supplicant. We know nothing of the religious rituals of Iran from the beginning of the third millen- nium B.C. Contemporary Proto-Elamite cylinder seals do show animals in human posture that may be engaged in some kind of ritual activity. In addition to the daily rituals surround- ing the cult image, the Mesopotamian calendar was full of special days on which particular rites had to be observed by the priests and the king. The most important of these was the New Year's Festival, which, after many changes through the ages, was celebrated in the first millen- nium B.C. during the spring month of Nisan. In Babylon, the king and priests performed rituals for eleven days; the high point of the festival occurred when the cult statues of Marduk-the chief Babylonian god-and other deities were paraded along the Processional Way leading from the temple precinct to the Akitu house. Outside the magnificent Ishtar Gate, the walls along the way were lined with colorful glazed-brick images of lions (see fig. 9) striding boldly toward the sacred destination where a mys- terious and crucial ritual must have taken place. H.P. 22 23 23</page><page sequence="22">Some of the most elaborate representa- tions of females in the art of the ancient Near East are images of divine and cult figures whose association with certain aspects of life made them essential to the welfare of mankind. Fertility, procreation, the growth of crops and livestock, and such natural phenomena as thunder- storms and rain were among the basic concepts identified with female divinities by ancient peoples. Representations of nude females in clay, stone, and metal are the simplest and most obvious expres- sion of these concepts, and such figures appeared throughout antiquity in many regions and periods. A striking example in clay from northwestern Iran (fig. 25) is hollow and probably served as a cult vessel as well as a sacred image. The exaggerated width of the pelvis may be intended to emphasize the role of women as childbearers. One of the most important Mesopota- mian goddesses was Ishtar, a divinity who combined in her nature aspects of both love and war. She is frequently repre- sented on cylinder seals (fig. 27) with 25 24</page><page sequence="23">2/ weapons rising from her shoulders or holding a distinctive lion-headed weapon. Her right foot rests on a lion, her animal attribute. Ishtar is a goddess to whom rulers turned for aid, protection, and vic- tory in battle. A small gold pendant (fig. 24) repre- sents a goddess worshiped in Anatolia. The Hittite figure holds a child on her lap, thus underscoring her role as a mother goddess. The identity of this divinity re- mains uncertain, but the wide, disklike headdress may represent the sun and the figure therefore may be a sun goddess. Although the enthroned figure rests on a flat podium or base, a loop attached to the back of the headdress indicates that this was a pendant, once suspended, perhaps from a necklace similar to the example from Mesopotamia in the Museum's collection (see fig. 19). On that necklace, small figures of another benevolent goddess, Lama, are included among the pendants. Dancing female figures decorate a Sasanian silver-gilt ewer (fig. 26), a cere- monial or cult vessel of a type datable to the sixth or early seventh century A.D. The appearance of these images was influenced by Roman representations of maenads, female worshipers associated with the cult of the Greek wine god Dionysos, a complex divinity whose wor- ship was particularly widespread in the ancient world. On the Sasanian vessels the females are always in a dancing pose and hold a select group of objects, includ- ing grape-and-leaf branches, birds, ani- mals, and vessels. No texts remain from this period to explain the appearance or function of these females in the Sasanian world, and we can only suppose that they were associated with some court festival of the Iranian year. P.O.H. 26 25</page><page sequence="24">28 For ancient man the world was full of supernatural spirits, beneficent and malevolent, who had to be constantly appeased or repelled. By the third millen- nium B.C. a few of these spirits had been represented in tangible forms that, al- though monstrous, were probably less frightening than previously, when their form was left solely to a believer's imagi- nation. The specific identity of most of these creatures is not known because there is so little coincidence of textual description and visual representation. But often their function is suggested by their appearance or from the context in which they are depicted. When represented in art, these super- natural creatures were always made up of naturally occurring forms combined in an unnatural manner. Wings were often used to transform a real creature into a fabulous one, as was the mixing of human and animal features (see fig. 64). Until the last half of the third millen- nium B.C. only a few such mixed crea- tures were represented; among them were the bull-man, the human-headed bull, and the lion-headed eagle, Imdugud. But during the Akkadian dynasty (2334-2154 B.C.) a rich variety of these fabulous crea- tures were placed into the artistic repertory. On the illustrated seal (fig. 30) is carved the snake god, whose form is human above and reptilian below; he is ap- proached from front and behind by minor deities with scorpions or snakes for hands and feet. One of these divinities is winged, while the other has felines emerging wing- like from its back. The domain of the snake god was the underworld, and be- cause he is often associated with grow- ing vegetation or, as here, with scorpions and felines and the gatepost of Inanna (the Sumerian goddess of love and war), he is thought to be a fertility deity, per- haps of Iranian inspiration. Monstrous images were often bor- rowed from other cultures, either with or without their original identity. The image of the sphinx-a creature with a lion's 29 26</page><page sequence="25">body and a human head-was borrowed from Egypt and adapted by the cultures of western Asia. From the Old Assyrian palace at the site of Acemhoyuk comes an ivory figurine of a female sphinx wear- ing Hathor curls (fig. 29). All of its elements are Egyptian, but they are com- bined in a completely un-Egyptian manner. This ivory support is one of a group of four that most probably served as decora- tion for a throne. An expertly cast silver axe with gold- foil gilding (fig. 28) is decorated with elements of the lively iconography of superhuman heroes and demons that was developed during the Middle Bronze Age in western Central Asia. The heroic demon, composed of a human body with birds' heads, talons, and wings, is a crea- ture most probably borrowed from east- ern Iran. It is shown sometimes enthroned and sometimes struggling with natural or fantastic creatures. Its opponent on the axe is a dragonlike creature distin- guished by a single horn, a curled beard, a ridged ruff, staggered wings, a feline's body, and bird's talons. This same crea- ture also served as a symbol of the Iranian Shimashki dynasty of the late third millennium B.C. Representations of fabulous creatures served not only as images of numinous spirits, but also as heraldic symbols for the propaganda of the secular state. Although its meaning is not understood, the horned and winged lion occurs in Achaemenid Persian iconography, fre- quently in conjunction with the king. On a gold plaque of this period (fig. 31) are two winged and horned lions, each rear- ing with its head turned back. The plaque was most probably sewn on a soft cloth or leather backing that served as part of the resplendent panoply of an Achaemenid courtier. H.P. 27</page><page sequence="26"></page><page sequence="27">34 Even in the densely populated cities of the ancient Near East nature was never far from men's daily lives. This is re- flected in the art, where images of ani- mals were used from the earliest times. They were represented as natural forms, as symbols of abstract concepts, or as attributes of one of the many Near East- ern deities. Along with domesticated sheep, goats, and bovids, images of wild animals predominate: lions, caprids, mountain sheep, and wild bulls are espe- cially important. As early as the late fourth millennium B.C., when urban societies were first form- ing in the lowlands, the lion was clearly associated with power, both secular and divine. The forepart of a lion emerges from a bronze peg-shaped foundation figurine (fig. 35). The plate beneath the lion's extended paws is inscribed with the name of Tishatal, a king of Urkish, in the language of the Hurrians, a non-Indo- European, non-Semitic people who, from the second half of the third millennium B.C., were present in the northern parts of Mesopotamia and Syria. Stylistic features suggest that this foundation peg-fright- ening enough to scare off evildoers-was made either by an Akkadian artist or by one within the Akkadian sphere of influence. The yoked pair of long-horned bulls (fig. 32) served as a decorative finial, perhaps for a ceremonial standard or chariot pole. It is reportedly from an Early Bronze Age royal burial at the site of Horoztepe in central Anatolia. These bulls are examples of how important animal features are often emphasized in ancient Near Eastern art. Here the horns are more than one and one-half times the length of the animal's body, impossible in nature, but an effective stylistic conven- tion. The identification of these early bulls as sacred or divine is based only on an analogy with Hittite bulls that were associ- ated with the weather god Teshub a 32 29</page><page sequence="28">30</page><page sequence="29">millennium later. Near Eastern artists must have care- fully observed animals in nature; the renderings capture their essence either through naturalistic or stylized conven- tions. A fine sculpture of a wild mountain sheep (fig. 36), or mouflon, identical to several found at Mohenjo Daro (an urban site of the third millennium B.C. in the valley of the Indus River), shows the animal resting; his hindquarters are strongly twisted to receive the full weight of his body. The physical power of this creature is emphasized by the closed outline that incorporates his sweeping horns into the massive volume of his chest. The three-dimensional, sculptural qual- ity of these animals contrasts with the intricately patterned, two-dimensional bod- ies of the gazelles striding around the side of a lovely gold cup (fig. 34). The heads at a right angle to the bodies are a feature shared by several similar cups found at Kalar Dasht and Marlik, second-millennium B.C. sites of royal burials south of the Caspian Sea. From the earliest times in Mesopota- mia hunting wild beasts was a religious responsibility that demonstrated the prow- ess and potency of a ruler. From the time of the Neo-Assyrian king Assurnasirpal II, such hunting scenes were depicted on the carved stone reliefs in the palaces; excerpts from these compositions were copied in minor arts both in Assyria and in the lands under its domination. On an ivory panel (fig. 33) from northwestern Iran, a male figure, possibly royal, is seen about to thrust a spear into the breast of a charging wild bull chased by a royal chariot. H.P. 36 31</page><page sequence="30">In the ancient Near East plant motifs were incorporated into designs on the richly decorated pottery of the prehistoric periods. They continued to be repre- sented, in a stylized fashion, on a variety of objects throughout the millennia. Favor- ite designs included sprig patterns, rows of trees, stylized flowers, and chains of leaves and buds. A schematic representa- tion of rows of date palms appears in three registers on a finely carved chlorite vase (fig. 39) of the first half of the third millennium B.C. The date palm of the oases and river areas of southern Mesopotamia and nearby Iran was a major source of food, of timber for light construction, and of fronds for mats. The reed, native to the marshes of southern Mesopotamia, is represented during the Uruk period (3500-3100 B.C.) on cylinder seals, which also depict other plants and palm trees in decorative, nonrealistic designs. In the Akkadian pe- riod (2334-2154 B.C.) trees and plants were more realistically combined with natural features to give the impression of actual landscape. An Akkadian seal (fig. 37) shows a hunting scene in which a man seizes a horned animal. Fir trees and mounds with imbricated patterns indi- cate that the setting is a mountainous region, probably the forest lands to the north or east of Akkad. The ivory carvings from the Neo- Assyrian palaces at Nimrud incorporate many plant forms as decorative elements in the designs. On one example exe- cuted in Syrian style (fig. 38) a goat is naturalistically portrayed rearing up on its hind legs and nibbling at the leaves of a highly stylized shrub of intertwined tendrils. The sacred tree was always a popular motif. This imaginary, decorative plant, composed of ornamental leaves and waterlike tendrils, was repeated many times on the ninth-century B.C. reliefs of the Northwest Palace at Nimrud (see inside front cover). Frequently, attending divinities are shown administering some purifying substance with a date palm spathe and a bucket. The sacred tree was a symbol of vegetal life and fertility-a significance that we attribute to most plant motifs and designs in the art of the ancient Near East.

They are known to us from the writings of their neighbors, the earliest records being those of the As- syrians and Urartians. By the time of the Assyrian king Esarhaddon (681-668 B.C.) Scythian nomads had infiltrated into the rich, settled lands south of the Caspian. Herodotus, the fifth-century Greek histo- rian, who wrote about them in Book IV of his monumental history, tells of sump- tuous royal burials of Scythian chieftains, which have been confirmed by the discoveries of burial mounds in south- ern Russia. The tombs covered by the mounds were filled with weapons and horse equipment as well as intricately and lavishly crafted pieces of jewelry, drinking vessels, and combs. Typical of Scythian art is the so-called animal style, which chiefly represented such creatures as stags, panthers, boars, and birds of prey. The animals are ren- dered in a decorative, stylized fashion, as illustrated by griffin-shaped appliques (fig. 41), part of a group of ornaments that has been attributed to a fifth- century B.C. treasure found at Maikop in the Kuban River region north of the Black Sea. The Scythians were great horse- men and their passion for adornment extended to the harnesses worn by their horses. The boar clasp (fig. 42) of carved bone covered with gold is probably a dec- orative element for the straps of a harness. The Scythian animal style influenced the art of other nomadic tribes. This is reflected in a rare example of fourth- century B.C. Thracian workmanship, a silver beaker (fig. 40) probably made in the region of present-day Rumania or Bulgaria. Similar beakers have been found in a princely tomb at Agighiol, near the Danube delta in eastern Rumania. The Museum's cup depicts several animals, some real and some fantastic. An eight- legged stag has antlers terminating in birds' heads, which form part of the decorative border around the rim. A bronze belt clasp (fig. 43) has an intricate openwork design with a horse and smaller figures of a foal, a dog, and a bull-all enclosed by a frame with bosses. Many belt clasps of this same type and style have been found in ancient Colchis, now western Georgia in the Soviet Union. Recently it has been suggested that they date to the first to third century A.D. These small, portable, and highly decorative objects preserved many of the features of the earlier, nomadic animal style. B.A.P. 35</page><page sequence="34">Beginning in the early 1930s and contin- uing to the present, the Metropolitan Museum has been a sponsor of archaeo- logical excavations in the Near East. Before World War II the Museum sup- ported excavations at Qasr-i Abu Nasr and Nishapur in Iran, and at Ctesiphon in Iraq; during the 1950s its concern with archaeological activity increased dramati- cally. In the past three decades excava- tions and research have been conducted with other institutions at fourteen sites in Iran, five in Iraq, two each in Syria and Jordan, and one in Turkey. The Museum has helped to finance these projects, and members of its curatorial staff have served as directors or codirectors of several excavations. As a result of its support, the Museum has acquired much material from many cultures and periods, but its support has not always been contingent on receiving objects in return. The Metropolitan Museum first partici- pated in excavating in the Near East in 1931-32, when it joined forces with the German State Museums at the site of Ctesiphon in Iraq. And from 1932 to 1934 the Museum itself sponsored three sea- sons of excavations at Qasr-i Abu Nasr, a few miles southeast of Shiraz in south- western Iran. The site consists of a large town and fortress and dates from the late Sasanian and early Islamic periods from the sixth to the eighth century A.D. Remains of earlier Achaemenid architecture and carvings that had been transported from nearby Persepolis were also recovered. The Achaemenid material was subse- quently restored to Persepolis, and a large number of objects came to the Museum as its share of the finds. These include seals and sealings, coins, pottery, and objects of glass, stone, bone, and metal. One of the metal objects acquired is a bronze stand (fig. 46) that probably held a lamp or candle. Qasr-i Abu Nasr is 44 36</page><page sequence="35">a significant site because it dates to the transition from the Sasanian to the Is- lamic period, and the extensive architec- ture and objects furnish us with evidence of the culture during this period of change. Nippur in southern Mesopotamia was first explored in the mid-nineteenth cen- tury and first excavated, by the University of Pennsylvania, from 1889 to 1900. Com- mencing again in 1948 and continuing to 1961, seven campaigns were sponsored by the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago and the University of Pennsyl- vania, the latter replaced in 1953 by the American Schools of Oriental Research. The Metropolitan Museum actively partici- pated in the campaigns of 1957-58 and 1960-61. Ancient texts indicate that Nippur was a major religious center rather than a powerful secular state, and the archaeo- logical remains document that reputation. A large temple precinct called the Ekur with a temple of the god Enlil with a zig- gurat, a temple of the goddess Inanna that was rebuilt many times over the millennia (fig. 44), and scribal quarters are the main architectural and cultural features at the site. Seven brick foundation boxes of the king Shulgi were discovered beneath the temple of Inanna, which dates from the Third Dynasty of Ur (2.112-2004 B.C.), and three boxes of his father, Urnammu, were discovered beneath the Ekur foun- dations; they are among the most nota- ble artifacts found there. Each box con- tained a bronze peg statuette of the king, represented carrying a basket of mortar for the ritual building of the temple. One of the Shulgi statuettes (fig. 45) is in the Museum's collection. A massive area with fortification walls five miles long surrounding an area of some nine hundred acres, the Assyrian site of Nimrud in northern Mesopotamia has concerned archaeologists since 46 48 37</page><page sequence="36">4950 50 1845-54, when Austen Henry Layard excavated there. He was followed by William Kennett Loftus in 1854-55, and George Smith in 1873 and 1876, and three-quarters of a century later by Max E. L. Mallowan, who conducted thirteen campaigns between 1949 and 1963. The Metropolitan Museum supported eleven of these campaigns, from 1951 to 1963- its longest and most fruitful involvement in archaeological research in the Near East. Nimrud has many preserved palaces and temples built by various Assyrian kings, each yielding quantities of artifacts. The Citadel, in the southwest corner, and the military area called Fort Shalmaneser, in the southeast, are particularly interest- ing because from the palaces, fort, and wells were recovered the most extraordi- nary finds at the site, the Nimrud ivories: thousands of carvings in relief and in the round, depicting battle, ritual, and genre scenes, executed in the styles of the Assyrian and neighboring cultures, in 38</page><page sequence="37">particular Syrian and Phoenician. For its support the Museum received about one hundred forty ivories, two of which are illustrated on p. 37. One is masterfully sculpted in Phoenician style and depicts a Nubian bringing an oryx and a monkey as gifts to the Assyrian king (fig. 48). The other, in Syrian style, is the head of a woman with necklace and braided hair (fig. 47). Each shows the skill and preci- sion of ancient artists with different backgrounds. Hasanlu (fig. 49) in northwestern Iran was excavated in 1936 by Aurel Stein; from 1956 to 1974 by the University of Pennsylvania; and from 1959 on, with the Metropolitan. It was settled in the sixth millennium B.C. and was occupied through the Bronze and Iron Age periods. The most extensively preserved level is Period IV, or Iron Age II, dating from the twelfth or eleventh century B.C. to close to 800 B.C., when the site was violently destroyed. The preceding level, Period V, Iron I, dates from between the fourteenth and the twelfth or eleventh century B.C. The continuity of culture of the two peri- ods is indicated by architectural features and monochrome pottery common to both. Thousands of artifacts made of terra- cotta, bronze, iron, gold, silver, and ivory were found in the monumental Period IV buildings, which are characterized by a columned central hall surrounded by storage rooms and an entrance through a grand portico. Within each hall are hearths, benches, and a raised throne area. Whether palaces or temples, the buildings clearly had a major state function. The Museum has acquired many diverse artifacts, some of which are characteristic of Hasanlu and not found elsewhere. Among these are bronze lions joined to iron shanks (fig. 50), which are associ- ated with victims at the largest building uncovered, Burned Building II. The lion pins were worn two or three to a garment. Because the artifacts recovered from Period IV were in use at the time of the destruction, archaeologists have a sig- nificant and precisely dated corpus of material. In 1967,1970,1973, and 1974, the Metropolitan Museum and the British Institute of Persian Studies jointly exca- vated the site of Nush-i Jan, forty-two miles south of Hamadan in western Iran. Built on the summit of a natural shale outcrop thirty-seven meters high, the site dramatically dominates the surrounding plain (fig. 51). Three periods of occupa- tion were revealed, the earliest of which is Median, dating from the late eighth century to about 600 B.C., followed by Achaemenid and Parthian levels. The best preserved is the Median, containing four large mud-brick buildings. The Central Temple at Nush-i Jan is architecturally unparalleled in the Near East. Lozenge-shaped, it has a free- standing fire altar, suggesting that the building was a temple for fire-worshiping ceremonies. Sometime before the aban- donment of the site, the temple was painstakingly filled with stones and mud, allowing the building to be preserved to a height of eight meters. Why this "burial" occurred is a mystery. The adjacent Fort Building, identified as such by its but- tressed walls and arrow slots, had four parallel magazines, suggesting that it also served to store goods. In a passage- way a hoard of 200 silver objects -earrings, bars, quadruple and double spirals (fig. 52)-was discovered in a bronze bowl. The Old Western Building, one of the earliest, also has an altar and may have been a temple. This building was not buried but allowed to decay be- fore the final abandonment. The fourth building is rectangular and has a col- umned hall of the same basic plan as the contemporary hall at nearby Godin Tepe and those at the earlier site of Hasanlu. Nush-i Jan is significant for its unique and well-preserved Median remains. At present only one other probable Median site has been excavated, Godin Tepe; the capital city at Hamadan remains unexcavated. O.W.M.</page><page sequence="38">In the late 1920s, large quantities of bronze artifacts began to circulate in the art market, and by 1930 their source was recognized as Luristan, a mountainous region in western Iran, bordering Meso- potamia and Elam. Aside from a few archaeological campaigns, especially those of Erich Schmidt at Surkh Dum in 1938 and Louis Vanden Berghe at many sites from 1965 to 1979, the great major- ity of Luristan bronzes derive from clan- destine digging. The Metropolitan Museum has in its collection forty-one objects, twenty-four of them bronzes, from Surkh Dum. Because so many bronzes have been dispersed so widely, it is impossible to estimate the number in existence, but there must be thousands. We do not know the ancient name and language of Luristan, or why the bronzes were made, or what constituted the econ- omy that supported their manufacture. It is also difficult to identify the full range of cultural artifacts and to establish their 56 40</page><page sequence="39">chronology. Nevertheless, we are able to recognize as classic Luristan types the stylized standards and finials, horse cheekpieces, hammered and cast pins, bracelets, whetstone handles, weapons, and quivers. And although ancient cul- tures existed in the region from as early as the third millennium B.C., the typical Luristan bronzes did not appear until the early first millennium B.C. They reached full production in the eighth and seventh centuries B c and mysteriously termi- nated a century before the advent of the Persian empire. Each of the four objects shown here is a typical Luristan bronze, representing one of a variety of forms for its class. The openwork pin (fig. 54), was excavated at Surkh Dum along with other examples, some enclosed within walls, others stuck in cracks or joints. This pin depicts a squatting female who holds at bay two horned animals, represented only by their heads and necks that curve into a frame. The female may be in a birthing position, and because it came from a sanctuary, the pin may have been dedicated by a woman seeking a healthy delivery. Horse bits with figured cheekpieces (fig. 56) and iconic finials are ubiquitous and represent the most characteristic forms of the Luristan corpus. The cheek- pieces are in the shape of horses, lions, mouflons, goats, or fantastic creatures. If they were in fact buried in graves, then it was probably the custom for an individual to carry his personal bit with him to the next world, to serve for future riding or symbolically to represent the horse itself. Finials were also presumably taken by their owners to their graves. Mounted on bottle-shaped supports, a number of which survive, they occur in a great vari- ety of forms, often depicting heraldic ani- mals or a central figure between two animals. On the Museum's example (fig. 53) a detached male head is held by two heraldic felines. Because of the large number known, we may assume that finials existed in most Luristan households. serving as icons or representations of the many spirits and deities who required to be placated and worshiped constantly. The quiver plaque (fig. 55) was once attached to a leather backing and is decorated with seven uneven horizontal panels in repousse with superbly ren- dered mythological scenes. Rampant winged bulls flanking a tree and a proces- sion of antelope frame three narrative panels. At the top are horned and winged humanoids holding a lion at bay, followed by rampant lions flanking a small figure who holds lions and a central figure seemingly threatened by two bulbous- nosed creatures. We cannot interpret these scenes, but clearly they represent mythological or cultic events of some importance. A small number of other Luristan quiver plaques exist, but none is so richly embellished as the present example. O W.M 41</page><page sequence="40">Clay, so abundant and useful a resource, was developed and exploited throughout Near Eastern history. The great potential of fired clay was first understood in the seventh millennium B.C. From that point on, pottery was the most common type of object to come from the ancient ruins of Near Eastern civilizations. In the Chalco- lithic period of the fourth millennium B.C., painted decoration on pottery flourished, particularly in Iran. Artisans first painted geometric designs in dark brown or black on buff clay vessels, which were made on a slow wheel. Gradually they included more and more animal figures in their decorative schemes. A large storage jar (fig. 58) is similar in shape, fabric, and painted decoration to ones found at the central Iranian site of Tepe Sialk in levels III 6-7. It has on its side schematic silhouettes of three mountain goats, whose enormous ridged horns arch majestically 57 over their bodies. The zigzag-and-band decoration separating the goats is typical of Sialk pottery of this early period. More than a thousand years later, from the site of Tureng Tepe in the Iranian Gurgan Plain just to the east of the Cas- pian Sea, a completely different but equally successful variety of pottery (fig. 57) was produced. Its gray-colored surface-the result of firing in a reduc- ing rather than oxidizing kiln-is textured with six registers of crisscross patterns made by burnishing the surface to a high polish. During the second millennium B.C. the technology was developed for both the glazing of pottery and the manufacturing of glass vessels. A large jar (fig. 59) glazed with green, blue, brown, yellow, white, and black and decorated with pet- als above bulls kneeling before trees is one of three in the Museum's collection reportedly from the early first-millennium B.C site of Ziwiye in northwestern Iran. It is similar in shape and decoration to examples excavated at the Assyrian city of Assur on the Tigris.

At seventh-millennium B.C. sites such as Cayonu, Tell Ramad, and Ali Kosh the earliest stages of metalwork- ing technology are documented. Toward the end of the fourth millen- nium B.C., the burgeoning urban centers in the lowlands began to demand metals to make objects for the ruling elite and for the growing temple complexes. By this time, the basic properties of some nonfer- rous metals-especially copper, gold, silver, and lead-were understood. It was known, for example, that the shape of metal could be altered by heating it to a liquid state, pouring it into a mold, and letting it cool and harden. Metals were also shaped by alternately hammering and heating them in a process now called annealing. Artisans had learned as well -probably by trial and error-that when some metals are mixed in their liquid state, they combine to form a metallic alloy, a new material that is often, when liquid, more fluid and, when cool, harder than its components. The properties of meltability, malle- ability, and miscibility are the basis of two of the most important techniques of an- cient metalworking-hammering and casting. Hammering was used to make or to finish all kinds of objects. Vessels, such as the elaborately decorated one (fig. 62) from Luristan, were made en- tirely by hammering. The shape was formed by raising or sinking the bronze-a copper-and-tin alloy-by hammer blows. This particular vessel was made in two parts, joined in the middle by bronze rivets. Six registers of birds, trees, and horned and striding animals were ham- mered up from the vessel's surface in the repousse technique. The bodies were then elaborately decorated with chased lines created by a dull tool that, when struck, pushed the metal to either side. Gold is a soft metal, easily worked by hammering. A western Iranian trapezoi- dal plaque of the first millennium B.C. (fig. 64) was made in the same way as 60 6 62 44</page><page sequence="43">... . / Aw2;J, / /</page><page sequence="44">the decorated bronze vessel: by ham- mering, repousse, and chasing. A most impressive example of the hammering technique is the lovely silver figurine of an antelope (fig. 61), which is identified here on the basis of stylistic and icono- graphic traits as the creation of a Proto- Elamite master of the third millennium B.C. Both the gazelle and the contempo- rary kneeling silver bull (see fig. 23) were made from separate pieces of silver ham- mered into shape; each piece was then fitted into the other and finally joined by silver solder. By the fourth millennium B.C., lost-wax, as well as open- and bivalve-mold cast- ing had been developed. In the inge- nious lost-wax process the desired image is sculpted in wax, which is then sur- rounded with a clay investment that hard- ens into a mold when baked. The mold has a negative space, corresponding to the burnt-wax image, into which is poured molten metal that hardens into the shape of the original wax model. The third- millennium B.C. ibex stand (fig. 60), of copper alloyed with arsenic, is among the earliest examples of the more com- plex technique of lost-wax casting around a central ceramic core. A handsome silver plate (fig. 63), a product of the last part of the Sasanian period (fifth to early sixth century A.D.), combines the metalworking techniques described above with others. The plate itself was hammered into its final shape from a cast ingot. The low-relief decora- tion was formed by carving away the background close to the figures, while the higher relief of the bodies of the king, his horse, and the rams was made from separate cast or hammered pieces that were crimped into place. The linear de- tails were either chased into the silver or engraved-a process of cutting instead of pushing away strips of metal. A ring base was attached with solder to the bottom of the plate. Except for the king's face and hands, all the decoration is gilded with an amalgam of gold and mercury. Niello, a shiny black, hard com- pound of silver and sulphur, accents the king's quiver and bow, and the rams' horns, tails, and hooves.

They are also recorded in the inventories of temples and workshops. Although there must have been many such precious objects, only a few have been preserved. A major exception is the jewelry dating from the mid-third millennium B.C found by Sir Leonard Woolley in his excava- tions at Ur in southern Mesopotamia. The 65 headdress ornament (fig. 66), made of gold pendants in the form of poplar leaves and carnelian and lapis-lazuli beads, be- longed to one of the lavishly adorned female attendants in the "King's Tomb." She also wore two necklaces of gold and lapis lazuli, gold hair ribbons, and two silver hair rings, all of which are now in the Museum's collection. The large num- ber of objects made of precious materials attests not only to great wealth and sophis- ticated technical ability, but also to a far-reaching trade network: the materials had to be imported into southern Meso- potamia (see p. 15). A rare example of second-millennium B.C. craftsmanship is the gold necklace with pendants (see fig. 19) illustrated on page 20. The granulation is particularly finely executed. Similar jewelry elements of gold-medallions, crescents, and beads-found in recent excavations at Larsa in southern Mesopotamia suggest that the Museum's piece may date from the nineteenth or eighteenth century B.C. Our knowledge of jewelry of the first millennium B.C. is augmented by detailed representations on the stone reliefs from the Neo-Assyrian palaces. For example, in the relief (see fig. 3) from the North- west Palace at Nimrud, which shows the king Assurnasirpal II and an attendant, one can see the rich array of jewelry worn-necklaces, bracelets, armlets, and crescent-shaped earrings with pendants. Plaques sewn on garments-also called bracteates-were common in the fifth-century Scythian graves of southern Russia (see fig. 41). Gold appliques were also popular in Achaemenid Persia. The lion-head bracteates (fig. 67) have five rings on the back, allowing them to be attached to cloth garments or tent hangings. The gold necklace (fig. 65) is made up of elements from the Achaemenid period, including a head of Bes-an Egyptian god-plaques of a male figure with a horse, and lotus terminals. Similar jewelry elements were excavated at Pasargadae, where more than one hun- dred thirty images of Bes, human heads in profile, and the heads of ibexes and lions were found together in a jar. The sumptuous objects worn by the Persians are confirmed by Herodotus (VII, 83): "Of all the troops the Persians were adorned with the greatest magnifi- cence.... they glittered all over with gold, vast quantities of which they wore about their person." Herodotus also tells us that Persian tents captured at Platea in Greece were "adorned with gold and silver." B.A.P.

A form of dress frequently represented in Sumerian and Akkadian art is the calf- length skirt covered with tufts of wool (see figs. 21, 70). Wrapped around the lower body and occasionally draped over one shoulder, this distinctive garment was worn throughout the third millennium B.C. in Mesopotamia. In time, longer gar- ments (see figs. 2, 69) made of a single piece of wool or linen fabric replaced the earlier skirt. The robes had fringed bor- ders or several horizontal bands of fringes (see figs. 20, 27). Sleeved garments and shawls (see fig. 3, inside covers) of the Neo-Assyrian period (883-612 B.C.) re- tained this fringed border and were also enriched with woven and embroidered designs and metal appliques. On a relief from the Achaemenid pal- ace at Persepolis (fig. 68), one figure is in Persian dress and wears a long full- sleeved tunic of a light textile. A second figure is in Median dress, a knee-length tunic and close-fitting trousers of thick wool or leather-clothing appropriate for a horseman. The folds of a similar tunic and trousers worn by the Sasanian king (see fig. 63) indicate that in this case the fabric is thin, perhaps silk. Impractical as this material was for hunting wear, it was represented to symbolize the luxurious- ness of royal dress. Through the millennia, in the art of the Near East, a cap decorated with bull's horns (see figs. 20, 27) signified that the wearer was a god. Only rarely did human rulers claim divinity and adopt this headgear. A headdress worn by south- ern Mesopotamian rulers in the late third and early second millennia B.C. is a wool cap (see figs. 2, 69). Later in the second millennium B.C. and early in the first millen- nium B.C. a high, fezlike cap (see fig. 3) was worn in Mesopotamia by nobles and kings. Under the Achaemenid Persians a new crown with stepped crenellations made its appearance. This form, enriched by many elements such as crescent moons, sun rays, wings, and globes, became the royal crown of Sasanian 70 ^^^^9 kings (see fig. 5). P.O.H. 69 51</page><page sequence="50">About 3000 B.C. writing was invented in Mesopotamia as a method of recording and storing primarily economic informa- tion. In Egypt early records were kept on papyrus. But since Mesopotamia was located along the banks of the Tigris and Euphrates, where clay was plentiful and inexpensive, this material was used for the earliest documents. Writing was done with a reed or bone stylus on small pillow- shaped tablets, most of which were only a few inches wide and fit easily into one's palm. The stylus left small marks in the clay that we call cuneiform, or wedge- shaped, writing. The earliest script was pictographic -rendering realistic drawings of objects familiar in everyday life. It is not certain who developed this picture writing; we can only infer from archaeological rec- ords that it was the Sumerians, who soon after developed a system in which drawings in clay were replaced by signs representing the sounds of the Sumerian language. Cuneiform was adopted by other cultures, and its use quickly spread throughout the Near East. The early Elamites, who lived to the east of Mesopo- tamia (in the area of modern-day Iran), and various groups of Semitic-speaking peoples, who dwelt along the Tigris and Euphrates, also used cuneiform signs in their writing. By the second millennium B.C., cuneiform writing was widely used by many cultures in the Near East. Later the Urartians, in the northernmost parts of Mesopotamia, also used cuneiform, which can be seen on the band above the sec- ond arcade on the Urartian bell (fig. 74) inscribed with the king's name, Argishti. Hundreds of thousands of cuneiform tablets have been excavated in the Near East, while countless others still lie bur- ied beneath the rubble of ancient, unexca- vated cities. The Museum has over five 52</page><page sequence="51">hundred texts and inscriptions dating from early Sumerian times (ca. 2800 B.C.) until the first century A.D. Most Mesopotamian tablets are re- cords of commercial, legal, or admin- istrative activities. One of the earliest Mesopotamian legal documents in the Museum's collection is a small Sumerian stone stele (fig. 71), probably from the E-nun Temple of the god Shara at Umma. The stele has been interpreted as either a record of the purchase of properties and commodities by the priest Ushumgal or as a record of his bequest of these properties and commodities to various people, including his daughter. The clay envelope of a tablet (fig. 73) dates to the Old Assyrian Colony period in Anatolia (1920-1750 B.C.). The actual tablet contained in the envelope is a legal deposition regarding theft, sworn in a court of law. The clay envelope is im- pressed on each side (here the obverse) five times with two different cylinder seals. Records and inscriptions also com- memorated royal achievements, such as the building of a palace, or extolled mili- tary victories. The rim of the Achaemenid gold bowl (fig. 72) is inscribed "Darius, the great king" in Old Persian, Elamite, and Neo-Babylonian. The written record from the ancient Near East is extensive. The documents provide information needed to under- stand the political, economic, social, legal, intellectual, and religious traditions of mankind's first civilizations. i.s. 73 74 53</page><page sequence="52">Seals were prized possessions in the ancient Near East and served as propi- tious amulets for their owners. They were impressed on the clay that sealed doors, storage jars, and bales of commodities as well as on clay tablets and envelopes (fig. 73). They are miniature works of art carved with designs whose style and iconography vary with period and region. Seals first appeared in northern Syria and Anatolia during the late sixth millennium B.C. in the form of stamps. In Mesopotamia, from the mid-fourth millen- nium until the first millennium B.C., the cylinder was the preferred shape. The cylinder seal (fig. 75) depicting women with their hair in pigtails was excavated in the Inanna Temple at Nippur. Similar seals with pigtailed figures of the late Uruk and Jemdet Nasr periods (ca. 3200-2900 B.C ) have been found at sites from Egypt to Iran. The Akkadian period (2334-2154 B.C.) produced some of the most beautiful and iconographically varied seals in the an- cient Near East. The lapis-lazuli seal (fig. 76) depicts the struggle of a nude hero and his allies, bull-men, to protect the herd animals from lions. Many seals of the Third Dynasty of Ur through the Old Babylonian period (2112-1595 B.C.) show scenes of pre- sentation and worship. On an amethyst example (fig. 77) are a male figure with a mace and a suppliant goddess, both of whom are represented on many con- temporary seals in virtually the same manner. The ownership of the seal is indicated by the inscription: "Nur Sha- mash, comptroller in the palace, son of Dummuqum, servant of Rimsin [king of Larsa].' The carnelian seal (fig. 78) with a design of two lion-griffins attacking a mountain goat belongs to the Middle Assyrian period (1350-1000 B C ), when a naturalistic style was favored. The rest of the design includes a bird, a star, and a thistlelike flower. Landscape elements were frequently depicted on seals of this period. The seventh-century B C Neo-Assyrian seal (fig. 79) was found in the Nabu Temple at Nimrud. Seals were frequently deposited as offerings in temples, which were also centers of economic activity. From the Neo-Assyrian period (883- 612 B C ) stamps began to be used along with cylinders. This was apparently due to the adoption in Mesopotamia of the Aramaic script, written on papyrus or leather that was sealed with small clay dockets, more easily impressed with a stamp. In the Neo-Babylonian period (625-539 B.C.) symbols of gods were a major part of the seal design. The exam- ple below (fig. 80) is engraved with a male worshiper standing before an altar surmounted by a spade, symbol of Marduk, chief god of the Babylonian pantheon, and the stylus of Nabu, god of writing.
