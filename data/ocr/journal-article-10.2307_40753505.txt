Midrashic literature tells of such things, not to mention donkeys and snakes engaged in appalling behavior. Some midrashim go further in presenting animals as participants in the moral order, asserting their requital based on good or bad conduct. Such midrashic dicta point to issues at the center of current philosophic speculation, sociopolitical debate, and applied ethics: animal consciousness; the animals' moral status; humankind's special status; the nature of the human-animal divide, the propriety of cross-breeding for medical purposes, and more. The conceptions that inform such midrashim take on added significance in light of accusa- tions by those who espouse "animal liberation" that "Jewish and Greek ideas" lie at the root of a longstanding western "prejudice" that has yielded an ongoing "tyranny of human over nonhuman animals": the prejudice of "speciesism."2 While inquiry into Greek ideas about animals has flourished, study of premodern Jewish teachings has been scant. As a way into this topic that can contribute to the emergent field of "the history of animals," this essay explores medieval responses, mainly of an exegetical cast,3 to mid- 1 This article is part of a larger project being generously funded by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, to which I express my thanks.

I Though focused on humankind, rabbinic interest in the flood story also encompassed animals. The main textual spur for the ancient midrashists who commented on the topic was scripture's attestation that "all flesh (kol basar) had corrupted its way on earth" (Gen. 6:12).7 Taking this testimony with literalist inclusivity, some expositors inferred the fauna's involvement in the conduct that elicited God's plan to destroy "all flesh" (Gen. 6:12-13, 17). What is more, these sages defined the fauna's failings quite specifically. For example, a talmudic tradition reported in the name of the third-century Palestinian 'amora, R. Yohanan, stated: "do- mestic animals mated (hirbVu) with beasts, beasts with domestic animals, all with man, and man with all." By speaking of pairings of the domestic animals {behemah) with the beasts {hay ah) and vice- versa, R. Yohanan implied the initiatory role of both of these groups in their interspecific encounters. Similarly, by juxtaposing "all with man" and "man with all," he implied that reciprocal initiatory role of man and beast in cross- ing that human-animal divide.8 Of course, as scripture made clear, God's plan to destroy "all flesh" was not as total as it sounded (or was, at the least, subject to modifica- tion). Noah and his family were preserved among humans as well as the 7 Biblical translations generally follow Tanakh: The Holy Scriptures (Philadelphia, 1985). 8 Sanhédrin 108a. The dictum's hifil form (hirbi'u) - probably echoing the proscrip- tion in Lev. 19:19 on Israelites causing animals to "crouch" together (i. e., mate) with a "different kind" - yields an interpretive challenge. Upon reading the dictum's first half, one might think that "man" is the unstated subject and, in keeping with hifiPs causa- tive meaning, take R. Yohanan to be saying that human beings caused domestic beasts to mate with wild animals and vice versa. Interpretation along these lines proves hard to sustain, however, since the juxtaposition of "all with man" and "man with all" suggests initiatives for intermating coming from both the human and sub-human sides. (Elsewhere [Sanhédrin 54b], the Talmud envisions acts of bestiality in which the human participants are passive.) In some versions, the phrase "all with man" was missing from this talmudic saying, allowing for an exclusive ascription of agency to human beings, as in the interpretation of Nissim ben Reuven discussed below (at n. 162). Rashi failed to gloss R. Yohanan's remark in his Talmud commentary. He did, however, use hirbiu in a nearby gloss in a manner that indicated the subject's participation in, rather than facilitation of, mating activity. See Sanhédrin 108a, s. v. "hus mi-tushlamr: ve-darko shel 3oto 'ofleharbia' kol beriyot.

Noah's case was apparently clear since God told him that "you alone have I found righteous before Me in this genera- tion" (Gen. 7:1) - though this finding did nothing to explain the survival of Noah's family nor even, in the eyes of all, Noah's rescue.10 By stres- sing God's election of a lone human being due to his righteousness, scripture could be taken to imply the survival of particular animals in consequence of an individually discriminating divine calculus. Some midrashists made this inference explicit while also inferring that the animals that perished were noxious beings whose perdition was justly decreed. To be sure, despite their consignment to a watery death, some exposi- tions from the rabbinic sphere excluded the fauna from the moral calcu- lus surrounding the flood. Targum Onkelos clarified that the indictment of "all flesh" related to humankind alone ("earei habilu kol bisra 'enash yat Orhei eal 3area") while some midrashists justified the sub-human crea- tures' destruction anthropocentrically; that is, on the premise that ani- mals were subservient beings that lacked purpose in a world devoid of humankind.11 This view won the approval of some medievais even as others promoted the competing idea of the fauna's requital. As shall be seen presently, Rashi aired both views, though he gave greater pro- minence to the latter approach. Rashi expounded the fauna's sins in his gloss on "all flesh," teaching that "even domestic animals, beasts, and birds consorted with those not of their own kind" Çafilu behemah hayah ve-eof nizqaqin le-she-'enan min- 9 Ε. g., Sanhédrin 108a; Nahum Sarna, The JPS Torah Commentary: Genesis (Phi- ladelphia, 1989), 56. 10 Members of R. IshmaePs school claimed {Sanhédrin 108a) that Noah merited destruction but survived by virtue of divine "grace" (Gen. 6:8). Abraham ibn Ezra and Nahmanides agreed that Noah's family survived in his merit; see Perushei ha-torah le-rabbenu 'Avraham ibn 'Ezra, ed. A. Weiser, 3 vols. (Jerusalem, 1976), 1:175 (on Gen. 6:8) and Perushei ha-torah le-rabbenu Moshe ben Nahman, ed. C. D. Chavel, 2 vols. (Jerusalem, 1959), 1:51, 58 (on Gen. 6:7, 8:1).

Feldman, "Questions about the Great Flood, as Viewed by Philo, Pseudo-Philo, Josephus, and the Rabbis," Zeitschrift für die Alttestamentlische Wissenschaft 115 (2003): 413-17. 1 1 As one of four explanations for their destruction, despite their lack of free will, Philo asserted the animals' creation for humankind's sake (Feldman, "Questions," 405).

Complicating matters was Rashi's gloss on "I have decided to put an end to all flesh" (Gen. 6:13), which asserted an ele- ment of indiscriminate punishment since "where 'androlomosia [= andro- lepsy] comes to the world, it kills good and bad."14 Yet the glosses on Genesis 6:7 and 6:12 clearly pulled in a different direction, assigning, tacitly or otherwise, culpability to all who suffered in the flood - beasts, creeping things, and birds included. With the possible exception of the "creeping things," whose lack of liability he implied in a few places, Rashi suggested that the fauna deserved to perish.15 12 Hamishah humshei torah: Rashi ha-shalem, 1 vols. (Jerusalem, 1986- ), Bereshit, 1:73. Rashi's formulation seemingly echoes Zavim 2:2. 13 Ibid., 70. 14 Ibid., 74, where rabbinic sources are cited. (For the Greek term reflected in Ra- shi's remark, see Marcus Jastrow, A Dictionary of the Tagumim, the Talmud Babli and Yerushalmi, and the Midrashic Literature, 2 vols, in 1 [New York, 1982], 81.) Floods elicit a human tendency to focus on their animal victims (as one can see by googling "Katrina animals") - in part, one suspects, because their fate heightens awareness of the event's seemingly indiscriminate nature. The biblical flood quickly becomes a point of reference for those who witness animals in a flood seeking "the gradually diminish- ing patches of higher ground in scenes redolent of Noah's Ark." See Peter H. Wilson, "The Human Response to Floods: A Psychological Perspective," in Flood: Essays Across the Current, ed. P. Thorn (Lismore, Australia, 2004), 100. 15 That Rashi may have exempted from liability the "creeping things" is suggested by their omission in his gloss on Gen. 6:12, which mentions animals, beasts, and birds. In his gloss on Gen. 6:7 - a verse that speaks explicitly of God's intention to blot out "beasts, creeping things, and birds" - Rashi may also omit creeping things, though evidence based on differing versions of his comment's incipit is equivocal. (To limit consideration to the earliest printed editions, Rome 1470 and Guadalajara 1476 have "man together with beast" while Reggio de Calabria 1475 has "man together with the beast, etc.," implying the creeping things' and birds' inclusion; Rashi ha-shalem, 1:326.) Rashi posited virtuous avians (as will be seen) but not insects; yet he did include creep- ing things in the covenant established at Gen. 9:10 (ibid., 99, s. ν. "mi-khol yose'ei ha- tevah). Elsewhere, on midrashic authority, he inferred a prohibition on sub-human sexual activity (tashmish) on the ark. Though the verse from which he derived it spoke of "birds, animals, and everything that creeps," he stated it only with respect to animals and birds (ibid., 1:96). In this case, however, the exclusion might reflect a belief that insects did not reproduce by way of tashmish (a point made in Joshua ibn Shu'eib, Derashot eal ha-torah [Cracow, 1573], 4v) rather than denial of the creeping things' moral agency. If he did see insects as lacking a degree of volition enjoyed by higher</page><page sequence="6">(2010) The Sins of the Fauna in Midrash and Rashi 61 While filling out scripture's picture of antediluvian debasement, Ra- shi also highlighted exemplary exceptions. "Righteous" Noah received a mixed review16 but Rashi located unambiguous models of rectitude among the animals. Apparently seeing "of every kind" as a pleonasm in the description of the avians who entered the ark (Gen. 6:20), Rashi explained that what was meant was that these birds had kept to their kind and thereby "not corrupted their way."17 He reprised the theme when glossing the attestation that, as the floodwaters abated, God "re- membered Noah and all the beasts and all of the domestic animals that were with him in the ark" (Gen. 8:1). Wondering in what this recollec- tion could consist with respect to beasts and domesticated animals, Ra- shi indicated that it involved a divine commendation (and not just, as modern biblicists would have it, "a focusing upon the object of memory that results in action").18 But what about the fauna's conduct merited commendation? Having posed the problematic issue himself, Rashi pos- ited the surviving fauna's twofold "merit" (zekhut): they had refrained from interspecific mating prior to the flood and observed a prohibition on conspecific coupling placed upon them (and their human counter- parts) while in the ark.19 Completing the picture was Rashi's unpacking of the odd description of the surviving fauna's disembarkation by "fa- milies" (Gen. 8:19). Did animals have families? Even if so, were not the survivors on board too few to form them? Clearly what was meant, then, was that they renewed their commitment to "family values" or, in Ra- shi's words, "resolved for themselves" (qibbelu 'alehem) to continue "cleaving to their own kind" upon returning to reproductive activity in the post-diluvian world.20 Though, in asserting the antediluvian fauna's merits and sins, Rashi characteristically followed rabbinic leads, he ignored details and em- phases found in various midrashic sources. Rashi did not specify the textual trigger for his finding about the fauna's sins, like some midra- animals, Rashi would have been surprised by the trial of insects in his native France shortly after his death (below, n. 50). 16 In a comment on Gen. 7:7 (Rashi ha-shalem, 81, where rabbinic sources are noted), Rashi cast Noah as a man of "little faith." Glossing Gen. 6:9, where Noah is said to be righteous "in his generations," Rashi famously cited a rabbinic dispute (San- hedrin 108a) over this qualification, including the opinion that Noah's righteousness was relative to the wicked among whom he lived. 17 Rashi ha-shalem, 1:78. 18 Sarna, Genesis, 56; Brevard S.

Yohanan had highlighted mating activity across the human-animal divide ("all with man and man with all"), Rashi al- luded to it only fleetingly.25 He omitted the cryptic addendum to the assertion of R. Yohanan made by his third-century contemporary, R. Abba bar Kahana, that although the animals and beasts did intermate, "all of them reverted [or repented; hazeru] with the exception of the tushlami"26 In keeping with his aim of relaying contextual meaning (peshuto shel miqra')27 Rashi's account of the deluge omitted homilies too divorced from scripture's immanent sense. A midrash that explained how God did not "withhold the reward of any creature" added: "even the mouse preserved his family" and did not "mingle" (nifarev) with another spe- 21 Sanhédrin 108a: "even the animals perverted (qilqelu) with those not of their species - horse with donkey, donkey with horse, snake with bird - as it says, 'all flesh had corrupted its ways.'

Cf. Midrash tanhuma ha-qadum ve-ha-yashan in ibid., appendix (hashlamot), 15. For adultery as the human equivalent of the beasts' "admixture of families," see the version of this midrash cited by Menahem Recanati in his commentary on the Torah (as in Mordechai Yaffe, Sefer levushei 'or yeqarot [Jerusalem, 1961], 89r) on Deut. 22:6 (for Recanati's superior version of these dicta in Midrash tanhuma, see Aptowitzer, "Rewarding," 134 n. 37). 25 In a gloss on Gen. 6:2 {Rashi ha-shalem, 66) that described a litany of debauchery that also included brides snatched from beneath the marriage canopy, adultery, and homosexuality. 26 Sanhédrin 108a.

Rashi cast the tushlami as a bird that retained its promiscuous ways, presumably even after the flood. His understanding of "hazeru" is reflected in the first translation ("reverted") but later commentators on Rashi like Judah Loew of Prague and Jacob Slonik insisted on the usage's moral significance ("repented").

Explaining that Noah's sons were rescued in their own merit, a midrash claimed that, like the domestic animals, beasts, and birds, they too were "righteous" (zaddiqim).29 Rashi declined to designate the sub-human survivors as such, preferring to stress their avoidance of iniquity rather than the sort of active virtue that might have won them such a designation. Yet Rashi did record, as being applicable both to man and beast, the inter- diction on conjugality aboard the ark, even as he omitted talmudic tra- ditions of its violation by Noah's son Ham, the dog(s), and the ra- ven(s).30 Rashi also bypassed a question that exercised some: how were the primordial animals (or people for that matter) to know that they were required to "keep to their kind"? As one rabbinic expositor put it: "whence [do we learn] that from the time of the creation of the world, the animals, beasts, and creeping things were commanded not to cleave to those not of their species?" His answer was that in speaking of the creation of a thing "according to its kind" (le-minah) (Gen. 1:24-25), scripture intimated that "each and every species" was required to "cleave to its kind."31 How rabbis who spoke in such terms understood the notion of "commandments" addressed to animals is not clear. For his part, Rashi not only recorded the aforementioned prohibition on animal cohabitation aboard the ark32 but glossed "For your own life-blood I will require a reckoning; I will require it of every beast" (Gen. 9:5) as a directive to the post-diluvian beasts not to murder humans beings.33 Yet even as he presumed some bar on animals coupling across species, he nowhere recorded a prohibition to this effect. While clearly following rabbinic accounts of the fauna's antediluvian doings, Rashi developed these in original ways. Though he owed to mid- rash his awareness of animals whose conduct had earned divine "re- 28 Midrash tanhuma ha-qadwn ve-ha-yashan, appendix (hashlamot), 15. 29 Midrash tanhuma, Bereshit, No 'ah, 5 (p. 32). 30 Sanhédrin 108b; yTaanit 1:6. 31 Midrash tanhuma, Bereshit, No 'ah, 5 (p. 32). Though the thirteenth-century He- zekiah ben Manoah followed this midrash when glossing Gen. 6:12, his gloss on Gen. 7:21 explained the punishment of human antediluvians, in the absence of divinely mandated prohibitions, in terms of their violation of crimes discernible by reason (se- vara9).

This coinage, found also in Rashi's Talmud commentary,36 be- came commonplace, thereby testifying to Rashi's decisive role in broad- casting the fauna's sins to the Jewish world. In addition to ascribing misdeeds to the antediluvian fauna, Rashi voiced an alternate rabbinic explanation of their fate. Addressing the question, "if the human beings sinned [at the time of the flood] wherein did the animals sin?" R. Joshua ben Korhah told a parable about a father who prepared elaborate nuptials for his son prior to the latter' s premature death (or, in another version, prior to the father killing the son). Noting that he had "prepared this only for my son," the father dispersed the lavish matrimonial accouterments, saying: "now that he is dead, what need have I for nuptials?" So God, having created the animals "for man's sake" (bishvil 'adam), determined regarding the ani- mals: "Did I create the animals and beasts for aught but man? Now that man sins what need have I for animals and beasts?"37 Rashi echoed this idea when glossing "men together with the beasts" (Gen. 6:7). After asserting that the animals "also corrupted their way," he then placed in God's mouth, as "another explanation," the rhetorical question: since "everything was created for the sake of humankind, once it is destroyed, what need is there for these [sub-human creatures]?"38 The two rabbinic approaches to the antediluvian fauna aired by Rashi reappeared in commentaries of his northern French successors. Regard- ing the fauna's sins, such writers mainly raised technical questions or made good lacunae in Rashi's presentation. For example, the thir- teenth-century Hezekiah ben Manoah sought to ground the assumption that the corrupt "way" announced in Genesis 6 referred to deviant sex- ual conduct by adducing Proverbs 30:19, which referred to "the way (derekh) of a man with a maiden."39 On midrashic authority, he also 34 See the rabbinic sources cited in Rashi ha-shalem, 87, 93. 35 Rabbinic sources that use terms like "merit" {zekhui) and "liability" (hovah) with regard to animals do so to deny their applicability to sub-human creatures (e. g. Sema- khot 8:17: "u-mah 'im ha-behemah she-'en lah lo3 zekhut ve-lo3 hovah ..."). 36 Commentary to Sanhédrin 108b, s.v.

Finally, in scripture's refer- ence to "all flesh" he found a mooring for the rabbinic finding that marine life was spared in the flood, as the later reference to the death of all "on dry land" (Gen. 7:22) confirmed.40 By contrast, the more peshat-onented Joseph of Orléans (Bekhor Shor) chalked up the fauna's demise to their subservience to man while making no mention of their sins.41 In typical fashion, Tosafists restricted their consideration of the fau- na's sins and requital to exegetical concerns or the harmonization of seemingly contradictory texts. As a result, they skirted larger theological dubieties and shed little light on Tosafist conceptions of the essential properties of man and beast. What textual basis was there for inferences regarding the nature of those sins? How was Rashi's global affirmation of sub-human intermating to be reconciled with his later assertion of its eschewal by some animals? These were the sorts of issues that exercised Tosafist minds.42 Certainly one would never know from such queries and the episodic disquisitions that they occasioned that the question of the human-animal divide was being broached in a most pointed fashion during the heyday of Tosafist activity by Christian thinkers and polemi- cists like Bernard of Clairvaux, Odo of Cambrai, and Peter the Vener- able of Cluny. They cast Jews as more bestial than human (or, in some cases, simply inhuman) for failing to recognize Christianity's truth.43 40 Hizzequni, 37.

Elaborating midrashically on the closing phrase of the divine pronouncement that "I will go through the land of Egypt and strike down every first-born in the land of Egypt, both man and beast" (Exod. 12:12), he indicated that "it is from the one who initiated the sin [the Egyptian people] that the punishment starts," im- plying, without clarifying, the Egyptian beasts' culpability as well.44 In a homily on "you shall cast it to the dogs" (Exod. 22:30), Rashi observed that dogs were made the first non-human beneficiaries of "flesh torn from beasts" because they did not voice resistance to the Israelites' de- parture from Egypt (cf. Exod. 11:7) - a reminder that "the Holy One, Blessed be He, does not withhold reward from any creature."45 Yet com- menting on the rule of capital punishment for an animal involved in bestiality - a punishment that, as understood by some modern biblicists, implied the biblical view that "animals, like humans, bear guilt"46 - Rashi followed rabbinic sources in asking: "if the human being sinned, wherein did the animal sin?" His answer echoed his sources: "because the person's opportunity to stumble was occasioned by it [the animal], therefore scripture says 'let it be stoned.'" Indeed, his midrash-based moralizing footnote took an animal's moral incapacity as evident: "how much more [does punishment befit] a human being who [unlike the animal] knows to distinguish between good and bad ..." Here Rashi put himself in step with the rabbinic view that "an animal does not know how to distinguish between good and bad."47 44 For gloss, rabbinic sources, and debate among Rashi's commentators over his intention to implicate the animals, see Rashi ha-shalem, Shemot, 1:252-53. 45 Rashi ha-shalem, Shemot, 3:1 12, where the rabbinic source is noted.

Needless to say, a full understanding of Rashi's understanding of animals must base itself on the Talmud commentary as well. For example, interpreting the distinction between a human being "who possesses mazela" and an animal that does not (Bava qama 2b), Rashi indicated that the former possessed "da'at" (self-consciousness? cogni- tion?; s. v. 'adam de-Ht leh mazela). Elsewhere, a mild anthropomorphism is skirted in a</page><page sequence="12">(2010) The Sins of the Fauna in Midrash and Rashi 67 Taken together, Rashi's divergent expressions on the interior opera- tions of animals underline the need to judge the overall coherence of his teachings on the issue (if such there is) on the basis of broad evidence. (Then too, there is the problem of extracting systematic ideas from Ra- shi's non-systematic writings.)48 As has been seen, some of Rashi's ex- pressions are traceable to classical Jewish texts. At the same time, one may surmise the influence of other factors, such as his empirical obser- vations of them and experiences with them,49 on Rashi's perceptions of animals. Account must also be taken of ideas circulating in Rashi's lar- ger milieu, some of which intersected with rabbinic teachings. Though in abeyance in Rashi's day, a talmudic law mandated a formal trial invol- ving proper judicial procedures before a court of twenty-three judges for an animal who mortally injured a person. In like manner, animal felons appeared in ecclesiastical and secular courts in the Middle Ages. Indeed, not long after Rashi's death, caterpillars, flies, and field mice were tried in his native France.50 (Though Rashi might have countenanced the idea of animal trials, he would presumably have balked at the thirteenth-cen- tury French cult that coalesced around Saint Guinefort, a greyhound venerated for protecting children.)51 Talmudic sources that spoke of an- imals possessing an "[evil] inclination" and acting with or without "in- tention" (kavvanah)52 could have pointed Rashi in the direction of the gloss on the dictum that the song sung by Levites in the Temple on Thursday reflected God's creation on that day of birds and fish "in order to praise His name" (Rosh Ha- shanah 31a). In his comment (s. v. "be-revu she-bara Ofot ve-dagim le-shabbeah li-she- mo), Rashi revises the plain sense and explains that it was not that these creatures sing praises but that upon seeing birds (and, presumably, fish) in their diversity, people feel inspired to do so. In this case, it is unclear whether Rashi's zoological-theological sensibilities or the grammar of the verse in question drove Rashi to interpret thus. 48 Avraham Grossman, "Ha-'ishah be-mishnato shel rashi," TarbizlO (2005): 157. (Cf. the general comment of I. Twersky cited above, n. 3.) 49 That Rashi could be quite precise in his taxonomy of and terminology regarding animals, birds, and insects appears from his revised gloss to Deut. 14:16. See Yitzhak S. Penkower, "Hagahot rashi le-ferusho la-torah," Jewish Studies Internet Journal 6 (2007): 34. 50 For the rabbinic rulings, see Zohar, "Ba'alei-hayyim," 74-78. Cf. Ε. P.

These symbolic interpreta- tions of animals appeared in highest relief in bestiaries (moralized en- cyclopedias of animals). They also functioned in the thirteenth-century Bible moralisée, where images of crows, ravens, and cats signified Jewish avarice, evil, and heresy.54 Two larger medieval trends are salient in the current context. First, beginning in Rashi's day, many in Latin Christen- dom found it increasingly difficult to differentiate humans and animals in the sexual sphere. Second, intensified efforts to curtail bestiality over the course of the Middle Ages generated elaborate attempts to explain sanctions meted out to the beasts convicted of this crime.55 Returning to "the sins of the fauna," questions remain regarding Ra- shi's precise understanding of this motif and his degree of identification with it, as one is not always sure how much Rashi endorsed each mid- rash set forth in his Commentary.56 To a modern interpreter such as Isaac Heinemann, the notion of the fauna's sins might be classed with those rabbinic dicta designed to fill in biblical details "in an imaginative way in order to find an answer to the questions of the listeners and to arrive at a depiction that acts on their feelings."57 Yet little in the rabbi- nic expositions of the fauna's sins suggests that its original expositors saw it as a mere imaginative flight of fancy.58 (Had such expositions 53 L'animal exemplaire au Moyen Âge (Ve-XVe siècle ), ed.

As with many such midrashim, Rashi relayed the notion of the fauna's sins - and other strange rabbinic dicta involving animals, like one that had Adam mating with animals in paradise prior to encountering Eve60 - without any sign of compunction. Yet to understand the "sins of the fauna" as fact rather than fable invited a surfeit of questions. Were animals subject to individual divine providence? Were their mating habits not consequent upon impulse rather than a freely willed choice? If so, why should reward and punish- ment attach to them? Rashi's characteristically "laconic presentation"61 tacitly posed such conundrums without resolving them. Whether they troubled Rashi or other scholars from the Franco-German sphere is hard to say. As Rashi's Commentary spread to points far and wide, how- ever, some Mediterranean scholars dismayed by the rabbinic motif of the "sins of the fauna" found themselves on a collision course with its tow- ering northern French champion. II In seeking to understand the status and interior operations of animals and the distinctions between them and human beings, many medieval scholars turned to Aristotle. His biological, zoological, and philosophic writings taught that humans were animals with a difference: reason {lo- gos) afforded people, in contrast to animals, the opportunity to engage in theoretical activity and purposive moral choice.62 Human beings could perceive the "good and bad and just and unjust" while animals could not; hence, praise or blame attached to the latter only "metaphori- "the animals are judged solely in terms of the human context" (75 n. 24), and ignores the midrashic claim on the same page regarding the "sins of the fauna." 59 Haim Schwartzbaum, "Talmudic-Midrashic Affinities of Some Aesopic Fables," Laographia 22 (1965): 466-83; Epstein, Dreams of Subversion, 9. 60 See above, n. 6. 61 Shalom Carmi's apt phrase in "Biblical Exegesis: Jewish Views," in Encyclopedia of Religion, ed.

Like humans, certain kinds of animals were gregarious, perceived "the painful and the pleasant," and even communicated these percep- tions. In contrast to humans, however, or at least human adults, they lacked moral agency even as, like human children, they had a "share in the voluntary."63 Medieval Peripatetics affirmed the ontological gulf between man and beast while identifying continuities and commonalities between them. Alfarabi told of a "will" (al-irãdah) born of "sensing or imagining" shared by all animals, including people. Choice (al-ikhtiyãr), however, pertained only to people such that only human beings performed "com- mendable or blamable" acts subject to reward and punishment.64 Dis- tinguishing "full" from "partial" voluntary activity, Thomas Aquinas asserted the animals' freedom from causality's reign only in a secondary sense, making the ascription of praise or blame to beasts inadmissible.65 A century before Aquinas, Moses Maimonides reprised similar con- ceptions. Like Aristotle and the falãsifa, he taught man's superiority to animals by dint of reason, insisting in Mishneh torah that the animal "soul," by virtue of which the beast "eats, drinks, reproduces, feels, and broods," should not be confounded with the form of the human soul, defined by "intellect" (de'ah).66 Here and in Shemoneh Peraqim, Maimonides argued for humankind's complete non-animality, claiming that even sub-rational parts of the human soul differed from their com- parable parts in beasts because the form of each species affected all the 63 Nichomachean Ethics 111 lbó-10, 1149Ò30-35 (trans.

Mahdi [Ithaca, 1963], 33-34). Rashi's contemporary, Abu Bakr ibn Bajjah, advanced a threefold division of human action into the "inanimate" (that is, necessary), "animal," and distinctively human, with only the latter reflecting choice.

As animals lacked a capacity for deliberative choice (al-ikhtiyãr), however, it followed that commandments and prohibitions did not appertain to "beasts and beings devoid of intellect."69 That the homicidal beast was put to death was a punishment not for it ("an absurd opinion that the heretics impute to us") but rather for its owner. Similarly, beasts that lay carnally with people were put to death not in the manner of capital punishment but as a spur to owners to guard their beasts so as to ob- viate the act of bestiality in the first place.70 Maimonides' views regarding the human-animal boundary deviated from Aristotle's in some respects, even as they evolved. In his earlier years, Maimonides adopted Aristotle's position that animals existed to serve humanity, but he later abandoned this view in Guide of the Per- plexed.11 As has been seen, in early writings he denied man's animality 67 Raymond L.

In speaking in Guide II, 48 of animals moving "in virtue of their own will (irãdah)" (Pines, 2:41 1), Maimonides approaches the passages in Alfarabi (n. 64 above). Based on an apparent parallel between human choice and animal volition in II, 48, Pines, followed by Alexander Altmann, concluded that Maimonides harbored a "deterministic theory that must be considered to represent his esoteric doctrine." See Alexander Altmann, "Free Will and Predestination in Saadia, Bahya, and Maimonides," in his Essays in Jewish Intellectual History (Hanover, N. H., 1981), 54-56 (ibid., 64 η. 143 for Pines). Even if this reading is upheld (and it is far from certainly the teaching of the Guide, let alone Maimonides' other works), it does not necessarily yield a contradiction between the Guide and earlier writings as Pines and Altmann believed.

In this same work, he also recognized the existence of intermediate beings that were neither fully animal nor fully human.72 Against Aristotle, Maimonides asserted God's providence over "individuals belonging to the human species" (though his actual teaching on this score proved considerably more com- plex than his sweeping generalization suggested). With Aristotle, he as- cribed the fortunes of individual sub-human creatures to chance, ex- plaining that scriptural passages that implied otherwise should be inter- preted in terms of God's concern for species of animals.73 Predictably, Maimonides evaluated rabbinic and gaonic teachings on animals within an empirical-scientific framework. A letter that defended the existence of human freedom indicated that "species of trees and animals and [animal] souls" lacked such freedom. After referencing his fuller expositions of this idea accompanied by indubitable "proofs," Maimonides warned against "putting aside the things that we have ex- plained" in search of one or another rabbinic or gaonic saying that, taken literally, negated his "words of intelligence."74 Though granting the existence of animal suffering in the Guide, Maimonides denied the theory of Hwad, according to which individual animals were compen- sated for excessive affliction, and blamed its gaonic proponents for en- dorsing a precept of Muslim theology without grounding in classical Judaism.75 But what of the sins of the fauna? How Maimonides would have explained rabbinic dicta that affirmed these may be surmised from a 72 For this last point, see Bland's study (above n. 4). For changes, see Daniel H.

Here, his stance clashed with the one espoused in his Commentary on the Mishnah, where Maimonides urged readers not to consider nonlegal rabbinic sayings "of little stature" and to appreciate their embodiment of "profound allusions and wondrous matters."76 It also contrasted with a remark in the Guide, in which he decried the "inequitable" intellectual who, failing to appreciate their esoteric pur- port, might mock midrashim whose external meanings diverged "widely from the true realities of existence."77 In the responsum, by contrast, Maimonides invoked a standard gaonic formula (also cited in the Guide) when he remarked that "no questions should be asked about difficulties in the haggadah" inasmuch as this segment of rabbinic discourse re- flected neither reliable "tradition (kabbalah)" nor even, in all cases, rig- orously "reasoned words" (millei di-sevara9). Individual readers could therefore evaluate a nonlegal midrash "according to that which they discern from it" on the understanding that "no issue of tradition ... nor something prohibited or permitted" was at stake.78 Presumably, Maimonides would have opined similarly about midrashim on the ante- diluvian fauna's virtues or vices. Indeed, he may have had such rabbinic sayings in mind when writing about midrashim on "those who left the ark" since, as has been seen, some of these deduced the fauna's virtues from the account of their departure from the ark in "families."79 If nothing forced Maimonides to confront the motif of the "sins of the fauna" directly (even as his teaching on providence implicitly dis- pensed with the idea), his thirteenth-century southern French disciple, David Kimhi, could not easily skirt the issue. Author of running com- mentaries on biblical books, Kimhi followed "the master and guide" on philosophic matters. In the case of retributive justice for animals, how- ever, he found things less clear-cut than Maimonides had claimed. Kim- hi read Psalms 36:6 in Maimonidean fashion: the Psalmist's affirmation of God's "faithfulness" towards beasts referred to "preservation of the /f&gt; Haqdamot ha-rambam la-mishnah, ed. Y.

Interpreting the Psalm's assertion of the Lord's beneficence "in all His ways," some asserted that "when the cat preys upon the mouse and the lion on the lamb and the like, it is punishment for the victim from God." Kimhi found a similar view in the words of the rabbis (Hullin 63a): "When Rabbi Yohanan would see a cormorant drawing fish from the sea, he would say: 'Your judgments are like the great deep [man and beast You deliver]'" (Ps. 36:7). Other sages, however, denied reward and punishment "for any species of living creature save man." Breaking with Maimonides, Kimhi asserted the animals' reward and punishment "in connection with their dealings with men," as attested in Genesis 9:5 ("I will require it of every beast") and other verses and rabbinic dicta.81 But if "particular providence" attached to animals in some circum- stances, what of the antediluvian fauna? A pursuer of the "method of peshaf who nevertheless welcomed midrash into his commentaries as long as a boundary between the two was clearly demarcated,82 Kimhi initially interpreted Genesis 6:12 only with reference to people. Support for this reading was found in other verses in which the phrase "all flesh" occurred in a context that indicated (on Kimhi's reckoning) its reference to people exclusively: "All flesh shall bless His holy name" (Ps. 145:21); "All flesh shall come to worship Me" (Isa. 66:23). This interpretation of "all flesh" in Genesis 6 proved regnant among writers of the Andalusi- Provençal exegetical school.83 Having elucidated Genesis 6:12's contextual meaning, Kimhi might have let matters be. Instead, he considered the animals' fate as well. 80 Frank Talmage, "David Kimhi and the Rationalist Tradition," Hebrew Union College Annual 39 (1968): 195; idem, "David Kimhi and the Rationalist Tradition," Hebrew Union College Annual^ Π967): 228-29. 81 Miqra'ot gedolot ha-keter, Tehilim, ed.

See below for the same view in Jacob Anatoli, Moses ben Nahman, Eleazar Ashkenazi, and Levi ben Gershom. Alert to this interpretation, Barukh Halevi Epstein (1860-1941) defended the midrashic reading as follows: since God pronounced anathema on "all flesh" and the fauna were, in the event, included in the eventual destruction caused by the flood, it stood to reason that "in this pericope the usage 'all flesh' referred explicitly to all creatures." (Torah temimah, 5 vols. [Tel Aviv, 1981], 1:41.)</page><page sequence="20">(2010) The Sins of the Fauna in Midrash and Rashi 75 He had already tackled the issue at Genesis 6:7, observing: "since all of them [the fauna] were created for man's sake, and now man was not to be, what need was there for them?" So the animals were innocent, but subject to perdition nonetheless. What is more, no special divine inter- vention was required to ensure their demise. With a flood decreed on man's account, the animals would naturally perish due to a loss of ha- bitat since individual animals lacked any special providence that could yield a divinely wrought deliverance. As for the providence that acted to preserve species, it was operative in the command to Noah to shelter representatives of each of these on the ark.84 Having embraced this rab- binic position, Kimhi might again have moved on. Characteristically, however, he donned the mantle of midrashic expositor to explain the alternate view that "animals, beasts, and birds perverted themselves [by mating] with species not of their kind." On the assumption that the Bible's opening chapter clarified God's wish that the integrity of each species be preserved, the midrash was correct in its implied allega- tion that interspecific mating thwarted the divine will. Here as elsewhere, Kimhi, spokesperson for Maimonidean rationalism in the controversies of the 1230s, proved willing to defend even "midrashim of the 'irra- tional' variety."85 Yet apparently keen to end on a different note, he concluded that the "sins of the fauna" was not a rabbinic consensus omnium and that some sages explained the animals' fate in terms of the rationale implied in the question: "Now that man sins, what need have I for animals and beasts?"86 Like his southern French contemporary David Kimhi, Jacob Anatoli was a devotee of the rationalism brought to Provence by Andalusi scho- lars fleeing the Almohad invasion of Muslim Spain.87 Anatoli's Malmad ha-talmidim, a collection of sermons arranged around the weekly Torah portion, carried forward the project of Maimonidean biblical commen- tary in a form that exposed ordinary Jews in southern France (and beyond, as far away as Yemen)88 to philosophic exegesis and a rational- 84 Miqra'ot gedolot ha-keter, Bereshit, 1:79. 85 Talmage, David Kimhi, 131. 86 Miqra'ot gedolot ha-keter, Bereshit, 1:79. 87 On Anatoli, see James T.

For Anatoli, the animals' lack of moral agency was as much a finality of science as the lack of "particular" providence over beasts was a finality of theology. It remained to explain scriptural attes- tations that seemed to confound these certainties. In the case of the antediluvian corruption of "all flesh," the task was simple: this expres- sion referred to "humankind's conduct" alone. But why, then, did scrip- ture speak of "all flesh"? Anatoli's elucidation of this anomaly rested on a broad-ranging interpretive principle: that holy writ at times used a general term to refer to a single constituent encompassed by that term where the constituent in question comprised the majority (rov) in the category or its "choice element." An example was Eve as "mother of all the living" (Gen. 3:20). It indicated her motherhood of people, ter- restrial creation's choice element, and not all living things literally. So it was with "all flesh" in Genesis 6:12, which referred to the select compo- nent in the category, namely humankind.89 Anatoli's insights built on those of his professed masters. Maimonides had articulated the notion (probably known to Anatoli directly from Aristotle) that a term could be used in both a general and particular sense.90 With respect to "basar" in particular, Anatoli might have noted a remark in his father-in-law's Glossary of Unusual Terms in the Guide, published with a revised translation of the Guide in 1213. In it, Samuel ibn Tibbon clarified how, in his first Guide translation, he had rendered Maimonides' Judeo-Arabic references to human beings by way of He- brew "basar" and how his impulse to do so was informed by Genesis 6:12's "all flesh," which, as ibn Tibbon evidently understood it, referred to people alone.91 Building on such leads, Anatoli supplied the nuance that, in the Torah as elsewhere, general terms at times referred to the "choice element" in the class they defined - thus, the reference to "all flesh" in Genesis 6:12, where the term applied to human beings alone. A last potentially knotty point remained. Anatoli interpreted (away) "all flesh" to his satisfaction but some sages, using "the method of de- 89 Malmad ha-talmidim, ed. L. Silbermann (Lyck, 1866), lOr. Other late medieval rationalists, like Eleazar Ashkenazi, took a different tack in explaining the assertion that Eve was "mother of all living things," invoking her philosophic-allegorical status as "matter" to justify (indeed, to make at all comprehensible) scripture's description of her as the mother of all animate life, "man and all animals included."

To counter their exposition, Anatoli deftly summoned a broader postulate from the repertory of rabbinic hermeneutics: "scripture may not to be divested of its contextual sense (peshuto)"92 Pointedly contrasting "things" said according to "the method of derash" with what exited from his analysis according to "the method of truth," Anatoli reaffirmed humankind's exclusive role in causing the flood.93 Did Rashi stimulate Kimhi's and Anatoli's treatments of the fauna's sins? The question is not easily answered. Certainly Rashi's Commentary was widely available in Provence in their day. Indeed, by the later twelfth century two giants of southern French talmudism, Zerahiyah Halevi of Lunel and Avraham ben David of Posquières, cited it. The circumstan- tial case for Rashi's impact on Kimhi is more compelling than the one for his influence on Anatoli. The former drew on Rashi's biblical com- mentaries in general and Torah commentary in particular and at times "felt compelled to wrestle" with midrashim that these works brought to the fore.94 Yet, in his commentary on Genesis 6, Kimhi neither referred to Rashi nor cited the "sins of the fauna" motif in Rashi's distinctive reformulation of it. Still, it is reasonable to surmise that Rashi's invoca- tion was part of the reason that the motif commanded Kimhi's atten- tion. Rashi's role as a catalyst for Anatoli's confrontation with the "sins of the fauna" motif is less likely since Rashi figured little in Anatoli's quest for exegetical understanding. A handsome summary of the rationalist response to the idea of the fauna's sins issued from the pen of the fourteenth-century southern French exegete, Levi ben Gershom. "You should know," he instructed, that the fauna "were not effaced due to the corruption of their ways since they are not possessors of intellect such that it would be appro- priate to exact punishment from them." Rather, they perished due to "that generation [of humankind]" and as beings who occupied a con- tingent space in the hierarchy of being. Buttressing this understanding was the rabbinic parable of the nuptial-scuttling father, with its claim that the animals were created for man's sake. Through the ark, provi- dence insured the postdeluvian survival of sub-human species due to 92 Shabbat 63a; Yevamot lia, 24a.

Genesis 6:12 referred to "all of human- kind" on the pattern of Isaiah's "All flesh shall come to worship Me."95 Not all rationalists rejected the midrashic motif of the "sins of the fauna" so tacitly - or gently. A frontal attack was forthcoming from Levi ben Gershom's fourteenth-century eastern Mediterranean counter- part, Eleazar Ashkenazi ben Natan Ha-Bavli, author of a Torah com- mentary entitled Safenat paneah. Though recasting it in philosophic terminology, Eleazar basically reprised as his understanding of the ante- diluvian animals' perdition the midrash that the fauna died as a result of their subservience to man. In his words, the animals were "erased with man since they were only created for man, who is the final end (takhlii) [of terrestrial creation]." That their destruction reflected a "sin residing in them" was untenable (Eleazar taught early in his commentary the animals' lack of capacity for "choice"), all the more was it a "null" (battel) idea that animals should "pervert" their nature. Here was so much "ridiculousness and risibility" (hittul u-sehoq). Interspecific mating by animals was neither an expression of free will nor an act more un- natural than the more frequently attested animal behaviors of conspeci- fic mating and promiscuity in mating.96 To these ideas Eleazar added a theological increment: the lack of divine providence over and judgment of animals. All, then, buttressed the conclusion that the antediluvian corruption of "all flesh" referred to "all human beings." Prooftexts in- cluded: "Be silent, all flesh, before the Lord!" (Zech. 2:17) and "All flesh shall come to worship Me" (Isa. 66:23). Eleazar also summoned from later in the flood story the phrase "all that lives of all flesh" (Gen. 6:19). Broader than "all flesh," this was the way that scripture indicated all animate life, rather than human beings alone.97 Though his equation of "all flesh" with people was hardly innovative, Eleazar broke new ground in addressing another question: granting that this turn of phrase could be a figure for humankind, why should scrip- ture have employed it in this way at Genesis 6:12? Eleazar's response was that the phrase subtly pointed to the cause of the antediluvian calamity, which was humankind's surrender to "its 'flesh,' this being the evil im- pulse." In so claiming, Eleazar was, here as elsewhere, relying on his 95 Hamishah humshei torah 'im perush rashi ve-eim beur rabenu Levi ben Gershom (Ralbag), ed. B. Braner and E. Fraiman (Jerusalem, 1993- ), 1:143, 147. 96 Safenat pa'neah, 32 (on Gen. 6:6-7). For the animals lack ot tree will and choice, see ibid., 25 (on Gen. 4:4). Cf. Guide, I, 72 (Pines, 1 : 190) for a passage Eleazar may have had in mind, where an animal is described going about its affairs, "eating what it finds from among the things suitable to it ... and copulating with any female it finds during its heat." 97 Safenat pa'neah, 33-34 (on Gen. 6:12).</page><page sequence="24">(2010) The Sins of the Fauna in Midrash and Rashi 79 attuned reader to unpack his compressed Maimonidean code. In the Guide, Maimonides had imparted the idea of man's detachment from knowledge attained through reason and his lapse into an existence guided by imagination. He had also identified the evil impulse with imagination, explaining that "every deficiency of reason or character is due to the ac- tion of the imagination." On this view, people were distinguished from animals by virtue of their intellect rather than imagination. Imagination was a faculty that people shared with beast. The "act of imagination" was not "the act of the intellect" but its opposite, tied to the evil impulse.98 Seen in these terms, it was easy for Eleazar to find in the reference to "all flesh" in Genesis 6 an allusion to the corrupt blurring of boundaries between the bestial and distinctively human among people in Noah's day, which advanced the human falling away from man's true purpose, defined in terms of actualization of intellect. Flesh, then, was a code word, sum- moning not just the evil impulse but a series of other connotations (really equations) alluded to by Eleazar earlier in his commentary: matter, ima- gination, sin, serpent, Satan, angel of death - in short, all that drew man away from the intellect and left him "fleshly"; that is, "naked and stripped of wisdom." Certainly the phrase could not mean that the animals' "way had been corrupted," this being a moral indictment of beasts of which they were perforce innocent, such that one could only "laugh (lishoq) at the derash that every species paired with a species not of its kind."99 Eleazar's stance towards midrash is hard to figure. At times he con- demned midrashim starkly while on other occasions he held them up as embodiments of profound insight and echoed Maimonides' condemna- tion of those who maligned midrashim after interpreting them literally, where such exegesis yielded "impossibilities" that invited gentile deri- sion.100 Still elsewhere, Eleazar distinguished those for whom "derashot 98 Guide, I, 73 (Pines, 1 :209).

In a few places, Eleazar signaled that even those delivered from perplexity could not overlook certain midrashim due to their deployment by Rashi. The question arises: was the midrash on the fauna's sins a case in point? To address this question, it is important to note that Eleazar not only inveighed against midrashim cited by Rashi but at times sharpened his critique by punning on Rashi's patronymic, "Yitzhak." He proclaimed that "intelligent people will laugh (yisahaqu)" at the one who said that Jacob blessed Pharaoh that the Nile should rise before him since "the interval when the Nile rises is known and is not dependent on Pharaoh or any person."103 Solomon ben Yitzhak had advanced this interpreta- tion. He pronounced the gematriyah used to buttress the identification of the three hundred and eighteen servants trained for war by Abraham with Abraham's lone servant, Eleazar, a "joke" (sehoq). Rashi had im- parted the midrash, whereas Eleazar held that "the numerical value of letters is of no account in the Torah, only in derash."104 Eleazar reproved Rashi more directly when handling a midrash concerning the request for "seed" directed to Joseph by the Egyptians despite years of famine still to come. Rashi had observed that "as soon as Jacob came to Egypt a blessing came with his arrival and sowing began and the famine ceased."105 This idea of " ha-yishaqi" countered Eleazar, would leave all who heard it "laughing" (yisahaq) at Rashi. Had it been within his power to repeal the famine, Jacob should have driven it from his own home instead of sending his sons to beg for sustenance in Egypt.106 Even without such allusions, it would be reasonable to conclude that its ap- pearance in Rashi's Commentary heightened Eleazar's interest in the "sins of the fauna" motif. The possible becomes probable when one notes how Eleazar's verbal formulations of his denigration of this motif For examples of positive invocations of midrashic sayings, see, e. g., Safenat paneah, 22 (on Gen. 3:22), 23 (on Gen. 3:24; cf.

And ha-Yitzha- qi's role becomes well-nigh certain in light of Eleazar's account of the fauna's sins in Rashi's novel reworking.107 To some eastern Mediterra- nean scholars like Eleazar, the rising popularity of Rashi's Commentary was no joke.108 Eleazar's assault on the "sins of the fauna" shows how scathing criticism of Rashi grounded in canons of philosophy and ra- tional scriptural exegesis could be. Ill If few Jewish rationalists as diehard as Eleazar Ashkenazi inhabited Christian Spain,109 Hispano- Jewish rabbis, even ones hostile to rational- ism, generally possessed some philosophic awareness. The sensibilities that this awareness generated left them far from the thorough-going literalism that defined early and high medieval Ashkenazic approaches to aggadah. The task of finding a balance between unreasonable litera- lism and rationally informed non-literal excess could, however, prove daunting. Aversion of the rabbinic gaze from eccentric midrashim, in which the problem might be especially acute, was not always possible. Historical events like the riots and mass conversions that overwhelmed Spanish Jewry in 1391 could press the problem of enigmatic midrashim as could their invocation in Christian attacks on rabbinic literature and missionizing efforts. When it came to strange sayings like R. HillePs that "Israel has no messiah," such forces, in conjunction with others (like reflections on Jewish dogma), became powerful vectors of interpretative creativity.110 Another factor that made evasion of certain problematic midrashim difficult was the advent of Rashi's midrashically top-heavy Commentary and the heed paid to it by the most influential biblical interpreter ever to write on Spanish soil, Moses ben Nahman (Nahmanides). Much of 107 Where Rashi wrote "... nizqaqin le-she-'enan minan" (in some manuscripts "3eno mino"), Eleazar wrote "kol min nizdaveg 3el she-'eno mino" 108 See my "Maimonides in the Eastern Mediterranean: The Case of Rashi's Resist- ing Readers," in Maimonides after 800 Years: Essays on Maimonides and His Influence, ed.

Nahmanides bestowed upon Rashi the status of the "first-born" among biblical commentators112 and en- gaged in an ongoing dialogue with him in his own commentary on the Torah.113 He adduced Rashi in support of the right to audit midrashim critically while exploring scripture's "contextual meanings"114 and com- mended some of Rashi's midrashic readings.115 As one selectively alle- giant to the tradition of Andalusian biblical scholarship, Nahmanides rejected midrashim that he considered unwarranted or unreasonable. Many were among the "midrashim and impregnable aggadot" endorsed by Rashi that Nahmanides promised to audit critically.116 In sum, Nah- manides retained a critical distance from Rashi but played a crucial role in enshrining him as a pivot of later Jewish Bible study, all the while offering a "sustained critique of Rashi's more midrashic interpretations of Scripture."117 Nahmanides' intricate engagement with midrash, and Rashi's fre- quent role in sparking it, both appear in his exposition of Genesis 6:12. Nahmanides began by elucidating an implication of Rashi's litera- list reading that Rashi had not clarified: If we interpret "all flesh" according to its literal denotation and say that even domestic animals, beasts, and birds corrupted their way by cohabiting with those not of their own kind, as Rashi explained, we would say that [God's subsequent statement explaining the reason for the flood] Tor the earth is filled with violence {Hamas) because of them' (Gen. 6:13) [means]: not because of all of them [including fauna, though the first half of Genesis 111 The title of the concluding chapter in Moshe Halbertal, 'AI derekh ha-'emet: ha- ramban vi-yesiratah shel masoret (Jerusalem, 2006). 112 Perushei ha-torah, 1:[16J. 113 Halbertal, 'AI derekh ha-'emet, 342.

(Here, Nahmanides in- deed stood "between Ashkenaz and Andalusia.") Glossing what he de- scribed as the "fitting" (nakhori) view of "our [rabbinic] predecessors" that the fauna had sinned, ibn Ezra brought it within the ken of a nat- uralistic sensibility. What was meant was that "every living thing failed to preserve its natural way" and "warped the known path implanted [within it]." Without mentioning ibn Ezra, Nahmanides elaborated: "they did not preserve their nature, such that all animals became pre- datory and the birds [became] raptors, in which case they too engaged in violence." In short, the antediluvian animals' degeneracy expressed itself in a new-found predatoriness, making God's condemnation of antedilu- vian "violence" also applicable to them.120 Enter Nahmanides, the pashtan. After going to some lengths to ratio- nalize Rashi's midrashic approach,121 he clarified that "according to the method of peshat?

(For toledet as used here, see Shlomo Sela, Abraham ibn Ezra and the Rise of Medieval Hebrew Science [Leiden, 2003], 130-37.) Elsewhere, Nahmanides described how universally pacific animals lost their non-predatory character as a result of Adam's sin and how, in messianic times, the predators would cease to prey in keeping with their "first nature" (tevae rishon) (Perushei ha-torah, 2:183, at Lev. 26:6).

Apparently, in his gloss on Gen. 6:12, Nahmanides posits a further lapse. At the time of the flood, "all" animals, as he states in this gloss, and not just those who had made "preying their habit" after Adam's sin, became predatory. Nahmanides' general approach apparently informs J. H. Hertz, The Pentateuch and Haftorahs, 2nd ed. (London, 1979), 26: "a// flesh. Including animals. The corruption manifested itself in the development of fero- city." 121 A fact that illustrates Nahmanides greater inclination to work with midrash m its own terms - and not simply to take recourse to mystical interpretation to "solve" the problem of challenging midrashim - than Halbertal allows (eAl derekh ha-'emet, 184).</page><page sequence="29">84 Eric Lawee JSQ 17 all of humankind, whereas further on [when designating the fauna as well], it will specify "all flesh in which there was breath of life" (Gen. 7:15) [or] "of all that lives of all flesh" (Gen. 6:19), [meaning] all living things in a body. But kol basar here means all humankind [alone]. Thus "All flesh shall come to worship Me, said the Lord" (Isa. 66:23) [and] also "when the flesh of one's body sustains ..." (Lev. 13:24).122 Nahmanides' application of an Andalusian "method of peshaf un- known to Rashi123 yielded a plain-sense reading in line with Kimhi's, Anatoli's, and even that of the arch-Maimonidean Eleazar Ashkenazi, who may have taken his exege tical lead from Nahmanides.124 Yet seen within the context of Nahmanides' full gloss on Genesis 6:12, this plain- sense reading reflected a religious spirit at a far remove from Eleazar's. A biting denunciation of "the derash" on "all flesh" such as Eleazar propounded was nowhere to be found. More subtly, where Anatoli ap- pealed to the rabbinic idea that scripture should not be divested of its contextual sense in order to undermine the notion of the fauna's sins, Nahmanides stood true to his conception of the Torah as a multilayered text, and he therefore sought to establish scripture's contextual meaning alongside its midrashic counterpart.125 Still, while showing, here as else- where, how his "Andalusian philological sensibility" could accommo- date midrash as a "legitimate method distinct from and parallel to pe- shat"m Nahmanides left no doubt that on the level of peshat, "all flesh" meant human beings - Rashi notwithstanding. Seen in terms of Genesis 6 alone, Nahmanides' encounter with Ra- shi's notion of the fauna's sins might seem a mainly exegetical affair. In fact, while it did reflect an exegetical dispute over the plain-sense mean- ing of "basar" in this instance, and Nahmanides' more "conceptual ap- proach to the plain sense of the [biblical] text,"127 it also reflected a 122 Perushei ha-torah, 1:52. 123 A coinage of Abraham ibn Ezra (Septimus, "Open Rebuke," 19 n. 30). On "method of peshat" as absent in Rashi's thinking, see Kamin, Rashi, 58. 124 Like Nahmanides (above, n. 122), Eleazar cites Gen. 7:15 and Isa. 66:23. 125 Elsewhere, albeit in a halakhic context, Nahmanides invoked the maxim used by Anatoli against the midrash on interspecial mating ("scripture should not to be di- vested ...") to argue that both the midrashic and contextual meaning should be cred- ited (Sefer ha-misvot le-ha-rambam eim hassagot ha-ramban, ed.

Overall, Rashi seemingly remained in some sympathy with the outlook of some rabbinic sages that the physical world - inclusive of animals, plants and even inanimate objects - "feels and thinks."128 Though Nahmanides' teaching on this score requires further study, it seems clear that that teaching, and Nahmanides' views on animals in particular, comprised a complex interlacing of scriptural data, respect for rabbinic authority, mysticism, empiricism, and selected subscription to rationalist ideas that established the parameters in which any plain-sense interpretation of Genesis 6:12 could fall. Consider God's "remembrance" of the beasts (Gen. 8:1). Rashi, it will be recalled, saw in this remembrance a twofold commendation of the animals' meritorious disavowal of intermating before the flood and celibacy on the ark. While granting that God's remembrance of Noah related to his conduct as a "perfectly righteous person," Nahmanides denied that God's recollection of the animals referred to their "merit" (zekhut) - he pointedly echoed Rashi's language - since "among living creatures, there is no merit or culpability save in man alone."129 Rather, what God "remembered" was the original plan for a world "with all the species that He created therein." Having recalled the plenitude of species meant to swarm the earth, God now took measures to restore the primal order, removing animals from the ark so their species "should not per- ish" from the earth.130 In short, the animals' deliverance was, as Nah- manides had noted in his commentary on Genesis' opening chapter, "in order to preserve the species"131 and, as he later stressed, "in Noah's merit."132 In light of these views, a disagreement with Rashi about the meaning of Genesis 6 was inevitable, with various scientific and theolo- gical precepts and evaluations establishing the parameters in which Nah- manides' plain-sense interpretation of "all flesh" could fall. Though Nahmanides' understanding of animals remains to be deli- neated, it clearly developed in dialogue with philosophically oriented treatments of the subject, especially as set forth by Maimonides.

In places, Nahmanides noted continu- ities between man and beast, even speaking of a dimension of "choice" (behirah) with respect to animals regarding their welfare (tovatam), food, and flight-response.135 Yet he retained the Maimonidean chasm dividing (rational) human beings from animals. At times, scientifically correct teachings of Aristotelian origin (or so he believed) governed Nahma- nides' views. In other cases kabbalistic teachings of which philosophers were ignorant held sway. Thus, Nahmanides indicated that the "spark of the animal soul" emerged from the Active Intellect.136 True, he may have introduced this pseudo-Aristotelian insight traceable to the tenth-cen- tury Jewish Neoplatonist, Isaac Israeli, in order to accentuate the philo- sophers' obliviousness of the sefirotic origins of the higher faculties of humans.137 Still, Nahmanides did credit the philosophic idea as regards the animals, even making it the basis for his observation that beasts possessed "to some extent a full-fledged soul" that put them in posses- sion of the sort of discretion {da at) that led them to "flee from harm 133 Gloss to Job 36:7 in Kitvei ramban, 2 vols., ed.

Nahmanides indicated human- kind's primordial vegetarianism in the same passage, stressing that since creatures cap- able of locomotion bore an affinity to the human "rational soul," their consumption by humans was inappropriate. Only in Noah's merit were animals put at humankind's gastronomic disposal. 136 Gloss on Lev. 17:11 (ibid., 2:97-98). 137 Moshe Idel, "Nahmanides: Kabbalah, Halakhah, and Spiritual Leadership," in Jewish Mystical Leaders and Leadership in the 13th Century, ed.

Rashi cast all "sta- tutes" of Leviticus 19:19, including the prohibition on breeding animals "with a différent kind," as arbitrary expressions of God's inscrutable will ("decrees of the King for which there is no reason"). After citing Rashi, Nahmanides denied that the prohibition on cross-breeding lacked rationale. To cross-breed was to effect (or seek to effect) a permanent change in creation, implying that God "did not bring to completion in the world all that is necessary." In addition, even in the best case, cross- bred animals yielded species incapable of perpetuating themselves, like the mule. Paraphrasing this second claim, Josef Stern sees Nahmanides arguing, in a "surprisingly Maimonidean spirit," that cross-breeding was proscribed due to the false beliefs on which it was based.139 Whatever its empirical, philosophic, and mystical lineaments, Nah- manides' position on the differences between man and beast put him at odds with segments of midrashic thought that, seconded by Rashi, blurred some key distinctions. The dispute ramified in many directions. Whereas Rashi had Adam, before the sin in the garden, sharing the animals' diet, Nahmanides insisted that although primeval man was vegetarian, "the food of all of them was ... not the same."140 Whereas Rashi envisaged Adam, before Eve's creation, coupling with beasts,141 Nahmanides kept his silence regarding what he presumably deemed a problematic midrashic idea. Whereas Rashi explained, on midrashic authority, that man's unification with his wife as "one flesh" (Gen. 2:24) referred to offspring, Nahmanides pronounced this understanding "distasteful," if only because it failed to elevate the human marital bond above animality. After all, "domestic beasts and wild animals also be- 138 Gloss on Lev. 17:11 {Perushei ha-torah, 2:97-98). 139 Perushei ha-torah, 2:120. Cf. Stern, Problems and Parables, 154-56. (Contra Stern, Nahmanides' characterization of cross-breeding as "deplorable and futile" [in Stern's rendering "contemptible and vain"] seemingly applies to both his explanations for the prohibition, not just the second one.) Nahmanides' stress on the divine aim for constancy of speciation is reprised in a work that often took its bearings from Nahma- nidean "reasons for commandments," Sefer ha-hinnukh no. 545 ([Jerusalem, 1948], 325). 140 See Rashi's and Nahmanides' glosses on Gen. 1:29 (and Sanhédrin 59b for Ra- shi's point of departure).

To his mind, the distinc- tively human feature highlighted was the willingness of the first model of humanity to "cling" exclusively to his wife, a trait that distinguished him and his descendants from animals, who lacked an abiding attachment (devequt) to their female partners.142 Similarly, Rashi's vision of a post- diluvian world in which God felt constrained to caution (lehazhir) beasts against killing people143 left Nahmanides amazed. How could beasts be requited given their lack of reason and resultant inability to distinguish good from evil?144 Seen in larger context, then, Nahmanides' engagement with Rashi's idea of the "sins of the fauna" hardly appears as a local exegetical en- counter. Rather, it was one node in a network of thought and exegesis that reflected a weave of Nahmanides' understanding of animals; teach- ings suffused with kabbalistic tradition on the nature of the human soul and body, and constitution of the animal world, in the pristine past and eschatological future,145 "reasons for the commandments," and, as has been stressed here, intricate interlocutions with philosophic learning, especially as gleaned from Maimonides. (This last facet of Nahmanides' "multi-faceted genius" has only recently come to be appreciated as a significant feature of his intellectual profile.)146 Though Nahmanides' views on the human-animal divide appeared at points across his corpus, one wonders whether his readers would have learned of his novellae on the midrashic idea of the "sins of the fauna" in particular had it not been espoused by the one whom he designated as "first-born" among biblical commentators.147 142 Rashi ha-shalem, 1:34, where Rashi's interpretation of a rabbinic statement (San- hedrin 58a) is brought; Nahmanides, Perushei ha-torah, 1:39-40.

These included fourteenth-century kabbalists under Nahmanides' sway, like Bahya ben Asher and Menahem Recanati (who perhaps also responded to the Zohar's fleeting reference to the fauna's sins);148 greater and lesser Spanish exegetes and homilists like Nissim ben Reuven Gerondi, Anselm Astruc, and Rashi supercommen- tator Moses ibn Gabbai, and scholars of the "generation of the expul- sion" like Isaac Abarbanel and Isaac Caro, who ushered discussion of the fauna's sins into early modern exegetical discourse. As Bahya cast it, the flood provided a lesson in the workings of pro- vidence: "proof positive" that God "punishes and destroys evildoers from the world while retaining the righteous."149 Though he considered Rashi a great exemplar of plain-sense interpretation and espoused the Kabbalah of Nahmanides,150 Bahya diverged from these forerunners (but followed another rabbinic precedent) in identifying the primary manifestation of antediluvian corruption as "destruction of seed" - hence, Genesis 6:12's pointed reference to corruption of "flesh." Just what motivated this resistance to procreation Bahya did not say but he did observe that the sin was pervasive "not only among people but also among all the rest of the creatures."151 From here one might infer Bah- ya's belief in the moral agency of animals, God's individual providence over them, and God's requital of them; yet Bahya denied such principles elsewhere,152 leaving in doubt the relationship between his theology and Miriam Sklarz, "Yahas ramban le-midrash ha-aggadah eal-pi perusho la-torah li-vere- shit peraqim 12-36" (Masters diss., Bar-Ilan University, 1998), 63, 65, 66. 148 The Zohar (1:68a) gave it play without elaboration. While the Zohar was at times influenced by Rashi (W. Bacher, "L'exégèse biblique dans le Zohar," Revue des études juives 22 [1891]: 41-42), it is not clear that this was so here. 149 Be'ur eal ha-torah, ed. C. D. Chavel, 3 vols.

Cha- vel (Jerusalem, 1970), 137-38 (138: "individual providence ... does not exist with re- spect to the rest of the animals, all the more with respect to vegetation"). A shifting formulation involving providence appears at least once elsewhere in Bahya's corpus when Bahya denies the monarchic imperative on grounds that God is "the King who goes amidst their [the Israelites'] camp and oversees (mashgi'ah) their individual af- fairs," then asserts the necessity of a king when considering the question "according to Kabbalah" (Be'ur eal ha-torah, 3:354-55).</page><page sequence="35">90 Eric Lawee JSQ 17 insistence on the antediluvian people's and animals' joint refusal to mul- tiply. Tackling the question of God's insulation of animals from fortune's vagaries in another context, Recanati broached the issue of the antedi- luvian fauna's sins as well. Explaining the requirement to release a mother bird when capturing her young (Deut. 22:6-7), he copiously cited midrashim that implied God's providential care over individual beasts while noting Maimonides' opposition to this concept. In the case of Genesis 6, Recanati harmonized the views by observing that the animals entering the ark embodied the remnant of their species that, as such, merited providential concern "on everybody's reckoning," including that of Maimonides. Having become the object of providence, it made sense that the creatures rescued in order to preserve their species should be the "righteous ones" (zaddiqim).153 Aware of Maimonides like Nahmanides before him, Recanati nevertheless spoke of "righteous" an- imals where Nahmanides had demurred.154 Approaching the fauna's sins more scientifically was Nissim Gerondi, whose account began with what "the rabbinic sages have midrashically expounded" (dareshu hazal). In an increasingly common pattern, though, this leading Aragonese rabbi restated the rabbinic view not in any original formulation but in Rashi's distinctive version: hem hayu nizqaqin le-she-'enan minan.155 As for the idea itself, it "astonished" Nis- sim. Such instability in animal instinct and a mass lapse into interspecial indulgence in the span of a single generation could only be ascribed to a change in external circumstance, not "choice (behirah) coming from them [the animals]." The change might be one within nature. It might be activated from without by the "astral network" (ma'arekhet). In either case, the animals' fall yielded a "formidable vindication of the people of the generation of the flood" whose immorality could be ex- culpated by the claim that the same force that influenced the animals compelled the human beings as well.156 Here was a "great challenge" to the midrash's "inventor" who clearly aimed to magnify rather than di- minish antediluvian evil. 153 As above, n. 24. For Recanati as student of Nahmanidean Kabbalah, see Efraim Gottleib's entry in Encyclopaedia Judaica, vol. 13, col. 1608. 154 Elsewhere, Recanati discussed a concept at a very far remove from Maimonidean thought: human reincarnation into animal bodies. See Moshe Idel, "Differing Concep- tions of Kabbalah in the Early Seventeenth Century," in Jewish Thought in the Seven- teenth Century, ed. I. Twersky and B. Septimus (Cambridge, Mass., 1987), 159 n. 106. 155 Perush cal ha-torah, ed. L. A. Feldman (Jerusalem, 1968), 82. Nissim wrote "le- hizaqeq" rather than "nizqaqin" but otherwise reproduced Rashi's formulation. 156 Ibid.</page><page sequence="36">(2010) The Sins of the Fauna in Midrash and Rashi 91 To address the challenge, Nissim sought the precise concatenations of cause and effect that generated the fauna's aberrant behavior. In locu- tions derived from the lexicon of philosophic Hebrew, he set down two premises that informed his first solution. One: "to the degree that a patient (mitpcfet) prepares itself to receive an agent's overflow, the agent's overflow intensifies." Two: once such intensification occurs, even a "patient that is not prepared or does not prepare itself [to receive the influence]" could be affected by the stronger emanations now being emitted from the causal agent. Applying these postulates, Nissim sur- mised that the human antediluvians' turn to debauchery intensified "the forces that arouse desire" such that these "even made an impression on the irrational animals," causing their aberrant behavior. Offering a second solution to the conundrum of the fauna's sins, Nissim sum- moned the "well known" proposition that debased sexual practices de- graded the atmosphere Çavir). With humanity cultivating such practices on a grand scale, the ensuing environmental contamination created a disposition towards despicable liaisons that affected beasts. (In his pithy formulation, when people "indulged that evil exceedingly, their evil spread to the rest of the animals.")157 Both understandings of the fau- na's sins shared common traits: an assumption of the animals' actual intermating, explication of this activity in naturalistic terms, stress on its ultimate cause in human sin freely chosen, and the implication of humanity's ultimate responsibility for environmental degradation. So understood, the midrash not only escaped the "challenge" to which it at first seemed exposed but imparted a bracing lesson. Far from dimin- ishing human responsibility for the flood, it taught the power of human sinfulness to impinge even on the amoral animal kingdom. Nissim's interpretations also paid a handsome exegetical dividend in his view, explaining the ostensibly otiose report that the corruption was "because of them" (Gen. 6:13), a phrase that, Nissim believed, reinforced his in- sight that the corrupted "way of the rest of the animals was caused by them [human beings]."158 Novel in its disclosure of a naturalistic causal chain beginning in hu- man free will and ending in animal depravity, Nissim's environmental approach built on Nahmanidean insights. Seeking to explain the post- diluvian diminution in human life spans, Nahmanides posited a dete- rioration in the "atmosphere" Çavir) caused by the flood.159 Nissim re- 157 Ibid., 82-83. 158 Gloss on Gen. 6:13 (ibid., 84). 159 Gloss on Gen. 5:4 (Perushei ha-torah, 1:47^8).

Frank Talmage, "So Teach</page><page sequence="37">92 Eric Lawee JSQ 17 joined that, if anything, the punishment of a flood should have ex- punged sin and cleansed the environment of polluting elements.160 Still, he adroitly deployed the environmental approach to explain how, en masse, instinctual animals might suddenly alter their coupling practices despite a lack of free will. Another midrash, this one on God's pledge to "destroy them, the earth" (Gen. 6:14), buttressed his case. It spoke of a need to destroy not only living creatures but, to a depth of three hand- breadths, the earth's outer crust.161 Nissim saw in this need further evi- dence that the antediluvian atmospheric structure had been "con- founded." Nissim developed one last approach to the animals' deviant behavior prior to the flood. It, too, pointed to immoral choices by people as that animal behavior's ultimate cause. This explanation was facilitated by the partial version of R. Yohanan's statement that Nissim seemingly pros- sessed. It read "domestic animals with beasts, beasts with domestic ani- mals, and man with all," omitting this sage's implied reference to the animals' initiatory role in the orgy of interspecific antediluvian fornica- tion.162 Stressing his use of a causative verb, Nissim proposed that R. Yohanan taught that the human antediluvians "mated domestic animals with beasts and beasts with domestic animals" while at times also sexu- ally forcing themselves on the beasts ("man with all").163 In short, the fauna's interspecial mating could be traced to externally coerced habi- tuation at which point (having what Mary Midgley calls "open instincts" in addition to genetically programmed ones) the animals could have "become used to" and perpetuated the deviance without external human prompting.164 Us to Number Our Days: A Theology of Longevity in Jewish Exegetical Literature," in Aging and the Aged in Medieval Europe, éd.

He remained vexed at Rashi's implication that the animals had corrupted themselves, as Nahmanides' reading of Rashi seemingly confirmed. And while that reading apparently acknowledged some sud- den deviance on the part of the animals that was not due to direct hu- man intervention, it left the deviance's origins unexplained. Only such supplementation as were afforded by his own environmental interpreta- tions made good this lacuna in Nahmanides' presentation of the fauna's sins, concluded Nissim. Nissim's handling of the sins of the fauna fit with his inclination to remove irrationalities from classical Jewish texts and his selective adher- ence to rationalist principles. While Nahmanides "despised Aristotle . . . and believed the secrets of the Torah to be embodied in mysticism rather than metaphysics,"165 Nissim, though wary of rationalist excess, inclined away from mysticism (and apparently condemned Nahmanides' exces- sive mystical preoccupations).166 If some Nahmanidean teachings re- flected "intuitions influenced by philosophy,"167 Nissim's immersion in Greco-Arabic (and, by some indications, Latin) science was much dee- per.168 By grounding the "sins of the fauna" in causal principles opera- tive in the everyday postdiluvian world and by using figures from the Hebrew philosophic corpus (like "overflow" for causality),169 Nissim made intelligible, even edifying, a midrash that at first glance left scien- tifically informed Jews like himself "astonished." As Nissim's engagement with Genesis 6:12 evidently received signifi- cant impetus from Rashi and Nahmanides, so Rashi may have served as the "ultimate" cause (and Nahmanides and Nissim the "proximate" ones) of the invocation of the "sins of the fauna" in Anselm Astruc's 165 Berger, "How Did Nahmanides," 136. 166 See the sentiment cited in Isaac Bar Sheshet, She'elot u-teshuvot, ed.

Nissim's idea that the preparation of the recipient can affect the agent is redolent of Kabbalah, but, as noted above, Nissim was not given to kab- balistic expression.</page><page sequence="39">94 Eric Lawee JSQ 17 Midreshei tor ah. Writing in the decade before the Spanish an ti- Jewish riots that claimed his life in 139 1,170 Astruc sought clarification of the testimony that "the earth became corrupt before God" (Gen. 6:11). It being axiomatic to him that the phrase "before God" was not locative, he interpreted it in terms of corruption performed in forthright opposi- tion to the "divine intention," as exemplified by the cross-breeding of the antediluvian animals. Specifically, this misdeed yielded "nullifica- tion" of the constancy of speciation intended by God by forestalling future procreation, as the mule's sterility (the example cited by Nahma- nides in his treatment of Leviticus 19:19) proved.171 Though revealing little about his understanding of animals, Astruc's fleeting invocation of the fauna's sins exposed his typically Spanish ap- proach to midrash. In place of Rashi's morally tinctured claim of inter- specific mating, Astruc read the midrashic tradition upon which Rashi based himself in a manner compatible with the presumption of the ani- mals' incapacity for moral action. Rather than flouting some divine prohibition, the animals' altered mating habits reflected a mutation in "natural things"; that is, a breakdown in inhibitions willed by God and inscribed in nature's design. In this way, they partook of the larger dis- integration in God's plan prior to the flood. As for Rashi's role in cat- alyzing Astruc's recourse to this midrashic tradition, it is attested not so much by the fact that Astruc "very often built on Rashi's Commentary? even where such indebtedness went unmentioned,172 but, as in the case of Nissim, by his citation of the "sins of the fauna" motif in Rashi's distinctive verbal reformulation of it. If some late medieval Spanish exegetes like Astruc related to Rashi's exegesis adventitiously, others composed systematic supercommentaries on Rashi's Torah commentary.173 Though most did not feel impelled to elaborate on Rashi's exposition of "all flesh,"174 Moses ibn Gabbai aired a seemingly decisive objection: how could iniquity be ascribed to a sub- 170 See Simon Eppenstein's introduction to Midreshei torah (1899; photo-offset Jer- usalem, 1965) for details on the author and work. 171 Midreshei torah, 10.

Another anonymous Spanish supercommentator took a minimalist approach focused on the narrow question of Rashi's textual trigger: "he [Rashi] deduced it [the fauna's sins] from [the phrase] 'all flesh'" (Warsaw, Jewish Historical Institute, MS 204, 80r).</page><page sequence="40">(2010) The Sins of the Fauna in Midrash and Rashi 95 human creature lacking "intellect or understanding," such that it could not be described as corrupting its way "in order to punish him?"175 To resolve this quandary, ibn Gabbai invoked a feature of midrashic dis- course that some medieval writers (e.g., Saadya Gaon) had also stressed: Rashi's gloss was "in the manner of derash" and, in particular, "the manner of hyperbole" (guzma9)116 - a feature of midrash upon which ibn Gabbai dilated in his supercommentary's introduction.177 A conservative talmudist, ibn Gabbai seemingly felt empowered to assert midrash's tendency to exaggerate due to a talmudic precedent.178 Tell- ing, though, is his parade example: the midrash that in messianic times the land of Israel would "bring forth ready baked rolls." It was Maimo- nides who had proclaimed this midrash a hyperbole, denying that it testified to the supernatural bounty of messianic times and reading it in terms of auspicious conditions that would make earning a livelihood during that period exceedingly easy.179 Echoing Maimonides and some of his gaonic predecessors, ibn Gabbai observed that regarding such midrashic overstatements "no questions should be asked."180 Having explained Rashi's interpretation of "all flesh," ibn Gabbai acquitted himself of his supercommentarial role.181 In a rare shift from supercommentary to commentary proper, however, ibn Gabbai now ren- dered "all flesh" according to the "method of peshaf": the phrase re- ferred to people alone, as Isaiah's reference to "all flesh" worshipping God showed. Little sleuthing is required to discern his Nahmanidean source. Going beyond Nahmanides, ibn Gabbai explained the destruc- tion of the fauna in the flood in terms of the principle that "all that was created for his [man's] sake perished with him."

Isaac Abarbanel, writing in Italy after the 1492 expulsion, tacitly followed Nahmanides in referring "all flesh" to humankind alone. (He cited two of the three biblical prooftexts adduced by Nahmanides to clinch the point.) Yet, as Abarbanel knew well, the sages had "midrashically expounded" (dareshu) this phrase to include beasts and birds that "mated with those not of their kind." As was becoming standard, Abarbanel cited this midrashic exposition in Rashi's revised version, suggesting that, as elsewhere, he grappled with it due to its invocation by Rashi.184 Reprising Nissim Gerondi, Abarba- nel averred that the animals' fall could only have occurred due to astral arbitration; yet this presumption yielded the "potent question" asked by Nissim: with such causal forces unleashed, why should antediluvian humanity have been punished for succumbing to them? After pronoun- cing Nissim's effort to resolve the issue "unsatisfactory" (without deign- ing to explain), Abarbanel offered the straightforward, if by no means instructive, solution that the midrash in question was "in the manner of derash" Inscrutability was to be expected or at least accepted, he implied, even as such edification as this der ash supplied remained far from clear.185 Another exegete of the "generation of the expulsion," Isaac Caro, addressing the antediluvian fauna's sins in his Torah commentary Tole- dot yishaq, immediately adverted to the sages' "midrashic exposition" on "all flesh." Like Nissim, Astruc, and Abarbanel, he, too, cited Rashi's distinctive rewording of it. While mainly recapitulating Nissim, Caro added a novel point to reinforce Nissim's observation that the midrash' s inventor obviously aimed his moral condemnation at humankind and not the animals. Proof lay in his verbal formulation that "even" the fauna, creatures who lacked free will, fell into corruption, the implica- 182 Ibid., lv. 183 In glossing Gen. 2:22 and 3:1 ('Eved shelomo, 12v), ibn Gabbai asserted that Rashi's claim that Adam mated with beasts was "not [to be understood] according to its plain sense" and denied the plain sense of Rashi's midrashic assertion of sex be- tween Eve and the serpent. 184 Lawee, Isaac Abarbanel's Stance, 98-99. 185 Isaac Abarbanel, Perush eal ha-torah (Jerusalem, 1964), 1:151.</page><page sequence="42">(2010) The Sins of the Fauna in Midrash and Rashi 97 tion being that people remained the focus of divine concern and oppro- brium.186 Caro apparently failed to realize that the wording he so care- fully (or hypercritically) analyzed was not that of the midrash but of Rashi, whose inclusion of the "sins of the fauna" in his Commentary had done so much to bring the idea of the fauna's sins to the fore of Jewish consciousness. V Among Christians, Jesus' exhortation to "preach the gospel to every creature" (Mark 16:15) elicited perplexity and a need for interpretation. On its basis, some like St. Francis famously preached to birds while others, like St. Gregory, insisted that it referred to people alone.187 So it was among Jewish thinkers with Genesis 6's indictment of "all flesh," which inspired consideration of the role of animals in the bringing of the flood. Spurred by the inclusivity of this scriptural phrase and the fauna's actual destruction and yet other textual triggers (e. g., God's "remem- brance" of the surviving fauna and scripture's account of their depar- ture from the ark "by families"), some sages advanced the view that the animals on the ark had been rewarded for their virtuous conduct while those that perished had engaged in the sinful behavior or interspecial mating. Rashi incorporated these ideas into his running commentary on Genesis, though just how he understood them remains unclear. Ap- parently, he shared the propensity of some ancient rabbis to place man and beast on something of a moral continuum, though one presumes he ultimately drew some absolute distinctions between the human and ani- mal capacity for moral agency. Mediterranean writers, generally less deferent to aggadic authority to begin with, could be troubled, or irked, by such midrashic ideas. Their juggling of exegetical variables in the case of the "sins of the fauna" was decisively altered by the scientific certi- tude that animals were devoid of moral volition, the theological precept that animals were not requited for their deeds and, in some cases, by Maimonides' teaching that divine providence over beasts extended only to species, not individuals. Accordingly, these writers stressed the 186 Isaac Caro, Toledot yishaq (Jerusalem, 1994), 66. 187 Harrison, "The Virtues of the Animals," 466. Note that in Roger of Wendover's account, Francis orders the birds to "listen to the Lord's word, in the name of him who created you and saved you from the flood in Noah's ark" (cited in F. D. Klingender, "St. Francis and the Birds of the Apocalypse," Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes 16 [1953], 15).</page><page sequence="43">98 Eric Lawee JSQ 17 ontological divide separating man from beast. Uniting all of the writers sampled above, whether they affirmed or denied the "sins of the fauna," was the certainty that human beings stood high above animals in the "great chain of being." While a dozen or so midrashim scattered throughout the rabbinic corpus might have generated sporadic later interest in the antediluvian beasts' doings, it seems unlikely that they would have evolved into a fulcrum of ongoing discussion without a significant catalyst. In this case, that catalyst was, it has been argued, Rashi, whose distinctive ver- sion of the midrash later writers increasingly invoked in place of the actual rabbinic word.188 By giving the antediluvian fauna's interspecial profligacy prominent billing, Rashi turned a rabbinic idea that might have remained dormant not only into a "pedagogical instrument in the service of the moral order"189 but a point of departure for centuries of exegetical creativity and reflection on "what is beyond the animal in man."190 188 In Ma'aseh 'adonai, Eliezer Ashkenazi speaks of the "aggadah that Rashi ad- duced," then cites Rashi's distinctive version of the "sins of the fauna" (2 vols. [1871; photo-offset Jerusalem, 1972], pt. 1, 68r).
