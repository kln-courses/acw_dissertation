<plain_text><page sequence="1">Marius Schneider On Gregorian Chant and the Human Voice Gregorian chant is a form of prayer. It cannot be understood merely through its music but must be approached through the experience of prayer. It stands midway between the spoken word of prayer and pure mystical contemplation, because it is based on concrete words whose logical meaning is sometimes restricted and at other times extended to the very limits of hyperlogical thought. More specifically it can channel the force of prayer like the locks of a canal and raise the level before releasing it once again. In the light of this metaphor, a romantic view might picture a flood tide of repressed feelings which, when the locks are opened, would gush forth like a torrential river. But the reader should not interpret the metaphor in this way. Gregorian chant contains nothing that is pathetic or violent, nor anything that is bland or gentle. Sentiment has nothing to do with its origin or substance; it is only a shadow, or a consequence. Gregorian chant is a route or path, a vehicle of movement. In pre-Christian symbolism it might have been con- sidered a cart, a ship, or a river carrying clear sound syllables. In our metaphor the two locks stand for religion and self-mastery, which enclose the waters of a lake made up of the rain of divine grace and rivers that flow from the heights of meditation to the repository of the subcon- scious. The surface begins to rise and sing. The swollen waters have depo- sited all their impurities at the bottom and overflow the locks. The two locks could also be compared to two sides of a cloak covering a man from shoulders to feet, his head emerging above the rim of the dam. In fact, these locks never open, and the crystal waters only flow over the rim. In contrast to romantic music, which is perhaps excessively communi- cative and expansive, Gregorian chant is chaste and, in terms of the modern concept of music, too reserved. Its gentle ripples are a river or path that indicates to the person praying the best way through the varied terrain of pleasant valleys, dark gorges, and harsh mountains in the liturgi- cal landscape. Its rhythm restrains the joy of the Gloria, inspires faith in the Miserere nobis, and soothes the troubled pneuma of man by gradually awakening in him the awareness of God's presence. 3</page><page sequence="2">He who sings these melodies is not following the easy movement of a melody fitted to a traditional model, but is understanding an ascension to far-off lands, so he must submit with no reservation to the precepts of his guide. These are not easy-to-remember forms of the symmetrical struc- tures of popular song, because the development is not restricted to setting into motion the elementary laws of equilibrium. Their aim instead is to go beyond cadences that are too schematic. Nevertheless, it would be erro- neous to think, therefore, that the musical movement of Gregorian chant defies the law of musical gravity. On the contrary, it respects the law. How- ever, the melodic span reduces the weight of this law and anything that might be rudimentary or heavy. The rhythm of its development swells much the way an arch does to increase the distance between the pillars supporting a temple roof. On another level the same thing happened, to a certain extent, in the early 19th century when Ludwig van Beethoven departed from the traditional, stereotyped, symmetrical, musical dynamics of his time. As has always happened throughout history, no professional or expert in the field under- stood anything of that new, higher concept of the basic laws themselves, because Beethoven translated them into an uncommon rhythm that was fuller than usual; and he asked his somewhat baffled listeners to follow him closely along arduous melodic shortcuts to unexpected heights, in- stead of considering music a comfortable landscape of gilded common- places. It is obvious that in order to be able to devote oneself to the melodic line of Gregorian chant one must have technical mastery of it, which is impos- sible to attain in one or a few rapid readings but comes only after serious study. We must become familiar with every sound and every group of sounds, the way a blind man finds out about an object little by little as he very cautiously runs his hand over it. Once the melodic form of Gregorian chant has been penetrated, its rhythm takes hold and we immediately change our attitude, because we have been transported to a higher level of our limited personal imagina- tion. Given the specifically Gregorian union of words and music, our atten- tion is immediately drawn to words which at first seem unimportant, and it is withdrawn from others which formerly seemed to be of prime impor- tance. The melodic line gives such strong emphasis to the words that sometimes the chant seems to be a mystical exegesis. However, its spe- 4</page><page sequence="3">cif ic function is to perpetuate words in sound in a manner befitting words addressed to God. There are no musical superlatives or uncontrolled exclamations in this form; everything is sober, simple and true: Vide quod ora cantas, ora credas. The reader will easily realize what high psychic tension there is in the moderate "courteous" forms of the Sexagésima Sunday Introit. There is no interval to emphasize the word exsurge because this exhor- tation is made with due moderation. The same courtesy is used in the de- velopment of the melodic line of the quare obdormis, Domine. Although the two repetitions of the exsurge are sung with exactly the same in- creased intensity, this does not alter the framework set out by the dia- logue. The expressive force of Gregorian chant is not achieved by paro- xysm but through the sobriety, sincerity, courtesy and chastity of its forms. Once all this has been understood, it is clear that a Gregorian melody can be brought into focus only by examining it in the light of its specific place in the liturgy. At the top of the hierarchy of this vast musical repertory is the psalmody that P. Wagner so appropriately called the "epic form" of Gregorian chant. There is such a high level of unison in the singers' voices during the recita- tion that psalmody is usually considered a form of solemn language. How- ever, this is more characteristic of the lessons and versicles (pairs of very short phrases) and of the orisons and reading of the Gospel than of the psalmody, because they are appeals the music of which is adapted to the rhythm of spoken language. Psalmody occupies a different psychological space. Even though it too contains mediated words, it is obvious that by al- ways using the same tone its music does not allow for any rhythmical or melodic adaptation of the spoken word. There is a reason for this unusual phenomenon. It is the sound rhythms that communicate to the singer, who is absorbed in prayer, the essence of the particular spiritual environment of the psalm as well as something of the luminous nature that cannot be expressed in words. In psalmody the verbal content of the text is less im- portant than the spiritual attitude that comes from it. The numerous melo- dic repetitions will seem long and boring only to someone who judges them without ever having sung psalms with the proper concentration. Free prose is moulded by a rhythmic cast that, by repeating itself without any kind of acceleration or change, ends up by creating a spiritual atmo- sphere. 5</page><page sequence="4">The tuba (the sound on which the word is recited) is like an axis, and each verse forms an articulate circle through the cadences of the initium, themediatio and the finalis, which are the inclinations of the person praying and also the symbols of multiplicity in unity. The more the chanter adapts his ambulatory rhythm to the choral move- ment of the psalm, the more he enters into the sonorous spiral of prayer. To another group belong the antiphons, the responsories, the tracts and the graduais. These forms are less abstract because the musical line is more marked and has a certain plasticity that illustrates the word. There arises a tendency toward melismatic melodies (that is, melodic parts sung on only one vowel or syllable), toward a rather wide range of tonal limits, and even toward imitative formulae. Therefore these melodies are sung by soloists, whereas psalmody is essentially choral. The alternation of the syllabic and melismatic parts corresponds to a particular feature of the law of equilibrium, so that the psychic energy stored up in the recited parts is released in the fluid melismata. We must place the Praefatio and the Paternoster between the two forms considered thus far. These two prayers encompass the elevation and are addressed to God in a higher vocal tessitura of a more limited range of tone. Unlike the Praefatio, the melody of the Paternoster always follows the flow of the spoken word. The fact that the prayer of prayers is sung with such calm musical sounds implies that the song is not only the splendid golden ship that transports the mysteries of the faith, but it also becomes appropriately deep and silent as it approaches the island of the Lord and reappears only when the Cross of the Holy Lands of silence shines brightly on the horizon. Indeed, in the Gregorian mass, ample singing prevails up to the begin- ning of the Gospel; after the acclamations of the Hosanna everything be- comes calmer. The singing stops during the Transubstantiation and dis- cretely appears again with the Paternoster. The fullness of sound appears again only at the Agnus Dei, and it gathers all its force at the Ite missa est, when the ship of sacrifice has re- turned to port. Therefore it is inappropriate to play the organ during the Elevation. 6 Fiddle player, Sangüesa, Spain</page><page sequence="5">/';-=09 )(8* =-0/']</page><page sequence="6">The Gloria and the Credo are the melodies of the Ordinarium Missae that most approximate purely syllabic diction. Such melodic simplicity facilitates intellectual comprehension of the word and confers unity to what is being said by it.This is also true of the Credo. The style of the Credo is so austere that not even in the mention of the Passion of the Lord does it change its musical dynamics; perhaps even the Et homo factus est was originally sung less slowly. The music of the Ordi- narium Missae is as sober as a chronicle which records events without comment. It bears witness to the action reported without using musical form to comment on the action. This judgement of the Credo might seem exaggerated to partisans of aesthetic ideas, but one should not forget the dogma and juridical aspect of the Religio, which is a direct consequence of the establishment of Christian community and its alliance with God. Not until the 17th century could music combine the two opposite concepts of the Passion, the tragic and the juridical, which seem to appear even in Mathias Grünewald's famous crucifixion on the Isenheim altar, where the ' tragic element is reflected in the despairing attitude of the woman and the juridical one in the admonishing finger of John the Baptist (Ilium oportet crescere, me autem minui). A large part of Gregorian music is not so much the off-shoot of religious lyricism as it is the codification in sound of what is narrated and what we know. In fact, the chant acts as a constraint. The moment it is expressed in sound the thought becomes more precise and forceful. The chant con- firms the thought because the thought becomes reality when the chant is sung. Singing one's thoughts after having meditated upon them means leaving the realm of individuality and entering into the activity and work of the group. In religious life song has a function similar to that of the spon- taneous speech we use in daily life to express and confide decisions reached in silence. To sing is to respond and to consent. There is little room for individual expression and the welling up of lyrical sentiment because these factors may very likely conflict with the idea of community and unity of Christ. The best pychological evidence of this is the former aversion to polyphony, and the most convincing sound symbol is that nothing but unison was cultivated and all the voices had to come together in the presence of the Lord. Moreover, the music of the Ordinarium Missae is a marvel of composi- tion. It is surprising how much variety it achieves with so little sound mate- 8</page><page sequence="7">rial and how moving it can be with such simple, austere narrative style. In a certain sense the melodies òf the Kyrie and the Sanctus are the opposite of the Gloria and the Credo; but it does not pay to instill too much expression in them either. We shall return to them later. The fourth group is made up of the Hallelujahs and it allows greater free- dom to the purely musical development. The ideology it expresses is very simple and emotional rather than discoursive. It opens up a vast area for melodic expansion, which, by commenting the text, gives movement and form to the sentiment. The Hallelujah is a veritable host of cherubim and, generally, is consi- dered an expression of joy. However, there are signs, which we shall dis- cuss later, that indicate that in earlier times the psychological nature of this jubilation was more complicated. In any event, these compositions show tendencies typical of improvised music. For example, there is a pro- pensity towards symmetry and a certain kind of imitative music, the themes of which frequently extend beyond the words that motivated them. The last group includes hymns and more recent antiphons whose poetic meter and muscial phrasing have simple forms that are used as introduc- tory or concluding songs. Since they are additions they become moments of rest. For example, in the Completorium the hymn Te lucis ante ter- minům is a veritable resting place in the middle of the office after the gra- dual ascent (Responses and Confiteor) toward the plateau of psalmody. We have seen that one of the peculiar features of Gregorian chant is its moderatio in expression. However, this does not mean that the musical means employed to formulate the religious thoughts are meagre. They make use of prodigious technical resources, and if many people find them lacking in variety it is because Gregorian chant is not, nor does it pretend to be, a scintillating art. Of all the musical modes, the most scintillating ones, namely f and c (whose important notes are found before the tonic and a dominant), play a modest role. They are scintillating because they reduce the fullness of the musical functions to two poles and accent the luminous movements ascending from the dominant, leaving in the shadows the whole faithful group of subdominants. They are scintillating because they are poor. In contrast, the functional wealth of the g, d, a and e modes are the particular area of Gregorian 9</page><page sequence="8">chant. They do not offer those showy lights because the tendency toward the dominants is blocked by the counterweight of the movement of sub- dominants that force their roots into the creative depths of tonality1 . As culture changed, this last group of Gregorian modes fell into disuse in artistic music. This development, of which there were already signs in the 15th century, went hand in hand with certain changes in spiritual life. With the development of the natural sciences, technical power continued to increase and distract man from his metaphysical mission, reducing him to terrestrial positivism and an erroneous over-evaluation of his personal capacities. The musical psychological counterpart of man's unbridled faith in his own power and in unlimited progress was the accenting of "as- cending movements", and it reached its height in the unlimited chromatic development of the 18th and 19th centuries. Moreover, this subjectivism invaded all areas of human activity, almost to the point of consuming its very substance, and not even religious music was completely safe from this intellectual trend. The tendency to apply modern dynamism to religious music increased, and even prayer, as it changed more and more into a petition (in an almost violent effort), began to prevail over the basic function of worship, namely the praise of God. The fundamental idea of the trusting, moderate, melodic lines of Grego- rian chant was the creation of the good path to God. The basic tenor was Adjutorium nostrum in nomine Domine, qui fecit coelum et terram. On the other hand, the impulse that inspired the works of classical and romantic music was the feeling of an almost desperate struggle with the will of God. In them there is something violent, anxious, and turbulent that is more human than metaphysical and was unknown to Gregorian chant. While classical religious music sought extreme situations, Gregorian chant pursued the right means. Therefore the former can fall easily into the dramatic or lyrical style, while the sober style of the latter approaches the spoken language. Gregorian chant has a melodic richness that is the same for the three steps of worship (postulation, thanks, praise). Classical musical invention, on the contrary, was more inspired by the rhythm of entreaty rather than that of thanks or praise, just as the religious paintings of the time more often show hands in positions of grief or anxiety than calmly or faithfully joined. This difference in inner attitude is immediately heard if one compares the moderate lines of a Gregorian Kyrie or a Sanctus with the same words 10</page><page sequence="9">in Bach's Mass in B minor or in Beethoven's Missa Solemnis. Gregorian melody is a road for the community; the classical one a splendid but entangled path, full of obstacles born out of egocentricity, which is the source of its most inspired melodic lines. One needs only to cast a glance at the triumphal way of the liturgical Te Deum and the magnificent but tor- mented short-cut of the Latin version of Handel's Dettinger Te Deum to see the difference. How can we explain the great importance that song has had in religious practice? It is not even specifically Christian but is also found among those cultures which are today in total decay. Obviously the psychic atti- tude and dynamism that is released by these melodies vary. There are ritual chants with cries and loud voices whose progressively quickening rhythms create a state of violent ecstasy in the singer in order to put him in contact with the spirits of his dead ancestors. There are other purely magi- cal ones that are monotone and percussive, which claim to exercise direct influence on the gods and the forces of Nature. These songs have a complicated sound symbolism which is directed to- ward increasing power. The tremolo voice or the mystical syllable hum of the Vedic priests are threats to the gods; and it is not accidental that in an- cient India the strong raised arm was the symbol of both power and music. The head of the chorus is caput mundi because, according to ancient cosmogony, the primordial substance of the world is a roar, a laugh, a sound, the mystical syllable AUM (om), word, a song of praise or a sound number. Thus the essence of everything appears to be sound, and the world is petrified music. Creation itself begins with a word or chanted syl- lable which in primordial times gave rise to the gods and the heavenly bodies, and thus the sky and the earth, which materialized and expanded through progressive materialization of sound waves. To chant this myste- rious sound means to go back to the beginning of creation and to perform the creative act. According to the Vedic tradition, to sing is the same as to create, to strengthen, to increase: "to chant the sacrifice" means "to per- form the sacrifice"2. To sing the praise of a god means to make him stronger because the gods themselves are sounds or the holy numbers corresponding to these sounds. Gregorian chant does not make these claims to power. It calls out to God, even a sleeping God (Exurge quare abdormis Domine), but always 11</page><page sequence="10">The lute (al-'ud) and the trumpet.

It offers its sacrifice and its song. It invokes and praises by singing the grace of God. Whereas non-Christian rite often believes its offerings entitle it to make demands and hence even to insult recalcitrant gods, Christian rite consi- 12</page><page sequence="11">ders sacrifice a filial duty. The former interprets relationships through the symbol of the scale; the latter considers God an eminently good being who bestows everything. In light of this, we can turn to a problem of transcendence, i.e. one posed by the ideas certain religions have in common regarding this ques- tion. So many ideas are the same that, at another level, the fathers of the school of cultural history found they had to acknowledge in them the more or less fragmentary remains of an original divine revelation3. We are aware that this type of research does not appeal to all theologians, but, following the wise advise of Pope Pius XI, who strongly supported comparative eth- nology studies, we should not entrench ourselves in our ivory towers but rather leave them to study problems as they arise. The Biblical phrase "In the beginning was the Word" seems to belong to man's most ancient ideological heritage. Even the Vitoto totemistic tribes of the American forest say that "at the beginning the Word created the Fa- ther"4, intending for Father, the supreme god. The term Word is no doubt only a more or less successful linguistic expedient to designate an idea that is almost unattainable by means of discursive intelligence and human language, because the term indicates something hyper-logical, previous or superior to any definite or limited concept. According to Egyptian mythology the world was born of the creative roar of the god Thot. The Vedic tradition speaks of a voice (a more general phe- nomenon, less restrictive than that of a particular sound) from whose im- materiality, born from nothing, the world arose through the progressive materialization of the initial sound rhythm. This rhythm survives today in the mystic syllable Om, the sound symbol of creation, synonymous with arrow. The theories about the relationship between God the creator and sound vary greatly. According to the Vedanta, the world is contained in the word of Veda and God created the world remembering this word.5 Javanese cosmogony suspects the existence of a being superior even to the Creator, who is hard to conceive and who is perhaps only perceivable in the sound of a bell.6 Here the intricate problem becomes more complicated because of the inopportune applications of the categories space and time to the principles of creation. The difficulties seem to have been overcome by the formula of St. John (1,1): In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. 13</page><page sequence="12">The Brihadäranyaka Upanishaď places the creation of time in a phase after the creation. "In the beginning there was nothing because the world was enveloped in death and hunger, death being hunger. Desirous of a body (Death) created the manas (will, intelligence). It proceeded on its way singing praise: As I was singing exaltedly, joy filled me and the waters were born ... It gathered the best of the water and made the earth. In doing this (Death) became heated, and from its sweat fire was born. By dividing itself into three parts (fire, wind, sun) its vital breath increased threefold. It then wanted a second body. As manas it joined with language (with the sound syllable?). Its seed was the year, time. It held time in its womb for a year. After that it let time see the light. It opened its large mouth against the new-born time, which began to shout Bhân (language). From this voice was born language ... With language it formed the verses of the Rigveda and the animals for sacrifice. Then it decided always to swallow every- thing that it had finished creating. (And so) every man swallows the uni- verse and considers the world his food when he comes to understand the essence of eternity." According to this passage the primordial sound was a sound rhythm of praise that produced a creative joy. This rhythm was the syllable Om, to which the philosophy of the Vedanta attributes the virtue of causing all things to grow and increase. The union of sound and time gave birth to other syllables or sounds related to time, namely pure music with mystical syllables (without words, without a pprticular verbal meaning). Language, on the contrary, proceeds from the terror experienced by the child of music when he was threatened by the large mouth of the father. Language is music that is diminished and dulled. (Several similar passages, as well as the obvious error of designating two different phrases by the same name, language, led me to use in the citation above the expression "sound syllable" instead of "language" to designate the mother of the new-born child.) The last lines of the Brihadäranyaka Upanishad quoted above reflect a phase of the doctrine of perpetual reciprocal sacrifice. Death, which swal- lows everything that it has created, is hunger, a kind of original restless- ness that induces creation (singing) and swallowing the substance drawn from its own "body". In order to produce need again it is only necessary to sacrifice once more what has been eaten, that is, one's own substance. Every creation issues from the sacrifice of its own body (because at the be- ginning there was nothing else); its maintenance requires that what was 14</page><page sequence="13">Two men blowing the horn (the biblical šofarj, capital of Bages, Catalonia previously produced be sacrified again. The poles of cosmic life are the appetite of the creator and the sacrifice of the created. The rhythm of con- struction and destruction generates the dualism that extends and main- tains the world. 15</page><page sequence="14">Similarly, the same cosmic rhythm appears in the human being, who is born to die devouring himself. The same process also occurs between the generations. Man feeds on the substance of his fathers, but he cannot hoard it. He must offer it to his children or directly to God. On the other hand, he dies and is reborn since, through the sacrifice of the vital breath, he hoards creative sounds, which never fail, so that the sacrifice occurs with the maximum interior consent. To sing is to respond, to consent and to sac- rifice. Thus this sacrifice is reciprocal and is repeated in the same way on all levels of creation. It is necessary to dwell on the application of the doctrine or reciprocal sacrifice to the field of ethics, where singing is the same as self-purification. It reaches its most extensive form in the law of equili- brium between heaven and earth, which are similar parts but at opposite ends and thus are like two plates of a scale. In the anthropomorphic con- cept of the universe, the heavenly and terrestrial worlds are a pair of indivi- duals with different rights but with equal weight. According to this law of correspondence, the gods must sacrifice themselves in the form of thun- der and terrestrial prosperity; in return they receive the essence of the hu- man lives they have created, that is, the sound substance that augments and fortifies the immortals. After having created the world, the gods said to the creator: "Give us a well-defined (cosmic) position so that our mission and our food be known," and when they saw the first human being they esteemed him highly and so they claimed him for themselves8. This is how man came to be the food of the gods, that is, the sound offering of earth to the sound gods. In this tripartite world the heavens, humanity, and earth correspond to father, children, and mother. According to the anthropomorphic concept of the universe, these three parts symbolize the head, the trunk, and the lower part of the body of a cosmic giant, and they reappear (by analogy and with the same meaning) in the mouth, genitals and feet of man. By stamping on mother-earth, man performs the dances of agricultural ferti- lity, and by offering seed he creates human life. He lavishes his greatest treasure (which symbolically corresponds to the sky) when he liberally gives away breath with his mouth. When it occurs in the guise of sound, this sacrifice is purifying, a veritable catharsis of man. Cosmic dualism is 16</page><page sequence="15">particularly evident in the creative stream, which, depending on the tradi- tion, is a laugh or a cry of pain. The birth and maintenance of the world are considered both a violent act and a happy redemption of the creative word. Therefore, it is no mere accident that the syllable Om is considered an arrow whose whistle symbolizes the painful fertile rhythm of sacrifice. Originally prayer meant to struggle and to create, to suffer and to over- come, through song, the cosmic dualism. One must not forget that for the ancient Egyptians the ram with horns lowered ready to butt was the sym- bol of prayer9. Although in speaking of song the Church Fathers never mention the sacrifice of the pneuma, one cannot negate the presence of remnants of a belief in the purifying power and sacrifice of breath in religious song. The idea of musical catharsis survived very strongly in the Pythagorean school, from which the Church Fathers adapted the mystical theology of numbers as ideas. Numbers as ideas were a fundamental part of ancient symbolism; and once the idea of the creative function of numbers was eli- minated there was very little in this theory that was incompatible with Christian doctrine. As far as musical catharsis is concerned, I believe that it could have easily spilled over into Christian theology, just as many other Pythagorean and Aristotelian elements did. Although there are no docu- ments explicitly proving this, one can cite certain Christian musical tradi- tions that seem to show evidence of these ideas. It is certain that the sound arrow, or the scream of sacrifice called saeta (arrow) in Andalusia, goes back to a pre-Christian tradition; but that cry of pain and redemption has become very Christian. That song was born of the anima natura/iter Christiana, and if these forms did not become part of Gregorian chant it was because of their decidedly individualistic nature and their lack of moderatio. The saeta is one of the most magnificent manifestations of religious music. Something similar occurs with the basic musical matrix of the Gregorian Alleluia. This matrix is connected to the melismatic challenge songs of ancient pastoral societies as well as to the Sāmaveda hymns composed of mystical syllables. This ancient form of song is related to the doctrine of vowels and creative syllables that in Vedic psalmody (where they consti- tute the entire text or they are inserted in a text) permit one to "achieve eternity"10 if they are pronounced with the proper intonation. We have no 17</page><page sequence="16">¡dea whatsoever of the meaning of the syllables inserted in the Christian chant, but we know that up to the present time the Syriac and Coptic chur- ches continue to insert sound syllables into the singing of liturgical texts11. In psalm 99:4, Saint Augustine says: "Oui iubilat, non verba dicit, sed sonus quidam est laetitia sine verbis; vox est enim animi diffusi laetitia, quantum potest, experimentis affectum, non sensum comprehendentis." The Alleluia is generally considered to be a song of joy. But might it not be of joy and sorrow at the same time? In ancient times the word jubilare meant the victorious, lethal scream of birds of prey (jubilât miluus); later on it was used in ecclesiastical language to designate the Alleluia. Might it not be because of the way it was sung or to express the inexpressible in the dualism where joy is born of pain? Moreover, the term jubilare origi- nally was related to jugulare (to strangle), and the verb jubilio probably in- fluenced the forms jubilaeus and jubilium. There is also a relationship to the Hebrew iobel, which seems to have some connection to yodel.'12 According to Athanasius (Epist. ad Marceli., 28), well-sung psalms have an extraordinarily moralizing effect which is communicated not only to the singer but also the listener, who, with due inner consent, abandons him- self to the rhythm of the chanted prayer. Hilary of Poitiers says (prol. in libro psalm, c. 19-20) that the prayers simply called "psalms" inspired good works, while the psalms called "canticles" have something of a ce- lestial air. However, in the "psalmody", or chanted psalm, there is an inter- penetration of knowing and doing; therefore psalmody is an expression of active faith. St. Gregory and St. Basil also considered psalmody a union of contemplative and active faith, and even though St. Augustine showed little inclination to accept this concept, the term psallere came to be syn- onymous with living a Christian life or carrying out Divine orders through good works. And what does "living a Christain life" mean if not offering your entire life to God and following, at the lowly level of human possibi- lity, the great example of Our Lord? With this we return to the idea of the sacrifice, which in ancient times was symbolized in song and also with musical instruments, since these were made with the bones (flutes), intestine (strings), skins (drums), horns (trumpets) or other parts of animals destined for sacrifice. This very an- cient idea has lasted until today in popular thought13, and it also is evident in the work of the Church Fathers. 18</page><page sequence="17">The dry skin of the drum called "bow", whose drumstick is considered an arrow, is a very ancient symbol of the sacrifice, as is the archaic rite of excoriating men and animals (see M. Schneider, el origen musical de'los animales simbolos en la mitologia y escultura antiguas, Barcelona, 1948, p. 106 ff.). According to St. Athanasius, who carried this symbol over into Christian thought (De titul, psalm. 150, 7), beating a drum symbolizes mor- tification of the flesh. The exegetes were always concerned about the fre- quent Biblical exhortations to praise God and to make offerings to Him to the sound of drums; and St. Augustine himself (Sermones 363, 4) did not hesitate to compare the body of Christ to a sacrificial drum: he stretched himself over the wood to become drum-like so that the sweet sound of Grace could be heard from the Cross (in Ugno ... caro extenditur, ut tympa- num fiat et ex cruce discant suavem sonum gratiae confiten). There are many allegories based on numbers as ideas that are attributed to Pythagqras but which in reality are much older. The most common mystical equation: a ten-string psaltery = the heavenly world; a seven- string cithern = the terrestrial world is based on the fact that the number 10 stands for perfection and 7 stands for sacrifice. According to Clement of Alexandria, the seven-string cithern also stands for the psalmist, the one, above all, who bears the sound offering. The ancient theories on the special virtues of each musical mode have also lasted, though this ethos is based on a purely astrological doctrine.14 It is true that these theories are referred to as remnants of classical anti- quity and are rarely directly applied to precisely Gregorian modes; but, aside from this, it will take some time before they disappear completely in modal theories. In another study15 1 have shown that the old mystical equations between sounds and animal symbols continued to have a basic funtion in the Prae- fatio, the only moment of the mass in which the Roman liturgy mentions Ezekiel 'stetramorphs: the lion, the ox, man (or the peacock), and the eagle. In this psalmody the four sounds fa, mi, re, do are mere musical symbols of the four beings just mentioned. On the other hand, there is no lack of authors who deny that music has any direct efficacy: "vult laudari a nobis (Deus) non quod laus nostra quid- quam conférât illi, sed ut habeat causam benefaciendi nobis" (Bruno Carthus, Expos, in psalm. 41). Even the great importance placed upon exact intonation is relegated to a lower level, because many authors claim 19</page><page sequence="18">that the thought and pureness of heart are more important than the right voice (St.Jerome, Comment, in Epist. ad Ephes., Ill, 5, 19). In contrast to the ancient theory of the primacy and union of word and sound, Christian musical doctrine has made a clear distinction between the movement of word and that of sound. When discussing music it gives no importance to the "creative power" of sound, but limits itself to speak- ing about the moral itas artis musicae, that is, how the song, either practi- cally or esthetically can augment devotion. This explains how the austere style of the ars psallendi, which has absolutely no aesthetic intent, was almost the only sector of Gregorian chant in whose theory there remained traces of the ideas that the anima natura/iter Christiana had developed from ancient times about the value of the words as they are chanted in psalms. Since psalmody is the oldest form of Gregorian chant, it seems legitimate to deduce that the ideology of the psalms corresponds to what Gregorian chant meant in early times: the sacrifice of individualism the singer makes when he sings in the choir (that is, the sacrifice of his vital breath) in order to open the way for the Holy Spirit, to perform good works, and to live the Christian life. In conclusion, we might say that some of the old ideas seemed to have survived in practice, but even more of them remained on a subconscious level, even though official doctrine paid little attention to them. While the medieval writers of musical treatises continued to teach the different vir- tues (ethos) of musical modes, the musical and astrological bases of these theories had already been discredited. Christian doctrine substituted the idea of compunctio cordis motivated by moralitas artis musicae for the older belief in the ethos of the modes and in man's catharsis through song (the sacrifice of his voice). Moreover, it adhered strictly to the Biblical term Verbo and rejected the idea of pure sound rhythm or the mystical syllable; thus the latter was shorn of all the magnificent virtues that the pre-Christian world hat attributed to it and vox cantata was subordinated to vox secreta. Although the dualistic doctrine was refuted, the idea of sacrifice found a new basis wherein the chanted voice ceased to be a primordial element. From then on chanting was praising God, but it stopped being a genuinely creative act. 20</page><page sequence="19">To the extent that musical symbols (which at first were considered to be realities) existed, they underwent a change which led to the creation of a scale of values based on the degree to which they participate in reality: identity, symbol, allegory and metaphor are other terms to indicate this descending scale of degree of reality. It is difficult to determine what posi- tion in this scale of values various documents concerning music should occupy. Having said that, I must terminate my investigation and put it into the more expert hands of the theologians. Notes 1 . Because of the link between all the musical modes, which seem historically to have developed according to the cycle of fifths (f, c, g, d, a, etc.), the a mode, for example, includes, in addition to its dominant (d), the secondary subdominants (g, c and a), inherited from the previous modes d, g and c.

Er erschließt sich nicht allein über seine Musik, sondern die Gebetsübung ist notwendig, um einen Zugang zu ihm zu finden. Er liegt auf halbem Wege zwischen dem gesprochenen Wort des Gebets und der reinen mystischen Kontemplation, denn er beruht auf konkreten Wörtern, deren logi- sche Bedeutung in einigen Fällen impliziert wird, in anderen bis an die Grenzen des hy- perlogischen Denkens vorstößt. Im Gegensatz zu anderen Kulturen, in de- nen der Gesang in der religiösen Praxis eine große Rolle spielt - schon deshalb, weil er mit dem Symbolismus von creatio und sacri- ficium verbunden ist und daraus seine Kraft bezieht -, ist dem Gregorianischen Gesang ein Ausdruck religiöser Unterwerfung eigen. Trotzdem läßt sich nicht leugnen, daß ihm Reste archaischer Vorstellungen anhaften, die sich in der Praxis erhalten haben, wenn auch der größte Teil auf einer unbewußten Stufe geblieben sein dürfte. Marius Schneider Le chant grégorien et la voix humaine (résumé) Le chant grégorien est une forme de prière. Il ne peut être compris uniquement à travers sa musique, mais doit être approché par l'expérience de la prière. Il se situe à mi- chemin entre le mot prononcé de la prière et la pure contemplation mystique, puisqu'il est fondé sur des mots concrets, dont le sens lo- gique est sous-entendu dans certains cas, et s'étend jusqu'aux frontières de la pensée hy- perlogique dans d'autres. Contrairement à d'autres cultures où le chant a une grande importance dans la prati- que religieuse - entre autres parce qu'il est associé au symbolisme de la création et du sacrifice, d'où son pouvoir - le chant grégo- rien a une attitude de religieuse soumission. On ne peut toutefois pas nier que ce dernier contient des vestiges d'idées archaïques qui ont survécu dans la pratique, mais dont la plus grande partie est probablement restée à un niveau subconscient. 22</page></plain_text>
