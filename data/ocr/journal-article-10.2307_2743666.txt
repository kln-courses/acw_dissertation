Joyce What interests prompted the production of human images in the indigenous cultures of Central America? This question is ex- plored here by counterposing three diverse yet interconnected tra- ditions of human representation: those of the Classic Lowland Maya, the Honduran Ulua-Polychrome makers, and the Lower Central American cultures of Nicaragua and Costa Rica. Disjunc- tions in the contexts of use and disposal of human images dem- onstrate different selective gender stereotypes in these three tradi- tions and indicate that the contrast between the household and the public arena is of varying concern. When these images are placed in local developmental chronologies it becomes apparent that the production of public representations of stereotyped male and female actions that are disjunctive (varying in media or in the contrasts selected for emphasis) is associated with episodes of intensification of social stratification. The production of hu- man representations in these societies may be a means through which the negotiation of men's and women's social status took place during times of change. ROSEMARY A. JOYCE is Associate Professor of Anthropology at Harvard University (Cambridge, Mass. 02I38, U.S.A.). Born in i956, she was educated at Cornell University (B.A., I978) and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (Ph.D., i985). She has been Assistant Curator (i985-86) and Assistant Director (i986-89) of the Peabody Museum at Harvard and curator of the reinstallation of the museum's Latin American gallery in i992 and of an exhibit on pre-Columbian archaeology at Heritage Plan- tation, Sandwich, Mass., in i99I. Her fieldwork includes survey and excavation in the Ulua River valley and the Department of Yoro in Honduras. Her research interests center on social com- plexity in pre-Columbian Mesoamerica and Central America. Among her publications are "The Ulua Valley and the Coastal Maya Lowlands: The View from Cerro Palenque," in The South- east Classic Maya Zone, edited by Gordon R. Willey and Eliza- beth Boone (Washington, D.C.: Dumbarton Oaks Foundation, i988), "The Construction of the Maya Periphery and the Mayoid Image of Honduran Polychrome Ceramics," in Reinterpreting the Prehistory of Central America, edited by Mark Miller Graham (Boulder: University of Colorado Press, in press), Cerro Palenque: Power and Identity on the Maya Periphery (Austin: University of Texas Press, I99i), and the editing of Tatiana Proskouriakoff's Maya History (Austin: University of Texas Press, I993). The pres- ent paper was submitted in final form 3 XI 92. In i982, while conducting excavations at the Terminal Classic site of Cerro Palenque, in Honduras's Ulua Val- ley (fig. i), I encountered a pair of cached figurines in the central platform of a small residential group (Joyce I99I:48, 95-96, I07, II4-I5). Both were fine, mold- made, hollow human figures. They had been buried, ap- parently standing upright, in small pits east and west of an exotic stone slab. The eastern figurine depicted a per- son dressed in a bird-feather costume with a bird-head helmet, holding a conch-shell horn. This figure wore ear spools and a rectangular bead collar above a bare chest. The lower portion was too eroded to reconstruct, but the lack of breasts indicated that the figure depicted was male. The paired western figurine was better preserved. It depicted a woman wearing an ankle-length skirt, ear spools, and rectangular plaque pendant. Her exposed chest was marked by clearly modeled breasts. Her left hand was raised, grasping her hair. On her head was bal- anced a two-handled, necked jar identical in proportions and profile to examples recovered in excavations in the group, forms probably used to contain liquids. The pairing of these figurines suggested that they rep- resented a duality, the interdependent members of the household which made its home in the residential group. Debris from around the central platform con- tained a suite of artifacts-censers, decorated jars, and obsidian blades-characteristic of apparent sites of rit- ual at Cerro Palenque. The artifacts and caches rein- forced the identification of this central platform as a household shrine based on analogy with Maya sites such as Mayapan (Proskouriakoff I962; Smith I97I:I08-9). The placement of the figurines in this location indicated that they carried significant symbolic weight. A consideration of Honduran figurines with similar themes and comparison with others in neighboring Classic Maya and Lower Central American societies allow me to suggest an interpretation of the nature of these figurines and the significance of their careful placement. In each of these areas, a subset of human figurines represents women actively engaged in the work that sustained the household. Differences in the precise nature of men's and women's contributions highlighted by human figures in different media illumi- nate the interplay of gender, labor, and social stratifica- tion in neighboring Classic Maya, Honduran, and Lower Central American societies. Production of human im- ages, waxing and waning through time, may have been one response to tensions in social relations within households undergoing social stratification. Representation and Social Life Treating the production of anthropomorphic images as a cultural means of responding to and shaping the condi- tions of social existence is a semiotic enterprise that requires confrontation of the nature of representation, the status of these particular representations as signs, and my approach to their interpretation. I attempt what 255</page><page sequence="2">.2561| CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY Volume 34, Number 3, June I993 Yucatan Xi ) Maya Lowlands 5Campeche q Altar d *g X &lt; Copul. ; &lt; ~~~Honduras 5Cmayagua &lt; Nicoya t w ~~~~Atlarntic\ \ ~~~Watershz Lower Diquis Central Amenica FIG.

The Ulua Valley includes the sites Cerro Palenque, Travesia, Playa de los Muertos, Las Flores Bolsa, Santa Rita, and Santa Ana; the Comayagua Valley is the location of the walled hilltop site Tenampua. Only Sperber (i992:63) has called "an epidemiology of repre sentations," which "is not about representations but about the process of their distribution." Sperber argues that representations begin as mental constructs which when given material form, become public and in turr may be transformed into new mental representations by others who encounter them. The spread of each series of representations through social networks affects th( spread of other representations. The beginning point o: my analysis, then, is the stipulation that the anthropo. morphic images I discuss are such representations. These representations are iconic, suggesting aspects of human appearance and behavior through resem. blance, and, as Michael Herzfeld (i992:68-69) notes "iconic relations, . . . because they either 'look natural or can be 'naturalized,' are a good deal more labile [than symbols, 'arbitrary' signs], and lend themselves with particular ease to totalizing cultural ideologies." The careful selection of attributes for depiction in these im- ages is less obvious because they appear to be chosen merely to establish resemblance. The selection of fea- tures to be incorporated in human images is a means by which stereotypes of natural or essential human behav- ior may be promulgated. In order to approach the rela- tionships between the inaccessible mental constructs of makers and users of these human images and the public representations to which we do have access, I assume that no detail is simply natural or accidental, the selec- tion of attributes being part of a dialogic process of con- struction of human identities.</page><page sequence="3">JOYCE Women's Work 1 257 In order to explicate some of the possible associations that these representations may crystallize, I treat eacb image as a distilled narrative, in Roland Barthes's (I977a:73) words a "pregnant moment": "In order to tell a story, the painter possesses only one moment. . . [the image] will be a hieroglyph in which can be read at a glance . . . the present, the past, and the future, i.e. the historical meaning of the represented gesture." In Barthes's analysis, single still images imply a sequence of actions preceding and following the depicted mo- ment, and "all images are polysemous; they imply, un- derlying their signifiers, a 'floating chain' of signifieds, the reader able to choose some and ignore others" (I977c:38-39). The signs united in a narrative are bound in a relationship of "double implication: two terms pre- suppose one another," transforming chronological or- der to a logical binding "capable of integrating back- wards and forwards movements" through the narrative (I 977b:I0I, i2o-22). These metonymic links, sequences of actions that lead up to and away from the image, rather than the metaphoric symbolism of the elements of each image, are the focus of my analysis (for the dis- tinction, see Barthes I977b:92-IoI; I977C:48-5I). A multiplicity of possible narratives underlies each still image, and in Barthes's approach there are no grounds to privilege one reading beforehand (Olsen i990). This multiplicity of possible narratives (or, to use Sperber's terms, of mental representations responding to the public representation) makes the human images I am investigating a medium for active constructions of social identity. In order to delimit the social significance of these representations, I undertake an analysis of what Herzfeld calls "metapatterns": "relations between rela- tions" that "allow individual agents to organize the oth- erwise chaotic indeterminacies of social existence. The recognition of a recurrent design is thus not simply an understanding of what is out there; it is a reading of a reading" (I9 92:69, emphasis added). No one of these images can be treated as having a unitary inherent meaning, but in contrast to others it may draw attention to specific dimensions of social dif- ferentiation. "At each level of social organization, the relations between insiders and outsiders are ordered ac- cording to topically distinctive principles, but they al- ways remain predicated on the distinction between the inside and the outside of whatever social group is in question. This is disemia, a mode of organizing social knowledge through cultural form" (Herzfeld I992:79). My analysis is an exploration of a particular instance of disemia evident in disjunctive gender imagery. This exploration requires simultaneous attention to relations of similarity and relations of difference. I em- ploy two scales of comparison which facilitate this ex- ploration, one internal to individual societies, the other encompassing a series of linked societies extending across southern Central America. Locally, metapatterns are evident as "ordered sets of relationships" or recur- rent combinations of patterns in multiple domains of cultural expression within a particular society (Herzfeld I992:71). My analysis pinpoints gender complementar- ity (in ritual action, in work, and in public representa- tions) as a recurrent pattern. From the regional perspec- tive, "we can compare cultural patterns that exist on a strictly local scale with further-flung patterns of essen- tially the same type" and "discover some correlations that would, after all, permit a degree of interpretation that does not depend upon verbal exegesis" (Herzfeld I992:79). I suggest that topical emphases on the inter- play of gender, productive labor, ritual, and warfare as aspects of the formation and maintenance of households and wider social networks are permissible interpreta- tions of the relationships of gender imagery in different representations within and among these cultures. Gender Imagery in Honduran Ceramics In the Ulua Valley of Honduras, ceramics were the pre- ferred medium for depiction of the human form. The earliest images of human beings are Middle Formative figurines of the Playa de los Muertos culture (Agurcia I978). Produced between 6oo and 2oo B.C., these solid, fine-paste, hard, lustrous-surfaced figurines were indi- vidually hand-modeled. Each, consequently, is almost unique. They usually depict female figures with little clothing and with clearly delineated sexual characteris- tics (fig. 2).1 Several represent a woman and child. Playa figurines stand or sit cross-legged or with one knee drawn up. They may raise one hand to the head or hold a small pot on the knee (Strong, Kidder, and Paul I938:pI.I5). Playa figurines are distinguished by elabo- rate treatment of hair, bracelets, nose and ear orna- ments, and collars. Belts supporting short aprons appear on some figurines. The individuality and great elabora- tion of the headdresses and ornaments suggests that these figurines may signify relatively specific, perhaps individual, social identities. These early figurines are found within residential groups, either discarded in trash or, in a few instances, in burials under house floors (Popenoe I934). On the basis of a review of the data on Middle Formative occu- pations across Honduras, I have suggested that such sub- floor burials embodied the social identity of the group, created as competition between households began to i. My generalizations about Playa de los Muertos figurines and other figurines discussed below are based on my examination of the collections of the Peabody Museum (over i6o whole or partial figurines correspond to the types specifically discussed) and others I have excavated. Quantification of these generalizations would be meaningless, since there is no basis for arguing that any of these samples is statistically representative of a defined population. I define a range of variation within these traditions with the proviso that other samples may extend this range. Nursing infants, promi- nent breasts, the depiction of female genitalia, and lack of male genitalia are the features I use to characterize the biological sexual identity represented by these figurines. None of the Peabody Mu- seum figurines has depictions of male genitalia, while several do depict female genitalia (both labia and breasts). Breasts are not shown on at least one Playa de Los Muertos figurine with labia, suggesting that breasts indicate something more than female bio- logical sexuality although incidentally allowing that assignment.</page><page sequence="4">258 1 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY Volume 34, Number 3, June I993 FIG. 2.

The production of figurines with elaborate individualistic omamenta- tion may have been a means for the creation of common bonds within the household and distinction from other households. The production of figurines faded into insignificance during the succeeding Late Formative period, and only a few solid figurines derived from the Playa de los Muertos type have been encountered. Figurines were reintro- duced, in an apparently independent tradition which I call "La Mora," at the beginning of the Late Classic, or Ulua Polychrome, period.2 The first La Mora effigies (e.g., Gordon i898:pl. 9, n; Glass I966:fig. 5f; Strong, Kidder, and Paul 1938: pl. 6a) were made during a time of great cultural change and are technologically similar to the new early Ulua Polychrome period ceramic ves- sels being introduced at the same time (pl. I). Relatively large, hollow, and thin-walled, with a tempered fabric and well-polished brown to pink surfaces, these effigies sometimes have an orange slip or postfire blue, yellow, 2. Because this paper relates Honduras to both the neighboring Maya and Lower Central American cultures, terminologies relating to both areas are employed. "Late Classic" is the term borrowed from Maya archaeology applied to the entire span during which Honduran people made and used orange-slipped polychrome ce- ramics with cylinder forms. Most excavators agree that by A.D. 6oo orange-slipped polychrome ceramics had become common in Honduran sites and that they persisted until after A.D. 85o (Hirth, Kennedy, and Cliff I989, Joyce I99I, Urban and Schortman I987). Baudez (I966), drawing on Lower Central American parallels, has suggested the term "Polychrome period" for the span A.D. 5 50-950 marked by the development of the Ulua polychromes. I use "Ulua Polychrome period" to refer to developments marked by changes in these polychromes, distinguishing between early, middle, and late episodes in their development, with maximal estimated dates of A.D. 400-650, 650-750, and 750-950 (Joyce i992b).</page><page sequence="5">JOYCE Women's Work I 259 FIG. 3.

La Mora figurines are an altemative format within a unified production technology for the introduction of figural representation, the most striking innovation of the early phase of poly- chrome production in the Ulua Valley (Joyce I992b). These two kinds of ceramic figural representation present a significant thematic dichotomy associated with gender. The human images on the earliest Ulua polychromes are standing or seated figures in elaborate feathered costume (pI. 2a). Although their features are highly attenuated, they are demonstrably based on the human form and include clearly delineated hands and feet with five digits, fingernails, and toenails. These figures wear high feathered headdresses and may hold round and elongated feathered objects that, although not identifiable as specific icons, suggest ritual implements. Their costumes do not cover the chest, which lacks any indication of female sexual characteristics. La Mora figurines, in contrast, appear exclusively to represent fe- males, signaled by their exposed breasts. They wear elaborate headdresses and ear, wrist, ankle, neck, and sometimes nose ornaments hut are otherwise un- clothed. These female figures are shown in a limited number of poses. Some hold infants on a knee or nursing at a breast. Others hold a bowl in which applique pellets stand for contents that resemble maize tamales in Maya images (see Taube I989). One holds a hand to her hair or headdress in a gesture identical to the much later and technologically distinct female figurine from the cache at Cerro Palenque. Beginning in the middle phase of polychrome produc- tion, while large La Mora effigies continued to be made, other figurines were produced using a new technology. Smaller molds and a much finer ceramic fabric were used to make small hollow figurines and figurine whis- tles. They include examples with headdresses like La Mora effigies, kneeling with hands on knees or holding a pot (Strong, Kidder, and Paul I938:fig. 7i, 7s), but ap- parently not the woman with nursing child (fig. 3). A wider range of themes is introduced with these figurine whistles, including animals, humanoid figures carrying a pot or pack on the back (some with animal faces or masks), and the first identifiable males (fig. 4).4 3. At Santa Rita, La Mora effigies were found in levels that repre- sent an early Ulua Polychrome occupation (Joyce i987:29i-96). La Mora effigies were present in early Ulua Polychrome contexts in my excavations at Travesia and those of Kevin Pope at CR 2i2 (personal communication, i983). La Mora effigies in the Peabody collections were excavated at Santa Ana and Las Flores Bolsa in contexts representing the latest Ulua Polychrome. La Mora effigies disappear from each of these sites in the final Terminal Classic levels, when fine-paste ceramics replace Ulua polychromes (ca. A.D. 850-950). 4. Small mold-made figurine whistles representing males in the Peabody collections stem from levels at Santa Rita associated with the middle Ulua Polychrome (Joyce i987:292-93) and intermediate levels at Santa Ana with similar ceramics. Male figurines were also found in upper levels at Santa Ana, from the late Ulua Polychrome. Figurines are classified as male on the basis of costumes incorporat- ing loincloths and exposed chests lacking depictions of breasts. Animal imagery (feathered costumes, bird-head helmets, and coni- cal hats with an animal head at the peak) is apparent on all well- preserved examples. The use of animal skin in male costume, con- trasting with woven textiles in female costume, is also part of the systematic construction of gender distinctions in contemporary Maya imagery (Joyce igg2a).

This new body of figurines is part of a general increase in diversity in ceramic assemblages along the Ulua River. Ulua polychromes themselves have distinctive local variants, with animals, especially monkeys, be- coming prominent themes (Joyce I992b; pI. 2b). Red- painted jars vary in form, fabric, and decorative motifs almost from site to site, in contrast with their virtual identity in earlier periods (Joyce I987). Trade wares found at different sites signal distinctive extemal con- nections (Sheptak I987, Joyce I986). At the same time, figurines remain the only medium in which females are depicted. The implicit gender com- plementarity evident in the early Ulua Polychrome- costumed male figures on vessels making gestures with exotic objects that may represent ritual, figurines repre- senting women as mothers and as those responsible for providing food-is perpetuated with the increase in types of figurines during later phases. Polychrome cylin- ders continue to depict men engaged in what is now more clearly ritual: walking in processions holding staffs and musical instruments, gesturing toward a cen- tral icon topped by a bird, confronting an anthropomor- phic figure emerging from a serpent (P1. 2C). Male figu- rines wear elaborate costumes, particularly headdresses, that link them to the figures on the pictorial ceramics. Gestures that associate women with production and re- production in La Mora effigies are copied in some of the new figurines. The implication that these male and female images represent complementary roles is empha- sized by rare double figurines which depict a male and a female figure in one object (e.g., Stone I957:fig. 56D). The ceramics with human figural representations were used within the household as were the figurines in the Cerro Palenque cache. Ulua Polychrome bowls and dishes were common service ware. Polychrome cylin- ders, which feature the highest proportion of human figures, come from specialized household ceremonial contexts such as dedicatory caches, rituals, and perhaps burials (Joyce I922b), and figurines, when not simply disposed of in general refuse, come from the same kinds of contexts. Ceramic depictions of the human figure, throughout their history in the Ulua Valley, are public representations within the household groups that make up these societies. A comparison with practices in neighboring Classic Maya and Lower Central American societies sheds light on the possible significance of these patterns. Gender and Labor in Pre-Hispanic Maya Society In the Classic Maya imagery of gender (Joyce I 992C) there is a dichotomy between monumental images and small-scale ceramic images of human figures.5 Monu- Ulua Polychrome levels at Santa Ana have simple tubular bodies without costume or anatomical details beyond the mold-made head. The prevalence of animal masks suggests that they may also represent males. 5. Hand-modeled figurines comparable to those from Playa de los Muertos appear in the Maya Lowlands in the Middle Preclassic period (ca. 900-300 B.C.) and decline in frequency in the Late Pre- classic (Willey I972:7-8, I3-I4).

Pottery vessels and figurines are less public media. Their production is likely to have involved more people and to have escaped central political control (see Beaudry I984 for a discussion of decentralized produc- tion of polychrome ceramics in the Late Classic Copan Valley). They were sometimes used in burials and caches within residential groups, and most were disposed of in trash deposits created by the residents of these groups (Hammond I975:37I-74; Hendon I99I:909-Io; Willey I972:7-8, I978:7-9). Both monumental images and ceramic objects repre- sent gender dichotomies related to labor, with different degrees of explicitness. In Classic Maya monumental images with paired male and female figures, most ges- tures can be made by either, but a few are specific to one gender. Males alone hold the lance, the weapon used in warfare (fig. S a); females alone offer ceramic dishes or hold wrapped cloth bundles (fig. sb, c). The elements of each image metaphorically relate elite status to ritual action (Schele and Miller i986). They also metonymi- cally imply sequences of actions that lead up to the mo- ment pictured. While the surface topic is the enactment of ritual through the shared actions of men and women, unique gestures allow alternative readings. When male figures hold the shield and spear of warriors, their ac- tions in warfare are condensed in the scene. When fe- male figures hold cloth bundles and pottery dishes, their actions in food and cloth production are implied. The ceramic dishes and cloth bundles held by women in monumental images embody the end point of se- quences of production which transformed raw materials into culturally defined forms. Among the modern Maya of Zinacantan, Mexico, "male labour produces the raw materials, and female labour transforms them into ob- jects of use and consumption" (Devereaux i987:93). The work of women as spinners and weavers resulted in the cloth bundles held and elaborate robes worn by women in Classic Maya monuments. The ceramic bowls that contain ritual tools in monumental images are the ves- sel form depicted on pictorial ceramics as the container for round balls identified as corn tamales (Taube i989). Women's labor grinding corn and preparing food is im- plied by this vessel form. Gender imagery in painted ceramic vessels and molded figurines makes these associations explicit. A survey of Late Classic painted ceramic vessels from the Maya area (Foncerrada de Molina and Lombardo de Ruiz I979) illustrates numerous scenes with anthropomor- phic figures engaged in identifiable actions. Most figures are males engaged in ritual dancing, warfare and capture of prisoners, ritualized deer hunting, and the reception of visitors in a throne room. Explicitly female figures are shown as attendants in reception scenes or engaging in sexual relations with supernatural beings. In a separate study of more than 200 Maya polychrome vases, the fe- male figures pictured are described primarily as assisting male figures in rituals (Clarkson I978). It is possible that the vessels in these surveys, stemming from elite burials and caches, represent a skewed sample with images de- termined by their political ceremonial use. A sherd from the site of Lubaantun, Belize (Hammond I975:320, fig. ii6c), depicting a woman grinding corn on a metate, testifies that women's quotidian activities were also rep- resented in this medium. Considerably more abundant imagery of women and their labor is represented by Classic Maya ceramic figu- rines. One subset of figurines from the western Maya Lowlands depicts women in poses parallel to those in monumental images (Conides i984). Other figurines from both the eastern and the western Lowlands depict women producing food and textiles, fostering animals, and nurturing children. Weavers and spinners are noted particularly in the western Lowlands (e.g., Schele and Miller i986 :pl. s i). Images of women grinding corn and offering food in pots come from sites both east and west (fig. 6a-c; Clancy, Coggins, and Culbert i985:65). Figu- rines from both areas depict women holding infants, a reference to their reproductive role (fig. 6b; cf. T. Joyce I993: pl. 4, 8). Others hold small animals (fig. 6c; Clancy, Coggins, and Culbert i985:i59), recalling the significance in i6th-century Maya society of women's work raising animals for meat, important for ceremonial feasts,' and birds for feathers used in textile production (Pohl and Feldman i982). Accompanying these female figurines are others showing men enthroned, as deer hunters, as warriors, and as participants in ritual-the same activities evident in painted pottery (e.g., Ham- mond i988:figs. 5.3, 6.3; Clancy, Coggins, and Culbert i985:i63, I79). The deer hunts shown are clearly ritual- ized (Pohl i98i), and men's most basic productive role in this agrarian society, as farmer, is unattested. Large- and small-scale Classic Maya images of males present a consistent set of features representing men's public roles in ritual and political action. The pattern for images of females is more disjunctive. Ceramics rep- resent women actively engaged in the production of tex- tiles and foodstuffs. The same activities are implied by monumental stone images, but they are indicated more subtly through the metonymic links of the products of- fered by female figures engaged with male counterparts in ritual. The selection of these two aspects of women's labor for representation, however oblique, in monumen- tal images testifies to the political importance of these productive activities in relations between ruling elites and the nonruling elite and commoner households that supported them. The exclusion of other attributes of Classic (ca. A.D. 250), new traditions of mold-made ceramic figurine whistles were introduced in the Late Classic (ca. A.D. 600-930), contemporary with the florescence of polychrome painted ceramics with complex human imagery (Willey I972: I4). Ceramics with an- thropomorphic images depicting both males and females, most in- terpreted as representations of supernaturals, continue to be pro- duced in the northern Maya Lowlands throughout the Postclassic (Smith I97I), long after monumental human images had ceased to be produced in the aftermath of the political transformation labeled the Classic Maya collapse (ca. A.D. 800-iooo).</page><page sequence="10">262 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY Volume 34, Number 3, June 1993 rn)~~~~~~~~~~~~~{~ FIG. 5. Classic Maya monumental images.

This interplay between centralized authority and household interests in work and ritual is illuminated by accounts of i 6th-century Yucatec Maya society provided by the Spanish priest Diego de Landa (Tozzer I941). Landa stressed men's roles in warfare and ritual and de- scribed a range of productive activities for women essen- tially equivalent to those given material representation in Late Classic figurines. Women prepared food and raised animals within the household, notably birds whose feathers were used in weaving. They spun and wove and as curers were prominent in preparation for childbirth. Their participation in ritual varied between the household and the temple. All ritual included feast- ing, implicitly based on the conjunction of men's ag- ricultural labor and women's work in food preparation. Women's ritual role was to offer "presents of cotton stuffs, of food and drink and it was their duty to make the offerings of food and drink" (Tozzer I94I:I28), ac- tions implied by the unique gestures of female figures in Classic Maya monumental images. Women and men participated together in rituals which took place within the home (Tozzer I94I: I 54-5 5). Women's contribution to ritual was given public representation in the temple by a select group of older women, who danced holding bowls filled with offerings of food and bundles of special cloth that they wove (Tozzer I94I:I43-47).

Classic Maya ceramic images subtly represent women's role in reproduction and more directly women's productive labor in the stereotyped roles of weaver and cook at all levels of society (see Hendon i99I:902 for evidence of weaving in elite households at Copan). Monumental images indirectly represent women's labor through the objects held by female fig- ures in scenes of ritual action. Two different levels of the social construction of gender are embodied in these representations. Within the household the image of woman as mother, spinner, weaver, and cook is cele- brated as counterpart in this unit of social production and reproduction to man as warrior and ritual prac- titioner. Monumental images subordinate depictions of female labor to participation in ritual sequences and avoid overt reference to female sexuality. Like ritual in the i6th-century Yucatec Maya temples, where partici- pation was restricted to a select group of older women, Classic Maya monumental images were produced under centralized political control. They represent woman as complement to man in ritual and political action, as part of a single elite class with unitary interests. Gender Imagery, Labor, and Social Stratification Classic Maya society presents two distinct sets of gender imagery, each emphasizing interdependence of male and female, in ceramics and monumental images. In con- trast, in the contemporary Ulua Valley, ceramics are a single medium for human representation. Painted poly- chrome vessels, exotic in their inspiration, an eclectic synthesis of Maya conventions of representation with local technology, forms, and functions, are the material form for public representations of male figures engaged in ritual. As public representations of women, the large, hollow La Mora effigies are more traditional in technol- ogy and theme. Their use of orange slip and red paint links them to indigenous styles of decorated ceramics. Their depiction of naked females with elaborate head- dresses and jewelry recalls the Playa de los Muertos fig- urines of earlier epochs. All three of their poses-the woman with child, the kneeling woman holding a pot, and the woman with hand touching her hair-are shared with these earlier figurines.6 Late Classic ceramicists were exposed to the earlier figurine tradition through the recovery and curation of Playa figurines, presumably from deposits exposed by the active rivers. Stone (I94I:70-7I, 73-75, figs. 68, 74) reports parts of two Playa figurines from late Ulua Poly- chrome levels at Travesia. My own excavations at Travesia exposed evidence of human occupation from the entire Ulua Polychrome period but not Middle For- mative levels that might be blamed for the accidental inclusion of these figurines in late deposits. I suggest 6. The vessels represented in La Mora effigies-handleless, round- sided, sometimes with a low, flaring neck or collar-are consistent in form with contemporary full-scale unslipped or red-slipped in- cised collared jars and orange-slipped, red-on-orange, or poly- chrome bowls (e.g., at Cerro Palenque [Joyce I99I:I04-I51 and Co- pan [Hendon I99I:898-9041). The exteriors, however, may be vertically grooved, and one has an incised squared step-fret. These images may be modeled on vertically grooved and geometrically incised serving vessels of earlier periods (e.g., Strong, Kidder, and Paul i983:pl.

Where Ulua polychromes assert an identification with Maya culture through the depiction of costumed ritualists accompanied by texts, La Mora figurines assert an indigenous, and indeed a household-based, identity. The conflicting messages of these two kinds of human imagery develop in the context of competition within the Ulua Valley for differential social status. They re- flect divergent interests within these societies as social stratification touched men's and women's lives in differ- ent ways. A comparison with contemporary gender imagery in Lower Central America is illuminating.7 Lower Central American societies are generally regarded as less strat- ified than Classic Maya and other Mesoamerican groups. More precisely, these societies continued to be actively involved in the negotiation of differential social sta- tus through to the i6th century (Snarskis i98ia:i8), whereas Classic Maya society was in the later stages of institutionalization of social class distinctions. Hondu- ran societies have usually been viewed through the lens of the Maya, with whom they were undoubtedly in- volved in significant interaction. But they were also in contact with Lower Central America, and in their inter- nal social processes they may more closely approximate these southern neighbors. From their earliest appearance, Lower Central Ameri- can human representations differ in several ways from Maya and Honduran examples.8 Both male and female figures with explicit genitalia are represented. There is no split between the ceramic media depicting males and females, with figurines and effigy vessels depicting males and females in unified decorative traditions. Male figures identified as shamans gaze into mirrors, sit or stand, are dressed in animal costumes or masks (pl. 3a). Female figures hold vessels and children (pl. 3b). While male and female actions are differentiated, both male and female figures are shown seated on benches that may represent perishable wooden or carved stone seats (pl. 3c), a mark of high social status (Snarskis i98ib:i9i; Graham i 98 I: I I 8). Public representations of the human figure on objects used in the household group both in everyday life and in ritual do not reflect the divisions seen in Maya and Honduran human images. Human figural representation in stone, continuing after ceramic human images decline, makes this point even clearer.9 Early stone sculpture was incorporated in elite burials, while later stone sculpture formed a perma- nent part of public spaces used for ceremony, and Gra- ham (i98i:I3i) argues that this indicates centraliza- tion-a shift from the marking of individuals (and, I would add, households) to the marking of more inclu- sive social groups. Multiple examples of a few stereo- typed human poses characterize the late stone sculp- tural tradition (fig. 7). Male figures, interpreted as shamans, are seated with knees drawn up, sometimesg holding a tube to the mouth (variously described as a cigar, flute, or sucking tube for curing [Snarskis ig8ib:2I4]). Standing male figures hold a trophy head and axe (fig. 7a), the latter a form with archaeological examples with human-femur handles (Snarskis ig8ib:.2ii). Bound male prisoners are also depicted. Standing female figures grasp both breasts with their hands, a gesture that Graham (i98i:I30) identifies as symbolic of fertility. One pose is shared by males and females: standing, they hold in both hands objects, in- cluding rattles, that have been identified as ritual tools (Snarskis 198 Ib:2 I7; fig. 7b, c). While the public role of warrior was represented as a male monopoly, the female role in reproduction seems to have been offered as a counterpart of comparable social significance, and both male and female participation in ritual is commemo- rated. Despite increasing social stratification, the public representation of a separate sphere of male action, war- fare, does not replace the public representation of inter- dependence of men and women. Public representations of women's contribution to reproduction may have been an active reponse to the potential erosion of women's status that celebration of men's role in warfare could have fostered. Honduran gender images tell a distinct story. Here, men with access to and knowledge of Maya culture cre- ated or commissioned images of ritual specialization on objects used within the household that left women out. La Mora effigies brought women's contribution back into the record of public representations, playing on tra- ditional values and selecting for emphasis women's con- tribution to social continuity through food production and reproduction. Tension within these early Ulua Poly- chrome-using households about men's and women's statuses in a rapidly changing world may underlie the creation of these representations. Ulua Valley societies were, at this time, in the process of substantial central- 7. My discussion of Lower Central American human imagery is based on a review of published surveys of ceramics and stone sculp- ture (Snarskis I98Ia, i98ib, i982; Graham I98I; Abel-Vidor et al. i987). Archaeologically, "Lower Central America" includes three distinct zones (see Snarskis Ig8Ia): the Pacific Coast of Nicaragua and adjacent Costa Rica (Greater Nicoya), the Atlantic Coast and adjacent highlands (the Atlantic Watershed), and the southern Pa- cific Coast of Costa Rica (Diquis). 8. The development of human imagery in this area takes place from late Period IV (maximally IOOO B.C-A.D. 500) to early Period VI (A.D. IOOO-I550). 9. In the Nicoya region and the Atlantic Watershed during late Period IV, three related forms of stone sculpture develop that con- tinue to be produced in Period V: small greenstone axes and orna- ments, mace heads, and tripod metates with animal and anthropo- morphic figures (Graham i 98 I: I I 3-22). Graham argues that these items relate to warfare and agricultural production as bases of so- cial authority. He suggests that the anthropomorphic figures on the metates, which have animal heads or masks and humanoid bodies with exposed male genitalia, are engaged in ritual sacrifice by decapitation of war captives. He sees the tradition of free- standing human figural sculpture that emerges in the Atlantic Wa- tershed and Diquis in late Period V and continues in Period VI as originating in these metate figures.</page><page sequence="13">JOYCE Women's Work I 265 ?N 1~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~.,N 1 FIG. 7.

Multiple centers with specialized public ar- chitecture recalling that of Maya sites developed, and the households associated with these centers had differ- ential access to exotic resources such as obsidian, ma- rine shell, and greenstone. Greater elaboration of some residential groups suggests that labor was also differen- tially available. The imagery of Ulua polychromes placed claims to affiliation with distant societies in con- stant view, creating an identity which transcended the individual household. The explosion of diverse human imagery and of ce- ramic diversity in general in the later stages of the Ulua Polychrome period reflects the limited degree to which centralized political control was in fact achieved. Indi- vidual sites remained no larger than 2oo to 300 struc- tures until the unique development of Cerro Palenque, with almost 6oo structures, in the Terminal Classic (Joyce I99i). The distance between these largest centers was often no more than 5-I0 km. No evidence supports the domination of any substantial proportion of the val- ley by any one center. Instead, the Late Classic Ulua Valley appears to have remained divided among many competing centers, joined in networks of interaction given material symbolic representation in Ulua poly- chromes. The mechanism for connections between the centers may well have been common participation in ceremony, as the imagery of the polychromes and later male figurines suggests. Competition among centers may have relied on the same social networks and cere- monial occasions. Representation of warriors is limited to the very latest Ulua polychromes associated with the walled hilltop site, Tenampua, in the Comayagua Val- ley. In the competitive networks of the Late Classic Ulua Valley, the contributions of households were ap- parently crucial, and women's labor was given recogni- tion complementing that accorded men's participation in ritual. The distinctive imagery of La Mora figurines, empha- sizing female production and reproduction, became less pronounced as mold-made figurine whistles presented images of males and females in complementary action. The female figurine paired with its male counterpart at Cerro Palenque may represent female participation in ritual within the household group. The necked vessel carried by this figure is a form most often found at Cerro Palenque in association with evidence of ritual. Jars of this kind may have contained brewed beverages, such as the maize and manioc chicha of modem peoples of Lower Central America, consumed in ritual. The imag- ery of these figurines reinforces the identity of the household group as a unit cooperating in ritual and sub- sistence. In highly stratified Maya society, ceramic images challenged any claim to centralized control by ruling elites with the reality of the potential economic self- sufficiency of the extended household (see Hendon i99i). Nonruling elites interested in asserting their own status celebrated the contributions women made to that goal. The weavers and spinners of Maya figurine tradi- tions, so notably absent from the otherwise similar La Mora figurines of the Ulua Valley, embody a kind of</page><page sequence="14">266 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY Volume 34, Number 3, June I993 production with important political ramifications in Mesoamerican societies, (compare Brumfiel I99I). The importance of textile production is evident at Classic Maya sites like Copan in the diversity of artifact classes that represent this craft (Hendon i99i). No similar ma- terial representation of textile production is found in Ulua Valley sites. Perhaps most tellingly, while decor- ated ceramic spindle whorls were produced and used at Late Classic Copan, the few examples from the Ulua Valley were made after the collapse of Ulua Polychrome culture. These spindle whorls signify not only the craft itself but the attribution of sufficient importance to it for labor to be devoted to the production of permanent, elaborated tools. While Ulua Valley societies clearly made textiles, as is indicated by the presence of bone weaving tools, they apparently used perishable materials or the plain ceramic disks found at some sites for their whorls. Conclusion In Classic Maya society, control of craft products pro- duced within the household must have been a crucial aspect of the struggle for political power (compare Sil- verblatt I988 for a review of ethnographic examples). Members of households had vested interests in acknowl- edging this contribution, given material form in ceramic images. Ruling elites, while including implicit refer- ences to household production through the incorpora- tion in their images of products of women's labor, down- played this distinction in favor of the cooperation in ritual of ruling elite men and women. In Lower Central America, the integrity of the household and men's and women's places within it were not at issue even as social stratification occurred. The practice of ritual, open to both male and female, was commemorated. While war- fare was represented as a male monopoly, it was bal- anced by representations of women's reproductive po- tential. Competition between Lower Central American societies apparently never threatened the recognition of women's contributions in either the public or the do- mestic sector. The Ulua Valley societies of the Ulua Polychrome pe- riod stand midway between those of the Maya Lowlands and Lower Central America. Competition for social sta- tus between neighboring communities was based in the first instance on affiliation with Maya partners, accom- plished through exchange of material goods and embod- ied in ritual practice represented as a male prerogative. Women's recourse to traditional values was given mate- rial form by La Mora effigies modeled after earlier Playa de los Muertos figurines. The explicit recognition of women's contribution to the production and reproduc- tion of the household resulted in the stabilization of their status and a more explicit celebration of comple- mentarity in later Ulua Valley society. In each of these societies public representations of hu- man images were a medium for the negotiation of male and female status. Lower Central American stone sculp- ture placed in the political arena unique public represen- tations of male and female. In Maya society ceramic im- ages responded to the monumental images of the ruling elite. In Sperber's (i992) terms, the spread of those pub- lic representations which are Classic Maya monumental images through the political-ceremonial networks of elites allowed the spread through nonruling and nonelite social networks of other representations given material form in small-scale ceramic images. The latter public representations in turn gave rise in Ulua Valley society to distinctive public representations of gender, work, and ritual through the development of polychrome ce- ramics and the La Mora effigies that balanced them. Here human representation eclectically incorporated traditional images of the female and exotic images of the male in a dialogue about difference and status. Comments WHITNEY DAVIS Department of Art History, Northwestern University, Evanston, Ill. 60208, U.S.A. 23 XII 92 This elegant paper shows that an archaeology of symbol- ism can be illuminating when it shakes off constraining interests in establishing types and defining styles. At the same time, it proves, once again, that nuanced chronol- ogy and subtle provenancing are indispensable. Joyce realizes that the object of symbolic archaeology is not, or not only, a motif type or a stylistic convention but rather the mutual definition of motifs and conven- tions that she calls (following Sperber) an "epidemiology of representations" and also understands (implicitly fol- lowing Bakhtin) as a "dialogic" relation (that is, a rela- tion in which one "voice" addresses or responds to other "voices"). But an "epidemiology" is not an anthropology or a psychology, even though it might be regarded as a sociology, a statement about the distribution of certain properties in the social group. The formal description of motifs and conventions in a distribution must still be converted, somehow, into an analysis of their meaning- ful conversation. Here the problem is that Joyce, assum- ing meaningful conversation, also assumes a model of what it must be like that underwrites her account of the distribution in the first place but is not, in itself, defended. The meanings of the form of the distribution are certainly not inherent in style itself, which says nothing about the reasons for or possible cultural sa- lience of morphological variations (see further Davis I989); they derive, instead, from what art historians usually call the iconological context, which we can de- fine, very roughly, as the contemporary rhetorical sig- nificance of form. Joyce makes at least two questionable, half-explicit assumptions about the rhetorical status of form: that the repetition of an earlier form (the Cerro Palenque figurines supposedly replicating the Playa de los Muertos figurines) is a basically conservative act of</page><page sequence="15">JOYCE Women's Work 1.267 legitimation, with "celebratory" potential, rather than (say) an ironic quotation of them and that a constant correlation or juxtaposition of forms is a "complemen- tarity" rather than (say) a contest or mere redundancy. Because we are given no clear reason for preferring these interpretations, the textuality of motif and style re- mains slightly out of focus. The reason seems to be that lingering structuralist ideas about the coherence of meaning and culture- chiefly the hypothesis that a conceptual system is an architecture of related binary pairs-elide the inflec- tional, rhetorical, and narrative differences that imply that a thought thought again is not the same thought (see further Davis i992a, b). Although Joyce signals in- terest in structuralist reasoning (vide her references to Barthes and Herzfeld), it is possible that because we tend to construe gender as an irreducibly binary phenomenon (despite experiential and theoretical evidence to the con- trary) Joyce tends to seek binary relations or "comple- mentarities" in this domain of representation in the past. Thus her analysis of the writing of gender in later Ulua Valley society implicitly adopts the following formula: A (traditional Ulua ) male: B (traditional Ulua) female + C (Maya) male: D (Maya) female + E (lower Central American) male: F (lower Central American) female = AC (later Ulua) male : BF (later Ulua) female. Understanding this "structure" as an "epidemiology" or "dialog" has the undeniable virtue of requiring both syn- chronic and diachronic analysis; it shows that certain forms are written out or erased (D, E) and others written in or reproduced (C, B/F): later Ulua Valley image mak- ers, Joyce argues, replicated elements of both Maya and lower Central American conceptual schemes for gender, synthesizing them with available indigenous tradition in responding to or actively constructing more contem- porary possibilities, including the facts of social strati- fication and interaction with other groups. Archaeolo- gists of the periods and areas in question will have to assess Joyce's social-historical hypotheses, that is, her explanation-which I do not find wholly convincing- for why A: B :: C: D :: E: F is written, in the later Ulua Valley, as AC: BF. But as far as I can see there is nothing in this process that requires it to be organized in the structuralists' sense, having something like the general form I have just given. Indeed, the very idea that there is a structure to the process at all (or, to use a closely related jargon, a "structurational" operation) sits uneas- ily with the counterthrusting notion, implicitly ac- cepted by Joyce, that cultural forms are inherently di- verse and interactive (see further Davis n.d.). In classic structuralist reasoning, of course, lower-level pairs are mediated (in the "structuring" or "structurational" op- erations) into a higher-level unity by way of intermedi- ates that assimilate properties on both sides of the ratio sign(s); it is supposedly C: F that mediates A: B into AC: BF in the later Ulua Valley. But this imposed struc- ture also forces other phenomena of writing into one or another binary slot or ignores them altogether; writing differences in the material are being excluded by Joyce's method, among them the apparent marking of difference between Playa de los Muertos "female" figurines with labia only and figurines with labia and breasts, a possibly salient difference that Joyce remarks but does not pur- sue. If B, the traditional Ulua image of women, is already B', B", and so on, then its later mediation in BF-in the paper, it appears as a smooth transformation-is actu- ally far less complete, and far less stable, than Joyce lets on. Joyce's provocative paper, then, sits in a halfway house between typology and hermeneutics, between ico- nography and iconology, between grammatical and rhe- torical (or narratological) analysis, and between structur- alist or "structurational" and poststructuralist theories of culture. But sometimes a halfway house is the best place to be when we're on the move. ALICE B. KEHOE Department of Social and Cultural Sciences, Marquette University, Milwaukee, Wis. 53233, U.S.A. 2 I 93 Joyce has admirably presented an epidemiology of repre- sentations of humans from the southern Maya and bor- derlands. One aspect of her paper that interests me is that she indicates, as Karen Bruhns and I did at the I992 Chacmool Conference in Calgary, that along the borders of Mesoamerica elements of the major Mesoamerican cultures were selected and combined with indigenous traditions to create distinctive independent national configurations; this selection and (frequently) modifica- tion blur the relationships between the major powers and the borderland nations. Joyce notes that the borderlands' representations of women are apparently without class signifiers while the Classic Maya represent two classes of women, elite and workers. Maya elite women, like the ladies of Classical Athens shown on Attic vases, ideally spun, wove, and prepared food with their own hands, yet the clear depic- tion of lower-class women as well in Maya and Greek art suggests that in both societies elite women probably conspicuously occupied themselves with ornamental work while the bulk of textiles and food was produced by commoners. In the smaller nations of the border- lands, in contrast, the lack of representations of laboring women implies that labor was the lot of all women, a universal condition that did not require specification. Does the lack of representations of farmers imply that farming was the understood lot of all men except those represented as rulers, soldiers, dancers, and ritual prac- titioners? In an epidemiology of representations, absence also signifies. I find it useful to think in terms of marked and unmarked classes, on the premise that representation may indicate that which is set apart (marked) from that which is accepted as unremarkable. Inferring the unre- marked, the ordinary, in a society's eyes is as necessary</page><page sequence="16">268 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY Volume 34, Number 3, June 1993 as describing the marked if we aim to understand human life in the past. EDWARD M. SCHORTMAN Department of Anthropology and Sociology, Kenyon College, Gambier, Ohio 43022-9623, U.S.A. i xii 92 Joyce's article provides important insights into the pos- sible emic meanings of prehistoric Central American figural representations. Her discussion of material cul- ture in the active voice, as part of symbolic structures motivating and channeling people's perceptions and ac- tions, is particularly stimulating. A major obstacle to advancing the symbolic approach Joyce advocates is the perennial difficulty of determin- ing the congruence of reconstructed and original mean- ings. This problem is compounded by the recognition that symbols frequently have multiple meanings, as Joyce notes, and are most likely perceived differently by members of various social factions. Acknowledgment of complexity is no reason to surrender all hope of recon- structing prehistoric symbol systems. It should give us pause, however, before accepting interpretations which posit widespread, homogeneous meanings for any class of material items. There are good reasons for suspecting that there are levels of meaning underlying those pro- vided in the article (Geertz I 973). It is with these thoughts in mind that I would propose a "friendly amendment" to Joyce's formulation. She re- constructs a gender-based division of labor (limited to the Classic period?) found throughout lower Central America and southern Mesoamerica. Women are pro- ducers and reproducers within the household; men en- gage in public activities, specifically warfare, ritual, and diplomacy. She argues that the enshrinement of these distinctions in material form was part of strategies used by women to assert their importance vis-a-vis men and households to claim their economic autonomy vis-a-vis elites. This may well have been the case, but the story looks suspiciously incomplete. From surviving represen- tations it appears that Classic-period southern Meso- american and lower Central American women were cer- tainly instrumental in productive and reproductive processes on which all social members depended. This need not mean that their contributions were valued equally with those of men. In order to determine this central point, productive and reproductive activities must be situated within broader relations of production through which the goods women produced were distrib- uted and consumed (Meillassoux I98I:9-Io). Similarly, while women are crucial to the physical reproduction of any social group, it is important to know the sociopoliti- cal forces encouraging or discouraging these biological processes and who comes to control the children re- sulting from them (Meillassoux I 9 8 I:7 2). I am not sanguine that we currently have the data needed to address questions of political economy for Classic-period southern Mesoamerica. One positive ott- come of articles such as this one is that they raise issues previously ignored and direct us to gather the relevant information. Joyce's reconstruction suggests a hypothe- sis for further investigation. Southern Mesoamerican males in the Classic period apparently monopolized roles in the public arena, specifically warfare, ritual, and associations with distant, high-prestige realms. Men would, therefore, have monopolized what Giddens (i984:257-60) calls authoritative resources, the ability to organize and control relations of production and re- production. Expansion and maintenance of power de- pend on a social faction's ability to control productive and reproductive processes through monopolies over these relations (Giddens I984: 26I). Dominance in war- fare would have given elite males especially a monopoly over coercive force to be used inter- and intrasocietally. Perhaps more important, lowland Maya, lower Ulua, and, less certainly, lower Central American ritual seems to have been largely under male control. It is in and through ritual that meaning systems are defined, that values are fixed and affirmed (Douglas and Isherwood I979:65, 67). Those who control such systems can trans- late esoteric knowledge into political power by imposing their conceptual structures on a population (Bourdieu I977:40, I60-7I). It is at least possible, therefore, that women's productive and reproductive roles in the soci- eties under study were carried out within a political economy dominated by and serving the needs of elite males. The depictions of gender-specific activities dis- cussed by Joyce may be less a reflection of equality than an attempt to fix and objectify a very unequal division of labor. Acceptance of these symbols would have effec- tively excluded women from those arenas in which con- trol over household production was exercised. The fact that the ceramic and monumental figural renditions dis- cussed functioned in ritual contexts further implies that at least part of their meaning was imposed by the men who controlled ritual knowledge and performance. This is not to say that households in general and women in particular fully accepted these prescribed meanings. Covert resistance to domination frequently involves subordinates in the reinterpretation of sym- bols in ways that meet their own needs (Gailey I987, McGuire and Paynter i99i). The dominant ideology ex- pressed through figural representations may have been more widely accepted by elite males than by the popula- tion-at-large (Beaudry, Cook, and Mrozowski I99I). I would suggest, however, that by trying to take the socio- political relations in which productive and reproductive processes are embedded into account we might better appreciate the polysemous character of the ancient sym- bols to which Joyce so perceptively directs our attention. PATRICIA URBAN AND ELLEN BELL Department of Anthropology and Sociology, Kenyon College, Gambier, Ohio 43022-9623, U.S.A. 4 I 93 Joyce should be commended for her attempt to under- stand the meaning of figurines from southeastern Meso- america, a data set too long ignored. Despite her worth-</page><page sequence="17">JOYCE Women's Work 1.269 while efforts, however, we have a number of problems with her analysis. First, the sample examined is small- an unspecified number of excavated examples and ap- proximately i6o from the Peabody's collections. This sample seems overpowered by the theoretical apparatus brought to bear on it, and in the end her conclusion that "human representation eclectically incorporated tradi- tional images of the female and exotic images of the male" appears simplistic and restrictive. "Meaning" at any point in time is multivalent, and meanings alsc change with time. In our experience, moreover, there is no dichotomy between male and female images but rather a continuum in representation and, presumably, their significance. To illustrate this point we would like to turn to our data from the Naco Valley of northwestern Honduras, approximately 50 km (straight-line distance) from Joyce's site of Cerro Palenque. The Naco Classic-period sample consists of hollow and solid figurines as well as whistles (instruments pro- ducing a single tone) and ocarinas (those that make more than one tone). These categories are combined because similar, if not identical, faces, clothing, and postures are found in all three; therefore, when we refer to "figu- rines" below it should be understood that we mean oca- rinas and whistles as well. The decorated or modeled portions of all Classic items are mold-made. To date we have analyzed 2,572 whole and partial specimens from excavation contexts and 70 whole or fragmentary molds. One of us (Bell) has developed a type-variety-mode clas- sification for these materials based on 805 specimens; it has been tested against about i,ooo other items and re- fined on that basis. This work is the basis of our com- ments on form and representation. The excavation con- texts from which we have recovered these materials include manufacturing areas, zones of probable domestic activities, and a few clearly ritual contexts (marked by deposits of ash, fragmentary and whole, burnt and un- burnt Spondylus shell, incensarios, candeleros, cache bowls and cups, greenstone, sculpture fragments, im- ported pottery, and local wares from domestic and proba- ble nondomestic types). The Naco Valley sample, first, does not support a dis- tinction between early La Mora-like large, hollow fig- urines and later, smaller, and more finely modeled items: both sorts are present as finished products and molds in Late and Terminal Classic contexts and appear to have begun in the Early Classic. Second, gender dis- tinctions are often difficult to make. Bodies with breasts we regard as female, but the vulva is not represented. Torsos without breasts we regard as male; human male genitalia are found only on figures that are otherwise zoomorphic. Since a figurine's weakest point, structur- ally, is the head-body junction, our sample of whole fig- ures is limited, but it seems to be the case that men and women wear the same jewelry-necklaces, pectorals, occasionally nose plugs, and earflares-and have similar hairstyles and headdresses. Faces, to our eyes, can rarely be categorized as male or female, and many of those that can appear to be representations of the Southeast's equivalent of the Maya Old Fire God. Third, few actual activities are represented. Figurines stand, kneel, or, less commonly, sit. Arms are not always clearly portrayed but generally hang at the sides with hands pointing down or, for seated and kneeling figures, resting on the thighs. A few examples of one or both arms bent at the elbow with hands on hips exist, and there are figures with one arm raised to the head but nothing carried on the head. Tools and nonclothing accoutrements are rare. There is one effigy mano and metate without an attached figure. Perhaps a dozen female figures are shown with children, usually carried in the left arm and supported on the left hip. In addition, we have 26 exam- ples of women carrying vessels, usually in the crook of the right arm. Male figures do not seem to carry any- thing. Fourth, while the carrying of children does seem to reinforce a domestic function, we argue that the ves- sels indicate ritual functions. The vessels are round with short vertical walls. Wall exteriors are usually deco- rated with incised lines apparently added after molding. Their upper surfaces are punctated or have small applied clay dots which themselves are sometimes punctated. Such dots are often interpreted as food, but given the punctations we believe that the vessels represent cande- leros. No Naco ceramic taxon contains bowls of the shape carried by figurines, nor are Naco vessels incised in similar patterns. Candeleros, of which we have ana- lyzed 467 to date, are of the proper configuration: gener- ally round with short vertical to slightly out-slanted walls, solid save for the i to over 2o holes (usually 4-7) and often decorated with incised parallel lines, chev- rons, and X's. Candelero holes show buming, and smoke marks are found above side vents. Candeleros are gener- ally found in domestic contexts, and we interpret them as items of family-based ritual. Finally, we wish to suggest that, rather than a dichot- omy in status and role, figurines demonstrate a consider- able overlap in male and female ritual functions and sta- tus (as marked by access to goods such as jewelry and fancy headdresses). There is a continuum in the Naco material from the clearly domestic-the small chil- dren-through apparent female-dominated domestic rit- uals involving candeleros to public activities involving women and men. Moreover, this continuum has other axes which incorporate supernatural beings (the Old Fire God and, possibly, a young deity similar to the Maya Maize God) and the animal world: in addition to the depictions of animals with human male genitalia, ani- mals (felines, birds of many sorts, bats, dogs, reptiles, pisotes, and others) wear necklaces and pectorals, com- monly have earflares, and sometimes have headdresses. While there are a few other points which concern us- for example, is it appropriate to compare Early Classic La Mora figurines to Late Classic Maya sculptures such as the Yaxchilan lintels? -we will limit ourselves to the above comments. It is important to try to understand the "meaning" of the past, and no data category should be overlooked, but we must always bear in mind that "meaning" is fluid, can be conditioned by the nature of our sample, and is filtered through our modem percep- tions.</page><page sequence="18">270 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY Volume 34, Number 3, June 1993 Reply ROSEMARY A. JOYCE Cambridge, Mass., U.S.A. i6 II 93 The comments on my paper suggest vividly both the largely untapped potential of the relatively abundant sources of imagery in the archaeological record, such as the figurines and painted pottery I discuss, and the wide range of issues that researchers will confront in examin- ing these rich resources. As in all archaeological ac- counts, issues pertaining both to the creation of "data" through the recording of specific observations and to the interpretation of these observations as meaningful pat- terning must be addressed. Diversity of method and un- derlying theoretical assumptions in data production and of theory and methodological assumptions in interpreta- tion combine to ensure that such discussions can only be open-ended. I detect in most of the comments a straining to estab- lish the universality of the proposed interpretations that goes far beyond my own goals. My selection of cases was emphatically not intended to exhaust either the ob- served range of gender imagery within any one tradition of representation (Davis's B, B', and B") or the range of possibilities that might exist in other, undescribed cases in the wide area extending from the Maya Lowlands to Costa Rica. Thus I welcome Urban and Bell's prelimi- nary presentation of their Naco Valley figurines. I am surprised by the degree of congruence in our results, given our divergent schemes of data collection and re- cording and the differences in archaeological context be- tween the two samples. Unlike the Ulua Valley, with its multiple and, I argue, competing centers, the Naco Valley was dominated by a single large center, La Sierra, during the Late and Terminal Classic periods (Urban I986). Thus the sociopolitical contexts of production of human imagery are quite different in the two areas. That production of figurines was local in both areas is estab- lished by the presence of figurine molds. Figurine pro- duction begins in the Ulua Valley in conjunction with the rise of a local painted ceramic tradition, the Ulua Polychrome, emphasizing human figures. In contrast, the Naco Valley participates in a distinctive painted ce- ramic tradition which, according to Urban and Schort- man (i987:379-82), lacks depictions of the human fig- ure. Despite these distinctive elements Urban and Bell describe patterns close to those I discerned in the Ulua Valley collections from the Peabody Museum and differ from me primarily over interpretations of the signifi- cance of patterns. As did Urban and Bell, I found that jewelry and facial features did not allow assignment of gender, and there- fore I limited my study to the i 6o figurines (out of slightly fewer than i,ooo examples in the Peabody col- lections) with bodies complete enough for me to assign a gender identity and associate it with variation in other aspects of costume and pose. They report that of their sample of 2,572 figurine fragments "perhaps a dozen" are females carrying children, while 26 carry vessels. They do not report the number of figurines that could be assigned male gender on the basis of the criteria I used in my study: the combination of an exposed chest without marked breasts and a loincloth. While the pro- portion of my sample that can be assigned a gender iden- tity is thus apparently higher than in the Naco case, I suspect that this is misleading. My sample included both Middle Formative and Classic figurines, and it is clear from their presentation that Urban and Bell have no Formative-period examples (perhaps accounting for the absence of exposed female genitalia, which in my survey were found only on Formative-period figurines). Furthermore, the Peabody collections, gathered through many individual programs of investigation, undoubtedly reflect collecting bias toward whole or reconstructable figurines and a reduction in the overall number of frag- ments by the reassembly of shattered figurines. This aided my analysis, which required figurines complete enough to assess the presence of the features I cite as distinguishing male and female images. For the same reason, I did not review or count individual figurine body fragments curated as nondiagnostic, e.g., lacking identi- fiable imagery. Adding these would no doubt further re- duce the proportion of the collection that represented the kinds of images I discuss in my paper. It is crucial to note, however, that my discussion rests not on frequency of figurines or fragments (and there is much room for debate about how to enumerate these objects) but on the understanding that the images they carry are particular kinds of public representations. The incorporation of images on objects provides grounds for describing the contexts of their production, use, and dis- posal, and therefore Urban and Bell's classification of musical instruments is of great interest. But the images must be treated as significant in their own right. Each public representation gives concrete form to a private representation and, by objectifying it, makes it a subject of social discourse. The interaction between images in different media in such details as costume and action provides the possibil- ity of a diversity of responses by both modern analysts and ancient users. As I argue for Classic Maya monu- mental images of women, any gesture (holding a cloth bundle or an open ceramic bowl) can evoke multiple associations. In this case both the actions of production that are metonymically implied by these objects and the actions of ritual which the texts accompanying the im- ages describe are among the simultaneous subjects for private representations that could have been spawned by the public representation. I argue for the figurines from Cerro Palenque that a gesture which depicts, on its face, an everyday task (carrying a two-handled jar) could equally have invoked the participation of women in rit- ual complementary to that of men, topically evoked by the depiction of a feather-costumed male holding a whistle. To this interpretation Urban and Bell's data of- fer not a contradiction but a separate strand of contextu- ally plausible private representation that might be evi-</page><page sequence="19">JOYCE Women's Work 2 7I dent to a Naco Valley observer, again presenting women as participants in public action within the household. The suggestion that the small vessels held by Naco Valley figurines represent the candelero form does not have the same force for my Ulua Valley sample, since the formal similarity that Urban and Bell cite is absent (Ulua Valley candeleros are cylindrical, not globular). Nor can it be applied to the many Lowland Maya figu- rines from sites as disparate as Lubaantun and Altar de Sacrificios, where again the kinds of vessels held are dif- ferent and candeleros are not used. The interpretation of the contents of the vessels in the Maya corpus as food may be strengthened by images such as that on a figu- rine from Lubaantun (T. Joyce I933:plate 4, 8), in which a child's hand is shown gripping one of the round items in the bowl held by the main figure. I have argued for strong connections between Lowland Maya and Ulua Valley society, particularly influencing the production of Ulua Polychromes (Joyce I986, I987, I988, I992b). Since they are produced in conjunction with Ulua Poly- chromes, I argue that the figurines I discuss may well draw on the wider range of associations, both with food production and ritual, that I outline for Maya images. But more generally, the significance of the vessels held by women (and apparently in the Naco Valley, as in the Ulua Valley and Maya Lowlands, only by women) is the way they mark these images, singling them out for dis- tinctive comment. I borrow here Kehoe's use of "marked" to underline my assumption that any representation, no matter how modest the medium and how infrequent the precise im- age (a standard for consideration that would never be applied to monumental images), is worthy of comment because it was itself a kind of comment. Davis's claim that I cannot provide grounds to choose between differ- ent emotional stances that these images might evidence, ranging from the "celebratory" to the ironic, is accurate. In order to choose between these and other alternatives I would have to privilege one point of view (presumably the intent of the maker) in a way which would undercut the open-ended possibilities that I assume and that Davis insists on. I do not even presume that these im- ages could not be simultaneously ironic and celebratory. Indeed, if they were created, as I suggest, as part of dia- logues within Ulua Valley society as the centralization of control of production, distribution, and external rela- tions was contested, then for different individuals and groups their emotional content may well have included elements of both these apparent poles. My argument is, however, that the creation of these images inevitably opens up the possibility that positive value was being created and associated with a female gender identity. In general, the commentators seem to resist reading the paper as an open-ended exploration. Urban and Bell clearly interpret it as a universal claim, as I think do Schortman and Davis as well. Kehoe, who has stressed in recent work the importance of resisting "dominant discourse" about gender (Kehoe i992), is the understand- able exception. She makes a trenchant point about the need to distinguish between the ideologically celebrated labor of elite women and the unmarked, and unre- marked, work of nonelites. In other places I have stressed the way in which Classic Maya monumental images deemphasize distinctions between male and fe- male in favor of the construction of a common elite identity (Joyce i 992a, c). One of the analytic advantages of an examination of the less stratified Ulua Valley case is the opportunity to examine how, in the absence of such clearly asserted class distinctions, other kinds of factionalism give rise to different kinds of gender im- agery. Both Davis and Kehoe see in my discussion of three neighboring societies an implicit argument that the in- termediate culture (that of the Ulua Valley) drew from the imagery of its neighbors to produce a new synthesis. I acknowledge this part of my argument, but I do not see this eclectic borrowing as being systematic in the way Davis suspects. I am taken by the elegant structural analysis that he derives from my paper, although I do not recognize my argument in this form. Davis's binaristic impression almost certainly stems, as he notes, from the suspect ease with which gender can be presented as a dichotomy despite its multiplicity (which I both men- tion here and discuss in other writing). In order to pre- sent a full accounting of the diversity of images of gen- der in any one of these societies, I would certainly return to my observation of difference among marked female images and would also consider the large numbers of gender-ambiguous images in each area. But my point of departure in this paper for both Ulua Valley and Low- land Maya cases is images which are paired. This unfor- tunately leads Davis to assume a binary nature for the concept of complementarity. In fact I use complemen- tarity to denote an alternative to hierarchy as a mode of social relations, with both potentially incorporating unlimited numbers of individuals or categories. Where complementarity operates, differences are presented as necessary and interdependent rather than as successive incomplete and encompassed variants of a higher-order, more complete, more highly valued whole (see Dever- eaux I987, Harris I978, Hoskins I990, Schlegel I977, Silverblatt I987). In examining the evidence for human differentiation, which extends far beyond the stereo- typed adult male and female images I discuss, I wish to avoid the automatic assignment to variation of hierar- chical value. Schortman summarizes concisely the interpretation of difference as relative value proposed by Meillassoux, who argued that women's limitation to a domestic con- text placed them under the control of men with greater access to a contrasting public context. As Silverblatt (I988:44) notes, "Meillassoux has been roundly criti- cized for the speculative nature of his work, his blind- ness to women's roles in production, his uncritical ac- ceptance of L6vi-Straussian models of woman exchange, and his evolutionary and functionalist bents" (see also Yanagisako and Collier i987:20-25). The conflation of my use of "household" with a domestic sphere, posed as an antithesis to a public sphere in which ritual is enacted, is also evident in Urban and Bell's reading of</page><page sequence="20">2721 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY Volume 34, Number 3, June 1993 my paper. Schortman credits me with arguing that it is women who create the images of complementarity I discuss, although in fact I leave this issue open. This entirely natural assumption follows from the tendency in the ethnographic literature cited to treat women as a single, natural category in opposition to the equally nat- ural category of men. In my own work, I draw on other recent ethnographic studies which question the domes- tic/public dichotomy and the assumption that it can be projected onto a dichotomous female/male division (see Comaroff I987). I present here a selective overview of this alternative literature, offered, as Schortman's com- ments are, as a hypothesis for further research. I view the players in the contest to advance interests represented by the production and dissemination of hu- man images as not solely individuals but also social groups composed of men and women (my "households") who stand to gain and lose together (compare Boone I990: 2I3-I6; Linnekin I990:75-I54; McKinnon I99I: 84-IO6; Weiner I976). The figurines and Ulua Poly- chromes which depict men as ritualists were produced and consumed within the space occupied by the mem- bers of the household. But households cannot be reduced to a "private" or "domestic" sphere. As the locus of a wide range of individual and group action resulting in the formation of social and economic alliances, house- holds were public places, sites of ceremonies that we detect archaeologically (such as mortuary rites) and oth- ers that we have not yet tried to detect (such as the negotiation of marriage). Within the household, the im- ages I discuss represent distinctive actions and statuses. But these differences are not inherently associated with relative value, insofar as they are represented in the same media and occur in the same contexts. Following Adams (I975:I65-74), I argue that differen- tiation will always serve as a basis for ranking but rank- ing is not identical to the creation of differential power relations or hierarchy. Adams describes ranking as an imposition of order on a set of objects recognized as like in kind by distributing them along an arbitrary dimen- sion of differentiation. Ranking is the principle which gives rise both to what Adams labels "coordinate" relations (my "complementarity") and under certain circumstances to what he calls "centralization"- differential power relations. The assignment of relative value to any ranking is thus separate from differentia- tion and ranking itself. In attempting to determine how complementarity and hierarchy (products in Adams's view of coordination and centralization) or other ways to assign relative value to difference worked in practice, archaeologists must more fully use material remains. Images may indicate, not only in their content but in the timing of their introduction and change, the existence of public comment on persons and groups. As Munn (I986:96-97, ioi-io2) argues, it is through comment and evaluation that value is created and associated with individuals and groups. We can attend to the topics of past discourse even when our ability to translate them is limited. We can identify the situations within which public representa- tions were created and used. Having identified these top- ics as present, we can (and should) examine our interpre- tations of the nonrepresentational material record to see whether these subjects are considered and to contem- plate whether our interpretations are at least consistent with the public representations which have survived. As Weiner (i992:2) has said, "the acceptance of gender ideologies fundamental to capitalist systems introduced other formidable problems for anthropological theory. Analytical dichotomies, such as stasis/change, nature/ culture, and domestic/public, always identified women with the supposedly negative side.... Women, though physically present, were seen but ignored as active par- ticipants in their own right." Attention to the imagery of gender will, I hope, correct this tendency we inherit as anthropological archaeologists to project a universal system of values derived from Euro-American society on the past.
