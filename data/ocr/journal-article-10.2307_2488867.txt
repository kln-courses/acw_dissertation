<plain_text><page sequence="1">Consumer Decision Making Fact or Fiction? RICHARD W. OLSHAVSKY DONALD H. GRANBOIS* A synthesis of research on consumers' prepurchase behavior suggests that a substantial proportion of purchases does not involve decision making, not even on the first purchase. The heavy emphasis in current research on deci- sion making may discourage investigation of other important kinds of con- sumer behavior. T he most pervasive and influential assumption in consumer behavior research is that purchases are preceded by a decision process. Writers who have suggested models of this process have used varying terminology, but all seem to agree that: 1. Two or more alternative actions exist and, therefore, choice must occur. 2. Evaluative criteria facilitate the forecasting of each al- ternative's consequences for the consumeres goals or objectives. 3. The chosen alternative is determined by a decision rule or evaluative procedure. 4. Information sought from external sources and/or re- trieved from memory is processed in the application of the decision rule or evaluation procedure. Virtually every text on consumer behavior includes a verbal or flow chart model of consumer decision pro- cesses. Engel, Blackwell, and Kollat (1978) base an elaborate stage model on five steps (problem recogni- tion, search, alternative evaluation, choice, and out- comes) suggested 70 years ago by John Dewey. How- ard's (1977) refinement of the concept of routinized response behavior, advanced in Howard and Sheth (1969, p. 9), assumes that even simplified, habitual be- havior reflects the earlier application of choice criteria to alternative brands. When situational constraints block the repetition of an earlier choice, a reduced-form evaluation process follows, in which dichotomized criteria are applied to a small evoked set of brands (Howard 1977, pp. 27-30). Research on decision making currently takes several forms. Multidimensional scaling and conjoint meas- urement are widely applied measurement tools whose relevance grows out of the "multi-attribute nature of consumer decisions" (Green and Wind 1973, p. 5). Dif- ferent processing rules, such as compensatory, disjunc- tive, conjunctive, lexicographic, and various hybrid procedures decision makers might use in multi-attribute problems are being tested in studies where subjects verbalize or report on their thought processes as they perform choice tasks (Bettman and Zins 1977; Lussier and Olshavsky 1974; Payne 1976; Russ 1971). Inves- tigators in other studies observe or photograph the se- quence and extent of information utilization by subjects provided with brochures, display boards, labelled packages, etc., containing attribute information for several brands from which a choice must be made (Bettman and Kakkar 1977; Jacoby, Szybillo,. and Busato-Schach 1977; Russo and Rosen 1975; van Raaij 1977). Other approaches to the study of decision proc- esses include correlational methods (Scott and Wright 1976) and information integration techniques (Bettman, Capon, and Lutz 1975). In his presidential address to the Association for Consumer Research, Kassarjian (1978) raised the pos- sibility that we may be attributing choice processes to consumers when no choice processes occur. Kassarjian was not simply saying that decision processes often are routinized or habitual rather than extended (as Howard and Sheth have already pointed out), but that in some cases no prepurchase process exists. This is a very bold charge, for it implies that much empirical research and theorizing on consumer decision making is less broadly applicable than has been assumed. *Richard W.

JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH * Vol. 6 0 September 1979</page><page sequence="2">94 THE JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH Assessing the Evidence Kassarjian only raised the issue; he presented no supporting evidence. The validity of his position can be assessed in two ways. Applying an evaluation proce- dure to various alternatives on two or more evaluative criteria requires considerable information, sometimes more than is readily available in memory. Evidence of the circumstances of purchasing behavior occurring in the absence of external search, then, helps to establish the maximum scope of the nondecision behavior postu- lated by Kassarjian. Information processing of the sort assumed in alternative evaluation and choice can, of course, be performed with previously acquired and stored information alone. Therefore, the second condi- tion leading to purchase without prior decision process is insufficiency of stored information suitable for alter- native evaluation or nonuse of relevant stored informa- tion. While the nature of internal processing (or lack of processing) can be studied only indirectly, a convincing case can be made that internal information is frequently either not available, not relevant, or not consulted.1 There are several comprehensive reviews of research on consumer prepurchase behavior that provide con- siderable evidence of external prepurchase information search. These reviews have encompassed surveys in which consumers were asked to describe their prepur- chase behavior retrospectively for a recent purchase, or their "usual" behavior, as well as studies of consumers in real-life purchasing situations during which some type of observational method was used to measure the decision process appearing to precede purchase. It must be recognized that consumer researchers using observation and retrospective questionnaire techniques have probably been influenced by the as- sumption of decision process behavior, so that their results may reflect a subtle bias overstating the preva- lence of decision-making behavior. To some extent, research instruments measure what their designers ex- pect to find. Consumers, too, may overstate the extent of prepurchase deliberation and choice-making behav- ior, because this may appear desirable as well as ex- pected behavior. What this means, then, is that the research to be cited probably overstates the extent of prepurchase behavior for which the decision model is appropriate. Objectives and Method The primary purpose of this paper is to assess, through a synthesis of the review articles just men- tioned, the apparent scope of consumer behavior not preceded by external search. Additional objectives, secondary only in that less substantial evidence is available for evaluation, include: * identifying circumstances in which external en- vironmental and situational constraints limit consumers to a single alternative; and * identifying research in which purchase has been observed to occur without reference to relevant stored information. Each of the four sections of the paper represents one element of the comprehensive classification of con- sumer behavior offered by Gredal (1966). These are renamed slightly here, and include: (1) budget alloca- tion (savings/spending and allocation across broad ex- penditure categories); (2) generic allocation (expendi- tures for specific products and services); (3) store pa- tronage (shopping and purchasing at specific shopping centers, stores, etc.); and (4) brand purchase. In each section, conclusions from review articles on prepurchase behavior are cited. Discussion is then directed to why the behavior involved may be sub- ject to influences and constraints precluding an internal evaluation of alternative actions. The principal review articles drawn upon include Ferber (1973) and Olander and Siepel (1970) on budget allocation, Ferber (1973) on generic allocation, Granbois (1977) on store patronage, and Newman (1977) on brand purchases. BUDGET ALLOCATION Saving Versus Spending How does the allocation of income between saving and spending come about? In his report of a wide rang- ing review of research on family economic behavior, Ferber (1973) concluded: Despite its basic importance for the understanding of consumer financial behavior, the role of financial plan- ning within the family-in the sense of explicit considera- tion of the allocation of expected financial resources be- tween saving and spending-seems to have received very little attention in empirical work, and would seem to be a prime area for future research (p. 34). Since Ferber's review, there appears to have been no empirical studies of consumers' information-seeking relative to savings. There are, however, a few studies of consumers' information about alternative forms of sav- ings and their self-assessment of the degree to which "planning" precedes savings. In his review, Ferber reported substantial proportions of households (up to 87 percent) without a "financial plan," although the meaning of "financial plan" was often not clearly de- fined (Ferber 1973, p. 35). A review by Olander and Seipel (1970) also evaluated consumers' knowledge of financial matters, e.g., inter- est rates, where stocks can be purchased, and tax regu- lations. One study reviewed reported: "The respon- 'Certain "process tracing" techniques, in particular protocol analysis, do permit direct monitoring of internal processing, although to a limited extent. However, when this technique is used, subjects are instructed, implicitly or explicitly, to engage in decision making.</page><page sequence="3">DECISION MAKING-FACT OR FICTION? 95 dents' knowledge of tax regulations was good in many respects but often did not appear to influence behavior in the direction of using savings and investment forms which were more advantageous from the tax point of view" (p. 68). Further discussion by these reviewers suggests that individual characteristics, such as low achievement motivation, perceived inability to control one's own financial destiny, and very short future time orientation and planning horizon may inhibit planning. Other evidence on the extent of deliberation preceding savings behavior comes from four studies that found the proportion of self-identified systematic savers to be 15 percent, 27 percent, 28 percent, and 40 percent, re- spectively (p. 31). In another study, 36 percent of re- spondents predicted very accurately the extent of sav- ings accumulated six months later (p. 33). Thus, perhaps one-fourth to one-third of all consum- ers show evidence of some systematic planning and decision making regarding saving; the majority, how- ever, may not be classified as deliberate choosers. An exception may be newlywed couples; Ferber and Nicosia found that half of the couples they interviewed three to six months after marriage reported a definite plan for saving (Ferber 1973, p. 51). Allocation of Income Across Expenditure Categories What, if any, type of decision process precedes the allocation of income across the various categories of goods and services, i.e., food/beverage, housing, household furnishings, etc.? We could find no studies of prepurchase behavior relative to household allocation behavior. Clearly, however, purchases within certain categories are nondiscretionary. Income must be allo- cated to the categories of food/beverage, housing, clothing, and medical care. Products within certain other categories are not necessary for survival, yet they are essentially nondis- cretionary. Certain items of personal care, recreation, and education are very strongly compelled by social pressure. Moreover, purchase of one product or service is often interlocked with other products or services. The purchase of an automobile, for instance, dictates the purchase of gasoline, repair services, and insur- ance. Still other expenditures are compelled by consumers' strong preference for a culturally-mandated life style, usually acquired early in life. Most household furnish- ings, for example, are discretionary, yet 99.9 percent of the electrically wired homes in the United States have a refrigerator. Presumably this is because few American consumers will tolerate the type of life style implied by living without a refrigerator. Many products in the transportation, personal care, household furnishings, and household operations categories are nondiscretion- ary in this sense; they constitute what Riesman and Roseborough (1955) termed the "standard package," a set of products uniformly represented throughout American society. Even allocations to categories that seem purely dis- cretionary may not reflect true choice behavior. To- bacco expenditures, for example, are by no means uni- versal; cigarette smoking, the dominant form of tobacco usage, occurs in only 35 percent of United States households [Adult Use of Tobacco-1975 (1976)]. Studies reveal that smoking behavior is acquired largely in the preteen and teen-age years (Teenage Smoking 1976), primarily as a result of such "psychosocial fac- tors" as curiosity, imitation, identification with adult roles, status striving, and rebellion (Lawton 1962). Striving for these goals is socially motivated and strongly influenced by the behavior of peers, siblings, and parents. Processes such as identification and imita- tion perhaps explain expenditures in this category bet- ter than does the notion of individual choice (Wohlford 1970) 2 All this suggests that the manner in which income is allocated across categories is largely nondiscretionary. This is not to say, however, that consumers make no decisions regarding this type of allocation. Clearly, choices could be made concerning the priorities by which needs will be satisfied and the proportion of in- come spent within each category. One way to estimate the extent of such decision making in household budget allocation is to ask if a plan exists within the household for distributing income. A unique survey of 300 Min- nesota families representing three generations found that only seven percent of grandparents, 21 percent of parents, and 24 percent of married children reported such plans, and similar proportions claimed to use procedures for estimating expenses and setting specific amounts aside (Hill 1963, pp. 127-37). The relatively few empirical studies of household budget allocation have sought to discover the compara- tive roles of family members (Ferber 1973) rather than the nature, incidence, and extent of the process itself. If joint participation by husband and wife, rather than control over the allocation by one spouse, is more likely to indicate conscious deliberation over alternatives, then evidence presented by Ferber and Lee (1974) that the "family financial officer" role tends to shift from joint to individual performance with increasing length of marriage seems to support the hypothesis advanced earlier by Kyrk (1953) that deliberation over household budgets declines over the life cycle. GENERIC ALLOCATION What, if any, type of decision process precedes the allocation of income within expenditure categories? 2Following experimental smoking during the "transition phase," those going on to become regular smokers (the "maintenance phase") apparently do so because they develop physiological and/or psychological dependence on cigarettes, and discontinuance be- comes very difficult or impossible for most smokers.</page><page sequence="4">96 THE JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH Ferber summarizes studies showing that from 20 to 25 percent of durable goods and clothing purchases appear to be "impulsive," in that urgency or a special purchase opportunity displaced deliberation and prepurchase planning, or that satisfaction with the product being replaced reduced family discussion and planning (Ferber 1973, pp. 44-5). Up to 50 percent of supermar- ket purchases and 33 percent of transactions in variety stores and drugstores are "impulsive purchases," in that shoppers do not state intentions to buy these items in store-entrance interviews (Engel, Blackwell, and Kol- lat 1978, p. 483). Evidence from other studies (e.g., Wells and LoSciuto 1966) suggests that for certain grocery products decision processes do not occur in the store either. Additional evidence relating to the. existence of prepurchase processes within expenditure category comes from studies of the adoption and diffusion of innovations. A general finding from this research is that substantial differences exist across consumers in the amount of prepurchase deliberation that occurs. Rogers and Shoemaker's (1971) review shows that 12 of 14 studies of information seeking found that early adopters sought more information about the innovation than did later adopters (p. 374). Their review also shows consid- erable evidence that early adopters have significantly greater exposure to change agents, mass media, and interpersonal communication channels (pp. 371-4). This declining intensity of decision making is explained, at least in part, by the "diffusion effect,"' the increasing social pressure on nonadopters to adopt the in- novation as the percentage of adopters increases. Further, Rogers and Shoemaker (1971, p. 122) and Robertson (1971, p. 61) acknowledge that evidence for the existence of "'stages" in the adoption decision may be artifactual; both cite evidence that when unstruc- tured questionnaires are used, certain stages are skipped or in some cases no decision process occurs. Contemporary consumer researchers often overlook differences in the cognitive and motivational patterns associated with the many products and services in- volved in consumption. An early attempt to categorize these differences recognized products that are primar- ily hedonic (appealing to the senses), those with impor- tant symbolic meaning (ego-involving), and a third cat- egory valued primarily in terms of their functional per- formance (Woods 1961). While many generic products have two or even all three dimensions, prepurchase choice processes are most likely when functional per- formance dominates. Sensory preferences are often well established in early childhood, although these may change somewhat with maturation, e.g., increasing preferences for salty and sharp flavors as children enter the teen years (Reynolds and Wells 1977, p. 83). Likes and dislikes for certain tastes, because of their early origins, may be reflected in consumption patterns without deliberation or even awareness by the consumer. Symbolic aspects of products are also often learned in childhood. Moore (1957) points out that eating, like other physiological activities, is especially prone to symbolic elaboration, perhaps because these activities "reach back into in- fancy, and are complexly patterned long before there is any autonomous intelligence or maturity with which to perceive the difference between the act itself and its accompanying feelings, social circumstances, con- tradictions, and coincidental motives" (Moore 1957, p. 77). One study of five-, seven-, and nine-year-olds found: Children apparently begin assigning social values to goods around age seven, particularly-to elaborate toys. Nine-year-olds also are slightly fashion conscious in the sense that they may express a desire for certain articles of clothing being worn by other children, for example, ten- nis shoes and skirts . . . Children involve themselves considerably with some durable goods. In discussing au- tomobiles with them, it was found that practically all of them have preferences for certain autos . . . (McNeal 1969, pp. 263, 265). These examples suggest that better understanding of the processes leading to early childhood acquisition of taste preferences and symbolic interpretations of prod- ucts may be more relevant for understanding pref- erences for "hedonic" and "symbolic" products than research structured on models of choice and decision. Finally, in many instances consumers have no con- trol over the specific products and services they pur- chase or consume. In the extreme case, consumers who are institutionalized (e.g., in hospitals, rest homes, or military institutions) typically have little or no control over the type of food, clothing, or furnishings they use. College students who live in dormitories and frater- nities are similarly constrained. Apartment dwellers, and in many cases even home buyers, have little control over such items as fixtures, appliances, and floor coverings. STORE PATRONAGE Analysis of the spatial environment within which most consumers obtain goods and services reveals the potential relevance of choice models in portraying shopping and store patronage behavior. Consumers often find desired products and services to be available in two or more cities or towns within reasonable driving distance, or in numerous local shopping centers or areas, scattered retail outlets, and so forth. Catalogs, mail order, door-to-door sales organizations, telephone ordering services, etc., further expand the range of possible sources. A review of studies on shopping and patronage suggests, however, that extended search and evaluation typically does not precede store patronage (Granbois 1977). Use of Nonstore Sources While nonstore shopping sources are important in most product categories, studies of their use have re- vealed considerable city-to-city variation. One study</page><page sequence="5">DECISION MAKING-FACT OR FICTION? 97 found high users of mail order also to be high telephone order users; another found heavy in-home buyers also to be active store shoppers. Several studies have found distinctive socioeconomic characteristics associated with heavy use of these modes (Granbois 1977, p. 270). All the findings suggest that a significant subset of all consumers may not even consider sources other than the conventional retail outlets. Patronage of Urban Areas/Shopping Centers Patronage of shopping areas tends to vary directly with assortment size and inversely with distance or effort involved in reaching them. Studies of patronage have firmly established the broad predictive usefulness of simple formal models establishing these relation- ships. Recent research, however, points to exceptions to, and constraints on, the patterns predicted by these models. For example, attention has been given to the impact of physical barriers, differential behavior of consumers with varying socioeconomic characteris- tics, and the impact of differing levels of promotion and price differences (Granbois 1977). The existence of lim- itations on the range of alternative shopping areas is further supported by the findings of "outshopping" studies, seeking determinants of shopping trips to nearby cities. Two studies found distinctive profiles of outshoppers with regard to variables such as income, age, race, sex, and beliefs, suggesting this pattern to be limited to certain market segments (Granbois 1977, p. 287). Patronage Among and Within Store Types Studies of shopping activity preceding major durable goods purchases have typically found a high incidence of purchases occurring after a single store visit, despite the fact that the high dollar value, physical complexity, relatively low purchase frequency, and the presence of a significant proportion of first-time purchasers in the samples would seem to indicate more extensive consid- eration of alternative outlets. The following data illus- trate this finding (Granbois 1977, p. 264): Percent of buyers reporting Type of purchase a single store visit Black and white television 39 Color television 50 Furniture 22 Carpet 27 Similar studies of soft goods purchases reveal that 75-80 percent of all purchases are made after visiting a single store (Granbois 1977, p. 266). Deliberation and true choice might be expected to be at a maximum among residents new to an area. Nevertheless, such studies have consistently found that convenience and past loyalty to chains in the previous area are important criteria in making selections, and that new patterns are established quickly- supermarkets selected within three weeks, several other store types picked within five weeks (Granbois 1977, p. 272). These and other results indicate a less- than-full evaluation of alternatives. One study of supermarket shoppers using retrospective accounts of store selection found that nine percent of the sample re- ported to have made no choice; patronage occurred instead on bases such as personal recommendations or preferences acquired in early childhood (Olshavsky and MacKay 1978). As in the case of generic product preferences, store preferences developed at an early age may serve as constraints on the range of choice alternatives consid- ered by adults. Evidence of this pattern was also found by McNeal, who writes: "Starting as early as age five children show likes and dislikes for certain stores as well as specific types of stores" (McNeal 1969, p. 263). BRAND PURCHASE- How does brand purchase occur? In his review of research on prepurchase information seeking, Newman (1977) found little evidence of extensive search and some evidence that no search or evaluation occurred in many instances. On sources of information, Newman reports that: One survey found that one-third of the buyers of major appliances received information from only one source ... A more recent survey found that 15 percent of the buyers of major appliances and automobiles consulted no exter- nal source before buying . . . In both surveys source referred to a type or category such as friends and neigh- bors; books, pamphlets and articles; advertising; and retail outlets . .. A survey of small electrical appliance buyers found that 10 percent of them could not recall obtaining helpful information in any way other than by visiting a retail store (p. 80). On number of alternatives considered, Newman writes: Several studies have shown that many consumers limit their attention to few alternatives. Forty-six percent of the buyers of major household appliances considered only one price range ... appliance buyers who examined only one brand ranged from 41 percent for refrigerators to 71 percent for vacuum cleaners . . . of the buyers of household appliances and cars, 47 percent considered mainly a single brand at the outset of the decision process ... These findings are consistent with other evidence that the buyer's "evoked set" of brands . . . is typically small (p. 81). Finally, with respect to results based on studies that developed a comprehensive index of information seek- ing, Newman states: Using a scale ranging from one for no information seeking to six for very active search, Katona and Mueller re- ported that 40 percent of the buyers of major appliances had scale values of one or two while 10 percent had</page><page sequence="6">98 THE JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH values of five or six . . . The results led Katona and Mueller to conclude that 'Any notion that careful plan- ning and choosing, thorough consideration of alterna- tives, and information seeking accompanied every major purchase was contradicted by the data . . . Rather, it appeared ... that many purchases were made in a state of ignorance or at least indifference.' In another study of major appliances and automobiles, on a 20-point scale representing out-of-store search (zero meaning none), 49 percent had scores of 5 or less; 38 percent scored from 6 to 11; and 13 percent had scores of 12 to 20 (p. 82). There are only a few direct studies of the brand choice process, each with strong limitations. Wells and LoSciuto (1966) using an in-store, on-the-spot tech- nique, observed 1,500 supermarket shoppers. Only rep- resentative data for cereals, candy, and detergent were presented. In 55 percent of the cases for cereals, 38 percent for candy, and 72 percent for detergent, there was no visible evidence of an in-store prepurchase choice process, such as inspecting two or more packages. In 15 percent of the cases for cereal, 44 percent candy, and 12 percent for detergent, no pur- chase occurred. Hence, according to these data, in only 30 percent of the cereal, 18 percent of the candy, and 12 percent of the detergent purchases was there even the possibility that an in-store prepurchase process oc- curred. Unfortunately, the technique used could not observe the mental processes; strong conclusions about the choice process, therefore, cannot be drawn from this study. In another study of supermarket shoppers (Bettman 1970), a "process tracing" technique was used, which was more likely to reveal any choice processes that occurred. For a period of six to eight weeks, Bettman observed the shopping behavior of two homemakers and asked them to think aloud as they made their pur- chases. He analyzed these protocol data to obtain in- sights about the evaluative criteria and evaluation proc- esses used. A similar study of women's ready-to-wear clothing was performed by Alexis, Haines, and Simon (1968). While these and other studies using process tracing techniques generally find evidence for prepurchase process, the techniques are inherently biased; as Bettman and Zins (1977) point out: A second bias in the protocols occurs because the con- sumer is asked to give protocols for choices where in many cases a great deal of learning has already oc- curred . . . the consumer may have bought the same brand many times, and may not really think much about this type of choice while it is being made. The request from the experimenter to keep talking may then lead to retrospection about why the particular brand was bought in the first place, although such reasoning is not relevant now (p. 82). In another study of in-store behavior, Olshavsky (1973) analyzed tape recorded conversations between customer and salesman for major appliance transac- tions, without the customer being aware of the record- ing. This study provided clear evidence of at least a limited amount of prepurchase processes. At the same time, however, in some cases customers relied entirely upon the salesman's recommendation. Other studies provide more direct evidence concern- ing the way brand purchases occur without prior con- sideration of alternatives. Several studies document that consumers make purchases on the basis of recom- mendations from either personal or nonpersonal sources. Feldman and Spencer (1965) reported that 75 percent of newcomers to a community selected a physi- cian solely on the basis of a recommendation. Some studies have indicated that brand purchase behavior represents conformity to group norms; this occurs par- ticularly for highly conspicuous products. Venkatesan (1968) demonstrated in a laboratory study the influence of group pressure on selection of men's suits. Also, some evidence suggests that brand preferences are ac- quired early in life, as part of the general acculturation process (Ward 1974). It has even been found that brand purchases are influenced by such superficial fac- tors as shelf height and shelf facings (Frank and Massy 1970). Finally, there is some evidence that brand purchases are made on the basis of surrogates or indices of quality, rather than on the basis of a direct evaluation of the brands' attributes. Price, manufacturer's reputation, and packaging are but a few of the indices studied (Monroe 1973; Gardner 1971; McConnell 1968; Brown 1958). CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS Our review of studies that provide some evidence, direct or indirect, for the existence of prepurchase processes and our analysis of the constraints and influ- ences on purchasing behavior suggest that Kassarian is right. A significant proportion of purchases may not be preceded by a decision process. This conclusion does not simply restate the familiar observation that pur- chase behavior rapidly becomes habitual, with little or no prepurchase processes occurring after the first few purchases. We conclude that for many purchases a decision process never occurs, not even on the first purchase. How then does purchasing occur if not as a result of some type of decision process? This review identified a number of different ways: Purchases can occur out of necessity; they can be derived from culturally- mandated lifestyles or from interlocked purchases; they can reflect preferences acquired in early childhood; they can result from simple conformity to group norms or from imitation of others; purchases can be made exclusively on recommendations from personal or non- personal sources; they can be made on the basis of surrogates of various types; or they can even occur on a random or superficial basis. Further research, free of the prepurchase decision assumption, may identify still other ways. Another conclusion we draw from this review is that</page><page sequence="7">DECISION MAKING-FACT OR FICTION? 99 even when purchase behavior is preceded by a choice process, it is likely to be very limited. It typically in- volves the evaluation of few alternatives, little external search, few evaluative criteria, and simple evaluation process models. There is little evidence that consumers engage in the very extended type of search and evalua- tion a product testing organization like Consumers Union performs routinely.3 It would be an oversimplification, however, to characterize purchasing behavior as either involving predecision processes or not. While this may be an accurate characterization of some purchases, in gen- eral, we should allow for combination or "hybrid" strategies whereby choice and nonchoice are used; e.g., personal recommendations can be combined in various ways with limited search and evaluation. Indeed, future research may reveal that such hybrid strategies are the most common type of prepurchase behavior. These conclusions have important implications for theories of consumer behavior. Certainly any theory whose central thesis is that purchases are preceded by a decision process (Engel, Blackwell, and Kollat 1978; Howard and Sheth 1969) can provide an adequate ex- planation of only certain types of consumer purchasing behaviors. Theory needs to be developed along at least two separate lines. Wright has argued that a process he calls "affect referral' often describes purchases. Global measures of affect, not attribute-specific infor- mation, provide the basis for choice, where either the "best" or the "first acceptable" option thought of is selected (Wright 1976). This first line of development will be particularly fruitful if it entails low involvement learning as part of an ongoing socialization process. The second line of development is suggested by the work of Lussier and Olshavsky (1974), Payne (1976), and others who have argued for a contingent processing view of decision making. Payne, for example, points out that the various choice strategies (e.g., additive dif- ference, conjunctive, and elimination-by-aspects) are not competing, but complementary. In that regard, the four decision processes discussed in this paper might be conceptualized as different sub- routines in a general choice program. The control condi- tions under which one of these sets of processes might be called would then seem to depend, at least in part, on the characteristics of the decision problem. In that respect, the less cognitively demanding decision procedures, con- junctive and elimination-by-aspects, might be called early in the decision process as a way of simplifying the decision task by quickly eliminating alternatives until only a few alternatives remained as choice possibilities. The subject might then employ one of the cognitively demanding choice procedures, e.g., additive difference model, to make the final evaluation and choice (Payne 1976, p. 385). This contingent processing concept needs to be broadened to incorporate other purchasing heuristics of the type identified here, e.g., conformity, imitation, recommendations. In view of the tremendous interest in consumer pur- chasing behavior it is surprising, to say the least, that there have been so few studies of prepurchase proc- esses that involve actual consumers in actual settings using methodologies that permit observation of behav- iors contrary to those predicted by models of choice and decision processes. Such research is fraught with dif- ficulties that must be overcome if we are to have a secure empirical foundation for theory construction and testing. These conclusions also have implications for private and public policy. Clearly, if some purchases are not preceded by any type of prior search and evaluation, then recommendations based on research that incorpo- rates the assumption that they are may be inappropri- ate. The issue of "'information overload," for instance, which has occupied so many pages in marketing jour- nals recently, must be interpreted quite differently if a significant percentage of consumers of particular prod- ucts or services do not engage in prepurchase activities. [Received May 1978. Revised June 1979.] lhis is not to imply that consumers who use Consumer Reports could not engage in extensive evaluation of the data presented, but that they do not gather such data themselves. Indeed, in most cases, this cannot be done by the typical consumer because of the time, effort, expense, or expertise involved.
