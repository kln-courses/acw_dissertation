<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> chapter three Science and Religion Science and Religion This chapter seeks to reconstruct the understanding of ‘life’, and human  life in particular, that characterises Houellebecq’s work and that, in  La Possibilité d’une île (2005), is finally seen to necessitate humanity’s  overcoming by a posthuman successor species. In doing so the chapter  returns to Houellebecq’s earliest works and notes Houellebecq’s  apparent identification with H. P. Lovecraft, the American author of  horror fiction whose writing is marked by a hatred of life and for whom  literature appears as a rejection of or opposition to life. This sense is  confirmed in Rester vivant (1991), which stresses failure and suffering  as the poet’s vocation. Significant, too, is Houellebecq’s repeated appeal  to the philosophy of Arthur Schopenhauer who equally describes life  as a domain of struggle, suffering and disappointment for which the  only possible solution is a suppression or rejection of individual will. La  Possibilité d’une île also stresses the disappointment of life, especially in  the context of a hedonistic culture that devalues maturity and dismisses  the elderly, thereby leading to an increasing restriction of the viable  life course. This view of life tends to imply a somewhat old-fashioned  and simplistic social Darwinism, yet the future Utopia of La Possibilité  d’une île, in which humanity engineers its own overcoming, suggests  a far more complex and paradoxical view of evolution and the novel  can be seen as an attempt to think the unthinkable; that is to say, what  kind of shape would be taken by the life of a future species for which  our own systems of value and modes of understanding the world had  ceased to be meaningful? Finally, this chapter closes on an interrogation  of the ambiguous role of religion in Houellebecq’s work. His novels  contain reasonably extensive reference to religious ideas, traditions and  practices, yet are couched in an uncertain, shifting tone that often makes  these markers of faith appear incongruous or ironic. Nonetheless there is  fairly clear evidence of some residual respect in Houellebecq’s work for  Morrey, Michel Houellebecq.indd   114 05/02/2013   10:27:21 </page> <page sequence="2"> Science and Religion 115 religious faith or commitment and a sense of the persistence of religious  models over our thinking and behaviour. This can be seen, too, in his  treatment of religious cults which is gently ironic but never entirely  facetious or condemnatory. Religious discourse remains valuable in  two domains especially: it continues to allow for a belief in selfless love  in a culture where this value has been largely replaced by narcissistic  eroticism; and it helps us to think through the moral implications of the  scientifically facilitated elongation or replication of life that may shortly  be within our grasp. Lastly, religious thought remains one of the few  domains in our society that points to the benefits to be accrued from a  renouncing of desire, something that has become anathema to the ruling  ideology of consumer democracy. Life: Houellebecq, Lovecraft, Schopenhauer Michel Houellebecq’s first published work (in 1991) was his short,  and relatively little-discussed, study of the American horror writer  H. P. Lovecraft. If the work has drawn scant commentary, it is doubtless  because readers are uncertain how it fits alongside Houellebecq’s novels  and poems, with their fairly coherent thematic continuity; and also  because the work itself is something of a strange beast – not really a  biography and a little too impressionistic to be taken seriously as literary  criticism.1 Houellebecq himself, in a new preface written for the work  in 1998, following the success of Les Particules élémentaires, admitted:  ‘Avec le recul, il me semble que j’ai écrit ce livre comme une sorte de  premier roman. Un roman à un seul personnage’ (HPL, 6; 23).2 But, if  Houellebecq’s H. P. Lovecraft is a study of one writer by another, part  of its strangeness perhaps stems from Houellebecq’s intuition that ‘Il  y a quelque chose de pas vraiment littéraire chez Lovecraft’ (HPL, 22;  34).3 And it is perhaps in this quality that Houellebecq finds a point of  identification with the American author: for, although Houellebecq’s  popular success means that he has found a recognised place within the  literary establishment during his own lifetime in a way that Lovecraft  never did, Houellebecq’s work is still sometimes regarded with a degree  of snobbery and suspicion. There has been – as Dominique Noguez first  pointed out, and as we saw in Chapter 1 – a reluctance to discuss in any  detail Houellebecq’s style out of a prurient preference for his incendiary  material, just as the lurid horrors of Lovecraft’s stories long sealed  his reputation over the remarkable baroque structures of his writing.  Morrey, Michel Houellebecq.indd   115 05/02/2013   10:27:21 </page> <page sequence="3"> 116 Michel Houellebecq Houellebecq summarises this point in a neat formula that might apply to  himself as well as it does to Lovecraft: there is a suspicion that ‘Chez lui,  la haine de la vie préexiste à toute littérature’ (HPL, 54; 57).4 Houellebecq and Lovecraft are fundamentally dissimilar in one crucial  respect, however, which Houellebecq himself recognises: Lovecraft  never so much as mentions either sex or money, the two factors which,  since Extension du domaine de la lutte, Houellebecq has established  as the twin poles of his analysis of our social malaise. As a rather  traditional, and also somewhat reclusive, New England gentleman,  Lovecraft considered such matters to be unworthy of his consideration  such that, as Houellebecq remarks, he would have struggled to survive  in our era, in which ‘La valeur d’un être humain se mesure [...] par son  efficacité économique et son potentiel érotique: soit, très exactement,  les deux choses que Lovecraft détestait le plus fort’ (HPL, 144; 116).5  Various critics have suggested that we could see a kind of sexual terror  underpinning Lovecraft’s imagery of viscous, tentacular creatures,6 but  Houellebecq suggests that we are wrong to psychoanalyse Lovecraft’s  tales, which are, on the contrary, based on what he calls a ‘matérialisme  absolu’ (‘absolute materialism’ (HPL, 6; 24)). Lovecraft’s creatures are  not ghosts or hallucinations, but should be taken as really existing  in the material world, albeit sometimes on planes or in dimensions  inaccessible to human perception. As Houellebecq comments, ‘Aucun  fantastique n’est moins psychologique, moins discutable’ (HPL, 39;  46).7 If Lovecraft is able to achieve this disconcerting impression  of realism in tales of supernatural horror, it is largely because of  his regular appeal to a scientific language. Houellebecq admires his  ‘systematic use of scientific terms and concepts’ (HPL, 8; 24) and this  is perhaps a significant point of comparison between the two writers.  For Houellebecq relies heavily upon the language of molecular biology  and quantum mechanics in Les Particules élémentaires, as well as on  discourses of evolution in La Possibilité d’une île – as we will see below  – both to offer rational explanations for his characters’ behaviour in the  short term, and, on a grander scale, to justify his visions of seemingly  improbable future mutations. In Houellebecq’s words, ‘l’utilisation du  vocabulaire scientifique peut constituer un extraordinaire stimulant  pour l’imagination poétique’ (HPL, 83; 74).8 Lovecraft’s characters,  notes Houellebecq, have no psychological depth, but effectively take on  the status simply of observers of the unfolding abominations: ‘Leur seule  fonction réelle, en effet, est de percevoir’ (HPL, 75; 68).9 It would be an  exaggeration to say the same of Houellebecq’s narrators and  protagonists,  Morrey, Michel Houellebecq.indd   116 05/02/2013   10:27:21 </page> <page sequence="4"> Science and Religion 117 who, after all, have a significant interior life and an active role in the  events of the narrative. Nonetheless, as we saw in Chapter 1, several of  the male characters in Houellebecq’s fiction, including the narrator of  Extension, Michel Djerzinski, and, at times, Bruno – as a function of  their effective exclusion from the sexual economy – are cast in the role  of impotent observers of a system whose rules of operation they dispas- sionately adumbrate, while being unable to penetrate it. Houellebecq  notes that, in Lovecraft, the most unspeakable horrors are always  precisely dated and situated (the author often providing coordinates in  degrees of longitude and latitude for more exotic locations), this subtle  construction of a realistic topos ultimately serving no other goal than  to ‘préparer les passages d’explosion stylistique’ (HPL, 103; 88)10 in  which Lovecraft drops his reserve and gives vent to the most unpleasant  contents of his imagination. Arguably, Houellebecq’s style achieves a  similar effect when his scientific vocabulary, the dry tone of sociological  documentation, the inclusion of low-end brand names and all the  bathetic familiarity of his fictional worlds give way to full-throated  rants and the most socially unacceptable outpouring of sexist, racist and  misanthropic sentiment. For another point of comparison between Houellebecq and  Lovecraft is that both writers have been identified as reactionaries.  As Houellebecq says of the American, ‘il méprise l’argent, considère la  démocratie comme une sottise et le progrès comme une illusion’ (HPL,  28; 39).11 There is surely a degree of identification with these qualities  on Houellebecq’s part, which would account for what Frédéric Sayer  sees as the ‘compromising enthusiasm’ with which they are discussed  in H. P. Lovecraft.12 Lovecraft was also, was especially, a racist, and  Houellebecq describes the way in which his ignorant, old-fashioned  sense of racial superiority mutated, following direct contact with the  poor, multiracial neighbourhoods of New York City, into a brutal,  paranoid, phobic hatred. In his correspondence, Lovecraft described  the immigrants of the Lower East Side in the same terms of a slimy,  amorphous substance that he reserves for the monsters of his fictions.  What has sometimes been rather hastily labelled as Houellebecq’s own  racism rarely seems to proceed from this kind of deep-seated psycho- logical insecurity; instead, it can more often be attributed to a deliberate  provocation – as in Plateforme – or to an unthinking, and unformulated,  nostalgia for white male privilege in an age where the criteria of social  value have shifted ground, with traditional codes of honour and dignity,  manners and learning, having been largely replaced in the public sphere  Morrey, Michel Houellebecq.indd   117 05/02/2013   10:27:21 </page> <page sequence="5"> 118 Michel Houellebecq by physical fitness, sex appeal and self-confident presentation. But  a degree of sympathy is nonetheless perceptible when Houellebecq  describes Lovecraft’s horrified incomprehension of African-American  culture. If Lovecraft hates negroes, says Houellebecq, it is because ‘Leur  vitalité, leur apparente absence de complexes et d’inhibitions le terrifient  et le dégoûtent. Ils dansent dans la rue, ils écoutent des musiques  rythmées ... Ils parlent fort. Ils rient en public. La vie semble les amuser;  ce qui est inquiétant. Car la vie, c’est le mal’ (HPL, 142; 113).13 This  is, ultimately, Houellebecq’s excuse for Lovecraft’s racism – that it is a  kind of occupational hazard: ‘Les écrivains fantastiques sont en général  des réactionnaires, tout simplement parce qu’ils sont particulièrement,  on pourrait dire professionnellement, conscients de l’existence du Mal’  (HPL, 144–5; 116).14 This is the key to Houellebecq’s reading of Lovecraft – this idea  that ‘la vie, c’est le mal’.15 After all, let us not forget the all-important  subtitle of the book: Contre le monde, contre la vie (Against the world,  against life). This is where Houellebecq finds his strongest bond with  the American horror writer. Because, in Houellebecq’s interpretation,  Lovecraft’s world view can be reduced to a simple affirmation: ‘l’univers  est une chose franchement dégoûtante’ (HPL, 74; 67).16 For all his appeal  to science as a way of anchoring his fictions in the real world, Lovecraft  ultimately rejects literary realism in favour of the fantastic, and the  reason, according to Houellebecq, is that ‘La vie est douloureuse et  décevante [...] Sur la réalité en général, nous savons déjà à quoi nous en  tenir; et nous n’avons guère envie d’en apprendre davantage’ (HPL, 13;  29).17 We might compare Houellebecq’s own proclivity for imagining  utopian futures, out of a firm belief that nothing more is to be obtained  from this world. In a key paragraph of H. P. Lovecraft, we can witness  Houellebecq already developing the language that will make him famous  with Les Particules élémentaires: the sense of life as an arbitrary and  meaningless convergence of dull matter in which all human actions and  aspirations are vain and absurdly deluded as to their capacity to change  the tedious facts of the universe: Peu d’êtres auront été à ce point imprégnés, transpercés jusqu’aux os par  le néant absolu de toute aspiration humaine. L’univers n’est qu’un furtif  arrangement de particules élémentaires. Une figure de transition vers le  chaos. Qui finira par l’emporter. La race humaine disparaîtra. D’autres  races apparaîtront, et disparaîtront à leur tour. Les cieux seront glaciaux  et vides, traversés par la faible lumière d’étoiles à demi mortes. Qui,  elles aussi, disparaîtront. Tout disparaîtra. Et les actions humaines sont  Morrey, Michel Houellebecq.indd   118 05/02/2013   10:27:21 </page> <page sequence="6"> Science and Religion 119 aussi libres et dénuées de sens que les libres mouvements des particules  élémentaires. Le bien, le mal, la morale, les sentiments? Pures ‘fictions  victoriennes’. Seul l’égoïsme existe. Froid, inentamé et rayonnant.18 (HPL,  17–18; 32) This dismal outlook gives rise to the fundamental thesis of Houellebecq’s  book on Lovecraft, which appears to be as much a comment on his own  work as it is on that of the American: that literature, in all senses, is to  be understood as opposed to life. As Houellebecq writes: ‘Quand on  aime la vie, on ne lit pas. On ne va guère au cinéma non plus, d’ailleurs.  Quoi qu’on en dise, l’accès à l’univers artistique est plus ou moins réservé  à ceux qui en ont un peu marre’ (HPL, 14; 30).19 As such, Lovecraft’s  work could be most usefully recommended to those who feel a certain  aversion to life. Lovecraft, concludes Houellebecq, fulfilled the highest  mission of literature: ‘Offrir une alternative à la vie sous toutes ses  formes, constituer une opposition permanente, un recours permanent  à la vie’ (HPL, 150; 119).20 But, in thus succeeding, literature is also,  somewhat paradoxically, opposed to death, since it comes to represent,  for the writer, the only alternative to suicide. Houellebecq delights in  pointing out that Lovecraft wrote, for several years, with a bottle of  cyanide within reach. All of these themes – the hatred of life, the opposition between life and  literature, and the role of writing in preserving from suicide – are thus  set out in H. P. Lovecraft, Houellebecq’s first published work, prior to  receiving their most programmatic expression in Houellebecq’s ‘Method’  Rester vivant, also first published in 1991. Here too, Houellebecq argues  that the poet must cultivate ‘un profond ressentiment à l’égard de la  vie’, which is ‘nécessaire à toute création artistique véritable’ (RV, 11).21  Writing, again, is opposed to life, to the extent that ‘Apprendre à devenir  poète, c’est désapprendre à vivre’ (RV, 11).22 For to choose literature is  to choose truth and ‘Vous ne pouvez aimer la vérité et le monde’ (RV,  27).23 Instead, the writer is a kind of parasite on society, but ‘un parasite  sacré’ (‘a sacred parasite’ (RV, 20)). Too much suffering will prevent  you from writing, says Houellebecq, yet suffering is fundamental, is  primary in the vocation of the writer, writing appearing as an extension  of the scream or inarticulate cry: ‘La poésie, en réalité, précède de peu le  langage articulé’ (RV, 15).24 Yet Houellebecq also stresses that a constant  effort is required to wrestle this primal suffering into a linguistic and  artistic structure because, as we saw in Chapter 1, ‘La structure est le  seul moyen d’échapper au suicide’ (RV, 15).25 Which is essential since,  as the title of this ‘method’ makes clear, a writer can only write so  Morrey, Michel Houellebecq.indd   119 05/02/2013   10:27:21 </page> <page sequence="7"> 120 Michel Houellebecq long as he stays alive: ‘Un poète mort n’écrit plus. D’où l’importance  de rester vivant’ (RV, 19).26 In all other respects, however, the writer is  doomed to failure – ‘le bonheur n’est pas pour vous; cela est décidé, et  depuis fort longtemps’ (RV, 16)27 – just as H. P. Lovecraft, who did not  even succeed in staying alive beyond the age of forty-six, was ‘pénétré  jusqu’à la moelle de son échec, de sa prédisposition entière, naturelle et  fondamentale, à l’échec’ (HPL, 136; 109).28 One of the few critics to pay close attention to H. P. Lovecraft and  Rester vivant is the novelist Nancy Huston who includes a chapter on  Houellebecq in her book Professeurs de désespoir and singles out for  criticism precisely this focus on suffering, failure and despair. Huston  argues that what Houellebecq in Rester vivant calls ‘the subjects no  one wants to hear about’ – his unholy trinity of ‘la maladie, l’agonie,  la laideur’ (‘sickness, ugliness, pain’) (RV, 26) – in fact represent ‘les  sujets de prédilection du courant le plus puissant de la littérature  contemporaine en Europe’.29 Huston traces a lineage of this literature  of despair in twentieth-century Europe (Beckett, Cioran, Kundera,  Thomas Bernhard) and identifies other contemporary authors, such  as Christine Angot, who share this nihilistic outlook. Huston is highly  critical of this tendency in literature, accusing these authors of being  elitist and solipsistic, worse, of being stuck in a perennially adolescent  mindset characterised by thoughtlessness, arrogance and ingratitude.  All readers of Michel Houellebecq have doubtless shared Huston’s  exasperation on occasion, and her deflating of the author’s egotism  is at times welcome, well-observed and amusing. We should be wary,  however, of espousing too closely Huston’s point of view. She may well  be right when she identifies misogyny as an inevitable corollary of this  literary nihilism: all the authors in her corpus are misogynists, claims  Huston, because they hate physical existence and they hold women (and  specifically women’s sexuality) responsible for it. But, if these authors’  attribution of blame to women is always spurious, Huston’s argument  is itself undermined by its essentialising moves. All of these writers of  despair, Huston points out, were childless, or at least, as in the case of  Houellebecq, estranged from their children. It is the lack of time spent in  the company of young children – and hence their limited appreciation of  the capacity for growth, change and renewal – that explains, according  to Huston, these authors’ bleak and irredeemable outlook on the passage  of time, on mortality and on death itself. Huston complains at the  way the childless have ‘monopolised’ literary discourse in Europe.30  But there is a suspiciously heteronormative flavour to this argument,  Morrey, Michel Houellebecq.indd   120 05/02/2013   10:27:22 </page> <page sequence="8"> Science and Religion 121 a paranoid sense that celibates and queers are running the world, that  fails to recognise the extent to which the promotion of the monogamous  couple and the family unit remains an officially sanctioned discourse,  against which the literature of nihilism derided by Huston can be read  as a discourse of contestation. Huston is doubtless right to identify  the German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer as the grandfather, or  godfather, of this nihilist strain in European thought and literature, but  her argument ultimately fails to rise above the banal conclusion that ‘il  manquait d’amis; il manquait d’amour!’.31 This is precisely the kind of  patronising dismissal of the depressed and loveless that Houellebecq  satirised in Extension du domaine de la lutte and that, in our first  chapter, we sought to move beyond. This kind of condescending remark  is inadequate because it dispenses with the need to ask why – that is, for  what reasons tied to the socio-economic structure of our communities  – certain individuals find themselves living without friends, without  sex, without love. Whatever the considerable faults of both authors, we  should take seriously Houellebecq’s engagement with Schopenhauer if  we are to gain a fuller understanding of his diagnosis of our contem- porary condition, and his proposed ‘solutions’. Indeed, just the same kind of painful, unhappy material that is  discussed in Houellebecq’s writing about H. P. Lovecraft – misery,  failure, futility, horror – can also be found in Houellebecq’s appreciation  for Schopenhauer. Houellebecq has spoken frequently of his admiration  for Schopenhauer, and often quotes or paraphrases the philosopher in his  fictional works in support of his own views.32 In Plateforme, the narrator  borrows from Schopenhauer to bolster his assertion that our own past  is largely forgotten, meaningless and unimportant, all of which would  seem to belie our cherished belief in the singularity and irreplaceability  of every human life: ‘On se souvient de sa propre vie, écrit quelque part  Schopenhauer, un peu plus que d’un roman qu’on aurait lu par le passé’  (P, 175; 181).33 In La Possibilité d’une île, Schopenhauer is called upon to  confirm the grim evolutionary psychology underpinning the novel (and  which we will discuss in detail in the section below): ‘lorsque l’instinct  sexuel est mort, écrit Schopenhauer, le véritable noyau de la vie est  consumé’ (PI, 217; 189).34 In his important essay ‘Approches du désarroi’,  Houellebecq pastiches the title of Schopenhauer’s magnum opus The  World as Will and Representation with the subheading ‘Le monde  comme supermarché et comme dérision’ (‘The world as supermarket  and derision’), but he does so in order to lament the degradation of  Schopenhauer’s concepts. Thus the sovereign will has been debased by  Morrey, Michel Houellebecq.indd   121 05/02/2013   10:27:22 </page> <page sequence="9"> 122 Michel Houellebecq what Houellebecq calls ‘un éparpillement des désirs’ (‘a scattering of  desires’), while representation has lost all innocence in the generalised  rhetoric of advertising and publicity, constantly undermined by irony,  sarcasm and self-reflexivity (I, 71–4/I2, 36–9/RV, 49–50). For Schopenhauer, as for Houellebecq, life is struggle and life is  suffering. Schopenhauer writes that ‘the life of the individual is a  constant struggle, and not merely a metaphorical one against want or  boredom, but also an actual struggle against other people’.35 Nor is any  alternative to this suffering imaginable. Even in a Utopia, even one – such  as might appeal to Houellebecq – ‘where lovers find one another without  any delay and keep one another without any difficulty’, still ‘some men  would die of boredom or hang themselves, some would fight and kill  one another, and thus they would create for themselves more suffering  than nature inflicts on them as it is’.36 In the same way, in Houellebecq’s  Rester vivant, suffering is the starting point and the point to which  we (or Houellebecq, or the poet) must always return: ‘Le monde est  une souffrance déployée’ (RV, 9),37 reads the first line of Rester vivant,  followed a couple of pages later by: ‘souffrir, toujours souffrir’ (RV,  11)38 and ‘Et revenez toujours à la source, qui est la souffrance’ (RV,  11).39 In short, as Place-Verghnes suggests, ‘la souffrance est le concept  fondateur de l’idéologie houellebecquienne, celui dont tout dérive’.40 For  Schopenhauer, misfortune is never an exception or an accident in life:  it is the rule. As one grows older, disappointment is inevitable with a  life that ‘promised so much and performed so little’,41 a constant refrain  in Houellebecq’s work and especially, as we shall see, in La Possibilité  d’une île. But, if this vision of the world is unrelentingly bleak, it need  not necessarily mean that the work itself is constantly depressing.  Because, as Nietzsche pointed out with his customarily counter-intuitive  insight, it is rarely depressing to read the calm and confident assertion  of hard-won truths, however upsetting they may be: ‘The true thinker  always cheers and refreshes,’ wrote Nietzsche, provided he expresses his  truths ‘with certainty and simplicity, courage and strength’.42 Schopenhauer believes that all one’s happiness, all one’s successes  and pleasures in life are but a dull background against which the  slightest pain or vexation takes centre stage in our consciousness;  he theorises, in short, ‘the negativity of well-being and happiness, in  antithesis to the positivity of pain’.43 We can certainly recognise this  tendency in Houellebecq’s protagonists who, despite their objectively  comfortable and gratifying positions within society – as scientist or civil  servant, or even as a successful comedian in the case of Daniel in La  Morrey, Michel Houellebecq.indd   122 05/02/2013   10:27:22 </page> <page sequence="10"> Science and Religion 123 Possibilité d’une île – seem to focus unrelentingly on negative thoughts:  their lacklustre sex lives, the meaninglessness of existence, the physical  ailments of their ageing bodies, and the casual aggravations of other  people. In Schopenhauer’s assessment, humanity’s needs are basically  the same as those of other large animals – food, shelter and sex – yet  human beings feel the burden of these needs all the more keenly because  of our capacity for memory and anticipation. As a result, we fix upon  objects which intensify our pleasure and our pain: drugs, luxuries,  specific love objects, the opinion of others... Life becomes a struggle to  achieve goals, but the attainment of those goals, instead of delivering  us of the burden of need, creates a new burden that we experience as  boredom. Schopenhauer writes: That human life must be some kind of mistake is sufficiently proved by  the simple observation that man is a compound of needs which are hard  to satisfy; that their satisfaction achieves nothing but a painless condition  in which he is only given over to boredom; and that boredom is a direct  proof that existence is in itself valueless, for boredom is nothing other  than the sensation of the emptiness of existence. For if life, in the desire  for which our essence and existence consists, possessed in itself a positive  value and real content, there would be no such thing as boredom: mere  existence would fulfil and satisfy us.44  Thus, even if Houellebecq’s heroes achieved their apparently predominant  aspiration of a lively and fulfilling sexual relationship with a nubile  young woman, we can only presume that they would, in time, grow  bored and frustrated with the arrangement. Houellebecq’s heroines, as  we have seen, tend to be hastily dispatched in a cruel and improbable  deus ex machina, but the reader can surely harbour few illusions  that, say, Bruno and Christiane would live happily ever after, even  without her sudden paralysis, given all that Houellebecq has written  elsewhere about the eclipse of sentiment in the ageing couple. As  Julian Young has commented in relation to Schopenhauer’s philosophy:  ‘Paradoxically, the pain of satisfied willing is of exactly the same nature  as the pain of unsatisfied willing’.45 Young has rightly pointed out that  what Schopenhauer describes as boredom might more properly today  be understood as depression (and we have seen the significance of the  depressive discourse in Houellebecq’s writing, especially Extension du  domaine de la lutte). Thus, for Schopenhauer, to will is to suffer, but the  lack of will leads to boredom, which is also suffering. ‘When nothing  engages one’s will it is not the case that one enters a state of will-lessness.  The “pressure” of the will persists. In other words, though there is no  Morrey, Michel Houellebecq.indd   123 05/02/2013   10:27:22 </page> <page sequence="11"> 124 Michel Houellebecq state of affairs in the world we will to achieve, we wish that there were  such a state of affairs. We experience, in other words (to borrow a phrase  from Heidegger), “the will to will” ’.46 The will, in other words, cannot be extinguished. For Schopenhauer,  the will itself is imperishable, but, because it operates within a finite  world, its striving after individual goals is always in vain: ‘Time and that  perishability of all things existing in time that time itself brings about is  simply the form under which the will to live, which as thing in itself is  imperishable, reveals to itself the vanity of its striving’.47 Schopenhauer  identifies the will as what Kant called the thing-in-itself, that which  exists independently of our perception. However, we, as individuals, are  not the will as thing-in-itself, rather each of us is a phenomenon of the  will and, as such, subject to the principle of sufficient reason which states  that nothing happens without a definite reason why it should do so. It is  our overlooking of this distinction that accounts for what Schopenhauer  sees as the illusion of free will:  Hence we get the strange fact that everyone considers himself to be a  priori quite free, even in his individual actions, and imagines he can at  any moment enter upon a different way of life, which is equivalent to  saying that he can become a different person. But a posteriori through  experience, he finds to his astonishment that he is not free, but liable to  necessity; that notwishstanding all his resolutions and reflections he does  not change his conduct, and that from the beginning to the end of his  life he must bear the same character that he himself condemns, and, as it  were, must play to the end the part he has taken upon himself.48 Schopenhauer’s concept of will is therefore not to be confused with our  prosaic sense of free will as desire; rather, Schopenhauer’s will is ‘the  being-in-itself of every thing in the world [...] the sole kernel of every  phenomenon’.49 As a manifestation of will, suggests Schopenhauer,  human desire is no more to be privileged than such phenomena as water  rushing downhill, or magnetic attraction, or electrical current. The  reader of Houellebecq might here be reminded of the famous passage  in Les Particules élémentaires in which the supposedly free actions of  human beings – for instance, voters in a democracy – are compared to  the turbulence of a river as it flows around the supporting pillar of a  bridge. Such movements may be unpredictable, declares Houellebecq,  but that does not justify our calling them free (PE, 227; 270). There is,  in Schopenhauer’s analysis, and we might deduce also in Houellebecq’s,  a distinction to be drawn between human beings, who demonstrate  individual differences, and forces of nature, which operate according to  Morrey, Michel Houellebecq.indd   124 05/02/2013   10:27:22 </page> <page sequence="12"> Science and Religion 125 universal laws; but this does not imply that people act without predeter- mination, only that a given stimulus will affect different individuals  in different ways. In fact, the will has no concern for individualities,  even though the individual may struggle to grasp this concept as she  can only experience the will through herself. The consequence of all  this, for Schopenhauer, is that we place far too much importance on  our individual existence and identity, failing to understand that they  are merely manifestations of the universal will to live. Our attachment  to our individuality is, at bottom, ‘childish and altogether ludicrous’.50  Finally, then, the only redemption we can hope to achieve from suffering  comes through denial of the will. The will as thing-in-itself can never  be countered, but individual desires, once they have been recognised  as transient, meaningless and necessarily leading to further suffering,  should be repudiated in order to minimise suffering. (Houellebecq’s  sympathy for this doctrine also explains his attraction to Buddhism,  which, as we shall see in the final section of this chapter, is mentioned  appreciatively on various occasions in his work. The proximity between  the central tenets of Schopenhauer’s philosophy and those of Buddhism  has been frequently noted, beginning with the philosopher himself.) In  particular, Schopenhauer stresses that sexual desire is ‘the quintessence  of this noble world’s imposture, since it promises so excessively much and  performs so miserably little’.51 And Walter Wagner has suggested that the  apparent nihilism of Houellebecq’s heroes demands to be understood, in  Schopenhauerian terms, as a negation of the will that is the cause of all  our suffering.52 Nietzsche, too, in his commentary on Schopenhauer in  the essay ‘Schopenhauer as Educator’, argues that, in focusing on the  satisfaction of our desires, we barely raise ourselves above the level of  the animal, since we ‘only desire [...] more consciously what the animal  seeks through blind impulse’.53 It is only through the denial of the will  that we can begin to look upon the human, not as our given state, but  as a horizon of possibility, which, ‘in common with all nature, we are  pressing towards’.54 For Nietzsche, in other words, our humanity is an  unfinished project, and it is only by creating the conditions of emergence  for that which is best in the human that we may give evolution a helping  hand: ‘nature has done badly, [the young person] should say to himself;  but I will honour its great intentions by serving it so that one day it may  do better’.55 Let us now turn to La Possibilité d’une île and see how  Houellebecq creates a narrative to encapsulate precisely this argument:  that humanity’s suffering is the result of its focus on individual desire,  which makes us only superficially distinct from the brutal evolutionary  Morrey, Michel Houellebecq.indd   125 05/02/2013   10:27:22 </page> <page sequence="13"> 126 Michel Houellebecq tussle that unites the other animals in strife; that this suffering can only  be overcome through a rejection of individual desires, which would  ultimately entail the relinquishing of individual identity itself and,  thereby, a managed acceleration of the evolutionary process. A cloned future: La Possibilité d’une île As with so many of Houellebecq’s other books, La Possibilité d’une île  can be read, in some ways, as a kind of disguised autobiography. Just  as various critics have naively mistaken the narrators of Houellebecq’s  previous novels for the author himself, and prior to Houellebecq’s  mischievous self-portrait in La Carte et le territoire, the principal narrator  and protagonist of La Possibilité d’une île seemingly invites readers to  draw similar comparisons to the author.56 Following Houellebecq’s  post-Particules success, the narrator of his latest novel is no longer the  sluggish and depressive civil servant of earlier works, but has become  a fêted public figure. Rather than a novelist, Daniel is a comedian, but  his preferred material bears close resemblance to Houellebecq’s own  cherished themes. Daniel first comes to public attention by satirising the  conventions of tourism with a sketch set in the breakfast buffet of an  all-inclusive holiday resort in Turkey (PI, 19–20; 11–12). Having achieved  his success, however, Daniel rapidly runs out of ideas, all of his routines  are variations on the theme of the disparities separating individuals  in terms both of material wealth and sex appeal (PI, 21–2; 13).57 He  becomes known for his ‘franchise tout à fait anormale’ (‘completely  abnormal frankness’ (PI, 35; 26)), which gains him a reputation, much  to his displeasure, as a humanist: ‘un humaniste grinçant, certes, mais  un humaniste’ (PI, 22; 14).58 Later in the novel, Daniel turns his back  on comedy and Aurélien Bellanger suggests that this, too, reflects  Houellebecq’s own trajectory, his move away from facile humour in  his more mature works (a tendency certainly born out in La Carte et le  territoire).59 Daniel seems to consider himself essentially as an individual  of mediocre talent who hit upon an idea that struck a nerve with the  public. This sense emerges indirectly through a rather self-mocking  comment upon Vladimir Nabakov: despite bad-mouthing the author’s  style – which is said to resemble ‘une pâte feuilletée ratée’ (‘a collapsed  pastry’ (PI, 31; 22)) – Daniel notes that the enduring fascination with  Lolita (1955) would seem to suggest that Nabakov ‘est tombé sur quelque  chose d’essentiel’ (‘stumbled upon something essential’ (PI, 31; 22)). Morrey, Michel Houellebecq.indd   126 05/02/2013   10:27:22 </page> <page sequence="14"> Science and Religion 127 If this portrait of Daniel reads like a displaced commentary on  Houellebecq’s own success, then the sense of self-reference is heightened  by the fact that questions of autobiography are inserted meta-textually  into the novel through the narrative’s split focalisation: chapters formed  out of Daniel’s first-person narration alternate with shorter chapters  voiced by clones of Daniel existing some time in the distant future and  who comment upon the first Daniel’s account. Over the course of the  novel, we learn how the conditions of this cloned future came about.  In one of the first accounts of the clones, we are told that the goal of  digitally encoding and storing personalities in order to download them  into the neural circuits of cloned descendants was abandoned once  a theoretician by the name of Pierce declared that personality could  effectively be reduced to memory. As a result, the future clones share  in their ancestor’s identity simply by reading and studying the written  account of their life (PI, 27; 18). Much later it becomes clear that it  was in fact Daniel’s own autobiography that provided the model for  this transferral of identity and cultural memory to be adopted by the  entire community of neo-humans (as they are known) (PI, 303; 267).  This process thus provides the opportunity, within the novel, for a  very brief commentary on the practice of life-writing, as voiced by the  twenty-fourth clone of Daniel: ‘Concernant le récit de vie, il n’y a pas de  consigne précise. Le début peut avoir lieu en n’importe quel point de la  temporalité, de même que le premier regard peut se porter en n’importe  quel point de l’espace d’un tableau; l’important est que, peu à peu,  l’ensemble resurgisse’ (PI, 27; 18).60 This remark appears not only as  comment upon La Possibilité d’une île as displaced autobiography, but  also upon its novelistic structure, which proceeds in fragmentary and  sometimes confusing fashion, only gradually building up to a portrait of  the collapse of a civilisation and its replacement by another. As elsewhere in Houellebecq’s work, the principal lesson to be learned  from the account of Daniel’s life relates to the unrelenting disappointment  of life and the pain of individual identity. The stress here, as in the  previous novels, is above all on failure. Indeed, the cloned voice that  speaks in a curiously apocalyptic tone in the novel’s prologue declares:  ‘Le moi est la synthèse de nos échecs’ (PI, 15; 7).61 Daniel’s success as a  comedian makes him rich but his life remains unremarkable: ‘J’habitais  un trois pièces banal, dans le XIVe arrondissement, et je n’avais jamais  couché avec une top model’ (PI, 30; 21).62 From his own perspective,  Daniel’s life remains largely empty and meaningless. Despite his consid- erable wealth, he continues to do his own housework because ‘l’idée  Morrey, Michel Houellebecq.indd   127 05/02/2013   10:27:22 </page> <page sequence="15"> 128 Michel Houellebecq qu’un être humain, si insignifiant soit-il, puisse contempler le détail  de mon existence, et son vide, m’était devenue insupportable’ (PI, 133;  113–14).63  But Daniel’s gloomy frankness, even if it is expressed in the context of  a comic routine, appears out of place in a society which places so much  stress on enjoyment. As Isabelle comments: ‘ce que nous essayons de créer  c’est une humanité factice, frivole, qui ne sera plus jamais accessible au  sérieux ni à l’humour, qui vivra jusqu’à sa mort dans une quête de plus en  plus désespérée du fun et du sexe; une génération de kids définitifs’ (PI,  36; 26).64 In such a culture, the expression of moral sentiments is unusual  enough to catch an interlocutor’s attention but is unlikely to be taken  seriously (PI, 211; 184), just as it is difficult to believe, in this radically  atheistic society, that anyone can believe in God without a trace of irony  (PI, 252; 221). This is, after all, the same society in which an unrepentant  cannibal can claim to have shared an ‘intense religious experience’ with  his victim, willingly recruited via the internet, while they tasted together  the latter’s sectioned penis (PI, 308; 271). Notions such as good and evil  are altogether irrelevant to this generation, as Daniel suggests when he  observes Esther – the young actress with whom he has fallen in love –  snorting cocaine and describes her as a ‘petit animal innocent, amoral,  ni bon ni mauvais, simplement en quête de sa ration d’excitation et de  plaisir’ (PI, 330; 291–2).65 Daniel cannot fit in with Esther and her young  friends because, simply, ‘je n’avais pas le moins du monde la tête de  quelqu’un avec qui on aurait pu envisager de s’amuser’ (PI, 310; 273).66  In short, with the typical hesitation between registers that we observed  in our first chapter, Houellebecq in La Possibilité d’une île charts the  stages of an irreversible decadence in this society, but he does so with so  many shrugging understatements. Thus, Daniel announces nothing less  than ‘le naufrage d’une civilisation’ (‘the shipwreck of a civilisation’),  but remarks only that it is ‘sad’: ‘disons que c’est un peu triste; il y a des  choses plus tristes, à l’évidence’ (PI, 343; 302–3).67 One clear manifestation of this self-centred and pleasure-seeking  culture is the rejection of children. Daniel remarks upon the appearance  of ‘child-free zones’, housing complexes in Florida to which children are  simply forbidden access, in this society in which people are increasingly  ready to admit that they just do not want ‘les tracas et les charges associés  à l’élevage d’une progéniture’ (PI, 67; 54).68 The Elohimites, the religious  sect whose experimentations sow the seeds of the neo-human future,  are part of this movement against children, adopting the old anti-drugs  slogan ‘Just say no’ with regard to procreation. The neo-humans, when  Morrey, Michel Houellebecq.indd   128 05/02/2013   10:27:22 </page> <page sequence="16"> Science and Religion 129 they arrive, will do away with childhood altogether, their clones being  created as fully formed adults with the body of an eighteen-year-old,  the whole process of embryogenesis – and, by implication, childhood  development itself – regarded as unnecessary and dangerous, open to  ‘deformations and errors’ (PI, 236; 207). As so often in Houellebecq’s  fiction, his narrator, Daniel, is as much a symptom of the process he is  describing as he is its dispassionate analyst. Daniel himself has a son,  but takes no interest in him whatever. He leaves his first wife shortly  after she becomes pregnant and feels nothing when his son commits  suicide. As we mentioned in Chapter 1, this affectless apprehension of  Daniel’s son’s death rapidly became a famous and much-quoted example  of Houellebecq’s style: ‘Le jour du suicide de mon fils, je me suis fait  des œufs à la tomate’ (PI, 28; 19);69 but the subsequent lines are no less  shocking in their cold appraisal of the situation: ‘Je n’avais jamais aimé  cet enfant: il était aussi bête que sa mère, et aussi méchant que son père.  Sa disparition était loin d’être une catastrophe; des êtres humains de ce  genre, on peut s’en passer’ (PI, 28–9; 19).70 Much later in the novel, Daniel  even has the gall to claim that his neglect of his son was the one heroic  act of his life since he thereby spared both of them a bitter and strained  relationship with the inevitable transmission of bad habits and neuroses  from father to son: ‘j’avais refusé la chaîne, brisé le cercle illimité de la  reproduction des souffrances, et tel était peut-être le seul geste noble, le  seul acte de rébellion authentique dont je puisse me prévaloir à l’issue  d’une vie médiocre’ (PI, 385; 343).71 One of the key insights of La Possibilité d’une île revolves around a  structural aporia affecting the question of age in the decadent society in  which the novel is set. This civilisation of fun prizes nothing so much  as youth since it is based essentially around youthful activities (sports,  popular music, drink and drugs, sex) and the values of beauty and sex  appeal. But, since this civilisation also coincides with a falling birth  rate, due to the self-centred rejection of children, it is also saddled with  an ageing population so there is therefore an increasingly large section  of society that is effectively excluded from this dominant ethos of fun.  Houellebecq identifies a ‘fascination pure pour une jeunesse sans limites’  (PI, 41; 31)72 in which more and more people of all ages are trying to  act young, heedless of the ridicule to which they may be exposing  themselves. But the actual window of possibility an individual enjoys in  which to exploit to the full all the experience life has to offer is absurdly  narrow (say, from around sixteen to twenty-two years of age). Only a  handful of people have the confidence, the affluence and the physical  Morrey, Michel Houellebecq.indd   129 05/02/2013   10:27:22 </page> <page sequence="17"> 130 Michel Houellebecq beauty required to make the most of these years, and those people will  spend the rest of their lives jaded, having already seen and done it all (this  is the case with Esther in La Possibilité d’une île). Everyone else, having  missed their opportunity, will spend the rest of their lives wondering  what it would have been like and harbouring resentments towards the  people who would not then, or will not now, allow them to realise their  full capacity for pleasure. In a throwaway line that recalls the Swiftian  suggestions of Plateforme, Daniel even wonders why teenagers should  not be forced into prostitution for the good of the (older) majority,  ‘seul moyen pour eux de rembourser dans une faible mesure les efforts  et fatigues immenses consentis pour leur bien-être’ (PI, 212; 185).73  Alas, the media focus on the eroticisation of ever younger bodies is  accompanied by the hysterical persecution of paedophilia, the society of  the spectacle rendering unthinkable, in one moment, the very pleasures  it had promised a moment before. ‘Dans le monde moderne on pouvait  être échangiste, bi, trans, zoophile, SM, mais il était interdit d’être  vieux’ (PI, 209; 182).74 As he has done elsewhere, Houellebecq remarks,  in La Possibilité d’une île, upon the inevitable decline in the sexual desire  it is possible to feel for ageing bodies, noting that the eclipse of desire is  swiftly followed by the disapparance of tenderness. The whole system is  remarkable for its ruthlessness: ‘Jeunesse, beauté, force: les critères de  l’amour physique sont exactement les mêmes que ceux du nazisme’ (PI,  72; 59).75 Indeed, later in the novel, the cruel neglect of those who have  passed beyond the age of desirability will be described as a holocaust: ‘un  pur et simple holocauste de chaque génération au profit de celle appelée  à la remplacer, holocauste cruel, prolongé, et qui ne s’accompagnait  d’aucune consolation, aucun réconfort, aucune compensation matérielle  ni affective’ (PI, 385; 343).76 What is worse, it seems there is nothing  older people can do about this situation, since rebellion, too, like sex,  appears to be the exclusive preserve of the young (PI, 212; 184–5). With  acidic irony, Houellebecq points out that those liberals who once – in  the sixties and seventies – militated in favour of free love, without ever  benefiting from it, are now the same ones who militate in favour of  euthanasia or assisted suicide, without grasping the self-defeating logic  that unites the two by simply consolidating the social status, power and  privilege accorded to an increasingly narrow band of attractive youths.  Daniel24 reports from the future that, in the years following Daniel1’s  life, suicides, euphemistically renamed ‘departures’ became the rule for  almost 100 per cent of human beings beyond a certain age, which, as  a global average, was around sixty, but in the most developed nations  Morrey, Michel Houellebecq.indd   130 05/02/2013   10:27:22 </page> <page sequence="18"> Science and Religion 131 was as low as fifty (PI, 89; 74). The Elohimites, and certain eastern  cultures, even develop elaborate public ceremonies for these rituals of  departure. Of course, the viciously ironic portrayal of the Dignitas clinic  in La Carte et le territoire – culminating in the wish-fulfilment fantasy  that sees Jed Martin beating up the manager of the organisation that  profited from his father’s death – serves as further dour warning against  the encroaching acceptance of euthanasia, which, in Houellebecq’s eyes,  risks becoming an imposition rather than a choice.  For Houellebecq, it seems, this whole depressing situation – the  ruthless sexual competition for access to nubile bodies and the equally  unmerciful sidelining of the old – despite the particular characteristics it  takes on in contemporary society, can be seen to stem ultimately from a  deep atavistic heritage, and the frequent comparisons to other animals in  Houellebecq’s work, pointed out in Chapter 1, serve to underline these  aspects of human behaviour as so many evolutionary facts. Man’s sexual  response to a woman’s touch continues to partake of ‘la domination du  singe’, argues Houellebecq, ‘il serait stupide de l’ignorer’ (PI, 94; 79).77  As a comedian, Daniel senses that, although he may successfully ridicule  dated customs and practices such as ‘religiosity, sentimentalism, devotion,  a sense of honour’ (PI, 226; 198), even the most apparently absurd of  our sexual habits are impervious to scorn since they derive from the  ‘déterminants profonds, égoïstes, animaux de la conduite humaine’ (PI,  227; 198).78 The deep roots of this heritage are made abundantly clear  by observing the behaviour of the ‘savages’, the sorry remnants of the  human race who have survived a long era of war, famine and environ- mental devastation and share the planet of the future with the cloned  neo-humans though without any contact between the two species. The  savages have regressed to a tribal hunter-gatherer lifestyle and the strict  sexual hierarchy of their communities, in which only the strongest,  fittest males have access to the females, is only superficially different  from the sexual melee of our own late-human societies. Then, as now,  the implication, in a society organised around the blind evolutionary  pursuit of the perpetuation of the species, is that once a body has ceased  to be sexually useful it is no longer worth preserving. Daniel25 observes  ceremonies in which the two oldest members of a tribe of savages fight to  the death until the weakest link is summarily dispatched. In our (slightly)  more civilised societies, the older individuals destroy themselves rather  than being destroyed by the community, but the principle remains the  same. As Daniel morosely observes, sex is the only healthy, life-giving  pleasure, and all others – rich food and drink, tobacco and other drugs  Morrey, Michel Houellebecq.indd   131 05/02/2013   10:27:22 </page> <page sequence="19"> 132 Michel Houellebecq – are aimed only at accelerating self-destruction once sex is no longer  available (PI, 383–4; 341). This rather oppressive view of evolution as the  survival of the fittest that pertains in La Possibilité d’une île, as elsewhere  in Houellebecq, is, as I have suggested before,79 a somewhat dated view  that was already criticised by Nietzsche in the late nineteenth century  for being caught up in the ideologies of Victorian population theory  and sexual morality. As Keith Ansell Pearson comments, following  Nietzsche, humanity has not been simplistically subjected to the laws of  nature since prehistoric times, and any attempt to derive a ‘naturalistic  ethics’ from these laws partakes of ‘extreme anthropomorphism’.80 Such  an ethics tends to lead to the reactionary assertion that social change  is impossible as when Daniel admits that he always avoided politics  because ‘la racine de tout mal était biologique, et indépendante d’aucune  transformation sociale imaginable’ (PI, 155; 134).81 This kind of stance  implies an altogether Lamarckian belief in moral heredity, a point of  view which is lent a certain authority in the novel when it is placed in  the mouth of the neo-human Daniel25: ‘il est naturel que ce soient les  individus les plus brutaux et les plus cruels, ceux disposant du potentiel  d’agressivité le plus élevé, qui survivent en plus grand nombre à une  succession de conflits de longue durée, et transmettent leur caractère à  leur descendance’ (PI, 466; 415).82 But, importantly, this evolutionary pessimism is seemingly belied by  the narrative development of La Possibilité d’une île in which humanity  renounces both its atavistic past and its future as a species and gives  itself over to its posthuman, or neo-human, successor. As Daniel24  comments, the rapid decline of humanity ‘a toutes les apparences d’un  suicide collectif’ (PI, 43; 33).83 Daniel25 adds that certain phenomena  of late humanity, such as the environmentalist movement, were  marked by a strange masochism, a certain ‘désir de l’humanité de se  retourner contre elle-même, de mettre fin à une existence qu’elle sentait  inadéquate’ (PI, 444; 396).84 I have remarked elsewhere85 upon how  paradoxical this development appears in La Possibilité d’une île: that  a species so preoccupied with the attainment of short-term pleasures,  and furthermore that has been shown to be in thrall to an evolutionary  logic aimed at preserving the species, should, of its own accord, decide  to resign its tenure as master of the planet and plan its own succession in  the form of a radically different species. It is not difficult to imagine how  a more advanced species would supplant its ancestors through warfare,  or the more efficient exploitaton of resources; but it is completely unprec- edented for a species consciously to invent its evolutionary successor  Morrey, Michel Houellebecq.indd   132 05/02/2013   10:27:22 </page> <page sequence="20"> Science and Religion 133 and then to submit to it. This would appear as a triumph of reason over  desire, which, admittedly, is a possibility that has set humanity apart  for millennia, but has tended to be less visible in the most fundamental  domain of reproduction of the species.86 As Schopenhauer wrote:  If the act of procreation were neither the outcome of a desire nor  accompanied by feelings of pleasure, but a matter to be decided on the  basis of purely rational considerations, is it likely the human race would  still exist? Would each of us not rather have felt so much pity for the  coming generation as to prefer to spare it the burden of existence, or at  least not wish to take it upon himself to impose that burden upon it in  cold blood?87 But, as Elizabeth Grosz has recently argued, we should be wary of  assuming that Darwin’s theory of evolution by natural selection allows  us to determine the future simply on the basis of past evidence. On the  contrary, Darwin’s theory presents us with a complex new understanding  of time in which the relatively short-term scale of reproduction and  individual variation interacts with much longer-term developments in  environmental and climatological conditions, the two scales modulating  each other to determine species evolution. This makes it difficult to  predict the emergence of new forms of life. As Grosz writes: ‘there is  no other future, for Darwin, than that prefigured and made possible by  but not contained in the terms of the present. The future brings what  has been led up to but has never been defined by the past’.88 Besides,  Nietzsche taught that the conservation of species was a ‘superfluous  teleological principle’ and that the real goal of organisms was merely to  discharge their force, with preservation simply a common consequence of  this process.89 It would be possible, therefore, to account for the entirety  of humanity’s imaginative and technological creations as a venting of its  force and, although these feats of ingenuity have often improved rates of  survival, they have also frequently given rise to mass destruction. At any  rate, the question of the ‘usefulness’ of any adaptation, be it physical or  technological, should not only be considered in the short-sighted terms  of the here-and-now of the species but also, following Nietzsche, as  ‘useful in a context yet to be determined, an untimely kind of utility,  useful for those who do not yet exist or are yet to come, useful in  unimaginable contexts’.90 With the difficult question of how we get from here to there, from a  decadent, self-centred humanity to a serene and wise neo-humanity, La  Possibilité d’une île raises the perhaps insoluble problem that Fredric  Morrey, Michel Houellebecq.indd   133 05/02/2013   10:27:22 </page> <page sequence="21"> 134 Michel Houellebecq Jameson has seen at the heart of all utopian narratives, namely the dispute  over whether Utopia requires a ‘radical transformation of subjectivity’ or  whether, on the contrary, its conditions are ‘already grounded in human  nature’, in the ‘needs and desires which the present has merely repressed  and distorted’.91 And we should be in no doubt that La Possibilité d’une  île is indeed a utopian narrative, in the sense that it imagines a different  social organisation in response to the pain caused by various forms of  inequality among human beings. The first step towards this Utopia, as  is often the case, is what Jameson calls ‘the effacement of the private  property of the self’.92 But there is more than one Utopia in La Possibilité  d’une île. The first is represented by the religious sect of the Elohimites  who, after all, form an alternative community based around different  values and principles to mainstream society, and it is they who begin  the experiments in human cloning that will eventually make possible  the neo-humans of the future. The Elohimites practise healthy living,  with careful diet and exercise routines, but the core of their utopian  community is based around an ethos of sexual liberation familiar from  the 1960s and 1970s and already satirised at length by Houellebecq  in Les Particules élémentaires. As we will see in more detail below,  the Elohimites practise a polygamous and polymorphous sexuality,  in particular encouraging women to ‘faire exploser [leur] féminité,  et l’exhibitionnisme qui [leur] est consubstantiel, à travers toutes les  tenues scintillantes, transparentes ou moulantes que l’imagination des  couturiers et créateurs divers avait mises à [leur] disposition’ (PI, 123;  104).93 When not dressed in this way, the Elohimites are inclined towards  naturism, following in this the model of their ‘creators’, the Elohim who  have no need for clothes having achieved a total mastery of climate  on their home planet (PI, 266; 233–4). As the tone of these passages  makes clear, Houellebecq is no more indulgent of the Elohimites in La  Possibilité d’une île than he is of the hippies in Les Particules. As in the  earlier novel, free love turns out to be just an excuse for a minority of  men to multiply their conquests of women. The Prophet enjoys having  his own personal harem and acts as an alpha male such that the other  male faithful dare not approach the women in the entourage, assuming  sexuality to be the sole prerogative of the Prophet (PI, 273–4; 240–1).  The ‘miracle’ that turns Elohimism into a bona fide world religion is  actually a sordid settling of accounts in which an Italian man murders  the Prophet for seducing his wife. The other leaders of the sect turn  this into a publicity stunt, pretending the Prophet has died and been  resurrected in a younger body, that of the man who is in fact his son.  Morrey, Michel Houellebecq.indd   134 05/02/2013   10:27:22 </page> <page sequence="22"> Science and Religion 135 This chimes neatly with the fantasies of eternal youth conjured up by  the sect’s promise of a cloned future and ensures the religion’s rapid  global spread since it is based on the widely popular values of youth  and pleasure. In short, then, the Elohimites’ is a false Utopia, with  its foundations in precisely the same individualism and self-centred  hedonism that it may initially appear to renounce. And, as so often in  Houellebecq, it is difficult to know just how much ironic intent should  be read into this narrative: certainly the Elohimites themselves cannot  be taken seriously, but is the subsequent neo-human Utopia also tainted  by virtue of its origins in this hypocritical and self-serving practical  joke? In this respect, we should perhaps keep in mind Fredric Jameson’s  contention that, even in the work of the classical utopians such as  Thomas More, Fourier, Rousseau or Saint-Simon, it is always difficult to  separate the joker, on the one hand, from the committed social ideologue  on the other, and Jameson suggests that we must resist the temptation to  collapse the one into the other, but instead try to think both together as  two poles that are necessarily in tension in utopian thought.94 The novel’s ‘real’ Utopia, then, is formed by the cloned posthuman  species. The idea for this utopian community (although a ‘community’  is hardly what it turns out to be) originally comes from the Elohimites  who clone the DNA of their adherents with the promise of a future  ‘resurrection’ to eternal life, the assumption being that, at some stage in  the future, it will be possible to store, copy and download the elements  of a personality into a cloned body such that an individual consciousness  will be able to transcend ageing and death. However, this programme is  subsequently adapted, in a rather different way, by the first generations  of clones themselves, in order to create a neo-human species deliberately  distanced from its human ancestors. There are a handful of significant  physical differences between humans and neo-humans. As already  mentioned, the clones bypass the stages of childhood development,  coming into existence as fully formed adults of eighteen years (PI, 236;  207). But, given that, as we have seen, the neo-humans never do master  a technology for downloading personality, there is perhaps insufficient  consideration given as to how, in the absence of a childhood as we  understand it, these clones would learn everything from basic motor  skills to the use of language, since they also exist in isolation, without  the social contact that facilitates learning in humans. The first clones  are given some significant modifications of anatomy, in order to help  them evolve a more efficient system for converting energy. The digestive  tract and anus are eliminated and neo-humans are instead equipped  Morrey, Michel Houellebecq.indd   135 05/02/2013   10:27:22 </page> <page sequence="23"> 136 Michel Houellebecq with photosynthesising cells so they can effectively live off sunlight, with  the addition of a little water and a few mineral salts (PI, 364–5; 324). As  it turns out, it is this genetic modification that allows the neo-humans  to survive the catastrophic climate change that largely wipes out the  human population (PI, 366; 325). Later, when their study of human  history leads neo-humans to believe that the sensitivity of human skin  is partly responsible for the anguish experienced at the lack of a loving  touch, the clones deliberately de-sensitise their nerve fibres in order to  deaden this feeling (PI, 163; 141). These differences alone, although  all achieved by genetic engineering rather than natural mutation, are  sufficient to make of the neo-humans a separate species who feel no  sense of responsibility towards humans and no compulsion to save them  from their self-imposed apocalypse. As Daniel1 prophesies, the new  species ‘n’aurait pas davantage d’obligation morale à l’égard des humains  que ceux-ci n’en avaient à l’égard des lézards, ou des méduses’ (PI, 290;  256).95 In addition to these physical differences, the lifestyle of neo-humans  is very different from our own. Despite the fact that the clones were  initially created as a way of immortalising the lives of the Elohimites,  Daniel25 remarks with some understatement that his own life is far from  that which the first Daniel would have wanted to live (PI, 406; 362). Each  neo-human lives alone in a private, secure compound which he or she in  principle never leaves during the course of his or her existence.96 Despite  their lives being completely separate, they are also practically identical:  as Daniel24 comments, ‘nous nous connaissons isolés mais semblables’97  (PI, 139; 119). As well as being similar to their fellow neo-humans, the  life of each clone is to all intents and purposes identical to that of their  cloned predecessors and successors. With no significant events to mark  their lives, and no desire to become anything other than what their  precursors were, there is no opportunity for what Daniel25 calls ‘la  fiction individuelle’ to take hold (PI, 417; 371). In the early years of the  neo-humans, the founders of this new life put together a manual entitled  Instructions pour une vie paisible (‘Instructions for a Peaceful Life’ (PI,  440; 392)) that laid out in detail the procedure to adopt with regard to  every conceivable event in a neo-human life such that the clones are  never called upon to make individual decisions which, it is presumed,  would lead to desire. For the neo-humans have completely renounced  desire, just as they have totally abandoned sociability: living in groups,  tribes or families may have served a useful evolutionary purpose in  early human societies, but, for the neo-humans, this gregariousness has  Morrey, Michel Houellebecq.indd   136 05/02/2013   10:27:22 </page> <page sequence="24"> Science and Religion 137 become ‘un vestige inutile et encombrant’ (PI, 411; 367),98 along with  the sexuality that tends to go with it. As a result, laughter and tears  rapidly disappear from neo-human life, since the attitudes of cruelty or  compassion that would render possible these physical manifestations of  sentiment are no longer imaginable in this lifestyle (PI, 61–2; 48–9). As  the cloned narrator of the novel’s prologue admits, the joys of human  life are unknowable to neo-humans, but ‘ses malheurs à l’inverse ne  peuvent nous découdre’ (PI, 11; 3).99 The neo-humans believe that desire  and the appetite for procreation are the result of a suffering that comes  to be attached to being itself. They seek to surpass this unhappy fate in  favour of a situation in which being is sufficient in itself and all else is a  matter of indifference: in short, ‘la sérénité parfaite’ (‘perfect serenity’  (PI, 367; 326)). It may well be difficult for many of Houellebecq’s contemporary  readers to see this as a Utopia at all. The neo-humans never go out,  never see each other, have no pleasures to speak of and spend their lives  studying history while maintaining a perfectly static existence so as not  to repeat its mistakes. Surely this must be regarded as more of a dystopia  than a Utopia and it is likely to strike many readers, above all else, as  boring.100 Aurélien Bellanger suggests that La Possibilité d’une île could  be seen as a ‘sceptical re-reading of humanist utopias’ and notes that the  Utopia of the neo-humans seemingly struggles to get started: ‘tous les  éléments semblent en place, une vie nouvelle est à portée de main, mais  c’est pourtant comme si rien n’avait encore commencé’.101 But Fredric  Jameson notes that this criticism – that Utopias are boring – is one that  has been commonly levelled at utopian fictions.102 Jameson provides a  very useful corrective for our expectations regarding such fictions when  he writes: it is a mistake to approach Utopias with positive expectations, as though  they offered visions of happy worlds, spaces of fulfillment and cooperation,  representations which correspond generically to the idyll or the pastoral  rather than the utopia. Indeed, the attempt to establish positive criteria of  the desirable society characterizes liberal political theory from Locke to  Rawls, rather than the diagnostic interventions of the Utopians, which,  like those of the great revolutionaries, always aim at the alleviation and  elimination of the sources of exploitation and suffering, rather than at the  composition of blueprints for bourgeois comfort.103 We need to remember that Houellebecq’s future society is separated  from ours by thousands of years104 and it cannot therefore be expected to  have the same values and preoccupations, even if the values on display in  Morrey, Michel Houellebecq.indd   137 05/02/2013   10:27:22 </page> <page sequence="25"> 138 Michel Houellebecq that future society are necessarily imagined in response to contemporary  ones. We might take a measure of the distance separating Houellebecq’s  neo-humans from ourselves if we consider the implications of their  existence as clones. As a number of commentators have pointed out,105  public fears around cloning, as encouraged by the discourse of popular  media, have tended to focus upon a certain imagined instrumentalisation  of the human. According to this discourse, if human cloning is allowed  to become a reality, we can expect that cloning will be used (1) as a  narcissistic tool for individuals to prolong or repeat their own selves and  their own lives, and (2) as a means of creating more ‘perfect’ individuals,  free from disease, defects, etc., the assumption being that there is (3)  commercial value to be had from such a commodification of the human  (and, following Houellebecq’s extension of the field of struggle, we  might add that there would also be sexual value to be had from it). But,  if the clones in La Possibilité d’une île are, in a sense, ‘improved’, insofar  as they have better health, greater resistance and more longevity, none  of these utopian or dystopian aspirations or fears is realised because (1)  the neo-humans have no narcissism since they have almost no sense of  individual consciousness; (2) it matters little that they live longer since  they do not really do anything with their rigorously identical, repetitive  lives and, besides, death holds no fear for them since they know they will  be replaced by someone who looks identical and leads an identical life;106  and (3) these clones have no value because their ‘society’ has no apparent  commerce, either in goods or in bodies, either financial or sexual. The  point, then, is that the fears and desires that we project on to cloning  – or on to the idea of a cloned ‘super-race’ – are based entirely in our  own current, humanist concerns which are born of our having mortal  bodies marked by individual differences. What Houellebecq stresses in  La Possibilité d’une île is that, for a cloned future-race long divorced  from these facts, such concerns (mortality, individuality, narcissism, the  sexual struggle, business) may cease to have any pertinence, or even any  meaning whatsoever.107 But, if we miss the point entirely by declaring the failure of this  Utopia from the perspective of our own values, we are perhaps justified  in suggesting that the Utopia fails even on its own terms. Because,  rather than be satisfied with this simple, featureless existence, at the  end of the novel, Daniel25 leaves his compound and strikes out alone  in search of something else, following in this the model of Marie23,  another neo-human with whom he has been in virtual contact, and who  has heard rumours of an alternative community of neo-humans living  Morrey, Michel Houellebecq.indd   138 05/02/2013   10:27:22 </page> <page sequence="26"> Science and Religion 139 together on the site of what was once Lanzarote. The experiment of the  neo-humans, in others words, is unsuccessful, because the attempt to  create a purely lucid consciousness delivered of desire ultimately results  instead in ‘la tristesse, la mélancolie, l’apathie languide et finalement  mortelle’ (PI, 430; 383).108 If the goal of the neo-humans was to make  possible a perfectly peaceful, rational existence, then, as Daniel25 bluntly  puts it, ‘mon départ était là pour témoigner de son échec’ (PI, 465;  414).109 Daniel25’s departure gives rise to the long and eerily beautiful  epilogue of La Possibilité d’une île in which the clone crosses the Iberian  peninsula on his journey to Lanzarote. This final section of the novel is  full of imagery that could only be called sublime. The geography of this  journey is sublime in the most traditional sense of occupying a vast scale  that defies the human imagination. Thus, Daniel25’s travel is impeded by  the existence of a great canyon some ten kilometres across and hundreds  of metres deep which runs along a fault line from the ruins of Madrid  all the way through Spain, across the former Mediterranean and deep  into Africa (PI, 432–3; 385–6). The vestiges of the former Spanish capital  are themselves spectacular: in an extensive terrain of asphalt ribbons,  here and there curving up from the ground under the influence of some  subterranean heat wave, Daniel25 only gradually realises that he is in  the old Barajas airport (PI, 459–60; 409). Portugal, meanwhile, has been  replaced by the Grand Espace Gris (‘Great Grey Space’ (PI, 462; 411)), a  vast sloping plane of ash that descends into the former Atlantic Ocean.  The ocean itself has receded enough so that Daniel25 can walk all the  way to Lanzarote, and what he finds there is an archipelago of islands  and sandbanks separated by pools and ponds small enough to swim  across (PI, 469; 418). But it is not the geography alone that makes this  landscape awe-inspiring; it is also the terrifying emptiness of the land,  the evidence of depopulation. For it is in this section of the novel that  we learn most about the decline of humanity, including the euphemis- tically named ‘Première Diminution’ (‘First Decrease’ (PI, 437; 389)),  which occurred when nuclear warheads were detonated in the polar ice  caps, leading to the immersion of practically the whole Asian continent  and dividing the human population by twenty. It is here, too, that the  scattered remains of the human species are made visible to us in all  their abject savagery. And, finally, when Daniel25 reaches Lanzarote  after an epic journey that no human organism could endure, he finds no  other neo-humans but decides nonetheless to remain in this luminous  environment of islands and lakes, the novel ending with the prospect of a  further sixty years of identical, empty, emotionless days (PI, 474; 422–3). Morrey, Michel Houellebecq.indd   139 05/02/2013   10:27:22 </page> <page sequence="27"> 140 Michel Houellebecq The end of La Possibilité d’une île is, then, incredibly, unforgettably  sublime. The resurgence of the sublime is often to be found at the  end of Houellebecq’s narratives: it occurs, to a lesser extent, in Les  Particules élémentaires and, in ironically degraded form, in Extension  du domaine de la lutte and Plateforme, then more soberly in the closing  pages of La Carte et le territoire with their imagery of human industry  and endeavour reclaimed by the impersonal forces of vegetation. I have  suggested, on a previous occasion,110 that this play with the sublime  in Houellebecq’s work is to be greeted with some suspicion since the  sublime, in literature, is so closely bound up with Romantic ideology  and, thereby, with a conservative politics of gender (a politics which has  already been sufficiently demonstrated in Chapter 1). In the traditional  discourse of the sublime, that which threatens the self (the inconceivably  vast, or powerful, or formless phenomenon) ultimately serves to shore  up the self through the establishing of a binary pair that replays the  drama of sexual difference with one term (the sublime, or ‘masculine’  pole) taking the dominant position, while the other (the beautiful, the  ‘feminine’ pole) is seen to solicit protection, affection and ultimately the  desire for reproduction. We might, therefore, be justified in thinking that  with the startling and alienating vista that he provides in his epilogue  Houellebecq is seeking to warn us off the sterile future of the neo-humans  and to redirect our sympathy towards present-day humanity, elsewhere  treated with such disillusionment and contempt. But we should perhaps  not be too hasty to condemn in this way the sublime imagery of  Houellebecq’s novels. After all, before the sublime can be recuperated as  part of a system, it is, first and foremost, that which threatens the system  by exposing thought to its limits. As Jean-François Lyotard comments,  if all thought operates by establishing relations between things, in the  encounter with the sublime, thought is brought into contact with the  absolute, as that which is without relation. Thought can therefore only  think the absolute through a kind of disavowal of this non-relation. As  Lyotard puts it: ‘[La pensée] s’interdit l’absolu pour autant qu’elle le  veut encore. Il en résulte dans la pensée une sorte de spasme’.111 In La  Possibilité d’une île, thought reaches its limits by trying to imagine a  thought that outlasts its own conditions of possibility, that is as a system  of apprehending and organising the world that has evolved in biological  organisms with discrete bodies marked by individual difference with  each ultimately responsible for its own subsistence. What would become  of thought in a species for which individual differences no longer had  any measurable impact upon life, and for whom the most basic concerns  Morrey, Michel Houellebecq.indd   140 05/02/2013   10:27:22 </page> <page sequence="28"> Science and Religion 141 of subsistence – whether of the individual, through nutrients, or of the  species, through procreation – had ceased to operate with any urgency?  Perhaps, in the end, all the sublime imagery that closes La Possibilité  d’une île is a kind of displacement of the anguish, of the spasm  undergone by thought in the effort to think the posthuman, to think  beyond the conditions of its own existence. Religion These questions of the sublime, the absolute and the ineffable lead  us, finally, to one of the most problematic issues in Houellebecq’s  writing – his frequent, but never straightforward, appeal to religion.  As we have repeatedly seen in the course of this book, when faced  with the ruthlessness of market forces – operating, as we now know,  in the sexual sphere just as much as the commercial sector – there is  a persistent sense, in Houellebecq’s writing, that something is missing  from our societies. If little credence is given to politics as a way of  filling this void in contemporary culture, there is a recurring – though  never entirely committed – appeal to religion as offering the promise of  something more than just quantifiable value to the market. Religious  reference is present in Houellebecq’s novelistic enterprise from the very  beginning: Extension du domaine de la lutte opens with an epigraph  from Paul’s Epistle to the Romans, 13:12: ‘The night is far spent, the  day is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us  put on the armour of light’ (EDL, 5; 3). The epigraph picks up on the  sense of righteous indignation implied by the quasi-Marxist phrasing of  the title and seemingly implies that the grim worlds of thankless work  and hopeless sexuality subsequently described in Extension belong to  these ‘works of darkness’ that are ultimately to be shunned in favour of  the path of righteousness.112 At the same time, though, there is a clear  sense, in Extension, that such religious rhetoric has no obvious place in  our society today. When meeting a former classmate who has become a  priest, the narrator is deeply uncomfortable. In a restaurant, when the  priest exhorts the narrator to accept his divine nature, people at the next  table turn to stare (EDL, 32; 30). Doubtless because of this incongruous  effect, Houellebecq sometimes uses religious reference as part of his  disorienting mixture of registers, often alongside more typically sordid  or mundane detail. At the novel’s opening party, where the two depart- mental frumps discuss mini-skirts, the narrator reflects, ‘Leur voix me  Morrey, Michel Houellebecq.indd   141 05/02/2013   10:27:22 </page> <page sequence="29"> 142 Michel Houellebecq paraissaient venir de très haut, un peu comme le Saint-Esprit’ (EDL, 6;  4).113 Later, in one of the narrator’s animal stories, a farmer tasked with  artificially inseminating a cow is described as symbolising God (EDL,  11; 9) and, when the narrator is hospitalised in a psychiatric facility, he  compares himself to Jesus Christ, having the vague sense that ‘j’étais  là pour accomplir un plan préétabli’ (‘I was there to accomplish some  pre-arranged plan’ (EDL, 150; 149)). In Les Particules élémentaires,  meanwhile, Houellebecq documents the growth of ‘New-Age’ spiritu- alities which borrow liberally from a variety of religious traditions in,  as Stephen Hunt puts it, ‘an ever-expanding spiritual marketplace’ or,  following Stark and Bainbridge, the ‘supermarket of faiths’.114 Houellebecq  gives a sense of the homogenising effects of this spiritual hypermarket  when he relates a conversation overheard at the Lieu du Changement:  ‘Pouvait-on assimiler Jésus à Krishna, ou sinon à quoi? Fallait-il préférer  Rintintin à Rusty?’ (PE, 112; 130–1).115 Meanwhile, Houellebecq is clear  that, as with everything else, spiritual exploration is sometimes just a  strategy for improving one’s sex life. As we saw in Chapter 1, Francesco  di Meola’s main interest in the hippy movement is the facility with which  it allows him to attract young women who think they are being liberated  when he takes advantage of them. Elsewhere, religion is revealed as  ceding ever more ground before the superior ability of experimental  science to describe the universe. Thus the discovery of fossil evidence of  bacterial life on Mars ‘contredisait avec violence toutes les constructions  mythiques ou religieuses dont l’humanité fait classiquement ses délices’  (PE, 123; 144).116 And it is with an ironic satisfaction that Houellebecq  reports the predictable opposition of all the monotheistic religions to  Michel Djerzinski’s biotechnological solution to humanity’s troubles  (PE, 308–9; 371). In the light of the preceding survey, it would clearly be overly simplistic  to try to reclaim Houellebecq as a Christian writer, as Vincent Lloyd  seems to want to do in a recent article. Lloyd discusses the prophetic,  near-biblical tone of certain passages of La Possibilité d’une île and  suggests that Houellebecq is concerned with, and seeking to defend, the  traditional theological virtues of faith, hope and love.117 It is certainly  true that there are many biblical echoes in La Possibilité d’une île:  Fanny van Cuenebroeck points to the chapter headings which resemble  biblical chapter and verse references (‘Daniel25,11’, etc.); the fact that the  opening pages come across almost as an encoded text, together with their  prophetic tone; the biblical names of several characters (Daniel, Esther,  Marie); and the way in which the entire novel is placed under the open  Morrey, Michel Houellebecq.indd   142 05/02/2013   10:27:22 </page> <page sequence="30"> Science and Religion 143 question ‘Qui parmi vous mérite la vie éternelle?’ (‘Who, among you,  deserves eternal life?’ (PI, 10; 2)).118 In addition, Aurélien Bellanger has  suggested that the story of the neo-humans, culminating in Daniel25’s  expedition to Lanzarote, is a story of temptation and flight from Eden,  comparable to Genesis.119 Although these references are seemingly very  deliberate, we must, I think, take at face value Houellebecq’s professed  relationship to Christianity which he has discussed at some length in  Ennemis publics. Houellebecq describes how he attended church and  studied the Bible for some ten or twenty years in an authentic attempt  at engagement with Christianity, but that ‘le problème c’est que Dieu,  je n’y crois toujours pas’ (EP, 143; 139).120 Nonetheless, notwithstanding  his intolerance of Islam, it is rare for Houellebecq to make cheap jokes  at the expense of religion, as he does with so many other subjects.  There is clearly some residual respect, or even awe, for genuine faith in  Houellebecq. For instance, the passages quoted above from Extension  du domaine de la lutte result not so much in laughter as in an uneasy  sense of an aspiration towards the holy that is thwarted by the world’s  limitations. And Houellebecq writes very clearly in La Possibilité d’une  île: ‘lorsque [les êtres humains] donnent [...] l’impression d’être animés  par une foi profonde, par quelque chose qui outrepasse l’instinct de  survie, le mécanisme grippe, le rire est arrêté dans son principe’ (PI, 234;  204).121 In Ennemis publics, Houellebecq recognises that a ‘spiritual  principle’ is ‘ce qu’il y a, au monde, de plus difficile à vaincre’ (EP, 113;  109).122 He goes on to argue that however much we may object to the form  of the current religious revival (Christian and Islamic fundamentalism)  we may be obliged to accept that the return of religion is inevitable; it  is, Houellebecq says, his ‘persistent intuition’ that for a society to live  without religion would ultimately be suicidal (EP, 166; 161).123 It is doubtless this position that explains Houellebecq’s interest,  developed in Lanzarote and La Possibilité d’une île, for what he calls  religious sects – what might more properly be called cults in English, had  that term not come to be associated, rather unfairly, with abusive groups  of brainwashed fanatics.124 It is perhaps surprising that Houellebecq  does not choose simply to mock these groups. In summary, his attitude  towards religious cults would appear to be a broad approval, or at least  an understanding, of their aspirations regarding sexual utopianism  and immortality, but a suspicion of their dogmatic leadership and their  reliance on tall tales. In Lanzarote, Rudi, the unhappy Belgian tourist  who eventually decides to join a cult, acknowledges, in a letter to the  narrator, that such a decision tends to be interpreted, in our western  Morrey, Michel Houellebecq.indd   143 05/02/2013   10:27:23 </page> <page sequence="31"> 144 Michel Houellebecq societies as ‘a dramatic personal failing’ (L, 51; 65) because it implies  a renunciation of individual freedom. Ultimately, then, it is perhaps  because – as we have seen throughout this book – Houellebecq is  unfailingly critical of the ideology of individual freedom that he regards  religious cults with some sympathy. In Lanzarote, the cult depicted is  the really existing Raëlian religion, founded by the Frenchman Claude  Vorilhon. Raëlism is commonly described as a ‘UFO cult’ since it teaches  that human life was created and brought to Earth by extraterrestrial  beings who will, one day, return to our planet. What is striking about  Lanzarote is that Houellebecq relates the Raëlian origin narrative as  fact, in the pluperfect tense of the indicative: ‘En 1973, [Claude Vorilhon]  avait rencontré des extraterrestres lors d’une excursion dans le cratère  du Puy de Lassolas. Ceux-ci se faisaient appeler les Elohim; ils avaient  créé l’humanité en laboratoire, bien des millions d’années auparavant  [...] ils avaient délivré un message à Claude Vorilhon’, etc. (L, 34; 39).125  When the narrator is given a questionnaire by an adept inviting him to  calculate his ‘sensual quotient’, he concludes that he is in no danger: ‘on  aurait pu trouver ça dans n’importe quel numéro de Elle’ (L, 34; 40).126  Furthermore, he muses that the idea of life having been brought to Earth  from outer space is, from a scientific point of view, ‘pas complètement  absurde’ (‘not de facto an absurd notion’ (L, 35; 40)) and he can  appreciate the aesthetic reasons for choosing Lanzarote as the probable  site of the Elohim’s return to Earth; he protests only that ‘j’avais tout de  même un peu de mal à y croire’ (L, 36; 43).127 Later, he even comes to  concede that Raël could be a ‘good prophet’ whose ideas may benefit  humanity (L, 53; 70). At the end of the novella, however, a scandal erupts  when it is revealed that the Raëlians organised mass orgies, sometimes  involving children, and, far from showing any remorse about this, the  adepts claim to be ‘à la pointe de l’évolution des mœurs’ (‘part of some  sort of evolving moral avant-garde’ (L, 58; 77)). Raël himself profits  from the scandal in order to present himself as the true prophet, the  real successor of Moses, and to announce ‘un nouvel érotisme sacré’  (‘a new, sacred eroticism’ (L, 60; 80)). In La Possibilité d’une île, the  cult is a fictional entity, but its name (the Elohimites) and many of its  characteristics are clearly borrowed from the Raëlian religion. Prior to  their discovery of the secret of eternal life, the Elohimites are principally  distinguished by their healthy diet and their practice of sensuality (PI,  116; 97–8). Past the age of puberty, any consensual sexual activity is  welcomed and indeed encouraged in this cult, although they value the  expression of femininity over masculinity (PI, 122–3; 103–4). They also  Morrey, Michel Houellebecq.indd   144 05/02/2013   10:27:23 </page> <page sequence="32"> Science and Religion 145 practise naturism (PI, 266; 233–4) and communal love, what the prophet  calls ‘l’amour véritable, non-possessif’ (‘the true, unpossessive love’ (PI,  193; 168)). It turns out, however, that the prophet is essentially an alpha  male who has gathered his own private harem of young ‘fiancées’, who  are reserved for the exclusive use of the Elohim themselves, or, pending  their return to Earth, of their earthly representative, the prophet (PI,  227; 198–9). Houellebecq is, then, always alert to the ways in which any kind  of social institution – here, a new religious movement – can be used  to grant leverage in the sexual marketplace. Clearly, in La Possibilité  d’une île, the prophet’s claim to practise ‘l’amour véritable’ is treated  ironically. Nonetheless, it is the search for love, and the valuing of love  in the rhetoric of religions, that to some extent explains their continued  appeal for Houellebecq. If, as the novels demonstrate, love is the one  figure that is significant by its absence in our sexually liberated – or  liberally sexualised – sphere, then the aspiration towards, or thirst  for, love is one factor that may account for the persistence of religious  feeling. After all, as Houellebecq remarks somewhat incredulously in  Ennemis publics, even committed atheists continue to believe in the  possibility of love, ‘ou du moins à se comporter comme s’ils y croyaient’  (‘or at least behave as though they believe’ (EP, 150; 145)). We saw,  in Chapter 2, that Plateforme has been praised by some critics for its  moving depiction of romantic love. Plateforme offers the only sustained  example in Houellebecq’s writing in which love and sex are united, such  that sex takes on a new meaning: Lorsque j’amenais Valérie à l’orgasme, que je sentais son corps vibrer sous  le mien, j’avais parfois l’impression, fugace mais irrésistible, d’accéder à  un niveau de conscience entièrement différent, où tout mal était aboli.  Dans ces moments suspendus, pratiquement immobiles, où son corps  montait vers le plaisir, je me sentais comme un Dieu, dont dépendaient  la sérénité et les orages. Ce fut la première joie – indiscutable, parfaite.128  (P, 158; 162)  The point of Plateforme’s narrative, for many critics, is the transition that  leads Michel from being an antisocial and rather affectless client of Thai  prostitutes to become Valérie’s devoted lover. In what is effectively an  ancient Judeo–Christian tradition, Michel is redeemed by the discovery  of selfless love. As Nelly Kaprièlian points out, Houellebecq’s trick,  and arguably the reason for his artistic and commercial success, is to  inscribe this ancient narrative within a context (the rather sordid world  Morrey, Michel Houellebecq.indd   145 05/02/2013   10:27:23 </page> <page sequence="33"> 146 Michel Houellebecq of sex tourism) where it seems most unlikely, precisely in order to show  what is missing from our contemporary culture.129 Love and religion,  it seems, are mutually dependent: no religion is possible in a world  without love, and no love is to be found in a world without religion.  Houellebecq states as much quite clearly, and with an unambiguously  religious rhetoric, in Plateforme: ‘En l’absence d’amour, rien ne peut  être sanctifié’ (‘In the absence of love, nothing can be sanctified’ (P, 115;  116)). And, lest we think this phrase is an aberration in Houellebecq’s  discourse, it recurs some sixty pages later. Noting that, in his dedication  to Valérie’s happiness, he is taking an interest in cookery for the  first time in his life, Michel muses simply, ‘L’amour sanctifie’ (‘Love  sanctifies’ (P, 177; 182)). Of course, the other important reason for the persistence of religion,  and another crucial theme in Houellebecq’s work, is the desire to  believe in immortality, or at least in some kind of life after death.  Houellebecq suggests that the promise of eternal life constitutes, for all  the monotheistic religions, ‘un fantastique produit d’appel’ (EP, 171;  166).130 A key insight of Houellebecq’s writing is that it is the techno- logical means actually to achieve this immortality in practice that is  likely to give rise to a resurgence in religion in the twenty-first century.  This may at first appear paradoxical: the ability of science to render  practically possible what was, for centuries, merely an article of faith,  rather than sounding the final death knell of religion, will be responsible  for its revival, since we will need a religion to make sense of the new  givens of human life, and to organise the new community of immortals  (I2, 252–3). This physical immortality is the goal of the new religious  movements in Lanzarote and La Possibilité d’une île. Both invest in  research into human cloning as a means of achieving immortality  ‘dès maintenant et sur cette terre’ (L, 51; 65).131 In other words, these  movements are using science and technology to address problems  that religion has traditionally dealt with ‘de manière beaucoup plus  irrationnelle et métaphorique’ (‘more irrationally and metaphorically’  (L, 51; 66)). The Elohimites in La Possibilité d’une île are exploring the  same technology. Their religion takes off thanks to a carefully stage- managed publicity stunt. The prophet is murdered by a jealous husband  of one of his ‘fiancées’ but the other cult leaders decide to make it look  as though he has chosen to ‘abandonner son corps vieillissant pour  transférer son code génétique dans un nouvel organisme’ (PI, 279; 245).132  The prophet’s real (genetic) son agrees to play along in the role of the  resurrected prophet. This apparent physical promise of resurrection  Morrey, Michel Houellebecq.indd   146 05/02/2013   10:27:23 </page> <page sequence="34"> Science and Religion 147 accounts for the sudden dramatic success of the Elohimite religion,  which, as Houellebecq notes, is perfectly in keeping with the Zeitgeist  of the leisure society. The Elohimites have no moral code to impose and  give no particular spiritual significance to the promise of resurrection:  it represents simply ‘la prolongation illimitée de la vie matérielle, c’est- à-dire [...] la satisfaction illimitée des désirs physiques’ (PI, 352; 311).133 The hopeless search for love and the quest for physical immortality  will be familiar themes to all readers of Houellebecq. What has  been less widely recognised, however, in attempts to think through  Houellebecq’s relation to religious ideas, is the frequency with which  his writing offers images of emptiness, stillness and stasis. This is the  final trope in Houellebecq’s work that I would like to associate with  a certain spiritual aspiration since these are all images that may be  seen as conducive to meditation or prayer. It is remarkable that each  of Houellebecq’s full-length novels closes with some sort of image of  stillness or emptiness. At the end of Extension du domaine de la lutte,  the narrator cycles out into the middle of nowhere achieving an almost- transcendent state of physical exhaustion. The end of Les Particules  élémentaires offers both the image of Michel’s monastic lifestyle in  western Ireland, a mysterious region in which ‘tout semble indiquer une  présence’ (PE, 292; 350);134 and the evocation of a posthuman race which  is presumed to be peaceful and serene, having shaken off humanity’s  troubles (indeed, it is only in the light of the novel’s closing pages that  we are in a position to understand the lyrical opening pages in which the  neo-humans are described as living ‘Dans un halo de joie [...] Dans des  après-midi inépuisables’ (PE, 10; 7)135). At the end of Plateforme, Michel  is certainly not happy, but he is at least calm. Following the death of  Valérie, he retires to Pattaya and does nothing, simply waiting for life to  end: ‘Parfois j’allume la climatisation le matin, je l’éteins le soir, et entre  les deux il ne se passe rigoureusement rien’ (P, 348; 359).136 La Possibilité  d’une île closes on an image of a clone in an empty, post-apocalyptic  landscape, living out an endless series of identical days. In La Carte  et le territoire, finally, Jed Martin spends the last thirty years of his  life following the same routine, slowly creating artworks based on the  superimposition of very long, unchanging video images. As we have  seen, there is always some uncertainty among Houellebecq’s readers as  to whether these conclusions are to be taken as utopian or dystopian.  But it does seem that Houellebecq himself looks quite favourably upon  these prospects. Asked by the German weekly Die Zeit to describe his  dream of eternal life, Houellebecq imagines himself living in a cave in  Morrey, Michel Houellebecq.indd   147 05/02/2013   10:27:23 </page> <page sequence="35"> 148 Michel Houellebecq which ‘il ne se passe pas grand-chose’ (‘not a lot happens’ (I2, 179)).  But he claims he does not fear boredom: ‘Je ne trouve pas ennuyeux  de répéter à l’infini ce que j’aime faire’ (I2, 181).137 There is, in many  of Houellebecq’s protagonists, but perhaps especially in the narrator of  Extension and in Plateforme’s Michel, a certain refusal of agitation and  an almost total lack of interests in the traditional sense. When Michel  moves in with Valérie he realises with some consternation that there is  nothing at all he desires to keep from his own apartment (P, 175; 181).  Similarly, when they plan to move to Thailand, Michel intends to spend  his time doing nothing in particular, and is unsure how to explain this  to someone like Jean-Yves who has always been extremely active (P,  318; 329). (A similar lack of understanding persists between the very  unhurried and unidirectional Jed Martin and his formerly dynamic  businessman father (CT, 343).) There would be something almost  monastic about this lifestyle in Houellebecq’s novels were it not for the  residual attachment to sex, which remains much stronger than any will  towards God or the spiritual. It seems, though, that for Houellebecq  the ideal would be a sort of calming of desire. He notes that in a place  like Pattaya where all possible sexual fantasies are cheaply catered for  the paradoxical result in the long run may be an attenuation of desire  (I2, 199). This is certainly what Michel finds, who quickly ceases all  relations with prostitutes. As he says, ‘Si je laissais la passion pénétrer  dans mon corps, la douleur viendrait rapidement à sa suite’ (P, 348;  359).138 There is, in this attitude, some relation to the Buddhist notion of  suffering deriving from attachment to desire which entails enslavement  to an illusory reality. Michel encounters these ideas in his travels in  Thailand, and notes them with some approval (P, 104; 104). Indeed,  in Les Particules élémentaires, Michel Djerzinski insists that not only  Buddhism but all serious religions and philosophies have arrived at the  conclusion that desire is ‘source de souffrance, de haine et de malheur’  (‘a source of suffering, pain and hatred’ (PE, 161; 192)). And Buddhism,  we might note, is the only religion that does not condemn Djerzinski’s  proposal for a genetically modified solution to human suffering (PE,  309; 371). As Françoise Grauby has noted, in Houellebecq, ‘Le bonheur  s’identifie [...] plutôt à une absence d’être’.139 Perhaps this is the ultimate  sense of Houellebecq’s flirtation with religion in his writing: the idea  that happiness is not of this world, indeed, that attachment to the things  of this world can only prevent us from attaining it. On the contrary, the  only kind of serenity we can hope to reach is through a practice akin to  prayer or meditation that momentarily cuts us off from desire.  Morrey, Michel Houellebecq.indd   148 05/02/2013   10:27:23 </page> <page sequence="36"> Science and Religion 149 Conclusion As we have seen elsewhere in this book (see, for instance, the conclusion  to Chapter 1), Michel Houellebecq continues to waver between fully  posthumanist and residually humanist understandings of the world  and this uncertainty leads to many of the apparent contradictions and  inconsistencies within his œuvre. The view of the world put forward  in H. P. Lovecraft and Rester vivant may, at first glance, appear a cold  and ruthless one, stripped of humanist comforts such as the belief in  progress, self-actualisation and the perfectibility of the human. What  remains residually humanist about it, however, is its focus on suffering.  As we saw in the first section of this chapter, these two texts, and  Rester vivant especially, repeatedly stress that the default position of  life is suffering and, following Schopenhauer, that our consciousness of  suffering, and therefore our ability to anticipate it (including the suffering  of old age and death) mean that, as humans, we somehow suffer more  than other animals. From a properly posthumanist view, however, that  replaces species in their evolutionary context – a view that Houellebecq  frequently seems to adopt in his novels, and notably in La Possibilité  d’une île – suffering is irrelevant. What is important is the adaptation  of species to their environment and not the suffering experienced by  individuals as a result of their greater or lesser conformity to the  adaptive model. It is perhaps this hesitancy that Houellebecq inherits  most clearly from Schopenhauer. For Schopenhauer’s concept of the Will  is a properly posthumanist invention: effectively a way of detaching will  from the ephemeral stirrings of individual desire and locating it instead  in the ongoing evolution of life itself that is heedless to the preferences  of any individual creature. It is just this perspective that Houellebecq  attains in many of the most striking and troubling passages of his  writing when his accounts of the broad cultural shifts affecting our  species cast individual concerns into insignificance. Yet Schopenhauer,  like Houellebecq, reinscribes a certain humanist individualism into his  philosophy through his overriding focus on suffering. This can be seen,  for instance, in the title of his essay ‘On the Suffering of the World’: after  all, from the perspective of the Will, the world does not suffer and it is  meaningless to suggest as much; only individuals suffer, and the more  they overestimate the significance of their own will, the more they will  suffer. A similar confusion is perhaps to be found in Houellebecq’s account  of evolution in the natural world. In Houellebecq’s work, the animal  Morrey, Michel Houellebecq.indd   149 05/02/2013   10:27:23 </page> <page sequence="37"> 150 Michel Houellebecq kingdom is repeatedly presented as the theatre of a brutal ‘struggle for  life’, and human behaviour continues to partake of this viciousness,  especially in the ruthless sexual selection that favours some and sidelines  others. The depiction of the humans regressed to a state of savagery in  the epilogue of La Possibilité d’une île is perhaps the clearest indication  given in all of Houellebecq’s work of the real proximity we retain to  our primate cousins. But, aside from the numerous examples in natural  history of adaptive traits that are not characterised by strength, force  and ferocity, the very notion of a ‘struggle for life’ is an anthropocentric  fiction imposed on the evolutionary process. It is not the case that  species are seeking, above all, to reproduce themselves: species are not  seeking anything at all, although individuals may seek to copulate and  may encounter struggles in doing so. Successful species reproduction is  merely the consequence of the interaction between randomly occurring  characteristics and their environment. The distinction between a humanist (or anthropocentric) and posthu- manist (non-anthropocentric) way of conceiving these questions may  be further clarified if we look again at the two Utopias found in La  Possibilité d’une île. As we saw above, the first Utopia, that of the  Elohimite cult, turns out to be essentially an excuse for one man to wield  power and surround himself with the amorous attentions of a series of  young women. For the adepts of the cult, on the other hand, the principal  attraction is the scientifically supported promise of physical immortality,  which, as Houellebecq makes clear, trades cynically on contemporary  culture’s obsession with youth and terror of ageing. In short, then, by  growing out of selfish and all-too-human desires, the Elohimite cult  turns out to be unworthy of the name Utopia since it ultimately changes  little. If things are really to change, then the future has to be thought  outside this anthropocentric perspective. This is what is achieved by  the neo-humans who do away with everything we might recognise as  humanist traits: individualism, purpose, self-direction. As a result, their  Utopia appears cold and dull to us and, in the end, it too can perhaps  no longer even be considered a Utopia, since the very concept of Utopia  is a humanist one, an obvious descendant of the Enlightenment belief  in human perfectibility. If La Possibilité d’une île has received more  invective from critics than any other of Houellebecq’s novels it is surely  because this vision of the future is one of his bravest imaginative acts and  the most unsparing of the reader’s need for a humanist narrative crutch.  Arguably, Houellebecq himself is unable to relinquish such supports  completely, since the departure of Daniel25 in the epilogue testifies to a  Morrey, Michel Houellebecq.indd   150 05/02/2013   10:27:23 </page> <page sequence="38"> Science and Religion 151 restlessness within this apparently desireless species and to the inerad- icable pull of certain humanist ideals (poetry, love, community, Utopia).  Nonetheless, the lack of closure at the end of the novel – the absence of  the rumoured community in Lanzarote – demonstrates Houellebecq’s  refusal to succumb to narrative comforts. Finally, though, Houellebecq’s repeated, if tentative, turns to religious  thought necessarily betray the difficulty of leaving behind a humanist  conception of the world. Because, as Jean-Marie Schaeffer reminds  us, the fundamental tenets of the ‘human exception’ thesis – the  belief that humans somehow obey different rules or have a separate  destiny to other animals – are partly, if not principally, derived from  Christian thinking.140 That said, what Houellebecq seems to value most  in religious traditions is not any promise of the special or privileged  nature of humanity, nor is it religious faith and practice as a mode of  self-realisation. Instead, Houellebecq seems drawn to religion (and in  particular Buddhism, therefore a religion that developed outside the  western humanist tradition) as a practice that values self-abnegation.  Ironically, given the historical role played by religion in shoring up  ideologies of humanism, Houellebecq suggests that religious thinking  may be most useful today in providing a way to think outside the focus  on individual desire that has become ingrained in us through decades of  relatively peaceful and carefree consumerism. In other words, religious  thinking can be an important step in the direction of a posthumanist  perspective. One of the most powerful insights of La Possibilité d’une  île is the implication that the kind of social changes required in order to  avert the demographic and climatological emergencies that could prove  destructive to our species over the coming century cannot be brought  about through liberal democracy since it is liberal democracy that has  shaped the behaviours responsible for these threatening calamities.  A world view that values, monetises and encourages selfish desire is  necessarily inadequate to the task of radical social change with a view to  a more sustainable future. If we are to avoid the kind of collective suicide  that Houellebecq repeatedly envisions in his fiction, it may well require  a solution with the organisational structure and the force of conviction  of a religion.
