<plain_text><page sequence="1">2 Socrates, Plato, and Piety C. Emlyn-Jones In examining the moral and religious values of a pre-Christian Mediterranean society like Classical Athens, significant insights may be gained from the study of a particular type of cultural crisis-a situation in which a personal, intellectually conceived worldview clashes head-on with the less conceptually coherent but nonetheless deeply held traditions of the state. Such a crisis was the trial and condemnation of the philosopher Socrates in 399 B.C. on a charge on impiety. The word "piety," with its Latin root and Romano-Christian associations, is the rather inappropriate, though conventional translation of the Ancient Greek eusebeia, meaning a suitably reverent attitude towards groups or institutions demanding respect, and, in particular, religious institutions. A satisfactory relationship between mortals and the gods was considered to be essential for the prosperity not only of individuals but also of the community as a whole. So, in the Classical Greek city-state, piety had a strongly legal aspect, with penalties for those found guilty ofasebeia (impiety), which involved offending the gods in some way, for example, by desecrating temples and other holy places, violating rules for cults and festivals, or making fun of religious practices.1 In fifth-century Athens the law against impiety appears to have been very general in its provision, leaving individual prosecutors free to add the details, and juries to interpret the law, as they saw fit.2 In the case of Socrates, the public suit (graph) or asebeia was filled out by one of his prosecutors, Meletos, as follows: "Socrates is guilty of not acknowledging the gods which the city acknowledges, but other new divinities; and he is guilty of corrupting the youth. The penalty demanded is death."3 Over the years there has been a great deal of speculation about the motives of the prosecutors and, perhaps more to the point, what exactly Socrates did or was alleged to have done, to justify such a charge, or, at ^.J.

Stone, a book which has attracted a good deal of attention outside the scholarly world,5 and Socrates on Trial, by the familiar Socratic partnership of Thomas Brickhouse and Nicholas Smith.6 Stone's thesis is basically that the prosecution of Socrates contains a "hidden agenda": a strongly anti-democratic basis to Socrates' teaching led to a trial conducted in the aftermath of the collapse of Athens at the end of the Peloponnesian Wars (404 B.C.), and an oligarchic reign of terror ended by the restoration of the democracy. And the jury, Stone urges, were more or less compelled to condemn a man whose main aim was to antagonize them and who had no real interest in acquittal. Brickhouse and Smith, on the other hand, see the political basis of the charge as largely a creation of the early fourth-century Socratic literature, and, in particular, the lost accusatory epideixis (display oration) by the sophist Polykrates, which Xenophon, and possibly Plato too, are to be seen as answering on Socrates' behalf. Plato's Apology (his version of Socrates' trial speech), more likely, in their opinion, to be factual than not, presents a Socrates totally without irony and utterly sincere in his desire to convince the jury of his innocence and win his freedom. There is no reconciling these two positions, nor even, in the space available, choosing between them. Instead, I would like here to draw attention to the one thing both interpretations have in common: both clearly regard the actual charge (see above) as, in some sense, a side issue: Stone, because it was a front for the political charge which an amnesty declared by the restored democracy had rendered impossible; Brickhouse and Smith, because the terms in which Socrates was accused were irrelevant to his real activities and purpose. In this paper, without in any way ruling the political angle out of court, I would like to examine Brickhouse and Smith's contention and, in so doing, draw attention back to the religious aspect of the charge itself, and, in particular, consider what Socrates' attitude may have been towards state piety, a subject on which he seems, in his trial, to have been somewhat reticent. There are, of course, serious source problems. The indictment itself is given with minor variation by Xenophon and Plato, and Diogenes Laertius, a writer of the Roman Empire (third century A.D.), quotes his source as claiming that the charge was still preserved in the Metroon (a temple which served as a public record office) in the Athenian Agora in his own day.7 Socrates himself appears to have written nothing, and the only source 4See M.

Aristophanes' portrait of Socrates is usually dismissed as a comic travesty, though there is a tradition which goes back to Plato that in his youth Socrates did take some interest in scientific speculation.8 Aristophanes' portrait may reflect an erroneous but plausible association in the popular mind between Socrates and the sophists: odd references in later plays of Aristophanes and others, stretching through to The Frogs in 405 B.C. show that Socrates' alleged peculiar appearance, threadbare clothing and odd teaching kept him in the public eye as a popular target for comic humor-the eccentric, and possibly bogus, professor. The second major source for Socrates, the soldier and writer Xenophon, was in Asia Minor on a military campaign at the time of the trial and wrote perhaps twenty years after Socrates' death. His account of Socrates' trial speech is therefore second-hand; it is also difficult to be sure of the sources of his Memorabilia (Memoirs of Socrates) accounts of actual conversations with Socrates, information and ideas borrowed from Plato and others, or maybe largely fictitious conversations which he felt conveyed the essence of his revered teacher. At all events, as Gregory Vlastos points out, in trying to demonstrate Socrates' innocence of the charge, Xenophon succeeds rather too well.10 His conventionally upright Socrates is an implausi- ble target for an impiety prosecution; what success would the prosecutor Meletos have had against a man who defined piety as following the nomos (law or custom) of the state?10 Could any Athenian have defined it less controversially? It is in Plato's account of Socrates' trial speech (Apology) that we find the most significant evidence for Socrates' piety. The historicity of this speech rests, at first sight, on no stronger basis than that of Xenophon (although Plato does tell us that, unlike Xenophon, he was present at the trial).11 But Plato's Socrates is a much more unconventional character. In the first few minutes of the Apology, in a transformation or parody of the oratorical conventions (whichever word you use depends on your view of the speech), Socrates disclaims any skill at oratory, since, he tells us, he has not previously in his life been before a court, and he asserts that his "skill" will be to tell the truth.12 But his actual defense against the charge 8Plato, Phaedo, 96 a 6 ff. 9aThc Paradox of Socrates,** in G.

Plato's Socrates, in claiming, like all good orators, that he is going to tell the truth, actually operates a clever argumentative strategy. He asserts the charge as it stands is based on popular prejudice arising from Aristophanes' The Clouds and he emphasizes his association, in the popular mind, with a meteor (things in the heavens) and with natural philosophers such as Anaxagoras.13 It seems to me that, in taking this line, Plato's Socrates is deliberately "setting up" an improbable version of the charge, which allows easy refutation. In cross-questioning his prosecutor Meletos in "Socratic" manner, Socrates has no difficulty in trapping Meletos into accusing him of atheism which, of course, contradicts the charge. "Socrates is guilty of not believing in the gods, but believing in the gods" (great laughter all round, one supposes).14 Meletos is as easily tied up in knots as any other of the fellow conversationalists of Plato's Socrates. But, of course, trapping your opponent into a contradiction does not necessarily prove that what he asserts is false. Nevertheless, having disposed of his version of the charge, Socrates turns to what he claims as the real reason for the trial. He explains to the jury that his friend Chaerophon once asked the Delphic oracle if there was anybody wiser than Socrates, and the answer came back that there was no one, a conclusion Socrates explains that he felt bound to reject, or at least try to refute. Hence his activity of going round Athens questioning so-called experts, from which he concluded that the god was right and that he was the wisest man in that he knew he knew nothing whereas others, while wholly ignorant, had illusions of knowledge. "Perhaps," says Socrates, "the oracle is not referring literally to me, but merely taking my name as an example: the wisest man is he who, like Socrates, has realized that only the god has real wisdom, and that, in comparison, so-called human wisdom is worthless."15 So, in place of the false picture of Socrates as a natural philosopher or sophist, we now have a true version according to Socrates-the modest and ignorant follower of the god. This explanation carefully builds up a picture of pious devotion to the god's will; Socrates interprets the Delphic oracle as, by implication, commanding him to undertake a mission to continue throughout his life to devote himself exclusively to questioning Athenians about their fundamental beliefs and values. Yet, under the umbrella of "duty to the god," Socrates makes some remarkable claims. By interpreting his activity as a mission with divine approval, he effectively hijacks the conventional framework of state piety to sanction a personal and exclusive relationship with the gods. His is the only real piety, he claims, and to try to stop him is itself impious. So, his apparently modest claims with regard to knowledge are cleverly combined in the Apology with a quite far-reaching, 13Ibid., 26 d 6-e2. 14Ibid., 27 a5-6. 15Ibid., 23 a 5-b4.</page><page sequence="5">EMLYN-JONES: SOCRATES, PLATO, &amp; PIETY 25 albeit implied, redefinition of piety. Moreover, the jury are having the cards forced on them: to convict, Socrates implies, they will either have to believe the Aristophanic picture or themselves commit impiety by interfer- ing with a divine command. The offering of these as necessary alternatives nevertheless has the effect of excluding a great deal of middle ground. Like a good (i.e. skilled) orator, Socrates chooses the parameters of the debate and forecloses on a number of other options. We will now consider some of these. Plato's Socrates discusses the nature of piety in a dialogue called Euthyphro, which reads like one of the investigations Socrates undertook at the command of the god, although, of course, we necessarily remain uncertain of the exact relationship of Euthyphro to any conversation the real Socrates may have conducted. All we can say for certain is that style and content place it early in Plato's oeuvre. The dramatic context is a meeting between Socrates and a self-styled religious expert, Euthyphro, on the steps of the Stoa Basileos in the Agora. Socrates is about to enter for a preliminary hearing of his case before the Archon Basileus (the "King Archon"-the state official who presided over religious affairs). Euthyphro also has business with the Archon Basileus as he is (rather controversially) prosecuting his own father for murder (murder in Ancient Greece was an offense against religion). Despite the problems in his case, Euthyphro has total confidence in the Tightness of his action, which leads Socrates, with customary irony, to question him as the expert who will be able to teach him what piety is. Euthyphro soon gets into deep water. His initial definition of piety as "what the gods love" is shown by Socrates to be inherently contradictory because the gods can all be shown to love different things; this is especially the case with things which cannot be weighed or measured, like moral values. And even if one adjusts the definition to get round this logical problem, so as to read "what all the gods love is pious," Socrates produces a complex argument to demonstrate that the fact that the gods love something does not constitute the essence of piety, which, by implication, must lie elsewhere; "the gods love something because it is pious; it is not pious because the gods love it." Socrates next exposes weaknesses in the conventional god/mortal relationship: in reply to Euthyphro's suggestion that piety is a therapeia (service) rendered by mortals to gods, he shows that it cannot be a professional service (i.e. doctor to patient) which implies the greater knowledge of the provider (mortal cannot know more than gods!), nor that of slave to master; in the emporike techne ("art of commerce"; the phrase itself is humorously disrespectful) between gods and men, the bargain is one-sided because what could gods obtain from mortals that they need or desire? "Well, our honor and esteem," says Euthyphro. So piety is "what is dear to the gods." The argument has come a full circle. Euthyphro hastily</page><page sequence="6">26 GREECE &amp; THE MEDITERRANEAN retires, with Socrates' reproaches as the "abandoned pupil" ringing in his ears.16 Euthyphro has a dual focus-on the one hand it is a typical early Socratic dialogue in which Socrates claims ignorance in order to try to reach a definition of a particular moral value, and again, fairly typically, the conversa- tion ends in aporia, failure. On the other hand, Euthyphro's content, as well as the dramatic context, binds it closely to the trial either as a historical demonstration of a Socrates who cares about piety or as a retrospective vindication of him by Plato. There has been a tendency to reject the essentially negative aspects of this dialogue as either the spreading of confusion as a contrived educational technique (what Henry Teloh calls "kicking sand in the student's face")17 or as actually implying, though not stating, positive conclusions about piety and the gods.18 But what the dialogue actually says, as opposed to what we might wish to read into it, comprises a sustained attack, from a number of different directions, on the validity of the gods as a central focus of piety. Despite his apparent status as an eccentric or religious fanatic, Euthyphro's attempted définition of piety as "what the gods love" corresponds closely with conventional wisdom,19 and it is the intellectual inadequacy of this wisdom that Socrates ruthlessly exposes. The idea of the gods as the object of piety is seen as lacking coherence, since the relationship eludes definition. But is it realistic to suppose that the Athenians were likely to have taken great exception to all this? Greek religion lacked a strongly dogmatic basis; the profusion of myths and legends inherited from the past left much room for speculation and interpretation. As the social organization of religion at Athens in the fifth century clearly demonstrates, there was no professional priesthood and orthodoxy seems to have been much more concerned with correct observance than belief. Criticism and even ridicule of the gods in tragedy and comedy was tolerated-even if the latter was to some extent a privileged area of license.20 Skepticism about the existence and nature of the gods can be found in the sophists, for example Protagoras, and their anthropomorphic basis had been forcefully questioned as long ago as Xenophanes, in the late sixth or early fifth century.21 The evidence for the prosecution of intellectuals such as Protagoras and Anaxagoras on 16Euthyphro and The Apology are translated in The Last Days of Socrates, by H. Tredennick (Harmondsworth: Penguin Classics, 1989; repr. of 1969 ed). 17 Socratic Education in Plato's Dialogues (Notre Dame, 1986), p. 56. 18See especially, M.

Xenophon certainly assumes that the daimonion is the source of the prosecution and Plato's Euthyphro seems to believe the same, though Socrates significantly ignores this suggestion;25 it also seems to me rather forced to relate the daimonion to the idea of "new divinities" (the charge has plural "daimonia"). To return for a moment to Euthyphro. On the face of it, a polite urbane skepticism in an intellectual conversation between friends is not enough on which to hang a prosecution. But we have seen that the content of the dialogue, if we ignore Socrates' ironic manner, consists of a systematic questioning of the traditional basis of the relationship between gods and mortals, and of the logic behind the practices which sustain it. Other early Platonic dialogues have Socrates, in similar manner, questioning other key values and attitudes of Athens' citizens. Whatever Plato's contribution to the style of these conversations, evidence from Aristotle (in his early years a member of Plato's Academy) suggests that the ethical basis and especially the search for definitions, should be seen as a contribution of Socrates rather than Plato.26 In the Apology, as I mentioned earlier, Socrates claims this search as his sacred duty, a mission entrusted to him by the god at Delphi. If the early dialogues of Plato reflect in any way the activity of the historical Socrates, we have in them a systematic contemporary critique of Athens and its institutions carried out in the name of piety, "duty to the god." It may be that this systematic taking apart of the structure of conventional religion in the name of religion over many years rendered Socrates' conversa- tions no longer harmless and led the Athenians, perhaps uniquely, to prosecute a fellow citizen for what he said rather than what he did. 22See especially, K.J.

Modern scholars, and especially philosophers, understandably welcome the intellectual rigor and coherence of the religious views and even the religious skepticism of Plato's Socrates as something they can recognize and discuss as a contribution to their own discipline. There is therefore a tendency to accept Plato's Socrates at face value when he maintains, in the Apology, that it was not genuine understanding of what he was saying, but irritated incomprehension which led to the impiety prosecution; he claims that the Aristophanes picture was dredged up from twenty years previously as all the Athenians could find against him: They complain that there is a pestilential busybody called Socrates who fills young people's heads with wrong ideas. If you ask them what he does, and what he teaches that has this effect, they have no answer, not knowing what to say; but as they do not want to admit their confusion, they fall back on the stock charges against any philosopher: that he teaches his pupils about things in the heavens and below the earth, and to disbelieve in gods, and to make the weaker argument defeat the stronger. They would be very loath, I fancy, to admit the truth: which is that they are being convicted of pretending to knowledge when they are entirely ignorant. So, jealous, I suppose, for their own reputation, and also energetic and numerically strong, and provided with a plausible and carefully worked out case against me, these people have been dinning into your ears for a long time past their violent denunciations of myself. 7 From one point of view Socrates' estimate of his fellow citizens may be fair. As modern scholars we tend to be on the side of the intellectual; but, in this case our preference may put us in danger of radically underesti- mating the Athenian populace. From the perspective, not of the philosophy of religion but of the popular culture and society of the late fifth century B.C., Socrates' relentless questioning of conventional piety, coupled with his apparently exclusive claim to wisdom, may have been understood only too well. An Athenian jury may not have needed the hidden political agenda in order to see Socrates' claim as an attack on the fundamental values of the polis, sanctioned and preserved, as they were considered to be, by the immortal gods. 21 Apology, 23 dl-еЗ, tr.
