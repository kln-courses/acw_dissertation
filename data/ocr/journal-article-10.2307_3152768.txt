<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE ORIGINAL CHARACTER OF THE HEBREW SABBATH.* By MORRIS JASTROW, JR., University of Pennsylvania. I. THE researches of the lamented Robertson Smith, of Kuenen, Wellhausen, Frazer, Stade, and others, have prepared us for dis- tinguishing in the case of the religious institutions of the Hebrews -as of other peoples-between older elements and such as have been added at subsequent periods. Amid the diversity of opinions still existing with regard to details, there is a general agreement among scholars that most, if not all, of the institu- tions embodied in the pentateuchal legislation are to be traced back to a very early age, an age not only much older than the oldest parts of the Pentateuch, but even antedating consider- ably the date assigned to them by the traditions of the Hebrews themselves. The complicated literary process that resulted in giving to the Pentateuch its definite: shape is paralleled by an equally complicated intellectual process that changed the char- acter of the religious institutions of the Hebrews, many of which the latter at one time shared with their fellow-Semites, and in part with others than Semites. Investigated from this point of view, the fundamental idea of the Passover festival, for example, turns out to be an old threshold rite,' the antiquity of which is beyond all calculation, and which had already been considerably modified before it was adapted to serve as a reminiscence of a significant national tradition, and combined with an old spring festival once celebrated in connection with the breaking up of the winter encampment-an annual Volkerwanderung like the ver *Read before the Eleventh International Congress of Orientalists in Paris on September 8, I897.

Similarly, the other festivals of the Hebrews contain elements that belong to a gray antiquity, and even the Day of Atonement, though the last of the sacred days of the Jewish calendar to receive its final shape, could not have been an innovation introduced during the exilic period.3 The festival month of Tishri stands in some connection with the Dsu-l- J-idjdja-the month of pilgrimage-of the Arabs, and there must be an intimate bond uniting the tenth day of Tishri (which is the Day of Atonement) with the tenth day of the Arabic pilgrimage month, which is the most sacred day of this sacred ,month.4 The five other feast days of the Jewish church-the ninth of Ab, the seventeenth of Tammuz, the third of Tishri, the tenth of Tebeth, the thirteenth of Adar-as Houtsma has recently shown,5 are survivals of ancient Semitic institutions. Again, in the regulations prescribed for the sacrifices in the Pentateuch, and in the ordinances for the priests, many older features have been retained and combined with later practices. We are justified, therefore, in looking for a Sabbath among the Hebrews prior to the period when the present pentateuchal regulations for the Sabbath were drafted, and we may also be prepared to find such an earlier Sabbath to have a different character from that which characterizes the post-exilic institu- tion. Nay, more. In an investigation of the original character of the Sabbath of the Hebrews, the contingency of the existence of an institution from which the biblical Sabbath may be derived, but in which the leading idea, or ideas, of this biblical 'See IHERING'S brilliant and suggestive chapters in his Vorgeschichte der Indo- Europaer, pp. 309-58. 3 The strange rite recorded in Leviticus, chap. I6, of the sending forth of a goat into the wilderness - clearly a trace of demon worship - is a sufficient proof for the antiquity of the festival. The dancing on the Day of Atonement, as described in the Talmud (Treatise Taanith, 26b), appears likewise to be a survival of some primitive rites and is entirely out of keeping with an exilic institution; and there are other proofs. 4 See HOUTSMA, Over de Israelitische Vastendagen (Amsterdam, 1897), pp. 22-3.

That the Sabbath is an old institution is generally admitted.6 The Hebrews themselves preserved the recollection of its having been observed in Egypt. Gunkel7 designates it as urall, "very old," and there are some very obvious indications of significant changes which the institution, in the course of its development, underwent. Its connection with the new moon is obvious,8 and, this being so, it could not have been originally celebrated every seventh day,9 but, at the most, every 7th, I4th, 2Ist day after the new moon, and on the day when the new moon made its appearance. Again, old as the cosmological traditions embodied in the first two chapters of Genesis are, the division of the work of creation is a comparatively late innovation,'o intro- duced, according to some scholars, even after the compilation of the Priestly Code." The pre-exilic Sabbath, therefore, could not have been originally celebrated as a reminiscence of the completion of the work of creation on the seventh day. But such considerations do not take us beyond conclusions of a negative character. We can determine in this way, and only to a certain extent, what the Sabbath was not. To determine further what it was, a different method must be followed. Knowing that the Hebrews at all times lived in the midst of nations, some cognate to them, others not, and that at no time were they free from outside influences, we are justified in seek- ing among the nations with whom they came into contact for beliefs and institutions similar to their own. 6So already Jahn, at the beginning of this century, and, no doubt, others before him. 7Schbpfung und Chaos, p. 14. 8WELLHAUSEN, Prolegomena zur Geschichte Israels (second edition), pp. I I6-i8. 9 JENNINGS (Jewish Antiquities [ 8o8], pp. 320-21) adduces some interesting argu- ments to show that the "paradisaical Sabbath," as he calls the earlier institution, was observed on a different day from the later "Jewish Sabbath." He thinks that the Hebrews lost the ancient Sabbath during the sojourn in Egypt. While, of course, much that Jennings says has lost its force, his acuteness is none the less remarkable in recognizing a great difference between an earlier and a later Sabbath.

Of the various attempts that have been made to seek for parallels to the Hebrew Sabbath among other nations,12 and to account in this way for the biblical institutions, the only one that need in the present state of Old Testament researches be seriously considered is the supposed origin of the Sabbath from Babylonia. It is Wilhelm Lotz who has given to this thesis a scientific setting,'3 and who has demonstrated the futility of theories which sought to connect the Hebrew Sabbath with the dies Saturni of the Romans.'4 The point of departure for con- necting the Hebrew Sabbath with a Babylonian institution has always been a significant passage in a cuneiform lexicographical tablet5' which furnished the equation tLm nfb libbi--= a-bat-tum, i. e., day of rest of the heart = Sabbath. The literal interpre- tation of the phrase, "day of rest of (or for) the heart," " See the summary in DILLMANN'S Commentary to Genesis (fifth edition), pp. 4-10. 13 Questiones de historia Sabbati (Leipzig, 1883). 14 So, e. g., H. COHEN: " Der Sabbath in seiner culturgeschichtlichen Bedeutung" (Zeitgeist, Milwaukee, Wis., I88I, pp. 4 seq.), following DozY, Die Israeliten zu Mekka, pp. 34-5; KUENEN, Religion of Israel, I, pp. 262 seq., etc. Others, like Spencer, are inlined to connect the Sabbath with Egyptian rites. (See NOWACK, Lehrbuch der hebraischen Archaologie, II, p. 141.) '5 II Rawlinson (= R.), plate 32, 1. I6 a-b. In a syllabary published by Bezold (Proceedings Soc. Bibl. Arch., Vol. XI, December, i888, marked 83, I-i8, 1330), col. i, 25, and col. iv, 8, aword la-bat-tim occurs. In the first passage the word occurs in a group of terms, many of which bear on religious rites, as suppft, "prayer," sullt, " petition," and since, moreover, it is immediately preceded by nublu, "propitiate," there is a strong presumption in favor of regarding it as a variant form of ? aba ttum, though the second sign is different from the corresponding one in the word that appears in II R., 32, I6. In the second passage (col. iv, 8), however, the word cannot have any direct connection with our ab a t t um. JENSEN'S attempt to establish this connection (Zeitschr. fr Assyr., IV, pp. 275-6) is not convincing. The ideograph of which it is an equivalent differs from the ideograph employed in the other passage (col. i), and the word occurs in a group (mostly Piel infinitives) that have the general force of "destroy, remove, oppress," and the like (dibtA, duppuru, nisft, sanaku, etc.). Jensen is obliged to recognize that these verbs have nothing to do with abatturm. His solution of the difficulty is not at all satisfactory. It is possible that in the sec- ond passage we have a form of the stem labatu (with Teth) which has the meaning "strike," or perhaps we ought to read ?a-mit (for mit) -tum, from Aamatu, to "throw down " or "cut off," like the Hebrew tX.t.</page><page sequence="5">THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY naturally suggested a comparison with the biblical Sabbath, the most prominent feature of which was "rest" from the labors of the week. The further juxtaposition of this Baby- lonian "day of rest" with Sabattum seemed to settle the question definitely, in view of the apparent identity of this term with the Hebrew Shabbath or Sabbath.'6 Not long, how- ever, after the appearance of Lotz' work it was ascertained by Assyriologists that the phrase u m n fb lib b i did not at all convey the notion of cessation of labors, but that n f b 1 i b b i was a standing expression- almost a technical term-the pacification of a deity's anger.'7 The phrase is of very frequent occurrence in the religious literature of Babylonia, more par- ticularly in hymns addressed by penitents who, in appealing for forgiveness to some deity or deities that have manifested their ill-will, pray: :8 i bbaki91li nfubt k a b i t t a k i i p a , i. e., " may thy heart be at rest, thy liver be pacified." The parallelism (heart liver) leaves no doubt as to the proper interpretation,20 and such is the frequency of the phrase that n b l i b b i ka,21 "rest of thy heart," becomes the formula for "divine propitiation," and the pacification psalm itself is known as a sigu2 nftb libbi. An fm nft libbi, accordingly, was S6 The form Sabbath (with s ) is dependent upon the transliteration of the Hebrew word in the Greek translation of the Old Testament. 7 It is to be regretted that IHERING (Vorgeschichte der Indo-Europaer, p. 145) should not have been aware of this now universally accepted sense of the phrase. His view of the biblical Sabbath is necessarily distorted in consequence of his adher- ence to the older and false view. SAYCE'S view of the Hebrew Sabbath (Hibbert Lec- tures, p. 76) also rests upon a false interpretation of the phrase. 8 DELITZSCH, Assyrische Lesestucke, p. 136, Io, a prayer to Ishtar; ZIMMERN, Babylonische Busspsalmen, pp. 35, 53, 62, 75, 79, 80; IV Rawlinson, I9, No. 3,1. 62. For other examples, see DELITZSCH, Assyrisches Worterbuch, p. 453a. An interesting passage in which the phrase occurs is at the close of the legend of Ishtar's descent to the nether world, IV R., 31, Reverse, 1. I6: "After her heart (i. e., Allatu's) [is at rest, her liver brightened." 19 Addressed to a goddess. 20 Instead of libbika linftb we also find libbu combined with li?ap?ib (e. g., ZIMMERN, ibid., p. 89). E. g., IV Rawlinson, i8, No. 2, Obverse, 11. 9-Io. 22 Aigu is one of the names for penitential song. See ZIMMERN, Babylonische Busspsalmen, p. I. Whether there is any connection between igu and the Hebrew technical term giggayon is doubtful, though not improbable. 316</page><page sequence="6">ORIGINAL CHARACTER OF THE HEBREW SABBATH 317 a day of propitiation, of pacification, of atonement, of reconcili- ation with a deity.23 The idea of rest involved in the phrase has reference to the gods and not to men. From this point of view hardly any greater contrast can be imagined than between the biblical Sabbath as a day of rest for man and the Babylonian i m nufb libbi or sabattum asa dayof rest for the gods- that is, when the gods rested from their anger, when their minds24 were once more at ease, when their anger24 was assuaged. And yet, the very fact that the two days present such a perfect contrast raises the suspicion of some ultimate, albeit remote, connection. A harmonious difference is often the result of a striking agree- ment; and in view of the hostile spirit developed a century or two before the Babylonian exile, on the part of the Hebrew leaders towards anything Babylonian-a hostility which grew to still larger proportions during the exile, and is best exem- plified in the writings of the three greatest prophets, Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel-we should be led to expect that any institutions which the Hebrews shared with their Euphratean cousins would be so modified as to be freed from distasteful associations, and eventually to present a contrast to Babylonish customs. Moreover, by abandoning all connection between the Shabbath of the Hebrews and the Babylonian tim nfib libbi, a new and formidable difficulty confronts us in account- ing for the existence of the Babylonian term sabattum. To be sure, some scholars have proposed to get rid of this problem by pleading for a reading s a - pa t- tum,25 but the occurrence of a verb sa-ba-tu in a lexicographical tablet and entered as a synonym of g a m A r u, " bring to an end,"26 throws the bal- ance in favor of the reading bat,27 inasmuch as the corresponding 23 See JENSEN'S article on a battu in Zeitschriftfiir Assyriologie, IV, pp. 274-5. 24The "heart "is the seat of the intellect for the Semites; the "liver" (or the bowels) the seat of the emotions. '5 So DELITZSCH, who enters the word in his Assyrisches Handw., p. 684a, under gapatu (see also ibid., p. 453b), but offers no further explanation, nor does he assign the reason which prompted him to abandon his former reading bat. 26 So JENSEN (Zeitschr. f. Assyr., IV, p. 275). The passage occurs in V R., 28, 1. 14 e-f. 27 That the second sign is bat (or pat) is placed beyond all doubt by a reexamina-</page><page sequence="7">THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY Hebrew verb from which Shabbath is obviously derived also signifies " to cease," " to bring to an end." Many scholars have recently pronounced themselves in favor of retaining the reading sabattum.28 Adopting this reading, it is clear that some connection between the word and the Hebrew term B.iJ cannot be lightly dismissed as a mere coincidence. Gunkel (loc. cit.), in strongly advocating a direct connection, remarks that the fact that the Sabbath of the Hebrews is a day of rest, while among the Babylonians it was "a day of atone- ment," does not militate against an original identity. But to justify this remark it is necessary to find a bridge leading from the one institution to the other. Gunkel fails to do so, nor has anyone else, to my knowledge, made the attempt. Since, as admitted, there is no trace of a real day of rest for man among the Babylonians, it is quite natural that Jensen, while he accepts the reading sabattum and also admits a connection with the corresponding Hebrew term, should express himself cautiously as to the Babylonian origin of the Hebrew Sabbath.29 There remains, however, an alternative which, so far as I am aware, has not yet been considered. Can the Hebrew Sabbath have originally been an tm nlub libbi, a day of propitiation or atonement, a day of rest FOR Yahwe instead of a day of rest enjoined BY Yahwe ? I venture to raise this question. III. We are, fortunately, in a position to state pretty definitely what ideas the Babylonians attached to a day of propitiation and atonement. Among a people who attributed a significance to almost every act, to every incident and accident of existence, as the Babylonians did,30 it is natural to find every day of the tion of the original tablet kindly made at my request by Mr. L. W. King, of the British Museum. 28 It is sufficient to name SCHRADER, Cuneiform Inscriptions and the Old Testa- ment, I, p. 20; JENSEN, Die Kosmologie der Babylonier, p. io8; and GUNKEL, Schbp- fung und Chaos, p. I55. We may also add to this number Zimmern, who gives a tacit consent to Gunkel's note on the subject. 29 Sunday School Times, January 6, 1892. 30 See the writer's forthcoming Religion of Babylonia and Assyria, pp. 354-5. 3 8</page><page sequence="8">ORIGINAL CHARACTER OF THE HEBREW SABBATH 319 year endowed with some ominous character, good or bad. In religious calendars prepared by Babylonian scribes, we find the successive days of a month entered as "favorable day," or "day not favorable," or "evil day." " Favorable days" were such on which the gods were in good humor, when they might be approached with the assurance that they would listen to the petitions of their worshipers. The rulers exercised great care to select a " favorable day" for laying the foundations of their palaces or sacred edifices, or for the dedication of a building. It was equally important for the individual to choose a favorable day for starting out on a journey or for inaugurating any impor- tant undertaking. Oracles were sought of the priests to deter- mine such matters. On "evil days," on the contrary, great precautions had to be exercised lest the ill-humor of the god or gods should lead to some direct manifestation of anger--as sickness, storm, a fall, drought, bad crops, and the like. The " evil day " was not necessarily the day when a misfortune took place, but a day that might lead to a misfortune. An fm nub libbi, or day of propitiation and atonement, occupies an inter- mediate position between a " favorable " and an " unfavorable " day. The hoped-for pacification implied that the deity was angry, or might become angry, and in so far it was an " evil day," but, on the other hand, it had also its " favorable" side, since the worshiper succeeded, or hoped to succeed, by some means or the other in dispelling the divine displeasure. In a religious calendar- well known to Assyriologists-for the inter- calated month of Elul we find the 7th, I4th, Igth, 2ISt, and 28th days entered as " favorable day, evil day,"31 while the others are simply " favorable " days. For each day certain measures are prescribed, and upon examining the regulations for the " favorable-unfavorable " days, it will be found that they con- sist mainly of precautions to be observed. The calendar in ques- tion might be called a "royal" one, for the king alone is 3' IV Rawlinson (second edition), plates 32-3. SCHRADER'S translation (Cuneiform Inscriptions and the Old Testament, I, p. 19) of tm mag ri (sic !) as "day of con- secration" misses the point entirely, while SAYCE (Hibbert Lectures, pp. 71-6) has mislead many by rendering m U U L (= limnu) as "Sabbath." The error was pardonable in the days of Fox Talbot and George Smith, but not in 1887.</page><page sequence="9">THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY involved in the rites and precautions. As the one standing nearer to the gods than the subjects, and upon whose favor with the gods the welfare of the people is conditioned,32 the king is cautioned against avoiding display on the five days of the month above mentioned. He is not to eat meat roasted on coals or anything that has touched the fire,33 here introduced as a sacred element. He is not to put on fineries, nor even to make offerings. He must not mount his chariot, nor sit in state, nor enter the sacred chamber where the gods dwell. A physician is not to be called in to the sick bed.34 The days in question are not favorable for invoking curses upon the enemies, but when the evening comes, sacrifices may be brought to the gods to whom the days are sacred. Then we are told " the king brings his gifts, offers his sacrifices, and his prayer will be accepted with favor by the deity." These precautions become intelligible under the double aspect of the days in question. As " unfavorable " days, every- thing had to be avoided that, in order to succeed, required the aid of the gods; hence the order not to bring sacrifices, not to enter the holy of holies, not to ask for curses upon one's enemy, not to call in the physician- since the medicinal potions could not be effective without the favorable acceptance of the incan- tations. Equally essential was it to avoid arousing the jealousy of the gods on days when they were not favorably disposed. The king must endeavor to hide himself from the gods and, at all events, not to call their attention to his existence by appear- ing in public or in his official capacity. Riding in his chariot, sitting in state, robing himself, are forbidden under this aspect of the day. On the other hand, the day becomes a " favor- able " one by virtue of the observance of the precautions, and hence, at its close, the king offers his gifts and sacrifices with the assurance that they will be received by the gods. These 32 The order of ideas is the same as controls the position of the king in general in ancient cults. See FRAZER, The Golden Bough, Vol. I, pp. Iog seq. 33Akal tumri (col. i, 30, etc.) is explained (col. ii, 41) as mimma ?a i t ti ba lu, i. e., anything cooked with fire. 34 DAVIS (Genesis and Semitic Tradition, p. 26) has not grasped the meaning of this and the following line of the text. 320</page><page sequence="10">ORIGINAL CHARACTER OF THE HEBREW SABBA TH 321 " favorable-unfavorable" days are not limited to the month of Elul. We have a calendar for another month-Markhe- shwan-in which the same five days are similarly singled out and the same measures prescribed. There is every reason to believe, therefore, that all the months had their "favorable- unfavorable" days, though possibly not always the same.35 The phrase um n t libbi does not occur in these calendars, but this need not surprise us, since the phrase does not represent the name for any particular institution, but is merely a descriptive term.36 Any day on which the anger of the gods was set at rest would be an ftm n fub libbi, and correspondingly any day37 on which the attempt would be made to make the gods favorable who for some reason were angry or disposed to anger would give that day the character of a day of atonement and propitiation.38 Turning now to the Hebrew Sabbath, it is interesting to find distinct traces in the Old Testament of its having once been anything but a propitious occasion. The manna 35In the month of Shebat, e.g., the twenty-seventh day is also "unfavorable" (IV Rawlinson [second edition], pl. 33, note 7). 36 See below. 37 Not any " season," as DAVIS (Genesis and Semitic Tradition, p. 25) puts it. 38 The anger of the gods plays a very prominent part in the religious literature of the Babylonians. The general view held of the gods was that, while they were just and could be pacified by prayer and sacrifice, they were easily roused to anger. At critical periods - on the approach of the rainy season, at the time that the crops were expected to ripen, upon undertaking a journey, and more the like - any errors made in one's conduct toward the gods would be certain of being followed by disas- trous consequences. The choice of the 7th, I4th, 2ist, and 28th days of the month is connected with the general importance attached to the moon as a great heavenly body exercising an influence on the fate of mankind, and a special significance is attached to the beginning of the phases in the moon's appearance, as marking a spe- cially critical period. But other days besides those connected with the movements of the moon had an "unfavorable " character. So, as already noted, the nineteenth day in the months of the intercalated Elul and Markheshwan, and probably for other months of the year. In a calendar arranged for the entire year (V Rawlinson, pls. 48 and 49) every day is accorded some character. Quite a number of days are entered as "unfavorable," and in this calendar, too, we find precautions frequently prescribed, such as the prohibitions against eating certain food - swine's meat, beef, dates, fish - on certain days or against carrying on mercantile pursuits on some days. These measures are again of an expiatory character like those already noted. All such days would come under the general caption of " pacification " or " atonement" days.</page><page sequence="11">322 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY which falls copiously for six days of the week is withheld on the seventh day (Ex. 16:25). The measures prescribed for the day are almost exclusively of a restrictive character, the resem- blance of which to the Babylonian measures is, to say the least, striking. The people are not to leave their homes on that day (ibid., 29). Fires are not to be kindled in the dwellings (Ex. 35:3); not even the wood for the fire is to be gathered (Num. 15:32-36). No work of any kind is to be done by any member of the household in the fields. No baking or cooking is to be done in the house (Ex. 16: 23), and it is well known how the further elaboration of those instructibns led to nigh endless restrictions.39 The people were not to journey on the Sabbath, not to ride, nor even to walk beyond a certain dis- tance; no burdens were to be carried, fire was not to be touched, no meals were to be cooked, no business of any kind to be carried on. We may feel certain that most of these restrictions were in force long before the Talmudic period-many centu- ries, indeed, before the days of Jesus- while some belong to as old a period as any of the regulations found in the Old Testament. The resemblance of these measures-so exclu- sively negative-to the Babylonian orders for the five "unfa- vorable " days of the month has, of course, not failed to attract the attention of scholars, but, this resemblance being admitted, we are obviously justified in proposing, for the Hebrew regula- tions, the same interpretation that holds good for the Babylo- nian customs. So strange a command as the one to "remain indoors" becomes intelligible as a survival of a conception of the Sabbath as an " unfavorable " day-a day on which it was dan- gerous to show one's self before Yahwe. Again, that fire was not to be handled cannot have been a consequence of a concep- tion of the Sabbath as a day of rest from labors, but must have preceded such a conception. The fire is sacred to Yahwe. He manifests himself frequently in the flame;40 hence the fire must not be touched except when Yahwe is favorably disposed. ?3 The Talmud enumerates thirty-nine restrictions. 40Ex.3:2; 19:18; 24:17. Yahwe "answers" the petition through fire (I Kings I8:24). In the New Testament (Heb. 12:29) the Lord is still called "a</page><page sequence="12">ORIGINAL CHARACTER OF THE HEBREW SABBATH 323 A ceremony still observed by Jews at the exit of the Sabbath preserves a trace of the sacredness ascribed to fire. As night is ushered in, a light is kindled and a benediction4X pronounced over fire; and it is significant that the same ceremony is expressly prescribed42 for the Day of Atonement. The connection thus suggested between the Sabbath and the Day of Atonement, and which will be dwelt upon further, cannot be accidental.43 Hence the close of the great Atonement Day when Yahwe had been pacified was particularly appropriate for kindling a fire, and the striking of a light at the close of the Sabbath evening as the end of an "inauspicious " day was a symbol that the hoped- for pacification of the deity had been attained.44 I venture, further, to suggest that the idea of "propitiating" an enraged deity entered largely originally into the ordinance that became the central feature of Sabbath observance, namely, the command to abstain from labor.45 If the Sabbath was originally an "unfavorable" day on which one must avoid showing one's self before Yahwe, it would naturally be regarded as dangerous to provoke his anger by endeavoring to secure on that day personal benefits through the usual forms of activity. That the labor meant was primarily work in the fields follows consuming fire;" cf. Deut. 4: 24; Is. 30: 27, etc. The fire that consumes the sacrifice comes direct from Yahwe (Lev. 9: 24), and it is through fire that Yahwe destroys those who are guilty of sacrilege (Lev. Io: 2). 41 .Wn .~j. t , I, " Blessed is the creator of the light (of fire)." See Midrash Rabba to Genesis, ? I . 42 Midrash Rabba, ibid.; also at the close of the section. 43Among all nations of antiquity the kindling of fire is attended with solemn ceremony (GOBLET D'ALVIELLA, Histoire Religieuse du Feu, pp. 65-70). It is sufficient to recall here the survival of rites connected with the fire among the Romans. (See SMITH's Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities, s: v. Vestales.) Care was always taken that the fire was kindled at an auspicious moment. 44 The relationship (if any) of this ceremony to another Jewish " fire " rite - the so-called lighting of the lamps on Friday evening- is difficult to determine. The antiquity of this latter ceremony is evidenced by the circumstance that the women of the households are the ones who perform it. Among ancient nations, it will be recalled, the women are the carriers and preservers of the fire. (IHERING, Vorgeschichte der Indo-Europaer, p. 349.) The ceremony may be an outgrowth of the original pre- servation of the fire, modified in its adaptation to totally changed conditions. 45 Labor was of no use unless it was rewarded through the favor of the deity.</page><page sequence="13">THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY from the phraseology in the decalogue.46 Kindling of fire, attend- ing to the household needs, can only be brought under the head- ing of work by a legal pressure exerted upon the term, and the same is the case with such acts as riding or walking. But this very introduction of a strictly legal spirit in the interpretation of the Sabbath regulations which results in the wide scope that the restrictive measures are made to embrace must be based on a conception of the day broad enough to include both ordinary activity and such restrictions as lie outside of the province of Abhode.47 Besides the comparison of the biblical and post-biblical regulations for the Sabbath with Babylonian customs, there is other evidence going to show that the Sabbath had at one time a severe aspect, resembled, indeed, the great Day of Atonement, the " day of propitiation "par excellence, which was celebrated on the tenth day of the seventh month. From the fifty-eighth chapter of Isaiah it would seem that fasting at one time formed a feature of Sabbath observance-precisely as on the great Day of Atone- ment. In that chapter the prophet pleads for an ideal "fast day," and it has been customary to interpret his words as a ser- mon appropriate to the Day of Atonement. However, he makes no mention of this day, whereas, after denouncing the futility of supposing mere abstention from food to be pleasing in the sight of the deity, he introduces, and evidently with intent, the Sab- bath (vs. I3). The post-exilic prophet protests apparently against an observance of the Sabbath which he feels forms too close a parallel to Babylonish customs to be a legitimate means of honoring Yahwe, and calls upon the people to change the day into one which should have a "joyous" character.48 The 46Ex. 20: 9-IO; Deut. 5: I3-I4. See, also, Ex. 34:2I. Work in which the entire household and the ox and the ass are engaged is field labor. 47 The Hebrews, like the Babylonians, had their " favorable " and "unfavorable" days, as the phrase Y6m Tob (" good-day ") for holy day shows, and it is worth noting that the Sabbath is never called a Ybm Tob. The term is applied strictly only to the three festivals, Passover, Pentecost, and Booths, but the usage is extended to the New Year's Day and to the feast of Purim. 48 raY nT/5 n p'l, "And thou shalt call the Sabbath a delight."

And if the strict observance of the Sabbath regulations by the Jews in the Middle Ages had a more joyous character, it was because the austerity of the day was relieved by ample provisions for three substantial meals, which became not only a prominent feature, but an essential requisite of the institution.50 Fasting is forbidden on the Sabbath for the express reason that it inter- feres with the carrying out of Isaiah's order to make the Sab- bath an =S, a "delight." 5 If it be, furthermore, borne in mind that the Sabbath is the only occasion on which it is absolutely forbidden to fast, the probability is increased that this rather curious prohibition voices a protest against an observ- ance of the day as a fast once in vogue, but afterward regarded as an illegitimate rite. As a matter of fact, the order to "enjoy" three meals on the Sabbath constitutes about the only lighter touch introduced into the observance of the day and presents a contrast to the other ordinances, which are almost all of a nega- tive and restrictive character-dealing with things that one must not do on the Sabbath. When an exception occurs, it seems 49 The Sabbath in Puritan New England, pp. 245-58. S ABRAHAMS, Jewish Life in the Middle Ages, pp. 83, 373, and passim. Great stress is laid by the Jewish theologians upon these meals. It is significant that the term 5d03, "delight," as used by Isaiah, is applied by them to the meals; and the con- jecture, above advanced, that the old Sabbath was a fast day finds support (by implication) in the express prohibition against fasting laid down in the religious code - the so-called Shulchan Arukh - which served as the guide in the proper per- formance of the ceremonies of orthodox Judaism. 5'Loc. cit., p. 3. With rigorous logic the dyspeptic to whom three substantial meals constitute a torture, and not a " delight " - and whose greater " delight" consists in not eating -is excluded from the obligation. It is not sufficient to take the three meals; it is absolutely necessary that one must "enjoy" them, regard them as a "delight." (Hilkhoth Shabbath, ? 288.) The ascetic who is accustomed to fast every day till noon -as very pious people did-is also exempt, because the departure from fixed habit might cause him physical discomfort, and thus interfere with his "enjoyment" of the Sabbath. In view of the custom of fasting after a bad dream, permission was given to fast in such a case also on the Sabbath, but on condition that one would atone for fasting on the Sabbath, by observing another fast day, a week from the day after the Sabbath in question.</page><page sequence="15">326 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY to be made-as in the order to eat three meals-with the delib- erate attempt to remove earlier associations connected with the day. In this way, we can understand the curious discussion found in rabbinical writings regarding the question of clothes on the Sabbath. On the Babylonian "unfavorable days," it will be recalled, the king is prohibited from changing his clothes. It is in the light of this prohibition that the opinion of some of the rabbis becomes intelligible, who declare that one must change one's clothes on the Sabbath. And one authority goes so far as to declare that the "sanctifiatur" of the day mentioned in Gen. 2: 3 refers to the garments to be worn on the Sabbath. Unless some ancient popular usage existed that discountenanced dis- play of one's dress on the Sabbath, the rabbis would not have concerned themselves with a point that on the surface appears trivial. For some reason it was felt that the ancient usage was not in keeping with a proper observance of the day.52 But while emphasizing the resemblance of this Hebrew insti- tution, in its earlier form, to the "inauspicious" days observed by the Babylonians, we must at the same time recognize the points at which the former deviates from the latter. The Baby- lonian view of the responsibility of the king for the welfare of his people finds no place in the biblical injunctions for the Sab- bath, but there are traces that the Hebrews, too, held a belief of this kind at one time. The strong and unmistakable emphasis which the Pentateuch lays upon the fact that the "whole people is holy" (Ex. I9:6; Deut. 7:6; 14:2, etc.; Lev. II :43; 9:2, etc.) sounds again like a protest against an older doctrine according to which holiness was restricted to certain favored individuals--kings or priests or heroes. Hence, while the Babylonian measures for the "unfavorable" days are limited to the king, in the Pentateuch the entire people is commanded to observe the precautions. Still more significant is the celebration of the Sabbath every seventh day, regardless of any reference to the phases of the moon. There is no trace of any such step 5 So, e. g., Huna in Midrash Rabba to Genesis, ? I I; others say that it is sufficient to examine them to see whether they are in good condition; others, that one must wear them long, so as to vary from the customary fashion of the week.</page><page sequence="16">ORIGINAL CHARACTER OF THE HEBREW SABBATH 327 having been taken by the Babylonians, or, for that matter, by any people outside of the Hebrews. And yet the original dependence of the Sabbath upon the new moon-which has been so clearly demonstrated as to require no further comment - carries with it the assumption that the Hebrews must at one time have observed a Sabbath at intervals of seven days corre- sponding with the moon's phases. This being the case, it follows that the Hebrews were influenced by the same motives that sug- gested to the Babylonians to give to the 7th, I4th, 2ISt, 28th day after the new moon a special character. The change in the appearance of the heavenly body symbolized a critical period in the affairs of mankind. Would the new phase bring good or ill fortune ? The observation - still regarded as significant by the modern farmer--that changes of weather are often coincident with changes in the moon's phases will also not have escaped such close observers as the ancient Babylonians; and, though new moon festivals are not limited to the agricultural population among the Semites,53 it is among agriculturalists, such as the Hebrews and Babylonians were to a large extent, that such fes- tivals acquire special prominence. It was important, at such critical periods as are represented by the changes in the moon's phases,54 to secure the good-will of the deity. Special precau- tions had to be used at such times not to offend the god or gods to whom these days were set aside.55 Close, therefore, though the direct connection is that existed between the Baby- lonian custom of regarding the four days coinciding with changes in the moon's phases as "inauspicious" days, and the original form of the Hebrew Sabbath, a complete rupture was brought about when once the step was taken of selecting every seventh day of the year as a Sabbath without reference to the position 53 DOUGHTY, Arabia Deserta, I, p. 366; II, pp. 225, 306. 54The appearance of the new moon itself is, however, a natural occasion of joy at the return of the lost planet. Hence the first day of the month was not, in Babylo- nia, an " inauspicious" day. 55 In the case of the two Babylonian months for which we have complete cal- endars, and probably, therefore, in the case of the others, the seventh day is sacred to Marduk and Sarpanitum, the fourteenth to Ninib and Nergal, the twenty-first to Sin and Shamash, the twenty-eighth to Ea.</page><page sequence="17">THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY of the day in the month - a rupture that cleared the way, also, for an independent development of the Hebrew institution. There were probably several factors at work in bringing about this departure, but an important one was the predominating emphasis laid upon what was originally only one feature in the precautionary measures prescribed for the day- the abstention from labor. Practically, this abstention is involved in the Baby- lonian ordinances for the king on the inauspicious days of the month. A ruler who is not to show himself in his chariot, not to hold court, not to bring sacrifices, not to change his clothes, not to eat a good dinner, and not even to curse his enemies, has really very little left to do. The restrictions cover the pro- gramme of the daily life at court. Adapting the principles involved in these measures to the conditions of the people, what other form could the ordinances take than to restrain the masses from following their customary pursuits? The simple edict, "Six days shalt thou work and on the seventh day cease" (Ex. 34:21), covered the whole range of precautionary measures- summed them up in a nutshell. Moreover, by emphasizing this feature of cessation from labor, the way was prepared for an interpretation of labor (Ab^hdd), which extended its range so as to embrace restrictions like the prohibition to kindle fires, to leave one's dwelling, and more the like, for the explanation of which we must have recourse, as already intimated, to an entirely different series of ideas. If we assume that the manna was origi- nally withheld on the seventh day, because it was an "unfavor- able" day, we can also understand that it was dangerous to show one's self before the deity angered or prone to anger, and that therefore the people were ordered to stay indoors. In this way, the parallels offered by Babylonian customs to biblical regulations are accounted for, and, at the same time, the transformation of a day of atonement and propitiation into a day of rest becomes intelligible. IV. In order to justify the position here maintained, which involves an ultimate and direct contact between the religious 328</page><page sequence="18">ORIGINAL CHARACTER OF THE HEBREW SABBATH 329 views of the Babylonians and Hebrews, it will not be amiss to recall how largely the idea of anger and propitiation enters into the conception of deity held by the ancient Hebrews. Up to a late period Yahwe is pictured as a god who manifests his wrath frequently. Though represented as a god of "long endurance," he appears generally as enraged at some defection or misdeed on the part of his followers. So prominent is this trait that many scholars have felt tempted to interpret the name of Yahwe as the god of storms and lightning, who had his seat on the heights of Mt. Sinai. He loves his subjects, but the latter are commanded to "fear" him, and the word "fear" was not employed as a metaphor when first introduced. His anger was represented by a later age as righteous indignation. Frequently it was so, and ultimately the conception of the angered Yahwe led to a lofty ethical view of his rule over mankind; but even righteous wrath is anger, and an angered god had to be appeased in some way. In the sacrificial regulations of the Pentateuch the guilt offering occupies a prominent place.56 The two most solemn days in the Jewish calendar are the Day of Atonement, on which propitiation of the deity is the feature accompanying the confession of sins, and the New Year's Day, which is not a day of rejoicing at all, but a very somber occasion, in the rites of which propitiation is so prominent as to make the day the precursor to the Day of Atonement, celebrated ten days later. To further emphasize the leading thought of the two days, the nine days intervening between the New Year's Day and the Day of Atone- ment are regarded by the Jewish church as days of "peni- tence." In the ritual for the seventh day of the feast of Booths, known as Hoshana Rabba, the "atonement" motif is again introduced in propitiatory prayers prescribed for the occa- 56 All errors, sins, and mistakes had to be atoned for. So constant was the fear of provoking Yahwe to anger that even on the festivals which were supposed to be days of rejoicing the guilt offering was not absent. Sin, atonement, and pacification are the prominent themes in the biblical psalms of all periods, just as they are con- stantly dwelt upon in the religious poetry of the Babylonians. The resemblance so frequently pointed out between the penitential psalms of Babylonia and biblical pro- ductions is significant for the agreement in the view taken by both Hebrews and Baby- lonians, regarding the relationship of the gods to mankind. See, e. g., FRANCIS BROWN, " The Religious Poetry of the Babylonians," Presbyterian Review, i888, pp. 79 seq.</page><page sequence="19">THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY sion.57 Similarly, amidst the rejoicing incident to other festivals, a minor key is sounded as if to warn the people not to arouse their god to anger by a display of unbounded joy. But more significant than these indications is the use of a technical term in the Old Testament for which the Babylonian furnishes a strik- ing equivalent, and which further justifies the comparison of the early character of the Hebrew Sabbath with a Babylonian tm nub libbi. V. The objection may be raised against the thesis here defended that the proof has not yet been furnished that the unfavorable days among the Babylonians were actually known as t m n t b i b b i, "days of propitiation," or as s a b a t t u m, which, it will be recalled, is recorded by the Babylonian scribes as the term equivalent to the phrase u m n t b i b b i. The fact, however, that the latter phrase is merely a description of a b a t t u m answers the first part of the objection. Since t m nu b 1 i b b i is not the name of an institution, but merely a term based upon the well-established usage of n t b i b b i, "rest of the heart," for propitiation, it is sufficient to prove that the idea of propitia- tion is prominent in the observances of certain days, to justify us in regarding any day on which the attempt would be made to conciliate an angered deity, or one liable to become angry, as an um ntb libbi, "a day of propitiation." Of more serious moment is the circumstance that s a b a t t u m has not yet been met with in any religious text of the Babylonians. If, however, we turn once more to the passage in the lexicographical tablet where the term occurs, we will find that the same is the case with the terms preceding a b a t t u m (in the same column), and which are either allied to it or contrasted with it. Such are 57The so-called Seliboth, e. g., LEESER'S Prayer Book, Pt. 8, pp. 74-I85. My friend, Judge Sulzberger, kindly directed my attention to this point. The Hoshanna that forms the refrain to the chants on the first seven days of the feast of Booths must be an old pilgrim shout upon seeing the sanctuary again after an interval of longer or shorter duration. The shout recalls the labaik shouted by the pilgrims to Mecca, and which, like the Hebrew Holana, is made the refrain of pilgrims' songs. See, e. g., BURTON, A Personal Narrative of a Pilgrimage to Mecca and Medina, Vol. II, chap. xii. 330</page><page sequence="20">ORIGINAL CHARACTER OF THE HEBREW SABBATH 331 um r ii s t i m " day of rainstorm;" t m z i k a ti, "favorable day;" um idirti, "day of sorrow;" um bubbulu m,58 "day of disappearance."59 Of these, the latter alone occurs,60 and of the words in the left-hand column only t m n u - b a t - ti m.6' The latter, indeed, appears to have been the common designation for a particular class of sacred days, also of an austere character, and Jensen is of the opinion that n u b a t tu may be an ideo- graphic, or possibly phonetic, designation for our sa b a t t um.62 This view, however, is not tenable, nor is the proof which he fur- nishes that n u b a t t u signifies "rest" at all satisfactory.63 The tablet in question, or at least the portion of it with which alone we are concerned, is a study of terms for unfavorable and favorable days. In view of the large number of such days that the Babylonians had, it is not surprising to find a variety of terms for such occasions, differentiated according to the particu- lar character of the unfavorable day. Stormy days, the days when the moon was not visible, days of mourning for a deceased relative, days of divine wrath-all those were in one sense or the other "unfavorable" days. The words in the corresponding lines of the first and second column are entered as synonyms, and it matters little whether, as in most cases, the second column furnishes the name of the day and the first column the descrip- tion, or vice versa, as in other cases. Since the meaning of um n b libbi is clear, it follows that sabattum is a term actually used by the Babylonians, and in the exact sense that holds good 58JEREMIAS, Babyl.-Assyr. Vorstell. v.

Io8. 63 Haupt probably no longer adheres to the explanation suggested in the Beitrage z. Assyriologie, I, p. 144, note. There must be some association or opposition between nubattum and AB-AB, since both in the case of the intercalated Elul and of Markheshwan (IV R., plates 32 and 33) the day following a nubattum, i. e., the 4th, 8th, and I7th of the month, is called flm AB-AB. Unfortunately, the meaning of AB-AB here is not known. Sayce's opinion (Hibbert Lectures, p. 7I, note 2) needs no refutation. That the fm AB-AB is a favorable day follows from a passage in Sargon Cylinder, 1. 59, for it is on an AB-AB that the king lays the foundation of Diur- Sarukin.</page><page sequence="21">THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY for the phrase by which it is described. It is not necessary for maintaining the view here held of the original character of the Hebrew Sabbath that a b a t t u m should actually have been applied by the Babylonians to the specific "unfavorable" days represented by the 7th, I4th, 2Ist, and 28th days of the month; it is sufficient if we can show that the Hebrew possesses a term like s a b a t t u m, and used in the sense of "propitiation." This proof can, I venture to think, be furnished. VI. The view as to the connection between the Hebrew Sabbath and some Babylonian institution has been placed in a wrong light by the general assumption, on the part of those favoring such a connection, that the Hebrew word t.J corresponds to the Babylonian s a b a t t um. The assumption is not accurate, for while the two terms are related, the one is not the equivalent of the other.64 The word corresponds closely to the Hebrew ilnrM (shabbdthon). It is with this word that I propose to compare our sabattum,65 the n in the Hebrew noun being represented by m in the Assyrian, thus a-ba-tun = s a - b a (t)- tum. Apart from the philological justification of this com- parison, the usage of 31r::j in the Old Testament shows that it is a general term like sabattum, and not the name for a 64The Hebrew word lacks the ending um, nor is the double t of Sabat- tum paralleled in Hebrew. The ending um might be regarded as the emphatic addition so frequently added to Babylonian nouns, but the writing with the double t would not be accounted for on this supposition. We should expect the word to be written ?a-ba-tum, as we have ir-si-tum (Hebrew V7Y ), ?ar-ra-tum (Hebrew m?), and the like. In abattum, therefore, the m appears to be used as an afformative m attachedto the word. See DELITZSCH, Assyr. Grammatik, ? 65, No. 36. It is possible to distinguish in Assyrian much more carefully than has been done between the m attached as a mimrmation and an m attached as an afformative preceded by a or u. 65 The writing with one b bears out the view advanced by J. BARTH, Nominalbil- dung, p. 324, and also by LAGARDE, Uebersicht iiber die im Aramdischen, etc., Bil- dung der Nomina, p. 202, that the reduplication of the second radical in Hebrew nouns with the afformative -dn as ilhST, ]''nR, '"p- , and the like (see the list in LAGARDE, loc. cit., pp. I97-203), is a phonetic device to protect the short vowel z, and does not justify us in regarding such nouns as formations from intensive (or Piel) stems. 332</page><page sequence="22">ORIGINAL CHARACTER OF THE HEBREW SABBATH 333 specific institution like 8abbath.66 A careful study of the pas- sages where the word occurs will show, I think, that sabbath6n does not signify " rest," or " observance of rest," or " solemn rest." It occurs altogether ten times, and all these passages are in the Pentateuch, in the so-called " Code of Holiness " and the " Priestly Code." In the Priestly Code (Lev. 23: 24), the New Year's Day is called a _i.lD ; Lev. 23: 39, the first and eighth days of the harvest festival (Sukkoth) are so designated in the same chapter (vs. 32). In the Priestly Code (Lev. 6: 3I), the Day of Atonement is spoken of as a 'iIB.r, while the sabbatical year (Lev. 25:4) is called a inrt: r~,67 and it occurs four times in connection with the Sabbath (Ex. 16: 23; 35:2; 31:15; and Lev. 23:3). The words with the afformative an, and more particularly those of the form kat(t)alan, appear to belong to the older stratum of the language.68 With one or two excep- tions, the words of this form are of rare occurrence, and we are justified, therefore, in assuming that j'tOit is older than, or at 66To simply render it as an abstract noun - a derivative of nFri (e. g., KEIL, Biblischer Kommentar, to Ex. I6: 23, " Ruhe; " STRACK, Kurzgefasster Koamentar, to same passage, "Ruhefeier;" so also DILLMANN, Corn. to Exodus, p. 174; REUSS, La Bible, I, 2, p. 47, "jour de repos ")--is unsatisfactory. Nor can we account for its usage by making it an emphatic term, as others propose, e. g., the Authorized Version "rest; " Revised Version, " solemn rest." Of the ancient versions, the Septuagint ren- ders dvdiravcrs; the Targum (S'bathd or N'yahQ) regards gabbathOn as the status emphaticus of Sabbath, while the Vulgate (requies) agrees with the Septuagint. 67 And also linr- n_t (ibid., 5). 68 The numerous proper names in Hebrew (over sixty) ending in an or 6n point in this direction, and an examination of the common nouns of this form shows that they either belong to poetic diction, which furnishes a presumption in favor of their being archaic, or occur as technical terms that have survived the period when nouns of this form ceased to be used. It is impossible here to enter upon a detailed statement regarding these nouns, which merit a special investigation. Suffice it to call attention here to the following facts: ^t't1 (Ps. 7: I; the Plural: Hab. 3: I) is a technical term in literature or music. 7i~. (Hos. 8: 5; Amos 4: 6; Ps. 26: 6; 73: I3); 1T:. (Ezek. 27:27); and ''1~. (Lev. 5: 21, 23; Gen. 4I:36), are technical, legal, and commercial terms. Again, 7p-, P .I t , iIt?, '7w-, j 7', and 7itlx occur only in the chapter of curses (Deut. 28) or in passages dependent upon their occurrence in this chapter. The chapter, though containing various additions that belong to the period of the exile or later, is pre-exilic in its origin, and contains numerous standing phrases that make the impression of having become proverbial. The word liTSn, used only in connection with the tradition of the exodus from Egypt (Ex. 12: I;</page><page sequence="23">THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY least as old as, hIXt5. In any case, it can be shown that its use is not dependent upon ItnI. The phrase, "rqi th%I , is found in connection with the ordinary Sabbath,69 as well as in connection with the Day of Atonement (Lev. I6:3I) and for the sabbatical year (Lev. 25:4). The two terms,when thus used,are syntactically in apposition, rtQ being the name of the institution, and lint: a term descriptive of the institution. In other words, the Sab- bath is called a oabbdthOn precisely as the New Year's Day, the Day of Atonement, and the first and eighth days of the harvest festi- vals are so called. That this is the correct interpretation of the phrase is evidenced by the interchange in the position of the two words.70 To account, therefore, for this term j'iItr being applied to four other days of the year besides the Sabbath, one must dis- cover some feature which the four days have in common with the Sabbath. This common feature cannot be cessation from labor, for rest is also ordained for the first and seventh days of Passover (Lev. 23:7-8) and for the Pentecost festival (ibid., 21), none of which are designated as nlll_ . Sanctification-a second feature of the Sabbath-is also common to all the holy days. VII. A reference has already been made to the austere and gloomy character of the New Year's Day and the Day of Atone- ment. The New Year's Day, in addition to being a 1Il1l , is called a zikkdrOn, "a memorial day," a terf'a, "a day of agitation." It is the day, according to the Jewish tradition (as expressed in the ritual for the occasion), when the Lord sits in judgment and Deut. 16:3; Is. 52: 12) is certainly an old word, and so is '1li., found only in the phrase :.'Ii J.:'12-.9 (Gen. 3: i6 and in Gen. 5:29, which is a direct reference to the former passage). 1h'11 occurs in a poetical fragment in Jeremiah (17: i8), and in a phrase I fInD ]'TI~, Ezek. 21:11 (in parallelism with the dtrat Xery6/evov, [n3'1m), which, like the standing phrase, 7IB llnl; (Ezek. I6:63; 29: 21), impresses one as old. The only word of this class that may be reckoned among the words of the language in common use is 'i'V1 . 'llT (Jer. I7: I), literally "fingernail," and used as the name of the stylus, is certainly a very old word. 69 In the four passages above quoted. 7 In one place (Ex. 35:2) we find p'1'r nl110; in another (Ex.

This concep- tion is very old, and is to be compared with the Babylonian New Year's festival, known as Zagmuk, when Marduk and his associates assemble in Du-Azagga, "the chamber of fates," 71 to determine the lot of their subjects. On New Year's Day we are told the fate of mankind is decreed, and the decree is sealed on the Day of Atonement.72 The New Year's Day accordingly is preeminently an occa- sion on which it is necessary to secure the good-will of the deity. One's happiness for the year depends upon making the day an um nftb libbi-a day of propitiation. The Day of Atonement bears the same character as the New Year's Day, only that the hope of propitiation dominates the rites completely. Coming to the harvest festival, I venture to think that here also the propitiation motif suggests the application of linSl to the first and eighth days. The festival coincided with the period when the winter rains, so essential to agricultural prosperity in Palestine and Babylonia, were about to begin. The eighth day is especially set aside in the ritual for interceding with Yahwe to bring down the rain plentifully and in due season.73 In order that the appeal should be effective, Yahwe must be favorably inclined. The day thus becomes one on which it was again essential not to arouse the deity's displeasure. This pro- pitiatory aspect of the day is also indicated in some way by the term n?'1 applied no less than four times to it (Lev. 23:36; Num. 29:35; Neh. 8:18; 2 Chron. 7:9). The meaning "assembly," by which the term is usually translated, can only be secondary. The only sense in which the stem underlying I'lSV is used is that of "shutting off, restraining."

The common wish among the Jews for one another on New Year's Day is, "May you be 'inscribed' [i. e., in the divine scroll] for a good life," and on the Day of Atonement, "May you be 'sealed' for a good life." 73It is to be noted that the day is regarded as a distinct and separate occasion. j2.9 'SQ ^\ 't~1VI. (Treatise Sukkdth, 47b.)</page><page sequence="25">THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY B'2s was, therefore, "a day of restraint." 74 Outside of the Pentateuch there are at least two passages which strengthen the supposition that the Zt.Y was originally a term descriptive of restraints of some kind, prescribed for certain occasions. The prophet Joel ( I: 14) uses the words as a synonym of BIS, " fast," and when Isaiah declares (: I 3), S 1 _ YI t_ b, "I cannot tolerate iniquity and asdar," he cannot mean "holy assembly" (as commonly translated), since he has just said previously "new moon, Sabbath, holy assembly are an abomination to me," whereas, by a rendering like "I cannot tolerate iniquity and fasting" (or some other kind of "restraint"), we obtain a satis- factory contrast. One can easily see how, with such a meaning originally attached to the term, the word should come to be used for "holy assembly," since on days of "restraint" it was cus- tomary to seek the sanctuaries. In 2 Kings I: 20 the word is used in this wider sense. On the other hand, in Jer. 9:I, the phrase =n.h- 'ZYS does not mean an "assembly" of faithless ones, but a "band "-literally " a closed corporation "-a mean- ing that is easily derived from the original force of the verb '_gY. Be this as it may, the passage in Nehemiah (8 :18) where ?i and 74 The Jewish commentator Kambi already recognized this meaning of the term and expressed the opinion that the day was so called because the people were " shut up" in the place of holy assembly on that day. Michaelis and Ikenius (see GESENIUS, Thesaurus, p. 1059) accepted Kambi's suggestion as to the sense of the term, only that they applied the restraint to the ordinance to cease from labor. This view is not acceptable, since the Pentateuch employs a totally different phrase to express this ordinance. Moreover, since the prohibition against work is common to all fes- tivals, other holy days should also have been designated as r'Y1. Now, it is true in one passage (Deut. 16:8) the seventh day of Passover is called an r1t3 , but the Samaritan translation replaces the word by 'n. The Septuagint has two words, b68&amp;ov sopr4, i. e., ON ^tr'7. If, therefore, the Hebrew text is correct, it seems that the term had already acquired a more general signification. This may also be con- cluded from the fact that, in the Talmud, the Pentecost festival receives the name of Azereth. But this extension of the term does not militate against the view taken of the application of the word to the eighth day of festival, for the sufficient reason that this eighth day has a character of its own. It is not, like the seventh day of Passover, merely the close of the festival week The ritual for the day is of a distinctive character-different from that arranged for the seventh day of the harvest festival, which is also a sacred occasion (see below). Outside of the applica- tion to the holy days the noun only occurs in the Old Testament in'Jer. 9: I .sh Irl'37, i. e., a band (literally "a closed corporation ") of treacherous men. 336</page><page sequence="26">ORIGINAL CHARACTER OF THE HEBREW SABBATH 337 nWty both are used, but the former applied to the seven days of the harvest festival, while the eighth day alone is called B.., is conclusive for some special significance attached to the latter term, and when Nehemiah says that they observed a I-ag of seven days and on the eighth day there was an rn'sy according to established rite (ttZX5.), it is clear that lS2 is something totally distinct from the Hag and originally meant something more than a mere "assembly" of the people. The meaning "restraint" involved in the word justifies us in assuming that certain precautionary measures-such as fasting, keeping within doors or within the sanctuary, avoiding the displeasure of Yahwe-were prescribed for the day which gave it the character of an tm nit libbbi or Sabbdth6n. Apart from the special character of this eighth day of the harvest festival, the name by which the festival is known, Sukk6th, or "booths," points to its having been more than an agricul- tural festival. The gathering together and dwelling in booths have a curious parallel in the custom of the Arabs to spend three days in the sacred month of pilgrimage camping out in booths in the valley of Mina outside of Mecca.75 The Hebrews at one time, like the Arabs, paid a visit to a sanctuary (wherever it might be) only once a year, and not three times as the later law enjoined (Ex. 23: 14; Deut. I6: i6). The pilgrimage in the fall is, therefore, an earlier institution than the two other Bags which occur in the spring and summer, and appears to have existed, like the Arabic pilgrimage to Mecca, and to the surround- ing ancient sanctuaries of Mecca,76 independently of any agri- cultural festival, antedating indeed the agricultural stage in the history of the Hebrews.77 Naturally the first day of the pilgrimage, when after an absence of one year the worshiper again stepped into the pres- 75 It is significant that in Ezek. 45 :25; Neh. 8: 14, as well as in the Talmud, the Sukk6th festival is called "THE fag "- the pilgrimage festival par excellence. 76 WELLHAUSEN, Reste arabischten Heidenthums, pp. 75-80; SNOUCK HURGRONJE, Het Mekkaansche Feest, chap.

He had to make sure that the deity would welcome his presence, and he would be correspondingly careful not to do anything that might arouse his god's displeasure. The first day of the great Hag thus assumed the character of "a day of propitiation" in the broad sense, as implying, not necessarily a state of anger on the part of the deity, but only a state of uncertainty on the part of the worshiper as to the disposition of the deity towards him. Finally, the designation l~nt t_ D for the sabbatical year may be readily explained on the basis of the interpretation here pro- posed for /abbdthOn. The ancient Hebrews held in common with their fellow-Semites that the land belonged to the deity.78 Hence the tithes offered as a kind of partial interest for the loan of the capital, and hence also the interruption of the usu- fruct at stated intervals as a means of conciliating the deity and of securing the continuance of his good-will.79 The observance of this institution every seventh year is, of course, dependent upon the celebration of a Sabbath every seventh year, but this feature does not settle the age of the institution itself, and there is every reason to believe that it was in existence at a very early stage in the agricultural period of the Hebrew com- munities. The extension of the sabbatical year to a year of general release from debts8" belongs to a later stage, when commerce had begun to play an important role by the side of agriculture. The term M14 t tO_ is used only in connection with the inter- ruption of agricultural activity, and the propitiatory phase of the custom is well illustrated by the ordinance in Deut. 31: Io- 78 ROBERTSON SMITH, Religion of the Semites, pp. 92 seq. Such a belief becomes intelligible as an outcome of the primitive notion which regarded the gods as sprung from the earth. To derive a benefit from the produce of the earth was in a measure robbing Yahwe of what belonged to him. One could not go on doing this without making sure that Yahwe regarded the course with favor. 79 It was not prudent to appear greedy, and it was well from time to time to take measures that might oppose the easily enkindled anger, or, better still, prevent that anger from being enkindled. One is not to appear " empty-handed" before Yahwe (Deut. I6: 16, etc.). 80 Known as g'mitt in the Deuteronomic Code, 15: I, 2, 9, and 31: IO.

No doubt, the compiler of the Deuteronomic Code, when introducing the phrase Fin3&gt; _ Mt, had in mind the resting from labor as the central feature of the Sabbath. All that is maintained here is that the religious beliefs giving rise to such an institution as the "sab- batical year" are more primitive than the conceptions controlling the fully developed Sabbath of the Priestly Code, and that ]i5. = may have been applied to a yearly or shorter period of interruption of agricultural activity, in the same sense in which it was applied to the New Year's Day, to the Day of Atone- ment, and to the first and eighth days of the annual pilgrimage season. I maintain, then, that the atonement and pacification idea gives rise to and originally controls the use of inim- in the Old Testament, and that we are justified in regarding this term as the equivalent of the Babylonian a b a t t u m, or, in other words, Jjrll= is the old Hebrew term for an u m nub libb i-a day of propitiation. If then the Sabbath itself is called a ~i.-VQ-as is the case in four passages-it is because the Sab- bath had originally the character of a day of atonement. From this point of view we can understand why the Day of Atone- ment itself is in one passage (Lev. 16:31) also called a nrI as well as a lfni'_. The use of the term is based upon the origi- nal character of the Sabbath as a day of atonement, and for the same reason the sabbatical year (Lev. 25:4) is called a Int1. . An institution arising from a desire to insure one's self of the good-will of the deity in pursuing one's vocation suggested a comparison with an inauspicious day, solemnized by precaution- ary measures to curb or to prevent the rise of the divine wrath. The application of the term Sabbath itself to the Day of Atone- ment and to the sabbatical year constitutes, therefore, another link in the chain of our argument. 8'Deut. 31 :10. One gains the impression that the compiler of this ordinance knows only of one pilgrimage during the year.</page><page sequence="29">THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY VIII. How this original character of the Sabbath underwent such a profound change has already been briefly indicated. Several points, however, remain to be noticed. It is important to note that the Hebrew theologians themselves were not a unit as to the origin of the Sabbath. As is well known, the deuteronomic decalogue does not recognize the six days of creation which the book of the Covenant (Ex. 20: 9) assigns as the reason for rest- ing on every seventh day. The deuteronomic Sabbath is to be "guarded" ('itt) as a reminiscence of the exodus from Egypt. The connection between the exodus and the Sabbath has been a vexing problem to exegetes. A satisfactory associa- tion of ideas is obtained if we start from the original character of the Sabbath here maintained. The day on which they, accord- ing to the Hebrew traditions, left their Egyptian homes was in a preeminent sense an " unfavorable" day. It was a day on which Yahwe had manifested his anger in an unmistakable manner. The messenger of death had been sent out, and the miraculous salvation of the Hebrews was a consequence of the propitiatory character residing in the placing of blood-the sacred symbol of life-on the threshold. Yahwe "crossed over" 82 the thresh- olds of those houses singled out by the blood. He was pacified by the sight of the blood, which constituted at once an offering and a sign of allegiance. The "unfavorable" day was thus changed by Jehovah's crossing over the threshold into a " favor- able" one for the Hebrews. The association with the Sabbath viewed as a day of uncertain aspect-the danger from which was averted by the observance of precautionary measures-thus becomes obvious. The use of the word "l:I, "be on the lookout for," as intro- ductory to the section regarding the Sabbath is also significant. It is a verb expressing a warning, as is ritT, "remember," which is used in the decalogue of the "book of the Covenant." The conclusion has always been drawn from these words (and properly so) that the existence of the Sabbath is assumed as a standing institution by the decalogue, but it is difficult to believe that 82 See TRUMBULL, Threshold Covenant, p. 206. 340</page><page sequence="30">ORIGINAL CHARACTER OF THE HEBREW SABBATH 341 people should have been "warned" and cautioned not to forget the Sabbath, unless the day was one that was fraught with a certain kind of danger. Moreover, the question may be asked, why should the Sabbath alone of religious institutions be embodied in the decalogue? It is generally admitted that, as a day of absolute rest, and as a reminiscence of the creation of the world, the Sabbath did not come into prominence until the period of the Babylonian .exile, 83 and yet, although there are many other sacred days in the year, the Sabbath alone is mentioned. Even in the oldest form of the decalogue84 a warning regarding the Sabbath was included. As a day of propitiation, however, the Sabbath is appropriately placed in the first divison of the deca- logue. The command not to worship other gods by the side of Yahwe is inculcated, as we are expressly told, so as not to arouse the anger of Yahwe. There follows the command not to invoke Yahwe's name for magic incantations, and again it is stated that Yahwe will punish-that is, will manifest his anger towards- him who uses the sacred name in this way. The group is closed by a reminder to observe the proper (and assumed to be well- known) precautionp on a day when Yahwe may easily be roused to anger and when it is especially important to propitiate him. The precautions are so well known that in the original form of the decalogue no mention is made of them. The warning suffices, and it is only in the amplified form produced under the influence of the later and distinctively Jewish conception of the Sabbath that the order to abstain from all labor and to keep others from working is tacked on, together with reasons for this order. 83 MONTEFIORE, Hibbert Lectures on "The Religion of the Ancient Hebrews," pp. 229-30. Not much is to be gleaned from the scanty notices about the Sabbath found in the prophets. The two centuries preceding the Babylonian exile appear to have been a period of transition. The old Sabbath as a day of propitiation was dying out. From Amos (8: 5) one might conclude that the Sabbath and new moon had become market days. The notice in Hosea (2: 13) furnishes no clew. Jeremiah (I7: 21-24) foreshadows the distinctively Jewish Sabbath. The later Isaiah (56: 2-6; 58 : 3-I4; 66 :23) points in the same direction, while in Ezekiel (46: I-I2; 22: 26) the transition has taken place. 84 See BRIGGS, "Genesis of the Ten Words," Sunday School Times, June 4, I887; and BRIGGS, Higher Criticism, pp. I8i seq.</page><page sequence="31">THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY If the arguments advanced have any force, it will be appar- ent that, of the two reasons assigned for the observance of the Sabbath, the one that connects the institution with the exodus from Egypt is not only much the older, but fits in with the original character of the Sabbath as a day of propitiation. The other reason for the observance of the Sabbath as a reminis- cence of the creation of the world belongs to the later phase of the institution, while the fact that the Hebrew theology has pre- served two " reasons " furnishes the strongest possible proof for the thesis that the conception of the Sabbath must have under- gone a profound change. The Jewish contribution to the old 6abbath6n is, in the first place, the emphasis laid upon what was merely an incidental feature of the latter. By this emphasis the day lost its former aspect as one filled with various measures of a propitiatory force and became one sanctified, in a special sense, to Yahwe. Sec- ondly, the departure from the old conception was aided by the important step taken at some time to celebrate a iabbdth6n every seventh day without reference to the relationship of the day to the moon's phases. The old associations connected with "favor- able" and "unfavorable" days necessarily lost much, if not all, of their force when this step was once taken. The Sabbath could no longer be regarded as an unfavorable or an uncertain day when no longer any reason was apparent for so regarding it. The changed character of the institution required a new reason, and this reason was found in the doctrine that Yahwe himself had set the example by observing the chief feature of the developed institution, in that he rested from his labors on the seventh day. Theological reasons for religious observances always follow the observances themselves. The doctrine is later than the rite, and often the same rite gives rise to different doctrines. While, therefore, the Jewish theologians are guided by a correct instinct, as will presently be shown, in connecting the Sabbath with the creation of the world, the division of the work of creation into six days, which is admittedly a late feature and represents the Hebrew elaboration of the old traditions which the Hebrews 342</page><page sequence="32">ORIGINAL CHARA CTER OF THE HEBREW SABBA TH 343 shared with the Babylonians,85 is, I believe, strongly influenced, if not, indeed, actually called forth, by the change in the cele- bration of a Sabbath from intervals of seven days, corresponding to the moon's phases, to regular intervals of seven days through- out the year. But this theological association of the Sabbath with the creation story was not arbitrarily made. In maintaining this association, the theologians themselves were influenced by an important feature in the original and popular view of the story related in the opening chapters of Genesis. When we are told in the second verse of the second chapter of Genesis that Yahwe "rested" on the seventh day from all that he had done, one cannot help being struck by the anthropomorphic conception implied in this "resting." The conception is so contrary to the whole attitude of the Jewish theologians of post-exilic days that it is impossible to suppose that it should have originated with them. Wellhausen86 and Gunkel87 have pointed out a number of expressions in the Genesis narrative of creation that sound like faint echoes of primitive conceptions that gradually lost their original meaning; and the conclusion has properly been drawn by Gunkel that these expressions prove the antiquity of the narrative, so far as its main features are concerned. The expression "Yahwe (or Elohim) rested" impresses one as a trace of some ancient mythological notion-quite independent of any division of the work of creation into six days, and which has been preserved in the present form of the story and given an interpretation different from its original intent. Gunkel expressly accepts 88 the phrase in question as an ancient one and not due to the compiler of the Priestly Code. He fails, how- ever, to give an explanation for it. The Babylonian version of the creation of the world, with which the Hebrew version is so intimately connected, furnishes, I think, the solution of the prob- lem. The basis of the creation narrative in Genesis, as among 85 See the proof of this in GUNKEL'S admirable work, Schoffung und Chaos, pp. 114-17. 86 Prolegomena, second edition, pp. 320-23. 87 Schopfung und Chaos, pp. 7 seq. 88 Ibid., p. I4.</page><page sequence="33">THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY the Babylonians, is the nature myth 89 symbolizing the conquest of the winter storms and rains, by the sun. The chief episode in the Babylonian version of the creation, which thus furnishes an evolutionary theory of creation from chaos to order, not a theory of beginnings from "nothing," is the fight of Marduk with TiAmat and her eleven associates -the representatives of the lawless reign of storms. In Genesis, Yahwe of course assumes the role of Marduk, and Gunkel90 has pointed out the numerous references outside of Genesis to Yahwe's conflict with the winds and storms pictured under such forms of dragons and monsters as the famous Rahab and Leviathan. Yahwe is enraged9' at these monsters, just as Marduk, upon proceeding to the contest with T i ma t, is repre- sented as developing a fury which causes consternation.92 The associates of TifAmat cannot stand Marduk's angry gaze. They are bereft of their senses. " Enraged "93 against T ima t, he hurls forth against her words of reproach and denunciation. After Marduk has subdued T i A m a t and chained her associates, the Babylonian version continues, 1. 135: infb ma b lum, i.e., the Lord rested from his anger-was appeased. It will be noted that the verb used, n bu, is the same that appears in the phrase nitb libbi, and Jensen94 and Zimmern95 are undoubtedly correct in interpreting the verb as "resting" from anger, though it is 89The phenomenon annually witnessed in Babylonia, prior to the perfection of the canal system, of inundations, and the disappearance under water of entire districts, suggested to the Babylonians the picture of primeval chaos, and by placing the annual phenomenon at the beginning of time the change from chaos to order was explained as due to the triumph of the god of the early spring sun over the monsters that symbolized the storms. The appearance of the land, of verdure and vegetation, and the regular movements of the heavenly bodies, all were the direct consequences of this triumph. The conqueror of chaos in the later form of the Babylonian story is Marduk, a solar deity and the head of the late Babylonian pantheon.

The fact does not 344</page><page sequence="34">ORIGINAL CHARA CTER OF THE HEBRE W SABBA TH 34 5 possible, as Delitzsch suggests, that physical rest is also implied in the phrase by the side of pacification. In the light of this significant passage from the Babylonian narrative, it will certainly not be regarded as too bold to inter- pret Yahwe's "resting" as expressing originally his pacification after his conquest of the forces hostile to the order of the world. The double sense inherent in the Hebrew verb sabadt, as in the Babylonian nabu, was a primary factor in preserving the phrase after the original form of the Marduk-TiAmat epi- sode had undergone a modification at the hands of Hebrew writers, while a second factor, and one even more potent, was the possibility that suggested itself of interpreting Yahwe's "rest," now taken in the physical sense, wholly as the basis for the central ordinance of the later and distinctively Jewish Sab- bath. This would not be the only instance in the history of religions in which the misinterpretation or changed interpreta- tion of a term, belonging to an early period of religious thought, has led to the establishment of an important religious doc- trine.96 It was but a small step, when once Yahwe's "resting" was interpreted in a physical sense, to place this "resting" at the close of the whole work of creation instead of the position which his "resting" in the sense of pacification originally occupied, namely, immediately after the fight with chaos. The natural-almost inevitable-association of this "resting" with man's resting every seventh day may legitimately be regarded as the motive that prompted the division of the work of creation into a period of seven days. How arbitrary and artificial this division is may be seen from the phrase (Gen. 2:2), "and appear to have been noticed that in Ethiopic, likewise, we have the stem in question for "pacification." See the book of Henoch, 13: 6, where the juxtaposition of nah&amp;t with saryat, "forgiveness," shows that the former is used in the sense of " pacification." Such a meaning is more satisfactory than Dillmann's suggestion (Das Buck Henoch, p. 7, note), "Langmuth," or Schodde's " patience " (The Book of Enoch, p. 15). 96It is noteworthy, in connection with nAbu, that in Ex. 20:II the same verb, in fact (way-ya-nah), is used as in the Babylonian tale. Jennings already, in his acute chapter on "The Sabbath" (Jewish Antiquities, Edinburgh, I8o8, p. 329), calls attention to the fact that the word in the decalogue must be connected with the phrase re'ab ntboab (Gen. 8 : 2). The "savor of rest" is the savor that is to pro- cure the cessation of Yahwe's anger- a savor of pacification.</page><page sequence="35">THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY Elohim finished on the seventh day his work that he had made." 97 The desire to connect the Sabbath was evidently uppermost in the minds of the compilers, and minor inconsistencies are over- looked in order to establish this connection. Psychologically, it is curious to note that in thus accounting for the rise of the belief that the Sabbath is a reminder of the six days of creation, the pacification idea again enters into play. Yahwe's appease- ment becomes Yahwe's "resting," just as the Sabbath develops from an unfavorable day, on which everything is done to appease Yahwe, and becomes a day on which man, in imitation of Yahwe's example, is commanded to " rest." Incidentally, the interpretation here proposed for the original meaning of the phrase that Yahwe "rested" helps to establish the sense of propitiation and pacification for jiqB.. The sub- stantive being derived from the verb, and not vice versa (in which case the Piel or Hiphil would be used, and not the Kal98), there is, of course, every reason to seek for the sense of "pacification " in the use of tti2. An examination of the passages in the Old Testament where the verb is used will show that it could be appropriately applied to indicate a "cessation" of anger. We must, of course, leave out of consideration the employment of the verb in passages dependent upon the existence of the full- fledged Sabbath. This is the case throughout the Pentateuch (except Ex. 12:I 5), but turning to other parts of the Old Tes- tament, there are several passages where the Kal or Hiphil form of the verb implies the interruption of some state of violence. A notable instance is Isa. 30: 7, where the prophet calls Egypt MnrTtn =1_. I adopt Gunkel's reading,99 who con- nects 11 and Bm:: into one word and translates: das geschweigte Rahab, i. e., "the quieted or appeased Rahab."'I? The refer- 97 The Septuagint, with a correct feeling of the inaccuracy of this statement, changes the word seven into six.

Rahab is one of those monsters, and, according to one version of the myth,?10 Marduk-Yahwe does not kill Rahab, but compels her to cease her raging. In Isa. I3: II' 02the assurance is given by the Lord: '3 t^'T 3i'. 9Tlifl. The " haughtiness of the insolent" is an active force, and some- thing more is meant than is conveyed by the ordinary transla- tion: "I will cause the haughtiness of the insolent to cease." It is a "cessation" brought about by a "quieting down" of the loud-mouthed evil-doers (tS??), against whom the prophet rails. Again, in Ps. 8:3 pacification is involved in the phrase, j3~_Bt.L .NS :.;'i~_, where the power of Yawhe is illustrated by his endowing "children and sucklings" with strength "to quiet down (and thus subdue) the enemy and vengeance seeker." A kifn or dirge introduced by Isaiah in the fourteenth chapter begins (vs. 5): 1t;.._ 2t11 i 5 5 _ iZ : '. The prophet is describing the downfall of Israel's oppressors. The nOges or tyrant does not rest of his own accord. He has been overthrown, and with him violence has given way to mildness. The verb BlT accordingly conveys in this passage also the quieting down of passion. "Ah! the tyrant then rages no more;" violence is subdued. There is a possibility of retaining the word Mlt in 2 Sam. 23: 7: ...t . S: 'li? S . . ?, if we :- *:. - *: / '*: - ; T * I T ** T accept an interpretation like cessation. Speaking of the wicked ones (5'5'), the poet says that when once "they are con- sumed by the fire, they will cease to rage," and he expresses this idea by saying that he will be Bglt , i. e., in a state of "suppression." To simply erase the word103 because of the I'I= 32' in vs. 8 is not satisfactory, since these words represent a corruption for rn2=l2j, i.e., the proper name of Ishbosheth. It is more likely that our word nrll has superinduced the cor- ruption in vs. 8. As a last example, we may instance the man- ner in which the substantive Bltj is used. Proverbs 20: 3, Rahab as "appeased" accords perfectly with the morphological tales about Rahab, so well set forth by Gunkel. '0x Gunkel, ibid., p. 39. x2 See also Ezek. 7 :24.

The ceasing from strife is honorable, because it involves and is brought about by a control over querulous desires-by a "suppression" of the disposition to manifest hostility towards anyone.?04 Indeed, starting from this specific meaning of " quieting," "bringing to rest," we obtain the two common applications of the verb: (I) to interrupt,?10 bring to an end,'06 remove,'?7 destroy ;I08 (2) to rest. The secondary character of the latter sense of the verb is apparent also from the corresponding Assyrian verb which is used to convey the idea of " cessation," as of a storm, and, on the other hand, means to " bring to an end," whereas the sense of " to rest " is not attached to the verb, or, at all events, is not met with. In Arabic, " removing" appears to be the common usage of the verb,109 outside of the direct influence exerted by the Hebrew Sabbath ideas upon the Arabs. In Syriac, the verb signifies "to quiet down" and to cease."? In Ethiopic, the verb is not found except as a denominative 104 We may also note the opinion of one authority, and recorded in the Midrash Rabba, ?

If we were only sure of the meaning of the first word in the phrase rn'i.n 'D[O (2 Kings I6: I8), some additional light might be shed upon the old rites connected with the Sab- bath. There is an Assyrian word massaku (a synonym of papabu, "sacred chamber;" see DELITZSCH, Assyr. Handworterb., p. 420b), with which the Hebrew word may be identical. But what was this "Sabbath chamber" ? Was it perhaps the room to which the king retired on the "inauspicious " day ? STADE, Geschichte des Volkes Israel, p. 598, note 2, confesses his inability to make anything out of it. The recourse to emendations (e. g., GEIGER, Zeitschr. d. Deutsch. Morgenl.

There is, perhaps, a faint trace of the older ideas connected with the term in the meaning of festival, or a " solemn occasion " in general, that the word also has,"2 while no less interesting is the use of the word as a contrast to "youth " (Henoch 0 : I7), since the sense of " old age " depends upon the force of " cessation of activity " inherent in the stem. The "quieting down" period of life is thus called the " Sabbath " of life, While I do not lay much stress upon these somewhat remote usages of the word, it is worth while to call attention to them in connection with an investigation of the Semitic stem in question. On the other hand, the meaning established for the Hebrew verb MtlS, taken in connection with the arguments advanced throughout this paper, removes all doubts as to the direct connection between the stem r1=0 and the noun I'D. I accept Barth's explanation of the form,"3 which makes the noun a transitive derived from the Kal of the verb like lqt7 and with originally short vowel. The final t is not the sign of the feminine, as Hirschfeld sup- poses,"4 who, in reviving a very old view, makes our word a contraction of n'tD, the numeral seven; nor is the term a contracted form of 8R', sabbatht, as Konig (Lehrgebdude der hebraischen Sprache, II, pp. I80 seq.) maintains, following Kamhi and others. The form kattal, as Barth"5 points out, belongs to the oldest period of Semitic speech. The reduplication of the t in the form with the suffix (irtt , Num. 28: 0o; OI. , Hos. 2: 13) reminds one of the reduplication of the tin sa battu m, and is to be explained as due to the influence of the affix, per- haps with the analogy of feminine nouns ending in t, entering as an additional factor. Sabbath is the distinctively Hebrew name "' The insertion of the n is euphonic. LAGARDE'S deductions (Nominalbildung, p. 203 and elsewhere) drawn from the Ethiopic form are not justified. 112 So DILLMANN, Lexicon Linguea .Ethiopice, 370.

The idea of propitiation of the deity enters largely into the thought and religious rites of both Hebrews and Babylonians. 2. The Hebrews, like the Babylonians, distinguished certain days as occa- sions on which measures had to be taken to ensure the good-will of the gods, to prevent their anger from being aroused, or to assuage that anger if aroused. These days were chosen from various motives. One factor in the choice was the association of ideas involved between changes in the appear- ance of the moon or changes of season, and changes in the disposition of the gods towards their subjects. I6 It is interesting to note the general similarity of the Egyptian precautions for unfavorable days to the Babylonian and Hebrew customs. Like the Babylonians, the Egyptians had their calendars in which the favorable and unfavorable days are entered; and, what is more to the point, a single day could have both a favorable and unfavorable character. Dividing the day into three sections, the calendars furnish the indications for each of these sections. Thus (MASPERO, Romans et Poesies au Papyrus Harris, No. 500, pp. 38-9) the 6th Paophi is noted as "good, good, good," that is, each part of the day is good; the 5th Paophi is "bad, bad, bad," that is, the whole day is bad; but the 4th Paophi is noted as "bad, good, good," that is, it begins as an unfavorable day and ends as a favorable one, precisely as the Babylonian t m n a l i b bi. Again we have the 23d Paophi (ibid., p. 41. See also, for further illus- trations, CHABAS, Le Calendrier des jours Pastes et Nefastes de rannle Egyptienne, and WIEDEMANN, Religion of the Egyptians, pp. 263-4) described as "good, good, bad," two-thirds good, but ending as an unfavorable day. For these unfavorable days and days of double aspect we find, as among the Babylonians, precautions prescribed. On the 4th of Paophi one is not to leave one's house - an ordinance that is paralleled by the order found in Exodus for the Sabbath. Similarly, on the 5th Paophi one is not to leave the house, nor to approach one's wife. On the 7th Paophi one is to abstain from all work, clearly for the reason that labor on that day will not meet with the favor of the gods. But the Egyptian theologians furnish a reason of their own for this precautionary rite that forms a perfect parallel to the doctrine of post-exilic Judaism, and it is almost startling to read the entry for the 27th Paophi: " Unfavorable, unfavorable, unfavorable ! Do not leave the house on this day. Do no manual labor. Ra (the god) rests." (MASPERO, ibid., p. 4I. The verb used embodies the idea of con- tentment. It approaches, therefore, the idea of pacification that is prominent in the Babylonian and Hebrew stem iabat.) The precaution against touching fire is also met with. On the IIth of Tybi (ibid., p. 34) "one is not to approach fire," and the reason assigned is that Ra has predestined the fire on that day for the destruction of his enemies. In other words, the sacred element must only be handled when one can be sure of the favorable disposition of the gods. 350</page><page sequence="40">ORIGINAL CHARA CTER OF THE HEBREW SABBATH 351 3. Among both Hebrews and Babylonians these days had either a decidedly inauspicious character, i. e., were unfavorable days, or had an uncertain char- acter, i. e., were days that might become unfavorable, but that could by observing the proper rites be converted into favorable days. 4. Among the terms used to describe such days, the Babylonians had a word s a b a t t u m, for which in Hebrew we have an equivalent, SabbdthOn, both the Babylonian and Hebrew word conveying the idea of "propitiation," "cessation" of the divine anger, pacification, and cognate ideas. 5. The Sabbath of the Hebrews was originally such a gabbdth6n- a day of propitiation and pacification, marked by rites of an atonement character. 6. At this stage in the development of the institution, it was celebrated at intervals of seven days, corresponding with changes in the moon's phases, and was identical in character with the four days in each month (7th, I4th, 2Ist, and 28th) that the Babylonians regarded as days which had to be con- verted into days of pacification. 7. The similarity of the precautionary measures prescribed for these days (and others) by the Babylonians to the biblical rites for the Hebrew Sabbath is to be accounted for by an agreement in the interpretation put upon such days by the two peoples-an agreement due to early contact. 8. Besides the 7th, I4th, 2Ist, and 28th days of each month, the ancient Hebrews had other days which they regarded as and called sabbdth6n, just as the Babylonians had various other days -so, e.g., regularly the nineteenth day of each month in the year-which were either unfavorable or had a twofold aspect as unfavorable days that could be converted into favorable ones. Among the days regarded at sabbdth6n by the Hebrews were the New Year's Day, the Day of Atonement, the first and eighth days of the annual pilrimage to the chief sanctuary, falling in a month held sacred by other Semitics (e. g., Arabs) as well as by the Hebrews, and reverting to a period that lies beyond the reach of historical investigation. 9. The emphasis laid at a later period upon cessation from labor, which was originally merely one feature of many in a sabbdthon, permitted and sug- gested an interpretation of the precautionary rites prescribed for those occa- sions that obscured their original import. to. The introduction, in consequence of profound changes in religious conceptions among the Hebrews, of the custom of celebrating the Sabbath every seventh day, irrespective of the relationship of the day to the moon's phases, led to a complete separation from the ancient view of the Sabbath, while the introduction, at a still later period, of the doctrine that the divine work of creation was completed in six days removed the Hebrew Sabbath still further from the point at which the development of the corresponding Babylonian institution ceased. 11. The original character of the Sabbath as a day of propitiation accounts for its being brought into connection with the exodus from Egypt,</page><page sequence="41">THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY while the association with the traditions regarding creation is due to the later and advanced conceptions that grew up around the institution. The connec- tion with the exodus reflects the continued influence of the ancient popular views of the Sabbath; the association with the creation of the world is the product of Jewish theology, in its natural endeavor to give to the day an origin in keeping with more advanced religious thought. I2. Jewish theology, in making the central feature of the distinctively Jewish Sabbath the imitation of an example set by Yahwe at the beginning of time, found a support for this doctrine in the survival of an ancient phrase in the popular phrase of the narrative, now embodied in the opening chapters of Genesis. That phrase originally referred to the cessation of Yahwe's anger after subduing forces hostile to his rule, but the phrase, embodying the same verb sdbat that underlies sabbdth6n, admitted of an interpretation which made Yahwe "rest" after his exertions. In this sense, the ancient, time- honored phrase-deeply impressed upon the popular mind-was retained and served as the point of departure for the development of one of the most important doctrines set up by the compilers of the Priestly Code-a doc- trine that gave to the Sabbath its hold upon the people and made the institu- tion the great bulwark of Judaism down to the present day. I3. Lastly, to put the contrast concisely between the Sabbath in its origi- nal form and the fully developed post-exilic institution, we might say that the old Sabbath was merely a sabbdthOn, one sabbdthOn among many others, identical in character and spirit with a Babylonian Am ntb libbi or iabat- tum; the developed institution was unique in its character, with rest from all kinds of work as its central idea, a day sacred to Yahweh who had created the world in six days and who had himself set the example for all times by rest- ing on the seventh day. These two features-(a) a day of absolute rest and (b) the doctrine upon which this ordinance is based -represent the distinctively Jewish contribution to the Babylonian-Hebraic sabattum. Between the old sabbdth6n and the new Sabbdth, however, there lies the growth of the Hebrew people from a semi-primitive'condition of religious thought to the advanced belief which controls and dominates the entire pentateuchal legislation in its final- its present-shape. 352</page></plain_text>
