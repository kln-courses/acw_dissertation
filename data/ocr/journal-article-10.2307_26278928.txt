<plain_text><page sequence="1">DISCOURSE AND THE CONQUEST OF DESIRE IN SVEVO'S FICTION Teresa de Lauretis The Last Cigarette I I can give not what men call love, But wilt thou accept not The worship the heart lifts above And the Heavens reject not, The desire of the moth for the star, Of the night for the morrow, The devotion to something afar From the sphere of our sorrow? Shelley, the romanticist, projects desire onto the Heavens, per ceiving it as a means to transcendence. Svevo, the twentieth-century man, studies desire in its concrete and weighty presence, here and now. Yet, as presented in the latter's fiction and beautifully captured by the poet's central images (my italics), the essential nature of desire is one and the same: distance, absence, a tending toward rather than the object toward which one tends, unachieved process, motionless movement. We can only desire what we do not have or what we are not, for desire ceases to be at the very instant of attainment, to be reborn toward a different object, and so on and on until total cessa tion will be imposed by death. In its profoundest nature, as studied by philosophy and psychology, desire is not contingent upon a spe cific object and, therefore, never to be satisfied by attainment—that is to say, we desire what we cannot have/be and only what the Other 91 DISCOURSE AND THE CONQUEST OF DESIRE IN SVEVO'S FICTION Teresa de Lauretis The Last Cigarette</page><page sequence="2">has/is. Desire is mediated, triangular, metaphysical. Its essence, says the French psychiatrist Jacques Lacan, is a manque à l'être, a lack of Being, perceived by the subject as a void which he tries to fill by projecting his desire onto an image (fantasme) existing in the order of the Imaginary.1 A common vehicle, or expressive medium of desire, is the dream. Oneiric symbolism, Freud's "royal road" to the unconscious, as well as neurotic symptoms and imaginary projections, are the language in which desire is signified—"the discourse of the Other." For Lacan, as for Lévi-Strauss, the unconscious is not within the individual, but located outside the subject. "As the organ of a specific function, the unconscious merely imposes structural laws upon inarticulated ele ments which originate elsewhere—impulses, emotions, representations, and memories."2 The unconscious is then the transcendental locus of the symbolic function, i.e., the specifically human ability for indirect or symbolic representation, which makes possible expression and com munication. Despite the fact that the symbolic function is as old as history, and, in fact, brought about what we call civilization, it is since Freud3 that the relation between literary discourse and the "dis course of the Other" has become one of the primary concerns of lit erary criticism. Contemporary poetics recognize, as primitive societies did, the sublime power of the Word which fixates and liberates, hides and reveals, containing in itself the magic of the shaman and the scientist's instrument. Thus literary activity is viewed as discovery and exorcism on a personal level as well as the creation through language of an original interpersonal reality. All of the writers with whom the name of Italo Svevo is generally associated—Gide, Proust, Musil, Kafka, Joyce—were dedicated to linguistic and/or technical experimentation. Like Svevo they are primarily concerned with self analysis, directing the focus of their vision toward the inner depths of the personality, populated by monsters and mediators. Whether in 1 Lacan's works are collected in Écrits (Paris: Seuil, 1966).

Lévi-Strauss distinguishes between the preconscious as an aspect of memory, "a reservoir of recollections and images amassed in the course of a lifetime," and the unconscious which "is reducible to a function—the symbolic function, which no doubt is specifically human, and which is carried out according to the same laws among all men, and actually corresponds to the aggregate of those laws. . . . We might say, therefore, that the preconscious is the individual lexicon where each of us accumulates the vocabulary of his personal history, but that this vocabulary becomes significant, for us and for others, only to the extent that the unconscious structures it according to its laws and thus trans forms it into language." •The dependence of all psychic phenomena on linguistic structures and symbolism is nowhere so evident as in The Interpretation of Dreams and in the Psychopathology of Everyday Life. 92 MODERN FICTION STUDIES</page><page sequence="3">the form of journal intime, portrait, confessions, their works are anti heroic narratives of the self. Interpreting a South American incantation to facilitate difficult childbirth, Lévi-Strauss states that the shaman's cure consists "in mak ing explicit a situation originally existing on the emotional level and in rendering acceptable to the mind pains which the body refuses to tolerate" by provoking an experience "through symbols, that is, through meaningful equivalents of things meant which belong to another order of reality."4 This very process and its cathartic intent are also one of the raisons d'être of the novel of the self, in which the communion of writer and reader—achieved through stylistic means such as interior monologue, erlebte Rede, etc.—must be total. The symbolic descent-ascent of the primitive song, on which are pat terned myths and folktales and (formidable, awe-inducing realization) even highly sophisticated literary works like The Divine Comedy, is also present in the journey into the self or modern narrative, with the author as both sick person and shaman, suffering and exorcizing exis tential pain by evoking—creating through language—the hidden geography of the psyche. As the spirits must be able to win and "come out in the open," the shaman—who at one point magically transmutes himself into the object symbolized by the spirits—must exist initially and finally outside the incantation, for he is the one who has the power to heal. This is why René Girard says that every novelistic conclusion is a conversion and a memory—a Past Recap tured. "The novelist can write his novel only if he recognizes that his mediator is a person like himself. . . . The novelist recognizes that he is guilty of the sin of which he is accusing his mediator. The curse which Oedipus hurls at Others falls on his own head."8 There is a wisdom in the author at the conclusion of his novel, a wisdom which may or may not be shared by the hero: "The hero succumbs as he achieves truth and he entrusts his creator with the heritage of his clairvoyance."6 Girard's statements as well as the previous ones constitute the premise of a possible and valid approach to Svevo's major fiction— the three novels he wrote over a period of three decades, with twenty 4 Structural Anthropology, p. 193, 196. "The effectiveness of symbols would consist precisely in this 'inductive property,' by which formally homologous structures, built out of different materials at different levels of life—organic processes, unconscious mind, rational thought—are related to one another. Poetic metaphor provides a familiar example of this inductive process, but as a rule it does not transcend the unconscious level. Thus we note the significance of Rimbaud's intuition that metaphor can change the world" (p. 197). 5Deceit, Desire, and the Novel (Baltimore, Maryland: The Johns Hopkins Press, 1965), p. 299. 4 Deceit, Desire, and the Novel, p. 296. DISCOURSE AND THE CONQUEST 93</page><page sequence="4">five years between the first two, rather traditional in their pouring of autobiographical material into naturalistic and psychological molds, and the third, greatly innovative and totally self-referential.7 In this essay, I intend to show how Svevo's unity of vision, which makes of his novels a Dantesque pilgrimage through the three kingdoms of the psyche, focuses itself on human desire and the conquest of it through symbolic discourse. II The great writers have never written more than a single work, or rather they have refracted across diverse milieus that unique beauty which they bring into the world. (A la recherche du temps perdu) As it has often been pointed out, Svevo's heroes are not only "brothers" to each other, as he himself stated, but actually three images or "successive incarnations" of the same psychological sub stance. Yet it is certainly legitimate to speak, as many have done, of the "progress of the hero." There is indeed in Svevo a most char acteristic pattern of sameness and difference on which stands the entire construction of his great single work. The three novels deal with the same human experiences (unrequited love, struggle with a master figure, disease, death) which are organized around and in rela tion to the hero through whose consciousness events and characters are perceived, though only Zeno is a first-person narrator. The basic roles and protagonists of each novel are four, two male and two female: the Hero, the Antagonist (rival and father figure), the Woman (object of the hero's love), and the Victim (the hero's mother or sister). All the other characters in each novel are, so to speak, dramatic metaphors or hyponymic representations of one or the other of the four major roles. For example, in Confessions, the various "actors" who stand in opposition to the hero by virtue of their authority over him (the father, the father-in-law, the estate admin istrator, the fifteen doctors, and particularly the psychoanalyst who publishes Zeno's memoirs, Dr. S.) are father images, hence functionally related to the Antagonist of whom they represent one or more traits. All the female characters fall into either the category of Victim (of 'The novels and their respective English translations, from which I quote, are Una vita (1892)—A Life, trans. Archibald Colquhoun (New York: Knopf, 196S): Seniliti (1898)— As a Man Grows Older, trans. Beryl de Zoete (New York: Bantam, 1968); La coscienza di Zeno &lt;1923)—Confessions of Zeno, trans.

The basic actantial structure, or pattern of character relations, is thus clearly oedipal with the Woman element representing the Hero's attempt to achieve mature object choice. Although Confessions is the only novel to avow openly (through its diary form and psychoanalytical frame) its the matic concern with oedipal guilt and its semantic affiliation to the mythical quest for manhood, the previous novels contain an identical actantial structure and thematic development. Each novel proposes a different combination of the six basic rela tions between the four roles, focusing on the hero as the center of the tangle, with a different temporal and narrative perspective in each one. The life of Alfonso Nitti (in A Life) is presented within a temporal span of about one year. The events of the novel cover, in concentrated form, all the phases of the life of a man in Alfonso's social and historical condition: the entrance into the adult world of work, love, marriage (virtual, but still existentially lived), subsequent increased interest in career, the weakening of enthusiasm, gradual withdrawal from active life, and death. His suicide, the logical though obscurely motivated conclusion of the novel, is not romantic or nihilistic rebellion, but acquiescence and acceptance of death. Alfonso is twenty years old, yet in the space of the novel his life also reaches, we feel, its pathetically logical conclusion. For Emilio Brentani, in As a Man Grows Older, the same social aspects of middle-class life, family, work, and love coexist, but they are examined synchronically within the thematic framework of his love experience. While A Life contains the hero's chronological time in the highest concentration, Emilio's inner time, or duration, is brought to a maximum of dila tion. Their time, however, is essentially the same, as we discover reading the third novel, where chronological time is stretched over the whole of Zeno's life (he begins his account at age fifty-seven and scrupulously covers every period of his life) but in reverse—it is time remembered. Thus, all three novels utilize and investigate a specific human reality, a content, by means of the distortion (contraction or expansion) of external and inner time.8 •"Content is already concrete, in that it is essentially social and historical experi ence. . . . Thus, the process of criticism is not so much an interpretation of content as it is a revealing of it, a laying bare, a restoration of the original message, the original experience, beneath the distortion of the censor; and this revelation takes the form of an explanation why the content was so distorted; it is inseparable from a description of the mechanism of censorship itself." [Fredric Jameson, "Metacommentary," PMLA, 86 (January 1971), 16.] DISCOURSE AND THE CONQUEST 95</page><page sequence="6">Given the preponderance of autobiographical material in all three novels (whence the necessity of distortion), the constant and central presence of oedipal figures and situations as well as the thematic texture and imagery, it seems reasonable, to say the least, to assume that the distortion is analogically related to that which operates in the dream work and which Freud designates by the terms condensa tion and displacement.9 That is to say, in giving expressions to mate rial deriving from personal experience and reaching deep into emo tional sources, the writer is like a dreamer who allows the unconscious material to well up and find verbal expression according to the ways and symbols of the dreamwork. His words are then those of the Other speaking through the voice (the moi is Lacan's term) of the subject (the narrator or narrating consciousness). Before proceeding to examine the mechanism of distortion, i.e., discourse, in the works themselves, I must first say that the exact extent of Freud's influence upon the Triestine writer is perhaps impossible to assess,10 for one never really knows how much in a writer is conscious style and how much is unconscious expression—especially for one who like Svevo consistently covers his tracks. It is a fact that Svevo became ac quainted with the works of Freud around 1910, after his first two novels were written and tucked away, clothed in the utter silence of contemporary literary criticism. And the recurrence in those works of all the "Freudian" motifs later to be included in Zeno's Confes sions only confirms Freud's claim that Sophocles and Shakespeare had conceived Oedipus before he did, and more important here, it indi cates that Svevo had done so as well. One of the most diffuse motifs of Svevo's fiction, attaining cosmic proportions as an overall metaphor for existence, is disease. Through out Svevo's novels, disease is a protean, ambiguous but constant pres ence. In all its manifestations (physical, mental, psychosomatic; real, imaginary, malaise or mal du siècle; curable and incurable; individual and cosmic), it covers the whole span of human existence from birth to death inclusive. Disease appears to be always related, in a two-way causal connection, to the motifs of guilt and death with which it forms one of the two major thematic networks, or réseaux, in dia lectical interaction throughout the three novels. The other réseau is constituted by the motifs of dream, expression, and artistic (literary) creation. The interplay of the first group, which I will analyze first, •This assumption is confirmed by Svevo himself when he overtly encodes his third novel in the symbolic language of the unconscious, the metalanguage of dreams, as I have attempted to show in my article "Dreams as Metalanguage in Svevo's Confessions of Zeno," Language and Style, 4 (Summer 1971), 208-220. 10 A good attempt is Michel David's La psicoanalisi nella cultura italiana (Torino: Boringhieri, 1966), pp. 379-394. 96 MODERN FICTION STUDIES</page><page sequence="7">has as its nucleus the death situation. In each novel there is at least one major section dedicated to the death of a parent or parental image. In the first it is the mother's (Ch. XVI), in the second the sister's (Ch. XII-XIII), and in the third the father's (Ch. II). Despite the fact that the clinical causes differ (respectively, heart disease, pneumonia, and cerebral hemorrhage), the external manifestations of the agony and death remain extraordinarily constant. Always pre ceded or accompanied by delirium, they occur at night, during a rain storm or windstorm, and in the presence of the hero whose feelings at the moment are invariably guilt and self-pity. The patient's chart registers three phases: violent outbreak (delirium, loss of conscious ness), brief temporary improvement (return of consciousness, desire for food and/or movement to an armchair), and death, of which the patient is momentarily and frightfully aware. A most important ob ject is the window which the invalid, in his struggle for air, constantly demands open and which, naturally, must remain closed because of his very presence in the room. Highly emphasized by constant repeti tion within each novel, the struggle for air and difficulty in breathing are not so much objective data to be observed in any dying person as they are a specific sign of Svevo's system, linguistically and sym bolically linked with the windstorm (both the blowing of the wind and a frequent, rapid breathing are commonly denoted with the same verb soffiare [to blow], or by the verbs spirare [to blow] and respirare [to breathe], where spirare also means to die), and with common usage expressions such as "to breathe freely," "a breath of hope," "fear cut his breath short," which are often found throughout the novels. The Freudian interpretation of respiratory disorders (nervous coughing, aphonia, asthma, etc.) as neurotic symptoms seems partic ularly suited to such narrative context and is corroborated in Svevo by numerous references to pure, clean, or fresh air, breathing, pant ing, gasping, and the like, whose metaphoric nature is especially evi dent in the first novel. In A Life, pure, "undefiled" country air is identified with home, childhood, and secure existence within the family; opposed to it is the thick smoke, fog or smog of the industrial city, the place of cor ruption and hardship, where the young hero is to begin his adult life of work and manhood. This contrast, which extends all the way to Zeno's "unhealthy" cigarette smoking, is emphatically stated at the opening of the novel in a longing letter written by Alfonso to his mother in the country. He later describes homesickness as "an or ganic illness, because the lungs suffered from change of air, the stomach from change of food, the feet from change to pavements" (L, p. 136). Shortly after his arrival in Trieste, Alfonso falls ill: "an DISCOURSE AND THE CONQUEST 97</page><page sequence="8">abnormal restlessness he sometimes noticed in himself must come from the fact that his muscles and lungs were insisting on exercise and pure air" (L, pp. 87-88). A sedentary clerical job and self-im posed chastity (he spends his free time at the library serving an alleged aspiration to literary success that is obviously an imperfect form of sublimation) force him to seek physical exercise with the conviction that it will bring back his health. The description of Alfonso's outing has the accelerating rhythm of a sexual act: He crossed a wide avenue on the other side and at last felt bare earth beneath his feet, live grass giving to his weight. Already tired and panting, he flung himself on the ground. He was in a copse of young trees with slim trunks, with tufty tops murmuring in the morning breeze. This sound merged with the mutter of water trickling into a pool, near a low white house only a few steps away. Again he was seized with a desire to run, a yearning to get a long way off. As he climbed, the trees became thicker and stronger. Here and there bushes held him up, and he forced his way with febrile impatience, without the strong man's calm step. He crossed another road and strode through another copse, still climb ing aimlessly. The blood was churning in his head and his breath was failing, but this only stopped him for very short halts. Exhaustion only overwhelmed him when he came up against a high wall blocking his way. He had climbed for less than an hour before flinging himself on the ground exhausted; it seemed a well deserved rest. For a minute or two he was ' terrified by a violent beating in his heart and temples. (L, p. 90) The whole passage, with its symbolic movement (climbing, forcing his way through the vegetation, quick breathing, heart beat), symbolic objects ("live grass" yielding under him, trees progressively increasing in size, copses, water trickling into a pool, high wall), and conclusive deep breathing and peaceful sleep on dry ground, is a simulation of sexual intercourse. It sets forth certain associations to be encountered again and again in this and the other works: smoke and polluted air, affecting the lungs, are conducive of weakness and disease. The phenomena accompanying disease, such as difficult breathing, panting or struggling for air, are suggestive of the violence of the sexual act perceived as frightful and destructive; they appear to be linked to windstorm, rain, waves, etc.—air or water in motion. On the other hand, pure air, clear sky, and still water (the absence of all move ment), allowing deep regular breathing, are associated with childhood and security. But the peaceful sleep following the orgasm is also associated with death (he enjoys seeing the green smiling field around him "as if it were his own and would one day be his home"—and later has a vision of a "green, sunny cemetery"). The cycle is thus complete, yielding no other alternative than death. In the novel, death is the terminal point of both regression and progression, the 98 MODERN FICTION STUDIES</page><page sequence="9">former dramatized by the death of the mother, the latter by the hero's. What forces Alfonso to the seemingly inexplicable suicide that concludes A Life is the prevalence of the death instinct as re vealed in the metaphoric texture through the polarity movement/ab sence of movement.11 The paradigm storm-sexuality-death is more clearly presented in the episode of the sister's death in As a Man Grows Older. Amalia's intoxication with ether, the decisive factor in her inability to fight off pneumonia, is the direct consequence of loneliness and frustration. The trajectory of her delirious hallucinations reflects symbolically the various stages of female sexual life from fear of sex (the "horrible creatures" she imagines crawling on her legs—M, pp. 182, 184) to masturbation (obsession with dirt—M, pp. 185-186), intercourse (dreams of wedding day—M, p. 201), and childbirth (visions of chil dren dancing in the sunshine—M, p. 224). The parallel between the end of Emilio's affair and the end of Amalia's struggle for breath and life, made more relevant by the two characters' similarity and com plementarity all through the novel, is mediated by atmospheric phe nomena. On his way to meet his mistress for the last time, Emilio stops on the waterfront amidst "the tremendous clamor of the sea, joined to the howling of the wind," watching the sailors "working in darkness and danger up aloft on the masts which were keeping up their ritual dance toward all the four winds in turn" (M, p. 208). He instinctively compares the scene to his own life. In that tumult of the waves, where each transmitted to the other the movement which had roused it from its own inertia, where each in turn strove to rise from its place only to fall again into a horizontal position, he read the impassivity of fate. No one was to blame for all the vast destruction. (M, p. 208) And when he meets Angiolina, "the weather had changed, and now a cold, continuous wind was blowing; there was no longer any struggle in the air" (M, p. 209).12 Then, as he returns home, he imagines Amalia "dead, at rest, freed from all her pain and delirium" (M, p. 11 This Svevian intuition of what, years after, Freud called "the conservative nature of living substance," is confirmed by the theory of Beyond the Pleasure Principle (New York, 1959), pp. 107-108: "The pleasure principle, then, is a tendency operating in the service of a function whose business it is to free the mental apparatus entirely from excitation or to keep the amount of excitation in it constant or to keep it as low as possible. . . . The function thus described would be concerned with the most universal endeavor of all liv ing substance—namely to return to the quiescence of the inorganic world. We have all experienced how the greatest pleasure attainable by us, that of the sexual act, ii asso ciated with a momentary extinction of a highly intensified excitation. The binding of an instinctual impulse would be a preliminary function designed to prepare the excita tion for its final elimination in the pleasure of discharge." uThe original reading is "non dero pill alcuma lotta." I have taken the liberty to substitute "struggle" for "warmth" (?) in Beryl de Zoete's translation. DISCOURSE AND THE CONQUEST 99</page><page sequence="10">216).13 The equation of storm, sex, and illness stands on the com mon element of violence ("struggle") dramatized by the no longer gusty but steady, inexorable wind that carries along the pebbles in anely hurled by Emilio against Angiolina, his desire, and Amalia's life. However modified, the storm at sea sequence exists in A Life as a short trip on a cutter and as an overnight fishing expedition in Confessions. In both these cases the hero is in the company of the character who fills the role of Rival, and the episode capitalizes on the opposition, the hero's inferiority, and the male struggle whose semantic content is manhood. Again, the wind blowing in the sails and the movement of and on the water constitute the figurative back ground of a confrontation which, because of the actantial syncretism in the novels, and through displacement, is perceived to be oedipal.14 The connection between oedipal antagonist and disease is most evi dent in the figure of Basedow (one of Svevo's most consciously man ufactured symbols), but also the disease killing Alfonso's mother is actually seen in anthropomorphic terms: That long day of new sufferings, the feeling of his own vast impotence, revealed surprising things that he had not known existed. The disease overwhelming his mother's wretched organism seemed now to be taking on an existence of his own. He had seen it strike at intervals, deride all efforts made against it, then struggle with someone who it knew could not escape, grant illusory truces, now, finally, kill. (L, p. 296) The intermittent, accelerating rhythm of the disease, whose tempo rary cessation is nothing but a pause granted to the victim's vain struggle, is also the rhythm of the wind blowing in gusts, then con tinuous, mounting and conquering, in the episode of Amalia's death; and it is the rhythm of Alfonso's excursion on the body of Mother Earth. In the first two books, disease is consistently perceived as an all-powerful, domineering, destructive male force subjugating its victim (who both times is a woman and a mother figure) and underscoring the hero's weakness and powerlessness to defend her—whence his feel ings of guilt toward her. The hero's self-pity stems from his identi fication with the victim whose feminine gentleness, idealism, and 13 Again, the original "affanno" denotes pain caused by troubled breathing. 14 By virtue of the character interrelations in the structure of the work, the males in functional opposition to the hero have the role either of rivals, if young, or of father substitutes, if old. Only in As a Man Grows Older are the two roles syncretized in one actor, or character (Balli), who is at once competitor in love, friend, and paternal to Emilio. But the conflicting emotional ingredients that concur in defining Svevo's par ticular version of the master-slave relationship (respect/resentment, admiration/envy, af fection/hostility, death-wish, and guilt) are of clearly oedipal nature and apply to both rival and father figures. 100 MODERN FICTION STUDIES</page><page sequence="11">asexual tenderness ate essential traits of his own tempérament. In Confessions, however, disease is subjected to rational inquiry—as in dicated by the psychoanalytic frame of the novel—and, therefore, directly connected with the reality principle, which is indeed the main agent in Zeno's compromising, sensible, and very "realistic" be havior. The preponderance of wind and water imagery in the first two novels corresponds to the apprehension of life as an obscure irrational instinctual force (young Svevo admitted to be strongly influenced by the reading of Schopenhauer) whose ambivalence is dictated by the contemporary presence of what Freud calls the life and death instincts. The motif of disease, recurrent in the three novels and unusually concentrated in Confessions, is a dynamic one. Presented in the first two as the objective correlative of the conflict between the sexual instincts and the moral censor (coscienza, con science), it is eventually exorcised in the third by the action of the reality principle, the ego. To cure himself of his cigarette-smoking habit, the most symptomatic and allusive of his idiosyncrasies (his countless "diseases" are all neurotic symptoms), Zeno tries to impose order to his life by recording it on paper. Willfully bringing up the repressed material, and writing it down, he acquires the self-knowl edge and self-acceptance which, in the beautifully ambiguous word of the Italian title, is referred to as La coscienza (in this case, conscious ness) di Zeno. As the oedipal nature of his guilt, leading to symptom formation, becomes known to him, Zeno is able to reach the correct interpreta tion of disease: Life is a little like disease, with its crises and periods of quiescence, its daily improvements and setbacks. But unlike other diseases, life is always mortal. It admits of no cure: It would be like trying to stop up the holes in our body, thinking them to be wounds. We should die of suffocation almost before we were cured. (C, p. 397) Disease is like life, Zeno is saying, and conversely life is a kind of disease ("But unlike other diseases . . ."), but one that admits of no cure. The holes in our body are necessary and vital outlets. If we perceive them as wounds and try to heal them, we suffocate. Yet, even if we allow them to stay open, we will die. The disease of life cannot be cured. I will not insist on the heavy sexual symbolism of Zeno's simile (closing the holes as repression of the sexual instincts; perceiv ing them as wounds, as the result of acts of violence) or on the connota tions built into the word "suffocation" through the motif of breathing and related semantic associations, which I have previously discussed. (However, I perhaps ought to quote the paragraph immediately fol lowing where Zeno himself makes sure we do not miss the connec D1SCOURSE AND THE CONQUEST 101</page><page sequence="12">tion: "Our life today is poisoned to the root. . . . Who will be able then to cure us of the lack of air and space? The mere thought of it suffocates me"—C, p. 397). If we extend Zeno's speculation to one particular disease, neurosis, the equation appears with greater clarity: neurotic disease is not just "like life," it is properly the disease of life, the existential pain, "pain and love—the whole of life," (C, p. 396) ending in death. Thus we finally realize that for Zeno (and for Svevo) disease is really nothing other than desire, the gaping void within man, the lack of Being, the "immoto andare" of Montale's Arseniothe sickness unto death. Unlike the two previous heroes, Zeno discovers the presence of death in his life at an early age. The unconsciously-wished-for death of his father, which forces him to identify with the male figure and, notwithstanding his defeats, pains, and complaints, allows him to reach the respectable age of fifty-seven with a more than adequate personal and public success in life, also brings down on him the awareness and expectancy of his own death: Zeno's illness is "the fear of death" (C. p. 145), and it is only contracted after the death of his father. . . . Existence for Zeno, until now, has been no more than a definition of himself against his father, in the undifferentiated flux of time which he tries to order by his resolutions. At the old man's bedside, however, he shares his suffering and he is obliged to face the void his father's death will open up.i« In his extraordinary essay on Confessions, based on Lacan's theory of desire as a manque à l'être, Anthony Wilden clarifies the reasons for Zeno's resistance to being "cured": Man's essence is a function of his desire, that is to say, it is dependent upon non realization. The death of Zeno's father leaves him facing a void, because his desire has come to fruition. . . . What all the doctors in the book (including himself) seek to cure him of is, he fears, desire itself. . . . For Zeno health seems to suggest the negation of desire and the negation of the illusions of immortality upon which the Eros depends. 17 Health, says Zeno, "is really only a suspension of movement" (C, p. 287). Health, we understand, is stillness, order, peace, and, therefore, the opposite of desire which is perennial tension, the essence of move ment. It is also the opposite of neurotic disease, of the heavy breath ing required by the (frightful and vital) sexual act, and of the ulti mately absurd tension of life toward death—"the desire of the moth for the star,/Of the night for the morrow."

The latter, he feels, is the conquest of a supernatural order obtained by renouncing meta physical desire and Promethean pride through the phenomenological epoch é which is the novelist's art.18 It is my opinion that the belief in a supernatural order came to Svevo—a convinced agnostic at best— through the reading of Freud. Thus the attainment of such order out of the existential chaos of experience is granted only to the last of his heroes. What is Zeno's compulsive limping if not the curse of the swollen-foot Oedipus, guilty of the murder of his father? And what is fifty-seven-year-old Zeno, the successful business man, the "patriarch" on his way to death, if not the very Other against whom his life-long war has been waged—his own father? Indeed, Zeno has become his own mediator, and the curse hurled by Oedipus at the Others has reverted back to him. And the much-ridiculed psycho analysis of Dr. S. (Silva [nickname of Zeno's father], Sigmund, and/or Svevo?) is the key to decode the message of the novel, which is man's servitude to the Other's desire and his final victory over it in the awareness of Sein zum Tode. III And then Time, for me, is not that unimaginable thing that never stops. For me, but only for me, it comes again. (Confessions of Zeno, p. 11) In recording the story of his life (i.e., of his disease) and of his "cure," Zeno succeeds where Alfonso and Emilio failed—he attains the highest degree of self-expression whose imperfect forms are dreams and autistic fantasy making. Alfonso dies engulfed by paranoid fan tasies; Emilio shuts himself off from reality by living in the totally imaginary world of his "symbol" in fruitless permanent regression. Their efforts at creative writing are defeated by the seemingly over whelming weight of contemporary and lived experience, and even Emilio is never able to write his second novel based on his actual relationship with Angiolina. Only Zeno, in relating from memory the conflicts of his life and unfaithfully rearranging or "inventing" them, produces a true work of fiction, that is to say, interpersonal » Deceit, Desire, and the Novel, pp. 290-300. In speaking of Dostoyevsky, he quotes the verse from St. John found in The Brothers Karamazov: "If the seed does not die after it has been sown, it will remain alone, but if it dies it will bear much fruit." Girard's comment that the verse "expresses the mysterious connections between the two deaths in the novel" (p. SU) is certainly suitable for the two deaths which also open and close Confessions—the father's and the cosmic catastrophe of the world's destruction. DISCOURSE AND THE CONQUEST 103</page><page sequence="14">discourse, or creative expression. Creativity, with its liberating coun terparts (exorcism, self-knowledge, and escape from solipsism), is the nucleus of the second thematic réseau, diametrically and dialectically opposed to death. As John Freccero points out, "all confession, literary or sacramen tal, is either a lie or the record of a conversion, a death and resur rection. Self-knowledge is necessarily death of the self, a descent into Hell, while self-expression in its profoundest sense is necessarily re birth."19 What enables Zeno to return from Hell and be reborn is not World War I (the historical catastrophe) nor the final explo sion that will render the earth to its inorganic purity (the apocalyptic vision with which the diary ends), but the early revelation, which the later catastrophe and vision only magnify, that God the Father is dead and, for his rebellious death-wish, man has been hurled from the Garden of Eden into the abyss towards death. In his anguish, Zeno must repress his original sin, but his symptomatic diseases and obsessive repetition of the crucial Father-Son relationship all testify to the presence of the Other whose discourse they constitute. While the first two novels terminate with death, thus leaving the hero faced with his inexpressible knowledge, for Zeno Death and the Other are in the beginning. In principio erat Verbum. Zeno is sick as he is alive—for his disease is desire. Yet this very disease, which makes the Hero at once fear and seek death, is precisely what urges Zeno to write, sustaining his inquiry and self-expression. By the very act of writing, Zeno sifts experience through the sieve of the unconscious, the categories of discourse. He thus puts himself in the position of the writer who, giving form to the chaos of experience, acquires the distance and the vision necessary to see his writings(s) as the discourse of the Other spoken through his persona. And if Zeno's diary remains an opera aperta (he stops smoking, but for how long?), it is because the conquest of desire is also an open-ended moment in the dialectic process of Being. The cyclical form of the novel, whose end is the condition of its publication, hence its true beginning as discourse for the others, is an indication that "If the seed . . . dies it will bear much fruit." For it is we, the readers, the others, to whom Zeno speaks, who, taking the place of the doctor, must judge and analyze him and rise with him to the admission of guilt and to self-knowledge. One of the most striking things about Confessions, which Wilden first remarked, is how closely its implied, though perhaps involuntary, interpretation of Freud resembles the contemporary one by Jacques Lacan. In opposition to behaviorism and other now-oriented schools ""Zeno's Last Cigarette," Modern Language Notes, 77 (January 1962), 9. 104 MODERN FICTION STUDIES</page><page sequence="15">of psychology, Lacan's return to Freudian analysis is based on the views and methods of structuralism which considers language, and what Lévi-Strauss calls "the symbolic function," as the structuring principle of reality, the code through which all psychic phenomena must be deciphered. Structured like language and existing because of it, the unconscious has, like language, two primary modes of sig nifying, the metaphoric and the métonymie.20 If the (neurotic) symptom has the nature of metaphor, being analogous to that part of the dreamwork which Freud called Verdichtung, or condensation, desire is functionally allied to metonymy, Verschiebung, or displace ment. Both modes are intimately linked with time, the vertical or synchronic time of obsessive repetition of the symptom as metaphor and the linear or diachronic time of métonymie projection of desire onto the Imaginary fantasmes. Restating this in a concrete context, one may say that the symptoms of Zeno's disease (which include and intensify those of the previous versions of the Svevian Hero) are but the unchanging repetition of one and the same (oedipal) moment as indicated by the dream-visions of the last chapter. Even though, like all symtoms, they appear to be externally different and occur at objectively different times throughout his life, they all refer to one particular psychic moment, that which, repressed, reproduces itself over and over through the symptoms. In this sense, the time of the symptom-metaphor is synchronic, i.e., essentially static. For example, Zeno's limping, which becomes most acute in the presence of his rival, is a symptomatic repetition of a moment in his childhood when he developed this handicap on the way to school as a protest against his brother who was allowed to stay at home. The content, oedipal jealousy, remains unchanged throughout the years as if time had not passed. On the other hand, the time of desire is diachronic, for desire invests successively different objects whose métonymie nature is evi denced by their partial similarity to the oedipal roles. The characters of Zeno's diary, modeled on the four actantial roles, are successive, diachronic embodiments of his desire, his Imaginary fantasmes. Thus, for instance, the various women of Zeno's life are all aspects of Womanhood as perceived by the Hero-Subject in its double oedipal composition of Mother (Victim) and Woman (sexual love object). And the same might be said for the male characters distributed in the roles of Father and Rival. Since it is language, with its organizing principles (metaphor and metonymy) that structures our mode of perception much in the same *&gt; Roman Jakobson, "Two Aspects of Language and Two Types of Aphasie Disturb ances" in Fundamentals of Language (Gravenhage: Mouton, 1956), pp. 55-82. DISCOURSE AND THE CONQUEST 105</page><page sequence="16">way in which condensation and displacement in dreams preside over the formal expression (manifest content) of the latent content, lan guage is the key to the psyche—hence the necessity of verbal inter change in therapy, the analyst-patient dialogue. "In order to liberate the Subject's Word, we introduce him into the Language of his desire, that is, into the primary Language in which, beyond what he tells us of himself, he is already talking to us unbeknownst to him, and in the symbols of the symptom."21 The neurotic, says Lacan, is an "empty subject," and his statement is an "empty word" spoken by the Other through him. The avowal of his (unconscious) desire, to ward which the subject is channeled by the analyst, is possible only through symbols which must be interpreted by the analyst. When the symbols are recognized as such by the subject, he understands the "language of his desire," and, by re-living the repressed traumatic experience through the formally homologous structures of symbolic language, he is cured. As he attains the order of the Symbolic, his statement becomes a "full word," following the process outlined by Freud's "Wo es war, soll Ich werden." Does this happen to Zeno? Is he actually cured by psychoanalysis? On a literal level, no. He writes the diary as a preliminary to treat ment. This diary that leads the analyst to the oedipal diagnosis, after which treatment should in effect begin, is the story of Zeno's disease and takes the place of the analysis, whereas the last chapter, entitled "Psychoanalysis," is the story of his cure, i.e., of the treatment. In this chapter, Zeno describes the treatment (which is very soon inter rupted by the patient) in a tongue-in-cheek manner aimed at scorning the doctor. In so doing, however, by his negative transference and by the various "dream-visions" that take him back to childhood, Zeno manages not only to interpret all of his symptoms but also to eluci date for us his total psychological make-up. Thus, his "dream-visions" constitute a set of symbols that supplies us and the doctor with the key to understand the origin of his problems. Zeno does not under stand or pretends not to. Yet, toward the end of the diary, he tells us that he is cured—by his business and by "self-persuasion" (C, p. 396). The difficulty we have in accepting this statement is caused by the strong contradiction between Zeno's exultance at his recovered health and the pessimistic irony of his last vision: "There will be a tremendous explosion, but no one will hear it and the earth will return to its nebulous state and go wandering through the sky, free at last from parasites and disease" (C, p. 398). 21 Jacques Lacan, The Language of the Self, p. 57. 106 MODERN FICTION STUDIES</page><page sequence="17">Is this where Svevo and Freud part company? Does Svevo, who like Zeno is a self-conscious intellectual, deny faith and the possibility of cure? Or is it rather that his profound though non-professional knowledge of the human mind made him anticipate another problem connected with psychoanalysis, namely, the unendingness of the cure? Svevo seems to leave his novel open-ended and certainly complicates matters by making use of an unreliable narrator. But what exactly happens to Zeno and what Svevo's novel really is can be answered if we keep the two entities author and persona (hero-narrator) sep arate. Then we see that if Zeno's manuscript leaves the question unresolved the whole novel does not. And this is because Svevo's text, as a closed, meaning-generating system, reverts to its beginning, forming, as it were, a circle within which its signification is contained. In fact, by the doctor's preface, which introduces the diary but chron ologically comes at the end of it, we are warned that Zeno's confes sions are "truths and falsehoods"—more precisely, they are both true and false. Zeno's words are true inasmuch as, in speaking them, he perceives them to be true.22 They are false because, Zeno being a neurotic, his word is "empty"; as Lacan says—Zeno's voice is the moi through which the Other speaks. His diary is like the account of the manifest content of a dream: it demands and awaits the dreamer's own interpretation. And Zeno does furnish it, under the suggestions of his analyst, by means of his "dream-visions." But Zeno ostensibly refuses to understand the language of his desire and to see the sym bols for what they are, for he knows that to be cured of desire (his disease) is to die, to be no longer alive. Here the importance for the critic of retaining the distinction between Zeno and Svevo becomes vital. However neurotic, Zeno is a fictional character; he is not a patient. He is both the dramatization of Svevo's own neurosis and the representation of the universal man suspended between desire and death, Being and Nothingness. Obviously, then, Zeno cannot and must not be cured. He is himself a symbol, an ambiguous one, set in the larger system of the text. The text is not only Zeno's diary but the record of the dialogue between the hero-narrator (the empty word of the mediated moi) and the analyst, who, acting as his sound ing board, urges him to interpret his own symbols, to reveal his secrets—which he alone can do. The analyst's vengeful attitude, alluding to the difficult problem of countertransference, symbolizes the struggle between the author and his persona ever present in a "•"My anecdotes were for the most part true. I don't quite remember in which part, for I told them [so many times] that without any conscious alteration on my part they constantly suffered slight modifications tending to make them more interesting.

And it is because, at some point, we readers become involved in their dialogue that we even tually attain their complex truth, the full word which is the novel spoken by the Je of the author and existing entirely in the Symbolic order, in formal discourse. Like the preface, Svevo as the author exists before and after Zeno and his diary as the shaman exists outside the incantation. Dis tancing himself from his desire by interposing the created persona with whom he carries on his dialogue and who is at once the Self and the Other, the author acquires his hero's clairvoyance. "The title of hero of a novel must be reserved for the character who triumphs over metaphysical desire in a tragic conclusion and thus becomes capable of writing the novel."23 Zeno writes: When the doctor gets the last part of my manuscript, he will have to give me back the whole. I should be able to write it all over again with absolute certainty now; how was it possible for me to understand my life when I did not know what this last part was going to be? Perhaps I only lived all those years in order to prepare for itl (C, p. 397) Although Zeno does not rewrite his diary, nor does he ever have the epiphany that would have made his diary a confession rather than a lie, Svevo's novel is the one Zeno would have rewritten, the Truth emerging from the fact of knowledge, the formal rearrange ment of experience according to the modes of symbolic discourse, the full word of the conscious Je. The third of Svevo's novels, Confessions, in which the Hero dis covers and retraces his lost time, is also Svevo's Temps retrouvé. The autobiographical elements in the last book are filtered through the two previous novelistic experiences. There is no Ada in Svevo's life, for she is the recasting of Annetta (who does have a biographical counterpart) as Carla is of Angiolina (also modeled after a real person). When Copier dies, Zeno cannot enter the sick man's room because "I had been looked at reproachfully by too many dying peo ple already" (C, p. 198)—and yet, the only person to do so in that novel was his father as all the other deaths come after Copier's. Zeno's reversed time, in other words, is not the time of Svevo's life but that of his fiction. Whereas Alfonso's time is presented mainly as diachronic (the time of métonymie desire) and Emilio's as strictly synchronic (the time of metaphor, of the symptom), Zeno's time con tains them both, for it is the kind that stops but comes again, it is repeatable, re-usable, elastic. Thus, there are two kinds of time in M René Girard, Deceit, Desire, and the Novel, p. 296. Girard's italics. 108 MODERN FICTION STUDIES</page><page sequence="19">Confessions. One is the forward moving yet immobile time of Zeno's (of Elea) paradoxical arrow constituted by discrete and unlinkable moments—and this is the chronological time of the Hero's lived ex perience, the time of desire leading to death. The other is the time that "for me, but only for me" returns, the omnidirectional time of memory, of forward recollection, the spacetime of creation, that be gins with death and is the conquest of metaphysical desire. This, born out of the dialogue between the author and his persona, is what may be called symbolic time, or the time of symbolic desire, which like the symbolic function is achronic, i.e., timeless. Beginning at the end, ending at the beginning, cyclical and self-referential, Confessions is really a disguised account of how the Novel comes about, of the resistance of experience to expression, and of the ruses the author (Zeno-Svevo) must find to overcome this resistance.
