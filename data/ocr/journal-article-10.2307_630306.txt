<plain_text><page sequence="1">SCHNAPP-GOURBEILLON (A.) Lions, heros, masques: les representations de I'animal chez Homere. (Textes a l'appui.) Paris: Maspero. I981. Pp. 221. Fr. 65. This useful book started as a thesis under Pierre Vidal-Naquet, examined by, among others, J.-P. Ver- nant. The English reader will be warned, but should not be put off. The book is indeed, as few are by English scholars, the product of a school-but none the worse for that, and it provides, as does the work of all French structuralists, new and useful insights into the Ancient World, even for those who do not (as perhaps we should) accept the whole intellectual basis of the study. The author is not concerned with the similes as a whole, though she has appreciated (p. 196), as more sentimental critics have not, that the Homeric similes describe 'a society as artificial as idyllic, where each is content with his lot, where the workman works happily for the master, where the shepherd leads the flocks of the nobles, a serene land of soft landscapes and a teeming sea', and not the real world of the post-heroic period, though it may be possible, with caution, to use some of its details as evidence for that period. But our author is concerned with animals as a concept which mediates between the social worlds of men and gods (pp. 195-6), ultimately by sacrifice (there is a useful chapter, pp. 150-5, on the hierarchy of sacrificial victims), but also by analogy, by reflexion, and, in a few sinister cases, by their enshrinement of a masked savagery (note the vase illustrated on the cover, a man, perhaps Dolon, crawling in a wolf-skin, Louvre CA 1802). I may not have fully understood her analysis here, but I am impressed with it, though others may be less willing to follow her in the powerful intellectual rhetoric which has always been one of the strengths of French scholarship. The structuralist opposition between nature and culture (and between gods and men) is naturally and properly present to the author's mind: she rejects the simple suggestion that animal comparisons are a vestige of animism or totemism, or that the animal merely represents wild nature (sauvage-the overtones are untranslatable): she shows that the animal is the analogue, not the opposite, of the aristocratic hero, and that the simile operates in the same sphere where culture meets nature, and where it stresses the harmonious nature of the world of the simile. For the animal keeps man in touch with the more savage side of the divine (a side normally only suggested in the Iliad, but most explicit in the Doloneia, a book important for the author's interpretation). The com- parison of the hero to the lion in particular (but she notes, and links, the two sinister comparisons of warriors to wolves, Iliad xvi 156-63, the Myrmidons, and 352-5, the leaders of the Danaans) indicates his presence at the very limits of the civilized, as he exhibits his heroic role by raids on the cattle of his enemies (the young Nestor proved his manhood in this way in Iliad xi, and Achilles in Iliad ix insists on his role as plunderer, 328-9 and 406-9). Diomede (who plays a part in the Doloneia) is a splendid structuralist hero, and gets a chapter to himself (5. Diomede le lion), which, though less immediately integral to the study of animal similes, is one of the most powerful in the book. Diomede is seen as an ambiguous figure for many reasons: Aetolian among the Argives (xxiii 471-2: he has seemed to me as intrusive in the Catalogue, ii 563-7), as young yet old in warlike esperience and in counsel (pp. 98-Ioo), as savage (Kpa-Epo' is so interpreted, following Benveniste, on p. 92 n. 2) like his father (whose brutality robbed him of immortality when he ate the brains of Melanippus),' as associated with horses (his Thracian homonym pos- sessed man-eating mares),' and as engaging in theo- machy (but only against Trojan gods, and with the approving assistance of Athena). He is thus 'marginal', 'he rides continually on the fragile barrier which separates heroic behaviour from pure savagery' (p. 125), unlike Achilles, whose humanity means that he is 'victim of an intransigent and excessive conception of heroic honour' (p. 87: the phrase seems to be one ofJ.-P. Vernant's, see n. 8: I am pleased to find cited the excellent book ofJ. Redfield, Nature and culture in the Iliad: the tragedy of Hector, Chicago 1975, though it is better, in my view, on death than on tragedy). She sees 1 The bracketed comments are those of the reviewer, and not ofthe author.</page><page sequence="2">194 NOTICES OF BOOKS Diomede as a kind of anti-Achilles (p. 124), and he does in fact play, in the first half of the poem, a similarly predominant role in the fighting, after which, as she notes, he virtually disappears. Traces of the thesis survive in the methodical examination of the Contexte etfigure des he'ros in Chapter 4, preceded by a histogram of non-animal, naturalistic animal, hunt, and lion similes book by book, which might be clearer if the four types were put side by side for each book, and of which more could be made. Lion similes are most common in v, x-xiii and xv-xvii: most interesting is their absence from xxi and xxii. But non-animal similes are remarkably common-but this is not a book about the employment of similes in general. Hunts also get a chapter to themselves (pp. 135-48: the doctoral thesis cited in n. I by Alain Schnapp is by the author's husband), and the lack of'a true semiology of the hunt' is regretted (p. 136). Homeric hunts are seen to have an ideological element, of social links expressed in strongly hierarchical terms. The League against Cruel Sports would agree-and the author is led into some very interesting observations about the Calydonian Boar Hunt and Odysseus' Boar Hunt as a young man, which is very properly seen as initiatory (he gets a name, xix 405) but into his maternal family. One must observe also the role played by his mother's brothers in the story of Meleager: initiatory elements in the Calydonian hunt are noted but not pressed on p. 139 n.5. The analysis of these two hunts is both interesting and important. Traces of the thesis are also to be found in the systematic examination of cattle, dog, horse and birds, pp. 149-90, chapters 7 and 8. When dealing with birds, the author cannot avoid touching on the currently controversial question of 'bird theophanies' (pp. 178-86). 'Formellement' she accepts, as she must, the view ofF. Dirlmeier, Die Vogelgestalt homerischer Goitter, S.H.A.W., 1967, 2, Heidelberg 1967, that such theo- phanies are expressed by the regular vocabulary of comparison, but questions it on two grounds: first, that divine transformations into humans are real; secondly, that the gods only appear as birds, and as no other animal, and she picks up an Indian parallel for the special position of birds, one lost in Greek anthropomorphism. I find her view attractive, but I note that the language of comparison is used in two anomalous cases. In Iliad xxiv 8o Iris descends to find Thetis in the depths of the sea oAvflSat'v~ l qK'Arq, like the weight on a fishing line. This can hardly be anything but a comparison-or can it? When Athena descends to earth in Iliad iv to find Pandarus, her descent is first compared to that of a star sent by Zeus-otov 8'dor1-Epa ... -r iEKi (iv 75-8). Then she enters the Trojan host AdvAp KiE'A7 Tpwi v--the only other such use of K11Ar$ (the E/wNAov of Aeneas at Iliad v 449-50 is a-rw 7r'A vELa LKEAOV KaG rXEULm ro70iov, and Agamemnon at Iliad ii 478-9 is o/t4tLara Ka K q aA)v LYKE AoS id 7Epr7TLKEpaVV', "Ap~i" 4w SLav7)v, aUrpvov SE H-oaUEL&amp;wvL, the latter at least certainly a comparison-however the comparison arose). Athena, then, is transformed into a man (the point made above by our author) and on the evidence of language ioAhvvfa'v) should be a kind of bird--as perhaps it was originally, until glossed by a notably banausic simile ofa fishing rod. Either that, or the anomalous comparison of Iris must be regarded as another 'late' element in a book that seems to be full of them. As that last sentence suggests, there are other approaches to Homer than that of the author, the historicist and analytical congenial to this reviewer, and the literary exemplified in this country, in their two different ways, by Jasper Griffin and his reviewer M. Lynn-George. The author's is one which takes the text as we have it as a text, 'reads' it and makes inferences from it. But no approach is to be rejected a priori that enables us to see things in Homer that we had not seen before, and this book certainly and admirably does that.
