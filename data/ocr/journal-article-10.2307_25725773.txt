<plain_text><page sequence="1">Views ijfr" ^ of Our tMBS^rJ Resders ' ^^S^j^^^ Abolish Bar Examinations? Nashville, Tennessee The article in the December issue (page 1215), "Do Bar Examinations Serve a Useful Purpose?", by Edward F. Bell, was hardly worthy of your publica tion. The author reasons that (1) a cer tain number of blacks pass law school examinations and are awarded a degree; (2) these same blacks fail state bar examinations; (3) therefore these blacks are discriminated against by racist bar examiners and thus bar examinations should be eliminated. . . . Across the country blacks are admitted to law schools under relaxed or at least different standards than whites. The proc ess of relaxing standards for blacks may well continue in many cases throughout law school, even as an unconscious proc ess. This might explain the fact that many blacks graduate from law school but then fail bar examinations. While there may be some good reasons for eliminating or changing state bar examinations, I do not believe the author proved his case. At some point blacks must meet standards applicable to every one. The author's solution is to elimi nate the standards. A better approach to dealing with the problem of racial dis crimination in the administration of bar examinations would be to adopt proce dures to assure that the examiner has no knowledge of the identity or race of the individual whose paper he is grading until after the paper has been graded and the grade is irrevocably recorded in the records of the board of bar examin ers. James T. O'Hare Statements intended for publication not exceeding 300 words are most suitable for inclusion in this depart ment. The Board of Editors reserves to itself the right to select the com munications or excerpts therefrom that it will publish and to reject others. The Board is not responsible for mat ters stated or views expressed in any communication. Miami, Florida I enthusiastically agree with Judge Bell's conclusion that the bar examina tion ought to be abolished. Certainly if there is any likelihood at all that the ex amination is being used to deny access to the profession by reason of race, that is sufficient reason to end it. . . . The principal reason generally given in support of requiring all candidates for admission to the Bar to take and pass an examination is that it is necessary to protect the public from incompetents who might otherwise enter the practice. This can be called the ostensible end of the bar examination. It is a pious fraud for many reasons. 1. A goodly number of incompetents manage to gain admission to the Bar anyway. . . . 2. No matter how comprehensive the examination, it cannot encompass the full range of knowledge or skill that comprises the total practice of the legal profession. . . . 3. At best the bar exam protects against incompetence that exists at the moment of its taking. It does not in any way protect against the far greater danger of incompetence subsequently achieved. . . . Today there is nothing except conscience to stop the long-time automobile defense attorney from writ ing a complex estate plan or the tax attorney from trying a first-degree murder case. . . . Why then should the neophyte have to take a bar examina tion and the veteran not? Perhaps it is because the veterans run things and the neophytes don't. As a first step. Judge Bell's proposal that graduates of accredited law schools be automatically admitted to the bar of the state in which the law school is lo cated is a good one. Unfortunately, this would not help those who upon gradua tion might wish to practice in another state. Black graduates, the bulk of whom attend only a relatively few schools, would be disproportionately inconveni enced by the narrowness of this proposal. Far better would be a situation whereby graduation automatically entitled a young lawyer to practice in any state so long as he registered with and became a member of the bar of that state. . . . Joseph C. Segor Croton-on-Hudson, New York It is conceivable that racial discrimina tion exists in connection with bar exami nations, but it is inconceivable that this fact alone accounts for the poor perform ance of minority group law students. . . . Judge Bell is being naive and short sighted in blaming the allegedly discrim inatory administration of bar examina tions for the poor results of minority group members. The true culprits are the horribly inadequate educational back ground that the black student brings with him to college and law school and the misguided attempts by colleges and law schools to compensate for wasted years in grade schools. The way to open the legal profession to more minority group members is not the elimination of bar examinations, but rather a great improvement in the educa tional facilities available. This way, the black students can pass or fail those worthless bar examinations on the same footing as their white classmates. Philip M. Perlah Madison, Wisconsin . . . The pressure to admit poorly qual ified students from minority groups [to law schools] ensures their continuance and ultimate graduation despite doubt ful attainment of professional compe tence. . . . Is there any answer to the problem? I have one which is at least intellectually honest. Why not grant licenses to mem bers of minority groups who have gradu ated from accredited law schools while holding all other graduates to the pres ent standards? This would do away with the system of assigning numbers to ap (Continued on page 228) 224 American Bar Association Journal</page><page sequence="2">Views of Our Readers [LAWYER'S DAY I WON'T LET YOU FORGET J^^H ^ ^^jl^^^ *&gt; ^^^m!^ ^^^^^^^ ^ 1 i ^^^j^j^Jjj^^ ^ ^^^^^^ INCREASE BILLINGS I FREE 60-DAY TRIAL The functionalized desk diary designed by I Send for Lawyer's Day ? 14 months a lawyer for lawyers.

Would this be con stitutional? Why not? If a state uni versity may admit and graduate an un qualified student because he is a member of a so-called disadvantaged group, while denying admission to qualified applicants from other groups, why can't the state give the unqualified applicant a li cense? . . . While my suggestion may occasion some misgivings so far as the elimination of second-class citizenship is concerned, it would at least eradicate a lot of hy pocrisy and racist name-calling which seems to be developing into a modern day type of McCarthyism. Instead of call ing a man a Communist, you seek to de stroy him by calling him a racist whether because he is a member of an examining board that has found certain applicants to be unqualified, or whether he has merely moved out of a neighborhood be cause of its declining property values and increase in crime. . . . Warren H. Resh Harbor City, California . . . [Judge Bell] seems to miss the discrimination inherent in the very scheme he proposes, that of admitting to the Bar on graduation from an approved law school. I assume by the use of the word "approved" that the judge meant to exclude nonaccredited law schools, whose graduates would be required to take the traditional bar exam, which now is taken by accredited and nonaccredited alike. Such a proposal was made in Cali fornia, and it was realized that this would only give the organized bar a means of discriminating against graduates of the unaccredited schools who, under the pres ent scheme, have a disturbing habit of passing the bar exam. When it is rea lized that it is the unaccredited school that forms the major route by which blacks and Mexican Americans enter into the legal field, it seems clear that adop tion of Judge Bell's proposal would pro duce a heightening of the very discrim ination to which he objects. The answer to having more black lawyers does not rest with abolition of bar examinations, but with more recruitment of black law students and better legal education, per haps of a compensatory nature, to en able them to pass the examination, en suring that the bar exam itself is divorced of all means of discrimination. . . . Carl B. Pearlston, Jr. San Francisco, California Support for Judge Bell's . . . position ... is, perhaps, best illustrated by minor ity experiences in California, a state with a clearly nondiscriminatory examination procedure developed and supervised by a highly capable, honest and efficient committee of bar examiners. The only effect, albeit not the purpose, of the present California bar exam is to exclude minority students and others too poor to take the exam continually. Virtu ally every graduate (98 per cent) of an accredited California law school eventu ally passes the exam if he or she is finan cially able to take it repeatedly. . . . It is estimated that the expense of pre paring for bar exams and the loss of wages until one becomes a member of the Bar costs each graduating class in the State of California a minimum of $5 mil lion per year. The group that suffers most from the delay and earnings loss is, of course, the poor, and the largest percent age of the poor are minorities. Moreover, this group is least likely to be able to afford to take the exam repeatedly and has a disproportionately high initial fail rate. The result is that a quarter of Cali fornia's population continues virtually to be unrepresented in the legal profes sion. That is, less than 3 per cent of Cal ifornia's attorneys are black or Chicano as opposed to 24 per cent of the popu lation. (There is, for example one Anglo attorney per 500 Anglos as opposed to only one Chicano attorney per 15,000 Chicanos.) In light of the 98 per cent eventual passage rate for Anglos, the admission without exam of 367 lawyers solely be cause they served in World War II, and the senseless loss of several million dol lars annually in potential professional earnings, one wonders just what purpose is served by bar exams, particularly when the California exam is seen as the best in the nation.

Sec ond, the extensive review which most stu dents undertake immediately prior to a bar examination is a major educational assist in integrating, filling gaps and fus ing a student's basic knowledge of law. Judge Bell complains, "At best [a bar] examination is a memory test." Maybe so, but who can deny that an adequate memory is essential for a competent law yer? Plato said it best, "All knowledge is but remembering." Richard N. Servaas Morris, Illinois . . . [Judge Bell's] excellent analysis should stimulate action for changing the testing and selection process for lawyers. The law schools have defaulted from taking the initiative for abolishing or correcting the unfairness of bar exami nations. The American Bar Association should assume the leadership for neces sary reform. . . . August B. Black, Member Illinois State Bar Association Committee on Legal Education and Admission to the Bar Apology Due Glendale, California An appopriate response to the casti gators of Mr. Jaworski (Views of Our Readers, December issue, page 1158) appears as a resolution by the Legal Rights and Justice Task Force of the White House Conference on Youth. Sec tion 7.10b asserts: We recommend that State Boards of education require young people to take a professionally designed course or series of courses on youth and the law, including the role of the police, courts and correctional systems. . . . Because we, as youth, feel that we are not adequately informed with re gard to the impact of the legal system, we recommend that the Attorney Gen eral of the United States and the indi vidual attorneys general of each state initiate and undertake to make avail able to youth on the local level in formation and explanations of pro grams, policies, and the impact of the legal system, particularly the criminal law, on youth. It is to be stressed that implementation of these programs should be oriented to fit into every local school system in the country. Such programs should include the use of persons responsible in the applica tion and theory of law and legal rights; e.g., judges at all levels, prosecutors, defense attorneys, law students, police, law professors, offenders, etc. . . . Perhaps apologies are due Mr. Jawor ski. And commendation for his most worthwhile effort positively to respond to the foregoing plea. John L. Harmer Where Fault Lies Oxnard, California I read with great interest Morris L. Ernst's letter regarding law in edu cation (December issue, page 1158). I am happy to know about Mr. Ernst's deep concern for the need of practical education in law which I think should be given to all seniors of high schools and to all seniors in college. While many students and graduates are blamed for breaking a law, the real basic fault lies with the school or the college that failed to give them a more complete educa tion. . . .

Philadelphia, Pennsylvania Mr. Frank in describing the late Mr. Justice Black (January issue, page 21) as "forceful in debate, relentlessly dili gent and instantly perceptive" describes a great man. So does Professor Keeffe warm us to him who "wore no man's col lar and spoke his own mind to the last" (January issue, page 63). De mortuis nil nisi bonum. Did either, however, describe a judge? It may be, as Professor Keeffe says, that the "Warren Court" should be dubbed the "Black Court". It is simply wrong that the United States Supreme Court or any court in the United States should have an anthropomorphic label. It is simply out of place in the common law heritage that a court or judge ex press a decision not based on the accepted custom of the people or the statutes of its assemblies. It seems inescapable that if Hugo Black had risen to eminence (and he would have, in any event) via the route of inherited wealth and corporate prac tice, his forcefulness and brilliance would have been directed to entirely dif ferent ends. In terms of the judicial sphere in the American system of gov ernment, the result would have been no less odious. The judicial task is to serve as the balance between the legislative and executive spheres. Each sphere in practice must overlap, but each must, if our admirable system is to survive, be as diligent, as Justice Black was in all else, to keep overlapping to the minimum. It was the great fault of Mr. Justice Black and many of his brethren that the Court plunged recklessly into both other spheres in willful disregard of the ac cepted tradition that it is only the duty of the courts to prescribe in a given set of facts what the law is?not what it was, not what it ought to be and, em phatically, not what it should be in every similar case (set of facts). It was down right arrogant of the Court to assume that practicing lawyers could not deduce the law in similar circumstances and even (Continued on page 240) 232 American Bar Association Journal</page><page sequence="5">Views of Our Readers PERENNIAL PROBLEMS?

The maelstrom has yet to come in the criminal law-individual right area. John A. McMenamin Decatur, Illinois Despite the assertion in the title of John P. Frank's flattering article on Hugo Black that, "He Has Joined the Giants", and despite the many other out pourings of extravagant praise lavished upon the memory of Justice Black, many Americans will dissent from the view that Black was one of the great Justices of our Supreme Court. . . . Justice Black was not truly a "judge" as that term is normally applied. He was in reality a very skilled, diligent, hard working legislator who, by single-minded purpose, and joined by some similarly in clined appointees to the Court, proceeded to attempt to force the Court into the role of a super Congress, admittedly with some considerable success over the years. . . . Taking the long view, I suspect that when later generations look back at the results brought about by the opinions he helped shape and the new directions in constitutional law he pushed for, the view will be taken that the country is no better off for his efforts, and in fact it may some day be seen that he was the initiator of trends within the law which will ultimately bring down the wrath of the executive and legislative departments upon the judiciary in an effort to cause it to retreat back into its once accepted role as an equal in the balance of pow ers scheme of things, not as the self appointed oligarchy it has become? largely through Black's efforts. John E. Fick Naugatuck, Connecticut . . . While I was a student at Colum bus School of Law at the Catholic Uni versity of America, I was privileged to participate in one of the Keeffe-planned meetings with Justice Black.

Many readers, particularly those who enjoy history in perspective, will recall that Copley was the son of the historical painter of the same name (John Single ton Copley, 1738-1815) whose works are to be found in collections like the Na tional Gallery in London. Copley the painter excelled in portraits, and many of his paintings are in the Boston Art Museum, including portraits of some of our earliest Presidents and other national leaders. ... Toward the end of his career, Lynd hurst, the artist's son who died in 1860 at the age of 88, led the struggle for Jewish emancipation which resulted in the admission of the first Jewish member of the Houses of Parliament.

I hope it will be possible for you to have other articles in the future of historic cases over the world. These, in terspersed with the usual articles, will add spice and interest to the readers which, I believe, will be valuable. William F. Harris Role of Supreme Court Wausau, Wisconsin In his argument that recent decisions of the United States Supreme Court have been the result of the will of the partici pating judges rather than desirable judi cial judgment, Attorney General Mitch ell's major premise is that Congress should make laws and the courts should interpret them (December issue, page 1175). Since the Constitution is essen tially a legislative document, why then does the Attorney General object to the Court's interpreting the Constitution? Even more, why does he impliedly object to the Court's expanding the scope and application of proscriptions of the Bill of Rights? . . . If courts during the past two decades appear to have gone beyond their tradi tional roles, it is in part because of the nature of the issues presented by the growth of total government and in part because Congress has failed to respond to many critical problems. In spite of the Attorney General's protestation about ju dicial legislation, the real question is whether the interstitial judicial legisla tion of the Warren Court era helped the country or hurt it. My personal favorites as models for Supreme Court jurists are Robert Jackson and Harlan Fiske Stone, both of whom respected the doctrine of judicial restraint. However, I believe jus tice is more important than the doctrine of judicial restraint, and that the bal ance sheet of legal cost accounting shows that more Americans of all races, re ligions, economic classes and political viewpoints are being treated more fairly today than twenty years ago because of the decisions of the Warren Court. Ex cesses of jurists in the direction of achieving legal justice do not disturb me. What does disturb me is that the At torney General and Chief Justice of this country fail to comprehend that justice is what millions of our fellow citizens crave and what only our lawyers and through them our courts can provide.

If, rather than aspiring unrealistically soon to the infinitely remote "towering" goals pointed out by Mr. Rhyne in his closing speech, the center might direct a measure of attention to short-term, lim ited expedients in the direction of de celeration and amelioration, lives could be saved, and the cause of peace ad vanced, however slightly, step by step.

Indianapolis, Indiana As a member of the American Bar As sociation, I would like to air some of the problems that have been nagging me re garding our profession. What kind of law will we be practicing five to ten years from now in light of the following changes that are taking place in law? 1. Real Estate Law. Practically nil, as far as the general practitioner is con cerned since realtors, banks, title insur ance, etc. have invaded this area of law. 2. Personal Injury. A matter of time before no-fault laws are enacted through out the country. 3. Divorce ? Adoption ? Change of Name, etc. Chief Justice Burger has stated that these and other related fields of law can be classified as nonessential legal matters, and can best be handled by persons other than attorneys and courts. 4. Bankruptcies. Referees and others are advocating professional, full-time trustees as well as receivers in place of appointed attorneys. Government-paid at torneys are now filing more and more bankruptcies for individuals. 5. Probate. Constantly increasing the amounts which can be probated without administration; attempts by states to leg islate fees in estates regardless of the time devoted thereto. 6. OEO and LSO. Conception has taken place. Just a matter of time before the creature is born. When nurtured toward maturity, we'll be victims of this creation. 7. State and federal decisions that limit and restrict the practice of law. 8. Increased use of quasi-judicial boards and individuals to supplant courts of law. Therefore, all I can envision is the elimination of the general practitioner as now known to us. Lawyers are beginning to see the handwriting on the wall and are seeking salaried or government posi tions. The field of law that has benefited has been criminal law through liberal deci sions. Yet, Chief Justice Burger in his many speeches has shown concern that we do not have speedy justice for the ac cused; he tends to find fault with our system, the courts, judges, attorneys and administrative help. But some of the blame must be placed at the source of the decisions that emanated from the Supreme Court. The balance of changes must benefit not only the accused but those harmed by the accused. Why doesn't the American Bar Asso ciation, publicly, go to the defense of the legal profession whenever it is attacked? Immediate public rebuttal would be war ranted. Instead, the attitude is, "Let's not make waves; it will die down." The med ical profession attack their critics by ad vertisement, press releases and other means. An occasional press release by the bar association does not have much impact. To obtain the reputation that the Association has been seeking, for the profession, the Association must go all out to rebut those misconceptions that the laymen have about law, lawyers, courts and judges. . . . I am proud to be in the profession. I believe in our legal system, even with its shortcomings. But until something better comes along to take its place, don't knock it. Let's put an end to putting our profession down. William J. Regas How available - A PRACTICAL GUIDE TO LOW By Charles LEdsoi and Bruce S.
