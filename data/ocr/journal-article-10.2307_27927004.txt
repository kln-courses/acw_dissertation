NUMBER 2 ? 2002 Abu Zureiq, a Wadi Rabah Site in the Jezreel Valley: Final Report of the 1962 Excavations YosEF Garfinkel Zinovi Matskevich The Hebrew University of Jerusalem INTRODUCTION This article presents the results of the analysis of the assemblage that originated from a test excavation conducted by Jean Perrot in 1962 at the site of Abu Zureiq. The site, located in the vicinity of Kibbutz Hazorea on the western boundary of the Jezreel Valley (fig. 1), is attributed to the Wadi Rabah culture of the seventh millennium BP.1 In 1958 Kaplan coined the term 'Wadi Rabah culture' in a short article on his excavations at the protohistoric site of Wadi Rabah, published in the IEJ (1958: 149-160). Over 40 years have passed since Kaplan's pioneering work, yet little has been excavated and even less published on this cultural entity, and Wadi Rabah remains one of the most enigmatic cultures in the archaeology of Israel. During the 1960s a significant excavation was carried out at Munhata by Perrot.2 During the late 1980s and the 1990s several large-scale excavation projects were conducted, for example at Nahal Zehora I and II (Gopher 1993: 27-28; Barkay and Gopher 1999), at Horvat cUza and Hagoshrim (Getzov 1995: 19-21), at Assawir (Yannai 1995) and at Neve Yam (Galili et al 1996). Despite the rapid accumulation of this new data, hardly any results have been published. Thus, any publication of a Wadi Rabah assemblage will expand our knowledge on various aspects of this culture. The area of Hazorea has produced rich assemblages of Wadi Rabah culture, as unearthed by six different expeditions that worked here over the years: at cEin 1 We are grateful to Jean Perrot for providing us with the opportunity to analyse and publish the material from his excavations.

The Wadi Rabah remains are distributed over a very large area (fig. 1). The peculiar settlement density in this part of the Jezreel Valley confers upon this location exceptional importance. In addition, Nahal Zehora I and II are located c. 5 km. to the south-west of Hazorea. In the location excavated by Perrot (fig. 1:1), an area of c. 70 sq.m. was opened and excavation was carried out for a few days in November 1962. The results were reported in a brief note, in which the material was attributed to before Beth Shean stage XVIII. Two layers were observed in the excavated area. Layer I (topsoil) is composed of dark alluvial soil (thickness: c. 0.5 m.). Finds are few, including some Early Bronze and Byzantine sherds (not included in this account), as well as Wadi Rabah finds. Layer II (maximum thickness: c. 0.5 m.) is Wadi Rabah, with remains of stone walls, pebble pavements, pits and installations (fig. 2). Due to the small size of the excavated area, the architectural remains are fragmentary and their size and character is obscure. Nonetheless, they clearly represent more than one occupational phase (e.g., wall 117 in square B9 is built on pit 126 and therefore postdates it). Except for a few late sherds and abraded Palaeolithic flints, all the material is attributed to the Wadi Rabah culture: pottery, flint, limestone, basalt, obsidian and + + \ + jjyj?&amp;i.' &lt; Intr;^. .? :tl ?, ....

Because of the very small sample size, we combined layers I and II into one assemblage. In accordance with the practice in those days, only diagnostic artefacts ? including rims, bases, handles and decorated sherds in the pottery assemblage and cores, tools and tool blanks in the flint assemblage ? were kept. Thus, the composition of the assemblage is slightly biased. Nevertheless, several factors make the assemblage suitable for a detailed techno-typological study: 1. The assemblage represents a single archaeological period, i.e. the Wadi Rabah culture. 2. All indicative finds were collected during the excavation, enabling the conducting of a quantitative analysis. 3. Since the 'small size elements' (such as microliths or small arrowheads) in the cultural repertoire of Wadi Rabah seem not to have been the dominant element of the industry,3 the presumed lack of sieving influenced mostly the quantity and composition of lithic debitage and debris categories, but not the composition of the assemblage of tools. 4. The large proportion of indicative finds in the assemblage constitutes an acceptable sample size. THE POTTERY ASSEMBLAGE General Description The Wadi Rabah assemblage comprises 547 sherds and a few complete modified 'discs' (see below). Since most of the body sherds are absent from the assemblage only a few could be joined, and reconstruction of relatively complete profiles of the vessels was not possible. Most of the conjoinable sherds were found within the same locus, the only exception being two red-painted body sherds from remote parts of the site (see fig. 11:18 below, p. 145). Methodology The method of the analysis included recording for every sherd its provenance, the part of the vessel from which it came (rim, base, handle, etc.), its decoration and its typological definition (in the case of an indicative sherd). Conjoinable sherds with old breaks were counted separately. The typological framework used was developed by one of the authors (Y.G.) for analysis of Munhata's ceramic assemblage.4 The scheme divides types into open and closed forms, and classifies them according to vessel size and profile. 3 This is evident from the analysis of the Nahal Zehora I assemblage originating from the excavation, where full sieving was applied, Barkay and Gopher 1999. 4 See Garfinkel 1992; 1999, for detailed definitions of the types.</page><page sequence="5">ABU ZUREIQ: FINAL REPORT OF 1962 EXCAVATIONS 133 Technological Observations All the vessels are hand-made. The assemblage may tentatively be divided into three main groups. The first includes pithoi, large holemouth jars, chalices and most of the jars. This group is characterised by coarse clay and firing at relatively low temperatures, evident from crudely burnt cores. The second group includes most of the bowls and small holemouth jars, which are manufactured from finer material with small grits and are well fired. Only some isolated sherds belong to the third group; they are made of clay rich in carbonates, the material is white, well sieved and without grits. Only limited evidence exists concerning the method of construction of the vessels. Impressions on approximately 18% of the flat and disc bases (e.g. fig. 10:14 below, p. 144) indicate that the vessels were built upon straw mats. Sometimes the necks of the jars, mostly bow rims, were constructed separately and attached to the body before firing, as evident on the inner part of the vessels, where, unlike the external part, the stitch of the two segments had not been smoothed out by the potter. Of special interest is a bowl illustrated in fig. 3:5: this rim was constructed from slightly different clay and inserted into a prepared groove in the upper part of the vessel's body. Typology Of the items found, 224 (c. 41% of the assemblage) could be classified typologically (table 1). Deep Bowls (Munhata Group A). This group consists of 36 rims (16% of the assemblage) and includes all of the types known from the Munhata assemblage: seven small deep carinated bowls (fig. 3:1-3), 12 large deep bowls (fig. 3:4-6), two spouted vessels (fig. 3:13), 14 flaring-rim bowls (fig. 3:7-12) and one unclassified item (fig. 3:11). The vessels of this group are diverse in terms of profile form, properties of the raw material, method of construction and decoration. The walls of all the small bowls are extremely thin, the clay is well sieved and the surface is decorated with red or black slip and burnished. Though no complete vessels were found, the whole profile might be easily reconstructed as all the small flat or rounded bases in the assemblage (e.g. fig. 10:9-11 below, p. 144) seem to relate to this type. Large bowls are made of coarser material; both undecorated and red painted examples are present. The group of flaring-rim bowls is the most typologically heterogeneous; the bowls have thick but well-fired walls, in most cases decorated with red slip. One of the vessels (fig. 3:11) is made of white carbonic clay and is well burnished. Shallow Bowls (Munhata Group B). There are 41 rim and upper body sherds of shallow bowls (16% of the assemblage). The following types are represented: 12 shallow incurving bowls (fig. 4:1-5), nine shallow rounded open bowls (fig. 4:6-8),</page><page sequence="6">134 YOSEF GARFINKEL AND ZINOVI MATSKEVICH Table 1.

Some are red slipped and burnished (e.g. figs. 4:2-4; 5:5). The most frequent type of decoration is a red painted band on the rim (e.g. figs. 4:6,8; 5:2,6), which occurs mostly on flat or squared rims. An interesting phenomenon is the applied rope decoration (or possibly large thumb-impressed handles, see below) appearing on some of the massive bowls (e.g. fig. 5:6-7). A parallel may be found in the assemblages of the Middle Chalcolithic.6 Chalices and Stands (Munhata Group C). There are eight sherds in this group (3.5% of the assemblage) : seven fragments of chalices (five bases and two rims) and one base of a stand (fig. 5:8). Pithoi (Munhata Group D). Pithoi are represented by 11 examples, which constitute 5% of the assemblage (fig. 6).7 The vessels are characterised by their large diameter, coarse fabric and thick, carefully constructed squared or flat rims, sometimes with a central groove (e.g. fig. 6:1). In one case (fig. 6:7), the rim bears an outward-curving pierced ridge, apparently suitable for a lid setting. Most are undecorated, and when decoration occurs it is restricted to a red band on the upper part of the rim (e.g. fig. 6:5). Holemouth Jars (Munhata Group E). This group, the most representative in the assemblage, includes 93 rims (42.5%). The three main types are: 22 rims of small holemouth jars (fig. 7:1-3), ten of holemouth jars with raised rims (fig. 7:4-5) and 61 of large holemouth jars (fig. 7:6-13). Small holemouth jars have thin walls and pointed (e.g. fig. 7:1) or squared (e.g. fig. 7:2) rims. Most are decorated by red bands of paint (e.g. fig. 7:2), red slip, red slip and burnish (e.g. fig. 7:3), or self burnish. There are two undecorated examples (e.g. fig. 7:1). In the Munhata assemblage, all vessels of this type are decorated (Garfinkel 1992: 73-74). Holemouth jars with raised rims differ from the former type only in their rims. In one case (fig. 7:5), the rim was constructed separately from the body and attached before firing. Large holemouth jars are made of coarse clay and are crudely fired. The vessels' surface is sometimes burned, possibly evidence for their function as cooking vessels. Their rims are thickened and include several variants: rounded (e.g. fig. 7:9-10), squared (e.g. fig. 7:6,7,13) and grooved (e.g. fig. 7:8,11). Unlike Munhata (Garfinkel 1992:74-75), numerous large holemouth jars at Abu Zureiq (c. 38%) are decorated, in most cases by a red band painted on the rim's upper part, but four examples have red slip (e.g. fig. 7:13). All vessels of this type at Munhata are undecorated. 6 Garfinkel 1999. Beth Shean XVIII, see Fitzgerald 1935: 6-7, pi. 111:1; see also Garfinkel 1999: fig. 97. 7 This type includes only one of two sub-types defined by Garfinkel 1999: the holemouth pithos, while the second sub-type (the open pithos) was considered as a massive bowl.</page><page sequence="11">ABU ZUREIQ: FINAL REPORT OF 1962 EXCAVATIONS 139 / ^?

Holemouth jars</page><page sequence="13">ABU ZUREIQ: FINAL REPORT OF 1962 EXCAVATIONS 141 Jars (Munhata Group F). The jars are represented by 26 sherds (11.5% of the assemblage), classified according to the form of the rim: 16 sherds of bow-rim jars (fig. 8:1-8), two of flaring-necked jars (fig. 8:9-10), three of jars with out-curving rims (fig. 9:11-12) and five of miscellaneous necks (figs. 8:12-15; 9:1-2). In addition, nine neck fragments were broadly defined as 'jar', without any specific typological definition. The bow-rim jars appear in a variety of sizes and forms, some almost straight (e.g. fig. 8:2-3) and others very closed (e.g. fig. 8:4). Most of the bow-rim jars (12) are decorated by red slip or a painted band on the rim; some are burnished. A characteristic property of the Abu Zureiq assemblage is the applied rope decoration, which appears on the jar's rim (fig. 9:2) or neck (fig. 9:3-4). This trait is unknown in the published Wadi Rabah assemblages, but appears in some designated as Middle Chalcolithic.8 Table 1 presents the frequency of pottery types in the assemblages of Abu Zureiq and Munhata. Despite the limited exposure and the relatively low number of rim sherds at Abu Zureiq, the similar methods of collection, typological analysis and sherd counting makes the comparison a valid one. The table demonstrates great similarities between the assemblages, both qualitative (in general, the same types are present) and quantitative (frequencies of the types are analogous; several types absent at Abu Zureiq are extremely rare in the much larger sample from Munhata). Body Sherds, Bases and Handles The repertoire of the Wadi Rabah culture is characterised by carinated profiles of numerous vessels (Garfinkel 1999). The carination is located between the neck and body or in the lower or middle part of the body (fig. 11:1-2). This trait is evident at Abu Zureiq too. Bases. The assemblage contains 68 bases (table 2, p. 146). The prevalent type is the flat base, with two categories: massive bases of large vessels (e.g. fig. 10:8,13-15) and thin bases of miniature bowls (e.g. fig. 10:9). Two other types ? the disc base (e.g. fig. 10:16) and the concave base (e.g. fig. 10:12) ? closely resemble the massive flat bases. It seems that the difference between them is technological, rather than stylistic, and is caused by the surface upon which the vessels were made. Some of the massive flat and disc bases bear impressions of the straw mats used for the vessels' production (e.g. fig. 10:14). The rounded base (fig. 10:10-11) is an additional form that may be related to small carinated bowls. Handles. The assemblage contains 23 items: 11 loop handles (e.g. figs. 9:1; 10:4-5), six lug handles (e.g. fig. 10:1-3) and six thumb-impressed lug handles. The latter 8 Beth Shean XVIII, Fitzgerald 1935: pi. 111:6-9; Tel Tsaf: Gophna and Sadeh 1989.

It seems that in both cases the trait is decorative, not functional. In form and construction method the thumb-impressed handles resemble the applied rope decoration (cf. figs. 10:6 and 5:6) and it is difficult to distinguish between them on the basis of fragments. Both types are primarily known from Middle Chalcolithic assemblages.9 Table 3. Types of decoration. Decoration type No. Decoration A rich variety of decoration styles is represented in the assemblage (table 3), the most frequent being red slip covering the vessel's entire surface (e.g. figs. 3:1,6-7,9-10; 4:2-4; 5:5; 7:3-5,13; 8:3-4,6-8,10; and 9:1-3). In many cases (especially miniature bowls and jars), the slip-covered surface is burnished. Black slip appears only with burnishing, and mostly on miniature bowls. A few sherds are decorated by burnishing only, without any pigment ('self burnishing'). The painted decoration is mostly restricted to a red band on the rim (e.g. figs. 3:11-12; 4:6-8; 5:2-4,6; 6:5; 7:11-12; and 8:5,12), but red (e.g. figs. 7:2,5; 11:17-18) or black bands (e.g. fig. 11:16) on the body of the vessels also appears. Sherds bearing stylos impressions (e.g. figs. 4:5; 11:9-14), incisions (e.g. fig. 11:2,6-7) and combing (e.g. fig. 11:4-5,8) are also present, as well as applied rope decoration, discussed above.

Discs The assemblage contains seven items defined as discs (fig. 9:5-11). These were modified by scraping into a rounded shape after the vessels were fired and afterwards broken. Similar items are reported from many other Levantine Neolithic assemblages.10 Three discs are perforated (fig. 9:9-11); in two other cases, only a dot was drilled in the centre of the sherds (fig. 9:7-8). In two cases decorated sherds were chosen for production of the discs (fig. 9:6,9). Various opinions concerning the function of the discs are presented in the literature. Garfinkel has suggested that they were utilised as jar stoppers (1992: 84-85). This, however, does not seem to have been the case at Abu Zureiq as the diameter of the discs does not exceed 4 cm., much less than the diameters of all the jars found in the assemblage. Another theory ascribes to the items a complex semiotic meaning: Schmandt-Besserat (1992) views them as signs in admin istrative systems. THE LITHIC ASSEMBLAGE The lithic assemblage consists of 312 flint items. Of these, 63 (including typical Levallois flakes, points and cores, sidescrapers and two Acheulian handaxes) are heavily abraded and patinated and were considered to be intrusive.11 Con sequently, this study is based on 249 lithic items, almost half of which are tools (45.4%; see table 4). The industry is flake oriented, as indicated by the cores and percentage of flakes (the ratio of flakes to blades is 1.5:1). An analysis of blanks for tool production (table 5) yields a different picture: here the ratio of flakes to blades is 3:5. Even if sickleblades (16), which by definition are produced from blades, are not taken into consideration, the blades still outnumber the flakes, and we should thus assume selection of blades for tool production. This proportion does not seem to reflect selective collection of blades during the excavation, since if the latter had taken place, a similar or even greater bias should be expected in the debitage category. Raw Materials Several types of raw materials are represented in the assemblage. The most prominent is grey-brown flint of medium quality, as evident by cores, debitage and 10 Besides the rounded form, additional shapes of the scraped sherds were identified recently in the Yarmukian assemblage of Shacar ha-Golan, see Eirikh-Rose and Garfinkel 2002. 11 Anati 1971; Anati et al. 1973: 29-40, for an account of Acheulian and Mousterian finds from the vicinity of Kibbutz Hazorea.</page><page sequence="20">148 YOSEF GARFINKEL AND ZINOVI MATSKEVICH Table 4.

This probably originated from the site's vicinity, as appears from remains of the battered cortex of river pebbles. Another type of raw material, also locally found, is light-brown Eocene flint of very high quality with lime cortex. This kind of flint was primarily used for the production of sickleblades and bifacial tools. Debitage items as well as a core of this flint (fig. 12:1) are also found, indicating its preferential use for blade production. Massive flake tools (scrapers, denticulates; figs. 13:3,14:1,3), as well as some of the bifaces, are produced from limestone (or chalk). No limestone debitage was discovered, a fact which may indicate off-site production of this group of tools. In addition, two obsidian items (an unretouched blade, fig. 12:6, and a bladelet) were found. It is of interest to note that the proportion of bladelets in the debitage is high (13%), considering the lack of sieving during the excavation. Cores and Core Trimming Elements The assemblage contains 15 cores, which may be divided into four categories: 1. One blade core with a single striking platform and parallel blade removal on one flaking surface (fig. 12:1). The raw material (light-brown flint of very high quality), along with the form and size of blade negatives, accords with analogous characteristics of the sickleblades in the assemblage. The length of the core is 64 mm.,</page><page sequence="21">ABU ZUREIQ: FINAL REPORT OF 1962 EXCAVATIONS 149 Fig. 12.

A secondary ridge blade, 118 mm. in length (fig. 12:2), almost certainly relates to this core (on the basis of raw material and cortex characteristics). 2. Four discoid cores (e.g. fig. 12:3), small to medium in size (4-8 cm. in diameter) with two flaking surfaces ('Levallois-like') and centripetal scars around the core's circumference. Two are made on primary flakes. 3. Four small cores (3-5 cm. in length) with one or two striking platforms (e.g. fig. 12:4) for production of bladelets and small flakes. These are not exhausted cores: all are manufactured on small flint pebbles and remains of cortex are preserved on considerable parts of their surfaces. 4. Six amorphic cores lack a defined reduction scheme. These medium and large cores are used for flake production, with more than two striking platforms. All were made on low- or medium-quality flint. The assemblage includes 11 core trimming elements: four ridge blades (fig. 12:2), two core tablets (fig. 12:5), one overshot flake and four others. Nine additional items (two ridge blades, one core tablet, one overshot flake and five others) were retouched and are included in the tool category. The ridge blades and core tablets are represented by quite typical examples and indicate elaborate blade production. The presence of cores and debitage items relating to different blade and flake-oriented technologies and utilising different kinds of raw material suggests that most of the tools were locally produced. Tools The assemblage includes 113 formal tools (table 6). The absence of arrowheads is characteristic of the assemblage, as of all assemblages in the Mediterranean zone of the Levant, from the seventh millennium BP (Gopher 1994; Gopher and Gophna 1993). Sickleblades (16 items, 14%). Four teen of these should be classified as Gopher's type C (Gopher 1989). Both types A and D are represented by single items. All but two items bear characteristic sickle gloss, in all cases along a single edge. All the sickle blades are retouched by regular or abrupt retouch, while pressure retouch is absent.

The proximal extremity is truncated; the second one is broken. The width (14 mm.) and the thickness (4 mm.) are close to the average of the assemblage. Type C. Characteristics of this type are fine denticulation of the working edge and truncated ends (e.g. fig. 15:1-6). Most blades are made of high quality light-brown flint. The limited sample size, along with the fact that all but one of the items are broken, prevented us from conducting a reliable metric analysis. Yet it may be noted that most of the blades are narrow and elongated with markedly straight profiles. The average width is 13.8 mm. (range: 9-19 mm.; s.d.: 3.7). Though broken, in one case only the ratio of width to length falls below 1:2, while in two cases it exceeds 1:3 in its preserved state. The length of the complete item (fig. 15:4) is 29 mm., while most of the others were longer: up to 60 mm. The items are relatively thin, the average being 4.4 mm. (range: 2-6 mm.; s.d.: 1.7). The most typical cross-section shape is trapezoid or right-angled trapezoid (e.g. fig. 15:1-2,4-5). In three cases it is triangular (e.g. fig. 15:3,6). Within this group there is great variability regarding sickleblade retouch. The backs of eight blades were formatted by abrupt retouch, four by semi-abrupt retouch, and two by regular retouch, on dorsal (11 items) or ventral faces (two items), or bipolar (one item). In seven items the truncations appear on dorsal faces, in two on ventral faces, in one, bifacial, while the denticulation of the working edge is dorsal in ten cases, ventral in one, bifacial in one, and absent in two. No repeated combination of these possibilities was observed; nevertheless, it is noteworthy that ventral truncations appear on dorsally backed blades (e.g. fig. 15:1). Type D ('Chalcolithic'). There is one complete blade of this type (fig. 15:7; 38x20 mm.); it is considerably thicker (10 mm.) than the rest of the sickleblade assemblage. The back is formatted by intensive abrupt retouch; both ends are truncated. Both the sickleblades related to types A and C differ from the rest of the assemblage in their raw material (gray chalk) and by the lack of characteristic gloss. Nevertheless, there is no reason to consider them to be intrusive: both types are present in most known Wadi Rabah sites.12 In several assemblages, e.g. Hagoshrim layer IV (early Wadi Rabah),13 sickleblades with deep denticulation are the most common type. 14 Bifacials (12%). Four types are present: axes, adzes, chisels and picks. All but three tools are made on light-brown Eocene flint of high quality. The working edge of three specimens (an axe, an adze and a chisel; fig. 16:1,3) is polished; in two it 12 E.g.

A retouched axe spall with visible polish (fig. 16:5) indicates that the renewing was occasionally performed on the site. Four axes (e.g. fig. 16:3) are bifacial tools with biconvex cross-section. Three of them are complete, and range between 75-82 mm. in length, 35-44 mm. in width and 12-28 mm. in thickness. Two axes are made on pebbles and bear cortex remains on both their faces; two others are totally flaked on their whole surface and therefore their blank is unidentifiable. The axe (fig. 16:3) is of particular interest: it was manufactured on a pebble flaked only on its distal extremity, polished on both faces and afterwards renewed by a transversal blow. Five adzes (e.g. fig. 16:2,4) are bifacial tools with plano-convex cross-section. Two are broken. In three cases the type of the tool's blank can be determined: one is made on a flake, while two others are on flint pebbles and remains of cortex are preserved on both their faces (fig. 16:2). The working edge of one adze (fig. 16:4) is formatted by scraper-like retouch. The lengths of three complete adzes are 61, 67 and 76 mm. respectively; the range of width is 29-46 mm. and of thickness 14-29 mm. Three chisels (e.g. fig. 16:1) are elongated bifaces with a straight working edge. The illustrated item seems to be made on a flake or blade; the other blanks are of unidentifiable type. The length of two complete specimens is 79 and 92 mm.; their width ranges between 19-42 mm. and their thickness between 17-23 mm. Two picks are coarse bifacial tools with triangle cross-sections. One is manufactured on a pebble and the other on a very massive flake. Both are roughly flaked in the area of the pointed end. Two aspects are of interest in the bifacial group: a predominance of adzes and chisels relative to the axes14 and the utilisation of both flakes and pebbles / nodules for tool production, possibly with prevalence of the latter. Eight Burins (7%). Five are on truncation / lateral retouch (e.g. fig. 13:2); there are also two dihedral variants and one on natural face. Noteworthy is the presence of two transverse burins (e.g. fig. 13:1), on a core trimming element of Eocene 'sickleblade flint', closely resembling the characteristic specimens from Nahal Zehora I (e.g. Gopher and Orrelle 1989: 67-76, fig. 4:2). Three Truncations (2%). One is made on a flake and two on blades. The truncated blades closely resemble sickleblades in their raw material and in the form of their blanks. They may be sickles without gloss. 15 Scrapers (13%). Nine are end scrapers (e.g. fig. 14:1-3); six are side scrapers. All are made on thick large flakes; most are not cortical. Three (e.g. fig. 14:1) are on limestone; two are on a primary and a core-trimming element of the Eocene flint. It should be noted that no cores in the assemblage are suitable, in size and method of 14 Like in other Wadi Rabah sites, e.g. Nahal Zehora I, Barkay and Gopher 1999.</page><page sequence="29">ABU ZUREIQ: FINAL REPORT OF 1962 EXCAVATIONS 157 exploitation, for the production of blanks for these implements. An interesting stylistic trait on some of the items is formatting the working edge by bifacial thinning retouch (e.g. fig. 14:1-2). 22 Notches and Denticulates (18%). Eleven are notches and the others are denticulates. Most are made on medium-quality grey-brown flint; one denticulate (fig. 13:3) is on limestone. Four Awls and Borers (3%). Three are borers (e.g. fig. 13:4-5) and one is an awl (fig. 13:6). One of the borers (fig. 13:4) is manufactured on a very straight blade with prismatic cross-section (Canaanite?) and may be an Early Bronze intrusion. 26 Retouched Items (23%). Most are made on medium-quality grey-brown flint. Six are flakes; 13 are blades; two are bladelets; two are core trimming elements; and three are of other types. Thus, the ratio of flakes to blades is c. 1:2, higher than both in the debitage and the total tool counts. Five Miscellaneous Items (4%). Noteworthy is a polished retouched blade (fig. 14:4). The polish is cut by unifacial abrupt retouch, but seems to post-date production of the blade from a core.15 OTHER FINDS Ground Stone Tools The assemblage includes 32 tools (see table 7). Wright's typological classification (1992) was applied for the implements. Two basalt grinding querns (e.g. fig. 17:2), both originating from the surface collection, are fragmented. Basalt is not available in the immediate vicinity of the site. Handstones are made of flint and limestone. Five, in addition to grinding, bear signs of battering and may have been used as hammerstones. Six handstones are unifacial discoidal, but bifacial loaf and discoidal items are also present. All hammerstones are m? Table 7. Ground stone tools.

This classification was not applied here because of the unifacial nature of the item under discussion.</page><page sequence="30">158 YOSEF GARFINKEL AND ZINOVI MATSKEVICH Fig. 17.

Two others were shaped by scraping on their entire surface; one of these (fig. 18:3) is cylindrical and bears an incised groove near one of its extremities, probably for hanging. The other item (fig. 18:4) is of plane cross section and bears thin parallel incisions or cut marks on one face. The perforated stones are made of limestone. Two (fig. 17:5-6) should be defined as spindle whorls, yet they closely resemble the ceramic discs in the assemblage and may have served the same purpose. The third (fig. 17:4) is broken, but may have been a stone bracelet. Another perforated stone is a fragment of a mace-head. The stone bowl (fig. 17:1) is made of basalt; its surface is perfectly smoothed. Worked pebbles are mostly small (2.5-8 cm.), completely or partially ground and polished. In some cases they bear bifacially ground 'axe-like' working edges, but the general form of the artefacts is irregular. There is one ground stone axe (54 31 12 mm.; fig. 17:7); it is made of limestone and its entire surface is polished. Sling Stones Ten sling stones were unearthed at Abu Zureiq. These are worked elongated stones pointed on one or both sides (figs. 19,20). Seven are made of limestone, two of flint and one seems to be made of clay (table 8). It is noteworthy that four of the items were found in a cluster in loci 132 and 136 (fill in square B9). Sling stones have been found in many Wadi Rabah sites16 and to date, no such items have been reported from other southern Levantine Neolithic or Chalcolithic cultural entities. Similar artefacts are known in the contemporary Halafian and Pottery Neolithic sites in the northern Levant and northern Mesopotamia,17 where, like one of the Abu Zureiq specimens, they are generally made of clay.

The anthropomorphic figurine (figs. 18:1; 21) is an elongated limestone plaque (62x26x12 mm.); its flat cross-section was formed by scraping a natural river pebble. In the upper part of the front of the figurine, incised lines represent eyes. The battering mark between the eyes clearly post-dates their modelling. A lower line represents female genitals. Traces of red ochre are visible on both sides of the figurine. This item closely resembles 'pebble figurines, typical of the Yarmukian culture of the eighth millennium BP. However, while the c. 150 known Yarmukian pebble figurines lack representation of genitalia (e.g. Stekelis 1972; Gopher and Orrelle 1995), the only two similar items known to us from the seventh millennium BP bear this feature.18 2. A zoomorphic figurine made of clay (figs. 18:2; 22), with an elongated muzzle, possibly a dog (height: 34 mm.; thickness: 18 mm.; back of figurine broken; surviving length: 49 mm.).

One bone tool: an awl (6 cm. long) with a point modelled by cutting and polishing. 2. Three seashells: one is an un identifiable fragment (bivalve?), and the other two shells are of Mediterranean origin: Phalium granul?tum, with an artificial ground hole in the body whorl, and Nassarius gibbosulus, with a Fig. 22. Zoomorphic figurine made of clay natural hole in the body whorl (identifications by D.E. Bar-Yosef Mayer). 3. A big sandstone flake painted by ochre on ventral face. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS The analysis of the assemblage of Abu Zureiq shows that the sample, though small, represents virtually all known aspects of material culture of the Wadi Rabah entity. Moreover, although the assemblage originates from a limited excavated area, it represents a wide range of tasks concentrated in a single locality. Those include storage and processing of plant and animal food, lithic tool production and use, and other economic, as well as symbolic, activities. This pattern may be interpreted as evidence for the autonomy of a household unit based almost exclusively on exploitation of domesticated animals and plants. The existence of external relations of such a unit are demonstrated by the presence of non-local raw materials: basalt (short distance ties), sea shells (medium distance) and obsidian (long distance). Cultural Attribution In the modern research of proto-historic periods in the Levant heavy emphasis has been placed on defining cultural entities or 'archaeological cultures'(e.g. Gopher and Gophna 1993). Criteria for their definition, in accordance with the classical conceptions of Childe (1956) and, to a lesser degree, Clarke (1968), rely on presumed unity of three main aspects: material culture, chronological placement and geographical distribution of the assemblages. With regard to the classification of assemblages in northern Israel of the seventh millennium BP, one finds two different approaches: Gopher and Gophna (1993) propose two broadly contemporary components ? 'Wadi Rabah culture' and 'Wadi Rabah variants', while Garfinkel (1999) defines two consecutive phases:</page><page sequence="36">164 YOSEF GARFINKEL AND ZINOVI MATSKEVICH Early Chalcolithic (Wadi Rabah culture) and Middle Chalcolithic (Beth Shean XVIII culture). The existing database of the material culture of the period under discussion is extremely scanty and the cultural attribution of many assemblages is often based on a very limited data set. The assemblage of Abu Zureiq is a case in point: one finds definitions of this unpublished assemblage as relating to 'a pre-Beth-Shean XVIII entity' (Perrot 1963), the Coastal Neolithic (Anati 1971), Jericho IX culture (Gopher and Gophna 1993: 322, fig. 10) and the Wadi Rabah culture (Garfinkel 1999: 108). As shown above, most of the properties of the Abu Zureiq assemblage fit the definition of the Wadi Rabah culture. These include the typological and quantitative composition of the pottery and lithic assemblages, the presence of such characteristic Wadi Rabah features (fossiles directeurs') as red and black burnished sherds, bow-rim jars, flint adzes and chisels, bitruncated sickleblades, transverse burins and sling stones. However, several traits, such as the applied rope decoration of jars, painted decoration of holemouth jars, thumb-impressed lug handles of small-sized vessels, and anthropomorphic pebble figurines do not appear or are quite rare in published Wadi Rabah assemblages. There are several ways to interpret this variability. One possibility is to date the assemblage of Abu Zureiq to a late part of the Wadi Rabah sequence, on the basis of the prevalent type of sickleblades and the fact that most of these rare features appear in the later Middle Chalcolithic assemblages. It is also possible that there is a manifestation of regional variability in the Wadi Rabah culture. Indeed, parallels for several singular traits of the Abu Zureiq assemblage can be found in other Wadi Rabah assemblages of the Hazorea region i.e. the applied rope decoration in the Tel Qiri assemblage (Baruch 1987: fig. 68:2). It is argued here that the cultural variability in the archaeological record of the seventh millennium BP is poorly documented and even more poorly understood. New field projects, the application of new research techniques and radiometrie dating will contribute further to our knowledge. The 'opening of dusty boxes', the publication and re-evaluation of assemblages from old excavations are a necessary part of this process.
