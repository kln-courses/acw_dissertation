<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Plural Society and the Western Political Tradition* KENNETH D. MCRAE Carleton University When an academic first contemplates the choice of a possible subject for a presidential address to a highly diversified association, he (or she) is faced with certain options. One may select a topic that is reasonably familiar. This is safe, but it risks losing, or boring beyond endurance, that portion of the audience whose presence for the occasion stems more from loyalty to the association than to its president for the time being. An alternative is to choose a wider or more speculative theme on which one can claim no profound knowledge, relying on conventions of civility and tolerance that permit the utterance of sweeping generalities on these occasions such as would not pass without challenge in more scholarly settings. This option may provide rather thin intellectual nourishment, but its very boldness may provoke a certain curiosity in the audience as an antidote to boredom. I confess that I have found this second alternative to be rather tempting, and therefore, without claiming special expertise in most of the areas that I shall touch upon, I propose to take a rather long view of certain aspects of the Western political tradition. Let me begin by recalling two distant events. The first is a banquet that was held at Opis, on the Tigris River, by Alexander the Great and his entourage, in 324 B.C. It was staged to celebrate Alexander's reconciliation with his Macedonian veterans, who shortly before had reached the threshold of mutiny as a result of his policy of promoting more and more Persian leaders to positions of command. Skilled as he was in leadership, the King easily quelled this unrest and then held a vast banquet of reconciliation attended by some 9,000 guests, Macedonians, Persians, and representatives of every race in his far-flung empire. After ceremonial libations led by both Greek and Zoroastrian priests, Alexander spoke, or led a prayer, in which he is reported to have called for unity of heart and mind, or concord (dopdvota), and also, more intriguingly, for "partnership in government" (the crucial phrase in the Greek is Kcotvvita Tfiq dpxiq) for Macedonians and Persians.1 * Presidential Address to the Canadian Political Science Association, Saskatoon, May 1979. 1 For summaries of the incident, see C. Morris, Western Political Thought, Vol. 1 (New York: Basic Books, 1967), 123-24, and W. W.

Printed in Canada / Imprime au Canada</page><page sequence="2">KENNETH D. MCRAE This last phrase is beset with ambiguities, and we would dearly like to know Alexander's meaning in greater detail. Yet the surviving textual sources for this incident are extremely sketchy, the main one being a mere seven lines for the whole banquet in the philosopher-historian Arrianus, who lived more than four centuries after the event and worked from earlier sources now lost. But this is the point of the story. If Alexander was floating a significant new political idea on this occasion, those who heard him were singularly slow to appreciate its full meaning, and in the transmission of the classical heritage to moder times all but the barest skeleton of his thought has been lost. In contrast, consider now a train of circumstances that begins just two years later. I refer to the vicissitudes and wanderings of the manuscripts of the scientific works of Aristotle after the philosopher's death in 322 B.C.2 These manuscripts were bequeathed first to Theophrastus and then by him to his pupil Neleus, who took them to his native town, Scepsis in the Troad. There the heirs of Neleus secreted them in a damp cellar for almost two hundred years, until they were located and purchased by the wealthy philosopher and book collector Apellicon of Teos, who brought them back to Athens. When Athens was captured by the Romans in 86 B.C. the manuscripts were immediately recognized as valuable spoils of war and shipped to Rome, where they created a sensation among philosophers and were rescued from oblivion by the preparation of new editions. Taken by themselves, these two episodes of classical history do not prove anything, but they will serve as illustrations of my thesis. I suggest that in the political tradition of the West, and in its transmission through the centuries as an intellectual heritage, there has been a recurring element of selectivity, not to mention systematic bias, that has worked to the detriment of cultural pluralism and diversity in Western societies. This is not to deny the impressive breadth and variety of the Western political tradition, nor to imply that it has been exclusively or even predominantly ethnocentric-though ethnocentrism has certainly been one of its significant elements. My argument in its simplest terms is that political theories envisaging a genuine cultural or societal pluralism have been notable chiefly by their absence in Western thought, and that the alternatives to a politics of ethnocentrism have in most instances been formulated in universalist, fusionist, integrationist, or assimilatory terms. Even the policy of Alexander that I have cited is not without ambiguity on this score, especially when set against the context of his own marriage and that of his officers with members of the Persian aristocracy. In the paragraphs that follow I shall attempt to explore this (Boston: Beacon Press, 1956), 115-17. For a more critical view, see E. Badian, "Alexander the Great and the Unity of Mankind," Historia 7 (1958), 428-32. 2 For a brief overview, see J. A. K.

Nous pensons que la tradition occidentale depuis ses debuts en Grece classique a fait preuve d'un manque evident de sympathie a l'egard de la pluralite culturelle. Ici, le concept de pluralite culturelle ou sociale se rapporte a une societe compartimentee ou cloisonnee (.. segmented &gt;) et ne doit pas etre identifie au . pluralisme &gt; de la pensee politique britannique et americaine du XXe siecle. Nous avons retenu, pour approfondir cette hypothese, le stoicisme, les relations de l'Eglise et de l'Etat au moyen age, la Reforme protestante, I'essor des regimes monarchiques au XVIe siecle en Europe et l'emergence des mouvements nationalistes depuis la Revolution francaise. Les quelques hommages que l'on rend dans la philosophie occidentale a la societe pluri-culturelle ne sont qu'accessoires et sont le plus souvent les consequences inattendues de forces politiques. Le concept de tolerance religieuse dans les societes pluri-confessionnelles en est un bon exemple. Ceci dit, nous pensons que la pensee politique occidentale comporte plusieurs elementsfavorables a la pluralite culturelle et qu'il importe en premier lieu de les approfondir si l'on veut elaborer une doctrine politique adaptee a la pluralite culturelle des societes contemporaines. D'autres elements d'une telle pensee politique peuvent se trouver dans la philosophie politique non-occidentale, dans d'autres sciences humaines et dans la vie politique des societes pluralistes elles-memes. thesis more fully in relation to certain major tendencies in Western political thought. Before doing so, however, I must clarify my intended use of the term pluralism. The concept has been used in at least three significant and distinct ways in recent political analysis, as well as in certain other minor contexts that I shall not pursue here.3 The first, in a roughly chronological order, is that of the British political pluralists, primarily J. N. Figgis, Harold Laski, and G. D. H. Cole, who were influenced by an earlier generation of scholars including Lord Acton and F. W. Maitland, who in turn was inspired by the German jurist Otto von Gierke. Their primary concern was with voluntary associations as alternative foci of citizen loyalties and as bulwarks of liberty against the dangers of a too-powerful state. For Figgis, the first line of defence lay in the churches; for Cole-the most radical questioner of the traditional doctrine of state sovereignty-it lay in economic interest groups organized on a guild or functional basis. All of these writers, however, appear to have taken the underlying social and cultural integration of the political system for granted. A second use of the pluralist concept occurs in the American literature on interest-group politics, as represented by A. F. Bentley, 3 See D. Nicholls, Three Varieties of Pluralism (London: Macmillan, 1974), and also his The Pluralist State (London: Macmillan, 1975).</page><page sequence="4">KENNETH D. MCRAE David Truman, Robert Dahl, and an impressive list of critics, defenders, analysts, and revisionists. Their central concern was the competition of countervailing interest groups as the central element in policy formation. Originating as an explanatory model of the American system, it became during the 1950's a normative one as well.4 Much of this literature assumes that the membership of individuals in more than one interest group will create cross-pressures and moderate the level of intergroup conflict, thereby counteracting and reducing the potentially harmful effects of societal cleavages. This school therefore assumes that if serious societal cleavages exist, they will be taken care of by the normal operation of the political process. A third use of the concept of pluralism arose in the literature on colonial societies and their post-colonial successor states, as exemplified by J. S. Furnivall, M. G. Smith, Leo Kuper and Pierre van den Berghe, who began to study societies having sharply distinct ethnic communities that interacted primarily at the economic level. This interest then spread to the study of certain developed, industrialized countries that were also marked by relatively high degrees of cultural or social segmentation, particularly in the writings of the so-called "consociational school," primarily Arend Lijphart, Gerhard Lehmbruch, Hans Daalder, Jiirg Steiner, and Val Lorwin.5 What characterizes this third variety of pluralism, whether in developing or developed countries, is the presence in the political system of two or more substantially complete social systems backed up by corresponding networks of social institutions, which may be established on the basis of race, communal or ethnic identity, lanlgage, religion, ideological Weltanschauung, or-as often happens-some cumulation of these characteristics. It is this third, and to my mind more radical, variety of pluralism that is my basic concern here. To distinguish it from the others we may refer to it as societal or cultural pluralism, and it is important to note that this means not just generalized cultural diversity but recognizable patterns of segmentation in formal institutions, in associational memberships, and in other areas of behaviour. Much of the contemporary world lives under such conditions of societal pluralism, and the problem has assumed vastly increased dimensions in the post-colonial period. My question-and it is more than an academic one-is to what extent the Western intellectual tradition, both in its doctrines and in the institutions to which they have given rise, can offer useful guideposts for political systems of this type. One must not, of course, expect the impossible. It is necessary to remember changing historical contexts and fluctuating norms of political participation. Much of Western political development 4 Nicholls, Three Varieties, 25. 5 See my Consociational Democracy: Political Accommodation in Segmented Societies (Toronto: McClelland and Stewart, 1974). 678</page><page sequence="5">The Plural Society and the Western Political Tradition and political thought may be only marginally relevant to problems of participatory politics in moder mass societies. Aristotle, locked into the world of the polis, was working within limited horizons and-as one author has bluntly put it-"backing a non-starter."6 His fundamental distinction between Greek and barbarian is familiar enough. Though this element of ethnocentrism can be qualified on closer study, it cannot be made to disappear. Hence the emergence of new and wider philosophical perspectives in the decades after Aristotle's death, perspectives made possible by the conquests of Alexander and the diffusion of Greek culture over a vast terrain already occupied by other cultures, represented a major turning point in political thought. From a political standpoint the most important of these new perspectives is usually considered to be the Stoic school, on account of its bold doctrine of the unity of mankind. Beyond doubt this was an impressive achievement, but certain observations are in order. First, the Stoic doctrine, at least in its early phases, remained at the level of moral precepts for the enlightened individual, and did not become a major force for societal change. Second, in emphasizing man's common moral heritage under the rule of a universal divine reason, Stoicism apparently tended to discount or disregard cultural differences. Here too, of course, we must remember that the writings of all the earlier Stoics have been lost, and their work must be assessed on the basis of fragments and later sources. Ultimately, however, it was Imperial Rome rather than Hellenistic Greece that provided the ancient world with its most durable and most tangible experience of cultural coexistence, and while this experience may owe something to the slow working of Stoic doctrine, it was also founded on a long pragmatic accumulation of cultural contacts.7 One of the cornerstones of the Western tradition has been the tendency for church and polity to become separate entities, or at least separate functions of society, and for much of the medieval period this tendency found expression in the doctrine of the Two Swords. In its origins, of course, this concept of separation is much older, stemming from Judaic tradition and its experience of foreign domination and the captivity. Lord Acton has found in the medieval conflict of regnum and sacerdotium the principal roots of the Western tradition of political freedom. In a brilliant, convoluted, but also highly biased essay published in 1877, he argues that only the four hundred year conflict between the feudal hierarchy and the ecclesiastical hierarchy saved Europe from a "Byzantine or Muscovite despotism."8 Nevertheless, as Acton himself emphasizes, the aim of both sides was absolute authority; it was not the respective doctrines of a universal Church or a universal 6 Morris, Western Political Thought, Vol. 1, 108. 7 T. J. Haarhoff, The Stranger at the Gate (2nd ed.; Oxford: Blackwell, 1948). 8 "The History of Freedom in Christianity," in G.

MCRAE Empire, but the circumstances and tactics of their rivalry, that led to political freedoms in the West. From the standpoint of societal pluralism, however, it could be argued that the vigorous cultural diversity of medieval Europe owed less to this clash of conflicting hierarchies and doctrines than to the simple incapacity of feudal societies to impose more effective norms of centralization. There are other aspects of the Judaeo-Christian tradition that we should at least note in passing. At first glance the principle of monotheism itself might seem inimical to cultural pluralism. Certainly at a later date the elegant parallels between an all-powerful deity ruling a divinely ordered universe and an absolute monarch fashioned in the divine image became somewhat overworked and were undoubtedly used for centralizing purposes. Yet somewhat paradoxically, to the extent that monotheism enabled Judaeo-Christianity to become a world religion transcending tribal or regional boundaries, it became an instrument for greater intercultural contact. The professed aim of early Christianity, however, was not so much cultural coexistence as the transcendence of previous cultural affiliations: in Christianity, wrote Paul the Apostle, "there is neither Jew nor Greek."9 While such a doctrine was clearly favourable to wider contacts, it was clearly less supportive of continuing diversity than the more pluralist theology of Hinduism, or of the early Roman Empire, or of the Persians, who, as Haarhoff observes, "were notable for the respect they paid to gods of other nations."10 Another feature of the Judaeo-Christian tradition has been its strong emphasis on theological orthodoxy and its penchant for rigorous measures against both heretics and infidels. In the relationship of the Christian world with Islam one can see an extension and an enlargement of the fundamental ethnocentrism of classical Greece. In practice this was to make the Church a partner and co-conspirator of the feudal hierarchy in more than one venture in territorial and cultural imperialism in the Mid-east and elsewhere. While one might argue that any general relationship between religious orthodoxy and societal uniformity in the history of the West remains to be demonstrated, specific episodes invite closer investigation. For example, it is difficult not to see some connection between the Occitan question in contemporary France and the cruelties of the Albigensian Crusade and the destruction of Provencal culture more than seven centuries ago. The Protestant Reformation and its political consequences initiated fundamental changes in the religious environment, imposing de facto diversity upon an ideology of universalism. Once again, the consequences were unintended by virtually all the early protagonists of Reform. Both Catholics and Reformers alike sought strict religious 9 Galatians 3: 28. 10 The Stranger at the Gate, 277. 680</page><page sequence="7">The Plural Society and the Western Political Tradition orthodoxy and took almost identical positions on the need to punish heretics and schismatics without mercy. Yet in the longer run the logic of the political and military struggle eventually forced other solutions, at first on a pragmatic and temporary level, later in the form of recognized political principles. What is instructive here is the range of solutions that developed. While the Empire and Switzerland were compelled to accept territorial segmentation, on the principle cujus regio ejus religio, other countries experimented with limited and conditional toleration of dissenters side by side with an established church. A more radical formula, though not adopted by any Western polity before the eighteenth century, was to depoliticize the question through full disestablishment and legal separation of church and state. The Reformation left its most valuable political legacy in those countries where it remained partial or incomplete, for here the implications of societal pluralism had to be confronted most directly. In the Swiss case there is persuasive evidence that the lessons of Protestant-Catholic coexistence, painfully but thoroughly learned through more than three centuries of trial and error from the time of Zwingli's first work in Zurich to the end of the Sonderbund War, became firmly anchored in the political culture and offered an all-important base for the conciliation of other conflicts of language and class that threatened Swiss stability in the first two decades of this century. On the other hand, one might argue that the Reformation remained incomplete in the Empire and in the Swiss cantons precisely because they were already characterized by pluralistic political structures-or by an absence of centralizing tendencies-in a way that differentiated them from the emerging national monarchies even before the Reformation. In a more general context, however, one may view the Reformation and its ultimate consequence of enforced tolerance of religious diversity as perhaps the most important of all the sources of societal pluralism in the history of the West. From this perspective John Locke's Letters on Toleration are a more important contribution to Western thought than his Two Treatises of Government. We may now look more closely at the secular side. If feudal societies were characterized by indirect rule and decentralized power structures, the situation was different for the emerging national monarchies of the sixteenth century. In these the policy was to build a stronger central authority at both the symbolic and the practical level, and to create new and stronger direct linkages between sovereign and subject. The Bodinian and Hobbesian theories of sovereignty were a major weapon in this establishment of a bourgeois society upon the crumbling foundations of the feudal order, though of course Bodin's system still reveals some feudal remnants side by side with the new order. Though it might not be put into practice right away, the centralizing and homogenizing potential of these transformed power 681</page><page sequence="8">KENNETH D. MCRAE structures in the national monarchies is all too apparent, and whether the centre was to be ruled in absolutist or constitutionalist fashion made only marginal differences in the end results. The evolution of political philosophy in this new setting had even more radical implications. Under the spell of seventeenth-century natural science, Hobbes constructed a mechanical model of human behaviour that interpreted both psychology and politics in terms of the interplay of matter and motion. This theory has profound consequences for any concept of societal pluralism. To understand mankind in general, Hobbes says, look inwards: nosce teipsum, and you will understand all of humanity, on account of the "similitude of passions."'1 By this procedure the cultural specificity of behaviour is reduced to insignificance, if it does not disappear altogether. Hobbes made politics a science, but a science that suppresses or subordinates every major source of human variation: ethnic identity, social orders and classes, individual temperament. Moreover, Hobbes does not merely enunciate a new doctrine; he initiates a major philosophical tradition that remained without serious challenge until the eighteenth century. Nevertheless, there is a countercurrent, an alternative tradition, founded upon perceptions of differences in national character. This doctrine finds a modern point of departure in Machiavelli, that source of many paradoxes, who first insists on the uniformity of human desires and passions at all times and in all places, and then later, after repeating the notion of uniformity of motivation, goes on to observe that certain nations manifest special vices or virtues over long periods, a fact that he attributes to differences in their patterns of education.l2 The question is explored more extensively by Bodin, who attributes variations between nations and regions to both celestial and geographic-climatic influences. 3 Almost two centuries later, Montesquieu develops an even more intricate pattern of relationships in which geographic, sociological, and political factors are each interlinked with the central governing principle that underlies each of his three main categories of political system. Because this alternative tradition does recognize human variability in different settings, it deserves closer examination. Machiavelli, though he does not pursue the matter further, does recognize persisting variations which in modern terminology would undoubtedly be classed as elements of the civic culture. Bodin is at once more "scientific" and less cultural, attributing most, if not all, of the systematic variations in the nature of peoples to physical or material factors and insisting 11 Leviathan, ed. by C. B. Macpherson (Harmondsworth: Penguin), 82-83. Hobbes himself introduces minor qualifications, but these do not change the main thrust of his argument, nor his influence on later writers. 12 Discourses, Book I, chap. 39, and Book III, chap. 43. 13 Method for the Easy Comprehension of History ed. by B.

Furthermore, Bodin is imbued in typical Renaissance fashion with the concept of a divinely ordered universe and a fundamental complementarity of regional diversities as part of the cosmic order.14 Montesquieu, although far from rigorous in his method, is an authentic explorer of human diversity, apparently without underlying assumptions of concord or complementarity among divergent political systems. In none of these writers, however, does the question arise of combining or linking divergent groups, nations, or regions in the same social or political system. Their common aim is not to accommodate diversity within a given system but to define, categorize, and cope with the varieties of human experience. If the seventeenth century sanctified individualist liberalism, the eighteenth, as numerous scholars have reminded us, witnessed a rediscovery of the concept of community, a phenomenon that appears in such radically different thinkers as Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Edmund Burke. Within a few decades, this idea was to be placed wholly and without hesitation at the service of the nation and the nation-state, as nationalist writers and nationalist movements multiplied throughout Europe. The most immediate and dramatic result was the long-delayed political unification of Germany and Italy as polities on the nation-state model, but this same thrust of nationalism placed increasing strains on the more heterogeneous political regimes of central and eastern Europe, and even on some western European polities. One need only recall the political history since 1815 of the Poles, Czechs, Slovaks, Hungarians, Slovenes, Serbs, Croatians, Greeks, Turks, Armenians, Bulgarians, Rumanians, Ukrainians, Lithuanians, Latvians, Estonians, Finns, Swedo-Finns, Irish, Welsh, Flemings, Bretons, Basques, Catalans and Corsicans to realize the strength of the nationalist appeal and its dangerous potential for societies characterized by ethnic or linguistic pluralism. If nationalism was one of the most powerful political ideas of the nineteenth century, what was said on the other side? As the lifelong scholarship of Hans Kohn has shown us, there were many varieties of nationalist writers and movements, but on the liberal side the only anti-nationalist of stature was Lord Acton. Of multinational and aristocratic lineage himself, Acton attacks the "new" theory of nationality as antithetical to his major concerns, political liberty and freedom of conscience, and he praises the multinational state in curiously anthropomorphic and elitist language that rings rather strangely a century later. For example: The combination of different nations in one State is as necessary a condition of civilised life as the combination of men in society. Inferior races are raised by 14 Method, 116-17, 122. 683</page><page sequence="10">KENNETH D. MCRAE living in political union with races intellectually superior. Exhausted and decaying nations are revived by the contact of a younger vitality. Nations in which the elements of organisation and the capacity for government have been lost, either through the demoralising influence of despotism, or the disintegrating action of democracy, are restored and educated anew under the discipline of a stronger and less corrupted race. This fertilising and regenerating process can only be obtained by living under one government. It is in the cauldron of the State that the fusion takes place by which the vigour, the knowledge, and the capacity of one portion of mankind may be communicated to another. Where political and national boundaries coincide, society ceases to advance....15 Nevertheless, he finds an important and mutually supportive relationship between political freedom and cultural diversity: The presence of different nations under the same sovereignty is similar in its effect to the independence of the Church in the State.... Liberty provokes diversity, and diversity preserves liberty by supplying the means of organisation.... The co-existence of several nations under the same State is a test, as well as the best security of its freedom. It is also one of the chief instruments of civilisation.16 Even if personal freedom remains his more enduring concern, the positive values of cultural diversity are recognized here in the most explicit terms. Acton is far from typical of his age, however, and his views were scarcely heeded until the excesses of nationalism in the twentieth century led to a renewal of interest in its critics. If Acton stood alone among liberals in questioning the idea of nationality, there were others who mistrusted the state, and especially the more organic and metaphysical theories of the state in the Hegelian tradition. One important and familiar alternative formulation pointed towards socialism and international working-class solidarity as an alternative focus of loyalty. Another led to interest in other associations within the polity. Otto von Gierke, while continuing to stress the organic nature of the state and rejecting individualist liberalism, insisted on the simultaneous claims of subsidiary social groups and fellowships (Genossenschaften) to be recognized as natural, independent, organic entities enjoying autonomous legal personality. Von Gierke's thought, especially as transmitted through the English legal historian F. W. Maitland, became a major influence on the development of English political pluralism. What united the writers of this school was their common concern to recognize in the various intermediary groups between citizen and state something more than mechanical groupings of individuals, something more than mere legal fictions defined and permitted to exist by the state, something with a meaningful existence and personality independent of state or citizen. What divided them was the primary focus of that concern. For Figgis and the early Harold Laski, 15 Essay on "Nationality" (1862) in Essays on Freedom and Power, 160-61. 16 Ibid., 160. 684</page><page sequence="11">The Plural Society and the Western Political Tradition it was the autonomy and vitality of churches; for G. D. H. Cole, it was greater economic independence for organized producer groups; for Ernest Barker and A. D. Lindsay, it was an enhanced role for associations generally. However none of these writers ever seems to have extended this concern for group autonomy and personality to racial or ethnic or linguistic groups. The above paragraphs are intended to indicate, though only in the most cursory fashion, what I believe to have been the general level of concern for cultural or societal pluralism that has been manifested in the Western political tradition since classical times. For the most part I have stayed close to the mainstream, if only because these are the ideas that we expound to vast numbers of unsuspecting undergraduates and thus transmit to future generations as core values of that tradition. I hope that this brief overview has been sufficient to illustrate my general thesis, which is-to restate it more bluntly-that Western political thought in general has shown little understanding or respect for the cultural diversity of mankind and has made scant allowance for it as a possible concern of government. More specifically, one may suggest that the Western tradition reveals three categories of response to cultural diversity. The first is frankly group-centred or ethnocentric and leans towards theories of group superiority, whether the group in question be the polis, the nation, or-as two recent studies have reminded us-the concept of Europe as a whole or of a mythical Aryan race.17 A second response is to posit various forms of universalism that stress the essential similarities of all humanity and gloss over cultural differences as insignificant. The third is to recognize differences in regional or national character while seeking to explain them on physical or environmental, rather than cultural, grounds. Theories of this third category can generally ignore the question of political coexistence of different cultures because they are typically founded on assumptions of geographical segregation. The one major area of exception in this vast but rather bleak landscape is the example of religious pluralism, especially in the post-Reformation period, and the various political solutions that were developed as responses to this problem are perhaps all too quickly dismissed as irrelevant to other types of cultural pluralism. As I have noted above, these observations have focussed on the "mainstream" of Western political thought, but this in turn poses an interesting question: is there any evidence of other streams, of lesser channels, eddies, backwaters, or even swamps, where different and possibly more interesting life forms may be discovered? Have we, under the 400-year-old spell of national sovereignty, unwisely neglected other sectors of Western thought that are more relevant to societal pluralism? 17 See V. G. Kieran, The Lords of Human Kind (Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1972) and L. Poliakov, The Aryan Myth (London: Chatto Heinemann, 1974). 685</page><page sequence="12">KENNETH D. MCRAE Should we turn from the nation-building efforts of France, England, and Spain to the less familiar complexities of the German Empire or the Eastern marches of Europe? Should we devise an alternative curriculum in political thought that would stress Althusius over Bodin, Montesquieu over Rousseau, von Gierke over Hegel, Acton over Herbert Spencer, Abraham Kuyper over T. H. Green, Karl Renner and Otto Bauer over Marx and Engels? In short, have we been studying the wrong thinkers, and even the wrong countries? I must confess that I do not have a satisfactory answer to these questions. The Western political tradition is rich and diversified, and my own perspective is both limited in range and also slanted by the same forces that have shaped others educated in the West. Nevertheless at the intuitive level I feel that the quest for an alternative historical tradition-a tradition more receptive to societal pluralism-would be somehow artificial. This is not the way that the Western political mind has defined itself in the past and even continues to define itself today. Indeed the net result of such an effort might show the Western tradition to be even more hostile to societal pluralism than I have already indicated. Further, and at a more practical level, one can observe that the Swiss have survived and flourished not by constructing an alternative pluralist philosophy for Swiss use but by not allowing traditional political philosophy to stand in the way of pragmatic solutions to pluralist issues. Nevertheless, the problem of the plural society remains, and even intensifies, for two reasons: first, because population mobility in the Western world is high and seems likely to remain so; second, because the question of cultural identity in the so-called post-industrial society has assumed a sensitivity that it never had before. The result has been a vastly increased salience of minorities and minority consciousness in the Western and the non-Western world alike, most notably where visible minorities are in question, but also in the case of what we might term "audible" minorities. To some degree this upsurge of consciousness reflects the success of liberal and socialist elements of the Western tradition in promoting egalitarian values and norms, and the subsequent discovery that in plural societies the realization of these norms is impeded by cultural differences. In my judgment, it is no longer sufficient for political philosophy to continue in a cultural vacuum, as though such differences did not exist. In a few eloquent lines, Guy Heraud has epitomized the burden carried by cultural minorities in moder society: "C'est epuisant de combattre sans arret, tous les jours de sa vie. Car tel est bien le sort des minorites. On est minoritaire ad aeternum, c'est cela qui est terrible." 18 If I cite Heraud with approval here, it is not because I accept without qualification his proposed remedy of ethnic federalism, which appears 18 Philosophie de I'ethnisme (Nalinnes-lez-Charleroi: Institut Jules Destree, 1969), 28. 686</page><page sequence="13">The Plural Society and the Western Political Tradition to be at best a partial solution under present circumstances. In a world of steadily increasing urbanization and intercultural contact, one could not redraw political boundaries so as to eliminate minorities without imposing severe costs upon the global economy and perhaps most heavily upon the more peripheral cultures themselves. One can consider, however, how to make the position of cultural minorities more tolerable, and if this is a problem for political science in general it can also be seen as a task for contemporary political philosophy. The basic question, then, is how contemporary Western political philosophy might be adapted to meet the challenge of plural societies and increasing cultural diversity. Although I have argued that the Western tradition has been largely unsympathetic to the claims of societal pluralism in the past, there is every likelihood that it possesses some untapped resources in this area and some capacity to adapt. If adaptation is to succeed, I believe that a comprehensive effort of synthesis and innovation is indicated, involving at least five separate stages that might be categorized as follows: (1) closer scrutiny of those elements favourable to cultural pluralism in the Western political tradition; (2) comparison with selected non-Western political traditions in societies that have been marked by significant cultural pluralism; (3) selective borrowing from the findings of other disciplines that have been exploring plural societies in greater depth; (4) systematic study of pragmatic responses to societal pluralism in the institutions and processes of a wide range of polities in the Western and non-Western world; (5) an effort at systematic analysis and synthesis. Although I cannot claim expertise in most of the above areas, perhaps a few comments and illustrations are in order. For the Western tradition, greater emphasis might fall on some of the half-forgotten byways, such as the older Germanic Imperial, anti-national tradition, or on the Roman world, or on Hellenistic civilization. For non-Western thought, one might explore the evolution of Hindu thought,19 and perhaps selected phases of Islamic history. In other social science disciplines, one can think of the work of social psychologists on attitudes and stereotypes, or of sociologists on ethnicity and race relations, as areas useful for closer study. Finally, the real world of past and present plural societies, considered at a simple descriptive level, yields many possible raw materials. One need only mention institutions or practices such as special or concurrent majorities, the mutual veto, separate electoral registers, minority guarantees and treaties, proportionality in 19 On Hindu cultural syncretism there is a stimulating unpublished paper by my colleague V.

These rather diversified building blocks could be used as possible foundations for a more systematic approach to societal pluralism in Western political philosophy. There are some indications that the time for building a more adequate theory is at hand. As Vernon Van Dyke has recently observed, "It is not enough for political theorists to contemplate simply the individual and society, or relationships between man and the state. It is time to contemplate mankind in its great variety."20 His own recommendation is that ethnic and religious communities merit more explicit recognition in Western democratic theory than they have so far received: The requirements of logic and the long-term requirements of universal justice commend the idea of accepting communities as right-and-duty-bearing units. It is quite illogical to take the view that only states, nations, and "peoples" are entitled to be treated as entities and that lesser groups are not.21 Van Dyke's treatment of this question is frankly exploratory from a theoretical standpoint and leaves untouched a number of basic difficulties, including definition of group boundaries and identification of group spokesmen or group will. But these lacunae are arguments not so much for abandoning the project as for pursuing it more vigorously. There are, of course, some critics who will argue that any formal recognition of societal pluralism serves only to accentuate the problem and-in the well worn phrase-to "stir up trouble." My own conviction is that the intergroup tensions characteristic of most plural societies will surface whether or not their component groups are explicitly recognized, and that the best chances for conflict management lie in acknowledging cultural pluralism and building upon it, openly, in a spirit of compromise, and before the time for rational discussion runs out. 20 Vernon Van Dyke, "The Individual, the State, and Ethnic Communities in Political Theory," World Politics 29 (1977), 369. 21 Ibid.
