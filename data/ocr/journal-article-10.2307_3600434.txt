<plain_text><page sequence="1">Literality and Absence of Self in the Work of Carl Andre Dominic Rahk One of the constants of Carl Andre's work has been his use of materials that are presented as being unaltered by him. Typically, a work by Andre consists of a number of identical material elements such as firebricks or steel plates that appear to be used as found, materials that might ordinarily be used in the construction industries and that already have a standardised form. These are placed together to produce a 'form' that looks more as if it were simply the mechanical consequence of the mere procedure of placing together than consciously elaborated. The obviousness of the form and the unalteredness of the material has the effect of lessening what one might think to be the involvement in the work's making by the individual that is Carl Andre, or at least poses this possibility. A work by Andre thus allows an experience of its materiality as such without this material necessarily functioning as a medium through which some other experience or realm is represented. This kind of experience of the work's 'as-suchness' has often been valorised in the reception of Andre's work. For example, Diane Waldman began the final paragraph of her essay in the catalogue of Andre's 1970 retrospective at the Guggenheim Museum in New York by commenting that Andre's work 'aspires to document no condition other than its own existence' and went on to say that 'in an art with no overt references to life, his work is all the more real' .1 Other monographs or exhibition catalogue texts contain similar statements. One word that has been used in critical discourse to describe this quality in Andre's work, and in Minimal Art generally, is literality, especially since 1966 when Michael Fried first used the term 'literalism' to describe Minimalism in its difference from modernist painting and sculpture.2 When the word 'literal' is looked at closely in relation to art, its meaning becomes quite difficult to pin down, as will become apparent in what follows. For now, literality can be taken to mean the condition of existence or appearance where what exists or appears does so only in its own terms, and not in terms of something else, or as representing something else. In the same monographs that praise Andre's work for its literality, the sense is retained that this literality is the product of Andre's sensibility, the distillation of his own experiences. In fact, in every monograph on Andre's work there appear passages that explain his work biographically, referring to his upbringing in the industrial city of Quincy, Massachusetts, or to his revelation of flatness whilst canoeing on a lake in New Hampshire.3 Yet these explanations seem unconvincing because they run counter to the material literality of the work that, by definition, cannot be seen in terms of a sensibility or a self. One is faced with the paradox that the absence of self implied by material literality is explained through the reinsertion of an originary self as determining the work. Although literality tends to be stated as the primary concern of Andre's work, there is always also a counterstatement that undermines this and posits the self as the prior and privileged term. One wonders whether it is really possible to consider literality as a condition that can be attributed to such work, or whether it is better seen as in some sense a l.

If the latter is the case, one then wonders what the relationship might be between the self who produces and a produced literality, or in slightly different terms, between the self who produces and a produced absence of self. Producing Literality In early 1959, Andre had just completed, according to the recollection of his friend Hollis Frampton, a series of what Frampton termed 'negative sculptures'.4 These were at the time Andre's largest sculptures to date and are often taken, especially the two that bear the title 'Ladder', as representing the beginning of his practice as an artist (though he would not exhibit a work until 1964). The sculptures in this series were made from lengths of timber found on construction sites in New York, by Andre or his friends. The raw material for the second of the 'Ladders', titled Last Ladder (Fig. 1), was found by Frank Stella and Frampton and carried back to Stella's West Broadway studio, where it was worked on by Andre (as were the other works in the series).5 At this time, Stella was working on his black stripe paintings, which he had begun that winter.6 The found material from which Last Ladder was made was a length of timber about seven feet long and about six by six inches in section. Into it, Andre chiselled a series of five recesses of more or less equal size along one of its faces, leaving about an inch of uncarved wood between them. The recessed planes were carved in such a way that they receded from the surface according to a curve, deep enough so that they seem almost to reach the back of the timber, and in such a way as to make each recess appear as if it were half of an arc in profile, especially when viewed as in the photograph that Frampton took of it standing in Stella's studio early in 1960, in three-quarter profile.7 Such is the basic form of the work - if it is seen as a ladder, then the carved recesses would be the spaces between the 'rungs'. The timber is quite heavily knotted, with a particularly prominent knot in each of the five recessed planes, and has a series of deep splits along one side. There are a number of holes (including a large one at the left side of the central recess) that refer to its previous use as construction timber. A bolt can be seen running through the bottom of the timber, whilst near to the top there is a hole with a shallow indentation around it, suggesting that there was once a bolt there too. Although Andre worked on the timber, its prior appearance and use was not concealed. This seems to have been important for the way that the work was first theorised. In Frampton's account of Andre's early work, he described the 'negative sculptures' as being concerned, on one hand, with 'Brancusi's insistence on the superiority of direct cutting', and, on the other, with the 'sculptural immanence' of uncarved or otherwise unworked pieces of material (which in the winter of 1958-59 were usually blocks of wood or Perspex).8 Last Ladder has come to assume a virtually mythic status in the standard accounts of Andre's work as a beginning, as a founding moment of literalism, because its unworked aspects were seen to prefigure the way that the vast majority of his subsequent works were made from materials unaltered by him.9 This 'sculptural immanence' may equally well refer though to the purely formal possibilities inhering in material specificity - a relatively conventional idea in terms of modernist sculpture. The invoking of the name Brancusi, in whose work Andre had a serious interest, supports this view. However, where Brancusi's works were generally outwardly oriented positive forms in space, Andre's carving resulted in an inwardly oriented 'negative' form requiring the 4.

Others in the social network who would have seen or known about Andre's work at this time would have been Barbara Rose, who had known Andre since 1956, the year of his arrival in New York, and was at that time studying at Columbia University, and Michael Fried, also a friend of Stella's, then in his final year at Princeton. (Stella had graduated from Princeton in 1958.) Rose would become an important early defender of Minimal Art; Fried, of course, would later become its most important critic. 7.

In particular, this beginning is always coupled with an anecdote in which Stella is said to have remarked to Andre that the uncarved surface, the 'back', of Last Ladder 'was sculpture too'. Stella appears to have meant that Andre should have carved the 'back' as well as the front whereas Andre literal-mindedly thought he meant that the uncarved face was already sculpture.

It is possible that some kind of conceptual conceit lay behind this inversion of traditional modernist sculptural form, yet one recognises too, especially when seen from the perspective of Andre's later work, that Last Ladder was still determined to an extent by such a tradition and conventions. It cannot be so easily described in terms of literality as the later work. The reason Last Ladder cannot be regarded in such a way is because its form is to some extent fi&lt;qural. By this I mean that the formal character of the recessed planes, their curvature for instance, can only be seen in terms of a more general formal realm (the circular, the cyclical) that is not found in and lies beyond the literality of the found construction timber itself. The figural is a mode of meaning opposed to the as-suchness of literality because it involves some kind of comparison or transference that introduces some other thing or realm beyond mere literality. The figural is always more- or other-than-literal, either as metaphor, symbol or expression. Last Ladder, although defined in one way by its literality, also operates within a figural mode that, as for modernist sculptural form, can be interpreted in terms of the universality of form as such. This figural mode is that of the symbolic - the aesthetic symbol can be defined as a sensuously apprehended object or image that has a wider significance not pointed to but which is felt to be in some way instantiated by it.l° A symbol thus brings together in a relationship of immediacy the literal and the figural realm of the more-than-literal, and requires for its 'understanding' a mode of consciousness capable of imagining the general or universal in the particular. The symbolic character of Last Ladder depends on the way that the material has been made to depart from a literal particularity into an imagined universal realm of forms. Yet such a description of Last Ladder cannot help but remain troubled by the way that the unaltered and all-too- literal character of the length of timber itself- the bolt, the drilled holes (signs not only of its materiality, but also of its prior non-art use) - remains so apparent. The interest of Last Ladder would seem to lie therefore in this unsettling coexistence of the apparently symbolic and an excessive literality. Last Ladder was not exhibited at the time it was made, and, in fact, Andre did not exhibit any of his works until 1964, when he was asked to participate in a group exhibition, 'Eight Young Artists', curated by E. C. Goossen at the Hudson River Museum in Yonkers, New York. The work he contributed was actually a remade version of an earlier work, one of a series of works titled 'pyramids' he had produced in the winter of 1959-60, a few months after Last Ladder. 1 l I will argue that the change that took place in the year or so around 1959-60, between the production of Last Ladder and the 'pyramid' series, represents.a decisive development in Andre's thinking that essentially consisted of his ridding his sculpture of any obvious sign of the involvement of his imagination or consciousness in its making. This development was closely related to his engagement with, and theorisation of, Frank Stella's stripe paintings. It was probably quite soon after Andre completed Last Ladder that he composed the short text that would serve, slightly altered, as the statement 'Preface to Stripe Painting' written for Stella for the catalogue of the exhibition 'Sixteen Americans' at the Museum of Modern Art, in which four of Stella's black stripe paintings were shown. In the context of a New York art world dominated by the gestural painting of the so-called 'second generation' of Abstract Expressionists, the apparent impersonality of Stella's stripe paintings was regarded as provocative and negative. Andre's text contributed to the provocation (it is registered in the contemporary critical discourse12) by dismissing 'expression' and 'sensitivity' in favour of the positive value, 'the 10. This definition of the symbolic is derived from the critical literature on the distinction between symbol and allegory as modes of representation.

The remade work was titled Cedar Piece (1964). All the original 'pyramids' were destroyed (not by Andre) quite soon after they were made. 12.

The visual resemblance between Stella's stripe paintings and Andre's 'pyramids' has often been remarked upon.14 Pyramid (Square Plan) (1959) (Fig. 2), to take one of the series, was constructed from 31-inch machine-sawn lengths of standard two- by four-inch construction timber stacked as a sequence of nineteen square/cross plan units, or tiers. The sculpture as a whole was three inches or so under six feet high. The first tier consisted of four lengths of timber each laid on its 'side' joined to form the sides of a square. Subsequent OXFORD ART JOURNAL 27.1 2004 67 S - Qur-; l</page><page sequence="6">Dominic Rahtz tiers were constructed, mortised at the joints at roughly one and half inches in from the previous tier, so that they stepped inwards on all sides. This sequence continued, the mortised intersections approaching the middle point of each length of timber, until it arrived at a tier that consisted of only two lengths of timber forming a cross. From this the pattern rose in reverse, symmetrically, so that the last tier - at the top - was, like the first, a square. This description corresponds more or less to how Pyramid would have been assembled-the tiers were separable, and would have just been stacked on top of one another. The tiers also could be, and were, stacked in another configuration in which the top and bottom tiers were crosses, and the middle was a square.ls The pattern that was built up consisted of a set of regular intervals that depended on the dimensions of the timber lengths (which were the same throughout) played out within two predetermined limits. Such a pattern also determined many of the earlier black stripe paintings, such as Die Fahne Hoch! (1959), in which the painted stripes, each the width of the housepainter's brush Stella used, were arranged according to the limits of the interior cross form and the rectangular shape of the canvas. Like the stripe paintings, Pyramid was made to appear as if its arrangement was merely mechanical, the result of an unthinking procedure of making based solely on the dimensions of its material constituents, which were predetermined by their 'real world' function as construction timbers. Inserted into an interpretative attitude to art dominated by form and expression, Pyramid, in its deflection of any formal or expressive criteria according to which it could be seen as the product of an imagination or even of a consciousness, must have appeared as if it itself had determined the procedure according to which it had been put together. This is not necessarily to deny the intentionality of the work, only to suggest that intentionality (that is, the signs of intentionality) may have been intentionally concealed by a procedure of making that appeared intentionless. Even the aspect of Pyramid that could be read in formal terms and hence possibly point beyond itself to the universal realm of form - the elongated 'X' shapes produced by the stepped end faces of the lengths of timber (which are similar to the virtual diagonals produced by the cumulative effect of a series of stripes echoing a corner in Stella's paintings) - is disconcerting because it can equally well be seen as merely the arbitrary and unconscious effect of the intervals of the steps. It is the pervasiveness of literality, the way it is taken up into its actual making, that distinguishes Pyramid from Last Ladder, and represents the decisive step in the development I am describing.l6 (In terms of effecting literality, it was less of a step to move from the stacked elements of Pyramid in 1959, and its remade version in 1964, to the more floor-bound placing together of elements that characterises virtually all of Andre's subsequent work.) The development consisted of a divergence from a work in which material was worked as if it were capable of formal or expressive meaning to one in which the material appeared to determine its own patterning, and where the relationships opened up by meaning or consciousness became either irrelevant or arbitrary. The literality of Last Ladder, that aspect of it that was simply left as it was, is not really the same as the literality that characterises Pyramid. The latter literality was rather one that was made, or re-made. Actually, I want to suggest that it was made out of the same resources that determined what I suggested was the symbolic significance of Last Ladder, that is, the mode of significance by which an existing material or a material existent can, through the involvement of the imagination, take on a meaning that transcends the literal particularity of its existence. These resources amount to a pervasive 15. Frampton, 'Dear Enno Develing', p. 10. See the photograph in Andre and Frampton, 12 Dialogues 1 962-1 963, p. I 1 5. 16. Pyramid does retain an amount of working and alteration of materials that disappears from Andre's subsequent work- the mortising, for example - but this is subservient to the effect of mechanical procedure. 68 OXFORD ART JOURNAL 27.1 2004</page><page sequence="7">Literality and Absence in the Work of Carl Andre interpretative attitude in art in which the imagination and consciousness, modes of representation and relation to the world centred on the self, are prior and privileged. The work of Pyramid took these modes and subjected them to a deflection that turned them back to a material literality that had nothing to do with them. The kind of interpretation based on the transformative capability of the imagination was frustrated by making the form of the work appear as if it were a mere pattern suggested by the material from which it was made. Consciousness was made an irrelevance through the use of an apparently unthinking and mechanical procedure. What I want to suggest here is that the effect of literality was one that was produced out of the resources of an interpretative paradigm centred on the self by introducing undecidability into what would properly serve as signs of self- the imaginative transformation of materials, the signs of conscious making, the signs of expressed feeling. This literality is, of course, not that of material simply left unaltered, nor that of the phenomenal literality of the work of Minimal Art as an object - it must be seen instead as a produced literality. Poetic Literality There is an important way then in which literality is produced through a negation of the figural. It might be objected, however, that the literality of Andre's work has nothing to do with such divergences and inversions at the level of meaning, and has all to do with what a particular work is materially or as an object. This sort of attribution of literality has been the basis of almost all the interpretations of Minimal Art, since the time it was produced and exhibited in New York in the mid to late 1 960s. The decisive interpretation, as far as later interpretations were concerned, was the critique of Minimal Art made by Michael Fried in his essays 'Shape as Form: Frank Stella's New Paintings' (1966) and 'Art and Objecthood' (1967). It was in 'Shape as Form' where Fried first used the word 'literalistn, coined as a derogatory description of the Minimalist position. Fried opposed literality as such with art, which had to be more- or other-than-literal (even as it acknowledged the literality it went beyond). Beyond this, the importance of Fried's critique for later interpretations was that he went on (in 'Art and Objecthood') to describe the literality of Minimal Art in terms of its appearance to a beholder, as a phenomenal literality.l7 Paradoxically, this view formed the basis of an important defence of Minimal Art developed by Annette Michelson and Rosalind Krauss in the late 1960s and early 1970s that appropriated the phenomenology of perception of the philosopher Maurice Merleau-Ponty. In this interpretation, it was the 'apodictic' phenomenality (to adopt a word used by Michelsonl8) of a Minimal work of art that occasioned an awareness of the conditions under which it was encountered. It also entailed a particular view of selfhood, since the self of the person encountering a Minimal work of art was defined reflexively through the act of perception.l9 This context-dependent view of Minimalism, which was based on an assumption of a phenomenal literality, or literal phenomenality, has come to constitute its dominant interpretation . As will be apparent from my consideration of the development of Andre's early work, I wish to resist seeing the literality of his work in this way. Rather than regard literality as that which defines a particular work materially or as an object, I am arguing that the literality concerned was negatively defined in relation to the properly figural mode that is said to define art. This goes against so many of the assumptions about the self-evident character of Minimalism's 17. See Fried, 'Shape as Form: Frank Stellats Irregular Polygons' (1966), and 'Art and Objecthood' (1967), both in Art and Objecthood. Fried would have adopted the word 'literal' in knowledge of Clement Greenberg's use of it to describe the actual surface of a canvas. A distinction should be maintained between this kind of surface, 'literal and utter flatness', and the flatness to which Greenberg famously said modernist painting 'oriented itself' which was necessarily a painted flatness, that is, a flatness co-present with illusion. (See Clement Greenberg, 'Modernist Painting' ( 1960), in The Collected Essays &amp;Criticism (Vol. 4): Modernism with a Vengeance, 1957-1969, ed. John O'Brian (University of Chicago Press: Chicago and London, 1986), pp. 87, 90.) Fried argued that the Minimalists had misinterpreted the development of modernist painting, partly due to an ambiguity in Greenberg's own formulations, taking this development as one that led to the condition of literality as such. 18.

However, one place to turn where doubt is cast on seeing the literality of Andre's work in terms of a material or phenomenal literality would be the parallel development that took place in his poetry, which underwent, in its move away from a lyrical self-expression towards a concern with the literality of words, a similar movement to that which took place in the sculpture. The consideration of language in the context of the development I have been describing complicates it considerably because the phenomenality of language is more usually seen as an attribute of what it means, the image it calls up, rather than what it is in its own terms. The literality of language - its existence in terms of itself, and not as representing something else - is usually concealed by the transparency of meaning, even though this transparency is purely a matter of convention. This means that for a literality to be produced in the realm of language, language has to be in some way prevented from meaning, that is, prevented from being language. It would be a mistake to regard Andre's writing of poetry as marginal or inconsequential in relation to his sculpture. For one thing, it is an important historical fact that the critical terms in which Minimal Art was first considered were set out mainly in writings by its practitioners (and not by critics). Unlike Judd or Morris, however, Andre was not a writer of art-critical prose, but nevertheless certain of his poems did serve as published 'statements' in art magazines and catalogues.20 More specifically, the formal parallel that took place in 1959-60 between Andre's sculptural and poetic production suggests that his work on both fronts was taken forward through analogising one with the other.21 By 1960, Andre had already quite a long-standing interest in poetry, but up until that year he had produced fairly conventional lyric poems, which he said had always 'originated in some conceit or observation or sentiment of my own' .22 By 1960, Andre was writing poetry very differently. It would have been during this year that Andre produced First Five Poems, which represented a beginning for him.23 First Five Poems consisted of five poems on five pages, each consisting of a single typewritten word (in lower case) - 'green', 'five', 'horn', 'eye', and 'sound' - placed at the centre of the page. Andre wrote, in a series of dialogues he composed with Frampton in 1962-63, that these were 'the first poems in which I took the English language for subject matter'. He went on: 'These poems begin in the qualities of words. Whole poems are made out of the many single poems we call words' .24 Andre seems to have wished to call poetic the originary act of associating a voiced sound (a word) and a thing, and the particularity of that association - the 'specificity of [the] referent'. At the same time, he criticised the more usual understanding of poetic language as an elevated, figural language, constituting a realm in which (poetic) associations are imagined. Poetic combinations of words, in pointing beyond the literal meaning of individual words, produced what Andre called a 'super-referent' (his example was the metaphorical sentence 'I am a red pansy').25 It might be concluded that Andre was interested in foregrounding literal meaning, the immediate relation of each word with what it stands for. 26 However, it appears that he was as much interested in the non-semantic literality of words themselves, though such a mode of existence was suggested negatively by confusing meaning. Each word Andre used in First Five Poems was intended to have more than one meaning-'green': the colour or a village green; 'sound': noise or Long Island Sound, and so on. Because each word had no context (it was presented singularly) this polysemy was directionless, and so in this way attention was drawn to the properties of the word itself. 27 Andre thought that in these poems he had achieved 'a kind of dissociation, an isolation of single words 20. For example, in Barbara Rose, 'ABC Art', Art in America, vol. 53, no. 5, October/ November 1965, p. 67, and in Kynaston McShine, Primary Structures (Jewish Museum: New York, 1966). 21. A recollection by Frampton certainly suggests this: 'Earlier poems had been freely rhymed lyrics; now he began taking texts and 'cutting' directly from them as from a timber, mapping upon words what he had learned from sculpture'.

Other attempts made to isolate the non-semantic literality of words had sometimes produced images suggested by the meanings of the words. For example, the word 'green' was also used in an earlier poem as part of the book Andre compiled in 1960, Passport,29 but there it was repeated to fill the whole page and this had the effect, in the case of this particular word, of suggesting a 'field'. Although this meaning coincided, as it were, with the literality of the word as it was presented, it also constituted a direction of meaning for that word.30 The single 'green' in First Five Poems represented a more radical step in isolating the literality of the word because the direction of meaning was made obscure (by the polysemy and the lack of context). It is important to note that the condition of literality could not be simply posited, but had to be produced through an act of 'dissociation' on the already existing convention that words mean. Another of the means by which Andre dissociated words from language was by the use of repetition. The monotonous repetition of a single word over a whole page deadened its meaning. This is the place to add that Andre's poems during the period under discussion were written with a typewriter, and he emphasised the qualities of typewritten letters to draw attention to the nature of the mechanical mode of inscription of his words, particularly the grid-like arrangement that the use of the typewriter entailed, the impersonal nature of which he reinforced by the use of repetition.31 Repetition was also used to ironise certain conventional literary forms, particularly the sonnet form. Sonnets, which can be defined as a sub-category of the lyric genre, are highly conventionalised forms, consisting of ten syllables per line (iambic pentameter), and fourteen lines, which are rhymed according to particular patterns. Andre had investigated this form in a poem that appeared in Passport, in which the word 'rain' was repeated in the form of a block, ten words across and fourteen down. He continued to investigate this form after First Five Poems in a set of poems called Twelve Sonnets, which probably also dates from 1960, in which a single word - 'earth', 'fuck', 'fire', 'water', 'me', 'you', 'air', 'age', 'death', and three others, possibly 'red', 'blue', and 'yellow' - was repeated according to the sonnet form (Fig. 3).32 The words corresponded to the number of required syllables of the sonnet form, and the requirement of rhyme was not so much affirmed or denied but made an irrelevance. Thus the conventional requirements of the sonnet form, a form usually associated with an expression of self, were both satisfied, in a literal-minded way, and negated, in the way that the conventionality was made to seem nonsensical and random, as if from an ironic position outside these requirements. Such a use of the sonnet form considerably complicate how the words that were so arranged are to be described in the same terms as First Five Poems. There were several strategies of 'dissociation' going on at once. The word that comprises each of the Twelve Sonnets was, like those in First Five Poems, isolated and detached from a context of other words that would circumscribe its meaning. It was also repeated according to the properties of typewritten letters, and arranged according to the conventional form of the sonnet, the significance of which as a form of expression was ironised. The temptation might be to see the resulting literality of words - their existence in their own terms as collections of letters-in phenomenal terms, but this would be to ignore the way that this literality is effected through reading, or rather through a frustration of reading. 28. Andre and Frampton, 12 Dialogues 1962- 1963, p. 76. 29. See note 23. 30. A similar thing could be said about the other poem in Passport, based on the word 'rain'. The word was repeated in the form of a block that, because of the nature of the typewriter, produced a series of vertical lines consisting of the repeated letters 'r' 'a' 'i' 'n' and the gaps between them. Verticality or the quality of falling would be the 'super-referent' in this case. It could be argued that these two poems were not that dissimilar from more traditional examples of concrete poetry in which the words follow a shape that bears a visual resemblance to what the words mean. 'rain' is reproduced in Lynda Morris, 'Carl Andre Poems 1958-1974', Studio International, vol. 190, no. 977, September/October 1975, p. 161. 31. Andre: 'A typewriter is essentially a grid'.

Twelve Sonnets, referred to by this name in Andre and Frampton, 12 Dialogues 1962-1963, almost certainly refers to the nine poems in sonnet form at the end of the book Shape and Structure 1960-65, and possibly to the further three poems in sonnet form in A Theory of Poetry 1960-65 (I have been unable to discover the original order of the sonnets). The other main grouping of poems in sonnet form is the whole of the book One Hundred Sonnets 1963.

Courtesy of Collection Tate Library, London. Poem by Carl Andre t Carl Andre/VAGA, New York. The concerns of First Five Poems and Twelve Sonnets with the dissociation of words, repetition and the ironising of poetic conventionality, continued in Andre's poetic work throughout the early 1960s. A number of conventional literary modes besides poetic forms were worked with, including the novel, historical narrative and autobiography.33 The development that concerns me here, implicit in the difference between First Five Poems and Twelve Sonnets, took place during 1960 when Andre had completed or nearly completed the series of 'pyramid' sculptures, and can serve as a means to reflect back on the development that resulted in those works. I suggested earlier that this development consisted in the divergence from a situation where material was worked as if it were capable of meaning, a meaning that implied the originating presence of an imagining or conscious self, to one where the material appeared to have patterned itself according to itself, and where an originating self 33. Andre produced, for instance, several circular 'autobiographical' poems consisting of arrangements of names (of people, places, etc.), rearrangements of historical narratixes (his Long History and Short Histoy are discussed in Andre and Frampton, 12 Dialogues 1962-1963, pp. 76- 8), and a novel, 'Billy Builder, or the Painfull Machine' (later published in Tracks, xol. 2, no. 3, Spring 1976, pp. 71-6, and vol. 2, no. 5, Fall 1976, pp. 53-67). 72 OXFORD ART JOURNAL 27.1 2004</page><page sequence="11">Literality and Absence in the Work of Carl Andre appeared to be absent. I argued that this literality of material self-patterning should, however, be understood as an effect produced negatively out of the same interpretative paradigm that had privileged the self as origin. The same divergence took place in the poetry, through the use of similar procedures. Words were presented in such a way as to deprive them of their directedness as meaning, and hence deprive them of their originating subject. Words were dissociated from the context of other words and combined according to an apparently mechanical and unthinking repetitiveness. At a formal level, the work performed on the material is almost identical to that in the sculpture. What the consideration of the poetry adds to the understanding of the development that took place in the sculpture is an awareness that literality and absence of self were effects produced at the level of 'language' and meaning rather than at the level of a phenomenal or material literality. It was well known, even at the time when Andre's sculpture began to receive critical attention in 1965-66, that Andre produced poetry, and critics have often felt the need to relate the two avenues of practice.34 The most insightful contemporary description of Andre's poetry, however, was written by Robert Smithson in 1968: 34. References to Andre's poetry appear in some of the key articles dealing with the emergence of Minimal Art, notably in Barbara Rose, 'ABC Art', Art in America, vol. 53, no. 5, October/November 1965, pp. 57-9, in Lucy Lippard, 'Rejective Art', Art International, vol. 5, no. 8, October 1966, pp. 33-7, and in David Bourdon, 'The Razed Sites of Carl Andre', Artforum, vol. 5, no. 2, October 1966, pp. 1F17. The articles by Rose and Bourdon each reproduced one of Andre's poems as an illustration rather than it being incorporated into the text. 35. Robert Smithson, 'A Museum of Language in the Vicinity of Art' (1968), in Jack Flam (ed.) Robert Smithson: The Collected Writings (University of California Press: Berkeley, 1996), pp. 79-80. Carl Andre's writings bury the mind under rigorous incantatory arrangements. Such a method smothers any reference to anything other than the words. Thoughts are crushed into a rubble of syncopated syllables. Reason becomes a powder of vowels and consonants. His words hold together without any sonority. Andre doesn't practice a 'dialectical materialism', but rather a 'metaphorical materialism'. The apparent sameness and toneless ordering of Andre's poems conceals a radical disorientation of grammar. Paradoxically his 'words' are charged with all the complication of oxymoron and hyperbole. Each poem is a 'grave¢, so to speak, for his metaphors. Semantics are driven out of his language in order to avoid meaning.35 In this paragraph, Smithson described how Andre's arrangements of words frustrated the notion that language was a medium of thought, making it seem as if it were part of the material world rather than something by means of which the experience of the world was shaped and understood. Andre's use of language 'bur[ied] the mind' through the procedure of what Smithson described as 'rigorous incantatory arrangements', ritualistic arrangements designed to enchant and to focus attention on the words rather than what these words meant. The references to 'rubble' and then 'powder' suggest that thought and language were regarded as constituting an edifice that was reduced, in Andre's poems, to undifferentiated matter, consisting of the elements of written language, i.e. letters (as opposed to sounds, hence Andre's words 'hold together without any sonority'). This extreme literality of inscription was achieved, Smithson thought, through the practice of a 'metaphorical materialism'. There is, of course, a sense in which Smithson was writing about Andre's work in the terms of his own metaphors for materiality. Yet the passage also makes one aware of the ways in which the literality of Andre's work (its usual definition in terms of what it was materially or as an object) could be effected at the level of the figural through various procedures of cancelling or rhetorical overdetermination ('oxymoron and hyperbole'). Smithson's phrase 'metaphorical materialism' captures the paradoxical nature of Andre's enterprise, both as a sculptor and a poet - a materialism, or literalism, conducted at the properly metaphorical or figural level of art. The Literal as Figural I have been arguing that the literality and absence of self in Andre's sculpture and poetry, attributed to his work by successive layers of interpretation, OXFORD ART JOURNAL 27.1 2004 73</page><page sequence="12">Dominic Rahtz should rather be understood from the point of view of its production as a rhetorical effect constructed from the already existing resources of the 'artistic' and 'poetic', that is to say, from the properly figural order of artistic representation. I am suggesting that the literality concerned should be recast at the level of the figural. Although this may sound like a contradiction in terms, I have already referred to certain formulations close to the production of Andre's work that state the figural character of its literality in a similarly contradictory way. Smithson's phrase 'metaphorical materialism' has the same sense of the contradictory coexistence of the elevated figural level of the poetic and the prefigural realm of the material as such. One also recalls Andre's own contention that a word is already a poem. In calling words poems, Andre would have been either proposing that the literal level of language should be elevated to the level of the poetic, or that this literal level was already poetic in character. Either way, the opposition and the apparent priority of the literal over the figural is undermined. The defining of literality36 usually involves some sort of claim to immediacy. The literal meaning of a word, for instance, is the one that most directly refers to what it stands for, as it is, without the detours, substitutions or reversals of figures and tropes (metaphor, metonymy, synecdoche, irony, and so on). The distinction between the literal and the figural, with one meaning directly and the other indirectly, presupposes a coherent and single 'reality' in relation to which the directness or indirectness of meaning can be measured. Thus the literal implies a 'truer', more immediate relation to this reality, whereas the figural, considered as a secondary elaboration of literal meaning, is more involuted in character, operating primarily in the realm of language. However, this order of priority depends on the assumed priority of what is meant (reality) over that which is used to mean (language). Looked at from the point of view of the priorness of language, however, literal meaning could be considered as a mode that, in its claim to immediacy, effects a divergence from the necessary mediacy of meaning through language. As effecting such a divergence, the literal could equally well be defined as a figure, but one defined by the denial of its own figurality. To demonstrate this, which has been one of the tasks of deconstruction,37 would be to effect an undecidability in the opposition between the literal and the figural as each could be substituted for the other without this impacting on the truthfulness of the meaning. When the opposition between literal and figural meaning is considered in relation to Minimal Art it needs to be put into slightly different terms. The literality attributed to Minimal Art was generally one of a condition of existing or appearing rather than of meaning, and this condition was opposed to the figural, or illusion. Furthermore, different claims to truthfulness are often held to apply in art, which is supposed to represent 'reality' truthfully but indirectly, in the figural modes of fiction or illusion. In this context, it was difficult to decide on the value of the literality attributed to Minimal Art-it was both valued for the truer sense it gave of 'real' existence as opposed to illusion, and at the same time criticised for its mere literality as opposed to the properly illusionistic mode of art.38 The relationship between literality and illusion, however, is subject to the same kind of instability as that between literal and figural meaning. Literality seen in the terms of existence or appearance presumes a coherent and single reality in the same way as literal meaning presumes a coherent and single reality, that is, as something according to which its immediacy as a relation can be measured. If such a presumption is not made, it becomes impossible to have literality as the condition of immediate existence or appearance, since it could equally well 36. The word 'literal' literally means 'of the letter' or 'of letters'. The Oxford English Dictionary defines 'literal' as '[p]ertaining to the 'letter' of scripture', and '[h]ence, by extension, applied to the etymological or the relatively primary sense of a word, or to the sense expressed by the actual wording of a passage, as distinguished from any metaphorical or merely suggested meaning'. 37. The relevant essays here would be Jacques Derrida, 'White Mythology: Metaphor in the Text of Philosophy' (1971), in Margins of Philosoph.y (1972), trans. Alan Bass (Harvester Press: Hemel Hempstead, 1982), and Paul de Man, 'Rhetoric of Tropes (Nietzsche)', in Allegories of Reading: Figural Language in Rousseau, Nietzsche, Rilke, and Proust (Yale University Press: New Haven and London, 1979). 38. In art critical terms, the former can be identified with the views of Judd and those critics who took his views on board, extending (with certain reservations) to the phenomenological interpretation of Krauss and Michelson. The latter can be identified primarily with Fried. For a consideration of the opposing views of Fried and Judd in the slightly different terms of anthropomorphism and anti- anthropomorphism, see J. M . Bernstein, 'Aporia of the Sensible: Art, Objecthood and Anthropomorphism', in Ian Heywood and Barry Sandywell (eds), Interpreting Visual Culture: Explorations in the Hermeneutics of the Visual (Routledge: London and New York, 1999), pp. 218-37. For Bernstein, anti- anthropomorphism has always inhabited modernism as the opposite of a humanly compelling conventionality (anthropomorphism), an opposition symptomatic of what he calls 'the aporia of the sensible' (the modern impossibility of reconciling understanding and feeling). Minimalism, as the 'artistic presentation' of (anti-anthropomorphic) literality, represents one late manifestation of this opposition. 74 OXFORD ART JOURNAL 27.1 2004</page><page sequence="13">Literality and Absence in the Work of Carl Andre consist in the illusionistic denial of illusion or the figural denial of the figural. One might say then that Minimal Art, as an art that projected literality, effected an undecidability as to its truthfulness as meaning or appearance, and in doing so, at that particular historical moment, produced a doubt as to the grounds for the truthfulness of art. Literality and Self I have suggested that in Andre's work the projection of literality and the absenting of self went hand in hand, that each was a function of the other. In the sculpture, literality was projected as the counterpart of a mechanical procedural attitude that did not appear to involve the transformative capability of the artistic imagination. In the poetry, the literality of words was projected as the counterpart of a dissociation of words from language in general as a medium of consciousness. The projection of literality and the absenting of self consisted in a figural divergence from the existing resources of an interpretative pattern that links the necessary figurality of artistic meaning to the presence of self. Thus, to return to the problematic posed at the beginning, the question of whether a presence or absence of self is interpreted in the work is one that depends on such a figural divergence and not simply on any statement of fact, either about the literality of the works concerned or indeed about the literality of Carl Andre himself. Modern artists, to borrow a phrase from Harold Rosenberg, manipulate materials as if they were meanings,39 hence, it could be added, modern works of art appear as if they are imbued with consciousness even when they do not appear to represent anything. The conventional understanding of art as 'poetic' in the sense of its elevatedness above the literal usually consists in an identity or continuity being posited between the consciousness of the artist and the materialised form of consciousness of the work itself, so that a given work is interpreted as an expression of self, rather than a mere collection of matter. In the mode of expression, the self of the artist retains its unity and status as the origin of the work and materials are manipulated as if they were capable of immediately and transparently conveying the presence of this original self. Yet this identity posited between self and material is open to question, since what are actually presented are metaphors or metonymies of self that really, since they stand in for the self, convey its absence. It could then be said that the codes of expression - distortion, the signs of spontaneity, touch, and so on - represent the self in such a way that its absence is figurally concealed. Deconstructed, the mode of expression is a figural mode that effects immediacy through the concealment of its own figurality.40 From such a point of view, there is not necessarily any correspondence between the materialised form of consciousness of a work of art and the consciousness of the artist. The apparent absence of self in Andre's work, and Minimal Art in general, would seem to have been produced in awareness of this insight. The material literality of the work, in the procedures by which it was made, and in the materials themselves, which were destined for use in the construction industries, apparently had no connection with a self. Later on, the question arose whether it was the industrial that was being represented in Minimal Art, but this only raised the further question of the attitude or the position behind the representation. Some critics, particularly on the left, complained that the literality of the representation by Andre, and especially by Judd, of the materials and techniques of the construction industries merely affirmed the values associated with American-style capitalist mass production.41 The absence of 39.

OXFORD ART JOURNAL 27.1 2004 75</page><page sequence="14">Dominic Rahtz self implied by material literality was associated with the lack of a critical distance (not to mention the lack of a political stance), this distance being one only opened up by a figural divergence in the act of representation. As far as the interpretation of a presence or absence of self in Minimal Art was concerned, there was little difference between seeing it in terms of a literality of existence or appearance and a literality of representation since each in its claim to immediacy precluded the involvement of self. The difficulty that the absence of self presents to an interpretation that would attribute a critical distance to Minimalism has been a recurrent feature of its criticism.42 I have argued, however, that to take the absence of self as the correlate of a material literality would be to take an unreflective view of the literality of the work. This literality, I have maintained, was effected as a figuring of the figural. One must not assume, however, that this figuring is a way of reintroducing the self, as the agent of such a figuring. This is because the opposition between self and absence of self is subject to the same uncertainty with respect to 'reality' that inhabits the opposition between the literal and the figural. A broad definition of selthood would say that it describes one's separate and conscious existence. An expression of self would be an exteriorisation of this separate and conscious existence necessarily understood in terms of an interiority, an 'inner something which is expressible',43 that exists prior to the event of expression. Understood in phenomenological and existential terms, however, the self has no such separate and prior existence, but arises as one term in a reflexive act. For Sartre, for instance, the self was a generalised linguistic category, the function of which was to 'refer' to the subject, defined as a particularity, a 'real existent'.44 In self-expression, which privileges the interiority of self as prior, the exterior 'language' - the historically developed technical and material resources of painting, say - is bent to the needs of this prior self, so that the resulting 'language' is considered personal and unique to it. In contrasting Andre's work to this mode, it would not be quite right to say that technical and material resources are simply left as they are without the involvement of self, but rather that these are bent to the needs of self-absence. When the self is defined as one term in a reflexive act, the absence of self will refer rather to the absence of the act of reference that defines it, rather than an absence of the subject as 'real existent'. It is here, in the self conceived in terms of an act of reference, that the literal and figural are implicated once more, since if one accepts the uncertainty that inhabits this opposition, one must also accept an uncertainty as to the literality or the figurality of the reference that defines the self. The value of Andre's work is that it does not conceal this uncertainty. Andre appears to have wished to produce an art defined by exteriority and the absence of self, but did so in terms of a cancellation of hitherto accepted signs of self, that is, the historically developed set of conventions according to which materials had been manipulated as if they were capable of meaning and hence could function as signs of consciousness. These signs of consciousness, constituting the available 'language' of art, were treated by Andre as if they themselves constituted mere material found in the world rather than as a medium through which his own experience of the world could be expressed. The question of whether the collections of material that Andre arrived at constituted a form of consciousness was one that was deliberately suspended, so that the context of interpretation into which they were inserted-that art is inconceivable except as a form of consciousness - was left in a state of uncertainty. The insight that this uncertainty provides is that there can be no literal reference, or immediacy of representation, that would deSne the self. 42. This is true, for instance, of Hal Foster's essay, 'The Crux of Minimalism', in Howard Singerman (ed.), Individuals: A Selected History of Contemporary Art 1945-1986 (Museum of Contemporary Art: Los Angeles, 1986), pp. 162-83. What was partly at issue for Foster was the problematic relation between literality and autonomy. Foster regarded Minimal Art as an 'historical crux', as simultaneously an end of modernism and a beginning of post-modernism. This meant that its condition was as much one of a modernist autonomy, in the sense that its literality effected a 'resistance' to the circulation of representations characteristic of the degraded society that modernism set itself against, as it was a post-modern critique of autonomy, in the sense that it made integral to itself the serial modes of production also characteristic of this society. The ambiguous result is that the modernist critical distance in Minimalism disappears when seen from the perspective of post-modernism and its post-modernist critical distance disappears when seen from that of modernism. 43.

One would also have to consider the way that certain of the most important early essays on post-modernism (which were published in the journal October, founded by Rosalind Krauss and Annette Michelson in 1976) took as a point of departure the valorising of what Fried had rejected in 'Art and Objecthood'.

On this question see Peter Osborne, 'Adorno and the Metaphysics of Modernism: the Problem of a "Postmodern" Art', in Andrew Benjamin (ed.), The Problems of Molernity: Adorno and Benjamin (Routledge: London, 1989), pp. 2348. For a consideration of the similarities in the views of Adorno and Fried in the context of a discussion of Minimal Art, see Alex Potts, The Sculptural Imagination: Figurative, Modernist, Minimalist (Yale University Press: New Haven and London, 2000), pp. l 99-206. The literality of Andre's work was such by virtue of its problematisation of the usual figural order that secured artistic meaningfulness, though it was figural in relation to this order, it put it in new terms. This seems a typically modernist strategy, to momentarily exceed the bounds of possible meaning. It is confusing, then, that Minimal Art has so often been made to represent a post-modernist beginning.45 This view hinges on how its literality is understood, and in particular whether it is understood as going beyond the properly figural character of modernist art. This certainly seemed to be the case with the interpretation by Krauss and Michelson that saw Minimal Art in terms of a phenomenal literality. Although this interpretation was partly derived from his writings, Fried did not quite reach this conclusion since he also understood Minimal Art as a 'misconstru[al]' of the development of modernist art.46 Whereas Krauss posited a new post-modernist mode of subjectivity that corresponded to Minimalism's phenomenal literality, Fried still understood the subjectivity of Minimal Art in modernist terms, that is, in terms of a sensibility that had become corrupted.47 One place where the attenuation, to the point of disappearance, of a subjectivity appropriate to modernist art is examined in its widest terms is in Adorno's later writing, particularly his Aesthetic Theory. For Adorno, the quality of literality represented a failure on the part of art to secure its separateness from life, and thus a failure to be properly modernist, or even properly art. If a work of art was literal it failed to distinguish itself from what it represented or else it failed to represent altogether and became simply a thing like any other thing. There was then no possibility of it pointing to anything other than a current state of things, and so no possibility of it occupying a position identifiable as separate and critical. Literality in art represented an embrace of the purely objective when it was only the subjective side of art that, through what Adorno termed 'mimesis', allowed for the possibility of another kind of existence to be imagined beyond the commodity- character of all things, including works of art, in modern capitalist society. In spite of the necessity of the subjective side of art, the development of modern art tended towards literality, which described not only its progressive reification (ultimately leading to the end of art), but also its regression to a condition prior to art. 'The literal [Buchstabliche] is barbaric', Adorno wrote at the end of a passage in Aesthetic Theory concerned with these two poles of artistic literality.48 It was essential to Adorno's definition of art that it appear to continue to be more or other than it was literally. The paradoxical situation of modern art was that it was only in this mode that it could be truthful, by representing an 'otherwise' to the existing commodity-character of a reified literality, whilst at the same time being necessarily constrained to manifest itself materially in terms of this literality. For Adorno, modernist art was defined by its self-consciousness with respect to this situation. In this account, an art that claimed to be post-modernist would be regarded as the total giving up of any position of separateness.49 It would seem that if Minimal Art was defined according to its literality, Adorno would have judged it harshly. However, certain of the means by which Andre produced the effect of literality in his sculpture and in his poetry - the use of a seemingly unthinking technique, the dissociation of words from language as a generalising medium of consciousness-were, for Adorno, authentic modernist techniques, present throughout its history. In an essay on OXFORD ART JOURNAL 27.1 2004 77</page><page sequence="16">Dominic Rahtz Holderlin, for instance, Adorno was drawn to the poet's use of parataxis, that is, an unconnectedness of expression, a mere seriality, which he saw as a response to the failure of a particularised subjective poetic expression to transcend the generalising character of language. It was a way of revealing language as it was, in its literality, not as something used by a self to shape its experience of the world. Yet Adorno went on to write that this technique of seriality allowed a freeing of language from this usual use, so as to allow language to speak momentarily for a self that could no longer speak for itself by these means.50 The literality of language thus becomes a possible realm in which a self, a form of consciousness, can be spoken. It has to be remembered, however, that literality can only be staged temporarily through the figural denial of meaning,Sl whether this takes place through the rhetorical use of parataxis or, in the case of Andre, through the use of a material self-patterning. In these techniques, a possible self could be said to momentarily exist at the same time as its apparent absence. 50. Theodor W.

The Historical and Contextual Studies Research Seminar series that they initiated at Wimbledon School of Art was also crucialfor working out some of the ideas contained here (especially the seminars on the themes of 'Intention' and 'Self'), and I would like to thank all the participants. I am gratefulfor the financial assistance offered by Wimbledon School of Art in theform of a Research Studentship. Finally, I am indebted to Diarmuid Costellofor his critical reading of an earlier draft. 78 OXFORD ART JOURNAL 27.1 2004</page></plain_text>
