<plain_text><page sequence="1">PROBES Peter Zhang HOMO FABER Full of merit, and yet poetically, dwells Man on this earth. - Friedrich Hölderlin1 A primordial retrieval of poiesis appropriation (the art and of "poetically" act of making) in this and context also the necessitates notion of homo the retrieval of poiesis (the art and act of making) and also the notion of homo faber - man the maker, man the "poet." In a nutshell, man makes things, makes an anthropomorphic world in the image of himself, and thereby makes himself. The Heideggerian line "Language is the house of being" is simply a parti- cular way of stating the more general idea that "A medium is an environment," which configures and shapes everything in it, or, better still, of its making, including man the dweller.2 Man dwells in his poems, his "fabulations" (Deleuze's term), his media (technological environment, including linguistic environment).3 Marshall McLuhan emphasizes that technologies are human through and through, rather than alien to humans.4 He goes so far as to say that "[t]he most human thing about us is our technology."5 For him, technolo- gies are humans' outerings and utterings, which in turn refashions and remakes humans.6 We are back to square one: man makes things (language, poems, images, gadgets, machines, robots, clothes, highways, bombs, coins, catheters, maps...) and thereby makes himself. This is a sentiment echoed by Richard Sennett in The Craftsman. Sennett points out, "people can learn about them- selves through the things they make."7 Kenneth Burke points out that man is "separated from his natural condi- tion by instruments of his own making."8 That is to say, man does not inhabit the Korzybskian territory; instead, he dwells primarily in his maps, his fabula- tions. The recalcitrance of the territory forces him to remake his maps now and then to keep them serviceable. Man has since busied himself with maps and second-order maps - maps about maps. This "busyness" is a sure indicator of his evolving (E. M. Cioran might say "increasingly degraded") humanness.9 Language is a mass medium, "in which the 'message' is not directed at an audience but through an audience. The audience is both show and the 95</page><page sequence="2">96 ETC • January 2012 message.... [As a mass medium, language] includes all who use it as part of the medium itself."10 In the last analysis, language is by the audience, for the audience, of the audience, and about the audience. The individual poet is simply a "medium" (as in the movie Ghost) for this "collective enunciation."11 There's a fundamental oneness between language and audience, or medium and audience in general, in the same way the archer, bow, arrow, mark, air, and distance form an integral, harmonious process for the Zen-minded.12 "It shot" instead of "I hit the target" - a serendipitous event in a larger immemor- ial eventing. To realize this is to detransitivize our syntax and, by extension, our Weltanschauung and to appreciate the Zen-mindedness of General Semantics and media ecology. Instead of a dualism, we need a monism. "Posthumanism" seems to be a superfluous term unless we'd like to deny how man came to be in the first place. Notes 1.
