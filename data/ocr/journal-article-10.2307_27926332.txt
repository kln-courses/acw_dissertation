<plain_text><page sequence="1">Philistine 'Anchor' Seals* Othmar Keel University of Fribourg, Switzerland Much attention has been devoted to the Early Iron Age in recent years,1 while the study of seal amulets dating from this period has been practically ignored.2 Apart from a couple of scarabs, believed to be inscribed with the names of late Ramesside kings and utilized for chronological purposes,3 only two seals from Philistine contexts have aroused any interest. One of these (Fig. 1) comes from Ashdod and 'bears signs that are tentatively related to the Cypro-Minoan script'.4 Shuval attempted to interpret the design of this seal as a figurative representation,5 drawing a parallel to a coarsely engraved linear seal from the uppermost stratum at Alalakh,6 although not * This article was translated from German by B.

The other seal (Fig. 7), discovered at Tel Batash, most probably depicts a lyre player. The shape of both seals can be described as a truncated pyramid on a roughly rectangular base. Only the base is engraved. Instead of trying once again to elucidate the iconographie content of the seals represented in Figs. 1 and 7 in a direct fashion, the author wishes to present 14 more seals of the same class which may aid in the interpretation of these seals. Because they resemble anchors in shape (see discussion), the name 'anchor seal' has been coined to facilitate the discussion. Many of the additional seals were published long ago and therefore have been largely overlooked; six (Nos. 2, 3, 5, 8, 9 and 11) are published here for the first time. This once again demonstrates to what extent the 're-excavation' of material can increase the data available for discussion. The wider the range of material, the more solid is the basis of the interpretation. CATALOGUE?

Although these items bear a certain resemblance to conoids, the almost rectangular base and flat sides clearly distinguish them. The small sides of Nos. 2 and 6 (both from Megiddo) are perpendicular and slightly convex. In this case, one is tempted to call them 'gables'. The objects are perforated breadthwide, with the exception of Nos. 7 and 15, and the somewhat later pieces (Nos. 13-14). The length of the base varies between 35 mm. (No. 15) and 11.3 mm. (No. 16), and the width between 26 mm. (No. 15) and 10 mm. (Nos. 10 and 16). The proportions differ widely, from a near-square (Nos. 3, 14 and 16) to a very elongated rectangle (No. 8). The height of the intact seals varies between 44.9 mm. (No. 8) and 11.8 mm. (No. 12). Despite the fact that the shape of a truncated pyramid is not particularly difficult to produce, it is rare in Palestinian seals.9 Its relative abundance in the Iron Age I is clearly connected with the appearance of conoids at that time. At the same time, the shape is that of the Late Bronze Age anchors found at many sites,10 and like them, most are perforated breadthwise (with the above-mentioned exceptions, two of which date from a later period). Small anchors were offered ? probably as a testimony and a sign of gratitude for having been saved from distress at sea ? in temples, such as the Temple of Ba'al at Ugarit.11 The Philistines were, at least for some time, a sea-faring people;12 thus, miniature anchors serving as amulets or votive offerings are not surprising. Appealing as it may be, however, 8 The tip (above the perforation) is broken away in Nos. 1, 2 and 7, but the shape can reasonably be restored according to the other five seals; moreover, seals in the shape of a true pyramid are unknown in our context. 9 Isolated specimens occur in the Neolithic and Chalcolithic periods; cf. H. Keel-Leu: Die fr?hsten Stempelsiegel Pal?stinas. Von den Anf?ngen bis zum Ende des 3. Jahrtausends, in O. Keel et al.: Studien zu den Stempelsiegeln aus Pal?stina/Israel II (Orbis Biblicus et Orientalis 88), Fribourg, Switzerland ? G?ttingen, 1988, No. 17 (ha-Gosherim) and the parallels cited there.

This interpretation would at least reasonably explain their unusual shape and perhaps the fact that only the base was decorated, in contrast to the type represented by Figs. 17-18. In fact, as 'seal amulets' they would have retained their meaning even if left plain. As for the votive and amuletic use of miniature household objects and tools, the Egyptian custom is noteworthy.13 Fig. 17. A seal purchased between Jaffa and Fig. 18. A conoid from Tell el-Far'ah (S), Ramie, depicting Ba'al/ Seth on a lion. a surface find from Cemetery 800, with graves dating primarily from the Nineteenth Dynasty. Another common factor is the manufacture of most of these seals out of limestone (with the exception of No. 6, made of steatite [if the indication is correct], No. 12, of alabaster, and No. 13, of green jasper); and with the exception of No. 11, all bear a linear engraving. Eleven of the 16 seals have a known stratigraphie context. Seven of these are stratigraphically dated to the twelfth/eleventh centuries B.C.E. (Nos. 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8 and 10), two to the eleventh/tenth centuries B.C.E. (Nos. 3 and 12) and two, for different reasons, dated later to the tenth/ninth centuries B.C.E. (Nos. 14 and 16). The group has to be considered as typical of Iron Age I, with some survivors still existing in Early Iron Age II. Seal No. 11, stratigraphically dated to the Roman period, is obviously out of context; Nos. 5, 9, 13 and 15 are surface finds. Instituts f?r Vorgeschichte der Univers?t Frankfurt a.M.

Seven of the seals come from Philistia proper, and the find-spots of the others (Tell en-Na?beh, Megiddo [particularly Stratum VIA], Tel Dan and even Tell Keisan) are also not without their Philistine connections.14 The decorative motifs clearly have different origins. The origin of the scene on seal No. 4 (Tell Qasile) is the easiest to trace: a good parallel for the human figure on the rudimentary animal can be found on an oval limestone plaque with handle from Stratum C (Late Bronze Age) at Tell Beit Mirsim.15 Its source should be sought in the image of Ba'al/Seth on a lion, not uncommon on Ramesside scarabs.16 The same deity can be seen on an Early Iron Age conoid, unfortunately not well preserved, from a Megiddo hoard (Fig. 19).17 The geometric division of the surface of this seal corresponds to a conoid from Tell el-Far'ah (S) (Fig. 18),18 whose surface is divided into four fields or metopes, and is decorated with motifs from the repertoire of Ramesside mass production:19 an imprecise spelling of jmn r' is given twice (without j). The other two fields contain the image of a lion and a triad of anthropomorphic deities (?). The base is decorated with the images Fig. 19. An Early Iron Age conoid from Megiddo. 14 For Tell en-Na?beh, Megiddo and Dan, see Dothan, pp. 54, 70 and 84, and the references there; for Tel Keisan, see Briend and Humbert, p. 229. The one from 'Akko is a surface find. The seals from Lachish and Samaria are late anyway. Still further north, in Kamid el-Loz, two 'anchor seals', one made of haematite and the other of bronze, were found in a cemetery of the fifth/fourth century B.C.E. See R.

The seal, a surface find, comes from Cemetery 800, with graves dating primarily from the Nineteenth Dynasty. A group of pyramidal seals which, unlike the 'anchor seals', each has a square base, engraved sides and a rounded top, may well be related to the conoids from Megiddo (Fig. 19) and Tell el-Far'ah (S) (Fig. 18). Let us mention two examples, one from Tell Qasile, the other from Tel Gerisa.20 The engraved motifs are again those of Ramesside mass production: the Tell Qasile piece even includes the depiction of the winged Ba'al/Seth (the Gerisa piece does not). Another seal belonging to the same group was purchased by Chester between Jaffa and Ramie and published by him in 1886 (Fig. 17).21 It depicts Ba'al/Seth, this time on a lion.22 In this iconography, Ba'al/Seth, on the Megiddo conoid (Fig. 19), falls into a category between the deity on Fig. 15 and the one on Fig. 4.23 Much schematized quadrupeds, like those on seals Nos. 12-15, are encountered on other Iron Age I seals, albeit still recognizable as lions or capridae.24 It is more difficult to reconstruct the development of No. 5. The two human figures saluting each other can be found on three Late Cypriote cylinder seals from Salamis.25 In all three examples an altar (?), missing in Fig. 5, can be seen in the centre of the motif. One of the figures in Fig. 5, however, has an animal's head, remotely reminiscent of the scarab from Tell el-Far'ah (S), depicting a Philistine (?) before an ovinocephalic deity of un-Egyptian appearance, perhaps meant to depict Amun.26 20 Shuval (above, . 5), pp. 72-76 and 123-124, Nos. 1-2 and further parallels from the antiquities market. 21 GJ.

The deity, like the one on the Tell el-Far'ah scarab and contrary to Egyptian custom, is looking to the left.27 If this figure is indeed lion-headed, it can be identified as Sekhmet. Amun would seem less likely, but considering the widespread use of cryptography in the Iron Age I, an acrophonic substitution of the m of Amun with m3y (lion)28 is not impossible. Anthropomorphic figures similar to the one on Fig. 6 can be found on locally made Late Bronze to Early Iron Age stamp seals from Beit Mirsim and Beth Shemesh.29 A partly preserved animal-shaped seal from Ashdod helps identify the very schematic scene on Fig. 7 as a lyre player.30 The base of the Ashdod piece has a more realistic (albeit linear) depiction of the same theme. A figure of a male lyre player also appears on the Ashdod musicians' stand, which came from the same stratum.31 A walking lyre player can be seen on the well-known Orpheus Vase' from Megiddo VIA (eleventh century B.C.E.).32 This motif seems to have been a favourite one in Philistine art, while in Late Bronze Age Canaanite art, female lyre players were preferred.33 In contrast, the style and iconography of No. 11 are purely Egyptian; it is also the only piece in our group that displays gouging.

Mazar related the singer, who, flanked by animals and plants, is accompanying himself on the lyre, to King Solomon (1 Kings 4:30-33), whose proverbs deal with animals and plants (B. Mazar: The 'Orpheus Jug' from Megiddo, in F.M. Cross et al. [eds.]: Magnolia Dei, The Mighty Acts of God: Essays on the Bible and Archaeology in Memory of G.E. Wright, New York, 1976, pp. 187-192). Dothan (pp. 150-153) adopted this interpretation. 33 The well-known victory celebration on a Megiddo ivory (G. Loud: The Megiddo Ivories, Chicago, 1939, PL 4 = ANEP 332) does not depict 'a man...playing a harp' (Mazar in Cross [above, n. 32], esp. p. 188), but a woman playing the lyre. Likewise, a lady plays the lyre on a fourteenth-thirteenth-century ivory from Kumidi (R. Hachmann et al: Fr?he Ph?niker im Libanon, Mainz, 1983, p. Ill, No. 1). While the missing link is, indeed, still missing, is it not possible that the eighth-century Lyre Player Group (G. B?chner and J. Boardman: Seals from Ischia and the Lyre Player Group, Jahrbuch des Deutschen Arch?ologischen Instituts 81 [1966], pp. 1-62; J. Boardman: The Lyre Player Group, An Encore, Arch?ologischer Anzeiger [1990], pp. 1-17) goes back to Philistine or kindred seals?</page><page sequence="13">PHILISTINE 'ANCHOR' SEALS 33 and iconography is the decoration of a scarab from the Matouk collection,34 consisting of a crocodile with nfr above it, perhaps another Amun cryptogram.35 The extremely schematized animals of Nos. 12-16 have close parallels on Late Bronze to Early Iron Age seals,36 as well as on objects of Ramesside mass production, like that of Fig. 18, and on Palestinian conoids and scaraboids of the Iron Age IIA.37 The somewhat particular design of No. 16 has its best parallel on a surface find from 'Akko.38 The stick in the hand of the man suggests that this is not the famous Minoan motif of a young man vaulting over a bull. The extremely schematized lyre player of seal No. 7 may suggest that Nos. 1 and 3 also display rather highly schematized figurative patterns (as Shuval prefers), rather than inscriptions. A human figure can perhaps be seen on No. 3, and, if so, it may be compared with a Late Bronze Age limestone seal from Beth Shemesh (Fig. 20).39 The engraving of No. 2 suggests that there remains also the possibility of purely linear patterns or a kind of pseudo-script.40 The X on Figs. 9 and 10 should probably be interpreted as a Semitic tau, which quite often seems to signify 'singled out', 'belonging to somebody', 'holy' (cf. Ezek. 9:4).41 In No. 8, which is from Dan, and not Philistia (but see n. 14), the decoration, consisting only of drillings and rectilinear incisions, also differs from the others.42 This piece may best be compared with a limestone seal from Tomb 4515 at 34 F.S.

The latter's base measures 26 18 mm. and its height is 25 mm.; it has no drilling for suspension, and the design is framed. The excavator dated the tomb to the New Kingdom and regarded the seal as 'very curious' and 'obviously un-Egyptian'.43 To sum up, our Iron I and IIA group exhibits, as far as the decoration is concerned, Late Bronze Age Canaanite traditions, that were taken over and developed further. Some of them are certainly, and some may be, of Egyptian origin, as suggested by the decoration of seals Nos. 4 and 11. As far as decoration is concerned, it is only the male lyre player (Fig. 7) ? if this is indeed what is depicted ? that can be considered as new and typically Philistine. Fig. 21.
