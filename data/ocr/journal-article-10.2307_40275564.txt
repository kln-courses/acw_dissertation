<plain_text><page sequence="1">roy brigden, Ploughs and Ploughing, Shire, 1998. 32 pp. £2.95; David hancock, Old Working Dogs, Shire, 1998. 32 pp. £2.95; ivan g. sparkes, Old Horseshoes, Shire, 1998. 32 pp. £2.95. These three volumes comprise reprints originally pub- lished in the 1970s and 1980s in the informative and lavishly-illustrated 'Shire' series. Brigden's rather breath- less run through the history of the plough from ard to three-point linkage includes much useful technical detail and an excellent section on the craft of ploughing itself, a craft whose mastery raised the dignity of the practi- tioner above the common run of labour. The development of the light 'Rotherham' plough, a defining moment in the history of British agriculture, occurred in response to the need to reduce draught power and as these implements became factory-produced, so their basic features were incorporated in ploughs for the next century or so. Nevertheless, the village ploughwright's craft was still required as ploughs evolved in accordance with regional and local needs and soil types. In the early nineteenth century, for example, visitors to local and national agricultural shows were able to inspect a great variety of ploughs, some matched to soil characteristics and others to seasonal requirements. Despite the appearance of steam ploughing in the 1870s, the self-lifting ploughs of the inter- war period and eventually of Harry Ferguson's mould-breaking three- point linkage system, ploughs were predominantly pulled by animal power from the Bronze age to the outbreak of Hitler's war. Draught animals, of course, needed to be shod, and Ivan Sparkes' Old Horseshoes traces the horseshoe from the Roman sola ferrea via the early nailed shoes of the fifth century, to the racing plates and ploughing shoes of the present day. In so doing he emphasizes both the variety of design and the ingenuity with which shoes met the conformational and veterinary needs of animals of different shapes and sizes. The far- rier's art seemed capable of accommodating every con- tingency from overshoes, mud shoes, leather shoes (for ponies dragging movers across genteel lawns), shoes for oxen, donkeys, laminitic animals and so on. I have long been impressed by those scholars who can sustain, over a long period, a narrow focus on the arcane and esoteric, particularly where this involves mastering a vocabulary of technical terms often of baffling complexity. Sparkes manages to write interestingly on the horseshoe without feeling the need to resort to the sort of exclusionist lan- guage employed by many commentators on equine and equestrian matters. So too does Colonel Hancock in his volume Old Working Dogs, meaning, incidentally, working dogs for- merly numerous, rather than working dogs stricken in years. Having been bitten by, mauled by, and generally pestered by dogs for a long while I am not over-ena- moured by the creatures. Yet I found Hancock's work of abiding interest. Whether he is describing terriers, shoot- ing dogs or pastoral working dogs, he writes with the sort of enthusiasm which one might expect of a regular contributor to Dogs Monthly. What is particularly re- markable (and this is paralleled in sheep, cattle, pigs and horses) is the steep decline in the number and range of local types, when the list of recognized Kennel Club breeds is compared with the situation in the past. If animals like the Sealyham, the Cardiganshire Corgi and the Sussex Spaniel are now numerically weak, the Wheaten Norfolk Heeler, the Antrim Glenwherry and the Sussex Bobtail are finally extinct, with the usual im- plications for genetic diversity. Like other volumes in the 'Shire' series, this is a most useful little reference work. I did not know, for example, that the Pembrokeshire Corgi probably originated from Swedish Vallhund blood introduced by early Scandinavian settlers in south Wales, or that that most unprepossessing of dogs, the Dandie Dinmont (chosen, peculiarly enough, for stardom by Scott in Guy Mannering), is close to extinction. Referring to the inevitable whiff of anthropomorphism among breeders of élite animals, Harriet Ritvo observed some ten years ago that in the pursuit of pedigree such people celebrated themselves as well as the breeds they were perpetuating. In this context I loved Colonel Hancock's rather sniffy references to the 'artisan sportsman' who prized Scottish Deerhound blood in their lurchers; men 'who show no respect for pedigree'. But the three vol- umes mentioned above lend lustre to the Shire pedigree, and one looks forward to more in the same vein. R. J. MOORE-COLYER</page></plain_text>
