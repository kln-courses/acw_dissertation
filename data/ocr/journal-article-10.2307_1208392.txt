<plain_text><page sequence="1">FEMINIST THEORY* In his introduction to the 1984 English translation of Julia Kristeva's Revolution in Poetic Language, Leon Roudiez writes: "Julia Kristeva is a compelling presence that critics and scholars can ignore only at the risk of intellectual sclerosis. She is also, among the major theo- reticians writing in France, the only woman - and that makes her con- tribution even more noteworthy as she challenges a long Western tradi- tion of male-dominated thought." To suggest that Kristeva is the only major woman theorist writing in France is to ignore the work of other women such as H6l6ne Cixous or Luce Irigaray. To consider her the only major theoretician to challenge "a long Western tradition of male- dominated thought" is to neglect the contributions currently being made by other feminist scholars. Thus the symptoms of "intellectual sclerosis" appear not only in critics' and scholars' blindness to a significant female theorist, but in their ignorance of the wide range of feminist critical theory. Kristeva came into prominence as the only woman associated with the avant-garde literary journal Tel Quel, which was decisive in launch- ing poststructuralism in France in the 1960s. She continues to remain the most frequently translated and the most widely read of what are now considered the major French feminist theorists. But the reasons for this are various: her original association with an influential, all- male intellectual vanguard, her marriage to one of its key figures, the *Luce Irigaray, Speculum of the Other Woman, trans.

Thus Kris- teva's position remains securely embedded within an intellectual tradi- tion where being a woman is not a problem as long as preoccupations with "the feminine" don't turn it into one. Irigaray, in contrast, has suffered exclusion from "the major theoreticians writing in France" because the position of "woman theorist" can still only be occupied by one woman, and in this case has not yet been vacated by Kristeva. In what she calls "Preliminaries" to Gynesis: Configurations of Woman and Modernity, Alice Jardine writes: "The women theorists in France whose work has had or is beginning to have a major impact on theories of writing and reading, and who at one level or another are writing about women, at the very least do not call themselves femi- nists. . . . The sole exception is Luce Irigaray- a special and complex case, one I shall reserve for close attention at a later date in another place" (20). Here Irigaray has not been excluded but secluded from the "women theorists in France" as an anomaly. Her situation reflects the much more precarious position of the feminist theorist; with the publication of Speculum in 1974 she was expelled from Lacan's Ecole freudienne and from her university teaching position at Vincennes. Jardine has chosen to defer rather than dismiss the discussion of Irigaray because she "calls herself a feminist." Unlike the other female theorists, Irigaray refuses to place herself and her work in opposition to or "beyond" "feminism," a concept "traditionally about a group of human beings in history whose identity is defined by that history's representation of sexual decidability" (20). As Jardine reminds us, each term of this definition has been put into question: history has become a text without a privileged relation to reality; and gender, no longer determined by biological sex but by the choice of a masculine or femi- nine subject position, has become largely undecidable. Thus Irigaray, by insisting on her position as a woman, remains imprisoned in a term that involves the "anti-theoretical and apolitical naturalizing of experi- ence" (42). In other words, she still believes that women, as women, share a nondiscursive experience as historical subjects. Although to some Irigaray is not yet "major" and to others she is still a "feminist," the English translations of Speculum of the Other Woman and This Sex Which Is Not One should be considered an important event for the readers of feminist theory. Those of us whose French copies of Irigaray are now stained and greying, whose English equivalents have always been limited to the short pieces translated in Signs, can now urge our colleagues and require our students to purchase 272 CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="3">the complete version in book form. Yet despite their glossy covers, the severity of design and sparseness of the critical apparatus of these books will probably fail to tempt the uninitiated. Without an introduction, and with a glossary of "selected" terms appearing only in This Sex Which Is Not One, these volumes will most likely cause those who have never heard of Irigaray to continue to turn a deaf ear. (One thinks of Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak's now legendary introduction to Of Grammatology, which launched the first English translation of the work of Jacques Derrida. Couldn't the initial appearance of Irigaray's works in English be construed as a comparable moment in publishing history?) Those of us who are now able to quote and teach from the English version are deeply indebted to both Gillian Gill and Catherine Porter for providing such superb translations of a prose style that requires as much attention as the most idiosyncratic poetry. (As a reader of Gill's preliminary attempts at translating Irigaray, I can only say that this difficult and enormous task has been accomplished with even greater dexterity and finer discrimination than those first few pages promised.) "The conventions of book-making in the English-speaking world" (Publisher's Note) have to a certain extent eroded the function of the feminist reader as a translator of dominant discourse. These conven- tions require tracing all the quotations from Freud, for instance, to their sources and providing them with exact page references. The French edition of Speculum, by failing to provide page numbers, allows for greater fluidity between the original text and Irigaray's commen- tary, between the structure of a male-centered theoretical system and its feminist deconstruction. In the English translation, the hierarchy that separates primary from secondary text becomes more pronounced, if no less problematic: does the original male text function as anxiety- provoking precursor or as impotent anachronism, victim of its own form of "intellectual sclerosis"? In spite of her dubious political position and the restrained intro- duction of her writings to English readers, Irigaray continues to hold "the speculum" up to the male Western philosophical tradition. Begin- ning with Freud's essay on femininity and ending with Plato's myth of the cave, she manages to unmask sexual difference as masquerade by insisting on the sexual indifference of philosophy to radical alterity. Woman falsely parades as different from man when in fact she is only his mimetic re-production, mimicking his sexual economy or "hom(m)o- sexualit6." By means of the speculum which conforms to the shape of the object it reflects, woman is able to engage in a process of specu- FEMINIST THEORY | 273</page><page sequence="4">larization: the female subject reflects on its own being rather than offer- ing the negative of itself in the reflection(s) of the masculine other. Thus the rules of representation are rewritten in order to subvert the significance of the gaze, which posits woman as having "nothing to see," and "the logic of the same," which makes her unrepresentable except as imitation. Speculum was published in 1974, followed three years later by a collection of essays titled This Sex Which Is Not One, originally intended as a shorter and more accessible sequel. The essays include interviews, transcripts from seminars, and lyrical prose pieces. Here the female sex which has never been one (i.e., a sex) resists definition by being "not one" but two. As two she is not the "second sex" but indivisible, since the two lips, both vaginal and oral, never exist as mimetic reproductions of each other, as original and copy. The essays would be the logical place to begin if one went in search of the meaning of Irigaray's work, and yet it is in Speculum that she demonstrates most forcefully her proficiency in deconstructive reading. What remains perhaps most compelling about Irigaray's work for the practicing feminist critic and/or theorist is the focus on sight as the controlling metaphor for thinking the presence and/or absence of the speaking subject. The idea that sexual difference is based on the visibility of difference bears most obviously on feminist film theory. There the female spectator has been theorized as initially appropriating or being appropriated by the male gaze (Laura Mulvey) and then as vacillating between two undecidable gender positions by adopting the gaze as masquerade (Mary Ann Doane). Linking the thinkable with the visible has additional ramifications for the cultural inscription of woman as visual icon. Thus it might begin to open up ways in which to analyze other forms of popular culture that rely exclusively on look- ing. Specularization as the necessary capability of the subject to reflect on its own being also suggests ways in which to think about the con- stitution of the female fictional subject in works by women writers. Rather than explaining female characters using predominantly psycho- logical paradigms, such as those of Nancy Chodorow, critics can begin to read the splitting of the female subject in less ontological terms. How do women writers use specular metaphors to constitute the female subject and at the same time to subvert the visual representations that have traditionally constructed her? The dual inscription of the female speaking subject, specifically as reader of and inscribed within the male text, is also of primary con- cern in Gynesis. Here Alice Jardine attempts to establish the connec- 274 | CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="5">tion between women as speaking and writing subjects and the "femi- nine" as inscribed in postmodern theory and fiction. The "postmodern condition," or modernity, as it is called in France, describes the episte- mological crisis of the postwar period, which involves crises in the legitimation of master narratives: scientific, historical, literary, and so forth. They have been recognized as narrated by men rather than as gender-neutral, and so their speaking subject, modes of represen- tation, and relation to truth all need to be rethought. As a result, the new internal or external "space" that represents the as yet "unthought" has come to be identified "as feminine, as woman." Although her concern is with woman, Jardine examines the feminine only in male texts: the theorists are all French, primarily Lacan, Derrida, and Deleuze, while the novelists are John Barth and Philippe Sollers. Jardine defines gynesis most simply as "the putting into discourse of 'woman' or the 'feminine' as problematic" (236). She elaborates: "the putting into discourse of 'woman' as the process diagnosed in France as intrinsic to the condition of modernity; indeed, the valori- zation of the feminine, woman, and her obligatory, that is, historical connotations, as somehow intrinsic to new and necessary modes of thinking, writing, speaking" (25). And elsewhere, "a new kind of writ- ing on the woman's body, a map of new spaces yet to be explored, with 'woman' supplying the only directions, the only images, upon which Postmodern man feels he can rely" (52). As the progression of quotations illustrates, there is no distinc- tion between "woman" and "the feminine." The "feminine" begins as problematic, becomes articulated as process, and is finally inscribed on the "woman's body." Where does that leave women, considering that the women's movement is largely held responsible for the identity crisis of "Postmodern Man"? The major female theorists are left out because their relation to the male theorists is both too parasitical, i.e., undeserving of special attention, and too complex, i.e., deserving of more pages. In addition, these women consider themselves "anti- and/or post-feminist." The "feminists" in France are termed "invisible" because they work "behind the scenes, in study groups and special seminars" (20). American feminist critics, still engaged in examining female characters in male and female texts, have not yet noticed that the author has died, narrative has lost its teleology, and characters have become nothing more than "name functions." How then do women participate in the process of gynesis, or do they? They do so almost exclusively as readers, as so-called feminist readers, who will recognize the gynema, the horizon toward which FEMINIST THEORY 275</page><page sequence="6">this process tends through "a state of uncertainty and sometimes of distrust" (25). For Jardine feminism becomes a philosophy of questions that addresses male texts with a kind of hesitant perplexity. She her- self repeatedly adopts a feminist position by conscientiously following up each of her readings with a series of interrogatives. For instance: Are gynesis and feminism in contradiction, or do they overlap and interact with each other, perhaps even render each other inevitable, in some way? In what sense do certain of the texts of gynesis reintroduce very familiar repre- sentations of women in spite of themselves? To what extent is the process designated as feminine by those texts absolutely dependent on those repre- sentations? When we posit that process as one incarnated by women, are we not falling back into the anthropomorphic (or gynomorphic?) images thinkers of modernity have been trying to disintegrate? etc. (26) With many of these questions left unanswered, the central question remains how to reconcile feminism, with its belief in character, plot, and ethics, with postmodern theory, which sees all three as anachronis- tic. Jardine's answer lies partly in difference: placing the two in contra- diction, hoping that there might be a way of reconciling ethical con- cerns with epistemological process without engaging in compromise. But mostly she resorts to deferral: leaving "the theories and practices of modernity, when taken up by female voices" (258) for later. The female theorists function as "palimpsest," are referred to in footnotes, are introduced in the "Afterwords." By suggesting that women will inscribe themselves differently in the process of gynesis, isn't Jardine positing "woman" as a naturalized category? By omitting women from this process, isn't she colluding in the exclusion of women from modernity? Like Kristeva's "semiotic," Jardine's "gynesis" is a new name for a space that posits the feminine by claiming it is only a position, adopt- able by anyone. Just as Kristeva's semiotic, which refers to pre-oedipal processes, has mistakenly, according to some, been associated with the feminine, Jardine's gynesis has difficulty associating itself with the feminist. In both cases a theoretical fiction is introduced in the hope of resolving a theoretical bind: how does one characterize the feminine without naming it? In both cases a female theorist theorizes the femi- nine either by not calling it that or by attributing it primarily to men. Jardine considers herself a feminist, yet does that label only refer to a discursive position? Doesn't it also imply that discourse perpetuates its own politics, whether enunciated or not? 276 I CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="7">Unlike the literal translations of Gill and Porter, Jardine's project involves translation as "transportation": theoretically it focuses on the "transportation" of the feminine into a male-dominated tradition of theoretical discourse; practically it involves the "transportation" of French feminist theory into an American academic context. Jardine suggests that "the (American) feminist in dialogue with (French) con- temporary theory" might be in the best position to effect this transla- tion. But is she? Doesn't this position, unless inherently antitheoretical, already have inscribed within it an imbalance of power, so that male texts will almost always be privileged over female ones, theory over fiction, French over American? Jardine has provided the first book-length discussion of the inter- section between the Anglo-American and French traditions of rethink- ing modernity and theorizing the feminine, and she has done it ex- tremely well: intelligibly, with insight and invention. The greatest strength of her work lies in the fact that she asks questions in ways they have never been asked before: what is the difference between the (French) participation in the process of gynesis and its (American) thematization? She pursues questions often avoided by feminist scholars in the academy: to whom and for whom are feminist critics actually writing? The most disappointing aspect of this book remains its exclusive focus on male texts, particularly for those of us who have followed Jardine's extensive work on Kristeva. That this was a necessary first step can only partially justify such an emphasis. One could wish for more daring. One thinks about men's increasing desire to occupy all gendered positions and their growing ability to do so through the aca- demic legitimation of feminist critical theory. One is left hoping that the activity of addressing the questions posed by female voices will not be postponed forever. Anne Herrmann University of Michigan FEMINIST THEORY | 277</page></plain_text>
