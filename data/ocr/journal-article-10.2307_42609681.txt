<plain_text><page sequence="1">110 RES BIBLIOGRAPH ICAE berit in Old Testament History and Theology (*) Dennis J. McCarthy - Rome Given the great interest in covenant in the Old Testament during the past decade and more, and especially the enthusiasm and the broad claims of some students of the problem, a book like this was surely in- evitable. It is exciting because it is a direct attack on much of the received wisdom concerning covenant. In truth, one must have reservations about many of the author's presuppositions; ideas about the nature of historical study, the value of the study of literary structures, the place of investigation of cultic and sociological settings of texts, and logical procedures, among others f1). It is also unfortunate that his judgments on the work of other scholars are sometimes couched in language which makes them sound much harsher than one imagines he intended. Still, the writing and the argumentation are brilliant, and what Perlitt has to say demands careful consideration. In so far as we accept it we will have to revise much of our basic ideas about covenant. But what does he say, and how far does it compel acceptance? Most striking, perhaps, is the flat rejection of the parallel between covenant and treaty which has become almost a commonplace. However, the larger, positive side of Perlitťs work is the more important. For one thing, Hebrew berît is given a meaning different from the conventional translation "covenant" (German Bund). Following E. Kutsch's work (2), Perlitt asserts that berît refers basically not to a relationship ( Verhältnis ) as our translations suggest; rather the basic meaning is "obligation" (Verpflichtung), which one may take on oneself or impose on another. Particularly, any idea of reciprocal obligation, while possible, is secondary to berit. Hence berît as a theological term means either Yahweh's commitment to Israel, often, in Deuteronomic (*) Review article on Iyothar PERUTT, Bundestheologie im Alten Testament (Wissenschaftliche Monographien zum Alten und Neuen Testament, 36). vin-300 S. 23,5x15,5.

(In view of the questions thus raised about the meaning of berît I have preferred to avoid translations and to retain the Hebrew word in transcription wherever possible in this article). So much for the definition or translation of berît. Perlitt goes on to propose a history of berît as a theological concept in the Old Testament. When was berît introduced into this theology? With the patriarchal stories? With Sinai? With the Davidic claims? No. With and by the Deuteronomic school! All significant uses of the word are said to belong to this school. This is argued as it should be: from a close study of the relevant texts in which Perlitt tries to show that any apparent exceptions to this rule are actually Deuteronomic interpolations into older contexts. Neither are the accounts of ceremonies in which a berît is said to have been made with or before Yah weh reflections of an authentically ancient Israelite (or Judean) tradition. Where this seems to be the case we are actually dealing with reflections of the desire to support the claims of the Deuteronomic law by representing it as having been promulgated by the highest public authorities. These exegetical arguments are buttressed by over-all historical considerations. The eighth and seventh centuries, the formative era of the Deuteronomic school, are the perfect setting for the development of the berît theology. The point is that the idea of parallel obligations, Y ah weh' s commitment to Israel by promise or oath and Israel's duty to obey the law, can be expressed by berît, and this idea offered a chance to explain the circumstances of the time. A people threatened in its identity as Yahweh's own favorite needed the reassurance of an explicit promise from Yah weh guaranteeing its position. At the same time, this insecurity of the people called for explanation, and this could be found in the implications of the demand for obedience and the threats attached to the failure to give it. berît enabled the Deuteronomic school to develop a complex theological idea perfectly adapted to the exigencies of the situation. This argument is important, but I am not sure that it will bear all the weight which Perlitt puts upon it. He often seems to be saying that the Deuteronomic era is the only conceivable setting for an idea, when, in fact, the most that can be said is that it is a good setting. Other settings can never be excluded on the basis of such general considerations. In any event, it will be seen that in many ways Perlitt's argument refurbishes the Wellhausenian scheme: a progression from older concep- tions of a connection with Yah weh in terms of natural relationships, through the prophets with their ethical demands, to a moralistic and legalistic idea of berît characteristic of the Deuteronomic school and later strata of the Old Testament. In fact, Perlitt actually goes farther than Wellhausen. The latter saw a complete change of concepts in the course of the development of Old Testament theology, but at least this was covered by the common name, "covenant". Perlitt will not allow even this continuity in name. The very word berît came only with the Deuteronomic school.</page><page sequence="3">112 D. J. McCarthy Neither the reminiscence of Wellhausen nor the radical low dating of berît is objectionable in itself. On the contrary, there is much to applaud here. For instance, even if one were not to deny that any reference at all to berît can be found in the oldest strata of the Sinai narratives, there is no doubt that these strata put their heaviest emphasis on theophany. On the other hand, there is equally little doubt that the concept of the conditional berît with all its consequences comes to the fore with the Deuteronomic school. I have long insisted that this is what the texts say. However, can we leave it at this? I think not. Perlitt himself emphasizes that the Sinai theophany, for instance, is gezielt. It has an end, a purpose. Is this entirely unrelated to what has been tradition- ally subsumed under the name "covenant?" This is quite doubtful, and it introduces a basic query which one must put to Perlitťs conclusions. Was there no evolution of the berît concept ? Not, was there no develop- ment of ideas which ended in a new concept and/or new name, berît (Perlitt would admit this), but, was there no development of the idea of berît itself (which Perlitt hardly allows fcr)? In other words, was berît a theological novelty, practically an invention of the Deuteronomic school? Was there nothing in history which prepared the word and the idea of berît for its role in the Deuteronomic writings? Without doubting for a moment the creativity of the Deuteronomists, I do wonder whether they produced things ex nihilo sui et subjecti. Nor is it entirely satisfactory to say with Wellhausen, as Perlitt does, that the berìt idea as used in the Deuteronomistic writings had its origins in an impulse from prophetism. The prophets do not favor the word bevît, and authors like Perlitt emphasize the problem which this fact raised for the view that prophetic thought was much influenced by berît ideas. True, but surely it works both ways. This is equally an argument against the claim that a prophetism to which berît was alien was the seedbed in which berît and related concepts developed. It seems much more likely that the stream of development included some explicit berît elements, even if these must be sought outside of prophetism. Or, if we are to grant that in this case it is simply a matter of similarity of ideas, that prophetic ideas were so like those subsumed under berît that the name is almost an accidental appendage to a well- established block of ideas, and that later berît ideas and prophetic morality were so alike that we have to admit a connection, we should be ready to admit that this sort of argument is valid in other cases. A set of ideas may exist and be identifiable in cases where a common word fails. I have in mind the meal of the elders in Kx 24,11. Partic- ularly if we are to read this passage in connection with Ex 18,12 it seems impossible to avoid the thought of the covenant meal of the nomads even though the word berît does not occur. In other words, a primitive passage has already introduced covenant thinking into the description of Israel's encounter with Yahweh. This is a method which does allow us to trace ways of thinking related to covenant in Old Testament strata older than the prophets. An overly rigid insistence that the word</page><page sequence="4">berît in Old Testament History and Theology 113 must occur before one can admit the presence of the concept is question- able. However, it is true that Ex 24,11 is a particularly clear case, and the mode of argumentation is in general delicate. It must be pursued in a detail impossible here, and so I shall make no more of the point. But it is something which should not be neglected in further studies. Right now it is better to look to more concrete points. One of these is the occurrence of the very word berît. Perlitt insists that the word is applied to Yah weh and Israel only in documents of the Deuter onomic age and later. Is this the case? The crucial texts in the search for an answer to this question are Hos 6,7 and 8,1; Gn 15,18; Ex 19,5; 24,7.8; 34,10.27.28; and 2 Sm 23,5. According to Perlitt the first text from Hosea does not refer to a berît involving Yahweh and Israel; all the others are Deuteronomic or later. If this is so, there is no case for a pre-Deuter onomic use of berît for Yahweh-Israel connec- tion. But is it so? In Hos 6,7 it is true that berît, if it means the berît with Yahweh, is unusual. In normal prose it would be berîtî. One trouble is that the normal prose in this connection is Deuteronomic, and we are asking about the possibility of antecedents to Deuteronomic usage. To treat the normal prose usage as an iron law is to prejudge the case. Must Hosea have conformed to (later) normal usage and said berîtîi I cannot escape the feeling that Perlitt would confidently assert that the passage is a Deuter onomizing interpolation, if this were the case. In other words, the appeal to normal prose usage to argue that berît here cannot refer to a Yahweh berît is in danger of begging the question. Moreover, we are not dealing with normal prose. This is poetry in which the weight of imagery and of parallelism must be respected. "Behold, they have walked over the covenant like dirt; lo, they have betrayed me!" (x). The figure is vivid and concrete in the first half- verse, and there is no reason to doubt that this is true in the second. "Betrayed" is no generality to be interpreted in the light of parallel passages. It is concrete. It means transgression of the berìt so that one must think of the berît as "my berît" since to transgress it is to "betray me". It is no argument against this that bgd in other contexts is used of sexual infidelity (e.g., Hos 5,7; Jer 3,8) or generically (e.g., Jer 5,11; 12,1). That is what the parallelism in these other passages indicates. Here we have a different bit of poetry which demands interpretation according to its own individual structure. In the light of this passage we must give bgd a new nuance and not impoverish the passage to make it conform to others. And so we have an argument that Hosea does indeed speak of a berît which is Yahweh's. If anything, this is even clearer in Hos 8,1. Not that the details of its meaning are clear in every respect, but it is at least certain that lb equates transgression of "my berît" with violation of "my torà" in a Yahweh speech. This usage, of course, is immediately suspect. If the f1) For the translation, especially k^ãdãm, "like dirt", see M. J.

McCarthy suffix with berît and especially the equating of berît and torà are ineluc- tably Deuteronomic, then the passage is a post-Hosean interpolation. But once again there is danger of taking what is to be proved as the means of proof. The context should support the claim that berîtî is a sure sign of a Deuteronomistic hand. Otherwise we are reduced to saying that berîtî is Deuteronomistic because berîtî is Deuteronomistic. Now, in Hos 8,1, there is hardly question of a Deuteronomistic context. Deuteronomistic writers, whatever else they were, tended to be clear, and Hos 8,1 is notably obscure. It is easier to imagine traditionists garbling a difficult poetic passage than it is to imagine a Deuteronomistic interpolator composing gibberish or indulging in obscurantist poetry. As Perlitt himself says in another context (speaking of Ex 24,1): "ein Ergänzer hätte es besser gekonnt'' . One might also remark that a willingness to consider the pos- sibilities of interpreting berìt in the light of wider biblical and ancient oriental usage could help in the understanding of this difficult passage. The "colorless" expression tob in 8,3 is not really a rather empty generality unworthy of the prophet-poet. The root is one which is characteristic of treaty contexts, where it refers to something like comity or good relations between the parties (x). Hosea knew precisely what Israel had cast off: its special relationship to Yah weh. One cannot avoid the conclusion that Hosea knew of a Yah weh berît. This does not mean that Deuteronomistic writers, influenced though they were by Hosean ideas, did not develop the berît concept further, but it does mean that they were working out of a tradition and that the history of berìt in Old Testament theology was really an evolution of a concept. The Hosean passage, with its variant terminology and similar ideas, is a clear step in this evolution. Perhaps the case is less clear with the passages from the Pentateuch. They do have elements which relate to Deuteronomistic usage. But it is surely over-facile to classify them as Deuteronomistic for this reason, for they also have elements which are wholly uncharacteristic of Deut- eronomistic usage. If we have to choose one horn of the dilemma or another, Deuteronomistic or non-Deuteronomistic, we could as reason- ably choose the latter as the former. But it is surely more reasonable to recognize the peculiar character of these passages. They are Deut- eronomistic and un-Deuteronomistic. Where should we expect such a combination? Why not in pre-Deuteronomistic passages where neither the language nor the thought has reached the purity of later developments? Once more, there are indications that berît theology did not spring full-armed from Deuteronomistic brains. It was a complex thing which had a history much older than its Deuteronomistic expression. I,et us look at the pertinent passages. (*) See W. L. Moran, "A Note on the Treaty Terminology of the Sefire Stelas", JNES 22 (1963) 173-176, and D. Hillers, "A Note on Some Treaty Terminology in the Old Testament", BASOR 176 (1964) 46-47.</page><page sequence="6">berît in Old Testament History and Theology 115 First Gen 15,18, which has commonly been attributed to J. Given the problems with the analysis of the chapter, however, one would not wish to insist over-much on this attribution. The way, then, is open to another attribution. In our case, according to Perlitt everything comes down to the probable dating of the berît ritual which comes to a climax in verse 18, and the point is well taken. Perlitt sees the ritual as parallel to that described in Jer 34 and similar to that mentioned in the treaty between Mati-ilu of Arpad and Assyria in the 8th century B.C. This parallelism would seem to indicate that far from being primitive, uralt, the rite is characteristic of the 1st millennium. However, it is not clear that this conclusion takes due regard of all the details involved, for, since there is no doubt that oath ceremonies involving the slaughter of animals were practiced in the second millennium as well as the first, a dating through parallelism is only valid if it establishes that the rite described has properties peculiar to a particular era. Thus it must be shown that the characteristic details of the rite described in Gen 15 and the mentality behind it are those of the 1st millennium. Now, the Mati-ilu text hardly proves anything. It does not deal explicitly with a precise ritual involving passing through the parts of the slaughtered beasts. Rather it establishes the general fact of a belief in ritual or magic identification which is surely not the peculiar pro- perty of the 1st millennium. This is a timeless idea operative in the 2nd as well as the 1st millennium and still alive today. As for the ritual in Jer 34, it does involve the practice of passing between the parts of the animals. The trouble is, the details are not quite the same as those in Gen 15. In Jeremiah's rite it is a case of passing between the halves of animals cut in two. In Gen 15 they are cut into three parts, or, less likely, severed in three places to produce four parts (x) . This may seem an unimportant difference, and the symbolism of mixing with the carcasses may be the same in either case. However, given the extreme importance of detail in the practice of ritual, it is not safe to assume so without further thought. In fact, such is the nature of ritual belief that a seemingly minor variation in a meaningful gesture can mean a significant change in the ritual. Nor is this the only point to notice. In Jer 34, as in the Mati-ilu treaty, the meaning of the ritual is made explicit. Not so in Gen 15. The rite is presented as though its meaning were self-evident. Its efficacity needs no explanation. And of course the stage at which a rite is accepted as effective without explanation is generally older than that in which it needs some sort of verbal explanation. There is another factor which seems to point to the relative antiquity of the rite as described in Gen 15. This is its anthropomorphism. In itself there is no problem with Yahweh's passing symbolically among the slaughtered beasts and provisionally identifying himself with their fate. This is no more - but no less - illogical than ascribing a verbal (!) See H. Cazeu,ES, "Connexions et structure de Gen. XV", RB 69 (1962) 321-349.</page><page sequence="7">116 D. J. McCarthy oath with its conditional self-curse to Yahweh. However, the vivid im- agery does raise something of a problem. A mind that can accept the verbal anthropomorphism because its meaning is veiled by familiarity will still notice the oddity of a pictorial representation of the same thing. Now, it is actually possible to see the description of the firebrand and furnace passing among the chopped-up parts of the animals in Gen 15 as a step away from anthropomorphism. At least Yahweh does something different from what a man would do in the circumstances: pass among several parts rather than between two, and he does it not in human shape but symbolically. His act is not quite human, but is it the sort of thing Deuter onomists would imagine? They are not keen on ritual. Why picture such an odd rite at such an important juncture? And is it really possible that the Deuteronomic school, after experiencing the process of demythologization which has left its traces in 1 Kgs 19, for example, would be the ones to identify Yahweh with torch and furnace and make him act parallel to the way a man would ? Someone did this, but hardly a true Deuter onomist. This may not demonstrate that Gen 15,18 is older than the Deuteronomic school, but it does argue that the passage must be ascribed to another source, and there are signs that it is older. More, the sources for the patriarchal stories are generally much older than Deuteronomy. The burden of proof would seem to be on one who wished to take this one important passage as an exception to the rule. Gn 15 is a non-Deuteronomic reference to a Yahweh berît, and probably an ancient one. Theology must consider this in any effort to understand the berît concept over its whole range. Another key text is Ex 19,5. Without a doubt the actual distich, "hear my voice and keep my beríť' sounds thoroughly Deuteronomistic. So also the basic idea of the whole passage, 19,3-8, which must be con- sidered as a whole. This is, of course, the idea of a reward conditioned on obedience. Still, there is much in the passage that does not sound Deuteronomistic. Expressions like "house of Jacob and sons of Israel", "what I did to Egypt", "brought you to me", and "a kingdom of priests and a holy people" are very unusual or in some cases unique. This argues strongly for a separation from the highly stereotyped language of the Deuteronomic school which had regular but different expressions for what is said in these phrases. To say that these latter are almost like something Deuteronomistic is actually to emphasize their divergence from the normal Deuteronomistic ways of writing. Simply as an exercise in literary criticism, assigning the passage to a Deuteronomistic source without further ado is to over-simplify. If we go beyond criticism to interpretation, ignoring the singular elements of a highly poetic pas- sage like this and treating it as another example of a stereotype means we will miss the richness of meaning which it has to offer. Certainly a complete theology of berìt in the Old Testament will have to take ac- count of the special nuances which a passage like this adds to the concept. Simply to reduce it to its Deuteronomistic elements is to impoverish the theology which we build on it. This is true even if one were to deny that poetic passages of this sort have every chance of being the sort</page><page sequence="8">berît in Old Testament History and Theology 117 of thing from which Deuteronomistic theology developed and so represent a stage of evolution older than the Deuteronomistic, as I believe. In any case, they are something more than Deuteronomistic, and a complete theology of b*rtt will have to cover this added factor. In Ex 24,7 and 8 Perlitt argues that the first is a Deuteronomistic interpretation of the ritual scene, and that the second is an even later addition to the pericope seeking to tie verse 7 more closely to 6 and to complete the picture of the ceremony. This is ingenious, but it is not entirely convincing. Perhaps 7 is an interpolation, but surely 8 is the natural sequel to 6. In it the ceremony is completed as it should be, by the proper use of the rest of the blood, the half that was not applied to the altar. It is really hard to believe that this second half of the symbolic blood had no role in the ritual even though its conservation in the vessels is so carefully noted. This seems to be confirmed by the language, seper habberìt in 7 does sound like the Deuteronomic school, as we might expect in an interpolation, but on the other hand dam habberît in 8 sounds very un-Deuteronomic. The phrase is unusual, and its ritualism and mysticism is very far from characteristic of the Deut- eronomic school. If 24,7 is a comment marked by a Deuteronomistic vocabulary, 24,8 is not, and we are up against what may well be called a key text for berît theology. Here the concept which sees berît as es- sentially a matter of law and obedience is face to face with another and older concept which sees berìt in ritual and mystic terms. I have argued elsewhere and I would repeat that these are not mutually exclu- sive views. Seen in proper order, they complement one another and demand a complex view of berît. A full theology of berît will not suppress the difference but include it. The result may be a rather more cum- bersome picture, a less systematic whole, than we can achieve by confining berît to the Deuteronomistic view of it, but that is the price of completeness. Ex 34 is a harder case. The analysis is extraordinarily difficult, and there are elements which do recall the Deuteronomic school. This may be true of the emphasis on a written berìt in 34,37 and 28, though one does wonder if the tablets are a Deuteronomistic conception. Be this as it may, the theophany resists reduction to a Deuteronomistic hand. Even the epithets given to Yah weh in 34,7, though perhaps not part of the primitive mise en scène with the simple proclamation of the divine name, are not Deuteronomistic (see A. Jepsen, Z AW 79 [1967] 289), and at least 10a: "Behold, I am making a covenant'', has every chance of being a continuation of that proclamation. At least one is justified in having suspicions of an analysis in which every decision in the difficult process falls against the possibility of a non- Deuteronomistic origin of a phrase mentioning berît. In 2 Sam 23,5 we move from the Pentateuch to an entirely different literature which offers a surer case in a different doctrinal area. This is royal ideology. Now, it may be that the reference to berìt in verse 5 is an interpolation within an ancient poem. However, the sequence of thought and images does not demand this conclusion. The reference</page><page sequence="9">118 D. J. McCarthy fits the context well. The real reason for doubting its authenticity- is that elsewhere berít eôlãm is found in later contexts. Does this prove that the passage is a late addition to the poem, or is this the sort of context in which the idea and the phrase berít 'ôlãm arose? I submit that the royal ideology is an obvious place in which the idea and the name could have developed. This ideology emphasized the permanence of the royal prerogatives on the basis of Yahweh's favor, as the royal psalms amply demonstrate. How is this better summed up than in the phrase berít eôlãm, "enduring commitment?". Surely, when a phrase fits its immediate literary context as this one does, and when the idea it expresses is natural to the world to which that context belongs as it is here, it is dubious method to resort to the hypothesis of interpolation. It is far more likely that this is evidence for another element in berît theology, an element tying it to royal ideology. Once more that theology is seen to be more complex and richer. The texts, then, resist the attempt to attribute every allusion to a Yahweh berît to a Deuteronomistic hand. They demand that we take account of the berìt idea in relation to Abraham, to Sinai, to David, and in Hosea. This is what the evidence points to, and it is a more satisfactory state of affairs than the claim that berît is exclusive to the Deuteronomic school. It is easier to believe that a relatively unused concept already in existence was developed by later thinkers than that one was made up out of whole cloth. The same thing is true in the case of ceremonies involving berît. I yield to no one in my scepticism about the existence of an elaborate "covenant cult" at the center of ancient Israelite religious practice. The explicit evidence simply indicates that other things were at the center of that practice. However, this does not mean that one should reject the importance of the cult out of hand. It may not have been something exclusive to Israel, but it was central to Israelite religion from the first, and, as in all religious traditions in history, it had a profound influence on Israelite thought and expression. Israel went to school to the liturgy as well as to the wisemen and the prophets. The fact that scholars have overvalued the cultic influence does not justify our undervaluing it, and I fear that this is what Perlitt does (See Bundes- theologie, 128, which is paraphrased here). Rightly rejecting exaggerated claims for the place of a study of the cult in reconstructing the history of Old Testament theology, claims based usually on hypothetical re- constructions of a cult which is not directly described, he fails to notice the possibilities which are opened by the study of the limited but con- crete data about Israelite religious usage which the texts do provide. Specifically, an aversion to excessive claims for a covenant cult should not close our eyes to the evidence for a modest but real place for b'rît ceremonies in the public religious life of Israel. Perlitt has to deny this, for, if berît is to be a purely Deuteronomistic idea in the religious sphere, it cannot have belonged to the regular exercises of religion which are older than Deuteronomy. As for that, I can only repeat: it is antecedently more likely that the Deuteronomic school</page><page sequence="10">berît in Old Testament History and Theology 119 used a religious concept it found rather than that it imposed a new one. But apart from what seems likely, what do the texts say? Here 2 Kgs 23,1-3 is crucial for Perlitt. He thinks that in this text "hat Dtr dem Dt den Makel des Nichtoffizielles der vorexilischen dt Predigt genommen" in giving "der Gehalt der dt Predigt einer Insti- tutionalisierung" (p. 11). This was achieved by picturing the very king of Judah in the act of imposing the Deuteronomic Code. All other similar scenes will have been modelled on this. The central point is the commitment to keep the law., and this has an exact parallel, for instance, in Neh 8-10, where we find a sworn acceptance of the obligation to keep the law. The parallel is revealing. No doubt the action de- scribed in Neh 8-10, like that in Ex 10, was stimulated by the record of Josiah's berît. But the parallel is not quite exact, pace Wellhausen. In Nehemiah the people enter into a written contract to observe a known law code. The contractual formality is alien to older berît usage (1). Nor is this the only difference in the details of the scenes. In Nehemiah the whole people represented by a large number of leaders literally sub- scribe to a contract to keep the law (notice that there is no mention of berU). They do this under oath, but there is no mention of Yahweh by name. The scene in Ezra is much the same, though berît is mentioned: law, oath, active cooperation by the people. In 2 Kgs 23 one leader imposes a law in the presence of many notables but without there being any sign of the group's entering actively into the process. There is no mention of oath, but the king's act is done "before Yahweh". In the one case acceptance, in the other imposition; in the one, group ac- tion, in the other individual action; in the one an explicit oath, in the other not; in the one, no mention of Yahweh, in the other explicit mention. The law seems a little different in the two cases also. In Nehemiah it is something familiar. One regrets not having lived by it and pledges a reform. There is no need for an authoritative imposition, nor is there anyone who imposes. In Kings the law is unfamiliar, and someone has to impose it. berît is given a new interpretation in detail and from above. All things considered, the two scenes are similar but not identical. This can be explained, but it is to be explained historically. Notice the action. In 2 Kgs 23 Josiah is presented as exercising a power. He may be redefining the berîtt but he has an accepted power to impose it. Where is this paralleled? Not in Nehemiah, but in 2 Kgs 11,17, where a single leader, the high-priest, makes a berît for the people. There is no oath, but Yahweh is mentioned. The modalities are those of Josiah's action, an authoritative imposition on a passive people. The difference in the earlier scene from Kings is in the relatively unspecified berît. It is not yet something as concrete and detailed as the law. All this constitutes a coherent historical tradition about public berît ceremonies. There was development as the structure of society i1) See Gene M. Tucker, "Covenant Forms and Contract Forms", VT 15 (1965) 487-503.</page><page sequence="11">120 E). J. McCarthy changed. The role of authority shrank as time went on and the com- munity took an active role. The concept of berît also changed. It meant a generalized obligation, then a detailed law that was still an innovation, and finally a code which was not a new regulation but a timeless absolute to which one renewed allegiance. This is the way historical institutions develop. It shows that making a berît with Yah weh was part of the religious experience and the religious vocabulary of Judah. Thus the evidence of religious practice marches with the testimony of the texts to pre-Deuteronomic uses of berìt in relation to Yahweh. berît may not have been ubiquitous, but it did have a place in religious life as well as religious literature. Hence it was available for theological development. It did not need to be invented. A final point seems to be relevant to this question of over-reaction to possible exaggerations. There has, of course, been a great deal of writing based on the supposed analogy between Old Testament berît and the ancient treaty. No doubt too much has been claimed for the analogy, and, especially, illegitimate historical conclusions have been drawn from it. Still, this does not invalidate such evidence as there is for the analogy, nor does it justify a claim that the . .Sitz eines religösen Textes im Leben ist vollkommen uninteressant ohne . . . Beachtung der geschichtlichen Erstreckung. . . dieses 'Lebens' " (p. 83). This is too absolute. We can never neglect the historical dimension, but there are many cases in which it is impossible to determine the his- torical context of a passage or even of a genre. It may still be possible to discern a sociological setting, and this can be a valuable instrument of interpretation. One thinks of Gerstenberger's explanation of "apod- ictic law" in terms of the timeless wisdom of the clans (x). I believe that the treaty analogy could be a similar case, even though it were impossible to date the era in which the treaty concept began to exercise a large influence. In fact, the treaty concept will be found to have been at work particularly in the Deuteronomic era, but even apart from this historical aspect of the matter, recognizing the treaty analogy is a useful aid to interpretation. This must be demonstrated in the actual practice of exegesis, but one can point to some of the more obvious examples. We have already seen that recognition of the treaty analogy reveals the fuller significance of the supposedly colorless tôb in Hos 8,3. It gives a more accurate and meaningful content to 9hb, "love", in the Deuteronomistic writings. It must be considered in interpreting Dt 29,24-28 and the context, for these verses are practically a quotation from an inscription of Ashur- banipal describing the effects of violating a treaty. And surely Dt 28,1-2.15 at least must be read in the light of the exact parallels in the treaty literature as indicating, if not a relationship to Yahweh conceived as a treaty, a conditional possession of the land which is scarcely di- (x) E.

The parallels along with the rhythmic form of the verses do not prove that the verses and the idea they embody are older than the Deuteronomic school - proof in matters of this sort is always a will-o'-the-wisp - but they point in this direction. They can hardly be treated as a Deuteronomistic invention without further ado, and this means that we cannot too quickly claim that Israel's conditioned possession of the land is a purely Deuteronomistic idea (as Perlitt does: p. 34). Apart from details, recognition of the treaty character of the Deuteronomistic view of the connections between Israel, Yahweh, and the land helps us to realize the poignancy of the complex of theological ideas and historical situation. Here was a vassal people in the As- syrian empire who knew from the experience of daily life, not just from religious theory, what loyalty to the lord demanded and how fearful could be the consequences of disloyalty. The explanation which the Deuteronomic school offered of Israel's obligations, of its dependence on its lord, of the reasons for the threat to the people's very existence had the solidity and vividness of vital experience. Once again, ac- cepting an added connotation of berît will complicate our theology, but that is the price of completeness and richness. To conclude: one will agree with Perlitt so far as he insists that the widespread and repeated use of berît as an interpretative category in Old Testament theology, and particularly the use of berît to point up the law and obedience as conditions for being the people of Yahweh, is a later element characteristic of the Deuteronomic school. However, this does not exhaust the history of berìt in Old Testament thought, nor does it exhaust the content of the concept. In earlier stages it is true that berît was just one of a number of theological concepts and not necessarily the most important. It existed without being all-pervading and all -explaining. This existence, modest though it may have been, must be taken into account. The Sinai accounts point to a ritual, mystic element in the berît concept that forbids merely equating it with law and obligation. 2 Sam 23,5 connects it with the royal tradition. Hos 8,3 may well make explicit use of treaty terminology. In view of this evidence Perlitt's view of the history of berît as a theological concept must be judged incomplete because it fails to include the pre- Deuteronomic levels. As for the content of the concept, the Deuteronomic school's emphasis on law and obedience is important, but it does not exhaust the concept. In view of the treaty analogy and its influence on the thought of the school, this is true even of the use of berìt in Deutero- nomistic writings. Here, but even more in other strata, we have to take account of the aspects of love and loyalty, rite and mystic union. As with the history, so with the meaning of berît.
