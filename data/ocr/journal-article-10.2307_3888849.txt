Gainesville: University of Florida Press. ?45 hardback. ISBN 0-8130-1384-4. Distributed by Eurospan University Press Group. "At the university they had a lot of funny ethnological cliches. One of them was about how much European mathematics was indebted to ancient folk culture; just look at the pyramids, whose geometry commands respect and admiration. This, of course, is idiocy disguised as a pat on the back. Technological culture is superior in the very reality it defines. The seven to eight rules of thumb of the Egyptian surveyors is abacus mathematics compared to integral calculus. Any race of people that allows itself to be measured on a grade scale designed by European science will appear to be a culture of higher primates. Grading is meaningless. Every attempt to compare cultures with the intention of determining which is the most developed will never be anything other than one more [...] projection of Western culture's hatred of its own shadows" (Peter H0eg, Miss Smilla's Feeling for Snow). Peter Schmidt's edited volume The Culture &amp; Technology of African Iron Production is a book that everyone professionally interested in African metallurgy will read, if they have not done so already. It is a book that I can also recommend to non-specialists interested in the history of African metal technology because it represents a summary of the past two decades of research in this field. I read it with a mixture of delight and misgiving. The delight stems from the lucid writing of some of the chapters, the clarity of presentation of what could have been formidable technical analyses, and the overall presentation with its almost total lack of typographic mistakes. My misgivings are in response to realising how little headway has been made in these years, in terms both of our understanding and our intentions in studying African metallurgy. This collection presents a mixture of old and new. Three of the thirteen chapters are reprints while ten are new. Many of these were first presented at two symposia at the African Studies meetings in 1988. African archaeometallurgists will be familiar with much of the contents, and may be peeved at finding themselves paying for papers they already have, but it is undeniably useful to have the set reprinted together for the sake of an overview. Sociologists of science and other non-archaeologist readers may find this collection fascinating. The first half is solid anthropology while the second half is largely taken up with the unresolved academic squabble about the so-called 'pre-heating' hypothesis, which the juxtaposition of old and new papers in the second half of the volume is intended to address. To my mind this debate is more revealing about the state of African archaeometallurgy than it is about African technology, something I will consider in more detail later. Peter Schmidt's preface starts by stating his personal agenda: ";This book provides a new way of viewing the history of iron technology in Africa. The perception of African iron technology as backward compared to that of Europe is an artifact of Western thought. This book replaces this perspective with a recuperated history based on fine-grained ethnographic studies and informed technological research" (p. xv). He elaborates on this theme in the first chapter which describes the emergence during the past twenty years of our understanding of the fascinating integration of myth, ritual, and technology that characterises African metallurgy. This comprehensive and very useful review is strongly coloured by Schmidt's preoccupation with demonstrating the primacy of his vision of sophistication in African metallurgy and should be read cautiously with this in mind. When confronted by colleagues' scepticism Schmidt resorts to demonising his perceived opposition. "Why such important scientific observations have not been incorporated into mainstream historical and archaeological writing is [...] explained by the fact that such ideas challenge the conventional orthodoxy held by those who control the production and dissemination of knowledge about Africa" (p. 21). Really? Perhaps a majority of archaeometallurgists are just sincerely unconvinced by his claims for early complexity and sophistication in African metallurgy. In the second chapter, titled "How old is the Iron Age in central Africa", De Maret and Thiry tackle the question of the chronology of African metallurgy, trying to make sense of three sources of information: radiocarbon dates derived from charcoal associated with smelting, comparative smelting technology and ethnography, and comparative linguistics. Superficially these would seem to form a powerful tool for unravelling the complexities of human migration, technological borrowing, and local craft development in Africa. In practice the detailed history of African metallurgy is so complex that the scraps of information at hand don't even begin to form a coherent picture, other than that metallurgy appeared later in southern Africa than it did in central or west Africa. This doesn't constitute an advance in knowledge over the past twenty years. Charcoal radiocarbon dates suffer from inherent imprecision due to historical 14C fluctuations and the possible use of old wood. Comparative smelting technology and ethnography so far have made use of superficial physical resemblances in the worst tradition of spurious association. And so far comparative linguistics has failed to do more than confirm broad trends defined by the first archaeological appearance of metal. Numerous descriptive studies of smelting, similar to several in this book, have shown that metallurgy is a labile cultural component, capable of rapid stylistic variation in an unpredictable way. Until we have a very large number of paired thermoluminescence and radiocarbon dates for smelting sites the chronology of African metallurgy probably will remain unresolved. I think we should give it up and concentrate on the more interesting and tractable question of what people did with their technology. That is what Goucher and Herbert do in their chapter on "The blooms of Banjeli: technology and gender in west African iron making", an accompaniment and follow-up to their film The Blooms of Banjeli (Saltman et al. 1986). The film of their work in the Bassar region of Togo is already a classic, and this chapter complements it superbly. It is concise and comprehensive, and charmingly conjures up recollected images of the film. The authors manage the trick of writing in the first person without</page><page sequence="2">South African Archaeological Bulletin 115 being obtrusive, relating their observations with a convincing detachment devoid of self-importance, and carefully identifying their own presumptions and speculations. It is a model to emulate. Bardon's chapter on "Fipa ironworking and its technological style" is a good sequel. This is also a concise but detailed description of iron smelting in western Tanzania, a two-stage process apparently very similar to that of the Chewa in Malawi, described in detail elsewhere by Van der Merwe &amp; Avery (1987). This chapter is soundly based on the prevailing theoretical understanding of the relationships between technology and culture. Because it is particularly well illustrated the author can concentrate on the ethnography and rituals of Fipa smelting without dwelling more than necessary on the physical description of the process. "Reconfiguring the Barongo: reproductive symbolism and reproduction among a work association of iron smelters" is by far the longest chapter in the book. In it Peter Schmidt makes some very pertinent points about the Barongo ironworkers south of Lake Victoria. His discussion of their history, identity, and role in regional trade makes excellent reading and his observation that Barongo smelters recycled slag vigorously is a very important caution to those who try to estimate production volumes from ancient slag heaps. He then he goes on to describe in great detail a team of Barongo smiths trying to get their smelting reconstruction to work. Their improvisations are recast as an essay in innovation, leading to a generalised lesson that "technological bricolage is the modus operandi in a world that always presents challenges" (p. 122). This is a truism touted as insight. A group of smelters who haven't smelted iron for thirty years can be excused for serial inconsistencies and failed production, as Peter Schmidt recognises at the beginning of the chapter, and then goes on to ignore for another 52 pages. Relief is at hand in the form of David and Robinson's "Competition and change in two traditional African iron industries". This is a closely observed account of the shift of control of iron smithing from Montagnard to Muslim societies in North Cameroon. This provides a modern ethnographic parallel to numerous archaeological observations of such technological successions and shifting of cultural boundaries. This paper clearly spells out the characteristics that might enable archaeologists to recognise similar processes of change in the archaeological record, and also makes predictions as to the future of the Muslim and Montagnard smiths. It is satisfyingly symmetrical without being forced. The next chapter, "Forging symbolic meaning in Zaire and Zimbabwe", by Childs and Dewey, is largely a reworking of Childs' 1991 paper. It sets out to demonstrate that cultural values can be embodied in iron object fabrication and use, and to compare the mani- festation of this phenomenon in two central African areas, namely Zaire and Zimbabwe. The chapter concentrates on the production and use of axes, both utilitarian and symbolic. The reproductive symbolism embodied in anthropomorphic furnace decoration is echoed in the ornamentation of some axe blades and haft decorations, but the symbolism associated with iron objects also extends to embody secular and divine power in a web of interrelated associations and meanings. This chapter is also particularly well illustrated, including a wonderfully eloquent photograph taken in Zimbabwe of a veteran of the 1896-97 war handing a ceremonial axe to the leaders of the nationalist movement in 1962. Half way through the book the tide turns and the second half is concerned with the technicalities of iron smelting. These chapters will be of interest primarily to archaeometallurgists, or sociologists and historians wishing to analyse the tracks of a fledgling science trying to get off the ground. Three of the remaining six chapters contain reprints of four previously published papers, in one instance partly rewritten, so I shall not review them in detail. These are Schmidt &amp; Avery's "Complex iron smelting and prehistoric culture in Tanzania", Schmidt &amp; Childs' "Actualistic models for interpretation of two Early Iron Age industrial sites in northwestern Tanzania", Rehder's "Use of preheated air in primitive furnaces: comment on the views of Avery and Schmidt", and Avery &amp; Schmidt's "Use of Preheated air in ancient and recent African iron smelting furnaces: a reply to Rehder". These chapters will only be necessary reading for those who wish to follow the preheating debate and have not already chewed over the original papers a multitude of times. These papers debate the proposition that archaeological remains and modern smelting reconstructions reveal that Africans smelters in northern Tanzania employed pre- heated air some 1000 years before it was invented in Europe at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. The proposition hinges on Avery and Schmidt's claim that the contemporary Haya practise a form of advantageous preheating of air as it enters the smelting furnace through long air pipes that project almost to the centre of the furnace. It is true that the pipes are positioned in this way, but whether the inblown air is heated to any appreciable extent before it emerges into the furnace chamber is still a matter of hot contention. It is also not clear what thermodynamic advantage such heating of air would have, because the energy required to heat it originates in the furnace chamber and presumably would be available to heat it there anyway if the air were to arrive cold. Obviously the physical conditions are difficult to monitor in situ, and the only laboratory tests that have been done (Childs &amp; Schmidt 1985, omitted from this volume) were inadequate to decide the matter. The debate has now reached a theoretical stalemate and, as Killick points out in his chapter "On claims for 'advanced' ironworking technology in precolonial Africa", it is surprising that the fundamental principle has not been tested in a laboratory. Avery &amp; Schmidt's rejoinder in the following chapter, "Preheating: practice or illusion", is that "A laboratory approach will never provide a definitive proof, as laboratory conditions can never hope to replicate those of the field" (p. 276). Coming from a metallurgist and an anthropologist this seems disingenuous. If it were true then all experimental science would be a sham, and no physical principles could be tested in the laboratory using simplified models. In the final chapter, "Technological history and culture in western Tanzania" Childs presents beautifully illustrated metallographic analyses (carried out in an American laboratory) in support of the preheating hypothesis and identifies a legacy of complex smelting processes which appear to be a mixture of bloomery and blast furnace operation. Hers is exemplary archaeometallurgical work, applying modern metallography to archaeological and smelting reconstruction products in an attempt to elucidate the actual mechanisms that characterise the processes used and in so doing describing the smelting and smithing processes themselves. This she does conscious of the particular social context in which these practices were carried out. By extrapolating from the ethnographic present to the past via the thread of continuity provided by the microstructure of the artefacts themselves, she can speculate meaningfully about social developments that</page><page sequence="3">116 South African Archaeological Bulletin possibly accompanied past technological change. There is much to praise in this book, and much that is provocative. It may not provide a "new way of viewing the history of iron technology in Africa" but it certainly exemplifies particular fashions in African archaeo- metallurgy. In connection with the first half of the book I wonder precisely what it is anthropologists think they are doing when they record commissioned smelting reconstructions. 'Salvage ethnography' has become fashionable with the realisation that the last active African smelters are a rapidly dying breed. Their residual knowledge, apparently remarkably complete in some cases, warrants being recorded in as much detail as possible simply as a record of what was, and to inform our reconstructions of the more distant past. No-one can believe that they are recording unadulterated historical practices or that the details of ritual will be uniform from one smelting episode to another. The primary value of Peter Schmidt's chapter on the Barongo is that it demonstrates very clearly that people will improvise when they wish to fulfill requests, or be paid, for re-enacting traditional smelting practices. It is fallacious to assume that a single smelting enactment can characterise an historical practice, as I have pointed out before in the context of copper smelting (Miller 1994). Memory is plastic, constructed and reconstructed con- tinuously by performance and recall, and tends to be elaborated with the passage of time. Wiseman &amp; Lamont (1996) demonstrate this very accessibly in their discussion about eye witness accounts of the Indian rope-trick, which become increasingly elaborate with elapsed time. The American 'recovered memory' debacle is another case in point. The anthropological problem lies not simply in coming to terms with the gloomy fact of dynamically rejuvenated memory, but in trying to separate the expedient improvisation in smelting reconstructions from the real variability that may have been acceptable in the historical process. Of course this can't be done and our records will always be adulterated by the attrition of time and the intervention of the observer. The moral is not to over-interpret the observations and elevate possibly trivial aspects of a performance to general practice. The second half of this book raises many unresolved issues, only one of which I will deal with here. To me there is a patronising arrogance in trying to "recuperate" African history. Words like "sophisticated", "advanced", "complex" do not have absolute values. These are words used to promote an image of Africa's past for which the referent is always modern Europe. The desire to redress perceived historical wrongs by demonstrating African primacy is inevitably patronising, and sadly ironic considering the presumably good intentions of the protagonists. In studying African metallurgy comparisons with Europe and Western industrialisation are specious and always tellingly one-sided. Why do Africanists not write comparative tracts about the relative cultural impoverishment of the West, exemplified by the modern preoccupation with the utilitarian nature of metal and metal objects? Why are African metal technologies not compared to each other with such value-laden ter- minology? There are manifestly benevolent political agendas at work in the brave comparison with Europe, but it is an intrinsically unfair comparison which serves no- one's interests well. Instead of trying to elevate the craft of African metallurgy to a sophisticated technology with attendant notions of analytical insight, perhaps we could more profitably concentrate on describing what it was that African smelters and smiths actually did, attempt to reconstruct their technical and mystical goals and preoccupations, and try to understand the social fabric of their lives, controlled by conceptions of value very different from those familiar to Western-trained scholars.
