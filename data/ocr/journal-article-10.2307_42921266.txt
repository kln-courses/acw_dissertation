While social media creates an important momentum for firms to cultivate favorable awareness by establishing a powerful framework of stakeholder relationships, the opportunities are not dis- tributed evenly for all firms. In this paper, we investigate the impact of CSR credentials on the effectiveness of social media as a stakeholder-relationship management platform. The analysis of Fortune 500 companies in the Twitter sphere reveals that a higher CSR rating is a strong indicator of an earlier adoption, a faster establishment of online presence (followers), a higher responsiveness to the firm's identity (replies and mentions), and a stronger virality of the messages (retweets). Incidentally, the higher CSIR rating is also found to be associated with the stronger vi- rality. Our findings also suggest that socially responsible firms can harvest proactive stakeholders' participation (user-driven communication) without investing more resources (firm-driven communication). As the first study that conceptualizes the social media as a proponent of CSR, this paper contends that "being socially responsible" K.

Keywords CSR • CSIR • Social media • Twitter Introduction A large group of researchers who advocate an instrumental impact of corporate social responsibility (CSR) on business contend that, by engaging in CSR activities, firms obtain a wide range of business benefits such as positive attitudes (e.g., purchase, seeking employment, investment), a favorable brand image, and advocacy behaviors (Fombrun et al. 2000; Lichtenstein et al. 2004; Sen et al. 2006; Du et al. 2010). Without a doubt, these benefits are contingent on the stakeholders' awareness and their favorable attri- bution of the firms' CSR activities. However, the aware- ness of the firms' CSR among external (as well as internal) stakeholders is generally low and stakeholders easily become skeptical when firms aggressively promote their CSR efforts (Du et al. 2010). The propagation of "self- serving" ethical claims or "green washing" often leads to an undesirable cynicism from their audiences. These are important impediments to attaining instrumental benefit of CSR activities. In this respect, the key challenge for securing the business benefits from CSR lies in maximizing the awareness of the firms' activities among the stake- holders, while minimizing the skepticism. The rise of social media presents unprecedented opportunities for firms to increase the public awareness (Kaplan and Haenlein 2010). By expanding the range of participation to a much broader scale, social media switches the focus of stakeholder management from the traditionally well-known groups to the numerous and often Ô Springer</page><page sequence="2">792 K. Lee et al. anonymous groups of "friends" and "followers" (Freeman and Moutchnik 2013). For many firms, this new wave is translated into a novel opportunity to engage stakeholders (Callahan 1988). Hence, it is imperative for firms to successfully integrate the new media into their extant communication strategy. For most firms, however, it is a serious challenge. Researchers argue that earned media (e.g., social media) should operate differently from bought media (e.g., advertising) (Kietzmann et al. 201 1). Many studies inves- tigate the factors that facilitate the successful adoption and use of social media. For instance, Berger and Milkman (2009) found that the social transmission (i.e., virality) of online contents is driven largely by physiological arousal associated with the key characteristic of the messages. Kaplan and Haenlein (2011) argued that virality emerges when right people (social hubs) get the right messages (memorable and interesting) under the right circumstances (messengers pass on a message when they believe it is not something everyone in their network already knows about). By the right circumstances , Kaplan and Haenlein (2011) referred to a network structure containing many discon- nected subcultures that would effectively pass on the seed messages. And yet, they added one caveat in their description of the right circumstances. "In order to glue everything together", they wrote, "some plain old good luck" is necessary. In order to illustrate this point, they cited an ambitious online campaign launched by Starbucks in 2009. To spread its message, Starbucks challenged people to hunt for the advertising posters and be the first to post a photo of one using Twitter. Unexpectedly, some of its customers, encouraged by a liberal activist Robert Greenwald, began to upload their pictures holding signs criticizing Starbucks' anti-labor practices and soon the campaign site was cov- ered with anti-Starbucks messages (recited from Kaplan and Haenlein 2011). While this indeed illustrates some components of bad luck, we suspect that there are some factors that facilitate, or impede, the inception of such a bad luck. What if Starbucks did not have the anti-labor business practices from the start? What if Starbucks was concealing more outrageous ethical deficiencies than what was challenged by the liberal activist? Perhaps social media does not merely function as a value-neutral technical means of communication. As social media operates on the collective mind of participants, it may implicitly incorpo- rate a social demand that reflects the collective mind. When it comes to a firm, such a social demand may have much to overlap with the notion of CSR. In fact, many studies emphasize ethical qualities such as "being honest" (Kaplan and Haenlein 2010), "trying not to deceive or outsmart other users", or "acting transparent" (Callahan 1988) as essential components to insure the success in social media. â Springer However, the evidences for such claims are mostly anecdotal. In this study, we empirically investigate the ethical implications of social media on stakeholder management. We take a CSR credential as a proxy for how a firm sat- isfies the social demand of contemporary value system. We then, investigate how, in social media, the CSR credential is associated with the effectiveness of corporate-commu- nication to gain and maintain influence on stakeholders. In the following sections, we propose that social media is a non-value-neutral communication environment in which the firms with high-CSR firms have a dispropor- tional advantage in engaging stakeholders to promote positive awareness. It implies that, through increasing awareness, social media would accelerate the realization of instrumental benefit of CSR activities. In order to examine the proposition, we analyze the data that captured the interactions of Fortune 500 companies with their stake- holders in the Twitter sphere. We examine how the firms' CSR ratings are associated with their adoption of social media, establishment of online presence, responsiveness of stakeholders to the firms' identity, and virality of the messages. We also examine how CSIR (corporate social irresponsibility) ratings are associated with the same matrices. In the following section, we begin our discussion by identifying key properties of social media that demands a new ethical standard from public entities. Theoretical Background and Hypotheses Development Characteristics of Social Media The internet has made it possible for anyone with a basic computer literacy to access a virtually unlimited amount of information. Now, social media technology provides additional momentum for a more disruptive mode of information-sharing and relationship building practices. In the space of social media, a large portion of previously passive information consumers has been transformed into powerful creators, transmitters, and discussants of information. This new media exhibits distinctive characteristics that essentially reshape the ethical standards of public identi- ties. First, the social media is dialogic. The dialogic mode of communication is the ultimate foundation that sets apart the social media from the traditional ones (Schultz et al. 201 1). It shifts the emphasis of media communication from managing audiences to building and maintaining relation- ships (Taylor et al. 2001). From the stakeholders' points of view, the dialog within social media is an important escape from the "elite-controlled and hierarchical corporate media structures" (Benkler 2006; Lyon and Montgomery 2012).</page><page sequence="3">Social Media for Socially Responsible Firms 793 The dialogic communication facilitates the relationships that are ethically superior (Pearson 1989) and practically beneficial to both firms and their stakeholders (Taylor et al. 2001; Park and Reber 2008; Rybalko and Seltzer 2010). In this respect, the decision to expand the channel for this dialogic mode of communication can be seen as a decision to take a more ethical position in terms of stakeholder relationships. Second, social media is uncontrollable. The space of social media is composed of inputs infused by the numerous users who are far beyond the control of any single entity. The information flow is multidirectional, interconnected, and difficult-to-predict (Friedman 2006). Hence, the collective opinion is virtually immune to any intentional manipulation by traditional means. It is unre- alistic for any entity (an individual, corporate, or govern- ment organization) to expect that it could successfully achieve any manipulation to shape or alter the "collective intelligence" (Callahan 1988) behind-the-scenes without introducing significant repercussion (Qualman 2010). Third, social media creates "coordinated effects of unco- ordinated actions" (Benkler 2006). Without any traditional type of efforts for coordination, once digitized and connected to the internet, all contents are transformed into shared data objects that are freely accessible, searchable, and traceable to anyone (Manovich 2002). A dissatisfied consumer can now easily find "affirmation and social supports" through sharing experiences instead of suffering from the "lonely experi- ence" of dissatisfaction (Ward and Ostrom 2006). This "coordinated effects" exhibit exceptional capacity to locate responsible behaviors and disclose improper ones. Therefore, inferior companies and products can hardly hide behind massive marketing budgets (Qualman 20 10). As one business ethics consultants quipped "in this world you better do it right - you do not get to pick up and move to the next town so easily your reputation will follow you and precede you on your next stop (Friedman 2006, p. 185)." These characteristics, combined with the increased availability of information to stakeholders, engender a highly informed stakeholder group that is ready to act against any sign of misinformation or manipulation. And this will pose different kinds of challenges to different firms depending on their perceived (and/or actual) likeli- hood of a backlash. Before moving forward to the discus- sion of how these characteristics influence firms' adaptation to the new media, a brief review of Twitter, the representative social media, is in order. Twitter Launched in 2006, Twitter has rapidly posi- tioned itself as one of the most popular social media plat- forms where users write and share 140-character text messages. On Twitter, people subscribe to each other by simple clicks. This simple one-way subscription concept enables Twitter to combine the aspects of both social networking and news media within a single structure. Once retweeted, a message instantly reaches the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th hops of followers, going "viral" (Kwak et al. 2010). Retweet refers to the forwarding of others' tweets to one's own followers, while mentions refer to either reply- ing or simply mentioning of other users in the message. Thus, the number of retweets represents the ability of a user to generate contents with a pass-along value, while the number of mentions (reply and mention) represents the ability to engage others in conversation (Cha et al. 2010). On Twitter, people get connected with each other for bidirectional sharing of interests as they do in other social networking sites (e.g., Facebook), while at the same time, they get connected for unidirectional broadcasting rela- tionships as they do in more traditional media (e.g., News, blogs). Thus, as the influence of traditional media is rep- resented by the number in circulation, the influence of any individual user is often estimated by the number of fol- lowers (Kwak et al. 2010). While the number of followers provides a quick snapshot of potential influence, the number of retweets and mentions represents a qualified description of actual influence (Cha et al. 2010; Kwak et al. 2010). To compare these, Cha et al. (2010) grouped Twitter activities into three categories: (1) in degree-influence (i.e., number of followers indicating the size of the audience), (2) retweet-influence (i.e., number of retweets indicating the capability to generate contents with pass-along value), and (3) mention-influence (i.e., number of tweets that respond to or comment on others' tweets). While we basically adopt their categorization, for further analysis, we divided their third category (mention-influence) into two subcategories: user-mention and user-reply. Thus, in this study, we measure the number of followers and the speed of its growth as indicators of the potential influence reflecting the initial acceptance from the audi- ences in the course of establishing its presence online. Then, we also measure the retweets and two types of user mentions (user-reply: tweets that respond to other's and user-mentions: tweets that comment on other's) as indica- tors of actual influence. CSR and the Control of Communication Stakeholders take actions to reward responsible businesses that support good causes and to punish others involved with socially irresponsible practices (Du et al. 2010). The direction and intensity of such stakeholder actions are contingent upon a firm's proficiency in handling the unique challenges of CSR communication (Morsing and Schultz 2006). As noted earlier, the challenge lies in how to resolve the trade-offs between two goals: (1) maximizing stakeholders' awareness of a firm's CSR activities and (2) minimizing Ô Springer</page><page sequence="4">794 K. Lee et al. stakeholders' skepticism about a company's extrinsic (non- genuine) concerns of enacting CSR (Yoon et al. 2006; Du et al. 2010). Traditionally the highly controllable presti- gious media outlets have been dominated by and for elites; majority of their coverage of CSR activities are simply positive (Zhang and Swanson 2006; Deephouse and Suchman 2008; Lyon and Montgomery 2012). For this reason, excessive self-disclosure of CSR activities through these channels are often suspected to be self-serving, attract critical stakeholder attention, and run the risk of "self- promoter's paradox" (Lyon and Maxwell 201 1). To make a CSR communication successful, therefore, it is important to secure public endorsement and support. Moreover, in order to get closer to the new groups of stakeholders coming from civil society and to comply with their expectations, firms are increasingly seeking ways to enhance the discursive quality in their CSR communication (Castello and Lozano 201 1). One of the important strategies for firms is seeking involvement of stakeholders in a mutual construction of CSR communication (Morsing and Schultz 2006). To that end, social media proposes a particularly attractive solution. Making itself a more attractive channel, the new media exhibits a dramatic performance in propa- gating messages (Qualman 2010) and provides firms with immediate market reactions. For firms, the potential of social media is simply too attractive to ignore. What holds firms back from getting involved in social media is the lack of control over the flow of messages. Because stakeholders acting online are now more "aware, willing, and capable" (Rowley and Berman 2000) of mobilizing themselves against firms, being involved in a dialog that they have no control over could result in cata- strophic consequences. Particularly when there is a stron- ger reason to expect negative reactions from its stakeholders, a firm will be less likely to choose social media as an appropriate channel. On the other hand, a firm that identifies its stakeholders as supporters will be more likely to assess the risk of losing control as manageable. Depending on the degree to which a firm identifies itself as socially responsible-voXunidLťůy upholding the value of its relationship with stakeholders, society, and environment while preserving its long-term profitability (Dahlsrud 2008) - the assessed significance of risk associated with adopting the new media will vary. This will result in an earlier adoption of social media by socially responsible firms than by others. Taking the CRS rating as a proxy for firms' (self-identification of) positive relationship with their stakeholders, we posit that: Hypothesis 1 Firms with higher CSR ratings will be more proactive in adopting (adoption; promptitude of adoption) social media than those with lower CSR ratings. Springer CSR and Building Social Presence Social presence, defined as "the degree of salience of the other person in the (mediated) interaction" (Short et al. 1976), is a perception that a communication partner is real and accessible. This perception is determined by the type of medium as well as the intimacy and immediacy expe- rienced along the interaction. As such, social presence is an important precondition for effective relationships in the mediated environments (Kietzmann et al. 201 1). One of the most intuitive indicators of social presence in social media, particularly in Twitter, is the number of followers. This number represents how much direct one-to-one attention is drawn to a particular user. Within the minimalistic design of Twitter, the choice of whom to follow is a one-way decision completed by a single click. Then, what is it that makes someone the most favorite person to follow? Empirical analyses suggest that the choice of followee is determined by the followee's ex-ante popularity and the follower's perceived homophily - a tendency to bond with the like-minded others (Cha et al. 2010; Kwak et al. 2010). Another analysis conducted on the entire Twitter sphere reports a similar role of popularity by showing that the top followees are mostly celebrities (Kwak et al. 2010). In terms of the homophilous connec- tion, people in Twitter are shown to follow those who are personally or politically like-minded with themselves (Kim and Park 2012; Cho and Park 2013). A consistent story was reported by one commercial study ( N = 1,504): 79 % of Twitter followers are more likely to recommend those brands they follow, and 67 % of followers are more likely to buy the brands they follow (Cruz et al. 2010). This study also suggests, among others, that people follow a brand because they want "to show others that they like/support the brand they follow" (25 %) and because they want "to be part of a community of like- minded people" (24 %). Shared interest is an important component of a mutually constructed similarity. Hence, it is likely that as a firm that has built a communal popularity by protecting shared interests might also have been cultivating homophily with the community. If that is the case, and all other things are equal, the stakeholders will be more likely to express their support and interest in the Twitter sphere by following the popular good names. Again, taking the CRS rating as a proxy for firms' positive relationship with their stake- holders, we posit that: Hypothesis 2 Firms with higher CSR ratings will build a greater online presence (number of followers) in social media and build it faster (growth in number of followers) than do those with lower CSR ratings.</page><page sequence="5">Social Media for Socially Responsible Firms 795 Initiating and Engaging in Dialogic Communication with Stakeholders The dialogicity based on the interactive-media-technology increasingly takes the core position in public communi- cation (Taylor et al. 2001). Literature on public relations emphasizes the ethical nature of the interactive commu- nication process. Pearson (1989) suggests that the most ethically superior form of communication between a firm and public is dialogic communication. Many communi- cation and public relation studies follow this view and concur that dialogic communication is, not only ethical, but also beneficial to both firms and stakeholders (Taylor et al. 2001; Park and Reber 2008; Rybalko and Seltzer 2010). In fact, the notion of dialogue is a major element in the stakeholder management perspective as well (Kakabadse et al. 2005). Dialogue with stakeholders enables firms to understand and respond to the messages from the external environment. From the firm's point of view, incorporating dialogue enhances public support, image, and reputation. From the stakeholder's point of view, the dialogue enhances the firm's accountability, public voice in the firm's operations, and satisfaction (Kent and Taylor 2002). Because dialogic communication is, by definition, a relationship in which both parties pursue a genuine concern for each other (Botan 1997; De Bussy et al. 2003), the firms with socially responsible orientation toward their stake- holders will be more likely to initiate dialogic communi- cations by generating more "firm-driven" (i.e., firm-to- users) messages (as measured by a firm's tweets, replies, and retweets). Therefore, we hypothesize that: Hypothesis 3a Firms with higher CSR ratings are more likely to produce firm-driven communication than do firms with lower CSR ratings. By contrast, there is another corporate incentive to ini- tiate dialogue with stakeholders. While CSR refers to a set of corporate actions that positively affects stakeholder's interests and claims, corporate social ir-responsibility (CSIR) is the antithesis of CSR as defined as "actions that negatively affect identifiable social stakeholders legitimate claims" (Strike et al. 2006). Firms involved in major violations of social responsi- bility have a strong motivation to defend their reputations from criticism and to avoid punishment. Research (e.g., Fombrun 1996; Kwak et al. 2010; Poppo and Schepker 2010) suggests that since public trust is critical to insuring survival, firms not only strive to maintain good reputations but also actively engage in actions to repair public trust when it has been impaired. It appears that firms that pub- lically violated social responsibility have every reason to be motivated to restore trust and legitimacy. However, a successful reintegration with stakeholders after a firm has been involved in a deviant practice is a highly challenging task. Restoring the relationship with stakeholders following a transgression requires highly prudent and well- structured communication that provides clarification of facts, adequate explanation of wrong-doing, acceptance of a rea- sonable punishment, and a provision of consistent rehabili- tative changes (Pfarrer et al. 2008). For instance, when faced with a trust violation, firms need to voluntarily, quickly, and transparently acknowledge their failure (Kwak et al. 2010; Poppo and Schepker 2010). However, if such voluntary and transparent acknowledgement of failure is not accompanied by a well-thought-over strategic coordination, the actions may irreparably damage the relationship, for instance, by entailing unwanted legal claims or by failing to come up with appropriate follow-up actions (Friedman 2006; Kwak et al. 2010; Poppo and Schepker 2010). If a firm merely increases the quantity of outbound messages without securing the controlled balance between the acknowledgement and denial, the reintegrating efforts would easily turn out to be a disaster. At a minimum, violators need a more sophisticated approach than an outright self-disclosure to all level of stakeholders offering unconditional acknowledgements. In addition, due to the damaged relationship, violators tend to be more closely evaluated by their stakeholders for evidence of an additional violation than others. This heightened surveillance leads to a higher likelihood of legitimacy penalties for the firm when there are repeating violations (Kwak et al. 2010). Thus, even if a firm prefers to take the voluntary disclosure approach, it is feasible only when the firm has a capability and intention to improve its actual trust-related performances. Otherwise, the dialog initiated in social media would only reinforce the skepti- cism with recurring disappointments. Therefore, despite the heightened motivation to restore trust and legitimacy, for the firms branded as socially irresponsible, social media is hardly the best choice to initiate a direct talk with their disgruntled stakeholders. Taking a CSIR rating as a proxy for the violation of social responsibility of a firm, we propose that a firm with a higher CSIR rating will show a weaker tendency to initiate dialogic communications with its stakeholders in social media. Formally, we hypothesize that: Hypothesis 3b Firms with higher CSIR ratings are less likely to produce firm-driven communication than do those with lower CSIR ratings. Virality: Diffusion of Messages Accelerated by Emotional Charges of Stakeholders It is important to note that the messages in social media often become highly viral , especially when they are ^ Springer</page><page sequence="6">796 K. Lee et al. emotionally charged. Empirical studies on the social transmission in social media suggest that messages that induce both positive and negative ends of the emotional spectrum spread faster across the social network than those in the middle. Some analysis show that positive news is more viral than negative news (Friedman and Förster 2001). Others report that positive emotion drives diffusion for general contents, while negative emotion promotes diffusion for news contents (Hansen et al. 2011). Going beyond these single-dimensional views, Berger and Milk- man (2009) suggest that virality is shaped not only by the valence (positive vs. negative) dimension but also by the activation (high arousal vs. low arousal) dimension of emotion. That is, regardless of whether the associated valence is positive or negative, the content that evokes a higher emotional arousal is more likely to go viral (ibid). While all these accounts focus on the characteristics of the content as independent variables that promote or inhibit virality, we extend these perspectives to reason that the characteristics of the source of the content will also lead to a comparable effect. So, we hypothesize that messages produced by (or related with) either highly socially responsible or highly socially irresponsible firms will be more likely to generate stronger virality. These hypotheses are based on the following two assumptions. First, the important categories of CSR ratings, such as community, employees, and environment, are composed of the subjects that would easily turn into a topic of public interest from the stakeholders' point of view. Thus, socially responsible actions in this area are likely to engender more positive messages. Second, once released or found to be commented on, the messages from socially responsible firms are more likely to be resonated with the audience who are already positive-minded. Empirical research shows that the desirable activities in terms of CSR create favorable attitudes toward the firm, foster the feelings of connection (Hong et al. 2010; Maignan and Ferrell 2004), and generate advocating behaviors toward the firm (Du et al. 2010). Due to this positive attitude, the messages from (and related to) socially responsible firms will more likely to be associated with positive emotions by supportive audiences and more likely to be tagged with comments that generate even more positive perception. Consequently, the messages from (and related to) the socially responsible firms are more likely to diffuse wider and faster, being propelled by the social support from their stakeholders. By contrast, socially irresponsible firms are likely to generate (or be involved with) more amounts of negative messages than others when their transgressions become public or someone begins to talk about them. The released messages from (or related to) socially irresponsible firms will have a higher chance to reproduce more intensified negative emotions among their negative-minded audiences. That is, â Springer the messages from (and related to) the socially irresponsible firms are more likely to diffuse wider and faster, being pro- pelled by the social rejection of their stakeholders. In addition, because of the strong association between ethical judgment and human emotions, the process of ethical judgment on fulfilling or violating social responsi- bility tends to accompany emotional activation. Through the association, emotions energize the ethical quest and the components of moral thinking are imbued with emotions (Callahan 1988). Given that emotions assume a particularly important role in ethical judgment (ibid), the messages that carry ethical connotations are likely to induce a higher physiological activation than others. For instance, exposure to an incident of unfairness from ethically related events evokes anger - a highly activated negative emotion (Bou- cher and Osgood 1969). Similarly, exposure to an incident of justice from an ethically related event would inspire awe - a highly activated positive emotion (ibid). Whether the valence be positive or negative, the ethical judgments about a firm's behavior (e.g., CSR) are likely to accompany higher physiological activations. Therefore, compared to others, firms with higher CSR (or CSIR) ratings are more likely to generate (or be involved with) the kind of messages that are conducive to stronger emotions. As the strength of emotions is an important precursor of virality, the messages from (and related to) the firms with higher CSR (or CSIR) ratings will show stronger virality than the messages from others. We take the concept of "user-driven" communications (as measured by the number of users' retweets, replies toward a firm and, mentions that refer to the firm) as a proxy for the virality of messages from (and related to) the firms. Formally, we hypothesize that: Hypothesis 4a Firms with higher CSR ratings are more likely to engender user-driven communication than do the firms with lower CSR ratings. Hypothesis 4b Firms with higher CSIR ratings are more likely to engender user-driven communication than do the firms with lower CSIR ratings. Methods Sample and Data The initial sample was drawn from the US Fortune 500 firms. In order to be sampled, firms also should have CSR and CSIR ratings, assessed by Kinder, Lydenburg, Domini (KLD) Research and Analytics. Due to the full data availability from all archival data sources (described below), our final sample consists of 222 firms that have Twitter activities.</page><page sequence="7">Social Media for Socially Responsible Firms 797 Variables and Measurement Dependent Variables Twitter data from Fortune 500 firms are collected using open-API provided by Twitter.com. Our crawling program accessed the URLs of 500 Twitter profile pages and parsed the data collected in XML format. The actual data collec- tion was performed between May 12 and 25, 2012. We used the stream API to collect the activities in Twitter. Depending on whether the writer was the firm (i.e., firm- driven communication) or individual users (i.e., user-dri- ven communication), six different sets of data are counted per a firm. When the sample firm has multiple Twitter accounts, we used the most active Twitter site for data analysis. We examined three important attributes of a firm's social media: (1) proactive adoption (i.e., adoption of Twitter, promptitude of adoption), (2) its online presence in social media (i.e., number of followers, growth in number of followers), and (3) communication activities that hint at the influence and virality (i.e., firm- and user-driven com- munication). First, we created a dummy variable of Twitter Use , which we coded as 1, if firms have a Twitter account (as of May, 2012) or 0, otherwise. We also measured three important Twitter characteristics of firms that have Twitter accounts: Early Adoption , Number of Followers and Fol- lower Growth. These measures represent the firm's will- ingness to adopt social media earlier than others and the firm's growth in number of followers. Early Adoption was measured as a number of months since the firm's initial use of Twitter (i.e., set up date of Twitter account). For example, if a firm adopted Twitter in January 2012, 4 months before our data collection period (May 2012), the variable was recorded as 4. The Number of Followers was measured by the number of followers in the firm's official Twitter account. In addition, we measured the Follower Growth , which represents the monthly growth in terms of the number of followers. It was calculated by dividing the number of followers by the number of months since a firm's first use of Twitter. Due to the skewed distribution of the Number of Followers and Follower Growth , these variables were transformed logarithmically. Lastly, we measured the detailed communication pat- terns in Twitter. Given the interactivity of social media, we examine both ways of interaction: firm-driven (FD) and user-driven (UD) communication. In each way of com- munication, three activities (tweet, reply, and retweet) are measured. A 'Tweet' is a post or message made on website Twitter. A 'Reply' on Twitter means responding to a tweet from a person (like replying an e-mail) while to 'Retweet' is to broadcast a tweet posted by a person to others (like forwarding an e-mail). Therefore, we measured FD_Tweet , FDJReply , and FD_Retweet for firms' communication patterns to users, as well as, UD_Tweet , UD_Reply , and UD_Retweet for users' communication patterns to firms and other users. All these variables were measured by counting the average daily number of each activity during our data collection period. FD_Tweet was measured by the number of tweets initiated by the firm. Similarly, FD_Re- ply and FD_Retweet were measured by the number of 'replies' and 'retweets' to the users' messages. UD_Tweet was measured by the number of users' tweets that refer to the firm (notice that this measure refers to the user 'men- tion' of the firm using '@firmname' in the middle of or at the end of tweets messages). Though the notation is simi- lar, the variable UD_Tweet is not the direct reverse concept of FD_Tweet . UDJReply and UD_Retweet were measured by the number of users' 'replies' that respond to the firm's tweet and the number of users' 'retweets' that pass along the tweeted messages citing the firm as the origin of the message. Since all three user-driven communications were positively skewed, these variables were transformed logarithmically. Independent Variables: CSR and CSIR In order to measure CSR and CSIR, we collected data from KLD's ratings (as of 2010) comprising seven social domains, including community, corporate governance, diversity, employee relations, environment, human rights, and product. Since social media may not be a significant communication channel with all stakeholders, we used the KLD ratings for the stakeholders who can be influenced by the firm's social media communication: community, employee relations, and environment domains. 1 There has been increasing criticism that KLD ratings may not actually measure social responsibility (e.g., Chatterji et al. 2009). However, the KLD data have several advantages over other CSR measures, such as compre- hensiveness and objectivity (Graves and Waddock 1994). We summed the "strength" scores and "concerns" scores of each dimension and used them as measurement for CSR and CSIR, respectively. Following the recommendation of recent literature (e.g., Arora and Dharwadkar 201 1), we did not combine the strengths and concerns scores since they reflect different concepts: CSR (i.e., sum of strength scores) involves proactive stakeholder management, whereas CSIR (i.e., sum of concerns scores) involves reactive compliance with minimum legal and ethical standard. 1 We conducted the regression analysis with full KLD ratings including sum of all seven domains. The results are similar as reported ones. â Springer</page><page sequence="8">798 K. Lee et al. Control Variables We controlled for company age, firm size, return on assets (ROA), organizational slack, debt ratio, board indepen- dence, board size, advertising intensity, firm reputation, and industry effects. First, we included Company Age in the statistical model since previous studies found that company age is positively associated with active stakeholder man- agement (e.g., Roberts 1992). Company Age was calculated by the number of years since a firm's foundation. Since larger firms may be exposed to greater institutional pressure for adopting new media because of its visibility (Stanwick and Stanwick 1998), they are more likely to engage in social media than smaller counterparts. Firm Size was measured as the total sales of the company; it was transformed logarith- mically due to its skewed distribution. A firm's proactive stakeholder management communi- cation might be driven by better financial conditions (see slack resources perspective for detail, Waddock and Graves 1997). Thus, we controlled for Return on Asset (ROA), Organizational Slack and Debt-to-Equity Ratio . ROA was calculated by net income divided by total assets. We measured Organizational Slack by dividing the firm's working capital by its sales (see Bourgeois III, 1981, p. 37). Debt-to-Equity Ratio was computed by long-term debts divided by total equity. Furthermore, it has been acknowledged that a firm's stakeholder management is influenced by corporate board attributes (e.g., Coffey and Wang 1998). Therefore, we controlled for Board Independence and Board Size. Board Independence was measured by the proportion of unaffili- ated outside directors divided by the total number of directors on the board. Board Size is measured by the total number of directors on the corporate board. In addition, since firms with greater capability and attention for man- aging their communication activities are more likely to actively engage in social media, we controlled for Adver- tising Intensity and Firm Reputation. Advertising Intensity was calculated by advertising expenditures divided by its total sales. Firm Reputation data was measured by the score from the Fortune most-admired lists. Further, since our sample firms fall into multiple industries, we used 13-industry classification dummies in the analysis, 2following previous studies (e.g., Waddock and Graves 1997; Arora and Dharwadkar 2011). For the sake of brevity, we did not report coefficient and standard error for each industry dummy, as seen in Tables 2, 3, and 4. Instead, we reported the number of industry dummies whose coefficients were significant at the p &lt; .05 level. All 2 We also conducted the regression analysis without industry dummies. The overall pattern remained the same with slightly different significance levels. Ô Springer control variables, except industry dummies, were mean- centered. Statistical Analysis We tested our hypotheses using probit regression analysis (Table 2) and OLS (ordinary least squares) regression analyses (Tables 3, 4) with a separate hierarchical approach (i.e., step-wised manner). This hierarchical approach is conservative since all control variables are entered first into the statistical model before testing vari- ables (CSR and CSIR ratings) are included. As reported in all tables, the first models include only control variables. The testing variables are entered into the second model. We only used firms where Twitter data is available, and excluded the cases where the firms do not have the Twitter account. In order to correct this non-random sampling bias, we introduced Heckman selection model (see Heckman 1979), a two-staged procedure that corrects for sample selection bias. As a first step, we estimated the probability that firms have Twitter activities (N = 405) by running probit regression, which is reported in Table 2. This first stage procedure generated the Inverse Mills Ratio , which was included as an additional control variable in our other regression analyses (Table 3 and 4). The inclusion of the Inverse Mills Ratio corrects for any sample selection bias that might be due to non-random sampling. The Breusch-Pagan/Cook-Weisberg test of the full regression models revealed the presence of heteroskedas- ticity (p &lt; 0.001), thus we used robust standard errors in order to correct for heteroskedasticity (see Huber 1967; White 1982). Furthermore, in order to evaluate the multi- collinearity among variables, we calculated variance inflation factors (VIFs) except with industry dummies. Since all of VIF values are under the threshold value of 10, suggested by Neter et al. (1985), our sample firms do not indicate any significant multicollinearity. Therefore, we included both CSR and CSIR variables simultaneously. In order to check robustness, we also conducted a series of models that added each variable in a separate model. However, alternative testing methods did not generate any significantly different results. Results The means, standard deviations and correlations for the sample firms, except industry dummies, are reported in Table 1. We performed probit regression (Table 2) and OLS regression analyses (Tables 3, 4). Hypothesis 1 proposed the positive effects of CSR rat- ings on the proactive adoption of social media.

Dependent variable is whether the firm uses Twitter ( 1) or not (0). Robust standard errors in parentheses and individual industry dummies are not reported for the sake of brevity order to measure the adoption of social media (i.e., whether they adopt Twitter or not), we examined the effects of CSR (and CSIR) on the presence of Twitter in Table 2. Model 1 showed the effects of control variables on the firm's use of Twitter. In particular, the results from probit regression indicate that Firm Size is positively associated with the firm's use of Twitter, whereas the Debt-to-Equity ratio has a negative effect on the use of Twitter. As shown in Model 2, we found that a firm's CSR ratings are positively asso- ciated with social media adoption (p &lt; 0.001). This finding from our probit regression analysis suggests that firms with greater social orientation are more likely to adopt social media. Also, in order to measure the promptitude of adoption (i.e., whether socially responsible firms adopt Twitter earlier than others), we conducted OLS regression (Model 1 and 2 in Table 2). In terms of our testing vari- ables, firm's CSR ratings are positively associated with a firm's earlier adoption of social media at the p &lt;0.10 level. Given the results from both analyses (Table 2 as well as Model 1 and 2 in Table 3), Hypothesis 1 is supported - while the effects of CSR ratings on the promptitude of adoption is marginally significant. â Springer In order to display the effects of a firm's social responsibility on the firm's establishment of initial pre- sence in social media (i.e., number of followers, growth in number of followers), we reported sets of OLS regressions in Table 3. Results suggest that firm's CSR ratings are positively associated with the firm's greater number of followers (p &lt; 0.001, Model 4) and monthly follower growth (p &lt; .001, Model 6). Thus, Hypothesis 2 is also supported. However, the effects of a firm's CSIR ratings were not significant in our analysis, as reported in both Tables 2 and 3. In Table 4, we reported the results of a firm's patterns in social media activities - both firm-driven (Models 1-6) and user-driven (Models 7-12) communication. Models 2, 4, and 6 examined the effects of CSR and CSIR on firm- driven Twitter communication. The results suggest that a firm's CSR and CSIR ratings are not statistically significant in explaining firm-driven communication activities. Thus, Hypothesis 3a and 3b are not supported. These findings indicate that a firm's CSR and CSIR do not make any significant difference, in terms of firm-driven communi- cation activities toward its stakeholders. On the contrary, both firm's CSR and CSIR ratings have explained a significant proportion of the variances in user- driven communication activities in Twitter, as shown in the change of R 2 at the bottom of Table 4 (Models 8, 10, and 12). In terms of specific hypotheses, we found support for both Hypotheses 4a and 4b: a firm's CSR ratings are pos- itively associated with user-driven Tweet activities ( p &lt; 0.01, Model 8), Reply activities (p &lt; 0.05, Model 10), and Retweet activities (p &lt; 0.001, Model 12). Furthermore, we found that a firm's social irresponsibility is also posi- tively associated with proactive user-driven communica- tion. A firm's CSIR ratings have positive effects on both stakeholders' Tweet activities (p &lt; 0.10, Model 8), Reply activities (pcO.lO, Model 10), and Retweet activities (p &lt; 0.05, Model 12). Overall, the results from Table 4 indicate that firms' CSR ratings make a significant difference in user-driven (Models 7-12), but not in firm-driven (Models 1-6) com- munication. And it is both CSR and CSIR ratings (and not CSR alone) that exhibit positive and significant effects on user-driven communication activities. Discussion Our study demonstrates that social media provides a dis- proportionately favorable communication environment to the socially responsible firms. It appears that, depending on their ex-ante social responsibility credentials, firms face a different mixture of opportunities and challenges from the new media. Our findings are summarized in Table 5.</page><page sequence="11">Social Media for Socially Responsible Firms 801 2 -5 &lt;D E .Is 'G o on G &lt;U O c &lt;U 3 Œ c T3 C cd C .o Q.

H2 Firms with higher CSR ratings will build a Supported greater online presence (number of followers) and build it faster (growth in number of followers) than do those with lower CSR ratings H3a Firms with higher CSR ratings are more likely to Not produce firm-driven communication than do Supported firms with lower CSR ratings H3b Firms with higher CSIR ratings are less likely to Not produce firm-driven communication than do Supported those with lower CSIR ratings H4a Firms with higher CSR ratings are more likely to Supported engender user-driven communication than do the firms with lower CSR ratings H4b Firms with higher CSÍR ratings are more likely Supported to engender user-driven communication than do the firms with lower CSIR ratings In essence, a positive social orientation toward stake- holders (as reflected in the CSR ratings) provides firms with favorable condition to absorb the risks associated with the use of new media. Initially, this advantage enables the higher-CSR firms to adopt them earlier than other firms (HI). Subsequently, the social supports built around the socially responsible firms facilitate the firms to establish a greater online-presence (i.e., number of followers) in a shorter period of time than others (H2). Importantly, our findings suggest that the messages from (and related to) the socially responsible firms are more likely to "go viral" (H4a) indicating that social media rewards the socially responsible firms with an advantage in achieving stronger and faster social trans- missions. Thus, it is likely that social media not only rewards the socially responsible firms but also punishes the socially irresponsible firms. Even though it still requires empirical supports from future studies, it is plausible that social transmission of the messages from (and related to) socially responsible firms are accelerated by the activation of positive emotions while the transmission of messages from (and related to) socially irresponsible ones are fueled by the activation of negative emotions of the participants. Interestingly, our data did not support the hypotheses regarding firm-driven communication (H3a and H3b): neither CSR nor CSIR ratings were significantly associated with the quantity of outbound messages originated from the firms (as reflected in firms' tweets, replies, and ret- weets). Despite the apparent advantage they have in the new media, the majority of high-CSR firms appear to Ô Springer</page><page sequence="14">804 K. Lee et al. remain cautious in exploring new rules for the new media. In this respect, Kaplan and Haenlein's (2010) five success factors for being social in social media are suggestive of the sought-after rules: (1) be active, (2) be interesting, (3) be humble, (4) be unprofessional, and (5) be honest. Unlike the bought media (e.g., advertising), perhaps the earned media (e.g., social media) requires a less domineering role of firms. It may be more supportive of a cautious "seeding" rather than a one-sided "leading". In fact, as a form of media-mix, firms maintain the more-controllable tradi- tional media as a major outbound channel so that they can complement the less-controllable social media.(e.g., Kalyanaraman and Sundar 2006; Kim and Sundar 2012). This asymmetry (i.e. the increase of user-driven mes- sages with no-increase of firm-driven messages) offers another important insight about the uniqueness of social media. In fact, the combined results (H3 and H4) provide a clear illustration of "resource-efficiency". The lack of support for H3 indicates that high-CSR firm does not necessarily talk more, while the support for H4 indicates that the firm harvest more responses and stronger virality. This simply suggests a "greater output" over the "same amount of input." This is a telling evidence especially when it is contrasted to the case of traditional media (e.g., advertisement) in which the expected response (output) is almost always proportional to the amount of resources invested (input). While traditional media push their mes- sages by increasing the input resources, social media float them without necessarily increasing their input resources. This constitutes one of the major differences that set apart the efficiency mechanism of social media from that of traditional media. Our study provides important theoretical and practical contributions. From the theoretical point of view, to our knowledge, this is the first study that conceptualizes the social media as a proponent of CSR. Our analysis dem- onstrates that social media does not merely operate as a value-neutral means of communication, but play an important role as a supporter of socially accredited value system. By unevenly configuring its operative effectiveness in engaging stakeholders, social media clearly rewards the socially responsible firms and allows them to harvest "greater output" over the "same amount of input." We contend that, as a social awareness engine that consolidates the affective signals of stakeholders, social media facili- tates socially responsible firms to harvest their fair share of instrumental benefits. Given the paucity of research investigating the ethical implications of social media for management, we believe the perspective offered here will serve as a good reference point when evaluating what it means for firms to be social as an effective participant of social media and as a faithful locus of social responsibility at the same time. Ô Springer From the practical point of view, the findings suggest that managers should be prepared to reevaluate their CSR credentials from the perspective of consolidated social support (and rejection). The executives of high-CSR firms may reprioritize their strategic foci to gain more business benefit by leveraging their advantage in social media to improve the stakeholders' awareness and favorable attri- butions. The executives of low-CSR firms may reevaluate the effectiveness of adopting social media in their com- munication strategy and perhaps re-craft their stakeholder management strategy from a more ethical and socially responsible standpoint. In spite of these contributions, the present study is not without limitations. First, while our virality-hypotheses (H4a and H4b) were supported, the two assumptions underpinning the hypotheses were not directly tested: (1) high-CSR (CSIR) firms will generate (or be involved with) more positive (negative) messages and (2) messages from (and related to) high-CSR (CSIR) firms will get more positive spin in the course of propagation. Future studies that directly test these assumptions are needed to offer the process evidences for the present findings; particularly a qualitative approach adopting the content analysis (e.g., measuring the positive/negative valence associated with messages and/or slicing out and qualitatively analyzing the messages that directly refer to particular subject such as a CSR issue) will strongly complement the limitation of the present study. Second, even though KLD's CSR rating is commonly used in the literature, CSR ratings may not necessarily represent the firm's genuine commitment to its stakeholders. Other supplementary approaches, such as an executive survey, will strengthen our argument. Lastly, we used a sample of Fortune 500 companies. Since our sample includes only large public firms based in the US, the gen- eralization of our findings could be limited. Conclusion Overall, our findings suggest that the new media innovation disproportionally favors the firms with high CSR creden- tials. The clear advantages that the socially responsible firms have over their counterparts in leveraging social media appear to be driven largely by the increased diffu- sion of stakeholders' voices (user-driven communication) but not necessarily by the increased infusion of the firms' own voices (firm-driven communication). In this work, we rely on the stakeholder management perspective (Jones 1995) to propose that the rise of social media carries a significant ethical implication on management. By consolidating social supports and social rejections, social media provides socially responsible firms with a dispropor- tionally advantageous communication environment which</page><page sequence="15">enhances the chance of attaining instrumental benefits of CSR. We argue that the firm's positive social orientation as repre- sented by higher CSR ratings generates a strategic fit with the inherent nature of social media. As Arvidsson and Peitersen (2013) suggested in their exquisite discussion of ethical economy, a sustainable configuration of social bond (i.e., ethical capital) is increasingly becoming a critical foundation of economic value creation, and social media appears to work as a platform for the embodiment of such ethical value. We anticipate that, as communication media evolves more and more into a social direction, the genuine com- mitment to stakeholders (e.g., Quinn and Jones 1995) will take on a more explicit implication on the instrumental performance of a firm. We believe it is an important aspect for managers to consider when crafting their stakeholder relationship strategies. Being socially responsible makes more practical sense with the rise of social media. This understanding of how the inherent nature of social media creates a strategic fit with the socially responsible firms lead us to reflect on Jones' (1995) contention that "the instrumental benefits of stakeholder management paradoxically results only from a genuine commitment to ethical principles" (italic ours) (recited from Berman et al. 1999). It appears that the benefits of positive relationships with the stakeholders will become less paradoxical and more obvious as the current shift of the communication paradigm continues. Jones stated that "honest, trustworthy behavior is difficult to fake, even in the absence of face-to- face contact" (Jones 1995, p. 417). We anticipate that it will be even harder to fake in the years to come. Social Media for Socially Responsible Firms 805 References Arora, P., &amp; Dharwadkar, R. (2011).
