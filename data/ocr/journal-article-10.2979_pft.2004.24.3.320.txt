Y. Agnon. Only Yesterday. Translated by Barbara Harshav. Introduction and glossary by Benjamin Harshav. Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 2000, xxxi + 652 pp. I join the reviewers of Only Yesterday in congratulating Barbara Harshav on having undertaken this daunting assignment and in lauding Princeton University Press for having published an English translation of this complex novel.1 All of the reviewers were clearly infatuated with Balak, the heady, mischievousÐand, by now, densely decipheredÐdog who, according to many, upstages the protagonist Isaac Kumer as he meanders between Ja2a and Jerusalem at the time of the Second Aliyah (1908±11). The adventures of Kumer and Balak, separately and together, constitute the plot of Agnon's novel.2 Balak, on whose back Kumer had playfully painted the words ``Crazy Dog,'' is bewildered by the constant su2ering he endures and is determined to learn the truth about his existential condition. Along the way, Balak contracts rabies and avenges himself by biting, and thereby fatally infecting, Isaac during the week of sheva¦ berakhot after his marriage to Shifra, a pious young woman from Jerusalem's Hungarian quarter, whom Isaac had met shortly after he had been jilted by Sonya Zweiring, Ja2a's restless and frolicsome coquette. Any further comments about the exploits of the central and marginal characters would require forays into the history of the composition of this novel, into how and why the hitherto independent Isaac narrative and the dog fable were brilliantly merged, into the ongoing saga of the multivalenced interpretations of this work, into an assessment of its constant references to veri®able contemporary events, and into the poetics of the substantial quotations whose sources are rarely PROOFTEXTS 24 (2004): 320±68.

Rather, it intends to examine Only Yesterday as an English rendition of Temol shilshom. Only Yesterday demonstrates Barbara Harshav's linguistic skills in presenting a felicitous, yet faithful, English translation that conveys the novel's shifts in tone, mood, and diction. I cite the Hebrew for the bene®t of those readers who are able to observe the translator's achievements in transmitting Agnon's verbal prowess. For each category, only the more salient examples are given, but, happily, there are many more that can be quoted in each category. A C C U R A T E  A N D  C O M M A N D I N G  V E R B A L  R E N D I T I O N S While adhering closely to the literal meaning(s) of the original Hebrew, the English formulations are gracefully and poetically recon®gured so that they  ̄ow naturally: (5) mpwf z` miqqeke chomping on their beard (4) (16) envr ligyde and threaded his way through the crowd (18) (21) zigelv  ̄agon (24) dncn oeincdy cr By the time the imagination spun (29) zepeinc its imaginings (35) (36) daxd rilane drnw xtqn Tells a little and slurs over a lot (46) (207) dgny ly aehxew a pinch of joy (281) P A R A L L E L  E X P R E S S I O N S Harshav, aware that a word-for-word rendering of Hebrew idiomatic expressions would distort the intent, wisely chooses English phrases, proverbs, or adages that convey the original's sense, image, and impact. The following examples illustrate the application of this technique: (54) da uewe dil` But every rose has a thorn (70) (93) zexenze zetilg Mutations and Permutations (125) (351) dwizyd lr xky milawn because they get hush-money (485) </page> <page sequence="3"> 322 ❙ Avraham Holtz The translator gracefully and unobtrusively transmits the original's subtle alliterations, as in: (19) scep iexy ayr gixe a smell of soaked grass wafts there (22) Harshav enhances the range of the original words by supplementing them with entirely appropriate adjectives, adverbs, and the like, or by transposing the syntactical functions, such as in: lk `l . . . dixai` lr zttehe dteb z` da dtipvny ,d`pe dlw dzlny s` eli`k ,zqkxtn dilry dlnydy ,dipeqk dzlny z` dign dxrp (88) .dig `id Her dress is handsome and light, wraps her body and taps on her limbs. . . . [N]ot every girl brings her dress to life like Sonya, for the dress gambols on her, as if it too were alive. (117) Harshav often succeeds in retaining the precise number of the original words and thereby embeds the original cadence in the translation. For example: (141) jipkpk z` gpd Stop your yesyessing (189) Agnon, in consequence of his ®delity to traditional sources, frequently strings phrases and words together with a vav (``and''). The translator, by avoiding the repetitive ``and,'' maintains the original meaning, while invigorating the English text, which results in a more readable narrative.3 z` xfite ogleyd lr eraek z` wxfe lecb yrx lewa xclhl`ty qpkp (136) .alkk arx ip` dxag ,xn`e drextd ezixela Shpaltleder entered with a loud noise, tossed his hat on the table, rumpled his  ̄ourishing pompadour, and said, Fellows, I'm as hungry as a dog. (181) </page> <page sequence="4"> On Barbara Harshav's Translation of Temol shilshom ❙ 323 Equally inventive and well-wrought are Harshav's presentations of the playful yet suggestive appellations that Agnon assigns to some of the peripheral characters. Thus: (55) qethkiil opgei Yohanan Lightfoot (72) (55) dweznd lbxd Sweet Foot (72) (83) oeilrpevxk Lordswill (111) Similarly, Agnon evokes negative overtones by appending the quotidian Ashkenazi family name endings, ``vitch'' and ``sky,'' to the word owqr (askan, ``activist,'' ``big shot'') to form the names iwqpwqr, 'uiaepwqr (Askanski, Askanovitch), thus mocking the Yishuv's makhers. This e2ect is conveyed in English by such generic names as Makherovitch, Makherson, and Makhersky, a humorous and satiric touch, assuming that the English reader is familiar with the Yiddish-German noun makher. Readers unfamiliar with this colloquialism may not grasp the full literary signi®cance of these obviously arti®cial names. In a marvelous stroke of talent, the translator follows the Hebrew text's lead and unravels for the English reader what Agnon decodes for the Hebrew reader. A now little-known Zionist organization or program, which had been very much a part of the Second Aliyah halutzic ambience, bore the name SHILOH (dliy,  d"liy). Agnon informs his readers in the late 1940s, who may have forgotten, or may have never known, that the name of this short-lived project is an acronym for  zea`d ux`l l`xyi daey (shuvah Yisra¥el le¥erets ha¥avot, literally, ``Return, Israel, to the Land of the Fathers,'' 84 y"z). Harshav does not rest content to translate the decoding words. Wishing to give the English reader a full sense of the acronym, she assigns a word to each of the six English letters, S-H-I-L-O-H, to refer to the English words ``Sail Home Israel to the Land Of Hope'' (112). Clearly, this is not a literal rendition of the Hebrew, but its overall meaning and the anagrammatic technique are conveyed. In this mode, one wonders why the translator did not follow any of the above patterns of English parallels when dealing with the surname of Isaac Kumer's young lady friend Sonya, which she spells as Zweiering (why the extra e after the i in Zwei?). Why not follow Amos Oz's interpretation and unpack the name's </page> <page sequence="5"> 324 ❙ Avraham Holtz implication for the English reader?4 Other names that would bene®t from similar decipherment are Yael 1⁄4ayott (Chajes? 1⁄4ayyes?Ðwild animals?) and Dr. Schimmelmann (``moldy'' or ``musty'' man, obviously indicating ridicule). Schim- melmann's character is modeled after the historical ®gure Dr. Ben-Zion Mossinson (1878±1942), a Bible instructor at the Herzliah gymnasium and a popular lecturer on biblical themes, whose use of biblical criticism was sharply debated, which is probably why Agnon dubs him ``Schimmelmann.''5 As for Pizmoni (Mr. Rhymer), Dr. Pik¶in (Wiseman), and Falk Shpaltleder (Split Leather), if these surnames intend to point to their bearer's essences, they, too, should have been anglicized. Two extensive citations exemplify the method of equivalence.6 Aware that the e2ect of the original text on the readers cannot be duplicated in the target language, translators resort to equivalents that presumably function in the target language in ways that parallel the original. All cases of equivalence raise the issue of whether translators, in order to evoke the original stylistics, can rightfully compose a virtually new text that adheres to the style of the original text, even as it reshapes and recasts it in accord with the demands of the target language for the bene®t of readers to whom the original is foreign and unknown, while the newly cast version proceeds on its own. The following two wonderful displays of linguistic virtuosity illustrate the problems and this translator's resolutions. The ®rst citation involves sounds and syntax of both languages (Hebrew and English); the need for equivalence is more poignant and immediate. Consequently, the translator did not feel obligated to apologize for the use of this method. Thus, we read: miwiqt ea lihd [eia` l`] azknd lr eny [xnew wgvi] mzgy xg` ,oiziha oieze oieza oizihe ,oitl`a oipiire oipiira oitl` silgd ,zecewpe ,dry dze`a daizd el dxiihvpy itk ,dxada zenecd zeize` x`y oke (380) .azky zevilnd lr dinz `edyk After [Isaac Kumer] signed his name on the letter, he put commas and periods in it, changed a few letters, some ``y's'' for ``i's'' and some ``j's'' for ``g's,'' and other letters that sounded the same, as he imagined they were </page> <page sequence="6"> On Barbara Harshav's Translation of Temol shilshom ❙ 325 spelled at that moment. And he was amazed at the rhetorical  ̄ourishes he had written. (526) The homophones alef and ¦ayin (so-called silent letters of the Hebrew alphabet) and the two t sounds, tet and tav, the source of Isaac Kumer's Hebrew spelling errors, are replaced by their analogues in the English language, namely the ``y/i'' (hungryer, hungrier) and ``j/g'' (g/j-eography, g/j-eopardy) homophonic errors. If it is assumed that the reader of Only Yesterday is to understand these details as equivalents to the process portrayed in Temol shilshom, then this solution is inventive. However, if the English reader relates to the speci®c linguistic details not as equivalents but as precise transcriptions of the original, the verbal parallels may be misleading. Is the English reader to imagine Isaac Kumer correcting the spelling of an English letter to his father? We ®nd a far more engaging example of equivalence in the phantasmagoric dream and interpretation episode, which rests on a subtle sequence of verbal associations based upon scriptural verses and a chain of negatives that undercut verisimilitude and are extremely di3cult to transmit from one language to another. One segment of this surrealistic scene will su3ce. Incidentally, this citation is the very section that prompts the translator to apologize in her note about the methodology she uses in transposing the narrative. xyk el d`xpy ,[zeiyrn ixetiqa iwad owfd ciqgd] dywzn did oiicre dpeekdy rcie ,xpd xe`l oilet  oi` ,eit jezl dpyn dltp .oilet  jln ` av mdl aiig icedi did m`y ,oilet  ivixt eid mibdepy ,milt`d zexeal o`k (355) .eaeg z` rxety cr lt` xeal eze` mikilyn eid oenn But [the old Hasid in Jerusalem who was expert in hasidic tales] was still puzzled about why the Military Commander of the King of Poland appeared. He recalled a Mishnah, And one sticks in even a pole, even a reed into dripping water which one made into  ̄owing water, and he knew that this referred to the dark cisterns, for if a Jew owed them money, the Polish nobles would throw him into a dark cistern until he settled his debt. (491) (emphasis in Hebrew and in English added) </page> <page sequence="7"> 326 ❙ Avraham Holtz The Hebrew text is based upon a play with the homonym polin, which as a verb means ``to inspect one's garments for vermin,'' but the word as a noun refers to Poland, the country. Wishing to replicate this homonymous wordplay, Harshav sought an English word equivalent to the verb polin and found a Mishnaic reference (Mikva¥ot 5:5). She also expanded the original and included the ``water''/``cistern'' connection. Without some form of introduction, would the English reader, uninitiated in the patterns of midrashic exegesis, pick up on the ``pole''/``Poland'' nexus? One wonders, too, whether the contemporary Hebrew reader, untrained in midrashic hermeneutics, would detect these subtleties in the Hebrew. Acknowledg- ing the deviation, Harshav writes in her note: In only one instance did I deliberately deviate from the original: in Book Four, Chapter One, the author presents an elaborate wordplay using biblical and talmudic passages to interpret the dream of a Hasid. Agnon used Deuteronomy 32:42 [aie` zerxt y`xn (merosh pera¦ot oyev)] and Shabbat 12[a], while I used Exodus 6:1 [``now shalt thou see what I will do to Pharaoh''] and Miqvaot 5:5 to achieve the same e2ect. If there is some other world, where translators can discuss ``deviations'' with authors, I hope Agnon will understand. (xxxi) However, Harshav does not explain what may have prompted her to ``deviate,'' or what she intends by it. Does the English reader grasp that this section is not in any way Agnon's, but entirely Harshav's invention, a pseudo-Agnon text implant that has been substituted for the ``untranslatable'' Hebrew original? Harshav ought to have o2ered some explanation for the necessity of this substitution. Clearly, this is not the forum for a discussion of the theoretical issues involved in such radical recastings. This also seems to disregard Howard's caution that translators not intrude, since ``the translator serves best when he remains invisible, respecting the text, leaving nothing out and putting nothing in even when he might itch internally to improve upon it.''7 Harshav's command of her craft comes to the fore in her renditions of the rhymed sections that serve a variety of aesthetic functions. Alter justi®ably commends the translator for her marvelous presentation of Balak's rhymed prose.8 </page> <page sequence="8"> On Barbara Harshav's Translation of Temol shilshom ❙ 327 Alliteration is one of Harshav's favorite techniques, one that she employs e2ectively in a wide range of instances: (355) dgnye dzyn mdl eyre feasted and feÃted (491) dlrnln zcwei dngd The sun is blazing above and (31) dhnln xrea legde the sand is burning below. (39) In the latter example, the repeated m/ml sounds are replaced in the English with s/z and b[l ] sounds, thus creating a parallel e2ect in the tranlated passage. Similarly, zezk mnvr miyer j`id ux`d zcear myl mi`ay mipeiv miyp` eli`e (80) .ux`d z` zezzkny zezk but how can Zionists who come there to work the Land make sects on top of sects that crush the Land into sections. (105) (emphasis added) The double appearance of the word zezk (kitot) is matched precisely by the double use of the noun ``sects.'' The verb zezzkny (shemekhatetot), which repeats the consonants of the noun zezk (kitot), is sonorously replicated in the word ``sections,'' which visually and audibly underscores the ``sect'' aspect. (Parenthetically, the z (t) sound is repeated seven times in the phrase zezzkny zezk zezk (kitot kitot shemekhatetot), precisely the number of times that the letter s appears in the EnglishÐtwo s's in the word ` `sects'' twice, an s in ` `crush,'' and two s's in ` `sections.'') Alliteration replaces rhyme once again as we follow Balak: ,mileryn ileryn oia blce utwe ,mileykne mizgzg lr gqte xare milelz ,miytexne miyteyn ,milwerne milewr ,minezqe minewr (216) .millezne And he passed through . . . a multitude of paths, bent and blocked, cur- ving and contorted, pocked and putrid, perpendicular and precipitate. (294) This section is a decided deviation; translator abandons the original scheme and presents an entirely di2erent complex that transmits the meaning and the mood. </page> <page sequence="9"> 328 ❙ Avraham Holtz One may question whether the translator has trespassed beyond the accepted parameters to create a skillful, but faux-Agnonesque, variant. From the single-rhymed couplet to the sustained rhymed passages that recur throughout the novel, Harshav exhibits her superb control of this verbal juggling act. She transmits the original meaning of the text, even while she shapes it in fresh, arresting rhymes. Her delight in these tough exercises equals that of Agnon's pleasure in frolicsome wordplays. English readers who can follow the Hebrew will be rewarded twice over, since they can observe and enjoy the two performers, Agnon and Harshav, engaged in ®rst-rate linguistic tournaments, but readers who must rely on the English version will also savor the skillful rhymes. A rhymed couplet appears in the prosaic context of places traversed by Kumer's train on his way out of Galicia. Some of these places were made famous by the Torah scholars who resided in them, others by their natural resources. The train also passes towns known only for religious dissension. This is presented by adding the negative lo (``no'' or ``not'') to the clicheÂ couplet ``Torah''/se¶orah (merchandise). The Hebrew reads: mda yi la` ,dxegq `le dxez `l mda oi`y zenewnd on yie (9) .zwelgn which is adroitly rendered in English as: And yet other places have neither learning nor earning, but do have a Quarrel. (8) Several sections of Book One are devoted to life in Peta¶ Tikvah prior to World War I. Since Yiddish was the mother tongue of most of the young Jewish laborers who came to ful®ll their Zionist dreams, many continued to sing and speak Yiddish, if only in private, despite their public advocacy of Hebrew as the national language of the new Yishuv. Thus, the four-line Yiddish ditty, cited with its Hebrew translation, sounds authentic, although to date I have been unable to locate it elsewhere. Harshav, maintaining the original pattern, quotes the Yiddish stanza in transliteration: </page> <page sequence="10"> On Barbara Harshav's Translation of Temol shilshom ❙ 329 xriiy otie` \ dewz gzt oi` .xriih hyip yEw „ oe` \ lieelƒee fi` hrlb „ e`ee ,lkl `ed reci \ oxeba my dewz gzta (132±33) .lefa od zetihlde \ xweia `l dwiypd In Petach Tikva9 / Oyfn shayer / vu a glet iz volvl / un a kush nisht tayer. (177) Just as Agnon provided his Hebrew readers with a translation of the Yiddish, so Harshav presents her English readers with a delightful English translation: In Petach Tikva in the barn / As everyone can see, / Kisses aren't expensive, / Caresses are for free. In order to preserve the four-line structure and the abcb rhyme scheme, Harshav had the second line end with the monosyllable ``see,'' thus easing the way for the concluding word ``free.'' Consequently, the light tone and carefree mood are conveyed. A few pages hence, the translator encounters a far more formidable task in the verbal duel between Naftali Zamir and Falk Shpaltleder, which lasts for two full pages (181±82) and is structured, in the Hebrew (136±37), around delightful rhymes. As an illustration, I cite the introduction in full, which Harshav renders artlessly. el e`iazy ahen ,xn`e ilztp siqed .jk e` jk mixeaic epl dnl mdl xn` icb ilztp xn` ?enr il e`iaz dne xclhl`ty xn` .jx e` `p e` ilv (136) .en` alga He said to them, Why such words, such vain patois? Said Naftali, Bring him meat to eat, tender or raw. Said Shpaltleder, And will you bring me with it something other? Said Naftali, A kid cooked in the milk of its mother. (181) The English version of Naftali's sonnet about Shpaltleder (OY 182; 137 y"z) is in the main faithful to Agnon's rhyme and meter.10 Always careful to convey the tone, </page> <page sequence="11"> 330 ❙ Avraham Holtz diction, and element of surprise and one-upmanship throughout this tour de force, line after line, Harshav proves her mettle. Having demonstrated the overall elegance of Harshav's translation, I proceed to an inquiry into some of the mistranslations in Only Yesterday. As a preface to my critique, I cite Barnstone's observations on this subject. Recognizing the many extenuating circumstances that lead to mistakes, Barnstone contends that ``the source of such error is usually misunderstanding of the source text or ignorance of the ®ner points of the source language.'' Yet he a3rms that such blunders are ``the least serious instance of translation failure,'' and therefore, when critiquing them ``mercy should prevail, but allow no concealment.''11 As Howard indicates, a good translation involves ``scrupulous, meticulous and poetic attention to myriad details.'' The text has to be examined on what he calls ``the microscopic level. It is easy to let small things slip through the net. . . . Some of the details may sound trivial on one level but each of them is one more tiny link binding this vast fabric together.''12 Before embarking on an examination of some of the details that slipped through Harshav's net, I raise the subject of the extent to which a translator is obligated to research unfamiliar aspects of a text that might rightfully lie within an annotator's purview. In the absence of an annotated edition, can translators reasonably be expected to investigate esoteric details as they are encountered in the course of their work? I do not intend to determine the errors that Harshav could or should have avoided. Rather, I enumerate the types of errors to underscore the complexity of Agnon's text, and how easy it is to misconstrue a passage's meaning. I N A C C U R A T E  T R A N S L A T I O N S  O F  J E W I S H L I T U R G I C A L  A N D  R I T U A L  T E R M S L i t u r g y ixy` (Ashrei) In an exceptionally lively scene, the young Zionist laborers eat their supper and spend their leisure time in a homey inn in Ja2a operated by the feisty Chabadnik Jacob Malkov (1875±1931)13 and his wife and family (398). One day, as the time for the late-afternoon and evening prayers approaches, Malkov realizes that, although </page> <page sequence="12"> On Barbara Harshav's Translation of Temol shilshom ❙ 331 there are many more than the requisite ten males in his inn, none of these laborers is willing to join in a minyan. The workers leave with Joseph Hayyim Brenner (1881±1921),14 and Malkov riles: cenrl cizr ."ixy`" df dn mircei mpi`y mdly diqpniba micli o`k yi (295) .zxabd mely dn xnel rciy eznkg lky xec o`k There are children here in their Gymnasium who don't know the ®rst chapter of Psalms. A generation will rise here whose whole wisdom will be knowing how to say How are you, Madame. (407) In Hebrew and in Yiddish, 15 the word ashrei in this context refers not to the initial word of Psalm 1 (Ashrei ha¥ish, Happy is the man) but rather to the prayer Ashrei, which is recited three times a day.16 Ashrei consists of the recitation of Psalm 145, prefaced by the verses from Ps. 84:5, Ashrei yoshevei veitekha . . .  / ``Happy are those . . . ''; and Ps. 144:15, Ashrei ha¦am . . .  / ``Happy is the people . . . ''; and concluding with Ps. 115:18, Va¥ana¶nu nevarekh . . .  / ``We will bless. . . . '' The misidenti®ed Ashrei is ba ̧ing not only because Ashrei is part of popular Yiddish maxims, but also since the opening line of this prayer is correctly translated further on (540): ``Praiseworthy are those who dwell in Your house'' (not italicized, although this is a verse, Ps. 84:5). Therefore, a more accurate translation of this passage is: ` `There are children here in their gymnasium who don't know what Ashrei is.''17 The concluding sentence, ` `A generation . . . Madame,'' is itself a humorous pun based upon Rashi's commentary to B. Bava Metsi¦a 87a: Lo sheyish¥al lah [leva¦alat habayit] leshalom, ella leva¦alah yish¥al ma shelom hageveret (A man should not inquire of a woman directly as to her welfare, but rather should ask her husband how his wife is faring). The younger generation, Malkov complains, confront women directly, using the very formula that Rashi mentions. oec` l` (El adon) Standing alone on the passenger ship to Erets Israel, Isaac Kumer ruminates over a similar journey that his ancestor Reb Yudel 1⁄4asid, the protagonist of Agnon's </page> <page sequence="13"> 332 ❙ Avraham Holtz Hakhnasat kallah (The Bridal Canopy), had undertaken several decades earlier. Kumer imagines that Reb Yudel's ship had encountered a storm, and while all the passengers aboard panicked, Reb Yudel 1⁄4asid remained calm, and ``chanted a wonderful melody, To the Lord for all His deeds'' (italics in OY 27). The Hebrew (23 y"z) reads: miyrnd lk lr oec` l` ,`ltp oebipa obipe cnr. The italicized words indicate that Harshav, disregarding the preposition a (``with,'' ``according to,'' preceding the word ``melody''), read the words after the comma as oec` l ¤`  (To the Lord). The ®ve words following the comma are the opening verse of a famous hymn praising God who created the universe, sung as part of the regular Sabbath morning service. These words are to be read miyrnd lk lr oec` l ¥`  (El adon al kol hama¦asim),18 and the phrase may be translated ``God, Lord of all creation.'' The words of this hymn and Reb Yudel's marvelous melody worked miracles during the storm at sea, and immediately ``the winds heard and came to appease him. They bore the ship, as porters bear burdens on their shoulders, until they brought it to the Land of Israel'' (27). zecn dxyr yely (Shelosh ¦esrei middot) As the drought in the novel's ®nal sequence becomes more severe and the month of Kislev (November±December) passes without a break in the weather, Jerusalem's synagogues ®ll with worshipers o2ering prayers to arouse God's mercies.19 zepryede epkln epia` ,zecn dxyr yelye zegilq mixne` mei lka ,minybd lr dlitz dlitz rneya lltzn xeav gilye ,xteya mirweze oyxcd cner dlecb dgpn xg`e ,xeava milidz mixne` dlitzd xg`e (428) .ald z` xxerl ick ,oiyeak ixac xne`e Every day they recite Slikhot [``Supplications'']20 and the Thirteen Rules for expounding the Law,21 Our Father Our King,22 and Save Us, and they blow the Shofar, and the Cantor intones the prayer for rain, and after the prayer they recite Psalms, and after the afternoon prayers the preacher stands up and moralizes to stir the heart. (591) </page> <page sequence="14"> On Barbara Harshav's Translation of Temol shilshom ❙ 333 The thirteen middot (``attributes''), when mentioned in the context of Seli¶ot or penitential prayers, do not refer to the thirteen rabbinic homiletical rules for expounding the Torah, recited as part of the daily modicum of Torah study included in morning services. Rather, the thirteen attributes alluded to here are the thirteen middot of God's mercy, as stated in Exod. 34:6±7,23 a standard, statutory compo- nent of Seli¶ot, based on a rabbinic dictum (B. Rosh Hashanah 17b): ` `[God] showed Moses the order of prayer. He said to him: `Whenever Israel sin, let them carry out this service before Me [i.e., read from the Torah the passage containing the thirteen attributes of mercy] and I will forgive them. . . .' R. Judah said: `A covenant has been made with the thirteen attributes dxyr yely zixa [berit shelosh ¦esrei], that they will not be turned away empty-handed.' '' The Hebrew text also gives more information about the special prayers in time of drought. The word translated ``Save Us'' is hosha¦not in the plural, thereby indicating that more than one Hosha¦na / ``Save Us,'' a litany of hosannas, is intoned on such occasions.24 In addition, the cantor inserts the prayer for rain in his repetition of the ¦Amidah when he comes to the words Shomea¦ te®llah (``God who listens to prayer''), that is, in the sixteenth benediction.25 After the service, psalms are recited together by the congregation. Later on in the day, after min¶ah gedolah, an early-afternoon service, there is time for the preacher to deliver a stirring sermon (Ta¦anit 2:1) that will lead the congregants to full repentance and hopefully lead to the end of the drought. ond zyxt (Parashat Hamman) Among Jerusalem's many Jewish artisans who attempt to eke out a livelihood by physical work and avoid dependence on the communal dole (¶alukkah), there were some who could ``write the whole Bible story of Haman on a grain of wheat'' (553). The Hebrew (400 y"z) is: ond zyxt lk dhg xibxb lr aezkl mircei eid mdn. The translator mistakenly read the unvocalized text ond zyxt as ``the section of Haman,'' instead of ``the section of the manna,'' referring to Exod. 16:4±36, which, together with an accompanying prayer, appears in some prayer books. The recitation of this biblical passage and the prayer ensures a proper livelihood.26 Some Jerusalem micrographers were able to write the entire ``manna section'' on a grain of wheat, so </page> <page sequence="15"> 334 ❙ Avraham Holtz that its recipients could have it available for prayer were they not to ®nd it in a ``proper'' prayer book.27 Moreover, the story of Haman (in the book of Esther) is never referred to as ``the section of Haman.'' l`xyi rny (Shema¦ Yisra¥el), yicw (Kaddish) On his mother's yortsayt, Isaac Kumer tarries in Jerusalem to recite Kaddish. Arriving early at a synagogue, he stands in a corner and rehearses the Kaddish in a whisper. The reader is thus informed that Kumer has not participated in a synagogue service for a long while and needs to practice. He reprimands himself for feeling uncomfortable about reciting the Kaddish. Slowly, he realizes that he and the other worshipers pray in the same language, with identical words. Consequently, by the time he is about to recite the opening line of the Shema¦, he remembers exactly what to do: ``[H]e covered his eyes and drew out the `One' '' (360). For the bene®t of the English reader, perhaps this ought to read ``and drew out (or prolonged) the word `One,' the ®nal word in the sentence `Hear O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is One,' '' until Kumer ``and the whole world disappeared before the Unique One of the World Who ®lls all of existence. And when he came to the prayer that begins, You shall love your God with all your heart, he opened his eyes.'' Instantly, Kumer remembers reciting the Shema¦ as a child, coaxed and coached by his mother. ``And the two loves, the love of God and the love of his mother, stirred his heart.'' Since there is no mention in the glossary that ``Hear O Israel . . . '' is a biblical verse, nor is there any mention of the paragraphs (Deut. 6:5±9, 11:13±21; Num. 15:37±41) that constitute the full Keri¥at shema¦ as recited twice daily, the unfamiliar reader does not know that the prayer ``You shall love your God with all your heart . . .'' is the continuation of the Shema¦, named for its initial word, zad`e (ve¥ahavta), and is marked in Agnon's text with rarely used quotation marks. The recitation of this paragraph does not require covering or closing one's eyes. After reciting the mourner's Kaddish that follows Aleinu at the end of the service, Isaac studies a chapter of Mishnah in memory of his mother's neshamah (soul), which by dint of the similarity of the letters (m-sh-n-h/n-sh-m-h) is associated with neshamah. Realizing that there is still a quorum of ten men, Isaac </page> <page sequence="16"> On Barbara Harshav's Translation of Temol shilshom ❙ 335 recites Kaddish Derabbanan, here translated in two di2erent ways in two lines, once as ``the Kaddish of Learned Men,'' and once as ``the Rabbis' Kaddish.''28 megx `ede (Vehu ra¶um) Earlier in the novel, while still in Ja2a, Isaac enters the local beit midrash one evening and hears: (261) .ie`xie avr lew rnyp ,zigyi `le oer xtki megx `ede But he, being full of compassion, forgave their iniquity and destroyed them not, a sad and pious voice was heard. (359) There is no indication, by italics or double quotation marks (as in OY 619), that this is a citation of Ps. 78:38, the introduction to the daily evening service.29 This verse is translated: ``But He, being full of compassion, forgiveth iniquity, and destroyeth not [Yea, many a time doth He turn His anger away and doth not stir up all His wrath].'' In addition, whether this is a printing error or not, the h of ``he'' should be capitalized, since the subject of this verse is God. In no way does the verse refer to Kumer or to the other worshipers in the study house.30 Therefore, it is not ` `a sad and pious voice that is heard'' but rather a sad and fearful sound that is heard coming from the worshipers as they begin the evening service. dyecw (Kedushah) and ycwp (nekaddesh) / jyicwp (nakdishakh) The Kedushah is partially de®ned or explained in the glossary (647). We are told that Jews in some of the towns that the train traverses on its route to Lemberg (Lvov) ``sanctify the Name of the Holy-One-Blessed-Be-He with the Kedushah, We shall sanctify You, and others sanctify Him with We shall bless You, and they wrestle with each other and create a Quarrel'' (8±9). That is, there are places in which worshipers follow Nusa¶ Ashkenaz (the Mitnagdim, in non-hasidic synagogues), who begin the daily morning and afternoon Kedushah with the words nekaddesh et shimkha (We will sanctify Your Name), whereas in others, hasidic communities that follow Minhag Sefarad, the daily Kedushah opens with nakdishakh vena¦aritsakh (We </page> <page sequence="17"> 336 ❙ Avraham Holtz will hallow and adore You). In neither case is the verb whose root is ycw (k-d-sh) to be translated ``bless,'' since in this part of the service, worshipers are reciting verses from Isa. 6:3 and Ezek. 3:12,31 and not ``blessing.'' Moreover, since the same root,  ycw (k-d-sh), appears in both formulations, the Quarrel is so much less comprehen- sible to the English reader. To highlight the source of the ``Quarrel,'' the translator might have presented a transliteration of the two verbs nekaddesh and nakdishakh. The glossary (647) accurately informs the reader that the Kedushah is the third section of the ¦Amidah and states that Kedushah is ``recited by pious Jews every morning''; it does not mention that it is also recited every afternoon. The glossary's omission would confound a reader of the scene (522) occurring at the time ``[t]he sun was about to set,'' when ``old women stood outside [the synagogue in Meah Shearim] to hear the Kedushah, the sancti®cation, and the Barkhu, the blessing [should be ``the call to bless,'' which begins the communal liturgy of the morning and evening services].'' This scene takes place at twilight, the ®nal opportunity to recite the afternoon service with its Kedushah. This afternoon min¶ah service is immediately followed by Barekhu, which introduces the evening service recited in the presence of a minyan.32 Further on, wishing to demonstrate that certain older neighborhoods in Jerusalem have been depleted of their Jewish residents, the narrator states that in these formerly Jewish quarters, Barekhu and Kedushah are no longer heard. This is rendered in the English by an alliterative but imprecise phrase: ``[N]either benedic- tion nor blessing is heard there'' (283). What the Hebrew implies is that there is not even a minyan (de®ned in the glossary, 649) left, so that communal prayer is no longer heard, a lesser degree of desolation than the harsher reality implied by the English, according to which these neighborhoods are devoid of all Jews, since even those blessings which can be recited in private are not heard. mikxan zay (Shabbat mevarekhim) The connotation of Shabbat mevarekhim,33 without a speci®c month (29), eluded the translator. When this term appears with the name of the month of Av, it is correctly translated ` `on the Sabbath when we bless the consoling month of Av'' (16). </page> <page sequence="18"> On Barbara Harshav's Translation of Temol shilshom ❙ 337 However, after boarding the ship in Trieste on his way to Erets Israel, Kumer meets an elderly Jew, who will become his grandfather-in-law, and who inquires if Isaac has any relatives in Erets Israel. Isaac replies: ``What do I need relatives for, all the children of Israel are comrades, especially in the Land of Israel. And the old man smiled and said, In the Sabbath blessing, say that and we shall answer Amen'' (29). The phrase ``all the children of Israel are comrades'' is not part of the regular Sabbath service, so it is hard to fathom what the words ``Sabbath blessing'' denote here. The phrase Shabbat shemevarekhin (25 y"z) refers to the special service recited on the Sabbath prior to the new moon, in which one of the prayers concludes ¶averim kol Yisra¥el, to which the congregation responds amen. Jokingly, the old man invites Isaac on the next opportunity, on the next Shabbat mevarekhim, to recite this formula, which will evoke the response of amen. Perhaps, too, the wise old man is instructing Isaac to reserve this high-sounding conviction for the liturgy, and not to rely on this phrase, even in Erets Israel. mkilr mely (Shalom ¦aleikhem) cr zelew ilewa lltzde micewxae dgnya eyxcn zial mqxetn eze` ` a (356) .yeciwa oke mkilr mely zxin`a jk .ezlitzn milzkd erfrcfpy Comes that famous man [the fraudulent Saint] to the study house with joy and dancing and prays at the top of his lungs until the walls are shaken by his prayer.

It is this usage that Harshav presents here for ba¥amirat shalom ¦aleikhem. However, it is a widely accepted practice to chant the hymn ``Shalom ¦aleikhem,'' which, I suggest, is what this rebbe (``saint'') did after he ®nished the prayer service, before reciting Kiddush (glossary, 647). The scene here is similar to that previously described (376 y"z)  mkilr mely xnel ligzd, which was correctly translated as ` `He started to say Peace Unto You'' (520) (perhaps ``to chant `Peace unto You' ''). Both passages refer to the same Sabbath hymn. </page> <page sequence="19"> 338 ❙ Avraham Holtz The phrase Shalom ¦aleikhem is also a component of the sancti®cation of the new moon ceremony.

Ben Zion (glossary, 644; pen name of Ben Zion Alter Guttmann [1870±1932]). S. Ben Zion, an already esteemed author, about eighteen years older than Isaac Kumer, is depicted thus: ,zenegd eipir zewidan df iynke ,repv iynk widan meg ca icba yeal lke ,dxiy ly d`p daihgk eleke ,epex`evl el dxeyw miphiit ly daipre (100) .dxiy wxt eitn `iveny dn wearing brown cloth clothes shiny as modest silk, and like that silk, his brown eyes are shining, and a poetic [read ``a poet's''] cravate is knotted at his collar, and his whole being is like a handsome column of poetry, and everything that comes out of his mouth is the verse of a poem. (133) The term dxiy wxt (perek shirah) evokes much more than ` `a verse of a poem.'' Perek shirah is an early medieval collection of biblical verses that all creatures and natural  </page> <page sequence="20"> On Barbara Harshav's Translation of Temol shilshom ❙ 339 phenomena chant early every morning in praise of God. Admiringly, the narrator  implies that every utterance of S. Ben Zion is as lyrical as these biblical verses that are sung each morning.35 After encountering the ultra-pious Reb Fayesh, Kumer's future father-in-law, at the end of the second watch of the night, Balak relaxes in the cool breezes and fantasizes about bodies of water in these words: i`exa lky dry dribde dipy zxeny` d`vi jk ezrca hheyn wlay cr lewl mixne`y mind md okid la` .dxiy mixne` dhn i`exa lke dlrn md okid .sk e`gni zexdp mixne`y zexdpd md okid .min oend ezz dyely mipy ` lnli` .xacnk zabepn milyexi .dxiy exn`iy zepiirnd rnyp dxiy wxt did `l div ignve milaye zepli` ly mipiipn dbepl ekldi jivg xe`l zxne` ynyd lew rnyp dry dze`a .milyexia (239) .dzpyn milyexi dxxerzp .jivg wxa By the time Balak rummaged around in his mind, the second watch of the night ended and the hour came when all heavenly creatures and all earthly creatures recite poetry. (326) The word shirah does indeed mean ``poetry,'' but it also connotes ``song'' or ``hymn,'' as in Shirat hayam, ``the Song of the Sea.'' However, the shirah referred to here is speci®cally Perek shirah, which is mentioned explicitly further on in this passage. The translated narrative continues: But where is the water that we say, When he uttereth his voice there is a multitude of waters? Where are the rivers of let the  ̄oods clap their hands? Where are the springs that will recite poetry? Jerusalem is wiped dry as a desert. (326±27) In the light of Perek shirah as the intertext of this description, the passage should read: ` `But where are the waters that chant: [ Jer. 10:13 = 51:16] When He uttereth His voice there is a multitude of waters.'' This is a direct quotation from Perek shirah </page> <page sequence="21"> 340 ❙ Avraham Holtz (ux` dvwn mi`yp dlrie minya min oend ezz lewl mixne` md dn min). It is not ``we'' who recite this verse; the waters themselves chant it.36 Similarly, ``Where are the rivers that recite: [Ps. 98:8] Let the  ̄oods clap their hands.'' In Perek shirah, the line reads: cgi sk e`gni zexdp mixne` md dn zexdp eppxi mixd. Finally, ` `Where are the springs to chant their hymn?'' Daily, according to Perek shirah, the springs intone the verse ja ipirn lk millgk mixye ``And whether they sing or dance, all my thoughts are in thee'' [Ps. 87:7]. The translation continues: ``If not for two or three Minyans of trees and stalks and desert plants, no poetry would be heard in Jerusalem.'' (327) This should read: ``If not for the three minyans of trees, stalks, and desert plants, Perek shirah would not be heard in Jerusalem.'' The narrative proceeds: ` `At that hour, the voice of the beadle was heard saying, At the light of thine arrows they went, and at the shining of thy glittering spear.'' The translator, unfamiliar with Perek shirah, misread the word as hashammash (the beadle), instead of hashemesh (the sun). Having decided to read the word as ``the beadle,'' she may have assumed that the feminine verb form zxne` (omeret) should be corrected to read xne` (omer). Having used the translation of Hab. 3:11 (although it is not italicized in OY), she might have noticed that the beginning of the verse mentions the sun (``The sun and moon stand still in their habitation''). Indeed, the Hebrew noun shemesh can be either masculine or feminine, and Perek shirah reads:37 wxa dbpl ekldi jivg xe`l dlaf cnr gxi yny :xne` `ed dn yny .jzipg Toward the end of the novel, the verses of Perek shirah are alluded to again in the reminiscence of Jerusalem's former glory, when all kinds of songbirds nested in them and sang songs to the Lord (612).

When it ®rst occurs, it is translated ``when he [a hasidic rebbe] passed before the Ark with the blessings'' (16). This literal translation may lead the English reader to envision the rebbe walking in front of the ark while reciting blessings. Subsequently, this idiom is rendered ``go to the Ark'' (166), ``went to the Ark'' (166), ``went to the Ark and prayed'' (359), ``Cantor standing before the Ark'' (365). In no case is there an indication that the person is conducting services. In one scene, a young man observes shiv¦ah in a Jerusalem hotel. A minyan gathers for prayer, and he ``was standing before the Ark'' (527). The service referred to here could have been held in an ark-less space. All the instances in which this idiom is used can be more accurately translated ``led the service.'' okecl dlr (¦Alah ladukhan; literally, ``went up on the platform'') One of the secondary characters, nicknamed ``Sweet Foot,''39 recalls his visit to Segera40 with Hemdat (OY 450±51; 326±27 y"z). In the scene describing the Segera synagogue, frequented almost exclusively by the resident Russian farmers who had converted to Judaism while yet in Russia, the bound phrase ¦alah ladukhan41 appears four times. The Russians urged Mr. Cohen ` `to go up to the stage to read the Torah'' (450). Not so. The Russians were requesting that he perform his duty as a Kohen by reciting birkat kohanim, ``the Priests' Blessing'' (Num. 6:24±26). This misinterpretation is especially puzzling since, four lines later, the phrase is translated accurately. We are told that Mr. Cohen ascended to the platform ``and blessed them with the Priests' Blessing'' (451). mici zlihp (Netilat yadayim, ritual hand washing) The Hebrew root lhp (n-t-l) in combination with the noun yad (hand) refers to a prescribed hand-washing ritual for which a cup or other vessel is used to pour water over the hands.42 Consistently, the verb lhp (n-t-l) is translated inaccurately by </page> <page sequence="23"> 342 ❙ Avraham Holtz some form of the verb ``dip'' throughout the novel (e.g., 66, 308±9, 543, 586). Dipping or immersing the hands is not considered a valid ful®llment of this ritual. The translation of the utensil used as a ``®ngerbowl'' (309) is also erroneous. The rare verb ` `lave,'' signifying to pour water over, would be more accurate. As this ritual is mentioned frequently, it deserves an entry in the glossary. devn zevn (Matsot mitsvah) As part of a series of learned conversations, Isaac overhears a discourse about the primacy of body over soul: m` elek qpkp in ,dkeq zevnl m`e .dligz ey`xe eci ,oilitz zevnl m` zevne zay zlik`l ,xnel jixv oi`e ,devn lkl `ed oey`x oke .`ed `l (368) .devn Indeed, its [the body's] hand and its head are the ®rst for the Com- mandment of Te®llin.

And it is ®rst for [sic; of?] all Commandments [the ®rst commandment being ``Be fruitful and multi- ply'' (Gen. 1:22)], not to mention eating on the Sabbath and the Commandment to perform a Commandment. (509) Unlike the enumerated components of this list, te®llin, sukkah, procreation, and the delights of food on Shabbat, the ®nal phrase in Harshav's translation does not relate to any physical pleasure. On the contrary, ful®lling ` `the commandment to perform a commandment'' would be a matter of will, a function of the soul, not of the body. The translation is based on a misreading of the Hebrew. The translator, apparently reading the unvocalized words as de ̈v§ n¦  ze©v§ n¦  (mitsvat mitsvah), added the words ` `to perform,'' which are not present in the original. The correct reading is  de ̈v§ n¦  zFSn©  (matsot mitsvah), ``[the eating of ] obligatory matsot,'' during the seder, in ful®llment of ``In the evening you should eat matsot'' (Exod. 12:18).43 This </page> <page sequence="24"> On Barbara Harshav's Translation of Temol shilshom ❙ 343 obligation requires the use of the body's hand and mouth, thus supporting the stated thesis that emphasizes the body's precedence over the soul. zay axr (¦Erev Shabbat) Harshav consistently translates zay axr (¦erev shabbat) as ``Friday evening.'' In common usage, ¦erev shabbat and ¦erev ¶ag are  ̄exible and include the entire daylight period prior to Shabbat or a holiday. Kumer, when in Ja2a, would swim (78, 420) and do his laundry (178) on Friday afternoons, and not on Friday evenings. Another error is the result of a misread preposition connected to the word ``night.'' Kumer reminisces: ``On the second night of Rosh HaShana, Father used to buy a bunch of grapes to make the blessing ` that we have lived to see this time' '' (79). Misreading the preposition l (for) with a (on), the translator strikes an inauthentic chord. In the small town of Shibush (Buczacz?), at the turn of the century, Simon Kumer, Isaac's father, would not purchase any food on the second night of Rosh Hashanah! The Hebrew (61 y"z) reads: dpyd y`x ly ipy lill, that is, ``For the second night of Rosh Hashanah, he would buy a bunch of grapes in order to be able to recite the shehe¶eyanu berakhah as is the custom'' [my translation]. These grapes served as ``new fruit,'' over which the shehe¶eyanu is recited.44 ohw zilh (Tallit katan), ziviv ly cba (Beged shel tsitsit) Kumer's Ja2a laundress asks him to let her launder ``the garment with ritual fringes'' (85).45 Later on, Shifra launders ``her father's small prayer shawl'' (522), called  ohw zilh (tallit katan) in the Hebrew (377 y"z). These two scenes refer to the same type of garment, not a ``prayer shawl,'' a tallit. Although related, since both have ritual fringes, the function, design, and shape of these garments are not the same. The ziviv ly cba (beged shel tsitsit, 65) is synonymous with the ohw zilh (tallit katan), the small tallit, also called rax` zetpk (arba¦ kanfot, 424 y"z, 585). According to Eastern European tradition, only married men wore tallitot, and only during services. The tallit katan is worn as an undergarment, all day, by all males, from an early age on. </page> <page sequence="25"> 344 ❙ Avraham Holtz U N R E C O G N I Z E D  L I T E R A R Y  A L L U S I O N S This category illustrates erroneous translations resulting from unidenti®ed biblical and rabbinic phrases embedded in the original Hebrew. eyxite epy (Shanu ufereshu) (64) eyxite epyy mixega d`ln eti dzid Ja2a was full of young fellows who had studied Talmud and had practiced exegesis. (83) The source of this idiom is B. Pesa¶im 49b: ``He that studied and gave it up [yxite, uferesh] is the worst of all.'' The translator, taking the verb eyxite (ufereshu) to mean ``interpret,'' missed the point to which the narrator alludes. The young fellows, once fervent talmudic students, have abandoned their studies and rejected Jewish ritual practices. epl did dn ie` (Oy meh hayah lanu) (424) .epl did dn ie` ,igext` My chick, oy what has got into us? (586) This is a direct quotation from a famous kinah, a poetic lamentation recited on the eve of Tish¦ah Be¥Av. The phrase, based on Lam. 5:1: epl did dn 'd xkf (zekhor Adonai meh hayah lanu, ``Recall, O Lord, what has befallen us''), repeated eighteen times as a litany in the ®rst of these kinot, is correctly translated as ``Oh, what has befallen us.''46 The situation in this passage in the novel evokes this profound Jewish response. As for ``my chick,'' this is probably a diglossia for the Yiddish mayn oyfele, and might better be rendered as ``my baby.''47 M I S L E A D I N G  L I T E R A L  T R A N S L A T I O N S  O F  I D I O M S Reviewers of Only Yesterday mention that Harshav's translation is often overly literal.

Dickstein notes that ``by trying to capture every measure of the Hebrew . . . Harshav occasionally sacri®ces readability for literal accuracy.''48 However, none of the critics mentions that these literal transla- tions may be misleading, as the following examples illustrate. dcneln miyp` zevn (Mitsvat anashim melummadah) This bound phrase appears three times in the novel, twice with reference to Isaac Kumer, and once with regard to Balak. As long as Isaac resided outside of Erets Israel, he observed the Sabbath, put on te®llin, and prayed daily ``as taught by the precept of men'' (267). This phrase appears again, with the appropriate adjustment for Balak's ``caninism,'' as ``All of Balak's behavior was taught by the precept of dogs'' (496). The three words dcneln miyp` zevn (mitsvat anashim melummadah) are a quotation from Isa. 29:13, ``And their fear of Me is a commandment of men learned by rote.'' This phrase has always denoted rote observance of any Jewish ritual practice, what A. J. Heschel terms ``religious behaviorism.''49 Indeed, Harshav correctly translates this term, toward the end of the novel, ` `As long as Isaac observed the Commandments as a learned habit'' (574). The ®rst two appearances of this phrase should be revised in light of the third, and should read: ` `As long as Isaac lived outside the Land, he kept the Sabbath, put on Te®llin, and prayed every day as a matter of habit.'' So, too, Balak: ``All of Balak's behavior was simply `dog-rote.' '' lekiak (Kivyakhol) As it is traditionally used, the term lekiak (kivyakhol) means ``as though it were possible,'' ``as it were'' referring to an anthropomorphous expression with reference to God,50 and as a result, the term became a substitute name for God in both Hebrew51 and Yiddish.52 When Reb Fayesh is brought home in a paralytic state, the narrator comments that ` `whatever He does, He does well. . . . He had warned the Children of Israel not to attack one another, but because of the voices of quarrel, His voice was not heard, the voice of the Almighty'' (328). ` `The voice of the Almighty'' is simply kivyakhol in </page> <page sequence="27"> 346 ❙ Avraham Holtz the Hebrew (239 y"z). In this context, its meaning is clearly ``as it were,'' that is, God's voice, as it were, is drowned out by the boisterous quarrels among the Jews. Similarly, an elderly matchmaker who remarks to Isaac: ` `There is no di2erence between the ®rst days and the last days except in the past I complained that the Holy-One-Blessed-Be-He, the Almighty, wasn't watching over me, and now I complain that I am not watching over Him, the Almighty'' (361). Again, kivyakhol (262 y"z) is rendered twice as ``the Almighty,'' whereas all that is needed is ``as it were.'' What the matchmaker declares, in brief, is this: In his youth he complained that God wasn't watching over him, as it were. He now complains he's not watching over God, as it were.53 rwxwd lr cner (¦Omed ¦al hakarka¦; literally, ``stand on the ground'') This phrase alludes explicitly to Rabbi Eleazar's statement in B. Yevamot 63a:  rwxwd lr cenrl zeiepne` ilra lk oicizr (``There will be a time when all craftsmen will take up agriculture [literally, `they shall stand upon the land']''), for it is said [Ezek. 27:29] ``And all that handle the oar, the mariners, and all the pilots of the sea, shall come down from their ships; they shall stand upon the land [ux`d lr ecenri (¦al ha¥arets ya¦amodu)].'' Read in the light of this intertext, the many appearances of this phrase in the novel refer to those who do or do not become farm workers. A closer look at one instance of this idiomatic phrase will highlight the issue of Harshav's misemphasis: ux`l dvega lblbzn df ekf ` ly eiykr .rwxwd lr micner eid ekf eli` (127) .oell dhp gxe`k `ed dfe If only they [Isaac and his close friend Rabinovitch] could stand on the ground. But since they couldn't, one is wandering around outside the Land and the other is like a guest for the night. (169) The Hebrew implies that, had Isaac and his comrades been lucky enough, they would have remained actual tillers of the soil of Erets Israel. However, now that they were not meritorious, one wanders about again in Europe, and the other is still a transient. </page> <page sequence="28"> On Barbara Harshav's Translation of Temol shilshom ❙ 347 oewiz (Tikkun), dpeek (Kavvanah) oewiz (tikkun) and dpeek (kavvanah) are two technical terms that convey fundamen- tal complex concepts in the kabbalistic lexicon, which prove extremely di3cult for anyone attempting to translate them.54 Describing the meticulous, pietistic eating habits of Reb Fayesh, the narrator says: eipir mver `edyk ,lk`e gp`zpe dqext el qxte ztd lr yiit 'x jxia erlape oey`xd mc` `hga eltpy zevevip owzl ogleyd zepeek oeekne (226) .xtrd ceqa Reb Fayesh made a blessing on the bread and sliced it and sighed and ate, closing his eyes and directing the intention of a served table to rise and repair the sparks that fell into the sin of the First Adam and were swallowed in the heart of the dust. (308) ogleyd zepeek (Kavvanot hashul¶an) are speci®c kabbalistic ritualized ceremonies, enumerated in Isaac Luria's (1534±72) prayer book,55 intended to make each Jew conscious of the mystical meanings and purposes of eating a meal, in order to mystically purge the sparks that were released when Adam sinned and that continue to infect all produce grown in the tainted soil. A more accurate translation of this passage is: ` `With shut eyes and spiritual concentration on the dinner table's mystical meanings, which purge the sparks that were released when Adam sinned and were absorbed in the essence of the earth, Reb Fayesh recited a berakhah over the bread, cut himself a slice, sighed and ate.'' In another passage with kabbalistic references, we read: ,dpenne dpenn lk ly eznyp yxey rcei didy ,miig ilztp 'x z` exikfd (372) .eileblb ceqe [T]hey mentioned Reb Naftali Haim, who knew the root of the soul of every single o3cer and the secret of his metamorphosis.

A commandment can hardly designate a person as its envoy. The Soncino translation of the Talmud renders this phrase more clearly, by stating ``those sent [to perform] a religious duty will not su2er harm.''58 The Soncino translation's addition of ``to perform'' is precisely what is missing in Harshav's literal translation.59 In each case, the phrase should read ``an envoy or an emissary sent to perform a religious duty.'' The entire scene in which Reb Fayesh, dubbed ``an emissary of the Commandment'' while plastering the billboards with excom- munication posters, which he deems a ` `mitsvah,'' is startled by Balak, paralyzed, and carried home with strokelike symptoms, more dead than alive, is Charlie Chaplin- esque, and perhaps even a satiric travesty of the rabbinic dictum. jpwfa zlwd (Hekalta bizkanekha) During an amicable chat, Moshe Amram, Shifra's grandfather, politely turns to Isaac and inquires about his beardless state of face: (207) ?jkl jze` dtek in l`xyi ux`a ,ux`l dvega jpwfa zlwd m` If you neglected your beard Outside the Land, in the Land of Israel, who forces you to do that? (280) ``To neglect one's beard'' implies that one does not attend to it, neither trimming nor shaping it. What Moshe Amram is really asking is: If, in the Diaspora, you were lax and did not observe the biblical prohibition against shaving the beard, what extenuating circumstances might there be here in Erets Israel that prevent you from observing the commandment against shaving the beard? </page> <page sequence="30"> On Barbara Harshav's Translation of Temol shilshom ❙ 349 seziyd zpen` (Emunat hashittuf ) yiy oin`n did `l seziyd zpen`a oin`ny envr lr cirdy it lr s` (154) .jk oin`ny l`xyin mc` Even though he claimed that he himself believed in polytheism, he didn't believe that there was even one person in Israel who would believe that. (208) The Hebrew term seziyd zpen` (emunat hashittuf ) most frequently applies to the Christian belief in monotheism in association with the doctrine of the trinity and the divinity of Jesus. This is not synonymous with ``polytheism.''60 The English rendition implies that Kumer's soon-to-be landlord, identi®ed with the historical Solomon Feingold (1865±1935), an avowed Jewish-Christian, questions whether there is any Jew who admits to Jesus' divinity. The Hebrew states that the anonymous landlord suspects that there is no Jew who a3rms the same belief as he about Jesus.61 I M P L I C I T  U N W A R R A N T E D  E M E N D A T I O N S A close reading of the following passages reveals emendations of Agnon's Hebrew text for no apparent reason. xfeg (1⁄4ozer), dfeg (1⁄4ozeh) (293) .`neqd xfegd lv` [aekln] uexi He'll [Malkhov] run to the blind seer. (404) From the translation of the word xfegd (ha¶ozer) as ``seer'' (as, for example, Jacob Isaac Ha¶ozeh MiLublin [1745±1815], the ``Seer of Lublin''), it appears that Harshav assumed that xfegd (ha¶ozer) is misspelled and should read dfegd (ha¶ozeh). But the noun with a x (resh), as printed, is correct.

The translator, I suspect, used the word idie vayhi, ``and it came to pass''), the start of the common clause dl`d mixacd xg` idie, ` `And it came to pass after these things,'' at the beginning of Gen. 48:1, the section in Parashat Vay¶i that contains the description of Judah.

Joseph Hayyim Brenner sensed something lyrical and melancholy (pathetisch) in the Jews of Zolkiew. M I S V O C A L I Z E D  R E A D I N G S Agnon's Hebrew texts are unvocalized.

(581) Reb Alter's response is a quotation from Zeph. 3:13: ``The remnant of Israel shall not do iniquity, nor speak lies.'' Apparently unaware that this is a biblical citation (it is not italicized in OY), the translator misread the word for ``iniquity'' (¦avlah) as ¦olah, a type of sacri®ce. The prophet makes no reference to any sacri®ce in this verse. The ®rst half of the sentence in the translation ``The Children of Israel may make a sacri®ce'' is incomprehensible in its context. Moreover, it is not clear how and why the crucial word `l (lo, ``no,'' or ``not'') was omitted or mistranslated as ``may,'' inasmuch as the Hebrew clearly states eyri `l (lo ya¦asu, ``they shall not do''). my (Shem/Sham) cenri epny ux`d z` miafer ep` m` .my epziilrl zexwl i`ck (124) .epixg` We should call it our ascendance there.

Instead of vocalizing the word shem (``name''), it was read as sham (``there''). The preposition l refers to the ascendance, so that the phrase means ``to give a name to our ascendance,'' using the familiar locution -l my `xw (kara shem le-, ``to give a name to''). The second sentence thus follows logically. oiqpb rhp liyrd (Heschel Noteh Gnessin / Heschel the scion of Gnessin) ixe` ly eia` ,oiqpb rhp liyrd 'xn ,cg` axn dxez ecnl xpxae aekln (291) .oiqpb oqip Malkhov and Brenner studied Torah from the same rabbi, Rabbi Heshel the scion of Gnessin, father of the writer Uri Nissan Gnessin.64 (402) Harshav incorrectly understood the unvocalized middle name rhp (nt¦) of Rabbi Gnessin (1840±1921) and read it as if it were vocalized neta¦, a plant, hence ``a scion.'' In fact, this common appellation ``Nata¦'' was pronounced by Polish and Galician Jews as ``Nuteh'' and by Russian and Lithuanian Jews as ``Nawteh'' or ``Noteh.'' (In contemporary Israel, it is ``Neta.'') Nosen Noteh (rhp ozp) was a popular pair of names.65 Uri Nissan Gnessin's father was Rabbi Heschel Noteh Gnessin. d`xnk (Kemar¥eh /Kemar¥ah) zyegp d`xnk aedv xie` uaex ux`l miny oiae ,dnge daedv ux`de (122) .xepza dewiqdy llw [T]he earth is yellow and hot, and between heaven and earth lies a yel- low air like a polished copper mirror heated in an oven.

It should be read Haradshkovitsi, named for the rabbi from Radshkovitz, that is, Rabbi Sha¥ul Binyamin Kerlitz Hakohen, who had served as rabbi in the community of Radshkovitz and toward the end of the nineteenth century came to Jerusalem, where he purchased property for a complex of buildings surrounding a courtyard, which he registered in his wife's name in the Turkish court and in his own name in the Jewish religious court.

Serakh deserves a comment in the glossary. miigd xe` (Or ha¶ayyim) The Hebrew commentary to the Pentateuch miigd xe` (Or ha¶ayyim, ``Light of Life'') is mentioned twice in this novel. The ®rst reference to it is mistranslated: (198) miigd xe` axd ``the Rabbi who wrote The Light of Light'' (268) The correct translation of the title is Light of Life. The second mention of this title appears in the context of Kumer's weekly Sabbath visits with Haim Rafael, his blind townsman. Isaac (OY 563) reads to him aloud from the Rashi commentary on the portion of the week and, time permitting, from the Or Ha-Haim (italicized in OY). One wonders how the English reader is to know that this reference is synonymous with the previously mentioned Light of Light/Life. One also wonders why neither this twice-mentioned commentary, nor its author, Rabbi 1⁄4ayyim ben Attar (1696±1743), appears in the glossary. ze`lhvi`d xney (Shomer ha¥itstela¥ot) (434) ze`lhvi`d xneye keeper of the icons (600) Should read ``keeper of the vestments,'' since the word `lhv` (itstela) means ``garment.''72 d"cpehex (Rotonde) (69) d"cpehex chapeau (90) The Hebrew d"cpehex (rotonde) is marked with a " (double apostrophe), to indicate a word in a foreign language.

One of the reviewers claims that the glossary's length is daunting.75 Had Harshav written a comprehensive glossary, it would have been at least twice as long. I have counted over forty names of historical ®gures mentioned in the novel but not identi®ed in the glossary. Similarly, approximately ten lesser-known places in Erets Israel are not included in the glossary. Some terms absent from the glossary include Thirteen Principles, Chapter of Reverence for God, Shmini Atseret, and Simhat Torah. A revised glosssary should also explain Manna Portion, ransom celebration for the ®rstborn of an ass (536), Perek Shirah, and le¶em mishneh (202 y"z, not ``plaited bread,'' as in OY 273). The same principle that governs such works as the Fables of Foxes (242), The Faithful Shepherd (496), and Tsena U-Rena (not Ve-Rena; 244), ought to have been applied to the books for which notations are missing: Torat ¶esed (513), The Paths of the World (16), The Way of the Righteous (32), The Hebrew Heart (elsewhere, A Hebrew Heart; 32, 515). The following glossary entries are inaccurate: Kapores (OY 647) (Kapparot) are described as ``the sacri®ce of a fowl on Yom Kippur to atone for human sins.'' This ritual of postbiblical origin is performed on the day before Yom Kippur. Moreover, the sacri®ce of fowl was not part of the Yom Kippur rites in Temple times.76 The entries for Tammuz and Av are inadequate. As noted in the glossary (651, 644), these are the fourth and ®fth months, according to the biblical calendar. However, according to the current, postbiblical calendar, these months are the tenth and eleventh months. The following appear di2erently in the text and in the glossary: AFEK (167) should be ``APAK'' (glossary, 643), ``Anglo-Palestine Company'' PIKA (169) should be ``PICA'' (glossary, 649) IKA (477) should be ``ICA'' (glossary, 647) Zunz (531) should be ``Zanz'' (glossary, 652) </page> <page sequence="38"> On Barbara Harshav's Translation of Temol shilshom ❙ 357 Dr. Thon (OY 51; 39 y"z) is identi®ed in the glossary (645) as Ozias [Yehoshua] Thon (1870±1936). This Dr. Thon remained living in Poland.77 However, his younger brother, Dr. Ya'akov Yo¶anan Thon (1880±1950), came to Erets Israel in 1907 and lived there until his death; he is the Dr. Thon referred to in this novel. An artist named ``Eliezer Karstin'' (261) is mentioned, but this is a misvocalization of Elazar Krestin.78 The glossary (644) includes a note on Joshua Heshel Buchmil (1869±1938), whose name is not mentioned in the novel, whereas ``Mrs. Buchmil'' appears (OY 471). Based on the glossary, the reader is led to assume that either Mrs. Buchmil (d. 1933) was Dr. Buchmil's relative, or that the author, for whatever reasons, transmuted a male historical ®gure into a ®ctional female character. Mrs. Shoshana Buchmil was a Zionist activist in her own right. She and her husband, Dr. Joshua Heshel Buchmil, spearheaded the founding of SHILOH (OY 112; 84 y"z). There is no entry that clari®es this short-lived organization or its ideology.79 Keeping in mind Barnstone's conclusion that ``better a magni®cent translation by Borges or Camus with a few mistakes than an `accurate' ponderous rendition, unredeemed by art,''80 readers of Only Yesterday will be amply rewarded. The roles and characterizations of the primary, secondary, and marginal ®gures appearing in this intriguing historical novel are not distorted by the linguistic di3culties that the translator encountered or by her deviations from the Hebrew. The plot lines and delightful digressions into fact and fantasy bring to life the ambience of Erets Israel at the turn of the last century, and will charm and engage contemporary English readers, as they have entertained Hebrew audiences for decades. Harshav's rendition transmits a substantial measure of Agnon's narrative virtuosity and storytelling genius.

The biblical Hebrew makes no reference to any direct object (i.e., ``their iniquity,'' ``destroyed them not''). The translation seems to be based on a misunderstanding, that Isaac Kumer is the subject of ``he,'' and it is he who forgave and did not destroy the other participants in the minyan. The subject of the verse is actually ``He,'' God, and these verses enumerate His merciful qualities without referring to any speci®c object. 31 On Kedushah, see EJ 10:875±77; and Elbogen, 54±62.

The second form is the declarative form; no question precedes the statement, as in Slifkin: ``[The object] says. . . .

The phrase tsim¶ei tsiyyah (OY ``plants'') does not appear in our version of Perek shirah. However, tsiyyah does appear in some versions as a bird (Slifkin, ``The Stormy Petrel,'' 245±50) and in others in the category of the elements of the earth. By adding the word tsim¶ei (``plants''), Agnon associates the word tsiyyah with the trees and plants, to mean plants that grow in arid places. On tsiyyah as desert, see Beit-Arie, 1:86 nn. 1±6. 38 On the origin of this phrase, Levine writes: ``The frequently recurring phrases in rab- binic literature `he who passes before the ark' and `he who goes down before the ark' refer to such a prayer leader. The person apparently stood on the  ̄oor of the synagogue below the ark and faced it. This may be the simplest way to understand the realia behind the phrase `to go down before the ark.' '' Lee I.

My research has led me to conclude that this is a not very ®ctionalized portrait of Isaac Kop. Dur- ing the later years of his life, Kop was the handyman of Talpiot, Jerusalem, the neighborhood in which Agnon resided. All informants concur that Agnon would frequently invite Kop for some household repair, for a hard drink or two, and for long story-sharing sessions. 40 About the history of Segera/Sejera/Ilaniyyah and its signi®cance during the Second Aliyah, read ``Ilaniyyah,'' EJ 8:1245±46; and Shulamit Reinharz, ``Manya Wil- bushowitz Shohat and the Winding Road to Sejera,'' in Pioneers and Homemakers: Jewish Women in Pre-State Israel, ed.

There is no entry about Sejera in the glossary. 41 As Levine writes: ``The place where the priests stood when blessing the people was called the dukhan and often the ceremony was referred to, primarily in Babylonian sources, as simply `ascending the dukhan,' '' The Ancient Synagogue, 498. See also Safrai, ``Dukhan, Aron and Teva,'' 69±71, on dukhan and the priestly blessing. ``Ascending to the dukhan'' is a technical term that refers only to the Kohanim as they recite the special blessing as stipulated in Numbers 6.

(OY 79) The ®nal clause ``and if . . . better'' distorts the intent of the context. Although in con- temporary Hebrew, the term ¦invei shu¦al (literally, ``fox grapes'') is applied to currants, the syntax and tone of this passage are grounded in an older meaning that denotes a class of inedible grapelike fruits. In other words, the grapes that Simon Kumer could a2ord to purchase for the shehe¶eyanu berakhah were of such inferior quality, their appellation as ``grapes'' notwithstanding, that the normally inedible lrey iapr (¦invei shu¦al) would have been better to eat. For the modern usage of ¦invei shu¦al as currants, see Jean Claude Corbeil, ed., Millon hazuti ¦Ivri-AngliÐVisual Dictionary, Hebrew version by Barukh Sarel and Rimonah Gerson ( Jerusalem: Karta, 1992), 74; and Yaacov Chaueka, Rav-Millim: Hamillon hashalem la¦ivrit ha¶adashah: Millon makkif ve¦adkani le¦ivrit bat zemannenu, 6 vols.

Once again the phrase ``the Almighty,'' coming after ``the Holy-One-Blessed-Be-He,'' is redundant. It should be replaced by ``as it were,'' since the anthropomorphic ``wheel of the eyes'' precedes it. One wonders why the translator rendered the expression ``wheel of the eye'' literally, whereas elsewhere (OY 449), it is translated more felicitously as ``eyeball.'' 54 Note that Gershom Scholem avoids translating these terms. Instead, at various points, he explicates their evolving, multivalenced denotations. Thus, for example, he states: ``Extinction of the stain, restoration of harmony that is the meaning of the word tikkun, which is the term employed by the Kabbalists after the period of the Zohar, for man's task in the world'' (Scholem, Major Trends, 233). According to the doctrine of Isaac Luria (1534±1572), tikkun ``restores the unity of God's name'' (275). Similarly, the term kavvanah, particularly in relation to prayer, becomes an integral component of the process of tikkun. As such, it is ``a most powerful factor, if used by the right man in the right place'' (276). On kavvanah, read also EJ 10:627±30; and on tikkun, EJ 10:615±19. 55 See, for example, Seder te®llah mikol hashanah im kavvanat Ha¥ari (Koretz: Lieber, 1794; repr.

On 8b, there is a fuller version of this adage: ``Those sent [to perform] a religious duty will not su2er harm neither in their going nor in their returning.'' Note that the translation inserts the verb ``to perform.'' 59 As is well known, the Hebrew/Yiddish term mitsvah has a far wider range of conno- tations than ``commandment'' (with either a lower- or uppercase c). As Heschel writes, ``A de®nition or paraphrase of the word mitzvah is di3cult to frame. It denotes not only commandment, but also the law, man's obligation to ful®ll the law, and the act of ful®lling the obligation or the deed, particularly an act of benev- olence or charity'' (Heschel, God in Search of Man, 361 and esp. 352±65). 60 On the question of Christianity and its belief system vis-aÁ-vis Judaism, see David Berger, The Rebbe, the Messiah and the Scandal of Orthodox Indi2erence (London: Littman Library of Jewish Civilization, 2001), especially appendix 3, ``Tosafot on `Association (``Shituf ''),' '' 175±77, and appendix 2, ``The Parameters of Avodah Zarah,'' 159±74. 61 On Solomon Feingold, see Mordechai Eliav and Yosef Lang, ``Shelomo Feingold: Mumar o yehudi ne¥eman le¦ammo?
