I am struck by the extraordinary range of projects, though I can de- tect a rise in studies of religion, allegory, and romance, a fluctua- tion in the stock of certain authors-lots of Sir Philip Sidney but almost no Andrew Marvell-and a waning interest in high theory. As in the economy, settlement and stock-taking follow a period of delirious speculation. A significant minority of this year's books offer dense empirical documentation or corrective revisions of earlier generalizations. But emergent scholars feel the pressure to theorize, to philosophize, to psychoanalyze, to politicize, which often leads to feverishly exaggerated theses. I still think after read- ing these ninety titles that they constitute a collective enterprise. Paradoxically, however, what unites us is not so much a common subject as a common drive to fix our ideas in book form-an obsessive and isolating activity that no one in her right mind would undertake. If this review sometimes sounds like a catalog of ickesftxes, believe me when I assure you-like the hack au- thor in Jonathan Swift's Tale of a Tub-that I belong in the same institution. We give the most credit to scholarly monographs from refer- eed presses, and my review will concentrate on these. (I have omitted a few volumes whose typography and binding look too James Grantham Turner is the author of The Politics of Landscape: Rural Scenery and Society in English Poetry, 1630-1660 (1979), One Flesht Paradisal Marriage and Sexual Relations in the Age of Milton (1987), Libertines and Radicals in Early Modern London: Sexuality, Politics, and Literary Culture, 1630-1685 (2001), and numerous articles on literature, art, and culture from the sixteenth to the eighteenth centuries. He has edited two volumes of essays, one on Milton's prose (with David Loewenstein) and one on Renaissance sexu- ality and gender. Turner teaches at the University of California, Berkeley.</page><page sequence="2">174 Recent Studies amateurish; I admit that the concept of a "vanity press" may be untenable when university presses demand large cuts or mas- sive subventions, but they still maintain high standards of refer- eeing and copy editing.) We all know that good work is increasingly done in what we might call polygraphs, collaborative volumes and special issues of journals; a healthy crop of these will be noted briefly below, but I am afraid that to review them properly would double the size of this essay. The monograph does demand far higher powers of synthesis, consistency, and argument, so its relative privilege is justified. But it suffers from two dangers, one internal and one external. First, monographia is allied to mono- mania, and we are often tempted to make excessive claims for the motif we have invested so much time in researching. Second, publishers are undermining the genre by forcing prices up and page-count down, according to the self-fulfilling prophecy that nobody can afford monographs any more. Unfortunately, I can only make passing reference to what used to be called textbooks, commissioned guides and companions that sometimes elicit the contributors' best work. Three of them should be cited here for the sheer scale of the endeavor, however. L'Epoque de la Renaissance (1400-1600); Tome IV: Crises et Essors Nouveaux (1560-1610), a fifty-six-chapter volume edited by Tibor Klaniczay, Eva Kushner, and Paul Chavy, is part of the UNESCO- funded Comparative History of Literatures in European Lan- guages; though it does end with the late Frank Warnke quoting "Our revels now are ended / La fete est maintenant finie" (pp. 771-2), theftte itself feels like an immense Euro-party where the familiar English faces are lost in the crowd-a useful corrective to Anglocentrism, but unlikely to become an everyday work of reference. Blackwell's Companion to English Renaissance Litera- ture and Culture, edited by Michael Hattaway, looms even larger, with sixty chapters on a truly comprehensive range of topics of interest to the monoglot. And Andrew Hadfield's The English Re- naissance, 1500-1620 in the series Blackwell Guides to Litera- ture-lucid little introductions to issues, authors, and texts, aimed at the undergraduate but also useful for Ph.D. students-is re- markable because he wrote it all himself (in the same year that he edited 7he Cambridge Companion to Spenser). Biographies are still harder to categorize and review. Mono- graphic in form and focus, often heroic in scale, they neverthe- less fall between the categories of original critique and factual reference tool, specialized and general reader, trade and academic publishing (a fact reflected in their reasonable pricing). Biogra-</page><page sequence="3">James Grantham Turner 175 phies raise urgent questions: is the Intentional Fallacy dead? what do we need to know in order to know "literature"? This year pub- lishers have sent lives of an Elizabethan sea dog apparently un- connected to authorship (James McDermott's Martin Frobisher: Elizabethan Privateer), a Protestant reformer crucial to the his- tory of the English Bible (David Daniell's William Tyndale: A Biog- raphy), and a charismatic wizard and doctor who mentions several writers in his journals (Barbara Howard Traister's The Notorious Astrological Physician of London: Works and Days of Simon Forman), as well as Barbara K. Lewalski's immense Life of John Milton: A Critical Biography, a magisterial work that Miltonists should be mining for generations to come. BIRTH ANNOUNCEMENTS Monographs this year tend to cluster around a few great men, canonically conservative even when they proclaim their radical hermeneutics. So I would like to begin, by contrast, with a trib- ute to scholarly editing of texts and anthologies, and scholarly enquiry into their transmission. Some of this year's volumes do push forward older projects, cementing memorials to the great, but presses have also committed themselves to editions of shad- owy minor figures. Some are newly "discovered" women writers, some coterie poets from the aristocracy. Poems that I had to dredge up from manuscript when researching The Politics of Landscape can now be consulted in hard covers with full commentary and critical apparatus. The indispensable Oxford Francis Bacon picks up speed, with The Advancement of Learning edited by Michael Kiernan and a volume of The Instauratio Magna: Last Writings edited by Gra- ham Rees, the latter with facing-page translations of all seven opuscula. Princeton has reissued Allardyce Nicoll's edition of Chapman's Homer: 'The Odyssey" in paperback, with a breezy new preface by Garry Wills that emphasizes the chastened lucid- ity and dynamism of George Chapman's pentameters, in con- trast to the archaic fourteeners of his Iliad. M. L. Stapleton has edited a less well known rendition, Thomas Heywood's Art of Love: The First Complete English Translation of Ovid's "Ars Amatoria." The Variorum Edition of the Poetry of John Donne: Volume 2, The Elegies, weighs in at over 1100 pages, the text edited by a team headed by Gary A. Stringer and the commentary compiled by John R. Roberts with Diana Trevinio Benet. Sampling the com- mentary suggests that the cut-off date for critical reading was</page><page sequence="4">176 Recent Studies 1991, so that (for example) Janel Mueller's important reconstruc- tions of the genealogy of Sappho to Philaenis go unrecorded. This makes a curious counterpart to the habit, prevalent in many first books, of citing no article over ten years old. The Poetry of Mildmay Fane, Second Earl of Westmoreland, edited from three manuscripts by Tom Cain, gives us some 500 poems by a very productive author, an endearing jumble of po- litical lampoons, devotional lyrics, commendations (including one for the poems of Margaret Cavendish, p. 292), and country-house poetry, some of it quite new to me (e.g., "Fulbeck," pp. 333-4). Fane is never likely to make it into the top ten, but he does illus- trate how to have a full life in poetry without making it a career, and his experiments with the Horatian ode on topical subjects provide an interesting comparison with Marvell. Another mano- rial manuscript (now at the Huntington Library) constitutes a valuable record of a Catholic gentry family's literary activity, in- cluding some poems plausibly authored by the female compiler (previously best known from the obscure 1813 Tixall Poetry). Deborah Aldrich-Watson's The Verse Miscellany of Constance Aston Fowler: A Diplomatic Edition should speak to a growing interest in women's literary collaboration, in English Catholic literature, and in manuscript publication and the coterie culture that en- couraged it. I'm thinking not only of recent work by Margaret Ezell, Arthur F. Marotti, Alison Shell, and Harold Love, but of several edited essay collections in this year's batch, such as Mark Pincombe's The Anatomy of Tudor Literature (especially Natasha Distiller's chapter on Mary Sidney) and Literary Circles and Cul- tural Communities in Renaissance England, by the venerable team of Claude J. Summers and Ted-Larry Pebworth. The two most striking discoveries in women's writing are David Norbrook's edition of Order and Disorder, a Biblical narrative now believed to be Lucy Hutchinson's, only part of which had ever been printed, and the Collected Writings of Elizabeth Jane Weston, eruditely translated and edited by Donald Cheney and Brenda M. Hosington. Westonia, once celebrated throughout Europe as a new Sappho and an Amazon of the arts (p. 162), barely belongs in "English literature" since she wrote in Latin and lived in Bohemia, where her stepfather (John Dee's crystal gazer) died in jail and left her destitute. Correct, versatile, occasional, and largely impersonal (except for the appeals for financial help), Weston's poems and epistles are perhaps more remarkable for their exist- ence than for any individual moment, though the epigram on wealth that ends "Gaza quid est? pulvis; pulveris umbra? nihil!"</page><page sequence="5">James Grantham Turner 177 (p. 120) did strike me as the model for Sor Juana Ines de la Cruz's great sonnet on her portrait, which similarly closes "es cadaver, es polvo, es sombra, es nada." It would be nice to think of Latin as the medium for women poets to influence one another across two continents. As for Order and Disorder, Norbrook launched in the TLS a powerful case for Hutchinson's authorship of this vast couplet meditation on Genesis, coeval with Paradise Lost, and now backs it up with a modern-spelling edition that combines the printed text and the Yale manuscript, once owned by the earl of Rochester's mother. The work in its handwritten form is titled Genesis and unfinished (pp. 6, 258), and conceivably might have worked its way through the entire Bible chapter by chapter, out- doing Milton in its ambition to overlay Scripture with a poem that ostensibly subserves it. As the next step in this rediscovery of radical women's religious verse, someone could perhaps edit the expanded second edition of Anna Trapnel's A Voice for the King of Saints, an immense improvised poem far longer than Para- dise Lost and Order and Disorder combined. Who is going to use these new editions? Other long and hard- to-read texts have begun to filter into the canon, as we see this year from the work of Helen Hackett and Sheila T. Cavanagh (below) on Mary Wroth's Urania, part 2 of which was only pub- lished from the Newberry MS last year. Weston is cited in Jane Stevenson's important article on "Female Authority and Authori- zation Strategies in Early Modern Europe," in the excellent essay collection "The Double Voice": Gendered Writing in Early Modern England, edited by Danielle Clarke and Elizabeth Clarke; but Hutchinson seems to appear neither in that volume nor in Henk Dragstra, Sheila Ottway, and Helen Wilcox's collection of essays, Betraying Our Selves: Forms of Self-Representation in Early Mod- ern English Texts (though these essays touch on other authors of current interest, such as Wroth and Pietro Aretino). Neither writer plays a role in Ramona Wray's "Anthologising the Early Modern Female Voice," in The Renaissance Text: Theory, Editing, Textuality, edited by Andrew Murphy (listed below), nor in the fascinating theme-based medley of Female and Male Voices in Early Modern England: An Anthology of Renaissance Writing, put together by Betty S. Travitsky and Anne Lake Prescott. Weston is not men- tioned in the useful collection of essays on Teaching Tudor and Stuart Women Writers, edited by Susanne Woods and Margaret P. Hannay, and scattered references to Hutchinson do not earn her a section of her own. Maybe she does not speak in what sounds like a woman's voice to modern ears. On the other hand,</page><page sequence="6">178 Recent Studies Hutchinson gets a good selection in Alan Rudrum, Holly Nelson, Joseph Black, and Holly Faith Nelson's Broadview Anthology of Seventeenth-Century Verse and Prose, an unwieldy, floppy tome from a small but helpful press, while she and Weston are both included in the outstanding Oxford anthology Early Modern Women Poets (1520-1700), assembled by Stevenson and Peter Davidson. This work of amazing erudition includes other Latinists as well as poems in Scots, French, Welsh, Scots Gaelic, and Irish. On the subject of anthologies old and new, printed and manu- script, Anne Ferry distills a lifetime of reading into Tradition and the Individual Poem: An Inquiry into Anthologies; though her range is as broad as the language, she does devote several sections to Richard Tottel's Miscellany, and a chapter to the role of Elizabe- than and seventeenth-century poems in later canon formations. Ferry's subtle interpretation of anthology titles such as Gallery, Bower, or Cabinet might whet the appetite for Marjorie Swann's finely detailed study of a larger phenomenon, the collecting im- pulse that turns the entire universe into an anthology. Curiosi- ties and Texts: The Culture of Collecting in Early Modern England is (like its subject) a large gathering of heteroclite texts and con- cepts held together by ingenious erudition. I was amused to see myself among these kickshaws, chapter 3 ("The Countryside as Collection") having the subtitle "Chorography, Antiquarianism, and the Politics of Landscape"; I think Swann would have ben- efited from the idea of landscape as a system of interrelated vi- sual and social values, rather than interpreting all this local literature as a box in which to put objects. She does not dwell on the intrinsic interest of these objects or the mind of the collector, but instead claims (for example in the Bacon chapter) that the point of collection was to gather social status and patrons along with dried fish, medals, and "the Skin on the Buttock of a Rhi- noceros" (p. 86). As a further step she applies her model to litera- ture: Ben Jonson and Robert Herrick assemble their own fragments into a collection, conceive of their friends and address- ees as collectible precious stones, and even "fabricate a new model of selthood" (p. 193). I loved the Wunderkammer quality of this book but found its larger theses unconvincing: why do we need to make grandiose claims for the materials we have unearthed, to adopt the guise of psychohistorians or social anthropologists or grand theorists of identity?</page><page sequence="7">James Grantham Turner 179 UTOPIA, ROMANCE, EROTICA In the year that Thomas More became the patron saint of politicians, Utopia flourished: Yale brought out a nicely produced new translation by Clarence H. Miller, who also wrote a useful introduction that conveys some of the stylistic quirks and incon- sistencies of the Latin, and Oxford World's Classics' Three Early Modern Utopias combined it with Bacon's New Atlantis and Henry Neville's Isle of Pines. The editor, Susan Bruce, uses the 1556 version of Ralph Robinson's translation, adding excellent notes and samples of the playful letters that surrounded other early editions and made Utopia a "collaborative enterprise" (p. xliii). And the eminent historian Carlo Ginzberg discusses the genre and impact of Utopia in No Island Is an Island: Four Glances at English Literature in a World Perspective, essays that emulate the indirection of Michel de Montaigne and the erudition of Arnaldo Momigliano. (Ginzburg's second Renaissance chapter circles around the debate over rhyme and shifting conceptions of "bar- barous" and "classical" poetry, suggestively touching on Roger Ascham, George Puttenham, Sidney, and Samuel Daniel, but never quite fulfils the promise of its title, "Selfhood As Otherness: Constructing English Identity in the Elizabethan Age.") Against Quentin Skinner's emphasis on De optimo reipublicae statu in More's title, Ginzburg picks out the words libellus festivus. Be- ginning with trompe-l'oeil effects in the collaborative tributes that surround Utopia, he relates it to the ideal of serio ludere, carnival or "festive" wisdom in the tradition of Lucian (whose dialogues were translated as opusculafestivissima and bound with More's fable). This genealogy is already quite familiar, and the conclu- sion rather flat: Lucian and More manage to be both serious and playful, so there is no unsettling clash of perspectives. But Ginzburg has unearthed a few fascinating details, specific links to the Saturnalia, and a concrete instance of Utopia taken seri- ously as a blueprint for reform in Mexico. If, as Ginzburg cleverly puts it, no island is an island, then no period is a period. Andrew King's 'The Faerie Queene" and Middle English Romance: The Matter of Just Memory emphasizes the "pro- foundly important" connections between Spenser's poem and its predecessors (p. vii) and implicitly undermines the notion of the Renaissance as a unique emergency. Ginzburg attributes Daniel's rediscovery of medieval poetry as "national history" to the French historian Francois Bauduin (No Island, pp. 41-2), but King points to the long tradition of Tudor nativist historiography, which re-</page><page sequence="8">180 Recent Studies cruited Piers Plowman as well as the Venerable Bede into its he- roic narrative of British antiquity and proto-Protestant virtue (chap. 1). But did vernacular romance enjoy the same Tudor re- vival? Medieval poems such as Bevis of Hampton were certainly printed for popular consumption, but elite readers famously con- demned them as crude, monkish, bawdy, and violent. Neverthe- less, as King vividly proves, Spenser did borrow many motifs from the romances, including the amorous pursuit of the Elfin Queen that Chaucer made so ridiculous in Sir Thopas (pp. 9-10). Spenser could translate the corniest material into high seriousness when it matched or foreshadowed Protestant ideas of salvation: the dragon slayer who fails and needs to be revived by a magic well that appears as if by accident; the abandoned orphan who grows up in lowly plight with a mysterious sense of a higher goal; the pure damsel who survives slander and trickery. King handles these narrative elements convincingly, but I start to lose the Middle English connection when he explores more complicated aspects of memory, material setting, and what he calls the Looking-Glass relationship between romance and history. The final chapters, perhaps revelatory to a Spenser specialist, seem less incisive than the first, which brilliantly presents The Shepheardes Calender as itself a foundling bastard, in rustic-archaic garb but bearing signs of noble ancestry. Many of the romance themes that Andrew King stresses in Middle English were common property of the European novel from antiquity. Hackett's Women and Romance Fiction in the English Renaissance makes a good case for Iberian romances such as Amadis and Palmerin as conduits of narrative motifs that at the same time expand the definition of female virtue, offering chaste heroines who consummate their relations outside marriage but remain faithful to their lovers (chap. 4). Hackett makes her way deftly and perceptively through many texts and many issues, since "Women" in her title refers to female characters, to female read- ers real and imagined, and to female authors: though she men- tions Marguerite de Navarre only in passing, she pays due attention to Margaret Tyler's translation of the Spanish Mirror of Courtesy (pp. 57-62) and devotes a final chapter to Lady Mary Wroth's two unfinished Uranias. (Hackett proves Wroth's inherit- ance from Iberian romance and female martyrology, but also brings out her sardonic wit, her post-Quixote self-consciousness, and her "passionate" involvement of the reader in strong emotion and "crackling dialogue"; quite aware of "post-post-structuralist" anxieties, she still asserts the power of fiction to convey "lived</page><page sequence="9">James Grantham Turner 181 experience" [pp. 176, 181-2].) Like Juliet Fleming and others, Hackett concentrates on authors' addresses to supposed female readers, "insinuating and disdainful" (p. 84) in John Lyly, George Pettie, or Barnabe Rich, affectionate but potentially self-emascu- lating in Sidney. But she also emphasizes the strong positive appeal (at the time if not for modern romance theorists) of hero- ines who combine inner strength with tortured, saintly virtue-a taste that becomes quite "necrophiliac" in the New Arcadia (p. 119). Hackett's adroit and measured readings take in the whole range of fiction from William Painter to Robert Greene ("the Homer of Women"), both Arcadias, The Faerie Queene, and Shakespeare's romance sources. She deals concisely with several topics that have also generated entire books this year, for example mother- hood and the hazards of birth (pp. 151-8, see Theresa M. Krier below), Amazons (pp. 112-14, 134-5, see Kathryn Schwarz be- low), and Wroth-expounded in greater detail, yet more diffusely, in Sheila T. Cavanagh's Cherished Torment: The Emotional Geog- raphy of Lady Mary Wroth's "Urania. " Cavanagh goes further than Hackett, however, in documenting Wroth's command of geopo- litical and cosmographic knowledge. Erotic writing in the Judeo-Christian West effectively begins with the Song of Solomon, and Noam Flinker studies its influ- ence attentively in 'The Song of Songs" in English Renaissance Literature: Kisses of Their Mouths. He makes a particularly full case for William Baldwin's 1549 Canticles or Balades of Salomon, apparently "the earliest collection of English poetry ever published [in print]" (p. 32), which he uses as a seminal text to bring out Canticlean echoes in Spenser, Shakespeare, Donne, Milton, and Marvell, as well as in such curiosities as Robert Aylett's Brides Ornaments, which recasts the Song as a Spenserian epic. The book begins with an immense and ambitious panorama. Flinker's introduction cites Canticle-like elements in poetry from ancient Sumer to Guido Cavalcanti, Dante, Chaucer, and Umberto Eco, and locates the hermeneutic issues raised by the Song in the largest issues of rabbinical Midrash: he finds unresolved and perpetually generative tensions, not only between spiritual and carnal (as one would expect with this most erotic of scriptures) but between oral and written. The closing chapters return to Flinker's special expertise in the Ranters and Milton, who recapitulates the key themes of the Canticles tradition in secular works (such as the Italian sonnets) and in Paradise Lost. Carefully separating the Ranters' doctrines from hostile caricatures (thereby modify- ing my interpretation in One Flesh), Flinker has Milton respond- ing fully to their dream of prelapsarian and Solomonic sexuality.</page><page sequence="10">182 Recent Studies The Song of Songs plays a strong role in Krier's Birth Pas- sages: Maternity and Nostalgia, Antiquity to Shakespeare, though her goal is less literary-historical than psychoanalytical. Early modern birth was neither medicalized nor privatized, but took place in a crowd of witnesses and (presumably supportive) fe- male "gossips." In a similar spirit, Krier assembles a group of theorists who cooperate and compete over her readings of birth, nurture, maternal language, and "absorption into the chthonic mother" in the Song, Spenser, Shakespeare, Lucretius, and Chaucer; as in some paintings of the birth of Mary, the author seems at times to disappear as Luce Irigaray, D. W. Winnicott, and Melanie Klein dominate the foreground. I don't care much for the psychoanalytic episteme myself, finding it closed and self- referential in whatever form, but Krier's ingenious recombina- tion of authorities certainly stimulates her invention and expands the range of affects that the critic can admit, from desire and anxiety to "praise, celebration, exultation, exaltation, gratitude, and transformation" (p. xiv). In her companion chapters on the Song and Spenser's Amoretti/Anacreontics/Epithalamium, she sets aside the by-now-orthodox assumption that blazon equals butchery, and instead appreciates the dynamism and fecundity of the praise poem in a style flowing with milk and honey. Krier does find some resentment in the early Amoretti sonnet "Ye tradeful Merchants" (which horrifies several of this year's authors), but her developmental model allows her to sympathize with the "de- manding baby" in Spenser (p. 87), indeed to accept aggression as a necessary stage in coming to terms with the mother. If Krier's theory is applied to literary history as well as families, the Song itself becomes the mother. A more secular source is documented in Ian Frederick Moulton's Before Pornography: Erotic Writing in Early Modern England. Like David Frantz in Festum Voluptatis, Moulton is fas- cinated by the sexual writings and reputation of Aretino, and feels a sense of discovery in summarizing them for an English readership and assembling allusions to the Aretine from England as well as Italy. These paraphrases are lively and often apprecia- tive, but they do not really make a scholarly contribution to Aretino studies; Moulton misses some crucial writings recently edited from MSS, and commits a serious error by captioning a nine- teenth-century wash drawing as an original engraving from Marcantonio Raimondi's Modi (fig. 3.3). Instead, he spends too much time proving that Aretino does not fit the misogynist model of twentieth-century "pornography," which he had (rightly) re-</page><page sequence="11">James Grantham Turner 183 jected as irrelevant in his introduction. How then does this Ital- ian material relate to the title theme, erotic writing in early mod- ern England? Moulton's strategy is to establish the varieties of erotic writing in part 1, taking us through bawdy manuscript verse (chap. 1), dramatic representation of the dominatrix (in The Custom of the Country), antitheatrical polemic and the defense of emotion in poetry, faltering male heroes in The Faerie Queene, and Ovidian elegy in Christopher Marlowe (chap. 2); though the connecting theme of this chapter is the link between fears of ef- feminacy and concerns for the nation, this relates only intermit- tently to the wide variety of texts gathered under the "erotic" rubric. Only after page 109 does Moulton turn to 1520s Italy, via Ascham's famous sneer at the inglese italianato, to begin the biography of Aretino and his emulators. Though this Aretine midsection leads quite plausibly to chapters on Thomas Nashe and Jonson, whose Epicoene is compared to Aretino's Marescalco, the unity of the book becomes increasingly strained as different aspects of Aretino-not necessarily his sexual writings-are brought in for comparison with each new text. Before Pornography contains many good elements-detailed research into manuscripts uncovers some revealingly infantile poems on the genitalia, though it would be hard to call them erotic; perceptive close reading of Nashe's Choice of Valentines (or Dildo) proves the "fragility of masculine gender identity" (p. 178), though the connection to Aretino is surpris- ingly weak-but I do not think it coheres as a book. No such focus problems mar Schwarz's Tough Love: Amazon Encounters in the English Renaissance. This stimulating and oc- casionally frustrating book overflows with Amazon lore from an- tiquity, England, and even Scotland, where John Knox expresses the fear that "the whole world [might] be transformed into Ama- zons" (p. 12). I kept expecting to find the most dazzling example of sexual Amazonics, the "realm of women" in Orlando furioso 19.54-20.95. But gaps in coverage need not matter in a set of meditations on the larger significance of the Amazon figure, each one anchored in a major text (Sir Walter Ralegh's Guiana, the Faerie Queene and the old Arcadia, Henry VI, Midsummer Night's Dream, and Timon, Jonson's masques for Queen Anne). In explo- ration narratives such as Ralegh's, Amazons are everywhere and nowhere, always another day's journey away and yet always on the mind of those who name rivers and draw maps; Schwarz can thus use them as a metonym for all kinds of boundary blurring, gender confusion, and defamiliarization of the domestic (chap. 1). In Shakespeare's early Henriad (chap. 2) the keyword Amazon</page><page sequence="12">184 Recent Studies appears only three times, but with significant variations that map out the progress, not just of the characters (Joan of Arc and Queen Margaret), but of the free-floating signifiers masculine and female: "Margaret's performance at once detaches masculinity from male- ness and makes visible the sense in which maleness is contin- gent on the actions of women" (p. 103), while Jonson's Amazon-related masques (chap. 3) "define authority and identity ... as changeable conditions of performance" (p. 1 10). I sense in Schwarz's second part, on "Homoeroticism and Home Life," a certain nostalgia for the decades when Amazons could simply be equated with the militant lesbian (pp. xi-xii, 176). Schwarz's list of their "inappropriate sexual objects" ends with "possibly-although it is a largely and strangely silent possibil- ity-other women" (p. 5), but this possibility, like the "real" Ama- zons in Guyana, is always just round the next bend in the river. (The silence can partly be filled with Harriette Andreadis's Sappho in Early Modern England: Female Same-Sex Literary Erotics, 1550- 1 714, which deals mostly with the later seventeenth century but which does review the Sappho to Philaenis literature and gather some relevant pre- 1650 passages, in a weirdly antiquarian ty- pography.) Schwarz does make brilliantly suggestive use of al- most-lesbian moments, as when Spenser's Britomart sleeps with ladies (chap. 4) or when Sidney's Philoclea fancies Cleophila and does not breathe a deep enough sigh of relief when she turns out to be he (chap. 5). But these sparkling readings all too often yield the same generalization, repeatedly asserted by quotation from a theo- rist rather than fresh engagement with the primary text: Amazons are credited with a fantastic range of subversive activity, "exposing the wilfulness of construction" (pp. 126, 152, 181, 227), disman- tling, destabilizing, revealing precarious foundations, highlighting the natural order as "a state of contested performance" (pp. 127, 149, 160, 218). (Judith Butler warns that "multiplying an assump- tion exposes its flaws" [p. 217], and here the sense of quasi-scho- lastic subservience to authority is amplified by the mechanical tic of introducing quotes with the invariant formula "x writes" plus comma.) The panache is part of the Amazon's outfit, but so is the sword; bravura generalizations are not enough to kill the lion. Two chapters of Graham L. Hammill's Sexuality and Form: Caravaggio, Marlowe, and Bacon fall within the scope of this re- view. By choosing three disparate figures linked by rumors of sodomy, Hammill sets himself the challenge of finding other com- mon elements that might arch over the disciplines. The claim is ambitious and exciting: the civilizing process and the Baconian</page><page sequence="13">James Grantham Turner 185 scientific revolution are limited, even temporarily blocked, by sex and "sexed thinking"-deduced "not simply from the content" of thought but from "the various disjunctions between forms and substances upon which these lines of thinking insist"; he will therefore choose works that "conceive of sex not simply as one aspect ... but as a horizon of interpretation and a threshold of thinking" (p. 1). Nevertheless Hammill is surprisingly reticent about discussing either sexuality or form, though he is ready with erudite speculations on virtually every other subject. Chap- ter 5 constructs a tenuous case for Bacon's "sexual poesis" (p. 139) out of his addiction to enemas and his use of the phrase "give yourself to me" in The Masculine Birth of Time, addressed to an imaginary "son" mistranslated as "boy"; meanwhile, Joabin's denunciation of Western sexual practices in The New Atlantis, the only directly relevant passage cited from Bacon, is hurried in at the end without emphasizing the phrase "masculine love" (p. 167). In the Marlowe chapter, Hammill proposes that "the herme- neutics of sodomy" mediates relations among the on-stage char- acters and between the play and the spectator (pp. 97-8). But he uses sodomy as a kind of universal covert signified, detaching it from its historical referent by claiming that evidence for genital acts "would be no guarantee whatsoever of sodomy," that "sexual acts themselves are never proof of sodomy" (p. 1 16). (This urban legend is corrected by Kenneth Borris in The Affectionate Shep- herd: Celebrating Richard Barnfteld, pp. 196-7, a collection of essays edited by Borris and George Klawitter that emphasizes the Ganymedic aspect of Barnfield's pastorals.) The "emergence of the sodomitical" in Faustus-keystone of an elaborate but ob- lique argument about denial and the "desire to suspend disbelief that can be designated by the term sodomy"-dwindles into two fleeting hints that Faustus might enjoy a female sex-partner as beautiful as Lucifer or Jupiter (pp. 1 12, 120-1). I read these chap- ters several times over in hope of finding the promised "content" or "substance" necessary if not sufficient for the argument; with- out it, this intricate account of "the representational logic of sod- omy" (pp. 113, 116, 118, 127) is simply incredible. SOCIAL PROBLEMS AND ALIEN ENCOUNTERS I group here a cluster of widely differing books that share an affinity with social history and a broad empirical base. The sub- jects include vagrancy, colonial expansion and travel, racial and ethnic otherness, censorship, and the defense of poetry.</page><page sequence="14">186 Recent Studies Linda Woodbridge gathers a prodigious amount of material in Vagrancy, Homelessness, and English Renaissance Literature, organizing it into large overlapping chapters on Thomas Harmon's Caveatfor Common Cursetors (origin of the coney-catching genre), on the "cultural work" of jest-books and Reformation satire, on the humanists, on nationhood and domesticity, on dirt, domes- ticity, and jest-books, and on the "radical" King Lear. Clearly moved by homelessness in contemporary America, Woodbridge scruti- nizes each text and each social movement for evidence of com- passion or callousness. At times she discovers meanings contrary to the author's intention, as when the "flinty-hearted" Harmon accidentally reveals an affinity with the eloquent impostures that he ascribes to all beggars, or reveals the pathos of a vagrant dy- ing for lack of "cherishing" (pp. 53, 59-60, 73). Nor is hostility to tramps always interpreted as a matter of individual sensibility: immobilizing punishments such as the stocks express a general anxiety about social mobility; negative representation shows the social process of "Othering," forging associations between place- less beggars and Native Americans (pp. 55-7, 189, and passim). Several generations of scholars (Tzvetan Todorov, Stephen Greenblatt, Jeffrey Knapp) have made the colonial encounter a central topic in Renaissance studies, and this tradition contin- ues in essay collections and monographs. Nine literature profes- sors with art expertise, including Ernest Gilman, contribute essays to Early Modern Visual Culture: Representation, Race, and Empire in Renaissance England, edited by Peter Erickson and Clark Hulse. Concentrating on India and what would later be called the Middle East, Ivo Kamps and Jyotsna Singh have put together an innova- tive mix of primary sources and critical essays, Travel Knowl- edge: European "Discoveries" in the Early Modern Period. More narrowly focused, a number of the contributors to Edmund Spenser: Essays on Culture and Allegory, edited by Jennifer Klein Morrison and Matthew Greenfield, explore the issue of colonial- ism. Schwarz's Amazon book inevitably touches on colonial ex- ploration and exoticism as well as sexuality, and to this extent complements Rebecca Ann Bach's Colonial Transformations: The Cultural Production of the New Atlantic World, 1580-1640. Cross- ing anachronistic divisions, Bach takes as her subject the inter- related discursive realms of Ireland, Bermuda, and Virginia, building up a fascinating picture of the multiplex "Atlantic world" in which England exerted a variety of improvised powers and articulated fear and curiosity as well as crude, racialized domi- nance. The relevance of Bermuda and Jamestown for The Tem-</page><page sequence="15">James Grantham Turner 187 pest, especially the shameful contrast of Algonkian civility and settler barbarity, is also brought out in B. J. Sokol's contribution to The Wit To Know, Eugene D. Hill and William Kerrigan's festschrift for Edward Tayler. Bach's chapters map out the range of her interests and docu- ments, some of which are scanned in microscopic detail: the in- troduction is really a full chapter on the early years of Jamestown and the fatal error of the English in lumping different native peoples together; chapter 1 sets Spenser in his Irish context and discovers analogies between Ireland and woman in Amoretti and in later Irish-language poems (misnamed "Gaelic"); chapter 2 stud- ies the names on early maps of Bermuda, which include a tiny uninhabited spit called "Ireland" (they wish); chapter 3 traces Atlantic allusions in Jonson's plays, ending with an ingenious reading of The New Inne as parodic colonial family; chapter 4 transcribes the tableaux of imperial wealth and dark-skinned people in Jonson's court masques and their merchant rivals, the Lord Mayor's pageants; chapter 5 expounds an episode in John White's Virginia when Powhatan women put on a dance or "masque" for him, comparing the different versions of the narra- tive and speculating about the meaning of this artifact from the performers' point of view, forever lost. At her best, Bach inter- prets the colonial encounter as a complex "transformation," per- ceptively teasing out the nuances of surviving texts to show the tentative and labile nature of English identity. But her hatred of "cultural genocide" sometimes pushes her into oversimplification or stretching of the text, for example ignoring the lines in Tho- mas Middleton's pageants that attribute racism to "Opinion's light- ness" or declare "I'me Beauteous in my Blacknesse" (pp. 158-9, another echo of the Song of Songs). The Spenser chapter is par- ticularly unconvincing, exaggerating the resemblance between the Irish situation and the cruel-then-submissive mistress of Amoretti then referring to the love poems as a "sonnet sequence to Ire- land" or which "constructed a feminized Ireland," self-righteously denouncing other critics for "failing" to explain them as colonial (pp. 61-2, 41). A similar argument is made by James Fleming in Spenser Studies: A Renaissance Poetry Annual, volume 15, but without collapsing the difference between congruence and iden- tity, heuristics and hermeneutics. The production, circulation, and control of literary texts are studied in Print, Manuscript, Performance: The Changing Relations of the Media in Early Modern England, with densely documented articles by luminaries including Leah Marcus, Joseph</page><page sequence="16">188 Recent Studies Loewenstein, Steven Mullaney, and the editors, Marotti and Michael D. Bristol. Textual theorists and editors working in new paradigms address Shakespearean and other issues, including hypertext, anthologies of women writers, and marginalia, in The Renaissance Text: Theory, Editing, Textuality, edited by Andrew Murphy. Richard Dutton's Licensing, Censorship, and Authorship in Early Modern England gathers several articles written since his 1991 book Mastering the Revels. Providing a reliable and timely corrective rather than a new paradigm, Dutton gives us microhistories of "analogical reading," of the fool as metatheatrical figure, and of play-licensing in the Laudian era, followed by stud- ies of Marlowe, Shakespeare, Jonson, Middleton, and Sir John Hayward. These chapters have some interest beyond specialized drama history, since they illuminate the different channels through which texts circulate: in 1632-33, for example, Sir Henry Herbert was simultaneously blamed for censoring The Magnetic Lady and for licensing Donne's Paradoxes (pp. 43-5). Dutton ex- plodes the myth that Marlowe's plays were perceived as express- ing his unorthodox personality and threatened with unusual censorship. And he makes a plausible case that Shakespeare approached authorship with aristocratic sprezzatura, circulating his long "unblotted" play scripts in manuscript among the elite. The courtliness of Elizabethan poetic aspirations, and their potential conflict with Protestant working "discipline," form the core of Robert Matz's Defending Literature in Early Modern En- gland: Renaissance Literary Theory in Social Context. In a sug- gestive but slim book (136 pages of text that Cambridge sells for $55), Matz pursues analogies between this social dichotomy and the Horatian formula for literary success: combine instruction and delight, the utile and the dulce. Rather than surveying the entire field, he creates breadth by selecting one educational trea- tise (Sir Thomas Elyot's Governour), one theoretical treatise (Sidney's Defence of Poetry), and one verse epic (Spenser's Faerie Queene), with an epilogue showing that literary studies are still defended by invoking both pleasure and labor. (Incidentally, a useful teaching paperback from an obscure press, Peter C. Herman's edition of Sir Philip Sidney's "An Apology for Poetry" and "Astrophil and Stella": Texts and Contexts, includes extracts from Sidney's letters and from various attacks and defenses of poetry, including Stephen Gosson, Puttenham, and serviceable translations of Juan Luis Vives, Joseph Justus Scaliger, and Theodore Beza.) The "literary theory" promised in the title turns out to mean Elyot's justification of Greek and Latin study in elite</page><page sequence="17">James Grantham Turner 189 education (with interesting asides on dance and costume). The chapter on Sidney (in relation to the Puritan Gosson) deals less with Sidney's theory per se than with his precarious attempt to synthesize "Protestant" virtues and courtly pleasures, less with the nature of poetry than with its effects-martial, noble, and idealizing he wishes, courtesan-like and effeminizing he fears. Analyzing the outsider Spenser as well as Sidney in his "golden world," Matz rightly emphasizes social mobility and the blurring of class boundaries, resisting the simple assignment of pleasure to the Court and profit to the middle class; both positions subsist within each subject, so that a moral quality such as Temperance becomes Spenser's figure for mediation in his own career and in society. Matz identifies some of the strains in this attempted syn- thesis: the Bower of Bliss looks too much like the Court, and Verdant resembles the old warrior aristocracy "spent" by the ef- fort of becoming fancy courtiers (pp. 94-9). He gathers good evi- dence for Spenser's view of poetry and its dangers-the "aboundance" of romance opens it to charges of idleness and va- grancy, and Acrasia suggests "the pleasure-giving poet in the not very profitable role of prostitute" (pp. 108, 1 16-7)-but I think he could have engaged more with the poetic texture itself: whatever Spenser says about Temperance is surely contradicted by the gorgeous redundancy of the writing. AESTHETICS AND ITS DISCONTENTS Matz may need social history as a framing device, but he does place the defense of poetry at the center of his study. The aes- thetic has taken a battering in the last few decades, marginalized as irrelevant or unmasked as a cover for sinister interests. But some books this year explore, if not "pure" aesthetics in the philo- sophical sense, then high culture, heroic genres of literature, comparisons among the sister arts, idealizing or formalizing modes of criticism consonant with the period's own intellectual aspira- tions. Several of these cite Sidney's vision of the arts and sci- ences "all directed to the highest end of the mistress knowledge, by the Greeks called architectonike" (though Sidney does go on to identify this with "the ethic and politic consideration"). Roy Eriksen's The Building in the Text: From Alberti to Shakespeare and Milton applies it directly to architecture and its kinship with literature (p. 15); Marc Berley's After the Heavenly Tune: English Poetry and the Aspiration to Song cites it to show the precarious and ambiguous place of music in the Renaissance scheme (p. 59).</page><page sequence="18">190 Recent Studies Eriksen's slim and learned book proposes two different mod- els of interrelation, one more logocentric than the other: in one, "architecture and literature share a common theoretical basis in rhetorical theory and practice" (p. 147), in the other the two dis- ciplines are autonomous but influence one another mutually. The dialectic model opens up an interesting survey of architectural metaphors for text building in Italian and English, including the word "plot" itself (chap. 1, with a notable discussion of 2 Henry IV I.iii.35-62), but the rhetorical model tends to shut the book down, at least on the level of practical criticism: the actual readings focus quite narrowly on figures of controlled repetition such as chiasmus, antithesis, and anaphora; spatial or "topomorphic" unities are established by counting lines and laying words out diagrammatically to show their symmetry around a central axis. The Milton section is especially unfortunate, since the quotes are badly mangled and talk of a precise "textual center" (pp. 139, 143) is artificial when applied to passages cut from the flow of blank verse, rather than formal stanze. Berley has the opposite problem: his thesis is fairly precise but his examples carry him off into the clouds. Surprisingly, he does not trace the relations between poetry and music-as explored in James Winn's Unsus- pected Eloquence (1981), a work not cited here-but the gulf be- tween what he calls "speculative music" (the music of the spheres and the attuned human soul) and actual music, punningly rel- egated to the inferior category of the "instrumental." (A different aspect of poetry-as-song is emphasized in Mary O'Reilly's essay for the Edward Tayler festschrift, "A New Song: Singing Space in Milton's Nativity Ode.") Berley gives us long, diffuse chapters on Shakespeare and Milton (before moving on to Romanticism and Modernism), identifying what is certainly a significant topos or subtheme, the sadness of realizing that heavenly harmony is still out of reach. Jessica's "I am never merry when I hear sweet mu- sic" (Merchant of Venice V.i.69) becomes the mantra of chapter 2, and Milton's "earthy grossness" the mantra of chapter 3, which argues that the "speculative music dilemma" becomes "the basis of his practical poetic" (p. 148). This claim could have been made stronger by paying more attention to heard melodies as well as unheard; Berley misses several opportunities to analyze Milton's poetic musicality (for a nice exception see pp. 192-3) and his engagement with actual music, particularly in the masque he made with Henry Lawes. Instead we get vague allusions to Shakespeare's "desire to sing with the angels" or Milton's "rich, musical lines" (pp. 88, 190).</page><page sequence="19">James Grantham Turner 191 Kenneth Borris's sober title, Allegory and Epic in English Re- naissance Literature: Heroic Form in Sidney, Spenser, and Milton, conceals a bold claim to overthrow traditional literary history: far from dwindling in the late Renaissance and seventeenth century as most scholars think, the genre of allegorical epic advances to a new height of sophistication and actually includes the old and new Arcadias and Paradise Lost (as well as those parts of The Faerie Queene where critics have seen allegory on the wane). Borris exemplifies the odd paradox, that intentionally allegorical poetry is studied less and less (except for Dante and Spenser) but crypto- allegoresis as a mode of interpretation has gained in prestige, particularly when it reveals textual self-reference. Rewriting ear- lier texts as allegory appeals for at least two reasons: it brings them up to date-think of the Ovide moralise, or Bacon's mod- ernizing reinterpretation of ancient mythology, or Paul de Man's allegories of reading-and it makes the whole of literature a great secret, offering infinite opportunities to insert your key. For the Renaissance scholar allegory also provides opportunities to show erudition. Though he does not explore the allegorical epic itself (his Fletcher is Angus not Giles or Phineas), Borris does a re- markable job of reconstructing those theorists who took it seri- ously in sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Europe; Homer and Ariosto were reinterpreted wholesale, Tasso allegorized himself, and lofty reasons were adduced for the inclusion of some allegory in the heroic poem. But none of the above can solve the question of whether a particular text actually is an allegory. For that there must be demonstrable internal "pointers" or "grounds," though Borris rightly points out that they run from "most obvious" to more recondite or "anamorphic" (pp. 1 18, 67). All too often I found him referring bluntly to "long allegorical texts such as The Faerie Queene or the Arcadias" (p. 67) or Sidney and Spenser as "both allegorical heroic poets" (p. 116), and speaking of episodes as "the allegory" (pp. 177, 120, 123, 124), without sufficient evi- dence to justify this relabeling; in every case, his clues show not identity but circumstantial similarity, common tropes and thematics-such generic concerns as moral heroism, conflicting passions, and tyranny that the Arcadias share, unsurprisingly, with Spenser's epic. The whole of Paradise Lost is made to allego- rize the invisible church of believers and its mystic union with Christ-the same technique used to canonize the Song of Songs. Starting with the founding moment when God promotes the Son (PLV.603-1 1), Borris argues that since the episode has no Scrip- tural foundation it must be allegorical, pointing analogically to a</page><page sequence="20">192 Recent Studies great truth but in itself "neither 'true' nor 'untrue"' (pp. 191-7). Meanwhile identifiable allegories such as Sin and Death-stan- dard accessories of the epic such as Virgil's Fama or Pope's Spleen-are downgraded to mere travesties, "relatively simplistic and limited" (p. 191). Borris makes many good critical points about the sustained interrelation of motifs in these long narra- tives; the monographic compulsion then forces them into a uni- fied but unconvincing thesis. In contrast to books where the premise is appealing but the execution disappointing, one of my favorites is a book whose premise even the author is tempted to call "delusional" (p. 10). Dennis Kezar's Guilty Creatures: Renaissance Poetry and the Eth- ics of Authorship begins by citing Sidney's architectonike passage to show how central is the idea that poetry does things to people- improves them in theory, kills them in Ireland, corrupts them in the view of Gosson and other enemies. Perhaps works whose char- acters get killed actually inflict harm on the reader, so that in a double sense they are "killing poems" (Kezar's original title)? What he intends, of course, is a thought-experimental tweaking of the veil that separates fact and fiction, in company with Ludwig Wittgenstein (p. 11) and Hamlet (invoked on every page by bril- liant quotation). The dangers of literature, also explored this year in Shirley Sharon-Zisser's Lacanian study The Risks of Simile in Renaissance Rhetoric, can easily be overstated. Representation can indeed do harm-especially when it constitutes incitement to riot, charivari, legal evidence, or a forged document such as Hamlet's letter sending Rosencrantz and Guildenstern to their deaths (p. 13)-but this depends on a specific context; fiction, drama, and poetry have clearly been transferred to a less conse- quential context, if not entirely innocent. Kezar has found a few actual fatalities (defendants who die in prison while their witch trial is playing in the theater and biasing the jury), but he keeps them in an endnote (p. 237 n. 2); when he first brings in a much- needed law document, the cause is not defamation or homicide but the theft of recycled timber to build the new Globe (p. 96). For the most part he concentrates on subtler kinds of guilt, though he does allow himself the odd rhetorical generalization such as "the representation of a violence that itself reflects upon the vio- lence of representation" (p. 6). I suspect we will be hearing less on this theme in the coming years. Guilty Creatures is a centrifugal mass of separate studies, metadramatic and sometimes melodramatic, related to death but not necessarily to killing on a tragic scale. The brightest moment</page><page sequence="21">James Grantham Turner 193 of violence in chapter 1-when the sparrow in Jane Scrope's tap- estry comes to life and begs her not to stab him with her needle (pp. 27-8)-is also the most miniaturized, and John Skelton's goliardic verse further distances any sense of real damage. Briefly summarized, Kezar's chapters might sound like a parodic recipe for New Historicism: find blazons in Skelton and Spenser and equate them with dismemberment, burglary, and cannibalism (chaps. 1-2); select the most gruesome episode in Julius Caesar as the paradigm of theater in general (chap. 3); put the drama on trial for "witch-mongering" even when it presents witches sym- pathetically (chap. 4). After this comes a thorough parallel be- tween Samson Agonistes and the ars moriendi (linked to each other and the previous chapters by somewhat tenuous theatrical elements), then what feels like a chapter of off-cuts on Henry V, Milton's "Passion," and the notorious "Funeral Elegy" by W[?illiam] S[?hakespeare]. But summary does not do justice to the critical intelligence and allusive wit that shines in the local readings, the unexpected and refreshing juxtapositions (Donne's FYrstAnniver- sary as a gateway to Spenser), and the intriguing speculations on theater. Maybe the lynching of Cinna the poet does "bestow an Exton on the world to make many Extons" (p. 109, an unac- knowledged but apposite echo of Richard n and of Sidney's most idealistic claim for poesie). Maybe it does "inaugurate Shakespeare's Globe by at once celebrating and censuring his audience's dangerously constitutive power" (p. 169), making it the monster that Gosson feared (p. 102) rather than the cau- tiously controlled revels that Richard Dutton documents. THE RETURN OF THE METAPHYSICALS At moments in this read-through I felt transported to my undergraduate days, when T. S. Eliot still lived and the "Metaphysicals" fought with Milton for top place in the canon. Syracuse has reprinted George Williamson's SLx Metaphysical Poets: A Reader's Guide from 1967, and Oxford has published Robert Ellrodt's Seven Metaphysical Poets: A Structural Study of the Unchanging Self; distilled from a doctoral thesis filed in 1960- and fundamentally unchanged despite the theorists who come and go in the footnotes. Ellrodt insists that an objective mental "structure" can be found in these individual poets' text and self, translating structuralism to the isolated individual of Freudian psychoanalysis (though only "the most imaginative and boldest" minds [p. 20] exhibit this pattern). A towering figure in the French</page><page sequence="22">194 Recent Studies university-to call him a doyen is an understatement-Ellrodt reiterates the "unchanging mind" in the book's very structure: Donne, Marvell, Henry Vaughan, Richard Crashaw, Thomas Traherne, and George Herbert (with Edward, Lord Herbert of Cherbury half-admitted as the exception that proves the rule) appear repeatedly in different permutations, under the four ru- brics "Modes of Self-Awareness," "Time, Space, and World," "Re- ligiosity and Thought," and "Historical Landmarks." Ellrodt's book is a monumental assemblage of the minute and the vast, the closely observed clusters of imagery that allegedly constitute the unique trace of each poet, and the grand intellectual history that proves beside the point since these "structures" do not derive from exterior discursive or social forces. One can appreciate his vivid reconstructions of a poet's sensibility-of Donne's fascina- tion with body-soul interchange, or Marvell's flattening of space and time, or Herbert's love of wood-without accepting his strained arguments for their absolute, invariant distinctiveness. Donne features in Peter DeSa Wiggins's Donne, Castiglione, and the Poetry of Courtliness, but he is no longer the poet beloved of Ellrodt and Eliot, the metaphysical who, like John Webster, saw the skull beneath the skin; though Wiggins aims to rescue Donne from New Historicist accusations of creepy, self-serving courtliness (introduction) he still treats him largely as a social creature and the poems as courtly performances or instruments in his career. (The Satires for example are read rather too auto- biographically, given that Wiggins castigates others for extract- ing biography from the poetry.) This social emphasis is partly explained by the book's thesis-that certain "codes" or "moves" uniquely embodied in II cortegiano are "enacted" (p. 10) in all of Donne's writing. In some passages deriving from his earlier ar- ticles Wiggins invokes different comparands, such as Tibullus or Tintoretto (pp. 95-6, an idea derived from Ellrodt), but Baldassare Castiglione remains the key. I admire Wiggins's lyrical intelligence and his grasp of the Italian Renaissance (especially Lodovico Ariosto), but sometimes I found it hard to see the connections. The four master codes themselves-tolerating dissonance and impasse, valuing provocative play over solemn lectures, conceal- ing limitations by sprezzatura, establishing sincerity by conscious dissimulation-seem pertinent but very general, and the resem- blance to Donne often oblique. Castiglione arranges his speakers alternately to provoke and play off each other, and Donne's Songs and Sonnets speaks in various voices and personae that imply dramatic conversation (pp. 60-4), but the same is true of many</page><page sequence="23">James Grantham Turner 195 dialogues and verse-collections, surely. The lesson of sprezzatura is to point toward transcendence, and the lesson of "The Canoni- zation" is to value not worldly wealth but "those who lent rich materials an unexpected shape, who left in the form of a 'well wrought urne' or a sonnet-or, as Castiglione would have it, in the memory of evenings in Urbino-a presentiment of the infinite contained in a narrow space where eternity palpitates as often as we direct our attention there" (p. 101). This is so beautiful that I wish I knew what it meant. R. V. Young's Doctrine and Devotion in Seventeenth-Century Poetry: Studies in Donne, Herbert, Crashaw, and Vaughan belongs to the genre we might call documentary revisionist, shaped by the desire to destroy a widespread oversimplification. Young does battle on two (or three) fronts, against the "Protestant Poetics" school and against what he sees as the morbid gibberish of postmodernism and New Historicism. In a mingled tone of exas- peration and devotion, he explains the true meaning of doctrines and practices diffused throughout Christendom; there are no chapters, but each poet is studied under each of three rubrics that make the book's parts: on Grace, on Sacrament, and on Biblical Poetics. As in Ellrodt's section on religion, the local read- ings are sympathetic but the cumulative effect is oppressive as well as impressive: over and over, we hear that x claims this poem as uniquely Protestant but a similar image can be found in this poem by Francisco Quevedo (or, this doctrine can be found in Thomas Aquinas or the decretals of Trent). For me, this long and knowledgeable book will serve as a quarry of Spanish devotional poetry, much of it dazzling, and as a corrective to Anglo generali- zations. But I regret the occasional slippage between literary criti- cism and religious proselytizing. "The reason" for the emotional intensity of Herbert's "The Flower"-when after a long winter "I once more smell the dew and rain, / And relish versing"-is "that it is faithful to the reality of the human situation ... in its fallen state"; if Jonathan Goldberg finds only "repetitive motion" and "undoing" in The Temple, this is what happens when "there is no divine grace, no sacramental quality transforming our lives and works" (pp. 51, 53, my emphasis). Herbert, Crashaw and their influence are also studied in Paul Parrish's contribution to the Summers-Pebworth volume Liter- ary Circles and Cultural Communities in Renaissance England. Douglas Trevor couples Herbert with Jacques Lacan in Histori- cism, Psychoanalysis, and Early Modern Culture, edited by Carla Mazzio and Trevor, and William H. Moore gives personal testi-</page><page sequence="24">196 Recent Studies mony of his enthusiasm for Herbert in Sermons_from Literature: A Reader/Teacher's Experiences; other sermons explore the plea- sures of Midsummer Night's Dream and Michael Drayton's Poly- Olbion. And a chapter on The Temple forms the literary peak of Ramie Targoffs Common Prayer: 7he Language of Public Devotion in Early Modern England. In contrast to Donne, who testifies in his sermons to the delicious inspiration of collective worship but whose devotional verse remains obstinately private, Herbert strives to combine the intensity of solitary devotion and the "comforting order" that Anglicans from TFyndale to Richard Hooker recom- mended in liturgical church services (pp. 53, 92-4, 102). Targoffs opening chapters map out, concisely and lucidly, the controversies over the Book of Common Prayer and compul- sory church attendance, with particular focus on the "devotional effectiveness" (p. 51) of collective versus private worship (repre- sented on page 1 by the sinister figure of Shakespeare's Claudius); polemics often played on the contrast between good group feeling and anxious, slovenly, solitary improvisation. Chapter 3 links this "pragmatic" (p. 55) discussion to Herbert by tracing the his- tory of "Prayer and Poetry," from fifteenth-century doggerel and the lame Thomas Sternhold-John Hopkins Psalm Book to the Philip Sidney-countess of Pembroke metrical psalms, which made poetic skill an expression of godliness rather than worldliness and allowed devotional verse to flourish in England. (Continental sources are barely mentioned in this Anglicanocentric study, though Louis Martz is briefly criticized for initiating the private/ public separation that Targoff is trying to counter [p. 86].) The Sidneys allegedly create an "accessible and melodic" mode (in contrast to the convoluted and "personal" Sir Thomas Wyatt), and find a poetic equivalent for "principles that shaped the es- tablished liturgy: the use of a paradigmatic or representative speaker; the non-specificity, and hence reiterability of the text; the commitment to formalized language as the ideal medium for communicating one's prayers" (pp. 78-9). Herbert then achieves "the poetic fulfilment of common prayer" (pp. 102-3), in poems such as 'The Collar" (returning to Sternhold-Hopkins common meter after wild prosodic ramblings), 'Trinitie Sunday" (simple enough to serve as a general confession but intricately crafted in triads), "Lent" (a versified sermon), the perennial favorite "The Flower" (using the alternation of I and we first noticed in revi- sions of the Prayer Book [pp. 29, 351), and "The Fore-runners" (about the joy of sharing poetic language with the whole congre- gation). Though Targoff modestly declines an "exhaustive" read-</page><page sequence="25">James Grantham Turner 197 ing of The Temple-for which there would have been room, given that hers is among the shortest monographs of the year-she does observe that its typography resembles that of an actual prayer book (pp. 100, 111-7). The Anglo-American Bay Psalm Book pro- vides the anticlimactic conclusion, treated as a social but not a literary phenomenon since no line of its verse is quoted. THE LITERATURE OF RELIGIOUS CONFLICT Researchers like Targoff who study religion on its own terms now enjoy an increasing number of resources. The Angel of Ref- ormation stirred up many different issues involving the language and the mise en scene of worship: Latin or vernacular? a liturgy entirely set, entirely improvised, or a mixture of the two? small group meetings or parish worship? (Relations between priest and congregation, and the extent to which the individual is modified in the group by imitation or collective sentiment, are explored in Targoff s introduction and chapters 1-2.) The founders of the English liturgy were constantly embroiled in controversy and acutely aware of the literary dimension; Thomas Cranmer for example, creator of the seductive prose of the Prayer Book, rec- ognized that "mine English verses lack the grace and facility that I would wish they had" (quoted in Targoff, p. 57). New publica- tions this year help to follow these issues. A major Tyndale biog- raphy (Daniell's) has been reissued in paperback, and Tyndale's own monumental Answer unto Sir Thomas More's Dialogue has been edited by Anne M. O'Donnell and Jared Wicks. David Norton has condensed from his two-volume study of 1993 A History of the English Bible as Literature-an idea that would have filled these godly authors with horror, as Norton himself points out (pp. 1-2). I am tempted to explain the virulence of religious conflict as follows: each position in the Wars of Religion was so contradic- tory that the various camps needed to fight one another to keep their own party together. (For the vituperation that ran through- out the culture, see Subversion and Scurrility: Popular Discourse in Europefrom 1500 to the Present, edited by Dermot Cavanagh and Tim Kirk.) Those most devoted to spontaneous worship also insist most rigidly on the invariable word of Scripture. Those who support external conformity claim it as the best inducer of soul searching and interiority. Those who most hate the image, the theater, and the imagination generate the most dramatic and vi- sionary rhetoric. Donne preaches submission to liturgical forms</page><page sequence="26">198 Recent Studies in fantastic sermons that melt the boundaries of the form, and writes an idiosyncratic verse litany that begs to be delivered from "poeticness"; Charles I recites Pamela's prayer from Sidney's Arcadia in his hour of need, and Oliver Cromwell's regime hires the fanciest poet to denounce him. Kristen Poole's Radical Religion from Shakespeare to Milton: Figures of Nonconformity in Early Modern England appears to ad- dress this controversial history, but in fact this title misleads us. Puritan Carnival would do better, since Poole concentrates on the caricature, with special focus on the gluttony, lechery, and glos- solalia that enemies perceive beneath the austere Malvolio-like exterior. This composite picture of "the deformation of reforma- tion" explores, and exemplifies, "literary anatomies of the puri- tan body" (p. 7). Because attacks on puritanism stress its shapeless monstrosity and the chaos it brings to society, Poole stretches the term to mean "the mutable, the indeterminable, the unlocatable" (p. 4). Add to that her emphasis on Bakhtinian- Rabelaisian excess rather than Lenten asceticism, and we arrive at her wildest speculation: everybody notices that Falstaff occa- sionally parodies the godly dialect, but Poole argues that he ac- tually is a stage Puritan (chap. 1), citing parallels in the knockabout language of the Martin Marprelate tracts. Other chap- ters are more likely to win consent, neatly matching one particu- lar manifestation of puritanism with one specific text: the gluttonous "Bellygod" with Bartholomew Fair, the orgiastic Fam- ily of Love with Middleton's comedy of that name; the swarming proliferation of sects with Thomas Edwards's Gangraena; the mon- strous genealogy of episcopacy with Milton's early tracts; "Adamite" nudism with Paradise Lost. Poole shows everywhere her deep read- ing in English pamphlets (if not in Continental sources), her in- genious wit, and her willingness to pursue stimulating but tangential analogies-for example between food and scripture (both "sloshing around" inside the inspired body [p. 65]), or be- tween naked truth, unclad bodies, and Adamic purity of language. David Loewenstein takes a diametrically opposite approach in Representing Revolution in Milton and His Contemporaries: Re- ligion, Politics, and Polemics in Radical Puritanism (a relative bar- gain, for Cambridge, at $60 for 295 pages of text plus 87 pages of painstakingly researched notes). Loewenstein immerses himself deeply in his chosen authors and expounds their writing from within. Part 1 offers detailed readings of John Lilburne, Gerrard Winstanley, Albiezer Coppe, Anna Trapnel (at least The Cry of a Stone), and George Fox, with Marvell adding a more "artful" and</page><page sequence="27">James Grantham Turner 199 "elegant" voice (p. 166); part 2 concentrates on Milton, recon- structing his shifting use of "rebellion" and revisiting the old ques- tion of radical religion and politics in the late poems. Throughout each chapter cross-references and comparisons link these au- thors into a network. More literary than Christopher Hill's World Turned Upside Down (1972), more judicious than Michael Wilding's Dragon's Teeth (1987), more lucid than Nigel Smith's Literature and Revolution in England (1994), this book should be consulted by anyone who wants to go deeper into these "Voices of the War" than the current selection in the Norton Anthology of English Literature. Loewenstein has the tendency to persuade by accumulation, and the reader will need to adjust to the abun- dant quotation and the exuberant repetition of adjectives like "fiery," "potent," "dramatic," "visionary," and "radical." This de- scriptive-evaluative vocabulary operates in both a strong and a weak sense; "dramatic," for example, may just mean "vivid" or it may denote the theatrical dissimulation that so many of these writers denounce in the Cromwellian establishment. It could be argued that Loewenstein uses "revolution" and "revolutionary" too readily as blanket terms, since the point is to establish pre- cisely what such concepts meant-and how divided their signifi- cation at the time. But he certainly identifies (and exemplifies) the activism of the period, challenging the idea that writing pas- sively reflects historical change or shores up traditional power; he studies, and conveys, the excitement of that moment when "the old World [ran] up like parchment in the fire" (Winstanley, quoted p. 1). He argues for the literary quality of these tracts as well as their historical importance, with particular emphasis on their apocalyptic vehemence and their "creative" or "mythopoeic" use of threatening imagery from the prophets and Revelation. These agitators learned to curse from the Bible rather than Prospero, and Loewenstein does an extraordinary job of identifying the exact source of their quotes and the exact target of their imprecations. MILTON AGONISTES, SAMSON HUBRISTES In the case of Milton, the "radical" is harder to pin down. After decades of assault on the very idea of the author, Milton survives undead, endowed with uncanny powers of consistency and survival; devotees merge their identities with his, in the pro- cess homogenizing his moral and political positions and their relation to his poetics. Milton certainly included eloquent denun- ciation among his vocal passions, and at times aligned it with</page><page sequence="28">200 Recent Studies radical reform: the Lady's threat to unleash "sacred vehemence" gives Comus cold sweats; the dread voice of Spenser-style reli- gious polemic that "shrunk the streams" of pastoral in Lycidas was retrospectively defined as prophecy in 1645. And Paradise Lost continues to fire broadsides against hypocrisy and corrup- tion-as Loewenstein shows in his seventh chapter and as John N. King shows in Milton and Religious Controversy: Satire and Polemic in "Paradise Lost." The radicalism of the earlier poems is the subject of a long debate that now includes Lewalski's chapter on the period 1632- 38; though she sensibly plays down other attempts to base myths of personal development on scant evidence, I feel she still over- states the case for the consistently "reformed" character of the early writings and the anti-Court aesthetics of the aristocratic entertainments (Life of John Milton, pp. 59, 63, 73-4, 76-80). Loewenstein steers clear of this trap, but commits himself to the "radical" later Milton, from the "chilling" attack on the Irish re- bellion (p. 192) throughout Paradise Lost, Paradise Regained, and Samson Agonistes. I remain in awe of Loewenstein's knowledge of the period and its polemics, but skeptical of the label "radical Protestant poem" that he attaches to these works from the outset of each chapter. Milton may have agreed with his two Quaker friends on two major points-no tithes, no state control of reli- gion provided it is Protestant-but otherwise he has little in com- mon with the antihierarchical and anti-intellectual rantings of Coppe and Fox (compare pp. 11-2). In the terms that Loewenstein has hammered out in part 1, Milton's praise of Cromwell and his detestation of the unlettered, backsliding vulgus-fiercely reiter- ated by Jesus himself in Paradise Regained-make him "conser- vative" rather than "radical." Loewenstein rightly rejects one-on-one political readings of the epic-except in the indubi- table case of "seditious" Abdiel-and shows instead how Satan simulates every position on the spectrum including radicalism, making himself one of those monsters of equivocation that Milton invents so well. King makes an equally detailed case for the role of "satire, invective, divine laughter, and parody" in Paradise Lost, though he refrains from claiming universal significance for this component. King sets out his materials judiciously (except for the unfortunate choice of bold type for emphasis), proving that Milton's "defamatory innuendo" generally aims at broad targets like Islam or the Roman Church ("conclaves" in Hell, "transsubstantiation" in Eden, Gunpowder Plot in Heaven); simi- larly, the "sermonic" closing books (and perhaps the less polemic</page><page sequence="29">James Grantham Turner 201 Paradise Regainecd encourage a broad antiformalist or dissent- ing piety, compatible with Quaker "radical inwardness" but not identifiable with any sect (pp. 12-3, 167-9, 189-90). Samson Agonistes is the most treacherous work for critics who aspire to fashion Milton in their own image. (Efforts this year include numerous chapters and two complete books on this play alone, Derek N. C. Wood's "Exiled from Light": Divine Law, Morality, and Violence in Milton's "Samnson Agonistes" and John T. Shawcross's The Uncertain World of "Samson Agonistes. ') Un- like Paradise Regained, its date is indeterminable, its dramatic form suppresses the authorial voice (especially since Milton chooses not to use the supernatural messenger he relied on else- where), and its protagonist is so ambiguous that he is cited to support every conceivable position from wondrous regeneration to evil brutality. In Milton's writings alone, Samson signifies the splendor of constitutional royalism, the hideousness of married sex, the shame of the Fall, and (most importantly) the great flaw of the Greek warrior-hero, hubris or over-reaching. The passage in the Trinity MS where Milton sketched play titles including Samson Hubristes provides the starting point for Sharon Achinstein's essay in the Blackwell Companion to Milton, edited by Thomas N. Corns (another huge and impressive reference work that will be useful for decades); but Achinstein's translation "Samson the Violent" (p. 411) obscures the real interest of the illiterate strongman for Milton-the prospect of seamlessly wed- ding Greek ethos and Old Testament mythos. Criticism of Samson still revolves around two questions, whether he can be interpreted as a hero, and whether he can be interpreted at all. In the week that I wrote this, religious zealots committed violent suicide to bring down twin uprights and crush thousands of the enemy to death; even before this, however, lib- erals and anachronists have found it obscene to admire "heaps of slaughter" and the God who requires them. Loewenstein rec- ognizes how "dreadful" the conclusion is, but admits no doubt that the Spirit actually moves Samson, that the catastrophe matches the radical ideal of divine vengeance, and that Milton's dramatization is compatible with justification (p. 288). Dennis Kezar follows the lead of Stanley Fish, who argued in two articles from 1969 and 1989 that Samson is radically unknowable, and that the regenerationist school simply reiterates the futile attempt of the Chorus and Manoa to impose a narrative that makes his life and death coherent, compatible with what they guess to be God's will (Guilty Creatures, pp. 141-2, 147, 151, 159). Kezar</page><page sequence="30">202 Recent Studies amusingly calls the opposing critical schools two "semichoruses" (p. 141), locking them more firmly into the limited perspective of the supporting cast, but then provides an alternative model for comparison or "intercalation" (p. 163)-the ars moriendi or con- duct book that teaches how to die well in public, somehow linked to Milton's critique of Charles I's version of this genre, Eikon Basilike. Some striking parallels show that the pain of desertion, and the temptation to "murmur" against God, were considered the common lot of Everyman rather than a perquisite of the suf- fering radical. Yet Kezar is open to the obvious objection that Samson does not plan his death, but goes from morbid despair to a willingness to "go along" to an unknown event (an existential acte gratuit that for Fish releases him from the prison of interpretation). The two books on Samson take a less "aloof' position. Shawcross gathers together a lifetime's experience of this text. The copy of Milton I used in my freshman year-a priceless docu- ment scribbled over with such comments as "platitude" or "Sa- tanic possession"-was edited by Shawcross, and placed Samson firmly among the earlier poems, ca. 1647; now he prefers a gen- tler approach to determinacy, pointing out that each dating yields different meanings and that no interpretative issue can be de- cided conclusively. The effect is rather like a quilt, with passages on bibliographical minutiae side-by-side with the great issues of character and theodicy, all subject to the same questioning of fixed positions. (Even Fish is blamed as "too pessimistic" [p. 64].) Wood offers less comfort to the indeterminate, reminding us of two fundamental points that might seem obvious but which are still forgotten all too often: Samson is an Old Testament figure, bracketed in Hebrews 11 as a hero of faith who received not the promise, ignorant of such Christian values as charity; Samson Agonistes is a mimetic drama and not an autobiography or tract. Wood provides a good corrective, then, but I found his method somewhat relentless. Ass after ass falls to the jawbone of the scholar: the darkness of the Law is exaggerated by quote upon quote; the excesses of the regenerationist camp are dragged out for derision; the errors of Joseph Wittreich are rubbed in, and misinterpretations of Aristotle's Poetics trounced. Wood imposes on others an absolute separation between early and late Milton, before and after the 1660 "experience of defeat" (p. 188), rein- forcing the fiction that the play was entirely a product of the latest period; yet the pre-Restoration Of Civil Power is presented as the perfect gloss on Samson (p. 91), while Of Reformation and Areopagitica are cited to show what Milton means by "all passion spent" (p. 58).</page><page sequence="31">James Grantham Turner 203 The Stanley Fish articles that influenced Kezar have now re- appeared, with eight other published essays (lightly revised), five new chapters, introduction, and epilogue, in How Milton Works (a well-priced, handsome book accompanied by a nineteen-page press release about the author's administrative triumphs). Cheer- fully admitting that he has changed his mind little in over twenty- five years (p. vii), Fish demonstrates an Ellrodtesque firmness of purpose in both the poet and the critic, a "structure" common to both "consciousness" and writing (p. 7). The old and the new pieces-an abundant cornucopia of ingenious observations-are arranged to tell a story of fixed faith and austere contempt for observation, ingenuity, and abundance. New chapter-titles label Action, Speech, Plot, Understanding, Intelligibility, History, and Politics as successive 'Temptations." Even though he recognizes some profound transformations and re-evaluations in Milton's career (particularly around the explosive moment of Areopagitica), Fish privileges the unchanging; his paradigm figures are the un- moved Lady in the masque and the unmoved Jesus in Paradtise Regained. The resolute Miltonic hero(ine), Fish declares with equal resolution, cleaves to the inner light and adopts a fideism so ex- treme that "Faith in the evidence of things unseen" is reversed to mean rejection of the exterior, sensory, contingent, plot-driven world: if it can be seen, it must be an obstacle to faith-and inter- pretation must be ceaselessly provoked and frustrated to dem- onstrate just this aporia. The opening portrait of the Lady whose "inward affirmation generates the visible evidence that can then be cited as its support" (p. 26), and the closing insistence that "truths must be embraced against the available evidence, and that embrace is warranted only by its own self-sustaining strength" (p. 559), equally endorse the theorist maintaining his faith that meaning does not inhere in the text but is generated by preexis- tent interpretative strategies. But surely Fish's brilliant exposition of the Chorus's efforts to impose a narrative shape on Samson, to stuff him and put him in "a Samson theme park" (p. 441), applies to all attempts at creating a heroically consistent Milton, his own included? To counter this objection he generates yet more chapters-going even deeper into the details of the verse to show how it obliterates sensuous particularity, cancels "plot-thinking," and proves yet again that "answers antecedently derived and tenaciously adhered to give us the visible world" (pp. 477, 483). Yet I can detect some changes in Fish's sensibility. The "tenacity" remains but the ap- proach is more poetic, more open to psychic speculation, more</page><page sequence="32">204 Recent Studies aware of gender and affect. This mellowing effect is particularly apparent in the two Comus chapters (3-4). The more recent one brings in much that had been sidelined by the tough forensic argufying of chapter 3 (published in 1975): the role of Sabrina, the music, the scenery, the dance, the resonance of myth. Fish still argues for absolute interiority but by different means, by an almost mystic evocation of "unblemished form," vision without difference, figures who are their own ground, a Yeatsian merging of the dancers and the dance. In other Milton news, Jameela Lares gathers some impres- sive evidence for the rhetorical training of preachers and the "of- fice of a pulpit" in Milton and the Preaching Arts, though sometimes she seems to underestimate the reader by explaining the basic facts of Protestant ecclesiology. Following the famous draft letter to "a friend"-where Milton acts out a most un-Fish-like irresolu- tion and envisions himself "preaching and not preaching" at once- Lares makes a case for taking Milton's call to the ministry seriously as a model of his poetic career, even after he declared himself "church-outed by the prelates" (quoted p. 28). Matthew Jordan's Milton and Modernity: Politics, Masculinity, and "Paradise Lost" addresses some familiar issues-Milton's relation to liberal hu- manism, the meritocracy of Heaven, paradisal marriage and sexual relations, the politics of landscape and labor in the garden of Eden-in a sharp new teleological perspective dominated by Habermasian modernity and Lacanian subjectivity; Milton is paired with John Locke as an almost likable bourgeois revolu- tionary, the inventor of self-esteem (p. 2) and the poet of a kind of domestic life compatible with the public sphere. Paradise Lost emerges in Jordan's interesting book as "a glorious and expan- sive achievement, widening horizons and bursting through con- strictions," while at the same time constituting "a repository of myths whose potency must be deconstructed" (p. 158): for Jor- dan the poem questions rather than reinforces the link between unitary reason, masculinity, and Fishian hyper-individuality ("over-committed to separateness and hence prone to construe relation as a fearful fusion"). Anne-Julia Zwierlein's massive Majestick Milton: British Imperial Expansion and Transformations of "Paradise Lost," 1667-1837 carries us far beyond the scope of this essay, but it should be a useful resource for future studies and it does relate its main themes to what Milton knew and did, as well as to what became of his writings later. Zwierlein touches upon Milton's reaction to Luis de Camoens's epic of Indian con- quest (pp. 107-9) and his sense of English backwardness, find-</page><page sequence="33">James Grantham Turner 205 ing the History of Britain (for example) "alive with the anxiety of a former colony" (p. 140). The most far-reaching Milton book this year may be Victoria Silver's Imperfect Sense: 7he Predicament of Milton's Irony. Silver does not begin with the most patent examples of irony in Para- dise Lost-when God amuses the Son by pretending to be scared by Satan's war preparation, or when he tests Adam by pretend- ing to rebuke his desire for a human mate-and then move on to more general instances; instead, she establishes a universal irony that pervades and "structures the whole poem" (p. 195), which is nothing less than the unbreachable gulf between a "hidden" de- ity and human attempts to make sense of it, including those pas- sages in Milton's Heaven that many readers have found repulsive or incompetent. (She knows the critics inside out, and debates constantly with all those from Samuel Johnson to William Empson and beyond who blame Milton for making God disagreeable.) Contrary to the expectations set up by book- and chapter-titles, God is everywhere present but Milton goes absconditus for many pages together, as Silver pursues the vast issues of "human be- ing" and "human meaning" in Wittgenstein, Martin Luther, Jeremiah, Theodor Adorno, St. Paul, Jean Calvin, and a host of other philosophers and theologians who have commented on Wittgenstein et al. Nothing seems left out, so that every sentence bursts with ideas that themselves burst the idea of a disciplined, linear book; only about page 177 do we begin to focus extensively on the Miltonic voice, as Silver turns to the sonnets and their relation to the epic proems. Silver takes Fish's method (apparent lapses reinterpreted as traps deliberately set by the author) and applies it ad infinitumn The key that releases these traps is irony, which pours out of any disjunction between planes of reality, any relation based on the supposition of direct or unmediated correspondence (not just vis- ible/invisible, but law/gospel, body/soul, sign/signifier). Every character who believes in such correspondences must be pain- fully mistaken, and this includes not only Satan (a convincing recruit to Silver's theory) but Adam, Eve, and above all the narra- tor, interpreted as "a picture of religious error" (p. 203), a de- luded fictional character seeking balm in a foolishly literal belief for the wounds the world has inflicted on him. Furthermore, irony for Silver merges with that much abused term "allegory" (even though "frenzied allegorizing" is a mark of Satanic thought on p. 250), so that the list of dupes includes all those in the heavenly host or the critical establishment who (unlike Silver and Borris)</page><page sequence="34">206 Recent Studies fail to grasp that the elevation of the Son is itself an allegory, or that Sin and Death are introduced to demonstrate that Hell is just as allegorical and that the Father is "no less an imperson- ation," certainly not to be mistaken for Milton's God (p. 211). Silver has a profound grasp of the theological and ontological difficulties of "justifying the ways of God," and garners an im- pressive range of passages from Milton's prose discussions of accommodation and exegesis. But these passages are forced to yield the astonishing conclusion that "Milton refuses to see scrip- tural anthropomorphism as even remotely analogous to the di- vine nature" (p. 236, my emphasis). Deeply perceptive local readings of Satan and Adam are embedded in a tortured and fantastic argument. Vast generalizations smother me in a collec- tive "we" that I strongly reject: "we" are not religious, nor do "we respond to Paradise Lost not as we would to art or fiction ... but as though we were in the presence of a philosophical proposi- tion-a truth claim" (pp. 5, 6). This is a book of great intelligence and erudition that nevertheless exemplifies the problems of monographia, the fatal lure of the all-explaining, universalizing thesis. The codex, the thesis, and the syllogism are great inventions that hold up well in an electronic age. Computers can replace hard copy at the peripheries of literary scholarship, for concor- dances, indices, and other "information," forjournalistic reviews, and (at the other end of the scale) for editions of very large corpuses such as annotated novels or literary correspondence. But the form of the printed monograph still brings satisfactions unavailable elsewhere: the physical feel in the hand, the evidence of inven- tion sustained at length, the wit of titles and epigraphs, the con- tinuity and cross-linkage of chapters, the bristling erudition of the notes. (Ironically, these very qualities make books difficult to review in brief, and I know from personal experience how galling it can be to have so many years of work unfairly crushed.) The madnesses necessary to produce a book become virtues once it has been published. In today's academy, however, these virtues- endurance, consistency, and empirical trustworthiness-are somewhat undervalued, or at least must be reconciled with an even more insistent and destabilizing demand: we are all encour- aged, even required, to be brilliant. A fair number of this year's books combine judiciousness and tenacity with sustained research into lesser-known bodies of knowledge, and I will often consult them on the shelves of the library to which I donate them. A fair number of them explode</page><page sequence="35">James Grantham Turner 207 with flashes of insight that I will remember for a long time. For now, it seems difficult to manage both kinds of achievement at once. Sustaining an original and exciting argument from cover to cover often means sacrificing the logical ground-rules of argu- ment itself. A valid theoretical critique of empiricism has been distorted into indifference or hostility to empirical verification per se. The body of read material is racked to yield impossibly high returns on the investment of time and concentration. Unbending faith in the universal validity of one's original premise converts perceptive local observations into untenable generalizations, and inflates ingenious but remote analogies into proof of identity. We would all do well to remember, when conceiving our own future projects and advising others, that brilliance can derive by refrac- tion from a diamond, the element of greatest lucidity, or by re- flection from a shiny opaque surface, a sequin.</page></plain_text>
