Stone House Stories is a collection of anthropomorphic animal stories; an owl gives a barn sale but doesn't want to sell anything; the articles are all too full of precious memories. She finally parts with an old clock which is possessed by a series of animals with varied motives. Fox makes a profit, mouse gives a present, raccoon wins a prize, and crow steals a shiny object. "Barnyard Quarrel" is a tempest in a teapot with chicken and rabbit finally becoming friends. "Porcupine's Place to Paint" has interesting details about the problems and distractions of painting. "Woodchuck Plans a Garden" is a variation of the ant-grass hopper theme, with better details and a happier ending. Light reading and no real difficulties?good, non-scary bedtime reading for the little ones. The drawings in black and white are charming and would be fas cinating to color with crayons or water colors. Ungerer shows the variety of his talent in both storywriting and illustrations in No Kiss for Mother. The story shows Piper Paw's irreverent behavior, his resistance to his mother's sweet my-son-can-do-no-wrong permissiveness. This is balanced by the father's realistic understanding. The father makes time to talk with his son, shows that he knows all about the bathroom library of soggy comic books and the fake toothbrushing and other things, since he has done them all himself. Of course, he admits casually that he has lots of cavities. The style is natural and straightforward, with the lines in what looks like poetry form but what is actually thought units. A begin ning reader would gain confidence because he would know where to pause and how to read in phrases. The author uses good strong verbs like "hiss" and "screech" and "growl" and "crumple." The plot builds up through a hilarious school scene where, hopefully, children will empathize but not emulate. A nice touch is the boys' immediate resumption of friendship after their fight. The crisis comes when Mother has finally had it and reacts normally and mother and son begin to respect each other. Critically Speaking</page><page sequence="2">Illustrations are enchanting with little humorous touches, like Materials Mother scaling sardines with a comb, Piper sitting in the bathroom j&lt;&gt;r kids on his "throne," a bottle of schnapps on the breakfast table. Truly, (cont'd) for all ages. Two Brothers is a classic story about the love-hate tension that is present in human relationships and especially in the close ones between brothers. Big Brother is annoyed when Little Brother dis tracts him. He has been responsible during most of the time that he has been left in charge but he finally shuts Little Brother out in the cold as a sort of prank. But Cold is a dangerous enemy in a Russian winter and Big Brother has a long and dangerous journey and much work to do before he has a chance to undo the damage. Big Brother is a dynamic character who grows before our eyes, as we see his whole person?his emotions, his memories. The lan guage is direct but not too simple. "Transparent," for example, is a key word in the reversals of the fairy tale type of plot?ice-fire that chills instead of warming. Russian authors are traditionally good with detail and the details here make the incredible more believable. The interdependence of man and animal is brought out charmingly. In fact, the story is on two levels?concrete and sym bolic. The illustrations are intriguing?traditional in shape but primitive modern in leaving something to the imagination and sug gesting a lot with a line or a dot. Young children would like to have this read to them. Second, third, and fourth graders would like to read it themselves and parents would be reminded of many things. The Nosy Colt is the story of a curious young horse and his misadventures with fire-ants, wasps, and a skunk. But it seems to tell rather than show, although the illustrations are well done. "Nosy" is not really a name but a characteristic and the other ani mals are not named, have no personality. It is hard to imagine children identifying as they do with characters in Wind in the Willows ("You be Rat and you be Mole and I'll be Toad,"?everyone wants to be Toad) or as they do with Mrs. Tabitha Twichit and Peter Rabbit. Perhaps the test of an ex cellent story is the eagerness of children to act it out. An average story, easy to read; it does require the use of some imagination. You might say that The Deep Dives of Stanley Whale is the story of Moby Dick, written from the whale's point of view, except that Uncle Moby isn't the principal character. It's really the story of his nephew, Stanley Whale, who is "small for a whale, about the size of a big automobile." Stanley is believable because he is a bit greedy, talks back to his mother, and wants to grow up before he is quite ready. But after one misadventure, he does something heroic, saves his uncle's life, and then "they all ate a lot of squid for sup per." It is subtly humorous, concrete, enjoyable, with natural lan guage and good casual conversation. The illustrations are simple but full of motion, inspiring imitative drawing. Enjoyable, for adults as well as the preprimer set.</page></plain_text>
