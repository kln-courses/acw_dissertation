The historical reality of the fall is not to be given up, since it is the only satisfac- tory rational explanation of human history and of things as we find them in the world. The Bible religion, with its age-long struggle against sin and Satan, is inexplicable without such a historical basis as is furnished by the record of the fall given in the book of Genesis. WRIGHT, G. F. The Crossing of the Red Sea. Bibliotheca Sacra, July, 9Igo0, pp. 570-79. Recent observations along the route of the exodus by the author confirm the earlier findings of Sir J. W. Dawson. It is held that at the time of the exodus the gulf of Suez extended north as far as Lake Timsah, which is now altered by a 25 or 30-foot geological elevation of the land. The Israelites started from Rameses and went east as far as Lake Timsah. Then, instead of crossing north of Lake Timsah (so Naville and others), they went south along the west shore of the gulf, not crossing just below Lake Timsah (the view of some scholars), but continuing until a point was reached not far north of Suez, between the Bitter Lakes and Suez. Here the water was shallow, and the strong east wind which the Lord sent at this time to open a way of escape for them from the Egyptian host, pressed the water of the Red Sea against 154</page><page sequence="2">CURRENT LITERA TURE I 5 5 the west banks, causing a resultant current to the south, which would reduce the level in the gulf of Suez so as to expose the bottom at this shallow place. The extent of the effects produced by such a wind are amply illustrated in modern experience. The wind would easily open a passage here several miles wide, across which the Israelites could easily pass in one night; while the returning current, on the cessation of the wind, would be amply sufficient to overwhelm the tardy chariots of Pharaoh in their reckless pursuit. Nor is this explanation at all derogatory to the miraculous character of the event. It simply brings the miracle into conformity with the natural conditions implied in the narrative. If the wind was one which had been foreordained from eternity, and originally involved in the mechanical operation of the meteorological forces of the world, it still would have been a miracle of foreknowledge which brought the children of Israel into such a position that they could avail themselves of the opportunity afforded. In reference to the expression "and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand and on their left" (Exod. 14: 22), it is sufficient to say that the word "wall" may here naturally be taken to mean a wall of protection. The Bitter Lakes on their left flank would prevent any adverse movement by Pharaoh from that direc- tion. This figurative use of the word "wall " is frequent; cf. Prov. I8 : I ; Isa. 26: 1; Nah. 3: 8. So the passages in the Song of Moses must be interpreted in accordance with the highly rhetorical nature of the whole composition. BRUSTON, C.

Through all the development of the idea of the Day of Yahweh in the Old Testament there clung to it certain characteristic features, some of which passed on into the later form of the idea found in the New Testament. They were never all equally prominent at one time, but received different degrees of emphasis according as the circumstances of the times and the thought of the nation changed. The very existence of the idea itself was a constant testimony to the fact that the nation felt its inability to work out its own destiny and trusted to Yahweh to complete the task. The ideal of its destiny changed much as the centuries passed, but the consciousness of the need of divine aid in attaining to this ideal grew ever more prominent. There was also a recognition of the fact that the present age was only temporary, and must give way to a better and more glorious one which should abide forever. To inaugu- rate and establish this new era it was necessary that Yahweh himself should come to earth in person and institute the new order of things. This idea of the coming of Yahweh was very crude and anthropomorphic in the first stages of the idea of the Day of Yahweh, but, as the thought concerning God became truer and more exalted, the coming of Yahweh was gradually thought of in a more and more spiritual sense.</page><page sequence="3">156 THE BIBLICAL WORLD Connected with this coming of Yahweh was constantly pictured a series of great catastrophes in the natural world; marvelous portents on land and sea, in air and sky. These convulsions and shocks were just as numerous and conspicuous at the end of the development of the idea as at its beginning; indeed, rather more so after the Day of Yahweh began to take on apocalyptic coloring. This idea of wonders and horrors in the natural world accompanying a revolution in the moral and spiritual world was a natural outcome of the Hebrew conception of the physical universe, which took no account of universal and inviolable natural laws, but thought of Yahweh as directing the movements of the physical world in the most direct and personal way; it was his ordinary custom to punish religious backslidings by withholding the products of the soil. Nature, religion, and morals were directly and closely related to each other through Yahweh, and nothing was more natural than that a great change in the latter sphere should be introduced and accompanied by momentous actions in the former sphere. The time of the coming of the day was always left indefinite, though for the most part it was conceived of as near at hand, at most distant only a few years. But definite and specific predictions were not common with the prophets in any of their work, and they followed the prophetic custom in reference to this subject, leaving it in a state of indefiniteness that could not but add to the terrors which they so generously and vividly described - there was no telling when this awful visitation might fall upon the earth ! Until the very latest days this coming was always conceived -of as connected with some great historical movement of the times. Assyrians, Scythians, Babylonians, Persians, and Greeks were each in succession, as they appeared on the stage of world-history, heralded hy the prophets as Yahweh's agents and instruments in administering the punishments of his great day. It is not till the incoming of apocalyptic prophecy with Malachi and Joel that these historical agents are ever dispensed with, but thereafter Yahweh is represented as personally execut- ing his own decrees. The last common characteristic of importance is the fact that the Day of Yahweh was always represented as introducing a new political state. The prophets were also patriots; they were no less loyal to Judah than to Yahweh; patriotism and religion were inseparably blended in them. Thus, even after the most universal type of monotheism had taken hold of the prophetic consciousness, they were wholly unable to think of Israel in the new kingdom of God otherwise than as the acknowl- edged head of the nations of the world. Jerusalem is to become the religious capital of the world, the abode of Yahweh, Israel's God, whither all the peoples shall come to do him homage. From a position of the slightest political significance in the world, Jerusalem and Judah are to be exalted to the place of greatest renown. The Day of Yahweh was always preeminently a vindication, in one way or another, of Israel, Yahweh's own people. NEW TESTAMENT. BOOKS. *HOLTZMANN, OSCAR. Das Leben esu. Tilbingen: Mohr, I9go. Pp. 428.

This witness is summarized as follows : Jesus represented himself as the eternal Son of God, equal, yet subordinate, to the Father, sent from heaven to reveal God to. men through his teaching, his life, his death; to save the world by the sacrifice of himself. To reject him is to abide in death; to believe in him is to be made one with him, heir of eternal life and heavenly joy. He dwells in the heart of the believer, and in the Father's house above he intercedes for his people, prepares for them a place, sends them the Holy Spirit. At the last day he shall come again to earth, shall summon the dead from their graves, shall sit upon the throne of judgment, and shall pronounce sentence upon every man according to the will of the Father, as that will has been made known to men through his Word. Then with his people he shall reign forever in the glory which he had with the Father before the world was. DAVISON, W. T. Christ and Modern Criticism. Methodist Review (Nash- ville), May-June, 1901, pp. 423-43. This is a reprint from the London Quarterly Review for April, 1901, of an important article whose purpose was to set forth and refute the general trend of the articles upon Christ and the gospels in the Encyclopedia Biblica. It certainly deserves a wide reading in America also, not that it is in all respects correct, but that its spirit and its general position are wisely conservative. FINDLAY, G. G. Sanctification according to Christ. ExIositor, July, 19oI, pp. 1-15. When the Lord Jesus prayed to the Father for his disciples, "Sanctify them in the truth " (John 17 : 17), it was a very practical object upon which his mind was bent. Sanctification, in the thought of Jesus, was both for himself and for them nothing else than consecration to a world-mission. And this mission was ow perfectly definite : it was that of revealing God to mankind in him, and bringing back mankind to God through him.

SMITH, DAVID. Recent New Testament Criticism. 2: The Evangelic Deposit and the Apostolic Witness. Expositor, July, 1901, pp. 16-28. The gospel was a sacred deposit, and the business of its guardians--the disciples - was not to embellish or even interpret it, but simply to preserve it. This duty they would perform with the self-same faithfulness, and by the same skill of memory, wherewith the rabbis guarded the 7rapdaooL rTw v rpe pvrTpwov.

The former of these two articles is an energetic defense of the traditional site of Jesus' burial. The latter argues against both the traditional site and the site near Jeremiah's Grotto outside the Damascus Gate; the writer holds that, as this second site was in Jesus' day in a built-up suburb, the crucifixion must have taken place at a point still farther north; and that in all probability the present so-called "Tombs of the Kings " was the place where Jesus was buried.

American Journal of Theology July, 1901, pp. 473-95- The fundamental idea of God is that of his absolute ethical perfection which consists in holy love and is the essence of his fatherhood. The essential qualities of fatherhood are immanent and eternal in God. It was his fatherly nature, his benig- nant and gracious disposition, that moved God to go forth in acts of creation, to call into being personal agents akin to himself, capable of entering into fellowship with him and so realizing between himself and them the relation of fatherhood and son- ship; and as a means of making himself known to men in a living and powerful way this divinely constituted paternal and filial relationship is, beyond comparison, truer and better than any of the multiplied metaphysical, juristic, forensic, and political ideas and analogies which theologians have generally used for that purpose. The dogmas of arbitrary sovereignty, unconditional reprobation, limited atonement, infant damnation, the perdition of some moral agents to enhance the happiness of the rest, the absurd demands of creed-scription, and many others of a like nature, constituting an essential part of ecclesiastical Christianity, are in my judgment a wide departure</page><page sequence="6">CURRENT LITERA TURE 159 from the Christianity of Christ. The Christianity of the New. Testament passed into expression through the metaphysical ideas and categories of the Greek mind and through the juristic and political ideas of the Latin mind. We see in the Roman Catholic hierarchy the true Christ and the true church buried under mountains of error. The Protestant churches of the Reformation threw off a large part of these errors, but not all of them. We should go on with the reformation and complete the work of emancipation. What the world needs is a Christian theology, a theology built out of the unique and luminous ideas of God, man, and the world given in Jesus Christ. And the formative, determinative idea of this theology will be Christ's doctrine of the fatherhood of God, including in fatherhood those immanent, eternal, ethical perfections of God manifested in Jesus Christ who was the image of the invisible God, the brightness of the Father's glory, the express image of his person. Thus: (I) Fatherhood in creation: God constituting personal agents for beatitude, with a nature akin to his own, and so capable of entering into conscious fellowship with him. (2) Fatherhood in moral government: God dealing with all in holy love, doing all he can wisely do to bring all to their true destination, a state of confirmation in holiness and happiness. (3) Fatherhood in redemption: God providing a way, at infinite cost to himself, whereby he can exercise his forgiving and renewing grace toward sinners, in a way consistent with his absolute ethical perfection. (4) Father- hood in retribution: God, being unable, in the plenitude of his power, wisdom, and love, to win all to the true life of sonship, out of regard to the unfallen and the redeemed, cannot but shut up the incorrigible, the morally incurable, the waste mate- rial of the spiritual universe, in some region away from the realms of light.

Dr. Broadus was one of the most able and influential Christian workers of Ameri- ca's history. His Commentary on the Gospel of Matthew, and his homiletic work entitled The Preparation and Delivery of Sermons, have been recognized as works of excellent scholarship and wisdom, and are in use everywhere throughout the country. Professor Broadus was born in the South, and his work was done there. He was first a professor at Charlottesville University; then he occupied a chair of homiletics at Greenesville, S. C.; later he became professor of New Testament interpretation in the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary at Louisville, Ky. He was president of this institution at the time of his death. The reading of this biography will be found instructive and inspiring to a very wide circle of readers. SMYTH, JOHN.
