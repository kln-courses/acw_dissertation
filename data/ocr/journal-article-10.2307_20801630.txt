<plain_text><page sequence="1">JANICE LEOSHKO ARTFULLY CARVED: UDAYAGIRI/KHANDAGIRI IN ORISSA Sites that are best known for the early development of Indian imagery, such as Bharhut, Sanchi, and Mathur?, as well as those in the ancient Gandh?ran region (present-day Pakistan and northwest India), are also disturbed places. Much there has been lost or reconstructed. This makes discussion of the larger context of visual evidence difficult, a challenge exacerbated by the fact that sculpted works were often shifted from these sites and dispersed to museums or private collections in India and abroad. Such factors helped to focus scholarship on the subjects these sculptures represented, which accorded with particular nineteenth-century Western interests in Indian religions. There often remains an emphasis on ascertaining subject matter in Indian sculpture even when questions about ritual signifi cance, function, viewing practices, or patronage present themselves.1 One troubling consequence of such emphasis is how it limits the appreciation of individual works to the point that in certain ways we have not moved very far from the nineteenth century's overwhelming concern with the religious nature of Indian images. Countering some recent scholarly discussion that perhaps unwittingly perpetuated such an empha sis by suggesting that early Indian imagery was not necessarily meant to be seen, Joanna Williams has asked if it is wise to promote discussions about the significance of monuments of ancient India in only religious terms.2 Indeed, as she notes, the contributions of religious historians rarely depend upon actu ally looking at images. Her exhortation to see early Indian monuments as being artfully carved and meant to be viewed with care seems to me a wonderful perspective, one which can help to control a penchant to embed significance solely in religious and iconographie texts. Directing greater attention to early artistic evidence still in situ may help us see in such ways. In particular I am thinking about what happens when we look more carefully at the evidence provided by early rock-cut monuments. Such sites - Pitalkhora, Bhaja, or Karli, for example - have long been acknowledged as marvels.3 But their usefulness to understanding early Indian architecture often over shadows assessment of their sculptural achievements. It is certainly fortuitous that they help us under stand structures that are now ruined or lost, but perhaps too frequently they are assumed simply to For example, questions about the development of iconic forms and the related controversy concerning an aniconic phase in Buddhist art still fuel many significant scholarly investigations. Aniconicism is an issue, however, that may reveal more about the investigators than the material examined. A nice summation of the recent discussion as a way around this stymied controversy is provided by Rob Linrothe, "Inquiries into the Origin of the Buddha Image: A Review," East and West 43 (Dec. 1993): 241-56. 2 Joanna Williams, "On Viewing Sanci," Archives of Asian Art 50 (1997-98): 93-98. 3 These Buddhist cave sites have certainly in many respects been well studied; see, for example, Vidya Dehejia, Early Buddhist Rock Temples: A Chronology (Ithaca, N.Y.: Cornell University Press, 1972) and numerous studies by Water Spink. More recently, Michael Meister has demonstrated the great significance of such rock-cut monuments in the work of Ananda Coomaraswamy when he wrote about Indian architecture.

Rock-cut monuments are, after all, created by sculptural skills rather than architectural ones. These carved spaces reflect sophisticated thinking about depicting forms by this early date. At the same time certain issues that have become important in discussions of early Indian art have not seemed particularly relevant to evi dence from rock-cut sites - in particular, questions of narrative imagery. Most early reliefs in rock cut monuments are usually just discussed as decorative embellishments. This is where the double hills of Udayagiri/Khandagiri in Orissa seem especially valuable. Since the early nineteenth century the site has garnered repeated attention, but I believe it has yet to be suc cessfully recognized as a remarkable early rock-cut site. Much undoubtedly has been lost, and many of its excavations and reliefs are damaged, but what remains offers much to think about in terms of artistic execution, including the construction of imagery in early Indian art. Beyond presenting var ious subjects, how do the reliefs interact with each other and with the carved architectural spaces around them ? What insights do they offer into what Jain and Buddhist imagery did and did not share ? The two small hills that comprise Udayagiri/Khandagiri contain some of the earliest rock-cut religious structures in the subcontinent (figs, i, 2). The hills are a short distance away from Bhubanesh war, well known for its many later temples. The thirty-two excavations clustered in these hills range in size and configuration but most consist of a narrow, benched veranda giving access to small, indi vidual chambers assumed to be dwelling places for religious mendicants (fig. 3). The shallow veran das would provide some further protection from heat or rain for those dwelling in the inner chambers. Although the excavations are mostly small in size, many are ornamented with figurai reliefs and carved architectural forms. Ornament appears most often inside the veranda on the entrance wall to the indi vidual cells, as is seen in Cave 3 on Khandagiri Hill (fig. 3).4 Usually reliefs are carved on the upper part of the wall between the doorways which are framed by pilasters with animal capitals. The pilasters are surmounted by carved arches ; their horseshoe-shaped form is often designated as a catty a arch. The tympanum area thus created above the doorway is often embellished, as occurs in Cave 3 where deeply carved garlands loop around lotuses (fig. 4). In this instance carved ribbing appears above the tympa num, seemingly an echo of wooden forms. The assemblage certainly creates a distinctive entrance to what is presumably an ascetic residence. It is generally believed that the rock-cut structures at Udayagiri/Khandagiri were all created at the same time; the dates given by scholars for their execution have ranged from 100 CE to 25 CE, with circa 50 BCE now the most accepted dating. These excavations are thus as early as their more famous counterparts found at Buddhist sites in the Western Ghats (e.g. Pitalkhora, Bhaja, and Karli).5 The Orissan excavations, however, are Jain, not Buddhist. Their Jain character may account for their unusual plans, but there is just not sufficient comparative material, meaning other Jain excavations, to be sure. Jainism, which shares many features with Hinduism and Buddhism, is believed to have emerged slightly earlier than Buddhism with the teachings of the Jina Mahavira (c. 6th century BCE). Ajina ("victor") is one who has crossed over life's endless stream and thus achieved moksha ("release"). Jain 4 The most complete if terse description of the site is given by the former Director General of the Archaeological Sur vey of India, Debaia Mitra, in Udayagiri and Khandagiri (New Delhi: Archaeological Survey of India, i960). 5 This Orissan activity is thus seen as slightly later than Bharhut, but earlier than Sanchi. 8</page><page sequence="3">belief posits a series of Jinas with Mahavira being the last to have lived, similar to the role of ?akya muni in Buddhist thought. By providing a model and a path for others, ajina can also be called a t?rthankara, a ford-maker, and Jains are followers of Jinas.6 Jain practice is usually thought to be more rigorous than that of Hindu or Buddhist devotees, and Jainism never became as popular as Hinduism or as widespread as Buddhism. Although early Jain works are often as old as comparable Buddhist forms, Jain art is rarely discussed as being as innovative or interesting as early Buddhist art. And since later Jain art is often thought largely to follow Hindu developments, it is not surprising to find that Jain art traditions are much less studied than those of Buddhism or Hinduism.7 Although the exca vations at Udayagiri/Khandagiri are quite early, they are generally assumed to provide dwelling retreats (called lena in inscriptions) for Jain ascetics that are quite similar to those provided for other mendicant groups elsewhere in the subcontinent. The nearest geographical and chronological coun terparts are the earlier but much smaller Lomas Rishi excavations in the Barabar Hills (made for Ajivikas), so this vast complex at Udayagiri/Khandagiri is actually quite unusual for its time. Many of Udayagiri/Khandagiri's features were noticed by the middle of the nineteenth century, including various reliefs as well as the inscriptions that provide the only known written records about the site. James Prinsep, the important Indologist who first deciphered the Brahmi script, worked on these Orissan inscriptions, as have many later scholars.8 The inscriptions are largely accounts of dona tions by mostly unknown patrons.9 They document enduring practice there, for the inscriptions range in date over one thousand years. The longest is also one that provides the most interesting evidence about significant early patronage at the site. This is the only known record of an Orissan king named Kharavela.10 It begins with an invocation to siddhas and arhats - esteemed Jain figures - and records the donation of excavations by Kharavela as well as detailing his military and political successes in ancient Kalinga. Scholars have often emphasized how the inscription, usually thought to date from the first century CE, records that Kharavela brought back the Jina which had in former times been seized by a rival kingdom. Although this mention of retrieving the Kalinga Jina does not explicitly call it an image, most who have written about it have assumed it was, leading to much consternation over the fact that there are no early Jina images among the many surviving reliefs at the site. This is but one demonstration of the excessive focus on issues of anthropomorphic representation in discus 6 Paul Oundas, Jains, 2nd ed. (London: Routledge, 2002). 7 The recent and lovely exhibition of Jain art demonstrates not only the increasing attention given this imagery, but the significance of doing so. See Phyllis Granoff, ed., Victorious Ones: Jain Images of Perfection (New York: Rubin Museum of Art, 2009). 8 James Prinsep, "A Note on the Inscription at Udayagiri and Khandagiri in Cuttack in Lat Character, "Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal 8 (1837): 1072-91. 9 The earliest published Western notice of the site is that of A. Stirling, "An Account Geographical, Statistical, and Historical of Orissa Proper, or Cuttack," Asiatick Researches 15 (1825). Those who worked on the site in the nineteenth century and published their findings include: Rajendralalam Mitra, Antiquities of Orrisa, vol. 2 (Calcutta, 1880), 1-46; James Fergusson and James Burgess, The Cave Temples of India (London, 1880), 55-94; A. Cunningham and J. D. Beglar, Archaeological Survey of India Reports 13 (Calcutta, 1882), 79-95. 10 Many scholars have edited and commented upon Kharavela's inscription; the most authoritative is D. C. Sircar, Select Inscriptions Bearing on Indian History and Civilization, vol. 1 (Calcutta: University of Calcutta, 1965), 213-21. For this and other inscriptions, see also R. D. Banerji, "Inscriptions in the Udayagiri and Khandagiri Caves," Epigraphia Indica 13(1915-16): 159-67. 9</page><page sequence="4">sions about early Indian art. The fact that Kharavela was a formidable ruler, forcefully engaged in enlarging his empire throughout India, garners less attention. This record of his donations, however, may ultimately help to explain the unusual character of early activity at the site. For example, the elab orate and sophisticated nature of many reliefs may reflect such high-level patronage. Since the nineteenth century repeated notice has been given the reliefs carved in the rock-cut walls of the verandas outside the individual chambers.11 Written accounts are, however, largely descriptive with simple acknowledgements of their similarity to more heralded reliefs at other sites. For instance, Debaia Mitra, a former Director General of the Archaeological Survey of India who did much work at various sites in Orissa, observed the deep carving in the Udayagiri/Khandagiri reliefs but she dismissed these well-defined forms as just being like those on the gateways of Sanchi's great stupa.11 This follows the view of previous scholars who saw no significance to such execution if it was nothing new, reflect ing the bias for iconographie issues. Yet these Jain reliefs are sometimes earlier and work in a differ ent pictorial manner than reliefs found elsewhere, and the deep carving is still striking whether it can be seen elsewhere or not. Indeed, the assured carving, the complex compositions, and the distinctive treatments of forms such as figurai poses, surely merit more consideration than so far received. Thankfully, constraints on the value of early Indian art have lost much ground in recent times as it is increasingly recognized that the actual creation of forms contributes part of the meaning : to under stand the subject fully depends on understanding how, literally, something is depicted. This is after all an important part of the effect that visual images can have upon viewers. Nonetheless the mental habit of reducing the significance of visual art to what it represents is difficult to suppress, especially for those most interested in religious matters or for those who continue to regard visual evidence as mere illustration. By embracing Williams' call to look carefully, however, new questions can be asked, such as how do narrative fields interact with symbolic elements, and can we discern a grammar of forms that evokes particular effects? For example, in the unusually large Cave on Udayagiri Hill (also called Rani Gumpha), what exactly happens in the juxtaposition of the various visual elements and carved spaces ? The small projecting chambers created at each end of the main section ? usually called guard rooms because of their location - are covered with a tangled web of imagery that has no counterpart else where at the site (fig. 5). The densely carved surface depicting various animals and birds amidst plants and flowers beside a deeply sculpted and larger scaled figure bearing a spear creates a striking effect. The swirling panorama is surely something more intentional than mindless decoration. Both in terms of what they depict and the way they appear juxtaposed with each other and with the excavated spaces, these and other carvings at Udayagiri/Khandagiri may have much to tell us about the nature of early Indian art, not just Jain art. This is possible because it is a significant body of material still in situ, allowing us to consider the effect of the variety of these forms that also remain part of the rock from which they are shaped. These carved forms are part of a larger landscape of cre ated and natural spaces through which human visitors move. h No scholars, however, have yet considered why Jain ascetics, noted for their rigorous practice, needed or permitted these embellishments. 12 Mitra, Udayagiri and Khandagiri. IO</page><page sequence="5">A simple example of how much this context can bring to seeing carefully occurs with reliefs in Cave 6 on Khandagiri Hill. A small cave, it has two doorways opening into a single cell. Pilasters sur mounted by a decorated arch frame each doorway. The tympanum areas created by the carved arches are blank, but between those arches are carved four figures standing around a tree (fig. 6). The figures hold out what seem to be offerings and make gestures that suggest homage. The tree is enclosed by a vedika (railing) and topped by an umbrella, very similar to compositions that depict tree worship at other sites. Carved on the stone surfaces on the other side of each arch are grimacing, portly figures bearing baskets of flowers (fig. 7). Larger in scale than the figures depicted in the tree relief, these two demon-like beings nonetheless also make gestures of homage. An analysis of these reliefs might note how the central scene was a typical depiction of tree vener ation - at best a generic narrative - like so many encountered in early reliefs at Buddhist sites ; the side reliefs might not even seem worthy of mention if assumed to be simply stock depictions of devotion, even though such demonic devotees are not commonly encountered in early Indian imagery.13 It would be an approach that isolates subjects by an emphasis on identifying individual scenes or symbols, per ceiving importance in terms of what seems unusual (or earliest) as well as what seems narrative. While single works removed from their original context may be most easily dealt with as individual works, such treatment is hardly necessary here. Focusing on individual reliefs does not allow us to consider the full impact upon viewers at the site who would see all the carvings, not just the central one, nor can we contemplate the effect of the reliefs in their excavated spaces as well as within the whole site. The two larger, grimacing figures frame and underscore the veneration in the central scene as they too carry blossoms and baskets with flowers. The reliefs certainly signal a distinctly wondrous world within the rock-cut space where viewers also stand. These reliefs and the central one demonstrate par ticular decisions made by the artists who carved and placed these forms, and it seems useful to won der exactly for whom and for what effect these reliefs might have served as we recall that these spaces are supposed to be the residences of ascetics. Were these scenes of veneration, and the wonder they inspired, aimed at these occupants or those who came to visit them? Did ascetics also become won drous and venerable by occupying these spaces ? In addition to considering how the carved forms work within a single space, when we consider these depictions within the larger context of the site, we may also wonder what exactly does the depiction of tree worship - an outdoor practice - mean in rock-cut spaces, and what is the significance of similar scenes at Udayagiri/Khandagiri? Such reliefs may indi cate something distinct about the site since it is not a subject commonly found at other Jain sites as, for example, among the abundant remains at Mathur?. The fact that Jain art is often seen as simply derivative of the greater and more innovative Bud dhist tradition has certainly affected the perception of Udayagiri /Khandagiri. This site seldom figures in discussions of early Indian art, despite the significant skills evinced at the site and its early date. An issue worth further consideration is how the frequent scholarly practice of focusing on the develop ment of a single religious tradition in India has led to the peculiar character assigned to Jain imagery, which is moreover much less studied than Buddhist or Hindu imagery. 13 Robert de Caroli, Haunting the Buddha: Indian Popular Religions and the Formation of Buddhism (New York: Oxford University Press, 2004) has demonstrated the importance of such minor divinities in early Buddhist art, but has not found an emphasis on their role as devotees. II</page><page sequence="6">Perhaps the site's location in a region with many elaborate Hindu and Buddhist monuments has also made it seem of limited significance, even though it is by far the earliest. Indeed, the frequent refrain in modern discussions unfavorably compares and rather summarily dismisses Jain visual works, especially in comparisons with Buddhist examples. This is a topic that we can continue to produc tively probe, especially with regard to what "defines" Jain elements and, in this context, what defines religious art, especially given the perceived "ascetic" nature of the religion.14 The reliefs found throughout this site present a range of subjects, but the majority depict devo tional scenes or figures and symbols that seem familiar as they are encountered elsewhere in early Jain and Buddhist art. Real enthusiasm in the scholarship has only appeared around subjects not found elsewhere, and so far there has been little real enthusiasm about these sites. Interest has lain in find ing unique Jain subjects rather than in the significance of subjects shared with other Indie religious traditions, or even in how similar subjects might be differently treated. The most thorough studies on the content of Udayagiri/Khandagiri reliefs so far undertaken are those of Professor R. P. Mohapatra.15 His work sought to establish the abundant variation found in the details of costumes, ornaments, armaments, and other features in order to consider how these might also reflect actual forms from the period. His careful attention to what is unusual about what is depicted might be usefully extended to how this is so. The next question to ask, it seems to me, concerns what the reliefs do as they interact with each other and with the various rock-cut spaces at the site. To dismiss these reliefs because there seems little that is new in them, little that does not replicate forms already well known from sites such as Bharhut or Sanchi, is to miss the interesting questions these Jain reliefs raise about the shared significance of certain themes. One such example is a relief pre sumed to depict the solar deity S?rya (fig. 8). When discussed it is characterized as simply like the more famous and near-contemporary example from Bodhgay?, which was for a long time discussed as simply demonstrating Western influence in the depiction of a solar deity. Recently, scholars have pointed to the ways in which the Buddha's enlightenment is described in texts by analogies to the sun dispelling the darkness of illusion.16 What then such a figure might mean in a Jain context is also cer tainly worth considering. If solar elements connote enlightenment in Buddhist art, do they connote the same injain art? 14 The seemingly different situation highlights the constraints inherent in separately studying the art associated with different religious traditions, as it does not allow us to judge adequately the real distinctions and similarities. The fact that Jain inscriptions indicate that images were given by laypersons at the suggestion of their mendicant teachers is different from Buddhist examples in which monks themselves were often the donors of the images; this suggests a useful avenue for further thought about the differences in mendicant practices. I have discussed some of these issues in "Reviewing Early Jaina Art," Symposium Proceedings: Approaches to Jaina Studies (Toronto: University of Toronto, 1999), 324-41, but a fuller study is needed. 15 R. P. Mohapatra,Jaina Monuments ofOrissa (New Delhi: D. K. Publications, 1984). 16 See Janice Leoshko, "The Implications of Bodhgaya's S?rya as a Symbol of Enlightenment, " in Aksayantvt: Essays Pre sented to Dr. Debaia Mitra in Admiration of Her Scholarly Accomplishments, ed.

She discusses how the center of their carved surfaces may con note the place of enlightenment, paralleling general and early verbal descriptions of the sun as the place of rupture with the human realm of the living.17 The fact that this central spot is often occupied by solar symbols such as the cakra seems then to point beyond to the state of formless equanimity that is the ultimate goal, an assumption reinforced by the fact that sometimes ajina figure is depicted in this central position on an ?y?gapata. Does this mean that depictions of solar deities can relay something more than representations of themselves, something perhaps to evoke the realm if not the process of enlightenment? These are not small matters, as they suggest that the operation of meaning may be akin to the functioning of metaphor. A consideration of how concepts may be signified in early Indian art at least brings us closer to considering the possible dynamics in which depicted forms might have affected those who saw them. It is this perspective that seems compatible with the notion of "artfully carved" : the deliberate visual strategies at work in early Jain art may include metaphorical dimensions. There are many interesting aspects about the imagery of Udayagiri/Khandagiri that should be discussed, but I want to conclude by considering how the site's imagery is affected by the varying nar rative quality of some reliefs and how the perceived importance of narrative affects our perception of this imagery. In addition to encountering reliefs that present subjects seen elsewhere, there are also unusual subjects at Udayagiri/Khandagiri. The character of some of these has caused scholars to com ment on their seemingly unreligious nature, but this has not provoked further interest. Surprisingly, no one has yet construed any significance for what is unusual and sometimes still unidentified imagery in these reliefs. Early religious narrative sculpture in India is often judged through a lens formed by Gandh?ran depictions dating from the Kushan period (c. ist~3rd centuries CE), but the extreme degree of narra tivity in these Buddhist works is not found in works from other regions even of the same date. The seemingly greater narrative detail found in Gandh?ran art has been and often still is framed as an issue of chronological development, a process in which later works seem to lose their complexity, becom ing degenerative or mere rote presentations while ones dating before Gandh?ran examples are labeled as simply less evolved. Here I think the Orissan Jain reliefs can make a useful intervention, especially because they are works still in situ. This puts us in the position of assessing what might be significant not just about their content but also about the construction of their placement, and that allows fuller consideration of their possible narrative impact. The most remarkable reliefs in this regard appear in the upper storey of Cave 1 on Udayagiri Hill, also called the Rani Gumpha cave (fig. 10). It is usually acknowledged as the most elaborate and beau tiful of the site's excavations; it is certainly the largest and most unusual, containing for instance the side chambers briefly discussed above (fig. 6). It is lavishly furnished with carved reliefs, and unlike elsewhere at the site, most of the subjects seem unusual. The fact that the subjects cannot be identified might be a reason to avoid discussion of how they narrate. But being perverse perhaps, I think this actually provides an interesting opportunity. While much must be brought to images for the exact identification of their subjects, confronting unknown subjects allows us to see how much is still com municated. In this regard the reliefs in Rani Gumpha seem very distinctly not about religious prac tice, and that sets them in contrast to most of the other imagery at the site. 21</page><page sequence="16">Rani Gumpha is also unusual as a two-storied excavation. Each level has a main section with a benched veranda in front of a number of cells, and there are smaller wings on each side. Each level has four cells in the main section, but while those in the upper storey are arranged in a row, each cell hav ing two doors, the lower storey has three cells in a row with a fourth on the right end of the veranda. Moreover, the lower storey is further distinguished as the center cell has three doorways, while the others have only two each. The veranda walls outside the cells present reliefs in the intervals between the doorways as are typ ically found elsewhere at the site. The doorways to the cells are framed by arches atop pilasters with the tympana left empty. These features again can be found elsewhere at the site. What is unusual is the character of some of the reliefs. Despite differences in the plan of excavated spaces on each level, the inner wall of the veranda at both levels presents nine intervals between the doorways in which reliefs have been carved (fig. 11). Those on the upper storey are acclaimed as the finest; they seem to depict very distinct scenes or, per haps, separate stories. Those on the lower storey are not considered to be as finely carved, but they may simply be more damaged. Also unidentified, the nine reliefs on the lower storey wall suggest a more continuous frieze of sequential actions, one that may be tied to the idea of a procession. Both levels, of course, may well illustrate as yet unidentified Jain tales.18 Nonetheless, the reliefs convey a sense of stories without signs of overt religious practice. It is interesting to consider them as a range of stories depicting a worldly realm. In the upper storey, the first and last reliefs are large figures carrying baskets, much like the pair of grimacing beings seen earlier (fig. 7). But the reliefs between them have a very different character. Finely and deeply carved, the compositions are crowded with figures in striking poses that create scenes with dramatic presence. Figure 12 shows the first such scene where charging elephants cause figures to scatter. The jumble of forms and composition are much more akin to painted imagery than to the intricate but shallow compositions of Bharhut or the majority of Sanchi reliefs, which, although similar in being deeply carved, are generally more orderly.19 The Sanchi reliefs seem more obviously didactic, often lacking the same degree of dramatic complex ity. The unusual character of Rani Gumpha's reliefs and the lack of recognizable religious elements make it tempting to think that they in some way relate to royal themes. It is an interesting possibil ity, considering the grand scale of this excavation and Kharavela's inscription placed higher up on this hill. In this context it may be significant that this inscription is near the remains of an early structure that may be evidence that this site was more than a residence for practicing ascetics. 8 V. S.

These do not, however, provide convincing arguments. 19 There are exceptions such as the reliefs depicting the battles over the distribution of relics. 20 Debaia Mitra, "Excavation at Udayagiri, District Purl, " in Indian Archaeology, ip$8-$p: A Review, ed.

This excavation, conducted by Debaia Mitra for the Archaeological Survey of India, however, uncov ered evidence of one of the earliest structural apsidal halls yet to be found in the Indian subcontinent.20 Although it was not fully excavated, she concluded that it was likely coeval with the majority of exca vations on the hill, and she noted that its position on the hilltop was near the Kharavela inscription (which is in Cave 14, known as the Hathi Gumpha). Importantly, Kharavela's inscription mentions not only caves (lena) that he caused to be constructed but a caitya and pillars as well. Previously the thirty-three excavations arrayed across both hills have been assumed to be simply dwelling places for Jain ascetics. Because of the seeming absence of a structure like the rock-cut caitya halls found at early Buddhist sites, it was presumed that no organized worship activity occurred at Udayagiri/Khandagiri. That the discovery of the remains of an early structural caitya hall did not alter this assumption is perhaps another example of how preconceived notions about the nature of religious practice can overwhelm other aspects.21 Why exactly, we might ask, have discussions most often emphasized an overwhelming ascetic atmosphere to interpret this site's activities and its imagery? Unfortunately, the remains of the hall do not suggest what might have been inside this early struc ture, but it seems quite possible that it was the site of ritual practices by the residents as well as by others from the larger Jain community, and certainly some of those could well have been elite if not royal donors, including even Kharavela. It is interesting in this context to note that in 1815 a Jain tem ple was built atop Khandagiri Hill, as seen in a later nineteenth-century photograph (fig. 13). Dedi cated to Neminatha, it renewed devotional activity that had occurred earlier.22 When we pay attention to how images work, greater attention to how narratives are literally con structed - in this case carved - also seems valuable. Here might be the place to consider how the per formative aspect shaped the varied participation of those who saw the imagery but were not its mak ers. I have wondered what effects the specific aspects of execution in these reliefs might have had on their viewers. I believe it was the high quality of carving in particular which first made me wonder about this and about how one identifies narrative elements. In what ways have sculptors created cer tain effects? In order to understand how the reliefs might work, I realize that the discrete parts as well as the very aspect of execution requires fuller study than has so far occurred. Further, when looking at the reliefs on the second storey of the Rani Gumpha cave, we see doors and scenes interacting on wall surfaces, framed by depicted architectural details and modulated by the rhythms of composition, and yet these walls are still very clearly part of the rock rising out of the earth. When we look at the effect of Rani Gumpha in this larger context, we might see how this elaborate excavation helps to shape the character of Udayagiri Hill, which was once also crowned by a constructed apsidal hall. It is interest ing to see this hill in the light of royal patronage intertwining with religious activity. Further study 21 A good consideration of the limitations of assumptions about religious practices is given by Gregory Schopen, " Archae ology and Protestant Presuppositions in the Study of Indian Buddhism," History of Religions 30 (1991): 1-23. 22 It is interesting to think of the top of this hill, clearly full of stone memorials to arhats (fig. 13), in relation to the apsi dal hall on the adjacent hill. The small memorials echo a practice noticed elsewhere in the commemoration of Jain ascetic practice; the building echoes the tendency to erect Jain temples atop hills. There is also some room to wonder here about the effect on these excavations from the nearby grand inscription of Asoka at Dhauli. 23</page><page sequence="18">may someday allow us to understand the dynamics of Jain religious practices that created symbiotic social roles.
