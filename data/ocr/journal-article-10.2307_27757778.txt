<plain_text><page sequence="1">victor ya. frenkel* Yakov Ilich Frenkel: Sketches toward a civic portrait Midway through the 1950s, my fathers brother, Vladimir Ilich Frenkel, passed down to me a few folders containing letters written by the three Frenkel brothers-Yakov (1894-1952), Vladimir (1896-1962), and Sergei (1900-1920). These letters were addressed to their parents?Ilya Abramo vich (1863-1938) and Rakhilia Abramovna (1872-1944). On leaving for the front in 1941 Vladimir Ilich stuffed these letters close between the wall and the highest wardrobe in his room. (V.I. Frenkel was mobilized from the start of the war and served as a military doctor in 23rd Army of the Leningrad front.)1 His room was part of a communal apartment on Mytninskaia Street. I think it is precisely because they were so well-hidden that these letters did not share the same fate as so many other Leningrad family archives. The temporary inhabitants of their room did not burn these folders in small blockade stoves like other people had burned those that they had found. So I turned out to be the owner and trustee of a veritable treasure. The correspondence of my grandfather and grandmother should be added to the letters mentioned above. The first letters kept by my grandfather dated to the very beginning of 1906. He had remained in Kazan while the rest of his family lived in Switzerland, where Ilya Abramovich had sent them to save them from the pogroms that were then rolling through Russia. * Victor Frenkel died earlier this year before he could review the edited translation of the pa per that follows. It is in many respects incomplete, especially in the scholarly apparatus ex pected of papers in HSPS. Its human qualities, however, may balance this shortcoming: it is offered not as a research paper, but as the insight of an ordinary-physicist son into the troubled life of his extraordinary-physicist father. I am most obliged to Darlene Reddaway not only for her translation but also for her willingness to find answers to the questions that arose during the editing. j.l.h. 1. Victor Ya.

EARLY DAYS As a young man, living in Taganrog, Ilya Abramovich Frenkel was fas cinated by the ideas espoused by the People's Will [Narodnaia Volya] movement. In 1879, he was arrested for the first time and served two months, after which he was released on grounds that he was but a "youth ful offender." However, the lesson did him no good. In January 1884, hav ing already come to Moscow while attempting to secure ties with the Mos cow People's Will movement, he was again arrested, judged, and sentenced to imprisonment and exile in Siberia, in the city of Berezov (formerly Bere zovo). He served a few years of soldier's duty there. I found out about all this in the manuscript that contained his reminiscences: "Journey to prison and Siberia." These seven years spent in Siberia were a special university for Grand father. He came to meet highly intelligent people who generously shared their knowledge with him and acquainted him with culture. When he returned to freedom, he withdrew from political activity and became a civil servant, but he did not lose his old ties and democratic mettle. According to S.Yu. Witte's account, former "political activists" were enthusiastically taken into the lower ranks of government service. This was to guarantee their honesty. The same "personnel policy" was maintained in private enterprise as well. Grandfather advanced rapidly in this profession and was earning a good salary as his wedding approached. As is often the case with people who are attracted to higher education but are not able to complete systematic schooling, he did not spare means in providing a good education for his children. All of them had a command of two or three foreign languages, Vladimir and Sergei played piano, and Yakov played the violin. The eldest son also received a good education in art. In May 1931, he wrote his parents from America while on a year-long business trip for the People's Commissar for Education: I'm glad you didn't scrimp on my training in music and painting. I have a feeling of serenity and satisfaction often mingled with a sense of gratitude for having been given an opportunity in childhood to lay a firm supportive foun dation for these studies. The children inherited the democratic tradition of the father. Yakov Frenkel wrote on 1 January 1906, "I wish you a happy New Year [father], a happier one, as I would think, than in 1905. I desire that a time of peace and prosperity come for Russia, and that the government might be crushed and annihilated by the revolutionary forces. May God grant that all of ours be healthy and happy."2 Yasha Frenkel may not yet have been filled down 2. Ibid., 4.</page><page sequence="3">YAKOV FRENKEL 199 to his "young toenails" with revolutionary ideas. But he had access to plenty of them around the family hearth. Towards autumn of 1906, the Frenkel family settled in Minsk and in 1909 they made their way to Petersburg. There the Frenkel brothers registered in one of the most progressive gymnasiums?the May Gym nasium (on Vasilievskii Island). It had a very strong staff of instructors. The physicist Fyodor Nikolaevich Indrikson, who was the author of the school's physics textbook, noticed Yasha's talent. (While Indrikson taught in the gymnasium, he was also a lecturer under the famous university professor O.D. Khvol'son.) Among the other instructors at the gymnasium two were diametrically opposed in their political convictions. Edward Edwardovich Essen (1879-1931) later became an active participant of the October Revo lution. After the victory, he became a People's Commissioner for the Soviet Minister's Commission on Governmental Control [Goskontrol]; he ended as the rector of the Academy of Arts. The other, Vladimir Nikolaevich Kora blev, a high-profile scholar, was rather reactionary in his convictions. Yasha Frenkel preserved some documents about his clashes with pupils of the senior class at the gymnasium. At the gymnasium, Yasha studied Spencer (I still have father's copy of Spencer's two volume Psychology, with his comments in the margins) and V.Ya. Zhelezov's then popular book, Essay on political economy. This and other reading, combined with the family's domestic political thought, influenced a composition Yasha wrote just before World War I. In it he attacks the autocracy's bureaucrats, who comprised the majority of officers in the tsar's army, as "do-nothings" and "unwitting murderers," erstwhile "heroes" who were being transformed into "parasites, and who were living at society's expense, promoting the societal decay." Many years later, when showing me this composition, father recalled how Korablev, striking himself on his breast, pathetically exclaimed that the only thing that prevented him from acheiving his dream of military service was the poor state of his health. Yasha received a "D" for his essay and Korablev raised the question of expelling him before the gymnasium's Pedagogical Council. I have examined the protocol of the Council's meet ings, which were retained in the Leningrad State Historical Archive among the papers of the May Gymnasium. The name of Yakov Frenkel often flits over the pages of Gymnasium protocols, usually with a favorable mention. 1912: "Frenkel is very capable, perhaps a future scholar." 1913: Korablev writes about the eighth grade class in which father studied: "The class is developed, capable, intelligent, but the general physiognomy is undefined: children; Frenkel is the exception." Two months before the leaving exams, the gymnasium's Director, A.A. Lipovskii, urged the Council to show "if possible, a calm acceptance and indulgence. It's already too late," he</page><page sequence="4">200 FRENKEL added, "to educate Frenkel." Father passed the graduation exams with all "A's, and graduated from the gymnasium with a gold medal? despite his free thinking.3 In 1913, father entered the Mathematical Division of the Physics and Mathematics Department of Petersburg University. N.N. Semenov was among those in his class?the future famous chemist and Nobel Laureate. Nikolai Nikolaevich recalled that father hardly attended lectures, but studied on his own, and graduated from the university in three years instead of the usual four. He remained there after graduation to prepare for professorial duties. He was absorbed in scholarship. I know nothing of his political and social activism in those years. At this time sorrow came barreling down upon the Frenkel family. In the beginning of 1917, having been ill for but one day, Vitya died?the gen eral favorite, the youngest of the four Frenkel brothers. The health of their mother, R.A. Frenkel, took a serious turn for the worse. Ilya Abramovich had a serious breakdown. Soon, probably before the February Revolution, the parents and Sergei moved to the Crimea while the elder brothers remained in Petrograd. 2. THE REVOLUTION Petersburg Here are excerpts from letters father wrote during the revolution in Petersburg.4 Petrograd, March 6, 1917. Long reign freedom, and those to whom we are indebted for it! This is the first Russian freedom, attained by the third Rus sian revolution. The first revolution (1825) was a revolution of troops without the people. The second (1905)?a revolution of the people without troops. And, finally, the third?a revolution of the people-troops and troops people, having merged into one. This is the reason why this third revolution spread with lightning speed, as a powerful and friendly breath, dispersing the threatening specter of the old authority. And the people who for so long had groaned under the yoke of this authority realized, with inexpressible astonish ment, that they had feared a specter that drew its entire power from the disunity of the people. But once the people had united, their powerful arm pushed aside those pitiable and base little minions who, while frightening them with the old specter, attempted to subjugate them to a new one. Now all the specters have disappeared into the native gloom where they creep, 3. Ibid., 9. 4. Ibid., 16-17.</page><page sequence="5">YAKOV FRENKEL 201 allowing the people to forge their own freedom with their own powers. And so, long reign freedom and the coming Democratic Republic! And may the Russian people prosper and flourish! Petrograd, March 9, 1917. By the way, isn't it astounding with what unan imity the people are demanding a democratic republic? I haven't had occasion to hear a single declamation in favor of the monarchy. The prestige of tsarist authority, shaken by 1905, has fallen once and for all in this year of war, drenched in the muck of debauchery and treachery. Today I set off for the university to attend a meeting of young instructors of the Mathematics Department to discuss, if I am not mistaken, issues relat ing to organization and union. Just imagine, I was also caught up in civic matters, and more precisely?I am helping to organize elections for the popu lace of the Rozhdestvenskii Quarter (200,000 inhabitants) by the "four house" system of representatives for the Regional Duma (Committee). I will write about my participation in more detail when it takes more concrete form. Of course, I haven't hardly touched science for these two weeks. Petrograd, April 14, 1917. We have no new news. And, for my part, I have none, if we don't count the three brochures (on imperialism, militarism, and the educational system of the democratic state), which I wrote in the last few days. I hope they will be published.5 Petrograd, April 18, Old Style (May 1, New Style), 1917. Volodya described to you in detail what is ordinarily called the "May 1st Disturbances," but what has now turned into a celebration of order, freedom, and international solidarity. I will add but a few words about my own experiences and adven tures. At 10 o'clock in the morning, I bolted from home and set off for Alex ander Square?the meeting point for the Rozhdenstvenskii Quarter. I listened to the orators for a long time. There were good ones and bad ones. The public's reaction to them was typical. Isolated exclamations, which expressed disapproval, were immediately suppressed, and they offered the dissatisfied person a chance to make his objections from the tribune, and not to interrupt the orator. The watchword "freedom of speech" worked magic. I did not put up with the nonsense delivered by one of the orators (of course, an intellec tual), and for the first time in my life stepped out in the role of an orator agitator. I set about to convince the public that one shouldn't confuse the people with the ruling classes, that the German people were as disinterested in the war as the Russian people, that they were deceived. The German peo ple had been persuaded that "they had been attacked." I asserted that in order to conclude a quick peace it would be necessary to assuage the German people by effecting the absence of the Russian people in their land, and not 5. Ibid., 17.</page><page sequence="6">202 FRENKEL only that, but the absence of military designs on the part of the Russian government against their land. And to achieve the latter, we should immedi ately address the enemy and the allied powers with an official program for peace, and so on. At first someone began to scream: "Down with him!" but they calmed him down, and then they began to shout: "Right!"6 Vladimir Ilich, writing to their father on 19 April 1917, described his brother's forays into political oratory: Yakov delivered speeches a few times, not without success, it seems, on Mars Field. At the demonstration in the Chinizelli circus another issue was rlised that brought Yakov indescribable joy: the representatives of the 8th Army were asked about their relationship with the Provisional Government and they received the following answer: for us there is one government?that is the Council of Worker's and Soldier's Deputies, in our eyes the Provisional Government is but an executive organ. This view found approbation with the greater part of the audience. In the last letter he wrote before his departure from Petrograd for the Crimea (dated 27 December 1917), father described the first Bolshevik vic tories and supported the extra-political course adopted by them. This letter ends:7 Don't conclude from what I've said that I have gone over to the Bolshevik faith. As before, I consider their attempt to be Utopian, and their power to be ephemeral. But I cannot deny the splendor of this attempt, nor can I deny their extraordinary bravery, logic, and consistency. I also cannot help wishing them success, not believing, however, in its possibility. I suppose that it is too late now to take a step back so as to then pursue the longer, more roundabout path, and therefore I cannot help condemning attempts by the Russian intelligentsia to foment sabotage and to ramrod the chariot wheels of Bolshevism, rather than to help lead their chariot along the path from which there is already no return. Now it is too late to fight the Bolsheviks; they must be assisted in order to diminish the negative results of their policies and to augment the positive ones. The Crimea On New Year's Eve, 1918, Yakov and Vladimir Frenkel left Petersburg for Yalta. By then, Soviet power had been established in the Crimea. Yakov settled into teaching physics and mathematics at the Tauride university?a branch of Kiev University. This was one of the most remarkable 6. Ibid. 7. Ibid., 20.</page><page sequence="7">YAKOV FRENKEL 203 educational institutions of its kind, still awaiting its own attentive historian. Significant scientists had gathered there. The future academicians N.M. Krylov and V.I. Smirnov worked in its Mathematics Department. For about a year the future Academician I.E. Tamm taught in its Physics Department. Professors A.G. Gurvich, N.I. Kuznetsov, and A.A. Liubishchev worked in its Biology Department. For a long time the Rector of the university was V.L Vernadskii, who was already widely known. In the ranks of the human ities, stood the literary scholars N.K. Gudzii and A.A. Smirnov, and his torian V.I. Grekov. The political situation in the Crimea changed drastically several times in the course of the three years Yakov lived in Yalta. In March 1918, the Soviet Tauride Republic was formed. Toward the beginning of May, the Crimea was seized by German troops. On 23 February 1919, father wrote to his relatives from German-occupied Crimea: I am alive and well. I'm not flourishing, but I'm not stagnating either. Actu ally, I'm not engaged in much of anything. I have a chance to play the vio lin, and I take zealous advantage of this opportunity lately. At the university, an ill-repute pursues me?as regards politics. I am the youngest, and the most Red. My relationships with my colleagues are, in gen eral, good. With the students, also. The students are somewhat afraid of me since I have a reputation for being a stern examiner. It seems to me, however, that such an opinion is doubtless unjust. The weather is marvellous in Yalta. It's warm. The sun is bright and the sky is azure blue. In Simferopol, it is cold and dirty. In general, Simferopol is a repulsive little town, and I think about the upcoming move of the Univer sity to Sevastopol with pleasure. I very much like Sevastopol?in every way. However, I don't know whether I will stay with Tauride University, even if it moves to Sevastopol. But in our times it is better not to write about the future. When my friends come, then we will have a future, but in the mean time we don't have one. Nevertheless, I will not turn to politics, although it seems that there is nothing left for me besides political topics. On 5 April 1919, the Red Army entered the Crimea. On April 11, Sim feropol was taken and Soviet power was again established in the Crimea. Yakov Ilich began to work in the Crimean People's Commissariat of Edu cation and was put in charge of questions relating to higher and middle technical education (he was called "Vice-Director of the Crimean People's Commissariate for Education" or "Head of the Division of Professional Technical Education"). At the same time, he worked for the newspaper Red Crimea and became a member of its editorial board. In pursuit of his job and his interests, father journeyed to Theodosia, to Koktebel, and to one of the best Russian poets, M. Voloshin; he knew his poems well and remembered them by heart. At that time, the university library was being enriched by donations from private collections. Having</page><page sequence="8">204 FRENKEL found out that there was a large library in Voloshin's home, Yakov Ilich undertook persuading him to present the university with some part of it. Voloshin received him very amiably. Yakov Ilich was surprised by his appearance (Voloshin wore a band on his head that drew up his long, shoulder-length hair, and a tunic made from coarse cloth), but he did not give the books! In August, 1919, Denikin's troops arrived in the Crimea and Yakov Ilich was soon arrested and put in jail. Here is the only letter preserved from there, which is addressed to his mother. The letter is dated "August."8 Notwithstanding the calming news from you, I cannot believe in my rapid emancipation. I would want only that you?all of you?be less distressed about me, and would not raise so much of a fuss on my account. I feel superb, and I cannot complain about anything. I am not pining in the least; rather I am occupied with readings of Drude and Grave.9 I began to write my article; now I am biding my time until I receive my lectures, which they have not given me yet. I lose at chess to Rabinovich and Krasnoperov?on the chess set that I made myself [they were locked in the same cell with father]. This pastime is forbidden within the walls of the prison, and the day before yesterday in the evening, the Deputy Warden, having inspected the cell in a drunken state, took our "board" from us, in place of which we made another. We usually converse about political and personal topics. And so, I repeat, I am absolutely not bored. Optimism and a philosophical bent, about which I have already written, save me from anguish. If one doesn't give oneself up to thoughts about what could be, if only, and so on, which I try not to do, then it's just like living in clover, like being in a sanitorium. The whole difference is that in a sanitorium there are usually rooms that lock from the inside, and in prison, the cells lock from the outside. After two months in detention, Yakov Ilich was out on probation, suspended from his teaching activities. Thanks to the efforts of N.M. Krylov, however, he returned to giving lectures at the university in half a year. And to listening to them:10 Simferopol, April 24, 1920. Today at 7 I set off together with Mikhail Liud vigovich [Frank, a professor of mathematics] for a talk by Professor V.I. Ver nadskii, "On the role of life processes in the study of the chemistry of the earth's crust." His lecture was interesting by virtue of its basic ideas, elegant of form, but too verbose. And it was hard for me to listen attentively, since his thoughts, which he had not sufficiently framed, wandered. I thought about 8. Ibid., 28. 9. Apparently, P. Drude's course Optics and D.A. Grave's Elements of higher algebra. 10. Cf. Frenkel (ref. 1), 31.</page><page sequence="9">YAKOV FRENKEL 205 Serenkii,11 I thought about those eight unhappy youths who were hung today at Station Square for membership in the Union of Communist Youth. What times these are! In truth?o tempora, o mores}1 In the beginning of November, the Red Army approached the Crimea. On the 11th, Perekop fortifications were broken through, on the 14th, Sim feropol was freed. As early as the 16th, the Department of People's Educa tion was established under the auspices of the Crimean Revolutionary Com mittee and soon the paper Red Crimea would renew publication. Yakov Ilich returned to his former duties in these organizations. The duties carried a protective order: Commissariat of the People's Education November 30, 1920, No. 471 Sim feropol Protective Order. This document certifies that the Frenkel apartment in building No. 3 on Miliutinskaia Street in Yalta is occupied by the family of comrade Yakov Ilich Frenkl, a member of the Board of the Crimean Divi sion of the People's Education, a member of the editorial board of "Red Crimea," and a professor of Tauride University, and therefore, the designated apartment, as well as the possessions found therein, shall not be subject to requisition. Chair of the Crimean People's Education, P. Novitskii. Among the first lines from the North received by Yakov Ilich in 1920 was the information that he had been elected in absentia to work at the State X-Ray and Radiology Institute established in Petersburg at the end of 1918. The famous Institute of Physics and Technology, in which Frenkel worked from 1921 to the end of this life, grew out of the Physics and Tech nology Department at this institute, which was chaired by A.F. Ioffe. Yakov Ilich travelled from the Crimea to Moscow on 5 January 1921, but not alone. He took Sarra Frenkel (nee Gordina) with him, whom he married on the eve of 1921. Some thirty years later, on 7 August 1949, father wrote to my brother and me:13 Yesterday, your mother and I celebrated the thirtieth year of our acquain tanceship. In truth, our acquaintanceship was fleeting; it was limited to one evening, spent by me at mother's dacha, after which I returned to Yalta and was flung by the Whites into jail. Then a whole year passed, in the course of 11. Sergei Frenkel entered the freshman class of the Department of Physics and Mathemat ics at Tauride University. Keeping him from being conscripted into Denikin's "Volunteer" Army, Yakov Ilich (in the course of extraordinarily interesting adventures) was able to get him into the brigade that guarded the Yalta electrical power station. In 1920, S.I. Frenkel died from a wayward bullet shot by one of the soldiers of this brigade. Yakov Ilich dedicated the first ed ition of his two-volume Electrodynamics to the memory of Sergei Frenkel. 12. Ya.I.

Cf. Frenkel (ref. 1), 36.</page><page sequence="10">206 FRENKEL which Mama hardly recalled my existence, after which we again met, at that same dacha in Miskhor, where Mama soon flung me into prison for life. At the time of marriage, our future mother was a youngish, 19-year-old student at the Biology Department of Tauride University. Later she changed her profession. Knowing to perfection three European languages, she became a scientific-technical translator and worked in the Publishing House of the Academy of Sciences. Recalling her, Academician I.E. Tamm, father's close friend, wrote in 1962: "A very intelligent, sensitive, and responsive women, Sarra Isaakovna played a large and beneficial role in the life of Yakov Ilich."14 She outlived father by almost eight years. After his death, she took a most active part in preparing the three-volume collection of his works for publication. This publication was sponsored by the Academy of Sciences. The memorandum to Lenin On a Sunday morning in the spring of 1946, father and I walked to the Park of the Academy of Forest Technology. I spied a man walking toward us, and soon recognized him to be the mathematician, Vladimir Ivanovich Smirnov. Father also recognized him, and, completely unexpectedly, hav ing taken me by the hand, he pulled me off to the side. This very much surprised me: I had he^ard so many good things about Vladimir Ivanovich? and from Yakov Ilich himself. But we had not succeeded in completing this manuever when Vladimir Ivanovich noticed father and, having waved his hand in greeting, called to him. They met and talked a little (I remember that Vladimir Ivanovich advised father not to miss the concert at the philharmonic?there was to be a performance of one of Bruckner's sym phonies). They said good-bye very heartily and even kissed each other. When we had distanced ourselves a little, I asked father why he wanted to avoid a meeting with Smirnov. Father answered that in the years of the Civil War, he and Smirnov had lived for a long time side by side in Sim feropol and had worked together in the University. Later I read in father's letters from Simferopol:15 24 April 1920. Our new comrade, Smirnov, is a very capable mathematician and an extraordinarily nice person. 1 May 1920. Yesterday evening, having yielded to the Smirnovs' insistence, and in part to my own leanings, I bought a pound of salted khamsa [a small 14. Ibid. 15. Ibid., 31.</page><page sequence="11">YAKOV FRENKEL 207 fish native to the Black Sea] at the market, and today I added another 1/2 pound. Khamsa is superb; it goes down like herring. In the absence, or rather due to the lack of knives, forks, plates, I get by, tearing the khamsa with my fingers and teeth. As for Smirnov, he, in the capacity of a specialist and conoisseur, sips it with his tea, as a sugar substitute. "So, what's the matter?" I asked. "The matter is," he answered, "that in November 1920, when the Reds arrived in the Crimea, during the Terror, Vladimir Ivanovich's wife tragi cally perished. And I always fear that, meeting with me, he reminisces about the Crimea, and with the next associative step, about this horrible loss." In one of his letters father mentioned a memorandum describing the situation in the Crimea that he had passed on to V.I. Lenin. I searched out this memorandum in the Institute of Marx-Engels-Lenin (file 461/31286). Father's memorandum was anticipated by another note, written on a scrap of graph paper from a university notebook. It read:16 Vladimir Ilich, Professor Frenkel, having arrived from the Crimea... gave me this report (describing the situation in the Crimea), the first part of which does not concern me, which I told him. Then he began to beseech me to give it to you. I could not refuse. M. Pokrovskii. [M.I. Pokrovskii, a famous historian, was the Deputy Direc tor of the People's Commissariat of Education under Lunarcharskii.] Then came the memorandum The Political Situation I. The decree of the central authorities on the Crimean Terror is being carried out by the local organs (special departments and emergency teams) with fran tic zeal and unscrupulousness. This fanaticism transcends all limits and is turning the terror into brigandage, and into mass murder. Not only are those persons who had participated in the counterrevolution in some capacity being murdered, but also those persons who had absolutely no part in it. If in Sim feropol the banishment of suspect elements to the north is practiced (in extremely limited measures), then in the uezds, especially on the south shore of the Crimea, the arrested are either set free or executed. In Yalta, for exam ple, two special departments (that of the Black and the Azov seas and that of the 46th departments) and two emergency teams are operating, and in some three to four weeks they have executed a minimum of 700 people (and more likely 2000); among the executed, besides those formerly serving in Vrangel's 16. Ibid., 39.</page><page sequence="12">208 FRENKEL army (not only officers and soldiers), the majority of the persons executed were from the bourgeoisie, and especially from the democratic intelligentsia, who had sought refuge in the Crimea, for the most part, from hunger (the representatives of the established bourgeoisie, who had run from the Soviet authority, had opportunely left across the border). The massacre takes place purely on the basis of written forms, collected from the citizens who arrived in the Crimea after 1917, and almost always without any kind of oral interro gation or explanation. The officials of special departments and members of the emergency teams bathe in the wine that is so plentiful on the South Shore of the Crimea, and execute with a drunken hand, not even reading the submit ted forms (a fact which is expressly established and witnessed with respect to the leader of the Special Department of the Black and Azov Seas, Cherno gorov). Together with the inhabitants, who are entirely blameless with respect to politics, a multitude of specialists have perished?Soviet workers, organiz ers of cooperatives, doctors, and so on?persons who are knowingly sym pathetic to Soviet authority, who have harbored communists and have helped them during the reign of the White Guard. In all, about 30,000 people have been executed in the Crimea, and this number continues to grow daily. Thanks to the fact that the Crimean Revolutionary Committee and espe cially the Regional Committee took no measures to harness the special departments (for example, Bela Kun has declared that there "should be no mercy for any officer or bourgeois''), and thanks to the fact that the center has not paid enough attention to the Crimea?the Terror, or more exactly, the massacre, to this time has not shown any signs of weakening. Only more recently has the Krimechka appeared in Simferopol. It, however, has not yet replaced the special department of the Crimea, but has only supplemented it. The most fervent enemies of Soviet authority have, for the most part, left the Crimea. As the Terror continues, it turns neutral and even sympathetic people into its enemies and accordingly, it will not destroy, but on the con trary, it will sow the seeds of counterrevolution. The Terror must be stopped immediately, and the activity of the special departments must be investigated in order to punish the guilty. 2. Referring to the "directives from the center" (the existence of which is exceedingly doubtful), the Regional Committee has proceeded to banish from the Crimea to the center (or simply to the north) not only a group of Menshe viks who have recommended themselves by virtue of their selfless aid to the communists during the reign of the White Guard, and who had received more or less responsible posts in the Crimea, but they have also banished the newly converted Bolsheviks who have attempted to, in one way or another, protest against the excesses of the terror. Detecting an intolerable Menshevik orienta tion in these protests, the Regional Committee, as a measure of party disci pline, "instructs" the aforementioned comrades in the decrees of the central organs, and by so doing, it depopulates the Crimea, which without this is lacking in forces. This depopulation threatens the Crimea with the saddest consequences, since efforts to build Soviet society in this extremity, where there is almost no knowledge of Soviet authority, requires people, particularly</page><page sequence="13">YAKOV FRENKEL 209 experienced and honest ones. There are too few "orthodox" communists to satisfy these requirements and this is all the more reason why they should not be alienating the new converts or "Menshevik-types." Additionally, any negative opinion formed with regard to the Crimean Terror, as it took shape thanks to the connivance of the Regional Committee and their loose tie with the center, cannot under any circumstances serve as a basis for accusing any one of Menshevism. The Regional Committee must be accordingly exposed, and in general, tight control must be established over it. 3. In general, the center must pay attention to the Crimea if it proposes to convert it into an All-Union health resort in the near future. The food crisis in the Crimea is quickly and sharply being exacerbated, especially on the south shore, where Soviet civil servants are each given all of 1/4 pound of bread a day, and where means for feeding the rest of society lack any practical organ ization. The south shore must be disencumbered from the public that has arrived there. These people, in large part, are on their way to relocating in the north. Removing them will free the place for sick workers and Red Army soldiers who need to be sent to the south. If left to the special departments, this relo cation can hardly be conceived as realizable, no matter from what point of view. Experienced party workers who have the broadest possible investiture of power must be sent from the center to the south. Otherwise the "ortho dox" communists who are presently operating in the Crimea will turn it not into a health resort, but into a wilderness, bathed in blood. Professor Ya. Frenkel, 21 1 1921.17 Father's account is supported by V.V. Veresaev's novel, The dead end, based on Veresaev's sojourn in the Crimea from 1918 to 1920. Veresaev wrote18 And I asked him why those things I was forced to see in the Crimea had been done there, as I remember it, in 1920. After the battle fought on the Perekop isthmus, when the Reds captured the Crimea, it was announced as a point of general information that the proletariat was magnanimous, and that now, since the struggle had ended, the Whites were being presented with a choice: those who wanted could leave the RSFSR, and those who wanted could stay and work with the Soviet power. I rarely chanced to witness such a feeling of general relief as was demonstrated after this announcement. The young White officers were mostly students, and by no means of the Black Hundred. They were exhausted by the logic of things in their stuggle with the Bolshe viks. Beyond this struggle they were not able to glimpse the broadness of the people's mass of workers, and had long ago become bogged down in their role. They found themselves in desperate straits: they felt that they had taken 17. Ibid., 40^1. 18. V. Veresaev, The dead end. Sisters [B tupike.

And now suddenly this exit appeared, an exit to honest work and the home land. Soon after this, (all the officers were supposed to appear at a registration, and it was announced that those who did not appear at the registration would be found outside the1 bounds of the law and could be killed on the spot. The officers appeared at1 the re-registration. And then there began a senseless, bloody slaughter. All those who appeared were arrested, during the nights that followed they were led out of the city, and they were executed by machine gun there. Thousands of people were annihilated in this way. I asked Dzerzhinskii why this had been done? He answered: "You see, a great mistake was made here in the Crimea. The Crimea was the main nest of White Guard rule. In order to destroy this nest, we sent com rades there with absolutely exceptional plenary powers. But we could in no way think that they would use these plenary powers like that." I asked: "You have in mind Piatakov?" (Everyone knew that the so-called 'Piatakov's emergency team,' composed of Piatakov, Zemliachka and Bela Kun, stood at the head of this reprisal.) Dzerzhinksii evasively answered: "No, not Piatakov." He didn't say who, but from the lack of clarity in his answers I came to the conclusion that he had Bela Kun in mind. On his return to Petersburg at the end of January 1921, Yakov Ilich plunged headlong into scientific work (at the theoretical division of the Physics and Technological Institute) and pedagogical work (at the Polytechnical Institute). The 1920s were, I think, the happiest and most pro ductive years of his life. In this decade, he wrote nine books (three of which were published in Germany) and several dozen articles on a wide range of topics relating to modern theoretical physics. These books brought him fame in the USSR and beyond its borders. Frenkel became one of the first Soviet physicist-grantees of the Rockefeller Foundation,19 which afforded him the opportunity in 1925 and 1926 to work in the leading centers of physics in Europe?in Germany, England, and France. In 1929, the USSR Academy of Sciences elected him a corresponding member along with P.L. Kapitsa and N.N. Semenov. 19. Yakov Frenkel was awarded a one-year International Education Board Fellowship in 1925 to study physics with R.H. Fowler at Cambridge in England. Included in the fellowship was a grant to return to the USSR through Germany. The International Education Board was founded by John D. Rockefeller in 1923.</page><page sequence="15">YAKOV FRENKEL 211 3. THE THIRTIES Trip to the USA Yakov Ilich left on a business trip to the USA in September, 1930. He travelled through Germany to the French port of Cherbourg, and on 24 Sep tember he arrived in New York. On 2 October, he was in Minneapolis, the final destination of his journey. In literally half an hour after his arrival there, he started giving lectures at Minnesota University. From this time and until his departure from America (with his return home through Eng land, France, and Germany), father wrote home practically every week. In these letters are stories about people, primarily physicists, with whom his work brought him into contact. He wrote about the American way of life, the results of his scientific work, his lectures on wave mechanics, and his defense of the Soviet system. 12 October 1930. I often have to speak about Russia, for interest in Russia has grown. You know, from afar our success is felt even more deeply than it is up close, where at times it is overshadowed by our blunders and difficulties. I carry the banner of the Soviet person with pride. 24 October 1930. Recently a student newspaper ran an interview with me under the heading: "Frenkel sees Russian prosperity under Soviet rule." However, I will send the clipping. It goes without saying that some of my words were distorted. I did not talk at all about the restoration of Russia's "former power," but I did talk about the great future.20 18 November 1930. I just returned from the club where I gave my (n + 7)th talk on Russia (the nth I did this morning, and the (n-i)th on Saturday, that is, three days ago). Everything was extraordinarily successful. But these appear ances are beginning to wear me out.. .The growing interest of Americans in Russia, which it seems has seriously appeared for the first time only this year, is connected in great part with the present American crisis. Until now, this crisis had not so much hit the economic institutions of the Americans as it had their minds.21 26 November 1930. Today I had to deliver a talk about Russia again?for the seventh time!?in the local Optimist's Club, which unites various sorts of people with optimistic mindsets. In order to maintain a lively spirit after lunch, in which I took part, they sang chorus-like (all 80 of them) a few optimistic songs, after which they listened to my optimistic talk.22 20. Cf. Frenkel (ref. 1), 153. 21. Ibid., 156. 22. Ibid., 158.</page><page sequence="16">212 FRENKEL On 18 February 1931, in one of the Minneapolis newspapers, there appeared an article by some "crazy pastor" who demanded the expulsion of Frenkel from the USA for communist propaganda. The circle of people with whom Yakov Ilich kept company widened. It included American socialists, artists, and musicians. The US Secretary of State Stimson expressed his readiness to receive Frenkel. The meeting, it is true, never materialized because Yakov Ilich received permission for it only on the eve of his departure. Frenkel's acquaintance with one of the leaders of the English Labor Party, Harold Laski, had a profound effect on him. Laski was a professor on the faculty of political economics at London School of Economics.23 2 April 1931. Laski is a socialist of an extraordinarily moderate type. Nevertheless, he views the Russian Revolution as the greatest event "after the birth of Christ;" he is afraid of the possibility of war in Europe, which he thinks would be mainly directed against Russia. Attacked by Marxist philosophers A few major scientists joined the group of anti-quantum specialists and anti-relativists. These scientists sincerely believed that everything outside the framework of classical physics came from the Evil One. Chief among them was the highly visible electrical engineer and academician, V.F. Mitkevich, the physicists N.P. Kasterin and A.K. Timiriazev (the "son of the memorial," as a few of his opponents ironicially called him, having in mind the great memorial to his father, K.A. Timiriazev, at Nikitin's Gates in Moscow), and a few of their students. The Marxist-philosophers, as they called themselves, travelled with them. The most important of these were M.B. Mitin and A.A. Maksimov. The polemic between the two scientific camps unfolded on the pages of Under the Marxist banner [Pod znamenem marksizma], which was later renamed Philosophical questions [Voprosy filisofii], a "philosopical and social-economic journal." Articles appeared in popular scientific journals also, and in the central newspapers. Maksimov attacked father and his defender A.F. Ioffe in "Under the Marxist banner."24 23. Ibid., 176. 24. A.A. Maksimov, "On physical idealism and its defense by academician A.F. Ioffe" [O fizicheskom idealizme i zashchite ego akad. A.F.

Frenkel delivered a series of candidly idealistic assertions. These assertions were made so aggressively and were, at the same time, so contrary to the views of the communists participating in the conference, that it was decided to call a subcommittee meeting of the VKP(b)25 to discuss his talk. In order to confirm Ya.I. Frenkel's original views on philosophy and his position on dialectical materialism, he was invited to the subcommittee meet ing. At the subcommittee meeting, he offered an elucidation that left no shred of a doubt as to Ya.I. Frenkel's position on the question of dialectical materi alism. ... You, Academician A.F. Ioffe, are pleased to raise all the idealistic chatter of Ya.I. Frenkel to the status of natural law [he has in mind here Frenkel's book Wave mechanics], and to make ironical remarks about those who do not do this. However, it would be better if you, Academician Ioffe, had pondered whether it is permissible for a man who lays claim to a leading role in Soviet physics to declare his Machist fabrications to be a law of nature. Instead of being grieved on account of such a sad situation, Academician A.F. Ioffe not only speaks ironically, not only declares this idealistic verbiage a "law of nature," but declares Frenkel himself to be a materialist, and quantum mechanics in Frenkel's treatment, and in the treatment of Tamm and other Menshevist idealists, to be a concretization of dialectical materialism. Father's remarks that provoked Maksimov may be gathered from a stenographic record of the party group meeting at the Third Physical Chem istry Conference in Maksimov's papers in the Archive of the Soviet Academy of Sciences in Moscow. According to this stenogram, Ya.I. Frenkel was invited to the party group meeting after delivering his paper (which was not included in the published materials of the conference). Here is the record:26 Excerpt from the protocol of the subcommittee meeting of the VKP(b) of the Third All-Union Conference on Physical Chemistry. On 1931, November 14th, Leningrad, Technological Institute. Entertained: the statement of com rade Frenkel at the subcommittee meeting of the VKP(b). Frenkel: With great readiness I speak before this conference, but not in order to take my objections back?I do not rescind them. Shevtsov: I don't know how one can separate questions of methodology from questions of politics, after all Filipp Frank considers you a Machist. Frenkel: I am not interested in Frank. I consider his philosophical works to be very superficial. Frank knows me by my works in physics, and I am interested in gnosiological questions. I find that the theory of dialectical materialism is not the crowning achievement of human thought, it cannot satisfy a thinking humankind. Independent of how necessary it is as the foun dation of socialism. The dialectical method has no right to claim a leading 25. Ail-Union Communist Party (of Bolsheviks) 26. Cf. Frenkel (ref. 1), 226-227.</page><page sequence="18">FRENKEL role in science. The relation between philosophy and science is the same as that between being and consciousness. I consider that our politics goes to an impossibly harmful extreme when our scientists and our youth are forced to subscribe to the views of dialectical materialism. This does not mean that I negate any of the truth of dialectical materialism. Balezin [the chemist who presided]: Of what sort is your philosophy? Frenkel: I am not at all a novice with respect to philosophy. What I have read in Lenin and Engels cannot replace my gnosiological views. This is my opinion, and I do not recant it. I consider it my duty to neutralize the harmful effect which my paper produced, but I by no means deny my views. Balezin: Can we conclude from your findings that dialectical materialism is a hindrance to the development of science, and in particular to the natural sci ences? Frenkel: Yes, it is a hindrance, at least in the form in which it is now dog matically taught. The dialectic method, which you force upon natural science, is the dialectic of Hegel, and it is not necessary for physics. Kedrov: Your paper goes contrary to all the positions of the Party, to all the decisions of the most recent scientific conferences. How can your views on philosophy be combined with your political views? Frenkel: My views are an unbiased analysis of objective facts, and not the preconceived opinion with which you?the dialecticians?approach every phenomenon. You place the equals sign between antidialectical opinion and anti-Soviet attitudes. I am devoted to Soviet power, but I do not acknowledge dialectical materialism. You place the equals sign, and by this you allow the crudest political mistake. The position of the Party with respect to the role and significance of dialectical materialism is not necessary for me and my scientific activity. Therefore, I am not a member of the Party. I do not con sider it necessary to swim with the current and say one thing, but think another, as some do. I consider your politics erroneous. Only I alone, like a friend of the Party, state candidly that I do not acknowledge dialectical materialism, and many specialists fear to say this and formally vote for your propositions. I think, I hope, that the leadership of your Party will soon res cind its views on the prevalent meaning of dialectical materialism. Shevtsov: For us, Marx, Engels, and Lenin are the founders of the dialectical method in natural science. How do you feel about Engels and Lenin? Frenkel: I have by no means been enthusiastic about what I have read in Engels and Lenin. Neither Lenin nor Engels are authorities for physicists. Lenin's book is a model of fine analysis, but it reduces to the assertion of truisms that, which are not worth breaking a lance over. You place yourself in a false position with Lenin; as soon as you leave Lenin, nothing else remains with you. Your philosophy is reactionary. I hope that soon the Party will be convinced of this (he refers, as an example of this, to comrade Bukha rin). I, personally, as a Soviet person, cannot find solidarity with an opinion harmful to science. There cannot be proletarian mathematics, proletarian phy sics, and so on. You are narrow, you have a leftist bent, and a child's disease. I, as an honest person, as a Soviet person, candidly declare this to you.</page><page sequence="19">YAKOV FRENKEL 215 Balezin: I think that the question is clear with exhausting completeness. We will no longer detain you, Professor Frenkel. The unpublished answer Maksimov's papers at the Soviet Academy of Sciences also contain a letter from father to the editorial board of Under the Marxist banner and an article addressed to Maksimov.27 To the Editors of the journal Under the Marxist banner. In enclosing my answer to A.A. Maksimov, I request it be printed as an article in your journal without any kind of changes which do not agree with my position. Likewise, please inform me of your consent or refusal to print my second article, which is dedicated to an exposition of my gnosiological views (this article has not yet been written). ... From the point of view of this criterion [the Leninist definition of materi alism as the acknowledgement of a real world independent of our conscious ness], I?like every physicist who has not lost possession of his faculties?am and always was a 100% materialist. As a matter of fact, a physicist, both as an experimentalist and a theoretician is occupied with experimental study and theoretical interpretations of phenomena which occur in the surrounding environment, and as such cannot help but be a materialist. At worst, he is an "elemental," unconscious materialist. Maksimov writes in his article that "reactionary philosophical views, as a rule, go together with politically reactionary tendencies." I hope that this rule does not apply to him himself. I will not take upon myself the daring to apply this rule to the group defended by him?the "the group who thinks differently." I consider it my duty, however, to note that this group, by virtue of its views, is amazingly similar to the group of reactionary German physi cists headed by Professor Stark. Stark, being invested by the fascist party for deliberation of issues in physics, declares the theory of relativity to be a Jew ish invention, and he labels one of the creators of quantum mechanics, Heisenberg, with the name "weisse Jude." Like their ideological parents, who considered the "yids" the main perpetrators of the impending revolution in physics, modern German fascists consider the revolution that started in physics forty years ago, and that continues to the present day, to be the result of Jewish intrigues, both within and without Germany. In their treatment of modern physics, Mitkevich, Timiriazev, Kasterin, and together with them, Maksimov, differ from Stark, Leonard, Herke, and other representatives of German obscurantism only in that they replace the term "Jewish" by the term "idealistic." As concerns myself, Ioffe, and a number of other physicists whom Maksi mov is inclined to suspect of counterrevolutionary activities in the form of 27. Ibid., 230.</page><page sequence="20">216 FRENKEL "pseudo-idealistic" views?this rule put forth by him should rather testify to the contrary (although, of course, each rule has its exceptions). In part, I hope that citizen Maksimov did not have in mind to accuse me personally of politi cal reactionism. Otherwise I will be forced to take him to court to ensure that he bears judicial responsibility for his scurrilous libel. The editors of Under the Marxist banner refused to publish Frenkel's answer. Nonetheless it received responses, for example, Maksimov's notes on the manuscript, which now can only call forth disbelief and laughter, and several unpublished articles in one of Frenkel's personal files in the Archive of the Soviet Academy of Sciences. In one of these we read:28 19 May 1939. He [Frenkel] is known to me as an essentially anti-Soviet per son, and as one taking hostile ideological positions. Comrade Maksimov, a co-worker at the Philosophical Institute of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, and Comrade Divil'kovskii [a member of VKP(b)], the former Science Secre tary of the physics group, should know him well. Maksimov surely has the stenographic materials that characterize his ideological positions. I know that, in a personal conversation with Divil'kovskii [as retold by Divil'kovskii], Frenkel stated that dialectical materialism is sleight-of-hand, that Lenin promulgated a mistake in his study of dialectical materialism. He said that they fill the minds of young people with it in vain, that it is time, you see, to give up such a fashion and similar fashions, and so on, and so forth. He surrounds himself with his favorites, "geniuses," dubious people. It is impossible to point to any communists that would have been trained by him. This story helped me to understand the absence of father's signature on petitions to appeal the arrests of physicist-colleagues like M.P. Bronstein, Iu.A. Krutkov, P.I. Lukirskii, and V.K. Frederiks. The explanation, given me by Professor D.D. Ivanenko, is that although Yakov Ilich was the first to rush and gather signatures on such letters, sparing neither time nor energy, his signature on such a document would only diminish its chances of success.29 Father's reputation among physicists close to the Marxist philosophers was no higher than it was in Maksimov's group. On 12 June 1938 an arti cle, "For the vanguard of science," by B.M. Vul (who afterwards became an academician) and M. Divil'kovskii appeared in the Central Party's Pravda. Here is what it says about father: The antiscientific, idealistic aims of these [theoretical] physicists is rather sharply expressed in the written works and addresses given by corresponding member of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, Frenkel. The servile repetition of 28. Ibid., 231. 29. Ibid., 231.</page><page sequence="21">YAKOV FRENKEL 217 idealistic nonsense concerning the absence of causal ties in atomic phenomena, concerning the "freedom of will" (for separate particles), con cerning the existence of an electromagnetic field without a material carrier, that is, movement without matter, characterizes the "philosophical depth" of this scientist's works. From this proceed his reactionary views on the interre lation of politics and philosophy, and on dialectical materialism. Professor Frenkel, of course, does not allow himself openly or clearly to call himself an idealist. He tries to pass off his reactionary world view as materialism, but only "physical," and not dialectical. Academician Ioffe supports him, as well as Professors Tamm and Fok, and others who likewise bow before bourgeois idealistic wisdom. They propagandize these views among the youth, supple menting them in a series of instances with their more or less cloaked personal idealistic opinions. The article goes on to recommend the opinions of T.D. Lysenko and to condemn certain work being done in parallel at a few physics institutes. This comment refers to simultaneous research that was being conducted on the atomic nucleus in the Leningrad and Kharkov Institutes of Physics and Technology, and in the Leningrad Radium Institute. Work on our uranium project would scarcely have gone forward so perspicaciously had the leaders of these institutes?the academicians A.F. Ioffe, A.I. Leipunskii, and V.G. Khlopin?not permitted this duplication. B.M. Vul was not embar rassed to include this article in his bibliography published in 1984. Perhaps the old adage, "You can't unring a bell," governed his inclusion of it. 4. 1937 In 1937, I was 7 years old. I still remember the arrests that took place in Professor's Building #1 where we lived.30 The last name of the arrested was immediately stricken from the list of residents that hung at the entry way doors. The hunted looks on the faces of the small children come to mind?the children of the arrested, when in the morning after a nighttime arrest, they went out to the park?and waited with fear. Would yesterday's friends play with them?31 I was especially shaken by the arrest of a close friend of my parents, a remarkable Soviet physicist and person, Vsevolod Konstantinovich Frederiks, who lived in our building. There was no way that this kind man, whose face exuded nobility, could be a "people's enemy!" On my ques tioning, my parents explained that this was a misunderstanding which 30.

Frenkel (ref. 1), 300.</page><page sequence="22">218 FRENKEL would soon be dispelled. I remember father's conversation with Vsevolod Konstantinovich's mother-in-law, Sofia Vasilevna Shostakovich (the composer's mother). We met with her at the building's exit?father had taken me for a walk. He assured her that a number of physicists had prom ised to sign a letter defending Frederiks and said that it would be desirable to add to these signatures that of Dmitrii Dmitrievich Shostakovich.32 Frederiks' arrest led me to the simple conclusion that the well-being of every person, including my father, was threatened. This fear, and the fear for the life of my mother who was often ill, darkened my otherwise happy childhood in a safe and solid professor's family.33 A certain scene comes to mind. One winter evening, the whole family gathers for dinner. Suddenly, our maid34 runs into the dining room with a cry and quickly begins to say: "Yakov Ilich, they have come for you there?a police officer, and the maintenance man are calling for you, dress, run [it must be said that there were two entrances to our apartment?one from the kitchen and the front door from the entry way], run, you are dear to us, we will not give you up." I will not attempt to recreate what we all felt. Father stood from the table and set off for the back door. After a minute, he returned, smiling. It turned out that they were conducting a peculiar kind of dog registration, so the one guilty of causing the alarm was our glorious spaniel.35 Much later, already an adult, I asked the question: why did those physi cists who bravely stepped out against the representatives of the official phi losophy and against the party functionaries not suffer? What were the laws governing the sinister choice of victims? Did their worldwide reputation save them? Hardly?consider the cases of N.I. Vavilov, L.D. Landau, Iu.A. Krutkov, and many others. I remember how a long time ago one of our acquaintances put forth the following naive argument: Sergei Vavilov, Ioffe, Tamm, Frenkel openly stated their rejection of the official philosophy, that put them "as if in the palm of their hands"?and this openness saved them.36 It seems to me that for father, and for the people of his circle and way of thinking, all the things that happened in 1937-38?the scale of which remained unknown to them?were large fluctuations that would quickly resolve themselves into a forward and progressive motion. The arrest of N.I. Ezhov and his myrmidons, and the cessation of arrests of ordinary 32. Ibid. 33. Ibid., 301. 34.

As I recall, softened judg ments made the rounds: Stalin was good, but those around him from the [NKVD] People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs were criminal, thus echoing conversations heard in the pre-revolutionary years: "the tsar is good but his ministers are scoundrels."37 At about that time, or a little later, under the influence of didactic conversations in kindergarten about Lenin and Stalin, I came to a problem?which of them do I love most? Shchukin's brilliant acting in the famous film and its sequel produced by Romm tilted the scales in favor of Granddad Lenin.38 In general, I think that these films played a colossal role in building an attractive image of the leader?not only in the child's, but also in the adult's consciousness. At that time, no matter if it were Gelavan or Dikii who played Stalin, and no matter how much they desired to do a good job, in my opinion, it just didn't turn out. I asked father: "Can I tell the teacher that I like Lenin more than Stalin?" "You can," father answered, "but it's better not to."39 Thirty years later I had a notable conversation with my 5-year-old son. He had a slightly guilty expression when I went to wish him good night. "I think you want to tell me something?" I asked. "Yes, papa. I wanted to tell you that I love you very much, but that I love Lenin more." Kinder garten education had not changed much.40 5. THE WAR YEARS War work Immediately after the Great Fatherland War broke out in June 1941, Yakov Ilich went to the Vyborg Regional Military Committee to apply for entry into the volunteer force. According to my mother, the Committee told him that the army was not the place for scientists; they would do their country a greater good by remaining in their positions. A.F. Ioffe, N.N. Semenov, A.I. Alikhanov, and several other Leningrad physicists and chemists served on military-scientific commissions under the auspices of the party's Civil Committee. A rough agenda listing priority work apparently existed. In the beginning of August, I dropped in on father at work (the Institute of Physics and Technology was a five-minute walk from our house). He showed me some defense work underway in one of the 37. Ibid. 38. Ibid. 39. Ibid. 40. Ibid., 302-303.</page><page sequence="24">220 FRENKEL laboratories, a finely calibrated rifle mounted on a stand of rough boards. Father asked his associate at the institute (the now Professor M.I. Kornfeld) to demonstrate. Mark Iosovich set up a disk of rubber about 3 mm in diameter as a target, loaded the weapon, and fired. The bullet had left no hole. When a piece of laundry soap was used as a target, however, the bul let made a huge hole, three to four times its diameter. The point, father explained, was to devise a self-sealing cover for airplane fuel tanks. At the same time, Yakov Ilich studied much more serious problems. He helped design a radar system. In 1965, Professor M.S. Sliozberg told me that as early as 1939 father proposed a radar project for the detection of air planes (from the mid-1930s, D.A. Rozhanskii and Iu.B. Kobzarev, father's close colleagues, had studied these questions at the Institute of Physics and Technology). In the beginning of October 1941, father was summoned to the State Committee on Defense in Moscow to report on his radar work. S.E. Khaikin was present. According to him, father presented a complete electrodynamic account of his system for the distant detection of airplanes. But the project died out, mainly because of successful developments in the field of pulse radar.41 From the beginning of 1942, father gave himself wholly over to work on a book entitled The kinetic theory of liquids [Kineticheskaia teoriia zhid kostei], which summed up his many years of work in the field. He wrote much of it in the small laundry room of our apartment manager, which was situated in the courtyard. A sheet of plywood served as his desk; one side of it rested on his knees, the other on the sill of a narrow window. All these inconveniences were compensated by complete silence, which was very important for father. No one bothered him. He worked without any books or journals: his professional memory was remarkable. But, of course, he had made some preliminary notes in the good libraries at Kazan and Len ingrad. Father wrote his book almost simultaneously in English and in Russian. He finished it in 1944. The timing made it difficult to send the manuscript to Oxford University Press. The problem was solved by the father of a young, unusually talented theoretical physicist, N.S. Krylov, who had worked intensively with my father in Kazan. Krylov's father was a diplomat. He secured permission from the then Minister of Foreign Affairs, V.M. Molotov, to send the manuscript to England with the diplomatic mail. Eventually the book appeared three times in the USSR (the third time in 1975, in the series Classics of science), twice in England, twice in the USA, and once in West Germany. In 1947, father received the Stalin Prize, First Class, for it. 41.

My excuse for this is as follows: I knew that after our victory over the enemy became ensured, it would be expedient to return to those problems that garner importance both before and after a war. Recalling the spiritual state and foreign conditions in which this work was carried out, I would like to express my debt of deepest gratitude to my fellow countrymen and women who in the ranks of the Red Army fought heroically and victoriously against the fascist barbarians for the salvation of our life and civilization. Radar and writing did not comprise all of father's wartime work. In the Archive of the Institute of Physics and Technology is an account by him of the shielding of tanks. The goal of the work was to divert incoming shells from their course, to cause them to knock harmlessly against the tank. The Institute of Physics and Technology acquired a tank, and equipped its turrets and its front hull with a system of impeding screens. Marshall Konev's troops devised a similar system in the heat of battle. During the battle for Berlin, his men shielded their tanks from panzerfaust fire by cov ering them with tin or iron sheets. The panzerfausts simply ricocheted off this improvised shield.42 Father's two papers on this subject mathematically deduce the optimal dimensions of the deflecting system and examine scattering statistics for a given resistant media. Father often travelled to Sverdlovsk, to the Ural branch of the Academy of Sciences, where in the Physics Institute he discussed Ural defense plant work and the military meteorological service stationed there. As a result of his studies of geophysics, meteorology, and atmospheric electricity, he became a permanent member of the Main Geophysical Observatory in Len ingrad dedicated to the memory of A.I. Voeikov. He wrote a monograph on atmospheric electricity.43 In the very worst winter of 1941, before our counterattack at Moscow, probably sometime in November, the Frumkins came to visit us. Academi cian A.N. Frumkin, a physical chemist, was then engaged in problems hav ing to do with anti-chemical warfare [PVKhO]. We lived in two small, adjoining rooms, and I was dining together with the guests. Father observed that the main danger facing us now were the German tanks. He informed Aleksander Naumovich that he was preparing to address the People's Defense Committee [Narkomat oborony] with the following proposition: Let each soldier who destroys a fascist tank receive a two or three month leave 42.

"They will immediately accuse you of a lack of patriotism, the more so as I know that this same system has already been adopted by the Germans." Father did not write that letter to Moscow. The jubilee of the Academy of Sciences At the war's end, the Academy decided to add to the general festivity a celebration of the 220th anniversary of its founding. It was a chance to renew contacts between scientists that had been broken off during the war, or, more precisely, during the late 1930s. In June 1945, dozens of scientists from countries all around the world assembled in Moscow for the jubilee session of the Academy. Later, its participants arrived in Leningrad. Father announced that the Joliot-Curies and Pierre Auger would be our guests. Our living-dining room was readied for their reception. From its large, open windows the newly green park was visible. But mother had planted radishes, dill, and other greens in the window boxes. She asked father if this prosaic detail would not violate the celebratory reception. "Of course not," father said. "These are simple, kind people!" He knew them from his trips to France in 1926, 1927, and 1931, and from their visits to Len ingrad in the prewar years in 1933 and 1936. He then told me that Joliot had put the gold Nobel medals that he and his wife had received for the discovery of artificial radioactivity in solution to save them from possible requisition, and that they had stood out the war in a jar on the shelf with the other chemical preparations in their laboratory. Irene Curie took ill and did not come, but Joliot and Auger arrived on time. Joliot seemed to me a beautiful person with elegant and simple manners. The conversation, as they later told me, touched on the past war, which had opened up vistas for a peaceful life and pjoetry. Both guests were experts on French poetry, which my family also knew well. Auger had with him a small volume of verse which he presented to us as a keep sake of our meeting. Joliot expressed his regret that his wife had missed so delicious a dinner. Mother put together a package for her with all kinds of delicacies. Professor Auger said that as he would soon be in Paris where food was short, he would be very grateful to Madame Frenkel if she would make up a small package for his family, too. Mother fulfilled his request with pleasure. There had been no reason to worry that her window box would offend her guests.</page><page sequence="27">YAKOV FRENKEL 223 6. THE HOUSE OF SCHOLARS IN LESNOI WOOD Immediately at the conclusion of the war, on the initiative of the citizens of Leningrad, a movement arose having as its motto, "Scientists? to the production lines." Father was included in this process as a consul tant. At this time he chaired the House of Scholars Soviet on Lesnoi Pros pect, and it was there that consultations took place. He took great interest in this wide-ranging work. For example, he proposed a leg prothesis with a bending knee joint for amputations above the knee to the institute that manufactured protheses. When the healthy leg touched the ground, a rela tively small electric battery kicked into the circuit. At this point, the prothesis bent a little so as to ease the invalid's movement. He developed an elegant model and theory for a "paper-rolling mill." And he explored the possibility of replacing the standard bearings in series of mechanisms with "droplet-bearings:" drops made of several kinds of fluids and flattened under the force of friction.44 Shortly before father's death, in the autumn of 1951, a group of engineers from the Metal Plant came to see him at home on behalf of the Department of Water Turbines. They talked about the erosion of turbine blade surfaces. Father explained that this erosion resulted from electrical arcing across the air within the liquid's micro-bubbles as these bubbles formed during cavitation. Again in the late autumn of 1951, a commanding-looking deputation of officers came to our home from the Air Force Academy named in honor of Mozhaiskii. The consultation touched on generators and motors used on aircraft. Father had a long history of col laboration with the Air Force. In the mid-1940s, on the basis of his con sulting activity with the All-Union Institute of Aviation Materials [Vsesoiuznyi institut aviatsionnykh materialov], he had founded a new laboratory and become its permanent scientific director. The laboratory stu died friction and lubrication and other problems of applied molecular phy sics. Father's activity and that of his closest associates in the laboratory of the All-Union Institute of Aviation Materials resulted in the publication of about twenty articles printed during the years 1945-1951. As Chairman of the Soviet for the House of Scholars, he was responsi ble for its cultural program. One evening in 1945, the writers M.M. Zosh chenko and A.A. Akhmatova read their work. The atmosphere in the House's small concert hall was cozy and celebratory. Unfortunately, after Zoshchenko had read one of his funny and sad stories, a question rang out in the hall: "Hey, comrade Zoshchenko, I look at your heroes and I wonder, how could we have won a victory in the Great Fatherland War?" 44. Cf. Frenkel (ref. 1), 278-279.</page><page sequence="28">224 FRENKEL A tense silence fell in the hall. Finally Zoshchenko answered: "And then I look at you." The answer was met with applause. The authorities demanded an explanation from father. Why were Zoshchenko and Akhma tova invited to the evening meeting at the House of Scholars? He answered: because they are the greatest writers in Leningrad. 7. SUSTAINED ATTACK In the autumn of 1947, I entered the Department of Physics and Mechanics at the Polytechnical Institute. After classes had begun, they dis tributed forms to the first year students. Filling it out, I wrote on the line describing the type of your parents' work: Father?an instructor at an insti tution of higher education; mother?a scientific-technical translator. Some time passed. Then one day I found posted outside the Dean's Office a list of students from our department who had been transferred to other faculties by order of the Director of the Polytechnical Institute. Apparently only students who had been in occupied territory during the war, or were of Jewish descent were affected. I appeared on the list. I told father. He visited the dean. Then he asked me: "What did you write there about my work?" I answered. Sadly smiling, father said: "You suffered because of your own humility. If you had written that I was a professor of the Physics and Mathematics Faculty, there would have been no misunder standing. However, everything has been fixed for you." Alas, for others, everything had not been fixed. Father helped get a few of those who turned to him into their second-choice department, but he could not correct the entire situation. I think that he had not come up against planned, institutional antisemi tism before. Anti-semitism intensified in the late 1940s and early 1950s and dealt a heavy blow to the belief system that had shaped father from his youth. Protecting us, he did not discuss this question at home, but I am sure that the subsequent turn of events?not only the antisemitism, but the attack on the intelligentsia and culture, the August session of the Ail-Union Academy of Agricultural Sciences named in honor of Lenin [VASKhNIL], the resolution on music, the "Critics-Cosmopolitans" Affair, and the per secution of "physicists-idealists"?broke his health.45 Censorship In 1965, I practiced self-censorship while I wrote a book about father. After a few corrections to which I agreed, the manuscript went to the 45. Ibid., 261-270, 283-286, 310.</page><page sequence="29">YAKOV FRENKEL 225 typesetter. At the end of 1965, I received the galley proofs. Soon after ward, they summoned me to the publishers and suggested that several pages concerning the events of 1947-1951 be removed from the text. Either I could agree with the proposed cut, or all of the book would go through a new round of internal review. "Believe us," they told me, "then even more text will be cut from it, if it remains intact at all." This warning had its effect. I considered that I had not written the book for the sake of these pages alone. I agreed. They reset the end of the book. It appeared in 1966. Here are the omitted pages, which in 1966, at the "dawn of the stagna tion" were considered seditious: Physicists the world over are delighted by the scientific achievements of Niels Bohr. Is there anything more absurd than to assert on this basis that they grovel before Danish physics? Is there at least one soundminded physicist who will blindly praise (or curse) this or that work, solely because it was executed and published in Denmark, Germany, the Soviet Union, or the United States of America? Of course not. These elementary truths were consigned to oblivion at the end of the 40's. Just then the word "groveller" flit over the pages of many of our newspapers and journals. Major scientists suffered unfounded criticism, and in essence, crude attacks. An objective evaluation of the contribution of foreign scien tists in the development of modern physics was often considered a feature of cosmopolitanism. Academician Semenov, for example, was accused of grov eling, based upon the fact that he dedicated his book on chain reactions to the memory of Svante Arrhenius and Van't Hoff. Acknowledgment of the works produced by several Soviet theoretical physicists on the part of the most significant physicists in the West was considered symptomatic of the ideolog ical depravity of these works. Yakov Ilich Frenkel was a "wonderful object" to which the label? "groveller before Western science"?might be attached. Naturally, his arti cles were published not only in the USSR, but in Germany, England, Amer ica, and France. His Wave mechanics and Electrodynamics [Elektrodinamika] appeared only abroad. For Yakov Ilich's more zealous critics, the cause for this is completely clear. The publication of these two books and other books and articles of his in Germany and England is testimony to the fact that Frenkel "hastens to help Americans take advantage of the achievements of Soviet science to further the interests of monopolistic capital"?not more, not less! This phrase is taken from an article by the former instructor of the Len ingrad Poly technical Institute M. Kuz'min, which was published in the jour nal News of higher educational institutions.46 It has by no means been taken out of context, but completely answers to the content and spirit of the entirety 46. News of higher educational institutions [Vestnik vysshei shkoly] (Moscow, 1948), No. 2, 4.</page><page sequence="30">226 FRENKEL of this libelous article. When Professor V.F. Kagan, who in the 20's headed the Scientific Divi sion of the State Publishing House, found out about the accusations that were brought against Frenkel, he sent him a certificate with the following state ment: "By this I certify that Ya.I. Frenkel came to the Scientific Division of State Publishing House in the 20's with his two books Electrodynamics and Wave mechanics. The division was forced to decline this offer since its publi cation capacity at that time was limited and it had instructions to publish only books that might serve as textbooks in higher educational institutions." The certificate could hardly have helped Frenkel at that time: it is kept in Yakov Ilich's archive as a distinctive witness of the events of those years. In his papers there is an answer to the article by Kuzmin, which is addressed to News of higher educational institutions (but not published on its pages), in which Frenkel unmasked the deceitfulness of the political accusations con tained in the article. These accusations were written in an inadmissibly fami liar tone.... I will continue my quotation from the lost text of my book:47 Yakov Ilich insisted that the publication of his books abroad, or anyone else's books for that matter, did not have anything to do with disparaging the achievements of Soviet physics. Indeed, none of his contemporaries had ever expressed such a thing. And he could not have expressed such a sentiment it was too obvious that advances were being made not only by Soviet physi cists, but by their foreign colleagues as well. The mutual respect for contri butions of scientists in various countries to the common treasure house of knowledge is one of the distinctive traits of the international character of sci ence. We will add that the publication of works by Soviet physicists in foreign journals in the 20's and the publication of Soviet physics journals in English and German in the 30's and the first half of the 40's in great part enabled international recognition of Soviet science (now all the leading phy sics journals of the Soviet Union are published abroad in English translation). At one meeting of the Soviet of the Polytechnical Institute, Yakov Ilich, brushing aside the absurd accusations of grovelling, wittily remarked on how one can refute the thesis that publication of books by Soviet authors abroad proves their "servility" to foreign science (and this thesis served as the refrain of all accusations brought against Yakov Ilich). If one were to take the position of formal logic, then fact testifies to the contrary. Those scien tists abroad are fawning in "servility" before the Soviet scientific community if their works are translated and published in the USSR. This conclusion is just about as absurd as the thesis that brought it about. It seems that it was precisely at this same conference that the following episode took place, as told by Yakov Ilich. One of those participating in the debate at the Soviet said roughly the following: "Professor Frenkel denies his 47. Cf. Frenkel (ref. 1), 262-263.</page><page sequence="31">YAKOV FRENKEL 227 grovelling before the West. But here is a characteristic fact: even his handkerchiefs are marked in Latin letters." How should one react to such "evidence?" Yakov Ilich got his handker chief and blew his nose?to the sympathetic laughter of that larger part of the Soviet which had not lost its sense of humor. Yet one more example characterizes the level of the criticism to which Yakov Ilich was subjected at the Polytechnical Institute. The director of that institute, K.N. Shmargunov, accused him of mocking the Soviet kolkhoz sys tem. He based this accusation on the fact that in his book Introduction to the theory of metals [Vvedenie v teoriiu metalov], Yakov Ilich used a term that he proposed many years ago?4'collectivization of electrons." All of this would have been funny if it weren't so vile... The accusation of idealism was added to the accusation of groveling. These accusations did not contain anything new compared with those which were put forth at the end of the 30's. In the manuscript that probably served as the basis of Yakov Ilich's report at one of those meetings dedicated to the question of idealism in contemporary physics, he writes: "As a physicist, for whom the study of science is not an entertaining game, but a matter of honesty and duty, I never was, and never could be an idealist. The world around us, which is studied by physics, always seemed to me an objective reality, and not a trick of the mind. It is moreover a know able reality, and not a transcendental one. "Only very limited or very ignorant people can see an idealistic concept at the bottom of my Wave mechanics... These people are not capable of understanding the metaphorical expressions which I intended for more edu cated readers. Thus, for example, speaking about quantum statistics, I used such expressions as 'sympathy' to describe electrons having opposite spin, or 'antipathy' to describe electrons with identical spin, and this by no means because I am inclined to anthropomorphic representations, but on the con trary, because they are absolutely foreign to me, and, consequently, absolutely safe. People who can be seduced by similar anthropomorphic comparisons should not be advised to read serious books... "I personally do not consider it necessary to write my books in a clumsy style, carefully removing from them everything that might aid animation and better mastery of a topic that might otherwise seem dry. The right to use metaphors should not be the monopoly of poets; it should be available to scientists." Interrogation Yakov Ilich had been connected with the Polytechnical Institute from 1916, when he joined a seminar on the new physics given by A.I. Ioffe. On his return from the Crimea in the early spring of 1921, he started teaching at the Institute's Department of Physics and Mechanics. There he taught a number of major theoretical physicists. And there, in the late 1940s, an</page><page sequence="32">228 FRENKEL especially frenzied campaign was unleashed against him. In the winter of 1948, a representative of the Ministry of Higher Education, Docent P.E. Zrebnyi, inspected the Department of Theoretical Physics and interviewed its chairman Ya.I. Frenkel. Father literally boiled when he related his impression of this conversation. A stenographic record of this conversation was given to my brother, S.Ya Frenkel, some ten years ago by a friend who found it in Zrebnyi's papers. It begins:48 Stenogram of the conversation between the representative of the Ministry of Higher Education, Docent Zrebnyi, and the Chairman of the Department of Theoretical Physics at Leningrad Polytechnical Institute, the corresponding member of the USSR Academy of Sciences, Yakov Ilich Frenkel, on 1/7/1943. This conversation was conducted in the presence of the Party Committee Secretary of the Leningrad Polytechnical Institute, in the presence of a member of the VKP(b), the Vice Dean of the Department of Physics and Mechanics, and in the presence of a member of the VKP(b) who chairs the Department of Dialectical Materialism. The stenogram filled up 34 pages. The following are several excerpts from Zrebnyi's questions and Frenkel's answers, corrected for only the most obvious language errors.49 Zrebnyi: Your best works?what have they contributed to the socialist people's economy? Does your science accomplish things that are economic and realistic, and does it have direct benefits? I do not call attention here to the lecture course you give. This is a special article?about which we will speak later. Frenkel: Theoretical physics itself is further from industry than is experimen tal physics. However, theoretical physics is very relevant to metallurgy. I assert that the areas of physics that study these questions are useful for our industry. I can judge this, for instance, by the fact that many people turn to us for help... Theoretical physics is not directly connected with technology and industry. Zrebnyi: Does your theory of fluids in some way help the building of social ism? Frenkel: I think that it helps. If it were not so, then they would hardly have awarded me the Stalin Prize. Zrebnyi: How does your department handle ideological questions? How is the struggle to fulfull the directives of the TsK VKP(b)50 conducted when it comes to ideological questions?... In your course, how do you pose the ques tion of party spirit in science, and the questions of dialectical materialism? 48. Ibid., 262. 49. Ibid. 50. Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (of the Bolsheviks).</page><page sequence="33">YAKOV FRENKEL 229 Frenkel: The question of party spirit in science is not touched upon in my lectures. Philosophical questions are likewise not illuminated by physics. If issues of dialectical materialism are touched upon in my lectures, then it is in a fundamental way that is not determined by the opinions which constitute the essence of dialectical materialism. I do not think that a physical account of the questions of physics contradicts materialism. The students must be taught to think in the spirit of the principles of materialism, but dialectical philosophy itself should be developed on the basis of facts accumulated by the work of science. Zrebnyi: How do you cultivate Soviet patriotism in the students of your course? Frenkel: I emphasize the role of Russian scientists: Lebedev, Stoletov, not to mention Lomonosov. I also mention the new names?Petrov [who gave a course on electrodynamics]. I mention the name of Yablokov only briefly because his [work] is of a technical nature, my purpose is to explain the problems of theory. Zrebnyi: Philosophy is not isolated from physics, and frequently philosophers better understand issues in physics than the physicists themselves: let's take, for example, the classic works of Marxism. Frenkel: Allow me to have my own point of view. Here, Docent Zrebnyi asserted that among the concepts developed in father's work there was something "directed against dialectical material ism." Frenkel: Then it is necessary to change a few points of dialectical material ism. Zrebnyi: Perhaps we should reexamine the structure of theoretical physics, and not Marxist philosophy. Frenkel: Philosophy should develop, and not stand still, and it can develop only on the basis of facts discovered by science. The majority of people who study the questions of quantum mechanics do not ignore these facts. Zrebnyi: [When working on textbooks], instruction must be based on the teaching of Marx, Engels, and Stalin. This is the spiritual source for the development of all the sciences. Frenkel: I don't need general principles, but concrete results and their development. I must proceed not only from the standpoint of principles, but from facts as well. Zrebnyi: The crisis in physics consists in the fact that theoretical physics rests on the philosoply of Hume, Berkeley, Kant, Hegel, and various interpre tations of this philosophy in the works of Mach, Poincare, Duhem, Pearson, Ostwald, and other bourgeois idealistic physicists, in particular, physicists of the Copenhagen School. Frenkel: The Copenhagen School also did very much for physics. It seems to me that philosophy, even in the West, is not the foundation of physics, but its roof. And they are attempting to install it on a building which is already built. The principles of dialectical materialism must be held in mind, but we</page><page sequence="34">230 FRENKEL cannot think that we can erect the whole building on the basis of these princi ples. And this building is added to by the most different kinds of people, now by judicious people, and now by the injudicious. Zrebnyi: I will give an example of the role of dialectical materialism. The Red Army conquered the Germans because we had a Marxist strategy and tactics. And in physics we will conquer, having armed ourselves with dialec tical materialism, and idealism shall endure defeat. The AH-Union Conference of Physicists Zrebnyi's investigation was only the beginning of a massive attack on Yakov Ilich. Kuz'min's article appeared in the February and April issues of News of higher educational institutions for 1948. L'vov's article came out that November in the Literary newspaper [Literatur naia gazeta]. Further to the same program, on 17 December 1948, on the initiative of the Ministry of Higher Education (headed at that time by S.V. Kaftanov), a resolution was adopted to convene the Ail-Union Conference of Physicists to discuss "The modern state of the science of physics and the question of improving the quality of training for physicists." By March 1949, the organizing committee had conducted 32 meet ings. Their protocols are preserved.51 Its chairman, A.B. Topchiev, who later became an academician and Vice President of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, set the tone for the conference: "I believe that our conference should be on the level of the conference which took place at the session of VASKhNIL and that we should conduct it on a high ideological plane."52 Yakov Ilich read a paper at a meeting of the Organizational Com mittee. The better part of the paper was dedicated to the problem of quantum mechanics, statistical physics, and the interrelation of phy sics and mathematics. But at the outset of the paper (which was assigned to him by the Organizational Committee, judging by the first line of the text), Yakov Ilich returns to the statement he made at the Party Group of the Physics and Chemistry Conference. He shows that he adhered to materialistic conceptions based on examples from his work-the similarity of fluids and solids; applying the method of anal ogy in physics. 51. A. Vakser's article "The metaphysicists' affair" [Delo metafizikov] in Leningrad prav da (19 Feb 1989); A.S.

Frenkel (ref. 1), 265.</page><page sequence="35">YAKOV FRENKEL 231 Father's remarks were directed against a few people who did not understand physics, and who, casting themselves in the role of men tors, taught the scientists and specialists that dialectical materialism is a necessary and sufficient means for the solution of all pressing prob lems. By this very act, they politicized physics, forcing on it their dogmas, which, by the way, contradicted the standard points of dialectical philosophy. For dialectical philosophy necessarily envisages the development of its own conceptions on the basis of experimental facts. The second thing that called forth father's protest (and this happened before my very eyes) was the demand to canonize Engel's philosophical works and Lenin's Materialism and empiro criticism.53 For a long time, father refused to admit his "mistakes." He was convinced that he had not made mistakes in his philosophical judge ments, which as a rule, he expressed "in parentheses," in passing. The few conciliatory phrases in the manuscripts of his speeches (given mainly before the Institute of Physics and Technology or its Party Committee) were made under duress. During the discussion after one of these speeches, someone charged that father's refusal to acknowledge his mistakes allowed our ideological enemies abroad to create an aura around him of a modern Giordano Bruno. Indeed! After one of the philosophical meetings where Yakov Ilich did not "flinch" under the pressure brought to bear by his malevolent critics, his close friend, Pavel Pavlovich Kobeko exclaimed, having embraced father: "During the Inquisition they sent people like you into the fiery furnace!" Several other prominent physicists?S.I. Vavilov, and M.A. Mar kov,54 and among them Ya.I. Frenkel?also gave talks before the Organizational Committee. In the ensuing debates, according to Vavilov's report, V.F. Nozdrev, who worked at Moscow State University, attacked the leading Soviet physicists. In part, he said:55 In order to fight with differing bourgeois vestiges in our Soviet science, it is necessary, in the first place, to rout the cosmopolitanism that serves as a "theoretical basis" for all ideological perversions and waverings, and we must also unmask the advocates of these manifestations, country less cosmo politans like Academician Kapitsa, Professors Frenkel and Markov, and oth ers. 53. Ibid. 54. Markov's account of events surrounding the physicists "VASKhNIL" can be found in "Eyewitness" [Glazami ochevidtsa"], Nature [Priroda] (1990), No. 5, 99-101. 55. Ibid., 266.</page><page sequence="36">232 FRENKEL Physical idealism is the link which chains scientists to the chariot of imperialism. Unmasking the devils of darkness, the admitted philosophical idealists, we must necessarily expose their service to the camp that espouses the reactionary tendencies of the physical idealists. A.S. Sonin later summed up the activities of the committee as they con cerned Frenkel: "At meetings of the Organizational Committee, they started to inveigh against Frenkel's "idealism" with finesse; it was a rare speaker who denied himself this satisfaction. But P.E. Zrebnyi, the physicist and Docent of the Institute of Light Industry, especially succeeded at this. He dedicated his whole talk to Frenkel." Every speaker considered it his duty to denigrate M.A. Markov. "However, everyone understood that the main victim was not him, but Frenkel. Frenkel also understood this."56 Topchiev summarized the outcome of the discussion of father's paper. Turning to Frenkel he said:57 You know all of the Party's resolutions that have been adopted in recent years... you know the discussion... Therefore we ask you that you ack nowledge that your mistakes are serious mistakes... I did not hear you say: "The critic is right, I was mistaken." But Frenkel stood his ground:58 At this conference I willingly, and not under any compulsion, criticize the views put forth by me in Wave mechanics and repeated in other books, hav ing however pointed out that these were not my views, but were the views of those who created quantum mechanics, against which I could not then raise objections and which I explained without criticism. My mistake consisted in this, and I completely concede to this accusation. But this mistake was made owing to the somewhat naive treatment of foreign science then current. The phrasing of the last sentence constitutes Yakov Ilich's compromise. It may be glossed to mean that when Wave mechanics was written, the successes of this new, remarkable field in physics were so impressive that it was too early for constructive criticism. In the end, the Conference on Physics was not held. Several explana tions of its cancellation have been given. According to one, the powerful I.V. Kurchatov phoned Stalin. He knew all of the persecuted physicists and understood that a session similar to the August 1947 VASKhNIL might have pernicious consequences for physics.59 56. Ibid. 57. Ibid. 58. Ibid. 59. Ibid., 266-267.</page><page sequence="37">YAKOV FRENKEL 233 Another version was given by Academician L.A. Artsimovich. Three leading physicists asked Beria to stop the conference. Beria answered that he himself could not do so, that he had to report the situation to Stalin. Stalin gave orders to cancel the conference. "Leave them in peace. We will always have time to execute them."60 Local persecution The battle against "grovelling before the West," cosmopolitanism, and idealism in philosophy, however, did not end there. It continued locally, in Soviets and party organizations at both the Institute of Physics and Technol ogy and at the Leningrad Polytechnical Institute. There are several typewrit ten documents in which father tried to explain himself. These documents differ from his physics articles and books because they were drafted many times and they bore marginal comments by others, including A.F. Ioffe and my brother, who was considered our resident expert on philosophy. One of these documents is a statement submitted to the Party Committee of the Institute of Physics and Technology:61 In 1932, I wrote a textbook on wave mechanics which to the present day serves as the basis for criticizing my alleged idealistic positions with respect to issues in quantum mechanics. When my textbook on statistical physics was reissued in 1947, I included a series of chapters from Wave mechanics in it, having left, however, many places uncorrected, and by this, having rein forced the opinion that had arisen in our philosophic circles regarding the idealistic character of my philosophic positions. I must admit that in the past I myself provided enough convincing material to support such an opinion, having declared publicly (in 1931) that the methods of dialectical materialism are not applicable to physics, having thereafter never stated in print that I had long ago become convinced of the erroneousness of this declaration and had renounced it. As a matter of fact, even then, when I had made that statement, I was a "fundamental" materialist and had never doubted Lenin's thesis about the real existence of material outside of our consciousness and about its knowability. According to Lenin, the acknowledgment of this principle defines philosophical materialism_ My fault lies in the fact that I, in a number of cases, used an inexact ter minology that is absolutely inadmissible in the treatment of philosophic ques tions. When explaining a series of general questions regarding quantum mechanics, I used imprecise formulations as well as various metaphors that could be interpreted by a number of readers (especially by those who were not physicists) as perverted images, in the literal sense. For instance, these 60. I. Zorich, Letter in Nature [Priroda] (1990), No. 9, 106. 61. Cf. Frenkel (ref. 1), 266-267.</page><page sequence="38">234 FRENKEL formulations might include such unsuccessful expressions as the electron's "freedom of will." This expression and others connected with the develop ment of this metaphor were about the absence of determinism in elementary events, that is, they were a violation of the causality principle, and so on. In explanation of this passage, we may suppose that over a long period of time, many people, including some he respected, had convinced father that the metaphors he used to animate and enhance understanding, to aid in the figurative recall of his text, diverted young people from a materialistic view of nature. And they convinced him that at that time, during the exa cerbated ideological battle, these harmful metaphors played into the hands of our ideological and political enemies. There was a Kafkaesque turn of affairs: the serious physicists, a few of them Yakov Rich's former students, accused him of ideological sins, which they themselves, of course, did not take seriously as sins. And poor father confessed to these sins, which, in the depths of his soul, he did not consider sins.62 One of the agenda items at a Party Organization meeting at the Institute of Physics and Technology was to secure Ya.I. Frenkel's admission that his ideological utterances were objectively harmful, and above all, those made in Wave mechanics. They demanded that a statement be printed in the cen tral press (in Pravda or in hvestiia) in which father would admit his ideo logical mistakes and renounce the claims he made in 1931 concerning the dialectic method and its application in modern physics. Yakov Ilich presented a draft of this statement, but since it was not sufficiently repen tant, the Party Committee did not approve it. He did not respond to their request for a firmer abjuration.63 Father was especially hurt by the attacks on him by his younger col league at the Institute of Physics and Technology, D.N. Nasledov, whom we had received into our home before the war. In June 1950, in Leningrad Pravda, Nasledov reiterated accusations made by himself and a few other physicists (alas, A.F. Ioffe was among them) against Yakov Ilich. The sad and ridiculous ending of this article deserves remembering:64 Soviet physicists, as all Soviet people, understand and value the Party's con cern for them, and the concern of the greatest scientist of our era, our leader and teacher, comrade Stalin. We superbly understand that it is precisely because we are ruled by such a genius of humankind as Joseph Vissariono vich Stalin that Soviet scientists and technicians have so quickly succeeded in building a new technology... We are thankful to him, the people's leader, comrade Stalin, and to the great Bolshevik Party for the extraordinary 62. Ibid., 268. 63. Ibid. 64.

The article on Einstein In 1949, the world's scientific community was to celebrate the seven tieth anniversary of Einstein's birth. P.A. Schilpp, editor of the Library of Living Philosophers, asked many leading physicists and philosophers throughout the world to contribute to a volume entitled Albert Einstein, scientist and philosopher. Einstein himself contributed a remarkable auto biographical paper. Schilpp, invited L.D. Landau and Ya.I. Frenkel to represent Soviet science. Father received this offer enthusiastically, the more so as, just then, in 1946, he had thought that he knew how to solve a number of fundamental difficulties which were then facing quantum mechanics. These questions were tightly interwoven with philosophical con cerns (cause and effect relationships in quantum mechanics, statistical causality, etc.) with which Einstein had stubbornly struggled over many years.65 Father wrote his article in English, mother typed it, and he informed Schilpp that he would soon send the English text to him. The text never left the Soviet Union. The broad campaign against cosmopolitanism and grov elling before Western science was then already in full steam. To protect himself, Yakov Ilich wrote to V.M. Molotov, who, as reported earlier, had helped father convey his manuscript Kinetic theory of liquids to England in 1944. Father asked Molotov to support his intention to send the article for the Einstein volume. Molotov sent Yakov Ilich's letter to his assistant?A.A. Gromyko. One evening, when we had all gathered in father's study, the telephone began to ring and the young lady from the long distance phone station informed us that Moscow was calling Professor Frenkel. Then another young lady? Gromyko's secretary?connected him with her chief. When he hung up the receiver, father said with satisfaction: "Well, see, everything's OK. There are no objections to sending it!" Mother obtained more information: "He said that?" Father answered: "He said the following: 'Professor Frenkel, this article is yours, and you have the right to dispose of it as you wish. We, however, would not advise you to publish it.'" We started to persuade father that this was a refusal, but he stood his ground, and even got angry at us when we continued to defend our interpre tation. Mother then went to the neighboring room where the extension was, 65. Ibid., 270.</page><page sequence="40">236 FRENKEL and not telling father, she called his junior colleague, Professor S.E. Bresler. She asked him to come over immediately, despite the late hour. Soon, to Yakov Ilich's surprise, Semyon Efimovich was at our place. "Old man [this was what he called father, who was then 55, out of friendship], you've gone out of your mind!" Yakov Ilich was persuaded and did not send the article.66 In 1951, father's health grew much worse. In the middle of September he was forced, for the first time in his life, to take a medical leave. He deteriorated further after he tore his Achilles tendon when climbing onto a bus. He and mother lived three or four weeks in one of the sanatoriums at Repin. Attacks on him ceased. People at the Institute of Physics and Tech nology where most of the staff loved and valued him, understood the situa tion. And, perhaps, worried by father's poor health, we stopped being interested in the attacks, and may have missed some. Father died on the night of January 23, 1952. 66.
