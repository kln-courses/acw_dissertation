<plain_text><page sequence="1">Impersonation and Identity: Sommersby, The Return of Martin Guerre, and the Odyssey ROBERT J. RABEL Initial newspaper reviews of the 1993 film Sommersby were mostly unfavorable, and, when discussed by film critics, the film has usually been judged to be a pale imitation of a more important French film, The Return of Martin Guerre. This article attempts to show that Sommersby achieves a level of originality by conflating the earlier French film with Homer's Odyssey and in the process depicting a view of the nature of human identity different from what is found in both its major sources. The Odyssey and The Return of Martin Guerre treat the self in a commonsense way as an entity with objective existence, the inner essence of a person. Sommersby, I try to show, posits a more radical view of the self that is best under- stood by reference to the work of German philosopher Max Stirner and, more impor- tantly, his successor Friedrich Nietzsche, both of whom treat the self as a fictional creation, a mutable entity capable of being created and recreated through acts of human will. Sommersby operates with a similar model of identity that treats the self as mutable, the outcome of an act of self-legislation. Everyone is the other, and no one is himself. -Martin Heidegger In Book 11 of the Odyssey, Odysseus tells the story of his wanderings to an audience of Phaeacians at the court of King Alcinous. The adventure given greatest promi- nence concerns his visit to the Underworld. There, he tells the Phaeacians, he conjured up the ghosts of the dead, who crowded around him eager to tell their stories (Od. 11. 233-4). In narratological terms, Odysseus acts during the adventure--as opposed to its later recounting-not only as a teller of stories to the spirits but also as a narratee or audience. Like the good audiences of the Odyssey, he asks questions of the speakers, and he picks and chooses what to attend to from among a variety of tales clamoring for his attention. Some stories Odysseus heard are only referred to elliptically; others are passed over entirely. Ajax, for example, might have had much of interest to say, but Odysseus' thumos led him in other directions (Od. 11. 565-7). Odysseus' predica- ment in the Underworld finds a counterpart in the plight of modern audiences swamped with verbal and visual narratives clamoring for a hearing. Inevitably, many stories- some worthy of attention-pass by largely unnoticed.

However, critics have failed to attend much to this element of the story, acting in this respect like Odysseus himself when he turned away from Ajax in the Underworld.3 Initial newspaper reviews of the film were mostly unfavorable.4 While film critics like Brigitte E. Humbert and Diane Sippl have found some merit in Sommersby,5 the film has for the most part been ignored and, when discussed, often judged harshly. For example, Natalie Zemon Davis, who took part in the making of The Return of Martin Guerre and also produced a popular historical account of the case,6 finds Sommersby wanting in relation to the French original. She judges that making as films other significant stories of imposture set in nineteenth-century America, like Herman Melville's The Confidence Man and Mark Twain's Pudd'nhead Wilson, would offer a more worthwhile challenge.7 Elizabeth Guild dismisses Sommersby as a film lacking in "mystery or opacity," a romantic Hollywood tale in which heroics replace ethical 1.

Remarks on the Odyssean background of Sommersby are few and restricted to specific points of comparison. Thus Jon D. Solomon, "In the Wake of Cleopatra: The Ancient World in the Cinema Since 1963," Classical Journal 91 (1996), 130, and The Ancient World in the Cinema, rev. ed. (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 2001), 22, points out that the film's protagonist, like Odysseus, returns to a wife who fails to recognize him. Elizabeth Guild, "Adultery on Trial: Martin Guerre and his Wife, from Judge's Tale to the Screen," in: Nicholas White and Naomi Segal, eds., Scarlet Letters: Fictions of Adultery from Antiquity to the 1990's (New York: St. Martin's Press, 1997), 52, claims that the hero of Sommersby, like Odysseus, creates identity through verbal performance, a point to be addressed below. Diane Sippl, ". . Even As Also I Am Known: Vicarious Miscegenation on Postcolonial Screens," CineAction 23 (1994), 25, finds Sommersby like the Odyssey in its concern for the journey back and reconciliation with those left at home. Both Solomon and Sippl find significance in the fact that the hero of the film reads from the Iliad, a point to be addressed below. 4. Roger Ebert, "Sommersby," Chicago Sun-Times (5 February 1993), dismissed Sommersby as a bad American remake of a French original. Stuart Klawans, "Films: Matinde, Sommersby, The Vanishing," The Nation (8 March 1993), 316-19, also compared Sommersby unfavorably with The Return of Martin Guerre, seeing it as "an imposture of a Hollywood film." James Bow- man, "Dogs and Groundhogs," The American Spectator 26 (April 1993), 56, called Sommersby "lightweight psychological drama." Vincent Canby, "Husband Back From War: Too Good to Be True?," New York Times (5 February 1993), C8, said that the film bogged down in a treatment of issues like "worn out land, crop rotation and fertilizer." Favorable review, however, was accorded the film by Rita Kempley in the Washington Post (5 February 1993). 5. Cf. Brigitte E.

Guild is certainly correct that Sommersby is overly sentimental and roman- ticized, most glaringly in the treatment of its protagonist's death by hanging; the film will probably always be judged inferior to the French original. Nonetheless, I hope to show that Sommersby is more than a wilted transplant from sixteenth-century France to nineteenth-century America. Rather, the film achieves an important element of origi- nality in two respects. First of all, Sommersby reaches back beyond its French original to the ancient world and conflates The Return of Martin Guerre with the Odyssey of Homer. Secondly, the film depicts a view of the self and the nature of human identity that is radically different from what is found in both its major sources. The Odyssey and The Return of Martin Guerre treat the self in a commonsense way as an entity with objective existence, the inner essence of a person. In both ancient epic and modern film, the core self, though capable of being disguised and hidden from view, remains stable through- out. Sommersby, I hope to show, posits a more radical view of the self that is perhaps best understood by reference to the work of German philosopher Max Stirner and, more importantly, his successor Friedrich Nietzsche, both of whom treat the self as a fictional creation, a mutable entity capable of being created and recreated through acts of human will. As we will see below, in Sommersby a man named Horace Townsend sheds one identity and through an act of power, as Nietzsche describes power, recre- ates himself as Jack Sommersby. The Return of Martin Guerre deals with one of Western history's most famous and notorious cases of imposture. In 1548, Martin Guerre, a young and relatively wealthy inhabitant of the French village of Artigat, abandoned his young wife, Bertrande de Rols, and their son and set off for a life of adventure. Eight years later he returned, or rather he seemed to return. The man who claimed to be Martin recognized and called by name the inhabitants of the village. He recalled the details of his marriage to Bertrande, remembering not only the priest who married them but even the name of the notary involved and the exact contents of his wife's dowry. He spoke of the white britches his wife had made for him years ago. At the same time, he was much changed. He had learned to write, and he drank more than he had in his youth. He seemed altogether a better man: a good father, a devoted husband, and a marvelous story- teller, entertaining the village with tall tales about Spain and feathered people living in far-off Brazil. However, several disturbing incidents caused questions to be raised. First, he was unable to recall where in the house the candles had always been kept. Then a wandering soldier, who claimed that the real Martin had lost a leg in battle, identified him as in reality a man called Pansette (in English "Belly"). Later still, his feet betrayed him, as it were, when the village cobbler discovered that his foot seemed to have shrunk appreciably in size. Taking on someone else's identity being consid- ered a serious crime in sixteenth-century France,9 the man who claimed to be Martin was eventually brought to Toulouse for trial, where witnesses identified him as a certain Arnaud du Tilh, also called Pansette. With the defendant still claiming to be Martin Guerre and seeming to perform prodigious feats of memory, the real Martin suddenly and unexpectedly appeared in court, walking with the aid of a wooden leg. His physical appearance, the presence of the wooden leg, and the look in his eye confirmed his identity, and even Bertrande had to acknowledge him as her husband. 8. Guild (above, n. 3), 52. Ginette Vincendeau, "Hijacked," Sight and Sound 3 (July 1993), 23-5, also analyzes Sommersby as a commercial Hollywood remake of what she considers a more ambiguous and interesting French film. 9. So Davis (above, n. 6), 62-3.</page><page sequence="4">394 International Journal of the Classical Tradition / Winter 2003 Arnaud was forced to admit his lies and acknowledge his true identity. He was found guilty of the crime of imposture and returned to Artigat for hanging. Neither history nor film tells whether the reunited couple, the real Martin and his wife Bertrande, lived happily ever after. The Return of Martin Guerre seems for the most part an accurate reflection of the historical record as preserved by a certain Guillaume Le Sueur'o and, more impor- tantly, by Jean de Coras, Martin's judge at trial."11 Both history and film tell a story replete with themes of departure and unexpected return, problems of identification, moral transgression, disguise and recognition, reconciliation with a long-abandoned spouse and son, and reintegration into society-themes obviously familiar from Homer's Odyssey. Even the two major characters in The Return of Martin Guerre resemble the main protagonists of the Odyssey. Arnaud du Tilh, the false Martin Guerre, closely resembles Odysseus in a number of respects. His nickname Pansette (Belly) recalls the close association of Odysseus with his gaster or belly that has been documented by Pietro Pucci.12 Both men were great storytellers, consummate actors, and notorious tricksters and liars: Odysseus' talent was for dissimulation-he was expert at disguis- ing his true identity-while Arnaud or Pansette was skilled in simulation, pretending to be who he was not. Davis' description of the historical Pansette is vividly brought to life by Depardieu in the film and further recalls the Odysseus of the Odyssey: "He was rather short and stocky, and not especially adept at the village sports. But he was wonderfully fluent of tongue and had a memory an actor would envy."'13 If Pansette resembles Odysseus, Bertrande is an even closer match to Penelope. Like Penelope, Bertrande is faced with a dilemma: whether to remain faithful to her husband, who may or may not be alive, or become the wife of another man. The film generates suspense regarding her character and motives by playing upon the potential for a discrepancy between the processes of recognition and acknowledgment, 10.

Since all of Coras' classical allusions are found in the annotations, my citations of Coras will be confined to the original French edition. The most complete bibliography of early works discussing the case of Martin Guerre can be found in Davis (above, n. 6), 127-31. 12. Cf. Pietro Pucci, Odysseus Polutropos: Intertextual Readings in the Odyssey and the Iliad, Cornell studies in classical philology 46 (Ithaca and London: Cornell University Press, 1987; repr. with new afterword, ibid. 1995), 178: "Odysseus himself exemplifies the gastir of the beg- gar.

Odysseus was also rather short but broad in the chest and shoulders (II. 3. 193-4). His facility of speech is noted by Antenor (II. 3. 221-3) and is especially evident in the lying tales he tells frequently throughout the Odyssey. According to Euryalus (Od. 8. 159-60), Odysseus does not look like a man who knows much about sports, but of course the hero immediately proves this estimation incorrect.</page><page sequence="5">Rabel 395 which Ahl and Roisman have documented as a major concern of the poet of the Odyssey. 14 Throughout the second half of the Odyssey, the audience is kept in the dark as to whether Penelope indeed recognizes Odysseus without publicly acknowledging him to be her husband. Whether Penelope's recognition took place soon after Odysseus' arrival in Ithaca or only accompanied her acknowledgment in book 23 is never made completely clear.'5 This characteristically Homeric play between recognition and ac- knowledgment is present also in The Return of Martin Guerre but works in a different way. The audience of the film is kept in suspense as to whether Bertrande recognizes her husband in the man she publicly acknowledges as such from the moment of his return, but she remains a Penelope-like riddle only until the final scenes of the film. Her knowledge of the true identity of the man claiming to be her husband is finally revealed through the efforts of Jean de Coras. Coras appears as a character in the film, assuming the familiar literary and cinematic role of detective concerned to arrive at the truth concealed within a mystery that obsesses him. His repeated close questioning of Bertrande throughout the film serves as a kind of mise en abyme or "mirror story," reflecting the audience's own puzzlement over the complexities of Bertrande's motiva- tion and the extent of her knowledge.16 At the conclusion of the film, all is made clear as Coras questions Bertrande for the final time and learns that from the beginning she colluded with Arnaud or Pansette because he proved himself a better husband and father than the real Martin Guerre. In effect, Bertrande solved her dilemma by yielding to a new suitor rather than, like Penelope, remaining faithful to a husband who might or might not ever return. The network of parallels linking the sixteenth-century story of Martin Guerre to Homer's Odyssey was first noticed in his early account of the case by Jean de Coras. Coras compared Bertrande de Rols, abandoned by a wandering husband for eight years, to the figure of the faithful Penelope, left at home by Ulysses.'7 Coras found credible Arnaud's claim to have decided to return home after so long a time, citing the ancient precedent of Ulysses, who even refused Calypso's offer of immortality in the hope that he might again see his wife, family, and homeland.18 Though correspon- 14. Cf. Frederick Ahl and Hanna M. Roisman, The Odyssey Re-Formed (Ithaca and London: Cornell University Press, 1996), 152-3. According to Ahl and Roisman, recognition involves the knowledge or suspicion that one has grasped the identity of a newcomer. Acknowledg- ment is the overt statement, whether true or false, of that recognition. 15. For a summary of arguments regarding when Penelope recognizes Odysseus, cf. Nancy Felson-Rubin, Regarding Penelope: From Character to Poetics (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1994), 4. Felson-Rubin argues that "Homer generates diverse speculations and con- tradictory interpretations about early recognition." 16. I use the term mise en abyme to designate "any aspect enclosed within a work that shows a similarity with the work that contains it": cf. L. Diillenbach, The Mirror in the Text, trans. J. Whiteley and E. Hughes (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1989), 8 (Le Ricit spiculaire: Essai sur la mise en abyme [Paris: Editions du Seuil, 1977], 18). 17.

Coras' depiction of the historical Bertrande departs significantly from the picture presented in The Return of Martin Guerre. Thinking that Bertrande was tricked by the impostor, Coras the author likens her also to Alcmena, de- ceived by Jupiter in Plautus' Amphitruo: Coras (above, n. 11), 6, annotation 3. Davis (above, n. 6), 18, detects in Coras' text evidence that the historical Bertrande in fact played a double role: she only claimed to have been tricked by the impostor but in fact told stories that Arnaud was able to repeat and thus deceive everyone.</page><page sequence="6">396 International Journal of the Classical Tradition / Winter 2003 dences between Homer's epic and the Return of Martin Guerre are not far to seek, Coras' seminal insights seem not to have been exploited by the makers of the film. The Return of Martin Guerre makes no direct allusion I can detect to Homer's poem, nor, so far as I am aware, has the Odyssey figured in any significant way in critical discussion of the film.19 In this regard, Sommersby differs from its predecessor in at least two ways. First of all, the later film self-consciously-and as we will see below self-reflex- ively-retells the story of Martin Guerre as a modern-day Odyssey, modeling a number of its characters after various Homeric prototypes and picking up themes from the Odyssey not found in The Return of Martin Guerre. Secondly, Sommersby eludes proper characterization as a story of imposture, a label that can be accurately applied to The Return of Martin Guerre, where identities are fixed and the false Martin eventually unmasked. For Arnaud du Tilh merely disguises himself or masquerades as Martin Guerre, a disguise openly perceived as such when finally detected during the trial scene at the conclusion of the film.20 Even the cinematography of The Return of Martin Guerre lends support to the notion that identity constitutes an objective part of reality. The camera stands back and takes an impartial, objective stance in relation to the action, communicating the story directly to the audience and avoiding mediation through characters' perceptions and interests. 21 Sommersby, on the other hand, is concerned rather with the problematical nature of human identity itself, presented in the film as mutable, capable of being recreated, and contingent upon perspective. Filmed in the classical Hollywood style that favors point-of-view shots, Sommersby in its cinematography often limits the audience's view to what the characters subjectively experience."2 (Seeing the world from a character's visual perspective may provide sympathetic insight into that character's conceptual or interest point of view.) 23 The 19. Other modern renditions of the story of Martin Guerre include Janet Lewis' novel The Wife of Martin Guerre (Athens, Ohio: Swallow Press, 1941), and Alain Boublil and Claude-Michel Schonberg's musical Martin Guerre (Beverly Hills, Ca.: Dream Works Records, 1999). Nei- ther novel nor musical-at least in its recorded form-makes allusion to Homer, though both invite comparison to the Odyssey. 20. Pucci (above, n. 12), 83, points out: "Disguise is of such an uncanny nature that it is per- ceived as 'disguise' only when it is detected and exposed-that is, precisely, when it no longer functions successfully as a disguise." However, Davis (above, n. 6), 41, argues that the historical Pansette was actually seeking to forge a new identity and become Martin Guerre. 21. Guild (above, n. 3), 49, nicely captures this aspect of the film's cinematography: "[T]he framing of scenographic space is authoritative. Long shots open and close the film; there is a high percentage of fixed frontal scenes and close-ups of the characters, as if the steady hold of the camera could reveal what is hidden; a high proportion, too, of 'master shots', that is, the overall view which 'allows the scene to be dominated in the course of its reconstitution narratively as dramatic unity'. Scenes are presented as spectacle and estab- lish the spectator as unifying centre, authoritative witness, as if the lens' steady focus matched the spectator's gaze; the spectacle is offered for mastery and witness." The internal quotation is taken from S. Heath, "Narrative Space," in: Questions of Cinema (London: Macmillan, 1981), 41. 22. For the classical Hollywood style's preference for point-of-view shots, cf. Maria Wyke, Projecting the Past: Ancient Rome, Cinema and History, ser.

For an account of the interrelationships among visual, conceptual, and interest points of view and how these may be expressed in film, cf. Seymour Chatman, Coming to Terms: The</page><page sequence="7">Rabel 397 camerawork of Sommersby suggests what the plot confirms: identity cannot be judged or determined by any standard independent of a particular human perspective. In Sommersby, an Odysseus-like trickster-in an earlier incarnation a schoolteacher named Horace Townsend-takes on the identity of Jack Sommersby through an act of com- plete identification that wins the acknowledgment of the community of Vine Hill and of Jack's wife Laurel. I will refer to the former Horace Townsend throughout this essay as "Jack Sommersby" to distinguish him from his more irresponsible predecessor. The original Jack Sommersby is buried during the film's first scenes by the man who then assumes his identity, and the burial takes place in cold autumn or wintry weather against a bleak backdrop of stunted and barren trees. As we will see below, fluctua- tions in the weather play an important thematic role in the film-as they do also in the Odyssey. The influence of the Odyssey on Sommersby operates simultaneously on two levels: both the makers of the film and "Jack," the major protagonist within the film, work in conjunction to recreate Homer's epic.24 The filmmakers fashion each major character after a closely corresponding Homeric model. "Jack Sommersby" returns at the end of the Civil War to the village of Vine Hill, Tennessee, while a suitor named Orin courts Jack's long-suffering but faithful wife Laurel. In a touch of playful irony, Orin is provided with the wooden leg supporting the true Martin Guerre. ("Jack Sommersby" and his wife are obviously modeled in the first instance on the false Martin Guerre and Bertrande de Rols, the opening and closing credits of Sommersby acknowledging the film's debt to The Return of Martin Guerre. However, the presence of a persistent suitor with no counterpart in the French film constructs the kind of triangular intrigue famil- iar from Homer's epic. "Jack" takes on the role of Odysseus, Laurel Penelope, and Orin Penelope's various suitors. "Jack's" fistfight with Orin in the barn thus emerges as a milder and less consequential version of Odysseus' final confrontation with the suitors.) Doubts about the identity of the new arrival are almost immediately raised because of his reception by the dog Jethro, whose barking is only stilled when he smells a handkerchief belonging to the original Jack Sommersby. The dog's care has been taken over by Jack's son Robert, assuming the role of Telemachus from the Odyssey. For his part, Jethro plays the role of the more docile Argus, who died after hearing the voice of his recently returned master Odysseus (Od. 17. 290-327). Jethro shares the fate of Argus, for he is found dead the next morning, killed, we later learn, by "Jack," whose subsequent purchase of a young puppy for Robert, a substitute Jethro, as it were, conveys symbolically his own rebirth into a new identity. In addi- tion to these characters, the filmmakers introduce recently freed slaves to represent some of the major servants in the Odyssey. The manor house's old cook and house- keeper Esther is fashioned after the model of Eurycleia, Odysseus' housekeeper, and Joseph, an ex-slave, closely resembles Eumaeus. He is given land by "Jack" much as the skeptical but loyal Eumaeus was freed and promised a wife and house by Odysseus Rhetoric of Narrative in Fiction and Film (Ithaca and London: Cornell University Press, 1990), 139-60. Chatman cites Nick Browne, The Rhetoric of Film Narration (Ann Arbor: UMI Re- search Press, 1982), 3, who discusses how John Ford exploits a character's field of vision in order to convey that character's conception of his or her social position. 24. I use the terms "filmmakers" or "makers of the film" to designate the committee consisting of directors, writers, editors, and others who are often able to give the impression of speak- ing to the audience with a single voice. Chatman considers this committee the "implied author" of the film; cf. Chatman (above, n. 23), 92-7.</page><page sequence="8">398 International Journal of the Classical Tradition / Winter 2003 (Od. 21. 212-16).25 Orin, Jethro, Esther, and Joseph, having no counterparts in The Return of Marin Guerre, seem present largely to assimilate the plot of Sommersby to the Odyssey. At the same time as the makers of the film evoke the Odyssey through their construction of plot and character, "Jack Sommersby" works from within the film to create the Odyssey anew by emulating Odysseus' exemplary epic recovery of wife, house, and land.26 Though never detected by any of the characters he interacts with in the world of the story, "Jack's" covert strategy is nonetheless conveyed to the audience through his actions and interests first as Horace Townsend and then later as "Jack Sommersby." As a schoolteacher in Clark County, Horace Townsend "knew a lot of fancy stuff, Greek writing and all," as one who knew him in his earlier incarnation attests. This background as a schoolteacher interested in Greek literature explains the text "Jack" uses in his new life to educate his son Robert: he reads from the Iliad, an act uncharacteristic of her husband that elicits from Laurel the remark, "You never used to read Homer." (As the false Martin Guerre, unlike the man he impersonates, is able to read, "Jack" reads from the West's first work of literature.) As Jon D. Solomon has pointed out, "There is some irony in that a man knowledgeable in Homeric epic returns, like Hector in the Iliad, to his loving wife, and yet, like Odysseus in the Odyssey, he returns home to a wife who, understandably, does not recognize him."27 Beyond such cinematic irony, "Jack's" reading of Homer within the film holds up a mirror, as it were, in which the strategy of the makers of the film and the activity of the film's audience are equally reflected. The audience, in effect, mimics "Jack," provided that, as "Jack" reads Homer, the audience "reads" Sommersby as Homeric epic. More- over, the cleverness of the makers of the film in retelling the story of Martin Guerre along Homeric lines is equally matched by the adroitness of the film's protagonist in refashioning his life in conformity with the Odyssey. "Jack" becomes, in effect, an ersatz Odysseus, a hero reliving the Western world's classic epic of return. Perhaps he reads the Iliad rather than the Odyssey to avoid revealing his strategy to Laurel, who overhears his sessions with Robert. Or perhaps he and the filmmakers intend his story as a substitute for the Odyssey. After all, part of "the anxiety of influence" of which Harold Bloom speaks lies in a later work's felt need to repress memory of its great predecessor(s).28 In any event, "Jack" functions as a reflexive counterpart of the mak- 25. Sippl (above, n. 3), 28, describes Joseph in terms that will suggest Eumaeus to even the most casual reader of the Odyssey: "Joseph, a freed slave, is portrayed as unassuming, hard- working, and a bit skeptical at best .. " 26. Indeed, the story of Odysseus seems particularly relevant to the modern world. For Odysseus as the first "modern man" and the inspiration for many works of literature and film, cf. Theo Reucher, Der unbekannte Odysseus: eine Interpretation der Odyssee (Bern und Stuttgart: Francke Verlag, 1989), 8; and especially Markus Janka, "Odysseus 1996: Ithaca auf der Biihne, im Rundfunk und im Buch.

Harold Bloom, The Anxiety of Influence: A Theory of Poetry (London, Oxford, and New York: Oxford University Press, 1973), 122. Bloom uses the terms kenosis and daemonization to signify this act of repression. He is, of course, speaking of poetry, but his theory can be easily generalized so as to cover film (and poetry's influence on film).</page><page sequence="9">Rabel 399 ers of Sommersby, much as Odysseus self-reflexively matches the poet of the Odyssey in cleverness and the ability to tell a well-made story.29 Sommersby gives great emphasis to a theme that appears in the Odyssey and not at all, as far as I can see, in The Return of Martin Guerre. When the hero restores order to home and land, he symbolically re-enacts in the human sphere the victory in nature of summer over winter." (The Return of Martin Guerre seems not to reflect such an inter- est in the interplay of natural and human rhythms.) In the case of the Odyssey, as Norman Austin has shown, Odysseus' return recreates in Ithaca an order that synthe- sizes "meteorological, political, and psychological" elements.31 Austin nicely catches how natural and human rhythms flow together in the Odyssey in his description of the manner in which the change of seasons mirrors the trajectory of the poem's plot: Autumnal and winter pictures which had accompanied Odysseus' journey from Scheria to Ithaca-the windblown chaff, night frosts, fallen leaves, bitter storms-give way, on the day of vengeance, to the sounds and sights of nightingales, swallows, farmers breaking the soil or cutting grass, and pasturing cattle.32 Odysseus himself gives verbal expression to the idea of a confluence of natural and human rhythms in the world of the Odyssey.

(Od. 19. 107-14)33 The convergence of natural and human rhythms plays an even greater role in Sommersby than in the Odyssey. Unlike The Return of Martin Guerre, where the false Martin simply appears one day at the outskirts of Artigat, Sommersby depicts the actual journey-not just the arrival--of its major protagonist.3 The return of the man claiming to be Jack Sommersby takes place against a backdrop of the kind of autumnal and winter scenes that accompany the return of Odysseus in the Odyssey. As in the film's opening scene of burial, the trees are barren of leaves, the nights cold, and winter storms impede his journey. Moreover, like Ithaca in the Odyssey, disorder in the human world of Vine Hill matches the conditions of nature, for the town barely sur- vives in the aftermath of the Civil War. "Everybody that ain't dead is leaving," says Esther, the film's Eurycleia, like her prototype given to lamenting the distress that plagues the community in the absence of its missing master. "Ain't nothin' left here but hard ground and nobody to work it." In such conditions Vine Hill-its inhabitants and the land itself-at first welcomes the return home of the man claiming to be Jack Sommersby. As one citizen exclaims, "The hero has returned." "Sommersby" almost immediately sets about restoring prosperity by introducing the planting of burley tobacco to land worn out by yearly crops of cotton and by leasing portions of his own land to impoverished inhabitants of Vine Hill, both black and white. Thus he unites the community across racial lines in common agricultural endeavor. The soil begins to yield not the wheat and barley that grow for the good king of the Odyssey but a rich crop of tobacco. Farmers are shown applying fertilizer to the fields, while Jack and Laurel make love in their bedroom, so that Laurel's pregnancy coincides with the ripening of the tobacco. Yet doubts seem to arise simultaneously in both the human 33. All quotations from the Odyssey are taken from Homeri opera, ed. Thomas W. Allen, 2nd ed. (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1917). Translations of the Odyssey use Richmond Lattimore, The Odyssey of Homer (New York: HarperCollins, 1965). Joseph Russo, A Commentary on Homer's Odyssey. Volume III, Books XVII-XXIV, ed. Joseph Russo, Manuel Fernindez-Galiano, and Alfred Heubeck (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1992), comments on these lines from the Odys- sey: "The portrait drawn of harmony between the natural order and the politically just civic order reminds us of Hesiod's insistence on connecting the two throughout his poem and especially at Op. 225-37. That they were a commonplace of Greek and early European thought is stressed by M. Nilsson, Homer and Mycenae (London, 1933), 220." 34. Some might object that Sommersby pays relatively little attention to the journey, while put- ting the major emphasis on recovery of wife and home. But as William H. Race, "Classical and Romantic Poetic Journeys," Classical and Modern Literature 10 (1989), 27-45, has shown, the Odyssey is really concerned with Odysseus' homecoming; the modern over-emphasis on the hero's return is symptomatic of a "romantic" (mis)reading of the epic that values the journey over the return.</page><page sequence="11">Rabel 401 and natural worlds about the identity of the recently returned hero. Like the false Martin Guerre, his feet seem to have shrunk in size, and drifters who knew Jack Sommersby fail to recognize him among the workers in the fields. Natural and human rhythms continue to coincide. The film's quality of mythical anthropomorphism in- vests nature with the power of judgment as, in tandem with her human counterparts, she expresses uncertainty regarding the identity of the town's leading citizen. Is he like the good king of the Odyssey after all or an impostor? The answer being in doubt, hornworms begin to devour the growing tobacco. Orin points out the obvious moral to Laurel: the worms "are a sign of the rottenness that is eating at this place." Though viewers of the film are lead to suspect that this man will be unmasked as an impostor, the false Martin Guerre having been found guilty and hanged for impersonating an- other, here the human and natural worlds eventually confirm the former Horace Townsend's claim to the identity of Jack Sommersby. In the trial scene of Sommersby, the protagonist's clever manipulation of wife and townspeople wins him legal title to his new identity. If Laurel and the others refuse to acknowledge him before the court as Sommersby, his child by Laurel becomes a bas- tard, his deeding of land to Joseph and others is rendered invalid, and he himself reverts to what he calls "a piece of scum named Horace Townsend." (Horace, we learn at trial, had once run off with a town's treasury and later made a woman pregnant and abandoned her.) Ironically, however, "Jack" can lay claim to his new identity only at the price of accepting responsibility for a murder once committed by the original Jack Sommersby. Horace Townsend thus finds himself trapped within the very identity his own cunning has created, and in the end he chooses death by hanging as Jack Sommersby rather than a life of disgrace as Horace Townsend. Finally, in a variant of the ring-compositional effect familiar from Homeric poetry, the film closes, as it opened, at a grave. While the first Jack Sommersby lay buried in an unmarked grave on barren, rocky ground providing evidence of nature's judgment on his character (Fig. 1), his counterpart lies in a well-tended grave with a prominent burial marker, even as the film enacts the final victory of summer over autumn and winter (Fig. 2). Meteorologi- cal, political, and psychological rhythms fully coincide. Nature brings forth a rich crop of tobacco, and the residents of Vine Hill use the money to carry out a springtime refurbishing of their town, thus marking their psychological recovery from the ravages of the Civil War. In the final scene of the film, Laurel brings flowers to the newly-dug grave, the tombstone of which reads simply "John Robert Sommersby: Beloved Hus- band, Loving Father and Citizen of Vine Hill." Horace Townsend's ability to shed one identity and take on another is thus acknowledged by Sommersby's family, by the community of Vine Hill and (without a trace of irony) by the makers of the film. (I take the conclusion of a film to be the repository of its truth, as Rend Girard has argued in the case of the novel.)35 Sommersby's conception of human identity as a product of creative intention and will invites comparison with the different view underlying The Return of Martin Guerre and the Odyssey. For Sommersby taps the roots of a philo- sophical tradition of thought about the nature of identity that sets it apart from its sources. 35. Cf.

Thus they may be said to exhibit essentialist conceptions of the self. At the same time, both works play upon the idea that clever impostors can postpone recogni- tion of the self through acts of dissimulation (in the case of Odysseus) or simulation (in the case of Arnaud).36 Thus Odysseus' claim to be Outis or "Nobody" (Od. 9. 364-7), made to the Cyclops, probably should not be given an anti-essentialist spin-as if he had in fact no core self.37 For as Horkheimer and Adorno, who incidentally regard the essentialist self as arising first in the Odyssey, rightly point out, Odysseus immediately re-establishes his own identity after escape from the Cyclops' cave. 38 Regarding Homeric poetry in general, Michael Clarke has convincingly argued that the self and the body are one and the same, provided we understand that the body is "exactly coterminous with and identical to the mass of blood, bones, and consciousness that is a human being."39 Modern philosophical theories that define personal identity in terms of a conjunction between memory and continuity of the body over time do not in principle differ from the Homeric conception-provided we recognize that in Homer memory is a function of the body. "If I am asked," Bernard Williams says, "whether the person in front of me is the same person as one uniquely present at place a at time t, I shall not necessarily be justified in answering 'yes' merely because I am justified in saying that this human body is the same as that present at a at t." Other considerations of personal identity, Williams says, above all memory, must come into play.40 Will- iams' test for establishing personal identity resembles the procedure followed by Penelope in book 23 of the Odyssey. Seeing Odysseus bathed and restored to glory by Athena (Od. 23. 152-65), she says: "&amp;tCi6vt', oiS' ip t yiyairoLooat oti' d8OEpito o~te h.xTv iyot~nO, giX.C 6' e o01y oyoy Ti~oEkx i:' l~rerlKg inl. vrl6y i~v 8okl77PzC~y:lo~o." 36. Cf. Sheila Murnaghan, Disguise and Recognition in the Odyssey (Princeton: Princeton Univer- sity Press, 1987), 14: "Through his adoption of a disguise, Odysseus is portrayed as capable of transcending normal human limits, as being like the gods for whom the experience of mortal limitation is a form of playacting." In a later Christian context, Arnaud du Tilh is suspected of having bewitched Bertrande, and even the more enlightened judges at his trial suspect that he has been possessed by a demon. 37. Peradotto (above, n. 29), 154-5, for example, gives the scene such an anti-essentialist read- ing. 38. Cf. Max Horkheimer and Theodor W.

I am not being proud, nor indifferent, nor puzzled beyond need, but I know very well what you looked like when you went in the ship with the sweeping oars, from Ithaca." (Od. 23. 174-6) These words convey acknowledgment that the human body before Penelope is the same as that present at place a (in this case Ithaca) at time t (before the Trojan War). This admission, however, fails to satisfy all the criteria necessary for her to acknowl- edge her husband's identity. Other considerations must first be brought into play, specifically, as Williams recommends, memory.41 Odysseus is first made to provide a clear sign (o01ic' dtpt4paca&amp;, Od. 23. 225) that he has memory regarding the secret of the construction of their marital bed. Like the Odyssey, The Return of Martin Guerre assumes an essentialist conception of the self, though the relative importance attributed to physical appearance and memory in their climactic scenes of recognition seem exactly reversed. Memory serves as no guarantee of identity in The Return of Martin Guerre. The false Martin actually wins the test of memory at the trial, recalling details that the true Martin is unable to remember, even private details of his marriage to Bertrande. The true Martin, however, is recog- nized because of his physical appearance and the wooden leg. In the film, like the epic, disguises are eventually recognized as such and the presence of the true, core self of the husband fully and unambiguously revealed. Sommersby, on the other hand, operates with a model of identity that treats the self as mutable, the outcome of an act of self-legislation, the result of a subjective stance, a commitment to a way of life-or in this case to a particular life, that of Jack Sommersby. As such, the film assumes an anti-essentialist conception of the self that makes "Jack Somnmersby" "Nobody" in a more radical sense than Odysseus, a sense well explained by nineteenth-century anti-essentialist philosopher Max Stirner, who described the self as nothing, but nonetheless as a creative nothing: If God, if mankind.., have substance enough in themselves to be all in all to themselves, then I feel that I shall still less lack that, and that I shall have no complaint to make of my 'emptiness'. I am not nothing in the sense of emptiness, but I am the creative nothing [schdipferische Nichts], the nothing out of which I myself as creator create everything.42 Stirner's anti-essentialist conception of the self has affinities with and probably influ- enced the later perspectivism of Friedrich Niezsche, who also believed in the self as an individual's own fictional creation. Riidiger Safranski nicely captures this side of Nietzsche's thought in part of his summary of Beyond Good and Evil: 41. Peradotto (above, n. 29), 156, provides a wonderful analysis of the recognition scene be- tween Penelope and Odysseus, though I might quibble with his claim that philosophers commonly "cite two competing [my emphasis] criteria for the reidentification of persons: the identity of the bodies that they have or the identity of their sets of memories." 42.

There are only events and actions, even for people, and because we cannot endure the dynamics of anonymous actions, we append an invented agent to the acts. The "ego" is an invention of this sort... The thought process, in particular, reveals that it is the act of thought that gives rise to the actor. It is not the I that is thinking, but rather the thinking that has me say "I."'43 Of course, Nietzsche should not be taken to imply that merely thinking something makes it so. Inventing oneself as an agent requires an exercise of power, and power, as Nietzsche saw, is a relational term. That is, power must be recognized by others before truly being power. As Safranski again summarizes Nietzsche, Nietzsche realized at an early stage that power is not just agonistic but also imaginative, not substantive but relational. It exists only in relation to how it is regarded.... Power exists if it is considered powerful. The power of one person becomes concrete in the imagination of another. A powerful individual is powerful only to the extent that "the one person appears valuable, essential, indispensable, unconquerable, and things of that sort to the other" ...44 According to Alasdair MacIntyre, Nietzsche's thoughts on the nature of the self and the power of the individual to create a self have given rise to the anti-essentialist sociology of interaction elaborated in the writings of Erving Goffman. For Goffman, the self "can assume any role or take any point of view, because it is in and for itself nothing."4s Hence role-playing and proper presentation become important, since an individual succeeds or fails only in the regards of others.46 Relationships of power in the creation and maintenance of the self are fully and effectively dramatized at the conclusion of Sommersby. The self of Townsend/Sommersby is a creative nothing in Stirner's sense of the term. In the theatrical role-playing he 43. Riidiger Safranski, Nietzsche: A Philosophical Biography, trans. Shelley Frisch (New York and London: W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 2002), 299-300 (Nietzsche: Biographie seines Denkens [Miinchen Wien: Carl Hanser, 2000], 311-12). Though a fictional creation for Nietzsche, the self should not therefore be considered an illusion: cf. David E. Cooper, "Self and Morality in Schopenhauer and Nietzsche," in: Christopher Janaway, ed., Willing and Nothingness: Schopenhauer as Nietzsche's Educator (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1998), 210, who shows that for Nietzsche selfhood is an achievement to which the individual must aspire. Selfhood as illusion, on the other hand, may perhaps be a condition of the dramas of Bertolt Brecht-at least in the reading of Fredric Jameson, Brecht and Method (London and New York: Verso, 1998), 54. Similarly, Susan Blackmore, The Meme Machine (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1999), 228, claims that logic and evidence, as opposed to ordinary speech and common sense, show that "the continuous, persistent and autonomous self is an illusion." The belief in the "illusory self" is brilliantly satirized in the novel Cards of Identity by Nigel Dennis (Chicago: Dalkey Press, 2002). 44. Safranski (above, n. 43), 288 (299 in the German edition). Safranski is quoting from Human, All Too Human (Menschliches, Allzumenschliches), Part I, Section 93. 45. Cf.

Only at the conclusion of the film, during the trial and its aftermath, does Jack's power-and therefore his new identity-become fully concrete in their imaginations. The final shot of the tombstone reading "John Robert Sommersby: Beloved Husband, Loving Father and Citizen of Vine Hill" bears lasting witness to this power. In the film's supreme irony, however, "Jack" has succeeded so well in the regard of others that he is con- demned to death for a crime he did not commit.47 The screenplay for Sommersby was written by Nicholas Meyer, later author of a screenplay for NBC's adaptation of the Odyssey.4s Meyer has also written the screen- play for a film, forthcoming as this essay was being written, based on Philip Roth's The Human Stain, which tells the story of a Classics professor at a small New England college, who unconsciously determines and models the misfortunes of his life on the suffering of the protagonist in Sophocles' Philoctetes.49 It is worth noting in conclusion that Meyer's interest in Classics goes back in time at least as far as Sommersby.

Thus I disagree with Guild (above, n. 3), 54-5,who argues that the film posits two senses of identity: a weaker sense in which the desire of the community to identify Horace as Jack determines his identity and a stronger sense in which Jack's performance accomplishes this function. Guild's criticism that the film reduces the courtroom to an admiring audience and Laurel to a grieving widow, while justified on feminist grounds, seems to me to undermine her own argument that Laurel and the community of Vine Hill actually determine "Jack's" identity. On the contrary, I think, they merely testify to his power. 48.
