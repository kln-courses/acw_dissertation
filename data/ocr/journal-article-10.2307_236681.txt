A plane figure, for instance, is viewed as composed of infinitely narrow rectan- gles, rather than actual indivisible lines. The move from indivisibles to infinitesimals is, ac- cording to Malet, indicative of the concern shown by seventeenth-century mathematicians for the foundational rigor of their discipline. Malet proceeds by carefully analyzing both the theoretical arguments and the actual tech- niques used by leading mathematicians of the period. He describes the work of Evangelista Torricelli, Blaise Pascal, Isaac Barrow, and John Wallis, whom he views as the main promoters of infinitesimal techniques. He then discusses the method's critics, among whom he includes Is- mael Boulliau, Christiaan Huygens, James Greg- orie, and Isaac Newton. In these chapters Malet demonstrates a close knowledge of the work of a wide array of mathematicians of the period. His examples are well chosen and serve to position the protagonists on both sides of the debate on infinitesimals. He ultimately succeeds in making a good case for his initial claim. The final three chapters, though interesting in their own right, are not closely integrated into the general theme of the book. Malet first dis- cusses in some detail the work of the Scottish mathematician James Gregorie, then goes on to provide a general overview of methods of tan- gents in the period. In the final chapter Malet moves beyond technical mathematical issues and attempts to relate the rise in the popularity of infinitesimals to seventeenth-century natural philosophy. The gradual acceptance of notions such as the infinity of space and the atomic com- position of matter, he argues, created an intel- lectual climate sympathetic to infinitesimal mathematics. I find this view of seventeenth-cen- tury mathematical practice as being closely as- sociated with theories on the composition of the physical world to be highly plausible. It seems, however, to be somewhat at odds with Malet's earlier claim that the mathematicians of the day were greatly concerned with the abstract rigor of their techniques. Overall, the book provides significant insights into the development of infinitesimals in the sev- enteenth century based on extensive study of the mathematical sources. It is valuable reading for anyone in the field of early modem mathematics. AMIR ALEXANDER Nicolas Flamel. Nicolas Flamel, His Exposition of the Hieroglyphicall Figures (1624). Edited by Laurinda Dixon. (English Renaissance Her- meticism.) lxxvi + 125 pp., illus., index. New York: Garland Publishing, 1994. $29. Nicolas Flamel has been a figure of mystery since the seventeenth century. As the opening remarks of the Exposition of the Hieroglyphicall Figures indicate, some believed Flamel was a medieval scribe who learned the secret of the philosopher's stone from a Jewish converso while on pilgrimage to Compostella. Others thought Flamel was the creation of seventeenth- century editors and publishers desperate to pro- duce modem printed editions of supposedly an- cient alchemical treatises then circulating in manuscript for an avid reading public. Abbe Vil- lain and Antoine-Joseph Pemety are among those who have made public their opinions re- garding Flamel's identity. Laurinda Dixon, the editor of the present volume, steers clear of such contentious matters in favor of a lucid and thoughtful introduction to the intricacies of Fla- mel's alchemical-emblematic work, printed here according to Erinaeus Orandus's 1624 English edition of the treatise. Artephius's Secret Booke and a testament to the work of Artephius by John Pontanus are appended to Flamel' s Exposition in this reprint edition as they were in the original, an arrangement that increases the value of the work to readers interested in the history of al- chemy. Flamel's Exposition of the Hieroglyphicall Figures will, however, be of interest not only to scholars of early modem alchemy but to scholars intrigued by early modem visual culture. First published in France in 1612, Flamel's Exposi- tion compiles images Flamel commissioned for the tympanum of the Chamel House of the In- nocents as well as an exegesis of their alchemical meaning. The tympanum no longer survives, and although the illustrations that accompany the text might seem crude and simplistic to readers familiar with the finely executed, elaborate al- chemical emblemata contained in Michael Maier's Atalanta fugiens (1617) and Johann Daniel Mylius's Philosophia reformata (1622), both Flamel's text and Dixon's remarks make apparent the connections between all three works and the visual culture of the period. These con- nections are not the only ones alluded to in Dixon's introduction and in Flamel's text, how- ever, and one of the most valuable features of Dixon's edition is her emphasis on the intensely Christian content of the alchemical images and their explanatory text. Flamel's Exposition is part of Stanton Lin- den's English Renaissance Hermeticism series 132</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS-ISIS, 89: 1 (1998) for Garland Press. The series marks a significant contribution to early modem scholarship, for it provides anyone interested in hermetic thought with reliable reprints of rare treatises. Linden and the others involved in the project should be ap- plauded for producing books that are easy for scholars to use, books with excellent indexes, a wealth of informative annotations that guide the reader through the vagaries of the text, refer- ences to a variety of other rare texts that help put works such as Flamel's in their proper context, and up-to-date recommendations for further scholarship. Scholars interested in science and visual culture, science and literature, or the his- tory of alchemy will all benefit from this volume that now makes Flamel's work widely available. DEBORAH HARKNESS Robert Boyle. A Free Enquiry into the Vulgarly Received Notion of Nature. Edited by Edward B. Davis and Michael Hunter. (Cambridge Texts in the History of Philosophy.) xxxvi + 171 pp., index. Cambridge/New York: Cam- bridge University Press, 1996. $54.95 (cloth); $18.95 (paper). The history of the assimilation of the Greek idea of nature by Christian thought, which proved to be checkered right from its patristic beginnings, is the story of a long misunderstanding, clarified primarily by certain key seventeenth-century thinkers: Descartes, Hobbes, and Malebranche. But it is Robert Boyle who understood this sit- uation in all its epistemological, ontological, and theological aspects and indeed devoted a specific treatise to it, A Free Enquiry into the Vulgarly Received Notion of Nature, which he wrote to a large extent in the mid 1660s, resumed around 1680, and published only in 1686. Thanks to Ed- ward B. Davis and Michael Hunter, who have already examined the "anatomy" of the compo- sition of this seminal treatise in a dense article published in 1996 in Early Science and Medi- cine, a new edition is now available. One of the most puzzling issues early modem philosophy of nature had to face was the Carte- sian redefinition of perceptive activity. Percep- tion was considered not as a vital action but as the self-aware act that accompanies every opera- tion of the mind. In this light the purposiveness of inanimate things cannot help but create some difficulties. How can nature be reduced to the merely mechanical and unknowing disposition of the parts of the universe when it is precisely because of its teleological activity that it seems to possess understanding? Panpsychistic ac- counts had already solved the problem by attrib- uting sense to nature as a whole, but this solution did not prevent them from falling into animistic and anthropomorphic naiveties (as Descartes had definitively shown). Nevertheless, if one was not seeking an easy solution, it was more of a chal- lenge to combat the traditional view of nature, which had been elevated to the dignity of com- mon sense-the "vulgarly received" notion of Boyle's title-as an acting principle capable of behaving harmoniously without knowing the ob- ject of its activity. It is this perceiving nature devoid of consciousness that constitutes the main target of Boyle's argument. The question of Boyle's antagonists is an in- triguing one. Davis and Hunter deserve credit for having understood the importance of Boyle's Free Enquiry not only as a paradigmatic text for the scientific discussions of that period but also as a historical document rich in references, cryp- tic though they may be, to the contemporary philosophical and theological debate. Although scholastic Aristotelianism recurs most frequently as the object of Boyle's polemic, close exami- nation of the treatise reveals his targets to be quite variegated. Without doubt the discussion of nature as a plastic-that is, unperceptive- function refers to Ralph Cudworth and Henry More. Hints at the Helmontian view of nature as a law-like process can also be found in the course of the work. But Boyle has another polemic tar- get that he is more anxious to break down, namely, the view according to which nature is a knowing entity that always attains the best pos- sible result thanks to an intrinsic knowledge. Neither scholastic Aristotelianism nor Cam- bridge Platonism nor Helmontianism maintains that the perception through which the things of nature accomplish their functions belongs im- mediately to their very essence and is totally im- manent in the being of nature. We could refer to this view of a knowing nature as the medical- or better still Hippocratic-notion of nature, or, keeping more within Boyle's contemporary in- tellectual context, as the notion of natural per- ception propounded by Francis Glisson in his De natura substantiae energetica (1672) (a hypoth- esis also put forward by Davis and Hunter in the wake of the studies by John Henry). Glisson's "inconscious life of nature" (the expression is Cudworth's) brought new life, because it was philosophically regrounded, to the Hippocratic idea of nature as a totally "ignorant," self-suffi- cient, homeostatic, and self-restoring power. Al- though the attack against the Aristotelian notion of nature concerned above all the intelligibility of the physical explanations, a wholly different 133</page></plain_text>
