(The MIT Press Series in Learning, Development, and Conceptual Change.) Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press, I986. Pp. I64. The title "Gavagai!'" comes from W. V. Quine's Word and object (I96o:29ff.), in which he illustrated the problem of the indeterminacy of translation. Although gavagailike situations may arise in ape language research, they rarely create the kinds of difficulties faced by Quine's hypothetical field linguist. A proper gavagai analogy exists in the study of animal communication where the investi- gator is seeking to determine the meaning of particular animal signals, not meanings of humanly defined signals being imposed on animals. The introduction relates some of the history of language experiments with apes, in which Premack, along with B. and A. Gardner, was a prominent pi- oneer. The campaign of criticism against ape language research waged mainly by Sebeok on the ground that the results could all be instances of the Clever Hans phenomenon is confronted and adequately disposed of (I 2). When ape language work began in the late I96os, it was still plausible to assume that appropriate training routines of the kind used in previous animal learning experiments might suffice to inculcate modest language competence in intelligent nonhuman spe- cies, with results which should satisfy most linguists and philosophers, as well as experimental psychologists. Unfortunately that goal has yet to be reached, partly because whatever it is that apes learn can always be redefined as not quite up to snuff as "language. " It is widely known by now that three main vehicles for teaching language to apes have been used: American Sign Language of the deaf, used by B. and A. Gardner, and others, which has the advantage of being a language system in actual everyday human use; "Yerkish," consisting of arbi- trary visual patterns handled through a computer system, at the Yerkes primate research center in Atlanta by Rumbaugh, Savage-Rumbaugh, and others; and Premack's specially designed language (Premackese?), consisting of small, vari- ously shaped and colored plastic tokens placed in columns on a board. In a general way, many of the outcomes of these three very different language output systems used with chimpanzees, gorillas, and orangutans have been remarkably similar and consistent. All of these approaches have employed visual rather than auditory codes because of the negative results of earlier efforts to teach apes a natural spoken language. In "The Dolphin to the Rescue" (Ch. I ), Premack briefly looks at experi- ments by Herman and others with captive dolphins, which do not impress him, chiefly because there is little evidence that dolphins are making any use of syntactic categories in their impressive responses to complicated arn-semaphore commands. I suspect that these experiments are given insufficient attention by Premack; in any case, we quickly move on to chimpanzees. Premack observes 590</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS that his own chimpanzee subjects exhibit sharp individual differences in intel- ligence (I7-20). Perhaps the much larger-brained dolphins are less intelligent than the highly anthropomorphic pongids. Unquestionably, animals with hands similar to the hands of humans, and with more opportunity both in the wild and in captivity to manipulate environmental objects, ought to be able to acquire a larger set of object-discriminations than dolphins living in a large pool. Many of Premack's examples of lexical discrimination in his laboratory relate to the different kinds of foods consumed by his apes; as far as I know, dolphins are not tested to see how many different kinds of fish they can identify, nor does it seem likely that dolphins really care. When Premack and many of his contemporaries in experimental and com- parative psychology began their training, that discipline, especially in the United States, was still emerging from a rather rigid behaviorism and operationism. So was linguistics. Simplistic behaviorism in American linguistics was only radically attacked in the late I95os by Chomsky. Cognitive psychology was likewise making a comeback. In reading Premack's account of his work with chimpanzees and language we are also dealing with a significant paradigm shift, which now permits him to say that "all the ideas of cognition must come from the hardwiring, by a route that is presently mysterious" (51). "Hardwiring," of course, is what earlier generations of psychologists unashamedly called "instinct." If Premack is correct in asserting that "linguistics is a theory of sentences, not words," what remains is lexicology, which would certainly constitute a disci- pline with profound cognitively evolutionary implications, if sentences could indeed be separated from words. This brings us to "What is a Word" (Ch. 3) in Premack's book. Apes appear to be able to handle "words" but perhaps not very well-formed sentences. Perhaps that is suggestive of the process of glottogenesis. Unlike honeybees, apes do appear to be reasonably adept with words. This is one of Premack's most interesting chapters, since he is in a position to move easily between the word-handling of human children and apes. But then we are introduced to the notion of "teaching words non-ostensively" (8i), something which does not usually happen with young children, nor neces- sarily with much of the word-acquisition in adults. My problem is that I cannot find anything wrong or less elegant about learning through ostension. Admit- tedly, some complex abstractions are not easy to inculcate by ostension. Others, including the enormous body of scientific concepts for which we depend on graphic displays, illustrations, and the like, are just as ostensible as oranges or bananas. My notion of the solar system depends on a visual, rather simple model, rather than on a set of equations. Fortunately, we quickly are returned to the notion that we and probably apes as well are wired to perceive objects and object relationships (go). Quine to the contrary, no normal hominid or pongid is likely to perceive gavagais as "stages" of rabbithood nor as assemblages of bits and pieces of such creatures. In the same chapter Premack suggests the difficulty of devising experiments to 591</page><page sequence="3">REVIEWS determine if apes can solve questions about class inclusion, for example, "all oranges are fruit," "not all fruit are oranges" (I 12). In the fourth chapter it turns out that chimpanzees can discriminate between spatially and temporally ordered signs, an ability held by some to be essential for language. The final chapter, "Missing Linguistic Links," is best. Here, we come to grips with evolutionary problems, though not head-on. Premack recognizes that perhaps, in the remote past, not all elements of language were "under the control of syntax." Nevertheless, the lexicon/syntax dichotomy is very sharp in Pre- mack's view, and he has great difficulty in imagining a syntaxless language. Unfortunately, as he observes, we have no instance of an intermediate language, such as might have existed between the earliest hominid protolanguage and recent natural spoken languages. This is why Premack finds language to be "an embarrassment for evolutionary theory" (133), as it must be for any scholar unable or unwilling to speculate about the possibilities of language origins and language evolution. He is aware of recent work along these lines, such as Lieberman's The biology and evolution of language (I985), but finds himself in various disagreements with its arguments. Also in the final chapter, still concerned with the absolute necessity for syntax instead of some kind of totally lexically marked case grammar, Premack reports an experiment in which the chimpanzee Sarah was able to consistently identify object, agent, and instrument at least well above chance in an ingenious experi- ment (I28-29). He wonders (I32) whether mastodon-hunting protohumans needed syntactic classes, recursiveness, or structure-dependent rules. In the end, however, he comes to the suggestion that the ape's language deficiencies reflect a "basic inductive weakness" (143), and that the kind of language exhibited in modern human beings may depend on something like general intelligence after all or on some special hardwiring advantages. He still resists gradualist continuity, preferring some sort of punctuated lin- guistic evolution, or rather, a cognitive discontinuity between our apelike an- cestors and genuine mankind. He suggests that advances in metacognition and consciousness were among the last competences to evolve in the hominid line. Nowhere does the author refer to the striking evidence from cranial morphology in the hominid fossil record, which exhibits an initial state in already fully bipedal hominids, of brain size no greater than that of modern apes, and there- after a very slow increase, over 2.5 million years, to present levels. This may not have anything to do with cognitive or language evolution, but it is certainly very difficult to see whatever else might have caused it. It is unfair to criticize the author for not turning his book into a treatise on hominid evolution or on the paleoecological evidence which might support explanatory models. However, within the limits of the task he has set for himself in this book, Premack might have considered the possibility that the emergence of enhanced cognitive capaci- ties in the hominid lineage was not one of the causes of the later appearance of language, but instead that language, however crude and simple to begin with, 592</page><page sequence="4">REVIEWS was the prime mover of the remarkable cognitive or metacognitive divergence of the later hominids from the ancestral common pongid-hominid condition. In this view, the special hardwiring to which Premack refers is the outcome rather than the precondition for our present cognitive status. Gavagai! was published at approximately the same time as a much larger work by Savage-Rumbaugh, Ape language (I986), presenting her work and that of her colleagues at the Yerkes primate research center on many of the same problems which are dealt with by Premack. Whereas Premack ends on a somewhat pessi- mistic note, "we must stop our infatuation with language" (I55), presumably to address some of the other important human specializations such as pedagogy and aesthetics, Savage-Rumbaugh concludes that the gap between ourselves and the apes "is far narrower than we had previously supposed". Premack raises a great many substantial questions and has shown how many of them can be attacked through use of apes in experiments involving languagelike behavior. It must be read, however, along with Lieberman's I985 volume, noted by Premack, and Savage-Rumbaugh's I986 work for a more comprehensive perspective of these most important issues. There is a full bibliography but an index would also have been useful. REFERENCES Lieberman, P. (I985). The biology and evolution of language. Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard Univer- sity Press.
