<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Building Store: Direct Modelling as a Studio Process UO Carmen Corneil is an Associate Pro- fessor teaching at the University of Toronto, and as a visitor to MIT, and to NTH in Trondheim, Norway. After grad- uating from Toronto, he worked in Fin- land for Aalto in the late 1950s and has maintained a practice in Canada for twenty years together with Elin Corneil who is a Norwegian architect. Their work includes the School of Architecture Building at Carleton University in Ottawa, and prize-winning competition projects for the Town of Vestmannaeyjar in Ice- land, and for the Arctic Center in Rovan- iemi, Finland. This article describes a series of design studios which followed a practice famil- iar to the drawing class-to prescribe limited but facilitating means at the same time that topic and task are assigned. We were concerned, in a climate domi- nated by second-hand graphic and lit- erary ideas, to simplify the conditions for making architecture, as in the drawing class one simplifies to address more directly representation and expression. The Building Store offered media with which to compose built form and space by directly modelling it, without the com- plexities of translation and transfer which tend to overwhelm our difficult and diffusive art. Five successive studios are described, each of which explored various poten- tials of this procedure. The first states recurring principles; the second recog- nizes interplay with a "field"; the third introduces a more instrumental inven- tory; the fourth develops documentation practice; and the fifth raises questions of architectural detail. This is an account of a series of design studios which sought to explore some of the more "tactile" regions of architec- ture. We hoped to compose directly with building parts, as if having free access to the stock of a fabulous building store. Its inventory fixed the scale, the dimen- sions, and the working process. It helped work to take quickly a form which could be easily read, discussed and manipu- lated. It served as a tool to help head and hand work together in testing arrangements of form and space. Each of five studios described below, developed further implications of this general process of "direct modelling." We gave ourselves "building parts" as opposed to "form parts" or other refer- ential parts such as types, symbols or pattern fragments. With this earthy "pal- ette" in hand we were challenged to dis- cover interrelationships; to make the space of interaction; the arrangements for inhabitation amongst, in association with, supported by, these parts. Having lived among, trod upon, brushed against building parts, we understand them in a particular way: a first order of experience and a first "reading" of architectural form. Could this "real scale" familiarity be made conscious and translated to other levels of conceptual and semantic thinking? Could we pro- mote reflective factual drawing studies to observe and record this reality? And ultimately would not consciousness of the qualities of the palette inform, indeed inspire, deliberate artistic exploration, and growth? Between the descriptions of the studios following I have inserted some of the questions and observations that linked them and gave direction to their evolution. The First Studio In 1981, for a Level One class at MIT we provided a kit of 1:12 scaled building parts. There were blocks, sticks and panels, few in type, dimensionally coor- dinated, and somewhat unusual; there- fore a building store unlike the real one down the street. Our blocks were 10 x 15 x 20 inches cubical and 10 x 20 x 30 inches half cylindrical, and thus matched or mismatched in specific ways: blocks that could retain their individu- ality and play particular roles in a wall. The same insights are not so accessible with conventional concrete blocks, which are part of a system for building a cer- tain kind of wall. Similarly we gave a 3 x 3 "stud": unlike the lowly 2 x 4, it can stand in the round, and resists becoming part of a framing system. The panel was 60 x 60, a size and shape that is that much more ready to become a table or platform, and not quite so suitable as 4 x 8 plywood for sheathing just another few feet of wall. (Fig. 1) So armed with samples at model scale of the wares of the Building Store, the students were given small design prob- lems where there was an understanda- ble urge to build: fixing up a backyard swimming pool, a work room, an access to an upper level. The pieces, as are samples in architect's hands, were too few to model the entire project: only parts, subassemblies, could be studied, trans- posed to drawing, and then another part considered. Thus the conversion of a three-dimensional study, the model, to drawings of record, was integral and inevitable. The skills and conventions of architectural drawing were developed afresh in recording plan and section as same-size projections of how the pieces sat. Later, cutting up xeroxes of the draw- ings, a collage planning game provided collective study of how a plan might interpret a more complex program. The familiar Building Store fragments in the assembly gave an instantaneous sense of scale and detail. The Building Store intruded into the speculation and contemplation of our design thinking: an arbitrary constraint. Some things came more easily because of it; other aspirations were compro- mised. But such constraint is true to life and art. These modelled parts have a three-dimensional presence, and fall onto the table in a particular disposition. (Fig. 2) They lead one toward rearrange- ments rather than toward images, which suggests that we are, at least initially, presuming architecture to be not so much a "visual art" as an experiential one. A visual art trades in appearances, while "experiential" might suggest action/ reaction conditioned by one's being among things. We might distinguish two currents in architecture: one preoccu- pied with the transfer of appearances, is decorative and referential.

Historically movements in architec- ture seem to proceed from image toward essence, working their way through what things look like to what things are like. Our predisposition of elements may help to advance this inquiry. It also keeps before us a second impor- tant feature of architectural design which balances a range of concerns to find a "right" answer. Jacob Bronowski in his A. W. Mellon lectures defined a work of art as an artifact which reflects "both what it was made for and how it was made". . . and "an experiment in which, if we enter the life of other people we experience the conflict of values which faces them."1 We could paraphrase this to say that architecture reflects first our use of it; second, its making; and thirdly the play of the human mind. And then we could look for the fourth thing, to transcend any of these, to find an integrative "elegant" solution. Design explorations in the studio setting need tools and methods to energize all three aspects unaffectedly and habitu- ally from the beginning, just as real materials and real life did for more "primitive" construction: Rudofsky's "prodigious builder" who, "when he played with boulders, the results- architectural birthmarks rather than buildings-were often spectacular."2 The spirit of play and exploration infuses Rudofsky's examples. 2 The parts were vaguely like building parts but prequalified to raise certain points of discovery and discussion (2a). Matching of dimensions, lines and planes give different gestalt readings: two blocks can remain two blocks, or they can in their alignments imply a third, fourth or fifth figure. They con be assembled in accordance with rules, or roles (base, infill, cap etc.). 2b shows an end to side, surface aligned assembly rule. This is a more or less stan- dard abstract form play, but with overtones of architec- tural purpose: at any moment we have not only modelled the abstract idea, but have built it. Anthropomorphic dimensions, personifications, exaggerations, appear in the work. Issues of directionality, balance, rhythm; response to ordering rules are inherent in both the pieces them- selves and in the sub-assemblies that emerge (2c dem- onstrates an "even" stair'. The interdependence and autonomy of the parts, their hierarchies, relation to center, response to gravity and light, relative weight and strength- such questions of structure and articulation arise in the initial play with the parts (2d shows a structurally stable "pile"). * 'h_.-E5r--* AafeAT blocksm Ya4.APr, srlA - cSA _" h 5" J f * _' y^C ^9_? , rT^tfUT - ; * % };^t 5)P IL&amp;b ' V ? tttrx r'nj - 4r% .

Was it exhila- rating to command nature to perform in an architectural entertainment? Was the magical world of pretense, the place and time for play, there from the beginning? These motivations are in accordance with the preconditions for play, and by impli- cation for art, enunciated by Johan Hui- zinga in his study of "playing man".3 They suggest both the invitation and the challenge presented by inanimate but physical, arrangeable material. There are many sources of inspiration in architecture. In this exercise we are ask- ing how they can be unleashed given specific and limited means. The means, the toys, "not too refined", are an instru- ment that interacts with the imagination. To quote Roland Barthes, discussing French toys: "The merest set of blocks, provided it is not too refined, implies a very different learning of the world: then the child does not in any way create meaningful objects, it matters little to him whether they have an adult name; the actions he performs are not those of a user but those of a demiurge. He creates forms which walk, which roll, he creates life, not property: objects now act by themselves, they are no longer an inert and complicated material in the palm of the hand. But such toys are rather rare: French toys are usually based on imitation, they are meant to produce children who are users, not creators."4 Child's play extemporizes with materi- als, consigning them imaginatively to make a play world literally parallel to the real adult one. Remarkably, this play world can intrinsically have miniature scale. So, the toy box is already a building store! It is not a great leap from mountain farm or kindergarten to the architectural design studio. Novice designers need some kind of bastion from which to con- front a bewildering array of decisions- about form, attitudes, rationale, mate- rials, sources-decisions which in matu- rity have become "second nature". Therefore, typically in teaching design, the scope of problem assignments is narrowed in some way: by providing copy-book models, by first deducing functional bubble-diagram relation- ships, or by encouraging abstract play with form or structuring devices. It is a characteristic pedagogical strategy to set up these "givens" in such a way as to direct the exploration into an unknown "beyond". If we give material objects, it is to explore the space of interaction between them. In the "Building Store" exercises we determined to consider building ele- ments themselves as a given play-set, calculated to work for architects as toys do for children, or as boulders do for primitive builders. It was expected that the tactile play of material qualities, the craft of directly building around inha- bitation, would be normative to the work, and that questions of spatial perception in use, structuring principle, and the mechanisms of language would arise as a matter of course.

Philip Beesley, Univ. of Toronto 1982: The panel element, used for table and food locker, sets up a pattern of squares as situ, we could avoid the subsequent translation from one medium (model or drawing) to another (building). But in the problem setting there was always another factor-the work table itself. The pieces speak to one another from a particular distance and orienta- tion, to energize the table, or the lawn or street space for which it stands. The Store is an intensive collection of "actors" that needs to operate on a field of some kind, addressing its flatness, its abrupt edges, its inadequacy for inhabitation, its lack of semantic richness. The Second Studio During two terms following, we ran the Building Store exercise with a larger second year class in Toronto (sixty stu- dents). A design problem was set where the inventory of material was played against a given volume of space enclosed by an existing factory shed, the pieces deployed inside and out to accommo- date temporary use as a summer hostel. * _ . . : .

The lobby territory is developed by the interaction of running track, stairs, squash courts and information boards. The shed provided a generic cosmos; the pieces assumed particular roles, positions and energies within it. The project illustrated, a kitchen for the hos- tel, (Fig. 3) exploits alignments and rhythmic use of the square as a centering figure, which is keyed to significant points of interest of the kitchen. The table as an arena with adjunct cooking block, the food locker "treasury", even the gar- bage bin are characterized as actors: the space of the window and the door- way framed and elaborated by them. In the sequence of that studio, in order to enhance conceptual clarity, we did a short exercise that reversed the Building Store strategies-this time asking for representations that were not to scale, choice of material for "expression", and radical formal transformation. The pieces, representing a larger order of things, (giant frames, closed and open entities, directional alignments) carried their "real" implications into conceptual ideas at another scale. Where before a panel had been a screen or platform, it now represented a conceptual divider or landscape territory. Up to this point, the Building Store had offered an elemental building set at 1:12 scale. It intentionally set a work pattern from the beginning of invention, analy- sis, notation of simple rules, effects, and subassemblies. It allowed us to feel the weight and power of building compo- nents; and to compose them around ideas of inhabitation and signification. Most important it made explicit the possibility of artistry in the direct deployment of constructional parts, thereby avoiding the foamcore to prismacolor wash to gyp- sym board processes of the prevalent transfer-of-appearances tendency. Matisse said some things about his work that we found encouraging. The work of the Fauves seemed pertinent because of their inclination to use a restricted but intense palette in a direct assemblage way; and because of their tendency to move painting away from image and toward artifact. Matisse's instruction: "Order above all, in color. Put three or four touches of color that you have understood upon the canvas, add another; if you can-if you can't set the canvas aside and begin again. "Construct by relations of color, close and distant-equivalents of the relations that you see upon the model."5 So, on the one hand, he holds himself to few, clearly distinct, consciously deployed components. His idea was "to place (them) side by side, assembled in an expressive and structural way, a blue, a red, a green."6 And, on the other, he moves painting away from depiction and towards facsimile, investigating "the properties of this wafer-thin sheet of the picture surface, which resists optical penetration, inviting the eye to cross and recross it but never to disrupt its unity."7 The picture surface has come into its prime as a space of interaction between forms and colors. In this Matisse and his friends moved painting away from lit- eral/visual attitudes towards experien- tial/tactile ones: painters working as assemblers. In his work, order is a matter of distilling or reducing to an economy of means that fulfills a high purpose. "In a picture every part will be visible and will play its appointed role, whether it be principal or secondary. Everthing that is not useful in the picture is, it follows, harmful. A work of art must be harmo- nious in its entirety: any superfluous detail would replace some other essential detail in the mind of the spectator."8 Art is constrained, poetry has rules... "What Japanese poets have most often sought is to create with few words, usu- ally with a few sharp images, the outline of a work whose details must be sup- plied by the reader, as in Japanese painting a few strokes of the brush must suggest a whole world."9 Such limitations challenge, direct and free the artist in us. We might at this point recall the achievements of our primitive builder with limited but remarkable resources, who shrewdly and playfully converted them into those "few words" of outline. And we might ourselves hope for building parts which had power as the "words of building". For us the time had come to put aside the unweildy 1:12 building materials in favor of a new inventory of parts, a pal- ette of those components that would define and punctuate the spaces of a more complex building. The Third Studio Again at MIT in the Spring of 1984, this time in an advanced studio undertaking the design of a public institution, we sought to apply the Building Store prin- ciples anew: 1. to compose directly with modelled building parts; 2. to characterize the elements to be matched/mismatched/individualized in a certain way; 3. to link same scale plan and section record drawings to the model studies. After some program preliminaries, we sat down together and made a list of all the things someone might encounter in using such a building: columns, win- dows, stairs, counters, ducts, etc. The list was edited and sizes, materials, shapes allotted to represent each item in the list at 1/4" = 1 '-0" scale. The students then made the parts in quantity. These were divided up-still not quite enough to model the whole project-and they began physically compiling various corners, aspects, conjunctions in the building. The sketch models responded to this "place- making" inventory, using partly Building Store manufacture, partly found things to stand in for "equipment", and partly generalized cardboard. (Fig. 4) Since student boards were cluttered with material, tutorials could "get physical": the juxtaposition of things could be instantly approximated and assessed.

No drafting instru- ments other than the parts themselves are needed, but shortcuts by stamping, outlining or tracing shadows are welcomed. Orthographics, unlike perspectives, require a mental calculation to intervene between the eye and the hand, a skill which distinguishes the architect's art of arranging a three-dimensional construct, from the U_-- imagist's art of portrayal. major conceptual entities, or "down" to demonstrate how a detail might be organized. This group of projects was notable for the grasp of larger organizing ideas about public use and significance, and the extent to which these were connected to tactile understanding of the pieces: a vast gym floor, strategic columns, weighty beams overhead, or porch-like "lurk- ing" places critically distributed. As the term wore on, the models were consumed in the subsequent process of testing and revision, while the projects were being developed and recorded in drawing. The model lost some of its force for those students with strong drawing and constructional predilections. For others it continued to inform the devel- opment of their project and also, we noticed, their drawings of it. We came in this studio to a process of establishing and testing the Building Store inventory as a "tool". Manipulation was possible. We could maintain a discern- ing critical attitude towards our "means" to ensure that they would serve our "ends". The Building Store is a game set- ting that simulates a "real world" insti- tution; the production and supply mech- anisms that feed the building industry. Real building stores cater either to a professional level of custom design with generic manufactured stock in steel, wood, plastic, etc.; or to a do-it-yourself or small builder activity with "conve- nience goods", designed for cheap sur- face application. The first mode serves engineering and industrial design. "High Architecture" and its finishing trades gravitate more and more to something like the latter. Building supply as a tool might well be, in Ivan Illich's sense, more "convivial"10 both within the rarified cosmos of archi- tectural design studio, and within prac- tice, or the building industry itself. The ritual aspects are at least more self-evi- dent in our studio "game" and could lead us to an awareness of this factor in the "industry". As Illich says: "As long as an individual is not explicitly conscious of the ritual character of the process through which he was initated to the forces which shape his cosmos, he cannot break the spell and shape a new cosmos."11 What is the nature of a good palette which would support action or expres- sion in learning or in building? Illich pro- poses to make available "a limited range of more durable goods and to provide access to institutions which can increase the opportunity and desir- ability of human interaction. "A durable-goods economy is precisely the contrary of an economy based on planned obsolescence. A durable-goods economy means a constraint on the bill of goods. Goods would have to be such that they provided the maximum oppor- tunity to 'do' something with them: items made for self-assembly, self-help, reuse, and repair. "The complement to a durable, repaira- ble, and reusable bill of goods is not an increase of institutionally produced ser- vices, but rather an institutional frame- work which constantly educates to action, participation, and self-help."12 It becomes a matter of survival, as the "health food" movement has discovered. Purposeful design of an inventory to be generally fibrous, but appealing, evoc- ative and interpretable, must have an urgent priority in our increasingly unwholesome world. The inventory of the building store was deliberately removed from the recycling ethic of "found object" or scrap sources, to give "acting" priority over "reacting" and to try at the outset to hold to a sim- pler, less unwieldy, set of structural overtones, orform-signals. As Illich warns us in Tools of Conviviality: "The mode of corporate production establishes a radical monopoly not only over resources and tools but also over the imagination and motivational struc- ture of people ... The industrial corrup- tion of language itself makes this issue terribly difficult to formulate. "In more thoroughly designed goods, the shape, color, and provoked associa- tions speak to the user about the way the item must be handled."13 The thoroughly designed "found object" in the studio process speaks to the imag- ination, and is given the resounding intonation of real life when incorporated into the Building Store model. We are reminded by the conditions of the game that we will come to live with-that is, to live among-these things. In accor- dance with the principle of moving beyond the givens: found objects help us to recognize "found space", to begin to focus on the enterable space of the model. The Fourth Studio When back in Toronto the following term, we organized a fourth-year studio about a small museum in a similar way to the MIT studio. This time, when the store was stocked, we started by doing a series of short exercises with the pieces. First with six things, twenty minutes to make an assembly and draw its plan and section for review; then six things and a "museum exhibit"; or four things, one of them six times; etc. throughout an afternoon or two ... making changes and substitu- tions as we went. Then, again, changing scale: the pieces as a "mass", a giant doorway, a great window, giving a con- ceptual level of understanding of the building as a whole. Or changing scale in the other direction to work on how a counter or stair rail might be formed in detail. These quick work/discussion cycles gave an exciting urgency to the drawing process. (Fig. 5 illustrates the typical plan/section record) The little arrangements of the pieces spoke back to us about the possibilities of practical and normal things, and we could begin to see the inception of radical and engaging ideas about the projects. The models in this studio, in the hands of some students, were adventurously pursued to evolve construction detail solutions in the idiom of the Building Store Fall 1987 JAE 41/1 ''e:" -1 11A"o -1 'e'll f 1, " .-w- , elK W-</page><page sequence="6">6 Clock Museum Section/Detail. Alan Scott, Univ. of Toronto 1984: The detail shows a stair landing which is related to a door and window. The massive doorframe and the window "sash" are blown up from the model parts, and presented to be "experienced" by the associated light reveals and glass screens. itself. It was heartening to see the attempt to render a modelled window frame in such a way as to achieve both the larger- scale articulation of the model part and the detail handling of real materials that would enliven it and display some of the flair of the scale model itself. When it came time to record the building schemes as whole projects, we decided, as we had done with the exercises, to draw, in plan and section at the same scale, the model as an archeological object. Rather than resorting to some other reality of construction materials and details, the crudities, mismatches and expressive bulk of many of the model parts could thus at least initially be reg- istered in drawing. Because the model is a kind of still-life subject, a table-top display, it can be scrutinized for its light and shade, its enterable space, its solids versus its voids, its variety of material texture and color. The drawings of the Museum of Clocks (Fig. 6) portray the found space of the model, but are also used to fill in the exhibits, to characterize the interplay between material and void, and to indicate the nature of "real" detail. This discovery: the idea of drawing the model as it is, in plan and section, cor- responds with the central thesis of the Building Store studies, that is, to build directly. The model parts represent building parts, the assemblage repre- sents a built fait-accompli; the drawings record precisely this "real" place. The museum studio had shown that it could be possible within the time limits of a one-term studio to proceed all the way from first determinations of design direction through to questions of artic- ulation and inflection in architectural detail. Our process of arranging "real" build- ing parts tended to present such ques- tions. Should the earthbound or the aspiring elements predominate? How was a distinction to be made? What range, what heirarchy would be most suggestive of implied figures or associ- ations? What patterns, what rules, what contradictions would apply? Fall 1987 JAE 41/1 U</page><page sequence="7">m The initial goal of moving our students out of the world of images and into the realm of real parts, was to rediscover the tactile roots of architecture, avoiding the pitfalls of translation from other sources. It can be argued that the archi- tect's work lies precisely in this area of translation of abstract form ideas into concrete built form, an enterprise that is fraught with choices. Do the geometric shapes become functional departments, conceptual regulators, or decorative motifs? We are prone in this translation to take our cues from the look of the thing, or from "The Look" of fashion. A taste for pop iconography has led us to architectural history's icons, and now "thick material" effects rendered in thin modern panel materials are a mainstay of Post-Modern wit. Transferral from form studies in foundation courses or in archi- tect's offices has recourse in our times to an unprecedented arsenal of sheet metal, gypsum and plastic products lending themselves to surface application. We admired with Rudofsky the "primi- tive's" craft in putting together and responding culturally to those few and rudimentary materials that came to hand. Our admiration could lead us to a neo- vernacular expression: a question of references, of appearances. Or it could lead us to reach for the things around us in much the same spirit as did these beginners, intent on their lives and their art. Detail is crucial to the presentation of material and ultimately to the reading of higher spatial aspirations in this "pro- digious" work. It is virtually made from the earth. Craft carries it a long way toward architectural distinction but it is in the framing and celebration of life, in the infusion of light and spirit, that it transcends its coarse beginning.14 We were trying to connect Huizinga's description of play to fundamental intentions of this nascent architecture.

This often operates at a less con- scious level, but then it can suit both these times and special moments of recogni- tion as well. In any case, it is there, it invites action, it even invites manipula- tion. The rails, posts, bases, lines of the playing field are suggestive and stra- tegic pieces, whose correctness of detail is everything. Static elements may be inanimate but they are not inarticulate: the way hands or shoulders meet them, or the way they are "read" as player- pieces, underline their tactile presence. The "playground" exists as a site of assembly in the Building Store analogy and the student is invited to recompose its elements around the activities and ideas that hold sway there. The rules of the game invisibly extend the influence of the physical features of the play- ground. One might understand simple forms as having great power through this. How are the forms to be presented effectively? How do we make the "words" of building resonant and clear? The Fifth Studio Most recently, again at MIT, in a studio conducted by Elin Corneil for an exhi- bition building, we gave more attention to the practice of detailing inventively to assemble the Building Store parts as given. This time the building was demountable and had more forgiving thermal requirements, so the full gamut of assembly technique, articulation of the parts, arrangement of fasteners, structural stability, control of water, etc. Fall 1987 JAE 41/1 bt p ;.

Thirdly, play is secluded, "played out" within certain limits of time and place. The time aspect leads to repetition, alternation, transmittal and tradition. Spatial limitation suggests the playground, "i.e., forbidden spots, isolated, hedged round, hallowed, within which special rules obtain." 4. Barthes, Roland Mythologies (A. Lavers, trans.)

See Aldo Van Eyck's playgrounds in Amsterdam for "pieces" shrewdly placed to animate space and detailed with great care; and the roof of Le Corbusier's Unit6 at Marseilles, where an amazing set of tactile elements com- mune amongst themselves and, heroically, with the distant horizon. Both of these works from the 1950s could be seen as seminal in the subsequent production of those two great architects. Fall 1987 JAE 41/1</page></plain_text>
