<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE EARTH'S FACE AND HUMAN DESTINY. By Ehrenfried Pfeiffer. Rodale Press, Emmaus, Pennsfivania. $2.75. 184 pp. + 1 plate; text ill. 1947. As the title might suggest, the anthropomorphic point of view appears repeatedly in this small book, which contains a very curious mixture of observations, opinions, and practical suggestions for soil conservation. Strange analogies are drawn between animal organisms and the landscape. In the chapter on basic biological principles we are told that the laws relating to liquids hold good for the liquid contents of plants. And since the earth is a living organism, these laws must be valid in every part of it: "The metaphor of an organ- ism." The theme of the book is stated to be that for the shaping of new environments, man must look to more than economics and must accept from art, science, and philosophy formative ideas. The adults of the present generation will not share in our own advanced way of thinking, will not "profit," since development of a landscape requires centuries-but spiritually that is all the more reason to redouble our efforts. The maintenance of the landscape is a cultural activity. As would be expected in a book published in Emmaus, we find extreme statements such as that of the significance of "earthworms, without which there would scarcely be any agricultural soil," and again: "The production of a neutral humus compost or a ripe humus manure is the alpha and omega of soil culture." And we are told to use such cultural practices as will avoid the formation of a podsol! We are told further that the plow, the draft animal, and milk, important elements in present day agriculture, were first used in religious ceremonies alone and only later were converted into utilitarian purposes. The author urges the reader to study the illustrations and their captions. Certainly the latter could, with profit, be much fuller and more explicit. ROBERT L. PENDLETON</page></plain_text>
