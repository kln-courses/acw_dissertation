<plain_text><page sequence="1">208 Review of Chimpanzee Politics Roger D. Masters Department of Government Dartmouth College Hanover, New Hampshire 03755 Frans de Waal's Chimpanzee Politics is a classic. It should be required reading in any undergraduate course which purports to deal with human nature from an evolutionary perspective. Scholars inter- ested in human ethology or sociobiology will find it both enjoyable and profitable; those in the general public who like popularized treatments of such subjects as human aggression and animal behavior should read Chimpanzee Politics instead of the latest potboiler. Why should de Waal's book become a standard and widely known study of primate social behavior? First (and by no means least), it is well written. Second, it is profusely illustrated, with images that give us a sense of having directly observed the Arnhem chimp colony ourselves. Most important of all, Chimpanzee Politics gives us valuable insight into the evolutionary status of a number of features of human behavior which have often been treated as unique to Homo sapiens. Three of these attributes, although previously observed in other primate populations, deserve spe- cial mention: (1) purposive social behavior, (2) coali- tion formation, and (3) conscious deception. A word on each of these phenomena and the importance of de Waal's evidence of their role among chimpan- zees. That other primates interact in ways that are purposive is, of course, well known to ethologists. Among social scientists, however, the myth that humans alone are capable of intentionality, particu- larly as a mode of manipulating social status, is all too pervasive. Without such purposiveness, it is hard to attribute?or expect?"moral" behavior of the sort usually described as obligation and duty. Evidence that the Arnhem chimps seek out partners and exhibit gestural displays for the effects of their behavior on others is thus a useful indication of the origins of what we humans call "morality." Consider, for example, the role of the dominant male in defending lower-status members of the troop against attacks by other males. The alpha member of the Arnhem troop?like many other domi- nant male primates?exercises what de Waal calls a "control function" in settling disputes or limiting conflict within the group. Since Carol Barner-Barry (1977), Hubert Montagner (1978), and Fred Strayer (1981) have independently observed similar phe- nomena among preschool groups of human children in the U.S., France, and Canada, we are clearly concerned with a very fundamental aspect of pri- mate social behavior which also characterizes humans of different cultures. As de Waal describes the interactions between members of the Arnhem group, it is clear that the dominant male can be challenged indirectly by a subordinate who demonstrates that the leader can- not protect subordinates and has thus ceased to perform the "control" function: An alpha male who fails to protect the females and children cannot expect help in repulsing potential rivals. This would suggest that the control role of the alpha male is not so much a favour as a duty: his position depends on it. If looked at in these terms Yemen's fall could be explained by his inability to protect the others effectively against the aggression of Luit and Nikkie. Luit's behaviour can be interpreted in the same light. To begin with he demonstrated just how little the females could count on Yeroens support by attacking them or being heavy- handed with them in Yeroen's presence. Later his attitude changed completely and he himself adopted the role of protector (p. 125). Note that here de Waal reminds us that chimps utilize very different behavioral responses depend- ing on the precise social setting (and indeed, de- pending on the precise status and prior relation- ships between those with whom they are interacting). This variability indicates that specific responses appear to reflect expectations of social roles. Furthermore, these responses seem to be manipulated in ways that enhance the individual's status or influence in the group's structure. As a matter of fact, without imputing purposiveness or intentionality in social behavior to de Waal's chimps, it is hard to make sense of many of the sequences he describes. Lest his interpretations be put down to anthropomorphism, it should be noted that any methodology which excludes his data from the class of purposive social interaction will thereby exclude a large portion of the evidence routinely accepted by other social scientists. Either the Arnhem chimps are purposive?and show signs of the primitive roots of moral duty, or we have little evidence that humans are purposive, moral beings. Second, and directly related, is the extensive evidence of shifting coalition behavior in the Arnhem chimps. Again, we have known for some time that many primates are organized in groups whose lead- ers engage in mutual support. However, for the first time we have very detailed observations of the process by which these dominance patterns change. On the basis of these observations, we find that?as Ivan Chase has recently pointed out in</page><page sequence="2">209 looking at the dynamics of hierarchy formation (Chase, 1980)?the bystander is as important as the interacting dyad of alpha male and challenger. The complexity of the chimps' social interactions is thus valuable evidence of the intrinsically social nature of dominance. Long perceived as an attribute of the leader, dominance is probably best viewed as a trait which is inherently part of a group structure; "we tend to think that the outcome of a fight determines the social relationship, whereas here the outcome was determined by the social relationship" (p. 111). As McGuire's data on vervet monkeys indicates, the physiological profile of leaders differs from that of followers as a consequence of the behavioral interactions which signal high status (not the other way around): the dominant male has higher seritonin levels than subordinates because the sub- ordinates exhibit submissive displays in his pres- ence, not vice versa (McGuire, Raleigh, and John- son, 1983). Finally, but as particularly critical evidence for the two foregoing traits, chimps show unmistakable evidence of what can only be called "conscious deception." Among the instances de Waal cites, my favorite is the following account of the behavior of an alpha male (at the time, Luit) being challenged by a coalition of two other adult males (Nikkie aligned with Yeroen): Nikkie was driven into a tree, but a little later he began to hoot at the leader [Luit] again while he was still perched in the tree. Luit was sitting at the bottom of the tree with his back to his challenger. When he heard the renewed sounds of provocation he bared his teeth [in the submis- sive "grimace" display]but immediately put his hand to his mouth and pressed his lips together. I could not believe my eyes and quickly focused my binoculars on him. I saw the nervous grin appear on his face again and once more he used his fingers to press his lips together. The third time Luit finally succeeded in wiping the grin off his face; only then did he turn around (p. 133). If deception and self-deception are characteristic of humans, as Lockard (1979) has argued (using evi- dence of the facial display of emotion), such behav- ior is also found among our nearest primate rela- tives! Other readers will doubtless find their own favorite tidbits in de Waal's vivid and thought-provoking account. For myself, his conclusion?namely that chimps in the Arnhem colony can be said to illus- trate some of Machiavelli's maxims?is far less significant than his descriptive material. Getting to know the members of the Arnhem chimp colony, like learning about Jane Goodall's observations at Gombe, inevitably makes one better informed on the origins of human social behavior. Even if it is true that free-ranging or approvisioned chimps at Gombe show slightly different responses than the zoo population of Arnhem, Chimpanzee Politics can hardly be dismissed as irrelevant to a deeper understanding of human nature. After all, like the Arnhem chimps?and unlike those at Gombe? human societies that have abandoned the hunter- gatherer mode can well be described as cages, albeit large ones permitting each individual to get out of sight of others. De Waal's chimps may thus provide particularly valuable evidence of what hap- pens to hominoids when they cannot easily leave their home community, and thus,like humans after the invention of agriculture, they tend to substitute shifting social alignments for the group fission char- acteristic of hunter-gatherers and wild chimps. De Waal's fascinating account thus reminds us of the complexity of primate social behavior. The rich- ness of his careful ethological observation is a means of deepening our understanding of both chimpanzees and humans. In the process, we can begin to trace the origins of specifically human traits in the social interactions of other species. Aristotle was right to speak of human beings as the zoon politikon.
