Conference organizers are requested to obtain the appropriate abstract forms from the Secretary (address inside front cover). ROYAL MUSICAL ASSOCIATION MIDLANDS CHAPTER MEETING (NOTTINGHAM, 23 MARCH 1991) David Rowland: 'Scarlatti's Piano Sonatas, Mozart's Harpsichord Concertos, and the Musical Offering: Keyboard Instruments in the Eighteenth Century' Crawford Howie (University of Manchester): 'Joseph Schalk, Bruckner and Wolf: A Glimpse of Musical Life in Vienna in the 1880s and 1890s' Schalk was an eloquent advocate for Bruckner and Wolf in Vienna in the last 20 years of the nineteenth century. He made two-piano arrangements of Bruckner's symphonies, which he played regularly (at a time when there were few orchestral performances), and he participated in many first performances of Wolf's songs. Peter Wright (University of Nottingham): 'Johannes Brassart and Johannes de Sarto: Friends or Rivals?' A motet on the death (1439) of Albrecht II of Germany lists Brassart and Sarto as members of the same (Albrecht's) choir, an association to which an attribution conflict in the Aosta manuscript bears further witness. Com- parison of works by the two demonstrates broad stylistic affinities and more specific connections. Charles Bodman Rae (City of Leeds College of Music/University of Leeds): 'The Harmony and Rhythm of Continental European Bells' Bell sounds in the music of Liszt, Wagner, Mahler, Debussy, Ravel, Musorgsky, Rachmaninov, Stravinsky and others stem from continental Euro- pean techniques of bell-ringing. While the English system is primarily melodic, in central Europe bells are governed by harmony and ring to pro- duce chords. Russian Orthodox zven-ringing is governed by rhythm. Barry Sterndale-Bennett (Andover, Hants.): 'Sir William Sterndale-Bennett (1816-75) - 175 Years On' Description of his early influences, association with Mendelssohn and Schumann, etc. in Leipzig, assessment of his 80 published works, the best from his early years. His work on the revival or Dnah's Passion music. Teaching and principalship at the Royal Academy of Music, professorship at Cambridge. Current musicological reappraisal.</page><page sequence="2">166 CONFERENCES ROYAL MUSICAL ASSOCIATION 26TH ANNUAL CONFERENCE (LONDON, 5-7 APRIL 1991) Iain Fenlon (University of Cambridge): 'Lepanto: The Arts of Celebration in Renaissance Venice' The reaction among composers and other artists working in Venice and the Veneto to the victory at Lepanto in 1571 was unparalleled in the history of sixteenth-century Italy. The themes and function of the music produced betray a peculiarly Venetian attitude towards the place of art within celebratory rhetoric. Ruth Smith (University of Cambridge): 'Handel's Oratorio Librettos and English Politics, 1732-52' When we look in detail at English political theory and debate of the period, we begin to see that the librettos reflect an interesting range of current con- cerns, and that in political terms their writers were not simply propagandists for the Hanoverian establishment. Lynn Hulse (King's College, London): '"There is no voice enough can sing / The praise of our great King": Provincial Royal Entertainments 1617-34' An examination of the motives which prompted the fourth earl of Cumberland and the earl of Newcastle to stage elaborate musical enter- tainments for James I and Charles I during the royal progresses of 1617, 1633 and 1634. Provincial musical entertainments could be just as significant politically as their Whitehall counterparts. Bruce Wood (University College of Wales, Bangor) and Andrew Pinnock (Lon- don): ' "Unscarr'd by turning times"?: Politics and English Opera in the 1680s' More than one interpretation based on political allegory has been proposed for Purcell's Dido and Aeneas. Some new and recent discoveries, however, and a fresh scrutiny of previously known evidence, suggest that the background of the opera was totally different from that hitherto supposed. Bojan Bujic (University of Oxford): 'Nationalist Sentiments as Factors determin- ing some Nineteenth-Century Standards in Music' A number of German critics believed that their arguments were based on universal notions of taste, whereas a closer look discloses shortcomings which they share with the more narrowly defined 'nationalist' critics. The paper refers to writings of Richard Wagner, Wilhelm Heinrich Riehl, Vladimir Odoevsky, Mily Balakirev and Alexander Serov. John Deathridge (University of Cambridge): 'German Music and Germany's "Special Path" ' The Sonderweg - the idea that after 1848/9 Germany embarked on a course leading inevitably to Hitler - is an accepted model of German history much criticized in recent years. This paper discusses the development of German music in the second half of the nineteenth century in the light of the controversy. Roger Parker (Cornell University):' "Vate del risorgimento": Verdi, Politics and Va pensiero' The easy equation between music and politics is suspicious by its ubiquity; it may even have interposed a governing metaphor between Verdi's music and his listeners. This paper sets out to explore these issues, with particular reference to one of Verdi's most 'patriotic' choruses.</page><page sequence="3">CONFERENCES 167 Jarmil Burghauser (Prague): 'The Positive and Negative Effects on Czech Culture of Zden&amp;k Nejedly in the Post-War Era' The first minister of education in the post-war communist government of Czechoslovakia, Nejedly exerted enormous influence over all aspects of Czech culture. His frequently destructive behaviour and severe attitude to, for in- stance, Dvohik and JanicEek caused anomalies in the perception of Czech musical history which are only now being addressed. Ian Kemp (University of Manchester): 'The "Teaching Piece" in the Weimar Republic' This paper examines the didactic elements, political and musical, in the three Lehrstiicke Brecht wrote in collaboration with Eisler, Hindemith and Weill. Erik Levi (Royal Holloway and Bedford New College): 'Conservative Musical Reaction in Germany during the Weimar Republic' Previous studies have tended to focus on stylistic experimentation or the po- tent influence of the Left. This paper charts the evolution of nationalist and conservative reaction to such developments, culminating in the formation in 1929 of Rosenberg's Kampfbund ffir deutsche Kultur, which became the cultural mouthpiece of the Nazi party. John Williamson (University of Liverpool): 'Peter Raabe: Musicology and Politics in Nazi Germany' Raabe's reputation is overshadowed by his presidency of the Reichsmusik- kammer during the Third Reich. His last years show the degree to which Ger- man scholarship succumbed to the absence of doctrine, enabling cultural politics in the Third Reich to be a refuge for the inconsistent as much as for the idealogue. Adrian Thomas (BBC, London): 'The Compositional Realities of Polish "Socrealizm" in the Post-War Decade' This paper looks at the music of Lutoslawski, Panufnik, Serocki and Baird amongst others in the context of the ideological restraints facing Polish com- posers in the years following the Second World War and how they faced up to and sidestepped official requirements. Graham Melville Mason: 'Nejedl9 and Beyond' Nejedl9's influence can be discerned even today at the musical education level. He supported Ostrvil and Foerster while showing antagonism towards Janaiek, Novak, Suk and Martinf'. He built up a coterie of politically like- minded composers who victimized the next two generations. Many of his supporters changed their stance after 1968. Alexander Ivashkin (University of Canterbury, New Zealand): 'The Paradox of Russian Non-Liberty' Russian art is more productive in an atmosphere of social and political con- tradictions. There is a liberty, but also a secret inner tension, in Soviet music of the late 1980s. This paradox is examined with reference to the works of Schnittke, Gubaidulina, Sylvestrov and composers of the younger generation. James MacMillan (Glasgow): 'Liberation Theology: A Composer's Response to the Crisis of the Left' Composers of the Left, in expounding a political gesturalism in their work, may achieve only a series of outmoded statements to which musical adherence has been sacrificed. The author accounts for his own reorientation towards Liberation Theology in an attempt to write music of both timeless and con- temporary implications.</page><page sequence="4">168 CONFERENCES ROYAL MUSICAL ASSOCIATION IRISH CHAPTER MEETING (BELFAST, 11 MAY 1991) Ian Parrott (University College of Wales, Aberystwyth): 'The Piano Music of Cyril Scott (1879-1970)' Unknown as a poet and misunderstood as a philosopher, Scott produced much original but neglected piano music, alongside the impressionism of Debussy, the irregular rhythms of Stravinsky and the harmony of Delius. Music examples are from the three piano sonatas, the two concertos and from Poems (1912), etc. John Koegel (University of Cambridge): 'Young Master Cowell at Carmel: Henry Cowell's Early Theatre Music for Carmel, California' Music Cowell wrote as a teenager for plays at the Forest Theater in 1913 shows the influence of non-Western traditional music and American vernacular music. The theatre music, a previously lost composition and Cowell's sub- sequent musical activities in Carmel as a mature artist in the 1920s are examined. Jonathan Stock (Queen's University, Belfast): 'Development Processes in Music for the Chinese Two-Stringed Fiddle, Erhu' Concentrating on the erhu repertory of the blind musician Abing, this paper investigates the nature of development as a compositional and improvisatory process in traditional Chinese instrumental music. Through analysis of the separate melodic elements found in Abing's improvisations a flexible but per- vasive musical plan is revealed. Barra Boydell (St Patrick's College, Maynooth): 'Music in Seventeenth-Century Anglo-Irish Society' The role played by music in seventeenth-century Anglo-Irish society, in par- ticular in 'new English' landed families and the Irish nobility sympathetic to the English, has remained largely unresearched. This paper presents a preliminary report on findings based largely on the Lismore papers of the earls of Cork. Roy Johnston (Queen's University, Belfast): 'An Eighteenth-Century Musical Society in Belfast' The Belfast Music Society first appeared in 1768. In a town of under 15,000 people, notice of its activities circulated mostly by other means, but enough evidence survives in the newspapers and other sources to give a coherent pic- ture over two decades at least of a gentlemen's music-making society. ROYAL MUSICAL ASSOCIATION NORTHERN CHAPTER MEETING (EDINBURGH, 11 MAY 1991) David Johnson (Edinburgh): 'The Clerk of Penicuik Violin Sonata' Sir John Clerk of Penicuik (1676-1755) studied composition in Rome with Corelli 1697-8 and continued to compose after his return to Scotland. His violin sonata (c. 1705) was published in 1990 for the first time. Some questions are raised about thematic transformation techniques in the middle Baroque period.</page><page sequence="5">CONFERENCES 169 Ian Biddle (University of Newcastle upon Tyne): 'Genre as Profit Acquisition?: A Critical Approach to Contemporary Issues of Genre' This paper falls into two parts: the first attempts a critical overview of con- temporary theories of genre and the second attempts to construct a theory of genre that is based not on formal or stylistic criteria, but on the nature of a genre's dissemination in the commercial world. Michael Spitzer (University of Durham): 'The Original Sin of Musical Modernity: False Reprise and the Problematization of Meaning in Musical Narrative' Since Adorno's critique of Beethoven centres around the authenticity of the recapitulatory procedures, it would be useful to examine a work such as the 'Hammerklavier' Sonata in relation to the Classical convention of 'false reprise' and the Romantic subversion of tonal balance. John Rink (University of Newcastle upon Tyne): 'Models in Eighteenth- and Nineteenth-Century Improvisatory Music' This paper studies contemporary treatises and critical accounts to provide a theoretical framework for the analysis of three eighteenth- and nineteenth- century improvisatory works: J. S. Bach's 'Chromatic' Fantasy, Mozart's C minor Fantasy, K.475, and Beethoven's Fantasy, op. 77. Important general issues related to the aesthetics of improvisation are also explored. MUSIC AND GENDER CONFERENCE (LONDON, 5-7 JULY 1991) Lucy Green (Institute of Education, London): 'Gender, Music and the Role of Education' Hilary Bracefield (University of Ulster, Jordanstown): 'University Composition Teaching in the United Kingdom: Perceptions of the Place of the Woman Student' Helen Simpson (Bretton Hall): 'Strategies for the Future of Women in Music' Susan H.

C. Robbins Landon (University of Wales College of Cardiff): 'Mozart and the Requiem' NINETEENTH MEDIEVAL AND RENAISSANCE MUSIC CONFERENCE (OXFORD, 19-22 JULY 1991) Jeffrey Dean (The Stingray Office): 'Okeghem's Intemerata dei mater' The poem is of extraordinary quality; the unknown poet was not Okeghem himself. The music has a sophisticated tonal design, as well as a disguised structural repetition at the close. There are several cases of musical illustra- tion of the text. Musical allusions suggest that Intemerata was composed as a valediction.</page><page sequence="9">CONFERENCES 173 Barbara Haggh (University of Maryland, Baltimore County): 'Text and Music in the Recollectio festorum Beatae Mariae Virginis' Du Fay's chant reflects word-accent and syntax, preferring melismatic or sus- taining accent to tonic accent. Quotations from other chant and musical rhyme are rare but present. Most striking is the correspondence of important words and highest pitch in 17 of the 21 antiphons for the Office and the sym- bolic use of mode. Eric Jas (Rijksuniversiteit, Utrecht): 'Nicolas Gombert's Missa Fors seulement: A Case of Doubtful Authorship' Martin Picker (Rutgers University): 'Isaac in Flanders: The Early Works of Henricus Isaac' Christopher Reynolds (University of California, Davis); 'Ercole's Marian Mass: An Anglo-Burgundian Source for Josquin's Soggetto cavato' Manuel Pedro Ferreira (Princeton University): 'The Stemma of the Marian Cantigas: Philological and Musical Evidence' The relationship between the four central sources of the Cantigas de Santa Maria is assessed. A stemma is proposed and dates discussed. Manuscript To is described and some of its characteristics are newly interpreted. It is con- cluded that To is representative of the first stages of the collection. Maricarmen G6mez-Muntane (Universidad Aut6noma de Barcelona): 'Secular Catalan and Occitan Music from the End of the Middle Ages: Looking for a Lost Repertory' Manuscripts from the end of the Middle Ages do not suggest that during this period an important musical repertory in Catalan/Occitan ever existed: the extant music from Aragon is either Latin-texted or in French. However a secular musical repertory in Catalan/Occitan did exist in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. Kenneth Kreitner (Memphis State University): 'Minstrels in Spanish Churches, 1400-1600' Bernadette Nelson (Ashmolean Museum, Oxford): 'From Psalm Tone to Organ Verset: The Phenomenon of the Fabordon in Iberian Sources' The Iberianfaborddn, essentially a four-part setting of a psalm tone, is found in vocal and instrumental sources from the late fifteenth century onwards. Each psalm-tone setting became identified with a harmonic formula which formed the constructional basis of variations and alternatim organ settings for at least two centuries. Owen Rees (University of Oxford): 'Music for the Jesuit Theatre in Sixteenth- Century Portugal' Chorus settings for plays have recently been discovered in a manuscript in Coimbra University Library. These works by Francisco de Santa Maria are a remarkable experiment in musical humanism, in which rhythm is made sub- ject to textual accent and the requirements of rhetorical delivery. Anna Maria Busse Berger (University of California, Davis): 'Minutiae and Chronaca: A Background to the Fourteenth-Century Mensural System and Signs' Virginia Newes (Eastman School of Music): 'Dialogue and Dispute in Some Polytextual Songs of the Late Middle Ages' Rather than a realistic or pictorial approach to text setting, the simultaneous performance of multiple texts exemplifies symbolic and conventional</page><page sequence="10">174 CONFERENCES representation of a poetic topos. In Machaut's ballade 17, canonic entries symbolize a sequential dialogue. Other fourteenth-century dialogue chansons employ divergent textures that are equally genre-specific and text-generated. Jehoash Hirshberg (Hebrew University, Jerusalem): 'The Hexachordal System as a Compositional Premiss in Machaut's Secular Repertory' Hexachordal theory dominates music conceptualization in fourteenth- century theory. Application and placement of ficta signs in the Machaut manuscripts adheres to hexachordal thinking. Machaut's use of ficta reflects a process of formation of an economic dualism of C and D as finales and modal properties. Daniel Leech-Wilkinson (University of Southampton): 'The Well-Formed Virelai' Analysis suggests that Machaut's monophonic virelais are more sophisticated constructions than has been supposed. They offer a wide range of readings of the form including some that are circular. Changes in Machaut's approach to form and use of similar material in different contexts point to refined chronological groupings. Margaret Bent (Princeton University/University of Oxford): 'Machaut's Motets 10 and 15' David M. Kidger (Harvard University): 'Petrus de Domarto's Three-Voice Mass and its Position in the Vatican Choirbook MS San Pietro B 80: An Anonymous Mass Complex from the 1450s' Features of a Kyrie, ascribed to Egidius Cervelli and copied with a three-voice Mass by Domarto, indicate that it may also be by Domarto. Other factors sug- gest that its original ascription be maintained. The context for this Mass, a group of six, suggests that this group is a Mass complex. Reinhard Strohm (King's College, University of London): 'The Mass-Motet Cycle in the Mid-Fifteenth Century and Related Questions of Chronology' Andrew Kirkman (University of Manchester): 'The Style of Walter Frye and an Anonymous Mass in Brussels, MS 5557' Jaap van Benthem (Rijksuniversiteit, Utrecht): 'Was Une mousse de Biscaye Really Appreciated by L'ami Baudichon?' Although Josquin's Mass settings of L'ami Baudichon and Une mousse de Bzscaye are believed to be early compositions, they share little in layout and style, and characteristics of the latter hint at the style of Gaspar van Weerbeke. The authenticity of the Missa Une mousse de Biscaye must be con- sidered problematical. Flynn Warmington (Somerville, Massachusetts): 'The Winds of Fortune: A New View of the Provenance and Date of Cappella Sistina Manuscripts 14 and 51' Pierluca Lanzilotta (University of Bari): 'O rosa bella and the Oral Tradition' The comparison, at a level of melodic material, between Bedyngham's O rosa bella and a set of anonymous giustiniane contained in fifteenth-century Italian sources suggests that Bedyngham, who may well have stayed in Italy, could have based his setting on aeri that had been previously improvised on that same text or on related ones. M. Jennifer Bloxam (Williams College): 'La contenance italienne: Northern Composers and the Lauda in the Fifteenth Century'</page><page sequence="11">CONFERENCES 175 Anthony M. Cummings (The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation): 'The Florentine Carnival of 1513' John Bettley (Maidenhead): 'North Italian Compline in the Second Half of the Sixteenth Century' The establishment of monastic cappelle di musica created a large new market which stimulated published production of polyphonic settings of the Vespers and Compline liturgy. The scale of monastic celebration of Compline, par- ticularly during Lent, is reflected in the surviving polychoral repertory and in contemporary records. Richard Freedman (Haverford College): 'Marenzio, Sannazaro, and Cultural Politics in the Cinquecento Madrigal' In 1588 Marenzio brought out a collection of madrigals in a new idiom; a musical and poetic voice of renewed and special gravity. Marenzio's rework- ing of poetry by Sannazaro, among his favourite authors for light verse, is here reworked to control and contain the seductive powers of the bucolic topos. Isobel Preece (University of Newcastle upon Tyne): 'The Rhetorica ad Heren- nium and the Notation of Western Chant' The new interest in notated music in the ninth century may have been occa- sioned by the rediscovery of the Rhetorica ad Herennium, which contains a description of an artificial memory system based on pictorial representation. The relationship between music and memory and the case of Aurelian of Re6me are discussed. John Bergsagel (University of Copenhagen): 'Some Implications of the Pre- Franconian Notation of the Recently Discovered Copenhagen Magnus liber organi Fragments' Eugeen Schreurs (University of Leuven): 'Musical Life at Tongeren During the First Half of the Fifteenth Century in the Context of Western European Music History' Liane Curtis (Ohio State University): 'Simon Mellet, Medieval Music Scribe' Archival evidence concerning Simon Mellet's 36-year scribal career at Cam- brai cathedral, combined with a study of surviving music sources from the cathedral, permits identification of materials copied by Mellet. These include sources of chant and the polyphonic manuscript Cambrai BM 11; for the lat- ter, the date of 1442-5 is proposed. Keith Polk (University of New Hampshire): 'Innovation in Instrumental Music in the Fifteenth Century: A Case for Courtly Patronage' Honey Meconi (University of Pennsylvania/Rice University): ' "Free from the Crime of Venus": The Biography of Pierre de la Rue' New archival discoveries and re-examination of previously known material make possible a significantly fuller biography of La Rue. That he was pro- bably born a decade earlier than formerly thought, did not work in Siena, and worked instead in Brussels, Ghent, Nieuwpoort and Cologne are some of the major changes.</page></plain_text>
