<plain_text><page sequence="1">History and the Sociat Sciences By R. E. McGREW * During the four decades which have passed since Max Weber published his Wirtschaft und Gesellschaft the social sciences have reached maturity. Both government and industry, increasingly con- cerned with social developments, have looked to social scientists for specialized information, while modern organized philanthropy has sheltered and subsidized social science research, providing an un- precedented reservoir of funds. The social sciences have responded to the combined stimuli of responsibility and cash by expanding their areas of interest and by developing new methods and tech- niques. Today the social scientist can point with understandable pride to the "success of the social sciences in devising procedures of convincing reliability" which "have led to their marriage with policy to an extent which would have been conceived in principle only in Weber's time."1 Such progress can never be entirely smooth, and as they have grown in influence, the social sciences have been sharply criticized. This has been in part self-criticism, for scholars in the disciplines concerned have been steadily re-evaluating their methods and as- sumptions. Outside the social sciences, however, the bitterest criti- cism has come from the humanities. Humanists have attacked the social scientist for applying scientific methods to data which cannot be investigated scientifically, for contributing to a "mass conscious- ness" by using quantitative techniques, and for creating a pseudo- 1Edward A.

Bennett M. Berger has sug- gested that these attacks imply a deep resentment, cultural in origin, which reflects an ideology rooted in the Western individualist tradi- tion.2 Mr. Berger's point is well taken. The social sciences do not speak the traditional language nor do they follow traditional tech- niques. Even so, the social sciences and the humanities share the common goal of broadening human understanding. This common ground has been obscured and should be rediscovered. The historian has occupied a middle position in this dispute, for history holds a place of honor in both the social sciences and the humanities, and the historian's methods combine both "science" and "humanism." Indeed, the evolution of the modern social sciences shows a considerable debt to history. Montesquieu, to choose one example, provided one of the earliest sociological interpretations of the law, and some of his ideas anticipated Weber. At the same time, Montesquieu set his analysis within a definite, if somewhat con- fused, theory of historical causation, and his use of historical context led Friedrich Meinecke to call him one of the founders of his- toricism. Baron Heinrich Storch, a member of the Imperial Russian Academy of Science, and one of Russia's earliest social scientists, married scientific method with historical patterns to provide a broader application for Adam Smith's theories. The best known example, of course, is Karl Marx who welded scientific analysis with history to provide an approach to social problems whose influ- ence has been both pervasive and lasting. The organic connection between history and social science broke with Weber who insisted on clear methodological distinctions among the disciplines, and these distinctions have since been gen- erally observed. Even modern social scientists, however, have found history necessary. David Riesman's Lonely Crowd has a basic his- torical structure, and the relationship between "inner" and "outer" directed men is historically oriented. Erich Fromm utilized Freudian theses on a social plane, but exploited history for his contextual and developmental framework, while Herman Finer joined historical methods with comparative analysis in his Theory and Practice of 2Bennett M. Berger, "Intellectuals and Sociologists," Antioch Review, Fall, 1957.</page><page sequence="3">278 THE ANTIOCH REVIEW Modern Government. More recently, in his essays on The Demo- cratic and the Authoitarian State, Franz Neumann emphasized history's essential role in the social scientist's work. None of this proves that one discipline is "higher," more "fun- damental," or more scientific than another, but it does show that history and the social sciences have fertilized one another, and that the historian, as both scientist and humanist, has something of value to add when the status and role of the social sciences are discussed. Charles Beard once wrote that all the social disciplines are ultimately concerned with history, or history-in-actuality, since all deal with human actions within a framework conditioned by men and with the vision of men's hopes lighting the future. This comment could properly be taken as the text to guide our consideration of the prob- lems and challenges which the modern social sciences pose. II Science as the touchstone for social analysis came of age at the mid-point in the nineteenth century. Scientific method became an intellectual philosopher's stone, and Turgenev's Bazarev spoke for his generation when he declaimed that the only truth was scientific truth, and that the chemist was more significant than the poet. Auguste Comte published his Cours de philosophie positive in the period I830I842, Marx's Das Kapital appeared in the i86o's, while Charles Darwin's biological theories inspired new efforts to give ethical norms empirical content. The burgeoning cult of the scientist produced an ideology which F. A. von Hayek has termed "scien- tism," a belief in the magic powers of "scientific method" to open the road to truth, and a faith which, in the social sciences, created methodological chaos.3 The social sciences did not enter the methodological revolution entirely unequipped. Both empiricism and the logical classification of data had a tradition stretching back to Aristotle, and the first modern scientific revolution boasted Machiavelli as well as Galileo. In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries scientific empiricism made great strides, and Ernst Cassirer has suggested that the in- 3F.

In the closed and mechanistic universe of the philosophes, there was no sharp distinction between natural and human science, but in political economy the seeds of a distinctive science of society were being sown. The political economists emphasized system and em- piricism, and their "economic" theories were based on specific data and utilized statistical as well as historical techniques. Political economy was still regarded as a moral scienCe, but the effort to pro- vide empirical content for normative statements showed the direc- tion in which the political economists were moving. Since political economy was a moral science, the embryonic scientific tradition showed a humanistic strain, joining with what C. J. H. Hayes has called the tradition of ecumenical liberalism. During the French Revolution, the facts of class exploitation and class struggle-implicit in the writings of political philosophers for centuries-were shouted out by a few intransigents, and the inesti- mable Babeuf went to the guillotine proclaiming the class war. Moral anger joined social analysis to initiate a reform movement which soon numbered Saint-Simon, Fourier, and Robert Owens in its ranks. This movement sought to reform society and thus effect man's regeneration. Its assumptions were pseudo-scientific-proto. scientific would be better-and it backed moral issues by factual analysis of the real world. Karl Marx fully united science and morality. He insisted that society, past and present, functioned according to rational laws which could be proved scientifically. But Marx illumined his theses with flaming indignation, and his wrathful indictment of man's exploit- ing man lifted turgid scientism almost into eloquence. Even so, Marx undoubtedly owed his immediate appeal to the scientific cult. This was certainly true of his leading Russian disciples, the former populist, Plekhanov, and the young Lenin, who found both a method and a plan in Marxism. Marx is supposed to have denied the Marxists, and as the nine- teenth century drew to a close, sober scientists began to question scientism. So much had been claimed for scientific method, so much that was patently unscientific, or non-scientific, was masquerading under the magic label, that it was imperative to rescue scientific</page><page sequence="5">280 THE ANTIOCH REVIEW integrity by rigorous redefinition and analysis. The very faith which gave Marxism and Social Darwinism their immense appeal was challenged. The issue was the nature of social science research itself, its methods and the results which it could legitimately expect. Max Weber gave this problem its final formulation, and with his work the social sciences achieved their modern form. Weber's essential contribution to methodology was one of classi- fication and definition. He insisted that the scholar first determine what could be known and what questions could legitimately be asked of his data, and, unlike his predecessors, he sharply distin- guished ethical and empirical content. Weber classified knowledge as either "existential" or "normative," i.e., "knowledge of what is" and "knowledge of what should be," and he rejected both rigid formulations of natural law and teleological evolutionary principles as concepts which made the "is" and the "ought" one and the same thing. To be valid as sciences, Weber contended, the social sciences must be "ethically neutral" and only pursue the task of reducing a problem to its most rational and internally consistent form.4 The logical outgrowth of Weber's approach was disciplinary compartmentalization. Assumptions and method must vary depend- ing on the natural limits imposed by the phenomena studied and the end which the investigator is seeking. Historical method cannot serve sociology and vice-versa, since each discipline has its own internal logic which depends on the type of data and the questions asked of that data. Weber obviously did not intend this to mean that any one discipline would have universal applicability, for that would have been the ultimate contradiction, nor did he mean that each discipline should be internally self-sufficient and avoid com- munication with other disciplines. He did insist, however, that the method fit the data, and that conclusions only be drawn within that imposed framework. Weber did not kill scientism, but he forced it into new channels. The method which he described implied two interrelated processes, the collection and the systematization of data.5 These processes agree 4See Max Weber, On the Methodology of the Social Sciences, I9; 24-25 f; 51. 5The quantitative aspect in this double process has raised the problem of using quantitative methods where they do not apply, and the further issue of study- ing problems only because they can be analyzed quantitatively. See: von</page><page sequence="6">HISTORY AND SOCIAL SCIENCES 28I superficially with those used in the physical sciences, but as von Hayek has shown, there are marked differences. In the physical sciences, the observation of external nature does not involve the observer's thoughts and reactions as links in the chain of observed events and the classification of data can proceed according to the properties of the observed objects. In the analysis of society, however, the properties perceived include both the properties of the objects themselves and the observer's reaction to those properties. As a result, the systems devised from these observations become abstract realities based on objective reality and take their particular form from the mind or minds which created them. The danger here arises as the "construct" or "system" comes to be regarded as reality, for this tends to divorce the system, now a thing-in-itself, from the objects that it describes. In another connec- tion, Sir Ernest Barker characterized organic theory as a myth which becomes subjective reality, and he warned against "conjuring with metaphor," for to do so in political thinking creates a new and uncontrollable reality. The same caution should be extended to the social scientists. The study of society is the study of individual human beings and their relationships with one another. Society is an ag- glomeration of individuals, and though we may speak of it in anthropomorphic terms, we should remember that we then are dealing in metaphor. The "construct" should exist only to give form to human action and responses, yet it is the construct which tends to become a reality, and the data which completes it is signifi- cant only as a part of the construct. This problem is especially clear to the historian and has affected his work directly. Since the last quarter of the nineteenth century, there has been a growing tendency to deal with historical causation in sociological and economic terms. Great "forces" and impersonal- ized ideas submerge the individual, and historic personalities are Hayek, op. cit., X, 36-38 and Morris Cohen, Reason and Nature, (New York, 1931), 305. Social scientists have deplored the over-emphasis on quantitative technique and empiricism at the expense of theory. See: Joseph Mayer, Social Science Principles in the Light of Scientific Method, (Durham, N.C., 194I); Talcott Parson, The Social System, (Glencoe, Ill., I95I); Edward Shils, op. cit., vi-vii.</page><page sequence="7">282 THE ANTIOCH REVIEW treated only as they are carried along by history's creative stream, while the historian is drawn inexorably from his proper focus, the men who made and participated in events. The decline, until re- cently, of biography as a legitimate field for the historian reflects this unhappy tendency, and it has only been in the last few years that the role of the individual in history has again begun to emerge as the center of historical research. One other point should be made here. To the neophyte, un- initiated into the ritualistic vocabulary of the social sciences, "soci- ology" might well rank with the more esoteric oriental languages. The development of such a specialized vocabulary reflects the nature of the subject matter. Neither the vernacular nor the literary lan- guage suffice. New categories of knowledge have been created which demand a new or drastically revised vocabulary and syntax. This in itself indicates the extent to which the social sciences have created a reality of their own. Specialized vocabulary may be expected in the physical sciences, for the classification of things and the relationships among them are peculiar to that special world. But the social sciences deal with men and men's actions. The new vocabulary in part repre- sents another level of reality which is a projection rather than a reflection of humanity.6 In the past forty years the social sciences have come far in devel- oping methods and techniques, but that development in turn has raised issues at least as important as those which Weber and his associates attacked. As the social scientist has sought impersonality and objectivity, he has dehumanized his data, and his constructs have become a reality removed from the material with which he began. The social scientist is clearly not involved in an unholy con- spiracy to destroy the individual, but his methods have created a barrier between his conclusions and the human data from which those conclusions grow. This may not destroy human integrity, but it most assuredly hurts the pursuit of truth. At this point we 61 do not subscribe to the thesis that this specialized vocabulary is either a mask for incompetence or a great hoax. On the contrary, it represents a basic, and, I suspect, necessary element in social science methodology. The point is that the construct which is artificial comes to be dealt with as though it were reality. The process is short-circuited, the formulation is not drawn back to human reality, and the specialized vocabulary tends to reinforce that tendency.</page><page sequence="8">HISTORY AND SOCIAL SCIENCES 283 should recall Weber's description of the material and purposes of the social sciences: "Every science of psychological and social phenomena is a science of human conduct.... These sciences seek to 'understand' this conduct and by means of this understanding to 'explain' it 'interpretatively."' Leaving entirely aside the emotion- laden attacks on the social sciences, there are tendencies within those sciences which obscure their real purpose. In the following section, speaking from the vantage point of the historian, we will note some specific contributions which may aid the situation. III To analyze human experience assumes either a rational pattern in experience itself or that experience may be made meaningful by establishing artificial categories as a guide to understanding. In practice these assumptions tend to mix, but they are not equal and should not be regarded as equal. Traditionally, the first assumption has underlaid the study of history. Thucydides tells us that he wrote the history of the Peloponnesian war because studying that great event would benefit future generations. The Greek historian saw human nature as a constant and held that while external circum- stances change, human motives and reactions, and, therefore, the pattern of human events, follow a common course. Machiavelli offered a similar thesis and rooted his Florentine history in funda- mental human characteristics which remained constant and were, therefore, predictable. From the early Christian historical tradition, which found both order and the burden of decision in a God-created and God-directed universe, through the eighteenth century and the limited and rational order of the philosophes, to the teleological historicists of nineteenth century romanticism, historical writing has reflected Hegel's dictum that a priori truth can only be known a posteriori, and that the description of past experiences will carry both existential and philosophical meaning. The second assumption differs from the first in that the a priori becomes an explicit part of the method itself. Data are not signifi- cant in themselves, but rather achieve significance as they are organ- ized into a system. The assumption of order is there, but it is made explicit in the process of categorizing material and creating systems. As the first assumption has traditionally been that of history, so the</page><page sequence="9">284 THE ANTIOCH REVIEW second has been a leading characteristic of the new social sciences. Weber emphasized this characteristic when he wrote: The history of the social sciences is and remains a continuous process, passing from the attempt to order reality analytically through the con- struction of concepts-the dissolution of the analytical constructs so constructed through expansion and shift of the scientific horizon-and the reformulation anew of concepts on the formulations thus transformed.7 Granting, indeed affirming, that this process is valid and neces- sary, a fundamental problem remains. The social sciences deal with the totality of human experience and must be concerned with motive and conscquences as well as with the act itself. The social sciences cannot be simply descriptive, empirical, or existential. Scientific truth requires stating accurately phenomenal conditions and relationships. In the social sciences this means dealing with both description and significance. Social scientists have dealt with the first ably and en- thusiastically. With a few notable exceptions, however, they have failed in regard to the second. Mr. Berger suggested that the literati want big problems discussed in a general context where there is room for perpetual debate, and he remarked dryly that nothing stops discussion faster than a fact. But a fact is not an end in itself, and, rather than stopping discussion, it should forward it. The debate is not really between facts and philosophy. The real issue is the way facts are handled and the use to which they are put. We may return at this point to the approaches to the study of society. We have noted that these approaches should be dis- tinguished. Now we may bring them together again. Artificial constructs are admirably suited to arranging descriptive data, i.e., data which tells us about something, but which makes no overt evaluative statements. To make evaluative statements, or statements of significance, there must be criteria for judgment together with a context within which to establish relationships. The cumulative historical record provides both criteria and context. Human history is a vast and ever-shifting kaleidoscope of actions and reactions, as various in its tones and shades as the myriad millions whose experiences compose it. Yet for all its variety, history is not a mere collection of the odd, the unrelated, or the esoteric. 7Weber, op. cit., 40. (my italics)</page><page sequence="10">HISTORY AND SOCIAL SCIENCES 285 Human acts are distinctively rational and are undertaken to achieve specific ends. The irrational and the impersonal condition men's decisions and thereby introduce variables, but these are shades and tints which distinguish rather than differentiate. Historical continuity derives from common challenges and purposeful responses. One such constant has been the continuing search for personal security, a search which has been paralleled by the individual's need to develop his own "proper virtue and ex- cellence." There has been persistent tension between the restraints necessary to security and the human aspiration toward self-fulfill- ment and self-expression. This tension has produced many reactions under differing circumstances and widely separated ideological climates. Yet those reactions provide a pattern. The political martyrs of Tudor England who from the scaffold spoke their faith in crown and country had little but contemporaneity in common with those Muscovites who begged Ivan IV to return and rule them as their absolute sovereign. Both, however, showed that final belief in sov- ereignty and fear of anarchy which lies at the very root of govern- ment and which Hobbes described so graphically. But even where the sovereign was supreme, men sought to reserve a corner for themselves. Thus Sir Thomas More went serenely to his fate, a mutely eloquent protestor of Henry's absolutism, while Prince Kurbsky, from a bitter Lithuanian exile, attacked Tsar Ivan's as- suming ultimate authority. These parallels could be multiplied many times, and they are only a part of history's emergent patterns. Since history reflects purpose and exhibits coherence and con- tinuity, it can serve the social sciences in three ways, and each of these bears on the problem of significance. First, history provides an inexhaustible supply of examples. The record of the past is never entirely clear, and the evidence is often fragmentary and unsatisfactory. But the effort to penetrate the mysteries surrounding specific issues can be vastly rewarding. The political scientist, con- cerned with the methods and procedures of modern dictatorships, could learn much from the Pisitratids, Cola di Rienzo, or even the ambivalent empire of Napoleon III. The social psychologist might well ponder the Florentine response to Savonarola, the self-abase- ment of the Inquisition's victims, or the confessional urge which drove the Russian Decembrists to bare their souls-a phenomenon</page><page sequence="11">286 THE ANTIOCH REVIEW which appeared again at the Moscow purge trials and which neither torture nor Dostoyevsky satisfactorily explains. The use of examples drawn from the past provides corroboration and a check on current conclusions as well as helping to maintain perspective and opening new insights through the use of completed experience. History's second contribution lies in penetrating the process of development. Institutions, patterns of behavior, economic structures, methods of control- all have developed from something which preceded. This truism is too often forgotten. Historicism may be poverty-stricken, naive, misleading, disingenuous, or dangerous, but to damn historicism and then neglect history emasculates under- standing. Recent Soviet technological achievements have shocked the Western world, for almost it seemed that Sputnik sprang full- armed from Khrushchev's forehead. Belatedly, we are gaining some perspective, and recently John Turkevich, in The Atlantic Monthly, explained the Russian scientific tradition inherited by the Soviets and pointed out that these world-shaking discoveries have been the result of a long period of development. To know this does not change the situation, but at least the mystery is dissolved and the problem brought into focus. So also with the issues that the social scientist explores. They are subject to genesis and growth, and un- derstanding the process of growth is essential to understanding the problem. The third contribution goes even deeper, for it leads into the heart of the problem of significance. Significance implies two levels of meaning which may be called immediate and general. Any given fact has meaning, and even an isolated statistic has immediate mean- ing. The assertion that X number of automobiles were produced in October, 1957, conveys specific information about a specific sub- ject, and this notion may be enlarged. It is an established fact, for example, that the sixteenth century saw the beginnings of an east- ward migration in Russia which compared rather strikingly with the westward movement in colonial and post-colonial North America. These are facts of a more complicated structure than a statistical assertion, but they remain only facts exhibiting immediate mean- ing, or meaning in relation to themselves. To provide further dimen- sion, a third example may be noted. Researches in social psychology have established that fear is a basic element in social relations. This</page><page sequence="12">HISTORY AND SOCIAL SCIENCES 287 fact, which is the most complex of those mentioned, still has only immediate significance. Each of the facts mentioned has further implications and these in turn conduce toward a more general descriptive statement concerning actual social phenomena, but a description which exhibits meaning only within a framework of the thing described. General meaning, or general significance, goes beyond any individual discovery or any particular fact. It concerns significance in a universal sense, and it implies a reality which overreaches spatial and temporal limitations. This reality stems from the con- stants in human experience and is defined in terms of universal principles. In turn, universal principles are those aims which have remained constant in human history. We noted before that experi- ence is purposeful and can be understood rationally. It follows that the generalized needs and goals which comprise the larger perspec- tive can also be understood rationally, and history provides the record and the context for that understanding. It has already been suggested that the drive toward freedom and the need for authority provided a common ground for under- standing diverse experiences. Franz Neumann elevated those prin- ciples to the rank of universals and suggested them as a guide to the problem of general meaning. Methodologically his suggestion is a good one, and his explanation of the way in which specific data received general significance as they forwarded or challenged liberty and sovereignty provides a working example of the approach sug- gested here. Neumann noted, among other things, that the advance of universal principles often occurred unconsciously, and he pointed to the legal structure of the German Empire which, while mani- festly nondemocratic, provided the minima for individual security under law. To that degree it advanced and maintained the indi- didual's liberty, and this within a structure which was openly and obviously oriented to the interests of the few rather than the many. The patterns of historical development are a referrent which enables the student not only to gain a larger perspective on his work but also to have a guide to the ultimate meaning of the material he uncovers. This is the most important contribution which history has to offer the social scientist. Historical examples in themselves are use-</page><page sequence="13">288 THE ANTIOCH REVIEW ful, and the sense of process provides developmental perspective. But the introduction of general meaning advances knowledge be- yond the purely descriptive and completes the phenomenal cycle. Human beings act, and as their actions are purposeful, they are also meaningful both in the context of the act and in the larger context of past actions seeking similar goals. By considering the problem of significance in its general sense, the researcher returns to the human framework and to the human values which are the essence of his work. IV At this point we should restate our propositions. First, we accept the validity of Weber's position that method must vary with the nature of the problem. Second, the development of techniques and methodology within this framework represents the modern social sciences' major contribution. Third, this development in itself does not go far enough, and the tendency for new categories of knowl- edge about men to absorb their human data has intensified. Fourth, this tendency can be checked, and the data returned to its human framework, by seeking anew to meet the challenge of meaning in human action, and by utilizing the assumption that experience itself is meaningful. In essence both sets of assumptions which we have laid down should be used. The objective analysis of data, the syn- thesizing and categorizing of that data, and the creation of descrip- tive and analytic systems are essential. The information thus pro- vided should in turn take on meaning as it is related to the constants or universal principles in human development. In this way the rich variety of human experience can be brought into focus, and the science of humanity attain its fullest meaning. One further point needs to be made. The clear implication of the foregoing is that an artificial distinction has become reality, and that the social sciences and the humanities are far closer to- gether than either has been willing to admit. What began as a legitimate distinction in terms of subject matter and limited goals has become a difference in roads to knowledge. Both the social sciences and the humanities seek to provide enlightenment, and both ultimately must be concerned with the definition and analysis of human problems. The approach suggested here re-emphasizes</page><page sequence="14">HISTORY AND SOCIAL SCIENCES 289 their common ground. It should be obvious that the social psy- chologist, the political scientist, the economist, and the historian will deal with their specific problems in the manner most befitting the nature of those problems. But what should be equally clear is that all these provide material which needs to be considered on another level. Perspective, a much abused word but still a good one, is needed, and the continuities of human experience can provide that perspective. This is not to argue that the social scientist should be a professional historian. But it does argue that historical context, in the widest meaning of the term, is necessary to complete the circle of knowledge about men.</page></plain_text>
