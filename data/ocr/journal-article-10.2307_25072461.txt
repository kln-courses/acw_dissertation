<plain_text><page sequence="1">Stages of Moral Development of Corporations B. S. Sridhar Artegal Camburn ABSTRACT. Drawing from the Boulding's (1956) frame work for general systems theory, the need to employ richer paradigm in the study of organizations (Pondy and Mitroff, 1979) is reiterated. It is argued that a better understanding of organizational ethical behavior is contingent upon viewing organizations as symbol processing systems of shared lan guage and meanings. Further, it is proposed that organiza tions, like individuals, develop into collectivities of shared cognitions and rationale, over a period of time. The study adapts Kohlberg's (1983) model of moral development to examine if organizations can be viewed as passing through different stages of moral development depending on the type of moral reasoning employed to explain their behaviors in the face of ethical crises. Several cases raising questions about the ethics of corporate behavior were researched. An instrument entitled Organization Response Analysis was constructed using statements made by various spokespersons representing five of these organizations. The instrument was administered to 246 graduate and undergraduate students of business (N = 246). Results indicated a great degree of concurrence among respondents of differing genders, levels of education and work experience in determining the stages of moral development of organizations. Limitations of the current study and implications for future research and practice are discussed. In this era of global consolidations and strategic alliances, the public is greatly concerned about the B. S. Sridhar, Ph.D., is an Assistant Professor of Management at the College of Business, University of Wisconsin ? Oshkosh. His research interests include transformational leadership, decision making, attribution, business ethics and cross cultural issues. Artegal Camburn, Ph.D., is an Associate Professor of Management at the Harold Walter Siebens School of Business, Buena Vista College in Storm Lake, Iowa. His research interests concern the social responsibility of business and decision making in the areas of business ethics and corporate social responsibility. acquisition and exercise of corporate power. Wit nessing a series of events such as the Valdez disaster, the Solomon Brothers scandal or the BCCI and Lincoln Savings and Loans scandals, the public at large is clearly distressed. Debate rages over ethical responsibility and accountability of organizations. Attempts to influence organizations to be more socially conscious and ethically sensitive requires a good understanding of causes and consequences of corporate behavior. Research in organizational ethics has followed two distinct streams. One has focused on ethical behaviors of agents of organizations. The other has examined behaviors of the agencies. While valuable insights have been obtained, it would be beneficial to explore ways to improve research strategies. Research on agents has examined their ethical behavior as a function of individual difference vari ables such as personal values (Frederick and Weber, 1987) moral reasoning (Deny, 1987), ethical phi losophy (Fritzsche and Becker, 1984), and ideology (McGuire, 1978). While enlightening, this research overlooks the role of organizations for which the agents act. Organizational action is rarely taken without regard to the organizational context. Fre derick and Weber (1987) indicated that organiza tional values may have greater impact on individual behavior than personal values. When one focusses primarily on the behavior of the agent ignoring the larger organizational context, the variance explained is necessarily limited. Research on ethical behavior of the agencies often focuses on the illegal and criminal behaviors of organizations (Clinard, 1983; Cochran and Nigh, 1987; Yeager, 1986). Equating unethical behavior to criminal or illegal behavior has two major draw backs. First, it assumes that being legal is tantamount to being ethical whereas what is legal often repre Journal of Business Ethics 12: 727-739, 1993. ? 1993 Kluwer Academic Publishers. Printed in the Netherlands.</page><page sequence="2">728 B. S. Sridhar and A. Camburn sents a moral minimum. Given the political nature of the legislative process, inertia and resistance to change, laws do not accurately reflect ethical norms of the times. Second, conceptualizing organizations as ". . . an artificial being, invisible, intangible and existing only in contemplation of law" ignores more potent and informative causal forces such as organi zation structures and decision processes which may have a bearing on unethical behavior of organiza tions. As a result of the gaps in research scholars are confronted with several challenging questions. How does one explain the ethical behavior of organiza tions? Where does responsibility for ethical behavior lie? Is it reasonable to expect organizations to be ethical? Or to have feelings and emotions? Can and should corporations have conscience? Do organiza tions engage in "immoral" behavior with prior knowledge as to the "immoral" nature of such action to be held morally responsible (Velasquez, 1983)? Can organizations be expected to develop rationality and respect for others as humans do (Goodpaster and Matthews, 1975)? The objectives of this article are two fold. First, it proposes that a better understanding of organiza tional ethical behavior is contingent upon a richer conceptualization of organizational systems. It is argued that understanding organizational ethical behavior will remain constrained by our paradigms and levels of organizational analysis. Using Bould ing's (1956) framework for General Systems Theory, a richer and more complete paradigm for organiza tions is proposed. Second, it draws parallels between moral development of individuals and of organiza tional learning. Adapting Kohlberg's (1969) stages of moral development, the study examines organiza tional responses to a variety of ethical crises. Results of an empirical study are shared and their implica tions discussed. Organizations as developed social systems Boulding (1956), is his General Systems Theory, identified nine levels of complexity of systems and proposed that models employed to understand these systems should match the complexity of phenomena they seek to study (Figure 1). The hierarchy pro posed, in order of increasing complexity is: Frame Level 9: Systems of Unspecified Complexity Level 7? Symbol nooning System Level 6: Internal Imtge Systems Level 5: Blueprinted Growth Systems Level 4: Opea Systems ^^fc^ Level 3: Control Systems Level 2: Clockworks Level li Fnnewofks Fig. 1. Boulding's Framework for General Systems Theory. works, Clockworks, Control Systems, Open Systems, Blueprinted Growth Systems, Internal Image System, Symbol Processing Systems, Multi-cephalous Sys tems, and Systems of Unspecified Complexity. Frameworks (Level 1) are represented by their static and structural properties. This level of organi zational analysis fails to capture functional and dynamic aspects of organizational behavior. Clock works (Level 2) are simple dynamic systems. Neces sary motions in such a system are predetermined. Organizational response to economic cycles or inno vations in a laissez-faire economy (e.g., price increases, marketing unsafe merchandise or plant closings) are viewed as predetermined. Organizations are seen as passive, compliant entities with little or no autonomy or initiative. Control Systems (Level 3) are cybernetic systems</page><page sequence="3">Moral Development and Corporations 729 that have to respond to externally set criteria or target behavior. These systems consist of two func tions, operation and regulation. Unlike the simple stable equilibrium found in Clockworks, equilibrium in Control Systems is dependent on transmitting and interpreting information between operational and regulatory functions. Behavior of organizations viewed as Control Systems is interpreted with refer ence to externally set norms criteria such as regula tions, industry-wide practice or professional codes of conduct. Open Systems (Level 4) are characterized by their ability to maintain themselves by sucking orderliness from the external environment. While maintaining uniformity is necessary for the equilibrium of Con trol Systems, internal differentiation is necessary for the survival of Open Systems. Blueprinted Growth Systems (Level 5) have the capacity to reproduce themselves, not through cloning but through "genetic pre-programming." In addition to absorbing and processing information from their external environ ment, Internal Image Systems (Level 6) develop a detailed awareness or image of their environment. Symbol Processing Systems (Level 7) are character ized by shared meaning, shared language, symbol transmission systems. Multi-cephalous Systems (Level 8) are social organizations where individuals act in concert and develop shared meanings, shared cul tures and a collective value system. Drawing from the works of organizational theo rists (Thompson, 1967; Lawrence and Lorsch, 1967), scholars of strategic management, corporate social responsibility and business ethics have embraced the Open Systems conceptualization of organizations. As evident from Boulding's Scheme, organizations as systems are far richer than their conceptualization as Open Systems indicates. Drawing from Boulding's (1956) hierarchy, Pondy and Mitroff (1979) point out that the Open Systems model is not adequate to deal with organizations which are much richer and com plex than the level of analysis used. To view organi zational ethical behavior within the legal framework is to diminish organizations into simple cybernetic systems where their effectiveness is judged by their ability to maintain equilibrium in response to exter nally prescribed criteria such as regulations, guide lines and laws. Such a paradigm ignores the rich phenomena of creating and propagating of shared values, meanings and organizational culture that characterize the complex and sophisticated systems that organizations are. Understanding, predicting and influencing organ izational behavior have been greatly facilitated by viewing organizations as more developed systems (Dandridge etal. 1980; Pfeffer, 1981; Smircich, 1983; Weick, 1979). Studies focusing on organizational learning (Argyris and Schon, 1983; Hedberg, 1981), organizational life-cycle (Kimberly and Miles, 1980), organizational decline (Cameron et al, 1987; Whet ten, 1980) represent significant forays beyond the Open System perspective and have contributed to further development of the field. A similar paradigm shift is required to improve our understanding of organizational ethics. The current study is a step in that direction. Stages of moral development Why do individuals differ in how they respond to ethical dilemmas? Expanding on Piaget's (1965) work on cognitive development of individuals, Lawrence Kohlberg (1969) proposed a model of cognitive moral development. According to the model, the ethical justification and moral reasoning underlying individuals' actions depend on their rela tive moral development. Kohlberg's model posits three levels of cognitive development, with two stages nested within each level. The three levels are: pre-conventional, conventional and post con ventional. In the pre-conventional level, individuals view the dilemma in terms of rewards and punishments. What is "right" or "wrong" is judged by individuals with a concern for minimizing personal losses (punishment and obedience orientation) and maxi mizing gains (instrumental orientation). This corre sponds to Kelman's (1958) compliance orientation. In the conventional level, individuals shift their focus to their immediate family or social organiza tions. Moral judgement is based on whether the resulting behavior would be acceptable to socially important others such as members of the family, fraternity, and other social organizations. In Stage III, individuals have as their payoff mutual interpersonal acceptance. In Stage IV, individuals display a law and order orientation. What is "right" is determined by the criteria of preserving social order. Following the</page><page sequence="4">730 B. S. Sridhar and A. Camburn rules, regulations and guidelines is equated with being moral. Kelman (1958) would have termed such behavior conformance or identification. In post-conventional level, individuals look be yond their immediate social organizations. Ethical reasoning is predicated on recognizing of moral duty to the larger society beyond the one's own. Indi viduals define "right" or "wrong" by self-chosen principles which often transcend those of conven tional authorities. While individuals in Stage V recognize the relativistic nature of values and norms, they are willing to reach consensus through democratic discussion and due process. Individuals in Stage VI choose carefully those ethical principles which are logically comprehensive, universal and internally consistent. Few individuals are to be found in Stage VI. Kohlberg's model views the stages as distinct "structured wholes" within which individuals are expected to be consistent in their moral reasoning. Progress through the stages is seen as monotonie. Finally, the model specifies that the stages are hierar chically integrated. This supposes that the thought processes occurring in later stages of moral develop ment employ intellectual tools developed in preced ing stages (Rest, 1975). Kohlberg (1978) suggested that an individual's stage of intellectual development and social and educational climate would facilitate or debilitate one's moral development. In organizational context, a social climate characterized by freedom of thought and communication that encourages discussion and tolerates dissent is expected to create a climate where moral reasoning is facilitated. Kohlberg's model has been subjected to extensive empirical and conceptual validation (Gilligan, 1982; Kohlberg et al., 1983; Snarey, 1985) and has been recognized as a useful framework for understanding ethical development of individuals. This study addresses the following conceptual and empirical questions: Are there parallels between individual learning and organizational learning? More specifically, would it be useful to extend Kohlberg's model to organizations to examine their moral development? Do organizations, like individ uals, pass through stages of cognitive development and moral reasoning? Organizational learning and moral development Piaget (1965) defined learning as a process of crea tion and recreation during which an individual adds appropriate gestalts and logical structures to memory and unlearns those parts which are found to be inappropriate or dysfunctional. Each time a new structure or concept is added to memory, the indi vidual creates a new reality. In that sense, learning is more than developing a repertoire of behaviors learned in a stimulus-response paradigm. The indi vidual, through a process of discovery, comprehends the rational, causal linkages behind the phenomenon and commits those maps to memory for future use. Organizational theorists have discovered several parallels between individual learning and organiza tional learning (Hedberg, 1981). Information pro cessing systems of individuals and organizations are similar (Laszlo, 1972). Levitt and March (1988) proposed that organizations learn by encoding their inferences from history into routines that guide behavior. These routines may include standard operating procedures (Cyert and March, 1963; Simon, 1957), conventions, strategies and technologies. The members of the organization collectively develop a sense of what is right and what is wrong. Organiza tions seek to permeate the values inherent in their meta-physical paradigm, through the socialization and reinforcement. It is this collective development of moral values which define the concept of cor porate responsibility as it applies to organizational action. Corporate learning and development are not dependent on individual actors and these processes are quite capable of surviving turnover of organiza tional members. In that sense, learning is by the organization, not just by the agents. Shared routines, values and paradigms are seen in vastly diversified, often widely geographically dispersed organizations. One case in point is Johnson &amp; Johnson, a $32 billion company employing 83,000 employees work ing in 156 divisions around the globe. Central to Johnson and Johnson's shared vision and purpose is their Credo, a document which influences their priorities and performance. To the extent these shared meanings are transmitted and reinforced across personnel, divisions and countries lends cre dence to the holographic paradigm of organizations (Morgan, 1991).</page><page sequence="5">Moral Development and Corporations 731 Argyris and Schon (1978) proposed that organiza tional learning takes place at two levels. Learning at the primary level, termed single-loop learning, is similar to the learning accounted by the stimulus response models of learning (Cyert and March, 1963; Miles et al., 1974). At the meta level of learning, termed double-loop learning (Argyris, 1990), organi zations not only relearn their actions routines but also re-examine their governing values, norms, and world views. Organizations commit meta level learning to their long term memory through myths, sagas, rituals, and social structures. Organizational learning is transmitted to organizational newcomers through shared meanings and collectively enacted environ ments during socialization processes (Louis, 1980). Therefore, retention and transmission of this learn ing is not as dependent on individual actors as it is on the shared cognitions of coalitions and collectives of organizational members. Organizational learning, like individual learning, may be a function of organizational life cycle. Greiner (1972) proposed a five stage model of organizational development. New learning occurs when organizations move from one stage to another. Each transition presents a major crisis resulting in restructuring the organizations (Greiner, 1972). Shared meanings and interlocked behaviors are reorganized (Weick, 1979). Some scholars propose that such changes in organizing and enacted envi ronments are to some degree related to objective changes in the resource availability and information complexity (Lawrence, 1981; Lawrence and Dyer, 1983). Change in leadership or leadership style can result in organizations learning new paradigms and behaviors and unlearning the dysfunctional aspects of old behavior (Argyris, 1990). The present study explores whether organizations as culture producing and culture propagating enti ties develop different levels of sophistication in justifying and rationalizing organizational action. Organizations are not mere abstract legal entities but collectivities of individuals with shared meanings, shared language, and shared rationale. Depending on the level of sophistication, it should be possible to infer the moral and ethical development of organi zations. It is not proposed that organizations can be treated as possessing one monolithic thought or logic. Arguably, most individuals wrestle with con flicting and contradictory thoughts and feelings. It is not reasonable to expect uniformity when analyzing organizations composed of collectivities of individ uals. However there are considerable theoretical and empirical grounds to propose that organizations over time do develop a shared cognition, rationale and reasoning in explaining their behaviors. Based on this logic, the study employed a novel methodology to determine the organization's stage of ethical development. Method Sample The sample consists of 178 MBA students and 68 undergraduate students of business enrolled at a midwestern regional university. Of the MBA sample, 149 were enrolled in a course emphasizing business ethics and corporate social responsibility. The data were collected during regularly scheduled class ses sions. Instrument The data were collected using the Organizational Response Analysis instrument specifically developed for the study. The authors developed a list of 15 incidents which have, in recent times, served as tests of corporate ethical behavior (Table I). Forty three students enrolled in two sections of an MBA course emphasizing business ethics and corporate social responsibility assisted in the construction of the instrument. These students who were not part of the test sample, were introduced to Kohlberg's (1969) model of moral and ethical development. Further, they were administered the Defining Issues Test (Rest, 1986) to familiarize them with process of categorizing statements of moral reasoning into stages of Kohlberg's model. Students were organized into teams of three and were assigned one of the incidents listed in Table I for detailed research. The teams researched major periodicals and local publications to find out what company spokespersons said to defend their organi zation's action or inaction. Teams produced a list of</page><page sequence="6">732 B. S. Sridhar and A. Camburn TABLE I List of Organizational Cases Used in Content Analysis 1. AH. Robbins and Dalkon Shield 2. Arthur D.

Students, working individually, analyzed content and ranked the statements collected by their teams to determine the degree of importance the organiza tion attached to a given argument or justification. Each team member further analyzed the statements and scaled them using Kohlberg's (1969) stages as the frame of reference. If more than one statement belonged to a stage, the statements were clustered at that stage. Following the independent analysis and ranking by team members, each team collectively, through consensus, ranked the statements or justifications in order of importance to the company. Each statement was categorized into one of six stages. The six cate gories developed for the instrument, paralleling Kohlberg's (1969) six stages of moral development of individuals are: Stage I Avoiding harm to one's own organiza tion. Stage II Gaining benefits for one's own organi zation. Stage III Conforming to norms/practices of the industry. Stage IV Conforming to existing laws and regu lations. Stage V Recognizing obligations to society. Stage VI Upholding universal principles. The teams' reports provided their rationale for the ranking and categorizing the statements. The Organization Response Analysis instrument was constructed using five of the 15 cases analyzed by the student teams. The cases were selected for high degree of clarity and consensus found during the content analysis. The five cases selected were those of Arthur D. Little, Burroughs Wellcome, Drexel Burnham-Lambert, Lincoln Savings and Loan and Miami Herald. Respondents were provided with a brief descrip tion of each case followed by a set of five quotations attributed to various company spokespersons. Re spondents were required to carefully read each state ment and classify it into one of the six categories listed above. Respondents were required to judge each quotation for a case independently, and to complete one case before proceeding to the next case. It was emphasized that there were no "right" or "wrong" answers, and that they should work at their own pace. The instrument also collected demographic infor mation such as age, gender, length of work experi ence, and level of education. It is important to establish the extent to which the ratings assigned to the organizations are influenced by gender or length of work experience. It can be speculated that female respondents are likely to react differently to the controversy over the pricing of AZT given the widespread misperception that males and homo sexuals are more likely to be victims of AIDS. Similarly, one can argue that the severity of ratings can be a function of respondents exposure to the "real world". In validating a new instrument it is important to tease out differences which can be attributed such demographic factors. Results Demographics are listed in Table II. The mean age of the sample was 28.18 years (standard deviation = 5.61) with no significant age difference between the genders. The undergraduates were significantly younger (t = 10.71, p &lt; 0.0001) and had relatively less work experience (t = 1.85, p &lt; 0.1) than their graduate counterparts.</page><page sequence="7">Moral Development and Corporations 733 TABLE II Demographic Profile of the Sample Frequencies, means and standard deviations by Gender and class rank n Mean Standard Test Deviation Statistic Age Female Male MBA (Ethics) MBA (Gen) Undergraduate Experience Female Male MBA (Ethics) MBA (Gen) Undergraduate *** p &lt; 0.005 The stage of moral development of organizations can be measured either as a continuous variable or as a discrete variable. Although Kohlberg expounded his model in terms of stages his writings suggest an implied ordinal conceptualization. There is theo retical rationale for either approach. Since develop mental models are based on the assumption that progression of individuals and organizations from one stage to the next is continuous, and that stages follow a certain sequence, one can treat the variable as a continuous. On the other hand, because stages represent discrete levels of development ("structured whole") and certain individuals and organizations can remain at those levels for extended periods of time, one can treat the variable as categorical. The study analyzed the data in both these modes.

Little's response to the toxic disposal crisis was viewed as representing advanced moral development. Respondents, regardless of their gen der, level of education, exposure to ethics courses, and length of work experience assigned Arthur D. Little to Stage V, reflecting the social contract orientation (xl ? 87.91; p &lt; 0.005). Relative to respondents enrolled in the MBA course emphasiz ing ethics, other MBAs and undergraduates were more conservative in assessing Arthur D. Little's responses to the toxic waste disposal dilemma (F2,243 = 2.46; p &lt; 0.1). This difference did not translate into their ranking Arthur D. Little to a lower stage of moral development. No gender differences were observed either in the classification or the mean ratings assigned to Arthur D. Little. Statements issued by Burroughs Wellcome in response to the furor over pricing AZT were seen by respondents as typical of Stage II, reflecting instrumental orientation (xl = 185.11; p &lt; 0.005). Respondents in all class ranks and both genders uniformly classified Burroughs Wellcome to Stage II. The x2 statistic ranged from 28.44 for MBAs enrolled in courses other than business ethics to 112.17 for MBAs enrolled in the ethics class. The mean rating assigned to Burroughs Wellcome was 2.98 (standard deviation = 0.84) on a six point scale. No significant differences in ratings were observed among respondents who differed in class rank (F2,24o = 1-92) or length of work experience (^1,124 = 2.07). Although males were significantly more critical of Burroughs Wellcome than the females (t238 = 2.19; p &lt; 0.10), both assigned the organization to Stage II of moral development (xl = 126.72;^ &lt; 0.005). Similar consistency was observed in how respond ents perceived Drexel, Burnham &amp; Lambert's re sponse to charges of insider trading. Statements by Drexel's spokespersons were viewed as reflecting a self focused orientation aimed at avoiding harm to one's organization [xl = 132.11; p &lt; 0.005). While the x2 statistic for classification varied, relatively high values were observed for MBAs in the ethics course (xl ? 71.93; p &lt; 0.005) and males (xl - 88.53; p &lt; 0.005). Other MBAs, undergraduates and females were relatively less categorical in classifying the firm to Stage I. Drexel received a mean rating of 2.37 (standard deviation = 0.63). Undergraduate respondents were significantly more severe in their mean rating of Drexel's moral development (t243 = 1.7\;p &lt; 0.088). Similarly, the respondents in general classified Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan to Stage I, suggesting that the organization responded to the crisis predomi nantly from a self-protection orientation (x\ = 315.26; 5; p &lt; 0.005). MB As in the ethics course (%\ - 210.22; p &lt; 0.005) and males (x\ = 212.34; p &lt; 0.0001) were relatively more unequivocal in classify ing Lincoln Savings to Stage I than other respondent groups. However, the undergraduate respondents were relatively lenient in their assessment (t242 = 2.74, 242; p &lt; 0.007) compared to those in the MBA program. This relative leniency did not cause them to rank Lincoln Savings and Loan to any stage higher than Stage I (%\ = 59.07; p &lt; 0.005). The respondent's assessment of the Miami Herald's handling of the Senator Gary Hart-Donna Rice affair does not present the clear consistency observed in four other cases. When analyzed at the aggregate level, respondents viewed the organization as be longing to Stage III (x\ - 76.29; p &lt; 0.005) where the main rationale for behavior is based on conform ity to industry-wide norms. Except for undergrad uate respondents, the sample viewed the behavior of the Miami-Herald as belonging to Stage III. Under graduates classified the behavior as belonging to Stage I (x\ ? 16.90; p 0.005). When the mean assess ment scores were compared, no significant differ ences between genders or lengths of work experience were observed. In summary, the moral development of the above five organizations, measured either by mean scores or by frequencies of assignment to stages, was assessed in the same way, yielding the same results. In increasing order of moral development, the organizations (mean assessment scores, standard deviations and modal stages is parentheses in that order) are: Lincoln Savings and Loan (1.98, 0.89; Stage I), Drexel, Burnham and Lambert (2.37, 0.63; Stage I), Burroughs Wellcome (2.98, 0.84; Stage II), Miami Herald (3.15, 0.79; Stage III) and Arthur D. Little (3.95, 0.89; Stage V). Discussion This paper presented a case for studying the ethical conduct of organizations through a richer concep</page><page sequence="10">736 B. S. Sridhar and A. Camburn tualization of the organizations. Drawing upon Boulding's (1956) framework for general systems theory it was suggested that organizations as symbol processing, culture producing and sharing entities are more akin to humans in their growth and devel opment of cognition. The paper shared the results of a study employing an instrument, Organizational Response Analysis, developed to determine the stage of moral development of organizations. It proposed that Kohlberg's (1969) model of moral development can be adapted to study whether organizations, like individuals, pass through different stages of moral development. The following discussion is organized into three sections. First, benefits and desirability of a richer conceptualization of organizations as evidenced in this study are examined. Second, issues relating to the validity and reliability of the Organizational Response Analysis instrument are addressed. Finally, implications for future research and practice are explored. It was proposed that the behavior of organizations can be better understood by adapting the paradigms used to understand cognitive and moral develop ment of organizational agents. Moral development of individuals has been measured by the type of rationale used to explain their ethical or unethical behavior. Pondy and Mitroff (1979), while advocat ing a richer paradigm to understand organizations, suggested the study of organizational language. Pondy (1977) pointed out that organizations can be thought of as "jargon groups," and this shared language facilitates meaning creation, perceptions, communication, social influence and control in or ganizations. To what extent do the concept of corporate responsibility and moral development represent an overextended anthropomorphic conceptualization of organizations? Is it valid to say that only individuals can have morals and sense or responsibility? Are corporations more abstract legal entities to whom one cannot apply the notions of morality and responsibility? The results from this study give sufficient justification for one to examine the cor porate action within a broader context. Each crisis listed in the instrument called into question the organizational action or inaction. Or ganizations justified the legitimacy of their decisions and practices. As disturbance handlers and spokes persons, the Chief Executive Officers and other company managers provided their rationale to their internal and external constituents. Company spokes persons were consistent in the way they enacted their crisis and interpreted the events based on a logic and rationale shared by their organizations. The consistency of response across personnel and time lends credence to the idea of organizations as systems which develop meaning from their environ ments (i.e. learning) and store and share this meaning with actors in the organizations. The meanings shared among organizational agents were perceived with a great degree of fidelity and consistency across respondents. With the excep tion of the Miami Herald's handling of the Gary Hart-Donna Rice affair, respondents classified or ganizations with a high degree of consensus. In the other four cases, respondents agreed consistently and uniformly. Analyses at both aggregate and sub-sample levels revealed a consensus in classifying Arthur D. Little and Burroughs Wellcome to Stages V and II, respectively and both Drexel, Burnham &amp; Lambert and Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan to Stage I. In the Miami Herald's reporting of the Hart-Rice affair, MBA respondents saw in the Herald's justifi cation a social contract orientation, characteristic of Stage V, and recognized the newspaper's obligation to society as a strong rationale, second only to its need to conform to industry norms (Stage III). Even undergraduates who saw in the Herald's rationale a strong motivation to avoid harm to self, were able to detect social contract orientation as a rationale following conformance motivation. All five cases taken together, the study supported the view that organizational action or inaction can be better understood when they are conceptualized as being more organic and social entities than the lower level of conceptualizations employed so far. The Organizational Response Analysis instrument developed for the study incorporated five recent cases of corporate action which were deemed con troversial and ethically questionable. The instru ment, developed along the lines of the Defining Issues Test (Rest, 1986), was constructed using the most salient of the actual statements made by spokespersons on behalf of their organizations, ensuring a high face validity. The items for the instrument were selected based on high inter-rater agreement.</page><page sequence="11">Moral Development and Corporations 1YI A threat to validity may arise when using actual cases. Criminal and civil convictions against well known organizations such as Lincoln Savings and Drexel, Burnham &amp; Lambert have received greater media exposure, which in turn can result in greater severity in respondent ratings and classification. While actual cases can provide greater relevance and credibility, fictitious cases may control for polariza tion due to politicization and media coverage of incidents. The instrument permits treating the data as either a continuous or a discrete variable. The latter treat ment presents considerable limitations on the rigors of analysis. The most robust statistical analysis of data used the x2 statistic which is very sensitive to sample size. A relatively higher value of the statistic cannot be clearly interpreted controlling for the sample size. The procedure is useful as a first cut. In contrast, treating the data as a continuous variable allows for better control for sample size and standard error. Several statistics such as Student's t and F ratios, are available to compare the results across samples. In the current study, a high degree of consistency was found across samples in how organi zations were categorized into stages of moral devel opment. This observed consistency was further supported by the t and F test procedures which treated the variable as continuous. Finally, given the high correlation between the mean ratings and discrete stage scores (r = 0.96, p &lt; 0.0009), it is recommended that data be analyzed both as a continuous and a discrete variable. The results from the study can help in identifying directions for future research. While constructing an instrument to study the language and logic may be a small departure, it retains the baggage of "brute force of empiricism." While traditional questionnaires, large sample surveys and multivariate analysis are important, ethical behavior and ethical development of organizations are better understood through ab stract model-building and ethnographic techniques. While much of the progress achieved by human species and human organizations has been attributed to language, not all communication is overt and at the conscious level. Myths, symbols and organiza tional sagas have a great impact in creating and transmitting meanings in the organization. Study of such phenomena is better facilitated by employing ethnographic, qualitative research designs. Future research should examine a number of situations and issues faced by each organization and analyze statements and rationale offered by per sonnel at different levels and divisions of the organi zation. Multiple issues separated in time, focus and personnel need to be sampled to more reliably determine the stage of moral development of the organization. From a practitioner's perspective, research which views organizations as culture producing entities has considerable importance. Ethics often has been defined as involving moral judgements made against moral standards: Moral reasoning is facilitated within organizations to the extent the moral standards are understood, shared, reinforced, and monitored for compliance. Instruments such as the organizational response analysis are likely to serve as diagnostic tools to determine the extent to which there is consensus, consistency and communication within the organization. Jim Burke, former CEO of Johnson &amp; Johnson, while commenting on how they dealt with the Tylenol crisis, credited their Credo for ensuring consistency and unity of thought and action in the organization. Continually improved and validated instruments will enable corporate managers and trainers to identify changes needed in such areas as training, communication processes, reward structures, and informational systems. In summary, further research in the area should benefit both theory building and application.
