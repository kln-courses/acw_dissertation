<plain_text><page sequence="1">IRVING H. ANELLIS PERUN'S REVENGE: UNDERSTANDING THE DUX O VN A JA KUL'TURA In the PovesV vremennykh let', the chronicler describes the conversion of the Russian people.1 In 988, Vladimir the Great, Prince of Kiev, ordered the conversion of the populace to Christianity, and their wholesale baptism in the Dniepr. As a prelude, he ordered the destruction of the pagan idols. Perun, ancient Slavic thunder god and creator of fire, was accorded special treatment. His idol was humiliatingly dragged to the banks of the Dniepr by horses, flogged, and thrown into the river. Below the falls of the Dniepr, at a place called 'Perun's shore', it finally was washed up onto the shore. This forcible immersion of the most important of the pagan deities may be called Perun's 'Baptism'. Perun's Revenge is the so-called dvoeverie or 'double faith' of the ancients, the intrusion of pagan elements into the duxovnaja kul'tura of the people, and their resistance to pravoslavie (Orthodoxy, or 'right praising').2 In the folk mind, the 'baptism' of Perun represents the fusion of pagan and Christian elements, the dvoeverie. But there is a deeper sense in which it can be understood as a tripartite blend of pure Orthodoxy, pure Slavic paganism, and the synthetic double faith of the ancients, in which pagan context occurs with Orthodox structures (or forms, obraza). In fact, Perun is outwardly suppressed, we may say, psychologically, repressed, and obliterated from the folk consciousness; but then he is all the more dominant and imperative within the depths of the folk psyche, lingering the more active within the subconscious, and being experienced and expressed by what Gorbacev called razorvannost'soznanija, split or sundered consciousness.3 The underlying, subconscious, presence of the pagan heritage, as it comes to the surface at times when the razorvannost' soznanija becomes disturbed, pushes "wooden Perun, with a head of silver, and a mustache of gold" into prominence, but not yet into explicit conscious recognition.4 The Slovo o polku Igoreve, its translator Nabokov reminds us, is a 'pagan poem', its author possessed of "a fondness for pagan gods", although it must have been written in 1187 at the very earliest.5 Several of Perun's pagan cohorts are mentioned in the Slovo, but Perun himself remains unmentioned.

ANELLIS appropriate, the Christian God is named instead (by either the author of the Slovo or, more likely, a monastic copyist in a succeeding age), although he is alluded to clearly once in terms of thunder and "blue lightning" ("v nix trepescut sinii molnd": "in them throbs-blue lightning", and adding "There is to be a great thunder").6 In fact, there is a mixture of the pagan and the Christian in the Slovo. Such a mixture is a constant feature of the duxovnaja kul'tura which expresses the razorvannost' soznanija of Perun's revenge. The dominance of Perun within the depths of the folk psyche does not occur only in late twelfth or thirteenth century byliny. Historically, this dominance is attested to by historians and sociologists who found pockets of pure paganism well into the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, even the mid-nineteenth century, as the populist v narod' movement found, and in remote scattered enclaves, as late as the revolution and civil war in the twentieth century. It is also attested to by the ease with which post-revolu tionary Russia, and particularly the revolutionary proletariat of Petrograd and Moscow, dropped its orthodoxy and left its priests (see, for example, the journalistic impression of John Reed, speaking about the 'Red Burial' in Moscow, "as the throng passed the Iberian Chapel, where always before the passer-by had crossed himself, they did not seem to notice it .. . "; that "the devout Russian people no longer needed priests to pray them into heaven").7 In Igor, the thunder and blue lightning foretell the defeat of the Christian forces at the hands of the pagan Polovci (Kumans). Here, Perun appears on the side of the enemies of Orthodoxy, an aspect of Perun's revenge. If pagan elements survived, even though transfigured, in Russian Ortho doxy, it is because there is, in fact, enough in Eastern Orthodoxy that appeals to the spiritual sentiment or duxovnosf of the pagan Slav to permit accom modation to Orthodoxy and engage a disharmonious blend or fusion of pagan and Christian elements. There is, for example, the fusion, or confusion, of the Slavic Mat' Syrazemlia, the Earth Mother, with the Christian Madonna. In fact the cult of the Mother of Christ became the strongest of Orthodox reverential attachments. There is a close connection of Perun, the thunder god and creator of fire, with both the fires of Satan and the Orthodox coming of Christ to "baptize with the Holy Ghost and with fire". As Christmas approached Russians were wont to produce 'furnace shows' depicting the rescue of Shadfach and his friends from Nebuchadnezzar's fire (with real fire being used, as Billington reminds us).8 Fire is a continuous theme in the history of the duxovnaja kul'tura, from Perun, creator of fire, to self-immolating</page><page sequence="3">PERUN'S REVENGE 3 raskoVniki, to the saving of Moscow and the defeat of Napoleon by fire, to the fires of revolution impressed into the fiery red flag of the Soviet Union. Coupled with fire is the axe, the weapon of Perun; the axe, the thunderhead from which Perun sent forth his fire as lightening, became in time the sickle of the m??iki and the hammer of the workers, but was likewise the weapon of justice and the weapon of rebellion, from Bolotnikov's Rebellion to the Civil War, and rocks found at the site of trees destroyed by lightening were venerated as bits of Perun's axehead. (The association in Igor of a rain of arrows with the thunder and lightening does not negate the connection of the axe as Perun's weapon; however, a few lines later, and thereafter, arrows are associated with Perun's close cohort, Stribog, the wind god.)9 The continua tion of pagan symbolism is reflected also in the substitution of the Christian icon for the pagan idol as an object of reverence, and the later substitution of the iconic portraits of the Tsar, and later, of Marx, Lenin, Stalin, and their successors for religious icons. There is something of idol worship and dziady worship in the Stalinist 'Cult of Personality', which was carried through to modern times from pagan times through the idolization of the tsar as Batjulka. The preservation and display of Lenin's body has its roots in the Trzna or Radunica of Dziadij of the pagan Slavs, carried through the venera tion of saints and holy relics into the present. The v narod' movement found, in their mid-nineteenth century pilgrimage into the country, that the invoca tions of the peasantry to God was in fact a version of pagan incantations appropriate to the animistic cosmology of the pagan Slavs, in which God comes to man not only through icons and holy men, but in the spirits of the forests and rivers. Christian prayer is an incantation, then, an avoidance of the feared naklikanie. Thus, the Slavic duxovnost' is tenacious and deeply rooted, so that Orthodox elements can survive in this context only through the distortion of Orthodox content into pagan symbolism, into pagan structure, and later is preserved in the atheistic partijnost' that replaces Christianity. Perun, then, is baptized, is superficially Christianized. It is in this sense that we must understand Kovner's claims to Dostoevsky that "a good sixty million of them [the Russian people] live literally like animals and don't have the slightest rational understanding either of God or Christ or of the soul or its immortality"; that they "continue to live without any idea of Christianity (I am not, of course, referring to the ritualistic side) and are no way different from pagans", though they call themselves krest'janin.10 Orthodoxy thus remains a foreign excrescence, a superficial Byzantine</page><page sequence="4">4 IRVING H. ANELLIS filigree embedded into native spirituality, embedded into duxovnosf. Orthodox sentiment survived as long as it did only because (1) it was imposed by authority, and (2) it was in time sufficiently acculturated to appeal to the native sense of aesthetic, spiritual (and historical) reality. But it remained foreign, Byzantine, Platonistic, rational, metaphysical. Thus, its survival depended upon subversion and coercive state authority, aided by cultural inertia. "Orthodox Christianity", wrote Boris Pil'nyak, "came along with the tsars, with an alien power, and the people went away from it ? into sectarian ism, became sooth-sayers".11 Orthodoxy, then, is foreign both in its Greek origin and Varangian imposi tion, and in its spiritual character and content, its half-assimilated, half digested confrontation with the native spirituality of pagan izbanaia Rus'. There is a contrast between the imposed xitrosf (skill, guile, form) of official orthodoxy and the pravda of native duxovnosf. So Stavrogin, and through him, Dostoevsky, like countless other Russians, preferred Christ, as repre sentative of pravda (or pravda-spravedlivosf) to God the Father, as istina, if the two are not the same, a choice reiterated in the parable of the Grand Inquisitor in the Brothers Karamazov. This in fact expresses a choice of duxovnosf or spiritual freedom on the side of Christ, that is, a Christ-Satan who represents Perun, over Orthodoxy, or pravoslavie, which represents the authoritarian order of the Byzantine-Varangian heritage of God the Father, which the Grand Inquisitor represents for Dostoevsky. There are several aspects to this contrast. On the one side, that of duxovnosf, and of the Christ-Satan, Perun, there are the traditionalists, the irrationalists, the symbolists, the realistic naturalists (sensualists), the faithful, the mystical, the humanists (or hylozoistic anthropomorphists), which may be characterized as Prometheanism; on the other side, that of Orthodoxy and of God the Father, there are the modernists, the rationalists (or intellectualists ? which is not to claim, certainly, that the duxovniki, by contrast, were illiterate or stupid; quite the contrary, many of the Old Believer, or Raskol'nik, thinkers were leading exponents of their view, and their secularized heirs, such as Dostoevsky, certainly were immensely gifted; it is simply a case of duxovniki rejection of 'Aristotelian categories' and acceptance of a 'higher reality': it is in fact precisely the intelligentsia that represents duxovnaja kul'tura most faithfully), the formalists or purists, the metaphysicians, the legalists, which may be characterized as Philistinism.12 The RaskoV, rooted in the reform movement of the Grecophile Patriarch Nikon, and his opponent, the dissident nativist</page><page sequence="5">PERUN'S REVENGE 5 schismatic Archpriest Awakum, represented a perelom in Orthodox church history that expressed the dvoeverie within Orthodoxy. In the end, the Orthodox Church kept a precarious balance by repudiating both the Nikonian reforms and the consequent raskoV (in a 1666?1667 Church Council called, and dominated, by the state, by Tsar Alexei). Two hundred and fifty years later, in 1917, the government of Lenin was able to obtain a new balance within the dvoeverie, which had become politicized by the Petrine abolition of the Patriarchate and the establishment of the Holy Synod in its place, as a department of State, by discarding the Orthodox Church altogether and attempting an atheistic version of synthesis between [Marxist-Bolshevik] orthodoxy and duxovnosf, as partijnost'.13 In fact, Bolshevism itself is something of a synthesis of the dvoeverie, uniting within itself the traditions of orthodoxy as rationalist, formalist, metaphysicalist (for materialism is a metaphysical position), legalist, modernist, Westernizing and alien (German, as Marxist), and those of duxovnosf, as irrational, symbolistic, sensualist, mystical, humanist, traditionalist, Slavophile (and orientalizing), and native, but turned from religion to politics in all its spheres of activity, and in its religious zeal and eschatological Messianism reaching for a utopia, a (secular) New Jerusalem, as were all the political movements of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries in Russia. If 1668 was a perelom in Russian church history, then 1721 was its culmination. If the Council of Alexei began a process of politicizing the Church, then the creation of the Holy Synod by his son Peter in 1721, in which the Church became a department of State, completed its politicization. Thus, the religious aspects of the Nikon-Avvakum dvoeverie were brought together in opposition within the framework of political ideological opposi tion. Spiritual rebels were indistinguishable, in the years after 1721, from political rebels. Thus, duxovnaja kul'tura took on a wider aspect, and involved the political wrangles and anti-monarchist movements of the nineteenth century with duxovnyj, that is, with its religious, eschatological Messianic temperament, and gave it its Prometheanism. In choosing Christ, i.e. the duxovnosf of Perun as Christ-Satan over God ?sima, Dostoevsky chose spiritual freedom in its widest sense, as a rejection of religious pravoslavie, the Orthodoxy of the official Church, and of political pravoslavie, the autocracy of the State. It is not, despite the ultra-conserva tivism, the friendship with Pobedonoscev and influence over the tsarevic and his appointment as tutor of the grand dukes, of Dostoevsky, a conflict within</page><page sequence="6">6 IRVING H. ANELLIS Dostoevsky's choice of duxovnosf over pravoslavie ? Dostoevsky's ultra conservative 'Orthodoxy' was very unorthodox by the standards of the white clergy, by the standards of the official Church, and even of the official autocracy. This choice, then, expresses a relation between duxovnosf and sobornost'. "There is", says PU'nyak's Donat, "but one rule ? our spiritual conscience and brotherly customs".14 Along similar lines, Red Army Marshall M. N. Tuxacevskij is reported to have said: I've never much cared for the dirty, hairy and ignorant priests who crop up so often in our history. As far as I'm concerned, Vladimir the Holy wasted his time when he brought Christianity to Russia. Our people have a tremendous primitive energy - they should have been allowed to keep it!15 The first sentence expresses well the sentiments of the bespopovci elements of the RaskoT; the remainder expresses the survival of pagan Perun, with the last sentence in particular expressing the Promethean element of Perun's Revenge. Tuxacevskij's words should serve as the credo for Perun's Revenge. Sobornost' is the personal aspect oiduxovnosf \ sobornost'is the communal striving of absolutely autonomous individuals towards duxovnosf, towards the New Jerusalem, which is at once sacred and secular, prophetic and profane, an attempt to close the gap of dvoeverie, of the razorvannost' soznanija, which was first introduced by the baptism of Perun. In its politici zation, duxovnosf, in its narrowest sense, religioznosf, has created a new dvoeverie, a smesconnaja religioznosf. Now the two aspects of dvoeverie come together and seek a reconciliation of both political and spiritual-moral duxovnosf as sobornost', within which is sought a reunification between pravoslavie, in both of its senses, on one side, and duxovnosf, in both of its senses, on the other side. The raskol', then, is an enduring feature of Russian cultural history, of duxovanaja kul'tura. The duxovniki, of whom Awakum is but one, religious, representative, Dostoevsky another, are traditionalists, who wish to preserve the liturgy and sacraments as handed down by the past generations ? irra tionalists, who wish to preserve the emotional content of the ancient religion, who reject xitrosf, skill, as krivda, evil and the 'cursed logic' of Aristotle (so that we should not be surprised when non-Euclidean geometry is introduced by the pre-revolutionary Nikolai Lobacevskij, that A. N. Kolmogorov should be the first, in the post-revolutionary period, to formalize intuitionistic calculus and introduce the concept of psevdoistinnosf into</page><page sequence="7">PERUN'S REVENGE 7 logic, that pre-revolutionary N. A. Vasil'ev and post-revolutionary A. A. Zinov'ev should both be pioneers of a non-standard, particularly multiple valued, logic, which is clearly non-linear, and which Vasil'ev would characterize as non-Aristotelian, while the dialectical analysis of mathematics should be the characteristic feature of Soviet mathematics and the novelist Zamyatin, himself a scientist, in the post-revolutionary period make non-Euclidean geometry and non-linear logic the special hallmark of his version of duxovnosf' as Scythianism, while E. C. Barksdale suggested that Dostoevsky "took from the climate of his day the concept rooted in the works of the Russian mathematician Nikolay Lobachevsky: that the world could be described in non-Euclidean terms" and "foresaw that a description of the universe founded on Newtonian physics and Euclidean geometry, while it would not be wrong, would be incomplete", a view which is decidedly that of Zamyatin; nor should we be surprised, by the same token, when the neduxovniki, Belinskij and CernySevskij, sought to reduce all reality to the formula 2X2 = 4),16 the symbolists, for whom the details of ritual have spiritual significance, for whom the question of whether one crosses oneself with two fingers rather than three means salvation, the realist-naturalists, or sensualists, who seek the mystical and human, for whom passion means salvation, the podvi?niki who are "they who have seen" (the smotrelivy). The 'Orthodox', of whom Nikon is one, Pushkin and ?erny?evskij others, are modernists, who aimed at correcting accumulated errors and the accretions and excrescences of the ages, to return to the standard, the rationalists, intellectualists, who sought to apply their scholarship to purify ancient corrupted texts and traditions, the formalists, for whom structure rather than accidentals of content, was the essence of pravoslavie, the metaphysicians, who sought the divine, the theoretical, istina, God, rather than the human, the legalists, the bearers of authority. Translated into artistic terms there is an inverse correlation between the orthodoxy of one's beliefs and the duxovnye expression of one's philosophy; this phenomenon, which shall be examined, led Vladimir Nabokov to conclude that "the more radical a Russian was in politics, the more conser vative he was on the artistic side".17 So Dostoevsky's choice of Christ over istina is also a choice for the anthropomorphic and mystical over the meta physical, the theoretical. Again, we identify Perun, then, with Christ-Satan, as anthropomorphic hylozoism is superficially mutated, in the baptism of Perun, into anthropomorphic iconism, God-as-Christ. But the duxovnik's Christ is baptized Perun in disguise, as Christ-Satan. "You are not the first to reduce</page><page sequence="8">8 IRVING H. ANELLIS faith to a sense of touch", Nabokov's Chateau says, seemingly bringing together the anthropomorphism, hylozoism, sensualism, iconism, and idolatry of both the pagan's Perun and the Christian's Christ.18 So we recall once more, necessarily, PU'nyak's S?'vestr, who, Edwards tells us, writes about "pagan Russia and its beliefs and customs which . .. Christianity has never replaced".19 The years 988, 1666-1667, 1721, and 1917-1921, each marked a pere lom, a decisive watershed, in the history of the duxovnaja kul'tura, and each has political as well as religious significance: 988 marked the beginning of the dvoeverie by the baptism of Perun; 1666?1667 saw the first substantial attempts at Caesaropapism, and its culmination in 1721 made the tsar the head of the Orthodox Church; 1917?1921 marked the dismantling of the Church. Each step brought religioznosf increasingly closer to politics; each took duxovnosf closer towards secularization. This meant that spiritual and political freedom - duxovnosf opposed to pravoslavnosf ? became increasingly inseparable and indistinguishable. The role of the volxvi in resistance to orthodoxy was gradually taken over from the shaman, and later, from the schismatic clergy, by a secular intelligentsia, an intelligentsia which, at first, remarkably, ironically, was created and trained by Orthodoxy in the academies first established by Peter and Anne for the propogation of tsarist Orthodoxy and for the preparation of servants of the State. The influence of the academies in the cultivation of the intelligent-revolutionary became, thereafter, and certainly in the late nineteenth century, the dominant feature of political life. This intelligentsia, by the nineteenth century, expressed, in secular forms, every crucial position and aspect of the dvoeverie, as Slav ophilism, Westernism, Nihilism, Narodnikism (Populism, i.e. Peasant Social ism), Marxism, Menshevism, Bolshevism. We cannot claim, then, that only one political, social, or economic solution was offered by the duxovniki as a palliative for Orthodoxy, or that the intelligentsia were united by one ideology. (Turgen'ev's Otci i deti, for example, offers a glimpse of one small aspect of the struggle of ideologies between the old liberal intelligent and the younger, more radical razno?inci-intelligent.) What they all, or very nearly all, had in common, however, was a religious fervor, and concomitant rejection of meS?anstvo, compromise, bezidejnosf, which they inherited from their predecessors, the raskoVniki, and the even more ancient carriers of the duxovnaja kul'tura, the earthy volxvi and priests of Perun, the narod\ They are, in fact, fanatics, podvi?niki, carrying a pathological, zealous</page><page sequence="9">PERUN'S REVENGE 9 abhorrence of posredstvennosf, mediocrity, or me^canstvo, (bourgeois) philistinism. By the late nineteenth century, the universities were the seats of student revolutionaries and the hosts to sedition, in sharp contradistinction to the stated aims of their founders, the tsarist government and his ministers of education, as the training ground for the civil bureaucracy of the autocrat, and severe restrictions were placed upon their curricula and students in the Nicholaevan and Alexandrine period. Quite naturally, the most complete expression of any ideology during these years was that of conservative Ortho doxy. And quite naturally, too, the most complete expression of conservative Orthodoxy was to be found in Constantine Pobedonoscev, Over-Procurator of the Holy Synod under Aleksandr III (in Reflections of a Russian Statesman). The most complete expression of liberal Orthodoxy can be found, I suggest, in ?ernySevskij {?to delate)', the most complete expression of conservative duxovnosf in Dostoevsky and Tolstoi from the religious side and Vissarion Belinskij and Prince Peter Kropotkin from the political side; the most com plete expression of radical duxovnosf in Bakunin; and of Marxism in Plek hanov. In Turgenev's Fathers and Sons (Otci i deti) we find something of the dvoeverie of society, the conflict between several aspects of duxovnosf and pravoslavnosf. And in Bolshevism, particularly as expressed by Lenin, we find the most complete expression of dvoeverie, of the disharmonious synthesis of political and moral-spiritual orthodoxy on the one side and political and moral-spiritual duxovnosf on the other, a turmoil of political freedom, spiritual freedom, political orthodoxy (partijnosf) and spiritual orthodoxy, all jostling and counterbalancing one another on the foundations of the Sovietism which is the perelom of 1917-1921, a conflated culmination of all of those previous currents. We have to understand, however, that, apart from the Reflections of Pobedonoscev, none of the other mysli, none of the other expressions of ideologies, for Orthodoxy or spirituality, were, or possibly could be as cate gorical or complete as one would expect, since Pobedonoscev's mysli alone were expressions of official Orthodoxy, of pravoslavie (and so alone permitted full reach), however articulate the other poets and propogandists of mysli might be. But, although he left no systematic expression of duxovnosf beyond his journalistic ventures in Vremja, in Dostoevsky's novels there is a powerful, expansive and expressive spokesman for his brand of duxovnosf. And in this, Dostoevsky was much more successful than was Tolstoi even in</page><page sequence="10">10 IRVING H. ANELLIS his expressly, purposefully spiritual Confession and remainder of the religious canons, which was clearly anemic, flaccid, non-Russian almost, even un worldly to an extent that is totally against Ma f Syra Zemlia in a way that no beguny ever could. This lack of completeness must be the case for any tinge of duxovnosf within the ideologico-aesthetic, as well as moral-religious, expressions of the duxovnaja kul'tura, since, after all, duxovnosf is not systematic knowledge, is not istina. Thus, many writers preferred the sug gestive or the open-ended, the fable, skazka, or the poetic mode of expression for pravda-spravedlivosf for duxovnosf, or the historical treatise, to seek duxovnosf and the roots of pravda-spravedlivosf in izbanaia Rus', while others, for example the 'legal Marxists', turned to sociology and economics in this search, as the only possible means of expression of their ideology in the face of censorship (the leading advocate of which was Pobedonoscev, in his day), in the name of Orthodoxy, pravoslavie, 'right praising'. So even in terms of mysli, Perun remains wild. Perun, the thunder god, is profound, thunder ously, inflamingly so; and despite his baptism, Perun remains unrestrained and untamed, wild, and pagan. In all of the duxovnaja kul'tura, in its ideologico aesthetic and moral-religious expressions, is the spontaneity, the fatalism, the depth, expansiveness, the spirituality, of the pagan Slavic soul, dusa, thrusting though its Byzantine formalism and Germanic feudal militaristic authori tarianism. Small wonder that orthodoxy, both tsarist and Soviet, have such deep-seated fears of their intelligentsia, especially of their writers, even while seeking to cultivate and honor them. The Dostoevskian choice for Christ over istina, that is, for duxovnosf over pravoslavnosf, spiritual-moral freedom (along with political freedom) over the foreign, the non-native, externally imposed authoritarian Orthodoxy (both political and religious orthodoxy), is really a central theme of Russian history, represented by the followers of the volxvi of ancient Kiev, who, like Perun, were forcibly baptized but kept a 'double faith'; by the earliest monks of the kenotic and kenoto-ascetic tradition of the Pe?erskaja Lav'ra, who lived in pits (like Dostoevsky's Underground Man, the podpol'nik, who must be closely related to the podvi?nik, if they are not in fact one and the same) and flagellated and scourged themselves; by the raskoVniki who wan dered off ? or fled ? into the northern forests or Siberian steppes, and their fellow schismatics who, when found out in their hiding places and churches, preferred self-immolation to submission to the tsar's authority and to the high church (in this regard, recall Promethean Perun, creator of fire, and his</page><page sequence="11">PERUN'S REVENGE 11 pyrotechnic double, Svarog; are not the raskoVniki choosing Perun in choos ing self-immolation?); by the monks who founded the Solovetskij monastery on islands of the White Sea (which, Sot?entisyn tells us, serves a similar purpose, as an island in the Gulag Archipelago, for the Soviets, as a place of banishment and punishment of the non-orthodox, as it was in the tsarist period, from the time of Peter);20 by the followers of Bolotnikov, Razin, Bulavin, and Puga?ev, whose rebellions had deep religious overtones;21 by Slavophile, Westernizer, Nihilist, Populist, and Marxist; by the 'suicide squads' of Decembrists; by Father Gapon and the martyrs of Bloody Sunday; and by the Bolsheviks. All were spiritual rebels. And if some chose with drawal, going underground, rather than coming out, the vystuplenie, there is the kenotic in it nevertheless, and thus much of the magical, the mystical, the coming to the shore, the vystuplenie, of Perun. And if it assumes political overtones, as it did for the followers of Bolotnikov, Razin, Bulavin, Pugacev, Gapon, and Lenin, it is only because of the association of the two heads of the Byzantine eagle of autocratic Russia, of orthodoxy and autocracy. Perun's revenge is both antidisestablishmentarianism and anti-establish mentism; it is anti-foreign in both senses. Nor is it surprising, then, that the first canonized, and most revered, saints of Russia were Boris and Gleb, the brothers whose deaths can only be understood as poUtical sacrifice ; they were done in on instructions of their elder brother, as an act of political assassina tion; but in their youthful anguish, they became spiritual martyrs, in the kenotic tradition. They are, in fact, the most Russian of saints in the Russian Orthodox army of saints. Historically, we have two iconic images of Boris and Gleb. The older Muscovite image of the late medieval period represents them as spiritual martyrs, arrayed in robes of red, haloes prominent, but their weapons scarcely visible; the newer, secularized image of the late eighteenth century represents them as bogatyri, legendary heroic medieval warriors, equestrian figures arrayed in armor, with weapons prominently displayed and haloes obscured by their helmets. These images, taken together, reflect the true character of the duxovnik, a sufferer, champion (podvi?nik) of dusa, in the name of the Russian people and their Perun, their duxovnosf. This dual image, of Christian martyr and of pagan demigod, reflects the dvoeverie clearly, for both Chris tianity and paganism, as well as the accompanying consequent 'duahties' of sacred and secular, prophetic and profane, spiritual and political. The anti-establishmentism is directed against the foreign influence, against</page><page sequence="12">12 IRVING H. ANELLIS the Varangian city-state and its feudal kniazata, and (later) against Byzantine Caesaropapism, and remains alive today in the anti-Soviet dissidents. Perun of old represents the power and majesty of nature, the Thunder Lord. Nature is magical and mystical. It is also free and wild, as is Zamyatin's Scythian, who is outside of the 'One State'.22 Outside of the One State are also the beguny, the bespopovci, the Underground Man, the revolutionists, the refuseniki. Rather, they belong to the land, to theRod', to Mat' Rodnaja. The 'going underground' in fact is a return to Mat'Syra zemlia, which, G. P. Fedotov found, belongs to the spiritual consciousness of pagan Scytho-Iranian myth.23 In fact, Fedotov makes no secret of the conflation (which I have already mentioned) of the pagan Slavic Mother Earth with the Mother of God (Bogorodica), and that, in Christianity as practiced by medieval Russia, the cult of the Virgin Mother is the strongest of Orthodox traditions to suffuse the folk consciousness.24 Anti-establishmentism does not, then, imply rejec tion of ancient tradition; rather, it is precisely an appeal to izbanaia Rus ', to Mat' Syra zemlia, and to Perun. Ivanov, for example, recognizes the close link between revisionism or rejectionism ? anti-Orthodoxy ? and the claims of Mother Earth and understands in the revolt against Mother Earth of Raskolinikov an escape from chthonian purity and an alienation from its salva tion and certainty, which in fact is Promethean. But for him, Raskolinikov's break does not represent a schism in the same sense as it does for the duxovnik who revolts against Orthodoxy rather than against Mother Earth.25 The Scythian and the appeal to izbanaia Rus' must not be understood in either the sense of the German romantics or in that of Rousseau's 'noble savage'. The Scythian is not governed by romantic emotion or by natural order, and neither are his literary heirs. In fact, he, and they, are in constant combat with the forces of nature. The dziady can control them, and so can the hylozoic anthropomorphs, the Slavic deities. But the Scythian also manipulates these powers for his own benefit. The Grandfathers can be appeased, and so can the deities, Xors, Veles, Dazdbog, Srizibog, Perun, and the rest. The ally in this appeasement is the Earth Mother, and the Slavic pagan rites thus reduce to Dionysian orgies. In the same sense, Orthodoxy gives its greatest reverence to the Mother of God, who intercedes with Christ on behalf of the sinner; the descent of the Mother of God into Hell is a unique bit of Russian apocrypha.26 This means that duxovnosf cannot be un derstood as romanticism. If so, then Dostoevsky's Underground Man and his Russian literary successors cannot be understood as either romantic rebels or</page><page sequence="13">PERUN'S REVENGE 13 existentiahst anti-heroes. Rather, they are the direct heirs of the original Scythians. Their chief representative, their chief deity, is Perun, the ancient Slavic thunder god. Only Mother Earth can tame Perun, can absorb without harm his thunderbolts and lightning. Only Bogorodica can descend into the depths and return unscathed. In fact, in Dostoevsky, the concepts o? izbanaia Rus' and rejection of the foreign adhesions came together in the concept of pocvenniiestvo, first expounded in the inaugural issue of the 'thick journal' Vremia (January 1861). Pocvenniiestvo recalls izbanaia Rus' not merely as the deep attachment to ancient custom and rustic emotional equanimity, but as an organic unity with Mat' Syra zemlia, it is organic-rootedness-in-the-soil, and a reflection, in that sense, of the pagan 'Slavic soul'. But at the same time, it gives a uniqueness and identity to the Russian people as the bearers of the Slavic soul, the means whereby their samobytnosf or particularity, as a people is both reflected and realized. Under the impact of foreign imposi tions of pravoslavie, samobytnosf assumes the guise of nativism, and the idea of narodnicestvo becomes a radicalized pocvenniiestvo, which, in its Orthodox forms, appropriated by the tsarist regime (when Dostoevsky befriended Pobedonoscev and became a tutor to the tsarevii), became the most reac tionary wing of the Slavophil and Panslavic movements. Under the guise of Orthodoxy, the definitely duxovnoe poivenniiestvo, then, becomes, first, the ultra-Orthodox Nicholaevan credo "Nationalism, Autocracy, Orthodoxy", which is exactly the opposite of the idealization of izbanaia Rus'in which it is rooted, and finally, in the last days of the second Nicholas, of Nicholas the Bloody, it becomes patently grotesque, taking the charlatan, opportunistic evil monk Rasputin as the idealization of the personification of the 'dark people', the krest'ianin, who is, if anything, in reality the exact opposite of the true krest'ianin depicted by Turgenev in Zapiski oxotnika (Hunting Sketches), who are intelligent, if downtrodden, noble, independent beings. Thus, the USSR Ministry of Culture was able to prepare a syllabus for courses on the history of Russian literature that explicitly makes it clear that pocven niiestvo was used by Dostoevsky as the philosophical "criticism of the ideology of Revolutionary Democracy from the standpoint of the 'Cult of the Earth'".27 But in its purest form, poivenniiestvo unifies the pagan naturalism, expressed in the cult of Mat' Syra zemlia, with the Messianism of the dvoeverie expressed in the Perunic Prometheanism of samobytnosf as a mystical and sacred conception of the Slavic soul. The appeal to izbanaia Rus', to Mat' Syra zemlia, and to Perun is so strong</page><page sequence="14">14 IRVING H. ANELLIS because the imposition of Varangian and Byzantine structures, of metaphysical dualism and monotheism, of conflict between duxovnosf and caesaropapism, led to what G. E. Gorbacov called "razorvannost' soznaniia," sundered con sciousness.28 The duxovnosf of pre-Christian Russ, exemplified by Perun, is the mystical magical power of the natural world. It is an anthropomorphic monophysitisthylozoism, which is sundered by the Platonic-Christian dualism of spirit and flesh, a dualism represented by the Byzantine eagle with its two heads, which superstitious Raskol'niki, as they began their apocalyptic prophesying in the days of Alexei and Peter, thought represented the devil, since only the devil can have two heads. I suggest that it is anthropomorphic hylozoism that suggests to Stavrogin, and to Dostoevsky, a preference for Christ over truth, istina - or God the Father ? Bogo-Istinnago ? if the two should prove to be different. I suggest that the polytheism of the ancient religion suggests the multidimensionalism of nature and the concept of sobornost' associated with izbanaia Rus', the cooperative community of absolutely autonomous individuals (liinosti) aiming with Messianic zeal for the New Jerusalem, for Heaven on Earth, Holy Russia. It may also reflect a suggestion for anarchy, not so much in its political sense, however, as in its sense of spiritual freedom, of duxovnosf, in its sense of resistance to foreigner-imposed forms of thought, whether Byzantine, Western, or even Marxist. As we shall see, it becomes the duty of the duxovniki to resist, re ject, anything 'written outside', while a member of the intelligentsia, as rebel, as one who has gone 'into books', is one who has gone mad (his behavior neistovnoe podvenie, like the 'holy fool', besnovatii). And he is a zealot, with an apocalyptic, eschatological Messianism, a Messianism which is either prophetic and sacred (e.g. the raskoVniki) or profane and secular (e.g. the Bolsheviki), but eschatological, Messianic, duxovnye, even iconoclastic, nonetheless. And its history is exactly the history of Russian culture, of duxovnaia kul'tura, from the days of Kiev, from the days before the baptism of Perun. But one must suffer to obtain salvation, go through Perun's fire. But it is not Christian passion, kenotic though it may be. The successor of Perun is not the Christian God, but Christ. If God the Father is order, Christ is passion and suffering. But this Christ is not the Orthodox Christ. The devil is not his foe, but his ally, his brother, each representing one side of the wild, the passionate, the spiritual ? duxovnosf. The Russian soul is broad, as broad as the land over which Gogol's troika flys at breakneck speed, as</page><page sequence="15">PERUN'S REVENGE 15 broad as the limitless steppe of the Scythian horsemen, and encompasses within itself comfortably the greatest of opposites, the antinomies of the soul, Perun, the Christ-Satan. The devil is the brother of Christ; together as Christ-Satan, they are Perun. Crucifixion and Resurrection are intricately and inseparably, even dialectically, bound, giving the paradox of the paratactic and the synthetic (as Edwards expresses it).29 Purification is attained through sin and suffering, exemplified by the destruction of the pagan idols, the assassination of Boris and Gleb, the executions of Ulianov and of Nikolai the Cruel, and yes, even the persecutions and immolations of the raskoVniki and Razin, but not, in the theological sense, in the crucifixion of Christ. In fact, the Scythian rebels even against this depravity; instead, he seeks the freedom rooted in nothingness, saying, with Berdiaev, that "svoboda vkorennina v nebyte Hi v niito". The rushing troika flies! Whither, neither we nor Gogol know. It rushes headlong, for the sake of the freedom of the flying. If the Scythian pursues suffering, it is not in atonement for sin. It is suffering for the sake of itself, as a rejection of confinement, of Orthodoxy, of the rational, of order. The impulse is towards anarchism, the rejection of both external secular Orthodoxy and religious Orthodoxy. The suffering that we consider is a kenotic experience that belongs to duxovnosf and is an integral part of the duxovnaja kul'tura, shared by Perun himself in being toppled into the Dniepr, and the heritage of Saints Boris and Gleb, the kenotic monks of Orthodox tradition, the passion of the reformer, the destiny of raskol'nik and revolutionist. It is expressed as a rejection of the Orthodoxy {pravoslavie) of the official church or of the orthodoxy {pravoslavie) of imperial, and later, of Bolshevik ? Marxist?Leninist - official doctrine; refusing to give the 'right praising' {pravoslavie). It would be immensely instructive to compare, then, the sacrificial death of paganism (the burning and destruction of the pagan idols, the attempted drowning of the idol of Perun) with the sacrificial deaths of Boris and Gleb, who died (as victims of a feudal dynastic struggle) not voluntarily, but without resistance to their assassins, and the death of Lenin's brother, Aleksandr Il'ic Ulianov, on the gallows, who used his trial not to resist death, but eloquently to express his political and ideological claims against Orthodoxy and to claim as his own responsibility the deeds and thoughts of his revo lutionary comrades. Does not Ulianov remind one even of Dostoevsky's Christian Karamazovs, who, for all their baseness, echo, along with the monk like Aliosha, that each one is responsible for all! (One might even wish, per</page><page sequence="16">16 IRVING H. ANELLIS impossibile, to include the execution of the late, unlamented, last tsar, Nikolai the Cruel, who, we are told by his monarchist apologists, without question or resistance, meekly placed himself and his family at the disposal of the Bolshevik firing squad. If so, this may be the only unorthodox, the only duxovnyj, deed ever performed by any of the most Orthodox tsars in the whole history of Russian tsardom.) The artistic aspects of the duxovnaja kul'tura find much room for, and indeed make a centerpiece of, this Perunic suffering. It is natural that literature (and the other arts), as expressions of duxovnaja kul'tura, should do so, and give aesthetic description of the philosophical explanations of dvoeverie and attempt solutions. "All Russian literature teaches humility", wrote the literary critic D. S. Merezkovskij ; "if any Russian writer began by rebellion", he continues, "then it was solely that he might at once repent and humble himself even more profoundly".30 We must see, then, that this is an aes thetico-spiritual experience, duxovnosf in its full, Russian, elemental, pagan, sense. Witness Vissarion Belinsk?: "to think, feel, suffer, and understand are one and the same thing".31 This sets the intelligent' on an aesthetico-moral crusade, a crusade of redemption, salvation. The duty of the writer is that of a warrior on behalf of his people. "V russkoi literature izdavna vrodnilis' nam predstavleniia, ito pisatel' molet v svoem narode - i doVten", wrote Solienitsyn.32 This takes on the most powerful dimensions because of its duxovnye reality; and all the more so for the committed, just because, ac cording to the proverb which is an article of faith, "Odno slovo pravdy ves' mir peretianef\ or, as expressed by Dostoevsky, "Mir spaset krasota".33 These sentiments are not limited to the conservative party of Dostoevsky? Sol2enitsyn alone, clearly. Rather, they express a Messianic Prometheanism, one which can be derived directly from Perun's gift of purifying fire, and from his redemptive axe,thunderhead of justice. But this, too, is not Christian passion. It is a split consciousness, razorvannost' soznanija, the passion of baptized Perun, a vehicle of Perun's revenge, and lacking pravoslavie, with what Berdiaev called "a vast elemental strength, combined with a weak sense of form".34 This is the power and weakness of Dostoevsky's Rodia Ras kolnikov. Rodia is of the people, representing its split consciousness in his schizophrenic psyche. Thus, Vyacheslay Ivanov's understanding of Raskolnikov as 'split off from humanity ? and consequently from Mother Earth.35 RaskoV is the split, and Rodia's fever brings together the two aspects of Perun, the fire lord, in the fire of the Christian Word and the fire of Satan; Raskolnikov</page><page sequence="17">PERUN'S REVENGE 17 is both split and unified, then, by the fire of Perun, by duxovnosf. And his Russian soul is broad enough, like the Karamazovs', to contain comfortably the disparate opposites, to stand between two opposing abysses. This makes Dostoevsky and his artistic duxovniki kin, of whatever political shade, the central supports and exemplars of the Russian literary tradition in which they stand, and the most powerful spokesmen of the duxovnaja kul'tura to which they belong. Thus, Dostoevsky and Cernysevsky stand together, be tween an abyss on either side, in a sense holding hands and preventing one another from toppling into one abyss or the other; they precariously balance the rushing troika of duxovnaja kul'tura making headlong flight towards the abyss on either side of the broad Scythian steppe. In a more general setting, the Perun's Revenge Syndrome is expressed in the social-behavioral symptoms exhibited daily in the Russian soul, in the framework of dvoeverie understood as the unity of dialectical tensions of opposites. The non-Christian spirituality of the intelligentsia is found in the intense religious-moral zeal of the warrior for pravda-spravedlivosf, and of the 'dark people', the peasant masses, in a holy quest for the New Jerusalem as a personification of sobornosf, the eschatological sacrifice of absolutely autonomous individuals for the organic communism of the sacred Rod', in which the individual assumes a central place. The concept of sobornost' har moniously blends Christian social conscience with pagan deity of Rodzanicii. For the 'dark people', Russia is not a geopolitical fact, but an Earth Mother, Mother Russia. That is the point of the cult o? Mat' Syra Zemlia and its Dostoevskian abstract idealization as pocvenniiestvo. Moreover, the devil has more reality than the Christian God. ("If you want to find the devil, look behind a cross", an old Russian folksaying says). This can be understood as the krest'ianin understanding of Dostoevsky's Christ-Satan Perun, the non-Christian spirituality of the intelligentsia, and the commitment of the krest'ianin to Mat' Syra zemlia. Historically, we note a spirit of deep in dependence amidst the greatest servility as exhibited in the bunt of the cossacks and peasants, and in the conspiracies and assassinations of the intelligentsia against their rulers. In the bunt, the anti-tsarist, and later, anti-Soviet, conspiracies, we find a peculiar kenoticism, the self-sacrifice of the devotee in search of salvation, born of self-love. Opposed to this self-love goes a deep capacity, however, for self-criticism, itself kenotic, and not a feature introduced only recently by the Communist Party. Passive fate (sud, Rozanica) alternates with violent Messianism; submission with violent anti</page><page sequence="18">18 IRVING H. ANGELLIS authoritarianism; the spiritual search for salvation with the material quest for earthly well-being; xenophobia with garrulity; and each occurring at precisely the historical moment when exactly the opposite phenomenon would logically be expected. Thus, we find an interesting, almost inexplicable, trend, in which proponents of any given policy invariably contribute more to their own demise than do their enemies; while the greatest, most momentous, changes occur under the most backward-looking of authorities, the greatest internal concentration of self-perpetuating indolence occurs under the most progressive of forces. Thus, for example, the suppression of innovative forces in the reign of Nikolai I provoked the stimulation of the first major revolu tionary movement, that of the Decembrists, and the 'golden age' of modern Russian culture, led by Pushkin in poetry and Glinka in music. Thus, for example, we find in the traditionalist, conservative theology of the Old Believers, the raskoVniki, the greatest rebelliousness against both political and moral-religious Orthodoxy of the early modern period of Russian history. Billington finds in this juxtaposition or dialectical tension of opposing forces that brings about exactly the opposite of the intended effect an irony of Russian history.36 But to speak of 'irony' in this sense is merely to name the general collection of symptoms of the central feature of the duxovnaja kul'tura and of the Russian psyche, and is no more useful an explanation than application of the romantic name 'dvoeverie' for this same phenomenon. Rather, what is required is a detailed description. And this, I suggest, is provided by an account of the collective bifurcation of the Russian con sciousness by the traumatic spiritual experience which I call the 'baptism of Perun' and 'schizophrenic' reaction to it which I call 'Perun's Revenge'. I say 'schizophrenic' because in the dvoeverie there is a dialectical tension which, like the two heads of the Byzantine eagle, pulls in opposite directions, but which is essentially unitary, a united single body. The Byzantine eagle, the standard of Muscovy and Imperial Russia, looks both east and west. Two heads are united in one body, the pagan and the Christian, in one expression of the duxovnaia kul'tura as dvoeverie. One head faces the past, the other the future. The messianism of the [liberal] intelligentsia looks towards the future as an idealization of the past, of izbanaia Rus' expressed in the ideal of sobornost*, while the raskoVniki, and the krest'ianin generally, reject the orthodox vision of the future presented to them by the Church and State and look instead to the ancient heritage of their ancestors as the guide to their own apocalyptic eschatology, and finally, to the pre-Kievan period of</page><page sequence="19">PERUN'S REVENGE 19 Perun as the source of popular culture. This popular culture, rooted in Perun and created partially on the ancient pagan rites of the Slavs and Scythians, partially in the reaction to the orthodox intrusions which sought to destroy Perun, is the native folk culture, the pure culture of the people, the narod'. In Soviet terms, Perun's Revenge raises the material to the level of the spiritual, just as pagan Slavic religion did in hylozoism, and crude popular Christianity in the icon. Thus, the alien, unnatural Platonic dualism which the Byzantine Greeks brought to the Slavs with their Christianity, is again conquered and overturned. In Soviet terms, the public display of the mummi fied Lenin, and even the Stalinist 'cult of personality,' is a reenactment of the ancient pagan Trizna or Radunica of the Dziadii, or the tsarist conception of Tsar as Batuska and Christian God as Pantokrater ? so that the orthodox were forced to adopt perunic forms to guarantee the success of Christianity and feudal Imperialism or Germanic Marxism. Indeed, the Stalinist cult of personality is very much closer to the pagan veneration of Perun than is anything found in the 'father cult' of either the tsars or of Lenin. Stalin himself seems very nearly the impersonation of Perun, down to the big droop ing mustache. Personally, Stalin was very much more attuned and evocative of the popular folk culture than any of the intelligentsia or any of their imperial or soviet Orthodox opponents. And only Perun himself can compete in power with, and dominate, the Earth Mother. Soviet orthodoxy is itself a continuation of major themes of Russian history, of the duxovnaja kul'tura, and cannot be dismissed as 'tsarism by commissars'. Marxism is a foreign, specifically a German, adhesion. In the hands of Lenin, it becomes uniquely Russian, a fusion of Communism, a sobornost' transferred from the krest'ianin to the proletariat and their proletarianized agrarian allies, rooted in the mir of izbanaia Rus' and led by a stylized starets in the form of the dictatorship of the proletariat (and akin to the nineteenth-century intelligentsia of the v narod' movement), with traditional Messianism, which itself fuses elements of Caesaro-papism and the ancient communal mir of the Rod', and in which partijnosf acquires at once the religious commitment to the secular mir, led by its starets, and the social justification of sobornost' as the tool o? pravda-spravedlivosf. At the same time, the promise of Marxism?Leninism to the orthodox homo sovieticus in exchange for partijnosf is the withering away of the State, toward the ideal ized condition, that is, of izbanaia Rus', as described by both the chroniclers of Povesf vremennyk let' and the Slavophils, as it existed in the pagan times</page><page sequence="20">20 IRVING H. ANELLIS of Perun, before the imposition by foreigners, specifically the Germanic Varangians, of government upon the pagan Slavs of the Dniepr. Closely examining the symptoms of Perun's Revenge within the Soviet system, we can find a second level of Perun's Revenge embedded within the surface layer just described. Promising a return to an updated version of the ancient pagan values, the Soviet system nevertheless demands its own orthodoxy, and thereby calls forth its own raskoVniki, the dissidents, Thus, writers such as Zamiatin, Pil'niak, Bulgakov, and Andrei Platonov (Andrei Platonovic Klimen'tov) all, to a greater or lesser extent, embraced the bunt of 1917 and the early, free-wheeling (pre-NEP), Leninist regime, but also rebelled against the orthodox monolith of Stalin's industrialization, and their prose sought an echo from a beckoning izbanaia Rus'.31 Thus, writers such as Giorgii Vladimov, Solzenitsyn (who resembles Dostoevsky, both physically and intellectually), and Pasternak stubbornly reject out of hand Soviet orthodoxy and seek a return to the older, tsarist, orthodoxy. It is not, there fore, surprising that Ihor Osakiwsky reports that "officially-sanctioned literature definitely became duller" during Brezhnev's years as General Secretary;38 the moral compromisers who stay within the guidelines of pravoslavie-partijnosf do not experiment, while "the interesting writers who were not only able but willing to say something new were practically all V either expelled or sent to the camps", says Gleb Zekulin.39 So on the path towards the Soviet millenium of an industrialized elektronaja Rus', it builds nevertheless its crystal palace, that edifice which so enraged Dostoevsky's Underground Man, that icon of glass and electronics of the One State which Zamiatin, the mathematician, rejects in favor of the open steppe of the Scythian. The Scythian needs the rushing troika flying at breakneck speed across the limitless broad steppe, flanked on either side by a catastrophic abyss. In short, the Soviet experience is no more paradoxical or (in Billington's word) ironic, than any other development in the history of the duxovnaja kul'tura', it is no more ? or less ? an expression o? dvoeverie than any other period of Russian history since the baptism of Perun. The method of dia lectical thought in which the tension of opposites finds new truth, is most suitable to this expression of sovetskaja kul'tura, and indeed is much more akin to the poetry of Pasternak, the prose of Dostoevsky, the music of Chaikovsky, the ?itie of the Staroverei, the hyperbolic mathematics of Lobaievskii and Zamiatin, than the 'cursed logic' of Aristotle and the planar geometry of Euclid. At the same time, this sovetskaja kul'tura offers the best</page><page sequence="21">PERUN'S REVENGE 21 possib?ity in Russian history for a return to a pre-Kievan Slavic paganism, an electrified, nuclear, version of the izbanaia Rus' of the age of Perun. The engineer-writer Platonov already foresaw this in 1921.40 The hydroelectric and nuclear power plants of Dniepropetrovsk are the face of Perun emerging out of age-old orthodoxy. Perun will resume his rightful role, unchallenged. For the mind inclined towards mysticism, the year 1988, and General Secre tary Yuri Andropov's patrynomic, Vladimirovic, must be most suggestive and tantallizing. Then the raskoV, the dvoeverie will collapse and Perun's revenge will be completed.

He has the bunt of 1917 in mind specifically when he writes (str. 117): "Net nikakogo intemacionala, a est' narodnaia russkaia revoluciia, bunt - i bol*se nifego". He adds, in more general terms (str. 101-102) that: "5 Rad?Zev intelligencija stala kajat'cja, kajat'cja i iskat' mat' svoiju, Rossiju. Ka?diy intelligent kaetsja, i ka?dyi bogit za narod, i ka?diy n?roda ne znaet. A revolucii buntu narodnomu, ne nu?no bylo - lu?oe. Bunt narodnyi - k vlastiprisli i svoju pravda tvorjat - podlinno russkie podlinno russkuju". Moments later, comes the exchange of P?niak's Gleb and S?'vestr (str. 104): "Cto ze takoe religifa? - Ideja, kul'tura. - A Bogi - Ideja, fikcija", where it is the monk, S?'vestr, who equates religion with the idea of culture, and God with the fictive idea. 22 Zamiatin's My.
