<plain_text><page sequence="1">Living gods In (partial) defence of Euhemerus ROLAND LITTLEWOOD Roland Littlewood is Professor of Anthropology and Psychiatry at University College London. His recent publications include Reason and Necessity in the Specification of the Multiple Self (RAI Occasional Paper No.43, 1996- ?8 or US$14 post paid), a consideration of the new Western syndrome of multiple personality disorder from the viewpoint of the anthropology of spirit possession. This article was his third Presidential Address to the RAI, given at the Annual General Meeting at the London School of Economics, on 26 June 1997. The Iwas, the Haitian gods who possess their initiates in vodu, comprise a number of different families. The benign and nurturant rada spirits came to Haiti from Dahomey along with the slaves who served them; the kongo spirits from further east, again during the slave trade. Many of the characteristics of these deities can still be identified in their African cognates - in their personality, sentiments and physical comportment, rit- ual paraphernalia and so on. One group of gods how- ever, called creole or petro, appeared only during the period of Caribbean slavery: in this pantheon we find French mermaids and sea captains, bibulous peasants and such historical figures as Dessalines, the first em- peror of independent Haiti, and more recently Papa Doc Duvalier, the medical anthropologist who ruled Haiti from 1957 until his death in 1971. (We might note parenthetically that Duvalier's apology for power was foreshadowed in a series of articles on the anthropology of religion which he published in the journal of Haiti's National Bureau of Ethnology.) These petro powers are hot, bitter and vengeful. They overlap conceptually with the gwede powers of death; indeed, Papa Doc (who encouraged schoolchild- ren to learn a new version of the Lord's Prayer - 'Our Doc Who Art in Heaven') is said to have dressed like the most formidable of all gwede', Baron Samedi; now a god he, reciprocally, wears dark glasses and a homburg, talks through those he possesses in a nasal voice, his nostrils plugged like those of the dead with cotton wool. The petro pantheon is named for one Don Pedro, a Spanish-speaking slave in 18th century Hispaniola who is recalled as having preached violence against the white slave owners. About Don Pedro as a historical personage little is known, but his vengeful personality remains to animate his cult, although he is not generally a god himself. In this address, I propose to raise a question un- fashionable in the social sciences since Fustel de Cou- langes and Herbert Spencer. How may historical indi- viduals like Duvalier become represented as ultrahuman personages whose sentiments, attributes and personality nonetheless recall those of the living human? Not the translation of the dead into distant ancestral spirits; nor the well-studied phenomenon of divine kingship, nor the near worship of dead heroes such as Mao Tse-tung or James Dean, nor of the miracle-performing theos aner of late antiquity (Brown 1982), nor even the apo- theosis by which deceased Roman emperors (after Domitian when still alive) were regarded as 'divine', but the process by which during their lives individuals may become translated into personalized, unique and novel divine beings who, like Dessalines and Duvalier, may then choose to intervene in our human affairs or return embodied in living humans whom they inhabit with their person, and whose original sentiments and political context may, as with Don Pedro, preside over a whole category of local experience. (Myth after all, as Andrew Lang once observed, can represent history.) I'll suggest that this process of divinization is particularly common among what Lanternari (1963) described as the 'religions of the oppressed'. I am not concerned with what we might term 'completed cultures' - if such there could be - but with the revelation of divine at- tribution, and in this with the currently discredited no- tions of incident and narrative. In a sense there is noth- ing so very extraordinary here: the phenomenon of spirit possession, for instance, presents an ethnohistory in which the spirits respond to and reinstate new events, objects and personalities the phenomenon of colonial- ism as spirit intrusion is well represented in the classic accounts of sar possession in East Africa (Lewis, Con- stantinides and Boddy), and colonial memoirs of Africa once frequently recounted the reappearance of the de- ceased District Commissioner as a (generally benign) spirit. (Among the Waitata of Kenya, Harris reported in the 1950s, saka possession in women could be occa- sioned by the appearance of bicycles or motor vehicles, and I recall from Trinidad a whole family possessed by a new sewing machine they had allegedly stolen.) Reli- gion always represents events and contemporary history even if it cannot be equated with them. Whilst local genealogies may record the apical ances- tors as somehow closer to the world of spirits than one's recently deceased relatives, in this context the human personality of the long dead person is generally unremarked in their later descendants. Their unique- ness, as it were, fades away. I propose here some fairly modest speculations on a more personified process of 'divinization' - what the Victorians knew as Euhemer- ism, what more recently we may be inclined to regard as an extreme instance of the biographical fallacy. Less the transmission of event into structure than the trans- mission of person into structure: if you like, a severe case of the routinization of charisma. I would suggest that a nineteenth century explanation for religion which we now deride as conjectural intellectualism may nevertheless be of interest in certain contemporary in- stances, particularly 'anti-establishment' movements. Euhemerus of Messene was the Hellenistic author, around 300 BC, of a fantasy travel novel Hiera Anag- raphe (Sacred Scripture) which now survives only in fragments. In this, Euhemerus tells of an imaginary voyage to the island of Panchaia in the Indian Ocean which recalls perhaps Sri Lanka. Here he finds do- cumentary evidence that the Hellenic gods were simply great heroes who had been deified after death by their grateful people; this argument we now term euhemer- ism in its more extended form - that myths are surviv- ing local accounts of real incidents in human history. The Greek myths themselves already contained ac- counts of human or semi-human heroes being translated at their death into full divinity, or into stars or what- ever. Humans are granted immortality in the Vedas, as they are in Greek and Egyptian myths; Plutarch de- scribes how Egyptian priests showed interested tourists the actual grave of Osiris. Euhemerus simply reads this as a uniform process of civilization. Euhemerism be- came particularly appealing in a period when Alexan- der's successors required worship from their citizens on what they supposed were Asian principles, the 6 ANTHROPOLOGY TODAY Vol 14 No 2, April 1998</page><page sequence="2">Franfois 'Papa Doc' Duvalier (1907-71, president of Haiti 1957-71), at a news conference in Port-au-Prince, 15 May 1963 (Photo C Associated Press.) Ptolemies having their secular power personalized under their more transcendent title of soter: protector, guard, saviour. The early Roman poet Ennius wrote a euhemerist piece in Latin to question the divinity of Jupiter; this too has not survived, but was later cited by Christian apologists such as Lactantius to decry the in- dependent reality of the Greek gods. Like Herbert Spencer (1876), anthropologists too have sometimes credited mythical 'heroes' (but seldom, as with Spencer, actual gods) with some previous existence as humans (Lang 1884: 199). Fustel de Coulanges offers less a 'strong' euhemerism (in which only the high eter- nal gods are derived from specific 'superior persons' - as Evans-Pritchard termed them) than a domestic origin for religion in which 'hearth-fire demons, heroes, lares [household gods], all are confounded' (1864, p.32); in Coulanges' schema all ancestors are translated into something like minor gods of one degree or another be- cause no death can be conceived as final, for the living are still emotionally attached to their deceased relatives who have to be fed and placated (p.19). He calls this 'the worship of the dead' (p.21); let us call it 'weak' euhemerism. As a general explanation of godhood, eu- hemerism is now regarded by anthropologists as im- plausible. Divinity is primarily a social, not an histori- cal or psychological, phenomenon. The last profes- sional anthropological concern with the 'historicity of myth' was perhaps Meyer Fortes' (1937) astringent re- e.:: w_F ANTHROPOLOGY TODAY Vol 14 No 2, April 1998 7</page><page sequence="3">Mother Earth and Cyprian (photograph: Jenny Littlewood) view of William Perry's The Primordial Ocean, a char- acteristic piece of University College London's helioli- thic diffusionism splendidly subtitled An Introductory Contribution to Social Psychology2. The idea however persists in what we might term popular 'Hermetic anti- quarianism', a set of ideas to which I'll return below. At a fairly banal level, however, deities are surely always modelled on human persons: omniscient and eternal they may be, yet they are liable to become angry, jealous, forgiving or otherwise (what Samuel Johnson's dictionary termed 'anthropomorphism'). But this is hardly euhemerism - strong or weak - in which historical individuals have remained amongst us as gods. It is of course Christianity that its critics have argued as the most striking instance of euhemerism: the doctrine of the Incarnation proposes, not that the man Jesus was deified by over-zealous followers (as Mus- lims and other unitarians argue), but that the preexistent Deity appeared in the guise of - or as - a man. (For, to prove successful, any ontological upgrading must surely sell itself in some such reversal: for how could one deify a man who was already God in human form?) Christian theology has been much preoccupied with the exact relation between God and Jesus. The - as they were once called - 'Judaizers' emphasized the hu- manity of Jesus as the messiah: for the Jewish messiah has never been properly divine. The extent to which Jesus recognized himself as 'divine' is lost in sub- sequent hagiography, but we know there were disputes between those followers emphasizing his humanity and those - the 'Hellenizers', like Saints Paul and John - who downplayed the human Jesus in favour of the Christ, the divinity made flesh. So, as appears with Zo- roaster or Buddha, but probably even more so, we have two opposed directions, the downward embodiment of the otherworldly (incarnation, as stated in doctrine) and the upward divinization of the natural (apotheosis, as seen by observers and critics) (Burke 1970, Littlewood and Dein 1995). Deification during life leads to certain intellectual problems at the death of the historical indi- vidual. The Christian argument here is perhaps best left to its apologists, but we might note that the argument over the two natures of Christ has continued: Nazarenes and Ebionites were opposed to the Gnostics and Docetics, extreme universalizers who argued that the Jesus who died was no longer divine but simply a man, God - who cannot die - having departed his physical body before the Crucifixion - an idea here curiously allied to those of the Monophysite churches, which have proposed the incorruptibility of Christ's body from the first moment of the Incarnation. With com- plete identity between deity and prophet, the divinizing principle has of course to downplay the immediate so- cial attributes of the deified human; and in St Paul's Letter to the Galatians we find a rejection of much of the Jewish context of Jesus' beliefs and practices - the context which the ethnographer of early Christianity would require to understand the incarnate deity's human actions . It is doubtful - given that all our sources are relatively late and Christian - if we can seek to uncover a non-Christianized (and hence non-di- vine) historical personage, Jesus; I want to turn today to some more contemporary instances where one can place empirical knowledge of the historical individual against subsequent deification. We might note that such deification of the prophet may be resisted (Islam in general) or reversed (18th century French deism and Unitarianism in North America). So far I've been rather vague about what we might properly refer to as a divinity. To demonstrate the oc- currence of something like 'strong' euhemerism (as op- posed to the 'weak' forms of 'ancestor worship' or 'di- vine kingship'), I propose that we require: 1. A situation in which one already makes a clear distinction between the world of everyday experience 8 ANTHROPOLOGY TODAY Vol 14 No 2, April 1998 r * s erbt sA 9. 1O 4. . V~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~_ a S ~ J -</page><page sequence="4">and an other-worldly ultrahuman order (Paradise, Olympus, the Transcendent or whatever)... 2.... But in which humans at death do not generally pass to authority in the otherworld; certain high beings in the ultrahuman world, one or more, have a pree- minence and power which generates and, in part con- trols, our sublunary world. Let us call them 'gods'. 3. Some humans, during their life or afterwards, may claim or are awarded identity and authority with these gods as one of their limited number, or indeed as the single eternal and omnipotent deity; as Andrew Lang, not incidentally a euhemerist, put it (1888: 199): 'an- cestral spirits raised to a higher power'. What may be described as ontological promotion. If this sounds a rather Western and monotheistic schema, I am indeed going to look primarily at in- stances within monotheism or drastically revising it. Given that the Christian Incarnation was a more or less once and forever event, the latter is more common: the process we can characterize as euhemerism has now to be one of scandalous heresy. (I'll leave aside Asian re- ligious systems, in which we find a complex cross-cut- ting of divine heroes, avatars, deified religious leaders, minor divinities, incarnations and godlings.) I'll start with a contemporary instance from the West Indies. In 1971 Jeanette Baptiste, a 39-year-old woman, left Port-of-Spain to live on the inhospitable north coast of Trinidad together with six of her twelve children and her partner Cyprian. The family settle among the re- mains of one of the now deserted hamlets; initially paid by an absentee overseer to collect copra, they continue after an argument to squat on the abandoned land. They grow ground provisions, exchanging the surplus with the nearest village some twelve miles distant through the bush. Both Jeanette and Cyprian have been some- what half-hearted Spiritual Baptists (an Africanizing form of Protestantism) and they continue to 'pick along in the Bible' as they put it, and interpreting the vision- ary import of their dreams. From 1975, after the birth of twins in their wooden hut, until 1976, Jeanette ex- periences a series of revelations which become the foundation of her subsequent group, the Earth People. She comes to understand that Christian teaching is totally false. Rather, our world is the work of a primor- dial Mother whom Jeanette identifies with Nature, with the Earth and with her own body. Nature gave birth to a race of Black people, but her rebellious Son (the Christian God) re-entered his Mother's womb to steal her power of generation and succeeded by producing (or forcing her to create) White people. The Whites, the Race of the Son, then enslaved the Blacks and have continued to exploit them. The Way of the Son is that of Science - of cities, clothes, schools, books, hospitals, factories and wage labour. The Way of The Mother is the Way of Nature - a return to the naked simplicity of the Beginning, cultivation of the land by hand, and of gentle and non-exploiting human relationships. Her Son is God, who in his continued quest for the power of generation, has now succeeded in establishing himself in Black People, and is on the point of replac- ing humankind altogether through mechanization, com- puters and robots. Nature, who has borne all this out of love for the whole of her creation, has finally lost pa- tience. The current order of the Son will soon end in a catastrophic drought and famine, or nuclear war, a:de- struction of the Son's world through his own acts. Jea- nette herself takes the name Mother Earth as the pri- mordial Mother Nature in bodily form, but the Mother will only fully become her at the End. 'They say the Christ is returning in the twentieth century, but I am the Christ.' She was also identified previously as Eve in opposition to both Adam and his Creator, as the Devil against God, and (for Jeanette was once an habituee of 'sword and sandal' cinema epics) as Polyphemus against Odysseus, as Dracula against Frankenstein, as Cleopatra against the Romans, as Rider Haggard's She, and as the reggae singer Jimmy Cliff's Queen of Af- rica. (A living divinity must herself presumably employ this sort of euhemerism to cut down her mythic rivals by arguing that they are only misreadings of her own physical actuality.) Jeanette's task now is to facilitate the return to the Beginning by organizing her com- munity known as Hell Valley, and to 'put out The Life' to her people, the Black Nation, The Mother's Child- ren. She has to combat the teaching of the churches which place the Son over the Mother, and to correct the distorted teaching of the Bible where she appears as the Devil. She embodies Life and Nature, in opposition to the Christian God who is her rebellious Son, the prin- ciple of Science and Death. As the Devil she is op- posed to churches and prisons, education and money, contemporary morals and fashionable opinions. What others now take as obscenities are only Natural words for she herself is the 'Cunt', the source of all life. Her community do not seek to 'force the end' - to use Mar- tin Buber's phrase: the exact timing of the End is un- certain but it will come in Jeanette's physical lifetime. Then Time will end, Sickness will be healed and the Nation will speak its one language. The Son will be exiled to his planet, the Sun, currently hidden by Fire placed there by The Mother - Fire which will event- ually return to where it belongs, back to the heart of the nurturant Earth. Since her revelations in 1975, which initiated what she calls the Beginning of the End, Mother Earth's im- mediate family have been joined by numbers of young men who bring their partners and children. The com- munity has a high turnover and, while over fifty people have been associated with the Earth People, when I first stayed with them in the early 1980s there were twenty- two staying naked in the valley with perhaps a similar number of committed sympathizers in Post-of-Spain. Once a year the group march into town and present their teachings in the central streets, particularly in Woodford Square, the popular site for political demon- strations next to the parliament building. After a few weeks of 'putting out The Life' and visits to friends and relatives, they return to their valley and 'plant for the Nation'. The authorities have responded with raids on the community by police and nurses, with short prison sentences or incarceration in the psychiatric hos- pital, and sarcastic leading articles in the press. Here we have an instance of a prophetic woman identifying with a divine being: not one already known but a novel one which nevertheless translocates certain aspects of existing deities and heroes - particularly the Christians' God and their Devil - and whose overall schema certainly recalls the model of divine power and human disobedience offered by popular Christianity, say in the tales of the medieval Golden Legend. Mother Earth cannot offer us an instance of 'natural religion' like those proposed by 18th century theologians such as William Paley: her actions take place within and against an already existing religious system. (And we must be similarly wary of using the development and organization of a religious community as a convincing model for a society (Littlewood 1993).) One radically new development is her notion of creation: which reca- pitulates Jeanette' s own personality and her earlier ex- periences of physical motherhood, and with which her ANTHROPOLOGY TODAY Vol 14 No 2, April 1998 9</page><page sequence="5">group have continued to resonate after her death not only in doctrine but in comportment, sentiment and af- fect. In this, they are, as they say, Her Children: gentle but resolute and implacable. Jeanette's personality has been translated both into an organization of her group as a family and into its individual replication in each member. The radical Protestant tradition, particularly in the countries colonized by Europeans, contains a number of men identifying themselves as Jesus or God, or such figures as the prophet Daniel, as the Brother of the Al- mighty, and the Younger Brother of Jesus. And simi- larly prophetic women have argued affinities between themselves and biblical or quasi-biblical characters, both male and female. How does individual human ac- tion and experience become translated into that of a di- vine exemplar? Whilst an emphasis on psychological aspects here appears more germane than for 'theories of religion' in general, our possible ascription of insanity is perhaps less an explanation than a denigration (though 'grandiosity' is not an infrequent symptom in psychopathology). Whilst, it is true, my instances of di- vinization occur in small and generally transient groups (and thus lack the characteristics which, Evans-Prit- chard argued, make the explanation of religion primar- ily sociological - its shared cultural context, its unifor- mity, its obligatory nature), it is the acceptance by others of divinization as legitimate that differentiates it from our normal ascription of madness. It has to reson- ate with the experience of others. (Which is not to say that 'divinization' is to be considered as especially 'psychological': custom and habit are as much psycho- logy as resonance with novelty.) The most useful inter- pretation here is perhaps that proposed by the psycho- analyst Erik Erikson (1958) for charismatic leadership: in periods of locally recognized change or contestation, the new leader's personality and experiences exemplify for others their own uncertain situation - and its solu- tion. As Godfrey Lienhardt (1974:134-5) put it, 'the "vision" of one man then becomes accepted by his fol- lowers as a source of their own distinctive collective experiences'. We might wonder if those groups in the Christianized world which particularly divinize - women, the colonized, the poor - are so marginal that successful resistance (for only this comes to our atten- tion) must necessarily take a more dramatic form, and that to align their aspirations with divine or natural pro- cesses is to provide an objectivized charter for radical action, enabling them to challenge the dominant order in which, as an apparently seamless and thus unques- tionable whole, its immediate practice as well as ulti- mate justification have consigned them to marginality. In this sense, 'divinization' is a theory of subdominant protest framed in a cosmological idiom. Why women? Figuring the relationship between cosmos and human in terms of sexuality or parturition appears virtually ubiquitous in human understanding, whether as implicit trope, as conventionalized analogy - or as some expressly concrete generation, what Ro- bertson Smith called 'sexual analogies of a crass and physical kind' (cited by Stocking 1996: 69). Indeed it is difficult to conceive of any formal set of cosmological ideas (including male religious expression and counter- intuitive Western science) which do not in some way eventually evoke our everyday sensory modes. Without making too extravagant claims, we might consider whether idioms of spiritual flight and of creation de novo at a distance (by spirit, breath, dream, speech or gesture) may not appear more congenial to the male im- agination; idioms of experienced penetration or of a cosmic unfolding more plausible for women. Compare the encounter with ultrahuman agency for Saints Au- gustine and Teresa of Avila, and in the ethnography of central and peripheral possession cults (as some Afri- canists have termed them). Nor can we assume any sort of historical progression from one to the other: current instances of a recent reassertion of a 'female mode' of connectedness and inherent obligation may be instanced in Western theology, jurisprudence, philosophy and science. Not altogether surprisingly, novel figurings of self and other, self and cosmos, employ our current pre- occupations with our experience in a physical world. Revisions of Christianity by women prophets in the English tradition have frequently favoured such a re- peated unfolding (or disembedding) of an immanent creation rather than divine generation at a distance. The prophet herself may be a fairly passive vehicle as bride or womb for a male divinity (Margery Kempe and Joanna Southcott), but sometimes the female aspect of a bisexual Godhead (Ann Lee, the Manchester factory worker who founded the American Shakers), or most radically as our ultimate divine source now embodied in human form (Mother Earth). It is difficult to assess a personal and consistent identification with divinity from the refutations written by clerical persecutors, but there appear a variety of personal elisions between woman and divinity: from a heightening of conventional analogy in which a mystic like Julian of Norwich or Margery Kempe is spiritually penetrated (for all Catholic women are the Brides of Christ not only as women but as members of his Universal Church), to a closer identification with divine or divine beings (many English Ranters and the Cana- dian Doukhobors have argued they were in a way di- vine, particularly their leaders, and Quakers and some Beguines such as Marguerite Porete have come close), to a novel and total incarnation as embodied Protestant divinity (Joanna Southcott, Jemima Wilkinson, Ann Lee, Mother Earth). Gods create the world: if procre- ation for a woman involves remarking two experiences with rather different female agency, coitus and child- birth, then the less radical revisions still employ some- thing like the former to mark the entry of a male di- vinity into her as a passive incubator, whether as a vi- sionary identification or more concretely as destined motherhood of the incarnate divinity. The more radical and total identification as ultimate power seem to be the preserve of those Protestant women whose own preg- nancies, as self-sufficient and parthenogenic, figure a new world without any male contribution at all. Assumptions of 'divine identity' in religious vision- aries are not infrequent, if less common than that of the merely human prophet who claims a divine origin for their message. Divinity may be offered to religious leaders in their lifetime and refused; on his visit to Jamaica, the Rastafari informed a bemused Emperor Haile Selassie that he was God but he declined the hon- our, nor did Jiddu Krishnamurti accept Godhood when the English socialist Annie Besant proposed it. The seventeenth century Jewish messiah Sabbatai Svi alter- nated between deprecating the near-divination sug- gested for him by some of his Christian followers and sending out letters signed 'God', and both Cromwell and Napoleon were acclaimed as the messiah by groups of grateful Jews. There has recently been a near-scandal among the Christian Scientists, whose deity is almost bisexual; they were offered a very generous donation in I am grateful for comments from Jonathan Benthall and Jean La Fontaine, and at an earlier presentation of this paper (which draws on material in Littlewood 1993) at two UCL and Oxford seminars: particularly from Wendy James and from Nick Allen, who suggested the useful term 'ontological promotion'. 1. For instance, James (1988: 201) describes the appearance among the Uduk of a major new arum spirit who was recognized as a 10 ANTHROPOLOGY TODAY Vol 14 No 2, April 1998</page><page sequence="6">exchange for nudging Mary Baker Eddy, their founder, to a more divine position. They declined. 'Divinity' appears to cover a variety of rather different understandings. In the case of Mother Earth she cer- tainly seems to take a transcendent identity rather dif- ferent from that of her followers and one which appears modelled on the incarnate Christ. She represents in her physical being a First Cause, virtually eternal and pre- existent. Jehovah is subordinated to a role as Her Son, and other monotheistic divinities - Allah, Jah - are identified as partial understandings of either Mother or Son. Yet the Spirit of the Mother is immanent in every- thing where it contends with the Spirit of Her Son. The Mother literally embodies physical Nature, consubstan- tial with the whole of creation, with the very ground of being, less some familiar sort of deity than a concentra- tion, a leading cusp of a Spinozan unfolding. Her bibli- cal idiom passes over into pantheism or even hylozoism (the view that life is a property of matter); the Son, it is true, will be exiled to his planet and thus perhaps re- main distinct as a principle, but the rest of Nature will, in a very real sense, return to Her, to be reconciled in its original form. Whether She will then maintain some separate identity is none too clear; for these questions are of no great interest to her nor to her followers. Al- though she would certainly disdain a title of Deity, Jea- nette does recognize herself as some preexistent and omnipotent power. Yet we can present her as a materia- list in her emphasis on our return to the Earth; a certain Christian two-memberedness persists, represented in the embodied Earth and in Her Spirit. I find it helpful to read these as immanent and transcendent aspects of the same Mother: in kabbalistic terms the 'lower' and 'upper roots'. What actually constitutes the claim to 'divinity' is not then as obvious as it might seem. Whilst Jewish messiahship comes close and certainly needs to be con- sidered as a marginal case, we might restrict the argu- ment to those cases in which full identification is made with a single omnipotent deity. All the Doukhobor leaders have claimed to be either God or Jesus, a claim which has, naturally enough, antagonized other Cana- dians, yet the Doukhobors also say 'Let us bow down to the God in one another' (Woodcock and Avaku- monic 1968: 92). Similarly, the Black Muslims of the United States have argued that all Black people are di- vine although their founder appears to have initiated the idea when claiming that he (alone) was divine (Lincoln 1961: 73). Attributions of divinity may be assumed by outsiders who conclude from a personal interview with the leader that he alone is regarded as divine when he is merely rather provocatively asserting the divine nature of all men. This may have been the case with the Doukhobors. How are we to interpret the encounter in the 1780s between Robert Hindmarsh, a Swedenbor- gian, and a man in Shoreditch who told him that 'there was no God in the universe but man and that he him- self was God' (Harrison 1979: 40)? Pantheism, the di- vinity of mankind, or a more personal assumption of divinity? Or perhaps just a statement that no death is 'natural', as with the Jamaican Rastas? Another prob- lem is the self-protective dissimulation of many secta- rians: ultra-orthodox Jewish Hasidim may privately ac- cept their particular rebbe as the Messiah even if he would deny this, and Sun Myung Moon appears to en- courage the Unification Church to promote him to God- hood whilst never publicly admitting it. There appear to be various related positions, all of which may be held simultaneously by different mem- bers of a group, or at different times: the leader alone may be recognized as divine and has appropriate abso- lute authority; or the whole community (or all people or creation) are divine; or else the community or mankind just have some sort of 'divine spark', the presence of the Holy Spirit or another emanation of divinity, within them; or else an essentially materialist message is necessarily couched in a prevalent biblical idiom. A situation in which it seems that only the leader is di- vine, but which then turns out to be one where all fol- lowers are divine (Doukhobors, Black Muslims, per- haps the Rastafarians) might actually mean in practice that the leader has less authority than in a movement where he alone claims the status of a prophet or of some not-quite-divine figure such as the numerous Spouses of Christ, Brothers of the Almighty or Women Clothed with the Sun whom we find among radical Protestants. As with the Quakers and Shakers, the group may move from one position to another, usually but not always from divine leader to the divinity of all (compare Father Divine, below). As with the Earth People, what appears to the outsider as an extraordinary claim may not be of any great importance to the group themselves in the course of everyday life; Mother Earth's followers are cheerfully abusive to her - as a 'doctrinal' obligation - except when she sets herself to offer them formal declarations of faith delivered from her position as their mother. The radical Puritans in seventeenth-century Britain furnish numerous instances of ontological promotion. Some clearly distinguished themselves as personally di- vine or semi-divine, but others, such as George Fox, were perhaps merely demonstrating the radical idea that a chosen generation were enacting the Last Days, or else were part of the general Ranter and Quaker 'spreading out of divinity' through provocative antino- mian acts and statements. As such we may take the re- spected Independent minister William Franklin who de- cided he was God and became a Ranter, or the Hack- ney bricklayer who said he was as much God as Jesus Christ had been, both described in Christopher Hill's marvellous book on the inter-regnum sects The World Turned Upside Down (1975). Pantheism or blasphe- mous atheism? The distinction is difficult to draw given the prevailing biblical idiom: beards and long hair were common in imitation of Christ when John Donne's son observed that everybody in Massachusetts seemed to be 'Christ the Messiahs' (Lovejoy 1985: 89). Nor can we assume that individuals or groups were consistent; or in the case of the Ranters altogether serious. Living divinities have appeared transiently in Afro- American societies, as with Mother Earth: particularly in those groups we currently term 'Afrocentric'. An early Rasta, Leonard Howell, seems to have lost his following when he claimed personal divinity. Alexan- der Bedward, a Native Baptist pastor, identified himself as Christ and in 1921 publicly attempted, unsuccess- fully, to ascend into Heaven. In Trinidad, one of the members of Michael X's Black Power commune, Hakim Jamal, claimed to be God, and the White founder of the Jonestown community in Guyana was said by some followers to be divine. From the 1930s until the 1950s, the most notable instance, Father Di- vine, headed a large and influential Black church in the United States incorporating a network of factories, stores and housing projects known as 'heavens' (Harris 1955). As with Mother Earth and Mother Ann Lee, Father Divine provided banquets of free food during a man who had died some years before. 2. We might however cite the recent popularity of Chris Knight's 'sex-stnke theory' of the ongins of culture (1991). (A 'heliolithic' civilization was once thought to characterized by sun worship and megaliths.) 3. One can note similar issues arising in the volkisch turn in German nineteenth century Protestant theology: Jesus as a Jewish rabbi (David Strauss); or as a Roman (Ernest Haeckel); as not being an historical figure at all (Arther Drews), but an image of God (Albert Schweitzer) or Wotan (C.G. Jung). 4. Which Brasilian Spiritists teach in their colleges as 'para-anthropology' (Hess 1994). 5. Sociologists of religion generally allocate religious groups as 'successful' or otherwise, depending on the numbers of their followers. On this quantitative basis, euhemerism has triumphed. If historians of social anthropology generally credit LSE functionalists over solar worshipping UCL diffusionists, I would suggest that a glance at the shelves of a London university bookshop argues something rather different - at least in terms of the shelf lengths devoted to this sort of literature. As Richard Noll concludes in his recent book on 'New Age' mysticism, The Jung Cult, 'it is clear that, in sheer numbers alone, it is Jung who has won the cultural war' (1996:6). Andrews, E. D. 1953.

(Mother Earth's followers are named after local plant foods, Ba- nana, Orange, Cane, Coconut, Cassava, Breadfruit: the deified leader frequently extends a parental role as the source of food.) Recourse to professional medicine was prohibited, for Father Divine was credited with miracu- lous healing powers; and at a meeting in 1936 his church, the Intemational Righteous Govemment Con- vention of the Divine Peace Mission, unanimously passed the motion that 'Father Divine is God'. The idea was not altogether original to him; Father Divine had started off as the follower of another God who assigned him a junior divine status (God in the Sonship Degree); disgruntled early followers who felt that everybody was God had then left the movement in disgust. As they put it, 'God in you, God in me, Everybody be God' (Harris 1955). What we may call the 'diffusion of divinity' to all members appears characteristic of groups which have outlasted the awkward deaths of their divine or near-di- vine founders, the Black Muslims, Shakers and Mug- gletonians. From the very beginning the Quakers dis- credited aspirants to individual divinity such as James Nayler, who triumphantly entered Bristol on a donkey strewn with palms to cries of 'Hosannah' (Fox 1694), and their notion of the actual divinity of all members dwindled rapidly into one of a 'divine spark'. Among the Doukhobors, pantheism and messianic leadership appear to have co-existed quite comfortably for over a hundred years, but for a larger and proselytizing group, the death of the divine founder is difficult to negotiate, and the group collapses; early Christianity may appear the exception, one requiring, as psychologists would put it, cognitive dissonance in its followers at Pente- cost. Jesus's divinity, we may presume, was conferred posthumously. How do individuals choose divinity? Mother Earth told me she had started off, like any good prophet, with regarding herself as the privileged vehicle of divinity, and then it seems, through a transfer of agency, grad- ually allowed this indwelling to displace other aspects of her personality. As the biographer of Mother Ann Lee has put it, 'What she had undergone as an individ- ual she came to believe was really a universal struggle' (Andrews 1953, p.8). The extent to which, in a given situation, the prophet takes herself as simply imitating a divine figure as exemplar, or as being a chosen and unique messenger, or as actually consubstantial with other-worldly power, fluctuates with self-doubt, unex- pected contingencies and the acclamation of others. Joanna Southcott, a well-documented West Country in- stance, appears to have been pushed by expectations in 1813 from her Methodist and Anglican followers (who were coping with a sudden decline in their number) to a public attempt to be 'proved' (Hopkins 1982). She eventually proclaimed that at the age of sixty-five she was about to give birth to Shiloh, a figure she some- what uncertainly identified with the Second Coming of Christ. Earlier, after a number of problematic love af- fairs, she had identified herself as The Woman, then as Eve, then as the Bride of Christ; in all cases fighting the Devil who had seduced woman in Eden: 'For as the dispute began with the Devil and the Woman, it must end with the Devil and the Woman' , now to redeem humankind, as she puts it in one of her pamphlets (Southcott 1802: 299). Declared pregnant by nineteen of the panel of twenty-four doctors who examined her, she died some months after the expected date of de- livery. Her self-ascription as Eve seems to have fitted with certain Hermetic speculations among local Non- Conformists who took Eve as the redeeming figure who, as Genesis has it, would finally bruise Satan's head. Yet Joanna comes close to pantheism in one of her debates with Satan when she affirms 'we shall be as gods' (after Genesis 3:5). Nor is her refusal of Satan's offer of marriage altogether idiosyncratic, given that much of her cosmology memorializes her dissenting farming background: thus Satan had tried to 'ruin' her just as other men had tried, unlettered people like her followers can read the Bible more truly than the learned, and so on. In her pamphlets there is a fluctua- ting identity between her own objectification as 'the woman' of her personal experiences which she narrates to others and 'The Woman' who will crush Satan. Similarly we are never quite sure when we should as- sume she is talking of 'the man' as a particular individ- ual who has previously let her down, or as Satan, Man as Adam, or even Man as all humankind. Mother Earth offers us a consistent and considerably more radical revision of Christianity, now depreciating God but, drawing similarly on her relations with men, she employs her emergent cosmology to explain their past behaviour to her. Unlike Joanna Southcott but in a similar way to Mother Ann Lee, Jeanette takes her pregnancy as the grounds for a grander assumption of divinity, one that does not tack and turn as did the un- fortunate Joanna's but which irrevocably reduces God to a representation of her own jealous son.

At her death, she left a sealed box with directions that it should be opened at a time of national crisis in the presence of the assembled bishops of the Church of England. The box was opened in 1927, at the request of the National Laboratory of Psy- chical Research, one suffragan bishop actually being present, and was found to contain some coins, a broken horse pistol and a copy of a rather doubtful novel, The Surprises of Love, by John Cleland. Was the postulation of strong euhemerism by earlier anthropologists necessarily 'debunking' of religious be- lief? I'd venture to suggest that euhemerism remains a popular idea for the materialist-in-the-street as much now as in the eighteenth century: Q. (adherent): 'Well, who then are the gods?'; A. (sceptic): 'They are simply your delusional projections of your leaders' (or some- thing like that). Take however the contemporary in- stance of antiquarian supernaturalism - not only of the Glastonbury, Templars, Stonehenge, menhirs, pyramids 4 and leylines sort of popular anthropology , but the re- lated Ecofeminism of the mystical wing of the women's movement. Here euhemerism becomes doctrinally cen- tral. Like Mother Earth and Robertson Smith, the eco- feminists argue the Queen of Sheba as evidence of a primitive matriarchy, and the usual schema which owes much to Bachofen and Engels is less that of the divini- zation of historical personages than of the divinization of their actions: starting from a 'shamanic' Neolithic culture in which femininity is prized and which wor- shipped its leaders as the Goddess under various names - Isis, Hathor, Danu, Ishtar, Nana, Astarte - along with matrilineal descent and property owning by women (Van Cles-Roden 1961). From about 3000 BC in this history, the Goddess was gradually ousted by Indo-Eu- ropean invaders with their horses, masculine battle-axe cults, and gods of fire and storm: an Ur-kultur of Phal- locentrism (La Barre 1982) represented in the cosmo- logies of the ancient Middle East and Aegean: Indra defeats Danu, Baal defeats Lota, etc. The Goddess comes to be represented as a defeated serpent or dra- gon, paternity is now recognized, and female chastity and virginity prized in a patrilineal if not patriarchal system. Like related Afrocentric ideas, ecofeminist an- tiquarianism seems to have been strongly influenced by University College London heliolithic diffusionism5; as Cartoon by Thomas Rowlandson, 1814, depicting Joanna Southcott.

The most polished variant of this popular euhemerist anthropology is perhaps to be found in Jung's Analyti- cal Psychology, which proposes in phylogenetic mode that the historical fall divinized as myth is now reca- pitulated physically and psychologically in every indi- vidual's personal development. The historical shift to patriarchy has not been in our best interests; to fulfil ourselves, men and women alike now have to return to the irrational Great Mother inside us all, on the route to full self-deification. In a recent revision, in what we can term the 'science fiction cults' (Scientology, Heaven's Gate), Christian deities are regarded as imperfect under- standings of real, albeit galactic, events. Euhemerist ex- planations, it is true, were conceived of primarily as a materialist debunking. But they have themselves become religions or potential therapies, anti-ritualist and transformative, self-examinations aimed at 'know- ing yourself' as the expression of both psychotherapists and the Gnostics has it (Pagels 1982). They seem ca- pable of articulating a variety of pragmatic resistances, frequently in association with the revaluing of women's social position; for, to reverse the ancient revolt of the solar hero against his mother, we elide both history 'out there' and its residues in our contemporary make-up; through recapitulation every individual continues within them the conflict between Mother and Son, female and male, life and science, moon and sun. The psychologi- cal, the geographical, the historical and the mythical collapse into each other. We are all gods. I've emphasized today the example of divine women rather than men, because I think they show more dis- tinctive and radical claims to divinity in Christianized societies. The extent to which we choose to regard these claims as fitting into an existing religious schema, the extent to which they presume a new one, is arbi- trary. In the passage from human to divine, the histori- cal personage casts its shade over the institutions over which divinity presides: the angry and vengeful deities of Don Pedro and the Emperor Dessalines, the nurtu- rant humanitarianism of Mother Earth and Mother Ann, the sheer glorious incompetence of Joanna Southcott. It is not only in the case of standardized spirit possession in Haiti - or in the devotee's Imitation of Christ, or in my instances of strong euhemerism - that the follower engages in an accessible mimesis of the divine de- ceased. We might propose that all new religious dogmas and institutions involve us in some way in identification with their innovators' unique personal characteristics.
