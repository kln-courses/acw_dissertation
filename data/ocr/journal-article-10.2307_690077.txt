<plain_text><page sequence="1">Toward a Theory of Intellectual Change: The Social Causes of Philosophies Randall Collins University of California, Riverside Based on historical comparisons among master-pupil chains and other aspects of social networks among philosophers, some principles are suggested regarding long-term intellectual change. The higher the eminence of philosophers, the more tightly they are connected to intergenerational chains of other eminent philos- ophers, and to horizontal circles of the intellectual community. Intellectual creativity proceeds through the contemporaneous development of rival positions, dividing up the available attention space in the intellectual community. Strong thought-communities, those that have strong external (religious or political) support for their institutional base, subdivide to maximize internal distinctiveness; weakly supported thought-communities disappear or amalgamate by syncretism. External conditions thus affect the content of ideas indirectly by affecting the space available in the internal field of the intellectual community. The content of philosophies, the degree of abstraction and self-conscious reflection upon intel- lectual operations, depends on how many generations intellectual networks maintain continuity under conditions of creative rivalry. New positions are produced by competitive appropriation of prior ideas and by negation of preexisting positions along the lines of greatest organizational rivalry. Can anything be said about the conditions that determine long-term patterns of intellectual production? Any answer must come from comparative research on a macro-historical scale. I have been engaged in such a project for a number of years. What I present here is its theoretical core, a sociological theory of the movement of ideas. It is AUTHOR'S NOTE: For comments and suggestions on earlier drafts I am indebted to Wolfram Eberhard, Sal Restivo, Joseph Bryant, William Vallicella, Nathan Sivin, and Roger Krohn.

Thus I have focused upon the history of philosophy, over many centuries and in several societies. Although philosophy may not be a "science," it has a social structure as an intellectual community, which can be understood by extending the techniques and theories of the sociology of science.1 The comparison between philosophy and the empirical sciences may be viewed as a device for laying bare the social determinants of theory per se, of intellectual change as it proceeds "through its own logic." I am suggesting that this "logic" of development is not the kind of transcen- dental entity implied by internalist views of science, but is itself socially patterned. The history of philosophy can help reveal these social patterns, how "pure ideas" are driven by themselves- which is to say, how new philosophy is driven by older philosophy, in the hands of historically existing philosophers. By extension, we may be able to see the social determinants of that aspect of the empirical sciences that is theory driven. What is needed is to capture the social organization of the intellectual world itself, instead of attempting to reduce ideas directly to the milieu of the surrounding society. Here has been the flaw in much historical sociology of intellectual life-as if, for instance, classical Greek philosophy directly reflected the class structure or the commercial ethos of Greek society, or Chinese philosophy represented the outlook of an inland agrarian empire. The causes of intellectual activity at its higher levels are more proximate: the organization and continuity of intellec- tual communities themselves over long periods of time. These structures can be understood by an application of existing methods. Derek Price ([1963] 1986) pioneered methods for analyzing large-scale scientific communities over long periods of time: measuring the shape and size of scientific publication, patterns of citations linking together publications, and the stratification of productivity among scientists. Price's concep- tion of "invisible colleges" at the forefront of intellectual developments is especially applicable to philosophers. My research in collaboration with Ben-David showed that a particular kind of social community, master-pupil chains across intellectual generations, is involved in the creation and institutionalization of new disciplines (Ben-David and Collins 1966); while Ben-David's (1971) comparative studies showed the effects of changes in the organizational structures (especially educational institutions) as the base in which these intellectual networks are</page><page sequence="3">Collins / Intellectual Change 109 embedded. Griffith and Mullins (1972; Mullins 1973) extended these themes into a model of "theory groups" transforming through a sequence of network structures as scientific innovations develop and become routinized. This type of sociology of science has the advantage that it gives us a multicausal and multilevel theory of intellectual activity. It is not necessary to force cultural history into a mold, whether as an evolution of rationality or as cyclical rise and fall; nor to see the history of philosophy merely as a prelude to the rise of science, or as the progressive unmasking of the pretensions of metaphysics. At the other extreme, we can avoid the fragmentary character of historical relativism, in which insistence on the uniqueness of every culture obscures structural relationships within them. A sociology of science focusing on intellectual communities gives us several strategic advantages. First, intellectual life is always the product of multiple causes, which may combine in different ways in different cases. The varieties that meet us on the surface of intellectual history can be seen as the results of varying combinations of a smaller number of generative structures. And, second, the social relations among intel- lectuals themselves-the linkages, the conflicts, and the methods of work within intellectual communities-are the most immediate social determinants of the ideas that are produced. That does not mean that external economic and political causes are to be excluded entirely. Putting the two preceding points together, I argue that political and other external conditions are among the several causes that affect the production of ideas, and that their effect is filtered through the internal structure of intellectual communities. Historical Cases I wish to stress a dual relationship between theory and history. On one side, historical analyses and comparisons provide essential material for developing a sociological theory. On the other side, theory is also being used to illuminate these histories. The latter is what Weber claimed was the role of theoretical conceptions: that theory is only a means to an end, and the real payoff is understanding the concrete and particular. I am in partial sympathy with this position. There is a fascination in the sheer substance of intellectual history; seeing it simultaneously as a social history increases that richness, and I hope to give a deeper and more vivid sense of the reality that was medieval India,</page><page sequence="4">110 Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values let us say, or Han China. But for the sociologist who wishes to advance our knowledge to the utmost, history is like the song of the sirens; if one gives in to it too fully, one loses one's analytical perspective amidst the particulars, and fails to illuminate them as well as one could. Equally sad (and usually overlooked) are the intellectual gains foregone when one fails to derive as much theoretical advance as one could from sustaining a more abstract analysis of patterns across historical materials. One reason that Weber has been the standard bearer for historical sociology is that he tended to disregard his own historicist injunction, and to pursue both paths of the history/theory connection. I have been assembling materials making up six large cases: the intellectual communities of philosophers in India from the Vedic period through approximately A.D. 1500; China from the Warring States period through the beginning of the Ming Dynasty; ancient Greece and the Hellenistic world from Thales through the fall of the Roman Empire; medieval Islam and Judaism, during the period when they were a single intellectual unit, that is, from ca. A.D. 700 to A.D. 1400;2 medieval Christendom during approximately the same time period; and modern European philosophy from 1600 to 1950. A dauntingly large scale of material, indeed. What makes it manageable at all is the analytical focus upon the organizational and network structures of intellectual communities rather than upon individual philosophers per se. Hence my first task has been to accumulate as large a number of philosophers as possible, to locate them in time and space, and to chart out their organizational and network links to each other and to the institutions that mediate their positions in their surrounding societies. This has meant examining primarily the organizational dynamics of education and of religion; it has been in these two institutions that most philosophers have been based. On the first level, then, I trace the network patterns of intellectual communities, especially the links of masters and pupils that give them continuity across generations. On a second level, I am concerned with the institutional history of churches and schools in each society, upon whose material resources most intellectual communities have depended. As a third level of this multitiered sociology, I show the influence of the politics and economics of the surrounding society upon these institutions within it. I have concentrated not simply on the most famous philosophers, but also as much as possible on the lesser ones: not merely Confucius, Chu Hsi, and Chuang-tzu, but also Wang Ch'ung and Seng-chao, and even</page><page sequence="5">Collins / Intellectual Change 111 Tzu-kung and Li T'ung; for a different culture area, the likes of Parmenides and Aristotle are set off by Aristippus and Cleanthes at one level, and by Nausiphanes and Lyco at another; yet again, Abelard and Duns Scotus must be played off against William of Champeaux and Alexander of Hales, and still further against Thierry of Chartres and Peter d'Ailly. We know the conditions for the appearance of influential philosophers and major changes by comparison with periods of unsuccessful experiment or intellectual stagnation. It is by examining these variations that we arrive at an explanation of the larger course of philosophy, including its most famous episodes. There is of course a danger of anachronism in applying the conception of "philosophy" to activity in widely differing historical contexts, of imposing a Eurocentric bias upon work that in many cases was understood quite differently from how modern philosophers view their field. The core definition of philosophy I am using is the analysis, at some level of abstraction, of the topics of metaphysics, epistemology, logic, or value. All such definitions have fuzzy edges. Relatively explicit, specialized, and abstract treatments of these topics are activities that emerge over the history of certain intellectual communities. Neverthe- less, I am not in sympathy with the extreme position of cultural relativism. History does indeed consist of particulars surrounded by other particulars, making up patterns that on the level of concrete description are irrepeatable. But it is possible to understand just these particularities as the intersection of variations in more fundamental generative structures. Our aim should be not to ride roughshod over particularities, but rather to do them the full justice of understanding why just that sort of particularity exists at a certain time and place. This is also true of our own intellectual situation. The modern definition of "philosophy" is indeed historically emergent; by focusing on long-term intellectual chains it is possible to see how this happened as a structural phenomenon. Usually, the earliest figures in any comprehensive history of philos- ophy are ones about which there is legitimate doubt. Indian philosophy grows out of the Vedic hymns accompanying religious rituals; it is only after several layers of commentary that themes arise at the explicit level of abstraction that we would call philosophical. Such development out of reified and unreflective religious texts is typical of most of the world philosophical traditions. In China, early "philosophy" is embedded in traditions about divination and the magic-ritual powers of kings; for centuries, the more rationalistic reflections usually stuck close to</page><page sequence="6">112 Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values political issues and ideologies. Early Greek philosophy seems closer to us because of its comparative secularism and intellectual detachment, but even on this score there are problems. Thales, with whom histories of philosophy usually start, was traditionally known as one of the "Seven Sages." Yet the other "Sages" are not strictly what we would call philosophers, but primarily politicians who were known for their judgment and pithy sayings. Thus Solon (Thales' contemporary) might also count as a philosopher in some sense (he was an intellectual, a poet), but do we want to count such other "Sages" as Pittacus, or Bias of Priene, who were politicians but not intellectuals? Actually, the comparison is useful, because it makes us see that Thales' initial reputation may well have been due to his political advocacy more than to any cosmology or mathematics he may have put forward. My methodological point is that it is not necessary to draw a strict dividing line; the existence of mixed cases at the borders is an empirical phenomenon worth examining in its own right. By concentrating on network structures, it is possible to see when an intellectual community structure acquires continuity, and thus gives us a sociological criterion for judging what sort of contribution particular persons have made. In this article, I will not attempt to describe the historical patterns, but to present the current state of my theorizing, with some illustrations that I hope will whet your interest for the larger project. The Basic Model The general principle that I wish to propose is this: Intellectual history is the result of the competitive appropriation and elaboration of accumulated intellectual capital among the number of factions existing at any time. Let us note the following implications. (a) Intellectual history is a conflict process. It is divergent factions that make it go. These factions attempt to make intellectual property out of ideas that have been produced in the past. They generate new ideas largely in opposition to the ideas of their rivals, sometimes by recombining these ideas. Strikingly new positions are produced largely by the negation of preexisting positions, along the lines of greatest political rivalry. (b) This is a multifactor process. There are two main sorts of patterns; call them sequential and simultaneous, or vertical and horizontal, or processes accumulating across time and those spread out in space. The</page><page sequence="7">Collins / Intellectual Change 113 simultaneous factor is the structure of the competitive field, the number of factions arguing with one another at any point in time. Here an explanatory theory must tell us what determines the number of positions at any one time, the appearance of new ones, and the disappearance of old ones. I am also proposing that the creativity of particular factions is to be explained by these "horizontal" config- urations, as is the direction in which they develop their ideas. (c) The sequential factor, on the other hand, is an important determinant of the content of philosophies. It is the sheer cumulation of ideas upon older ones, and the later reflections upon them in the form of new syntheses, negations, and formalizations, that constitutes the growing stocks of intellectual capital. Here I will propose some principles of how intellectual materials unfold over time. The social conditions that determine the extent of continuity of intellectual chains across generations, then, also indirectly influence the contents of ideas produced. I will deal first with the structural questions, then with the sequential patterns. The Structure of Intellectual Competition and its Causes Let us begin by looking inductively at the overall pattern of philosophy's history. I have attempted to make the initial selection of intellectuals as wide as possible, without undue concern for disciplinary labels, in an effort to probe a wide periphery. As Price ([1963] 1986, 69, 107-108, 257) has demonstrated for modern citation and publication data (extending back to scientists of the seventeenth century), the proportion of publications by and citations to (and hence the influence of) intellectuals falls off rapidly as one leaves the central core. Thus I am fairly confident of having captured the main outlines of these intellectual communities. The universe so far analyzed includes some 160 figures for medieval Christendom, 480 for ancient Greece, 50 for medieval Islam and Judaism, and 280 for China. For India, a different method had to be followed, due to the paucity of data on individuals and the vagueness of dates; here I have focused predominantly on organized schools or religious orders, although sometimes on the location of individual philosophers as well. I have not yet assembled comprehensive network charts for modern European philosophers, although I will mention some results from narrower case studies.</page><page sequence="8">114 Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values Since this analysis places emphasis on the structural relationships within and between organized intellectual communities, I want to introduce a brief methodological discussion. In retrospective analysis such as this, methodology cannot be mechanically applied; meth- odological issues are theoretical issues as well. It has been conventional in intellectual history to write in terms of "schools." Texts as far back as the Warring States period of ancient China (ca. 300 B.C.) spoke of "the hundred schools" (chia). Diogenes Laertius (ca. A.D. 200) grouped his biographies into Ionian and Italian schools or "successions." But there are at least four different things that could be meant by "school": (i) The loosest meaning is that certain individuals share similar modes of thought. But this does not imply anything about their social organization in the intellectual world, especially if the similarities are not recognized until much later. The historian Ssu-ma Tan (ca. 110 B.C.) first grouped earlier Chinese philosophers into six "schools," among them the "Taoist school" (tao-chia). But this was the first time the term had been used to designate a school; Tao was a term used in many different intellectual camps over the previous centuries, and the emergence of a tightly organized Taoist religious faction was to come in the centuries after Ssu-ma Tan. Similarly, biography compilers such as Diogenes Laertius are notorious for imposing neat master-pupil "successions" on what were often only retrospective intellectual similarities. (ii) A more rigorous way of using the concept of school is to demonstrate that there were intellectual influences among its members. This is the principal pursuit of intellectual historians. There is a sociological equivalent that makes these connections more formal: This is the method of studying citation chains. Modern citation analysis uses bibliographies or footnote references; although this style of reference is relatively modern, one can produce the equivalent in older texts by references to sources and predecessors. Here method is also substance; for intellectual activity is the transmission and reworking of cultural capital, and citation chains show some of the major lines along which that transmission takes place. Thus Price ([1963] 1986, 110; 1975, 125) shows how the combination of a given number of "parent" publications engender an "offspring" publication, and also calculates the distribution of publications that are fecund or sterile in succeeding intellectual generations. With cruder measures, one can nevertheless follow the same logic for the transmission and fecundity (or lack of transmission and sterility) of lines of philosophical ideas over much longer gener-</page><page sequence="9">Collins / Intellectual Change 115 ations. Citation chains show patterns in the movement of cultural capital. (iii) Even more explicit social connections can be traced in the form of chains of personal relationships. The most important of these are relationships between teachers and their pupils, especially when such chains continue across several generations. In addition to vertical teacher-pupil relations, horizontal links are also important, personal contacts among contemporary thinkers. As has been found in a number of sciences, coherent groups are frequently involved at the center of intellectual change. In the history of philosophy this pattern includes such far-flung instances as the circle of the Ch'eng brothers (ca. A.D. 1050-1100) that created neo-Confucianism, the overlapping circles of Fichte, Schelling, and Hegel in the 1790s that produced German idealism, or the Paris existentialists during World War II. (iv) Finally, a "school" can be quite literally an organization. It can be a place where teaching takes place, and the authority and property are passed down through an explicit succession, as in the Platonic Academy, the Aristotelian Lyceum, or Chu Hsi's neo-Confucian White Deer Hollow Academy (Marrou 1964,76-136,2895-2897; Grayeff 1974, 13-85; Frischer 1982, 39-66; Chaffee 1985, 89-93). Another variant under this rubric are formally organized religions or political move- ments: the Mohists in Warring States China, the Pythagoreans, the guilds of Vedic priests, the various Buddhist lineages, and so forth. Here the doctrine is part of the organizational property, and often an emblem of its social identity, a Durkheimian sacred object that is the focus of membership. I use all three of the stronger criteria of intellectual organization: proto-citation chains, the vertical and horizontal networks of personal contact, and organizational memberships. Frequently one type of information is more available than the others. It is not desirable to combine these mechanically as "indicators" of some hypothetical construct called the "school." Instead, it is the interplay among the different levels of social organization that is the key to intellectual continuity, creativity, and stagnation. Historical sources, especially for remote periods, are often frag- mentary, and the whole enterprise of reconstructing intellectual com- munities may seem like looking for landmarks in the mist. History itself, however, was not mist but structure, no matter how it may sometimes seem to us as we try to catch a glimpse in the distance. We cannot find the structures unless we are aided by a heuristic conception of what it is</page><page sequence="10">116 Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values most plausible to look for, a conception that of course can be revised as we go along. It is in this spirit that I put forward the following empirical generalizations, which will in turn lead into theoretical considerations. (1) Major intellectual work tends to be concentrated in time, space, and social connections. (1 a) Intellectual work is almost always concentrated in the same time period as other work of a similar degree of innovativeness and scope. The major philosophers almost always appear in pairs or trios, rival positions being developed contemporaneously with each other (i.e., they are intellectually active within the same generational span, approxi- mately thirty years). This very widespread pattern suggests a social basis for innovation, in the structure of competition within intellectual communities. We can take as emblematic the fact that Heraclitus, the partisan of absolute flux, was contemporary (ca. 490-470 B.C.) with Parmenides, the partisan of absolute immutable Being. Epicurus and Zeno the Stoic established their rival schools within five years of one another (306-301 B.C.)-the two schools that were to dominate Hellenistic and Roman intellectual life for many centuries. In a later epoch, the leading Christian and rival pagan philosophers, Origen and Plotinus, appeared close together (ca. A.D. 220-260). In China ca. 340-300 B.C. Mencius, Chuang-tzu, and Hui Shih were contemporaries and rivals; centuries later, the rationalist and idealist branches of neo-Confucianism were championed by the acquaintances Chu Hsi and Lu Chiu-yiian (flour- ished A.D. 1170-1200). Nearer our own day, the Vienna Circle of logical positivists and the existentialists were not only contemporary (ca. 1925- 1945), but developed some of their most memorable doctrines (such as the positivist verifiability program) in opposition to each other. The pattern of contemporaneous creativity by opponents of comparable stature is nearly universal across all the historical cases, although there are some exceptions. It is the structure of the intellectual field that is important in these intellectual developments, not merely the individuals or their separate intellectual lineages. I want to stress this, because the rivalries are not necessarily personal ones. Contemporary advocates of rival positions do not always direct their attacks against each other, or even pay attention to them. For instance, Epicurus and Zeno had their own agendas and argued mainly against philosophies and doctrines of preceding generations; explicit rivalry between their schools only developed in succeeding generations. What I am contending is that the</page><page sequence="11">Collins / Intellectual Change 117 structure of the intellectual field has opened up certain "spaces" that are filled, not merely by individuals, but by several intellectual movements that restructure the space by pressing in different directions. ( 1 b) Notable intellectual activity typically has been concentrated, at any given time, in a small number of places. To take the case of ancient Greece: We find first a center at Miletos, succeeded briefly by several nearby cities; then at Elea and Croton in Southern Italy, joined in the 400s B.C. by Abdera and Athens. In the 300s there are a number of short-lived schools in various places (Cyzicus, Cyrene, Megara, Elis), whose successors (along with those of all of the surviving schools of those mentioned above) concentrate in the late 300s in Athens. Later philosophical activity shifts to Alexandria and episodically at Rhodes and Rome, with periodic resurgences at Athens; still later philosophy disperses to a number of places, where it is mostly carried out in rather undistinguished fashion. Similar patterns of concentration are found at the most creative periods for other cases: In China, there was the Chi-hsia Academy in the late Warring States period, imitated by gatherings of scholars under the patronage of other local rulers; in India, the great Buddhist intellectual center at Nalanda; in the Islamic/Judaic medieval world, Baghdad, Basra, and Sura (all in Mesopotamia) in the early period, later Cairo, Cordova, and Toledo, and then wide dispersion during the decline of Muslim philosophy. In Medieval Europe, Paris was dominant from 1100 to 1300, flanked by Chartres and Laon in the early period and by Oxford and Cologne during the great climax of the 1200s, giving way to geographical dispersion of philos- ophers in the 1300s and 1400s. The generalization emerges: Periods of great intellectual creativity in philosophy are those in which there is geographical concentration in three or fewer centers; where intellectual life is more dispersed, the level of creativity is lower.3 (lc) The most notable philosophers are not organizational isolates, but members of chains of teachers and students who are themselves known philosophers, and/or of circles of contemporary intellectuals. The most notable philosophers are likely to be students of other highly notable philosophers. In addition to this vertical organization of social networks across generations, creative intellectuals tend to belong to groups of intellectual peers. (These are circles of allies, in addition to the existence of contemporary rivals noted in la.) For example, in Greece, I have divided philosophers into dominant, major, secondary, and minor figures, based on the amount of space they receive in both ancient (Diogenes Laertius) and modern histories</page><page sequence="12">118 Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values (Windelband [1901] 1958; Kirk and Raven 1983; Guthrie 1961-1982; Dict. Sci. Biog.; Ency. Phil.; Reale 1985, 1987; Long 1986; Rist 1969; Dillon 1977; Cambridge Hist. 1967). Network links are calculated both backward (to predecessors and associates) and forward (to pupils). Calling these the "input" and "output" sides of the networks, we find: Input links Output links Number of philosophers Dominant 3.8 4.9 9 Major 2.0 1.8 21 Secondary 1.4 1.0 69 Minor 0.7 0.4 224 The dominant philosophers have, on the average, considerably more predecessors and associates who are intellectually significant than major philosophers do, and so on down the line. The disparities are even greater on the output side. Moreover, if we examine the network in regard to how eminent are those intellectuals to whom each one is linked, we find that the more eminent philosophers themselves tend to be more closely linked to others at high levels of eminence. Of 30 philosophers at the major and dominant levels, 21 (70%) are linked to others at those levels, as compared to 32 of 69 (46%) secondary philosophers who are so linked. Generally speaking, the higher up in the ranking of eminence, the more connections: Socrates is connected with 4 other major philosophers and with 10 secondary ones; Plato is connected with 3 major and 6 secondary philosophers. Similarly, in medieval Christendom, of 15 major figures, virtually all are linked in known teacher-student chains, as compared to less than one-fifth of minor figures. Most of the major philosophers are linked to other major philosophers. Peter Abelard was the student of the two most important philosophers of his day, and gave rise to a host of important pupils; Albertus Magnus was the teacher of Thomas Aquinas. In India, often we know only of the school and its writings, without knowing the names or dates of individual philosophers within it. Descriptions of intellectual life indicate that in India these were not mere "schools of thought," but organizations that placed great emphasis on personal transmission in an intellectual lineage. Of the Indian philos- ophers whom we know as individuals, virtually all are linked in personal chains (especially among the Buddhists). Chinese philosophers have strong organization in chains and groups. In the Muslim/Jewish world, on the other hand, chains and major philosophers were sparser, although there were some lengthy chains in the theological schools.</page><page sequence="13">Collins / Intellectual Change 119 Here again we encounter issues that might seem methodological, but that lead us into the heart of theoretical substance. First, what is the criterion of a philosopher's degree of eminence, when we are comparing across historical settings? And second, how can the chain that follows a philosopher in time be causally important? The first problem arises because someone who is a minor figure in our eyes might have been a major character in the intellectual field of his contemporaries. Plato, for example, did not have a reputation in his own day that outstripped several other members of Socrates' circle, including Aristippus, the founder of the hedonistic Cyrenaic school, or Antisthenes, the forerunner of ascetic Cynicism. A philosopher's importance is ultimately a matter of influence within the intellectual field. There is both short-term and long-term impact. These can be estimated by a combination of methods: the amount of reference to a particular philosopher in the classic texts (the equivalent of modern citation counts), the longevity of such "citations," and the relative amount of space devoted to a philosopher in classic as well as modern histories. Some figures must be considered merely incidental by virtue of the fact that they enter my universe of philosophers only because they are mentioned as predecessors, associates, or students in a text by or about a more important philosopher. In other words, their only claim to fame is their connection with someone else, rather than their indepen- dent contribution to ideas. In addition to these external connections, let us consider the qualitative content of the ideas produced. Here it is useful to abstract somewhat from specific contents and consider whether there is anything generic about the kinds of intellectual contributions that are considered "major." In philosophy, this typically involves a breakthrough to a new level of abstraction, often by recognizing problems that arise with the application of a new kind of logical rigor, or by making conceptual distinctions. Major developments have frequently taken reified or traditional conceptions/entities and subjected them to explicit reflec- tion. Confucius is eminent primarily because he moved ordinary discourse and practice regarding traditional Chinese religious ritual into a topic for reflection on the nature of rites and righteousness. Similarly, the philosophical significance of the Upanishads is in passages that go beyond describing ritual practices and giving myths that justify them, to raising explicit issues about the nature of the religious and secular constituents of existence.4 These examples are from the beginnings of philosophies; I suggest that transitions occur throughout history</page><page sequence="14">120 Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values although at quite different levels of abstraction and with different specific contents. Major episodes of philosophical creativity are those that reshape the dimensions of the space on which intellectual games are played. This is not to say that all movement in the history of philosophy is in the direction of greater abstraction and self-reflection. As we shall see in a later section, there are also episodes in the other direction, and ways in which philosophical traditions cling to rather concrete or reified notions as one part of their intellectual position, while defending it with more reflective and rationalistic methods. Having seen the usual character of major innovation in philosophy, we can ask: Is there a structural difference between intellectuals with short-term and those with long-term reputations? It is the latter who reshape the intellectual field in such a way that its trajectory is permanently different and whom we therefore legitimately regard as "major" philosophers. Part of the answer is implied in the relationship between the eminence of philosophers and the extent to which they are embedded in chains of other philosophers, especially those who are themselves eminent. Important philosophers are linked both forwards and backwards in time. One might assume that only backwards links should be counted, since they alone can be causes of what happens after them.5 Forward links might seem merely an artifact: The notable philosopher is one who becomes known, and having famous students is one way to do this. But it is possible to become famous without having equally famous students; and pupils become famous because they strike out in new directions on their own. Plato's fame, for example, does not depend on Aristotle; instead, the fact that the former was able to have a student of this eminence shows that the social conditions in the intellectual field that crystallized around Plato were powerful enough to produce noteworthy achievement even in new directions. This is why creativity typically has connections in both directions. It is the chain itself, and the social conditions that make it possible, that elevates particular individuals into the status of the creative geniuses that we separate out for special treatment in our intellectual histories. Is it possible that the whole pattern is a methodological artifact? I have shown that eminent philosophers tend to be connected to other eminent philosophers; and the more eminent they are, the closer the connection. Isn't this tautological: We seem to define philosophers as eminent when they are well connected in their intellectual communities, then argue that the cause of their eminence is the connection? The</page><page sequence="15">Collins / Intellectual Change 121 answer is no; there is less circularity than meets the eye. It can be shown that the model is not simply required by my implicit definitions. For one thing, there are empirical exceptions. In the Greco-Roman world, the important isolates from significant chains are Heraclitus and Philo of Alexandria (flourished A.D. 40). In India, the Hindu pantheist Ramanuja (ca. A.D. 1100) appeared at a time when there were apparently neither immediate predecessors, descendants, nor rivals of any contemporaneous eminence, although he did come from one of the Vedantin orders founded by Shankara. In Europe, the most important philosophers between 1600 and 1750-Bacon, Descartes, Hobbes, Spinoza, Leibniz, Locke, Berkeley, Hume-usually stand apart from major teacher-pupil chains, but virtually all were active in the central intellectual circles of the time.6 Similarly, there are a few exceptions to the principle (la) about rivalry at similar levels of creativity: These include the Syrian neo- Platonist Iamblichus (flourished ca. A.D. 300-330); John Scotus Erigena (flourished A.D. 850); in Islam, al-Ghazali (flourished 1090); and several possible instances in India (although it is hard to be sure, Indian chronology being what it is): Nagarjuna (perhaps ca. A.D. 150) and Dharmakirti (ca. A.D. 500-600) (the two most notable of Buddhist philosophers), as well as Ramanuja (ca. 1100). (Dharmakirti, like Iamblichus and al-Ghazali, is nevertheless linked in a teaching chain of the most distinguished philosophers, and Nagarjuna had a significant disciple, Aryadeva.) Those who are exceptions to the rivalry pattern (principle 1 a) are for the most part not exceptions from the linkages of place (principle lb) and teaching chains (principle lc). More abstractly, it is certainly possible to conceive of a situation in which eminent philosophers are not contemporaries, nor personally connected in chains, nor members of the same organizations, nor concentrated in the same places. That such structures are actually found is not due to a conceptual tautology. But the model as stated is incomplete. If we grant that the chain helps constitute the creativity of the individuals within it, what is it that the chain is doing that makes this possible? In one direction, looking backwards from any particular individual, we see the transmission of cultural capital. But notice that personal contact seems to be important. Even in times when books are available (such as in twentieth-century philosophy), the intellectual capital that the most creative intellectuals build upon typically comes through personal channels (such as in the</page><page sequence="16">122 Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values teacher-pupil chains Brentano-Husserl-Heidegger or Whitehead- Russell-Wittgenstein). A general exposure to the ideas of the time is not sufficient for first-rate intellectual performance; personal contact with a leading practitioner focuses attention on those aspects of the larger mass of ideas that constitute the analytical cutting edge. Creative intellectuals of each new generation, of course, take off from this point in new directions. Personal contact with leaders of the previous generation can help here, too, not so much in the substance as in the style of work; there is a transmission, so to speak, of emotional energy, of a role model of how to aim at the highest levels of intellectual work. Analytically, there are two different processes operating. Creativity requires the social conditions that sustain a chain; this allows the continuity of a tradition of cultural capital, allowing the build-up of higher levels of abstraction and reflectiveness within it. In addition, there must be conditions that push toward the transformation of the nature of the cultural capital, that is, which energize creativity in the narrower sense. These conditions are larger than any single chain, as we can see from the pattern of rivalry, of simultaneous creativity among opposing positions. The working of both conditions is implied in the pattern of concentration of intellectual activity in a few geographical centers. Creativity is associated neither with absolute concentration within a single organization, nor with wide dispersion, but rather with a small number of organizational centers. Moreover, the two kinds of condition are cumulatively reinforcing. It is when the structural con- ditions for creativity are sustained, generation after generation, and when generations are vertically linked through personal connections, that the creativity of the whole system reaches especially high levels. (2) The law of small numbers operates. The number of intellectually active schools of thought is almost always on the order of three to six. There is a strong lower limit; as noted in principle la, creativity can scarcely occur without at least rival positions, and indeed almost always in any creative period there are at least three. There is also an upper limit; whenever there are more than about six distinct positions, most of them are not propagated across subsequent generations. The principle is dynamic; that is, positions appear and disappear, grow stronger and weaker in adherents. But the "law of small numbers" is maintained; indeed, it seems to pattern these shifts. Strong positions, those that have dominant external support, subdivide in subsequent generations into as many as four to five factions. On the other side, weak</page><page sequence="17">Collins / Intellectual Change 123 positions (those that have a poor or declining external base) tend to disappear, or to amalgamate over time by developing syncretisms. This pattern is found in all the large historical cases I have examined. For illustration, I will sketch one case (based on Das Gupta 1963; Stcherbatski 1962; Muller 1962; Radhakrishnan and Moore 1957; Takakusu [1956] 1973; Chattopadhyaya 1969; Conze 1969; Guenther 1972; Kalupahana 1976; Raju 1985). In ancient India, when the Vedic religion was the sole source of intellectual activity (ca. 1500-700 B.C.), it split into four or five factions (the four Vedas, four schools of priests, with some further compli- cations). When rival positions rejecting this religious tradition appeared (ca. 600-500 B.C.), notably the Buddhists and Jainas, the Vedic factions reunited into one. The Buddhists in turn grew powerful, receiving imperial patronage from the Maurya (ca. 300-180 B.C.) and later the Gupta (ca. A.D. 335-500) regimes, and split into a number of competing schools (most notably ca. 340-140 B.C.), of which four or five were philosophically important. As the Hindu religion revived and regained political influence (beginning in outlying regions and then in the Ganges core), the Buddhist positions died out or syncretized until by A.D. 900 what remained was a single school again (in India, that is, rather than in other parts of the Buddhist world). Meanwhile the resurgent Hindus split into six orthodox schools (crystallizing ca. A.D. 100-400). These too had their shifts; some of them amalgamated (Yoga and Samkhya; Nyaya and Vaisesika), while the most popular schools, in their periods of greatest creativity, subsplit into further factions. The Mimamsa realists, the extreme conservative faction of the Hindu revival, split into two groups in the 700s. The idealist Vedantists, who ultimately became the most popular school of all, split into monist, dualist, and theist wings after their victory in the 800s over the other Hindu schools, and the virtual disappearance of Buddhism from India. The "law of small numbers" is an empirical generalization. Here again a methodological point has substantive importance. How can one tell how many "schools" there are? As I indicated in an earlier section, we cannot rely on a loose retrospective imputation of similarities and differences that may not have been recognized at the time. But there are three techniques for locating objective structures; of these three, the socially most firmly rooted distinctions are among real organizations, such as the religious sects or educational institutions found in much of the Indian, Chinese, and Greek materials. The "law of small numbers"</page><page sequence="18">124 Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values holds up well using this technique, and also in the patterns of master- pupil and horizontal group networks. This is not surprising, since networks are often based upon such organizations, or act as proto- organizations. I have not yet investigated whether "citation chains" on the purely intellectual level also follow this pattern; one might expect this to be so insofar as organizations and networks are the basis of intellectual transmission, although there also may be more citation to opponents, and other respects in which intellectual connections overlap more widely than concrete social structures. Why should this pattern exist? There are several aspects to the question. One is the structural issue: Why should the number of self- sustaining groups be three to six? There is also the dynamic issue: Why do schools rise and fall? Combining the two issues: When do schools rise and fall, and why do they split or amalgamate? The structural question has already been partially answered. There is a lower limit because intellectual creativity is a conflict process. If there is any creativity at all, there must be an organizational basis in the intellectual world for at least two positions. If there is freedom to have more than one position, a third always seems available (a plague on both houses is always a viable intellectual strategy); so, in fact, there are usually at least three.7 The upper limit derives from the structure of conflict as well. Even though new positions are largely structured by the negation of existing positions, individual philosophers need allies if their positions are to be transmitted to anyone else and propagated across generations. Hence proliferation of new positions beyond six (the level at which groups can still be relatively large and visible) is self- defeating. This does not mean that there cannot be periods when the number of positions is very large. It was dangerously high, for instance, in Plato's generation in Greece (when in addition to the Academy there were also the schools of Megara, Cyrene, Elis, Abdera, Cyzicus, the followers of Antisthenes, Isocrates' school of rhetoric, and the remnants of the Pythagoreans). It appears to have been very large in the Upanishadic period in India, and in the first efflorescence of Buddhist doctrinal splits (the "18 schools," around 200 B.C.); again, we hear of the alleged "hundred schools" in Warring States China (although this is rhetorical exaggeration). But most of the positions drop out within a generation, leaving the total below the structural limit of three to six. Conflict is limited by itself. (3) Schools of thought rise and fall due to the fortunes of their organizational bases. Philosophies do not rise and fall because they</page><page sequence="19">Collins / Intellectual Change 125 defeat other positions in intellectual argument, or are defeated by them. Highly sophisticated positions have been driven out by much simpler, anthropomorphic or anti-intellectual positions. This occurred in the destruction of Buddhist, as well as the more technical Hindu, philosophy in late medieval India; or of rationalistic Islamic and Jewish philosophy after ca. A.D. 1200 by mystics, Kabbalists, and antiphilosophical traditionalists (Fakhry 1983; Scholem 1946); or again in Greece toward the end of the Hellenistic period. Conversely, any position with sufficient social support seems to be able to maintain itself intellectually for an indefinite period. This happens despite explicit and logically strong attacks upon it. In India, the old mythic Vedas, in the period of the Hindu revival (by about A.D. 300), not only were defended again by philosophers using new rationalistic modes of argument, but were used on the offensive against their more rationalistic opponents. The great conservative dialectician Nagarjuna (ca. A.D. 150) could not destroy the Buddhist scholastics, and indeed they came to their greatest philosophical efflorescence after his attack, even in his home base at Nalanda (ca. A.D. 450-600). In Greece, contradictions within the Stoic position (between its ontological doctrine of the perfection and causal necessity of the world, and its ethical doctrine of ascetic self-restraint against the temptations of the senses) were vigorously pointed out by its opponents for several centuries, but did not weaken its popularity; on the contrary, they seemed to revitalize the school by forcing it to elaborate new intellectual defenses. A great many other examples from these and the other historical cases could be adduced. The point is not that philosophical schools under attack can survive by ignoring their opponents; quite the contrary. But it always seems to be possible to offer explicit defenses of any philosophical position, if there is motivation to do so. These defenses have, I think, a predictable pattern. To a considerable degree, the shifting contents of philosophies consist of these accretions. In general, the pattern is to add a logical and epistemological framework, while maintaining the same basic ontolog- ical and ethical assertions. This point will be developed under point 6. I have argued that strongly based schools always find ways of defending themselves intellectually, and that they are never convinced by their opponents' arguments. Weak schools on the other hand are motivated to seek allies. It is striking what kinds of intellectual lines can be crossed in doing so. If there are strong political pressures for alliance-that is, if factions share a common threat from a position</page><page sequence="20">126 Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values whose external source of support is drastically different from their own-positions that have strongly opposed one another on intellectual grounds can find a way of presenting themselves as aspects of a common truth. Platonism syncretized with Skepticism as it lost popularity to the Stoics; later, Plato, Aristotle, and Stoicism were gradually combined in the pagan defense against the threat of Christianity (Windelband [1901] 1958, 213-215, 235-251; Dillon, 1977, 186-189, 249-250, 415). In India, Theravadin and Mahayana positions, originally vehement opponents across many lines of difference, in later times of stress gave rise to syncretisms, as most of the separate schools died out (Stcherbatski 1962, 35-46). In medieval Islam, Christendom, and elsewhere, strikingly dis- parate positions have been combined at various times: personal mysticism and natural science (the Pure Brethren ca. A.D. 900 in Islam), anthropomorphic religion and materialist atomism (the Mu'tazilites ca. A.D. 800-1000 in Islam), or logical nominalism and mysticism (1300s in Europe) (Fakhry 1983, 53-55, 164-181; Watt 1985, 74; Copleston 1963, 212-218; Knowles 1962, 328-332). In China ca. 250 B.C., antipolitical Taoist quietism was pressed into service by its apparent opposite, hyper- interventionist authoritarian Legalism, as a kind of anti-Confucian united front (Schwartz 1985, 243-253, 343-345). European intellectuals for centuries reconciled the claims of dogmatic, anthropomorphic Christianity with rationalistic, even mechanistic science, because the weakness of their external supports demanded the compromise. All intellectual combinations seem possible; the intellectual means by which such combinations have been made, along with the defenses of strongly based positions such as those mentioned in the preceding paragraph, make up much of the analytical development of philosophy.8 What are the external bases of philosophical positions, then, and what causes their rise and fall? These bases are the organizations that provide the material continuity of intellectual activity. These in turn owe their fortunes to conditions that are political, in the large sense. For long historical periods, the significant political positions were factions within a church or rivalries among different churches or cults, both of which were usually linked to political struggles within or among states. Hindu and Buddhist schools were linked to rival imperial and anti-imperial factions in India (Buddhism generally being the imperial faction). Hence the rise and fall of Buddhist and Hindu philosophies, and consequently their splits and amalgamations, were linked to the rise and fall of the centralizing Maurya and Gupta empires in the north, and of rival Hindu kingdoms in the south, which eventually retook the north as well. The</page><page sequence="21">Collins / Intellectual Change 127 structure of the politics, of course, varies a great deal in different historical cases. In ancient Greece, philosophical factions were con- nected at first with opportunities opened up by shifting religious and political structures in city-state politics, while later the underpinnings shifted as Hellenistic and Roman empire-building undercut local politics, and still later the external base involved the religious politics of Christianity and its rivals. There are other political dynamics in the histories of China, Islam, and Medieval Europe. It might seem from these materials that this model is relevant only in times when philosophers are directly supported by religious institutions or by the immediate patronage of political audiences, and that once philosophy becomes academicized by finding a permanent home with universities, it becomes insulated from these outside pressures. My explorations of modern European philosophy suggests otherwise. For instance, I have shown (Collins, 1987) that the transformation of the German university system at the turn of the nineteenth century, against the backdrop of political crisis, set in motion the institutional dynamics that brought about the upsurge of modern Idealist philosophy. My point is not that the contents of philosophies reflect political/ religious ideologies. Generally speaking they do not, except at an initial period where a religious doctrine becomes the basis for a group of intellectuals and hence of a philosophical school. Thereafter the process is one of elaboration by opposition and by the search for allies. The internal processes of the intellectual community create their own materials; all of the more abstract and sophisticated ideas are created in this way.9 Furthermore, the number of philosophical factions is not limited by the number of political factions. At any one point in time, there might be no more than two of the latter (and frequently one is overwhelmingly dominant); whereas the internal processes of the intellectual community tend to produce factionalization on the order of three to six positions (and sometimes more in the short run). The external political/religious oppositions merely anchor the range of intellectual factions; as noted, the more strongly supported position tends to split internally, the weaker to consolidate. Thus there are usually more philosophical positions than political ones. But the pattern is not indeterminate. Instead, we have a three-phased order of causality. Political fortunes are the crucial external linkage, determining the rise and fall of the organizations that support intel- lectual life. Within these organizational shifts, the "law of small</page><page sequence="22">128 Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values numbers" gives a structure to the internal maneuvering of philosophers for maximal personal success. These processes determine the contents of philosophies thus elaborated, and also determine which new positions will be created and which will disappear. Notice what the foregoing formulation does to Kuhn's theory of revolutions. The pattern I have described, concerning the imper- viousness of strong schools to their rivals' criticism, or indeed to their own internal contradictions, is essentially the same kind of evidence out of which Kuhn formulated his notion of paradigm. But Kuhn's model captures only half of the process. He sees the ability of schools of thought to maintain themselves against criticism, but he has an inadequate view of the causes of their breakdown. The sheer accu- mulation of anomalies, be it carried ever so far, would not serve to break down a strongly supported paradigm. What is required is a shift in external supports. Conversely, where Kuhn leaves a blank as to where the new paradigm comes from, I would argue that it comes from the structure of accumulated intellectual capital within the intellectual field itself. This material is elaborated either by negation (see point 7 below), as "room" for a new position opens up, or by a search for ways to defend or synthesize existing positions (as in point 3 above). I am suggesting, then, that scientific revolutions are part of a larger pattern of intellectual competition, in which philosophy also shares. The degree to which intellectual factions incorporate empirical evidence gathering is itself a product of the combination of external and internal politics I have described. In the case of the Copernican revolution, for instance, the crisis of the Reformation and the large political and institutional shift of that period shifted material support away from the traditionally dominant intellectual factions. The Reformation was the denouement of a long-standing crisis in the financial and employment situation of the Church, involving the decline of most older universities (especially in Italy, Spain, and France), but also the rise of new ones in formerly peripheral areas such as Germany (see sources cited in Collins 1981). The pattern of external support for university intellectuals was undergoing a long and profound shift. Let me repeat: The number of intellectual factions is generally greater than the number of operative political bases. What brought about the displacement of the Ptolemaic- Aristotelian paradigm was not an accumulation of anomalies (most of these had been in existence for centuries, and their number was not initially reduced by Copernicus' crude model), but the opening up of room for new positions within the reconstituted intellectual field. The</page><page sequence="23">Collins / Intellectual Change 129 Ptolemaic paradigm was driven out, in the end, by the "law of small numbers"; it had become structurally redundant. In general, I think this is how all intellectual revolutions, including those in physical science, come about. (4) Periods of greatest intellectual creativity are periods of major organizational transition. A corollary of the last point is that the great philosophers appear at times when the external forces undergirding the intellectual field are shifting. The most sophisticated philosophies, of course, will not appear at the beginning of a sequence, but after enough internally generated materials have accumulated. Thus it is the later of a series of politically-driven organizational shifts that are the occasion for the greatest philosophers. Moreover, the shift need not be one that favors the intellectual faction in question. A faction that is losing political support or otherwise suffering an eroding base may nevertheless be creative, since its representatives are motivated to generate alliances among nearby positions, and thus to make a new synthesis. Hence many of the greatest philosophers appear in the last generation or so before a school actually disappears. This is the case with Plotinus, in the last gasp of pagan philosophy, writing two generations before the Roman Emperors converted to Christianity (ca. A.D. 230-60); Dharmakirti, the greatest of the Buddhist philosophers, writing (ca. A.D. 550-600) just before Buddhism was destroyed in its Ganges homeland (though commentators survived for a few centuries in Kashmir and Bengal); Averroes, the last of the Cordova school (writing 30 years before Cordova fell to the Christians in 1238); Duns Scotus, the greatest of the medieval metaphysicians, writing on the verge of the political collapse of Papal theocracy. The obverse of the principle is also worth noting. If periods of creativity occur at times of organizational transition-for intellectual factions, times of new opportunities or of pressures to seek new alliances-periods of intellectual stagnation or stability are the result of periods when the balance of external political forces is unchanging. Having a plurality of intellectual factions is not enough to ensure creativity, if their supports are relatively constant. Thus the most creative periods of the Platonic, Aristotelian, Epicurean, and Stoic schools are at or soon after their times of establishment; creativity declined during most of the next two centuries of the Hellenistic period. The main activity was a series of alliances as the weakening Platonic school shifted to Skepticism, a negativistic "antiposition" within the intellectual field. Only with the rise of new religious movements in the</page><page sequence="24">130 Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values late Roman republic and thereafter did philosophy once again begin to create new positions. Political history of course is full of changes; only certain kinds of these are favorable to intellectual change. To summarize the long sweep of Chinese history, for example, it is possible to say that the establish- ment of a new government (a new dynasty) is not usually of much consequence intellectually. Philosophies do not arise simply because of the need by a new government for legitimation, which is usually available from other sources anyway. Nor are severe breakdowns of government favorable for philosophy, since these tend to destroy the infrastructure on which intellectual activity is based. At the opposite extreme, too much governmental support is counterproductive; we see this in the stifling effects on intellectual creativity when Taoism and Confucianism were officially routinized during the Chinese middle ages. Generally, the Confucians were creative only during times when they were in opposition: Han Yu and Li Ao (ca. A.D. 800), attacking Buddhist patronage; the neo-Confucian Ch'eng brothers (ca. 1070- 1100), and later Chu Hsi (ca. 1190), banned and proscribed; and still later Wang Yang-Ming (ca. 1500-30), revolting against the Chu Hsi doctrines that had since become orthodoxy. Chinese Buddhists similarly were most creative philosophically during times when their patronage base was substantial but in flux. It is the relative balance of power between the organizational bases of intellectual factions that is most favorable to creativity. The Contents of Philosophies The preceding discussion of structural relations among rival intel- lectual factions and their outside supports has dealt primarily with the form of philosophical activity. Principles 1 through 4 tell us under what conditions creative thinking will take place, when and where and in what relations to existing philosophical positions. These principles have skirted the actual contents of philosophies, except to suggest the directions in which there will be new intellectual distinctions or syncretisms. Now I want to propose three further principles dealing with contents. Intellectuals make their careers by producing intellectual works. Since there is no credit gained by literally repeating earlier works, subsequent intellectuals searching for eminence are motivated to</page><page sequence="25">Collins / Intellectual Change 131 produce something that has not been done before. At the same time, the need for social support both within and outside the intellectual field (and other factors as well) motivates intellectuals to make use of the ideas previously accumulated. The balance between these two moti- vations can range from innovations based on conflicts, negations, or syntheses of previous materials, to a dogmatic adherence to the doctrines of a school. Nevertheless, over time both of these kinds of processes produce sequential changes in the contents of philosophies. These are set forth in the next two hypotheses. (5) Factional loyalists produce a steadily lengthening corpus of scholastic materials. If a school has a steady external base of support, its intellectual position remains "stagnant." This is not to say that such intellectuals do nothing at all. What they do produce is first, the compilation of a classic text; then, its gradual lengthening; third, commentaries upon the classics; and, eventually, if there is an edu- cational organization of any degree of complexity, scholastic classifi- cation of its contents and categories, and historical studies of the accumulated corpus. Such activities are ones by which intellectuals can keep themselves busy making "new" contributions, and hence make intellectual careers for themselves, while remaining identified as com- pletely loyal to their tradition. These processes may be observed in the lengthening corpus of orthodox Buddhist schools (the Abhidharma scholasticism) during their period of political security under the Maurya dynasty; in the four long-standing schools of Hellenistic Greece and the Roman period; in the period of compilation of summas in medieval Europe; in the building of the Confucian and Taoist canons and commentaries during the Chinese middle ages; and in the commentaries and supercom- mentaries that made up much of the life of Islamic philosophy. This is typically the process by which a religious doctrine, originally put forward dogmatically and in a concrete, reified form, gradually acquires an intellectual structure reflecting the autonomous activity of intel- lectuals. The starting point is externally given materials that are arbitrary from a purely intellectual perspective; but if organizational continuity is maintained, formal developments take on a life of their own. To some extent, this process of "scholasticizing" goes on within any long-lasting school, even as that school also undergoes periods of external conflict that force it to innovate more substantively. In that</page><page sequence="26">132 Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values case, the two kinds of processes go on together. The scholasticizing process might be called "factional," whereas the processes to be described in principle 6 are "interfactional."'? (6) Conflict among rival positions produces a trend toward abstrac- tion and self-conscious reflection on intellectual objects. There are times when rival intellectual factions must struggle for precedence within the intellectual field. These are the periods of shifting external bases of support. But as we have noticed, the number of intellectual positions (especially in the short run) tends to be larger than the number of broad external supports. External shifts set intellectuals in motion, some exploiting the room now available for additional positions, others forced to construct alliances in order to survive. Thus external shifts bring about periods in which, perhaps for several generations, intellectual competition is heightened, and intellectuals are forced to pay close attention to the arguments of their opponents. But I have already noted that they are rarely convinced by those arguments. How is this contradiction resolved? What happens is that certain components of their positions remain the same, but new ones are built upon them. The first statements in any philosophical tradition are bare ontological or value assertions: reve- lations of the way the world is, or injunctions regarding how one must act or what the realm of value is, often presented in strikingly literary language. This is the form taken by the systems of the earliest Pre- Socratics in Greece; of the Upanishads and the initial Buddhist philosophy in India; of the first philosophical commentaries on the Bible and the Koran. Periods of competition among rival ontologies lead these to be stated in more formal argument. The intellectual community begins to make distinctions among concepts and eventually among levels of analysis. The degree of abstraction is raised, and the significance of abstractions per se may be recognized and debated. If competition continues at a high level of intensity, proofs are attempted. This happens in Greece with Parmenides, the first formal philosopher; in Buddhist philosophy, it is reached at the time of Nagarjuna; in medieval Christianity and Islam, it is illustrated by proofs of the existence of God (purely intellectual exercises, since atheism was not a real option). In China, formal argument develops at the most intense period of intellectual competition, around the Chi-hsia Academy and similar centers ca. 350-250 B.C., with Hui Shih and Kung-sun Lung's "school of names" and the formal efforts of the Mohist logicians (Graham 1978). This style of argument, however, was not maintained,</page><page sequence="27">Collins / Intellectual Change 133 especially after the rise of scholasticizing classificatory schemes in the Han dynasty. In conjunction with the movements toward proofs, canons of logic may be established. These are not only used in ontological argument, but can become an independent specialty or faction of themselves. This happened in Greece with the Megarian, Aristotelian, and Stoic schools; in medieval Europe at several periods with the rise of dialectical/nomi- nalist schools; and in India in the Nyaya school and its Buddhist counterparts (Kneale and Kneale 1984; Stcherbatski 1962). Thus the body of logic, as material developed by an independent faction, can undergo its own "factional" sequence of scholastic development (ac- cording to principle 5). Epistemological theories are produced as part of this sequence. If conditions for a high degree of conflict still continue at the point at which proofs and logical canons have been asserted, the ground of interfactional arguments shifts to the general question of the process of knowledge. Here we find a repetition, in miniature, of the interfactional sequence already noted. The conditions for a full-fledged critical epistemology include not only an accumulation of materials that have gone through the above stages of argument (ontological assertion and so on), but an external political situation in which the state loses its power or interest in defending the dogmas of religion. Only then does it become safe for philosophers to raise the question seriously of whether there is any truth at all. And these conditions must coincide with external shifts motivating a phase of philosophical creativity, especially the stable rivalry of opposing ontological positions. Given the complexity of this combination, it is perhaps not surprising that such philosophies have rarely been formulated. Not all kinds of intellectual competition, however, lead to increases in the level of abstraction and self-reflection. Where the organizational bases of rival factions are strong, attacks and defenses may go on for a long time at a concrete and intellectually unproductive level. In medieval China, the typical response by Taoists to Buddhism was not to engage its metaphysical arguments at all, but to charge that the Buddha was an impostor, insofar as Lao-tzu had founded the doctrine himself when he wandered off to the West at the end of his life. Confucians at this time dismissed Buddhism as un-Chinese because monks did not honor their parents; only later, during the well-organized neo-Confucian movement, were metaphysical arguments taken seriously (Ch'en 1964, 184-185, 215; Needham 1956, 410-418). Only where organizational and</page><page sequence="28">134 Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values network structures have the configurations suggested above does rivalry produce those changes in the level of abstraction and self-reflection of intellectual conceptions that we count as real philosophical creativity. It should be borne in mind that the higher levels of reflection on concepts and mental operations do not necessarily displace substantive ontological and value topics. It is true that a distinctive tendency of European philosophy since the time of Descartes has been to elevate epistemological issues over all others, and sometimes-especially in twentieth-century philosophy-to dismiss all other issues as illegitimate. But ontological and value issues can be raised at any level of abstraction and reflectiveness, and there have been episodic resurgences of meta- physics, such as the outburst of Idealism in Germany ca. 1790-1820, and elsewhere later in the nineteenth century. Ontological and value schemes can be separated (as is typical of twentieth-century Anglophone ethics) or fused (as in such systems as neo-Platonism, or existentialism). The level of abstraction and self-reflection attained is the product of one set of conditions in the intellectual world; it is crosscut by other conditions that determine which substantive concerns, if any, are the material for philosophical activity. (7) New positions are produced by negation of preexisting positions along the lines of greatest organizational rivalry. It should be apparent by now that the contents of philosophies are not produced in any simple sequence. This is because there is an interplay of three processes: the accretion of scholasticizing that goes on over time within a faction as it works over its own materials; successive upgradings of abstraction and self-consciousness about intellectual operations, proceeding if the social organization sustains it from ontological and value assertion, to formal proof, logic, and epistem- ology; and the horizontal pressures of the "law of small numbers," which push philosophers at some times into syncretisms, at others into creating entirely new factional positions. Principle 7 is about the very last of these processes. When there is "room"for a new position in the intellectual field, ambitious thinkers will search for those elements in the available corpus of materials that will maximally contradict the existing prominent positions. For example, in medieval Islam during the Baghdad period, the Mu'tazilah theologians (ca. A.D. 800), attempting to counter the popularity among intellectuals of Greek neo-Platonism and Aris- totelianism, revived the materialist atomism of Democritus and com- bined it with traditional anthropomorphic religion (Husik [1916] 1969,</page><page sequence="29">Collins / Intellectual Change 135 xxi-xxii; Fakhry 1983, 53-55). In ancient China, the most formidable organizational rival to the traditionalist Confucian scholars, Mohism, produced a doctrine that contradicted Confucius' program on all its major points (Schwartz 1985, 139-162). In medieval India, the defenders of the old Vedic sacrificial cult, the Mimamsas, countered the idealism and relativism of the Buddhists by asserting both materialism and theism. Together with the allied Hindu Nyaya-Vaisesika school, when pressed in argument onto logical grounds, they did not retreat, but elaborated an extreme version of logical realism against their nominalist opponents (Stcherbatski [1930] 1962, 48-52; Raju 1985, 47-60). In medieval Europe, the distinctive points in Duns Scotus's system were drawn from a critique of the weak points in the system of Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas's system had recently been adopted as the official doctrine of the Dominicans, and hence Scotus, sponsored by the head of the rival Franciscan order, gravitated toward maximal distinctiveness in formulating an oppositional position for the Franciscans. To give one last example, Aristotle, responding to his failure to be named Plato's successor at the Academy and to the opportunities for support of a new faction given by Macedonian expansion (including the accident of being a native of the Macedonian homeland), sought for a position that would be distinctive from Plato's theory of the forms and from rival materialist, paradoxical, and rhetorical systems. He managed to generate this in the form of a supersystem, which classified the different kinds of analysis of his predecessors into four kinds of causes (material, formal, efficient, final). Thus Aristotle not only moved to a new level of analytical abstraction, but managed to negate each of his rivals' major claims, including replacing Plato's static and transcendental universe with a world of material becoming. Negation, of course, is never absolute. In order for a philosophical faction to negate certain of its rival's positions, it must at least occupy the same turf and address the same kind of audience. That means that in some respects rivals will always share certain concepts and assumptions. I suggest that rivals typically take for granted roughly the same level of abstraction (although pushing that level upwards, or resisting such a push, may also be a weapon in debate); that is, rivals will be at the same or adjacent levels in the hierarchy of self-reflectiveness. Where they differ, perhaps bitterly, is in the ontological or value content expressed in those terms. It is here that maximal contradiction should be most in evidence.lt</page><page sequence="30">136 Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values Conclusion Can this theory be extended to account for anything about intellectual change in disciplines other than philosophy? We might analyze an empirical science into two kinds of social components, one of which structures the activities of empirical research, the other scientists' theorizing. In the successful empirical sciences, these two components are mutually constraining. Presumably the latter may consist of the same features of intellectual communities that I have analyzed for philosophy. Philosophy is also structurally similar to another discipline that is detached from empirical inputs, and has produced most of its advances out of its own intellectual resources, namely, mathematics. The social determinants of change in mathematics also should reveal something of the theory-driven component of the empirical sciences. At a minimum, the comparison of the intellectual network/ organiza- tional structure of philosophy, mathematics, and natural science shows us what is distinctive about these intellectual communities. To put it cryptically, I suggest that philosophy consists of the productions of those intellectuals who have sought out the intellectual space, among possible specializations, which appears foundational at any point in time. (I am implying that what is "foundational" depends on the relations among intellectual specializations at any given time, rather than being fixed.) Mathematics, as Restivo and I proposed (Restivo and Collins 1982; Collins and Restivo 1983), takes as its territory the cumulative reflection upon formal mnemonics embodying the past history of the most disciplined operations of intellectual argument themselves. How these social structures connect to the dynamics of intellectual communities within the empirical disciplines remains to be seen. Notes 1. There is a small amount of research that applies sociological methods to philosophy, including Mills ([1942] 1969), Bloor (1983), Bryant (1986), Lamont (1987), and Collins (1987). Whitley (1984) includes philosophy in his grid of social structures of scientific communities. 2. Most medieval Jewish philosophers wrote in Arabic before A. D. 1200-1300. After that time, Jewish philosophy gradually moved north of the Pyrenees and into the Christian orbit (Husik [1916] 1969, xx; Fakhry 1983, 273-275). Similarly, Nestorian and Jacobite Christians, cut off from Rome and Byzantium, were active in Muslim philosophical circles (Fakhry 1983, 107, 109).</page><page sequence="31">Collins / Intellectual Change 137 3. The correlation is noted for the case of Muslim philosophy after A.D. 1250 by Watt (1985, 133-134). 4. Thus I disagree with the position of Levi-Strauss ([1962] 1966) that there is philosophy embedded in any system of categories. Whatever may be implicit in a concrete discourse is only known when it is explicitly raised to the level of abstract reflection. Moreover, history did not have to wait for a Levi-Strauss to appear in the twentieth century; concrete mythology and religion were themselves the starting points for successive reflections that created the major philosophical traditions. 5. Links backwards to significant teachers are indeed favorable conditions for creative philosophers. We see this for the network data presented above on Greek philosophers in which both input and output links vary significantly from dominant on down to minor philosophers. To avoid misunderstanding, I would like to reiterate that these are links to predecessors who are themselves sufficiently notable as to have some independent standing in the intellectual world. Virtually everyone has some teachers or other network connections; hence one might think superficially that some figures, especially the minor ones, do not lack network connections but merely suffer from our lack of information about whom their connections were with. My empirical point is that there is a tighter network connection among the relatively eminent. Of course, not every eminent philosopher can have eminent forebears, since this would make new beginnings impossible. 6. Descartes, although he never taught, had a number of disciples in Holland who spread his doctrine to France and Germany. Spinoza had contact with these disciples and with the science-oriented correspondence network organized successively by Mersenne and Oldenburg. This famous "invisible college," formed by Mersenne in Paris in the 1620s, was continued for more than 60 years by the followers of Descartes and Gassendi. This group personally connected with Descartes, Hobbes, Pascal, Leibniz, and Locke, as well as the leaders of mathematics and natural science (Dict. Sci. Biog. Vol. 9,316; Ency. Phil. Vol. 2, 38-39; Vol. 4,31). Hume studied with Cartesians at La Fleche as late as 1734-1737, while composing his Treatise of Human Nature (Daiches, Jones and Jones 1986, 43). 7. This may explain why, as Holton ([1973] 1988) points out, fundamental themata of intellectual discourse almost always come in opposing pairs or trios. Holton is referring to basic intellectual commitments within the natural sciences, but this appears to be an aspect of the deep intellectual structure common to all disciplines. 8. I should add that organizational weakness is not the only condition under which intellectuals borrow from other positions. Role hybrids (Ben-David 1960; Ben-David and Collins 1966) combining diverse intellectual capital-and usually based on intersecting personal networks-are also important in intellectual innovation. As usual, the overall pattern is multicausal. 9. This is not to say that external ideological themes from political or class interests may not also directly intrude into the contents of philosophy. For instance, Bryant (n.d.) argues that Plato's universalistic metaphysics was shaped in a contradictory manner by his commitment to social elitism. What I would contend is that external social influences affect the basic value content (and sometimes the ontological commitments), but that the analytic conceptions are shaped by the internal structure of the intellectual community. 10. Scholasticism can take a variety of forms. One of these, prominent in China from the Han dynasty onwards, elaborated classification schemes of correspondences among numbers, symbols, elements of the cosmos and of the human realm; this is similar to</page><page sequence="32">138 Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values kabbalism and numerology in the West. A rather different kind of scholasticism is the historical commentary, usually carried out within a secular ethos: for instance, the historical studies of the classics that came to prominence during the Ch'ing dynasty (ca. 1650-1800), in opposition to the religiousness of neo-Confucianism (Fung 1948, 321; Fung 1952, 630-631). If we view the scholasticizing dynamic analytically, then some such dynamic will also occur within any long-lasting intellectual community. Even within an empirical science, one can expect to find the equivalent of a "scholasticizing" dynamic. This may consist of a classification scheme for empirical materials (as in botany or other traditional field sciences); or of historicist commentaries on earlier works treated as "classics" (an activity prominent in late twentieth-century social science, and institu- tionalized in the discipline of the history of science). 11. Thus, I suggest, Holton's ([1973] 1988) pairs of opposing themata are contradictory on similar levels of abstraction. References Ben-David, Joseph. 1960. Roles and innovations in medicine.
