<plain_text><page sequence="1">Jim Stark: Sculpture James Marrow Sculpture has always been the characteristic medium of artistic expression of all that is archetypical and elemental in human form. From the Venus figurines of pre-history, through the semi-divine and heroic statues of Egypt, Greece, and Rome, the figures of Sluter and Michelangelo, and the modern works of Maillol, Lachaise, and Henry Moore, sculpture has served as the essential vehicle for statements about the basic expressive properties of corporeal form. No matter what the illusionistic capabilities of graphic representation, the sculptural form has never been displaced in its directness of association with the primal and magical: the mask, idol, totem, and amulet are all works of sculpture. The sculpture of Jim Stark is, above all, an exploration of the qualities of the fundamental forms of nature. Stark's forms are primarily anthropomorphous, but animal and vegetal forms are also to be found, sometimes simultaneously. Stark's real subject matter is biomorphic form - the forms of life. Stark's sculpture partakes of the elemental and the magical in its primary concern with the essence of life. This quality is apparent in the leafy or pod forms of the vegetal works, with their obvious evocation of growth and germination, but is no less evident in the anthropomorphic figures composed of the structural elements of animal life forms: of bone, organs, and muscle. The forms alternately swell, twist, and subside, they stand erect and droop; nimble or in repose they display latent and kinetic energy. Even the most skeletal of the figures, reminiscent of fossils from some primordial landscape, retain the association with growth peculiar to organic forms. Stark interprets the generative principle of nature: his figures are animated by the fluent power of life. Working within his vocabulary of life-forms, Stark explores different expressive and formal problems. His expression ranges from near-brutal strength to maternal composure, from graceful physical exuberance to tragic defeat. One of his standing figures attains a mood of solitude analogous to that in a Giacometti statue. A reclining figure exhibits a nobility and monumentality comparable to that of the so-called Dionysius of the east pediment of the Parthenon. But Stark's expression is not simply catalogable. Although his figures are in one sense elemental ones, they evoke multiple associations, associations appropriate to every facet of the life process, from Eros to Thanatos. Among the formal problems with which Stark deals in his sculpture, perhaps the most striking is the integration, or juxtaposition, of organic and inorganic forms. In the extrusions organic forms blend into geometric, abruptly truncated (faceted) ones; in Fallen Totem bone forms are pierced, as it were, by perfectly round rods, again faceted at the ends; 849</page><page sequence="2">..... .....

One need have no knowledge of Stark's predominantly organic vocabulary to detect the tension between forms of such a fundamentally different order, and one readily suspects the intrusive element in the harsher machined forms. The jarring contrasts between organic and inorganic form are intentional and mirror the basic incompatibility between nature and technology. In the extrusions natural forms (materials) are drawn into geometric ones and are irretrievably lost in the process. In the reliefs the anthropomorphic forms are in harmony with the landscape, as if growing with or from it, but the arbitrary geometric contours, the circular hole of Heartland and the evenly measured and numbered diagonals of Medallion, encroach upon, truncate, and disrupt the natural fluidity of organic form. The suspended works introduce the dimension of motion that is only implied in the other works. Pendulum-like and in carefully wrought balance, they allude both to the passage and to the arrest of time. Here also Stark contrasts organic and inorganic form, but his traditional imagery is significantly enhanced by exploitation of temporal references on different levels. Historical time is suggested in Scepter, which recalls the crook-like symbols of authority borne ceremoniously by Egyptian and Mesopotamian rulers, and in the Caltrops, named after the spiked balls of the Middle Ages that were thrown upon the battle field to impede the passage of cavalry. Weapons of the past, encrusted with the patina of age, these images of domination and aggression are suspended in time and neutralized. The organic and man-made elements of which they are composed have achieved an equilibrium which transforms them into potentially functional tools. Stark's sculpture is an act of homage to life. In his forms the artist manifestly probes for the germ of procreativity which seems to vitalize all organic matter. The sculptor would identify the generative principle of nature, understand its powerful but elusive rhythms, and enshrine them in his inflexible medium; the same extrusions which, from one point of view, represent the transformation of natural into geometric form, represent, when read in the other direction, the artist's attempt to create vital organic form out of the inorganic. Stark explores the nuances of human expression in these life forms, thereby identifying the life process itself as the true source of all human expression. The incompatibility between organic and inorganic form is Stark's unveiled metaphor for the danger that man and technology pose to the continuation of organic life; his swelling pods are imprisoned in geometrically formed and faceted rods like the botanical version of an ectopic pregnancy. Yet do not the equilibrium and the timelessness of his suspended forms suggest a mediated view of this antithesis replete with potential depending upon our wisdom?
