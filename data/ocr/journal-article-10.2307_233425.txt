<plain_text><page sequence="1">NEWS OF THE PROFESSION ANNUAL MEETING OF THE HISTORY OF SCIENCE SOCIETY GAINESVILLE, FLORIDA, 26-29 OCTOBER 1989 SOCIETY BUSINESS At the Annual Meeting of the History of Science Society in the Reitz Union, Gaines- ville, Florida, the Council met on 26 Oc- tober 1989 and the Business Meeting on 27 October, with President Mary Jo Nye pre- siding over both. Both meetings opened with announce- ments of the results of the Society's 1989 election. Sally Gregory Kohlstedt was elected Vice-President of the Society for 1990 and 1991; she will serve as President during 1992 and 1993. New members of the Council, who will serve three-year terms through 1992, are John Beatty, Lynn S. Joy, Katharine Park, Joan L. Richards, and Alan J. Rocke. Joe D. Burchfield will serve a two-year term, filling the seat vacated by Sally Kohlstedt. The Nominating Commit- tee for 1990 will consist of Betty Jo Teeter Dobbs (chair), Frederic L. Holmes, and Kenneth Manning (from Council) and Joan Cadden and Alan E. Shapiro (at large). At both meetings President Nye also an- nounced that the Society had just learned that it will receive a grant of $53,250 from the Richard Lounsbery Foundation to sup- port activities proposed by the Committee on Education. These include a syllabus compilation project, a brochure for under- graduates thinking of studying history of science, travel grants to enable college teachers and advanced graduate students to attend the Society's annual meetings, a series of topical essays for teachers, sev- eral service projects, and various National History Day initiatives. The Council heard reports from the of- ficers, the Society's Editor, Ronald L. Numbers, and the chairs of all standing and programmatic committees to the effect that all HSS publications and programs con- tinue to operate well. The Council adopted (as in past years) a balanced budget for 1990/91, introduced by Treasurer Mary Louise Gleason, which called for increases in dues-to $43 for a regular membership, $23 for student and retired memberships, and $64 for a family membership-and for no increase in the institutional subscription rate for Isis, which will remain at $110. Three committee reports were especially noteworthy. For the Committee on Educa- tion, Sally Kohlstedt remarked on the suc- cess of the Society's support for a National History Day prize in the spring of 1989, which Vice-President Stephen G. Brush presented to two high school juniors from Athens, Georgia, who prepared a videotape presentation called "The Einstein Revolu- tion." Pointing to the great opportunity of- fered the Society by the theme for the Na- tional History Day competitions for 1990, "Science and Technology in History," Sally Kohlstedt described the steps that the committee had already taken to promote this event. For the Committee on the Quincenten- nial, Thomas F. Glick reported on the Soci- ety's continuing plans for a joint meeting with the Spanish and Latin American His- tory of Science Societies, scheduled for June 1991 in Madrid. The committee has presented a number of themes to our coun- terpart societies as representative of the areas to which HSS members might con- tribute. Thomas Glick asked that those members interested in proposing sessions on one or more of these themes (reported in the January 1990 issue of the HSS Newslet- ter) contact those charged with oversee- ing the U.S.-originated sections of the pro- gram, Michael McVaugh (University of North Carolina) and Seymour Mauskopf (Duke University). For the HSS-SHOT Joint Committee, Frederic L. Holmes outlined preliminary plans for the conference "Critical Problems and Research Frontiers in History of Sci- ence and Technology," to be held in con- junction with the annual meetings of the two societies in October 1991. He empha- sized that the conference's sessions should represent the broad range of topics that members of both societies consider impor- 506</page><page sequence="2">NEWS OF THE PROFESSION-ISIS, 81: 3: 308 (1990) 507 tant, and that all individuals, groups, and subfields within the history of science should have the opportunity to suggest topics for discussion in the sessions de- voted to the history of science and those common to the history of science and tech- nology. He described plans to urge all HSS members to submit suggestions to the com- mittee and called for the Council to ap- prove the general thrust of these prelimi- nary arrangements. The Council so voted. In other action, the Council voted to (1) authorize the Committee on Finances to in- vest the Society's assets "in accordance with policies of prudent fiscal manage- ment," a decision that effectively removes several limitations that the Committee on Finances had found overly restrictive; (2) withdraw from the National Coordinating Committee for the Promotion of History; (3) appropriate funds for programs pro- posed by the Committee on Women (in- cluding an update of the Directory of Women in the History of Science, Technol- ogy, and Medicine) and the Committee on Independent Scholars (including travel grants for the 1990 meeting in Seattle), and for the work of the Committee on Develop- ment; (4) continue the programs overseen by the Committee on Independent Schol- ars, and establish them as one of the So- ciety's fundraising priorities; (5) continue the Society's Visiting Historians of Science Program, and direct the Committee on Re- search and the Profession to take steps to- ward making it self-sufficient; (6) authorize the Committee on Meetings and Programs to continue planning for a joint meeting with the British Society for the History of Science in the summer of 1992, and for a four-society meeting in 1994; (7) table the recommendation of the Committee on Meetings and Programs to meet in Santa Fe in 1993, pending the compilation of further information about costs of lodging and transportation; and (8) appoint the follow- ing HSS representatives: Thomas F. Glick to the U.S. National Committee for the In- ternational Union of History and Philoso- phy of Science; Loren R. Graham, to the American Association for the Advance- ment of Science Section Committee for Section L, History and Philosophy of Sci- ence; and Bruce V. Lewenstein, to the AAAS Section Committee for Section X, Societal Impacts of Science and Engineer- ing. The Council also reviewed the Society's current procedures for conducting its bien- nial Vice-Presidential elections, through which, in accordance with Statute 9, "the ballot contain[s] the names of two candi- dates [for Vice-President] proposed by the Nominating Committee together with the names of any other candidates nominated by petition signed by at least twenty-five members of the Society." The Council dis- cussed two alternatives to these proce- dures. The first would have the Nominating Committee name one (and only one) candi- date for Vice-President, whose name would be presented to the membership, along with the names of any other candidates nomi- nated by petitions signed by twenty-five (or, as one Council member suggested, fif- teen) members of the Society. The second alternative would have the Nominating Committee name three candidates, whose names would be presented with those of any petition candidates. Under this proce- dure, members would be asked to select their first, second, and third choices for Vice-President, and their votes would be counted in two stages, to ensure that the winner had a majority of positive votes. In the first stage the candidate receiving the third highest number of first-place votes would be eliminated, and in the second stage all ballots that named the eliminated candidate as first choice would be assigned to their second-choice candidate. In discussing these three procedures, members of the Council saw the benefits and limitations of each, and each had its strong proponents. The Council thus charged the Executive Secretary to collect opinions on this question from members of the Society, to publish statements in sup- port of (and opposed to) each procedure in future issues of the Newsletter and, most generally, to bring before the Executive Committee and the Council the information their members need to reach an effective conclusion on the matter. Finally, the Council and the Business Meeting both enthusiastically expressed their warm appreciation to Gerald Holton, who served as HSS President in 1983 and 1984, and who had just retired as Chair of the Society's Committee on Development and Fundraising. In introducing a motion to this effect at both meetings, HSS President Mary Jo Nye reviewed Professor Holton's great accomplishments on behalf of the So- ciety and announced that he had recently been awarded the American Institute of</page><page sequence="3">508 NEWS OF THE PROFESSION-ISIS, 81: 3: 308 (1990) Physics' Gemant Award for his efforts to promote the public understanding of phys- ics. In reply, Professor Holton noted that the Gemant Award is accompanied by a sum of $3,000, for the recipient to present to an institution that had helped his or her efforts. He indicated that he had assigned this sum to the History of Science Society, with the understanding that it would be used to support the Visiting Historians of Science Program and be received in honor of Joseph H. Hazen, a longtime benefactor of the Society whom he called "an espe- cially dear friend." MICHAEL M. SOKAL EXECUTIVE SECRETARY PRIZE ANNOUNCEMENTS Winners of the 1989 History of Science So- ciety awards were announced at the ban- quet at the annual meeting in Gainesville. Five prizes and one special citation were presented. Two prizes honor books in history of sci- ence published in the preceding three years: the Pfizer Award, for an original work of scholarship, and the Watson Davis Prize, for a work aimed at a general lay au- dience. The Derek Price Award (formerly the Zeitlin-Ver Brugge Prize) is given for an outstanding article published in Isis in the three preceding years. This year the History of Women in Science Prize, for a work published in the four previous years, went to a book; next year it will go to an article. The Henry and Ida Schuman Prize is given annually for the best essay submit- ted to the competition by a graduate stu- dent. The Sarton Medal, given for distin- guished contributions of an entire career, was presented to Gerald Holton; the ac- companying citation appears in the next section. A special citation was made to Frances Coulborn Kohler, the Society's Di- rector of Publications, for "a decade of dedication." The 1989 Pfizer Award was presented by Thomas Althuis of Pfizer, Inc., to Lorraine Daston, for Classical Probability in the En- lightenment (Princeton University Press, 1988). The citation, delivered by Nicholas Steneck, read in part as follows. "It is not the place of the classical theory of probability in the history of theories of probability that matters in this book so much as its place in the Enlightenment. What does it mean to be rational? For those who developed and used the classical theory of probability, it meant bringing pre- cision to rational decision making by ren- dering it mathematical. For those Enlight- enment figures bent on pursuing rationality to its limits, no aspect of life was exempt from this goal. "The consequence of such broad applica- bility is an extraordinary challenge for the scholar bent on understanding probabilistic thinking in the Enlightenment. Life is filled with opportunities governed by chance, providing ample ground for Enlightenment figures to test and refine their theory. Das- ton has covered this ground from its early appearance in legal and economic thought through discussions of gambling, insur- ance, jurisprudence, the moral sciences, and more. She explains, in a style that is both lucid and elegant, how and why the classical theory of probability worked, the problems it raised, and ultimately why it was abandoned in the nineteenth century. "Classical Probability in the Enlighten- ment is on one level a distinguished piece of intellectual history, based on the study of an impressive array of both archival and printed sources. On another level, it is a work that challenges historians of science to reflect upon the models that are so often used to describe scientific development. It also advances scholarship on some very difficult topics, such as the history of quan- tification. On yet another level, this work has relevance for the philosophy of sci- ence, and it is a piece that cannot be ig- nored by sociologists of science and histo- rians of the social sciences. Finally, from the standpoint of both our profession and a prize committee that had a difficult time looking over the stack of distinguished works that comprised this year's entries, it is a book that is genuinely enjoyable to read." The 1989 Watson Davis Prize was awarded to Joan Jacobs Brumberg, for Fasting Girls: The Emergence of Anorexia Nervosa as a Modern Disease (Harvard University Press, 1988). Albert Van Helden read the following citation. "Fasting Girls is a study of how the dis- ease category of anorexia nervosa emerged in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. It examines the historical relationship be- tween fasting and female identity from the</page><page sequence="4">NEWS OF THE PROFESSION-ISIS, 81: 3: 308 (1990) 509 early nineteenth-century 'fasting girls,' through the 'flapper' of the 1920s, to the late twentieth-century adolescent. Chang- ing social habits, especially eating habits, sexual practices, and family structure, led to changing disease configurations. Brum- berg describes how the phenomenon of un- dernourishment was taken up by the medi- cal profession and crystallized as a new disease called anorexia nervosa. From that point their interpretations became one fur- ther element shaping the course of this dis- ease, which was neither simply a natural fact nor solely a social construction. "Fasting Girls is the sort of history book we all wish we could write. It is thorough, well crafted, wonderfully written, and mas- sively documented. It is a superb historical account that arouses the admiration of pro- fessional historians and at the same time appeals to a much wider audience. Joan Brumberg has demonstrated that concep- tual sophistication is not antithetical to popular writing." The winner of the Derek Price Award was David C. Lindberg, for his article "Sci- ence as Handmaiden: Roger Bacon and the Patristic Tradition" (Isis, 1987, 78:518- 536). The committee's citation, written by Polly Winsor and read by Bruce Eastwood, went as follows. "Roger Bacon has long been a favorite symbol of the values of modern science triumphing over Scholastic authority. Lind- berg's goal in this important article is the classic task of the historian: to make us un- derstand Bacon not as a man ahead of his time but as one perfectly belonging to it. In an age when an enormous body of new sec- ular texts was threatening the hegemony of theology, Bacon's defense of the sciences consisted of the claim that the new learning would serve rather than endanger Christian belief. Lindberg shows that Bacon's ideas belong to a scholarly tradition stretching back from Hugh of St. Victor to Justin Martyr, and he argues that Bacon 'did not look forward to modern science' so much as he looked 'backward to the patristic tra- dition.' "This article deepens our understanding not only of Bacon but of the making of the history of science. Moving beyond our nat- ural tendency to impose our own prejudices upon the past is surprisingly difficult. Lind- berg's success reminds us of the paramount value of careful historical work, including attention to the changing meaning of words, in the honorable task of replacing myth with history. "Lindberg's exposition is a model of ped- agogy, nicely returning to and elaborating upon a theme. He never leaves the reader in doubt as to what he is claiming and what is his evidence, and he writes with elegant simplicity." The 1989 History of Women in Science Prize went to Joan T. Mark for A Stranger in Her Native Land: Alice Fletcher and the American Indians (University of Nebraska Press, 1988). The citation, presented by Frances Kohler, read in part: "In depicting the complex relations between Americans of European descent, especially sympa- thetic ones such as Alice Fletcher, and na- tive Americans, the work examines an im- portant component of American history. In chronicling Fletcher's often lonely struggle to become a recognized professional in an- thropology, it describes important develop- ments and prominent figures in the field of ethnography. "The book traces Fletcher's career from her apprenticeship under F. W. Putnam at Harvard through her years among different Indian tribes to her 'blossoming as a scholar,' through her eventual realization that her attempts at getting Indians to adopt white civilization had been a 'disaster,' on to her final years, when she put her ener- gies into seconding the work of her col- league and adopted son, the Omaha Francis La Flesche. Mark delineates the complex working and emotional relationship be- tween these two, contrasting their aims. "The book carefully examines Fletcher's professional successes and disappoint- ments, epitomized by her appointment to the lifetime Thaw Fellowship at Harvard when she was the 'preeminent woman sci- entist in the country.' The fellowship sup- ported her but proved a dead end, both for her, as more central posts and other forms of professional recognition went to others, and for women scientists in general, as it did not lead to further positions for women at Harvard or elsewhere. "Joan Mark's Stranger in Her Native Land is an outstanding exploration of one example of the connections between women and science in nineteenth-century America." The 1989 Schuman Prize was awarded to Richard J. Sorrenson of Princeton Univer- sity for his essay "Making a Living Out of Science: John Dollond and the Achromatic</page><page sequence="5">510 NEWS OF THE PROFESSION-ISIS, 81: 3: 308 (1990) Lens." The Schuman Prize Committee, chaired by J. L. Berggren, "found both Sorrenson's account of the events and his analysis of the factors lying behind them to be quite convincing." The committee summed up the essay as follows. "In less than a decade, during the 1750s, an English weaver-turned-optician moved from a public attack on Euler for doubting Newton's claim that it was impossible to make an achromatic lens to marketing a tel- escope based on his discovery of just such a lens. In England the Royal Society, in its citation awarding John Dollond its Copely Prize, certified his discovery as science of the first water, although the nascent state of British patent law at the time meant that it was by no means sure that he could make a living out of his invention. On the Conti- nent, on the other hand, philosophers like D'Alembert described the discovery as 'a kind of groping' and were quite sure that, whatever it was that Dollond was making a living out of, it was not science. "Richard Sorrenson combines accounts in primary sources with relevant recent studies to tell the fascinating story of the discovery and the ensuing controversies in a way that maintains the reader's interest and never loses sight of the larger issues behind the controversies. In an essay that is at once clear, conceptually sharp, and written in an engaging style, he goes on to trace these differing receptions accorded John Dollond's lens to the differences in the kinds of people that were members of the Royal Society and the Continental aca- demies and to the consequent different opinions they held as to whether a piece of work unsupported by a mathematical theory could be scientific." The citation to Frances Kohler, signed by the three most recent editors of Isis- Arnold Thackray, Charles E. Rosenberg, and Ronald L. Numbers-traced her in- creasing involvement with Isis from her first contract, "temporary and conditional on both sides." "Ten years later the early caution of the editor of Isis is a cause for smiles. "Today Frances Kohler presides over a busy publications office that produces not only a greatly expanded Isis, but also the revived Osiris, the now-familiar HSS Newsletter, and brochures, guides, posters, and ephemera for all occasions. Each pub- lication reflects her artistic taste, her edito- rial flair, and her meticulous standards. The lights in the HSS Publications Office burn late into the evening as she juggles dead- lines, unites infinitives, catches dangling clauses, and produces coherent, measured prose from our not-always-fully-realized aspirations to scholarship. "As editors and scholars we wish to sa- lute the work of Frances Coulborn Kohler on behalf of the History of Science Society. We believe that every member of the Soci- ety who has had the privilege of knowing Frances as publisher, colleague, and friend will join with us in this salutation. We trust that she will treasure this mark of our es- teem, even though its prose has escaped the scrutiny of her eagle eye." ALBERT MOYER FOR THE COMMITTEE ON HONORS AND PRIZES 1989 SARTON MEDAL CITATION The Sarton Medal is the most prestigious award of the History of Science Society. It is given annually to an outstanding histo- rian of science, selected from the interna- tional scholarly community, and recognizes "those whose entire careers have been de- voted to the field and whose scholarship is exceptional." Our predecessors who for- mulated this criterion may not have antici- pated that we would be able to award the medal to someone who not only is a distin- guished historian of science but also has played a leading role in the movement to improve education in the United States; has received the highest award of the Na- tional Endowment for the Humanities, by being selected as its Jefferson Lecturer; has been selected by the American Institute of Physics to receive the Andrew Gemant Award for his contributions to the public understanding of physics; and, in addition to many other distinctions, has had an enormous impact on the History of Science Society itself. This year the Sarton Medal is awarded to Gerald Holton, Professor of the History of Science and Mallinckrodt Professor of Physics at Harvard University. Gerald Holton's research in the history of science has dealt primarily with twen- tieth-century physics and with the formula- tion and application of a general theory for the development of science. Perhaps the best known of his achievements is his</page><page sequence="6">NEWS OF THE PROFESSION-ISIS, 81 : 3: 308 (1990) 511 series of studies on Albert Einstein, col- lected together with other essays in his books Thematic Origins of Scientific Thought (1973; rev. ed. 1988) and The Ad- vancement of Science, and Its Burdens (1986). In particular, his major paper "Ein- stein, Michelson, and the 'Crucial' Experi- ment," first published in Isis (1969), over- turned a widely held view about the origins of relativity theory. According to that view, which was firmly entrenched in textbooks and popular works on science, Einstein de- veloped his theory in order to resolve the crisis created by the failure of A. A. Michelson and Edward W. Morley to de- tect the earth's motion through the ether. Holton was able to refute this interpreta- tion by a careful examination of all avail- able evidence; he concluded that it might have made no difference to Einstein's work if the Michelson-Morley experiment had never been made at all. The significance of that conclusion goes far beyond merely correcting the interpre- tation of one particular episode in the his- tory of science. The erroneous view of the role of the Michelson-Morley experiment had been used to support broader theses: that Einstein was guided by a Machian em- piricist or positivist philosophy, and that scientists in general construct or should construct theories to deal with particular experimental findings. Gerald Holton does not of course propose to replace those sim- plistic claims with equally simplistic oppo- site claims. Rather, he has developed an account of Einstein's work that exposes the complex relations between imagina- tion, mathematics, philosophical presup- positions, cultural influences, and empirical evidence. He has published similar studies in depth of the achievements of Niels Bohr, Robert A. Millikan, Enrico Fermi, and other scientists. In each case he has uncov- ered new evidence and suggested new in- sight, often stimulating further research by other historians. These studies have been widely cited by scholars all over the world. They have been collected in his book The Scientific Imagination (1978) as well as in the books mentioned earlier. Complementing his detailed studies, Hol- ton has also developed general models for the growth of science. In particular, he has proposed that theories are based on the- mata, such as atomism, conservation, and anthropomorphic projection, which cannot be directly verified or refuted but appear again and again in different combinations. Holton's thematic analysis shows how the scientific enterprise combines innovation with continuity; its value has been recog- nized by leading scholars in both sociology and philosophy. Gerald Holton's broad synthetic view of the history of science first began to have a major impact on the academic world in 1952, when he published his book Intro- duction to Concepts and Theories in Physi- cal Science. At that time scientists were beginning to recognize the urgent need to teach their subjects to nonscience majors in a way that featured the human dimension of science and its significance in Western civilization. Holton's book quickly demon- strated that the historical approach could meet that need; Introduction to Concepts and Theories was widely adopted by col- lege teachers in general education courses and was soon imitated by other textbook authors. A revised version is still in print, nearly forty years later. The book became the starting point for an even more ambitious effort to enhance science education. Remarkable as it may seem to us now, in the 1960s the federal government actually accepted the responsi- bility of providing financial support for na- tional curriculum projects. In particular, the National Science Foundation asked Gerald Holton and his colleagues at Har- vard to assemble a group of teachers and scientists to develop a new high school physics course. The history of science played a major role in the Project Physics text that they produced, along with labora- tory experiments and audiovisual mate- rials. Holton also revealed another of his talents, winning awards as a coproducer of two of the films made to accompany the Project Physics course. In the mid 1970s about 250,000 American students were using the Project Physics course each year. The course was trans- lated into several other languages and con- tinues to be used abroad. It would be diffi- cult to find any other book on the history of science that has reached and has been stud- ied carefully by such a large audience. In 1981 Gerald Holton was appointed to the National Commission on Excellence in Education. At the request of other members of the commission, he wrote the draft of what became the report A Nation at Risk, released in 1983. Unlike the thou- sands of other reports on education issued during the past several decades, this one was brief, well written, and compelling.</page><page sequence="7">512 NEWS OF THE PROFESSION-ISIS, 81: 3: 308 (1990) Unlike the other reports, it was actually read; more than six million copies were dis- tributed, and hundreds of thousands of peo- ple actually paid $4.50 for a copy! More important, it was the only report on educa- tion that has produced demonstrable im- provements, because state governments and local education officials actually fol- lowed some of its recommendations. Clearly we have seen, in the six years since A Nation at Risk was published, the power of well-chosen words to move mountains. Gerald Holton, by his achievements, not only has enriched the history of science, but has brought respect and influence to our discipline among scientists and educa- tors; his national and international reputa- tion outside of purely academic circles has cast luster on our profession. Finally, when I said "enriched the his- tory of science," I meant that in both of the senses recognized by the Sarton Medal: de- votion to the profession as well as excep- tional scholarship. As President of the His- tory of Science Society in 1983 and 1984, Gerald Holton worked hard to expand the scope of the Society, and he saw that much depended on raising endowment funds and obtaining donations for important new proj- ects. As the result of his efforts, and the mobilization of many more members than in the past, the Society is for the first time in its history protected against large annual fluctuations in revenues, so that the contin- ued publication of Isis is assured, we have an Executive Secretary to administer the Society, we have revived Osiris, we are sending historians of science to lecture at colleges throughout the United States, we have provided small subsidies to indepen- dent scholars, and we are publishing educa- tional materials. For these and other bene- fits, all members of the History of Science Society owe a debt of gratitude to Gerald Holton. It is my great privilege and pleasure to present the Sarton Medal to my friend and colleague Gerald Holton. STEPHEN G.
