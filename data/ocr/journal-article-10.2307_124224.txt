<plain_text><page sequence="1">The mainland tradition of sanctuaries in prehistoric Greece J. C. van Leuven Identification and interpretation of cult places in Greece prior to the Iron Age are at a rudimentary level except, as is generally held, in the case of Minoan Crete. The broad kinds of evidence are excavated remains, artistic representations especially of the Late Bronze Age, Linear B tablets in the floruit of that age, and comparable historic cult places. Outside Crete, research has been motivated chiefly by a growing discrepancy between the few convincing remains or historic continuities and the many ritual locations implied by art or mentioned on tablets. Until quite recently this gap could be narrowed by arguing that worship was relatively informal or tended to occur in forgotten places with negligible architecture. Such are the primary studies by Hagg (1968) and Rutkowski (I972: 67-72, 260-99, 3II-I6, 332-6) after the seminal commentary of Nilsson (I950: i Io-I6, 466-87). Even so, these authors differed in detail and regarded at most half a dozen buildings as religious - certainly the temple at Agia Irini in Keos explored since i960 - detecting no real counterpart to Minoan cave or peak cults. The last distinction persists today, but the construction of shrines was soon to need deeper scrutiny, for Hagg wrote before the unprecedented recognition of a fairly late cult complex at Mycenae in the Citadel House or 'House with the Idols' (Taylour 1970), and Rutkowski before that of an adjacent one in the Tsountas House (Mylonas 1972), including a shrine which he had rejected (1972: 298). While the argument from pur- ported silence still provides a meagre introduction to further syntheses (e.g. Vermeule I974: 3Iff.; Tomlinson 1976: I3ff.; Burkert 1977: 61-7; contrast Dietrich 1974: i36ff.), a Mycenaean sanctuary has now been discovered at Phylakopi in Melos (Renfrew 1975: 25; 1976: 26; 1978) and a smaller example at Tiryns, not to mention Mycenaean features at foreign temples as in Cyprus (Karageorghis 1976). The new finds are welcomed as proof that specific places of worship were erected in some settlements on the Greek mainland and culturally allied islands by the second half of the Late Bronze Age. This was not decided by the Keos temple, due to local and Minoan elements there until a mature Mycenaean phase. More importantly, the finds diverge in large degree from Minoan shrines, a curious fact in view of Minoan influence on mainland religious art, and despite the abiding inclination to see Mycenaean sacred edifices as scarce borrowings from Crete. Nor have we reason to expect that such elaborate sanctuaries as those at Phylakopi and Mycenae arose spontaneously or within their limited region alone. Should they turn out to resemble each other significantly, a unified explanation must be sought, and not necessarily mutual imitation.

Reconsideration of old discoveries would then be as essential as progress in the field, offering the possibility of retrieving a wide tradition of sanctuaries from doubt or denial. An attempt of this sort was made just before the revelations at Phylakopi, with an assessment of past methodology and a typology of religious architecture (van Leuven 1975). One of its points is that places of worship have frequently been dismissed on the grounds of fallible criteria, such as a rule that shrines ought to contain extant cult ware and, indeed, ware of obvious kinds like divine statuary. Thus while Hiigg (1968: 41) favoured the combination of individually weak criteria, he often employed them in isolation as did Nilsson; Rutkowski relied even more heavily on the above rule, although never independently defining cult ware, and believed architectural data to be virtually useless in identifying sanctuaries (1972: 303). The typology in question may be taken to</page><page sequence="3">The mainland tradition of sanctuaries in prehistoric Greece 14I begin with a striking instance of unheeded architecture: the tendency to a south-easterly orientation, normally of entrance and not only of principal axis, seen in the Keos temple and the proposed Mycenaean shrines at Eleusis, Pylos, and Delos 'Ac'. This pattern was first remarked by Hagg (I968: 43, 57) but he did not explain it, wrongly supported it by reversing the alignment of a building at Mouriatadha, and overlooked the cult room at Berbati as a parallel. Rutkowski might have added the Early Helladic 'House L' at Eutresis, if not also the temple in the 'House with the Idols' at Mycenae (1972: 282-9). Most Aegean archaeologists seem to assume that systematic orientation of such structures either did not exist or can be attributed to utilitarian factors, in particular the slope of terrain or the direction of winds (e.g. Mylonas 1966: 72). The assumption has yet to be justified by comparative study, and is partly biased by awareness of Classical design according to those factors, which in any case disagree with countless prehistoric buildings as was illustrated already by Valmin (1938: 27-8) and more theoretically by Scully (1962: chs. 2-3). The typology is now confirmed by the Phylakopi sanctuary, but this deductive view may be simplified through the following empirical approach, starting with exterior orientations and ending with interior furniture. As shown by preliminary reports of Phylakopi, an East Shrine is entered along its axis from some degrees north of west, via a door which had to open south for common access. Next to it lies a West Shrine, entered axially from the opposite direction and originally from the south as well, with one or two small rooms at the rear. A very similar arrangement occurs in the temple and Tsountas House shrine at Mycenae (Mylonas 1972: fig. 2), the main difference being a moderate separation and clockwise rotation of the buildings, so that the shrine opens north-west and the temple somewhat east of south. Among other correspondences are the storerooms at the back of the temple, the high circular altar outside its entrance (ibid., 26-7, 38) comparable to the 'omphalos' before the West Shrine at Phylakopi, the steps down from each eastern shrine, the adjacent street and the position near the south-west city wall. But Mycenae has further versions of the same scheme, pre-eminently in the great megaron and 'Throne Room' which were planned as a unit (Mylonas I966: 6i-6). The megaron, of a kind the religious purpose of which is increasingly admitted (Hooker I977: 88, 202), is oriented like the Phylakopi East Shrine; the 'Throne Room' and its forecourt are rotated more than the temple to open slightly west of south, yet also have an eastward entrance parallel to that of the Phylakopi West Shrine. An analogous unit, flanking the Lion Gate, consists of the 'Guard Room', a suggested shrine opening south-west, and the 'Stair-House' opening south-east with numerous figurines (Mylonas I966: i8, 21, 74; Wace 192z-3: 17ff.). In all of these Mycenae examples the eastern shrine opens towards the north side of the western shrine, and in the last two units a fully rectangular layout is used, as at Phylakopi. The type displayed on page 142 would be a double sanctuary, recalling those in Cyprus and the Near East (e.g. Karageorghis 1976: 57, 62). Its average components are a structure oriented between north-west and south-west, lying generally (i.e. hemispherically) east of a structure oriented between south and east, to be termed the major and minor members. Additional variants include placing the major member south-east of the minor member, instead of east or north-east as at Phylakopi and Mycenae. This applies to the 'Sanctuary of the Double Axe' and 'megaron' at Malthi, oriented west and south</page><page sequence="4">142 J.

Rarely, the members are interchanged, as at Gla where a 'megaron' opening west-south-west is placed north-west of a 'megaron' opening south (Mylonas 1966: fig. 76). Several proposed shrines do not clearly fit the foregoing framework, and may seem to be single sanctuaries oriented like its minor members. Yet in some cases a major member can be found for them which entails that type or a further variant of it. Thus at Berbati a structure with a ritual vase, oriented south-west, lay north-east of the shrine structure which faced south-east (Akerstrom 1968, Rooms 9-Io and 2), as at the Mycenae Lion Gate. Perhaps similar at Eleusis, while insufficiently excavated, was the building with a jar inscribed in Linear B (possibly referring to a divine title) under the Lesser Propylaea, north-north-east of the shrine cited above. The Mycenae Acropolis Shrine, oriented like the 'Throne Room', might have been paired with the 'guard-house' which was aligned like the great megaron, although placed to the north-west as at Gla (Mylonas 1966: 6i, 70-75, Rooms I6 and 3-4). If this shrine already existed in the earlier palace (Wace 1921-3: 223-8), the major member could then have been the original megaron, which supposedly lay to the east, as in the great megaron unit, but opened approximately southward like the shrine (Mylonas i966: 59-60, 70). The latter orientation, however, suggests a basically different scheme observable in other cases. The plainest instance is Pylos with a great megaron and small 'shrine' both opening south-east, paralleled at Tiryns by the great and lesser megara opening just east of south. These would define a second type of double sanctuary whose major member is oriented in the same direction as the minor member, usually between south and east. Correspondence to the structures of the first type in design - and in equipment, as we shall see - implies that the major member is here placed generally west of the minor member. The later shrine of Asine belongs to a complex best compared with the nearby palace of Tiryns, even in orientation, and may have a major member in the contiguous Rooms G29-30 (Frodin and Persson 1938: 74-5), matching our second type. Most of the remaining shrines, unless also found to have partners, would constitute a third type, as single sanctuaries oriented like the minor members above. They include the Keos temple and Eutresis 'House L' mentioned previously, the cult areas at Korakou in 'houses' opening south (Blegen i921: 86-9I), the room at Tragana (Hagg I968: 46) which probably opened downhill to the east, and the Early Neolithic building at Nea Nikomedeia facing just east of south (Rutkowski 1972: 28I). But the Early Helladic Sanctuary of Bulls at Lithares (e.g. Tzavella-Evjen I972) opened south-west, and may reflect a fourth type of single sanctuary oriented like the major members in the first type. Finally, a category of anomalous design might be indicated at Mycenae by the 'Room with the Fresco' opening north-north-west, although it once opened east-north-east (Taylour I970: 279) and conceivably arose as a minor member equivalent to the adjacent temple in our first type. That a given structure could change in type is illustrated anew by the West Shrine at Phylakopi, which ostensibly began in the third type and, when the East Shrine was added, became a minor member in the first type. This typology was initially presented along with a tentative sequence of development,</page><page sequence="6">144 J. C. van Leuven roughly from the third and fourth to the second to the first type. Unhappily most of these sanctuaries remain chronologically ambiguous, beyond the fact that the majority were of Late Helladic III date, and the earlier lacunae are still being gradually filled. It is nonetheless significant that foreign influence does not appear to have played any ultimate role in what must therefore be seen as an essentially local tradition of sacred architecture, even if the underlying religious ideas derived from a wider heritage. On the contrary, buildings thought to have intrusive features, especially from Crete, tend also to be the ones showing greatest abnormality in this tradition, as at the palace of Gla and the Room with the Fresco at Mycenae. On the other hand, sanctuaries exist abroad which could be at least cognate with those around mainland Greece. For example, the earliest pair of temples at Kition in Cyprus during LH IIIb (Karageorghis 1976: 54-6) is readily compared to our second type (as at Pylos) in alignment, and to our first (as at Delos) in relative location. The shrine at Agia Triada in Crete, facing west-north-west, had a Late Minoan I phase possibly of our fourth type, but in LM III lay south-east of a cult structure opening south-south-west (Nilsson i950: 96-9), coinciding with our first type as at Malthi and in the megaron unit of Mycenae. The LM I sanctuary at Rousses (Rutkowski 1972: 242) held two shrines opening east-south-east, resembling our second type as at Pylos, although individually planned more like the Mycenae temple and Tsountas House shrine. A Middle Minoan II sanctuary at Mallia (ibid., 235) consisted of a shrine opening west-north-west towards a 'storeroom' with cult ware oriented oppositely, recalling our first type as at Phylakopi. In Early Minoan II at Fournou Korifi, Room 89 and the shrine area just to the west (Warren 1971: 8i-8) evidently formed a double sanctuary, with uncertain entrances but viewable as at Agia Triada above. Whatever origin is argued for them, such parallels are meaningful because both Cyprus and Crete exhibit a larger range of customs in sanctuary design, including orientation, than does Greece proper. The consequences of this typology would be superficial if it concerned orientation alone. Fortunately it is supported by the material regularly associated with shrines, which divides them into the same two classes as before. Male representations (including animals), the use of fire, reserved places such as a low podium or an adyton, and fine construction or decoration, are most prominent with the major members of the first and second types and with the fourth type of sanctuary. Female representations, plain altars like fixed platforms, storerooms or other repositories, and nearby burials, are characteristic of minor members and of the third type. These traits are best illustrated by the sanctuaries containing a great megaron and by the elaborate complexes at Phylakopi, the Mycenae temple and Tsountas House, and Keos. That few buildings have all the expected traits is largely attributable to poor preservation, but also to some diversity of preferences. Harder to ignore is an unbalanced overlap: traits of the former class sporadically appear at shrines of the latter class, yet the converse is extremely rare. Thus at Phylakopi male anthropomorphic statuettes, seen near the East Shrine and arguably implied by the gold head found inside it, recur in the West Shrine although differently made; whereas female figurines, still more conspicuous in the West Shrine, had little if any established role in the East Shrine. Precisely the same is true at Pylos of the representations on frescos in the megaron as compared to figurines, sealings, and Linear B ritual tablets in the small shrine area.</page><page sequence="7">The mainland tradition of sanctuaries in prehistoric Greece I45 The above phenomena may become understandable if it is supposed that each class of shrine was dedicated to a distinct kind of divinity, and that the kind in the former class could receive homage in the latter class too. Those kinds presumably differed in sex, and the related quantities of individualistic representations suggest that the female element well outnumbered the male. An organized pantheon of this nature, with five principal goddesses and a somewhat independent god, has been inferred from contemporary Aegean evidence partly in such shrines, though by no means confined to mainland Greece (van Leuven 1975; in press); since the data employed were iconography and Linear B, the agreement with architecture is encouraging. Hence a god seems to have been worshipped in all the shrines of interest, but primarily in major members of double sanctuaries and in our fourth type, while only minor members and analogous single sanctuaries accommodated several goddesses. This system has parallels at foreign double sanctuaries, and is compatible in sex and orientation with the historic temples occasion- ally superimposed as at Mycenae, Tiryns, Eleusis, Delos, and Kition. Whether identical divinities existed in every sanctuary is, however, more easily affirmed for simplicity of interpretation than confirmed by direct testimony, even at a given site like Mycenae. The system does not preclude a possibility that, after beginning with a particular group of divinities, it became a conceptual model assimilating further deities. Moreover, the function of certain sanctuaries may have changed at times and admitted deities super- fluous to this system, as is intimated by the profusion of 'grotesque' idols in the Mycenae temple and of male figurines in the Phylakopi West Shrine. A question remains whether the typical orientations of shrines can also be explained by such divinities. The very pairing of shrines in a double sanctuary could show that they shared a specific cult, and indeed that the divinity involved was thought to alternate between them, most formally moving from the shrine which held his primary worship to visit the shrine which did not. We might then predict the one shrine to be oriented generally towards the other, and this is what the cited sanctuaries reveal. A major member ordinarily faced straight towards the minor member or at least towards its side of a north- south line between the two, with odd exceptions as at Gla and Kition. The converse occurred less often, indicating that a minor member was disposed to invite visitation from, but that its divinities did not manifestly travel to, the major member. The pre- ceding system implies as much, and thus accounts for relative orientation by movement of the god towards the goddesses, an event familiar in Aegean art. The structural ratio of length over width is normally larger in a major than in a minor member, as if to stress this directionality. In absolute terms the commonest fact, that movement from a major to a minor member was generally westward, may be due to a correspondence with the daily path of the sun. A solar attribute is attested by iconography for the god in the pantheon mentioned above, and is a sensible reason for the prominence of fire in major members, signally the monumental round hearth in a great megaron. These observations suffice to tell why the usual alignment was generally towards west and east for major and minor members respectively. The same logic would apply to similarly oriented single sanctuaries of the third and fourth types, because the absence of a second shrine need not have altered the character of the god. Another rule, that most of the shrines visited by the god - minor members and the third type - open generally southward, may likewise have connoted the annual return of the sun from southern CWA</page><page sequence="8">146 J. C. van Leuven latitudes. The custom of also orienting major members generally to south and east, in the second type, suggests a solar arrival of the god at his place of primary worship as well. Evidence for such an explicit epiphany exists in at least one major member, which is of the second type: frescos in the Pylos megaron depicting, for example, a bird and bull entering from south-east. The distinction between shrines of arrival and of visita- tion could be paralleled by temples of 'reception' and of 'passage', serving as entry ports and as residences of a divinity, at comparably oriented Near Eastern double sanctuaries (e.g. Parrot 1953: 234ff.). But whether the Aegean god actually resided in minor rather than in major members is debatable, and might have varied with the season or the site concerned. In addition, our second type emphasized the entering of minor members by placing them on the east side, if this too resulted from the closer connection with solar ingress. Finally it can be conjectured that the exact alignment of a shrine was sometimes fixed by the direction of setting or rising, of the sun or other heavenly bodies, on a festival day as has been maintained for certain later Greek temples. There are, indeed, continuities from all the stated types to sanctuaries in historic Greece, which must be left for future discussion, illuminated by the long life of shrines at Keos and Phylakopi. Regardless of the beliefs advanced to render it intelligible, the above tradition offers a fundamental way of solving the problems with which we began. Being defined by material features and not by their interpretation, it will follow from any thorough effort to analyse them, although the chances of viably explaining such a widespread and intentional pattern on non-religious grounds in Greece are inherently small. Its validity should be tested at further sites, and not prejudiced by the temptation to prove beforehand that buildings were 'purely secular'. Very few of those cited here, as at Mouriatadha and Gla and Korakou, have the slightest claim to be contrasted in purpose with the known sanctuaries, or even to be considered as private rather than public places. Particularly when an important structure is found almost empty, as are several of the putative shrines, a domestic role is least tenable, while the periodic evacuation of ritual ware is now amply documented outside the Phylakopi shrines. Otherwise the implication may only be that mundane artisans were influenced by sanctuary design or its ideological sources, for social or practical reasons to be determined. One might at worst adduce the experience that 'religious architecture simply took over and developed the cosmological symbolism already present in the structure of primitive habitations. In its turn, the human habita- tion had been chronologically preceded by the provisional holy place' (Eliade 1959: 58). Yet dwellings commensurate with the population have always been difficult to identify in many parts of the prehistoric mainland area, and the causes of their own elusiveness or impermanence could be equally pervasive. The conventional vision of lost or non- existent shrines is thus being more soundly inverted by recent discoveries, and much needs to be clarified about the cultural context in which early piety shaped so coherent a home.</page><page sequence="9">The mainland tradition of sanctuaries in prehistoric Greece 147 Acknowledgements I am indebted to Professor Colin Renfrew for supplying an advance copy of his prelimin- ary paper on Phylakopi, and for showing me the material from the site in 1976 and I977. 15.iii. 1978 Kardamyli Messenia Greece References Akerstr6m, A. 1968.

The mainland tradition of sanctuaries in prehistoric Greece Recently discovered Mycenaean shrines built towards the end of the Bronze Age have given fresh grounds for reducing the paradoxical obscurity of religious architecture on the Greek mainland and nearby isles in this and earlier periods. A variety of recognized and potential cult structures is shown here, by orientation and equipment, to define two types of double and two of single sanctuaries, which contained two basic classes of shrines with largely opposed features. These can be systematically explained by reference to divinities associated with shrines and attested in other Aegean material. The contextual approach used may provide alternatives to currently uninformative criteria for such evidence, and elucidate its relation to secular buildings.</page></plain_text>
