<plain_text><page sequence="1">Argo-Notes: Roland Barthes' Textual Trip Sylvbre Lotringer "If the desire to write is merely the constellation of several persistent figures, what is left to the writer is no more than an activity of variation and combination." Critical Essays (1963) "The writer is always on the blind spot of systems." Le Plaisir du Texte (1973) In the ever-widening chorus of French criticism, Roland Barthes's voice remains unmistakable. Obviously its modulation has shifted over the past twenty years, but a certain pulsation permeating his writing is always present. One might consider this his style: a definite imprint born under existentialism, checked and contained by structuralism, now culminating in a bold textual practice. No doubt, some deep fissures, some major mutations occurred on the way. One could attempt to apprehend them synchronically by forcing them into a single framework, as structuralism 562</page><page sequence="2">would have it. Any change would consequently be neutralized - reduced to a simple formal paradigm. The structural machine is bound to domesticate violent contradictions by transforming them into mere differences. Furthermore, what is repressed in the process is the instance of the subject, or more precisely the ego's position in writing. Structuralism cannot take into account the bio-graphic rift - when a subject breaks away from a stifling code. It is only through these sudden breaks that the rhythm of the writing subject can be perceived.1 The simultaneous publication of Barthes's early Critical Essays in the United States (Northwestern University Press, 1972. Translated by Richard Howard) and of his latest book, Le Plaisir du Texte (Paris: Seuil, 1973), makes this rhythm more evident. Taken together these two studies, as we shall see, epitomize everything that separates a structural approach from a textual practice. At first glance the most striking feature of the Critical Essays (=CE) is their versatility rather than their systematic bent. Barthes is trying his hand at the theater, the novel, art, philosophy, fait-divers and criticism, looking for a code; and it will take him some ten years, and his discovery of linguistics, to find it, i.e., to be caught in it. Certain contradictions are still, at this early stage, unresolved, namely that between politics and formalism as exemplified by the theater of Brecht and the novels of Robbe-Grillet. This contradiction is far from absolute: the critic recognizes at the first that "one of the great dangers of the political theater is its fear of falling into bourgeois formalism; this obsession blinds it until it falls into the opposite excess" (CE, 69). What is at stake here is the survival of politics when confronted with formalism ("Was it really his Marxism that was revolutionary in Brecht?" CE, 219). Literature on the other hand, as opposed to the theater, is by definition formal; and it is by emphasizing this characteristic, by eliminating the remnants of bourgeois psychology, that one can restore its fundamentally revolutionary impact. The counterpoint of these two perspectives - the writing of the scene, the scene of writing - brings about, at times, some very curious combinations. Roland Barthes is, as we know, the first to offer a systematic interpretation of the works of Robbe-Grillet. He uncovers in this writer a radical questioning of meaning, a challenge to our civilization of the soul, that is, to a theological conception of man. This conception he finds in the novels of Michel Butor, which he carefully distinguishes from those of Robbe-Grillet despite their hasty amalgamation under the aegis of the Nouveau Roman. Whereas Robbe-Grillet strives to evade the western model of crisis, upon which human consciousness is founded, Butor, as Barthes demonstrates, reaffirms the tragic order by offering the spectacle of a disclosure (a "modification") through which man can be reconciled with the universe. Consequently, the attention that both authors give to objects proves to be, contrary to appearances, absolutely irreconcilable. 563</page><page sequence="3">For Butor objects are meant to reveal the essence of man through his alienation from them. This isolation is redemptive since it "generates a consciousness." The process itself is creative: "A new man is constantly being born: time serves to some purpose" (CE, 103). It would be sufficient to refer to Barthes's later essay on Brecht's Mother in order to discover that what was categorically condemned in Butor's The Modification is praised here. The theater of Brecht is defined as a "theater of consciousness, or better still: a nascent consiousness." Even if one takes into account the specificity of each medium (theater, novel) the contradiction is here at its apex: "The birth of consciousness is an adult, i.e., a strictly human, subject; to show this birth is to participate in the effort of the great philosophies, in the very history of the mind" (CE, 144). Precisely. Barthes's entire effort up to this point consisted in disengaging himself from the human, in protecting himself from the snare of pathos, from the viscosity of substances, from the contagion of meaning. That is, in distorting a nature whose naturalness is only an anthropomorphic screen, an insidious myth by which bourgeois ideology perpetuates itself (See Mythologies. Paris: Seuil, 1957). If the natural order in Brecht encompasses a radical reversion - the son giving birth to the mother, the mother inheriting from the son - does this dispel, as Barthes then asserts, "the inevitable law of nature"? Of course modification in The Mother is not only subjective. Conscience leads to action and not to self-revelation. There is a world of difference between the person acted upon (The Modification) and the person acting. In the two cases what is involved, however, is a spiritual itinerary leading to lucidity (a tragic notion par excellence), and to the elaboration of this superlative form of the character which is the person. Can the natural fatality (a bourgeois myth) be exorcised merely by substituting one meaning for another, by inverting the relationship mother/son? It is doubtful. Everything takes place nevertheless, at this point, as if politics could whitewash any modification from the grip of metaphysics, from the pitfalls of meaning. In fact reversing the trend of nature maintains the central factor, namely, the belief (contradicted by the ensemble of the Essays) that the work must "transmit its profound significance," that everything must "concur in expressing its meaning" (CE, 56). What accounts for this about-face on the part of the critic? It is undoubtedly here that the historical dimension of these essays becomes explicit. If Barthes consents to distort Brecht and to spare Robbe-Grillet, it is because the political taboo is far stronger in our culture than any anti-formalist prejudice. One has to make allowances for the first while simultaneously confronting head-on the second. In short, Barthes saves Brecht from the accusation of dogmatism or propaganda by conferring on him the elements of the theater of conscience, which had contributed to his rejection. It will be up to Barthes to clear up elsewhere this deliberate ambiguity. What seems already suggested by this paradoxical maneuver2 is 564</page><page sequence="4">that there is no point of view independent of its object. Analysis is always a function of the opposition which it must confront. Insofar as he cannot attain objectivity, the critic must differentiate his modes of intervention: There is no prohibition in criticism, only requirements, and subsequently resistances. These resistances have a meaning, the critic cannot treat them in an indifferent and irresponsible fashion; he must on the one hand confront them (if he wants to "discover" the work), but on the other hand he must also understand that just where they are too powerful, they reveal a new problem and thus oblige him to change critical languages. (CE, 270) This parametric ideal, to which Barthes subscribes by modifying from work to work his own language3 will make him in time the porte-parole of the "nouvelle critique." (See the last three essays, as well as Critique et Verite Paris: Seuil, 1966.) The resistances that he envisages at this point are due to internal limitations of the object under scrutiny. If validity and not truth is the sanction of criticism, then all one can expect is that its language be coherent and that it saturate its object. The opposition to Brecht was on another level. It resulted from an external factor, i.e., the intolerance of ideology. Thus it was essential, at the risk of temporarily blunting the corrosive character of Brecht's plays, to catch ideology at its own game, to offer it a reassuring, speculative mirror. Identification thereafter could function in favor of distantiation and thus be restored to its proper proportions. Brecht joins Robbe-Grillet in a similar aim where these essays find their unity - that of the deception of meaning: "The role of the system here is not to transmit a positive message (this is not a theater of the signified) but to show that the world is an object to be deciphered (this is a theater of the signifier). Brecht thus elaborates the tautological status of all literature, which is a message of the signification of things and not of their meaning" (CE, 260). Literature must affirm meaning without, however, defining it. Suspending all answers, all meaning (sens) is the only means by which literature can preserve its status as a question or significance (signification). Significance differs from meaning in the same way that a question differs from an answer that destroys it. Significance is a trial of meaning, that is, it assures both its production and its subversion. However, the temptation is great, if not irresistible, to endow the literary work with a firm contour, to grant it a specific signified: criticism throughout its history has exhausted itself in this literally interminable task which consists of hiding under a name the process of meaning from which all naming derives. Certain works, those of Kafka for instance, fortunately wrench us from the lures of symbols, from the illusory 565</page><page sequence="5">certitude of meaning. These works remind us that literature does not have to express meaning but must put it off indefinitely through a technique of allusion which alone can define it. "Kafka's answer" (another essay) is his own question, his obstinate refusal of any assertion. To give the question up would amount to a denial of the essence of literature. As Barthes often mentions, literature like Orpheus cannot look back at what it loves without bringing about destruction. To give meaning to significance amounts to signifying its death.4 Literature must submit to wearing a mask, for it is not permitted any direct utterance. The writer, "an inductor of ambiguity," is dedicated to the practice of the indirect, to the many ways of mediation. He is allowed only one meaning: to point to its absence, in other words, to reveal his own mask for what it is. Without being able to tear it away. The critic differs from the author in respect to the mask. In an important article, "Authors and Writers," Barthes opposes authors (6crivains) to writers (6crivants). The author, caught up in language, remains a stranger to the world of intentionality. He constitutes a narcissistic writing machine which, while striving for reality, can only get as far as its connotation (it generates, so to speak, indirection). On the other hand, the writer, a user of language, considers only its instrumentality, its transivity: he writes something, he transmits thought. One is engaged in a signifying system whose meaning is never anything more than a differed-action infinitely renewable; the other succumbs to the western temptation based upon the double articulation of the sign, of tearing the signified away from the signifier, of postulating a possible transparency of language on which to found a meaning, that is, a transcendental signified (see Jacques Derrida, De la Grammatologie. Paris: Seuil, 1967). Is the critic then an author or a writer? Barthes considers a bastard form characteristic of our time; that of the ecrivain-ecrivant (the intellectual), who writes without writing, or rather, who writes (intransitively) while writing something (transitively). Who dreams of communicating pure thought, without any parasite message, without secondary language (it is this secondary language which constitutes literature in the first place), and nevertheless reaches on occasion the theater of language by imposing - in the silence of communication - the "noise" of writing. The critic is such a mixture of ecrivain/6crivant, since he is bound to mask his own mask instead of pointing to it as the author does. The language of the critic is a secondary language which pretends to be primary by calling upon the Other. His discourse is necessarily a secret writing in which writing must publicize its own transitivity. The critic writes something about someone - he must communicate noise itself. Writing, however, is "on every level the language of the other " (CE, xv) for it never really belongs to whomever is actually writin%. The author is alienated by language, or rather, in Saussurian terms, his utterance (parole) always remains dependent on a language 566</page><page sequence="6">(langue). The utterance of the critic is similar in that respect although, being a "deferred author," he must pretend to speak the indirect directly. Barthes is here closest to what will become, largely through his own doing, "structuralism." The references to Saussure, Jakobson, Le'vi-Strauss, and more implicitly to Hjelmslev (form/substance) appear more and more pressing throughout the Essays to the point of taking over towards the end of the collection. "The Imagination of the Sign" conveniently allows us to state the true position on a mutation which occurs under our very eyes. Mutation, let us point out, not so much in the approach itself as in its intellection. Everything in Barthes's work really stems from his quasi-visceral refusal of "symbolic consciousness," namely, the privilege given to content (to meaning). Saussure asserted that there is always a rudiment of similarity between the signifier and the signified: the symbol, a "vertical" relationship, an established analogy between the two faces of the sign, always leads however, to the dependency of the signifier on the signified, of form on content. The richness (mythical) of meaning functions therefore as an instrument of participation (the symbol has depth). Barthes has always denied this emotional contagion. In the beginning, the context is Sartrian: it is necessary to resist the nauseating coagulation of meaning which invests objects. The terminology, on the other hand, still vacillates: for instance, the critic challenges substance (the substantive, being),6 but only to oppose it to essence, the principle of things, which in Voltaire is expressed as the universality of man (see "The Last Happy Writer"). The reference to structural linguistics dispels these ambiguities. Bringing the phonological model (which deals with the form of expression, i.e., the sonorous differences) into the semantic field, Barthes is able to designate as the focus of his investigation the form of the content (the differences of meaning, i.e., the significance). This is the "semantic" or "paradigmatic" consciousness which strives to sever the signified in order to establish a logic of relations (the impact of Claude Levi-Strauss is here registered). The Critical Essays trace, for the most part, the accession of the critic to the paradigmatic consciousness, to the problematics of significance. The last category defined, the "syntagmatic consciousness" which deals with the concatenation and not with the substitution of elements, reappears later to establish the "Structural Analysis of Narrative" Communications 8. Paris: Seuil, 1966) from which a new "poetics" will be developed in France. The paradigmatic and the syntagmatic consciousness rarely come forth in pure form; moreover, their operaive value derives, as Roman Jakobson had suggested, from their capacity of overlapping. The structural analysis of narratives is already at work in two descriptive essays, "La Bruy' re" and the "Metaphor of the Eye," which (one could say "inevitably") define narration as an extended paradigm, a syntagmatic extension of metaphor: elements of character or substitutes for the eye, instead of excluding each other, are simply aligned side by side. The 567</page><page sequence="7">narrative, far from juxtaposing foreign elements, manifests itself as a system: its terms constitute a declension. Consequently, structuralist activity sets up units (by commutation, substitution of elements according to similar and dissimilar relationships) in order to form a simulacrum of the envisaged object. This "reduced model," as in Le'vi-Strauss, does not give access to meaning, but to the conditions of its elaboration; by decomposing and recomposing reality,7 it uncovers the rules and form of this reality. To formalize is to escape from the contingency of substances (the elements are constantly changing) in order to reach their intelligibility (the relationship which they obey): "It is what lasts that must be explained, not what 'changes' . .. the longer forms persist, the closer they approach that historical intelligibility which seems to me the object of all criticism today" (CE, 265). The critic is an Argonaut whose ship has permanence only on the level of form: he travels on a system. But is the critic really on board? As long as it is the critic's lot to produce the intelligible of our time, he disappears entirely in the gesture by which the system is made. The critic confines himself to restoring meaning, that is, to restoring the rules of combination on which the writer unwillingly, since he intended to express his subjectivity, has had to rely in order to achieve his goal. The author himself is thrown back upon substances; he becomes a part of what "changes." His utterance is retained only insofar as it gives way to language: "What the writer wants is precisely to transform his 'I' into a fragment of a code" (CE, xix). Consequently, the author, just like the critic, is secondary in relation to the system which is shaped by the author and which acquires through the critic its own intellection. Structural analysis can only obliterate the place of the subject in writing; the subject is its "blind spot." The system cannot be established without writing but writing is precisely what the system cannot account for in its own terms (the critic is reduced by this procedure to "a kind of zero degree of the person," CE, xx). Barthes's approach however is somewhat paradoxical in that it retains with one hand what the other hand discards. The subject in writing (Georges Bataille for example) is on the one hand totally absent in Barthes's analysis of L'Histoire de I'oeil. Here everything is explained in terms of the interference of two metaphorical chains (that of the eye and that of the egg: to break an eye, to poke out an egg). Revealing the system allows only a functional center to subsist at the heart of the structure: structural science knows only its own subject (the / as a fragment of the code which, when objectified, reappears in Le6vi-Strauss's work in the shape of the human mind). The subject of science, product and guarantee of the system, forbids any questioning of what science represses, namely the subject in writing. On the other hand, this subject is to be found everywhere in the Essays. Indirection can, after all, be understood only as a function of this subject which the structure crosses out. Moreover, it is enough for Barthes to adhere to the formal constraints themselves, thus 568</page><page sequence="8">constructing a simulacrum, for the problematics of writing to disappear. If, despite everything, the latter persists even in the preface which concludes this work, it is because it existed beforehand (see Writing Degree Zero. Paris: Seuil, 1953). Everything takes place as if the linguistic model were grafting itself to a distinct problematics that it was not able to eliminate totally. Or, as though Barthes, after using for his own purpose materials prearranged by existentialism, were now to tinker (bricoler) with Saussurian linguistics in order to pursue a track which would be completely foreign to it - writing as desire. The Essays are presented chronologically and not systematically. This chronology corresponds less to a precise historical contingency (the publication date) than to a properly scriptural requirement (the composition date tied to the temporality of the subject). The logic of the Critical Essays is structural only in appearance. What shapes it inwardly is of a more bio-graphic order. This logic does not combine coldly; it burns. In a literary work there is no primary signified other than a certain desire: to write is an expression of Eros (CE, xvi). This is why the writer writes. Not to give birth to a code (which is still something) by indirecting his message, but to affirm the absolute intransivity of his practice: "Literature is at bottom a tautological activity, like that of those cybernetic machines constructed for themselves (Ashby's homeostat)" (CE, 144). Writing is a machine of desire whose object is writing itself. But since the object of desire is always beyond reach, outside of the chain of language, the desire to write is bound to make writing an impossible task, an activity which is self-sufficient only insofar as it is perpetually in search of its own unattainable achievement. What remains accessible in the structure is a mere constellation of figures, a series of variations and combinations, in short, a form that may be systematized. Desire is what moves the vessel Argo, but it is also what Argo can never satisfy by its infinite combinations. Or rather, it is what its operations aim never to satisfy because that very deception is what constitutes desire. Literature conceived as a signifying system of deception is in reality that which, discarding all satiety, keeps desire alive. The desire to write. Revives it constantly with the variations of content. Desire is not a primary signified which has at its disposal (in order to express itself) only a "poor and platitudinous" language, the banal and powerful language of emotions, or passions. Desire is dependent on language, that is, on the order of the signifier. It thus remains a tributary of what Antonin Artaud calls the "will of meaning." The deception of meaning (the practice of the indirect) is the meaning of desire only to the extent that it is a desire for meaning. Literature, brought into play by desire, can also represent it, i.e., frame it: "Any semiotics that locks desire within a configuration of actants, however new that configuration is, is a semiotics of representation. Representation is nothing else: when nothing comes out, 569</page><page sequence="9">when nothing shatters the framework - of a painting, a book, or a screen."8 The ship Argo, a constellation of figures where desire circulates, encloses it in a scene, sets it into motion at the heart of a configuration of actants: Jason and the Golden Fleece. Writing extracts desire from the scene. But not from the constraints of language itself. Desire is a function of what Jacques Lacan calls the symbolic instance: the system of language, the predicative structure on which, according to A.-J. Greimas (Semantique structurale. Paris: Larousse, 1966), any narrative is patterned. A narrative can be considered as an immense sentence that absorbs any lexical variation within a stable structure. The sentence is logically and hierarchically organized by the subject-predicate matrix. This narrative cell determines the motive of the quest as a representation of desire. As a result, the kernel of the sentence needs to be broken, the very premises of linguistics altered, for desire to loosen the bonds of representation. Barthes always refused to give binarism - which guarantees the representative order - an exclusive privilege. In his Elements of Semiology (Paris: Seuil, 1964), he recognized that digitalism, although a very general phenomenon, is by no means universal or founded in nature (as Le'vi-Strauss still maintains). Barthes even went as far as suggesting that binarism may be no more than an exact but transient classification meant to be outlived by history. Recently this suggestion was taken up again and elaborated in his study of Bataille's "Le Gros Orteil" (The Big Toe)9 where the binary opposition is derailed by the intrusion of a third, ex-centric, "unsublatable" term. This perspective, radically heterological, owes nothing to the mechanical (structural) description of Bataille's "Histoire de I'Oeil." Tripolarity subverting the machine of meaning, exceeding it by means of the Nietzschean value, projects discourse into writing, desire into pleasure. A desire, which is by definition always unsatisfied and thus renewable, when shattering the envelope of the symbolic, of the predicative syntax, is no longer desire but pleasure. Pleasure is what eliminates desire, what initiates in the system a process of spending (ddpense or dd-pense: unsettling thought, dissipating all the "reserves" of meaning). Language is shattered by the irruption of instinct, by the energetic charges that disrupt the symbolic.10 Hence the eructations of Artaud, the dotted lines of Bataille. The text of pleasure is a text where the subject fades while its object is being destroyed (eroticized). Eroticism shatters the unity of the ego. It breaks its discontinuity (autonomy), its illusion of mastery. It violently dissolves the body of the victim, the texture of the text (See Bataille, L'Erotisme. Paris: Minuit, 1957). Textual pleasure is no more reducible to a rammatical function than corporal pleasure is to a physiological need.1l The text is the erotic destruction-production of meaning. One can speak (of) pleasure but not jouissance. Jouissance is the climax of pleasure: when the fabric (text) comes undone, when the subject 570</page><page sequence="10">swoons, when language fails. The jouissance of the text is what disappears when the text is enunciated, while the text of jouissance silences criticism, escapes criticism. It can only be reached by another text of jouissance, as fragmented and heterogeneous as its model. Actually, there is no more model, no primary language (literature to be inexpressed, indirected, by a second language criticism). In the Critical Essays Barthes had foreseen the exhaustion of structuralism. But he had imagined it as a smooth succession sublating all oppositions: "Structural man is scarcely concerned to last; he knows that structuralism, too, is a certain form of the world, which will change with the world . . . . He knows that it will suffice that a new language rise out of history, a new language which speaks him in his turn, for his task to be done" (CE, 219-220). It has taken ten years to fulfill Barthes's predictions. Beyond all expectation. Because the language of the text is not this new language which would quietly double the doubling of the structure. It is that which subverts the division of languages through the division of language. A science of writing does not recognize any metalanguage since one does not speak about a text, but in a text, or better yet: as a text. By bits and pieces, through a series of "little spelling orgasms," in an aphoristic way. Thus the Plaisir du texte comes close to being a text of jouissance. From the fragmentation of the Essays to this essay in fragmentation, all diction has come to terms with inter-diction. The indicible, though, has to be said: criticism is sentenced to pleasure. Columbia University NOTES 1 See Le Plaisir du Texte, p. 102: "There is a time when one feels the urgency to open up ever so slightly the grip of theory, to unsettle discourse, the repetitive idiolect that keeps thickening, and shake it with a question." 2 In Le Plaisir du Texte, Barthes is more explicit about such a maneuver: "It consists of depolicizing what is apparently political and policizing what apparently is not" (p. 71). 3 Substantial for Michelet (Paris: Seuil, 1954), psychoanalytical for Sur Racine (Paris: Seuil, 1963), etc. 4 That death, however, is what Maurice Blanchot is after in "Le Regard d'Orphee." Eurydice is, according to him, "the deeply obscure point which art, desire, death and night seem to aim at" (L'Espace Litt6raire. Paris: Gallimard, 1955, p. 180). Significance belongs to that night on which the light of meaning should not be thrown. The other night put forward by Blanchot is, on the contrary, a glance cast in darkness on what night itself hides. We are here far from the deception of meaning, from an answer in the guise of a question. What is at stake is another question, the other (heteros) of the question. Bataille, not Saussure. 571</page><page sequence="11">5 It would be inappropriate here to anticipate the impact of Lacan, that is the cleavage of the subject by its entry into the symbolic. 6 But Derrida's irreducible originality, in regard to the Essays, will consist in "deconstructing" the principle of all digitalization. It is one thing to oppose form to content, and another to demonstrate the solidarity of the substantial privilege with all its metaphysical oppositions. 7 Empiricism, however, gets the upper hand because reality here is given, and not constructed. 8 Le Plaisir du Texte, p. 90. 9 "Les Sorties du Texte," in Bataille, Paris: 10/18, U.G.E., 1973.
