<plain_text><page sequence="1">comes anger. Anger at his brother for leav ing him. Anger at life for being unfair in not allowing him to grow old like his grandfa ther. He remembers the good times they had together and even the fights, with fond ness. He tries to cope, to understand. He wants answers, but there are none. ''Every thing has to die," says his teacher, who is understanding about his mood swings and about how he can be unintentionally dis ruptive in class. He is not fobbed off with placebos that his brother has "gone to sleep" or that he is "up with the angels", and the like. Controversy is avoided by no mention of any religion. Rather, Ross gradually accepts death as a natural, if sometimes ill-timed, process. He learns to appreciate the finality of death, but the du rability of memory. The illustrations by Rosita Manahan are wonderful, and perfectly complement the mood of the book. Delicate watercolour studies, infused with light, are intimate but non-intrusive. I could not get my son to read this book. I think he instinctively knew what it might be about, and anyway, he had already made up with his younger brother. There are many like him who will find the subject too painful, but for its compassionate under standing of childhood bereavement, it should be available in every school, hospi tal and clinic, to be read by both child and parent. It's a Jungle Out There. Ed Miliano. Wolf hound Press. 32 pp ?8.99 hb 27 x 21 cm 0-86327-570-2. The October issue of Books Ireland featured the charmingly naive cover illustration, and with a few words and similar bold pictures, Miliano gives a cat's eye view of a trip around a domestic garden. Small things get the star treatment, and a wealth of humorous detail will delight children between one and one hundred! Drawing made very easy. Terry Myler. The Children's Press. 32 pp ?2.96 brochure20 x 29 cm (wide) 1-901737-00-4. In spite of certain schools of thought that maintain that young children should not be taught art in a formal sense, in favour of nurturing their own innate abilities, there comes a point when the child becomes frus trated with its limited ability to draw figu ratively and demands help. Sensibly Terry Myler stresses that careful observation must precede drawing, and uses the simple cylinder shape of a mug as an accessible example. Since looking is the key to doing, she gives only simple guidelines to help in observation and depiction of flowers, cats, dogs and people. The book's cover, with its cartoon chil dren, is misleading, for it is clear that Terry Myler has designed her book not specifi cally for the young, but for all artistic begin ners. According to the cover note, Drawing Made Very Easy was in response to protesta tions that her earlier book, Drawing Made Easy, was not easy enough. Which reminds me of the time when I started an adult beginner's art course and, having set out a standard 'still life' of boxes, ball and cylin der, came to terms with a lady who, after Worth a thousand words Teresa Doran InCKE A KC suuic Ul US WIIU I level CJUllC grow out of picture books. I see children trying to wean themselves off the bold de signs and bright colours so beloved by their younger siblings towards 'proper books'. Like adults trying to get off the fags, this literary adolescence is a painful process, and many a ten-year-old will be caught regressing with furtive enjoyment, while using the excuse that he is reading to his younger sister, the baby, the dog, or what ever. It is often not until parenthood that you fully appreciate that picture books are not just for the little ones. With huge relief you wallow in an Aladdin's cave of self-indul gence?long after sleep has overtaken your listener. Picture books are wonderful, for as the saying goes "a picture paints a thou sand words". A good illustration is not just a spacer for a few simplistic words. Rather is it anything your imagination wants it to be. Many are works of art in their own right. They work with colour and tone to convey the heart and emotion of the book. They enhance the text, and when the printed sto ryline is thoroughly absorbed, they provide a springboard to the imagination for many, many more. What Faust Saw. Matt Ottley. Wolfhound Press. 32 pp ?4.99 pb 21 x 28 cm (wide) 0-86327-603-2. One night, Faust, the family dog, looks out the window and sees something very strange. Quite properly he wakes his peo ple, but the humans, being a bit stupider than a dog, can see nothing out of the ordi nary Faust and his howling are a nuisance, and he is unceremoniously dumped out side, where there are enough weird and many-limbed aliens to give a whole kennel of dogs the heebie-jeebies. However, the worst that happens is that he is collared by the dog-catcher and brought to the pound for the night. Next morning, Faust resolves not only to forgive his family but next time he sees anything strange at night, to look the other way! This is a delightful soft-covered picture book, ideal for bed-time reading. The illus trations are a fabulous riot of form and tuiuui wim dii eiiurinuut) ainuum ur nu mour, and children will delight in poor Faust's fears being far worse than their own. The text, often no more than two or three words to a page, stretches and curls itself across the pictures, encouraging a child to have as much fun with the words as with the illustrations. You're Safe Now, Waterdog. Richard Ed wards; illus. Sophy Williams. Wolfliound Press (Britain: Orion). 31 pp ?4.50 pb 24 x 24 cm 0-86327-605-9. The illustrator, Sophy Williams, is a White Raven award winner, and her excellence is evident in this book. The intensity of colour and luminescence of her pastel drawing are superb, and the hazy warmth she creates perfectly reflects the gentle nature of the story. Watt, the cuddly dog, is loved to bits by his owner Matt, who accompanies him everywhere. But as Matt grows older, Watt is no longer such an important companion, he is discarded, forgotten and finally lost. After ending up floating down a river, he is rescued by a little girl, Hattie, who with love and affection, assures him of a new home. This book will be a delight to under fours, not least for Sophy Williams' skill in managing to give expression to an inani mate object without anthropomorphism. It Isn't Easy. Margaret Connolly, illus. Rosita Manahan. Oxford University Press. 18 pp Stg?8.99 hb 26 x 29 cm 0-19-279916-9. It isn't easy to read this book just after your elder son has grumbled about wishing he were an only child, and were rid of his annoying younger brother. It isn't easy to read this book when the tears are streaming down your face, as mine did before I was even half-way through. This book has that kind of poignancy. But then, as Margaret Connolly says, it isn't easy carrying on when a sibling has suddenly died.* Nine year old Ross is killed chasing a ball across a road, leaving his younger brother to cope with the pain of grief, guilt and loneliness. In the confusion of acute sorrow * The author, Margaret Connolly?and her children?reviewed children's books in these columns for some years.</page><page sequence="2">BOOKS IRELAND Marchl998 61 many false starts, decided to stick with just one box?until she got that right! I would heartily agree with Myler's premise not to overestimate the extent of her reader's prior knowledge. Get back to square one? how to hold the pencil?and take it from there. Freddie gets dressed and Freddie visits the doctor. Nicola Smee. Bedtime Rhymes. Carol Thompson. O'Brien Press (Britain: Orchard Books), each 20 pp ?3.99pb 21 x 21 cm 0-86278-535-9, -536-7, -534-0. A red apple on the front clearly categorises these books in the 1-4 age group. Soft cov ered, and printed on card rather than paper, they are designed to be handled by the very young. Simple but colourful illustrations complement a few words of very large type. Getting dressed and visiting the doctor are two routine activities young children will identify with, while the series of simple rhymes chosen by Carol Thompson will entertain at bedtime. Children enjoy repeti tion and 'action rhymes' to accompany the familiar routines of bathtime, hairbrushing and going to bed. Parents of course, will recognise these ditties from their own child hoods. Great Irish Legends for Children. Yvonne Carroll; illus. Robin Lawrie. Gill &amp; Macmillan. 64 pp ?7.99 hb 28 x 21 cm 0-7171-2467-3. Ever present on the child's bookshelf are two beautifully illustrated, hardbacked books. One contains bible stories, the other legends of old Ireland. Given by well meaning relations, these revered books re tain their pristine condition, while other, smaller and more accessible books are liter ally "read to bits". It seems to be a constant challenge to reproduce words from an oral tradition in print in new and appealing ways. Carroll's retelling is straightforward, but in the rather uninspired manner of some Ladybird versions of the Grimm's fairy stories, and includes 'The King with Donkey's Ears', 'The Brown Bull of Cooley' and 'The Giant from Scotland'. The illustra tions however are superb, covering the en tire page with colour, into which text boxes are inserted. I was intrigued by the strik ingly modern appearance of faces depicted, rather than the wild-eyed, hirsute look cul tivated by some other books of this type. This is indeed a book to be treasured but, alas, that may mean it remains in the book shelf in pristine condition. Fionn and the Scots Giant and The Gob?n Saor. Larry O'Loughlin; illus. John Leonard. Blackwater. each 51 pp ?3.99 pb 0-86121-877-9 and -867-1._ The King's Secret. Pierce Feirtear; illus. John Leonard. Blackwater. 51 pp ?3.99 pb 0- 86121-872-8. These are as different from the previous book as chalk is from cheese and, as I would have predicted, my own children (aged 12 and 9) pounced upon them, with their fa miliar pen and ink strip cartoon format, totally ignoring the lavish qualities of Yvonne Carroll's book. Interestingly, two of the stories feature in her compilation, but the telling could not be more different. With the help of jokey drawings and lots of asides and digressions, the story is injected not only with humour but with the sus pense that I found lacking in Carroll's inter pretation. For instance, we do not learn that the King's secret is his donkey's ears until the last page, whereas Carroll gives it to us in the title. As an introduction to some of the best loved of the Irish legends, I couldn't recommend these books too highly. Even the most reluctant reader could not fail to be tempted by this highly original and imagi native format. Brilliant fun! When Jessie Came Across the Sea. Amy Hest; illus. P. J. Lynch. Poolbeg (Britain: Walker). 39 pp ?10.99 hb 25 x 28 cm (wide) 1- 85371-787-8. I enthused about P. J. Lynch's artwork in The King of Ireland's Son, and I will enthuse again. The illustrations here are absolutely top rate. Lynch captures a mood with subtle use of soft colour; we have the homely browns and golds for Jessie at home with her grandmother, contrasting strongly with the drab blues and greens to convey the cold and loneliness of ocean travel. Emo tions are captured in every expression?I particularly liked the bank of stark but ex pectant faces, as Jessie and her fellow pas sengers look out from the ship's deck, towards America?culminating in a tender gesture of love as Jessie is reunited with her grandmother. Amy Hest's deceptively sim ple text conveys the touching story of Jes sie's journey across the sea and into adulthood with beautiful intimacy, making this a book to treasure from one generation to another.
