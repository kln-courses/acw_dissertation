<plain_text><page sequence="1">TRINITY AND TEMPORALITY, by John J O'Donnell S J. Oxford University Press, 1983. ppxi + 215. £15.00. Atheists have long lamented the lack of a credible theodicy. Some modern theolo- gians have tried to fill the gap by thinking of God as developing or changing. This is, somehow, supposed to make God more acceptable. According to writers like Jürgen Moltmann it is also a faithful res- ponse to the revelation of God in Jesus Christ. Fr O'Donnell's book is a study of this line of argument, though O'Donnell is particularly concerned with its significance for the theology of the Trinity, for it may be, he says, that 'a deeper penetration into the mystery of the triune God will enable us to rethink our philosophical categories' (p 32). The conclusion then is that The Christian God is not the absolute, impas- sible God of classical philosophical the- ism . . . The Christian God is the God who suffers in time, who enters our history in the event of Jesus Christ' (p 200). As an account of one strand in contem- porary theology, the book is a useful one. It will serve as a helpful introduction to writers like Charles Hartshorne, Schubert Ogden, and Moltmann. But the philosophi- cal issues touched on are treated very naively. The real problem lies in the treat- ment of impassibility. Thus, for example, the familiar point is made thai» an immu- table God cannot create a contingent world ; but nothing is said about the equally familiar reply that the world's contingency does not entail that God creates of neces- sity since the contingency of the world is a fact about it, not about God. Why cannot the eternal unchanging God create a world whose nature is such that it might not exist? O'Donnell does not deal with this question. Nor does he deal with familiar replies to arguments like the one which says that God must be changeable if he is loving. Here, it seems to me, O'Donnell has sold out to those anthropomorphic theologies for which the nature of love in human beings provides the rules governing what love must be in its divine form. Accor- ding to such theologies, with which O'Don- nell is sympathetic, God, qua immutable, is 'indifferent', 'unaffected', 'lifeless' and so on. But the dangers of anthropomor- phic theology have been noted time and again, and it has been vigorously denied that the more classical tradition to which it is a reaction has the undesirable entail- ments claimed for it or that it has undesir- able entailments. My point, then, is that O'Donnell has not provided a rigorous philosophy of God. And this leaves me questioning the true value of the authors it is most con- cerned to champion. One need not doubt that Revelation takes us far beyond what philosophy can discover; but it will not contradict what we know of God indepen- dently of Revelation. Trinity and Tempor- ality would have been a better book if it had dealt more thoroughly with this. BRIAN DAVIES OP 447</page></plain_text>
