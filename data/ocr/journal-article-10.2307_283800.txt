(Hippolytus 507-15) Before considering various interpretations of this passage' let us review its immediate context. At verses 433-81 Phaedra's nurse has embarked on a strenuous attempt to persuade her mistress to yield to her passion for Hippolytus rather than to save her honor by suicide. This speech, though it contains (447-50) one of Euripides' most strik- ing "symbolic" descriptions of Aphrodite, soon descends to anthropomorphic tales of her power over her fellow-gods, and then to that basest perversion of mythology (in Euripides' as in Plato's view), the use of divine example as an excuse for men's wrong-doing.2 "What else is this than hybris, to seek to better even gods in virtue? Have the courage of your love! A god has willed it!" (474-76). The speech ends with a promise, wheed- lingly vague in deference to Phaedra's scruples, of "some remedy (pharmakon) for this affliction" by "charms and magic words" (478-79). However, Phaedra's resistance (486 if.) stings the nurse to express her intentions more brutally: "No fine speeches need I I am indebted to Professors G. M. A. Grube and W. J. N. Rudd for helpful discussions of this passage and related points in my interpretation. 2 Cf. Norwood's subtle delineation of how the nurse's language "rises and falls in dignity with the phases of her theme."

The nurse has prepared for her suggestion by her mythological preamble. Now this statement and others equally specific (493-97) show clearly to Phaedra and to us that, rather than let her mistress die, she is planning to procure Hippolytus for her. The vehemence with which Phaedra rejects the nurse's "ruin- ous but too fair-seeming arguments" (486 if., cf. 498 if., 503 if.) shows that she scorns this abdication of human responsibility as do other noble characters in Euripides to whom mythological paradigms for frightful deeds are offered.3 Up to verse 506, the queen, albeit with a struggle, refuses each fresh urging from her devil's advocate. But after the nurse's speech at 507-15, she yields a grudging compliance, at least to the point where the nurse feels free to go indoors and speak with Hippolytus (516-24). What brings about the change? Is Phaedra simply worn out so that she can no longer resist what she so passionately desires? Or, as seems more probable, is the nurse, at least ostensibly, proposing something different in these lines which Phaedra feels she can accept with less loss of honor than the blunt offer to pro- cure Hippolytus, which she has already rejected? Of the literary commentators, Hartung is one of the few to recognize a definite change in the nurse's approach during this scene. After noting Phaedra's initial rejection of the nurse's arguments, he adds, "Neque tamen desistit nutrix sed aliquid remedii se inventuram esse promittens . . . in domum abiit."4 But on the whole the literary critics seem to have been content with indicating, in general terms, their views of the degree, if any, to which Phaedra shares the nurse's guilt in involving Hippoly- +.A. - 5-r 3 Cf. Heracles' rejection (coupled with his own refutation of such "poets' tales" of divine misdemeanor) of Theseus' consolations, HF 1341 if. and 1311-21, respectively.

Hartung, Euripides restitutus 1 (Hamburg 1843) 407. 5 Contrast, for example, the views of Meridier and Pohlenz: the former defends Phaedra on the ground that the nurse hides her true intent behind ambiguities; the latter argues that Phaedra's resistance simply weakens, since she must know from such lines as 490-91 what the nurse's real intentions are. See L. Meridier, Hippolyte d'Euripide (Paris n.d.) 111-13, and his edition of the play (Bud6 edition, Paris 1956) Notice, 18; M. Pohlenz, Die griechische Tragddie2 (Gottingen 1954) 267. Neither of these critics distinguishes a second approach on the nurse's part at 507 if. Norwood, in Essays (above, note 2) 83-84, defends Phaedra along Meridier's lines; in his Greek Tragedy (London 1920) 205 he suggests that the nurse "takes refuge in ambiguity"</page><page sequence="3">Vol. xcii] Euripides' Hippolytus 39 Several editors, following Valckenaer as well as certain scholastic comments on this passage, have recognized a change in the ostensible plan of the nurse at 507-8. However, since their interpretations have rested mainly on unacceptable renderings of 8Ev-EpLa . .. .xapts, 508 (such as "an zweiter Stelle steht dieser Dienst" and "I have thought of a second plan") 6 this view has, not surprisingly, been rejected by recent editors. Most editors who do not take 8Ev-E'pa ... Xapts as introduc- ing a second suggestion from the nurse understand deutera to mean "second best," i.e. after remaining virtuous, and charis to indicate a "yielding" either to the nurse's advice or (Wilamowitz) to the demands of love. 7 One or two examples of this interpretation will suffice to illustrate it: "'Twere best never to err, but, having erred, to take a counsellor is second" (Murray); "Nun, wie du willst. Du hattest allerdings / nicht lieben sollen. Aber nun: sei folgsam, / nun ist das Beste, willig sich ergeben" (Wilamo- witz). All but one of the editors following this interpretation take SE b' o'v as resumptive of a' IcqLapraVELv in the preceding clause. As Wilamowitz, in his note ad loc., explains the nurse's argument, the conclusion which must follow from Phaedra's principles (referred to in L Trot SOKELC UO) is that she should not fall into wrong-doing by falling in love, but once it is assumed that she has only after Phaedra has rejected her more blunt proposal. G. M. A. Grube, The Drama of Euripides (London 1941) 182, suggests inconsistency or at least vacillation on Phaedra's part: "Although she does not yield to these entreaties, she does half- consciously leave the matter in doubt." 6 See the editions of N. Wecklein (Leipzig 1885) and J. P. Mahaffy-J. B. Bury (London 1889) respectively. Wecklein paraphrases 507-8 thus: "Wenn du meinem ersten Vorschlag nicht folgen, und doch nicht auf deine Wuinsche verzichten willst, so habe ich einen zweiten Vorschlag." L. C. Valckenaer in his edition of the play (Lugduni Batavorum 1768) paraphrases 508: "Sic tamen stat sententia, aliud meum nunc sequere consilium; hoc enim erit secundi beneficii loco." The difficulty with all these explanations is surely that SEv-r'pc ... .Xaptg is far too abrupt an introduction to this alleged "second favor" or "second plan" of the nurse. As W. S. Hadley has pointed out in his edition (Cambridge 1902), some word like SE would be needed to make it even possible. H. Weil has attempted to meet the difficulty by an unjustified change in the text of the preceding sentence, so that the "second favor" is already indicated in it: XPT TE / Evo6 aclap-raveEv r' OVV 7tOOV /ot. 5EVrEpa KTA. 7 So, with minor variations, J. H. Monk (Cambridge 1813), A. Matthiae (Oxford 1831), J. Thompson and B. J. Hayes (London n.d.), in their editions, and U. von Wilamowitz (Berlin 1891) and G. Murray (London 1904) in their translations and notes.</page><page sequence="4">40 D.J. Conacher [1961 (EL S' oi'v), then "the confirming sentence 8Ev-7EpcL yap 719 expresses the pis aller which is no longer a matter of doubt since the best route is closed." In support of his interpretation of E1 3' oviv in this passage, Wilamowitz cites Sophocles, Antigone 720 if., as indeed have other editors before him, though not always in support of the same conclusion.8 But surely all that is required of the idiom is that it should introduce a clause in which, as Denniston puts it, ... . a speaker hypothetically grants a supposi- tion which he denies, doubts or reprobates."9 If, to suit another interpretation of this passage, we take E' 8' ov'v here as resump- tive of El -rot SOKEt uOt, this requirement is certainly met, for then the nurse would be understood as granting to a stubborn Phaedra a position which she has, in the circumstances, already derided at 490 if. and 500. However, the main difficulty in the interpretation just sum- marized lies in its general sense in the larger context of the passage. In the present speech the nurse insists, in contrast with her admissions at 493 if. and 500, that the remedy which she is now proposing-and which has only just come into her mind (510) -will cure Phaedra "on no shameful conditions" (511); 10 and after this speech Phaedra, who has hitherto resisted the nurse's persuasions, yields at least a grudging compliance. Hence it seems unlikely that the nurse is here simply repeating the argu- ment which she has already made in her preceding speeches. Another more recent interpretation of the sentence 8EVrE'pac . .. xoptsg also fails to meet the requirements of the context and intro- duces, with singular abruptness, a new idea of dubious relevance. This interpretation has been expressed in English by Hadley as " gratitude is a secondary consideration " and in French by Meridier as "la faveur est peu d'importance".11 But in this 8 Wecklein cites the Antigone passage in support of the same rendering of eL o' oiv as Wilamowitz advances. Dindorf, however, in his edition of the Hippolytus (Oxford 1839) cites the same passage to support the different view that here et o' oiYv means et be 8u0 SOKEL aot cqszap-rasvetv. So also Matthiae, whom Dindorf cites. 9 For the general " rule " quoted, see J. W. Denniston, The Greek Particles 2 (Oxford 1954) 465. However, Denniston includes the occurrence of et 8' oiYv at Hipp. 508 among a small group of examples in which "EL' 8' ovV virtually stands for 'e 8f E ." (ibid. 466). Thus Denniston would presumably construe the passage as Dindorf and Matthiae do (above, note 8). 10 Contrast the admission expressed in artaxp' (500) with the present claim OVr' er7r' axtaXpoEs (511). 11 See the editions of Hadley (above, note 6) and Mridier (above, note 4) ad loc.</page><page sequence="5">Vol. xcii] Euripides' Hippolytus 41 passionate argument about death or honor, no one, not even the nurse, has been considering the question of gratitude for friendly offices. We want, then, an interpretation of this speech which will suit the idea that the nurse is, at least ostensibly, changing her plan and which will harmonize with the syntax and language of verse 508-especially with charis, which is a favorite Euripidean term. Leaving aside, for a moment verses 513-15, which involve a further problem, I suggest the following translation: If that is what you think (i.e. if you really have such high principles), then it was not right for you to go astray (i.e. by falling in love); however, if that is really your view of the matter, then listen to what I now have to suggest;for the actual gratification ofyour love is asecondary consideration. I have in the house certain soothing love-charms- indeed they've only just now come into my mind-which, on no shameful terms and with no injury to your mind, will cure you of your disease, if only your courage weakens not (507-12). Of the use of charis as " gratification " or " delight " there are, of course, many examples.12 In an erotic context, it is true, charis often refers to the charm which evokes love, as in Euripides, Bacchae 236 and Helena 1397, though in such usages cause and effect are sometimes hard to distinguish. At Hippolytus 526-27 (in the chorus following the present episode), we find charis used of the delight which love brings, though here the delight comes to the psyche.13 Pindar also uses charis in an erotic connection: xospircAso r' 8ta'v 'p-rcov (fr. 128.1), but the limitation of the context renders the exact sense of XacPtroc. ("graces"? "joys"? "delights"?) somewhat uncertain.14 However, Plato 12 See LSJ, s.v., iv. 13 One is tempted also to cite Hec. 830-32. There Hecuba seeks to secure Aga- memnon's cooperation by pointing out that, if he refuses, neither Cassandra nor she will have any reward or thanks (Xa'ptv, 830) for her daughter's (forced) embraces. She goes on to say that from such erotic activities comes the greatest xospts for mortals (831-32); in these two uses of charis, the gratitude and the delight or satisfaction which causes it are close enough together for us almost to suspect Euripides of a pun. (For the play on the word charis throughout this tragedy, see my article, "Euripides' Hecuba", A7P (Jan. 1961) 17, note 26 and pages 22-23). However, Hec. 831-32 have been rejected by most critics since Matthiae's (unjust?) condemnation of them (1831). 14 Cf. also Theognis, El. 2.1303 and 1331, where charis in the sense of "favor" or " gratification" is also used in an erotic context. Wilamowitz (above, note 7) in his note on our passage in the Hippolytus compares Plutarch, Erot. 5, in which charis is said</page><page sequence="6">42 D.J. Conacher [1961 (Phaedrus 254A, 7) provides us with a clear illustration of charis used of the physical delights of love. This usage occurs in the passage in which " the ignoble steed in the soul heeds neither goad nor whip ... but forces the other steed and the charioteer to rush toward the beloved and to recall the delight of love" (. . .vELVEIv 7TOtEIXY6ath T?7S rWv abpo8tatLWV x cpt-ra). The significance and relevance of the statement at verse 508 appears, then, to be as follows. In the nurse's earlier suggestion which, bluntly stated, meant procuring Hippolytus for Phaedra as a desperate means of saving her life, EVV77 and 1oOV4 have appeared (495) as an inevitable part of the rescue operation. However, as the nurse herself makes clear in this line, it is not for the sake of this pleasure that she has made her proposal which, as she admits, involves "base things" (a'CaXp', 500). When Phaedra continues to resist, she thinks, or pretends to think, of another solution: she suddenly remembers a magic charm, involving nothing base (ov'i' c7r' ocdtaxpois, 511), which will simply rid Phaedra of her love. In introducing this new solution, the nurse is now able to refer back to her previous deprecation of EVi71 and 'SoV (which were, unfortunately, involved in her earlier plan) with the remark, "After all, your pleasure or gratifi- cation in this matter is quite secondary". ("So much the better", the implication is, "that I have now found a solution which does not involve them.") One final difficulty must at least be mentioned, since it has a bearing on the ambiguity which we have been discussing in connection with verse 508. In verses 513-15, the nurse says that it is necessary to get some token (alqHUEZOV), a fragment either of speech or of clothing, from the beloved and avvCabat -' EK 3VOZV ytccv X&amp;pLv (515). Many editors have deleted these lines. Of those who do translate them, some take avvabcat ... Xa'ptv as describing, together with CrqYJEZOV . . . AafEZv a part of the preparation necessary for making the magic work. (So Wilamo- witz: ". . . beide muissen der gleichen Neigung willig sich erge- ben "; and Thompson and Hayes: ". . . and from you both I must gain and knit fast your heart's consent.") Others, beginning with the scholiast on this line, appear to take the expression as referring either to the purpose or the effect of the magic spell, e.g. to have been used by the ancients " of the yielding of the female to the male." This is, perhaps, a more specific, technical sense of the term than is wanted here.</page><page sequence="7">Vol. xcii] Euripides' Hippolytus 43 We need or word or raiment's hem to twine Amid the charm, and one spell knit from twain. (Murray) ... pour fondre deux etres dans une meme jouissance. (Meridier) 15 (The syntax of the line seems to support the first of these two main interpretations, since aVVC4Jat depends on 8EZ in strictly parallel, not consecutive or final, construction with acEZV; however, this may be too pedantic a distinction to make in the context.) In any case, most meanings which have been given to this line seem, with the possible exception of Murray's, to suggest a more out- spoken intention on the nurse's part of securing Hippolytus' love, or at least his complicity, than we would expect Phaedra to accept. If the lines are retained, Murray's version (if his translation of charis by "spell" can be accepted) is the one least prejudicial to my interpretation of the speech as a whole. However, several editors have followed Kirchhoff and later Nauck in rejecting these lines (513-15). I am inclined to agree with this rejection on the grounds of their inconsistency both with the nurse's present approach and with what Phaedra says at verses 516 and 520. (At 516, Phaedra asks whether this drug consists of a "salve or a potion," and at 520 she abjures the nurse not to mention her troubles to Hippolytus.16) Hadley has further suggested that the lines in question (513-15) "may well be an interpolation from the first edition." It is indeed tempting to ascribe not only the present difficulty but indeed much of the ambiguity and possible inconsistency of this scene as a whole to this cause. It is almost certain that in the earlier, lost Hippolytus ('I7r7roAv-ros KccAv7m-o5EVoS), Phaedra did 15 Like the above translations is Matthiae's (above, note 7): ". . . oportet . . . aliquod signum . . . accipere, et conjungere ex duobus unum amorem," and A. S. Way's (Loeb edition, London 1912): ". . . so to knit two loves in one." Cf. also the scholiast on 514-15 who regards the words crvvcSoat ... .Xaptv as expressing the physio- logical result of the magic performed. 16 Wecklein and Hadley both reject 513-15 as destroying the ambiguity of the nurse's proposal, which they regard as an essential part of the scene; and Wecklein adds that Phaedra's question at 516 accords poorly with these lines. Thompson and Hayes also doubt the lines because of their inconsistency with 516. Meridier rejects the lines still more emphatically: ". . . il ne nous parait pas douteux que les vers 513-15 ne soient une interpolation, et que Phedre, abusee par la nourrice, ne voie dans le cpapu aKOv promis qu'un moyen de guerir sa passion, et non de l'assouvir. Autre- ment, l'attitude qu'elle observe ensuite serait inexplicable, et l'on ne comprendrait pas les vers 518 et 520" (Notice [above, note 5] 18).</page><page sequence="8">44 D.J. Conacher [1961 give in to her passion, and it is at least probable that she herself made a declaration to her step-son.'7 Thus one of the essential differences in the later version must surely lie in the comparatively innocent characterization of Phaedra, for most of the guilt for the involvement of Hippolytus now rests upon the nurse. However, we cannot tell from our fragmentary knowledge of the earlier play just what circumstances surrounded this involvement; hence we cannot say how, if at all, they gave rise to the difficulties in the scene now under discussion. Perhaps the most that can be said on this point is that, since this is a scene in which arose the most crucial differences between the two plays with regard to the treat- ment of Phaedra, of the nurse and of the manner in which Hippolytus was to be involved, it was a scene which would be particularly liable to ambiguity and uncertainty (including, perhaps, textual uncertainty) arising from confusion between the two editions or possibly even from incomplete revision on the part of the dramatist himself. 17 The evidence for this view, which is well known, is convincingly presented by Mridier, Notice (above, note 5) 13 if. However, agreement with Meridier on this point does not imply agreement with all details of his reconstruction of Euripides' first Hippolytus.</page></plain_text>
