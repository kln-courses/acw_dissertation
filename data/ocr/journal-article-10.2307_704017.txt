<plain_text><page sequence="1">NILSSON'S COLLECTED PAPERS MARTIN P. NILSSON: Opuscula Selecta, linguis anglica, francogallica, germanica conscripta. (Skrifter utgivna an Svenska Institutet i Athen, 80, II.) 2 vols. Pp. IO83. Lund: Gleerup, 1951-2. Paper, Kr. 45. AT the request of friends and colleagues in Sweden, Nilsson has collected his scripta minora and published them in two volumes. To review, in the ordinary sense, such a collection of known material seems neither possible nor necessary, but some facts about it may be useful to readers of C.R. The following are excluded: works originally published later than I939, reviews, contributions to encyclopaedias, publications in Swedish, and works adjudged by their author to be minoris momenti. Even so, the volumes make an imposing total of nearly I Ioo pages. They are divided into two sections. The first consists of thirty-one articles on Greek religion (though the long and interesting 'Studien zur Vorgeschichte des Weihnachtsfestes' in this section deals rather with Roman and Germanic customs), and the second of eighteen more general essays in history and archaeology. The majority are in German, some in English, and two in French. Most of the articles in the first section are well known to students of Greek religion, who will be as glad as Nilsson's own colleagues to see them in this more permanent and accessible form. Here for example, among others whose significance will be as immediately apparent -ro&amp;rv EE80aLV, are 'Das Ei im Totenkult der Alten', 'Die Anthesterien und die Aiora', 'Der Flammentod des Herakles', 'G6tter und Psychologie bei Homer', 'Der mykenische Ursprung der griechischen Mythologie', 'Die eleusinischen Gottheiten', 'Early Orphism and Kindred Religious Movements', 'Mycenaean and Homeric Religion'. The second section, ranging from Homer to Roman town-planning, reveals the extraordinary breadth and boundless vitality of Nilsson's scholarship. Both alike emphasize one of its especial merits, namely that while delving more deeply than most into masses of detail, he can throw off illuminating general remarks which show a grasp of wider issues and set a reader's mind working afresh on the big questions in the history of ancient ideas. Here is a random example from 'G6tter und Psychologie bei Homer' (p. 363 of the present collection). He has been making the point that Greek anthropomorphism served as a bulwark against the domination of magic. 'Daraus ist die griechische Wissenschaft geboren. Der ionische Rhapsode hat dem ionischen Naturphilo- sophen die Bahn frei gemacht. Dieser hat gebaut, wo jener niedergerissen hat.' Greek rationalism stands in sharp opposition to anthropomorphism and was its outspoken critic. Yet there is a sense in which the particular anthropo- morphic attitude of the Greeks paved the way for their rationalism and made it possible. Some may doubt the wisdom of republishing without alteration the article on 'The Race Problem of the Roman Empire', in which Nilsson argues that</page><page sequence="2">30 THE CLASSICAL REVIEW racial mixture (for which he consistently uses the somewhat rhetorical term 'bastardization') was a major cause of the Empire's downfall. This must have read better in 1921, when it was first printed. Nowadays, as he says himself in the next paper, 'das Wort Rasse ist so missbraucht worden, dass man bei seiner Aussprache einen bitteren Geschmack versptirt'. Peterhouse, Cambridge W. K. C.
