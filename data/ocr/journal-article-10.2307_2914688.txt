<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEW'S 235 Der deutsche Vollcsmund im Lichte der Sage, von HEINRIuC-1 LESSMANN. Berlin u. Leipzig, Haude und Spener, 1922. xxiv + 423 pp. This work, published six years after the death of the author who fell a victim to the European War, proposes to trace back to myth and legend the origin of such expressions and current say- ings as were not coined by definite and known authors. It is therefore a supplement to Biichmann's Gefliigelte Worte. While turning his attention primarily to the German language and its dialects, the author does not treat his subject without frequent side-glances at the Classical, Oriental and Romance languages. Though several works were on the market professing to deal with the same topic, Lessmann found the field practically uncultivated, owing, no doubt, to the many difficulties which beset the path of the investigator who, unlike Lessmann, does not have both lin- guistic and mythological data at his disposal. The author has acquitted himself remarkably well of the task he set himself, though in view of the vastness of the subject and its encyclopaedic character it is evident that not all of his expla- nations are generally acceptable. But his discussions, always of rare lucidity, open up new vistas and stimulate thought. The text is followed by two indices of the authors quoted and the ex- pressions explained. If in the following pages I make observations on various points and offer suggestions differing from those of the author, it is not with a view of detracting from the merit of this valuable and scholarly work, but rather to direct the attention of folklorists and mythologists to it. P. 2. Lessmanni denies the existence of any essential difference between myth (G5ttersage), heroic legend (Heldensage), and fairy-tale (Valksmdrchen), inasmuch as all three contain mythical or legendary material. It is, however, not at all certain that the heroic legend necessarily contains such in all cases, and where it does, it is very probable, after the researches of F. Panzer, that early epic poets used fairy-tale motifs on a large scale to construct their plots. P. 3. Lessmann accepts the theory of the Grimms who con- sidered the Marchen as a humanized myth (vermenschlichte GUt- tersage). Recent researches, especially in the field of Greek myth-</page><page sequence="2">236 MODERN LANGUAGE NOTES ology, have shown that the "Olympian" mythology is of a com- paratively late date and presupposes a fairly developed civilization, that on the other hand the daemones (Elementargeister) are con- siderably older, a fact which was anticipated, some seventy years ago, by no less a scholar than Luidwrig Uhland.' Now it is quite certain that the protagonists of fairy-tales bear, in many instances, a striking similarity with these daemones, while we should look in vain for an "Olympian" in any folktale. Hence the natural conclusion that the fairy-tales are older than the anthropomorphic gods of Olympus and Walhall. P. 22. Lessmann derives the expression einen Korb belcommen (to be rejected as a suitor) from a story told by Musius. The question may be asked whether the story was not made up to explain the saying, or, what is still more likely, whether both story and saying do not go back to a common source, some ancient custom, for it is of common occurrence that a custom no longer understood is explained by a story (-etiological myth). Such a conclusion would be corroborated by the following facts. The legend of Libuse is of Bohemian origin and hence would explain only the occurrence of the saying in the Bohemian language. We, should then have to suppose the saying to have passed to the Bohemian Germans and from there to the other parts of Germany. This is rather unlikely, and if the expression migrated it probably went in the opposite direction, like so many others. But it is more probable still that it is derived from an ancient usage prac- tised by both Bohemians and Germans and that the story of Musaus is merely a Bohemian aetiological myth. P. 29. Lessmann proves quite conclusively that the Christian god-parents are but the human representatives of the fates who are suLpposed to appear at the cradle of the new-born child. This discovery is in line with the results of recent anthropological re- search, according to which the priest-king is the human representa- tive of the chief god. P. 42. Mention is made of the gossamer (Altiveibersommer). believed to be spun by the Nornes. Lessmann might have added the popular German name of the toad-flax (Linaria vutgaris) com- 1 Sohriften zur Geschichte der Dichtung und Sage, Stuttgart, 1865-73, vir, 382.</page><page sequence="3">REVIEWS 237 monly called Frauenflachs, evidently because it is supposed to be used by feminine spirits of the corn and the wild. P. 51. It is very doubtful whether the proverb "Mit den W6lf en muss man heulen " can possibly contain an allusion to the Sigurd saga. It is far more likely that wolf had here the old meaning of "outlaw," "bandit." P. 59. It is more than doubtful whether the wide-spread story underlying Schiller's poem Der Gang nach derm Eisenhammer is at all connected with the Marchen of the Princess with the Golden Hair. Its basis appears rather to be the universal truth expresse(l by the proverb " Wer andern eine Grube griibt, fallt selbst hinein," and the theme of the second messenger who overtakes the first carrying a fatal message, a motif found in Josephus' Bellum Judaicum (iI. 10. 5), but unconnected with the Fridolin story. P. 59. Ich lege meine Hand dafir ins Feuer has hardly any connection with the legend of Mucius Scaevola. The expression rather points to a prehistoric ordeal. P. 61. The belief that the other world is separated from this one by a body of water is, of course, not particularly "Aryan," being found among widely scattered races.2 Hence the universal occurrence of the bridge of the dead, the ferry of Charon and the custom of ship-burial. P. 69. Legend of the "Iron Trunk" at Vienna. Again this seems to be an aetiological myth to explain the custom of driving nails into a trunk, a Teutonic parallel to the Roman practice mentioned on p. 77, probably for the purpose of nailing down all evil threatening the commonwealth. P. 79. Derivation of the custom of burying the hatchet from a passage of the PrymscviMa. Rather the passage in question owes its existence to the rite. P. 80. The name of Thors Hdmmer given by German soldiers to a type of hand grenade used in the last war is certainly due to learned influences and should have been kept out. P. 82. Der Krug geht so lange zumn Brunnen, bis er bricht. Cf. French Tant va la cruohe a l'eau qu'a la fin elle se casse. I.essmann rightly observes: "Dass muss mythischen Ursprunges BE.

So bilderkraftig ist die Sprache an u-nd fur sich ohDe den Hintergrund der Sage, nicht." The pitcher is in all probability a maric vessel, a fairy gift, which walks to the well by itself like the pestle in Lucian's XoA'EV)S' and the broom in Goethe's Zauber- lehrling, and upon which perhaps the prosperity of the owner depended as on the heirloom in Uhland's Das Gliick von Edenhall. P. 87. Derivation of the wvord dragoon from dragon and its connection with the insignia of certain b,odies of troops worn l:o inspire the enemy with fear. Lessmann could have mentioned the war masks of savages of which the modern examples are but a CC sulrvival." P. 92. Schatz (sweetheart) probably goes back to the Mdrchen of the Princess with the Golden Hair, as in this type the hero is called upon to acquire for his master first some priceless treasures and at last the princess. P. 97. Add to the ancient parallels to the "Swan of Avon" Socrates' dream in Pausanias, Descr. Gr. i. 30. 30. P. 105. Er saugte sich die Weisheit aits den Fingern. Of the same origin French llon petit doiqt me l'a dit. P. 112. Golden horseshoes. Cf. GC. Paris, Romania, IX, 515; H. Gering, Islendzkc Aeventyri, Halle, 1883, ii, 50; Kristensen, Danske folke-aeventyr, Viborg, 1888, No. 2, p. 14. P. 115. Goose guides the Christian army in the First Crusade. Cf. the episode of the bird singing "Franceis que dis-tu" and guiiding Charlemagne, as told in the Iter Hierosolymitanutm. P. 119. Sich mit fremden Federn schmiicleen groes certainly back to the wvell-knoxvn fable. For only a bird can be said to ador:i itself with the plumage of others, not man, having none of his own. Lessmann seems to underestimate the influerice of the Latin fable as propounded by the mediaeval preachers. Cf. also p. 164 Die Trauben sind sauer. P. 132. Sich den Kopf zerbrechen has hardly the origin sug- gested. Cf. French se rompre le nez, Italian stillarsi il cervello. P. 162. Ulkc from Ulenspe gel (Etilenspiegel) ; cf. French espiegle. P. 185.

It is doubtful whether the androgynous Christs in Southern Germany go baclc to the legend here mentioned. Both the images and the legend evidently developed out of androgynous Roman and Hellenic deities. It is to be noted that the images are practically limited to the parts of Germany once more or less under Roman control. P. 194. Derivation of the custom of neglecting one's outer appearance utntil one has killed an enemy, from the story of Balder's death. Rather the Eddic myth is a reflection of the custom, found, besides, among many races.3 P. 196. Ein lockerer (loser) Vogel, hardly due to the myth of Loki and Geirrod, but to a good observation of nature. Certain birds had the same reputtation of sexual lice:nce among the Greeks. Cf. also the old folksong Die Vogethochzeit. P. 201. Nach dem lraht kein Hahn mehr. The rooster is hardly more than the domestic bird, symbol of house and home. Cf. the stanza of the Bavarian song Kommt a Vogerl geflogen: "UJnd es fragt halt ka Katzerl, ka Hunderl, nach mir." P. 210. Lessmann asks: " Sollte nicht iiberhaupt die russisch- byzantinische Sitte, die Gotteshbiuser mit goldenen Kuppeln zu vTersehen, auf den Zug der Sage zuriick gehen, dass die H-alle der G6tter mit Golde gedeckt ist?" WVhile this is an open question, there can be no doubt that the impression which the Byzantine churches left upon the returning Scandinavians of the imperial guard was responsible for the identification of Asgard with Byzantium. P. 215. Luftschlisser bauen; Italian castelli in aria. The Frenich chateaux en Espagne may point to the introduction of Oriental fairy-tale motifs from Spain. P. 237. Gliiclespilz has its origin probably in the rapid growth of mushrooms, especially since the German term is generally I Sir J. G.

But were there no other strange saints, the hero of Decameron i, 1, for example? P. 262. Er kommt auf die grine Wiese, wo die Musil,anten sitzen;. Lessmann strangely omits to mention the conclusion of Grimm, Mlirchen 35, which reads: " Petrus musste den Schneider wieder hinaus vor den Himmel bringen, und weil er zerrissene Schuhe hatte und die Fiisse voll Blasen, nahm er einen Stock in die Hand und zog nach Warteinnweil, wo die frommen Soldaten sitzen und sich lustig machen." P. 266. Wenn man den Teufel and die Wand malt etc. Cf. Goethe, Faust i, Vor dem Tor: Berufe nicht die wohlbekannte Schar, Die strt5mend sich im Dunstkreis uiberbreitet, Demn Menschen tausendfailtige Gefahr, Von allen Enden her, bereitet. P. 276. Old Ind. naktamdivam; Old Pers. Chsapa-wa roca- pati-wat; cf. French nuit et jour. P. 283. Origin of the Saturnalia; cf. also p. 317. Compare Sir J. G. Frazer, The Scapegoat, Londo-i, 1913, pp. 306 fI. P. 316. Valid reasons to identify Harlekin with the wild hunts- man and the devil (cf. also F. Liebrecht, Des Gervasius von Tilbury Otia Imperalia, Hannover, 1856, pp. 173 fT.). Should this be the origin of the devil Alichino in Dante, Inf., Xxi, 118? P. 357. Reden ist Silber, Schweigen ist Gold. The first part undoubtedly comes from the Bible (cf. our silver-tongued orators). The second part was added later in much the same way as in the saying "Mein Kind, wenn dich die bosen Buben locken, so folge ihnen nicht, sondern geh voran." P. 377. Hrungnis Herz; cf. the Suebian tale underlying W. Hauff's Das kalte Herz. Space permits me to mention these points only. Whatever one may think of some of the author's conclusions, he is certainly in the right when saying, p. 379, " So viel inmlich merkte ich schon bei den ersten Versuchen der Stellungnahme zu den Leistungen Anderer auf diesem Gebiete, dass durch meine Ausfiuhrungen ein</page><page sequence="7">REVIEWS 241 Quell fur die ErklTrung volkstumlicher Ausdriicke und Wendungen ersehlossen wird, aus dem bisher nur sehr wenig gesch6pft worden ist." Similar works covering other languages are highly desirable. There exist a number of Renaissance compilations purporting to explain the origin of current proverbs and sayings, notably the works of the Cieco da Ferrara and Aloise Cinzio dei Fabrizii. It would be of greatest interest to examine the novelle of these col- lections to ascertain whether or no they give reliable explanations of those proverbial expressions or merely " etiological myths."
