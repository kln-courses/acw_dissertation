<plain_text><page sequence="1">Sea Peoples and Phoenicians along the Southern Phoenician Coast?A Reconciliation: An Interpretation of Sikila (SKL) Material Culture Ayelet Gilboa Zinman Institute of Archaeology University of Haifa Mount Carmel, Haifa 31905, Israel gilboaaa@zahav.net.il This paper attempts to interpret group identities along the Canaanite coast in the Early Iron Age, beginning with an analysis of functional and symbolic properties of ceramics. The starting point is the material culture of Dor, the SKL town according to Egyptian testimony. It is argued that there are significant differences between spe cific aspects of the material culture of Philistia and that on the coast to its north, but that these do not stem from some ethnic distinction between Philistines, SKL, SHRDN, and Phoenicians, but from different socioeconomic matrices at the various locales in which new populations were absorbed. These different circumstances also provide the background for the Early Iron Age mercantile activity that is usually termed "Phoenician," and for concomitant group identity. Cypriots on the Levantine littoral had a crucial role in these processes. INTRODUCTION uSea People" Territories and Material Culture in the Early Iron Age Among the phenomena marking the Late Bronze/Iron Age transition in the Levant, the settlement of the so-called Sea People on its (mainly southern) littoral has always attracted special scholarly attention. Conventionally it is held that of the various "Sea Peoples" mentioned by the Egyp tians, three settled on the Canaanite coast, and thus Sea People domains in the Levant are divided into three: Philistines in the south, Sikila/Tjekker (hence forward SKL) roughly along the Sharon Plain and Carmel coast, and Shardana (SHRDN) mainly in the cAkko Plain (e.g., A. Mazar 1990: 305-6; Dothan and Dothan 1992: 213-14; Stager 1995: fig. 2). This re construction is based on the Wenamun report1 which mentions Dor, on the Carmel coast, as an SKL town, and on the Onomasticon of Amenemope, listing lrThe historical setting of Wenamun's voyage is the very be ginning of Manetho's 21st Dynasty (low chronology: ca. 1070 SHRDN, SKL, and Philistines consecutively, alleg edly in a geographical order from north to south.2 b.c.e., Kitchen 2000: 50). Palaeographically, the papyrus is attrib uted by most scholars to the late 21st Dynasty or early 22nd (B aines 1999: esp. n. 6). References to discussions of the date, genre, and historicity of this papyrus may be found in Sass 2002. 2The Onomasticon is usually attributed to the end of the Ramesside era (for this date, not earlier than Ramesses IX, see Gardiner 1947: Vol. 1: 25). It is notable, however, that on the one hand Gardiner recognized in its different manuscripts "features as sociating them with the Twenty-First or Twenty-Second Dynasty" (Gardiner 1947: Vol. 1: 24; emphasis mine), while on the other, one of his main reasons for the terminus post quern cited above was his conviction that the references to the Tjekker (SKL) and the Phi listines cannot antedate Ramesses III; see, similarly, B aines 1999 and references there. The allegedly north-south arrangement of "Sea People" in the text is in fact far from clear: after no. 571 (the wine of Amor/Amurru) and no. 261 (a lost entry), there follow no. 262?Ashkelon; no. 263?Ashdod; no. 264?Gaza; no. 265?&gt;Isr (Assyria? Asher?); no. 266?Sbry; no. 267?another lost entry; and then SHRDN (no. 268), SKL (no. 269), and Philistines (no. 270). Though the sequence of the last three entities may indeed in dicate some geographical association, no strict geographical order is reflected here. Especially, the Philistine cities are listed before the SHRDN and SKL, and Philistia as a unit is after them; also, the three Philistine towns are not listed in geographical sequence. 47</page><page sequence="2">48 AYELET GILBOA BASOR 337 Cyprus Alaas/Salamis&lt; Kitioni Hala Sultan Tekke.U ?S?S?h0S KourtOBj &gt;Ugarit ?

Consequently, the southern Levantine littoral in the Early Iron Age (fig. 1) is commonly divided into two discrete entities: the "Sea People territories," stretching northward from the northern Negev; and north of these, "Phoenicia." The borderline between the two is usually drawn north of the cAkko Bay (e.g., Moscati 1988: 26; A. Mazar 1994: 41; Aubet 1993: 258 and fig. 3) or otherwise somewhere south of it,</page><page sequence="3">2005 AN INTERPRETATION OF SlKILA (SKL) MATERIAL CULTURE 49 along the Carmel range (e.g., Stieglitz 1990: 9; Salles 1995: maps of Phoenicia on pp. 554, 555).3 To date, only the material culture associated with the southerly "Sea People," the Philistines, is well known through extensive excavations, though its interpretations vary. The prevailing consensus, even among scholars who were quite skeptical at first, is that the settlement of a foreign population may be traced here (e.g., Bunimowitz and Yasur-Landau 1996). Indeed, this is the best explanation for a va riety of material culture traits in Early Iron Age Philistia (see lately Yasur-Landau 2002; T. Dothan 2003).4 There is no real evidence, however, re garding the size of this new population or the extent of the remaining indigenous one (e.g., Brug 1985: 134). As for the origin of the newcomers, the most oft-quoted options are (various parts of) the Aegean (A. Mazar 1990: 307; Stager 1995: 348; Yasur-Lan dau 2002; T. Dothan 2003), Anatolia (Singer 1988), Cyprus (Brug 1985: 135), Cyprus and Anatolia (Killebrew 2000: 243), and different combinations thereof.5 In contrast, until recently, hardly any tangible ar chaeological evidence for northern "Sea People" has been forthcoming. As a result, nearly all general studies concerning "Sea People" in the Levant con centrate almost exclusively on the Philistines, men tioning the others only in passing?with very little explicit concern for material culture (in major text 3 The biblical testimony?especially the descriptions of Asher's inheritance, from the Carmel range in the south to Tyre (Josh 19:24-31), and that of Manasseh, south of Asher, as far as the Qanah Brook (Josh 17:7-14)?led to the traditional concept whereby most of the region under investigation here (southern Phoenicia) was part of the tribal inheritance (Aharoni 1979: 249, map 18; see also Lemaire 1991: 136). Alternatively, Lemaire (1991: 144), following others, suggested that the term "tribe" for Asher is misleading, and that it was a geographical designation, re lating to the territory north of the Carmel at least from the Late Bronze Age. The relatively late annexation of this region to the Israelite ensemble is reflected in Asher's pedigree?being a son of one of Jacob's concubines. For further discussions of the biblical perspective, see Edelman 1992; G. Lehmann 2001: 88-89. 4 Other than the abundant "foreign" pottery (including coarse wares), there are, for example, "western" architectural affinities, installations, Mycenaean or Cypriot-type figurines and loom weights, new dietary habits, and possibly new flint artifacts, indi cating significant changes in various aspects of social behavior (see summary in Barako 2000: 522-24). 5Early views regarding their origin in the Mediterranean and beyond (mainly the Balkans) were mainly based on etymological and historical considerations; cf., for example, Singer 1988: 241 42, nn. 16-22; Dothan and Dothan 1992: 3-37; Drews 1993: 53 72; Bryce 1998: 369-70. books, see Sandars 1978: 170; A. Mazar 1990: chap. 8; Dothan and Dothan 1992: 210-11; Stager 1995). Still, at cAkko, "Myc IIIC" sherds were taken to rep resent the SHRDN (M. Dothan 1989; Dothan and Dothan 1992: 213-15);6 and M. Bietak, for one (1993: 301), stated that "Quantities of Myc. IIIC:lb ware" at Tell Abu Hawam and at Tell Keisan make it likely that the former served as a bridgehead for Sea Peoples. A notable exception is E. Stern's (2000b) study, which concentrates on the material culture of the "northern Sea People," and which is referred to in detail in this paper. As for SKL material culture, allusions to Tel Zeror in the Sharon Plain as a possible SKL settlement were based mainly on the site's location and not on any analysis of material culture (e.g., Kochavi 1993: 1526; A. Mazar 1990: 326; Dothan and Dothan 1992: 211; the excavations at this site were only sketchily published [Ohata and Kochavi 1966-1970]). There fore, excavations initiated by E. Stern at Tel Dor, on Israel's Carmel coast (the SKL stronghold according to Wenamun), promised to be instructive. Based on the Egyptian records, this is the only site that can be directly associated with a non-Philistine "Sea People," and thus some distinct material culture was anticipated. Early Iron Age horizons were indeed extensively unearthed at Dor,7 but after two decades of excavations, the sought-for foreign associations of SKL material culture proved to be extremely elusive. This paper proposes to investigate this phenomenon in a wider context. Phoenicia and Phoenicians in the Early Iron Age, and Their Relations with "Sea Peoples" In turn, the Early Iron Age in "Phoenicia" is still annoyingly fuzzy. Phoenicia has long been consid ered one of the few areas that were least affected by the dramatic demographic and other terminal Late Bronze Age upheavals, and supposedly retained its autochthonous, Canaanite inhabitants and sociopoliti cal structure. It is common practice to employ inter changeably the terms "Canaanite" and "Phoenician," the latter borrowed from Greek and Latin writers 6Lately, A. Zertal (2001) identified what he considers SHRDN material culture in an altogether different region?at Tell el Akhwat in the cIron Pass, which connects the Sharon Plain inland. 7See, especially, Stern 1990; 1991; 1993; 1999; 2000a: chap 3 and pp. 345-64; 2000b; Gilboa and Sharon 2003; Sharon and Gil boa in press; and references to preliminary reports.

This is based on the widely held conviction that the Phoenicians are merely the Iron Age descendants of the (coastal) Late Bronze Age Canaanites (e.g., Muhly 1970: 27; Baurain 1986).8 This situation is considered the context of the emer gence of the famed Phoenician commercial "em pire," attested in the later Iron Age. Textual evidence regarding the Phoenician Early Iron Age is scarce. The Wenamun report (n. 1) de scribes Byblos as a thriving economic center with a complex administration and extensive fleets, en gaged in commercial pacts with Egypt and others, and also mentions Tyre and Sidon in passing. Assyr ian records have preserved testimony of expeditions in the late 12th/early 11th centuries b.c.e. reaching westward as far as Phoenicia, mentioning the lands of Byblos, Sidon, and Arwad and a march to the city of Samuru (Grayson 1976: 23, ??81-83; 47, ?212; 55, ?248; 56, ?249). But it is a statement preserved by Justin (Epitoma XVIII, 3, 5) that proved the most intriguing. Accord ing to him, Tyre was founded by the Sidonians, in flight from the Ascalonians, one year before the sack of Troy (Katzenstein 1973: 59, n. 82). Though the historical value of this statement is dubious, Katzen stein interpreted it as a reflection of a Philistine (i.e., "Sea People") raid in Phoenicia. B. Mazar, on the other hand (1967: 3-15), believed this encounter to have occurred between the cities of Philistia and Phoenicia. The primary importance of Justin's state ment thus lies in the fact that for a number of schol ars it provided evidence of aggressive activity by "Sea People" along the Phoenician coast. Archaeological study of the Phoenician homeland has been hampered by the dense overburden of late construction on the ancient sites, as well as by recent political conflicts, and archaeological data are dras 8 For ancient associations between Chna (Canaan) and Phoe nicia, see, for example, Muhly 1970: n. 46; for a possible associ ation of Egyptian Fenkhu and Phoenicia, see Vandersleyen 1987; and for a dismissal of any such connection, etymological or geographical, see Muhly 1970: 31; Aubet 1993: 9. In Gen 9:18 Canaan is the son of Ham, and not of Shem. This attribution, in spite of the obvious general Semitic descent of its population, was explained by Aharoni as being due to the long association with Egypt (Aharoni 1979: 7). In the Table of Nations (Gen 10; 1 Chr 1:1-23), usually attributed to an early phase of the Hebrew mon archy, Sidon, cArqat, and Arvad are mentioned as Canaan's de scendants. In contrast to the Philistines, for whom the Bible clearly retains memories of a westerly origin, no such connotation was attached to the people of Canaan. tically scarcer than in Philistia. In general, the end of the Late Bronze Age in the region investigated here does indicate some signs of trauma, as in ex tensive regions of the eastern Mediterranean. The Late Bronze Age temple at Tel Mevorakh ceased to function (Stern 1984: 8-9). At Dor the situation is yet unclear. The Late Bronze Age town has not been located yet, and thus there are no grounds for Stager's (1995: 338) suggestion that it was violently destroyed. It is clear, however, that the Early Iron Age town was significantly larger than its predeces sor and was immediately fortified. Assessing the date of this growth is crucial. Based on the limited data at hand, this seems not to have happened at the very beginning of the Iron Age, but at a time when Philistine Bichrome pottery was already in existence (Gilboa and Sharon 2003: 31). At Tel Nami, north of Dor, trading activity comes to a halt at the close of the Bronze Age, and the site is then deserted (Artzy 1995: 32). At Shikmona, south of the cAkko Bay, the sketchy published evidence indicates that a Late Bronze Age building, apparently of public character (Stratum 16), goes out of use in the Early Iron Age (Elgavish 1994: 36, 47). At Tell Abu Hawam, the Late Bronze Age public buildings?the citadel and Temple 50?were indeed abandoned or destroyed (this is Balensi's Stratum Vc early, in her latest treatment of the site's stratigra phy; Balensi, Herrera, and Artzy 1993: 13). In the first Iron Age stratum (Balensi's Vc late), some of the less imposing structures of the Late Bronze Age con tinue in use, but new ones are built and the acropolis assumes a new layout. Whether all this happened in a rapid sequence or after a lengthy gap (around the mid-1 lth century) is yet indeterminable. At Tell Kei san, in the one small deep probe in Area B, there is indeed a severe "Late Bronze Age destruction" (Stra tum 13; Humbert 1981: 389; 1988: 66) but one that seals vessels of the LC IIIA typological horizon and thus is later than most "classic" destruction events of the southern Levant. Tyre and Sarepta, at least in the excavated areas, continue without interruption, architecturally, typologically, and functionally; there are no destructions (for Tyre: Bikai 1978: 73; 1992: 133; for Sarepta: Anderson 1988: 423). At Beirut, recent excavations have demonstrated that between the end of the Bronze Age and the 10th century b.c.e., the city was impressively refortified, but a more precise date for this event and the nature of the Late Bronze/Iron Age transition have not been elu cidated yet (e.g., Badre 1997: 50-66).</page><page sequence="5">2005 AN INTERPRETATION OF SlKILA (SKL) MATERIAL CULTURE 51 A survey conducted in cAkko's vicinity was in terpreted as indicating a sharp break in settlement pattern in the plain between the Late Bronze and Early Iron Ages, exemplified by a reduction in the number of settlements and extent of settled area, and a less pronounced settlement hierarchy. This break was much more pronounced regarding small settlements than large ones, and thus it was proposed that the impression of continuity, usually gleaned from the larger settlements on the tells, is mislead ing (G. Lehmann 2001: 76-87). It will be possible to evaluate these suggestions only after the ceramic criteria for distinguishing Late Bronze vs. Iron Age settlements are published, and likewise, the criteria for defining settlement size. (Previous surveys in southern Phoenicia?Ronen and Olami 1978; 1983; Frankel and Getzov 1997; Olami, Ronen, and Ro mano 2003?have produced only scant relevant data.) Similarly, evidence for the nature of the Late Bronze/ Iron Age transition from such media as architecture, glyptics, and other works of art is still very scarce.9 Early Iron Age stratigraphic/artifactual sequences, crucial for the evaluation of the incipient Phoenician culture, have been excavated chiefly in southern Phoenicia?at Dor, Tell Abu Hawam, Tell Keisan, Tyre, and Sarepta. The sites of cAkko and Akhziv, and sites farther to the north (Sidon, Khald?, Beirut, Byblos, Tell Arqa, and Arwad) have not yet pro duced comparative sequences and thus are not ex plicitly referred to in this paper. Curiously enough, though the dearth of archaeological evidence has been lamented by many a scholar, the available data, in print for two decades or so, have not benefited from any attempt at synthesis. Studies relating to the Phoenician coast in this period are still based mainly on historical and not archaeological considerations (e.g., Muhly 1985: 178-79; Stieglitz 1990; and even Bikai 1992). Based mainly on the above-mentioned historical records, scholarly opinions concerning the fate of the Phoenician cities during the Early Iron Age have varied. Especially divergent are the assessments of the nature, extent, and duration of the Sea Peoples' impact. Some scholars have indeed emphasized the relative social and ethnic stability, especially when 9For an attempt at assessing continuity/discontinuity between Late Bronze Age "Canaan" and Iron Age "Phoenicia," taking into account language, script, toponyms, anthroponymes, religion, and archaeological data (which has, however, led to ambiguous con clusions), see R?llig 1982. compared with the coastal areas north and south of Phoenicia. According to Moscati, for example (1988: 25), the Phoenician centers can be "negatively dif ferentiated," i.e., those sites that were affected neither by the establishment of the Hebrews and Aramaeans nor by the invasions of the "Sea Peoples" (and sim ilarly Stern 1990: 30; Redford 1992: 299; Markoe 2000: 12). M. Heltzer is of the few scholars who tried to explain this situation, suggesting that the rea son for the unparalleled endurance of the Phoenician cities into the Iron Age was that, in contrast to the surrounding polities, they did not suffer the social disintegration that severely affected the latter toward the end of the Bronze Age (Heltzer 1988: 15), but he does not offer an explanation for this fortunate situa tion in Phoenicia (see similarly Yon 1992: 120). Many scholars, however, hold a very different view, namely, that the Phoenician cities did suffer devastation by Sea People, but swiftly recuperated. Katzenstein (1973: 59) found it surprising that the Phoenicians managed to survive "the terrible destruc tions of their principal cities." According to Stager (1995: 336, 338), the Sea Peoples established bridge heads from Tarsus to Ashkelon. Bietak's interpreta tion of "Myc IIIC" at cAkko, Tell Abu Hawam, and Tell Keisan as indicating Sea People bridgeheads has already been cited (see also Dever 1992: 101, 103, fig. 13.1), and some "Myc IIIC" fragments at Byblos were similarly explained (Salles 1980: 35). The prevailing opinion among these scholars is that, subsequently, these coastal cities manifest a Canaanite/Phoenician "revival," meaning that, as op posed to other coastal sites, the detrimental impact of the Sea People did not linger there (Stieglitz 1990: 10; Aubet 1993: 21). The reason (e.g., Singer 1988: 248, 250) is that the northern "Sea People" gradually assimilated into the neighboring populations, which, inter alia, accounts for the fact that, unlike the Phi listines, no remembrance of them has been preserved in the Bible. Phoenicians Conquering Sea People E. Stern has offered a somewhat divergent in terpretation of events along the northern Canaanite coast, based on his excavations at Dor. There, the first part of the early Iron Age sequence terminates with a conspicuous, probably site-wide destruction, dated by him to ca. 1050 b.c.e. Following this de struction (but not immediately; see Gilboa and Sharon 2003: 33) are the first (and abundant) occurrences of</page><page sequence="6">52 AYELET GILBOA BASOR 337 Phoenician Bichrome ware, the ceramic group often considered the most conspicuous material mani festation of the early Phoenicians. Thus Stern sug gested that in the 12th century, among the coastal areas north of Philistia, only the Carmel coast and the cAkko Plain were invaded by Sea People (SKL and SHRDN). But in turn, Dor, cAkko, and possibly other towns in the vicinity (Akhziv, Tell Abu Ha wam, and Tell Keisan) succumbed to an aggressive, economically motivated expansion of the Phoeni cians to the south, around the mid-11th century b.c.e. (e.g., Stern 1990: 30). According to Stern, then, in the beginning of the Iron Age, the cAkko Plain and the Carmel coast constitute part of the "Sea Peoples' sphere," and after their conquest they become part of Phoenicia, when Phoenicians comprise the bulk of the population (Stern 1991: 92). This model is most clearly presented in Stern 2000b: 201, where the Early Iron Age sequence at Dor is divided into two? a "Sikilian" sequence (early and late) followed by a "Phoenician" succession. The concept of Phoenician military activism in the 11th century b.c.e. gained quick approval (Negbi 1992: 611; Bikai 1992; Machinist 2000: 65; Markoe 2000: 30-31). Lately, M. E. Aubet based her entire reconstruction of Tyrian involvement overseas on the notion of coercive expansion, annexing port cit ies and agricultural territories, beginning with the cAkko Plain and the Carmel coast, as exemplified at Dor (Aubet 2000: esp. p. 81). A parallel de struction is identified by her at cAkko (Aubet 2000: 81-82).10 SOME METHODOLOGICAL NOTES Regional Definitions Preliminary analysis (Gilboa 1998; now also Gil boa and Sharon 2003) suggested that the Sitz im leben of the ceramic culture of Dor (like that of Tell Keisan) and its commercial vista is the coast north of it, including the very "heartland" of Phoenicia? the Lebanese coast (and part of Israel's northern valleys), and that, on the other hand, these differ sig nificantly from those in Philistia. It was concluded that, as far as ceramic culture and its evolution are concerned, if a line has to be drawn at all, it should 10But it is unclear which destruction is being referred to. be drawn somewhere around the Yarkon River or somewhat north of it. Therefore, in the following discussion, the Carmel coast and cAkko Plain are clustered with the coastal territories north of them? discussed under the term "Phoenicia"?and are dis associated from Philistia. Regarding Phoenicia, my northern scope ends somewhere near Sarepta, for practical reasons: Early Iron Age sequences at more northerly sites in Phoenicia are unknown. Chronology The absolute chronology of the early Iron Age in Israel has been the subject of spirited controversy following I. Finkelstein's suggestion (1996) to lower conventional absolute dates by 75-100 years. Dor plays a prominent part in this debate, as Early Iron Age 14C determinations obtained there support the low chronology (references in Gilboa and Sharon 2003). However, this is still an unsettled issue, and thus relative, archaeological terminology is employed here, rather than absolute dates. As at this point I am concerned mainly with processes, I do not consider this a major drawback, though eventually the pro posed scenario will have to be pegged into a calen daric/historical framework. The purposely culturally neutral chronological terminology employed here is the one suggested in Gilboa and Sharon 2003. It divides the early Phoenician Iron Age into the fol lowing horizons: LB\Ir. A transitional Late Bronze/Early Iron Age horizon, paralleling A. Mazar's (1990: 296) Iron Age IA. Contexts in Phoenicia belonging to this horizon are, for example, Sarepta (part of Stratum G in Trench 11/Y), Tyre (part of Stratum XIV), and Tell Keisan Stratum 13. This horizon parallels LC IIIA in Cyprus and dates to an unspecified time within the 12th century, starting no earlier than ca. 1180 b.c.e. Irla (early and late). At Dor, these two horizons are the ones termed by Stern "Sikilian," the Irla late being the horizon that terminates with the large destruction. To this horizon belong Sarepta (parts of Strata G and F in Trench 11/Y), Tyre (part of Stratum XIV), and Tell Keisan Strata 12-10 (probably part of 9c as well). They mainly parallel LC IIIB in Cyprus. On conventional Levantine chronology, this horizon dates to ca. 1160-1090 b.c.e. At Dor, radiometric dates place the destruction around 1000 b.c.e.</page><page sequence="7">2005 AN INTERPRETATION OF SlKILA (SKL) MATERIAL CULTURE 53 A transitional Irla\b horizon, followed by Irlb. These are the earliest horizons that at Dor follow the major destruction, and thus they are included in Stern's "Phoenician" sequence. Contemporary con texts are Sarepta (Stratum E2 in Trench II/Y), Tyre (part of Stratum XIV, and Stratum XIII), Tell Keisan (Strata 9a-b and possibly part of c), and Tell Abu Hawam (Vc late, IV-1, and IV-2). In Cyprus the contemporary horizons are CG IA and mid-CG I. Traditionally, Irlb ("the Megiddo VIA horizon") dates ca. 1050-980 b.c.e., and by the low chronol ogy mainly to the 10th century.

This newly defined horizon parallels such contexts as Sarepta El, Tyre XII-X, Tell Keisan 8c, Tell Abu Hawam IV-3, IV-4, and Tell Mevorakh VIII. This is the last horizon of Stern's Phoenician sequence; it parallels CG IB-II in Cyprus. Conventionally it should date to the early tenth century b.c.e. (a "Davidic" horizon) and, by the low chronology, to the early ninth. Ir2a. This parallels (at least the beginning of) conventional Iron Age ILA and early CG III in Cy prus. Conventional dates for its beginning are in the early to mid-tenth century b.c.e., and low ones are around the early to mid-ninth. Aims and Methods This paper attempts to offer another perspective for reading the Early Iron Age material record of the southern Levantine littoral, especially focusing on the domains of the "northern Sea People," and to in terpret the elusive SKL material culture as revealed at Dor. It deals mostly with pottery. The shortcomings of an investigation concentrating predominantly on one medium are only too obvious, especially when pottery is involved. This choice was dictated, on the one hand, by the sort of data available (or rather, un available) for Early Iron Age sites along the northern Canaanite coast but, on the other, by my conviction that in this case at least pots provide useful clues (other material culture phenomena are considered, but are less useful). We shall probably never be able to explain every single artifact we encounter during excavation, and therefore the focus is on ceramic phenomena, on functional properties of pots and on their symbolic, emic, and etic meanings. As identities are never ne gotiated in a vacuum, the elucidation of the "other" in the contexts surveyed here is of prime impor tance.11 Thus an emphasis is put on the juxtaposition of stylistic expressions in adjacent entities?in this case, between the regions roughly north and south of the Yarkon River. The following is a synthesis of previous studies, which have dealt, in a somewhat detached manner, with the Phoenician Bichrome Group, early Cypro Geometric pottery in the Levant, Wavy-Band pithoi, and Philistine Bichrome pottery in Phoenicia (re spectively, Gilboa 1999a; 1999b; 2001a; Gilboa, Cohen-Weinberger, and Goren in press). Detailed arguments regarding the interpretation of these pot tery groups and pottery illustrations referred to here may be found in those papers, which are here sum marized only briefly (for additional illustrations, see also Gilboa 1998; Gilboa and Sharon 2003; Sharon and Gilboa in press: figs. 15-20). Figures 2 and 3 illustrate only pottery groups not presented in those papers. ARTIFACTUAL EVIDENCE A: THE LBllR TRANSITION AND IRIA The Local Repertoire As far as pottery is concerned, there is in Phoe nicia a conspicuous Late Bronze-Iron Age conti nuity, a phenomenon recognized and emphasized by investigators of all relevant sites, both those in "Phoenicia proper" and those in the cAkko Plain/ Carmel coast (e.g., Humbert 1981: 375 and Burda jewicz 1994: 112 for Tell Keisan; Anderson 1988: 386,423 for Sarepta). Significantly, the pottery in the postulated SKL and SHRDN territories (respectively, Dor, Tell Keisan, and cAkko) clusters with that to the north and east, and not with regions to the south. No significant changes whatsoever may be observed in the composition of the ceramic assemblages, parallel 11 Cf. Hodder 1991: 143: "... the boundaries around a group of similarities (such as a cultural unit) do not form the boundaries of the context, since the difference between cultural units may be relevant for an understanding of the meaning of objects within each cultural unit."</page><page sequence="8">54 AYELET GILBOA BASOR 337 to those occurring, for example, in Philistia or the highlands.12 Generally speaking, the assemblages are un derrated. This is especially conspicuous regarding tablewares, which by and large were not deemed worthy of embellishment. In contrast, commercial containers?such as flasks, particular types of jars, and strainer-spouted jugs?were almost systemati cally painted, indicating the commercial motivation for this effort (Gilboa 1998). In form and ornament, all these vessels are rooted in Canaanite tradition, and the painted designs are but a very simplified and cryptic version of their Late Bronze Age predeces sors. However, many flasks and some jars also re veal an association with Cypriot decorative concepts (discussed below with the Cypriot-style wares). Imports and Exports Very few overseas imports occur in Phoenicia at this stage. Fabric analyses have demonstrated a for eign origin for the "Myc IIIC" stirrup jar at Tell Keisan 13 (Cypriot; Balensi 1981) and for the few "Myc IIIC" fragments from cAkko, some of which are Cypriot, and one or two of which are apparently Aegean (D'Agata et al. 2003). In Phoenicia, other western-looking specimens, usually dubbed "Myc IIIC" (mostly stirrup jars and open bowls/skyphoi) were found at Byblos, Sarepta, Tyre, and Tell Keisan; but they are few, and it remains to be determined how many, if any, are actual imports, and whence they come.13 Also, some of the Cypriot-style "Wavy Band pithoi" discussed below may be actual imports. 12In Philistia, the main change is the introduction of signifi cant (but varying) quantities of decorated wares?the so-called Philistine Monochrome/local Myc IIIC and then Philistine Bi chrome, alongside other, undecorated utilitarian shapes of "west ern" types, the most noteworthy being cooking pots (quantitative data regarding these wares in Philistia are summarized in Gilboa, Cohen-Weinberger, and Goren in press; for Tell Miqne-cEkron, see T. Dothan and Zukerman 2004: table 1). In the highlands, an opposite process is evident: a drastic reduction of the repertoire to a few, mostly undecorated classes of pottery (Bunimovitz and Yasur-Landau 1996). 13For Byblos, in the K Necropolis, see Warren and Hankey 1989: 163. At Sarepta, in Trench II/Y, a few LC III fragments were reported by Anderson from Strata G and F, but only three are illustrated (Anderson 1988: pis. 28:19; 29:2; 30:10; all of them ap parently skyphoi); in Trench II/X a few such fragments may be at tributed to Period V, which roughly parallels Strata F and G in Trench Y (for example, Koehl 1985: cat. nos. 191, 192, 198, a stirrup jar and two skyphoi), and others were found in contexts of as yet unknown stratigraphy. In all, considering the extensive Late In Cyprus, however, the situation is entirely differ ent. Phoenician containers?jars and small flasks? are represented in LC IIIA and even more so in LC IIIB, in quantities that, relative to the paucity of such contexts, seem significant (e.g., references in Gilboa 1998: 423). Moreover, there is evidence in Cyprus for more than just trade: a local production of "Canaanite" jars is in evidence in LC IIIA both at Mdidi-Palaeokastro and at Hala Sultan Tekke, in sig nificant quantities (Hadjicosti 1988: 390, 393; Astr?m 1991; Fischer 1991). It should not come as a sur prise if future fabric analyses demonstrate that some of the "Canaanite" flasks in Cyprus were also locally produced. In this period Dor also produced evidence of intensive, probably maritime contacts with Egypt, involving some commodity packed in Egyptian jars (for complete specimens, see Stern 2000a: fig. 250); however, in this respect Dor remains an anomaly on the southern Levantine coast. It should be stressed that we are not dealing with an odd Egyptian frag ment here and there. The easily recognizable Nile clay fragments are found at Dor in numerous LBIIr and Irla loci. In addition, a few Philistine Bichrome (PhB) imports at Dor, Tell Keisan, and cAkko, start ing in Irla, attest to contacts with the southern coast and Shephelah (Gilboa, Cohen-Weinberger, and Goren in press). Cypriot-style Wares "Wavy-Band Pithoi." These pithoi (Gilboa 2001a) also reveal close contacts with Cyprus. They are pro lific on the coast from Dor to Sarepta, and in its hinterland, especially in Upper Galilee (and all but nonexistent in the extensively excavated early Iron Age sites in Philistia). Provenience analyses indicate that the lion's share of these pithoi were manufac tured locally, though a few were actually brought from the island (Gilboa 2001a). In order to under Bronze and Early Iron Age exposures in this trench, quantities are very modest. The so-called (single) "Myc IIIC" bowl from Tyre was lately suggested by S. Sherratt to be a Greek Proto-Geometric specimen (personal communication). Tell Keisan (Stratum 13, and possibly 12b) produced, in addition to the Cypriot stirrup jar, two skyphoi dubbed "Myc IIIC" (Burdajewicz 1994: pi. 15: 24), and there are at least two unstratified skyphoi, which were associated by Burdajewicz with the "Myc IIIC" of Cyprus (1994: pi. 35:12, 13); another, unstratified "Myc IIIC" stirrup-jar fragment was found during the British excavations there (Briend and Humbert 1980: 229-30, fig. 56).</page><page sequence="9">2005 AN INTERPRETATION OF SIKILA (SKL) MATERIAL CULTURE 55 stand the production of these pithoi on the main land (in the early Iron Age), we have to turn to Cyprus, where the LC IIIA disruptions (Iacovou 1989: 54-56; 1994; Catling's [1994: 134] "Indian summer of the Cypriot Bronze Age") terminated the social and economic apparatus which both orga nized their production and constituted their main cli entele. (For considerations of the socioeconomic role of large storage facilities, including pithoi, in sec ond-millennium Cyprus, see Keswani 1993; Knapp 1993; Webb and Frankel 1994; South 1995; for the few post-LC IIIA pithoi known in Cyprus, see, for example, Pilides 2000: e.g., 30-31, and references in Gilboa 2001a.) Cypriot pitharades were thus forced to seek new markets, and the thriving "pithoi consuming" centers of the nearby Phoenician coast must have provided an obvious solution. The fact that most of these pithoi were produced in that region indicates that this new commercial strategy also in volved the movement of craftsmen, though whether they permanently moved to the mainland or just extended an existing itinerant mode of production cannot be determined. For the interpretation of the conspicuous wavy-band decoration on these pithoi, recurring on nearly every specimen on the mainland (as opposed to the situation in Cyprus), two alterna tives must be considered. If a specific message was intended here (regarding contents, etc.), the target audience could only have been Cypriot?i.e., Cypri ots on the mainland, as the "local" clientele had no means of deciphering the significance of this design. Alternatively, it is possible that no such specific mes sages were intended and that this, the most con spicuous decoration ever to adorn Cypriot pithoi, was employed (extensively) as a means of express ing group affiliation?to be "read" by none other than the potters themselves, and possibly in their im mediate surroundings (see Gilboa 2001a: 169-70). Painted Flasks and Jars. Along the northern coast, on numerous flasks (especially small ones) and on many jars, a curious new introduction is ob servable in the decorative syntax. The Late Bronze Age Canaanite predecessors of the flasks were deco rated primarily with concentric circles, which are usually of the same width and more or less evenly distributed on the faces of the vessels. Often, contin uous spirals were employed in their stead. In Phoe nicia in Irla, on numerous flasks, the concentric circles are clustered into one or two clearly defined groups, each of them comprising what I termed an "enclosed bands decoration": in each "group" the outer circles are wider than the rest (concurrently, "earlier" modes of paintings are still attested). The origin of this decorative syntax could only have been Cyprus, where such designs are prolific on con temporary and earlier ceramics, and indeed consti tute one of the hallmarks of Cypriot secondary decorative motifs (for all these designs, see Gilboa 1999a: respectively fig. 15:3, 4, b; fig. 15:1, 2, a; fig. 8:4-6, c). Most significant is the fact that in Phoeni cia this configuration is employed exclusively on commercial containers and is not attested on other painted pots (though, admittedly, the latter are few). Miscellaneous Vessels. Occasionally, other pot tery vessels along the northern littoral manifest sty listic links with Cyprus: At Tell Keisan, at least one jug in the LBIIr horizon (Stratum 13; see Burdaje wicz 1994: pi. 13:20) clearly echoes LC IIC/LC III jugs in its morphology and decorations, but is appar ently not Cypriot made (Gilboa and Sharon 2003: n. 4). At Dor, a painted amphoroid-krater and a painted strainer-jug in the Irla late horizon (Gilboa and Sharon 2003: figs. 2: 18; 5: 7; photographs in Stern 2000a: pi. IX: 6; Sharon and Gilboa in press: fig. 18), two of the very few vessels other than com mercial containers that anyone took the trouble to decorate, reveal close stylistic affinities with LC IIIB wares (but parallel designs may also be found in Syria). Both were manufactured somewhere along the Carmel coast, most probably at Dor itself (p?tro graphie analysis conducted by A. Cohen-Weinberger and Y. Goren; it is not a Cypriot import, as deduced in Barako 2000: table 1 and n. 10). Other "Western" Ceramic Manifestations "Myc IIIC!9 The term "Myc IIIC" in the Levantine context is an extremely problematic catch-all term for all sorts of Early Iron Age ceramic fabrics and phe nomena (and often single sherds) and all kinds of "western" associations. The Philistine aspect of this phenomenon is embodied by the ceramic composi tions of such sites as Ashdod, Tell Miqne-cEkron, and Ashkelon, where locally produced "western-looking" fine wares, comprising a variegated assortment of shapes, some even manufactured by western-derived techniques, constitute a significant portion of the sites' ceramic assemblages.</page><page sequence="10">56 AYELET GILBOA BASOR 337 When quantities and the typological variety are considered, it is immediately evident that nothing like the "local Myc IllC/Philistine Monochrome" phenomenon of Philistia ever existed north of the Yarkon River, in any of the Phoenician sites. The "western-looking" specimens at Byblos, Sarepta, Tyre, cAkko, and Tell Keisan have already been re ferred to. As mentioned, for most of them the place of production cannot yet be determined (at least some may indeed be "local"); the few "Myc III" sherds at cAkko, most of them of deep bowls/sky phoi, were proven by fabric analysis to be of non local manufacture. But these vessels never became part and parcel of the ceramic habitus of these sites, which, of course, is what renders them so conspicu ous. At both Tell Abu Hawam and Dor, not a single potsherd that can be dubbed Myc IIIC has ever been uncovered.14 Moreover, at all these sites the typo logical variety is extremely limited and, in this re spect too, is totally incompatible with the Myc IIIC and PhB (Philistine Bichrome) ensembles of Philis tia (though neither do the latter constitute "complete" assemblages). In fact, there are only two dominant types of vessels. The most prolific are stirrup jars, which are also the most frequently encountered Myc IIIC imports in other regions15 and should be under stood in a commercial context. Next come deep bowls/ skyphoi, a phenomenon addressed below. This situation is, of course, "pardonable" for some of these sites, as they were never considered Sea People sites (though for all of them, some impact by Sea People was envisioned by certain scholars), but does come as a surprise for Dor which, as befits the capital of the SKL, was expected to produce such 14Regarding Tell Abu Hawam, this is a dangerous assertion, as most of the pottery was discarded by Hamilton in the field. Still, attractive, Mycenaean-looking sherds would probably count among the pottery he would have kept (as were Late Bronze Age Mycenaean sherds). No such pottery was found during later exca vations at the site (Balensi 1985: n. 18), but this absence at Tell Abu Hawam may have a chronological reason: it is quite possible that the site was not inhabited at the very beginning of the Iron Age. Regarding Dor, this situation is conspicuous even if we pos tulate a gap (in the one currently excavated area that reached this horizon) at the very beginning of the Iron Age (for this possibility, see Gilboa and Sharon 2003: 56). After two decades of excava tion, not a single "Myc IHC-resembling item" has come to light, though both Middle and Late Bronze Age redeposited pieces, for example, are prolific in Early Iron Age contexts. 15For example, at Beth She'an (S. Sherratt and A. Mazar, per sonal communication), and possibly also Dan (Ilan 1999: 95). ceramic evidence, and likewise for cAkko and Tell Keisan, the SHRDN bases. Philistine Bichrome (PhB) Ware. A similar di vergence, between Philistia and the regions north of it, is evident regarding the slightly later PhB. In Philistia this ware is geographically more widespread than the local "Myc IIIC," though relative quantities at the various sites vary and often are difficult to estimate (Brug 1985: 67-103; at Tel Miqne-cEkron, not included in Brug's survey, quantities range be tween 15 and 50 percent [T. Dothan and Y. Garfinkel, personal communications; T. Dothan and Zukerman 2004: table 1]). At Dor, PhB fragments were taken to represent SKL material culture (e.g., T. Dothan 1982: 69; Stern 2000b: fig. 10.3). However, it is now evi dent that (a) their quantity there is miniscule, (b) they comprise mostly containers, and (c) as demonstrated by petrography, these containers indeed originate in Philistia. PhB ware was definitely intrusive in Dor's ceramic environment, and the few fragments uncov ered probably embody commercial ties with some Philistine site(s)?in this particular case, a rather southern one. A similar situation is evident at Tell Keisan and at cAkko, where PhB vessels are rare and comprise mostly small containers. In fact, the scar city of PhB pottery along the northern coast is per haps its most revealing characteristic. Considering the ease of access between the regions north and south of the Yarkon River, and the fact that PhB pot tery did travel to farther regions, it seems that PhB ware was deliberately avoided by the inhabitants of the northern coast (see Gilboa, Cohen-Weinberger, and Goren in press). The "Northern Skyphoi" Phenomenon. On the other hand, one ceramic phenomenon in the north stands out in its "western" association. At Tell Keisan, and less so at Dor, significant numbers of deep bell shaped bowls, or skyphoi, are attested?a new form, certainly of some "western" derivation. A. Mazar was the first to point out that in the Early Iron Age, clumsy and poorly decorated bell-shaped bowls are known mainly from "Northern Palestine," i.e., he recognized them as a spatial phenomenon, rather than a tempo ral one as previously suggested by T. Dothan (she related them to her late phase of Philistine pottery; see A. Mazar 1985a: 90). At the outset, it must be stated that on no account can these skyphoi be confused with the "Myc IIIC/ PhB" pottery phenomena in Philistia. First, they are</page><page sequence="11">2005 AN INTERPRETATION OF SIKILA (SKL) MATERIAL CULTURE 57 indeed the only significant group whose morphology may be linked to the "west,"16 unlike the signifi cantly more variegated "western" repertoires of Phi listia. They also differ greatly in the quality of their manufacture. Most of them are rather crude, not much effort was invested in the treatment of their surface, and they are very simply and haphazardly adorned or altogether undecorated. The designs are very simple linear ones, usually just a few horizon tal bands; in other cases they are limited to simple, sketchy spirals. More intricate geometric designs, or figurative ones like those produced by the proficient painters of Philistia, are not attested.17 Also, there is a large variability in the fabrics and surface treat ments of the "Northern Skyphoi." At Dor (fig. 2; mainly in Irla and then rapidly vanishing) hardly any two fragments are really similar, though, as demon strated by petrography (A. Cohen-Weinberger and Y. Goren, personal communication), most of them were produced locally (on the Carmel coast or in Dor itself). In this they differ from the specialized, often quite canonic production of Philistia's deco rated wares, indicating a different mode of produc tion. This is also borne out by the relatively restricted quantities of these skyphoi. At Tell Keisan (fig. 3) some skyphoi in the as semblage, mostly the decorated ones, were discussed under the "Philistine pottery" epithet (Burdajewicz 1994: 87), and others were dubbed "Myc IIIC" (see above), but, as at Dor, they are generally of poor quality, produced of a large array of fabrics, most of them coarse (Burdajewicz 1994: 88), and only a few are more delicate (for instance, Burdajewicz 1994: pi. 25:12, 13 from Stratum 11 and pi. 33:1, 2 from Stratum 10a). Burdajewicz (1994: 54-55) suggested that they were modeled on Mycenaean skyphoi. These bell-shaped painted bowls at Tell Keisan, however, are not an isolated ceramic phenomenon there. Numerous undecorated (and some once-deco rated but now plain) skyphoi are present there, labeled by Burdajewicz with the culturally neutral designa tion Bol B.IV and discussed separately from the "Phil istine" and "Myc IIIC" specimens. B.IV bowls were relatively frequent (17 percent) in Stratum 13, after which the frequency dropped in Stratum 12 (2.5 per cent of all bowls) and increased again (9.33 percent in 16 Some, vary rare, bell-shaped kraters occur as well. 17 On the other hand, unadorned skyphoi like those in the north are rare in Philistia (T. Dothan and Zukerman 2004: 18). Stratum 11; 10.72 percent in 10; see Burdajewicz 1994: table on p. 164). According to Burdajewicz, these bowls are attested at Tell Keisan in unknown, but apparently restricted numbers until Stratum 9 and even in 8c (of the Irlalb, Irlb, and Irll2 horizons), and then they disappear. As will be argued below, the separation of "Philistine" skyphoi on one hand and "B.IV bowls" on the other obscures the cultural phe nomenon they epitomize. At Sarepta, Anderson's X-23 is a skyphos-shaped bowl, occurring in Trench 11/Y in Strata G2-E (Late Bronze Age until Irlb). At the close of the Late Bronze Age, it accounts for 6.3 to 7 percent of all the bowls in Strata Gl and F, and quantities are re duced to 4 percent in Stratum E, and then these bowls disappear (calculations based on Anderson 1988: table 3; for quantities in Trench II/X, see Khal ifeh 1988: table 4). As at Tell Keisan, these skyphoi are accompanied by simply decorated specimens, which comprise a generous share of the (infrequent) "Aegean-derived shapes"18 (dubbed "Late Helladic IIIB late," "Simple Style," "Derivative Mycenaean," "Levanto-Mycenaean," "Cypro-Mycenaean," and "LH IIIC"; see Koehl 1985: 109-22). Whether these are imported or locally produced cannot yet be deter mined with certainty. ARTIFACTUAL EVIDENCE BI THE IRlAllB TRANSITION AND 1R1B The Iron la sequence at Dor ends with a seem ingly site-wide, though certainly not complete, de struction.19 If one seeks a parallel destruction at Tell Keisan, one may possibly think of that identified by Burdajewicz (1994: e.g., table V.2) at the end of Stra tum 10a.20 In contrast, contra Aubet's (2000: 81-82) suggestion, no such destruction has been identified at cAkko.21 18Most of the other specimens are stirrup jars. 19As regards architectural continuation after the major de struction, Dor presents a complex picture. In Area Bl the post destruction epoch is characterized by new construction and further expansion of the town. In Area G, the building devastated was renovated, and the new builders seem to have been intimately ac quainted with the structure they renovated, implying that they were the same people. 20For the chronological proximity of this stratum to the Irla late horizon at Dor, see Gilboa and Sharon 2003: tables 11, 21. 21 It is yet unclear whether this period is represented at Tell Abu Hawam.</page><page sequence="12">58 AYELET GILBOA BASOR 337 ~BF ? i 6 [t.mmiuia 1 S55S55 ? ?

Stern perceives a cultural dichotomy between the early Iron Age layers pre- and post-dat ing the destruction, i.e., between his "Sikilian" and "Phoenician" sequences (Stern 2000b: 201), between the horizons designated here LBIIr and Irla (early and late) on the one hand, and Irlalb, Irlb, and Irll2 on the other. The Phoenician takeover of the "Sikilian" town was deduced primarily by the appear ance, after the destruction, of significant quantities of Phoenician Bichrome pottery. It seems, however, that continuity, rather than divergence, is in evidence. The Local Repertoire The general pottery assemblage at Dor exhibits a continuous sequence before and after this destruc tion. This is also true for contemporary contexts at Tell Keisan (Stratum 9) and also (naturally, some would say) for Tyre (Stratum XIII) and Sarepta (Stra tum E2) (Gilboa 2001b: chaps. 6-9; Gilboa and Sharon 2003: figs. 2-17, tables 2-20). Imports and Exports The (few) classes of imports that were attested in the previous horizons are still present: chiefly Egyp tian jars (mostly at Dor, as before)22 and probably also an unclear number of "Wavy-Band" pithoi.23 In addition, some PhB was unearthed at Tell Keisan (in Stratum 9), and one or two PhB fragments at Dor may belong to this horizon (Gilboa, Cohen-Wein berger, and Goren in press). But a new import is now attested in Phoenicia. At Tyre (starting in Stratum XIII) and at Dor (starting in the Irlb horizon), Cypriot decorated fine wares ap pear, chiefly open shapes (mainly White Painted [WP I]). At Dor, one or two "WP I" fragments seem to have been locally produced.24 Early CG I imports 22 And a few fragments at Tell Abu Hawam (e.g., Balensi 1980: 349, pi. 12:6, perhaps also pi. 10:4, 5), possibly also at cAkko (E. Marcus, personal communication). 23E.g., Cohen-Weinberger and Wolff 2001: 651, cat. no. 66, which originates from a post-destruction context, and not as des ignated there. However, in the post-destruction layers at Dor, only fragments of such pithoi were uncovered, possibly redeposited. Contemporaneous contexts such as Sarepta Y/E and Tyre XIII yielded considerable amounts of Cypriot-style pithoi fragments, but it is unknown whether they are actual imports. 24At other Phoenician sites, such as Sarepta, such Cypro Geometric (CG) imports are significantly fewer. CG imports un earthed recently at Beirut do not antedate Iron Age II (they are mainly Type III vessels and later types; see Badre 1998). are now attested also outside Phoenicia (for example, at Megiddo VIA) but are very rare. The difference between Phoenicia and its immediate southerly neighbor is again instructive. In early Iron Age con texts in Philistia, only a handful of early CG frag ments are attested, though exposures of this period are by far more extensive than those in Phoenicia (see also Barako 2000: 515-16). The restricted spa tial range of this import, coupled with the fact that tablewares rather than containers dominate the Tyre and Dor assemblages, indicate that these items should be regarded as "personal belongings" of sorts, hint ing again at some presence of Cypriots on the Phoe nician coast (detailed discussions may be found in Gilboa 1989; 1999b). Ceramic exports from Phoenicia to Cyprus now increase in number and may be characterized as follows: They include, again, only containers?jars and chiefly flasks and rounded jugs. In the begin ning (the Irlalb horizon; the LC IIIB/CG I transition in Cypriot terms), the containers involved are by and large the same as in the previous horizons, and similarly decorated.25 Soon, however (in Irlb, early to mid-CG I in Cyprus), these are almost totally replaced by the newly introduced Phoenician Bichrome containers. As regards the scope of this export, these vessels are attested in modest quantities in all the adjacent regions?from Upper Galilee to Philistia, and far ther afield (sparsely) in Egypt (e.g., Aston 1996: fig. 233:d, e; possibly also figs. 43:12, 233:a).26 But nowhere are they better attested than in Cyprus, where both Bichrome containers and earlier mono chrome ones, alongside jars, are amply represented in early CG I contexts (references in Gilboa 1999a: n. 7). Indeed, Cyprus seems to have been the main destination of these containers (and, of course, their contents). In contrast, contemporaneous exports from Philistia to the island are yet unattested (cf. Barako 2000). Cypriot-style Wares Cypriot-type Pithoi. These pithoi are still in evi dence at Tyre, Sarepta, and Dor (considerably less 25But morphologically they mirror the changes occurring in Phoenicia; Gilboa and Sharon 2003: 65. 26 Crete (Kornmos included) has not yet produced evidence of Phoenician ceramics of this horizon.</page><page sequence="15">2005 AN INTERPRETATION OF SlKILA (SKL) MATERIAL CULTURE 61 frequently), but it is difficult to assess how many of them still bear the wavy-band decoration.27 Tell Keisan9s "Levanto-Mycenaean IIIC Ware." In Stratum 9c at Tell Keisan (the Irlalb horizon),28 a peculiar assemblage of small containers was uncov ered, dubbed by the excavators "Cypro-Mycenaean" or "Levanto-Mycenaean IIIC ware" (Humbert 1981: 392; 1993: 864). They are of light brown-orange, polished, occasionally hand-burnished fabric, deco rated in semi-lustrous light red-orange paint. P?tro graphie analyses proved this group to be of mainland manufacture. Technologically, the vessels were of Canaanite tradition and were fired at a much lower temperature than their alleged Mycenaean prototypes (Courtois 1980: 354-58). The group comprises pyxides (Briend and Hum bert 1980: pi. 70:l-lf), flasks (large lentoid, globu lar, and asymmetric ones; and small lentoid ones; Briend and Humbert 1980: pis. 74-76); and jugs that are rounded or (mostly) squat, occasionally biconical (Briend and Humbert 1980: pi. 70:2-4b). The excavators first interpreted the group as of lo cal production in Mycenaean tradition, but most of the parallels cited by them, especially for the jugs, were Cypriot LC IIIB ones (Peuch 1980: 218). Later on, Humbert (1981: 391) characterized the group as a whole as an amalgamation of Cypriot, Mycenaean, and Levantine elements, the Mycenaean elements being the pyxides, the rounded jugs, and the painted linear decoration; the Cypriot elements being the shape of the jugs (which he dubbed "bilbil-shaped") and the somewhat more composite decorative de signs on the jugs; and the Levantine elements being the flasks and the "biconical" jugs. Burdajewicz (1994: 77) rejected the association with LC IIIB Cy prus on chronological grounds and instead suggested that the Cypriot-looking jugs were imitation Base Ring ones (see critique in Gilboa and Sharon 2003: 42). In fact, there is nothing "Mycenaean" about this group. All the decorations, like the vertical ladder designs on the jugs, are of clear Canaanite origin. The sole exceptions to this statement are the "en closed bands" configurations on some of the flasks (e.g., Briend and Humbert 1980: pi. 76:4a, 4b, 4k), which, as argued here, are of Cypriot derivation. Re garding shape, the flasks also evolve from Late Bronze Age and earlier Iron Age antecedents. Like wise, no (direct) Mycenaean impetus should be sought for the pyxides, a shape well at home in the Canaanite repertoire from the Late Bronze Age, as recognized by Puech (1980: 221, 225). The jugs, however, are indeed instructive of some nonlocal as sociation; they definitely echo the morphology of Cypriot LC IIIB and CG I jugs (Gilboa and Sharon 2003: n. 6). Thus, again, this group has nothing to do with the "Myc IIIC phenomenon" and has no western associ ations beyond Cyprus. There is also a chronological difference: Stratum 9c at Tell Keisan belongs to the Phoenician Irlalb horizon, which is considerably later than the "Myc IllC-bearing" strata in Philistia. If labels are required, rather than being a Levanto Mycenaean group, it had best be characterized as (another...) Cypro-Phoenician one. Beyond that, however, the meaning and function of this group is difficult to interpret.29 This paper repeatedly argues that whenever a special decorative initiative is evi dent in the early Iron Age ceramic industry of Phoe nicia, it involves containers, usually containers that were employed in trade. The Tell Keisan vessels cer tainly fit this notion, and here too all the decorative configurations on these containers are confined to them alone. However, at present these vessels were not recognized with certainty outside Tell Keisan.30 The importance of the Cypriot-derived jug shapes at Tell Keisan is that they hint, again, at some very close familiarity of their producers with the Cypriot way of doing things. To date, no Cypriot jugs of these shapes are known from Phoenicia, which may have served as models for some local emulation. The Phoenician Bichrome Group and Related Wares. The most revealing Cypriot impact is that evident on other small containers in Phoenicia: flasks/ rounded jugs and strainer-spouted jugs, including the 27At Tyre, see Bikai 1978: fig. 93, upper right, and table 5; at Sarepta, see Anderson 1988: table 8, Heavy Rolled Rims of Types RR-1 and RR-2, which are apparently to be associated with such pithoi; table 21, heavy body sherds with plastic decoration; and table 16, B-17 (stump bases, also primarily associated with these pithoi). 28For the somewhat problematic stratigraphie association of these vessels, see Gilboa and Sharon 2003: 36-37. 29Most of these vessels were found in a pit (6067), and thus not much may be deduced from their context. 30According to Burdajewicz (1994: 77), some flasks of com parable appearance are known at Beth She'an; one possible such flask fragment was uncovered at Dor.</page><page sequence="16">62 AYELET GILBOA BASOR 337 well-known "Phoenician Bichrome" ones. The as sessment of the ancestry of the Bichrome vessels is especially crucial, as they were the major considera tion in Stern's reconstruction of a Phoenician take over of the SKL and SHRDN seats. However, at all the sites surveyed in this article, it can be shown that this group develops locally (Gilboa 1999a; Gilboa and Sharon 2003: fig. 17). Thus, by no means can these vessels be taken as a new, "northern" introduc tion into the cAkko Plain or Carmel coast from the "Phoenician heartland." The function of the decorations on these vessels has not changed. As before, these containers are the only vessels in Phoenicia that are systematically decorated?when the rest of the assemblages are even more poorly adorned than before. This shows that the sole purpose of this decoration was still a functional/economic one?to promote their distribu tion (or rather their contents). For a short period of time (within Irlb), the decoration on these containers exhibits a special energy input, an unparalleled phe nomenon in the Phoenician context. I termed this stage "experimental" (Gilboa 1999a: 2), as various methods of decoration are now employed, includ ing the "Phoenician Bichrome" style with its dis tinct decorative syntax?which in the later Iron Age will emerge as the standard, indeed almost exclusive method.31 In tandem, a new decorative vocabulary is introduced on both Monochrome and Bichrome con tainers, part of the designs being of clear Cypriot ancestry; and the very decorative syntax, especially the use of the enclosed-bands configuration, is also Cypriot-derived (Gilboa 1999a).32 This configura tion has long been considered by scholars the trade mark of Phoenician Bichrome vessels, which indeed was also its function in the past. None of these deco rative innovations are ever encountered on any other type of vessel in Phoenicia. Other Vessels of "Western" Derivation The "Northern SkyphoL" At Tell Keisan (Stra tum 9) and at Sarepta (Area II/Y, Stratum E), sky phoi continue to be present in this horizon, in 31Cf. Rathje's (1975: esp. 415-16) suggested production distribution trajectory?from a "research and development" stage to a "control mass replication and distribution" one. 32For some other examples of the enclosed-bands configura tion on Monochrome containers, see, for example, Gilboa and Sharon 2003: fig. 9:10, 11. significantly reduced quantities (see above). At Dor they are rare, and shortly afterward disappear. SUMMARY AND INTERPRETATION OF CERAMIC INDICES ALONG THE PHOENICIAN COAST VIS-?-VIS PHILISTIA The LBMr Transition and Irla As in many other regions in the Levant, the col lapse of the Late Bronze Age trade system seems to have terminated Phoenicia's commercial ties with most regions in the Mediterranean, including the Aegean.33 In Phoenicia, however, this did not bring overseas commercial activities to a halt, but it sub stantially transformed the scope of trade. Close com mercial contacts were maintained with Cyprus, and both of these regions were also involved in mari time commercial exchanges with Egypt. In this ho rizon, the Phoenician commercial containers are the main vessels to reveal definite Cypriot traits in their decoration, and clear Cypriot stylistic impact is at tested in Phoenicia in the local production of "Wavy Band pithoi" and in a few other ceramic shapes and decorative schemes. Concurrently, only a very small quantity of PhB vessels (most notably, containers) found their way to Phoenicia. This Phoenician-Cypriot-Egyptian triumvirate significantly excluded Philistia. No commercial links involving pottery can be traced between the exten sively excavated sites in Philistia and Cyprus at this stage, though such ties have been postulated on other grounds by some scholars and are referred to be low.34 Likewise, local production of Cypriot-style pithoi is unattested in Philistia, and imported pithoi are practically nonexistent there.35 33 Renascent contacts with Greece (Euboea), probably in the Irll2 horizon, are attested along the northern coast (Dor, Tyre, and Ras el-Bassit) and in Israel's northern valleys (Tel Hadar, Tel Rehov) (Gilboa and Sharon 2003: 68-72) but not in Philistia. 34 A possible exception to this statement is "Canaanite" jars in LC IIC-IIIA contexts at Maa-Palaeokastro, which, by fabric analysis, were suggested (with reservations) to originate in south ern Palestine (Jones and Vaughan 1988: 390). These authors ac knowledged the fact that comparative data from the southern Levant at their disposal were extremely scarce. It thus seems that their conclusions must await further corroboration. 35 As are collared-rim jars. The question whether at this stage the Syrian coast too was part of this commercial sphere deserves a separate consideration (see, for example, Caubet 1992: 127,130; Mazzoni 2000: 34).</page><page sequence="17">2005 AN INTERPRETATION OF SIKILA (SKL) MATERIAL CULTURE 63 The second significant divergence between Philis tia and the regions north of the Yarkon River is the lack of the "local Myc IIIC"/PhB phenomena in the latter. No such phenomena can be associated with the postulated SKL and SHRDN domains. If one seeks "Sea People traits" along the northern coast other than pottery, the following picture emerges: at Tel Dor (only) the following items were found, which are indeed similar to finds in Philistia: incised scapulae, two bone handles of bimetallic knives, a lioness-shaped cup, and an anthropomorphic juglet resembling one found at Tell Qasile (Stern 2000b: 198-203). These were taken by Stern and others to exemplify the Sea People nature of the SKL inhabi tants of Dor. (For specific comments on all these items at Dor, see Sharon and Gilboa in press; some of them originate at Dor in contexts that are stratigraphically later than the big destruction, and thus are associ ated with Stern's "Phoenician" sequence and not the "Sikilian" one.) However, it is well established that Philistia's material culture in the Early Iron Age, in cluding that associated with ritual, was composed chiefly of objects of local, Canaanite derivation (see lately A. Mazar 2000). Thus, the fact that an item may be found in Philistia is definitely not synony mous with a conclusion that it embodies some alien introduction or practice. Some objects (such as the zoomorphic cup) may equally be explained by pre vailing local traditions, whereas others (such as the bimetallic knives) probably attest to trade, most prob ably with Cyprus, as suggested by S. Sherratt (1994; for bimetallic knives in Greece and Crete, see Hoff man 2000: 102-5 with references). The significance of these items can only be evaluated when viewed, for each and every region, in the framework of the local context (for Philistia, see n. 4). How, then, is this difference to be interpreted? Does this mean that the arrival of new populations can be traced only (roughly) south of the Yarkon River, excluding the postulated SKL and SHRDN domains? As attested by ample examples, both in the ar chaeological and anthropological literature, more often than not migrating peoples or individuals do not transfer all components of their material culture to their new homelands (e.g., references in Schwartz 1970: 183; contra, for example, Hill 1978: 246; Sher ratt 1998: 298), and sometimes they bring none at all. Cases in point are, for example, the Ngoni and Sotho movements into south-central Africa in the early 19th century ce. Though the two groups had quite a similar history of migration/settlement, the pattern of change in their new homelands was different. In the area settled by the Ngoni, a significant change was observed in settlement organization, but their tradi tional pottery was not introduced to the region. The Sotho, on the other hand, brought about a conspicu ous change in ceramics (Collett 1987). The selection, inter alia, depends on the symbolism that various as pects of material culture convey to its bearers (or the lack thereof).36 In Philistia (or at least in certain parts of it), the very fact that a new population in flux in the Early Iron Age is recognizable is chiefly due the "local Myc IIIC" pottery phenomenon ac companying their settlement but is corroborated to day by a variety of other material media. This simple fact demonstrates that pottery, comprising mostly tableware, played an important role in maintaining and advertising the newcomers' group identity, and in this case, ethnicity as well, conveying very spe cific and meaningful messages to its producers and to (most of?) its users and their surroundings. The pro duction of this pottery and its costly decoration must also have required a complex mechanism (ethno graphical observations indicate that the decoration of hand-painted pots amounts to 20 to 30 percent of the total time invested in their production; see, e.g., DeBoer 1991: 144 and references). The same symbolic intent and function should be read into the subsequent PhB pottery as well, though at this stage the identity negotiated by the pottery may have been quite different from that of the "local Myc IIIC" (for an elaboration on all these issues, see Gilboa, Cohen-Weinberger, and Goren in press). These wares were not part of the symbolic expressions along the Levantine coastal stretch north of the Yarkon River. Moreover, regarding PhB, so cial dialectics seem to have instigated a purposeful rejection. But here is where we must consider the "northern skyphoi." As a phenomenon these crude, mostly lo cally produced drinking vessels, surely of "western" stylistic derivation, cannot be explained away as trade items or as a replacement of a no-longer-avail able imported commodity. It is also hard to perceive 36 Additional instances of selective transference of material culture traits during migrations are surveyed in Burmeister 2000. Cf. Yasur-Landau (2002: 33), who suggested that only a change in several behavioral patterns can be considered evidence for migra tion. For the difference in stylistic behavior between migrating in dividuals and small groups and mass migrations, see also Roe 1995: 51.</page><page sequence="18">64 AYELET GILBOA BASOR 337 them as some sudden emulation of overseas custom. They embody the introduction of (feasting?) habits and their associated paraphernalia, which were not there before. It seems very likely that the (few) "imported Myc IIIC" and PhB skyphoi found in early Iron Age Phoenicia, like those of cAkko, were meant to satisfy the same habit.37 To my mind, then, these skyphoi provide a clear hint that some foreign population should also be sought north of the Phil istine coast.38 This interpretation is strengthened by the local "Wavy-Band pithoi" production and by the other manifestations of Cypriot concepts in the local pottery production. So, how should this difference?a variegated and abundant "western" ceramic repertoire south of the Yarkon, vs. skyphoi and a few other Cypriot-derived pots (revealing totally different modes of production) to its north?be understood? A schematic solution? and, moreover, one that complies with the prevail ing concept regarding the Sea People?would be to state that indeed this difference stems from the dif ferent origin/ethnicity of the various Sea People con tingents. That is, the introduction of local Myc IIIC and later PhB (alongside other new material compo nents evident in the south) is indeed to be equated with the Philistines alone, while the ceramic input of the SHRDN and SKL was different, comprising crude skyphoi, "Wavy-Band pithoi," and some other Cypriot-derived decorative patterns recognizable on some flasks, jars, and occasionally other pots. Such an approach, however, would miss the point entirely, because it has no explanatory potential (why, then, after all, are the ceramic assemblages of all these "in vaders" so different in their composition?) and be cause it does not address the crucial issue: what were the functions of all these "special" groups of pottery. The answer may be sought in the number of the people involved and, even more so, in the social and economic matrix into which they were absorbed. The differences in the extent and selection of foreign material media that migrants elect to reproduce in their new surroundings is dictated by the sort of so cial discourse they choose to implement, either vis 37 And, as attested at Sarepta, it is quite plausible that the sky phoi phenomenon already starts, at least in some places, at the close of the Late Bronze Age. 38 Space does not permit me to deal with other possible regions in the Levant in which similar "skyphoi phenomena" may be traced. One such region is Syria?for example, at Tell Afis and the Amuq sites (see Bonatz 1998; Pedrazzi 2002, esp. 35-36 and ref erences, fig. 23). ?-vis their surroundings or among themselves (or, oftentimes, both). If indeed one accepts that the disintegration of the Late Bronze Age systems involved, inter alia, population movements, surely of various composi tions and scales and driven by diverse motivations, the following nuances may be traced along the Levantine coastal stretch surveyed in this paper: On the southern part of the coast ("Philistia"), the popu lation of newcomers was large enough to transplant at least part of its ceramic habits in the new sur roundings, establish the suitable production appara tus, and maintain such a production for about two centuries. But perhaps quantities are not the crucial factor here, and more emphasis should be put on sta tus?social and perhaps political. Several scholars have suggested that the newcomers to Philistia quite rapidly achieved high status and formed at least part of the region's elite (A. Mazar 1985b: 106; Bunimo vitz 1990: 212; Stone 1995: 7, among others). The bold assertion of their foreignness, exemplified to date mainly by their conspicuously foreign-looking pottery, provides important corroboration to these notions. This situation in Philistia must be investi gated in the context of the disintegration of the Egyp tian political, social, and economic framework in the early to mid-12th century b.c.e., probably affecting chiefly the elites of southern Canaan (Sharon 2001: 600-601; Gilboa, Cohen-Weinberger, and Goren in press).39 In contrast, the newcomers on the northern part of the coast seem to have faced a more stable social realia, and possibly were less numerous. Whether we are dealing here with just families or some larger lineal or other social groups?perhaps people of very specific trades, like the pitharades?cannot yet be determined. These people never established the sort of production evidenced in Philistia. There may have been many reasons. Perhaps being a smaller fragment of the population and not of elevated status, conspic uous foreign practices may have been deemed in advisable or maladaptive; or perhaps the production mechanism was too complex, or there were just not enough potters among them skilled to the task. Ce ramically, then, they were satisfied mainly with the production of (usually quite crude) drinking vessels, in less specialized production modes, and also ac 39On social aspects of Canaanites under Egyptian rule, de duced from the archaeological evidence, see lately Higginbotham 2000; Steel 2002.</page><page sequence="19">2005 AN INTERPRETATION OF SlKILA (SKL) MATERIAL CULTURE 65 quired some in neighboring regions and overseas. A very restricted production of other traditional vessels, chiefly containers, is also attested. Especially note worthy is the association, embodied on the flasks and on some jars, between Cypriot decorative vocabulary and commercial containers. This association is even more evocative in the later early Iron Age. This scenario does not explain the different fates of the coastal areas roughly north and south of the Yarkon. Above, a suggestion was offered that the so cial factors resulting from Egypt's withdrawal may prove instrumental in explaining these phenomena. Likewise, another phenomenon that needs to be ac counted for is the significant growth of the town at Dor, starting, on present evidence, in the early Irla horizon.40 As regards the place of origin of the newcomers to the northern coast, it seems that it should not be sought farther away than Cyprus, where, during late LC IIIA and LC IIIB, the well-documented disar ticulation of the Bronze Age social and demo graphic fabric probably also resulted in emigrations to the nearby thriving coast. In this context, it seems reasonable to trace the "skyphoi phenomenon" to Cyprus.41 The Irla\b Transition and Irlb In all the regions discussed here, no transforma tion of the ceramic culture is evident. As in the ear lier Irla horizons, both the Carmel coast and the cAkko Plain cluster with regions to their north and east, the Lebanese coast and Israel's northern valleys (see, for example, the comparative tables in Gilboa and Sharon 2003). In Philistia, for example at Tell Qasile X,42 a significant change in the method of decoration now occurs?red slip and burnish, often 40It would be a mistake, however, to attribute uncritically any urban growth along the Early Iron Age Canaanite coast to the Sea Peoples' "urban imposition" (a term coined by L. Stager [1995: 346]). Such a significant growth has indeed been demonstrated for Tell Miqne-cEkron and possibly Ashkelon (and not for Ashdod), but is manifested, for example, also in Beirut. 41 Another possible place of origin to which we should address our attention in this context is coastal Syria. If indeed it turns out that the late 13th/early 12th century b.c.e disruptions in this re gion were as detrimental as seems the case on present evidence, and that significant revival is not attested until Iron Age II, this would have far-reaching implications for other parts of the eastern Mediterranean coast, especially Phoenicia. 42 And somewhat earlier: see A. Mazar 1998 contra Holladay 1990. further elaborated by the addition of black paint, be comes the preferred method of decoration, gradually replacing the traditional PhB designs (for example, A. Mazar 1985a: tables 6-7 on p. 86). But though methods of decoration changed, their functions did not. Tablewares, including many open shapes, were the main medium on which this new decoration was employed?as it was in the earlier "Myc IIIC" and PhB phases (for the meanings of this change, accul turation as opposed to assimilation, see Stone 1995). Nothing like this happens in Phoenicia (the Car mel coast and cAkko Plain included), perhaps con trary to mistaken impressions that the origin of red slip is to be associated with Phoenicia. There, red slip in general, and especially on open shapes, re mains a rarity until Iron Age IIA (and even then is much less common than in other regions),43 and most tablewares are still considered as undeserving of dec oration. As before, whenever a decorative input is attested on pottery, it has a different function and in tent. In Phoenicia, then, significant change regarding ceramic production and decoration involves only the gradual elaboration of commercial containers?for which an economic explanation must be offered. As in the Irla horizon, but more compellingly now, a link is embodied in the Phoenician context among commercial enterprise, trade relations with Cyprus, and Cypriot decorative concepts. This indicates some measure of involvement by Cypriots, residing on the Phoenician coast, in these commercial endeavors and in at least part of their infrastructure. This contact is further corroborated by the occurrence of Cypriot tablewares at Tyre and Dor. Phoenician exports to Cyprus continue to follow the same pattern as before?involving only jars and small containers?but they are now much better at tested. Whether this reflects an intensification of exports or is the result of our better acquaintance with early CG I assemblages (especially at Skales), as opposed to LC IIIB ones, is difficult to tell. This, then, is the economic process for which the term "Cypro-Phoenician" is appropriate. A glimpse at the later fortunes of the Phoenician Bichrome style is also instructive here. The situation whereby this decorative scheme is employed solely on containers is about to change. Gradually, in the Irll2 and Ir2a horizons and much more so later on, the "Phoenician Bichrome syntax" spread to other 43For Sarepta, for example, see Anderson 1988: 393, tables 21, 37; for Tyre, see Bikai 1978; table 1 on p. 19.</page><page sequence="20">66 AYELET GILBOA BASOR 337 vessels, which were definitely not commercial con tainers, and in the late Iron Age it became prolific on funerary containers in Phoenicia and Phoenician communities overseas (see Gilboa 1999a). In these later stages, then, the "Phoenician commercial trade mark" assumed additional functions and symbolic meanings, to use familiar Binfordian terms?it spread from the technomic realm to the sociotechnic. The commercial activities embodied by the Bichrome containers now became part of an asserted con sciousness or identity.44 A possible explanation for this phenomenon is that those individuals (Cypriots on the Phoenician coast)?who, on the one hand, did not form part of its traditional economic composition and, on the other, originated in a milieu with a well-established tradition of non-institutionalized overseas ventures, dating back to the Late Bronze Age (Sherratt 1994: 67; Artzy 1997)?were economically more flexible, were certainly more aware of regional opportunities, and possibly did not have that much choice. As a parallel situation one may cite F. Hole's ob servations regarding the socioeconomic structure in Deh Luran, Iran, in the 20th century c.e. There, new comers explore avenues of subsistence other than the prevailing traditional one?agriculture, as they do not own land?and gradually are becoming econom ically powerful. His suggestions are worth quoting, as they almost seem to describe the processes dis cernible in Early Iron Age Phoenicia: "I would argue that the motivation for some entrepreneurial activity thus lies in the scarcity of landed resources, which forces some persons out of the traditional livelihood, and in political situations which introduce 'outsiders' into a system in which they have no traditional rights . . . entrepreneurial activity (which may eventually develop wide ramifications) is an effective solution to the dilemma of survival" (Hole 1974: 153).45 SYNTHESIS When all is said, ceramics suggest the existence of two different cultural patterns, roughly south and ^Concurrently, Cypriot tablewares continue to be prolific at Dor and at Tyre (Gilboa 1999b: 123-26). 45 For similar observations concerning traditional communities in the Guatemalan highlands, see Reina and Hill 1978: 19. Like wise, Champion (1986) assigns entrepreneurial activity bringing social change in Iron Age Europe to elements from outside the local elites. north of the Yarkon River. In the south, in the 12th century b.c.e., a new population may be traced to whom the traditional, highly decorated tableware car ried a crucial symbolic significance, probably in main taining and expressing group identity and status?an emblemic style (e.g., Wiessner 1990: 107-8). This is the so-called local Myc IIIIC or Philistine Mono chrome ware, which later undergoes various permu tations. In the north, Cypriots (and possibly refugees from the Syrian coast?), possibly less numerous and surely of less elevated social status, are in evidence starting in the 12th century, but mainly from the 11th century and later. In contrast to the south, this appar ently was not a unidirectional flow, but the situation in Cyprus is not discussed here. Nearly all the early Iron Age decorated groups in Phoenicia are stylisti cally linked one way or the other with Cyprus, but in total contrast to the south, the motivation for adorn ing them was economic/commercial. In the early Iron Age, hardly any pottery of emblemic properties, comparable with that in Philistia, is in evidence in the north. Crudely put, as regards ceramic ornamen tation, the people in the south invested in group iden tity and prestige, and the northerners, in business. Scholars who recognize that the Late Bronze/ early Iron Age upheavals around the Mediterranean involved significant population dislocations must con sider the complexity of this process. For one thing, it was certainly a lengthier process than is usually en visioned (perhaps more in keeping with D. Anthony's "chain migration" model [1997: 26-27]). But above all, regarding the southern Levantine littoral, the "three bridgeheads" model?the notion of Philis tines, SKL, and SHRDN as discrete ethnic groups, each settling on a discrete part of the coast, implying per force some wondrous coordination of the Sea Peoples' Joint Chiefs of Staff?must be abandoned (see similarly Liverani 1995: 50).46 The Canaanite coast (and very likely not only the coast) witnessed the arrival of various populations, of various scopes, from various regions, for a plethora of reasons and goals, which surely intermingled (similarly Brug 1985: 201-5; Artzy 1997; 1998; Barako 2000: 526; Sharon 2001: 601). The likely origin of the newcom ers at Dor and at other regions in the north is Cyprus; but very plausibly, at least part of the new population in Philistia was of the very same stock (contra, for 46For a totally opposite view, see lately D. O'Connor 2000: e.g., 97, 99. He also suggests that the leader of the Sea People con federation may be identified in the Medinet Habu reliefs.</page><page sequence="21">2005 AN INTERPRETATION OF SIKILA (SKL) MATERIAL CULTURE 67 example, Redford's [1992: 292 and n. 39] "ethnic bifurcation" between Philistia and the north). The Philistine vs. SXL/Phoenician dichotomy as outlined here, though certainly instrumental as a heuristic construct, is surely also a crude oversimpli fication of an infinitely more complex realia. But it probably brings us somewhat closer to elucidating how it actually was. As has been lately done regard ing the crystallizations of other Iron Age entities in this region, it would be beneficial if we pay more attention to their specific, local contexts. Regarding the Carmel coast and cAkko Plain, I would thus reject the model suggested by Stern of "Phoenicians conquering Sea Peoples," and also the concomitant reconstruction of Phoenician military conquests as the mechanism underlying early Iron Age Phoenician commercial ventures, as advocated by Aubet. "Sea People" and Phoenicians at Dor and at other "northern" sites cannot be ethnically segre gated. These designations, at most, may be used to define different stages in the social and economic milieu and concomitant group awareness of the in habitants of the northern coast. In addition to the local Canaanites, Cypriots residing on the Phoeni cian coast formed an important component in this context, as did continuous and multifaceted contacts with Cyprus. So what did the Egyptians have in mind when they wrote SKL? Based on the preceding analysis, it seems that they were referring to the mixed, but largely autochthonous population of the Phoenician coast.47 This, of course, poses a problem for the gen eral "foreign" association offered for this term in the Egyptian records.48 But an investigation of the Egyp tian records is definitely not the issue here. Rather, the archaeological analysis should be taken into con 47 An equation has been suggested between the SKL and the Late Bronze Age Sikalay? of Ugarit (RS 34.129). They are de scribed there as living on boats but, by the determinative accom panying their name, were possibly associated with a specific territory (Dietrich and Loretz 1978; G. A. Lehmann 1979; Rainey 1982: 134; Drews 1993: 52, n. 13; Hoftijzer and Van Soldt 1998: 343). There is another, even earlier possible occurrence of this ethnicon in the Late Bronze Age. Tkr, possibly to be identified with SKL, were listed by Thutmosis III at Karnak (Gardiner 1947: 200*; see Scheepers 1991: 72 and nn. 392-94; Vandersleyen 1985: 52 and references). 48Associated with Teucrians and the Troad, Sagalessos, the Homeric Sikeloi and Sicily, Zakro in Crete (and more), e.g., Scheepers 1991: 72 and n. 358. For the SHRDN, mentioned in the Levant in the Late Bronze Age much more than in the Iron Age, see, e.g., Loretz 1995 and Appendix there by J. Kahl. sideration when conducting such an inquiry, Regard ing the SKL, a "local coastal" character for them has been suggested, for example, by H. Goedicke, who concluded that the term SKL was a geographical one, i.e., designating "people within a country specified," referring "[not to a] migratory people, but rather to an established defined political realm" (Goedicke 1975: 176, also 180,184, n. 4), and also, based on the Wenamun papyrus, that "Zeker [SKL] as a geograph ical term refers to the area dominated by the merchant cities and should be taken as a self-designation of what later became denoted as Phoenicia (Goedicke 1975: 182-83; similarly Bikai 1992: 135-36; Drews 1993: 53).49 ALTERNATIVE SUGGESTIONS: "SEA PEOPLE" CERAMICS AS AN ECONOMIC PHENOMENON AND PHILISTINE MARITIME DOMINANCE? The main alternative explanation suggested thus far for the appearance of "Aegean/Cypriot-derived" ceramics on the coast of the southern Levant must now be considered. In a series of papers, Susan Sher ratt (1998; also 2003; A. Sherratt and S. Sherratt 1991 ; S. Sherratt and A. Sherratt 1993) promoted a model of the Sea People as a structural, socioeconomic phe nomenon (that may also have been accompanied by population movements, but not necessarily so). This well-articulated and extremely elegant formulation, which furthermore is very much in keeping with still prevailing anti-diffusionist attitudes, has proved very influential (for example, Bauer 1998; Dessel 2000): Second-millennium overseas trade, which was largely a state-administered, elite-controlled business, was engaged mainly with prime value commodities, and with added-value ("prestige") products, such as metal objects and textiles. In the "interstices" (Sherratt's term) of this highly organized and tightly controlled system, enterprises of a different sort emerged: trans actions of a "private" nature, carried out by the offi cial state merchants, seamen, and the like, leading to the growth of an independent class of trades men. The products involved in this sort of trade were chiefly non-elite in nature, primarily ones whose main 49For other denials of "western" associations of the SKL, see Scheepers 1991: 73, nn. 403-8. But similar suggestions were ex pressed, of course, regarding other "Sea Peojples" as well?for example, Brug 1985: 20.</page><page sequence="22">68 AYELET GILBOA BASOR 337 worth was added value (such as attractive pottery), the circulation of which was not controlled by the elites/authorities. As the raw materials for these goods are available over extensive regions, they are dangerously imitation-prone. Concomitantly, a mar ket for sub-elite commodities emerged and was ac tively maintained by these traders. Inter alia, mass produced pottery of both traditional and Aegean shapes, especially in the coastal urban centers of Cy prus, was intended to keep the mechanism going; it was marketed far and wide, and gradually, along with other industries (such as utilitarian iron), became the basis for the economic and political powers of these coastal centers. The mass-produced "Aegean" pot tery, and other facets of these new production modes, are the symptoms conventionally taken as evidence of a western imposition on the island?the "Sea Peo ple phenomenon." In the 12th century, the coastal urban centers of the southern Levant (". . . of the Philistine strip, of the area around the Bay of Acco, and of the coast at least as far up as Ras Ibn Hani" [Sherratt 1998: 302]) are envisioned as part of the same industrial and economic process, i.e., produc ing Aegean-type pottery (according to Sherratt, a Cypriot version of it) as an import substitution and not as some expression of group affiliation. Thus the arrival at the shores of the southern Levant of a new population in any substantial numbers, accord ing to Sherratt, is an illusion, as it is on Cyprus.50 According to Sherratt, this political and economic structure is the one that, in the Iron Age, we came to define as Phoenician. Based on this model, Bauer (1998: 162), emphasizing the "strong Sea People link of Tell Abu Hawam, Tell Keisan, and Dor," wrote: "If we consider that the Phoenicians emerge as maritime traders in the eleventh century, and the 'Sea Peoples/ Philistines' are the same in the twelfth century? taken together with the archaeological evidence that some of the earliest examples of Phoenician or 50Similarly, Brug (e.g., 1985: 135) explains the Aegean derived pottery in Philistia as "a result of the creative recombina tion of various ceramic ideas available to them by a potter or group of potters ..." an industry of luxury ware, intended to re place the luxurious imported Mycenaean pottery that was no longer available (likewise Bunimovitz 1990: 212-13). Implicitly, this is also the main line of thought dictating I. Finkelstein's "low chronology" for both Myc IIIC and Philistine Bichrome (e.g., Finkelstein 1998). If all contemporaneous inhabitants of the re gion are expected to have used this pottery, the concomitant con clusion is that Iron Age I levels that lack them must predate both these pottery groups. Cypro-Phoenician pottery appear at sites that are either 'Philistine' or related to 'Sea Peoples'?we may reasonably conclude that they are both function ing within the same structure of interconnections." Regarding the situation on the eastern shore of the Mediterranean, I would take issue with Sherratt's suggestions, on three major points: (1) It treats the entire coast as one entity, with not enough resolution to detect subphenomena within it;51 (2) it does not pay enough attention to quantitative aspects; and (3) it is, to my taste, too materialistic; symbolic mean ing, which always mediates between objects, their producers and users, is ignored.52 As must be evident from the foregoing discussion, the "western pottery phenomenon" along the Levan tine coast is not a monolithic one, and for a very long stretch of it, from the environs of the coast of the Sharon to Ras Ibn Hani, the "Sea People pottery phe nomenon," as defined by Sherratt, is practically non existent. This fact alone suffices to undermine her reconstruction. If indeed "local Myc IIIC" and en suing PhB were manufactured locally as import substitutes, purchased by any Canaanite who could afford to do so (Drews 1998: 45), why are they miss ing (in any meaningful quantities) from thriving early Iron Age centers such as Dor, Tell Abu Hawam, Tell Keisan, Tyre, and Sarepta, and for that matter, in any meaningful extent, from inland sites such as Megiddo, Kinneret, and many more (similarly Ba rako 2000: 524)? Residents at these sites indeed consumed both Cypriot and "Mycenaean" pottery in the Late Bronze Age (cf. Barako 2000: fig. 2). Was the need for a substitute, once the imports were no longer available or cheaper and more accessible "imi tations" were circulating nearby, not felt in these towns? Also, the association suggested by Sherratt, be tween the "western-style ceramic phenomenon" and Phoenician mercantile activities as parts of a con tinuum of an economic (primarily mercantile) and political transformation, must be modified. The two, geographically, simply do not overlap. As far as may be deduced from present data, Philistia's overseas 51 Indeed, in a forthcoming paper, Sherratt (personal commu nication) emphasizes the fact that the "big picture" she outlined will have to be broken down into localized phenomena, dependent on differing economic and sociopolitical circumstances. 52For a consideration of symbolic factors in Mediterranean trade of these periods, see, for example, Melas 1991: 389, 393, 395.</page><page sequence="23">2005 AN INTERPRETATION OF SIKILA (SKL) MATERIAL CULTURE 69 commercial contacts throughout the early Iron Age are extremely scant, even with Cyprus; no LC IIIA ceramics have been identified there (but possibly [surely few] such instances were obscured by the large "Aegeanized" local assemblages), and only very few LC IIIB and Cypro-Geometric pots account for later commercial contacts (see Gilboa 1989; 1999b: 120-23). Philistine products overseas are unattested, with the possible exception of the LC IIC-IIIA "Ca naanite" jars at Maa (see n. 34);53 and none are known from the later early Iron Age (see also Barako 2000: 516). (For other critiques of Sherratt's model, see mainly Barako 2000; also Sharon 2001: 593-94; T. Dothan and Zukerman 2003: 51, n. 46.) Even within the Levant, the Philistine "Myc IIIC" hardly left the sites in which it was produced. In fact, as has been demonstrated in this paper, these two phe nomena?the "Sea People pottery phenomenon" (or rather, the Philistine version thereof) on the one hand and clear evidence for maritime commercial enterprise in the early Iron Age on the other?are practically mutually exclusive. As an explanation for the occurrence of "Philistine" pottery groups on the Levantine coast, Sherratt's suggestions cannot be upheld. Likewise, it is time to deconstruct another concept. Notions of extensive Philistine maritime activity (in cluding piracy)?to the point of envisioning a Philis tine maritime empire or thalassocracy in the early Iron Age, until their defeat ca. 975 by an Israelite-Tyrian coalition?are still widespread, having first explicitly been formulated by Albright (e.g., 1975: 515, 525). Aubet (1993: 21, 25, 26) asserted that "the Philistine fleet blockaded the main ports and reduced the possi bility of an immediate naval and mercantile recovery between 1050 and 975 b.c.e. ... Between the years 1050 and 975 b.c.e. the Philistines and other groups of pirates issuing from the incursions of the so-called 'Sea Peoples,' controlled all the coast between Gaza in the south and the territory of Mount Carmel and Tyre in the north, from time to time hampering ship ping as far as Sidon itself.... In Wen Amun's account the Phoenician coast appears to be dominated by the Tjekker pirates" (similarly Stager 1995: 345). These convictions are mostly deduced from the maritime power of the SKL (the Philistines' "kins 53S. Sherratt (1998: 305) suggests that textiles may have been exchanged between Cyprus and Philistia and also views the bime tallic knives primarily as objects of trade. people")?as manifested in the Wenamun report.54 As in my mind, the Dor-based maritime activities of the SKL embody the "Phoenician" realia and have nothing to do with Philistia; and in light of the ar chaeological evidence presented here, I propose to reject these views. It would certainly be simplistic (and wrong) to claim that no "Philistine" vessel left the shore, say, of Ashkelon in a westerly (or any other) destination,55 but to date there is clear evidence for a Phoenician maritime phenomenon; regarding Philis tia, evidence for a comparable phenomenon has yet to be presented, not to mention a Philistine maritime empire hampering Phoenicia's (and others') overseas ventures.56 CONCLUDING REMARKS To a certain extent, then, parts of the model of fered by Sherratt are indeed convincing. While this paper rejected the model as an explanation for the "Sea People ceramic phenomenon" in Philistia, and also the notion that any substantive overseas enter prises can be attributed at present to that region in the early Iron Age, Sherratt's suggestions are defi nitely compatible with the more northerly parts of the Canaanite coast. There, newcomers, chiefly from Cyprus, had a decisive role in early Iron Age mer cantile activity. The suggestion that this period also witnessed a gradual transition from largely adminis tered to largely entrepreneurial trade (above and, e.g., A. Sherratt and S. Sherratt 1991: 376; also Artzy 1998: 445) may also be applicable, if only for part of the Levantine coast (the "Phoenician" part of it), but definitely begs for further research. The need to promote the marketing of Phoenician containers, 54Cf. Markoe 2000: 25; Knauf 2001: 15, n. 4. On the other hand, Dothan and Dothan (1992: 125) expressed their second thoughts regarding the maritime character of the Philistines. 55 In addition to the few possible attestations of artifacts ex changed between Cyprus and Philistia, whether directly or indi rectly, direct contacts (but not commercial ones) are attested by parallel stylistic developments of the "Myc IIIC" assemblages (S. Sherratt 2003: 46; T. Dothan and Zukerman 2004). Philistine iconography includes two known examples of ships (on pottery; Wachsmann 2000: fig. 6.29; T. Dothan and Zukerman 2004: fig. 35:10). 56For some scholars, the idea that Phoenician maritime activ ity was dormant until its "delivery" from Philistine rule of the seas by David, formed the very basis of dating the beginning of Phoe nician long-range mercantile activity (e.g., Aubet 1993: 170-72; Markoe 2000: 35; other scholars are cited in Ehrlich 1996: 34, n. 64).</page><page sequence="24">70 AYELET GILBOA BASOR 337 evidenced by the outstanding effort invested in their embellishment and unattested on any other compo nent of the early Phoenician ceramic complex, may indeed hint at such a transition. Philistia was ex cluded from this complex and ongoing formation of economic bonds with Cyprus. The various groups of Philistine pottery are part of a related, but signifi cantly different story. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS I wish to express my gratitude to Ephraim Stern, the di rector of the last two decades of excavations at Dor and the instructor of my Ph.D. dissertation, in the framework of which many of the ideas expressed here were formulated; and to Ilan Sharon, my codirector at the Tel Dor excava tions, for continuous support and numerous insights. This research has been funded by two grants of the Israel Sci ence Foundation of the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities: no. 812/97 awarded to Sharon and myself; and no. 778/00 awarded to Sharon, Elisabetta Boaretto, head of the 14C laboratory at Weizmann Institute, and my self; and by a doctoral grant from the Memorial Founda tion of Jewish Culture in New York. Amihai Mazar and Susan Sherratt kindly sent me drafts of unpublished pa pers, Maria Eugenia Aubet discussed with me aspects of Phoenician expansion, and Marius Burdajewicz allowed me to use data from his unpublished Ph.D. dissertation on Tell Keisan. Svetlana Matskevitch and Talia Goldman from the Hebrew University took care of the graphics. The Tel Dor pottery was drawn by Vered Rosen.
