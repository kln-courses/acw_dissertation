<plain_text><page sequence="1">Lessons and Limits of Anglicanism: Forty Years after Philadelphia Carter Heyward INTRODUCTION F* rom its earliest days, Anglican Christians have prided ourselves on the comprehensiveness of our faith-tradition. From Richard Hooker in the seventeenth century, F. D. Maurice in the nine- teenth century, and any number of articulate Anglican and Epis- copal divines in the twentieth and early twenty-first centuries, we have enjoyed a breadth of perspective on our central doctrines of God, Christ, and church. Each of these theological base-points has been interpreted by most Anglican/Episcopal theologians to in- clude everyone in the world who wishes to be included in a broad-sweeping vision of God's love, Christ's realm, and the worldwide Anglican Communion that names itself a member of the "one, holy, catholic, and apostolic church." For most Anglicans, for example, there is no formula for being saved. No one has to publicly or privately confess "Jesus Christ as personal Lord and Savior." There is an assumption among all but the most biblically evangelical and fundamentalist Anglicans that all humankind has been redeemed, or saved, by Jesus Christ. Like other Christians, of course, many Anglicans debate just how our redemption was, or is, brought about through the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus. Regardless, however, our baptismal, confir- mation, and ordination vows affirm a shared view of God, and God's realm, as a free and glorious gift to all humankind, without requirement or qualification for membership. Our responsibili- ties as Ajiglicans include a promise to serve "Christ in all persons, Carter Heyward was one of the Philadelphia 11, and is professor emeri ta of theology at Episcopal Divinity School in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

The context for our shared ministries to the poor is God's love for all people, every one, and God's desire that no one be left out or disregarded; hence, our responsibility to minister to our neigh- bors, "Christ in all persons." Our Christian call is to embody God's love for our neighbors, regardless of their religious affiliation. Muslims, Buddhists, Jews, pagans, all people (including atheists, despite their protest to the contrary) are as deeply precious as Christians to the God in whom Anglican Christians say we believe. For the women ordained to the priesthood in Philadelphia (1974) and Washington (1975) 1 and for those who came along soon after the ordination of women was authorized by the 1976 General Convention, our vocations as priests were laboratories for participation in the spirit of Anglicanism's comprehensiveness. No doubt any historical period would be an excellent teacher of im- portant lessons, but the last quarter of the twentieth century and its turbulent turn into the twenty-first century have provided ex- ceptional opportunities for all religious leaders - including Epis- copal women priests - to try to respond faithfully and intelligently to groups of people throughout the world, including the United States, demanding basic human rights. If Anglicanism's compre- hensiveness has historically signaled our faith-tradition's reach to- ward, rather than away from, all humanity and indeed the whole creation, then these last decades have surely offered critical lessons in what it means to be an Anglican Christian, or a "good Episco- palian," in today's confounding world. LESSON ONE: HOLDING PASTORAL AND PROPHETIC TOGETHER One of the first lessons from Philadelphia and its aftermath was that our ministries had to grow beyond what many may have imag- ined priesthood would involve - primarily liturgical matters inter- nal to the church, which is what all the controversy over the ordination of women had been about, at least on the surface. 1 Decades after the 1948 ordination in Hong Kong of Le Tim Oi, and three years after the ordinations of Jane Hwang and Joyce Bennett, also in Hong Kong.</page><page sequence="3">148 ANGLICAN AND EPISCOPAL HISTORY It was clear to the early women priests that our vocations could not be "contained" by traditional ecclesiastical expectations of what priests do: celebrate the Eucharist, bless and absolve people, and obey our bishops. The latter expectation, some would ob- serve, had been laid to rest by the very act of our having been ordained priests against our bishops' requests. In any case, alongside our sister and brother Christians and other religious leaders, women ordained priests in Philadelphia and Washington would find ourselves having to wrestle with social and political forces swirling around us that we would not have cho- sen had we been the authors of history. At the time of the "irreg- ular" ordinations, the political drift in the larger society was to the Right, away from women's rights, away from worker's rights, and toward the embrace of de-regulation and an interpretation of cap- italism as "free" and "unfettered," best left on its own, without government interference. Indeed, six years after the Philadelphia ordinations, Ronald Reagan was elected president of the United States, an event in American history that signaled a seismic shift in our collective, national understanding of wealth and poverty. Fem- inist social ethicist Beverly Wildung Harrison would name the "cap italist spirituality" of this period.2 Feminist liberation theologian Dorothee Soelle would brand these times as "christofascist."3 The 2 Prior to her death in 2012, Christian social ethicist Beverly W. Harrison had been hoping to write a book on "capitalist spirituality," by which she meant the collusion of advanced global capitalism's emphasis on profit for individuals (persons, families, and corporations) and mainstream white middle and upper class Christianity's promotion of private spiritual journeying over the struggles for social justice as the heart of Christianity. During her retirement, Harrison discussed this often with me and with her former graduate students and col- leagues. See Beverly W. Harrison, Justice in the Making : Feminist Social Ethics , ed. Elizabeth M. Bounds et al. (Louisville, 2004). I first heard German political theologian Dorothee Soelle use the term "christofascist" in conversation with me at Union Theological Seminary during the early years of the Reagan Administration, to which she was referring. I have not met the term in her writings, though she used it frequently in her political speeches. She and Beverly Harrison agreed that christofascism and capitalist spirituality were closely connected and profoundly destructive social, economic, psychological, and spiritual energies. Dorothee Soelle's last work, prior to her death in 2003, was The Silent Cry : Mysticism and Resistance, trans. Barbara and Martin Rumscheidt (Minneapolis, 2001); originally published as Mystik und Widerstand: "Du stilles Geschrei " (Hamburg, 1997).</page><page sequence="4">LESSONS AND LIMITS 149 widening gap between rich and poor would become emblematic of the Reagan presidency in the 1980s and would become his chief legacy, one that lives on thirty years later.4 Reagan is frequently cited favorably today by those who believe that capitalism and wealth should be allowed to keep on growing without the burden of government oversight. As the rich get richer, according to this logic, wealth will automatically "trickle down" to the poor and help lift them up. The problem is, this is not the way it works. As a matter of historical fact, while the rich get richer, the poor get poorer.5 But under "Reaganomics," as well as Reagan's fervently anti-Communist foreign policy, the gulf between rich and poor widened as did the divide between capi- talist and communist centers of power and activity around the world. This contentious divisiveness set the social context for the ministries of the early waves of women priests in the Episcopal Church, from the mid 1970s through the late 1980s. In those days, most priests, regardless of gender, would find ourselves caught between on the one hand those forces in the church, like bishops and supervisors, who were urging us away from contro- versy so that we could be effective pastors to rich and poor alike and, on the other, opportunities to stand with the poor wherever we might encounter them, at home on city streets and in shelters, or abroad in places like Nicaragua and South Africa, where U.S. foreign policy was holding oppressive powers in place. Of course, the first generation of those who move into any line of work previously closed to them have to be precocious and smart in order to hang in there. Seldom are pioneers willing to simply fall in line and do what's always been done. It is neither their job nor their character. Looking back, there seems to me little ques- tion that the first couple of decades after the Philadelphia ordinations 4 Three books that spell out the widening economic disparities among us are Paul Krugman, The Conscience of a Liberal (New York, 2007); Robert Reich, Beyond Outrage: What Has Gone Wrong with our Economy and our Democracy and How to Fix It (New York, 2012); and Joseph E. Stiglitz, The Price of Inequality: How Today's Society Endangers our Future, (New York, 2012).

Given our experiences seek- ing justice for ourselves and other women - and involvement of- ten in civil rights, labor, and anti-Vietnam War movements - the early women priests were often fiercely committed to social justice as an important foundation, not simply a side-line, of our vocation. This was the case whether our daily ministries were based primarily in parishes, prisons, hospitals, schools and seminaries, or other organizations and communities. Although people seeking ordination are often warned by bishops and other counselors that we will have to be either primar- ily pastoral or prophetic in our ministries, and seldom both, we thought this "choice" was nonsense. The first women priests found ourselves praying with sick parishioners and fighting to abolish the death penalty; teaching kids about the Exodus and leading adult classes in Latin American Liberation Theology; preaching on the lectionary in Sunday worship and speaking at public rallies against the Reagan Administration's ongoing refusal to boycott South Africa's apartheid regime. While most of us un- doubtedly experienced some discomfort in the middle of such de- mands and had to figure out how to live as creatively as possible in these tensions, we saw no inherent contradiction between being pastorally attentive and prophetically outspoken, believing much of the time that these calls go hand in hand, each strengthening the other if done in a spirit of love and compassion. LESSON TWO: THE PERSISTENCE OF RACISM The Philadelphia ordinations had taken place in the Church of the Advocate in North Philadelphia, a historically black parish which had become more integrated under the leadership of Paul Washington, a pastoral and prophetic giant, equally adept at min- istries with Black Panthers and suburban housewives who wanted to make a difference in the struggles for racial, economic, and gen- derjustice. In the 1970s, when the relationship between the Union of Black Episcopalians (mostly men) and the Episcopal Women's Caucus (mostly white) was strained due to historic forces that pull</page><page sequence="6">LESSONS AND LIMITS 151 oppressed groups apart, and although all eleven of the first female ordinands were white, Washington had offered the Church of the Advocate as a parish in which the irregular ordinations could take place. Not only was Washington positioning himself at odds with a number of his black brothers and sisters, but also he was disobey- ing his bishop, who had forbidden such an ordination to take place. By opening the Church of the Advocate to the Philadelphia ordinations, Washington was putting his own job at risk. The roles of Washington and other African American Episcopalians in the story of the Philadelphia ordinations prefigured the dynamics of race and racism that, from the outset, would shape, and sharpen, the ministries of women priests and other religious leaders in the world unfolding around us. By the early 1980s, African American women, through such art- ists and activists outside the church as Audre Lorde and Alice Walker, and such spiritual leaders inside the Episcopal Church as Verna Dozier, Pauli Murray, and Barbara C. Harris, had begun to be heard and taken seriously by large numbers of white Epis- copalians, especially women. The first women priests were no ex- ceptions. We were deeply aware of our connectedness with the civil rights struggle, both in the decade prior to our ordination and through the various participants in our ordination. We were mind- ful not only of Paul Washington and many members of the Church of the Advocate who had been present at the ordination, some to help guard against violence. We were also grateful to Dr. Charles Willie, the eloquent preacher in the service who, one month later, had resigned his position as vice-president of the Episcopal House of Deputies to protest the House of Bishops' vote to declare the ordinations "invalid." And then there was Barbara Harris, the lay- woman who had been crucifer, carrying the cross at the front of the festive procession at the ordination. Harris had wanted to lead the procession down the streets and around the block, but had been advised against it for security reasons. Fifteen years later, she would become the first woman bishop in the Anglican Com- munion. In 1974 she was a gutsy, enthusiastic, black female lay leader of the Church of the Advocate who was leading a group of white sisters up the aisle to be ordained priests.</page><page sequence="7">152 ANGLICAN AND EPISCOPAL HISTORY Over the next decade, the first women priests would share an ethical and political responsibility to do everything we could to combat racism in the Episcopal Church, including the Episcopal Divinity School, where Sue Hiatt and I, and later Alison Cheek as well, were on the faculty. From the beginning of our time at Epis- copal Divinity School, Sue and I were adamant that the school move toward hiring, as full time faculty and administrators, people of color, especially women. After all, in 1975, the seminary's faculty numbered over twenty - three white women, one black man, and upwards of seventeen white men. It took a few years for the school to make such an effort, but when it did so, in the early 1980s, the Episcopal Divinity School became a leading edge of all, not just Episcopal, theological schools in implementing a liberation-based curriculum and institutional policies promoting race, gender, and sexual justice. In the early 1980s womanist scholar Katie Geneva Cannon came to EDS to teach Christian Ethics. Cannon would be followed by Anglican feminist and postcolonial theologian Kwok Pui-lan and a stream of other feminist/ womanist teachers, scholars, and pastors like Karen Montagno, Joan Martin, Renee Hill, and Gale Yee. In addition, the seminary benefited from the teaching and leadership of men like Byron Rushing, Ed Rodman, Christopher Duraisingh, Steven Charleston, and now, forty years later, Patrick Cheng, an outstanding leader in the queer theological movement of the early 2000s. These brothers have shared a commitment to the Feminist Liberation Theological program, which the seminary had initiated in the 1980s, and to its ongoing anti-racism work, which culminated in a vigorous, focused effort through VISIONS6 in the 1990s. At the dawn of the new millennium, there was no way to be a well-informed and faithful Episcopalian in the United States without some awareness that forces, usually somewhat camou- flaged, of white supremacy, male hegemony, and economic exploi- tation of the world's poorest were shaping us all, as citizens of the world's richest nation and members of one of the world's most 6 Founded in 1984, VISIONS, Inc., is an organization which works with in- dividual and organizations to overcome barriers to diversity and inclusion.</page><page sequence="8">LESSONS AND LIMITS 153 economically privileged Christian traditions. By the early 2000s, most women priests - now numbering in the thousands around the world - were deeply mindful of the injustices that threatened women's well-being: the prevalence of rape and domestic violence; limited access to reproductive options, including safe conditions for abortion; rampant poverty affecting vast populations, with women and children's health routinely deemed least important, and women having little, if any, voice in shaping public policy. Where women's lives were concerned, women priests tended to be interested and alert. I suspect this was true regardless of our own race and ethnicity. But white women priests, lacking the experience of having been victimized by racism, did not have an urgent or well-cultivated ca- pacity to see the extent to which women and men of color, in the Episcopal church and elsewhere, continued at the turn of the cen- tury to be targeted by "modern" racisms such as being judged as smart, worthy, talented, or right and good by different criteria from white people. If Anglicanism is a faith-tradition that reaches beyond its own historic boundaries to bring in new people and new ideas, there can be no good place in the church for racism. If we understand sin as a turning away from God and evil as its spin- off, our sin-based refusal to love one another, which often results in violence and abuse, then racism's place in the church is in our prayer of confession, for which we are absolved if, and only if, we are seriously contrite and try our best to "go and sin no more." Of course we do sin again and again, and so we are repeatedly in need of confession and of the renunciation of sin and evil that lets us experience grace through God's forgiveness, and one another's. LESSON THREE: AIDS AND SEXUALITY: SPEAKING THE UNSPEAKABLE In 1981 , while women priests were still something of a novelty in the American Episcopal Church and only a few other Anglican provinces like Canada and New Zealand, the HIV virus began to move stealthily among us. At first it seemed largely to be a "gay men's disease" in the United States and other parts of</page><page sequence="9">154 ANGLICAN AND EPISCOPAL HISTORY the Western world in which gay men lived, often openly, in gay- friendly cities such as San Francisco and New York. Within ten years, however, AIDS had become a major scourge among the gen- eral public, taking special insidious hold among the urban poor in the United States, where unprotected sex and needle exchanges among drug users was common. Not only had countless gay men died of this disease, but also it was moving, or surfacing, through- out the nation and world. In Africa, for example, men and women were succumbing by the thousands, then millions, to a disease that was increasingly understood to be sexually transmitted both het- erosexually and homosexually, as well as passed on through intra- venous drug use, medical treatment for hemophilia and other blood diseases, and also childbirth, as the virus would pass from infected mother to infant. Just as racism was presenting itself as a major challenge for women priests and other religious leaders in the last quarter of the twentieth century, AIDS came crashing into our midst as a problem with significant pastoral, political, theological, and eth- ical dimensions, especially for gay men and their families in the church. The AIDS crisis forced clergy in the United States, for ex- ample, to relate to non-traditional families, where one gay partner dying of AIDS might be entirely rejected by his partner's family or, worse, his own parents. Every Episcopal priest had to deal with such pastoral challenges and struggle with their spiritual implica- tions: If God did not give gay men AIDS as punishment - and no thoughtful, caring Episcopal priest would have imagined such a thing - then how might we best understand what was happening from theological and ethical perspectives? How might we better understand human sexuality than simply to avoid discussing it, which is how most of the early generation of women priests had been raised within our families as well as our churches? No sex outside of marriage. That was the rule, the ethic, 7 The most reliable ongoing source for information on HIV/AIDS is the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS at www.unaids.org The 2011 and 2013 epidemiological reports contain these and many other statistics. An- other resource is Victoria Angela Harding, AIDS at 30: A History , (Washington, D.C., 2012).</page><page sequence="10">LESSONS AND LIMITS 155 and behind it almost no theological reflection on human sexuality had taken place in the church or church-based families. The church's ef- forts to wrestle creatively with human sexuality as a theological gift, rather than an embarrassment to the people of God, began to happen seriously during a period in which feminist insistence on the sanctity and power of women's lives - such as embodied in the Philadelphia and Washington ordinations - overlapped with the AIDS crisis. These two major phenomena - the feminist movement and the gay com- munity's response to AIDS - produced a powerful theological affir- mation:8 Our sexuality is a gift from a loving God whose desire for us includes not only the possibility of reproduction in some re- lationships but also sexual pleasure for partners in the context of mutually responsible relationships. Among feminist, womanist, gay, and lesbian theologians, and over time, queer theologians, in Episcopal and Anglican traditions, the love of a god who affirms our sexualities and delights in responsible sexual behavior was uncontested. For some of us, the inherent links between women's and LGBTQ liberation had been immediately apparent. As early as the mid-1970s, about the time of the Philadelphia ordinations, a number of Christian feminist theologians, and some gay male theologians, were making connections between Christian misog- yny (historic hatred of women - in Thomas Aquinas words, "a mis- begotten seed") and Christian homophobia (fear of same sex love) . Both are rooted, feminist theologians realized, in a pervasive contempt for human bodies - especially women's bodies, which have been historically scapegoated by Christian men's fears and anxieties about their own sexual passions.9 The depths of the 8 An excellent resource for help in understanding the ethical affirmation and spiritual celebration of sexuality, in the contexts of feminism, LGBTQ struggles, and the HIV/ AIDS crisis, is Marvin M. Ellison and Kelly Brown Douglas, eds., Sexuality and the Sacred: Sources for Theological Reflection (Louisville, 2010). For the church fathers' views of women and the scapegoating of women by Christian men, see Mary Daly, Beyond God the Father: A Philosophy of Women's Liberation (Boston, 1973); and Rosemary Radford Ruether, Sexism and God-Talk: Towards a Feminist Theology (Boston, 1983); also see Beverly Wildung Harrison, Making the Connections : Essays in Feminist Social Ethics (Boston, 1985), and Carter Heyward, Touching our Strength: The Erotic as Power and the Love of God (New York, 1989).</page><page sequence="11">156 ANGLICAN AND EPISCOPAL HISTORY fear that bubbled up in response to women's ordination - what if a menstruating woman is at the altar? what if a woman priest is pregnant? what if men are too sexually aroused by a woman priest to be able to pray? - suggested to the early women priests and feminist theologians that women's ordination was releasing the demon of misogyny among Episcopalians and Anglicans. Over the next decade, we would come to realize that homophobia was first cousin to this wicked spirit. A commitment to both gen- der and sexual justice, for all women and for LGBTQ people, has been widely embraced by Episcopal and other Anglican feminists and gay/ queer theologians over the past four decades. More difficult has been our coming to a consensus on what con- stitutes a responsible sexual ethic. The question of same-sex mar- riage has helped raise the question of whether one relational pattern, life-long marriage, should be held up by the church as the ideal for everyone; or whether we should consider the pos- sibility that other patterns - for example, sexual relationships outside of marriage, non-monogamous sexual relationships, or life-commitments to more than one person - might be responsi- ble choices for some people in certain circumstances.10 These are neither easy nor popular questions for most church people but, not so long ago, neither were questions about divorce, women's equality in marriage, or gay and lesbian relationships. LESSON FOUR: GOD IS NOT A CHRISTIAN There are probably few questions more difficult for most Chris- tians, including Anglicans, than those sparked by Archbishop Desmond Tutu's observation that "God is not a Christian." For much of the last half of the twentieth century, Anglicans and Epis- copalians had been exploring ecumenism - that is, our relation- ships with other Christian traditions. There had been far less engagement with other religions and faith-traditions such as Islam and Judaism. 10 Marvin M. Ellison, Same-Sex Marriage? A Christian Ethical Analysis (Cleveland, 2004) especially the last chapter "Queer Notions," 147-86.</page><page sequence="12">LESSONS AND LIMITS 157 The religious feminist movement which began in the United States and Europe in the late 1960s brought Christian and Jewish women scholars and religious leaders together to explore such theological problems as the church's blaming of "the Jews" for the death of Jesus, its granting the New Testament spiritual and moral precedence over the Old Testament, and its teaching a doc- trine of salvation only through faith in Christ.11 Given the events of modern history and the church's silence during the Holocaust, most of the Jewish-Christian women's conversations tended to focus on the Christian church's anti-Semitism and on how Chris- tian women - feminists, priests, and other leaders - could re- frame our understandings of God, Christ, and church in such a way as to do justice to our Jewish religious ancestors. Seldom did either Jewish or Christian women raise the challenging con- temporary problem of Israel's horrific treatment of the Palesti- nians and of how understanding one's religious tradition as uniquely "chosen" by God is, in fact, to promote a damning theology of an exclusivist, arrogant, and ultimately violent deity. In the past two decades, however, many women priests have joined growing numbers of Christians who travel to Palestine/ Israel to work among Palestinian peacemakers and, wherever possible, with Israelis who are also committed to the work of peace. Since the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001, the challenge of interfaith understanding and cooperation has been increas- ingly urgent. Episcopalians and Anglicans, like other Christians, are having to reimagine our religious traditions and those of others to be siblings in the family of humankind. This interfaith journey raises many questions. How can we believe in the redemp- tive love of Jesus Christ unless he is God's only son? Can Christ be 11 A number of Christian feminists and liberation theologians have ad- dressed these historical theological issues of the deeply imbedded, implicit anti-Semitism in Christianity, especially Christology. For example, Rosemary Radford Ruether, Faith and Fratricide: The Theological Roots of Anti-Semitism (New York, 1974); Isabel Carter Heyward, The Redemption of God; A Theology of Mutual Relation (Portland, OR: 2010); and, Elisabeth Schlussler-Fiorenza, In Memory of Her: A Feminist Theological Reconstruction of Christian Origins (New York, 1983).</page><page sequence="13">158 ANGLICAN AND EPISCOPAL HISTORY only one sacred image among many? Can we ourselves be sisters and brothers of Jesus? Can we furthermore imagine ourselves as brothers and sisters to Jews, Muslims, Buddhists, Hindus, and people of other faith traditions, and none at all? What does it mean, to be a sister or brother? Could it mean primarily that we love one another - that we respect the humanity of others and struggle for their basic human rights, whether or not we under- stand them, or like them? LESSON FIVE: THE WHOLE CREATION GROANING One of the loveliest and healthiest roots of Anglican faith is our affirmation of the goodness not only of the Creator but also the creation. That is good news. The bad news is that neither the Epis- copal Church, nor any other major religious group in the United States, has been a particularly aggressive leader in promoting pub- lic policies that promote environmental protection and sustain- ability. Leadership in this area has come from individuals, including Buddhists, pagans, other non-Christians, together with Christian theologians and ethicists, often feminists, who have formed associations in solidarity with the earth and taken their concerns to Washington and other centers of political power. In the United States, one of the most eloquent spokespersons on behalf of the planet has been feminist Buddhist Joanna Macy. Christian feminists Sallie McFague and Catherine Keller, gay lib- eration ethicist Dan Spencer, and progressive Lutheran ethicist Larry Rasmussen are among those who have sided with the earth against the advance of global capitalism. Throughout my life, and especially in the past couple of de- cades, my animal friends - especially dogs and horses - have been among the major sources of my best energies - physically, psycho- logically, socially, intellectually, and spiritually. In the early 2000s, I wrote that, in the therapeutic horseback riding arena, "the horse is the priest," meaning that this large creature is a conduit of healing energy and, in a very real way, mediates God to those humans who turn to the horse for help. It becomes clearer to me all the time, that creation and creatures - humans and other creatures</page><page sequence="14">LESSONS AND LIMITS 159 too - constantly spill over with Sacred Power.12 Of course, many creatures, including many humans, are toxic and dangerous, but many are not, and often even those who seem bad for our health are not always, and in every situation, harmful. Beyond the de- structive character of creation, much of creation and countless creatures are God-bearers to us, just as we Christians believe that Jesus of Nazareth, his mother, and his friends were, and are, part- ners who can "god" (verb) with us. In such a creation-affirming spirit, many women priests and other religious leaders have been proponents of ecologically grounded theologies and ethics. We need to realize, however, that such spiritual commitments, if we are serious, require that we learn to be responsible, well-informed critics of the global capitalist economy which is shaping our lives and decimating the earth and its many, varied creatures. LESSON SIX: CAPITALIST SPIRITUALITY The "capitalist spirituality" which Beverly Harrison perceived to be draped over our collective life in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries, constitutes one of the most theologically confounding problems we face as Anglican and Episcopal Chris- tians today. It is such a huge problem that the first obstacle we face in imagining its transformation is our own disbelief that anything can be done about it, at least by common folk like us. Global cap- italism thrives on our collective sense of resignation that nothing can be done so we might as well make our peace with it - more honestly, confirm our pact with the devil. But we can do something, those of us who are religious leaders - women priests and others: we can challenge the basis of capitalist spirituality in own lives and communities. We can become increas- ingly aware of how it directs where we put our time, energies, money, and votes. We can teach and preach that capitalist spirituality, 12 For a sense of what I am talking about here, see "The Horse as Priest," in Carter Heyward, God in the Balance: Christianity in Times of Terror (Cleveland, 2002). For a larger, global perspective on "earth ethics," see Christian ethicist Larry Rasmussen, Earth-Honoring Faith: Religious Ethics in a New Key (New York, 2013).</page><page sequence="15">160 ANGLICAN AND EPISCOPAL HISTORY for example, is rooted in a highly individualistic sense of what makes us human. We can point out that, in capitalism, the indi- vidual male reigns as king and father, because capitalism, espe- cially in its advanced global mutation, is a male-driven ideology in which each man is encouraged to focus on his own well-being and that of everyone and everything in his own circle of respon- sibility and influence. Making profit - for the 1%, generating wealth - is man's primary business aim. Spiritual aspirations of generosity and kindness are lovely, but they must be kept in check by lesser dimensions of human nature such as greed and ruthless- ness. It is what makes global capitalism work: Successful practi- tioners cannot afford to experience much empathy, or offer solidarity to others, especially competitors, adversaries, and those with different parts to play in the drama of global capitalism. In a predominantly monotheistic context, like the United States, the leaders of the nation as well as of the dominant reli- gious bodies imagine that this way of ordering our life together is built and blessed by God Himself, in whose image kings and fathers are made. Capitalist spirituality teaches and preaches that it's important to confine our kindness and generosity to our life- styles as individuals, and to our voluntary associations such as churches. Above all, we must keep such foolish notions as taxing the rich; equitable distribution of resources; sustainability of the earth; and universal health care out of the realm of public respon- sibility. Capitalist spirituality forbids nations and governments to take any serious responsibility for the health and well-being of the poor or the earth. Capitalist spirituality is a radically anti-comprehensive spiritual- ity which leads us away from rather than toward the Spirit that in- fused the life of Jesus. It is the very opposite of what most Anglicans probably aspire to embrace. At our best, we Anglicans and Episcopalians share a spirituality that moves us out toward others rather than primarily folding us in upon ourselves. When we think about those Anglican and Episcopal leaders we have most admired - too many to name in one essay or one book - we realize that their spirituality has been an expansive energy, enlarging their circles of influence, making them larger. But capitalist spir- ituality makes us smaller, insulating us from the needs, values,</page><page sequence="16">LESSONS AND LIMITS 161 opinions, and lives of those who are not like us. In this distorted spirit, racist exploitation of various ethnic groups and the deple- tion of the earth's resources become two of global capitalism's most important partners. Human cruelty to other humans be- comes inescapable, and we are required to disregard the quality of water and air, the condition of the earth, and the well-being of animals - unless any of these natural resources and animals hap- pen to belong to us.13 For many women priests and other Episcopalians and Angli- cans, transforming capitalist spirituality into a vibrant liberation spirituality remains an unrealized goal, except in our private lives and in small communities of like-minded friends and colleagues, through which we have little impact on capitalism as a global eco- nomic structure. But the "privacy" and smallness of our spiritual practices, even among fierce critics of capitalism, ironically under- scores how utterly shaped we are by capitalist spirituality; therefore how enormous the challenge of helping it become a system that is rooted in the love of our neighbors. In the real world, however, which is an increasingly frantic cap- italist world, we should be realistic about how much we can actu- ally attain in the struggles to transform global capitalism and its seductive spirituality. Nearly all of us need to better learn the "rev- olutionary patience" once recommended to us by German theo- logian Dorothee Soelle, herself a passionate critic of capitalism.14 We can help each other develop both political strategies for the social and economic changes we seek - for example, to fairly tax the wealthy in our nations; and spiritual strategies such as mind- fulness, which help us live more gratefully, one day at a time, on the basis of faith, hope, and love. The Anglican tradition, and the Episcopal Church in the United States, have much theological language, some liturgical re- sources, and many intelligent leaders to help our nations meet this 13 Krugman, Conscience of a Liberal , Reich, Beyond Outrage. The phrase capi- talist spirituality is also found in the work of Harrison, Justice in the Making, , 46, note 2. See Dorothee Soelle, Revolutionary Patience, trans.

This remains a challenge for the whole church and, for many women priests, feminist Christians and others, a primary pastoral and prophetic goal of our ministries. LESSON SEVEN: WOMEN IN PATRIARCHAL CHRISTIANITY The Philadelphia ordinations in 1974 and the ordinations in Washington D.C. a year later were intended by the participants to bear witness to the comprehensiveness and inclusivity not only of God's love for women, but also God's desire that women, as well as men, be authorized by the Anglican Church to represent God's love to the whole world. In the "one holy catholic and apostolic tradition," which we share with other Christian religions that de- scribe themselves as catholic, the priest has been understood his- torically as one who represents God to the people, and the people to God, especially in the ancient ritual of Holy Communion or the Eucharist. To assume, as many Episcopalians did as recently as forty years ago, that the ordained priest must be male, because Jesus Christ was male, is to idolatrize the maleness (genitals) of Jesus, and of the male priest, as the essence of holiness. The highly publicized Philadelphia ordination was a leap to- ward re-visioning women in the image of a god that is beyond gen- der, which remains a challenge and, in my opinion, the most radical and truthful window through which to view the Sacred. But another theological leap is even trickier, if not finally as radical and potentially transformative of Christianity itself: to worship the image of God as mother, daughter, and sister. Only insofar as Christian imagination can stretch way beyond its patriarchal boundaries can women's ordination signal an affirmation of God in the image of woman - not only a gender-neutral deity, not only a god beyond maleness and femaleness, as deeply truthful as these images are, but also God as represented by a female body with breasts, a female body that bleeds, a female body that gives birth. Can God be experienced and worshiped among men and</page><page sequence="18">LESSONS AND LIMITS 163 boys, as well as women and girls, as mother, sister, daughter, even female lover? This question was implicit in the ordination of women priests and it has not yet been answered in the affirma- tive. Rather, it is largely ignored by most Anglicans, women as well as men, bishops, priests, deacons, and laity. Even progressive Anglicans and Episcopalians, including feminists, are likely to respond that there are more important issues for us to be dealing with, such as those in this essay, or that it's theologically more truthful to imagine the Sacred as spirit that is neither male nor female. It is certainly more accurate spiritually, and wiser theologically, to present God as our Sacred Power, transcendent of all gender identity, than to box Him into the anthropomorphic and andro- centric image of Father and not let Him out of this constrictive container, where He's been kept over the millennia. Some will in- sist that the Fatherhood of God and Sonship of Jesus is to some extent balanced by the gender-neutral Spirit and by Mary the mother of Jesus in catholic tradition. But this kind of reasoning is defensive and disingenuous. No participant in Christian worship can honestly believe that Christian worship is not male-dominated. As for Mary of Nazareth, her symbolic presence as theotokos , God bearer, has been used in Anglo- and Roman Catholicism to keep women out of the priesthood, and keep her in her place in the family as a model for obedient Christian women who live to serve the Father and Son. Three years before the Philadelphia ordination, Roman Cath- olic philosopher and professor Mary Daly led women out of the chapel at Harvard University. This exodus from the church, which is what Daly and her followers intended, embodied the refusal of Christian women to continue to participate in their own oppres- sion. During the years leading up to the Philadelphia ordination, I had several occasions to argue with Mary Daly about whether, as she believed, Christianity was essentially and intrinsically patriar- chal, therefore an utterly hopeless organization for self-respecting women; or, as I believed, an institution that had been patriarchally constructed and, therefore, could be de-constructed over time by self-respecting women.</page><page sequence="19">164 ANGLICAN AND EPISCOPAL HISTORY By the time of her death in 2012, my companion Beverly Harrison, herself an adamant believer in the historical construc- tion of all social institutions, and a critic of Mary Daly's essential- ism, had concluded that the church's sexism and misogyny runs so deep and wide that its transformation into a genuinely woman- affirming movement will be a long time coming, if ever. In the meantime, although many feminists remain Christian in order to help the church be what it can be at its best - to act in solidarity with the poor and marginalized, including women and children, and with the earth - many feminists, more than we will ever know, including Anglicans and Episcopalians, have long since left the church and found other ways to work for justice and practice spir- ituality. I dare say there are many of us who seldom go to church but call ourselves Christian - and do our best to participate in the Jesus-movement's comprehensiveness: its advocacy for justice, peace, the dignity of every person and the well-being of creation. Yet many of us are too alienated from, or too weary of, patriarchally- shaped liturgies to bother. And this Episcopal woman priest can't help wondering, as I feed my horses and walk my dogs through the woods most Sunday mornings, if Mary Daly was right.</page></plain_text>
