Furthermore, this position is then sometimes given a normative gloss, as if the absent features were in some way inherently inconsistent or obviously absurd and therefore should have no place in universal language projects wor- thy of attention. The final point is a criticism for which the author has very little responsibil- ity. I would have hoped that a book sold at this price would have been pro- duced and proofread with a bit more care. Apart from the occasional typos there is a footnote breaking off in mid-sentence (p. 88) and some appearing seemingly out of the blue in the middle of the page (p. 271). The occasional non-standard symbols (e.g. the Hebrew on p. 20, the symbols on p. 43) are typeset as a crude array of pixels and most of the illustrations which show pages from the books or manuscripts discussed are scanned with such a low resolution as to be unreadable. I would want to stress in conclusion that these criticism should not obscure the main virtue of this very important book, namely that it presents a clear and thorough exposition and discussion of the systems presented in Dalgarno's and Wilkins's works. The reader interested in finding out how the nitty-gritty of their universal language projects actually works could therefore do no better than reading Maat's book before actually tackling the primary sources.

Cambridge, MA: MIT/Bradford, 2004. Pp. xiii + 287. H/b ?22.95. Life is short and there are too many good books in philosophy for me to recommend that you read this one. I will now explain why. To begin, the thesis of the book is that mental talk is really about action (behaviour) covert or overt. Thinking is acting, overtly or by 'covert token per- formance' (p. xi). Talk about the mind or mental states is really about actions (if it is 'about' anything ... sometimes it is not about anything, as 'mind' fails to refer, on Melser's view). Any attempt to say otherwise is a kind of mistake ... dare I say 'category mistake'. Yes, that is right. This book is a re-make of ideas found in Gilbert Ryle's Concept of Mind (1949) and in the latter Wittgenstein (1963). Melser even explicitly appeals to 'category mistakes', (pp. 221, 233) and Mind,Vol. 115 . 458 . April2006 ? Mind Association 2006</page><page sequence="2">448 Book Reviews he makes similar claims to those of Ryle about confusing thinking with some- thing that goes on in the brain or inside of one's head. Of course, the book is not only about ideas found in Ryle or Wittgenstein. The author also blends in some ideas about metaphor first argued for in Lakoff &amp; Johnson (1980)--such as that metaphorical use of language distorts and mistakenly nominalizes words like 'mind' making us think there are things such as minds. While I will not have time to lay this out here, I have compared Melser's list of metaphorical uses of the word 'mind' to similar uses of the word 'heart'. If Melser has shown that 'mind' does not refer because of metaphor then he has also shown that 'heart' does not refer-and by exact parity of reasoning. What this tells me is that the reasoning is flawed, since there are hearts (and there are minds too, by the way). Whether we go back fifty years (to Ryle and Wittgenstein) or a mere twenty (to Lakoff &amp; Johnson), this book attempts to move us backward. One cannot overcome the impression of being dragged back into the heyday of ordi- nary language philosophy, where pronouncements are made upon the meta- physical nature of the mind and action all derived from features of the surface grammar of language. It is dedj vu all over again, and high time philosophers get over it and its vestiges. So to start, the best ideas in the book were stated bet- ter by other people first, and cognitive science has taken us past all of this (or should have) in the last fifty years. Were people not paying attention? Next, the arguments for Melser's thesis are bad. For instance, early on (pp. 3- 6) Melser paints as mutually exclusive the ideas that what goes on in one's mind are information processing events that go on in one's brain (on one hand) ver- sus that thinking is a kind of activity that a person does (on the other hand). He (as Ryle and Wittgenstein before him) seems to take it as an unargued presup- position that it cannot be both. He takes it as given that the person cannot be a composite of sub-personal events or agencies. Here is where Melser seems to see a category mistake ... mistaking thinking for something that happens inside of one instead of something one does. But any materialist about persons must take the person to be a composite of sub-personal events. Even if my mental doings are actions of mine, actions at a personal level of description, when I do some- thing, my doing (my causing) something cannot be more than a collection of the proper parts of my brain's causing something too. My doing is the relevant portions of my brain's causing the relevant events. The personal level of description may employ mental terms and actional language to describe it, but the very same physical events that make my actions possible have to be able to be described in sub-personal terms. Indeed on a token-identity theory, they are the very same events variously described at different levels (something any enlightened materialist accepts as true). The closest Melser comes to even noticing this challenge is when he argues against what he calls 'action physicalism' in the last chapter of the book. How- ever, he still does not face the challenge I give directly above. He mainly just repeats his presupposition that natural processes in the brain are one thing and learned actions (which he claims are 'not a natural process' and are of a 'differ- Mind, Vol. 115 . 458 . April 2006 ? Mind Association 2006</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews 449 ent category') are another thing (p. 221). (By the way, how does one learn to think? I know one can learn to improve thought. I know one learns to play the piano ... by thinking and practicing, but how does one learn to think, if not in part by thinking? Beats me. And it must beat Melser too, for he never explains, though he makes the claim that thinking is an action one learns.) At any rate, Melser mentions two reasons why action physicalism is false: The 'empathy argument' and the 'action metaphors in science' argument. Melser makes a mess of the empathy argument. What he wants to say is something like what simulation theorists such as Goldman, Gordon, and Heal say. That is, he wants to say that to observe and understand an action one must simulate the actor, simulate one's performing the action oneself. Now there is interesting literature on autism and on mirror neurons and many other excit- ing and new things to be learned and to be said about this basic idea that Melser could use to support such a claim. Melser talks about none of this liter- ature. Worse yet, Melser's proclaimed point is supposed to be about observa- tion of actions ... an epistemological point. Instead it comes out metaphysical: 'Actions require empathy' (p. 222). Surely, scratching my nose when it itches is an action. Surely scratching my nose does not require empathy. Frankly, I find it very hard to believe that your perceiving my scratching my nose requires empathy either, for that matter. But this is what we 'learn' from the empathy argument. Now how is that a reply to my point about token-identity of actions with physical sets of events? Clearly, it is not. I suspect Melser thinks this is a reply for this reason. He thinks that if we have to simulate actions to observe them, then they cannot be objective, phys- ical events. He hints that we cannot even refer to them (p. 245). But this does not follow. It mistakes the epistemological for the metaphysical (as noted). What could be a more objective, physical event than my scratching my nose? It can take place at a time (06.02.05 at lo:oo a.m. EST). It can be witnessed (by my office staff). It can be photographed. And so on. How much more physi- cal and objective can something get? Well, that is the empathy argument. How about the 'action metaphors in science' argument? It is the claim that 'scientific explanation ... of physiological events requires the use of action metaphors, and this makes physiological descriptions incapable of explaining things that literally are actions' (p. 228). Again, the best I can make of this is our old friend the 'category mistake'. The idea is that much of science tries to anthropomorphize nature, make it teleological, or goal-directed. But if events are treated as from agents, then actions cannot literally be explained by science because science is not anthropomorphic, teleological or rational. It would be a category mistake. What is actional is metaphorical, and what is metaphorical cannot be mechanistic or scientific (pp. 232-3). This is warmed over Ryle at best, and it ignores most of what happened in the last half the last century, namely, we now understand how to make even guided missiles that are teleological and we are working on naturalizing meaning and mind.

Department of Philosophy FREDERICK ADAMS University of Delaware Newark, DE 19716 USA fa@udel.edu doi: 10.1093/mind/fz1447 Varieties of Meaning, by Ruth Garrett Millikan. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 2004. Pp. xi + 242. H/b ?22.95. The central task of this book is to provide an account of intentional signs, which include both outer signs (e.g. natural languages) and inner signs (e.g. beliefs and desires). Part I describes the nature of the purposes of people, including their body parts, their artifacts, and their signs. Part II introduces the notion of a 'locally recurrent' natural sign on which Millikan builds her general theory of intentional signs, and because of its important contribution to ending the on-going content wars in the philosophy of mind, will be the pri- mary focus of this review. Part III of the book concerns the continuities between locally recurrent natural signs and public language signs, while Part IV explores the development of inner representations from the most primitive kinds found in simple organisms to the subject-predicate judge- ments seemingly peculiar to humans. How are various types of meaning related to one another? One sense of 'to mean' is to signify or represent; another sense is to do something with pur- pose. In the philosophy of mind the word 'intentional' is used to cover both types of meaning. According to Millikan, there is an important connection between these two types of meaning, a connection that would make the dou- ble-duty that 'intentional' performs no accident. The view, in short, is this: intentional states (including the paradigm cases of belief and desire)-- Millikan calls them 'intentional signs'-are representational states that have purposes essentially, and it is because they have purposes essentially that such states can be true or false, since purposes can always go unfulfilled (p. x).
