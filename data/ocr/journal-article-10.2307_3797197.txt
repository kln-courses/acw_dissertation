<plain_text><page sequence="1">102 JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT, VOL. 16, No. 1, JANUARY 1952 Union Bay. (The Life of a City Marsh), by Harry W. Higman and Earl J. Larrison. University of Washington Press, Seattle 5, Wash. $4.00. This is to me a surprising and delightful book. My wife opened it first and her pre- liminary curiosity led to a one-session reading, clearly indicative of the absorbing nature of its contents. She tried it on the neighbor's 12-year-old daughter who opened it from politeness and five minutes later subsided onto her shoulderblades and lapsed into silence. My own experience with it was no less keen, in fact I am sure it was even greater than theirs; for this is a story told with sufficient vivacity and humor to interest the young and at the same time there is a keenness of perception and an aptness of phrase that makes it possible for the reader to enjoy in proportion to his knowledge. Starting with the thesis that it is no longer possible to ignore man in any wildlife story, the authors in just over 300 pages take one again and again through this city marsh each time viewing a different facet of its teeming life, each time watching this life break and swirl around human presence like the dark water parting at the canoe prow. There is good biology aplenty in it too but it is unobtrusive. The simon pure behaviorist may perhaps take exception to the few out- bursts of anthropomorphism. These the au- thors acknowledge and indulge for a purpose and I think generally achieve their aims. In only one chapter, that on the phalarope, did I find it overdone. They have had untold hours of fun, relaxa- tion, and absorbing interest in the marsh of which they write. If you would relive some of your own most satisfying experiences, if you seek to awaken others to the fascination to be found outdoors, this book will do it.-I. McT.
