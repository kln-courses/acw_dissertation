<plain_text><page sequence="1">An Analysis of a Stamp Seal with Complex Religious Motifs Excavated at Tel cEn Gev* David T. Sugimoto Keio University, Tokyo ABSTRACT: This paper analyses the nature of a large stamp seal with complex reli- gious motifs, recently excavated at Tel cEn Gev, Israel. The find is compared with other seals unearthed from sites in surrounding regions. Although the form and material of the seal reflect a local style, the motif of a degenerated form of a styl- ised tree indicates divergence from the local fertility symbols of the Middle to Late Bronze Age. The appearance of a variety of horned quadrupeds and suckling animals, together with scorpions, suggests cultural influence from northern Syria. Since this seal was unearthed from an Iron IB stratum at a site on the eastern shore of the Sea of Galilee, its iconography seems to reflect the changing religious atmo- sphere at the beginning of the Iron Age in the southern Levant. INTRODUCTION A large stamp seal containing complex religious figures was unearthed at Tel cEn Gev, Israel, during excavations conducted in the summer of 2010. 1 Because it was found in the eleventh-tenth-century BCE stratum east of the Sea of Galilee, an analysis of the seal is important for understanding the religious climate of the Geshur region, which remains largely unknown. This paper analyses the form, material and iconography of this important seal and compares it with other seals unearthed in Israel and adjacent regions. ARCHAEOLOGICAL CONTEXT Our seal was unearthed from grid DIO of Area H, in the north-western area of the upper city of Tel cEn Gev (fig. 1). In DIO, a kitchen facility, consisting of three ovens of different shapes (stratum IV), was unearthed below two separate plaster floors from different periods (strata III and II). The grid was surrounded by two diagonal walls running along its eastern and southern sides, and many pottery sherds and carbonised plants have been unearthed from the area between them. Since the seal was found adjacent to the southern wall, it may date from the * This article is the product of a study funded by Kakenhi JSPS Grants-in-Aid for Scien- tific Research (no. 20401033). l The excavation was conducted by the Keio Archaeological Expedition to Israel under the direction of the author.

Archaeological context of the seal same period as the floor of the kitchen facility, the pottery sherds and carbonised materials.2 The pottery found on this floor, including cooking pots with everted or overhanging rims and incurved bowls, can be dated to the Iron Age IB (mid- eleventh to mid-tenth centuries BCE). This dating was confirmed by the results of 14C analysis of plant remains (leguminosae; 1 sample): 1026-930 cal BCE (1 sigma: 68%), 1112-910 cal BCE (2 sigma: 95%).3 MATERIALAND SHAPE The analysis of the seal (35 mm in height; oval face 42 mm in length and 36 mm in width; fig. 2) reveals its material to be grey limestone and its shape to be of Keel's 'Conoid type III' (Keel 1995: 100-102; Buchanan 1984: xi-xviii).4 Traces of rubbing can be observed throughout the upper part of the conoid. On the central-upper side of the seal, a 5 -mm- wide hole appears to have been drilled toward the shorter diame- ter of the seal face, probably to insert a string. Such dimensions are rare for the conoid seals uncovered in Israel.5 Multiple figures are engraved on the seal face. Keel (1995) listed the following as the forms of seals found in Palestine/Israel: 2 For preliminary finds, see Sugimoto 2010a; Sugimoto and Kansha 2010; 2011; 2012. More detailed information will appear in the final report (forthcoming). 3 Calibration to calendar age is based on CARIB REV 6.00 (copyright 1986-2010, M. Stuiver and P.J. Reimer); the 14C-AMS analyses were conducted by the Palyno Survey Co. Ltd., Japan. 4 Seals of true conical shape are relatively rare with both Keel's and Buchanan's catego- ries of 'conoid' seals; those with a rounded top, like our seal, are more common. 5 The diameter of the seal face of conoid seals is usually around 20 mm. Only a few conoid seals with diameters exceeding 30 mm - Arad 33 (a broken piece, 3 1 .6x3 1 .2 mm?); Bet-El (31x32 mm); Dor (32.2x29.4 mm); and Tell el-Farcah (North) 4 (041 mm) - are listed in the large corpus of stamp seals from the southern Levant compiled by Keel (1997; 2010a; 2010b; 2012; see also Buchanan 1966; 1981). However, our seal is larger than most of them.</page><page sequence="3">STAMP SEAL EXCAVATED AT TEL CEN GEY 1 1 Fig. 2.

He distinguished six types of conoid seals. Keel-Leu (1990) shows that limestone conoids became quite popular in the area during the Iron Age I and IIA and points out that similar conoids are known from Cyprus from the Late Cypriot IIIA. While most of the conoids discussed by Keel-Leu bear a geometric design on their stamp face, there is a group of conoids with figures of quadrupeds and scorpions just like ours, dealt with by Keel (1990) and Staubli (2009). Staubli suggests that although the form and material are typically local for this period, the motif reflects northern Syrian influence (2009: 617). In northern Syria during the Iron Age I and IIA, haematite or quartz scarabs and scaraboids containing these figures were popular (Keel 1990: 367-377), and the same type of seals has also been found with limestone conoids in Israel (discussed further below). 6 Flat pieces can have round or square faces and sometimes appear with a handle.</page><page sequence="4">1 2 DAVID T. SUGIMOTO ICONOGRAPHY On the upper-central area of the seal face, a bold vertical line is drawn, with three branches protruding from its top. This appears to reflect a degenerated form of a stylised tree. Although not a standard style, it was a popular motif in the southern Levant during the Middle and Late Bronze Ages. On either side, horned quadru- peds face the 'tree' with their heads looking toward the top of the seal. The horns of the quadruped on the left protrude forward, whereas the horns of the one on the right protrude backward. On the right side of the latter animal, above its back, another smaller quadruped is depicted with short horns or ears and a forward- protruding tail. On the lower side, a single large quadruped is depicted; it has long horns and a suckling young under its abdomen. The head of the young animal merges into its mother's udder and faces backward. Two scorpions are depicted, one in front of and the other above this large quadruped; each is engraved with a relatively bold long line representing a torso, four to six shorter horizontal lines representing feet, and a crescent-shaped sting at the end of the tail. To provide further insight into this seal, the various elements of its design are analysed below to allow for comparison with Iron Age seals unearthed in Israel, the iconography of which have been elucidated by Shuval (1990), Keel (1990; 1998; cf. Keel and Uelinger 1998) and Staubli (2009). 1 . The Stylised Tree The tree, often dubbed 'tree of life' or 'tree and caprids (ibexes)' motif - depict- ing a stylised date tree with quadrupeds on its sides - commonly appears on Canaanite seals and pottery from the Middle and Late Bronze Ages (fig. 3). The tree is sometimes painted as a female genital. Flowing water is often painted as meandering lines descending from the leaves of the tree, and a fish is sometimes added (cf. fig. 3e-f).7 At Mari, this motif is painted on the façade of the Ishtar temple (cf. Parrot 1958: pls. VIII-XIII), and it is often associated with a naked or half-naked goddess in gold pendants, clay figurines and scarabs (cf. figs. 3a-d).8 In the Canaanite world, the stylised tree together with female genitals stood for the fertility goddess as an interchangeable symbol (Keel 1998: 20-36, esp. 30-36; see also Sugimoto 2012: 127-133). In the Iron Age I, in contrast, depictions of a goddess or of female genitals disappeared almost completely, and only the symbol of the stylised tree was used (fig. 4a-b). During the Iron Age IIA, the depiction of the tree itself became rare, 7 Now also on a decorative cult stand from the LB Tabaqat Fahil (Bourke 2012: fig. 17). 8 The drawing and inscription on the Lachish ewer clearly indicates the association of the tree symbolism with Elat, usually understood as a fertility goddess (cf. Hestrin 1987).</page><page sequence="5">STAMP SEAL EXCAVATED AT TEL CEN GEY 1 3 Fig. 3.

Keel (1998: 39-46; Keel and Uelinger 1998: 141-144, 205-206) 9 Keel (1990: 375) points out that the motif of the tree also lost its importance as the theme of haematite or quartz scarabs/scaraboids during the Iron Age I and IIA in northern Syria.</page><page sequence="6">1 4 DAVID T.

Their independence was reinforced by the figure of a quadru- ped holding a suckling, suggesting that they no longer depend on receiving fertility blessings from the tree. Although a remote memory of a fertility goddess may have lingered behind the concept of the tree during this period, the latter had, in fact, become no more than a symbol of blessings.11 In support of this proposal, Keel (1998: 42-46, figs. 79-96) points out that, from the Iron Age IIB (the mid- ninth century BCE), the tree came to be associated with a male god in the rare instances that it appeared on seals (fig. 4h-i).12 The Hebrew Bible provides evidence of the existence of sanctuaries with sacred trees before the establishment of the United Kingdom (e.g., Shechem [Gen. 12:6; 35:4; Deut. 11:30]; Beer Sheba [Gen. 21:33]; Kadesh in Naphtali [Judg. 4:11]; Ophrah [Judg. 6] ), as well as that of trees standing at 'high places' during the period of the Kingdoms of Israel and Judah (see, for example, 1 Kings 14:23; 2 Kings 17:10; Jer. 2:20). There had probably been a tradition of a sacred tree cult during the early years of the Israelite kingdoms, but it is unclear whether this cult was directly related to a fertility goddess.13 At the very least, the changes 10 The motif of the tree commonly appeared on painted pottery during the Late Bronze Age, but disappeared as red-washed pottery became predominant during the Iron Age. I have discussed elsewhere how the meaning of the few remaining examples of the tree in Iron Age pottery has changed over time (Sugimoto 2012). 1 1 The tree motif was often sloppily painted and incompletely depicted on LB pottery. Choi (2008: chapters II and IV) suggests that this reflects the growing use of these motifs as symbols of blessings rather than as direct representations of a goddess. 12 Oman (2011) has recently pointed out that the association of the stylised tree with male deities had even earlier traditions, discussing the LB Bacal statue unearthed from Hazor with tree and caprids on his headdress. 13 The question whether Asherah, a Canaanite fertility goddess, continued to be worshipped until the later period of the Kingdoms of Israel and Judah is hotly debated by scholars of biblical studies and religious history. For proponents of this position, see Hadley 2000; Day 2001; and Dever 2005; for adversaries, see Smith 2002 and Ahituv 2006. Na'aman and Lissovsky (2008: 195) assume that the tree was associated with Asherah in Israel but acknowledge that it could represent other deities in other contexts. Kletter (1996) originally associated the Judaean pillar figurines, which appear in late Iron Age Judah contexts, with Asherah, but later argued that this is not clear, because their association is 'based on OT sources (together with Kh. El-Qom and Kuntillet cAjrud inscriptions) or, to be more correct, on a certain interpretation of these sources' (Kletter 2001: 205).</page><page sequence="8">1 6 DAVID T. SUGIMOTO in the figures depicted on the seals do not support the continuation of such a belief.14 The degenerated form of the tree engraved on our seal reflects the changes that were taking place in the religious climate from the Late Bronze Age to the Iron Age, specifically the increasing ambiguity with regard to the relationship between the fertility goddess and the tree and a decreased focus on the tree itself. The fact that this seal was unearthed from a stratum dated to the mid-eleventh to mid-tenth centuries BCE accords well with our understanding of this change. A particular point of interest is that it was unearthed outside Israel in Geshur, suggesting that even in neighbouring areas, the relationship between the tree and the fertility goddess grew weaker during this period. 2. Horned Quadrupeds and a Suckling Animal As mentioned above, the seals of the Middle-Late Bronze Levant often depicted caprids flanking a fertility goddess or a tree (fig. 3). 15 However, as the image of a goddess ceased to appear throughout the Iron Age I (figs. 4a-b), the seals began to depict quadrupeds with a suckling animal standing alone (figs. 4c-d). The species of the quadrupeds is indeterminable, suggesting that the primary purpose was the depiction of the very act of suckling, not of attending animals. In the absence of a central figure, quadrupeds no longer had to be symmetri- cally drawn; thus, they were more freely arranged, in some cases depicted one above the other. At the same time, seals depicting only one quadruped, often with a scorpion, became more common (figs. 4e-f). The motif of a cow with a suckling calf, which became common in Syria in the third millennium BCE (cf. Keel 1980; Ornan 2005: 161-162), 16 appears to have become conflated with the caprid motif during this period.17 Throughout the Iron Age I, the depiction of a maternal quadruped turning her head to look back, simi- lar to that of a cow from the Bronze Age tradition, gradually transitioned into the depiction of a maternal animal turning her head to look ahead. While seals depict- ing a lone quadruped with a young began to appear at the onset of the Iron Age II, 14 While acknowledging that the goddess ceased to be represented in an anthropo- morphical manner, Shuval (1990: 110), in accordance with I. Singer, argues that the tree continued to signify a goddess. There is, however, no archaeological evidence for this argument, as discussed below. 15 Both the figure of a caprid and that of a calf suckling were commonly used as symbols of Ishtar in Syria from the beginning of the second millennium BCE (Van Buren 1945: 36; cf. Keel 1980: 100-108). 16 This theme continued into the first millennium BCE, particularly in ivory carvings (cf. Herrmann, Coffey and Laidlaw 2004). 17 Oman (2005: 161) also suggests that they represent the same concept: abundance. This may account for the ambiguity regarding the species of animals depicted.</page><page sequence="9">STAMP SEAL EXCAVATED AT TEL CEN GEV 17 depictions of a quadruped without its young became more common throughout this period (e.g., fig. 4g). These changes reflect the separation of symbolic figures of fertility and bless- ings from the concept of a goddess or of femininity. With the disappearance of the young, the sex of the quadruped became ambiguous, allowing for the depiction of large crescent-shape horns to give an impression of masculinity.18 Keel and Uelinger (1998: 141) have suggested that these changes reflect the loss of a direct connection between the figure and a goddess, to the point that only 'the sphere of the goddess' remained. Our seal depicts horned quadrupeds facing one another and standing on either side of a tree of a degenerated form. The symmetrical design of this seal, along with the depiction of a degenerated tree, suggests that it is a product of an early stage of the loss of a direct connection between figures and goddess. At the same time, the depiction of a large, horned quadruped with a young standing independ- ently from the other figures suggests that the symbol of fertility and blessings had already shifted from that of the tree to the suckling animal. The fact that this quad- ruped was drawn as a sole motif suggests that the animal no longer served as an object for receiving blessings from the tree, but that it had its own significance. Its forward-looking head and large crescent-shaped horns are further indications of its stylistic departure from the iconographical tradition of the Late Bronze Age. Further change is reflected by the depiction of another quadruped on the right side of the tree in a manner that breaks the principle of symmetry. The different directions in which the horns and tails of these quadrupeds point and the indetermi- nate nature of their species suggest that they are no longer closely related to the tree. 3. The Scorpion After initially appearing in the Late Bronze Age, the scorpion became an increas- ingly common motif during the Iron Age I (Shuval 1990: 103-110, esp. 105). According to Shuval, conoid seals with a scorpion design became predominant during the Iron Age I and lasted until the end of the Iron Age IIB (the eighth century BCE) in Israel and until the second century BCE in Phoenicia. Although the scorpion was depicted alone on a few early Iron Age seals, it was more commonly drawn together with an animal holding its young. The most common animal was a horned quadruped, such as a caprid or a bovine, although on a few seals, a lion and even a human being were depicted (Shuval 1990: nos. 59-63). While the scorpion ceased to be depicted during the Iron Age IIB, the depiction of the animals continued (Shuval 1990: 105). Zernecke (2008) demonstrates that the scorpion was a symbol of Išhara, the goddess of sexuality and fertility in Mesopotamia. She often appears with Ištar, but is identified with Scorpius, rather than with Venus. Zernecke (2008: 117) 18 Keel (1990) and Staubli (2009) use the term 'bovine', rather than cow or bull.</page><page sequence="10">1 8 DAVID T. SUGIMOTO shows that Scorpius was a constellation announcing the autumn equinox and the time of the first rain. This applied to both the Greek world and Mesopotamia, and therefore, it symbolises fertility (see Civil 1994; Hunger and Pingree 1989: 113, 116). Staubli (2009) points out that the scorpion engraved on the conoid seals reflects the constellation Scorpius rather than the animal itself because the depic- tions seldom appear below the quadrupeds in a realistic position, but are generally over or in front of them. They are often drawn in a vertical direction, sometimes along with astral discs. The combination of caprid and scorpion had a long tradi- tion in northern Syria, and Staubli (2009: 617) suggests that this tradition was introduced on limestone conoid seals in Israel through the haematite and quartz seals of northern Syrian provenance during the Iron Age I.19 As discussed above, after the figure of a fertility goddess had been replaced with that of a stylised tree at the beginning of the Iron Age, it was further replaced by that of a quadruped holding a suckling animal. The scorpion probably func- tioned as a symbol of fertility and blessings together with the stylised tree, even after the disappearance of the fertility goddess. Although in Mesopotamia the scorpion was a symbol of Išhara, it is far from clear whether it was related to a fertility goddess in Iron Age I/IIA Israel, especially in view of the loss of connec- tion of the tree symbolism with a goddess (see Staubli 2009: 626). The icon of a scorpion may have become a simple symbol of fertility or blessings, just like the stylised tree. As the focus shifted from the tree to the quadruped, the figure of the scorpion also disappeared during the Iron Age IIB. This shift indicates the loss of the concepts of the goddess and femininity from the figure of fertility and blessings and, in Israel, the likely absorption of these concepts by that of Yahweh (cf. Gen. 2:9; 3:24; Hos. 14:9 [8 ET]).20 The figure of the scorpion can thus be understood as a symbol of these concepts during the intermediate stage in a manner similar to that of the stylised tree. Our seal's depiction of two scorpions in front and above the quadruped, in conjunction with the depiction of the degenerated form of the tree, suggests that it 19 According to Staubli (2009: 617), '[m]ost likely the Northern Syrian motive [sic] entered the repertoire of the local brown-limestone-workshop via a group of hematite and quartz seals from the 1 1 th- 1 0th cent. BC of Northern Syrian provenance'. He particularly discusses the case of Akko, where both types of seals are found, as an example of such contacts. 20 It is of interest that Yahweh is the one who blesses and curses (*pN^ nrurwi yùbx 'the increase of your cattle and the issue of your flock') in Deut. 7:13; 28:4,18,51. The use of the terms seems to suggest that the deities Segar and Astarte were responsible for the fertility of cattle and flock at some stage in the history of this area, but that that role was absorbed by Yahweh. We do not know exactly when this change occurred, but it is possible that the loss of connection between the scorpion and the tree symbol- isms and a fertility goddess already reflects the beginning of this process.</page><page sequence="11">STAMP SEAL EXCAVATED AT TEL CEN GEV 1 9 was produced at a time when traditional LB expressions of fertility remained prevalent. At the same time, the focus on the scorpion, reflecting the disappear- ance of the goddess, indicates that the seal belongs to the intermediate stage, which retained the vocabulary of LB symbolic expressions while assigning new meanings to them. CONCLUSION The analysis of the form and material of the seal under discussion indicates that it reflects a local style common in the southern Levant during the Iron Age I and IIA, although it is larger than most other seals. Iconographically, however, it employs fertility symbols other than that of the goddess common on local MB-LB artefacts. This divergence reflects the cultural influence of northern Syria (see Sugimoto 2010b). Such a change in iconography indicates the emergence of a new religious atmosphere during the Iron Age I and IIA in the Levant, as has been suggested by several scholars (Keel and Uelinger 1998: 125; see also Keel 1990: 415-417; Knauf 1988). Indeed, the disappearance of the figure of the goddess and the focus on the figures of the tree and the scorpion indicates a decline in the importance accorded to her role in granting fertility and blessings. The situation in which horned quad- rupeds further replaced these symbols may have been suited to the establishment of Yahwistic monotheism in Israel. However, this phenomenon was not limited to Israel, but is also observed in the surrounding areas, including Geshur. As such, it reflects the great change that took place in the Canaanite religious worldview in various eastern Mediterranean areas at the beginning of the Iron Age.
