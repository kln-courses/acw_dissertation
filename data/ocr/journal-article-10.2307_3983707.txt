"I want to be a nature writer," Loren Eise- ley declared as a youth, adding, "it is my duty to do what I can to make people realize that the wild creature has just as much right to live as you or I" (The Lost Notebooks of Loren Eiseley, p. 14). Judging by the pro- fusion in bookstores these days of new (and old) works of nature writing, many authors have experienced a similar urge to speak on behalf of the rights of nature. The popularity of nature writing today rivals that at the turn of the century, when the books of John Burroughs, Ernest Thompson Seton, and Jack London were best sellers and "nature study" was a fad among middle-class Americans. True, the current resident of the White House is not nearly as involved in the "back-to-nature cult" as was Teddy Roosevelt, himself a highly regarded writer on the outdoors. But in our age of ecological crisis, when Time proclaimed "The Endangered Earth" as "Planet of the Year" for 1988, increasingly more readers are turning to nature writing for information, adventure, and hope. A sure indication of nature writing's renaissance is its tendency toward self- reflection. Consider, for example, the con- siderable attention paid in the most current of the works reviewed here to the distinction between the terms "natural history" and "nature writing, designations that have overlapping as well as distinctive meanings. According to William Beebe in the intro- duction to The Book of Naturalists, "natural history,' broadly defined, is the expression of a general interest in nature. The genre dates as far back as Paleolithic cave paint- ings and thus, along with poetry, is one of our oldest art forms. Natural history ac- quired its modern meaning in the eighteenth century following two developments: the discovery of many New World species of flora and fauna, and the emergence, thanks to Linnaeus, of a standardized scientific nomenclature. By Darwin's time "natural history" had come to mean writing "con- cerned with the observation of living ani- mals and plants in their natural wild state' writing which, like literature, is intended to produce aesthetic and emotional effects but 204 Forest &amp; Conservation History October 1990</page><page sequence="2">"without the slightest deviation from the fundamental concomitant of absolute truth" (p. 87). Natural history enjoyed a heyday from 1750 to 1850, but declined in the latter half of the nineteenth century in the face of in- creased scientific specialization and profes- sionalization, and the shift from fieldwork to laboratory experimentation. Although by 1900 it was no longer recognized as a legiti- mate scientific discipline, natural history has persisted as a literary discipline thanks to the efforts of such naturalists as Aldo Leopold, Rachel Carson, and more recently Stephen Jay Gould and David Quammen. Around the turn of the century, essays by laypersons describing encounters with the natural world proliferated. Francis W. Halsey coined the term "nature writing" to label this literature (in a review essay entitled "The Rise of the Nature Writers" American Monthly Review of Reviews 26 [November 1902]: 567-71). But the term appeared only in the title and was never defined. In 1910 the popular essayist Dallas Lore Sharp elab- orated a more useful list of nature writing's basic elements: attachment to one's home environment, personal interpretation of na- ture, and fidelity to scientific fact ("The Nature Writer," New Outlook 94 [16 April 1910]: 994-1000). Sharp dates the origin of the genre of na- ture writing, if not of the name, to the appearance of Gilbert White's The Natural History of Selbourne (1788), a work noted for the author's intimate familiarity with his local parish. But White, though "perhaps the first naturalist who clothed his observa- tions in a real literary style" (Beebe, p. 47), is really more a natural historian than a nature writer. The great progenitor of na- ture writing as practiced today was Henry David Thoreau. He succeeded in transform- ing natural history into nature writing in three ways: he emphasized the effect of nature on the observer, thus making nature writing overtly autobiographical (a by-product of the nineteenth-century, romantic, egocen- tric view of the world); he engaged in a meticulous study of how past inhabitants had used (and abused) the landscape, thus restoring history to nature study; and, although he was not the first to advocate conservation of natural resources, he con- sistently pleaded for humans to recognize the rights of nature, thus helping advance the evolution of a land ethic. These three key ingredients - autobiogra- phy, environmental history, a land ethic- are artfully melded in the great literary tracts of the conservation movement: Thor- eau's Walden and his entire fourteen-volume Journal, John Muir's My First Summer in the Sierra, Aldo Leopold's A Sand County Almanac, and Edward Abbey's Desert Soli- taire. Also present in all these works is a sense of ecological relationships. More important than an egocentric view of the world is an eco-centric perspective, a knowl- edge of nature's interrelationships gained from years of careful and patient observa- tion in the field. Although "ecology" was not coined as a term until 1866 and was not an established scientific discipline until the twentieth century, like nature writing it was practiced long before it was acknowledged by name. The sixteen works reviewed here indicate the diversity of nature writing as a genre. The regions and ecosystems represented range from arctic tundra to midwestern tall- grass prairie to southern subtropical forest; the authors' tones run the gamut from stud- ied reserve to outraged polemic. All testify to the adaptability and resiliency of literary interpretations of nature, whatever label one applies to them. According to Beebe, a watershed mark in natural history occurred in the sixteenth century, when naturalists were no longer content to accept speculations about plants and animals without working in the field to test so-called truths (pp. 7-8). Then Lin- naeus brought order and sophistication to scientific nomenclature by providing a two- word Latin name for every living entity. The naturalists William Bartram, Alexander von Humboldt, and John James Audubon were important for their exploration of the Americas. But Beebe dates the origin of modern natural history to Darwin's voyage aboard the Beagle, during which he began to develop his theory of natural selection (p. 94). Beebe's anthology stretches the definition of the genre a bit by including ad- venture writing by twentieth-century English naturalists (much in the style of Heming- way's The Green Hills of Africa). But overall this thick anthology representing forty-six writers nicely illustrates the long and dis- tinguished tradition of natural history. On Nature (first published as volume 57 of Antaeus [Autumn 1986]) is unique among the anthologies reviewed here in collecting essays about as well as of nature writing. Reflecting the interdisciplinary nature of the genre, the collection includes perspectives from anthropologists, naturalists, political scientists, ranchers and farmers, and literary artists and critics. There are essays on in- dividual writers (Edward Hoagland on John Muir); on Native American cultures (Leslie Marmon Silko on the Pueblos, and Keith Basso on the Cibecue Apache); on personal experiences in nature (Richard Nelson in the Arctic, Robert Finch on Cape Cod, Gretel Ehrlich in Wyoming); and on the genre itself (Ann Zwinger on the vocation of the natural historian, Noel Perrin on American attitudes toward nature, and John Milton on nature and the American West). The collection as a whole lacks coherence, but this failing simply reflects the nature of nature writing. As John Hay remarks in the opening essay, nature writing is a nebulous genre that invites confusing, even conflicting, definitions. On Nature concludes with two valuable sections: suggestions for further reading by advisory board editors Annie Dillard, Barry Lopez, Edward Hoagland, and other well-known contemporary nature writers; and an extensive bibliography com- piled by Thomas J. Lyon. Of the five anthologies reviewed here, Words for the Wild, edited by Ann Ronald, offers the most thorough coverage of the finest American nature writing. Ranging from transcendentalists Thoreau and Ralph Waldo Emerson to contemporary writers such as Abbey and Lopez, the collection is "a blend of philosophic contemplations, naturalistic descriptions, environmental pleas, idealistic speculations, and down- right feisty arguments" (p. xvii). Ronald errs in stating that nature writing is neither scientific nor polemical (p. xiv) -surely some exemplary works, such as Leopold's Sand County Almanac, contain elements of both. But she acquaints readers with lesser- known writers (Joseph LeConte, Isabella Bird, Harvey Broome) as well as more famous ones, and her introductory remarks to each selection offer important insights. Mary Austin, she notes, was more concerned with the human dimensions of the land than most nature writers, and John Muir represented a significant shift in the style and content of the genre, from lyrical de- scription to adversarial rhetoric in defense of wilderness. Particularly perceptive is Ronald's observation on the works of Joseph Wood Krutch, Dillard, Leopold, and Eiseley: "In almost any landscape, a nature writer can find a kind of wilderness" (p. 168). She concludes with a sample of her own nature writing, which is based on hikes in the desert and mountains. Her field notes from the wilderness lend authority to her critical judgments. In Words from the Land editor Stephen Trimble reveals how fifteen contemporary nature writers transform field notes into polished prose about encounters with the natural world. The focus here is on nature writers as writers, not "environmentalists" or "naturalists," labels many of the authors themselves eschew. New faces are intro- duced -Gary Nabhan, an ethnobotanist from Arizona, and Sue Hubbell, a beekeeper from the Ozarks of Arkansas-as well as familiar ones: Abbey, Wendell Berry, Dillard, Hoagland, Lopez, John McPhee, and Zwinger. Many diverse habitats and regions Review Essay 205</page><page sequence="3">are represented, but all the writing shares a concern for a land ethic, the responsibility, in Lopez's words, of presenting "a moral, dignified, decent way of living in the world with regard to other peoples, and with re- gard to the landscape" (p. 28). Like the other editors whose volumes are considered here, Trimble is not as careful as he should be in using the terms "natural history" and "nature writing;' but this work is a valuable introduction to the contemporary scene and should spur novices to read the full works of the book's contributors. This Incomperable Lande, edited by Thomas Lyon, is the most recent anthology and also the best. In addition to an exhaust- ive annotated bibliography of both primary and secondary works, Lyon offers a valu- able taxonomy of nature writing, breaking the genre down into seven different categories and offering illustrative examples of each: field guides (books in the Peterson series); natural history essays (Muir's Studies in the Sierra); rambles (Dillard's Pilgrim at Tinker Creek); solitude and backcountry living (Walden); travel and adventure (William Bartram's Travels); farm life (Crevecoeur's Letters from an American Farmer); and man's role in nature (Krutch's The Great Chain of Life). In the ninety-one-page intro- duction, Lyon makes two particularly im- portant points about nature writing's con- tribution to American culture: the genre represents "an awakening of perception to an ecological way of seeing" (p. xiv), and it has extended the idea of democracy by call- ing for a biocentric view of the world. As with all anthologies there are regrettable omissions -particularly egregious is the absence of Austin, Leopold, and Eiseley. But perhaps this was a necessary price for Lyons's apparent intention to include less- anthologized writers such as Alexander Wilson, Liberty Hyde Bailey, and Donald Culross Peattie. All in all, Lyon has distin- guished himself as one of the foremost authorities on nature writing, and I predict this anthology will define the terms of the discussion about the subject for years to come. With the exception of On Nature, none of the anthologies considers the relationship between Native Americans and their natural environments. This is a significant oversight, because many nature writers, George Bird Grinnell and Seton to name just two, have studied various tribes and praised, even mythologized, them for their self-sustaining relationship with nature. To move beyond the anthologies to works by individual authors, consider Thoreau's The Maine Woods, the most ethnographic of his works, recently made available by Penguin Books' Nature Library under the general editorship of Edward Hoagland. As a naturalist Thoreau sought to combine the "savage's" intimate knowledge of nature with the poet's sensitivity to language. The three essays comprising the book are based on Thoreau's 1846, 1853, and 1857 trips to the last large remnant of bona fide wilder- ness in the northeastern United States. Critics often chided Thoreau for celebrating wildness in the thoroughly civilized land- scape of Concord, but Thoreauvians know that he confronted a true wilderness in Maine. In attempting to climb Mount Katahdin, Thoreau wrote of "Vast, Titanic, inhuman Nature" (p. 85) where he was reminded of "how exceedingly new this country is" (p. 109). Over the years his atti- tude toward the Maine wilds matured and grew more complex. On the 1853 trip he specifically sought an Indian guide "mainly that I might have an opportunity to study his ways" (p. 128). Of course, by the mid- nineteenth century the Indians of the North- east were thoroughly assimilated and the vast coniferous forests were already under siege by logging companies. The latter development prompted Thoreau to ask, "What kind of forest warden is the Public itself?" (p. 197). He concludes the "Chesu- nook" essay with a call for "national pre- serves" to protect "the raw material of all our civilization" for "inspiration and our own true recreation" (pp. 211-12). The final essay, "The Allegash and East Branch, tells of his longest and most satisfying trip, with the Indian guide Joe Pollis. On this trip he felt he "had at last got into the wilderness" (p. 282). Skeptics should turn to this work for proof that Thoreau fared well in the wild. Another who fared well in the wild was John Muir, perhaps the wild's most consist- ently euphoric human inhabitant. Muir made Yosemite Valley his base camp for most of the 1869-73 period, frequently em- barking on excursions to the Sierra Nevada for as long as six weeks at a time and carry- ing only matches, a sack of meal, and some tea. My First Summer in the Sierra, first pub- lished in 1911, tells of Muir's saunterings in the Range of Light during the summer of 1869. Unlike Thoreau, who immersed him- self in Indian lore, Muir concentrated on the geology of the valley. He proved that glaciers, not flood waters (as the conven- tional scientific wisdom of the day held), had carved out the U-shaped drainages, and took the glacial evidence as proof, in his own version of the argument from de- sign, of God's existence. Nature became his religion, and so he considered the wilder- ness to be sacred. Muir was also an ecolo- gist before his time, and I disagree with Gretel Ehrlich's claim that "Muir's later work as a conservationist, though immensely important, seems almost an afterthought" (p. xv). On the contrary, it was but a short intellectual leap from Muir's recognition of ecological relationships in Yosemite to his recognition of the destruction wrought by human activities. As a sheepherder, the occupation that provided him with the opportunity to journey into the high coun- try, Muir witnessed the harmful effects of overgrazing. In the 1890s, when he headed the newly formed Sierra Club and had be- come a nationally known secular prophet of the conservation movement, he lobbied for the expansion of Yosemite's national park boundaries to eliminate grazing and urged the federal government to resume control of the valley, which it had rescinded to the state of California in 1864. But Muir's vision was wider than the Yosemite Valley, as is evident in his statement: "When we try to pick out anything by itself, we find it hitched to everything else in the universe" (p. 157). One of Muir's regrettable blind spots was his view of the Miwok and Digger Indians he encountered in Yosemite, whom he de- scribed as "unclean' and "degraded." This was a failing not duplicated by Mary Austin, another California nature writer. At the turn of the century Austin lived on the east slope of the Sierra near the town of Inde- pendence, and she based The Land of Little Rain on the cultivation of an intimate rela- tionship with the land and its inhabitants. Marveling at the Shoshone and Paiute use of creosote to cement arrowheads to shafts, she writes: "Trust Indians not to miss any virtues of the plant world!" (p. 7). A recur- rent theme in The Land of Little Rain is the need for long inhabitation of a place in order to achieve familiarity with it: "One must summer and winter with the land and wait for its occasions. Pine woods that take two or three seasons to the ripening of cones, roots that lie by in the sand seven years awaiting a growing rain, firs that grow fifty years before flowering-these do not scrape acquaintance" (p. xvi). Austin's work is one of the most eloquent expressions of inhabiting a wild landscape in the nature- writing tradition. Less wild, but no less interesting, was the landscape of John Burroughs, who lived in atid wrote about the Hudson Valley from 1873 to 1920. Burroughs has fallen out of vogue in this era of wilderness preservation; his terrain was relatively tame and on camp- ing trips he readily confessed to being a fas- tidious greenhorn. Nonetheless the Smith- sonian Institution has rendered a valuable service in making available an anthology of his best essays. Editor Frank Bergon points out that Burroughs "wrote no sustained masterpiece, no Walden, no Selbourne, but during a writing career of over sixty years he achieved recognition as the dean of American nature writers" (p. 9 ). Burroughs's 206 Forest &amp; Conservation History October 1990</page><page sequence="4">sunny outlook was a welcome antidote in an age noted for pessimism spawned by evolutionary theory. While natural and social scientists were stressing "the survival of the fittest; "Gentle John of Slabsides" (his literary retreat) converted many readers to nature study with comforting, idyllic essays on bird behavior. In the tradition of Gilbert White and Thoreau, he popularized literary phenology (the study of periodic biological phenomena such as flowering, migration, and nesting) and became the genius loci of upstate New York. "Nature comes home to one most when he is at home;' he maintained. "The place to observe nature is where you are; the walk to take today is the walk you took yesterday. You will not find just the same things: both the observed and the observer have changed" (p. 336). Burroughs also emphasized the naturalist's credo of absolute fidelity to fact, criticizing fellow nature writers such as Seton as "nature-fakers" for failing to adhere to strict scientific standards when reporting animal behavior. But he himself was frequently guilty of anthropomorphiz- ing, and the sentimentality of his writing is another reason he has fared less successfully today than his contemporary Muir. The twentieth century has been marked by the emergence of nature writers with formal scientific training. Yet it is noteworthy that biologist Sigurd Olson and forester Aldo Leopold, two of the most prominent original members of the Wilderness Society, both developed their love of nature through hunt- ing and fishing as youths. Olson became the spokesperson for the North Woods, a mod- ern voyageur who exploited the region not for economic but for aesthetic, scientific, and cultural reasons. Some readers of Olson's early letters, stories, and essays may be appalled (as are many who read Leopold's Round River) by his recurrent urge to kill. Indeed his work represents a subgenre of nature writing, "hook and bullet literature" Setonlike stories of arctic owls and timber wolves de- signed to provide ecological information in the engaging style of the adventure tale. But in spite of Olson's fascination for the hunt, he must be considered an early conserva- tionist. Like many modern nature writers, Olson became a conservationist in response to what he felt was a failure of duty on the part of a government agency entrusted with the stewardship of public land. The target of Olson's wrath was the U.S. Forest Service, which wished to build roads in Minnesota's Superior National Forest to provide better access for fire suppression. Olsen protested that in the long run roads would attract tourists and development, thus destroying the wilderness character of the region. Editor Mike Link's assessment that "the texts are not polished, the philosophy is not refined" (p. xxix) is generally accurate, but this vol- ume allows students of the conservation movement to trace the intellectual growth of one of its leaders. Like Olson, Aldo Leopold devoted the early part of his career to the extermination of predators, particularly wolves. In A Sand County Almanac, Leopold acknowledges the error of his ways. The title of one essay, "Thinking Like a Mountain;' demonstrates that over time Leopold had come to think ecologically, in terms of the entire ecosystem rather than merely about individual organ- isms. In commemoration of the 1987 centen- nial of Leopold's birth, Oxford University Press reprinted the Almanac (originally published in 1949) with a new and superb introduction by the naturalist Robert Finch. Finch points to two reasons for the popu- larity of this work, which has sold more than one million copies and become the Bible of the conservation movement. First, whatever landscape Leopold studied, his writing about it "resonate[s] with a sense of change and history" (p. xvii); he proved himself an expert on the use and abuse of the American landscape. Second, the style of the Almanac is a wonderful melding of science and poetry. One example of the rich prose shall suffice: "A dawn wind stirs on the great marsh. With almost imperceptible slowness it rolls a bank of fog across the wide morass. Like the white ghost of a gla- cier the mists advance, sliding across bog- meadows heavy with dew. A single silence hangs from horizon to horizon" (p. 95). Leopold's introduction to conservation came when his family purchased eighty acres of abandoned farmland in southern Wisconsin, intending to restore stability to the land by planting trees and recreating a remnant of the tall-grass prairie, an eco- system almost extinct in the Midwest. The experience taught Leopold firsthand that the responsibility of promoting conservation lay not with the "alphabetical agencies" of the government (such as the CCC), but with the individual landowner. The first part of the Almanac is a literary phenology based on over a decade's observations of the local Wisconsin ecosystem; the second part com- prises various essays reporting on land sick- ness and health in areas ranging from Mex- ico to Canada; and the third part consists of four essays that amount to a cultural cri- tique of American land abuse. The final essay, "The Land Ethic;' is a landmark in conservation thought because of its call for the extension of ethics to include "soils, waters, plants, and animals, or collectively: the land" (p. 204). As Finch notes in the introduction, all the essays shine "not only with the integrity and perception of the au- thor's thought, but with the force of having lived what they propose" (p. xxvii). Another offering in the Penguin Nature Library is Driftwood Valley (1946) by Theodora Stanwell-Fletcher, a hitherto ob- scure work, which tells of the wildest, most remote terrain inhabited by any author re- viewed here. From 1937 to 1939 and again for nine months in 1941, Stanwell-Fletcher and her husband, both professionally trained naturalists, lived in a cabin they built them- selves in northern British Columbia. Their ostensible purpose was to study the native animals and to collect specimens (doing so the old-fashioned way, that is, by shooting them), but their primary goal was to live as pioneers in a valley where much of the sur- rounding terrain was veritable terra incog- nita, and the nearest town was two hundred miles away. So familiar a part of the land- scape do they become that by the end of their stay wolves and moose stray within sight of their cabin. As the author explains, "We lived in the wilderness just as the Indians did, subsisted on it almost entirely, [and] used the same mode of traveling and camp- ing in all seasons" (p. xvii). She records a high compliment paid by one of the Indians with whom they traded: "You live like us, see? All the time you do same like we do. You know. Other white men he not live like us. He not know, see?" (p. xvii). At one point she complains that the reading material she has brought, the works of the romantic poets, isn't sufficiently wild -so she invents her own authentic wilderness literature. The work belongs to the subgenre of women's frontier narratives, and Stanwell-Fletcher makes valuable observations on gender- based work roles and the differences be- tween men's and women's responses to the wilderness. As I have mentioned, the reputation of a nature writer often rests on how well he or she relates scientific facts in literary style. The Lost Notebooks of Loren Eiseley estab- lishes once again Eiseley's ability to see as a scientist and write like a poet. An anthro- pologist by training, Eiseley made evolution an important theme in his nature writing; the poet Howard Nemerov once remarked that Eiseley saw time as directly as most of us see space (p. 220). Eiseley avoids the more strident polemics of the environmental movement, but as this collection of journal entries, letters (to and from correspondents), poetry, and fiction demonstrates, his writing nonetheless expresses a passionate concern for all forms of life. A devotee of Thoreau, Eiseley shared the Concord naturalist's fas- cination with mysticism in nature, which earned both of them ridicule in scientific circles. Also like Thoreau, he proved that nature writing could occur in any setting - Review Essay 207</page><page sequence="5">a glade in a forest, the site of an archae- ological dig, a backyard, even outside a hotel room in an anonymous city. Eiseley responded to charges of anthropomorphism by stating that not to anthropomorphize is to deny one's own humanity. His one great fear was "that man will ruin the planet before he departs" (p. 210). Another pessimist was Edward Abbey, who once said, "If enlightenment fails, we always have the traditional solution - disaster-to fall back upon" (quoted by Russell Martin, "Writers of the Purple Sage' The New York Times Magazine, 27 [De- cember 1981]: 42). In contrast to Eiseley, Abbey's trademark was stridency. Of his nineteen books of fiction and essays, the best remains Desert Solitaire, which has just been republished by the University of Arizona Press in a twentieth-anniversary edition. Disclaiming the label "nature writer," Abbey states that "the few such writers whom I wholly admire are those, like Thoreau, who went far beyond simple nature writing to become critics of society, of our modern industrial culture.... It is not enough to understand nature;' he goes on to say, "the point is to save it" (p. 13). In Desert Solitaire Abbey's target is the Park Service, which was promoting "industrial tourism" at Arches National Monument in Utah, where Abbey worked as a ranger. Abbey responded to what literary critic Leo Marx termed "the machine in the garden" with acts of "ecotage": uprooting survey stakes marking the route of a proposed paved road that would attract more visitors in motor vehicles. Although futile, his words inspired the creation of a radical environmen- tal group, Earth First!, whose slogan is "No compromise in defense of Mother Earth." Brimming with defiance against the estab- lishment, Desert Solitaire is the great con- servation document of the counterculture era. Abbey's death in March 1989 prompted widespread eulogies, testifying to his exalted status as a galvanizing force within the en- vironmental community. There is a striking contrast between the styles of Abbey-humorous, polemical, outlandish - and Barry Lopez - somber, reserved, philosophical. Lopez's Crossing Open Ground is a collection of previously published essays. Lopez writes best when rooted in the specifics of a place, as in "The Stone Horse;" which recounts his visit to the site of an enormous intaglio in the Mojave Desert. Here, the thesis is eloquently ex- pressed: those who would vandalize such sites are destroyers of history. But in other essays the profundity seems a bit forced. "Landscape and Narrative" is a nebulous, incoherent piece that fails to deal intensively with the supposed basis of the piece- Alaskan narrative and Navaho tales -and instead delivers a panegyric on the impor- tance of storytelling in all cultures. Lopez frequently cites Native American cultures as a model from which Anglo-Americans might learn a great deal about living ecologically. In "The Passing Wisdom of Birds" the de- struction of the Aztec aviary by the soldiers of Hernando Cortes's army becomes "not simply an image of a kind of destructive madness that lies at the heart of imperialistic conquest, . . . [but] also a symbol of a long-term failure of Western civilization to recognize the intrinsic worth of the American landscape" (p. 197). Lopez feels the most pressing problem facing modern culture is the quest for "a viable natural philosophy" (p. 199). He would achieve this by establish- ing naturalist positions at all universities and by making classic works of natural his- tory available to the general public. Bulow Hammock by David Rains Wallace tells of the author's return to his boyhood haunts in the subtropical forests of Florida. In addition to chronicling the transformation of wilderness wetlands into suburban sub- divisions, Wallace pursues two other impor- tant themes: the evolution of humans from tree- into savannah-dwelling creatures, and the importance of William Bartram's travels through the wetlands region from 1773 to 1777. Wallace is very conscious of the rich tradition of Southern natural history out of which he writes. Unlike Audubon and Muir, who both confessed at times to a certain be- wilderment in the tropical tangles, Bartram consistently rhapsodized over the riot of exotic life he encountered. His was "a way of perceiving the natural world that had little historical precedent" (p. 128). Exploring Florida by canoe and on foot, Wallace gradu- ally familiarizes himself with the surround- ings, transforming hostile space into friendly place (a useful distinction Gaston Bachelard draws in The Poetics of Space). He con- cludes that though Bulow Hammock has been constricted by development, it can still be regarded with Bartram's sense of wonder. Wonder at the wild is characteristic of all good nature writing. From Bartram to Wallace, nature writers have made it their mission to instill in readers their own sense of elation in discovering and exploring the mysteries of nature. Thoreau's remark on the "forest of books in our rear" still obtains today, when the literature of the wilderness is larger than ever before. But thanks in part to nature writers, portions of the physi- cal wilderness, which Thoreau feared would be lost, survive. As Thomas Lyon observes, the genre "does not command much respect in critical circles" (p. xiii). But perhaps such respect is not its primary aim. In seeking to reform attitudes toward the land, nature writers intend to create a potentially revolu- tionary genre. Their hope is that nature writ- ing will someday "provide the foundation for a reorganization of American political thought" (Lopez, Antaeus, p. 297). Reviewed by Don Scheese.
