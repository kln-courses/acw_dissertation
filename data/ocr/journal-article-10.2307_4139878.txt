Whitney Sanford Contemporary Braj practice regarding yaksa worship invites us to recon- sider notions of the interaction between the hegemonic Krishna-Gopal complex and the local traditions absorbed into this tradition. Practices comprising the naga-yaksa-Balarama continuum offer a counterpoint to the pastoral Krishna tradition that became dominant in the sixteenth century. Yaksas present an interesting test case, because, in contrast to Balarama-Sesa, they were not absorbed into Vaisnavism. Scholars and Vaisnava Brahmins have consistently privileged the pastoral Krishna as the center of the circle. However, attention to yaksa practices offers a re- visioning of the center-periphery image that has dominated Braj thought and necessitates a re-conceptualization of the relationships between these traditions. This article focuses our attention on contemporary yaksa worship to re-map the landscape to reflect these multiple circles. These multiple circles will more accurately represent the dialectical and mutually interdependent relationships between the different traditions in Braj.

Most devotees see Krishna and his elder brother Balarama as simple cowherd boys living in an idyllic Braj, and this pastoral con- struct has determined devotional and scholarly approaches to Braj practice. Devotional and scholarly approaches have esteemed the more abstract devotional practices in Braj and been less concerned with local practices that deal with practical human matters. I argue that the pastoral con- struct has been assumed by scholars to be hegemonic. Instead, I show that this predominance is challenged by contemporary yaksa practices that involve practical human concerns such as protection and healing. To do this I examine the pastoral as the hegemonic paradigm of Braj to show how this discourse imposed a system of inclusion and exclusion and thus relegated certain Braj practices to the margins. I argue that this hierarchy between the devotional Krishna tradition and yaksa practices reveals a dialectic between religion as dealing with human concerns and religion as devotion. I will discuss aspects of contemporary yaksa practice in Braj because the very existence and nature of contemporary yaksa practice calls into question the hegemony of Krishna devotion. Although scholars and practitioners certainly acknowledge the exist- ence of devotion toward nagas (serpent-like semi-divine beings), yaksas (semi-divine beings associated with trees), and forms of the Goddess, these practices have been understood as peripheral and somehow extra- neous to the dominant Krishna tradition. What we will see is that yaksa practices are anything but marginal, and, in fact, the practices associated with nagas, the Goddess, and yaksas are structurally necessary for Krishna devotion in Braj. Yak.sa practice, in particular that related to healing, suggests that the historic guardian role assumed by naga and yaksa figures continues to occupy a critical position in Braj practice and exists in a creative, though competitive, tension with Krishna devotion. Attention to yaksa practices offers a re-visioning of the center-periphery image that has dominated Braj thought and necessitates a re-conceptual- ization of the relationships between these traditions that is perhaps more fluid and emphasizes their interdependence. This scrutiny of the per- ceived Krishna hegemony in Braj has theoretical implications that extend beyond Braj and suggests, when viewing competing traditions, we must question mappings of center and periphery. The group that determines the rules usually wins the game; in this case, calling Krishna the center has made it so. None could seriously dispute that devotion to Krishna is of over- whelming importance to the religious landscape of Braj. Krishna devotion (bhakti) is one of several forms of Vaisnavism, the worship of the deity Visnu in one of his descents (avatdrs). Like Visnu's other descents,</page><page sequence="3">Sanford: Yaksas on the Margins of Contemporary Practice 91 Krishna descended from the heavens when the earth and her denizens needed help. He and his elder brother Balarama took birth in Braj to kill the tyrant Kamsa who ruled in the nearby city Mathura. Braj devotion highlights Krishna's childhood and youth when he was a cowherd living in the forested Braj and, significantly, does not emphasize Krishna's adulthood after he and Balarama leave Braj to assume their regal and martial heritage. Devotees of Krishna emphasize his youth as a cowherd boy in the idyllic Braj and hope to form an emotional relationship with Krishna by assuming the persona of a friend, parent, or lover of Krishna. This form of Vaisnavism that advocated a passionate attachment to the cowherd Krishna flourished in the Braj region in the sixteenth century as pilgrims and travelers from the east and south carried these ideas to Braj. Caitanya (1486-1534) and Vallabh (1479-1586) founded the two major devotional communities of the sixteenth century, respectively, Gaujdiya Vaisnavism and the Vallabh Sampradaya. Although elite Brahmins established and dominated these newly formed devotional communities, Krishna devotion soon became popular among all social levels. Leaders of these communities (or their representatives) established shrines and identified Braj sites as significant for Krishna worship. Much of this topography, however, had been-and often is-significant for local ndga and yaksa practice. This new form of Krishna devotion had to contend with long established and deeply entrenched local traditions such as naga and yaksa worship, and thus ensued a process in which Krishna devotees reinterpreted local sites and practices according to the new idioms of this pastoral Krishna devotion. On the surface, this process appears to be highly successful: after all, Braj has become virtually synonymous with Krishna devotion. Yet, if we resist following this paradigm uncritically and reject a model of center and periphery, an entirely new landscape of Braj practice emerges. Moreover, we see that worship of nagas and yaksas were-and continue to be-important elements of Braj practice. Archaeological records suggest that Mathura became an urban center in the Saka-Kusana period and was a popular pilgrimage destination for devotees of these competing cults (Chattopadhyaya: 36). In the period prior to and during the Kusana period (100 B.C.E.-100 C.E.), nagas, yaksas, and forms of the goddess were integrated into the developing Vaisnava tradition. Ndgas and yaksas are a pan-Indian phenomenon, but, despite their ubiquitous presence, nagas and yaksas are above all local beings and articulate local concerns. Their influence extends throughout bounded regions (caityas), and in these regions they wield great power. Both are connected with notions of kingship, particularly in connection with the areas for which</page><page sequence="4">92 Journal of the American Academy of Religion they are responsible (Falk: 3-5).2 The arboreal yaksas are typically associated with trees and forests, and the nagas reside in the watery nether-regions known as pdtdla. Nagas and yaksas can be classed generically as devatds (godlings or semi-divine beings). Many ndga and yak.sa figures derive from heroic human figures who later became deified, and we will see this theme of protection and guardianship continued into the present.3 Ndgas and yaksas are typically represented in anthropomorphic form, although naga figures might also have a serpent's tail and/or a cobra's hood extending above the head. Supplicants typically invoke nagas and yaksas for protection of some sort, that is, healing, protection from illness and mental distur- bance, as well as the acquisition of wealth; for example, the chief of the yaksas is Kubera, the guardian of the earth's treasures. Kubera is the regent of the north and guards the earth's stores of gems and jewels. Generally, yaksas assume responsibility for the social world, and nagas deal with the natural world (although their boundaries overlap and there is more similarity than difference). For example, nagas control natural phenomena such as water, agriculture, and fertility and are said to be irascible and fond of drink, whereas yaksas are connected to social phenomena such as wealth or gover- nance. Despite their protective stance, yaksas and ndgas can be petulant and, if so inclined, are likely to withdraw their favors as easily as they bestow them. It is precisely these qualities, their roughness, their love of money, and protective stance-and perhaps their pique-that have determined their peripheral status in Krishna's bucolic Braj. Threats and supplication, disease and greed have no role in the idealized pastoral construct wherein there can be neither fear of disease nor the need for money. Although Krishna devotion centers on arousing emotion (bhava) for Krishna and establishing an intimate relationship between devotee and deity, practices involving nagas and yaksas, for example, focus on protection and healing and recapitulate their traditional connections to kingship and do not fit into the pastoral ethos. This pastoral structure provides a tenuous balance in Braj practice: specifically, although idealized forms of Krishna and brother Balarama (and Radha) operate primarily within the devotional context of bhava, local deities such as the nigas and yaksas target practical 2 For example, the Buddhist Jataka tales describe numerous instances in which the local yaksa or the power of the king (Bloss: 38-39). 3 Social groups identified as nagas and yaksas also ruled in the Mathura area. This has caused some confusion between the devatas and these actual rulers, and their worshippers do not clearly distinguish between devatas as spirits or divinized human heroic figures (Coomaraswamy: 9; Entwistle 1987: 296). (Human) non-aAryan naga kings ruled Mathura in the pre-Gupta era, from the third to fifth centuries C.E. (Vaudeville 1976: 208 n. 39).</page><page sequence="5">Sanford: Yaksas on the Margins of Contemporary Practice 93 concerns such as health, wealth, and fertility. This balance then indicates a system of mutual interdependence rather than center-margin. Why focus on yaksas? Yaksas present an interesting test case because, despite their similarities to nagas, nagas and yaksas are strikingly different in terms of their formal relationship to Vaisnavism. Yaksas-in historical representation and contemporary practice-are similar to ndgas in terms of practice and attributes: the arboreal yaksas parallel the subterranean nagas. Further, both nagas and yaksas have been incorporated into Vaisnavism (and Buddhism and Jainism as well) as adversarial figures whom Krishna must vanquish, suggesting a contentious relationship between these groups. For example, the tenth-century Sanskrit text BhAgavata Purana depicts Krishna and Balarama defeating yaksas who appear in the form of the demon-cowherd Pralamba and the ass Dhenuka. [Yaksas are known as shape-shifters and appear in a variety of guises (Vaudeville 1976: 210-211) ]. Nagas, however, have been absorbed into Vaisnavism through the fig- ure of Balarama; Balarama is the incarnation of the Ses, the cosmic serpent upon whom Visnu rests between incarnations. So, although this investi- gation's objective does not lie in a comparison between niga and yaksa practices, it is important to discuss the ndga tradition because its rela- tionship to Vaisnavism provides a counterpoint to the yaksa tradition. The formal relationship between Vaisnavism and competing local traditions, particularly the ndgas, and to some extent the Goddess, is con- ceived through the image of the (possibly dysfunctional) extended family. The nagas, for example, through Balarama, appear in a sibling relation- ship to Krishna, although the forms of the Goddess manifest-albeit briefly-as Krishna's sister Subadhra (also known as Ekanzamsa) or through his consort Radhd. This familial relationship can be both a description of and a means for incorporating local traditions into hege- monic ones and creates a symbiotic, yet structurally necessary, hierarchical relationship with Krishna, a complex of ideas that I will call an inclusive and symbiotic hierarchy. This familial relationship appears in multiple dimensions (e.g., theological, iconographic, and communal) and pro- vides a flexible structure through which divergent groups and practices can be related to the center, inevitably a form of Krishna. The familial metaphor is an important Vaisnava strategy for dealing with competitors. Yak.sas enjoy a (tenuous and distant) home in the Vaitnava family tree through Laksmi, the goddess of wealth and prosperity, whom most know as Visnu's consort and the queen of Visnu's heaven, Vaikunth. Laksmi has been a central figure in the autumn festival of Divali for over a thousand years; this festival was originally the "night of the yaksas," and Kubera was the patron deity (Entwistle 1987: 282-283).</page><page sequence="6">94 Journal of the American Academy of Religion That a mantra to Kubera is performed during Laksmi worship during Divali indicates Kubera's continued (if veiled) association with Divhli (Schomer: 31). Then and now, Divali is the last night of the (fiscal) year and has been associated with wealth and gambling.4 On the night of Divali, Hindu families leave candles burning all night so that Laksmi-- and thus prosperity-might find her way into their homes. So, although the yaksas might enjoy a tenuous familial relationship 'to Vaisnavism through Laksmi, neither yaksas nor Laksmi fit with the pastoral Braj tra- dition established in the sixteenth-century. Significantly, Laksmi's primary role in the pastoral Krishna devo- tional complex is her notable exclusion from Krishna's Maharasa dance: her regal attributes caused her banishment from Krishna's pastoral realm. On Krishna and Balarama's final night in Braj Krishna danced with each and every one of the cowherd women, fulfilling their desires to have a relationship with Krishna. According to the story of Krishna's final night in Braj, however, Laksmi would not abandon her status as queen for the humble status of cowherding women, and so she could only watch the festivities from across the Yamuna River, the symbolic boundary of Braj. So, whereas the cowherding women (and devotees) often identify this dance as the pinnacle of their relationship with Krishna, Laksmi (Visnu's wife) could not participate. The most telling example of yaksa inclusion into Krishna's childhood life in Braj is Krishna's liberation of Kubera's sons, Manigriva and Nalakubera. Kubera's sons had been appointed attendants to the deity Rudra and soon became quite vain with their new affluence and status. One day they became intoxicated with the wine of Varini, the goddess of wine (it is interesting to note that Balarama enjoyed a similar episode of intoxication). The young men strolled through a pleasure garden with a group of women, then the group bathed and played in the river Ganga. Unfortunately, the sage Narada espied the youths in their state of inebriation. Although the girls were ashamed and quickly donned their clothes, Manigriva and Nalakubera insisted on remaining unclothed. Narada cursed them for their sin of the pride of wealth and transformed them into a pair of arjuna trees. There they would remain for one hundred celestial years until they were in the presence of Vasudeva or Krishna. 4 Coomaraswamy notes Sri-Laksmi's connection to yaksas. Kdmadeva (the deity of love) is son of Sri and, additionally, is the incarnation of Pradyumna, Krishna's son. Some Chinese Buddhist sources describe Sri as the daughter of the yaksa Manibhadra (41 n. 5). Further, Coomaraswamy writes that the Buddhist and Jain traditions consider Pradyumna (through the figure of Kamadeva) a yaksa, thus making Krishna's son a yaksa (49). According to the Harivamrna Purina, Kamadeva is Laksmi's son. He later incarnates as Pradyumna, Krishna's son with Rukmini.</page><page sequence="7">Sanford: Yaksas on the Margins of Contemporary Practice 95 Upon the day of their liberation the mischievous child Krishna had been feeding his mother's (Yasoda) butter to the monkeys. To punish Krishna, the frustrated Yasodd bound him to a mortar. Krishna crawled, dragging the mortar so that it lay between the trees, and, as he crawled, he uprooted the two trees. At that moment, Manigriva and Nalakubera retained their original forms and were freed of their arrogance and vanity. This story reflects the issues at the heart of the pastoral construct. It is clear that this story reveals Krishna's power (one of several) over the yaksas, and Krishna's method of liberation demonstrates the privileging of the pastoral over wealth and acquisition. The two yaksas are penalized for their love of money and pride of status (basically, for being yaksas), two qualities antithetical to the pastoral ethic that valorizes simplicity over social standing and money. A combination of Krishna's childhood mischief and rural implements liberated the pair from their arrogance, not Krishna's later stance as regal heir. Because it has not been absorbed into Vaisnavism in a manner similar to ndgas, yaksa worship bids us to reconsider the dynamics of Braj tradition, particularly in terms of the dynamic interaction between the hegemonic Krishna devotion as established in the sixteenth century and indigenous and local traditions. The sibling pairing of Krishna and Balarama-naga resides at the heart of Braj devotion, yet no yak.sa counterpoint exists. I offer then the following potentially destabilizing image: imagine a bicycle wheel. Krishna is the hub, whereas others are situated on the rim, linked to the center-Krishna-through the spokes. To continue the analogy, the spokes must be balanced, or trued, that is, Krishna retains his pride of place at the center, although these apparently peripheral traditions maintain their spot on the margin, equidistant from the center. Pivoting on the hub allows the wheel to spin smoothly, but if we make any other point the fulcrum, the wheel wobbles and eventually collapses. So, if we accept Krishna as the center, the wheel turns smoothly. But what happens if we choose another point as our center or admit of no center at all? Thus, I argue that re-visioning the yaksa tradition (and that of the naga as well) as central to contemporary Braj practice offers a destabilizing view of Vaisnava hegemony and suggests an image of not one, but multiple, circles. So, in the following, I will first discuss how a pastoral theology of devotion that became popular in Braj in the sixteenth century established a dynamic in which the yaksas were marginalized. The pastoral idioms of the sixteenth century reconfigured relationships between the Vaisnava, ndga, and yaksa traditions. The imposition of the pastoral created a geo- political system with Krishna as the center and relegated yaksas to the margins. Certainly Braj history prior to the sixteenth century reveals</page><page sequence="8">96 Journal of the American Academy of Religion complicated and competitive relationships between Krishna, Balardma, forms of the Goddess, nagas, and yaksas. These relationships have been evolving since, at least, the time of the Buddha when, according to the Pali Anguttaranikiiya, Buddha complained that Mathura (approximately 120 km southwest of Delhi) was overrun by bestial yakkhas (yaksas) and the like (Jaini: 216).5 The continuously changing relationships between the various deities and their patrons indicate the different strategies by which the Vaisnava tradition over centuries dealt with competing cults and issues of inclusion and exclusion. However, because the pastoral dis- course of the sixteenth century so radically changed the nature of these relationships, this analysis will focus on the dynamics of the pastoral hegemony as they occur during and after the sixteenth century. Then, in the final section, I will present two examples of contemporary yaksa practice in Braj that question Krishna's presumed hegemony and suggest that this "marginal" practice is essential to the existence of Krishna devotion. BRAJ DEVOTION AND THE PASTORAL The popular devotion to Krishna and Balarama that swept north India in the sixteenth century articulated a pastoral theology that privileged the urban concerns of the Vaisnava theologians who developed these systems. This pastoral theology centered on the cowherd god had been present in the Tamil regions for at least the previous thousand years. Traders and pilgrims carried it northward, and it eventually assumed a distinctive form in the Braj region. In the centuries prior to the sixteenth century worship of the deities Krishna and Balarama in the Braj region was not particularly important, and devotees and pilgrims worshipped a variety of divine beings, including nagas, Siva, and yaksas (Entwistle 1987: 136). Additionally, prior to the sixteenth century worship of Krishna and Balarama focused on their regal and heroic capacities, as seen in the epic Mahabharata. Until the sixteenth century relationships between the various devotional traditions in Braj were continuously evolving. However, in the sixteenth century a radically altered form of Krishna devotion that focused on Krishna as a delightful cowherd youth (Gopal) eclipsed older 5 The threads that combine to create the figures we see as Krishna and Balarama are fascinating and complex, and thus I can only give a brief overview. In the centuries prior to the common era, three disparate theological strands combined, starting an historical process of amalgamation that would later result in Vaisnavism as it appears in the classical Pur.nas. Vasudeva-Krishna had been linked with the Brahmanic Visnu and the cosmic Vedic deity Ndrayana, and the followers of this consolidated deity were known as Vaisnavas, and worship of Visnu-V sudeva-Krishna-Ndrayana was integrated into the Brahmanical tradition (Banerjea 1945: 61). For more information on this topic, the following resources will be helpful: Banerjea 1945, 1946; Jaiswal; and Raychaudhuri.</page><page sequence="9">Sanford: Yaksas on the Margins of Contemporary Practice 97 forms of Krishna Vaisnavism in Braj, and the pastoral became the hege- monic ideology. That these devotional forms professed an openness to all devotees regardless of social status or gender and used the vernacular contributed to their popular appeal. This passionate devotion to Krishna emphasized homey and idyllic images of Krishna and Balarama rather than heroic images of the brothers defeating demons, thus diminishing the importance of heroic figures and guardianship in Braj Vaisnavism. Certainly, contemporary devotion lauds Krishna and Balarama's defeat of various demons who appeared in Braj, but devotees best love Krishna as a sweet infant or a mischievous and charming youth. Pastoral Krishna Vaisnavism flourished, particularly among urban elite newcomers, and incorporated local Braj traditions, continuing a process of competition with and assimilation of local Braj traditions. And, as we will see, the pastoral set up a discourse through which nagas and yaksas can be relegated to the margins of Braj Vaisnavism. The casting and the staging for this drama valorized an idealized pas- toral setting. The traditional images of Krishna and Balarama-both in scholarship and religious depiction-are routinely portrayed as pastoral. These images assume romantic constructions of the pastoral, that is, simple boys and girls populating an idealized rural landscape (Alpers: 134). Despite the obvious parallels to German romanticism, Braj pastoralization encompasses a different set of conflicts, chiefly the disjuncture created by Balarama's (anomalous) rusticity in relationship to Krishna's rural persona that masks an urban sophistication. I have argued that Balarama's earthy image conveniently frees Krishna to exist in that pastoral ideal in which nature never presents danger and erotic dalliances have no unwanted consequences (Sanford 2000). And I extend this argument to yaksas that they also provide a balance and a vent for forces not reconcilable to the pastoral Braj. This pastoral theology emphasized a sophisticated process of cultivating the emotions, or bhava, toward the youthful Krishna, and the devotee became a kind of actor in a cosmic drama played around Krishna, assuming the emotions appropriate to the particular role. As a new actor in the divine drama of Braj, the devotee forges an emotional bond with Krishna that is based on stylized roles, each of which has been depicted in extenso in the narratives of the Bhagavata Purdna (a tenth-century Sanskrit text that chronicles Krishna's life). The four primary approaches, against which all individual permutations are measured, are called by the Sanskrit names of dasya, sakhya, vatsalya, and mrndhurya.6 Dasya means servitude 6 Some articulate a fifth, Santa, which means "peace" or "repose," but which is often considered not to be a form of love.</page><page sequence="10">98 Journal of the American Academy of Religion and is characterized as similar to the love a servant or subject might have for his or her ruler, a somewhat remote love tinged by fear of retribution resulting in awe, a sensation not particularly satisfying to Krishna as lord. The second is sakhya, which means friendship, based on a relation- ship with Krishna that emphasizes mutuality and equality, where the devotee is a "friend" of Krishna. Third-and this is generally considered as being superior to, but occasionally considered being inferior or at least equal to sakhya - is vitsalya, parental love. The model for this love is, of course, Yasoda, Krishna's foster-mother who nurtures and indulges her darling baby. Last, and at the top of this hierarchical order, is maidhurya, literally denoting the "sweetness" of this love but generally understood to mean the erotic. The erotic mode pairs the devotee as a gopi or the helper of the gopi with Krishna in a full erotic encounter, but the devotee does not seek to be gratified by Krishna, rather quite the opposite (Sanford 2002: 63). An urban elite-mostly theologians from devotional communities associated with Caitanya or Vallabh-imposed an idealized notion of nature upon a non-cooperative reality, setting up privileged hierarchies between rural and urban and sophisticate and rustic. (And the pastoral con- struct is almost always an urban phenomenon.) For the actor to cultivate the emotions relevant to his or her role, the scene and setting (uddipana) play a significant supporting role. So, for example, the image of a moonlit night on the banks of the Yamuna presents a romantic backdrop for the devotee who cultivates the emotional stance as Krishna's beloved. Culti- vating these emotional states requires an idealized view of nature, a natural world that adheres to the rules of the pastoral. Braj pastoral theology assumes that the elements of the natural world, for example, the water, the wind, the trees, and the animals, are themselves devotees of Krishna and thus provide an environment conducive to devotion. So, for example, this wondrous landscape includes cows and birds that gaze lovingly upon Krishna's antics but it never includes those beasts that might look upon Krishna as dinner. Descriptions of Krishna's Braj portrayed an idyllic realm of blooming trees and gentle fauna, and the mahitmya (eulogistic or lauding) literature pointed to that golden age when, according to Vaisnava tradition, five thousand years ago, Krishna and Balarama played in these very forests (Entwistle 1987: 301). To illustrate the point of this discrepancy, in local and pan-Indian tradition, fiendish yaksas (or the feminine yaksinis, as well) populate forests, and travelers and particularly woodsmen must beware of confronting or antagonizing these testy sprites-who embody notions of wilderness and chaos (Falk: 13-14). However, the pastoral literature of Krishna devotion lauds these lush and verdant groves of</page><page sequence="11">Sanford: Yaksas on the Margins of Contemporary Practice 99 friendly tree as befitting Krishna's love-play with the cowherding girls of Braj (Vaudeville 1976: 211). The Braj pastoral ethic further glorified the simplicity of rural life in comparison to the evils of city life. Krishna was born to royal status in urban Mathura, but devotees note his choice of the rural pleasures of Braj over the prestige and material wealth to which his birth entitles him. For example, devotees praise Krishna's love of his simple wooden flute and his forest garland when, by rights, he could be adorned with gold and silver. Further, and significantly, Krishna's rakish and mischievous qualities are favorably compared with the more staid and regal virtues of the king Rama, a previous descent of Lord Visnu. Rama is known for his righteous rule and honorable qualities, which, for devotees, pale in comparison to Krishna's fulfillment of the young cowherding girls' (gopis) desires and his pranks that endeared him to the residents of Braj. This idealized pastoral theology was primarily developed by urban Brahmins from Gujarat and Bengal, respectively, leaders or representatives of the Vallabh Sampradaya and Gaudiya Vaisnavism. Although these theologians articulated a pastoral sensibility, most emerged from urban, town, and pilgrimage centers and displayed an urban cultivation that gained them support from wealthy patrons. Leaders of the Vallabh Sampradaya were, by heritage, South Indian Brahmins and received the requisite Brahmanical training in Varanasi and, later, Gujarat. Vitthalnath, Vallabh's son, in particular, established strong ties with the wealthy mer- chant classes of Gujarat, and subsequently, Vallabh Sampradaya leader- ship and patronage are primarily located in towns and pilgrimage centers mostly in Gujarat and Rajasthan. The leaders of Gaudiya Vaisnavism were chiefly Bengali scholars of Brahmin birth and education. These leaders were located in well-known centers of learning such as Navadvip and Puri, a major pilgrimage center in Orissa. Almost uniformly, the leaders of both the Vallabh Sampradaya and Gaujdiya Vaisnavism were shaped by experiences in urban areas and major centers of learning, and their urbane sophistication was reflected in their theologies. This idealized view of nature and society was promoted by elite Brahmins who could afford to disdain money, social status, and prestige, and their idioms of devotion and practice soon became the norm in Braj. These devotees literally applied a mythological mapping of Braj and Krishna's activities to a physical landscape, for example, identifying geographical sites as the location of events narrated in texts such as the Bhigavata Purdana. Some of these sites and shrines were already sites of local piety but were re-identified according to idioms of Krishna devotion. Although this process encountered resistance-and practices and stories about many sites suggest a process of continued contestation-the newcomers had</page><page sequence="12">100 Journal of the American Academy of Religion the power of a sophisticated theological discourse as well as patronage networks on their side. They negotiated control of numerous local shrines, most notably that of Srinathji, a manifestation of Krishna, and their pastoral theology became the dominant discourse in Braj. This leadership soon controlled the patronage networks as well as the ritual practice (Sanford 2003). The social location of the pastoral ideology is important in determining how the pastoral became dominant and in a position to marginalize local concerns. These urban Brahmins had access to patronage networks both from other urban Vaisnavas as well as from the Mughal court. For example, the Mughal administration frequently granted funds for the maintenance of Braj temples, although their ties were of a financial-political and an administrative nature rather than devotional or protective. For example, in 1593 the Emperor Akbar issued an order (farman) awarding to Vitthalnath the village of Jatipura-and its revenues-where Srinathji was housed (Jindel 1976: 20-21). It is important to note that the groups that privileged the pastoral disdain of money, power, and prestige pos- sessed these attributes and could articulate a devotional discourse that ostensibly renounced these qualities although still retaining them. The sixteenth-century pastoralization of Braj created a new dynamic between Vaisnavism and local traditions. It is important to understand how the pastoral construct of Braj operated (and operates) because this theme has political as well as theological and devotional repercussions. The pastoral became the frame of reference or the idiom through which conflicts were negotiated, and the pastoral became a means for determining inclusion into developing hierarchies. Where does this leave the local ndga and yaksa cults of Braj? Outside the system. These older traditions which emphasize practical humans concerns such as fertility and disease do not fit into the pastoral depictions of Braj. So, if the pastoral is the hegemonic discourse for Braj, niigas, and yaksas, by default, appear on the margins. The cultural flows in sixteenth-century Braj exhibit a system of mutual influences. For example, local Braj practices contributed to devel- opments in Caitanya and Vallabha's thought as well as the other way around. The dialectical cultural flows that characterized the changes in sixteenth-century Braj have been identified by such terms as elite/folk, Sanskrit/vernacular, but I agree with Alan Entwistle who observed that "pastoralization more adequately describes the dialectic between elite and folk cultures than Sanskritization or Brahmanization," and this raises questions about the relationship of Krishna to Balarama, as a na-ga figure, and to yaksas (Entwistle 1987: 88). Charlotte Vaudeville has eloquently argued that Braj devotion rests lightly upon niiga and yaksa traditions in</page><page sequence="13">Sanford: Yaksas on the Margins of Contemporary Practice 101 Braj, and the dialectical flows between these local and "systematizing" forces, as Vaudeville puts it, continue into the present (1991: 105-126; Sanford 2001). The pastoral construct is the idiom for this "systematizing" force and sets up a dynamic that places Krishna at the center with other deities, including Balarama, at varying distances from the center. Because Balarama has been integrated into the Vaisnava system, he stands both inside and outside of pastoral Braj. Although this pastoralization process radically transformed Braj devotion, Balarama retains many of his pre-Vaisnava associations. Although Krishna largely reflects the concerns of an urban elite, for example, the Bengali and south Indian presence in sixteenth-century Braj, Balarama maintains his archaic naga connections and reflects the concerns of a rural and agrarian populace. Balarama's habits such as drinking and wrestling render him the embodiment of power, sexuality, and aggression. For example, when the intoxicated Balarama demanded respect and obeisance from the Yamuna River, a goddess in her own right, he rent the earth with his plow and changed her course forever-an act that appears antithetical to the idealized pastoral representations of Braj. Balarama retains an ambivalent role within Vaisnavism. At once he is portrayed in pastoral representations of Braj as a cowherd youth along with Krishna and is an integral part of the pastoral ethos. Yet he also appears as the embodiment of aggression and intoxication. Devotees of Balarama in the Braj town of Baldeo (approximately eighteen kilometers from Mathura), the center of Balarama pilgrimage, attribute these quali- ties to his protective capacities-after all, he is Krishna's elder brother- and understand Balarama to be the upholder of propriety (maryddd). These qualities, however, alienate Balarama from idealized portrayals of Braj and determine both his elevation and subordination within Vaisnavism. As stated above, yaksas share many of the protective capacities and attributes of the nagas but bear a markedly different relationship to Vaisnavism. Let us now turn to contemporary yaksa worship to see how this might alter our perspectives on Braj traditions. CONTEMPORARY YAKSA PRACTICE7 Although devotees might focus on Krishna for emotional succor, they visit yaksa shrines and festivals to address a range of practical concerns. Contemporary yaksa practice in Braj focuses on mundane matters such 7 The material regarding yaksa practice in Mahaban appears in my article "Negotiating for Grindthji, Dajiji and Jakhaiyd: Narrative as Arbiter of Contested Sites in Braj." (2003).</page><page sequence="14">102 Journal of the American Academy of Religion as wealth, health, and fertility. Though yaksas are probably best known for their fondness of wealth, they have strong connections to health matters, particularly for children, in myth and practice. Further, yaksas can inflict illness as well as cure it; so devotees typically propitiate these devatds known for their pique. Like devata worship, most yak.sa worship occurs outside on a platform (cabatard) under a neem tree, and the neem tree itself is significant in terms of yak.as' connections to matters of health. The neem tree is traditionally associated with the goddess Sitala, one of seven sisters associated with disease, particularly smallpox. Sitala assumes the role of Hariti, the yak.sa Kubera's wife, as a protector against smallpox and other diseases (Coomaraswamy 62; Entwistle 1987: 296, 303). Most yaksa worship in Braj occurs under the name of Jakhaiya, a Braj corruption of yak.sa.8 I visited three villages particularly noted for yaksa worship: Mahaban, Parkham, and Jikhagaon, although yaksa worship is not limited to these villages. Although yaksa worship is particularly important in these villages, residents also worship other deities, including Krishna. Residents of Jikhagaon, a village named after the yaksa Jakhaiya, invoke Jakhaiya through mantras in rituals performed in houses for pro- tection. Residents of all three villages told me how Jakhaiya fulfills one's desires, particularly in terms of the acquisition of wealth. Devotees also ask him for children and to safeguard their existing children's well-being, notably the alleviation of psychological distress and childhood fears. Devotees and supplicants come to these villages at any time when they are in need of help, although certain days such as Vasant Pancami (the first day of the Spring Season) bring more devotees. The premier Jakhaiya event of the year is the Jakhaiya ki Jat, a festival held in Mahaban and Parkham on the four consecutive Sundays of Magh, roughly mid- January. (Jdt is the pilgrimage, or ydtra, for small or local deities.) The third Sunday is the most popular and draws the largest crowds. Children and infants are the main beneficiaries of this festival, and an infant's first head shaving (mundan) is an important ritual performed at these sites. Mundan rids the child of the last remnants of the pollution associated with birth and is one of the purificatory life-cycle rituals (samskdras) incumbent upon most Hindus. Families of the Chaturvedi (including the Chaubes from Mathura) sub-division of Brahmins in particular are known devotees of Jakhaiya and traditionally come for their children's mundan during Jakhaiya ki Jdt. The following section provides a brief overview of the yaksa tradition in Mahaban and Parkham and a detailed description of the festival as it occurs in Mahaban. 8 According to Dr. Chandrabose Rawat, a scholar of aesthetics based in Braj, the word evolved from yaksa to jakha to Jakhaiyd.</page><page sequence="15">Sanford: Yaksas on the Margins of Contemporary Practice 103 PARKHAM Parkham is a small village situated upon a lake close to the border of the state of Rajasthan. According to village residents, Thakurs, a sub-group of the governing or martial Ksatriya caste are the prominent social group of the village. Both local Thakurs and Thakurs from outside of Parkham perform their mundan ritual in Parkham and worship Jakhaiya for all their samskaras (life-cycle rituals). Devotees from Rajasthan and Seth families of the merchant class also constitute a significant proportion of devotees who worship Jakhaiya throughout the year. Parkham (derived from Pariksam) is a corruption of a word that indicates one who can protect himself from demons (rak.sas). The Indian epic Mahdbhdrata mentions Parkham as the capital of the yaksa kingdom. Residents state that Parkham's lake is the site of a famous scene from the Mahabhdrata in which the yaksa king questioned the heroic Pandava brothers about philosophical issues (MB 41). The village once had a major yaksa statue, but informants said that British authorities had removed the figure from the mound (tila) in the center of the village and taken it to the nearby Mathura Museum. This two-meter statue of the yaksa Manibhadra (dated prior to 185 B.C.E.) had been worshipped as Jakhaiya for over two thousand years (Entwistle 1991: 297). Today most yaksa practice occurs at a small platform near the lake known as yaksa-kund, or pond of yaksas. The cement (pakka) platform is enclosed in a small shrine under a neem tree, and piles of hair in the shrine attest to the site's popularity for mundan. Local informants said that the image is a yaksa-riaj, or yaksa king, a Ksatriya who is a fitting representative for the village's Thakur families. According to Parkham tradition, a Seth (merchant) pilgrim had a vision that this image was in the lake; so they retrieved and installed the image, a small, human-shaped figure. At present, this figure has a broken head that, residents stated, was because of a priest's carelessness. At the time I visited (January 1999), local craftsmen were creating a new image that would remain in a house for safe-keeping, only to be brought out for festivals. Devotees worshipped Jakhaiya twice a day and offered various food and clothing items, and residents noted that Jakhaiya enjoyed gifts of money as well. Seven Jogi Brahmin families share priestly (puijdri) duties as well as the income generated from this worship. As in Mahaban, Jakhaiya specializes in fertility, children's well-being, and the accumulation of wealth. Though Jakhaiya in Parkham can cure any disease, he is noted for curing leprosy and smallpox. Devotees also rely on Jakhaiya for assistance in court cases which, presumably, involve sums of money. The other four deities (Mahddev/Siva, Hanuman, Devi,</page><page sequence="16">104 Journal of the American Academy of Religion and Swamiji) who also surround the lake seem to share Jakhaiya's protective role regarding disease; for example, Swamiji cures skin disease, notably leprosy: supplicants put mud from near his shrine on their skin to rid themselves of the ailment. MAHABAN Mahaban has a thriving yak.sa (or Jakhaiya) tradition. This small agri- culturally based village sits on the road between Gokul and Baldeo. Its population is predominantly lower caste or Muslim-the now ruined fort on the edge of town was a Muslim stronghold in Aurangzeb's time. The village itself is best known in Vaisnava circles for being one of the twelve forests in which Krishna played. A (Sandhya) Brahmin, Ram Chaudhari, presides over Jakhaiya worship, centered on a small platform, or cabutara, under a neem tree-similar to Parkham's lay-out. This site is situated near a Hanuman temple that is visited by primarily lower caste devotees. In response to a question about the history of this site, Ram Chaudhari spoke of his ancestor's mandate to serve Jakhaiya. His role in Mahaban's Jakhaiya worship is important and interesting because it suggests a contestation of power over this tradition and thus another manner in which local traditions become Vaisnavized. Ram Chaudhari's family narrates Jakhaiya's story in the following way, stressing the fact that Jakhaiya himself asked Ram Chaudhari's forefathers to build a place for him. According to Ram Chaudhari, his forefathers had gone to Bharhut, Jakhaiya's place of origin (several hours away), to worship Jakhaiya. They were serious in their devotion and requested a longer worship ceremony (pijd), but the Bharhut priests (p'jdris) refused to perform this worship. The visitors from Mahaban were offended by this rudeness and finally prepared to return home. The visitors from Mahaban said (to Jakhaiya), "Fine, we'll return home. Destroy us if you will, but this is a great insult. We won't stay because these priests have insulted us." Jakhaiya himself remained silent during the entire time of the visit, and the devotees returned to Mahaban. When they reached Mahaban, Jakhaiyi himself came to them in a vision. He said, "You are dissatisfied. I'll come to you myself if you build me a place. Make me a place, and I will give a piece of land." Upon this request they built the (mud, or kaccd) cabitard, and Jakhaiya entered into it. Jakhaiya's power resides in the platform itself-an image (miirti) is not necessary because the platform itself holds the power and fulfills desires. To prove this point, Ram Chaudari continued with the following</page><page sequence="17">Sanford: Yaksas on the Margins of Contemporary Practice 105 story of a pilgrim from Ujjain. This man had no son and prayed for the boon of a son. When this man was seventy years old, his wife bore a son, and, to thank Jakhaiya, the pilgrim spent seventy thousand rupees to build a cement (pakkd) platform. Regarding Jakhaiya's gender, Ram Chaudari stated that he is defi- nitely male, though he knows of no wife or children of Jakhaiya. This is interesting because female devotees often offer bangles and saris to Jakhaiya, and saris and bangles would be a more appropriate gift for a female deity than a male. Although I heard no claims that Jakhaiya was female, these women's gifts suggest yet another level of ambiguity and contestation in regard to Jakhaiya devotion. MAHABAN'S FESTIVAL Jakhaiya ki Jat is the premier Jakhaiya event of the year and has existed in some form for at least over hundred years. The British Gazetteer F. Growse briefly mentions the existence of this festival in his memoirs written in 1882 (71). Children and infants are the main beneficiaries, and their mundan is an important component. When I attended the festival in 1999, Ram Chaudari sat beside the platform and presided over most of the events. (I say most, because, in essence, there were two simultaneous festivals going on.) I will go into some detail on my observation of this dual festival because their mutual presence exemplifies how a Brahmanic festival might absorb an older festival and reinterpret aspects of a local tradition into a new framework. Just in front of the platform, the barber (Nai) performed the mundan. After he shaved the baby's head, he made a red swastika on the bald scalp. The baby's hair was put into a clay ball that would later be offered to Jakhaiya. After this is done, a Muslim man with a leather water-skin bag performed a motion resembling drati (or balaiyd) with the water, then sprinkled water around the feet of the mother and child to offer protection and purity. According to local informants, this group called Sak or 'ak have had a long-standing role in this ritual; when they converted to Islam, the traditional role for this caste was retained. Nearby a group of lower caste residents (sweepers) waited, one holding a rooster. The cakula-making the four sides safe from the evil eye- relieves one from psychological distress and childhood fears, according to Ram Chaudhari and others from Mahaban. They held the rooster's legs and waved it clockwise around the head, in an action similar to drati (or balaiyd). The rooster then took on the mental disturbance, and the child was freed from this affliction. Waiting not too far away was a small pig-and here it is obvious to me that there are two festivals going on: a Brahmanic festival with no</page><page sequence="18">106 Journal of the American Academy of Religion blood, and a festival for lower caste residents with sacrifice (bali) and blood.9 According to tradition, yaksas like meat and alcohol (Coomaraswamy: 74; Entwistle 1987: 286-287). In past times sweepers sacrificed the pig and applied the blood to the children's foreheads for protection, prior to mundan. Now, in symbolic sacrifice, only the pig's ear is cut, and the blood drips down to earth. Then the pig is free for life and will not be used again (as it is symbolically dead). Residents stated that if a devotee actually demanded the full sacrifice, it could be done. The symbolic sacrifice itself is not done at the platform but must be done at least two hundred meters away. (In reality, the pig was closer than two hundred meters.) The two hundred meters is less important than the fact that it is at some remove from the Jakhaiya shrine. When local informants showed me where the sacrifice would occur, it was almost out of line of sight because of trees and buildings. Local residents stated that the presiding Brahmins would not let them conduct the sacrifice near Jakhaiya's shrine, but that it had to be at some distance. In fact, Ram Chaudhari was eager to deny this aspect of the festival. Although he was happy to speak about most aspects of the festival, he downplayed the pig's role as something "those other people did." There is an obvious tension over whose festival this really is. Ram Chaudhari's story of Jakhaiya's arrival in Mahaban gives authority over the shrine to his family. However, elements of the festival, particularly the bali, and his "presiding at a distance" made his role appear somewhat strained, if not superficial. His story and his role in the festival indicate a contested nego- tiation for rights over Jakhaiya in Mahaban, that is, continued Brahmanical attempts at control over a traditionally non-Brahmanical festival. Ram Chaudhari and his family have gained authority over much of the festival through Jakhaiya's request for a home in Mahaban and their continued control of the physical shrine. I do not know the long history of this festival, although, as already noted, it existed in some form in the late nineteenth century (Growse: 71). It could be that two distinct festivals are merging, with increasing Brahmin control. Or perhaps the arrival and installation of Jakhaiya have been an opportunity to gain access and control of a local tradition. 9 A parallel eradication of blood sacrifice resulting from Brahmin/Vaisnava sensibilities potentially existed in the Annaki.t festival. Vaudeville notes that the Visnu Purina mentions that cowherds offered blood sacrifice to this hill god, but the Bhigavata Pur.na omits any reference to a blood sacrifice (1980: 5).</page><page sequence="19">Sanford: Yaksas on the Margins of Contemporary Practice 107 CONCLUSION What can an analysis of contemporary yaksa worship tell us about broader concerns of understanding traditions as dynamic and in relation to each other? When looking at Braj, most scholars-including myself- understand the sixteenth-century pastoral Krishna tradition as central. We have acknowledged the presence of interesting and important folk and local traditions, that is, ndga and yaksa worship, but have relegated them to the margins as something tangential and inconsequential to Krishna devotion. Entwistle, Hawley, Vaudeville, and others have dis- cussed the dialectical cultural flows of sixteenth-century Braj in terms of elite and folk, and Vaudeville stated that "Hinduism ... is a religion in which the concourse between the various centers and peripheries is easier than in most" (Hawley 1991: 158). Yet, as Richard Cohen has done in his article, "Naga, Yaksini, Buddha: Local Deities and Local Buddhism," let us reverse our gaze and view the more powerful and hegemonic traditions through the lens of local structures-or the peripheries themselves. When we make them central, the landscape changes. I argue that multiple centers not only exist but also that these local traditions are essential to the establishment and maintenance of traditions such as Krishna devotion. It is then important to consider these traditions as interdependent and in terms of their dynamic relationships with each other because these rela- tionships ultimately are, in part, definitive of the traditions themselves. The local deities of Braj offer a sustaining balance to the pastoral Krishna tradition. In spite of what Vaudeville terms as the powerful "sys- tematizing" forces of Hinduism, these local traditions, at least in the case of Braj, have proven to be the enduring cultural forms, possibly because of their symbiotic relationship with what is perceived to be hegemonic. Braj nagas and yaksas protect their devotees and mediate practical concerns although Krishna functions primarily in his realm of bhdva, or the devo- tional emotion. This is not to say that Krishna has no role in curing disease or bestowing boons, and, significantly, Krishna's protective role in his multiple descents to earth are obvious. Yet in the pastoral representations that dominate Braj devotion, devotees primarily relate to Krishna in his role as a handsome and charming youth to be passionately loved. Perhaps this is possible because these other deities-the yaksas and the like-hold down the serious job of protecting Braj and their devotees, thus freeing Krishna to exist in his pastoral world. I began by suggesting that an investigation of contemporary yaksa worship might necessitate re-evaluation of Braj practice, and indeed it does. As noted above, the Vaisnava tradition has assimilated variant and divergent traditions, such as the ndga and Goddess traditions, through</page><page sequence="20">108 Journal of the American Academy of Religion the familial structure. Such a metaphor reifies the Vaisnava hierarchy of Krishna as center and naiga as peripheral. To focus on yaksa traditions, however, upsets what might appear to be a stable system because this view suggests these traditions are not so much related in a static center- periphery but rather that these different traditions are interdependent and bound to each other in more complicated ways. I suggest then viewing Braj devotion as a series of circles, each of which defines its own center and periphery. There are many circles, not just one (e.g., for a yaksa devotee, Krishna is on the margin, away from the center). Scholars and Vaiisnava Brahmins have consistently privileged the pastoral Krishna as the center of the circle, but let us re-map the landscape to reflect these multiple cir- cles. These multiple circles will more accurately represent the dialectical and mutually interdependent relationships between the different tradi- tions in Braj.
