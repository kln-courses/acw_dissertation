<plain_text><page sequence="1">CausalAsymmetries, by Daniel M. Hausman. Cambridge: Cambridge Uni- versity Press, 1998. Pp. xv + 300. H/b 37.50. One of the problems with studying causation is that there are so many differ- ent paradigms within which to do it. There are, for example, counterfactual theories, "process" theories, statistical theories, and agency theories. The dif- ferent kinds of theory often appear to have radically different conceptions not only of what causation is, but also of what sorts of philosophical questions are important and how one ought to go about answering those questions-to the</page><page sequence="2">934 Book Reviews extent that it is sometimes hard to believe that they are all talking about the same thing. Causal Asymmetries makes a unique and much needed contribution to the field by tracing out the fundamental connections between the bewildering array of theories currently on offer. Hausman develops a theory which builds on a central core of principles which most theories of causation presuppose in one form or another. The basic strategy is to start out with a primitive sym- metric relation of causal connection (CC): a and b are causally connected if and only if either a causes b, b causes a, or a and b are effects of a common cause. He adds to this relation an asymmetric relation that holds between causally connected events a and b if and only if a causes b, to yield an analysis of causation. Hausman's central concern, as the title suggests, is with the source of the asymmetry of causation. He argues against locating the source in the asym- metric relations of temporal priority, means-end, or counterfactual depen- dence, and argues that the source lies rather in what he calls the "independence condition" (I): if a causes b, or a and b are causally connected only as effects of a common cause, then b has a cause that is not causally con- nected to a. (CC) and (I), plus transitivity, entail what Hausman calls the "indepen- dence theory of causal priority" (CP): a causes b if and only if a is causally connected to b, and everything causally connected to a is causally connected to b. Two immediate prima facie problems arise for the independence theory. First, (I) seems to be a rather unsatisfyingly superficial fact on which to ground the apparently substantive and important asymmetry of causation; moreover, (I) flatly rules out the possibility that closed deterministic systems have a causal structure. And second, the equally important notion of causal connection is left as an undefined primitive, which does seem to be taking rather too much for granted if one's project is to provide an analysis of cau- sation. Hausman defends the independence theory against both objections. Against the first, he points out that most other theories of causation take (I), or something like it, for granted too; for example, (I) is closely related to the asymmetry of overdetermination, which is what Lewis grounds the asymme- try of counterfactual dependence-and hence causation-in. And he argues that it's really quite plausible to hold that closed deterministic systems do not have a causal structure. The main reason why not, he argues, is that the con- cept of causation has its roots in human beings' role as actors in the world: causal facts are useful to us because they tell us how we might intervene to control our environment. Since intervention is by definition impossible in closed deterministic systems, there is no reason to think that the concept of causation applies to them.</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews 935 The concept of an intervention is another central one for Hausman. The idea that we can "tweak" the independent causes of an event to stop it coming about not only provides the point of having a concept of causation in the first place, but also-as he argues in depth in chapter eight-provides the reason why causes explain their effects and not vice versa. Since explanation is grounded in our practical interests, the asymmetry of explanation, like the asymmetry of causation, derives from the possibility of intervening in the independent causal processes that bring events about. Of course, the notion of an intervention is closely related to agency theories of causation. Hausman argues, however, that the "abstract" notion of an inter- vention fares better than the agency theorist's notion of a human intervention by stripping it of its anthropomorphic element. He also illuminates the con- nection between abstract intervention and the notion of a "miracle" that is central to Lewis's analysis of counterfactual dependence. The second objection-the worry that one ought not to take the notion of causal connection as primitive in an analysis of causation-Hausman attempts to allay by arguing that (CC) is very nearly reducible to the "operationalizing assumption" (OA) that a and b are causally connected if and only if Pr(A) and Pr(B) are, in the background circumstances C, unconditionally probabilisti- cally dependent, that is, if and only if Pr(A&amp;B/ C) ? Pr(A/C) Pr(B/C). He goes to great lengths (in chapter twelve) to argue that (CC) is not fully reduc- ible to (OA); nonetheless, the two are almost always co-extensive. On Haus- man's view, while it's rather a shame that (CC) can't be reduced to (OA), their close connection serves to render the notion of causal connection empirically respectable, since it explains why statistical methods work as well as they do in revealing causal connections. Hausman's theory is thus anti-reductionist without making causal relations seem empirically dubious. It also-for all the talk about human interests- makes causal relations thoroughly objective, and not merely a projection by human minds onto a world that has, in itself, no real causal structure. The existence of causal connections and the asymmetry of independence are objective features of the world, but it is our role as agents that leads us to give those features such prominence in our conceptual scheme and our explana- tory practices. The anti-reductionist stance does, however, have the unfortunate conse- quence that Hausman has nothing new to say about the perennial problems of pre-emption and overdetermination which plague analyses that seek to ground causation in probabilistic or counterfactual dependence. Of course, cases of pre-emption and overdetermination are just the kinds of place where the links between causal connection, probabilistic and counterfactual depen- dence, and intervention break down; so while having a theory according to which facts about causation outrun facts about probabilistic or counterfactual dependence gets one off the hook, the victory seems rather too easy.</page><page sequence="4">936 Book Reviews On the other hand, Hausman does have interesting things to say about other perennial problems. In particular he gives a nice solution to the EPR paradox. The puzzling thing about EPR phenomena is that they yield probabilistic dependencies which, while evidently nomic, sit very uneasily with any causal interpretation: the dependence of one measurement on the other seems to bear most of the hallmarks of causal dependence, and yet it is hard to swallow the conclusion that it really is causal. Hausman argues that it is not genuine causal dependence because the independence requirement is not met: the measure- ments do not have independent causes and thus cannot be seen either as cause and effect or as joint effects of a common cause. The right moral to draw, he claims, is that there is a species of nomological connection-"mutual depen- dence"-which, since it is symmetrical, is not causal. This solution is not, of course, available to anyone who thinks that causal connection reduces to probabilistic or counterfactual dependence; nonetheless, it is an intuitively plausible solution. Hausman mostly assumes determinism apart from the explicit discussion in chapter nine of probabilistic causation. There, he argues that "indetermin- istic causation" doesn't really exist: in indeterministic situations, there is deterministic causation of probabilities of events rather than indeterministic causation of events themselves. However, indeterministic causation deserves rather more attention than Hausman gives it. For example, there is a well doc- umented tension between indeterminism and the transitivity of causation which Hausman does not explore (claiming that worries about whether alleged chance lowering causes are really causes really belong under the heading of the pragmatics of explanation rather than the metaphysics of cau- sation). Hausman's theory of causation, however, presupposes transitivity; and while that assumption might be thought not to require much justification in a deterministic setting, he could have done more to motivate it in an inde- terministic setting. The other problem with Hausman's treatment of indeterministic causation is that his theory fits uneasily with one of his own criteria for evaluating theories of causation, namely intuitive fit. If indeterminism is reasonably widespread, then his theory of indeterministic causation renders many of our intuitive causal judgements false, since we ordinarily take effects to be events rather than probabilities of events. Moreover, the conception of chances as spatio-temporally located tropes which his view requires sits uneasily with his broadly Humean sympathies, since he is saddled not just with irreducible causal connections but also with irreducible quantitative powers or disposi- tions. Causal Asymmetries is not a particularly easy read, though this is due to the difficulty of much of the material rather than Hausman's exposition. Indeed, he does his readers the great service of confining the difficult proofs (of which there are many) to asterisked chapters. Thus the reader who is happy to take his word for it that, say, given CC'g and NICg, itgs is entailed by DI'g and PI'g</page><page sequence="5">Book Reviews 937 (Theorem 12.7, if you really want to know) can just skip those chapters with- out great loss. (Beware, though: some of the material in asterisked chapters is interesting and not especially technical; for example there is a discussion of type-level theories of causation in chapter 5* that is well worth reading.) While the scope of the book is wide, it is thus certainly not to be regarded as a "primer" on causation. But the reader who is familiar with any particular approach to analysing causation is bound to find something challenging and interesting in it: the book has something interesting to say to pretty much any- one working in the field. And the reader who is interested in finding out what on earth the various different approaches to causation might have in common should find it very illuminating indeed. While Causal Asymmnetries may not spark any great inter-paradigm debates, it does at least leave one with the opti- mistic view that the different paradigms are not as incommensurable as one might otherwise have supposed.
