<plain_text><page sequence="1">PRIMITIVISM IN MISSINIPPI CREE HISTORICAL CONSCIOUSNESS ROBERT A. BRIGHTMAN University of Wisconsin-Madison The Missinippi Crees of northwestern Manitoba preserve traditions of two primitive anthropomorphic races' chronologically more ancient and culturally less complex than contemporary humans. Dunng the course of involvement in the European fur trade and more recent expenences of sedentarisation and subjection to Euro-Canadian influences, Crees have identified these bemgs with representations of earlier and indigenous conditions of their own society. Conceptions of the primitive 'races' simultaneously embody progressivist and pnmitivistic philosophical perspectives on histoncal development. Introduction. Saussure's celebrated axiom that linguistic signs are constituted by their reciprocal differences can be generalised to include the complex signs we call 'past' and' present'. Representations of the past are constructed in contrast to the contemporary social circumstances in which people understand themselves to be situated. Reciprocally, subjective experience of, and action upon, present circumstances is necessarily in- fluenced by knowledge of past structures and events which present themselves as alternatives to be transcended, perpetuated or recreated. This structural opposition of past and present characterises most strongly the conception of social change as direc- tional and exogenous. When judgement or evaluation organise historical reflection, the virtues and defects of the past are figured as so many oppositional terms to the characteristics of modem existence. In anthropological writing, the societies we characterise as 'traditional' have been represented as ahistorical from at least two distinct perspectives. On the one hand, in Levi-Strauss's (1967: 46-8) idiom, they are 'cold societies' which 'resist desperately any structural modification which would afford history a point of entry into their lives'. Reproducing themselves by means of events, traditional societies remain exempt, until the eleventh hour of the colonial encounter, from directional and irreversible structural change. On the other hand, this 'structural reproduction' is sometimes represented as characteristic of the actors' historical awareness, simultaneously an objective property of the social design and of people's knowledge of it. Consciousness of discrete events and their temporal succession is subordinated to the subjective experience of continuity and reproduction, human actions being figured as the reiteration or replication of timeless customs themselves understood as the enactments of primordial mythological templates. Unique events, the relative sequence of such events, directional social change, and the constructive effects of human activity are thus supposed, in the Man (N.S.) 25, 108-28</page><page sequence="2">ROBERT A. BRIGHTMAN 109 anthropological imagination, to be absent from the historical consciousness of tradi- tional societies. The Australian Aboriginal conception ofthe 'dreamtime' has furnished a generalised prototype for this representation of 'tribal' historical consciousness (Stan- ner 1979; Munn 1973; Eliade 1971). Diamond, for example, notes the presence in 'primitive' societies of concepts of development and chronology, but argues that they are subordinated to a historical understanding of cyclical reproduction: But history to them is the recital of sacred meanings within a cyclic as opposed to a lineal perception of time. The merely pragmatic event, uninvolved with the sacred cycle, falls outside history, because it has no importance in maintaining or revitalizing the traditional forms of society (1974: 203). The difficulty with these conceptions is not that that they are entirely misguided but that they underemphasise the complexity and contradictions of other people's indigen- ous histories. It does not need to be reiterated that 'traditional' societies undergo directional changes in structure. Indeed it is doubtful whether even the most committed structuralists or functionalists ever questioned this. Nor is it necessary to discard categorically the structuralist contention that 'traditional' societies, prior to their col- onisation or incorporation, differed qualitatively from 'modern' states in possessing structures and practices relatively resistant to exogenous influences and internal con- tradictions. It is of greater theoretical interest, however, to consider historical consciousness as a culturally and historically conditioned construct. This perspective takes historical consciousness itselfas the end or focus ofinquiry, as against employing it in combination with other data as a means to produce an 'objectively' factual historical record in the Western mode. The subject ofour enquiry includes but extends beyond the cataloguing and description of some peoples' knowledge ofpast events and their temporal ordering, and beyond the ideological or rhetorical 'uses of the past' in negotiating contemporary interests. Organising and underlying such historical knowledge in 'traditional' societies are philosophies of history that explain or comment upon past events and their interrelations and temporal orderings. Rather than evincing consistency, these meta- historical orders include and juxtapose contradictory perspectives on the past, representing, for example, humans as both the active subjects and passive objects of history, event sequences as both irreversible and reversible, the present as both a reproduction and a transformation of the past, and the course of history itself as both progressive and degenerative. These sometimes antinomian interpretations of the past and its determinations cannot exclusively be attributed to the contrary ideological orientations of differentially privileged or otherwise contending social divisions within a population. They rather appear concurrently within the historical consciousness of single individuals. History is unquestionably relative to the social situation of the historian, but this formula oversimplifies the unstable and chaotic character of historical consciousness among different varieties of social design. In this article I shall show how contemporary Missinippi Crees of northwestern Manitoba, in their narratives and statements about two 'races' of anthropomorphic beings, construct and perpetuate evaluative orientations towards the past in relation to modernity. Through an examination of these narratives and statements, I shall discuss the co-occurrence of progressivist and primitivist movements in Cree historical thought, situating this thought within the context of historical experiences with Euro-Canadians, and characterise Cree conceptions of 'primitive' or 'natural' social conditions. While almost certainly of pre-Columbian provenance, Cree images of</page><page sequence="3">110 ROBERT A. BRIGHTMAN anthropomorphic beings constitute a changing discourse-and a changing interpreta- tion ofdiscourse on the primitive and the civilised, the ancient and the contemporary. In the course of the contact experience, they have acquired new symbolic reference to imagined representations of earlier stages of Cree culture. Primitivism Traditional societies, the 'primitive' objects of anthropology, have their own repre- sentations of the primitive and of the trajectory of social development from the past into the present. Representations of more 'natural' conditions of social life are pres- upposed in all mythologies that address the introduction of cultural practices (Levi-Strauss 1969); such mythologies call for interpretation in terms of the tacit or explicit historical theories they contain. One such historical theory, that ofpprimitivism, has been addressed with great erudition, in the context ofWestern intellectual traditions, by Lovejoy and Boas (1935). Primitivism as a philosophical position identifies the most excellent conditions of human existence with the initial or the 'natural'. Chronological primitivism temporally situates this superior condition of civil society at the beginning of history, equating the 'natural' with what is chronologically early or anterior. As such, chronological primitivism is a statement about the temporal distribution of excellence in human or cosmological history. Cultural primitivism, although often combined with chronological primitivism, makes no reference to temporality but identifies simpler and less complex social designs with the 'natural', characteristically finding its models in contemporary 'savages' who become, in turn, the instruments of critiques of civilisation. Lovejoy and Boas distinguish between 'hard' and 'soft' varieties ofpprimitivism, the former representing the 'natural' condition as one of a spartan rigour congenial to health and virtue, and the latter figuring it less ascetically as one of sensuous indolence and leisure (Lovejoy &amp; Boas 1935: 1-11). As Lovejoy and Boas emphasise (1935: 12), 'nature' is among the more equivocal words in the English lexicon, having disparate and sometimes antithetical meanings. Implicated in European primitivism are at least nine senses of the 'natural'. Of these, two are of particular relevance to the characterisation of primitivism as an aspect of Cree historical thought: The 'natural' state of any being as its congenital or onginal condition; hence in the case of mankind, or of a given people, its pnmeval state, in contrast with subsequent historical alterations or accretions. 'Nature' as that which exists apart from man and without effort or contrivance, in contrast with 'art', i.e. with all that is artificial or man-made (Lovejoy &amp; Boas 1935: 13). With reference to the history of primitivism in antiquity, Lovejoy and Boas (1935: 14) distinguish between conceptions of temporal, technological, economic, marital, dietetic, juristic and ethical 'states of nature'; the technological state of nature, for example, is that in which tools and manufactures are least developed. Frequently, although not invariably, the defining criteria of chronological and cultural primitivism intersect: what is 'natural' is what is both simplest and earliest. We are accustomed to regard conceptions both of primitivism and of the primitive as the prerogatives of leisured intellectuals ironically contemplating the iils to which civilisation and civility are heir. Among the many virtues of Lovejoy and Boas's discussion is the relativisation of these notions. It is a not improbable conjecture that the feelng that humanity was becoming over-civilhzed, that life was getting too complicated and over-refined, dates from the time when the cave-man first became</page><page sequence="4">ROBERT A. BRIGHTMAN 111 such. It can hardly be supposed-if the cave men were at all hke their descendants-that none among them discoursed with contempt upon the cowardly effeminacy of hving under shelter or upon the exasperating inconvenience of constantly returmng for food and sleep to the same place instead of being free to roam at large in the wide open spaces (1935: 7). The Missinippi Crees of northwestern Manitoba entertain conceptions of two anthro- pomorphic 'races' whose characteristics are consistent with Western conceptions of the 'primitive'. These beings represent, in other words, earlier and less complex conditions of civil society and human existence relative to 'contemporary' Cree culture. Furthermore, these images of the primitive articulate both with the historical trajectory of Indian and Euro-Canadian relationships in the boreal forest and with Cree con- sciousness of it. First, the primitive 'races' are identified with earlier conditions of Cree society prior to innovations associated with Euro-Canadian contact and thus opposed to the 'contemporary' state of Cree society. Secondly, the images of the primitive embody a metahistorical commentary on the relative merits of the past and the present, encompassing the remote mythological beginnings of the human species, the techno- logical innovations of the fur trade, and, more recently, the accelerating social changes of the mid-twentieth century. The Hairy Ancients The Crees of northwestern Manitoba are Algonquian-speaking people whose ancestors inhabited the Churchiil River drainage of the Canadian shield since at least A.D. 1200 and probably much earlier. They were involved as middlemen and fur producers in the European fur trade from the late seventeenth century, integrating big-game hunting, trapping, fishing and summer plant collecting within a seasonal round in which relative sedentism and aggregation in summer alternated with dispersal and frequent residential mobility in winter. Around 1900, multifamily hunting groups established log-cabin hamlets on flexibly delimited hunting territories utilised in successive winters, using preserved meat and purchased food to provision a relatively more sedentary design of year-round logistical movement between the hamlet and the bush. The present century has seen the introduction of Catholicism, parochial and secular modes of Canadian education, Canadian law, wage labour, mining and dam construction, transfer pay- ments, medical facilities, and the introduction following the second world war of micro-urban reservation communities in which most families resided throughout the year. Hunting, trapping and fishing continue to be integrated with other sources of income by many fanilies, and form the primary productive activities of a substantial minority residing in the smaller and more autonomous and isolated bush hamlets. While discussing the history ofthe Cree community at Pukatawagan with the former chiefJulien Bighetty in 1977, I was told that the Crees were not the earliest inhabitants ofthe Churchill River drainage but that they had displaced an earlier and autochthonous race, the kayasiainiwak ('ancient people'), also called mimiaitihisiwak ('hairy-heart beings'). The 'ancients' possessed no Euro-Canadian technology, were physically hairy, and dressed only in animal skin breechcloths; they were also cannibals who fed both upon the Indians and on their own kind. When, in time beyond memory, the Crees had entered the Churchill River country, they found the ancients in possession of it. The ancients resented the incursion of the Indians and made war upon them, but were finally exterminated or dispersed by the hero character Kayanwi (Brightman 1989: 131-3). This conception of the ancients or hairy hearts as cannibals is shared with other</page><page sequence="5">112 ROBERT A. BRIGHTMAN Algonquian groups (Ahenakew 1929: 339-43; Hallowell n.d.; Stevens 1971: 136-42; Skinner 1911: 108-12; Speck 1925: 19-20); the myths of the ancients, when examined comparatively, comprise a coherent set that recurrently exemplify the same motifs and plot details. Mr Bighetty added that there had also been kayasiainiwak long ago in the country occupied by Whites, stating that he knew this because he had seen pictures of them in his grandson's schoolbook. A child was dispatched for the book, and I was shown a conventional illustration of Neanderthal man, standing at the mouth of a cave, garbed in animal hide, gripping a club, and gazing out on a herd of mastodons. Crees described the ancients to the fur trader George Nelson at Lac la Ronge, Saskatchewan in 1823 (Brown &amp; Brightman 1988: 77-80). Nelson recorded a narrative describing the primordial conflict between the early humans and an anthropomorphic race called omemiaetehesiwak. This form was glossed by Nelson as 'hairy breasts' or alternatively as 'ancients' and is clearly cognate to modem Woods Cree mimiditihisiwak in which lel and /i/ have merged. Like the ancients recognised by contemporary Crees, the beings described to Nelson were physically hairy, intellectually deficient, and the antagonists of modem humans. Nelson's myth is anomalous in omitting the attribute of anthropophagy, but otherwise consistent with other versions. Although they relinquished the boreal forest to the ancestors of the Crees, the ancients remained and remain a strong presence in the contemporary world. As in Nelson's time, Crees today describe the appearance of the ancients in the kosapahcikan or shaking lodge, whence their voices are heard demanding sacrifices due to them because of their seniority. Furthermore, in Nelson's time at least, Crees believed there were persisting colonies ofthe ancients dwelling in other countries. Nelson's informant specifically located them in the lands associated with the White traders. Thus were the Hairy Breasts entirely extirpated, merely by their own folly and wickedness. Had they lived peaceably and allowed the indians to partake of the blessings of this world as without envy, as well themselves, and to which they had an undoubted nght, they might stlln have been in existence. However, there are still 2 nations of them, one of which is on Your lands, the others, I believe, beyond the Seas: but they are an insignificant and most despicable people. They pretend to antiquity and would fain extort respect from the modems (i.e. themselves, or the indians, pnncipally) but their very countenance, appearance, every thing about them denotes folly and seems more to demand contempt than call for respect. I saw one many years back, who was bro't by the Traders from somewheres on your lands: hls face was venerable but still there was a meanness in the whole of him that I could not account for: I respected hlm and wanted to treat hlm accordingly-this was from the stories I had heard related of them but the traders laughed at us and asked me if I was inclined to respect folly, insignificance, and nothing (Brown &amp; Bnghtman 1988: 80). One can only conjecture as to the circumstances of this misunderstanding, in which Nelson's Cree companion saw among the White traders an individual whom he identified as an ancient. Of particular interest are the questions of why the narrator experienced feelings of respect and why he interpreted the traders' attitude towards the supposed ancient as one of utter contempt, so extreme that 'the traders laughed at us', disparaging anyone who would treat the ancient with respect and consideration. The ambivalent respect that the Cree narrator felt for the ancient seems particularly hard to explain since the ancients themselves objectify a negative evaluation of the primitive within an anti-primitivistic or progressivist conception of historical devel- opment. The ancients are 'primitive' with respect to Cree society in the 1820s in both chronological and cultural terms. First, they are imagined as preceding the human race in existence, representing a chronologically earlier stage of hominid if not precisely human existence. In this respect, the hairyness of the ancients evokes associations with</page><page sequence="6">ROBERT A. BRIGHTMAN 113 animals, and animals also temporally precede the human race upon the earth. The ancients are 'primitive' also in intellect and morality. Contemporary Crees state quite unequivocally that the ancients were kakipatisiwak or 'stupid,' the word signifying either or both inferior reasoning and lack of conventional knowledge. This intellectual simplicity is dramatically exploited to humorous effect in myths, as when, for example, an ancient is persuaded to hand over its spear to the human victim it is stalking (Ahenakew 1929: 340-1; Brightman 1989: 135-6).The ancients are also represented as morally primitive, exemplifying dispositionally hostile and selfish behaviours anti- thetical to Cree ideals of social conduct. As Nelson's informant was careful to point out, the ancients initiated hostilities with the inoffensive Cree ancestors because they refused to co-exist with them. References to stealing women and to conflicts over usufiuctuary rights to beaver lodges demonstrate that memories of hostilities with Athapaskan and Eskimoan enemies are deposited in the construction of the image of the ancients. Finally, the ancients are represented as practitioners of cannibalism, the primary Algonquian symbol of exploitation, domination and evil. The name mimiaiti- hisiw or 'hairy-heart being' has metaphoric reference to this monstrousness. Crees explain that to have a hairy heart means 'that they have no goodness in them, no kindness, no human feeling'. There is here no idealisation of a vanished 'golden age' of human happiness, nor of a culturally primitive but morally, intellectually or physically superior antecedent race. The conception of primitive society objectified by the ancients is one of technological inferiority, stupidity and monstrousness. Furthermore, the conception of historical and cosmological development conimunicated in these myths is explicitly anti-primitivistic or progressivist, exemplifying what Lovejoy and Boas (1935: 3) call a theory of ascent in which the conditions least congenial to human welfare exist at the beginning, after which goodness and happiness increase. The myth of the conflict between humans and the ancients is consistent with a more general representation in Cree thought of an early period of human occupancy of the earth in which humans are the victims of monstrous animals or anthropomorphic cannibal beings. In the myth recorded by Nelson, the destruction of the ancients is accomplished through the construction of a complicated pit trap into which the monsters fall to be impaled on lances fixed in the ground. Similarly, a Plains Cree myth represents the early humans as the prey of the cimiskwanak or 'short nose beings', anthropophagous animals who are finally destroyed (and whose bodies are transformed into prey animals) through the innovation of the bow and arrow by the transformer Wisahkecahk (Ahenakew 1929: 320). An earlier stage of the world during which humans are killed and eaten by animals or monsters is replaced by a stage of human hegemony in which the monsters are destroyed or converted to resources useful to humans. In both of these examples, technology is represented as the precondition for human survival and ascendancy. In this respect, Cree historical thought parallels that of most North American Indian societies in representing early humans as vulnerable and ignorant beings inhabiting an adversarial environment. Through the volitional designs of hero characters, technology is intro- duced and the biophysical environment is transformed to render it suitable for human occupancy. If not the best of imaginable worlds, the environmental and social designs that result from these transformations are superior to initial conditions. This anthro- pocentric and optimistic conception of the trajectory of human experience in the world is qualified in only minor ways by such innovations as the advent of mortality</page><page sequence="7">114 ROBERT A. BRIGHTMAN which are not to human advantage. Even the latter is sometimes represented as a Malthusian control, lamentable but necessary. Why, then, did Nelson's informant also feel respect for the ancient he encountered among the traders? This sentiment needs to be considered in terms of the ancients' antiquity and Cree conceptions of the conditions of their own existence prior to the introduction of European trade goods. Like other Western Woods Cree, the Crees of Lac la Ronge had been trading furs for European trade goods since at least the late seventeenth century. Muskets, ice chisels, fish nets, steel knives and axes and metal traps rapidly displaced the indigenous technology. Although gains in productivity and efficiency have been exaggerated and the effectiveness of the indigenous technology excessively discredited, there is no question but that the technological innovations were retrospectively conceived as revolutionary in their consequences. Crees of this period understood themselves as dependent on the technology imported by the traders, and this understanding created in its turn an objective condition of dependency without material determination. During the 1790s, the trader David Thompson recorded the reflections of the ancestors of the contemporary Manitoba Crees on the impact of the introduced technology: 'The old Indians, when speaking of their ancestors, wonder how they could live as the Beaver was wiser, and the Bear stronger, than them and confess, that if they were deprived of the Gun, they could not live by the Bow and Arrow and must soon perish' (Thompson 1962: 113). Thompson's further observations made clear that Crees regarded trade goods as something more than instruments that increased productivity or efficiency. Crees had by this time reconstructed the immediately pre-contact ecosystem as one in which humans were threatened by the animals that were now their prey. The bear preyed directly upon Indians while the beaver, largely exempt from human predation in impenetrable lodges, threatened to inundate the terrestrial sphere by raising the water level with dams. All this changed with the introduction of steel tools: 'Every animal fell before the Indian; the Bear was no longer dreaded, and the Beaver became a desirable animal for food and clothing, and the fur a valuable article of trade' (1962: 153-4). This historical conception of the transition from the aboriginal to the fur trade period reproduces in its essentials the mythological conception of a threatened human race overcoming its predators with superior tools. The significance of the historical sequence revealed by Thompson is that it is now not indigenous technology but European technology that establishes human hegemony over the animals or monsters that endangered human beings. Once again the historical conception is progressivist rather than primitivistic, but it is White traders rather than heroic transformer beings who institute human superiority. Not, however, without qualification or ambiguity. The ancestors upon whom Thompson's informants reflected were men and women who protected and provi- sioned themselves without steel tools. And were they not, then, imaginably stronger, more resourceful and arguably superior to their descendants who enjoyed the benefits of muskets and steel traps? In Nelson's time, as in the present, the ancients were among the beings understood to be summoned into the kosapahcikan or shaking lodge. In kosapahcikan performances, the okosapahcikiw or operator enters a small cylindrical lodge within which he is concealed from the assembled audience outside. He sings to summon animals and other nonhuman animate agencies into the lodge, and the voices of the</page><page sequence="8">ROBERT A. BRIGHTMAN 115 latter are heard by the audience, conversing with one another and with the operator. According to Nelson Some of the Ancients also enter-they are called 'O-may-me-thay-dae-ace-cae-wuck', i.e. Hairy Breasts such as the Ancients are said to be. These are great boasters-they recount the exploits of their younger days, apparently with the greatest satisfaction; say, 'I used to do so and so on such occasions- 1 never shot a moose or Buffaloe, but pursued them on my feet, and ripped them open with my knife', &amp;c (Brown &amp; Bnghtman 1988: 41). It is not difficult to identify in this discourse the aging laudator temporis acti disparaging contemporary decadence and idealising the customs ofthe past. The worldly prototypes of these performances were almost certainly elderly Crees whose productive careers had encompassed both the indigenous and post-contact productive regimes and who regarded the introduced technology as increasing efficiency and productivity at the expense of expertise and physical toughness. If the ancient beings were paradoxically respected by Nelson's informant and other Crees it was because they were associated with an earlier condition of Cree society in which survival was seen as more difficult and technological means infinitely more precarious. There exists, therefore, an element of hard primitivism and even asceticism in Cree historical consciousness. Compare, for example, with the boastful discourse of the ancients, the paraphrased comments of John Bighetty, a Manitoba Cree, contrasting the pre-second world war period with contemporary conditions in the north. People worked much harder in the older days but they were much stronger and healthler. Now the people depend on store goods and food, but they used to get everything they needed from the bush. Women used to use moss instead of baby diapers from the store. The Indians used not to need doctors. They had their own doctors and got all their medicine from the bush [forest]. The women used to work harder than the men do today. Men used to go out hunting every day. Younger people today are like iskwiiwak ['women']. They don't know how to live in the bush. The older Indians didn't eat store food. Just straight meat. They could stand the cold much better. They could sleep outside in the winter without a fire and not get cold. Indians are getting too soft because of welfare. They're [provincial welfare offices] trying to help. But people are spoiled today. If the Indians had kept up the old ways with the hunting and the dreams, they'd be a hundred per cent today. These were not the remarks of a nostalgic octogenarian but of an active and brilliant middle-aged man who, his comments to the contrary, exemplified the persistence of the earlierpractices he seemingly eulogises here. Ofimmediate relevance to primitivistic ideology is the value accorded here to strength, endurance and, in certain contexts, to industry. Running through these observations is also the theme of lost autonomy which must surely have been of concern to Crees reflecting on the contrast between pre-contact and post-contact conditions. The fur trade almost immediately created a situation in which Crees became dependent upon a technology that they could not themselves produce but only acquire by exchanging furs and meat with Europeans. Since, however, the Cree demand for trade goods was inelastic and since competition kept the cost of trade goods stable (Ray 1974), this dependency was not experienced as disadvantageous as long as faunal resources were available in quantities sufficient for both trade and domestic consumption. The ability to produce furs and meat for trade was fundamental for extending the conditions of existence since Crees depended on the introduced technology for the food they consumed domestically. When, in the first quarter of the nineteenth century, the cumulative effect of overhunting resulted in the depletion of fur bearers and big game (cf. Ray 1974: 117-24), the Crees of the Churchill River drainage were reduced to a chronic reliance upon the fur trade posts for emergency</page><page sequence="9">116 ROBERT A. BRIGHTMAN provisions. For example, the District Report for Nelson House at High Rock Lake in 1825 stated that the Crees were heavily dependent upon the post for food and would perish in winter without it (Hudson's Bay Company 1825/1826). Under such conditions of scarcity and dependency, representations of earlier abundance and au- tonomy prior to fur trade involvements undoubtedly contributed to a more positive evaluation of the indigenous past and of the ancients who now personified it. Although no overtly anti-White millenarian movements have been identified among Cree populations, the trader George Nelson described in another context such an incipient doctrine among the neighbouring Saulteaux at the south end of Lake Winnipeg in 1808. The Saulteaux 'were convinced that their golden age was at the moment of returning, when their lands would once more be filled with animals of every description and they themselves enjoy all the happiness and comforts they did before the advent of the white' (Brown 1982: 56). The Cree who described his encounter with an ancient to Nelson insisted that it was the White traders who were most uncompromising in their disparagement. Aboriginally, the ancients were opposed to Crees as earlier race to later and as primitive to civilised. Following the involvement of Crees as middlemen and fur producers in the trade, the ancients acquired a new reference to the pre-contact condition of Cree society. This is the significance of the fact that the 'ancient people' are described by contemporary Rock Crees as lacking European trade goods. Within the fur trade context, the ancients became to the Crees what the Crees had become to the traders, and aboriginal society to the new Cree 'civility'. During the initial period of ex- perimentation with steel tools and commercial fur trapping, the ancients represented the traditional as against the innovative, proclaiming from the shaking lodge the effectiveness of an indigenous as against a European technology. Assuming that tech- nology was a primary criterion, although not the only one, of the contrast between primitive and civilised or 'cultured' conditions, aboriginal Cree society was primitive like that of the Hairy Hearts and opposed in this respect both to the civility of then 'contemporary' Cree society and to the 'hypercivilised' Whites who controlled and dispensed the new manufactures. From this point of view, Nelson's informant was perhaps unconsciously predisposed to interpret or reconstruct the White trader's remarks as disparaging. The Whites, in short, regarded traditional Cree technology, and the aboriginal culture more inclusively, as 'folly, insignificance, and nothing'. As a Cree explained to David Thompson in the 1790s: 'You white men always laugh and treat with contempt what we have heard and learned from our fathers. Why then should we expose ourselves to be laughed at?' (1962: 79). In the face of this disparagement, the informant's ambivalent regard can perhaps also be read as an affirmation. He perceived as 'venerable' and professed respect for a being representing a condition of his own society already beyond living memory. That the ancients were found in the countries inhabited by Whites indicates that they were paradoxically associated with the intrusive Europeans while simultaneously symbolising the pre-European phase of Cree culture. Europeans, like ancients, were physically hairy and undoubtedly perceived in numerous contexts as subhuman, boastful, arrogant and adversarial. Indeed, it may have seemed to the Crees that the ancients had taken on new forms and irrupted once again into history.</page><page sequence="10">ROBERT A. BRIGHTMAN 117 Technology and the primitive Since the introduced technology was universally regarded as superior, and since it was the White traders who produced, owned and distributed it, Crees naturally saw themselves as technologically primitive in relation to Whites. In addition, throughout the contact period, and especially following the development of missionary entrepre- neurship and residential boarding schools, Crees and other boreal Algonquians have had their culture systematically denigrated by Euro-Canadians. Not only White manu- factures but also White languages, names, religions, medicine, marriage practices, laws, music, clothing and hairstyles were represented as objectively superior to their Cree counterparts. It may be conjectured that the readily accepted superiority of the tech- nology might have legitimised White claims to other varieties of excellence in Cree historical consciousness. If such had been the case, a possible construction of the indigenous past might have been as an inferior and primitive precursor to the 'civilised' condition produced through intercourse with the White civilisers. At least partial concurrence with such hegemonic White mythology has been documented in an Australian Aboriginal society (Morphy &amp; Morphy 1984) and, in Canada, among the Crees' Chipewyan neighbours to the northwest (Sharp 1979: 42), some of whom believe that the Catholic priests introduced human language to them. 'Indigenous' Cree culture is necessarily 'primitive' in the chronological sense, but there exists today no general consensus that aspects of 'traditional' Cree culture, that is, those aspects understood to have been transmitted unchanged from the aboriginal past, are less complex than or in any way inferior to comparable White behaviours. For example, some older persons of both sexes argue cogently for the demographic and social advantages of polygyny. Remarks that I overheard or provoked combined pride in the ancestors' accomplishments with a perhaps exaggerated vision of the precariousness of subsistence. By implication, the aboriginal past is conceived as having been arduous but not as inferior to the more recent conditions of society known to have been influenced by Whites. The unequal distribution of a superior technology-the fact that Whites and not Indians possessed it-nonetheless posed moral enigmas and questions of intelligibility. Crees conceptualise cultural differences between Indians and Whites as the consequence of a natural design resulting from the intentions of spirit beings during the mythological period. The degree to which Whites were identified with their technology is exem- plified by the personification of the whole 'nationality' in a spirit who appeared in shaking lodge performances in the 1820s: An Englishman also enters into the Conjuring lodge and says to the Conjuror 'nekanes, nekanes [nikanes 'my little friend'], I am god-like too, I can turn stone into Iron and make the fire and water to obey me and do my service and do justice to me' (Brown 1977: 40). Similarly, among the Crees of Lac la Ronge in the 1820s, the spirit associated with the Sun spoke English in the kosapahcikan and was understood to possess the power of repairing broken muskets (Brown &amp; Brightman 1988: 41). Such performances, al- though acknowledging the superiority of White manufactures, also contain elements of satire: the 'spirit' of the Whites ostentatiously addresses the operator of the shaking lodge as 'my little friend' and claims presumptuously to be god-like by virtue of his technological privileges. Other traditions accounting for Whites and their technology exhibit similar compensatory themes that subordinate Whites to Crees or dissociate the cultural differences between them from a hierarchical ordering of excellence. The</page><page sequence="11">118 ROBERT A. BRIGHTMAN Western Woods Cree myth of human creation is polygenic, tracing the White, Black and Indian 'races' to different figures moulded out of clay or earth by the creator being Kicimanitow or the transformer Wisahkecahk. Variations in skin colour are explained by differential baking or the use of different coloured materials, the creator expressing dissatisfaction with the excessively light and dark colouring of the first two experiments and continuing until the aesthetically satisfying figure of the Indian is secured (Cooper 1934: 56; Brightman 1989: 122-3). Robson (1965: 53) reported in the 1740s that the Crees inland from the coast of Hudson Bay possessed a tradition that the Whites originally arose from beneath the water of the bay and that they produced trade goods using magical techniques. By the 1800s, both the arrival of the Whites and their possession of superior technology were accounted for within the context of existing cosmological assumptions. An Ojibwa- influenced Cree myth recorded in 1823 by the Cree clergymanjames Settee represented the arrival of Whites and their tools as an event predestined by the East Wind spirit, who deliberates in this passage with his brothers about the contributions each will make to conditions in the future. Wahpun [wapan 'east'] would introduce many foreign wares from abroad to support life: food, tools, and raiment. Oh! called out the Rabbit 'yes you will introduce many useful things as you mention, but you will introduce the Weedigoo who wlfl cross the Atlantic and consume human flesh'. The Indians in this country believe that Weedigoo come [from] other Country and that Wahpun brings them in this Country (Brown 1977: 46). Reference to the Atlantic rather than to Hudson Bay is possibly Settee's interpolation; in any case, a country to the east and across the water is clearly identified as the source of Whites and their technology. The 'Weedigo' or wihtikow is a cannibal monster of human origin, here interestingly detached from its usual cardinal orientation to the north and associated like the Whites with the east. The most detailed myths accounting for Whites and Cree and White cultural differences were recorded by Petitot (1886: 466-8) from Woods Cree in northern Alberta, and exhibit obvious parallels with the simnilarly engendered cargo mythologies of Oceania. Long ago, the Crees lived in the west and the Whites lived across the 'great water', presumably Hudson Bay. Learning of one another's existence through dreams, they travelled and met on the shores of the Bay. The Crees brought with them a book that the creator being Kicimanitow had long ago given to them but which they were unable to decipher. The creator had also endowed Indians with the power to hunt animals through their dreams, while the Whites had been given only the 'raison' necessary to interpret the Crees' book. Helpless except for this raison, the Whites were weak and hungry and depended upon the Crees who were well-supplied with food, clothing and valuable furs. The Crees entrusted their book to the Whites and requested them to read it and share with them its revelations; they received it respectfully and then departed over the water, while the Crees returned inland to the west. Several years later, the Crees returned to the bay, hoping to find the Whites again and to learn the meaning of the sacred book. This time they found the Whites rich in provisions, endowed with superior tools, and living in great houses, advantages derived from the creator being's written message. At this time the fur trade was introduced, the Crees exchanging animal furs for White manufactures. As a solution to the moral problem of White technological superiority, the myth proposes a cosmically engineered condition of reciprocal dependence between the 'races'. The Indians possess the revelatory document but cannot read it, while the</page><page sequence="12">ROBERT A. BRIGHTMAN 119 Whites possess a raison that gives them literacy but lack the document. The Crees additionally possess spiritual powers that permit them to exploit bush resources effec- tively, while the Whites are helpless in the bush. In the resolution, Whites acquire superior technology for which Indians must thereafter trade. The myth continues by exploring the pathetic inability of Whites to provision themselves and the questionable morality of their property concepts. When the Crees next come down to the bay to trade, they find all but one White dead from starvation. Pitying the survivor, they adopt him into the band where he proves both insatiably hungry and hopelessly incompetent as a forager. The narrator then begins an appended story that functions as a commentary on the first. A White man encounters an Indian unknown to him who is actually the creator being Kicimanitow in disguise. The Indian proposes a hunting partnership in which they will share equally; the White rejects the proposal and argues that each should provision himself The 'Indian' responds 'Cela n'est pas bon ainsi', repondit l'inconnu, 'le Bon Esprit n'a point institu&amp; 1'egoisme. II veut que tout soit commun a tous. Vivons donc et partageons en freres' (Petitot 1886: 468). The White finally agrees, after reflecting that he needs the other's skills to survive. Subsequently the White greedily consumes the liver of a crane killed by the spirit. When questioned, he denies the accusation by saying that cranes have no livers, but he is finally tricked into admitting his guilt when the spirit produces money and says that he would give it away to learn that he was not mistaken. The narrator'sjuxtaposition of what are essentially separate stories is clearly deliberate; the greed and selfishness of the White partner functions as an editorial commentary on the monopolisation of trade goods which had been intended by the creator to be shared equitably with the Crees. A second myth (Petitot 1886: 462-5) exemplifies a similar compensatory theme, identifying the Whites as transformations of an antisocial Cree murderer and his cannibalised victims. Similar conceptions are expressed today by the Crees of Manitoba. It is said that the Whites originally acquired their technology from Wisahkecahk the transformer, just as the Crees acquired theirs from him (Brightman 1989: 26). It is also said that 'Kicimanitow gave these powers [dreaming] to the Indians because they didn't have all the machines and money that the Whites had'. As in Petitot's narrative, the superior skill of the Crees in hunting and surviving in the bush becomes itself an endowment compensating for White privileges of wealth, literacy and technology. In sum, Cree traditions characteristically represent Whites as technologically advantaged but other- wise deficient, constructing a reciprocal cultural critique ofWhite culture and rejecting ideologies of White superiority. Simultaneously, the introduction of superior technol- ogy by Whites is fitted into a characteristically progressivist conception of human history. The Xenophobic Dwarves Nelson's fragmentary observations on the Hairy Hearts suggest only the most rudimen- tary primitivistic conceptions, encompassed within a more general theory of human ascent. The developmental course of history is one of emergent human ascendancy over more primitive antagonists during the mythological age, a movement reproduced in conceptions ofhuman-animal relations before and after the introduction ofEuropean technology. A more unqualifiedly primitivistic perspective is exemplified by Cree conceptions of another race of anthropomorphic beings, who are also recognised by</page><page sequence="13">120 ROBERT A. BRIGHTMAN other boreal forest and plains Algonquian groups. In 1670, the Jesuit missionary Allouez recorded the experience of some Ojibwas or Ottawas near Michilimackinac who were addressed by an unseen presence while gathering copper ore. The Indians speculated that the speakers were 'Memogouissiouis'. These are, they say, Marine People somewhat like the famous Tritons or Sirens, who always live in the water and have long hair reaching to the waist (Allouez 1899: 157). The form given by Allouez is a diminutive of Ojibwa memegwesi or memengwesi, cognate to Cree memekwesiw or mimikwisiw. Both forms are etymologically related to words for 'butterfly' (cf Desveaux 1987). These beings are defined by a configuration of physical and behavioural features that are remarkably uniform among boreal forest, great lakes, and plains Algonquians from James Bay to the west. Rock Crees say that the mimikwisiwak, or 'dwarves', possess the size and stature of a five-year-old child and are covered with hair, or possess long flowing head hair that hangs down over their bodies. They are described as lacking noses, a physical defect that Crees regard as repulsive. They inhabit subterranean dwellings within cliffs and bluffs along the shores of lakes and rivers. Dwarves are of male and female gender, produce young and dwell in colonies or extended family households. A Saulteaux, for example, dreamed of a memengwesiw household including husband and wife, children and the husband's elderly parents (Hallowell 1955: 98, cf Morriseau 1965: 25-6 on the Nipigon Ojibwa). The dwarves are capable of speaking Cree although they possess their own language, unintelligible to most human beings. They venture abroad in small canoes, possessing the ability to disappear suddenly and to paddle their canoes through the faces of cliffs or through apertures that magically appear in them. The dwarves wear animal-skin clothing but otherwise derive their manufactured goods from Cree sacrifices. They subsist primarily on fish. When, for example, the former dwelling of the dwarves in caves near Southend, Saskatchewan was investigated, fish scales and bones were found in abundance. There was no evidence of cooking fires, suggesting to the observers that the dwarves ate their fish raw. The most salient behavioural trait of the dwarves is their aversiveness to human contact and their desire to avoid observation. At Granville Lake, Manitoba, the dwarves are said to inhabit caves on the shores of Manitou Island. Children are warned to avoid the area since the dwarves don't like people bothering them: 'They want to be left alone'. Many older persons avoid the area, fearing that the dwarves will punish the invasion oftheir privacy by abducting the trespasser. When left unmolested, the dwarves cause no harm to human beings. They are the source of botanical medicines whose identity they reveal in dreams and visionary states to select individuals. Reciprocally, the dwarves are enthusiastic recipients of sacrifices of tobacco, meat and manufactured goods which are burned or left on the rocks near their dwellings. With some variation, the Rock Crees share this conception of the dwarves with other boreal forest Algonquians and with the Plains Ojibwa and Plains Cree to the south and southwest. The subterranean occupancy of high cliffs adjacent to water bodies is a general trait, except among the Plains Cree and Plains Ojibwa where the dwarves occupy sand hills; even here, the dwellings are sometimes represented as close to water (Howard 1977: 119; Ahenakew n.d.; Dusenberry 1962: 161-2). Among some Ojibwa groups but not others, the ubiquitous small canoes of the dwarves are said to be made of stone (Morriseau 1965: 26; Sieber 1950: 76); the Timagami Algonquin portray them as paddling a floating log with sticks (Speck 1915: 82). Some notion of</page><page sequence="14">ROBERT A. BRIGHTMAN 121 facial deformity appears to be general, although the attribute of hairyness is not mentioned in sources describing Plains groups. The Plains Crees and Ojibwas of Montana emphasise a special affinity between the dwarves and children; children are said to hear and converse with them and the dwarves themselves sound to adults like children playing (Dusenberry 1962: 161; Miller n.d.). Everywhere, the dwarves are associated with botanical medicines, a connexion consistent with the identification of subterranean spheres with plants and their medicinally potent roots. From the Que- bec-Ontario border to the east, the conceptions alter in certain respects (Speck 1915: 59). The size of the beings increases to that of ordinary humans and they lose their aquatic associations, becoming identified as the spirit owners of terrestrial animal species (Flannery &amp; Chambers 1985: 4-5; Henriksen 1973: 33). Attributes of deformity and reclusiveness are retained. A narrative describing a human encounter with the dwarves is distributed widely among both boreal forest and plains Algonquian groups, and exemplifies their defining attribute of furtiveness (Speck 1915: 82; Jenness 1935: 59; Cooper 1934: 27-8; Mor- riseau 1965: 26; Stevens 1971: 96-7; Ahenakewn.d.; Skinner 1916: 362). Apprehended by the Indians from whom they have been stealing fish, the dwarves flee but are momentarily overtaken or captured by their pursuers. At this point, they attempt to hide their faces, clearly ashamed to have human beings look upon them. One dwarf, who looks more nearly human than the others, is instructed to talk, or reveal himself, to the Indians. Thereafter, the dwarves complete their escape, disappearing into the cliffs. The narrative suggests that the dwarves define themselves as inferior to humans since they experience shame and embarrassment. On the other hand, the dwarves may not define themselves as ugly or deficient and are perhaps only anxious to avoid confrontations with those from whom they are physically different and from whom theirphysical appearance will evoke ridicule or disgust. Unlike the ancients, the dwarves are reclusive rather than adversarial, and as the controllers of desired medicines and extraordinary mamahtawisiwin, or 'power', they command the respect of many Crees. Like the ancients, however, they participate in a culture less complex and thus more primitive than that of the Crees, dwelling in caves, feeding on raw fish, and deriving all their manufactured goods from sacrifices left to them on the rocks. Their hairyness again evokes the world of nonhuman animals, along with the latter's noncultural or anticultural associations. My Cree host at Granville Lake regarded the dwarves with mingled caution and fascination, a potentially valuable resource towards which, however, he had serious reservations. After discussing the dwarves with me, he remarked speculatively, 'Maybe I'll go camp overnight at the high rocks on Manitou Island. Not eat for awhile. Maybe those mimikwisisak will come up in my dream. Then I'll be able to do magic'. After reflecting for a moment, he added that the dwarves resented human visitors and that he would have his boat ready in case a rapid departure became advisable. Having recognised that some uncertainty attached to the experiment, my friend then suggested that I, rather than he, should undertake the dreaming fast. He would carry me over to the high rocks in his boat and call for me after a few days. Although the enterprise was phrased humorously, my friend was not unserious as he outlined the potential benefits, arguing cogently for the advantages of participant observation in this as in other less arcane aspects of Indian society. To his disappointment, I declined, on the grounds that the dwarves, as will be shown below, are especially and particularly averse</page><page sequence="15">122 ROBERT A. BRIGHTMAN to contact with White men. The passing of the Mimikwisiw At Granville Lake, I was told the story of Michel Dumas's visit to the dwarves by his granddaughter. Michel Dumas, a renowned dreamer and medicine specialist, died in the 1920s, placing this story late in the nineteenth or early in the present century. So then, Misil, the one who was the first to reside with the dwarves. Long ago this happens when there are only a few lodges here at Granville Lake. Late autunm is coming on, and Misil paddles hIs canoe past the point of the bay [across the bay from the present vlllage]. He makes a little camp for the night on the high rocks by the point. He falls asleep quickly and sleeps very deeply. Daybreak comes but he doesn't wake up. Really, he just continues to sleep there out on the high rocks. The lake freezes over and snow covers the ground and really he continues to sleep right there. I suppose the snow begins to cover him. Then he is awakened by the dwarves who have their dwelling inside the rocks. They tell hlm to come inside and to sleep inside their dwelling. They touch the rock and are then able to go inside. Inside their dwelling, all the walls and their possessions were smooth like glass. Misil sleeps there until the spring comes. So then they say to him, 'Now you know that we are here because you have slept away the whole winter in our dwelling. Now we will tell you some of the future. Now there are only the Crees in this country. In the future, many more White men will come into the Crees' country. After they come, there will be too many people here and too much noise. The White men will make 'pollution' [codeswitch into Englhsh] here. Everything in the bush and the river will become dirty. The Indians will live here in a vlllage. Because of thls, we are leaving thls place here. We intend to dwell across the lake on Manitou Island where there won't be people staying in the future. Variants of this story are told in other Rock Cree communities. The dwarves who formerly lived near Nelson House on Three Point Lake removed to some remote site on the Bumtwood River, following the development of the town in the 1940s. Simnilarly, at Southend, Saskatchewan, the dwarves decamped from their earlier dwell- ing at the mouth of the Reindeer River, disturbed by human proximity and the noise of a dam construction project. Similar conceptions exist across the boreal forest and among Algonquian groups of the plains. Among the Plains Cree, Ahenakew (n.d.) described the dwarves as 'still hiding somewhere, hating to come out into the unfriendly atmosphere created by the new way of life'. Among Montana Cree-Ojibwa, the dwarves are seen and heard less frequently in the present (Dusenberry 1962: 161). The Sandy Lake Ojibwa say that 'Since the arrival of the White men most of the may-may-quay-say-wok have disap- peared' (Stevens 1971: 97). The Ojibwa artist Norval Morriseau writes of the Nipigon Ojibwa that Indians for centuries knew these water dwellers but had been warned that one day the White man would live among the Indians and the water beings would not show themselves any more ... The water beings lived away from the eyes of White men, for it is said that they were afraid that he might expose them to public view (1965: 25). More detailed comparative information would perhaps indicate that the dwarves are withdrawing from civilisation right across the boreal forest from British Columbia to Labrador. Like the ancients, the dwarves are identified with early stages of Cree culture and thus conceptually opposed to contemporary conditions of existence. The dwarves, however, objectify a more explicitly primitivistic critique of civilisation, an encapsu- lated commentary on the disadvantages of modernity. The hide clothing of the dwarves is the most salient example of their identification with aboriginality. This attribute is also noted by the Montana Cree-Ojibwa: 'Their dress is reminiscent of that worn by</page><page sequence="16">ROBERT A. BRIGHTMAN 123 the old time Cree Indian, for everything is tailored from hides. No White man's apparel is ever worn' (Dusenberry 1962: 161). The Plains Cree also identify the dwarves as the fabricators of artefactual flint tools and arrowheads, displacing onto them the manufactures of their ancestors (Dusenberry 1962: 161; Ahenakew n.d.; Mandelbaum 1940: 263). In this respect, the dwarves resemble the bgwajininwag or 'wild men', another class of 'little people' (Cooper 1934: 12; Coleman et al. 1962: 52; Kohl 1985:365-6; Aubin 1982) who seem to have accrued similar symbolic reference among the Great Lakes Ojibwa. Elaborating on the English translation of 'wild Indian' for the Ojibwa form, Laidlaw (1920: 108) stated that it was also used to refer to Ojibwas who continued to dwell in the bush offthe reservation. The image ofprimitive dwarves was shared by Algonquians with the Iroquoian Wyandots whose melancholy concep- tions project the earlier condition of their society into the afterlife. These Little People are represented as living precisely like the ancient Wyandots, and that it is their task, duty and pleasure to preserve in all their primeval punty the ancient laws, customs, social organ- ization, and political and religlous institutions for the use of the Wyandots after death, for this is the land to which the Wyandots go when they leave this world (Connelley 1899: 119-20) The dwarves' prophetic critique of the post-second world war north is consistent with the attitudes and orientations of many Crees. The dwarves' representation of Whites as too 'noisy' encapsulates a complex set of objections to White speech behaviours, including but not limited to the perception of unnecessary loudness (cf. Preston 1976). The dwarves object to noisy Indians as well as to Whitemen, however, retreating from sites that will become log cabin hamlets or reservation towns. It is not accidental that narratives describing the migration of the dwarves further into the bush should have been constructed and perpetuated during the post-second world war period when Crees were moving out of the bush, abandoning the smaller dispersed log cabin communities for year-round residence in the reservation towns of Pukatawagan, Southend and Nelson House. This centrifugal aggregation-an affirmation, among other things, of the values of sedentism and primary school education-brought with it enormous social costs that were readily identified by residents of Pukatawagan in the mid-1970s. Predictably, the town was thought to be too noisy, in contrast to the tranquillity of the bush. The need to align the Indian Affairs lumber houses with power lines precluded more dispersed settlement patterns and broke up the -totim or co- residential kindred groups that had been identified with individual bush hamlets. Houses were said to be too close together. Such problems as excessive drinking and violence were sometimes conceived as natural consequences of the unprecedented population density that emerged on the reservation. It was said that there were too many people living too close together and that people 'weren't used to it'. The dwarves, finally, predicted that the Whites would bring 'pollution' to the north. The meaning of pollution in this context encompasses all the physical transformations wrought in the north by an industrial technology whose scope and impact has expanded progressively since the 1940s. Northern Manitoba remains today a wilderness, but the traveller by bush plane looks down upon a landscape of forest, burn, river, lake and muskeg interrupted by towns, mines, railroad tracks, dams, roads and power lines. Crees who provision themselves by hunting, fishing and trapping continually speculate about the effects of these innovations on the animals and fish, and it is widely believed that they have had adverse effects on foraging. Concern focuses most specifically upon changes in the water levels in lakes and rivers resulting from dam and reservoir</page><page sequence="17">124 ROBERT A. BRIGHTMAN construction by hydroelectric companies. Cree suspicions that these developments could have negative consequences-and that their White architects could be hopelessly ignorant and irresponsible-were borne out by the construction of the Island Falls dam in the 1930s and by Manitoba Hydro's original proposal in the early 1970s for the flooding of South Indian and Granville Lakes (Goulet 1987). The 'pollution' to which the dwarves refer has had measurable impact on Cree foraging in affected areas; compensation for the effects of these developments on Cree livelihood will continue to pose a complex legal issue in the future. Concern about the impact of Whites on the landscape is voiced not only through the medium of the dwarves but in the remembered and reconstructed prophecies of Crees who dreamed during the 1800s of the innovations to come. One Cree man paraphrased his grandfather's recitation to him of a revelatory dream that anticipated the industrial innovations of the Whites. 'From the west I see this water. Water problems. Thls is exactly the problem we have now today. You're going to have trouble with that water. That water is not going to supply you aUl your life. There's white men over there that plugged up water. They're fooling around with that water. They're ruiining the land to the north. I look to the north, they're over there agamn. They're ahead of you. They're digging holes in the ground and they're taking money from the ground [mining] ... And then they have a snake passing-crawling through your land. Right by your reserve there. There's some kind of a snake' [railroad]. 'And to the east, same as to the west. All kinds of land that's going to be ruined. They have mines over there too. They have dams'. I guess that's what he meant about the river. They have water passages that are not made by Kicimanitow. Now it's Manitoba Hydroelectric. And he looks that way and he says,'Oh, it doesn't look too good'. Then he faces the south, he looks this way.'Oh, from the south', he says,'there's lots of White people coming. And they'll bnng a lot of things that are good. Both good and bad for the people of the north' (Brightman 1989: 178). Implicit in this discourse are reservations about the appropriateness of hydrological and other environmental transformations wrought by White men rather than by the creator being. The antipathy of the dwarves to 'pollution' seemingly embraces both practical and philosophical or moral objections. Some Crees continue to recognise diverse nonhuman animate agencies or 'spirits', but it is exclusively the dwarves who articulate an explicit critique of contemporary reservation society and the non-Indian presence in the North. Aboriginally the dwarves were an exaggerated personification of xenophobia, concerned to avoid social contact with human 'others' who might expose them to ridicule. This characteristic structurally predisposed them to serve as the vehicle of a critique ofmodernity since the aversiveness they felt towards humans matched the ambivalence Crees felt towards intrusive Whites. Simultaneously, like the ancients, the dwarves are primitive simulacra of human beings, readily identifiable with earlier stages of Cree society in contrast to present conditions transformed through and identified with the agencies of Whites. Immune from noise, crowding, dependence and conflict, the dwarves selected a traditional solution to discord that Crees reflecting on the disadvantages of modernity may occasionally wish that they too had chosen: a unilateral withdrawal into the hinterland. Reversible time and the bush The discourses of the ancients and of the dwarves communicate disparate and contra- dictory conceptions of historical development within three distinguishable scenarios, each contrasting a 'past' to a 'present'. The first of these projects a remote 'past' in which humans are the victims of the monstrous ancients. Through providential trans- formative events, humans become dominant over their former enemies, and the</page><page sequence="18">ROBERT A. BRIGHTMAN 125 'present' is the continuation of this archaicaliy established anthropocentric hegemony. The later condition is the more excellent and the developmental conception conconi- tantly progressivist. The ancients symbolise the earlier and inferior 'past'; they provide images of primitive human society, the oldest form of hominid life, and are the antagonists of the archaic humans. The writings of George Nelson and David Thom- pson from the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries point to a different scenario in which an aboriginal 'past' is opposed to a 'present' decisively influenced by the introduction of European manufactures. This opposition reproduces the theme of an endangered and then triumphant human race communicated in the first scenario and, like it, reiterates a historical conception of progress. The ancients who appeared in the shaking lodge to boast of their prowess with aboriginal technology articulate, however, a primitivistic qualification of the superiority of the present. Taken together with the myths describing the introduction of White trade goods and the duplicity of the behaviour of the traders, an antithetical representation is simultaneously suggested of an autonomous and perhaps healthier and more vigorous past. The third scenario contrasts a recent 'past' of dispersed log cabin setdements and foraging with a post- second world war 'present' ofreservation sedentism, wage labour and transferpayments, micro-urban community life, and industrial transformation of the northern landscapes. The dwarves' indictment of sedentism, towns, Whites and 'pollution' eloquently and explicitly communicates the prinmitivistic conception that the earlier and technologically simpler condition was the superior one. This indictment is the antithesis of the concurrently expressed progressivist thesis that the pre-reservation period entailed greater hardships and dangers than the present. Cree historical thought explores, at one and the same time, both the virtues and the defects of the past and the present. Since action upon the present necessarily entails conceptions and evaluations of previous states of affairs, people's conceptions of their past, as historians correctly emphasise, play an active part in shaping the trajectories of events currently under way. For example, the contemporary decision of the Mathias Colomb Band at Pukatawagan to have additional reservation land surveyed in small dispersed parcels reflects the representation, in conceptions ofthe past, ofearlier Cree settlement patterns. Individual and collective reactions to the reservation communities are decisively influenced by conceptions of what life was like in the log cabin settlements and bush camps. Reciprocally, these latter conceptions are actively although unconsciously constructed in opposition to modernity, leading to images of year-round bush life as variously more threatening and more congenial than, in all probability, it ever was. Since there are many people still alive who formerly lived most of the year in the bush hamlets and camps-and since, in any event, it is common knowledge that Crees used to live in smaller groups in the bush for most of the year-movement between otinahk 'in town' and nohcimihk 'in the bush' reproduces spatially and cyclically the contrast between the past and the present. Most trappers today reside on the reservations but make trips of varying duration into the bush during which trapping may be combined with fishing and hunting. Many persons alternate between homes on the reservation and in bush camps, often explicitly contrasting the noise, fighting, crowding and wage labour of the town with the solitude, quiet, conviviality and 'Indian time' of the bush. Movement into the bush from town, in part because of its productive dimension, represents a movement into the past, a reversible human enactment of the irreversible withdrawal of the dwarves. The bush itself is identified both with the 'past'</page><page sequence="19">126 ROBERT A. BRIGHTMAN and with those aspects of Cree culture understood to persist from the past. The bush is the site of trapping, hunting and fishing, the place where the greatest quantities and varieties of animal foods are consumed, the locus of indigenous religious practices oriented to dream spirits and animals, and a sphere where persons co-operate in small groups with close friends and relatives. Crees readily articulate conceptions of direc- tional and perhaps irreversible historical change in their own society, variously representing the process as one of adjusting to, or taking advantage of, influences, limitations and opportunities presented by the majority society. The differing tastes, aptitudes and conduct of successive generations make up the conventionally accepted index of this change. Alongside social transformation, however, the bush represents the persistence of the past within the present, a space where certain people most of the time and many people some of the time perpetuate modes of productive, social and religious life imagined as continuous with a past that existed prior to the arrival of White influences. Continued activity within the bush is therefore the practical context that both presupposes and continually recreates conceptions of a valued and distinctively Indian past. For some, trapping, hunting and commercial fishing are imagined as obsolescent and endangered activities that in one or two generations will vanish irreversibly as the land is industrially transformed and the resources disappear. As one Cree elder put it: 'The day will come when the Whiteman will not allow you to hunt. The fish and moose will one day disappear. Hunting is no place for modem people' (Bighetty &amp; Senyk 1986: 37). Other voices concurrently reflect upon the potential reversibility of the social transformations of the present century, questioning the stability of the reservation communities and the provincial and federal services that maintain them. Behind these reflections is often the deeply felt conviction that Whites and their manufactures are only transient presences in the north, perhaps in the cosmos. If the government takes back-or can no longer provide transfer payments, nursing stations, electricity, housing and jobs, people reflect that they will go back into the bush to hunt and fish, returning out ofnecessity to modes oflife identified with the past. From one perspective, the past is vanishing, while from the other it advances to encompass the present.

BRIGHTMAN Le primitivisme dans la conscience historique des Missinippi Crees Resume Les Missinippi Crees du Manitoba nord occidental preservent des traditions de deux 'races' anthropo- morphiques primitives chronologiquement plus anciennes et culturellement moins complexes que les humains contemporains. Au cours de l'engagement dans le commerce europeen de la fourrure et des experiences plus r&amp;centes de sedentarisation et de sujetion aux influences euro-canadiennes, les Crees ont identifie ces etres avec des representations des conditions passees et indigenes de leur propre societe. Des conceptions de 'races' primitives incarnent simultanement des perspectives philosophiques progressistes et primitives dans le developpement historique.</page></plain_text>
