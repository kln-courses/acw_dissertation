AUGUST 29, 1929 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY INTUITION, CONSISTENCY, AND THE EXCLUDED MIDDLE I THE existence of mathematical activity has been ever a visible sign of faith to those who believe in things unseen. Yet agree- ment upon the subject-matter of mathematics and the metaphysical locus of that subject-matter never has been complete even among the experts. That the fundamental issues involved can not be re- garded as settled is evident from the publication of two recent books.' Fraenkel's Mengenlehre in the famous "yellow series" now appears in an enlarged edition. Most of the expansion since the second edi- tion is occasioned by the contemporary controversy on the founda- tions of mathematics, a controversy in which eminent mathematicians both living and dead are represented on every front. Although Fraenkel's book is primarily a textbook, occupied with the logical foundation of the theory of classes rather than with its technical application to function theory, it merits attention from philosophers interested in testing their conclusions in none too well-known do- mains. It is a model of lucidity and impartiality in statement, and even for the initiate there is a wealth of information marshalled in an expert manner. The almost exhaustive bibliographical appendix is a valuable aid to students of the subject. The need for distinguishing symbols from the subject-matter to which they point is very pressing at a time when in logic, mathe- matics, and physics they are so often confounded. However indis- pensable symbols may be as safeguards and resting places for infer- ence, it is not themselves they symbolize. Hilbert's characterization of mathematics as a play with meaningless marks according to fixed rules can not be an adequate statement of what mathematics is. For even as pawns in a game the marks are not merely marks or physical objects, since each represents the class of all marks in some sense like it. Even on such a crude behavioristic theory of mathe- matics Hilbert's marks have a symbolic r8le. A book on mathe- matical existence is therefore an urgent need. Unfortunately, 1 The first section of this paper is a review of Mathematische Existenz, Oskar Becker. Halle a.d.S.: Max Niemeyer. 1927. Pp. viii + 369; and Bin- leitung in die Mengenlehre, Adolf Fraenkel. Dritte Auflage. Berlin: Julius Springer. 1928. Pp. 424. The last two sections are an attempt to raise and dispose of two issues suggested by them. 477</page><page sequence="2">478 JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY Becker's book is not likely to supply it; and indeed his inquiry is not directed to the subject-matter which the mathematician studies, but to the "mathematizing aetivity" of the mathematician. Becker does take his departure from the current opposition between con- sistency (Hilbert) and constructibility (Brouwer) as criteria of mathematical existence, but it is for the supposed light it sheds on human capacity that the miscellany of mathematical, historical, and psychological illustrations is exhibited. Most of the material is irrelevant, however interesting the historical studies may be in other connections. The book has six sections, of which only the last is devoted explicitly to the problem the author sets for himself; and only a part of this is analysis and statement rather than history. It is, of course, futile to quarrel with an author for what he has not done. But what shall one say to a book on music, for example, which, instead of examining the physical and social conditions that make for its production, or of elaborating its technique, or inquiring perhaps into its place in a rational life, studied some sulpposedly special musical faculty of man functioning in isolation from his physical and social milieu? Would it not be relevant to ask whether the difficulties encountered in such a study are not consequent upon a misconception of the proposed problem? Becker's approach to mathematics is just such an approach. Mathematics is concerned, according to him, not with certain invariants in the physical world, nor with the logical elaboration of their transformation, nor with a technique of measurement, but with acts of the individual conscious- ness. It is inevitable that the applicability of mathematics to nature becomes a problem, and that a god must be invoked to solve it (pp. 324 ff.); but it is a problem only on the assumed premises. It is not the allocation of mathematical structure, not the ontological status of its entities, that is Becker's theme. He asks, rather, what is the meaning of mathematics as a type of human activity, what are the "life tendencies" at the bottom of it, and what significance do the " consistency-constructibility " interpretations of mathematical ex- istence have for human destiny? Becker's answer is given in terms of the Weltanschau?ung bor- rowed from Husserl and Heidegger. An understanding of human existence is a prerequisite for an understanding of existence in gen- eral, and it is only in terms of the former that the world is intel- ligible (p. 185). (This is the analogue to the phenomenological dogma that only of what is immanent to pure consciousness can we be indubitably certain.) The issue between Brouwer and Hilbert is resolved as the issue between such an anthropomorphic postulate and a realism which declares man an insignificant creature in a uni- verse with fixed structure. The palm of victory is therefore awarded</page><page sequence="3">INTUITION AND CONSISTENCY 479 to Brouwer, although there is never an attempt to establish that postulate or to show that the alternatives in this disjunction are ex- haustive. The fundamental quality of human life is asserted to be a concern (Sorge) about its own activity and destiny. So the search for proofs of consistency is interpreted as a concern for perpetuating unchecked the deductive process, and a desire to escape inquiry into the (tragic) nature of the objects deduced. But "noesis is onto- logically prior to noema," and deduction requires that the syntheses of consciousness involved be really completable, that the intent of consciousness be fulfilled in the intuition of essence; the foundation of mathematics must lie not in the orderly process of the universe, but in the capacities of man (p. 196). Man's career is temporal, the living moment is doomed to pass away irrevocably, and it is in the certainty of his own death that the individual is alleged to grasp the essence of his own existence. There are two kinds of time. "Historical time" is real and non-measurable; in this, the life and death of the individual is a unique, non-recurrent event. "Natural time" is abstract and measurable; in this, repetition of similars is the rule. Only historical time is creative, although the creativeness of its unique moments is compensated by the fact that they must perish. Those series in mathematics which are incomplete and growing (wherein each term requires separate determination) are exemplifications of historical time, and true analogues of the des- tiny of man. Yet the task of mathematics is to "subdue" such growing sequences and exhibit their terms as recurrent instances of some law. Similarly, the individual man in his attempt to trans- cend his own unique actuality, turns to reason to predict the future and exhibit his own moment as a recurrent term in an eternal series. Mathematical existence must be understood in terms of this constant interplay of historical with natural time, an interplay which is the image of man's conquest of death through his prediction of the fu- ture. One can not help feeling that a method which defines Jonah as that which the whale swallowed, can tell us next to nothing dis- tinctive about Jonah, if the whale swallowed anything else. An in. terpretation of mathematics as the correlate of the activity of con- sciousness not unjustly raises suspicions that the vehicle of Becker's suggestive insights is a myth, and that we are given much more a pycho-analysis of the mathematician than an analysis of his subject- matter. A study of method is often a cure for unchecked fancy; therefore a statement of the principles which Becker professes may throw light, not only upon his position, but upon some of the issues in the mathematical Grundlegungstreit. The cardinal principle of Becker, as well as of his master Hus-</page><page sequence="4">480 JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY serl, is this: "Every genuine phenomenon must reveal its own es- sence to whoever apprehends it in an immediate grasp or intuition" (p. 309). Such an intuition lays hold with indubitable certainty of those entities, and only those, which are immanent to "pure con- sciousness" (a type of ideal continuity, present to all conscious be- ings, to which matters of sense are transcendent). Logic is the sci- ence of a priori forms known independently of the empirical sci- ences, but competent nevertheless to legislate and evaluate their methods. Logical principles must in the last analysis be self-evi- dently true, since the demand that all mediate knowledge receive certification can have meaning only if we are capable of recog- nizing some principles as self-evident. Every step of a mediate proof must be apodictically necessary, a necessity grasped in a primary intuition. A new "eidetic" science-a science of essence- is thus declared possible, a science which is, moreover, independent of all experimental procedure. Each essence must be known in- tuitively, independently of other essences, so that the new eidetie science is a kind of positivism transplanted from the realm of sense to that of intelligibles. Indeed, Husserl is not unwilling to call him- self a positivist, if among the indubitable simples there be included such essences as "a1 + 1 1 + a" or "a proposition is not colored." It is the heart of the doctrine, and can not be overemphasized, that only what is "this-side" of consciousness is absolutely certain, and that of empirical objects we can not have that luminous knowledge which is beyond every doubt. One is not surprised to find that em- pirical uniformities are declared by Becker to be fundamentally un- intelligible.2 II Intuition as a special intellectual capacity is a well-worn word, and in philosophic and scientific doctrines has meant many things. The array of data alleged to be intuitively known is impressive; among them have been sensations, inner states, essences, God, logical principles, the past, values, principles of mechanics, and the freedom of the will. But probably no defender of intuition in any of its forms, whether it be taken as sensory apprehension or as intellectual 2 "Wesensgesetze gelten unverbriuehlich, sie gehen den empirisehen Gesetzen 'voran,' sie sind a priori.

And indeed the doctrine of indubitably given truths, revived with such disas- trous consequences by Descartes, has been fighting a losing battle with the demands of a discursive reason for verification and ex- periment. The development of mathematics in the second half of the last century was successful in showing up as unwarranted the doctrine that a sensory, spatial intuition was necessary for the pursuit of the science as a deductive one. Carefully formulated rules of pro- cedure replaced uncontrolled intuitive methods, so that the validity of the theorems was made to depend upon conformity to those form- ulations, and not upon an appeal to a vague self-evidence. The fruit- ful character of the rigor thus introduced in well known.3 Never- theless, although sensory intuition is no longer regarded as a method of proof, there is still a striking insistence in most schools of mathematicians who have reflected upon their science, that in- tuition in some form is indispensable for its foundation. For it is recognized that however hypothetical the force of mathematical theorems may be, the connection between premise and conclusion can not be a hypothetical connection; and therefore the validation of mathematics is not complete until those principles of inference are validated. It is with this certification of the general principles of procedure that the current controversy is concerned. Now, whether mathematics is made to rest upon a pure intuition of the integers in connection with the intuition of time (Brouwer), or whether its foundation is discovered in some immediate knowl- edge of concrete marks (Hilbert), or whether with Russell and Husserl we assert "luminously self-evident" logical prinoiples; in every case an appeal to self-evidence or immediate knowledge is a begging of the question, if that self-evidence is taken as a guar- antee that the intuited data are both adequate to support the math- ematical structure and self-consistent to permit its further develop- ment. Mathematics is more than the' structure of its symbolism, for example, and if the latter is truly to symbolize, the reference and adequacy of sign to signified matter must be carefully and laboriously worked out, not taken for granted as self-evident. If we remember how sad has been the history of philosophies and sciences which have worked on the premise that self-evidence is something with which we begin, we may hesitate to endorse an attempted foundation of any discipline upon such a basis, even if 3 The complete success of the logistic movement has not yet been attained. Even if one neglects the protests of men like H6lder, Poincar6, and Hilbert that there is an irreducible alogical moment present in their science, the well- known difficulties- with the multiplicative axiom or the axiom of reducibility r.ust be a warning to the over-confident.</page><page sequence="6">482 JOURNAL OP PHILOSOPHY no alternative method presents itsellf. The price that has been usually paid for an intuitive foundation of knowledge has been the sharp separation, on the one hand of physical and mental ac- tivities which involve trial and error and demand constant veri- fication as the conditions of certainty and consistency, from the immediate grasp of first principles on the other. A philosophy which sanctions the a priori in its usual forms leaves the connection between material and formal logie unexplained, and too often makes a confusing puzzle of both the applicability and application of logic to existence. That puzzle becomes obviously absurd if the intuited data are declared to be metaphysical simples, whether atoms of sensation, atomic propositions, or simple ideas, each self- contained, each a diminutive absolute; and it is inevitable that on such views belief in a causal nexus should be nothing less than superstition. Now what is the evidence for self-evident principle? what guar- antee have we that alleged self-evidence is really sueh? There are two types of argument offered, the psychological and the logical. The psychological argument, very crudely stated, is this: With re- spect to some propositions we have a feeling of affirmation which makes belief in those propositions inevitable, and the index of our feeling may be taken as a sign that "it must be so." But, like Peter's idea of Paul, it too often turns out that the feeling is evi- dence more for the habits of the inquirer than a guide to the con- nection of ideas or things,-whether the feeling of affirmation takes the form of the inconceivability of the opposite or whether it is the apprehension of a clear idea. Since the discovery of geometries alternative to that of Euclid, for example, we can hardly claim self-evidence for our supposed sensory intuitions of spatial rela- tions; and all the Nelsons who continue those claims reveal them- selves as pathetic dictators to the tides of scientific progress. And even Husserl has introduced important corrections into his phe- nomenological analyses.4 The logical argument is very simple, but powerful: Any reason we may offer for a statement may itself be challenged, and we are thus compelled, on pain of an infinite regress, to acknowledge some general principle immediately grasped. If there is no first term in the series which constitutes our knowledge at which we can stop to say "This is so and so," then nowhere in the series is such an affirmation possible. But the force of this argument is due, partly, to a confusion between logical priority and temporal antecedence; partly, as Peirce has shown, to a misapprehension of the nature of 4 Cf. Nelson, " Bemerkungen iuber die nichteuklidisehe Geometrie, " in Abhandl. d. Fries'schen Schule, N. F. Bd. I. and N. Hartmann Metaphysilk der Erkenntnis, p. 488 ff.</page><page sequence="7">INTUITION AND CONSISTENCY 483 a continuous series; and partly, to a lack of recognition of the differ- ence between the immediate quality of our thought as an event and its relational or inferential character as knowledge. The position 6 here taken suggests the following: Action is temporally prior to thought, so that adjustments to the environment may be made without a knowledge of the principles involved. Such adjustments are tentative, subject to error, and the formulation of the principles involved is quite as experimental as the adjustments. Reason is thus a late arrival in the career of an organism, and the ac- tivity of the organism is fixed by its own habits as well as by the habits of the environing world. When those habits become for- mulated as principles, the characters of objects may be re-arranged and redefined, not in the order of our observation of them, but in terms of such principles as will permit the inclusion of some char- acters in others. Conclusions are determined by premises in ac- cordance with general habits of thought which have emerged as successful in producing reliable knowledge. The general principles of logic, considered as habits of thought, express and reflect the habits of that which is not affected by thought but which exercises compulsion upon thought. Consequently, these general rules are not something one can take on or off at will; they are not certified by intuition; they are rather the residue of a sifting process in which operation with those principles to obtain knowledge which must on occasions stand the test of action, is the only guarantee we possess of their efficacy and compatibility. It is therefore not im- possible that some of our most cherished rules may yet break down, and that the most rigorous proof yet devised may turn out to be leaky.6 If we are more certain of the laws of logic than of any other principles, it is not because they reveal themselves in an epiphany, but because all our operations upon things, all our discourse and communication, give them credence and support. "The controlling force in reasoning is not reason, but instinct and circumstance, " remarks Santayana; and it was an excellent Hegelian insight which, recognizing, the dual roles of mediacy and immediacy in knowledge, found ready-made solutions and technical expertness the end prod- ucts of long reflection, however familiarly or immediately they may present themselves. Self-evidence is a character that belongs to propositions at the end, not at the beginning of our knowledge. 5 It is evident that it is taken bodily from Peirce. 6 The history of mathematics testifies to the fact that not even the domain of the queen of the sciences is exempt from error. There is a vigorous en- dorsement of the view here taken in Bocher, "The Fundamental Conceptions and Methods of Mathematics," in the Congress of Arts and Sciences, Vol. I, p. 459. Cf. also N. Wiener, "'Is Mathematical Certainty Absolutel " this JOURNAL, Vol. XII, p. 568.</page><page sequence="8">484 JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY It may be urged that one is involved in a vicious circle in trying to validate general laws of logic, since one must already use them in that process. But all that is really at issue is whether one may use a special instance to prove a gentral argument. To think is as much a natural event as to eat, and one may do either without using consciously the general principles involved. One may ask signifi- cantly what are the conditions for valid inference, even though in raising the problem one is, it is hoped, thinking validly. It is only Scholasticus who would enter the water only after he has learned how to swim. This rejection of intuition as a certification of truth, whether of things or principles, has its moral for some of the issues at stake in a philosophy of mathematics. The desideratum in mathematics is that the process of deduction should never lead to contradiction. The classical method of demonstrating the self-consistency of any branch of the science is to show that it is as consistent as some other branch (usually atithmetic or logic), by exhibiting numbers and arithmetical relations, for example, which will satisfy the mooted axioms. But is arithmetic itself self-consistent? The answer usu- ally given has been an appeal to an intuition of integers, or to constructs from logical simples intuitively founded, or to empirical objects "satisfying" them. But, really, appeal to intuition is ques- tion-begging, whether that intuition consists in the exhibition of logical constructs or empirical objects, unless these are already veri- fied as capable of bearing the weight thrust upon them. In every case of an exhibition of entities as satisfying theorems, there is a prior question which must be settled: Do these entities have the character which we suppose them to have, are they really such that these properties may be significantly attributed to them? We may believe that no physical object is self-contradictory, either because consistency is an attribute of properties in a logical system (and therefore objects taken as brute existences are neither consistent nor self-contradictory); or because when a thoroughgoing analysis of objects is carried through, self-contradictory attributes never ap- pear in the same context. The first interpretation of our belief can be of no assistance in our present task. It is therefore not the mere exhibition, as such, which shows axioms to be consistent, but the extended operation with them in various contexts that accom- plishes this.7 Contradiction can not subsist between actions, objects, 7 In this respect no priority can be given to physical objects over ideas or logical constructs. The demand that empirical objects be the ultimate ex- hibited elements is, moreover, a program and not an accomplishment. How is one to demonstrate the consistency of the rules of the differential calculus by exhibition of empirical objects?</page><page sequence="9">INTUITION AND CONSISTENCY 485 or propositions as such; they must first be taken into a system of meanings or relations. What guarantee have we, therefore, that axioms adopted do not involve a self-contradiction? The point of this paper is that there is no absolute guarantee. If we feel more certain about some part of our knowledge than of others, it is because it has stood the test of centuries of use. The recent discoveries of "antinomies" in mathematics should make us cautious about the unrestricted appli- cation of so-called universal principles. The history of logic is witness to the development of our knowledge of logical doctrines- the logic of relations is a late growth as an explicit formulation; and the new formulation of valid leading principles, e.g., theory of types, is a slow process. Hilbert's heroic attempt to find criteria of absolute consistency, even if his program can be completed,8 has not quite the significance he seems to attribute to it, and not much is won by calling "meta- mathematical " those principles which are in dispute. One may indeed take certain elementary combinations of signs as ultimate data, but only in the sense that one takes scale readings or sense data to be ultimate discriminated elements in a science. It must not be forgotten, however, that there is a long process of inference involved in reducing a complex problem to such easily manipulable and observable items. If those inferences are taken for granted, it is only because of their efficacy in other contexts. In denying the claims of intellectual intuition to be the tribunal of truth, one is not compelled to embrace a sensationalistic empiri- cism which identifies thought with sense perception. Thought moves on a plane different from the clash of atoms or the stimi- lation of nerve, endings. But at least to one reader of the The- aetetus, if Plato 's refutation of sensationalism masquerading as knowledge is complete, his arguments are equally cogent against a positivism of essence. III Brouwer's attack upon the actual infinite, and his association of the series of integers with time, led him to deny the principle of excluded middle when applied to certain sequences of numbers. Two types of infinite sequences are recognized: (1) the so-called determinate series, e.g., the series of integers ordered according to mag,nitude, wherein the occurrence of any integer is fixed and ex- hibited by the principle of order; (2) and the, so-called growing series for which the occurrence of any integer is not exhibited by the law of the series, but reference, to some temporal, extra-serial process is involved.9 8 Cf. the remarks of Fraenkel, p. 377 ff. 9 Cf. Fraenkel, pp. 226 ff.</page><page sequence="10">486 JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY Suppose we take as the meaning of a certain property P of an integer n greater than 16 the following: satisfying the relation "2n + 1 is prime, " and ask "Are there numbers n such that n has the property P?" If we can find such a particular number n, we answer yes; if we give a proof that the possession of P for an i leads to a contradiction, we answer no; if we succeed in doing, neither, we affirm nevertheless that although at the time we can not decide between the, yes or no, these alternatives are significant and exhaustive, and that in some sense of "are," there either are or are not such numbers. Now, Brouwer believes we must recognize for this last case a third alternative, namely, that no genuine dis- junction is involved; and that the question must be left open, be- cause prior to the actual exhibition of a number having P, the class of such numbers may be the null class for which predication is non- sense. But only an examination of all the integers could decide such a question; and since an infinite series can not be' examined seriatim, the principle of excluded middle must be rejected for series where no rule is given whereby that examination could be accomplished in a finite number of steps. When mathematical ex- istence is interpreted to mean actually exhibited, or constructible from a set or exhibited elements, there is no contradiction between the two statements: "There exist numbers having P, as is shown by the particular number n" and "an integer can never have P as is shown by the nature of integers." Since, upon Brouwer's principles the denial of a universal theorem demands the existence (as inter- preted by him) of numbers satisfying the contradictory predicate, obversion is not in general possible, and the tertium non dcatutr is always valid only for finite collections. Becker transforms these difficulties with "any" and "there is," to suit his thesis already sketched. According to him, for growing sequences, the' negative judgment "There is no n having P" has no meaning, since the series of numbers which are actually examined for P, is growing in time, the growth depending upon the activity of the mathematician; of such a growing collection we can not say whether a number having P will appear in it or not. There is really a twofold problem raised by the denial of the tertium non datur: (1) The first is as to the meaning to be attrib- uted to "there is," and to negation. (2) The second is as to the alleged indetermination of a growing series. (1) It must be admitted that if the existential import of prop- ositions is so interpreted that "there is" is to mean exhibition or construction, no inference is legitimate from a universal proposi- tion not implying such existence to a proposition which does. "If x is a man, then x is mortal for every value of x," does not, on the</page><page sequence="11">INTUITION AND CONSISTENCY 487 usual interpretation of this proposition, permit the inference to the existence of some men, or even to a quantitatively determinate class of x's. Therefore, in order that a pair of affirmative and negative propositions should be contradictories, the negation of such a uni- versal must be so interpreted as not to require the existence of any men, even though the universal does imply that if any men exist every collection of them must be free from immortals. Formally, the denial of a proposition "p," is "not p" or "p is false." Con- sequently, a formulation of the principle of excluded middle which runs thus: "In an infinite series of numbers either all numbers have the property P, or there is a number in the series which is not P," is not the formulation of a complete disjunction when "there is" means given or exhibited or constructed; and a denial of this incorrect formulation of the principle is not the denial of the prin- ciple itself. On the other hand, if, for example, "there is" asserts existence in the same sense as the universal asserts the existence of its subject, the above disjunction is complete, and there is no reason to deny the tertiunm non datur. All this is well known and it is sufficient to ward off attack on the principle from this direction.10 Of course, we are seldom content with a merely formal denial of a proposition, but wish to "break into" the proposition in order to affirm something of the subject which contradicts the former affir- mation. This is possible only where the subject-matter has been previously analyzed; and the predicates are contradictory only if the subject is taken in a determinate context. To be square and to be circular are exclusive characters, although a body (triangular prism) may possess both-but not in the same connection. Conse- quently, every case of disjunction is conditional upon the context (temporal, spatial, etc.) in which the subject is found, and condi- tioned by the necessity that the, subject be such that the predicate may be significantly attributed to it. (2) On the ground that the future is incomplete and our knowl- edge of it vague, it is often asserted that logic breaks down in trying to deal with it; for a contingent subject-matter a proposition is not either true or false, since it may be undetermined in its truth value. Becker makes the more drastic claim that certain series of integers possess this same contingent character. Suppose we take the series of numbers of the form x = 2n, + 1 for increasing values of n, and define another series K such that if x is prime the number 1 is as- signed to K; if composite, the number 2. The series K then has this appearance: 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, . . . If we ask whether, after the sixteenth place, the number 1 is contained in K, Becker maintains 10 Cf. Burkamp, " Die Krisis des Satzes vom ausgesehlossenen. Dritten, " in Beitr. z. Philos. d. deutschen Idealismus. Vol. 4.</page><page sequence="12">488 JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY that we not only can not answer either "yes" or "no," buit not even "yes or no." His reason is that our knowledge of primes of this form does not extend beyond n=16, and therefore the occur- rence of 1 in K is contingent upon our determining the prime or composite character of x when n is greater than 16. K is thus a " growing" series with respect to the property of containing 1. The use to which Becker puts this observation has already been in- dicated. It must be admitted that propositions about the future are not categorically true or false. The proposition "In 1930 Hoover wiLl be the President of the United States is a proposition of this kind. But even an "incomplete whole" may be the subject of predication, on the assumption of certain permanences throughout the totality whenever completed. Therefore the proposition "In 1930 Hoover will either be President of the United States, or he will not be Pres- ident" is true; if Hoover is still alive in 1930 and if the condition of the world at that time will be such that to be President or not will still be significant. It is possible, therefore, to enumerate ex- haustive (though very general) properties about the future, if that future is not altogether independent of the character of the present, or of any particular time-a condition which indeed is the condition for intelligible discourse about it. Becker himself admits (p. 9) that even his growing series, al- though allegedly indeterminate with respect to some properties, are fully determinate with respect to others: the above series of numbers x is determinate with respect to the property "congruent 1 mod 4." It only remains to ask what is the nature of the indetermination which Becker affirms of the series K. To locate indetermination in a number series is not a happy choice, and is inevitably confusing. To impute indetermination to the future means not only (if it means that at all) that our knowl- edge is incomplete; it means also that not all the possibilities of events will be made actual, and that the realization of possibilities is con- tingent upon all sorts of things. The indetermination which may be attributed to number series can hardly have the same sense as this. If we begin a series S arbitrarily thus: 1, 5, 2, . . ., then any proposition made about the numbers not yet written down is indeterminate in some respects, though not in all; the terms of the sequence will be, at least, numerals, although we do not know in what order the individual numerals will appear. To be numerals the terms must possess certain characters independent of the order in which they appear in this particular sequence. However, in the series K, even this indetermination disappears. The occurrence of a 1 is no longer arbitrary but is completely determined by the</page><page sequence="13">BOOK REVIEWS 489 prime or composite character of x, even though the chain of deter- mination may be, altogether unobvious. The physical operation of writing down 1 or 2 is, of course, dependent on our knowledge or ignorance; it is also dependent on many other contingencies. Since the contingency due to our knowledge in this case would vanish if the theory of numbers were complete, on Becker's view, the con- tingency of a subject-matter is identical with the partial character of our knowledge. The danger is very great, therefore, that if with him we take series such as K as models of real change, the char- acteristic incompleteness of the flux of events will be overlooked, and that the contingency of nature will be regarded as a human makeshift.
