THE study of religion contributes in two different ways to the development of philosophy. One of these is by a move- ment arising within the organized faiths themselves. The faith- ful attempt to understand better the dogmas which they hold, to define them in the terms of contemporary science and thought, to explain their nature, and to defend them against the objections of unbelievers. Fides guaerit intellectum. Such a 'religious philosophy,' while it has varied in productivity, has never been entirely inactive in France since the time when Bossuet, F~nelon, and Malebranche made their eloquent translations of the prin- ciples of the Christian faith into the language of Cartesian rationalism. It produced the long-lived movement of 'Liberal Protestantism'; and after a period of comparative inaction, it has recently become remarkably productive again in the writings of MM. Blondel, Laberthonniere, Le Roy, and Bureau, an analysis of which was given in these pages not long since.2 This activity has continued through the present year, and now seems to have absorbed the discussions of pragmatism, in which philoso- phers, properly so called, are apparently not so interested as before.3 But religion also furnishes material for philosophy in another way. It is considered no longer from within, but from without; 'Translated from the French by Dr. J. H. Hollands. 2"Philosophy in France," PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW, May, i908. 3Cf.

Schinz. 373</page><page sequence="2">374 T HE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XIX. as a social phenomenon, to be studied by historical and critical methods, and indeed one of the first importance, since it is the most ancient and most general product of collective thought. It is analyzed, therefore, quite objectively, just as a system of legal institutions or of economic relations would be. In theory at least, the analyst omits entirely any estimation of the truth or moral value of the beliefs and rites which he studies. His special aim is to discover, by a study of its simplest forms, what all forms of religion have in common, and thus to find out what is specific and irreducible in those extremely complex products, our cults and theologies as they now exist. This 'philosophy of religions' has been very active in France for the last two years, and has already produced some noteworthy works, the chief characteristics of which I will attempt to indicate. A book by M. Emile Boutroux, Science et Religion dans la philosophic contemporaine, has been published in the Bibliotheque de philosophic scientifique, edited by Dr. Le Bon. Even this fact is a characteristic sympton of the times. But twenty years earlier, this title and subtitle would have seemed incompatible. To the public, and especially the scientific public, religion seemed something absolutely foreign to science. Not that there were no scientists of religious disposition at that time, for some, like Pasteur, were faithful adherents of their church. But these two orders of ideas and sentiments were regarded as being quite as independent of each other as a mathematical theory and an opinion in politics. This state of things was the result of the positivistic tendency, of theories of the unknowable, and espe- cially, perhaps, of the extreme specialization which was then general among scientists. Ernest Bersot, the keen and subtle psychologist, who was one of the most influential principals of the Ecole Normale, invented a name for this state of mind which is still celebrated. In speaking of philosophers who thus divided their intellectual life, he said that they had 'water-tight compartments' in their mind. It seems to me certain that the system of 'water-tight compart- ments' has had its day. At present scientific method claims not to be arrested by any bounds, and to apply to the criticism of the scriptures, to the origin and history of religions, and to</page><page sequence="3">No. 4.] PHILOSOPHY IN FRANCE, 1909. 375 their relations with the other social phenomena in the midst of which they appear. Religion, for its part, cannot give up the assertion of its supremacy, in the name of which it claims the right to judge all human life, and consequently science as part of that life. Accordingly, the Catholic faculties are at pains to have their own specialists, and to give their pupils a complete course of advanced instruction, without recourse to that pro- vided by the state. On several occasions prohibitions have even been issued by the Catholic authorities, forbidding young ecclesi- astics, with more or less rigor, to attend courses in the state universities. But, on the other hand, historians have at the same time been studying comparative religions and making the- ology. Two new chairs in the history of Christianity have recently been established at the Sorbonne, one for the origins and the middle ages, the other for modern times. At the Ecole des Hautes Etudes (which is, so to speak, an annex of the Sor- bonne) separate courses are being given this year on the religion of savage peoples, on primitive religions, on the religions of the peoples of Europe, of the Far East, of Assyria, of India, of Greece and of Rome, of Mexico, and of Egypt; on Judaism, Mohammedanism, Christianity (four courses), the history of dogma, the history of canon law, and the psychology of religion. I return to M. Boutroux's book, which is interesting in two connections. It has, in the first place, an interest of the historical kind, as one might expect from its author, who analyzes and compares a series of doctrines which until now had not been thus connected, but all of which are alike in the fact that they define an attitude in regard to the relations of science with religion. Here belong August Comte and his religion of humanity, Herbert Spencer and his 'reconciliation' by the theory of the Unknowable, Haeckel and his monism, and finally 'psychologism' and 'sociolo- gism,' as we may call those theories which attempt to explain religion by reducing it to the natural interplay of ideas and of sentiments, whether individual or collective. All of the members of this first group are naturalistic in tendency, and all save Spencer subordinate religion more or less completely to science. A second and contrasting group is spiritualistic. To it belong the</page><page sequence="4">376 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XIX. theories of Ritschl and of Wilhelm Herrmann, that of W. James concerning the "religious experience," and that of those critics of science who have striven to show its "bankruptcy," to reduce it to an arbitrary construction or to a mere collection of practical recipes, and thus to confine it within such bounds that it would have no power to pass judgment on religious phenomena. Here also belongs the philosophy of action or pragmatism, which tries to restore concord between reason and faith by asking mutual sacrifices of each, demanding of reason that it cease to make its knowledge an image of reality, and of faith that it cease to see in its dogmas a revelation of an order of existent objects, and reduce them to symbolic definitions of the moral attitudes which the believer ought to take. The critical point of view of M. Boutroux's work is however equally as interesting as his historical discussion. He not only sets these doctrines forth, but he also weighs them, indicates their weaknesses, and draws from them a general conclusion. The facts seem to him to show that religion and science are two in- destructible forms of thought, or, to speak more correctly, two social realities. "We have to do here not with two concepts, but with two beings, each of which, according to the Spinozistic definition of existence, tends to persevere in its being." And this claim is legitimate in both cases, for each corresponds to an aspect of things which no conceivable transformation of human thought will ever be able to eliminate. On the one side we find that systematization of phenomena from an impersonal point of view which constitutes science; a striving towards unity and even towards absolute identity, which is realized by the abolition of all differences and by the creation of an abstract, general and uniform scheme of things, from which in theory at least nothing escapes, whatever lacunae in it may as yet actually remain. Contrasted with this are the sentiment of moral personality, in so far as it is realized by an individual being, and hence gives value to his individuality, and the sentiment of social ends in so far as the family, the nation, or mankind are regarded as beings whose development is a good, and whose fate is even more important than the truth of some theorem. Science itself pre-</page><page sequence="5">No. 4.] PHILOSOPHY IN FRANCE, 1909. 377 sents these two aspects. The first is obvious in its content; but by its existence it presents itself also as a value which one endorses by an act of faith. All these beliefs concerning the meaning of human life make up the essence of religion. Religion, therefore, is still viable, but on condition that it pass through a certain ideal transformation. It must purify its dogmas, which are capable of an enlargement which would remove from them all that could be an offense to reason or to positive science. It must preserve its rites and its activities, but vivify them by a new spirit. And, most of all, it must admit universal tolerance, or, to speak more correctly, it must transform the very variety of beliefs itself into a religious ideal. Unity is the proper end of reason and science.1 The ideal of sentiment and of faith should be a diversity which has no limits. "The only way in which the finite can imitate the infinite is by diversifying itself to infinity." The religion of the future will therefore have as its chief characteristic the disappearance of that conformity which has for so long seemed to be its most essential aspiration; and by that surrender it will be reconciled with science, which will be the sole heir of that ideal of similarity and o~ovota which it alone can effectively realize. II. The book of M. Boutroux belongs to the second of the two divisions, necessarily somewhat abrupt, indicated at the begin- ning of this article; but it is obvious that in its concern to esti- mate the legitimacy of faith, to answer 'yes' or 'no' to the demands of the religiously minded, it is closely akin to the first division. For M. Boutroux, as for the apologists and their ad- versaries, the fundamental problem is to pass judgment on a debate still in suspense. It is true that he is not to be identified with either party, but he is distinguished from them especially by the strength of his thought, by his abundant knowledge of philosophy, and by his serene impartiality.2 'Compare the works in scientific philosophy, mentioned at the close of this article, which arrive at the same conclusions. 2A meeting of the Philosophical Society was devoted to a discussion of M. Boutroux's book, in which MM. Le Roy, Lachelier, Durkheim, Darlu, and Father Laberthonniere took part, before a large audience of members. M. Georges</page><page sequence="6">378 THE PHILOSOPHICAL RE VIE H-. [VOL. XIX. An entirely different spirit pervades the publications of M. Durkheim and of his school. Every judgment of value is de- liberately excluded from their study of religion, which they regard as a fact to be known, and to be explained, as social institutions are explained, by the conditions in the midst of which it has developed, and by the concatenation of its historic forms. In two articles published in the Revue philosophigue, M. Durkheim criti- cises "the classical theories of the origin of religious thought."' These theories are animism and naturism. On the animistic theory, which is best represented by Tyler and Spencer, religion is in essence the belief in spirits, souls, genii, demons, which inhabit all things, and manifest themselves by material, biological or pathological phenomena, just as our own mind shows itself by the movements and actions of our body. This belief arises, it is said, from the observation of abnormal states, and especially of the dream, which primitive man interprets as a sortie from the body of an internal substance which is its 'double' or ghost. The protagonists of naturism are Max Mfiller, Steinthal, Kuhn, Schwartz, and Michel Breal. According to them, the gods are natural phenomena or objects transfigured by language; nominac, numina. In Agni it is easy to recognize fire, in Ouranos the sky, in Zeus the lightning, in Apollo the sun. Beings thus designated become spirits analogous to those of men all the more easily because the forms of the language suggest their personification. The very form of the judgment, said Steinthal, makes its subject a personal being, anthropomorphizes it, makes the attribute a quality or a defect of this being, and the verb a designation of an act performed by it. Since nature to the primitive mind is marvelous, terrible, and beneficent all at once, the reciprocal Sorel has published a long and interesting analysis of the same work, under the title: La Religion d'aujourd'hui (Revue de metaphysique, March and May, i909). He compares it with much ingenuity with a great number of contemporary publications and articles, almost all either apologetic or anti-religious, from which he quotes abundantly. M. Georges Sorel is himself a thinker of considerable orig- inality. He was formerly a governmental engineer for bridges and roads, but he has now devoted himself to philosophy and to the Party of Social Action. He is one of the leaders of that Catholic Socialism, a singular movement, which, while it is not precisely philosophical, has some affiliations with contemporary philosophy.

These articles are drawn from a volume in preparation, Les forces 616ementaires de la pensge et de la vie religieuse.</page><page sequence="7">No. 4.] PHILOSOPHY IN FRANCE, 19o0. 379 reactions of' language and of nascent experience produce cults and mythologies, which are the most ancient form of religion. Neither of these two hypotheses is tenable, according to M. Durkheim. Animism should explain how the notion of a human soul was formed, how souls become the objects of a cultus and were transformed into gods or demons, and how the undeniable nature-cult can be derived from this. The theory does not afford an entire explanation of any of these problems. It explains the belief in the soul by the idea of a 'double,' and this idea by dreams. But even admitting that dreaming is frequent among savages, which is not certain, it is very doubtful whether this would have been enough to produce such a strange hypothesis. Why did they not adopt the very simple explanation of believing them- selves capable during sleep of seeing things at a distance? And, on the other hand, why were they not arrested by the fact that one often dreams of the past? However rudimentary a man's intelligence may be, he will hardly imagine that his 'double' has reascended the course of time. And how did it happen that the actors in these different imaginary scenes did not perceive that their 'doubles' had played irreconcilable roles in them? No objec- tivity is possible on a basis so individual as this. Even if we suppose that the idea of the soul, and that of survival after death, were thus gained, this would not be enough to found a cult. A soul at liberty might indeed be useful or troublesome, just as a domestic animal may be; but it would lack sacredness, that original and unique characteristic which is the true mark of religion. It must be added that ancestor-worship, which on this hypothesis ought to be a mark of the most primitive civilizations, is on the contrary found in a much more developed form in China, Egypt, Greece, and Rome, than among the Australian tribes, which exhibit a much less advanced stage of development. Nor is the transition from the human soul to spirits of things one without difficulties. We have assured evidence for animals and plants being enrolled among sacred objects without taking on any anthropomorphic character. When the great forces of na- ture are, deified they preserve the vestige of their animal or vege- table origin, as in the case of gods with the head of a crocodile,</page><page sequence="8">380 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XIX. of an ibis, or of a bull, instead of one of human form. Indeed, man rather thinks of himself as an animal descending from an animal, and retaining the essential nature of some species which he regards as his kindred; he did not therefore conceive that species in his own image. And to sum up, if the animistic theory were true, religion would be nothing from beginning to end save hallucination and dupery. But how, if this were the case, has it preserved such an extraordinary vitality throughout all the history of mankind? These objections cannot be raised against naturism. The wor- ship of stars and of the great cosmic forces is addressed to real objects. If this hypothesis were true, religion would be the first form of science. "The cult," said Tarde, who held this view, "was a domestication of the gods, at a period when the domesti- cation of animals was still closely related to the cult." But the great naturistic theory is open to objections of another sort. If the first reason for religion was the desire to acquire power over things, how did it come about that it was not seen almost at once that prayers and rites did not succeed in this? Failures infinitely more numerous than successes would have soon caused men to abandon these inefficacious practices. And even if man had been sufficiently irrational not to heed the lesson of experience, how would he pass from such an exploitation of natural facts to the notion of the sacred? Primitive man is not astonished by natural phenomena; he finds them all 'natural,' since he is accustomed to them from childhood. Everything in nature takes place with regularity, and that which is regular in its appearance never strikes the imagination. The respectful fear of man in the pres- ence of the infinite or of the starry heavens is a sentiment entirely modern. Among the ancients (who moreover did not believe in an infinite), the notion of nature is essentially that of an identical repetition. Eadem sunt omnia semper. Both animism and naturism, then, efface what is characteristic in the religious mind; and when they have effaced it, they strive to find an approximate equivalent in facts of the psychological or of the cosmic order. But these reconstructions are beside the mark. Neither man, taken individually, nor nature, possess in</page><page sequence="9">No. 4.] PHILOSOPHY IN FRANCE, 1909. 381 themselves that supernatural character which is the proper essence of religions. One more way is open, to look for it in the relations of men to one another and to that social organization of which they are a part. Almost at the same time with these remarkable articles there appeared in the same review two studies which were animated by the same spirit, though arriving at slightly different conclu- sions: La triple origine de l'id6e de Dieu, by M. Belot, and L'id6e de Dieu et le principe d'assimilation intellectuelle, by the author of the present article.1 The article of M. Belot is essentially a critique of ideas. It shows that there are embraced in the notion which we call God three conceptions which are radically heterogeneous, in the most precise sense of the word, and which historical accidents have led us to juxtapose illogically under a single name. The first is that of the popular God, a product of the collective imagination. It is incarnated in personal gods, such as Jehovah or Jupiter. Whatever may be the difference between these, they all have the characteristic of being proper to a nation, and the center of its social life. God is father, chief, and often creator, "the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob." The second of these conceptions is that of the intellectual God, the God "of philosophers and savants" which Pascal so justly opposed to that just described. The philosophic idea of the divine is so different from that which precedes that it is difficult to understand how it can be given the same name. The Demiurge of Plato and his Idea of the Good are a striking example of this duality. Yet in spite of this the confusion of the two ideas took place. It is especially present in Descartes and in the Cartesian theologians, in whom the real difference of the two ideas is shown only by the obscure and really insoluble question of how the metaphysical and the moral attributes may be reconciled. The third and last conception is that of the mystic God, directly perceived by the individual, and with whom one enters into relations only in the "religious 1I was acquainted with the article of M. Belot when I wrote my own, but those of M. Durkheim had not yet appeared, and he himself had not seen that of M. Belot, which was published first. This is an example of that convergence of in- terest which is not infrequently to be observed in the movement of philosophic ideas.</page><page sequence="10">382 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XIX. experience." It is evident that it has nothing in common with the Absolute of the philosophers, and the fact that it is not re- ducible to the popular idea is shown by the often disturbing difficulty which mystics have had in identifying the object of their internal revelation with the orthodox God of tradition and the Church. Under the name of God, therefore, we put together the most incompatible ideas. Habit and verbalism alone prevent our seeing this. "But since interest in the philosophy of religion is just now reviving, it seemed most of all important not to ex- plain the errors of the past, if they were errors, but to prevent their recurrence. The first duty of the philosopher is that probity because of which, even if a real obscurity remains in the chaos of things, he tries at least to know precisely what he is saying." My note on L'idge de Dieu et le principe d' assimilation intel- lectuelle is based on the same facts, but draws quite a different conclusion from them. I have tried to show that the fusion of heterogeneous elements of diverse origin, their coalescence, and then their more'and more intimate union, is a general feature of the advance of human thought, generally ignored because of that evolutionistic prejudice which always expects to find what is simple at the outset of a process, and to see the multiple issuing from it by differentiation. Now while this is perhaps true in the case of living species, precisely the reverse is true of the development of language, that of rational ideas, and that of religious beliefs.' Aside from the syncretistic confusion de- nounced by M. Belot, a great number of other convergences could be pointed out in the history of religions. Such are the assimilation of the gods of the Egyptian pantheon, whose number diminished steadily, and approached unity; the assimilation of the Greek gods, and that of the Roman; the assimilation at Rome of the cults of foreign nations; the fusion in Christianity of the oriental with the classical tradition. Is it not the problem .of the present moment how to assimilate the needs of science with those of religion? The effort of the spiritual life is directed towards the union of terms which at first were independent, and 'See as to language the book of M. Levy-Bruhl, cited later.-My course of lec- tures this year was devoted to an exposition of this polygenetic origin, and later adaptation, of the ideas of reason.</page><page sequence="11">No. 4.] PHILOSOPHY IN FRANCE, 1909. 383 their absorption into a final unity. "Whenever all things are conceived as issuing from unity, whether as in the theories of creation, or after the more subtle fashion of the evolutionists, doubtless it is the same want which is satisfied. The success of such theories has very little to do with realities of observation, for these realities are most often incompatible with the hypothesis. . . . But they are an expression of that tendency of the mind which projects symbolically into the past the inverted image of what it strives toward in the future."' The same thing is true of such old formulae as the origin of language, or the origin of religions. If you look into the past, you will find origins; but if you wish to see their unity, you must look to the future. III. The science of religions has made still other contributions to philosophy during the past year, of which that now to be men- tioned is the most original, and probably that which will be most fruitful in its results. In a second article, this time published by the Revue de m6ta- physique, and entitled Sociologie religieuse et thgorie de la con- naissance, M. Durkheim outlines a plan for reform in episte- mology, which would substitute for its dialectic and often verbal discussions the determination of positive problems, solutions of which can be reached, and replace 'philodoxy' by science, as Kant desired to do. This may be regarded as, so to speak, the philosophical manifesto of this new school, and doubtless it will mark a date in the history of logic. It is known that man's most ancient conceptions of the world are of religious origin. Now these conceptions have not merely furnished matter for reflection to the mind; they have contributed to the formation of the human mind itself, for they have had a share in the making of those fundamental ideas and principles which at present determine the form of all our knowledge- time, space, causality, substance, personality. Besides this, religion is an eminently social phenomenon, and the same thing must therefore also be true of the categories of 'Revue philosophique, I909, I, 284.</page><page sequence="12">384 THE PHILOSOPHICA L REVIEW. [VOL. XIX. the understanding and the a priori forms of knowledge. Time, for example, is not only the inner perception of the duration, or of the flow of conscious states. It is an already formed system of hours, days, weeks, months, and years, which imposes on our activity and on our thinking an impersonal setting or framework, inseparable from our civilization and the religious habits which it has acquired. Space appears in the first instance as divided and oriented on the model of the clans and families which make up the tribe. It is thus that the objective character of reason is to be explained. It belongs to social consciousness, not to indi- vidual. It is really, as men liked to call it at the beginning of the nineteenth century, impersonal Reason. In this way the old debate between empiricism and rationalism is to be settled. The fundamental claim of the aprioristic school is that knowledge is made up of two kinds of elements, irreducible to each other, or of two orders of concepts, which are distinct and superposed. It holds that every man always partakes in a reason superior to his own, by which his own thinking is sup- ported and nourished. And all this is true. On the other hand, empiricism maintains that there is no other source of knowledge save contact with realities, and that nature is the model after which our reason shapes itself. This is also true; for the prin- ciples of reason are derived from the constitution of society, and since the social kingdom is a kingdom of nature, differing from others only by its greater complexity, that which corresponds to the organization of society will correspond also to the laws of nature. But while both rationalism and empiricism can be admitted as correct in their positive conclusions, neither of them is an adequate theory of knowledge. The empiricist believed that we need only to analyze our most customary experiences in order to see how habits of mind are produced by them which finally impose themselves on all our thinking. He therefore disregarded the results of that extremely complex historical elaboration which has slowly matured the laws of our thought through a sequence of forms, the vestiges of which are sometimes scarcely visible. The rationalist believed that he could develop all primary notions</page><page sequence="13">No. 4.] PHILOSOPHY IN FRANCE, 1909. 385 from his own mind by a reflective study of his necessary judg- ments; and thus he also failed to see that these necessary judg- ments are mobile historical results, social products whose content cannot be entirely determined by reflection on individual think- ing. Sociology, however, teaches us to regard the very first principles of our thought as realities partially unknown, having an existence of their own, and essential characteristics which may not be revealed by a first observation. It therefore proposes the historical study of the formation of the human intellect, in its connection with industrial and juridical development, as a field for positive investigation, in which a verbalistic philosophy may once more become a knowledge of realities. A few days after this noteworthy programme there appeared in the same review an article by M. Hertz, which applied its sug- gested method to a point of detail, the difference between right and left, which is so firmly rooted in human thought. The origin of this difference, he argues, is not merely or even essen- tially physiological, but rather normative and religious. But the finest illustration of the method proposed by M. Durkheim is the work of M. Levy-Bruhl, Les fonctions mentates dans les societies inferieures. The fruitfulness of the positive and social point of view for the analysis of the human mind is shown there at its best, by the most precise and varied examples. The fundamental idea of the book is as follows. Making still more emphatic the celebrated criticism which M. Ribot passed forty years ago on the psychology of "white, adult, and civilized" man, M. Levy-Bruhl shows that the people of inferior civilizations not only do not judge as we do, but that they use entirely different categories, and that nothing is more inexact than that dictum of Spencer's, according to which "we must set out with the postulate that primitive ideas are natural and, under the conditions in which they occur, rational." So far is this from being the case, that primitive ideas are in many respects precisely opposed to our methods of reasoning. So, to speak more exactly, two modes of thought coexist among savage peoples; rational thinking such as our own, which however exists among them only in a rudi- mentary form, and another entirely different type of systematiza-</page><page sequence="14">386 TElE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XIX. tion, of a prelogicacl character which M. Levy-Bruhl describes by the phrase 'law of participation.' Its special characteristic is that the objects of its knowledge are neither limited nor indi- vidualized. The 'atomization' with which many contemporary philosophers reproach the human understanding is a vice un- known to the mental life of primitive man. Their ideas are in globo, affective, mystic, undefined. Things are always for them much more than they appear to be. Their sensible reality is only the sign, or, one might almost say, in the language of Jacob Boehme, the signature, of an occult being and of mystic powers- powers which may be identical in the most heterogeneous objects, and different in those which a logical mind would unite in a single class. Those objects which belong to the same mystical class, however different they may seem, are in reality the manifestations of the same essence, and they are therefore considered as identical in much the same way as we think of the symptoms of a disease, however varied they may be, as one. An example of this is the fact that the actual individual, the ancestral being which lives again in him, and the animal or vegetable species which is his totem, are regarded as only the accidents of one and the same reality which involves them all. Another example is the custom of a certain Californian tribe which once a year solemnly kills a buzzard in each of its villages, in the belief that it is always the same bird which is sacrificed, and that the birds killed in the several villages are only a single bird. Whence a second form of the law of participation, according to which the magic effects of objects belonging to the same mystical class are equivalent; and from this follow the principles, that 'like produces like,' and that 'the part is equivalent to the whole,' since it contains indivisibly the 'virtue' which is the only agent in things.-It should be added that the whole system formed by these different essences has the. social organization of the tribe as its center, and forms a sort of analogous repetition of it, which reappears in all divisions of the universe. Animals, plants, stars, colors, regions of space, dif- ferent actions all enter into the same system of relations, origin- ally modelled after that of individual men, of families and of clans, which constitutes so to speak the single theme of cosmic</page><page sequence="15">No. 4.] PHILOSOPHY IN FRANCE, 1909. 387 relations. For savage men, as the Italian proverb says, tutto ii mondo e fatto come a la nostra famiglia. Because of this, that which seems to us radically multiple, individual, and determinate, to primitive man appears, on the contrary, as single and indis- tinguishable. The tribe participates in the nature of an animal species; each of its members in turn shares in a subordinate way in that of certain other animals, of certain plants, directions, diseases, and so on. Conversely, what seems alike to us, seems different to them. In a word, their system of general notions is so different from ours that their conclusions, although they follow quite naturally from their beliefs, often seem to us pure ab- surdities. From this point of view M. LUvy-Bruhl shows in detail, and by numerous examples, how this prelogical type of mind expresses itself in languages and in systems of numeration. These two analyses are perhaps the most interesting and instructive portion of the work. He also shows that the religious ceremonies con- cerned with hunting, fishi-ge, war, birth, initiation, sickness, death, and divination are applications of the same principles, or rather, to speak more exactly, effects of the same collective ideas. There is a sort of internal logic in this prelogical stage of mind which assists us to understand and connect the strangest rites and beliefs, once we have grasped the focal state of mind which controls all this mystical psychology. We can even re- discover the still living results of this prehistoric mode of thought in a great number of our present religious beliefs; and I believe that it is only the discretion of the author which has prevented him from giving examples of this. "The logical unity of the thinking subject, which most philosophers take as given, is a desideratum, not an actual fact. Even in our present society, ideas and combinations of ideas governed by the law of participa- tion are far from having disappeared.... And if it is true that our mental processes are at the same time logical and prelogical, this throws new light upon the history of religious dogmas and of systems of philosophy." Even from this preliminary study one can see that many of the old problems are about to disappear, and that the dialectic method customary in epistemology is like</page><page sequence="16">388 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XIX. the scholastic fashion of explaining the physical world by com- binations of the hot and the cold, of the dry and the moist Thus far I have spoken only of works specifically philosophical in character. But one sees how closely they are connected with the whole movement of contemporary thought when one com- pares all the works in the sociology and history of religions which have been published during the last few months. Such a work as the Evolution des Dogmes, by M. Guignebert, is a striking evidence of this, since it is an historical study of social psychology even more than it is a history of the beliefs themselves.' The first part of the book analyzes the nature of dogma, the forms in which it becomes incarnate (canonical books and writings), and the elements which enter into its constitution (revelation, in- spiration, tradition, interpretation). The second discusses the "life of dogma," its birth, its growth, its adaptation to pre- existing religious conditions and to the social environment in which it develops, and finally its dissolution and its death. The conclusion of the work, which is strongly fortified by facts, especially by those borrowed from the history of Christianity, is that a dogma reveals itself to the historian as the laborious and constantly changing creation of a human group; that is it es- sentially a social phenomenon, formed by the anonymous and unconscious collaboration of all the aspirations, desires, and im- pressions which the men of a given time and society experience in the way of religious feeling. But these dogmas are not created in isolation from one another. They express more and more perfectly a moral and psychological reality. There is a sort of religious progress, quite analogous to scientific progress, and evidenced by this connected series of dogmas. "From the point of view of an historian independent of any church, the creed which a liberal believer, such as Auguste Sabatier or Jean Reville, constructs out of his own consciousness as a guide to his individual religious life, has its profoundest roots in the fetichism of the savage. That is to say, man has raised himself, by a contin- uous transformation of his religious feelings, from the lowest form of religion to a conception of 'pure religion,' which is, in addition, as yet the rare possession of an elect few."

The M91anges d' Histoires des Religions is by MM. Hubert and Mauss, who belong to the school of M. Durkheim, and one of its chapters discusses the notion of time from the point of view already defined. La M2thode dans 1'Histoire des Religions, by M. Geprges Foucart, and the Etudes de Mythologies et d'Histoire des Religions Antiques, by M. Toutain, discuss in an interesting way the question of method, as it affects the principles by which mythology is to be explained. The Orpheus of M. Salomon Reinach is a curious manual of popularization, intended to spread among the public, in an attractive form, the principal results of modern criticism in the historical study of religion. The eru- dition of the book is somewhat mundane, and it has been a great success for the publishers. But it has also provoked a serious discussion of principles and methods in the Bulletin de I' Union pour ia Verite. The name of M. Salomon Reinach's critic lends a special interest to this controversy. He is the Abbe Loisy, at present professor at the College of France, whom the Catholic Church recently deprived of his functions as an ecclesiastic be- cause of the unorthodox conclusions which he had reached as a result of his study of Christian origins. IV. But in spite of the rank which questions of this sort have taken in the philosophical world, one should not believe that they have checked the activity in the philosophy of the sciences which has gone on so energetically in recent years. This does not impress the public mind so strongly, because it is a sequel instead of a be- ginning, but the continuity of its labors is in its favor. Some months ago there was added to the course in the methodology of the sciences, instituted five years since at the Sorbonne, another chair in the history of the sciences in their connection with philos- ophy. Its occupant is M. Gaston Milhaud, formerly professor at the University of Montpellier, and the author of several valuable</page><page sequence="18">390 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XIX. works: La Certitude logique, Le Positivisme, Les Origines de la science Grecque, La Pensee scientifique chez les Grecs et les Mod- ernes. The variations and different aspects of the idea of evo- lution have been studied by M. Le Dantec in his La rise du transformisme (lectures delivered in the Faculty of Sciences at Paris, and now collected into a volume), and also in a series of articles in the Revue Scientifique, the most important of which, as it seems to me, is that entitled "Transformisme et stabilite, une nouvelle loi physique de la transformation des es- peces."'I This subject has been a current topic of discussion since the centenary of Lamarck, which occasioned the writing of a fine general review of his work by M. Marcel Landrieu, and its publication by the Zoological Society of France. Several articles by M. Gaston Bonnier on the same subject have appeared in the Nouvelle Revue, especially one entitled "Les Evolutions de l'Evo- lution." The Archivfiir systematische Ph'ilosophie also published in French an article by M. Henri Moreau, "Le sentiment interieur et son rOle dans la psychologie de Lamarck," simultaneously with the appearance in the Revue de philosophic of an article entitled "Biologie et transformisme," by M. Driesch, the German vitalist whose name has been made popular in France by M. Bergson, and with the publication by the Revue du Mois of an essay by M. de Vries, "Transformisme et mutation." It would be impossible to enumerate all the reports and discussions dealing with this subject. There is equal activity in the field of the physical sciences, and in that criticism of the general principles of science which is so intimately connected with the study of the great laws of physics. M. Bernard Brunhes, a physicist, and director of the observa- tory at Puy de D6me, has published a book of popular philosophy, La Degradation de l'Energie, which provoked some very penetra- ting criticism from M. Le Dantec in the Revue philosophique. M. Brunhes had taken an industrial and utilitarian point of view, one which makes this process easier of imaginative apprehension. M. Le Dantec regards such an anthropocentric explanation as a dangerous method, one which falsifies the conception of degra- 'Revue Scientifique, November 20, I909.</page><page sequence="19">No. 4.] PHILOSOPHY IN FRANCE, 1909. 391 dation of energy completely, and prevents us from grasping its real nature. To appreciate the import of this discussion it is necessary to know the sentiments which underlie it. M. Brunhes is a scientist who is friendly to religion, and he sees in the ideas of eternal conservation one of the causes of contemporary atheism. He does not conceal his antipathy for "that spirit of a priori affirmation which becomes intolerable in the theologians of mo- nism when they presume to disdain theology." M. Le Dantec, on the contrary, is a positivist who dreads extremely the inter- vention in scientific problems of metaphysical, or even of moral, ideas. He especially protests against a philosophical attitude which seems to him disastrous. But the discussion has only begun and it is almost certain that it will go further. It may be hoped that in the end this notion, which is generally ill-under- stood, and which has often been distorted by philosophers who had a concrete intuition of it, as for example by Spencer, will be defined as clearly as it should be, and that all the value for questions both within and beyond the limits of science which it implicitly contains will be brought out. The subject of M. Myerson's remarkable work, Identit6 et R&amp;tlitW, is closely related to the foregoing topic. This book shows its author's rare knowledge of the history of the sciences, and I would praise its thought more highly were I not afraid of showing partiality to conclusions so similar to my own. M. Meyerson verifies the guiding thought of the book by a close analysis of the notions of time, cause, law, inertia, matter, energy, and mechanism. This thought is in brief as follows: Every real explanation in science consists in identifying the antecedent with the consequent, and the effort towards such an identification, the most usual form of which is the principle of causality, is the psychological basis of atomism, of determinism, and of the laws of the conservation of matter and of energy. By a sort of analogy, it even serves as foundation for the tenacious belief of scientists in the basic unity of the chemical elements. In a single thesis only, I feel obliged to differ from M. Meyerson. He believes that Carnot's Law, by its affirmation of an irreversible series of states, sets a limit to this tendency of reason, and so</page><page sequence="20">392 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XIX. marks the precise point where nature opposes itself to the aspi- rations of thought.-Has he not been too quickly discouraged? Would not a profounder analysis of Carnot's Law, revealing it as an increasingly uniform diffusion of energy in matter and con- necting it with the phenomena of dissociation and of radio- activity, allow us on the contrary to see that its essential result is an effacement of differences between objects themselves, a progress towards identity? And could we not therefore say that our explanations follow the actual direction of change in the physical world? To be sure, we ought not to conclude that the essence of things satisfies the postulates of thought in principio. The truth seems rather to be that every given fact is in itself diverse, individual, unintelligible. This theme has recently been developed by an author already known under a pseudonym as one of our best novelists, and who has just published a work, Le Pluraclisme, under his real name, J. Boex Borel.1 This book is all the more interesting because its author seems to have reached his conclusions quite independently, without knowing either M. Meyerson's book or mine. His object is to show, by an examination of scientific facts, that the homogeneous cannot produce the heterogeneous, and that consequently the world is based on a fundamental diversity, and cannot be explained by the hypothesis of a primitive unity. From this he draws three conclusions: The first is that complete knowledge and absolute unknowability are alike impossible; the second, that instead of looking for identity, we must have recourse to analogies, by which he means imperfect resemblance, rather than analogies in the technical sense of the word; and the third, that since the un- known increases with the known, we cannot say that the de- velopment of science brings us nearer to any determinable goal. I cannot acquiesce unreservedly in all these conclusions. But the argument is certainly well justified when it leads us to see in the very material of science a radical heterogeneity which con- sequently produces a residue indestructible by any of our expla- nations, which always proceed by establishing identities. We must then join with M. Meyerson in the admission that there is 1M. Borel shared with his brother the collective pseudonym of J. H. Rosny.</page><page sequence="21">No. 4.] PHILOSOPHY IN FRANCE, 1909. 393 an obstacle to the complete realization of an ideal rational science; but the obstacle is the very existence of the world presented to us in sensation and opposed to us in action. In other words, it is true that we have always before us a multiplicity of individuals, distinct even when they are most alike. But we have an advan- tage in the fact that the world is becoming, and that this becoming, far from augmenting the diversity which embarrasses us, takes place according to laws which we can predict, and in the direction of a decrease in that original heterogeneity which we attest but cannot assimilate. Two things in the work which I have just mentioned seem to me of good omen. The first is the penetration into philosophy of that fertile idea which hinges the criticism of the sciences on the two cardinal concepts of the one and the many, of identity and difference. If the history of this movement of ideas, or rather of the resurrection of this ancient way of thinking in modern philosophy, ever comes to be written, it should not forget either Spencer, who understood its value but took it so to speak by the wrong end, or the learned, cautious and too little known philosopher whom the University of Geneva has just lost-Jean Jacques Gourd, the author of Le Phdnom~ne and of Les trois Diactectigues. The second feature, yet more important, is the realistic, positive, and constructive character of these works in epistemology. It is true that they treat of ideas which have been discussed by philosophers ever since philosophy was first taught, but they no longer use the conceptual method. They deal with these ideas in the concrete, by a study of their history and of their applications. Formerly epistemology sought always to seize mind at its source, by an inner reflection on the act of think- ing, from which the explanation of all its effects was hoped for- as vain an enterprise as that of a man who should try to make himself more and more short-sighted in the hope of at last per- ceiving his own eye. Today men who philosophize begin to understand that one sins against the mind when in order to know it better one reverses the movement by which it constructs all its knowledge. They prefer to follow the onward impulse, al- ready so productive, which urges thought to establish in face of</page><page sequence="22">394 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. itself a world of things on which it sets its imprint, and then to become conscious of what it is itself by the twofold analysis of its most finished products and of the progress of its creations. And those who confine themselves to this sure and cautious method receive a high recompense. Their works, even when incomplete and faulty, even when planned in ignorance of others, have a common standard which allows of mutual rectification and completion, so that they can cooperate in building up a durable structure, instead of passing in review on the philosophic scene, like singers in a concert, each of whom goes through his passage of bravura, and then disappears in the wings followed by hisses or applause.
