VASILIKI GIANNOPOULOU  University of Oxford, vasiliki.giannopoulou@classics.ox.ac.uk      ◊      Ancient Mediterranean Sacrifice. Edited by Jennifer Wright KUNST and Zsuzsanna  VÁRHELYI .

If a reviewer must deal with a volume of essays by fifteen hands, about four socie- ties (Egypt, Israel, Greece, and the Roman Empire), and about five religions (add  Christianity to Roman paganism), he may be relieved that, to judge from the title,  he has to deal with one period, one sea, and one rite, but this feeling is deceptive:  the subject of this book, the rite of “sacrifice,” is controversial. David Frankfurter’s  essay, “Egyptian Religion and the Problem of the Category ‘Sacrifice’,” shows  that, if “sacrifice” means what Classicists commonly suppose, there was no such  thing in Egypt. Frankfurter’s essay is in the first section of the book, entitled  “Theorizing Sacrifice,” but the same evangel appears in an essay in the second  part, “Negotiating Power through Sacrifice,” for here James Rives, in “The Theol- ogy of Animal Sacrifice in the Ancient Greek World: Origins and Develop- ments,” shows that “sacrifice” was not an important subject for Greek and Roman  writers until well into the Common Era, a conclusion that means that early objec- tions to sacrifice, as by Xenophanes, were not objections to the rite, a subject that  did not interest these writers, but objections to eating certain foods. At this point,  the cautious reader (including the reviewer, sworn to caution) might wonder  when or where “sacrifice” is to be found, but this volume has not yet reached its  peak or nadir, its third section, “Imaginary Sacrifice,” in which Kathryn  McClymond, in “Don’t Cry Over Spilled Blood,” shows how the Mishnah deals  with “ritual errors” in the performance of sacrifice, but does so centuries after  Israelite sacrifices ceased to occur.   </page> <page sequence="2">  BOOK REVIEWS 475   McClymond raises the question of what “sacrifice” means. Does it mean  animal sacrifice more than, or instead of, vegetal or liquid sacrifice? The ancient  evidence says otherwise, and Stanley Stowers, in the lead essay in the “Theoriz- ing” section, conveys as much through his title, “The Religion of Plant and Ani- mal Offerings versus the Religion of Meanings, Essences, and Textual Mysteries.”  Stowers is unfair to essences, which include incense, but his attack on meanings  and mysteries is polemically understandable. A sacrificial offering was first of all a  donative, not a mammal. If an offering need not be a mammal, it need not be vio- lent, a conclusion that raises objections to the two best-known theories of sacri- fice, those of Walter Burkert and the French duo of J.-P. Vernant and Marcel  Detienne. When acts of violence are nonetheless associated with sacrifice, we  ought to interrogate our sources, as emerges from Zsuzsanna Várhely’s “Political  Murder and Sacrifice: From Roman Republic to Empire.” In “The Embarrass- ment of Blood: Early Christians and Others on Sacrifice, War, and Rational Wor- ship,” Laura Nasrallah does likewise, too, but includes state-sanctioned violence.  Roman and Christian writers who associate some killings with sacrifice are play- ing a prose version of the game that Albert Henrichs has shown that the tragedi- ans play—the game of rhetorical transgression.    Then there is the other stand-by of recent theories—the notion that sacri- fice consolidated communities. Once Christian emperors banned public pagan  sacrifices, private pagan sacrifices were all that remained, and so a rite that once  was sometimes communal (for it was never always so), became private, as noted  by Michele Renee Salzman in “The End of Public Sacrifice: Changing Defini- tions of Sacrifice in Post-Constantinian Rome and Italy.”   If scholars using the term “sacrifice” have been too sure of what it means,  they also have been too sure of the attitude of their sources—Henrichs’ lesson,  again, illustrated in this book by Fritz Graf’s “A Satirist’s Sacrifices: Lucian’s On  Sacrifices and the Contestation of Religious Traditions.” About sacrifice as about  other things, Lucian is funny because he is clear-minded. His image of Zeus walk- ing about Olympus, looking out portals for sacrificial smoke, for prayers, and for  hymns, captures the absurdities of communication with this anthropomorphic  god better than any Christian polemic, if only because Lucian’s image could be  turned against any such god. Yet as Graf says, Lucian’s critique is neither destruc- tive nor reformist. Here Graf links up with Rives’ point about the limits of ancient  pagan interest in any theory of sacrifice.    </page> <page sequence="3"> 476 BOOK REVIEWS   If a writer like Philo uses thusia, “what burns,” in lieu of common Hebrew  terms that mean “what ascends,” like holah, but that often mean something else,  like zebah shelamim and minchah do, then, as William K. Gilders shows, we can  trace the problem of defining sacrifice to several centuries before Christianity. In  the same spirit, Philippa Townsend, in “Bonds of Flesh and Blood: Porphyry,  Animal Sacrifice, and Empire,” shows that Porphyry was a relativist as well as  polemicist.    If the circumcision of Jesus counts as a sacrifice (and Andrew S. Jacobs ar- gues that it did, in “Passing: Jesus’ Circumcision and the Strategic Self-Sacrifice”)  and if the rabbinic “Story of the Ten Martyrs,” victims of Hadrianic persecution,  is one of sacrifice as well as martyrdom, as though the two terms were inter- changeable, then “sacrifice” has become all too capacious a term. This book’s two  studies that define sacrifice—“Symbol, Function, Theology, and Morality in the  Study of Priestly Ritual,” by Jonathan Klawans, and “Contesting the Meaning of  Animal Sacrifice,” by Daniel Ullucci—do not solve this problem. If, as Klawans  says, symbol is more important than ritual, how important can this one ritual be?  If Ullucci “contests” sacrifice’s meaning, what is that meaning? That most cau- tious of readers, the reviewer, is at a loss. This book is a mostly competent, and  occasionally excellent, study of a subject that is disappearing before our learned  eyes.
