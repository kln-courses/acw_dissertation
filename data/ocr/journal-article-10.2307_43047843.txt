ABSTRACT According to the Shemīhāzā narrative pain and sorrow are to be ascribed to the angels who rebelled against the Most High , and their offspring. The archangels saw their devastating work and reported it to the Most High who decided to punish them. A new era of bliss is promised. Although this narrative is characterized by extensive use of myth , it is primarily based on Genesis 6-9. The Genesis narrative, however , only serves as a starting-point and the description of the different events in the Shemīhāzā story goes far beyond this Old Testament passage. To highlight this difference , attention is paid to the Yah wist 's description of the fall of the sons of God and the flood story, and then compared with the Shemīhāzā narrative. Reference will also be made to the circumstances in which these narratives originated. Despite the same mythological background two totally different stories can be found in Genesis 6-9 and 1 Enoch 6-11. Although the latter was more influenced by mythical thought, it is based on the Genesis text. This paper's aim is to illustrate how the narratives about the sons of God and the flood functioned in the Genesis context and how they were reinterpreted and elaborated on in 1 Enoch 6-11. The differences between the two versions will be emphasized and reference will be made to the historical contexts in which they originated. The paper can be divided into three main sections: the fall of the sons of God, the story of the flood and the con- clusions. Genesis 6: 1-4 is treated as part of the Yahwisťs story of the incursion of sin and the judge- ment of Yahweh. Mythological elements were historized and made subservient to the intention of the Yahwist. I Enoch 6ff anchors itself in the Genesis narrative, but goes far beyond it: the sons of God are identified as angels, their sins are vividly described, etc. According to the flood story in Genesis 6:5ff God reacted to the sin of man and decided to wipe him from the face of the earth. Noah found favour in his eyes and escaped the devastating flood. After the flood at- tention is once again directed to this world and this earth. Once again the Enochic version is based on the Genesis story, but is filled out with a new content. The angels and their offspring are punished and the story is concluded with a description of the dawn of a new era of bliss. 1. THE FALL OF THE SONS OF GOD 1.1 Genesis 6:4-11 Genesis 6:4-1 1 forms the basis for the Enochic narrative of the origin of sin. To highlight this use of Scripture the Yahwist will be singled out and an attempt be made to determine his theological context. It will become clear that the story of the sons of God does not function in- dependently as a report on the rebellion of the heavenly beings, but is part of a narrative which illustrates the devastating effect of sin. 'Ungezählter Untersuchungen* (Haag 1972:680) have been devoted to Genesis 6:1-4 (Wes- termann 1972:68-76). From the viewpoint of literary criticism many problems may be raised (Oberforcher 1981:309-14). Some believed 'that absolutely nothing can be said with certainty about the source identification of this passage' (Noth 1972:28). Scholars also agree that myth 0254-8356/83 $3,00 Copyright by NTSSA</page><page sequence="2">NEOTESTAMENTICA 17 (1983) 29 underlies this unit. Hanson identifies it as the myth of the rebellion-in-heaven which occurred in many Near Eastern myths of the second millenium BCE and wherein cosmic disharmony is ascribed to 'the rebellion of certain members of the pantheon' (Hanson 1977:203). In the Genesis context this myth 'ist vom geschichtlichen Selbstverständnis Israels umgeprägt' (Schmidt 1971:159). In this paper Genesis 6: 1-4 is treated as part of the Yahwist and understood within the con- text of the incursion of sin, its spread and the punishment of Yahweh. These verses form an in- tegral part of the story about sin. It is interesting that the Old Testament does little theorizing about sin. It is, of course, replete with the records of men who sinned in various ways, but we seldom find theological reflection on the concept of sin. The Yahwist is an exception 'for never again did Israel speak in such universal terms of sin as exemplified in standardized models, and yet at the same time in such great detail' (von Rad 1967:154). Mention must first of all be made of the first person plural in reference to God which occurs in Genesis 1:26 (priestly writer). It is probable that the idea of a heavenly assembly can be found in these verses (cf Clines 1968:53-103). This notion can also be found elsewhere in the Old Testament and it was especially in the period of the priestly writer that imagery of the divine world and the heavenly beings became important (Miller 1978:12). This does not deny that Yahweh is the sole Creator of man. Yahweh had everything under control and all creative deeds were wrought by Yahweh alone. He merely decreed 'the decision in his council that 'ādām shall be in the image and likeness of 'elohîm' (Miller 1978:13). Man was thus made 'elohīm-'ike. In one way or another the 'ādām is related to the benë telohīm (cf von Rad 1967:149; Kraus 1972:70; Steck 1981:129-49). One gets the impression that the Yahwist contradicts this aspect in Genesis 3:22 where the close relationship between 'ādām and 'e lo him is evaluated negatively. The reason for this is that God's boundaries were exceeded. The distinction between the divine world and the human world was threatened. The position of Yahweh was not endangered - only that of the divine world. According to the Yahwist the 'ādām was prohibited to 'become like one of us'. Although 'ādām is closely related to the divine world certain definite limits were set (Miller 1978:20f). The same idea can be found in Genesis 11:1-9. A huge tower was to be built which would reach the heavens. The benè 'ādām intended to reach the divine world and once again man exceeded creaturely limits (Miller 1978:24). In Genesis 6:1-4 the opposite happened. The benè 'elohīm came down to mingle with the bānbt. They saw their beauty and took them to wife. In no way can these benè ' elohīm be iden- tified (Westermann 1972:68-70). According to the Yahwist the benè 'elohim were the in- habitants of the heavenly world. At times they appeared at the divine council and were used by God to carry out some definite tasks. The benē 'elohīm had little significance for the faith of Israel. Yahweh dominated the scene and his action in nature and history 'was so pervasive and direct that no room was left for other heavenly beings' (von Rad 1970:110). The word 'ben' does not mean that those beings were attached to God in a physical or a genealogical way, but that they belonged to the world of the heavenly beings (von Rad 1967:145; Lorentz 1964:120-7). Genesis 6:1-4 illustrates yet another catastrophic result of sin. At a certain point in time these benè 'Hohīm fell from their ranks and transgressed the limits which God had set. The frontiers which God had made had been exceeded. This was more serious than the preceding events. Now sin was no longer confined to the world of men. According to the Yahwist the first consequence of sin is a breach in the relationship with God: Adam and Eve had a fine relationship with God, but the moment they sinned they hid from God; due to the shattered relationship with God, the descendants of Cain took the sword</page><page sequence="3">30 THE USE OF SCRIPTURE IN 1 ENOCH 6-11 and the thirst for revenge and retaliation flourished; the evil of the benè ' Hohīm so disturbed the relationship with Yahweh that he decided to destroy man. A second consequence of sin is that human relationships have been broken: in the moment of their sin, when the relationship with God was broken, the relationship between Adam and Eve was also shattered because they became ashamed of each others presence; Cain's broken relationship with God gave rise to hatred and the thirst for revenge (Westermann 1974:104-8). The mingling of the benè 'Hohīm with the banbt also had serious consequences. Many problems are related to the position of verse 3 and the relationship between verse 4 and verses 1-2: did verse 3 originally form part of verses 1-4? Was it inserted at a later stage? Are the rfpīlīm the offspring of the union described in verse 2? (Oberforcher 1981:315-25; Van Selms 1967:102-3). Without sidestepping all the dif- ficult problems, one could say that the Yahwist wanted to illustrate man's corruption in these verses. He wanted to show that the result of this mixing of superhuman spiritual powers with man was a kind of 'demonic' invasion. This was a more profound disturbance. There was evidence of disruption within the human community and the decrees by which God separated the upper realm of the heavenly spiritual world from that of man were broken. There had been 'a deterioration of all the creation, which cannot be more frightfully conceived' (von Rad 1970:112). Reference must also be made to the '"dāmā motif in the Yahwist. It refers to the ground, the soil, the earth and ' ādām is closely related to it: in Genesis 2 the unordered chaos before the creation is due to the fact that no 'ādām existed to work the 'adāmā; it is man's task to care for the earth; the 'adāmā is the source for all good things and sustains man; man's sin disturbed the relationship with the 'adāmā, etc. (Miller 1978:37-42). To a certain extent one could say that Genesis 1-11 centres around 'adāmā and 'ādām. All the narratives clearly state that humanity 'cannot escape involvement with the 'ādāmāh nor can human existence be lived out in some other context. Indeed the nature of human being cannot really be defined simply as 'ādām; it is 'ādām vis à vis 'ādāmāh' (Miller 1978:41). The Yahwist, who lived in the time of David and Solomon, was one of Israel's earliest and most profound theologians (Brueggemann 1968:156; Wolff 1966:131ff). In one of the most splendid and glorious periods in Israel's history he gave an account of the origin of sin, its spread and God's judgement. When Genesis 6:4-11 is used as reference for 1 Enoch 6-11 the following must be kept in mind: it originated in a time of peace; although myth may underlie this unit, it was demythologized; it forms an integral part of the Yahwist's story of sin and punishment; 'ādām was created in the likeness of the benè ' Hohīm , but sin originated when man exceeded God's boundaries and wanted to become like the heavenly beings; the bene 'elohīm did the opposite and their deeds must be understood in the light of the limits which God had set and the sin of 'ādām; sin has grave consequences (the relationship between God and man, man and man, and man and earth is shattered) and Genesis 6: 1-4 form part of this narrative sequence; this illustrates that Yahweh is closely involved with everything on earth and in heaven, and that he has everything under control; the benë 'elohīm were not angels and their deed served to illustrate that sin also extended to heavenly beings; the 'adāmā motif en- sures that the Yahwist's sin stories are not replaced to primordial times, but that they centre around historical man and his world. 1.2 1 Enoch 6:1-8; 7:1-7; 8:4 Due to inconsistencies, abrupt changes in subject, lack of literary sequence and diversity of motifs (Dimant 1978:323), one can clearly distinguish between a Shemīhāzā and an cAsa'el narrative in 1 Enoch 6:6-11 (Hanson 1977:197; Nickelsburg 1977:384-6; cf Collins 1978:315-6).</page><page sequence="4">NEOTESTAMENTICA 17 (1983) 3 1 To highlight the use of Scripture in Enoch attention will be paid to the story of Shemihāzā. Probably this forms the oldest stratum of 1 Enoch 6-1 1 and was only in the course of time ex- panded with material about cAsa,el. In the Shemihāzā narrative the old mythical thought is once again revived: Thus a familiar phenomenon is encountered anew: a mythic pattern of thought, absorbed into early Yahwism and modified almost beyond recognition in the service of a new theologoumenon, is retrieved by later apocalypticism and reinfused with some of its original meaning' (Hanson 1977: 203). Israel vehemently rejected the mythical systems of their neighbours in favour of their own forms of expression. These myths, however, never lost their vitality and in an era of turmoil and hardship they were re-used to explain human suffering and to give meaning to life (Han- son 1977:203, 204-18). Before we commence with Enoch's story, brief reference must be made to the importance of angels in the postexilic times. A few reasons can be given for this. One deals with the absence of God in history. Behind the apocalyptist lurked the fear that God had abandoned his people altogether. This rude awakening did not come from a specific theory but was based on their ex- perience of history. They increasingly experienced the absence of God from that stage of history in which they themselves lived. He no longer miraculously intervened in the history of his people as in the former days (Bauckham 1978:20). Due to this discouraging idea that God was absent from history, angels began to play a more important role. They formed a vital bridge between God and his universe. There was also another reason for the emergence of an angelology: the problem of suffering. The Israelites and especially the righteous suffered severely. Many attempts have been made to explain suffering and they came to the conclusion that suffering is closely linked with the problem of evil. The angels to whom God had given authority had rebelled and had taken the power to reign into their own hands. And since 'human life and the life of the universe were in the grip of malignant powers who had wrested the authority from the hands of God . . . the problem of human suffering was seen to be part of the greater problem of cosmic evil* (Russell 1976:238). 1.2.1 The plot The author of the Shemihāzā narrative states that the revolt began when the children of men multiplied and beautiful daughters were born to them. He places the reader in heaven and fur- nishes him with a description of what happened among the angels. The angels saw these beautiful women on earth and desired them. They discussed the possibility of taking them to wife and begetting children. Their leader, Shemihāzā, expressed his fears that not all the angels would persevere and that he alone would be punished. All two hundred angels then took an oath and bound themselves with curses not to abandon this plan. Typical of this period is that all the unnamed angels of the Old Testament are counted, named and ordered. According to Enoch there were two hundred under the leadership of Shemihāzā and they were subdivided into ten groups, each with their own leader. In the days of Jared these angels descended on mount Hermon (Charles 1913: 191). Because Hermon was a cosmic mountain where the divine King was enthroned, the descent of the angels on it highlights their rebellion (Hanson 1977:199). 1.2.2 Sexual commingling Immediately after their descent each one chose a wife. Emphasis is laid on the sexual activities of the angels: ' . . they began to go in unto them and were promiscuous with the women* (Di- mant 1978:325). The angels furthermore taught them charms, enchantments, cutting of roots and knowledge of certain plants.</page><page sequence="5">32 THE USE OF SCRIPTURE IN I ENOCH 6-1 1 1.2.3 The result The sexual commingling had devastating effects. The women became pregnant and giants, whose height was three thousand ells, were born. Four things are ascribed to these angels: they consumed men's acquisitions; they devoured mankind; after that the animals in the air, sea and on land were devoured; then they devoured each other's flesh and drank blood. The sins of the angels are the following: lusting after the women and taking them as their wives; wishing to beget children; taking an oath to commit the crime; descending on mount Hermon; defiling themselves with the women; teaching them charms; begetting giants who committed great crimes; the leader, Shemīhāzā, is also guilty of inciting the angels to take the oath (Dimant 1978:325). This world is in the hands of the giants and that is the reason for human suffering. The author of the Shemīhāzā story wanted to link his narrative to that of Genesis 6: 1-4, but he did it in his own way. Reading this narrative one enters into a strange world with strange characters performing strange deeds. Only the broad outline of and allusions to Genesis 6:1-4 remind one of the story of the Yahwist. The story of Shemīhāzā differs greatly from that of the Yahwist. Some of these differences can be mentioned: in Enoch mythical images are employed while in the Yahwist they are demythologized; the author describes the general setting with reference to Genesis 6:1 but it is merely a paraphrasing of it; the benè ' eloh'm are identified as angels and names are given to them; the reference to the banot in Genesis 6: 1 is expanded and the women are described as beautiful and comely; in Enoch the stress is laid on the sexual com- mingling of the angels and the women; the intercourse of the sons of God with the daughters of men is depicted as a neutral act, but in Enoch it is described as rebellion against the Most High; the angels and not 'adam are kept responsible for all the evil, while no reference to the wickedness of angels or their offspring can be found in the Genesis narrative; the rebellion of the angels was clearly premeditated, but according to the Yahwist the ' adam fell in a weak mo- ment when temptation could no longer be resisted; the Enoch story removes the attention from the ' adam and the ,adama to the angels and heaven; after their descent the angels are in control of this world, while the Yahwist emphatically states that God has the control in his hands. Other important elements of the Yahwisťs theology were also grossly neglected - the impor- tant connection between sin and judgement, the serious consequences of sin, and so forth, were not touched upon. One could say that the Genesis narrative only served as a starting- point and that the description of the different events in Enoch went far beyond the Old Testa- ment passage. 2. THE FLOOD STORY 2.1 Genesis 6:5-9:17 The flood story 'scheint somit ursprünglich ein selbständiger Erzählstoff gewesen zu sein, der verschiedentlich aufgenommen und bearbeitet worden ist' (Fritz 1982:603). In the Gilgamesh epic it formed part of the plans of the gods to reduce the population growth of man. According to the Atramhasis myth, men were created to relief the work-load of the gods. The increase of men and their hard labour caused a great noise. Enlil, who suffered from sleeplessness due to this, reported the matter to the other gods. To control the birth rate and reduce the noise the gods decided to send illness, drought and famine, but the expected results were not achieved. Then they resolved to send a devastating flood. It must be kept in mind that the flood was a deliberate act of the gods. Atramhasis was informed by Enki about the flood and he built an ark to escape the deluge (Fritz 1982:604-8; Hanson 1977:202-18).</page><page sequence="6">NEOTESTAMENTICA 17 (1983) 33 The Yahwist reinterpreted the mythical flood narrative and shaped it according to his own theological views. All polytheistic elements were removed and Yahweh is described as taking the initiative. He himself looked down and saw the evil in the heart of the ' ādām . The close relationship between sin and judgement can also be seen in this narrative. By using a bold anthropomorphism the Yahwist says that Yahweh 'changed his mind' about man. He felt sorry that he had ever created ' ādām (von Rad 1970: 1 12-4). Yahweh then decided to blot man from the 'face of the ground'. Man himself was responsible for his destruction. This perspective excludes any arbitrary or despotic acts of gods or Yahweh (Fritz 1982: 609-10). The Yahwist also inserted another element in his flood narrative: Yahweh' s responsibility for his creation and 'ādām. After the flood 'ist alles auf den Erhalt der Schöpfung hin ange- legt' (Fritz 1982:612). The 'adāmā and the ' ādām are once again standing in the centre. Life will be continued under the guidance of Yahweh in this world and on this earth. The ' ādām must receive the blessing of God here and now on this &gt;adāmā (Miller 1978:41). The perpetual order of the seasons will remain for ever. According to Genesis 8:21 no essential difference ex- ists between man before and after the flood. His thoughts and deeds remain sinful. In spite of this God promises never to destroy the 'adāmā again (Fritz 1982:61 1 ; cf Petersen 1976:438-46). The priestly writer used the Yahwist's version but also made some alterations: all events received a new chronology; complete instructions for the building of the ark were given; because the cult was only instituted at Sinai references to Noah's sacrifice and the distinction between clean and unclean were omitted, and so on. He also elaborated on the Yahwist's ver- sion by stating that Noah was righteous. Like his grandfather Enoch, he 'walked with God' (Gn 5:24). The situation described in Genesis 6:9-1 1 refers not only to the evil of man but to the universal corruption at large on the earth. The corruption stretched further them man and had a more cosmic meaning (Habel 1971:30). Like the Yahwist the whole creation received emphasis after the flood. God has made a covenant and this signifies his intention never to destroy the 'adāmā again. The rainbow serves as a visible sign of the covenant. Man is once again summoned to be fruitful and to multiply and to All the earth; once again it is stressed that man is God's vice-regent, operating in God's image and controlling the earth (Habel 1971:40). This 'Ergänzung der Schöpfungsordnung, der Rückgriff auf die in der Schöpfung festgelegte Bestimmung des Menschen und die Zusage Jahwes, keine neue Flut mehr kommen zu lassen, bringen die Schöpfung zu ihrer vollen Geltung' (Fritz 1982:614; cf Schmidt 1967). The main elements may be summarized thus: Yahweh himself looked down from heaven and saw the evil; once again Yahweh's involvement with man and his activities on earth is em- phasized; due to man's failure to be God's ben 'ādām and the benè 9 Hohīm , who worsened the situation, the deluge was sent; Noah found favour in God's eyes; after the flood God once again restored life on this earth. 2.2 I Enoch 9:1-11:2 2.2. 1 The intercession of the angles The earth and its inhabitants reacted to the evil of the offspring of the angels. Their plea was heard. Michael, Uriel and Gabriel looked down from heaven and saw all the blood, violence and wickedness on earth. Not all the angels rebelled against God. Myriads remained faithful to him. Some of these angels belonged to the number of the principal or superior angels, and formed the elite of the heavenly hierarchy (Russell 1976:243). Michael, Uriel and Gabriel</page><page sequence="7">34 THE USE OF SCRIPTURE IN 1 ENOCH 6-1 1 belonged to this group. Elsewhere they are described as those who are standing on 'the sides of the Lord of Spirits' (40:2). They decided to bring the case before the Lord of the ages. Interesting is the way in which the Most High is addressed. He is called Lord of lords, God of gods, King of kings and God of ages; his throne is for all generations, and his name holy, glorious and blessed to all eternity; he is praised as the One who is the Creator of all and who has power over all things; he sees all things and nothing is hidden from his eyes. Typical of this period's theology is the em- phasis on the Most High's foreknowledge (Hanson 1977:200). In spite of this the angels must still inform him about the evil on earth. This prayer reveals something of a charge against God for not acting against the evildoers and not supporting the faithful. Their intercession reveals something of a pessimistic trend: God is not interested in this world anymore. 2.2.2 God's judgement The Most High reacts and each angel receives a specific task. In accordance with the view about angels during this period the superior class of angels reveals to men God's secrets concer- ning heaven and earth (Russell 1976:242). In the punishment of the angels and their offspring the Most High is assisted by the archangels. Uriel must warn Noah, the son of Lamech, about the approaching end. The deluge will come upon the earth and destroy everything. He is in- structed how to escape and how his seed may be preserved for all generations. Noah is called a righteous man. This does not fit in well with the narrative. We have not yet heard of a wicked community to which Noah would be an exception (Nickelsburg 1977:388). The expression 'the plant of righteousness and truth' perhaps refers to 'the self-consciousness of sectarian apocalypticism' (Hanson 1977:201). Gabriel is to destroy the giants. They are called by dif- ferent names: bastards, reprobates, children of fornication and children of the watchers. These giants have to slay each other in the presence of their parents. No request of their fathers must be granted. Michael's task differs from that of Gabriel. Shemīhāzā and all the other angels who defiled themselves with the women are to be bound. The spirits of the giants must be destroyed. All perversity and wickedness must be eradicated from the earth. 2.2.3 God's restoration In 1 Enoch 10: 15-16 the attention is focused on the eschaton. This whole narrative was reinter- preted from the perspective of apocalyptic eschatology. The primordial drama describes the origin of evil, the decision of the angels and the evil of the giants. The last act in this drama will take place when 'all the souls of lust and the sons of the watchers' are destroyed and all evil eradicated. The primordial is extended to include the whole period from the original rebellion of the divine beings to the eschaton (Hanson 1977:201; cf Collins 1974:21-43; Collins 1978:315-20). A. new era of restoration is introduced with the appearance of 'the plant of righteousness and truth'. The author wanders off to a very sensuous picture of the messianic bliss (Charles 1913:194 nl7). It will be a time of blessing in which the works of righteousness and truth shall be planted in truth and joy; the righteous will beget thousands of children; a time of peace will be experienced; the earth will be filled with righteousness; all desirable trees will be planted and they will yield in abundance; the earth will be cleansed from all evil and never again will defilement, sin, punishment, torment be sent upon the earth; all men will become righteous and all men will offer praise to the Lord. The story of Shemīhāzā is a narrative which is written from the perspective of apocalyptic eschatology. To explain this statement, brief reference must be made to the context in which it originated. It is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to reconstruct the exact historical situa- tion. In the course of time different dates of origin were proposed which ranged from the</page><page sequence="8">NEOTESTAMENTICA 17 (1983) 35 fourth to the second century BCE (cf Collins 1979:37; Nickelsburg 1981a:212-4). The time of the Diadochi (323-302 BCE) is one possibility (Nickelsburg 1981b:43-5). The two decades of the Diadochi were a period of bloodshed and assassination. Palestine especially felt the bitter effect of these wars (Nickelsburg 1977:391). This theory, like all others, may seem very attrac- tive, but they all lack historical proof. Although any attempt to reconstruct a specific historical situation may seem tentative, even futile, one can conclude that the Shemīhāzā narrative re- flects a world of distress (Collins 1978:321). A measure of this hardship and utter despair can already be detected in the prayer of the angels. This is not a general statement on the problem of evil, but it is a 'bitter and desperate cry of our author's own people' (Nickelsburg 1977:389). The period before the flood is described as one of warfare, plunder, bloodshed and brutal acts. The situation became intolerable when the community members were disfranchised from the institutional structures and reduced to powerlessness. Their existence 'became marginal, their orientation confused' (Hanson 1976a:30). This situation caused a crisis of faith: Where is God and why does He not intervene? Accordingly a feeling of alienation developed. In such circum- stances men usually resort to apocalyptic eschatology. It can be defined 'as a religious perspec- tive which focuses on the disclosure ... to the elect of the cosmic vision of Yahweh's sover- eignty - especially as it relates to his acting to deliver his faithful - which disclosure the vision- aries have largely ceased to translate into the terms of plain history, real politics, and human instrumentality due to a pessimistic view of reality growing out of the bleak postexilic condi- tions within which those associated with the visionaries found themselves. Those conditions seemed unsuitable to them as a context for the envisioned restoration of Yahweh's people' (Hanson 1979:1 If). Apocalyptic eschatology enabled the people at the time of origin of the Shemīhāzā narrative to construct an alternative universe of meaning and it gave them a vision in which they could describe God's intervention, the eradication of all evil, the punishment of the evildoers and their own vindication. This perspective helped them to maintain their identity and to survive in a situation which belies every possible hope. For those who adhere to apoca- lyptic eschatology the significance and power of this world are reduced (Hanson 1976a:30). One could say that apocalyptic eschatology flourishes in circumstances where the structures of this world are denied, a feeling of alienation develops and the salvation of God is described solely in terms of a future event (cf Hanson 1976b: 389-4 13). An old mythic pattern was used by the author of the Shemīhāzā narrative to give content to his apocalyptic vision. Mythical elements were employed to explain why they themselves were powerless to eradicate all evil. This was due to the fall of the angels in heaven, who defiled themselves with women and taught them evil things, whose offspring, the giants, still populate the world and continue the wickedness of their fathers. With the help of myth they could also express their fervent hope for the intervention of the Most High. He will accomplish that which lies beyond human power: the eradication of evil and the recreation of a perfect order (Hanson 1977:219). The Shemīhāzā narrative originated in a time of despair. Because people could no longer identify themselves with the current social and political structures, they resorted to apocalyptic eschatology. This perspective enabled them to keep faith amidst tribulations by replacing God's intervention to the eschaton. Genesis 6:5-9:17 served as starting-point, but once again went far beyond it: 1 Enoch 7:6 refers to Genesis 4:10, but in the latter case the blood called from the earth, as in Genesis 6:9; Noah is also called righteous, but its occur- rence in 1 Enoch is strange; a turning-point in the suffering was reached when the angels and not Yah weh looked down and decided to report the events to the Most High; Noah and the flood play a very minor role in the Shemīhāzā narrative; the idea of a new era is</page><page sequence="9">36 THE USE OF SCRIPTURE IN 1 ENOCH 6-1 1 based on the Genesis narrative, but is filled out with a different content. 3. CONCLUSIONS Without going into detail, the following can serve as main conclusions: 3.1 The Yahwist originated in a time of peace and glory. This world was viewed favourably and accepted as the place for God's intervention. God's salvation could still be realized within the context of Israel's history and the history of the world. The Shemīhāzā narrative originated in a time of great turmoil and suffering. This world and its structures were viewed as an unfit place for the realization of God's salvation. They have therefore ceased to translate the salvation into the terms of plain history and real politics. 3.2 Due to this positive evaluation of the world, the Yahwist was not primarily interested in eschatology. Due to circumstances of despair, people have taken recourse to apocalyptic eschatology. The whole Shemīhāzā narrative has been interpreted from this perspective. 3.3 Myth underlies Genesis 6:1-4 but it was historized and made serviceable to the theological intentions of the Yahwist. In the Shemīhāzā narrative the Genesis story formed the basis, but it was expanded with mythical material. 3.4 The Yahwist has only used the mythological motif of heavenly beings to illustrate how the benē &gt;elohīm exceeded the limits which God had set. The author of the Shemīhāzā narrative used Genesis 6:1-4 and employed mythical elements to describe the origin of sin. 3.5 In Genesis 6: 1-4 benè ' elohīm refers to heavenly beings. In 1 Enoch 6 they have been interpreted as angels and named. 3.6 Myth also underlies the flood story in Genesis, but it was once again historized and used to explain the result of man's evil on earth. The flood story of Genesis was used to illustrate how the wicked angels and their offspr- ing were punished. 3.7 After the flood man is still evil, but due to this positive attitude towards this world God nevertheless continues to care for man and his creation. After God's judgement and flood, the eschaton will appear introducing a time of bliss characterized by extraordinary men and events. 3.8 According to the Yahwist (and the priestly writer) God is closely involved with events on earth. He sees what is happening, He speaks to man and He personally intervenes. In the Shemīhāzā narrative the Most High is far away. The archangels inform him about the evil and they fulfil his tasks on earth. 3.9 The Yahwist wanted to direct the attention of his people to this earth, to explain the origin of man's sin, to illustrate its grave consequences and to describe God's act of grace with 'adam on this 'adāmā. The author of the Shemīhāzā narrative wanted to strengthen the faith of his people by re- lating the origin of sin to the fall of angels in heaven, explaining the present suffering as the work of their offspring and giving hope for a new era in which God's salvation will be experienced. 3.10 Although the Yahwist used old myths they were absorbed in early Yahwism and modi- fied almost beyond recognition. The author of the Shemīhāzā narrative has used the Genesis narratives as a starting-</page><page sequence="10">NEOTESTAMENTICA 17 (1983) 37 point, but went far beyond them and filled them out with mythical elements to create a new story, which resembles the old one, but which is totally different and which func- tions differently.
