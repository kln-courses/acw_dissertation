<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE PERISCOPE * (A Survey of Current Publications)* Conducted by FLORENCE HALL SENDER, Associate Editor Teacher, Teach Thyself.--Alexander Meiklejohn in the ADULT EDUCA- TION JOURNAL, 2: 120-129, July, 1943, reminds teachers that before the German people can be re-educated there must be re-education for ourselves. "To say the nations of the earth shall live together on terms of equality and justice and to say, at the same time, that each nation shall keep intact its own sovereignty, its own commitment to its own self-interest-to say both these things is a flat contradiction in terms. It is the insanity of that contradic- * Material believed to be suitable for notice in this department may be sent to Mrs. Florence Hall Sender, care of Professor Ram6n Sender, Amherst College, Amherst, Massachusetts.</page><page sequence="2">THE PERISCOPE 467 tion which has driven the powerful, brooding mind of Germany into open and brutal madness. But the same contradiction has, in more subtle forms, been undermining the sanity and integrity of the tradition of human freedom and equality, wherever that tradition has prevailed. That contradiction must be resolved. Both victors and vanquished must think it through. The reasonable- ness which resolves such conflicts-let us never forget-is a cooperative enter- prise .... Are we Americans and our Allies ready and eager to play our parts in that enterprise ? Are we willing to submit our wills, our lives, our fortunes to the common will of an organized humanity? . . . If not, then humanity will again have chosen, or will have fallen into, the ways of Violence. One would hope that, if that disaster must again come upon us, there might at least be an end of self-deception about it. Let us, at least, recognize that, if we are living one manner of life, we can not teach another. .... The responsibilities of world citizenship are discussed, and the need for a system of world-education. "That citizenship will require of us not only the technical efficiency, the personal initiative, in which we already excel. It will require also that we think about human freedom and equality. Just as our forefathers, having learned from England and France, led the way in devising a democratic form of life or a national economy, so may we lead and follow in the creating of a democratic international economy. That is our destiny. If we meet it courageously and intelligently, we shall find in it our own re-educa- tion." Education After the War.-Bertrand Russell in AMERICAN MERCURY, 57: 194-203, August, 1943, states that ". . . national education will have to be subject to international control if the world is to be safe from such disasters as it is now enduring .... There must be an educational system promoted by the international authority, designed to give instruction free from national bias, to produce textbooks and works of research calculated to encourage a universal human loyalty rather than a sectional devotion to some part of the human race even at the cost of war, and to train teachers with a well-informed belief in the principles upon which any supernational authority must rest. ... ." The central institution for such an educational system would be an interna- tional university in neutral territory. Its functions would be both academic and propagandistic, the latter to promote loyalty to international ideals and the prevention of war. Its charter would be a Bill of Rights, and it would be open to all races, religions, political opinions, but for postgraduates only, for whom there would be fellowships. The teaching of history, economics, and the social sciences would be stressed. There would be an international licensing board for both texts and teachers, and teachers in training colleges would be encouraged to study at the international university. To those who object to "propaganda" Mr. Russell says: "In the modern world any government which foregoes such ideological weapons is doomed to extinction and the most important of these weapons is education.... A new world is needed, and the battle of the democracies must be inspired by the hope of creating it. Our battle must not be purely defensive, it must be inspired by a new hope and a new vision." When an international authority, "strong enough and resolute enough to prevent the recurrence of world wars", is set up, "philosophers, historians, economists, men of science will be liberated from the</page><page sequence="3">468 HISPANIA nightmare oppressions that have impeded their creativeness. Our times of darkness may be succeeded by a great age, in which a new productiveness will be generated by new hopes and wider loyalties." Education: A Never-ending Process.-Mark Starr in FREE WORLD, 6: 65-69, July, 1943, pleads for adult education in general, but especially in a city like New York, where 63% of the adult population over twenty-five years of age have completed eight school years or less, 23% have completed less than five. "Adult education should teach us how to live together, to understand ourselves and the work we do, and most important, our relations to the com- munity and to the peoples and nations of the world ... ." He refers especially to the need of trade-school courses and courses in health, nutrition, recreation, literature, music, and the like. The author wonders why so little attention has been paid to adult education, and concludes that "Few people have the imagination and foresight to recognize its benefits. The opponents and critics of adult education-who repeat the same arguments made against public-school education in the days of Horace Mann-have on their side the innate conservatism, the fear of the new, the static mind-people timorous and confused in the face of any change and also those with a vested interest in ignorance. "Educational results are always hard to measure. Yet if the future historian is wise, he will be able to measure the success of adult education in New York City, . . . by noting whether men and women understand each other better; whether youth and age, town and country, labor and capital have a greater mutual knowledge of each other; whether racial tensions have been lessened by intercultural knowledge and activity; whether industrial and political frictions have been reduced; whether a large ratio of our citizens exercises its voting rights, and upon the basis of an intelligent study of the facts; whether there is better compliance with laws, more libraries, fewer jails; and whether men and women of different nations know each other and have broadened their vision to create a free world. ... ." New Techniques in Mass-Education.-Orson Welles in the ADULT EDU- CATION JOURNAL, 2: 92-93, April, 1943, states that radio and the mo- tion picture are fundamentally instruments of world education. "In this shrinking world of ours, adult education must first enlist in the war against provincialism. Exactly as long as the proposition that all men are created equal is a faith real enough for men to die for it, educators, which means every one of us in possession of the instruments of education, are sworn to the tremen- dous task of telling people about each other-about their works, which are called wisdom and culture. Winning the war depends on this. Pan Americanism, for instance-which is a sort of hemisphere sketch of the healthy, sensible, grown-up world we're fighting for- . . is a requisite for our victory. .... And making the dream of Inter-American unity come true is less a job for diplomatists than it is for educators. .. ." Steps to Unity.-Samuel Guy Inman in the INTER-AMERICAN, 2: 14-16, July, 1943, finds the American Century idea "a dangerous one for the future of Pan Americanism," for the more successful prosecution of which he sug-</page><page sequence="4">THE PERISCOPE 469 gests the establishment of an Association of American Nations "built on the past experiences of the Pan American movement and the most recent develop- ments of political science..... It calls for a consolidation of the Inter-American cooperation which has been loosely developed since 1890 . . . in political, eco- nomic, social, and cultural cooperation." Each country may send as many delegates as desired to the legislative ses- sions of the Association, though each nation will have only one vote. The President will be elected and the Secretariat will be the Pan American Union in Washington. The Executive Council will meet every year, rotating among the American capitals. Membership will consist of the President, the twenty- one Foreign Ministers, the heads of the Inter-American corporations, and five outstanding Inter-American statesmen elected by the Association. Present government and inter-government committees, such as the Inter- American Coffee Board and International Labor Office, will be organized into ten corporations: the Inter-American Juridical Institute, to be located in Rio de Janeiro; the Inter-American Finance and Economic Corporation, in Wash- ington; the Inter-American Section of the International Labor Office, Buenos Aires; the Inter-American Transportation Corporation, in Santiago de Chile; the Inter-American Sanitary Corporation, Lima, Peru; the Inter-American Agricultural Corporation, San Jose, Costa Rica; the Inter-American Immigra- tion Corporation, Bogoti, Colombia; the Inter-American Board of Women, Montevideo, Uruguay; the Inter-American Cultural Corporation, Mexico; the Inter-American Colonization Board, Havana. "Such a plan largely eliminates the old criticisms that Pan Americanism is purely a matter for diplomats, that it is concentrated. in Washington, and does not appeal to the public .... A mighty lift to post-war planning as well as a more closely knit America would result if this peculiarly favored hemisphere would provide leadership, and provide it now 1" AMERICAN ANTIQUITY, 9: 1-160, July, 1943. "Too much has been learned in recent years to permit us to picture our aborigines as rock-ribbed isolationists" is stated at the beginning of this issue of AMERICAN AN- TIQUITY devoted solely to Latin America, and which goes to several Latin American republics for the first time under an exchange agreement with the Joint Committee on Latin American Studies.

Smith in the INTER-AMERICAN, 2: 30-31, July, 1943, says that "With the publication of Pail Kelemen's MEDIAE- VAL AMERICAN ART another field of Latin American culture is laid open . . . all that it is essential to know about the early art and architecture of our hemisphere .... "Since the aim of the book is to present the art of pre-Colombian America as a subject technically and esthetically worthy of comparison with the better- known production of Europe and Asia, the author has wisely concentrated upon the areas of highest achievement rather than attempting to produce an encyclopedic account of everything that was done in all parts of America. "Consideration of style rather than chronological treatment is the keynote of this book. .... Take, for instance, the chapter on sculpture, which for Mr. Kelemen is the most readily understandable of the arts. One by one he singles out examples of the dominant regional types, the broadly modelled, intensely plastic Aztec statues, the incisively linear, nervous Totonac reliefs, the softly rounded, almost illusionistic contours of Mayan figures. By comparing these with technically and spiritually similar objects found in other regions the author establishes a feeling for that illusive and indispensable quality known as style. In this way the essential spirit of works of art is discovered, as they are brought from the gloomy halls and dusty cases of the archeologist and the ethnographer to the light of day. In this way the layman is introduced to the startling realism of Tarascan and Peruvian statuettes and anthropomorphic vessels, which he is led to contrast with the boisterous, barbaric stylizations of Zapotec sculpture and the golden plates of Pan. He gains a key to an under- standing of the heroic simplicity of Inca building in relation to the bejewelled faqades of the Mayas or the baroque ornament of the Aztecs." Uncle Tom's Cabin in Brazil.-Barbara Hadley in the INTER-AMERICAN, 2: 26-27, October, 1943, writes of the influence of Lincoln and Harriet Beecher Stowe still to be found in Brazil, in the files of the "sophisticated magazines of Rio, as well as in the small papers of ancient typography in the isolated provincial towns of the country." Lincoln's life was frequently the subject of poems, articles, dedications. Uncle Tom's Cabin, published serially and in several Brazilian editions, was the subject also of plays and poems, as well as the inspiration for a series of novels and stories expressing hatred of slavery. The play itself had a tremen- dous influence in the Brazilian Abolitionist movement. There were various adaptations, for upper-class audiences and for popular groups, where the popular circus spread the abolitionist gospel. A contemporary version may be seen today in the Circo Piolin in a working class suburb of Sao Paulo. Whites, in extravagant make-up, play the Negro roles, and there are constant and direct appeals to the audience from Eliza, Uncle Tom, and the Abolitionist Congressman, with the desired enthusiastic reactions. Piolin has added a farcical element in Joaquim, a Brazilian clown, slave-of-all-work on the plantation, and a fool. By flattery he secures his freedom from his mistress, becomes affected in manner and dress, buys a slave who carries a green umbrella over him wherever he goes, calls himself "white" and refers to his former master's friends as his chums. But he</page><page sequence="6">THE PERISCOPE 471 redeems himself in the end by selling himself back into slavery to help pur- chase the freedom of Eliza's son. Southey and Brazil.-J. de Sousa-Leao in the MODERN LANGUAGE REVIEW (London), 38: 180-191, July, 1943, states that Gilberto Freyre's article More About Southey led him to reach for unpublished documents of Southey on Brazil. Notes for Southey's HISTORY OF BRAZIL were found, as well as letters relating to his Brazilian research, although apparently his, and the first, Brazilian historical bibliography is lost. The letters reveal that Southey gained fame as an author on Portuguese-Brazilian subjects, and was often sought by writers for advice on these subjects. Critics expressed surprise that he carried on only the Brazilian part of his HISTORY OF PORTUGAL, but he insisted that he was the one to do it, and that it would be to the Brazilians, "when they are a powerful nation-what Herodotus is to Europe." His marvelous critical sense and perspective is especially significant in view of the scarcity of docu- ments and the fact that he had never been in Brazil. Writing in 1806 he explained that "the times being South America mad, any account of Brazil, instead of being the.last work in the series, must be the first." His collection of Spanish and Portuguese books was considered the finest private collection in England, with the exception of that of Lord Stuart of Rothesay. Southey also desired to write a HISTORY OF THE MONASTIC OR- DERS. And he was attracted to the conquering of South American jungles by bandeirantes, and to the semi-religious struggles between Brazilians, French, and Dutch, as he had been to knight-errantry, the Cid, Amadis, and Palmerin. Light Reading in Sixteenth-Century Spanish America.-Irving A. Leonard in the BULLETIN OF THE PAN AMERICAN UNION, 77: 493-499, Sep- tember, 1943, points out that reading was much more enjoyable than com- monly thought by historians bitter over royal decrees; that the study of titles and descriptions of books shipped from Spain to the colonies in the sixteenth century reveals a far more tolerant attitude on the part of the Spanish authorities than is ordinarily assumed. Emphasis was on the fact that such works were not for the Indians. Almost all the works that seem to have been most popular, according to the numbers shipped from Spain, were disap- proved, though only the "innocuous" SELVA DE AVENTURAS was officially banned by the Inquisition. We are also told that the Church sought to popularize romances a lo divino, but that it is quite evident that the "colonial appetite preferred more savory meat." Most read were the sentimental romances of chivalry, and the less bulky sentimental tales. AMADIS DE GAULA was popular, but thrice popular was his great-great grandson, DON FLORISEL DE NIQUEA. AMADIS shared his popularity with his son, ESPLANDIAN, and with his great grand- son, AMADIS DE GRECIA. His grandson LISUARTE DE GRECIA, however, was not the colonial thriller that the original hero was. More popular than PALMERIN DE INGLATERRA, too, was his son PRIMALEON. And many were the imitations, most widely read, and most boring, Ortifiez de Calahorra's ESPEJO DE PRINCIPES and Estevan</page><page sequence="7">472 HISPANIA Corbera's CABALLERO DEL FEBO. From the French were translations of the Carlovingian, Arthurian, and Graeco-Oriental cycles. First favorite among these was FLORES Y BLANCAFOR, and second the LIBRO DEL ESFOR- ZADO CAVALLERO CONDE DE PARTINUPLES, considered by Menen- dez y Pelayo one of the most rationally composed and ingenious narratives of this type. From the Provengal, PIERRES DE PROVENZA Y LA LINDA MAGALONA, said to have been polished by Petrarca in his youth. And trans- lations of Italian literature, such as the ORLANDO FURIOSO, were popular, too. Pastoral novels ranked next in popularity, although the "modest but steady sales of the CELESTINA and LAZARILLO testify to taste for more realistic fiction." The GUZMAN DE ALFARACHE was a "best-seller." Ballad- collections were also popular and many copies of the LUSIADAS and ARAUCANA were sold. Interest in the drama was slight, although there were sales of the works of Lope de Rueda, Juan de la Cueva, Aristophanes, and Seneca. And in 1605 the QUIJOTE was finding its way to Cuzco and Mexico in not too modest numbers. All of which would indicate that "as far as leisure reading is concerned, life must have been more pleasant and congenial in many parts of Spain's widely distributed colonies in America than in the nar- row fringe of English settlements along the North Atlantic coast. Indeed, the relative tolerance of Spanish authorities, both ecclesiastical and sectarian, toward creative literature of all kinds points to the conclusion that the shadows of ignorance in which the Spanish were reputed to have enveloped their Ameri- can possessions were not so thick nor, with due allowance for the spirit of the times, was their despotism so complete as has been pictured." Instruction in Modern Foreign Languages.-R. H. Eckelberry in the JOUR- NAL OF HIGHER EDUCATION, 14: 312-314, June, 1943, makes a report on language instruction in 449 colleges and universities, and finds that changes in undergraduate courses are slight. French, Spanish, German, Italian are still most widely offered, as in the twenty years following World War I. Ele- mentary French courses are offered in 443 of the 449 institutions, Spanish in 416, German in 398, Italian in 134. French majors were offered in 337, Spanish in 259, German in 220, Italian in 4. Since 1940 Spanish has advanced from third to second place. Elementary Portuguese was offered in 75 institutions, Russian in 51, Japanese in 22, Modern Greek in 15, Chinese in 14, Polish in 10. Percentage increases since 1940 were Japanese 340%, Portuguese 313%, Russian 218%, Chinese 180%, Modern Greek 50%, Polish 43%. Two or three schools offered majors, one offering majors in the culture of the Near East and Orient, with the neces- sary language instruction. From two to five institutions offer Modern Hebrew, Arabic, Czech, Swedish. Celtic, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, Hindustani, Icelandic, Mongolian, Punjab, Rumanian, Serbo-Croatian, Syrian, Tibetan, and Turkish are each offered in one. Graduate majors are offered in French in seventy schools; in Spanish in sixty-three; in German in fifty-nine; in Italian in fifteen; in Portuguese in two; in Japanese, Modern Greek, and Russian in one. Others offer courses with graduate credit in Arabic, Polish, Modern Hebrew, Czech, and Syrian.</page><page sequence="8">THE PERISCOPE 473 Intensive short courses in German are, offered in seventy-seven schools, in French in seventy-six, in Spanish in sixty-six, in Italian in twelve, in Russian in eleven; in Portuguese in eight, in Japanese in three, in Arabic and Modern Greek in two, in Chinese, Mongolian, and Punjab in one. French, Spanish and German increased in twenty-six, twenty-five, and twenty-four institutions, Russian in nine, Portuguese in six, and Italian in four. The war has stimulated English courses on the culture and institutions of foreign peoples, institutions offering courses on the Spanish-speaking peoples increasing from seventy-three to ninety-four since 1940, on the German- speaking peoples from sixty-three to seventy-three, on the French-speaking peoples from ninety-four to one hundred and three, on the Russian from three to nine, on the Chinese from four to seven, on the Italian from sixteen to eighteen, on the Japanese from five to six, on the Arabic from one to two. Most of these increased courses are on the elementary and practical level. "But if America is to play its proper role in the small, compact post-war world of the airplane and radio, it must develop its due quota of citizens who under- stand regions of the earth in a way that can come only from advanced study of their languages, literatures, and cultures ..." Do We Teach German Wellf-Klaus Helzheimer in the JOURNAL OF HIGHER EDUCATION, 14: 315-318, June, 1943, answers for a "German educated in Germany." And he says that he has found little language enthusiasm here, and language instruction on the whole poor. He wonders what will hap- pen as the situation becomes more threatening, and German studies decrease more than the 10% they have thus far decreased, and asks what can be done to make the students less dissatisfied. He finds that most American professors speak German badly, and that many Germans are unprepared to teach, especially modern German literature. He deplores the typical German reader with its IMMENSEE and other boring nineteenth-century stories that give the impression that modern German literature is inferior to American, and the omission from such texts of the best contemporary writers. English and American literatures are better repre- sented in German school-editions, he says. He also laments the emphasis on grammar and rule-learning, and the acquisition of a passive reading knowl- edge of the language. He believes that as a teacher the native German who "lives with" the lan- guage is usually to be preferred. As for the lukewarm patriots, "Let us try to enlighten them." There should also be humor, songs, visual aids, and the broadening of our conception of language teaching, with the introduction of something of German philosophy, music, literature, science, geography, history, education, government, and other aspects of German life. Foreign Language Requirements in One Hundred Colleges: 1942.-Juanita Gossman in SCHOOL AND SOCIETY, 58: 78-79, July 31, 1943. In 1937 50% of 156 colleges questioned required foreign-language credits for admis- sion; in 1942, 28%. Of the privately-controlled colleges 50% had the language requirement for admission, of the state-controlled only 13.3%. Nevertheless 84% of the colleges require language instruction for the A.B. degree, although 36.6% place it in the alternative list. Of the privately-</page><page sequence="9">474 HISPANIA controlled schools 92% require language credits for graduation, of the state- controlled 78%. A reading knowledge only of the language becomes a more popular require- ment, though 55% of the schools require the students to take specified courses. The questionnaire further revealed that only three to five per cent of those students beginning a foreign language in high school continue it in college, and that but six colleges offer placement tests. How Can Teaching the Mother-tongue Help Win the War?--Wm. D. Tem- pleman in EDUCATION, 64: 26-31, September, 1943, asks: "Who are the teachers of the mother-tongue? Every person-no matter what sort-is con- stantly teaching himself and others the use of the mother-tongue. All the people in this nation aid in making the standards for the use of English lower or higher. . . ." And he laments the "weaknesses in the English used by the college graduates" employed by industry, as well as their incapacity to think clearly. He quotes from Secretary Stimson: "In war as in peace, the ability to report facts and to express ideas clearly is an important attribute of the leader in every field of action. Teachers of English have a very real contribu- tion to make in developing and encouraging that ability." In the necessary utilitarian emphasis of the moment the writer reminds us of Noah D. Alper's "five fundamental qualities without which no speech can succeed. These are a lively sense of communication, physical vitality, enthusi- asm, poise, and earnestness. .. ." And, of course, accuracy. "By the use of practical content and of moral fervor, the teaching of English can help win the war. And should not the mother-tongue be taught the same way in time of peace, also ?" Linguistic Imperialism.-Albert Guerard in the NEW REPUBLIC, 109: 400, September 20, 1943, reviews I. A. Richards' BASIC ENGLISH AND ITS USES, finding it an excellent device "as an introduction to standard English." But in choosing a national language instead of a neutral one for an interna- tional language he feels that a great mistake has been made, ignoring the fact that Latin still is the international language of the Church, the importance of Esperanto and its growth in the past fifty years, and the scholarly work of the International Auxiliary Language Association. When Mr. Richards states that such a language must be "clear from any threat to the economic, moral, cultural, social, or political status of any person or people" the reviewer feels that he contradicts himself. "For the adoption of English as the supra-national language would imply the acknowledgment of Anglo-Saxon supremacy. The proof of this is that the arguments adduced by Mr. Richards are all based on our manifold superiorities: we are richer, more numerous, more civilized, more virtuous than the rest, and this is to be the Anglo-American century. "Of course, at the peace settlement, we can impose the recognition of this supremacy. We can make English the official world-language, with Basic as a modest practical approach. We can do it. It will be resented, as all other forms of tribal Anglo-Saxon pride are already resented. This arrogant in- sularity must go, if we are to know peace. "All dreams of 'imperialism' should be exorcised, including linguistic im-</page><page sequence="10">THE PERISCOPE 475 perialism, which sums up all the rest. The best policy would be to apply the method of Basic, not to English, but to the vast international vocabulary which already exists, and which is mostly Anglo-Latin. The result would be neutral enough, for although purely 'Western,' it would not be associated with any political power. It is on this basis that the International Auxiliary Language Association has been working for years. That is where Mr. Richards belongs, if he be truly a philosopher and a world-citizen, not a chauvinist in 'orthological' clothing." Hitler to Franco to Us.-Carey McWilliams in the NEW REPUBLIC, 109:- 203-204, August 9, 1943, reviews Allan Chase's FALANGE: THE AXIS SECRET ARMY IN THE AMERICAS. "Spain is the key to two continents" Goering said, as well as an important source of raw materials in the Nazi scheme of world conquest. But more important still is the fact that it is the "key to Latin America, for that matter, to such former outposts of Spanish rule as the Philippines. General Wilhelm von Faupel, the master-mind of Nazi intrigue in Spain, realized years ago that the real lever in Latin American affairs was not Pan Americanism, with such slogans as 'Latin America for the Latin Americans,' but rather Hispanidad, with the permanent and vigorous cry: 'i Arriba Espafia!' ... By their control of the puppet Franco regime, and of the Falange itself, the Nazis knew that their dictation could not be chal- lenged. This type of agitation, moreover, was well calculated to appeal to the landed Spanish aristocracy throughout Latin America, a group tied to Spain and Franco by strong economic connections, such as heavy investments in Spain and the export-import trade ...." We are told that the closing of Axis consulates in Latin America did not eliminate more than five per cent of Nazi espionage in Latin America, and that there are 14,763 agents of the Spanish Military Intelligence operating there today. "In Mexico City alone some thousand Gestapo-trained agents function out of eleven offices in the capital . . . They (the Nazis) lost no time, after 1936, in training thousands of Spaniards, and some Latin Americans, in special Gestapo schools in Spain and Germany. Since 1939 they have been transporting these agents, in Spanish vessels, to Latin America at the rate of about five hundred per month. ... ".. the Nazi handling of the so-called problem of Spanish 'neutrality' has, indeed, been their greatest diplomatic triumph of the war. . ... By delaying the termination of relations with Spain, we have prolonged the war, and the longer the war is prolonged the more precarious the situation becomes in Latin America. To such an extent is this true that the closing of all Spanish con- sulates in the Americas today would not, of itself, check espionage and sabotage. For in Mexico the Sinarquista movement, also Nazi-inspired, has a member- ship of around 500,000." Hispanidad.-Michael Kenney in the CATHOLIC WORLD, 157: 596-603, September, 1943, defines Hispanidad as a "spirit, a state of mind, the common heritage of language, tradition, culture, and way of life that came from Spain S. . and had come down through ages of heroic struggle for Catholic and Spanish liberty. It carries no implication of political alignment, but it does signify an intense attachment of our Latin neighbors to their Spanish back-</page><page sequence="11">476 HISPANIA ground and a feeling of neighborliness for one another that cannot be created by economic interests ... " There follows an outline showing how in Spanish history "Catholicity be- came the bond of national union, and Catholic and Spanish grew synonymous," and how in America Hispanidad has maintained its essential Catholic tradition in spite of "Masonic intriguers," as revealed by the resurgence everywhere of Hispanidad when "Franco raised the banner of Catholic Spain against a Communist and Bolshevist republic. .. ." He refers to a Spanish decree of September 20, 1942, which stated that the "educational traditions of Spain's Golden Age are to be restored in all universities and schools ... ," to obliga- tory catechetical instruction, Sunday rest, etc. And after commenting on some Spanish literary treasures he says: "It is all worth spreading, and our best practice of 'good neighborliness' would be to encourage Spanish culture in our neighbor lands and our own. . ... In this we can get and offer an object- lesson in Puerto Rico. Instead of eradicating its language by English replace- ment . . as some Congressional Committee members recently recommended, we should take measures to preserve it both as a home schooling-ground in our neighbor's tongue and outstanding proof of the sincerity of our neighborly benevolence. "A recent COLLIER'S article cited a Spanish American's comment, that friendship cannot be bought. Most of his educated Latin countrymen speak English fluently. We might buy even their friendship could we address them on their own cultural level in their own language. We should thus make an asset of Hispanidad."</page></plain_text>
