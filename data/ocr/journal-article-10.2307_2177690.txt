Kant-Studien, XIII, 4, pp. 357-408. Mankind has always drawn conclusions regarding the unknown from the basis of the known. Not until modern times, however, has logic seriously investigated the ground of validity of such reasoning. Bacon did not free himself from the traditional conceptualistic philosophy of scholasticism; Hume only cleared the way for the distinction between in- duction as a psychological fact in the associative processes and induction as a logical method; J. S. Mill attempted to justify induction on the basis of the axiom of the uniformity of nature, but was involved in circular reasoning, inasmuch as he derived this axiom by inductive procedure from the observed uniformity. No sum of facts can ever give us necessity. The method of induction consists in conceiving a single fact of experience as exemplifying a universal law, and its problem consists in discovering and so determining this law that all of the consequences which may be drawn therefrom will harmonize with the rest of experience. It thus establishes the premises from which the individual fact must follow. Sig- wart attempts to show that the universal reached by induction may be either numerical or general. The former, however, falls out of the sphere of logic, -in the case of absolute sameness there is no necessity for induc- tive reasoning. Besides, we can never know whether those things which appear the same are not in reality different. There is implicit in every induction a universalizing process. He is right, however, in maintaining that induction and deduction cannot be radically different, because every induction itself rests on a general presupposition. Erdmann's difficulties arise chiefly because he fails to recognize this relation. He maintains that 675</page><page sequence="2">676 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XVIII. induction is an expression of actuality which is not yet present, and, as it includes that which is not given but is uncertain, it cannot be assertorial but expresses mere expectation. To differentiate it from mere guesswork one must find, in the given facts, conditions which make logically neces- sary certain assertions regarding what is not given. This involves the pre- supposition that the same given causes bring about the same effects which, in turn, contains the assertions, (i) that the same causes will be given, and (2) that like causes produce like effects. The latter, manifestly the causal law, is rather inconsistently based by Erdmann on psychological necessity. Inasmuch as the presupposition itself cannot be deduced from the causal law, nor be grounded in the formal laws of thought, he thinks it must be derived from experience. But this makes the law of induction a product of itself, and merely states that we reason inductively because we reason inductively. Erdmann does not consider any problematic conclusion, drawn from a single given phenomenon, as inductive. In all cases of in- duction there must be numerous instances and, the greater the number, the more certain is the conclusion. But how can mere summation give rise to increased certainty ? Induction is concerned with the necessary connection of phenomena, with the interdependence within experience. Mere repetition has no value except, by reason of variation of method of an experiment, to control the conditions, to eliminate errors of observation, or to insure that there is not mere accidental succession but real connec- tion. The demand that one have a large number of instances merely postpones indefinitely the process of induction, and makes the task of de- tecting a uniformity of connections the more difficult as the number of specific instances to be dealt with are increased. Induction presupposes a universal and regular connection within experience. But on this de- pends also all possibility of valid thought concerning our world of expe- rience. Uniformity or conformity to law (Gesetzmdssigkeit) is a constitu- tive principle of reality. The conception that the various sciences con- sider reality from a definite abstract point of view in the light of certain ends has been most valuable for methodology. But the prejudice to which it has given rise against any universal method or principle is not without serious consequences for a theory of knowledge. Rickert insists that any constitutive principle must be taken account of in every scientific method. But there is no reason why we may not have a variety of scien- tific methods according to their various points of view, even if we accept ' Gesetzmdssigkeit' as constitutive. At first sight it might appear as if this would make a science of history impossible, since it deals only with single events. Because of this character of its subject matter Rickert regards his- tory as much more concrete than any of the natural sciences. However, history deals with values, and its elements are conceived only in reference to a unitary value of the whole. The historian singles out the facts which are of importance for him, but he must also show their connection in the whole series of events. In order to ascertain the facts there must be a</page><page sequence="3">No. 6.] SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES. 677 critical sifting of the material, just as in science there is required a careful analysis of phenomena by means of observation and experiment. In both cases analysis must precede synthesis. But, whereas science requires careful and detailed analysis of the conditions nearest in time and space, and a reduction of the most simple elements, history is concerned rather with the more remote causes. Thus the conception of causality varies in the different disciplines according to the intellectual interest which prevails or the character of the unit to be obtained. Unless ' Gesetzmdssigkeit' were a constitutive principle we could not have natural science or even nature, - neither would the knowledge of every separate individual fact have any value. With this principle induction as a logical method must stand or fall. But to ascertain the actual empirical causal laws we need a less general presupposition. An effect is never the result of a single cause but of sev- eral, which operate differently under different circumstances. Thus a seri- ous problem presents itself when we attempt to reason from effect to cause. ' If A is, B is,' does not necessarily mean, ' only if A is, is B.' This can only be asserted with a greater or less degree of probability ac- cording to (i) the scope of experience (since, in a series of special laws, we can the more positively conclude the cause from the result, the longer the series), and (2) the specialization of the effect (since the more complex or specialized the effect the more improbable that it will result from any other than the given known cause). Rickert rightly maintains against Hickson that causal connections are not quantitatively equivalent com- binations of changes. When a result follows from a certain cause and measurement is possible, we can only say that there are certain quantitative relations which must be determined by experimental methods. Causality means uniformity. EDW. L. SCHAUB. On Our Knowledge of Immediate Exz5erience. F. H. BRADLEY. Mind, No. 69, PP. 4o-64. The experienced will not all fall under the head of an object for a sub- ject. There is an immediate experience in which no distinction is made between my awareness and that of which it is aware. One of the questions which arises is: How can immediate experience itself become an object ? If it becomes an object it is transcended; and there is doubt as to how such transcendence is possible. Yet we seem to be certain that immediate experience is transcended, for we speak about it, it must therefore have become for us an object. But we are thus led to the dilemma that, so far as I know of immediate experience, it does not exist, and that, whether it exists or not, I could in neither case know of it. The solution of the difficulty, the writer anticipates, is in general supplied by considering the fact that immediate experience, however much transcended, remains and is active. It remains throughout as fundamental; it contains within itself every development which in a sense transcends it, and moreover, acts as</page><page sequence="4">678 THE PHILOSOPHICAL RETIEW. [VOL. XVIII. judge of these developments. The demand for an object which is com- plete is only satisfied by the idea of an object including immediate experience. After an analysis of the problems of Attention and Introspection, which shows that their puzzles are insoluble unless that which is felt, and which is not an object before me, is present and active, the author explains what is meant by immediate experience. It is that which is comprised wholly within a single state of undivided awareness or feeling. By feeling is meant an awareness which, though non-relational, may comprise in itself an indefinite amount of difference. At every moment my state is a whole of which I am immediately aware. Analysis of relations cannot exhaust my actual experience. Everything which is analyzed out implies the felt background; and the whole experience of both feeling and object is a non- relational, immediate, felt unity. Immediate experience, then, is the basis and the vital element of all analysis, while, and so far as, and however much, that analysis transcends immediacy. Thus in all experience we still have feeling which is not an object, and all that comes to us, however much distinguished and relational, is felt as comprised within a unity which itself is not relational. How immediate experience can even serve as a criterion of truth is ex- plained by the fact that the sense of disagreement or harmony which I feel in regard to an object tends to become a qualification of the object itself. The object is accepted or rejected because it expresses or fails to express the felt demand of immediate experience. How immediate experience is able to know itself and become for us an object, when ex hypothesis it essentially is no object, is outlined as follows: That such knowledge exists in fact seems to the writer incontestable. Immediate experience certainly cannot make an object of itself throughout, but we can set it before us in its main general character. Our actual object fails to satisfy us, is incom- plete; we attempt to complete it by relational addition from without and by relational distinction from within. The result in each case is defective, felt to be less than what we actually experience. Then we try the idea of a positive, non-distinguished, non-relational whole, which contains more than the object and in the end contains all that we experience. This appears to be the one ground on which satisfaction is possible. The writer concludes by suggesting the larger application of the idea of immediate experience as a higher form of unity which combines the two essential aspects of our world, involved in the fact that feeling, while it remains as a constant basis, nevertheless contains a world which in a sense goes beyond itself. EDITH H. MORRILL. Zum Begrift der kritischen Erkenntnislehre. RICHARD H6NIGSWALD. Kant-Studien, XIII, 4, pp. 409-456. This paper has special reference to Professor Goswin Uphues's Kant und seine Vorginger. The positive theoretical bearing of the critical</page><page sequence="5">No. 6.] SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES. 679 philosophy lies in the principle that the existence of the object of experience must underlie the general conditions of its knowledge,- a principle pre- cluding all relativism and ' psychologism.' The recognition of the prob- lem of experience as fundamental in the theory of the object characterizes the critical epistemology. A decided opponent of all psychologism, Uphues maintains that with the equation of the conceptions of an universal validity with that of a validity embracing experience, the limits between science and metaphysics must needs vanish. The objects of metaphysic are the presuppositions of all knowledge; all knowledge and science are thus surely grounded in metaphysic. Such a metaphysical epistemology, maintaining the metaphysical significance of all knowledge, is- evidently opposed to Kant and to philosophical criticism. There is no separation of sense-knowledge from knowledge of the understanding. Uphues argues for the objective validity of all judgment. With every judgment for which we claim any knowledge-value, we enter into the world of things in them- selves, of things existing independently of us, into a world of eternity. But how is this " eternal world " of truth to be connected with the temporal- psychic process which is the subject-matter of judgment ? Unless this is really possible, the metaphysical question, attaching to the subject-matter of judgment, as to the essence of truth, remains distinct from the epistemo- logical question, attaching to the judgmental form as to the universal validity of the judgment. Two possibilities follow from a definition of judgment which, like that of Uphues, seeks the grounds of its claim to the universal validity of the VorslellungsverknPfifung, advanced in the judg- ment, beyond the form of the latter. Either this universal validity is guaranteed through its relation to an essentially metaphysical factor; or else it is based upon the relation of the judgment to a somehow ' given' reality, of which judgment would then be a copy. A discussion of these possibilities shows that the claim of judgment to objective validity is based not upon the peculiar character of its content; rather is it a function of its form, an expression of the objective unity of apperception which constitutes the latter. Reality and universal validity are thus not the subject, but, in the strict epistemological sense, the predicate of the judgment. The copula is forms the concrete expression of this predicate. Uphues regards absolute space (and the case holds good for absolute time) as a conceptual law- principle, transforming sensations into intuitions. No mark of space can be derived from intuition, for the space first makes intuition possible. We are not here concerned with a concept of intuited space, but with space that is itself a concept. For Euclidean geometry, however, space is not a concept but an intuition. Demonstration, from its standpoint, is nothing else than construction. The Euclidean geometry is epistemologically characterized, not by the fact that its propositions are valid independently of the existence of the corresponding objects, but rather by the fact that the validity of geometrical propositions for objects is independent of the existence of the latter. The scientific conceivability of non-Euclidean</page><page sequence="6">68o THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XVIII. space proves Kant's point that the axioms of Euclidean geometry are not analytic; they have nothing to do with the problems of the critical epis- temology. Again, the actuality of Euclidean space, its ' Gegebenheit,' has far-reaching importance for epistemology; it guarantees the relative self-dependence of 'sensibility' over against 'understanding.' In this connection Kant's distinction between sensibility and understanding is dis- cussed. To return to Uphues's conceptual space and time: these do not arise from, and do not pass away with, the empirical consciousness. They are the system of conditions of the unity in which the form of consciousness consists. This consciousness in general, or transcendental apperception, which is beyond the reach of psychology, is the sum total of the formal conditions of the objects of experience. And these objects are not things- in-themselves, but the phenomena synthetized in the conceptual unity. The consciousness in general is not a thinking being, but the synthesis and connection inherent in the very conception of thought. Kant explains the identity of the self as the formal condition of my thoughts and their coherency. Uphues regards it as a persisting something which lies at the basis of our conscious processes. But the simple conclusion from the phenomenon to an essence manifesting itself in it is analytical, and proves nothing regarding the real existence of things-in-themselves. This latter depends not upon the mere conception of the phenomenon, but upon the proof of the validity of such a conception. The metaphysical interest of Criticism is concentrated on the methodic concept of " Gegebenheit." There is no science of the conditions of the ' given' as such; as Riehl says: " the Critique of Pure Reason affirms the metaphysical, but denies metaphysic." The specific problem of the critical epistemology is to establish the criterion of the truth of those propositions which are valid for the objects of experience not upon the basis of experience, which, i. e., are necessarily valid, but which none the less lay claim to validity not from mere conceptions. Truth can be predicated only of judgments, not of categories; for categories are materially not determined logical forms of judgments. The validity of the latter depends upon their application. For Kant the problem of metaphysic is the problem of science. To Uphues metaphysic is science, for science is ultimately metaphysic. R. A. TSANOFF. The Logical Foundations of Mathematics. R. B. HALDANE. Mind, No. 69, pp. I-39. The article begins with a criticism of the views of Bertrand Russell as presented in his book on the Princihles of Mathematics. Russell's work has two objects: (i) To prove that all pure mathematics deals exclusively with concepts definable in turns of a very small number of fundamental logical concepts ; (2) to explain these fundamental concepts. On the fundamental questions of philosophy, he accepts the following positions from G. E. Moore: (i) The non-existential nature of propositions. (2) A</page><page sequence="7">No. 6.] SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES. 68i pluralism which regards the world as composed of an infinite number of independent entities. In mathematics he adopts the new view of quantity introduced by Dedekind and Cantor. The objection of the writer is that the new method does not require such a foundation as Russell assigns to it in symbolic logic. The method is only the outcome of a general view of quantity insisted on by Idealists ever since Kant. His symbolic logic makes all pure mathemathics an absolutely deductive process. Pure mathematics is concerned with what, following Peano, he calls implications. The new method may be valuable both in logic and mathematics, but it has some awkward limitations. It must show how its deductions can ever carry us beyond its premises. Modern logic holds that the judgment always refers to reality. Russell rejects the existential view of judgment and the Aristotelian view of logical forms. Does his new method require such a logical basis as he gives it? The writer holds that pure mathematics is not a mere process of deduction from general principles. Even the barest process of counting is arrived at by abstraction from our consciousness of a succession in our acts of judgment. There is nothing in his method upon which modern logicians are not substantially agreed. Symbolic logic may be of real value to mathematics, but if its adaptation to mathematics necessitates a total departure from the form of the judgment and inference as we find them in experience, then the new system can hardly be more than a makeshift. Idealism asserts broadly that what we mean when, in everyday life, we speak of reality, depends upon distinctions which fall within knowledge and not without it. This principle separates Idealism from Russell's doc- trine. Unless Idealism is to be set aside we cannot assume lightly that a category such as quantity ought to be discussed after order or eliminated altogether. Russell's mathematical writings do not depend to any ma- terial extent on his philosophy. The work of the new school to which he belongs does not appear to rest on any particular philosophical principles, and its reasoning is wholly consistent with Kant's views as ordinarily in- terpreted. The mathematics of the school mark a real advance in scientific generalization. The method was originally devised to get rid of the standard of a spatial continuum by substituting the standard of an arithmetic con- tinuum. The revolution is purely mathematical. It is concerned with no particular theory of inference or of the relation of judgment to reality. The following views are comprised in the writer's interpretation of the doctrines of the school: The judgment of quantity is presupposed as the foundation of all mathematical method. In the judgment of quantity what is in point of quality like is judged as unlike, but only in respect of differ- ences which do not affect the quality. The category which makes this possible is no mere derivative from experience, or even from order or number, categories which themselves come later because they imply the predication of the quantitative character as the condition of any meaning being put into them. The simplest recognition of order in series, the barest act of counting, involves the judgment of an identity exhibited in</page><page sequence="8">682 TRE PHILOSOPPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XVIII. differences and affirmed of reality. When the elements of the series present themselves in the shape of distinct units within a continuous nature we have reached number. The concept of number thus defined is from its very nature both continuous and discrete, and every logical concept which depends upon quantity as its foundation has this double aspect. It is through the derivative categories of order and number, which bring into further determinateness the characteristics implicit in quantity, that we get to such fundamental concepts as order, series, unity, aggregate and correspondence. Abstraction only enables us to arrive at these from the study of experience because they are already presupposed in experience. As the concept of quantity elaborates itself into these and other complex forms, the principles which it embodies progressively give rise to qualitative differences, and the character of a mere sequence is replaced by a synthesis of differences in an individual system. This is the outcome of principles presupposed in all knowledge. They make possible the methods of the new mathematics in regard to limit and infinity. In judgments about reality lies the beginning of all knowledge, mathematical and otherwise. The source of the new arithmetic continuum must be sought for in experi- ence, from which it has been evolved by abstraction. Its origin is no mere deduction from exclusively logical principles. JOHN B. KENT. PSYCHOLOGY. La conscience affective. TH. RIBOT. Rev. Ph., XXXIV, 4, pp. 374-399. Instead of the three dimensions of the Wundtian theory of feeling, the author is inclined to believe in two dimensions, pleasantness-unpleasantness and excitement-depression. He further maintains that the latter dimension is the principal one and more stable, the former being somewhat super- ficial. The bases for this view are essentially biological and pathological. Sensibility and mobility are both invariably present in the primitive irrita- bility of living matter; and protoplasmic combinations show an equivalent of the act of choice by approaching assimilable and repelling non-assimi- lable matter. Irritability is the property of living matter to respond to excitations; and the state of apathy seems due to the failure of production or of transformation of the energy in an organism. To show affective independence, the author calls attention to the cases of insensibility to bodily pleasure and of the total loss of sensibility of higher order, such as joy, sadness, hatred, tenderness, etc. In such cases the individual affected is indifferent to all emotions, while intelligence is still intact. TAIZO NAKASHIMA. Time-relations of the Affective Processes. TAIZO NAKASHIMA. Psych. Rev., XVI, 5, pp. 303-339. The twofold problem of this investigation is the "I determination of the time necessary for the arousal of an affection," and the " dependence of</page><page sequence="9">No. 6.] SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES. 683 affective intensity upon the duration of stimulus." Herring's modification of Ludwig's kymograph was used in the first set of experiments, the appa- ratus being so arranged that thirty-two selected color combinations should pass in series across a small window. The series were arranged in ascend- ing and descending order. Judgments, given in seven steps from P to U, were made on the basis of affection aroused during the exposure of the stimulus. The results of eight observers revealed the fact that "1 affective intensity decreases with decrease of time of exposure," and also that " the shortest time necessary for an affection to arise varies from o. 84 to o.98 seconds. The above was then changed by substituting geometrical figures for the color combinations with substantially the same results, save that the shortest time necessary for an affection varied in this case from o. 72 to i.o8 seconds. The writer believes this method is preferable to that of the ordinary chronometric reaction, since it avoids mere impulsive response, which never corresponds to a real mental time. Since it also saves the need of an objective devise for registering reaction times, he concludes that the "I direct reaction method is feasible and reliable and has impor- tant advantages." In another set of experiments using the same method, a single stimulus was introduced instead of a serial presentation with a number of stimuli. Three parallel vertical screens were so arranged that a drop of the first revealed the primary stimulus on the second and a drop of the second revealed a second stimulus on the third screen, "designed to check or destroy the affective process possibly remaining as an after- effect of the first stimulus." The observations seem to indicate that affec- tion or feeling is identical in temporal definiteness with sensory experience, although the affective times are more or less longer than the cognitive reaction times. The experiment was further supplemented by a test with six simple color impressions used upon the Vernier chronoscope, model II, and the Wundt tachistoscope. The resulting tables show that the times of affective reaction are decidedly longer than those of cognitive reaction, and that the relative variability of affective reaction-times follows the same rule as that of the cognitive reaction-times. In a third division, the experi- menter seeks to determine whether or not in the field of affective reaction the times differ with the different sense departments. He continued the same study in the field of tones using the graphic method. The apparatus in the main consisted of a chronometric interrupter, a Stoelting kymograph and an ordinary piano. The results obtained were essentially the same as those previously noted. The general conclusions are: (i) " that affective judgments may be and usually are as direct and immediate as the sensory judgments of psycho-physics; (2) that the formation of an affective con- sciousness requires a longer time than that of a sensory consciousness; (3) that affective times and their variability are either absolutely or rela- tively of the same order as sensory times and their variability; (4) that the method of reaction, when applied to the affective processes, pleasantness and unpleasantness, has a like scope and validity as for sensory processes."</page><page sequence="10">684 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XVIII. The time relation of affective to sensory processes varies with the different sensory fields, being most immediate in the case of cutaneous impressions and most remote in color impressions. There are two possible ' a priori' opinions, i. e.: (i) that pleasantness and unpleasantness are the results of a sensation-complex or of an apperceptive combination; and (2) that lack of clearness is the principal criterion of affection. Of these the experi- ments seem to support the second. However the lack of clearness in affection may be only relative, not absolute, although this must be a matter of doubt for the present. The author believes to have shown " that affec- tion is different from sensation in its need of a longer time of arousal," but " akin to sensation in so far as affective judgments are direct and imme- diate, and affective times and their variability are of the same order as those of their sensory correlates."

Worship is addressed either to the things of nature or to spiritual beings. Some consider one the primitive form, some, the other. The question is, which extreme to adopt or how to combine the two. Tylor and Spencer have stated the position of animism. Their task is to show how the idea of the soul is formed, how the soul becomes the object of reverence, and how the worship of nature is derived. The savage dreams of visiting another tribe, but on awaking discovers his body still in its accustomed place. This suggests to him the idea of his dual nature which in turn he reads into his fellows. This ' double' has the power, under certain con- ditions, to quit the organism. He calls it his soul, but it is not yet an ob- ject of worship. Once separated from the body by death, it is looked upon as a good or evil divinity having the power to aid or plague men. Hence the primitive ancestor worship. For Tylor the worship of nature is due to a mental peculiarity of primitive man to interpret all phenomena in terms of his own animate nature. For Spencer it is due to a literal inter- pretation of metaphorical words. An ancestor who is called a ' tiger' finally becomes a real tiger to the mind of the savage. This theory is en- tirely inadequate to explain the facts and is being universally abandoned. Every tradition and all the personal relics left by the ancestor would be opposed to this confusion, to say nothing of the direct contradiction of the laws of generation. These theoreticians rightly considered the soul as an extremely complex product of history and mythology, but the notion is much more complex than the theory supposes. Why should not the sleeper have imagined that during sleep he was capable of seeing at a dis- tance ? How could he believe that he had experienced while asleep events which he knows to have transpired during the day? It is much more natural that he should see in the images a renewal of the experiences of the day although with a different intensity. Why need he consider all his</page><page sequence="11">No. 6.] SLbMMARIES OF ARTICLES. 685 sensations objective? Intellectual laziness is necessarily at its height in the savage. Of the two experiences, the daily and nightly, the first is all important. Is it not strange that the second should have captivated his attention and formed a basis for such a complicated system of ideas ? This objection is the more weighty, if it is true that men least civilized dream least. Furthermore, he doubtless considers a majority of his dreams as simple illusions. The hypothesis of the ' double' may have been applied to the phenomena of dreams without being derived therefrom. Considering the wide separation of the sacred from the profane it is strange that the soul becomes an object of worship by a simple detachment from the body. The separation might reinforce its sacred character if the soul already pos- sessed one but it could not change the profane into the sacred. Moreover, ancestral worship is a comparatively late development. If the idea of God was not derived from the idea of soul, might it not have been just the re- verse? If the Gods were really constructed in the image of the human soul they should bear the marks of their origin, but this is not the case. Anthropomorphism is a relatively advanced idea and the original sacred beings are always in animal or vegetable form. Shall we admit that relig- ious beliefs are mere hallucinatory representations ? Under this concep- tion the term 'science of religion' cannot be employed without impro- priety. What sort of a science would it be whose principal discovery con- sists in denying the object of its research ? Naturism is concerned in pointing out a remarkable similarity between the various mythologies. The names referring to the Deity generally designate the principal phenomena of nature. The immense unknown set over against the known gives the first impulse to religion. According to Max Muller, (I) the roots of cognate words express types of extreme generality, (2) they are types of action. On this account they may be applied easily to all sorts of things. The notion of the soul is invented to explain the word. This doctrine rests upon a certain number of linguistic postulates which have been and are disputed. One contests the cobrdi- nances, another the interpretation and a third asks whether the co6rdinances are as ancient as Muller supposes. He assigns to religion a point of de- parture in the real but leaves it immediately. He tries to distinguish mythology from religion by placing the former outside the latter, but such a distinction is purely arbitrary. If we extract the myth from religion, we must also abandon the rite, which is only the expression of the myth. Surprise and wonder are emotions of a relatively advanced civilization. The primitive does not believe that the cosmic forces are superior to his own; and religion itself gives him this assurance. If it confers a certain power over nature it certainly does not have its source in a feeling of impotence. Moreover, if things of nature became divine because of their imposing form or power, how does it happen that the first beings to be worshipped are humble vegetables and animals ? Each system attempts to construct the notion of the divine from the sensations which certain</page><page sequence="12">686 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XVIII. phenomena awake within us, They suppose a veritable creation 'ex nihilo.' The man as he appears to himself in his dreams is still only man. Natural forces which the senses perceive are only natural forces whatever be their intensity. Each substitutes pure phantasmagoria for reality, which forces the conclusion that beyond naturism and animism there is a worship more fundamental and primitive of which they are only the derived forms or particular aspects. HARVEY G. TOWNSEND. L'ana/ogie scientziFqe. J. SAGERET. Rev. Ph., XXXIV, I, PP. 4I-54. One of the principal operations of the human mind is the act of compari- son. Now comparison will be made either from the quantitative or the quali- tative standpoint. In the first case, it leads to measure; in the second, to analogy. Analogy consists in recognizing general characteristics. Adjec- tives were introduced into languages by this operation of analogy. It can- not be denied that the use of adjectives presupposes an implicit unification among a large number of objects. The fact of having recognized among many bodies an analogy, contained in itself the germ of Galileo's experi- ments. Every generalization implies analogy. There can be no scientific fact without generalization. Scientific fact has, however, a variable value that is measured by the number or the extent of analogies co-existing with it. Thus the fact of falling of liquids and solid bodies was already a scientific fact. In eliminating the resistance of the air, Galileo made this fact more scientific, since the analogy was carried over, not only to the falling, but to the rapidity of falling. A new advance was thus rendered possible, an advance made by Newton when he extended the analogy from the terres- trial to the celestial domain. But that is not all: Galileo's experiments helped to develop dynamics. From thence, all mechanical phenomena came under an analogy which included hitherto only the phenomena of gravitation. Thus the progress of science in its synthetic way is blended with the extension of the domain of analogy, whereas its analytical progress consists in increasing approximation (laws are always approximate). It is principally a matter of measure, of experimental technique, where the end pursued is the establishment of a quantitative relation. In short, the con- quests of science are the conquests of analogy. Scientific certitude depends upon the weight of analogies. It varies from heavyweight, certainty, to lightweight, hypothesis. The author preferred the term analogy to the term 'resemblance' or ' similitude,' because the first is more accurately applied to morphological order, and the record would seem to limit science to grouping things and phenomena which are strictly alike.

The various systems of ethics may be classed under one of two groups: the metaphysical-rational, whose method is speculative, or the psychological- genetic, which proceeds empirically. Both are legitimate and necessary for a complete solution of ethical problems,- either goes wrong when it under- takes to cover the entire field. The former, of which Kant is typical, in- vestigates the true essence of morality and seeks a positive a f5riori criterion of moral action. The latter proceeds by psychological analysis to deter- mine the relation of the feeling of obligation to the simpler mental processes, to trace its genetic development from primary instincts and impulses, and to view the evolution of morality from the standpoint of history. The systems of J. S. Mill and Herbert Spencer belong to this second group. Mill's system is inconsistent in introducing qualitative distinctions of pleas- ures. Finding external sanctions insufficient to explain the fact of con- science, he is compelled to have recourse to internal sanctions, which really are inborn feelings of obligation. Thus utility is only a secondary criterion. Spencer departs from utilitarianism in making the preservation of life the criterion of good and bad acts, and in assuming that differentiation and heterogeneity represent the 'higher,' and not merely the later stages of life. He points out Mill's failure to derive moral obligation, and insists that this can be done only by passing beyond morality to conduct 'as exhibited by all living creatures,' and by treating ethical action as part of action in general. He elaborates a physical, a biological, a psychological, and a sociological view. The two former, although offering interesting analogies, are abstract and fanciful and fail to throw any light on ethical problems. The psychological view shows how our moral sentiments have come to be what they are but does not explain the unique character of the 'ought.' It presupposes an agent who wills and merely describes the course of development by which certain will acts, which are in harmony with the environment, are accompanied by feelings of pleasure and pain. The sociological view represents morality as the result of cooperation which is brought about by the utility arising from a differentiation of activity or division of labor. But this is not possible without a confidence which already implies morality. Mill says, " a test of right and wrong must be the means, one would think, of ascertaining what is right or wrong, and not a consequence of having already ascertained it." In another passage he points out that the principle of Utility " is a mere form of words without rational signification, unless one person's happiness . . . is counted for exactly as much as another's." The system is based on ' intuitionalistic utility.' Spencer insists that we cannot calculate pleasures and that they lead to contradictions if made the principle of action, so that happiness cannot be made the direct end of action. What that principle should be,</page><page sequence="14">688 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XVIII. he is unable to say. He can merely point out the ultimate goal and the general line of conduct leading thereto. Real morality is possible only in a society of perfect people. Thus the system has no practical value, in failing to establish any criteria of action. The method is deductive; the basis is ' metaphysical utility.' Both Mill and Spencer have failed inas- much as they have attempted more than is possible by the method used. This can be fruitful only when it assumes the essence of morality as grounded in the will, in the rational self-determination to action based on con- cepts. Moral obligation rests on ultimate purposes, on will acts. Every- thing which contradicts personality, which, by limiting or negating the self, reduces the consciousness of worth, which is the result of blind impulse and so not in accord with one's true will, is immoral.

Although, with the writings of Kant, philosophical thought was diverted to epistemology, yet at bottom the interests and implications remained metaphysical. The nineteenth century has, however, witnessed a radical change. Ethical problems have come to the forefront. Philosophy has become concerned with concrete life, with purposes and values, and with the realization of ideals in the here and now. It is this alone which, at the present time, can justify its place among the sciences and disciplines, - a 'Wissenschaft' which is at the same time a 'Willenschaft.' This may be regarded as meaning the final expulsion of metaphysics from philosophical thought, or as representing metaphysics at its most com- plete development, inasmuch as it involves an ultimate attitude toward reality. The older a nation and its culture, the more is it characterized by serious work, by industry and order, the more its activity is directed by the principle of the greatest results with the least expenditure of energy. The same holds true of philosophy. Myths and imaginative symbolic interpre- tations of the world order represent its infancy; the age of metaphysical prob- lems is a necessary step in development, and only gradually are all of these, which can be dispensed with, sifted out, not because they are solved but because they are declared irrelevant or naive and meaningless questions. As little as the speculations of the subtle scholastics interest us, will those of the present age interest future generations. It is encouraging that we ourselves are beginning to lay them aside, and are seeking a psychological interpretation of the fact of their existence, rather than a solution of the transcendent questions of religion and philosophy. Although it may signal the decline or death of philosophy, yet the prevailing interest in ethical problems is but the natural course of development and represents the ripest fruits of human thought. As a biological necessity, it should not be lamented but calmly accepted. If philosophy wishes to maintain itself in the future, it must become ' Aktivismus,' a philosophy of action. This does</page><page sequence="15">No. 6.] SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES. 689 not imply the adoption of the superficial principles of pragmatism which base truth on beneficent results or cash value. Nor does it mean an alliance with positivism, which, though limiting the problems and the sphere of knowledge to the so-called real world, yet has a dogma and an epistemology of its own. I Aktivismus ' is not concerned with a theory of knowledge nor does it limit itself to any single sphere of reality. It has reference only to ultimate values, and endeavors to focus all philosophical thought on will acts which furnish the immanent teleological principles of the various special disciplines. The fundamental demand of ethics is that we make the most of present opportunities and not neglect present needs for future possibilities. Duty commands that we make our life one of service, and actualize in ourselves and others the highest ideals. Too much energy is wasted in striving for impossible ideals and in speculating on useless, irrelevant problems. Philosophy is an interpretation of life based on a reflection on its actual, concrete experiences. It is the expres- sion of the deepest needs and conflicts of the human mind, the desire to give life meaning and value, and the attempt to solve its essential and ultimate problems. Too often it is made a mere mental discipline, a matter of theoretical speculation involving the same I contemplative' atti- tude as the mathematical sciences. A healthy reaction from such a tendency is found in Fichte, Schopenhauer, Feuerbach, Stirner, and Nietzsche. EDW. L. SCHAUB.</page></plain_text>
