The diagnosis of child abuse has social implications, it is the subject of crimi nal and civil actions, and it threatens the integrity of families. The diagnosis of child abuse is often made on the basis of the presence of injuries and the absence of a compatible history given by caregivers. Law and science are based on different core assump tions of how truth is established. The law frames ques tions in adversarial terms and uses argument, logic, and construction of a narrative to prove the point. Science, in contrast, depends on observation, testing, and use of accumulated evidence from many sources.' Scientific knowledge is established by aggregation and confirmation of studies, and the value of evidence depends on the methodology of the study. The systematic review of fractures in child abuse by Kemp and colleagues is a rigorous attempt to draw meaningful conclusions from a diverse and hetero geneous literature.2 This study follows on from the Welsh study group's previous reviews of medical stud ies on child abuse, which used similar methods on the topics of oral injuries, scald burns, human bites, and bruises. The probability estimates of abuse by the fracture site are broad, as is clear from forest plots generated in this study. The review's clearest message is that the site or type of fracture can never in itself distinguish between abuse and accident. The child's age is important-a fracture of the humerus should obviously be viewed differently in a 2 month old child than in a 15 year old football player. The question is how the injury occurred, and this requires evaluation of the history provided by the caregivers. Abuse must be seriously considered in a young child with a serious injury if no history that correlates with the injury is given or if caregiver's history differs from one telling to another. The medical assessment requires a meticulously obtained history of the event directly from those who were present during the injury event and immediately afterwards, a detailed physical examination, a radio logical survey to look for other injuries, and a history from other observers. The reasonable medical suspi cion of abuse should direct the clinician to enlist the investigative expertise of non-medical professionals. So how is the diagnosis of abuse determined? In Kemp and colleagues' study the highest rankings were given to studies where abuse was admitted by the per petrator or where it was confirmed at case conference; by family, civil, or criminal court proceedings; or by stated criteria, including multidisciplinary assessment. In practice, a multidisciplinary assessment may range from a case conference meeting in which social serv ice professionals and doctors discuss a case, to a full scale investigation including police interviews of sus pects and witnesses, scene investigation, and crime laboratory analysis. Retrospective observational studies included in this meta-analysis are one of several scientific methods that have been used. Experimental studies to deter mine exactly what quantum and direction of force is needed to cause a given fracture would be most useful. One such study of rib fractures in cadaveric rabbit models looked at the lever mechanisms needed to fracture the posterior ribs,3 and it found that this precise fracture location and type is seen in fatally injured infants. This study has enabled clinicians to state with confidence that squeezing and bending an infant's chest is the most likely mechanism for posterior rib fractures seen in child abuse. Biomechanical studies have the potential to provide 826 BMJ Ill1 OCTOBER 2008 1 VOLUME 337</page><page sequence="2">I S* A Fractured shoulder in a 3 year old boy due to physical abuse 0 0 0 z answers to the question of mechanism of injury and quantification of force. Anthropomorphic human sur rogates (test dummies) and computer modelling are used to explore the forces, direction, and mechanism of injury in child abuse. Limitations include lack of data regarding injury thresholds for infants and chil dren and difficulty in developing models that replicate the unique properties of paediatric tissue.4 One study used an injury plausibility model to integrate known biomechanical factors with history and clinical features in cases of femur fracture in infants and toddlers who are reported to have fallen down the stairs.5 However, biomechanical analysis is still in development and cur rently does not provide enough information to deter mine the causes of infant and child injuries accurately. Even a single well documented case study of injury can add greatly to our knowledge of mechanisms of injury-for example, a videotape recording of an infant who sustained a spiral humerus fracture when an older sibling rolled her over.6 The infant's arm was caught behind her back and was twisted and fractured in this accidental manner. Retrospective case reviews, autopsy studies, animal experiments, meta-analyses, biomechanical modelling, case based biomechanical analyses, and case reports continue to advance the medical knowledge of child injury. Most importantly, prospective multicentre observational studies of fractures in infants and tod dlers would be useful. These studies need to use clearly defined age categories; uniformly applied diagnostic procedures, such as skeletal surveys; and a priori diag nostic criteria for abuse and non-abuse. They must also be willing to accept indeterminate diagnoses. The cost of such studies is considerable, but the societal cost of not doing them is even greater. 1 Angell M.
