My specific intention is to show how the metaphors of the "machine", the "body" and the "invisible hand", in diverse ways, provided models with which to represent a social and economic order which was the unin tended outcome of human actions. Moreover, reciprocal comparison reveals the limitations on their use, and the reasons why the "invisible hand" was more successful than the other two metaphors in conveying the concept of the com petitive market. 1. Metaphor in Smith's Economic Thought1 The purpose of this essay is to analyse how the metaphors of the "machine", the "body", and the "invisible hand" are used in Smith's theory to shed light on the phenomenon of social and economic order. If on the one hand there is no doubt that Smith developed an economic concept of equilibrium (largely characterised by the 1. The quotations from Smith's works are from the Glasgow Edition.

The latter type of language did not conflict with the former (as evidence one may cite the image of the "gravitation" of prices), but it was used to work out concepts not yet covered by the lexicon of infant "Economic Science". An approach which endeavours to interpret the role of metaphor in the formation of scientific thought - and here specifi cally in Smithian economics - employs as its partial terms of refer ence elements from long-standing debate within the philosophy of science; debate that began with Black's "interaction view" of the metaphor3 and culminated, at the end of the 1970s, in Boyd's "theory-constitutive metaphors". According to Boyd, metaphors assume a fundamental role in the formation of scientific theory in cases where they are used "to 2. On the possible references to "order" qualified by the terms "natural", "economic", "spontaneous" etc. see. Morrow (1969); Viner (1966), pp. 116-55; Hayek (1973-79). 3. According to Black, a metaphor does not merely "compare" two diffe rent logical ambits; if it did, it could be substituted by an explicit assertion. Instead, the metaphor is "interactive" because it transfers its own implications to the subject of the primary system: in brief, the latter is seen through metaphoric speech, which changes the original literal description. Therefore metaphoric in teraction enables understanding of new links in reality, bearing a new meaning which is not interpretable through common speech. Similarly the secondary sys tem undergoes significant changes through the association of ideas derived from the assimilation of the primary system; Black (1962). Other important refer ences in this vast literature are: Blumenberg (1960); Hesse (19662); Ricoeur (1975); Perelman (1977-82), pp. 523-34; Ortony (19802); Rorty (1989); Prê ta (1992). A very different point of view is, of course, expressed by the neo positivist school, see, e.g., Hempel (1965), chap. 12, § 6, pp. 433-447. On the influence of the metaphor on the economic theory McCloskey (1985) and (1994); Hodgson (1993), pp. 18-36; and with a different perspective from that of the present analysis, Mirowski (1989). A further example, from a historical pers pective, of a possible relationship between metaphors and the formation of eco nomic theory is in Clark (1992), especially pp. 9-13. For a study of the role played by analogies, homologies, and metaphors in the interaction between natu ral science and political economy, Cohen (1993).</page><page sequence="3">177 introduce theoretical terminology where none previously existed"4: in other words where there were no explanatory cate gories available to describe the links among the phenomena of the external world. This implies that metaphors "constitutive of theory" cannot be paraphrased. They therefore permit "nondefi nitional reference fixing", on the basis of which, by means of ex ploration of the similarities and analogies between an already known subject and one not yet completely understood, scientific research plots its course. Analogy allows situations to be brought to mind which illustrate phenomena whose essential properties are unknown; this is where the "ostensive" character of the metaphor5 lies. Even though metaphors do not possess the charac teristics of definitional language, they can be used to fix "refer ences". They thus become a useful device with which to demons trate explanatory hypotheses. In what follows I shall endeavour to show that certain figures of speech have helped to establish certain paradigms of economic science because they have played an essential role in theory formation6. The general thesis sustained is that the metaphors of the "machine", the "body" and the "invisible hand" helped, in diffe rent ways, to frame what was a central problem for both Smith and his contemporary social sciences because they had still not been given complete theoretical resolution: the constitution of an orderly unprogrammed structure of society which is also the out come of the decisions and actions of individuals. Although this order had not been given explicit and thorough conceptualization, it nevertheless guided research in the social sciences. The Smith's 4. Boyd (19802), p. 357. 5. Boyd (19802), pp. 358-9 and pp. 366-7. Compared with Boyd's realism, which uses metaphors as a transitional stage in the construction of scientific theory, very suggestive appears the observation made by T.S. Kuhn that «metaphor reminds us that another language might have located different joints, cut up the world in another way» (Kuhn, 19802, p. 414). 6. V. Brown suggests a different approach, according to which in Smith's work "the use of metaphor is criticised using metaphor" (V. Brown, 1994, p. 14).</page><page sequence="4">178 metaphors, even though they did not appear in any regular sequ ence, met this growing exigency. In the (hypothetical) passage from one to the next new elements were introduced to enable understanding of economic and social phenomena. In a theoretical setting which conceived order as an unintended outcome, the model of the machine (or more precisely the model of the princi ples of the modification of machines) emphasised two important features: the necessary coherence between the functions of the parts and the economic principle whereby machines tend to be improved in order to make their interconnecting functions7 more efficient. The biological model introduced a new dynamic ele ment. The animal body not only develops, but because of "un known principles" lives and prospers in the most adverse of con ditions. In the seventeenth-century scheme of things, by contrast, machines did not possess the potential for endogenous change and self-regulation. The organic model thus provided a more suitable framework for enquiry into social dynamics while preserving the hypothesis of equilibrium. The "invisible hand", moreover, fo cused enquiry directly on the specificities of a modern market society. In the two previous models the functional relations be tween parts and whole entailed an unyielding fixity: every single part (whether a cog-wheel or an organ) was rigorously bound to its function, and any modification would have disrupted its har mony. The point of departure of the analogical inferences was the coherence of the whole (body or machine) from which derived the role of every single cog-wheel or component. The harmony of the whole was the datum on which the connections of the complex system were reconstructed. Smith's description of market society in The Wealth of Nations is somewhat at odds with this supposi tion. Since the individual is the basis of the social system, free to organise his own work and his own capital, he cannot be identi fied with either a cog-wheel or a physical organ, whose function is fixed once and for all. The equilibrium of the social whole was to 7. On Smith's use of the metaphor of the machine as an explanatory model, see Cremaschi (1984), pp. 187-9.</page><page sequence="5">179 be conceived in entirely opposite terms to those outlined above8 : it was necessary to begin with the freedom of individual move ment in order to reconstruct the interconnections that produced a state of order within the system9. If this can be assumed to be the beginning of a science of society which laid the basis for its intellectual autonomy, it also created further problems that justified the persistence of metaphoric language. The first problem was how individual plans could be co-ordinated and made compatible. A constant theme in Smith's oeuvre is that the social assimilation and accommodation of individual choices does not simply result from the activation of self-interest. This latter instead assumes the form of moderate self love, to be controlled and rendered compatible with social exigencies10. Furthermore, it is not sufficient to ensure, on a his torical level, the achievement of an optimal order; on the contrary, Smith's reconstruction of the course of history demonstrates the persistence of sub-optimal equilibria which, at times, derived from a reversal in the path followed by individuals or groups if they operated in a perfectly self-interested manner. In other words, the self-regulation of the market was a problem far from resolved by pure theory. Smith's metaphor of the machine, in The History of Astro nomy, and Considerations concerning the First Formation of Lan 8. Very different E. Rothschild's interpretation, according to which "Smith's attitude to the invisible hand was ironical on each of the three occa sions" in which it appears (Rothschild, 1994, p. 319). 9. Of the three metaphors quoted, only that of the "invisible hand" is en tirely original. In my view, it underlines the fact that Smith's social theory was induced to look for new explanatory metaphoric models when previous ones, even though used innovatively in respect to the traditions of the 17th and 18th centuries, displayed aporia. Note also that biological models, unlike mechanical physics, influenced those of political economy, even though they were epistemologically incomplete, and this, I believe, was due to their ability to conjugate the notions of equilib rium and change. On the formation of the scientific constitution of biology, see Jacob (1970); Montalenti (1962); E. Mayr (1982); Bernardi (1988). 10. See Young (1986), pp. 365-82; Pesciarelli (1988); Zanini (1990), pp. 29-47; evensky (1992), pp. 61-77.</page><page sequence="6">180 guages, is notably the application of a Newtonian model in order to illustrate both the succession of scientific systems and the pro cess of linguistic change. As will be explained below, the simplification-reduction of the cog-wheels of the machine-theory and of the machine-language come about through the discovery of "connecting principles" which more effectively link together parts of the system and features discordant in past models. One im mediately notes the close connection between the concept of grav ity and the role played by the "principles", both in machines and in the system of wealth (consider again the example of natural prices) in providing one single explanation for manifold phe nomena, also economic. In brief, as others have argued, there seems to be a substantial similarity between the "machine" and the "invisible hand"11, in that both of them represents an articulation, on different theoretical levels, of the same Newtonian model of order12. The problem to be addressed, I believe, is the function per formed by the "machine" and the "invisible hand" as metaphors. If on the one hand their shared Newtonian matrix is undeniable, on the other the figures of speech do not coincide. They furnish information which sets up different logical implications, above all the reversal (which may be verified by comparing one against the other) of the relationship between the parts and the whole in the conception of market order (and of social order) mentioned earlier13. 11. See Cremaschi (1984), chaps. 1 and 3 and in particular, p. 129 and p. 136. This problem generated wide debate (which cannot be analysed here) on the influence of Newton's "mechanistic analogy" on Smith's work. For some writers there are strong similarities, not only generically methodological ones, between the structure of Smith's Wealth and Newton's Principia. See Worland (1976), pp. 245-257; Hetherington (1983), pp. 497-505. 12. The formation of prices is determined by the operation of the "invisible hand". The movement of capital and work, caused by individual pursuit of self interest, towards higher remuneration, is engendered by a change in supply and therefore in market prices. 13. In this sense it seems to me that the "functionalism" of Smith's theory mentioned by T.D. Campbell is better specified (Campbell, 1971, p. 74).</page><page sequence="7">181 This point of view led to the final elimination, described by Mayr, of the seventeenth-century hierarchical and authoritarian concept of social equilibrium represented by the metaphor of the clock from the liberal theories of the 18th century, the task of which was to reconcile order and liberty. This relation reached a certain maturity in Smith's "invisible hand"; an image whereby individual liberty gives origin to an order and an equilibrium that cannot be pre-established but must be continually obtained and renewed14. It is thus that a metaphorical reading, without undervaluing the considerable light already shed by the critical literature on Smith's thought, can provide a useful key to understanding why it came to constitute such an enduring concept of equilibrium of market and society. 2. Metaphors and analogies in rhetorical speech and forms of knowledge It is in Smith's theory of communication, which seeks to re cover rhetoric in various types of discourse, that explicit analysis is conducted of the role of metaphor15. Smith denies that figures perform the merely decorative function attributed to them by the classical tradition. The "beauty" of speech is given by com munication, "by sympathy", by the sentiments and emotions of the orator, by clarity of language16. Therefore, according to Smith, the "figurae verborum" and the "figurae sententiarium" give no beauty of their own, they only are agreable and beautifull when they suit the sentiment and express in the neatest manner the way 14. According to Mayr the "invisible hand" meets these requirements be cause it corresponds to a system of automatic adjustment. O. Mayr (1986). This view is also taken by Hayek (1978), pp. 179-90. Brief discussion is provided also by Campbell (1971), p. 76, who argues that the metaphor of the clock can be extended even to the "invisible hand" (see p. 61). 15. See Howell (1975), pp. 11-43; Bevilacqua (1968), pp. 559-68; En dres (1991), pp. 76-95. 16. LRBL, p. 25.</page><page sequence="8">182 in which the speaker is affected. When the common form of speech well enough describes the thing we want to make known or sufficiently com municates our sentiments, yet perhaps it does not express clearly and with sufficient life the manner we ourselves regard it. If in this case the figura tive way of speaking is more suited to our purpose, then surely it ought to be used preferably to the other17. Although rhetorical speech is subordinate to non metaphorical speech, it is nevertheless able to express something over and above plain language. In short, figurative speech fills a gap left by the "common form of speech" which would otherwise be insufficiently incisive18. Furthermore, for Smith the legitimacy of metaphorical speech rests on a theoretically sound foundation. The com munication of passions, in fact, comes about "by sympathy"; an expression which implies that forms of communication reflect the ethical relationships described in The Theory of Moral Sentiments. In that text, "sympathy" mediates among individuals and enables harmony of sentiments to be established between the subject who feels the emotion and the observer who "by sympathy" identifies himself with his situation. One cannot live the experience of another, but one can represent it by translating it into ones own experienced terms. As we have no immediate experience of what other men feel, we can form no idea of the manner in which they are affected, but by conceiving what we ourselves should feel in the like situation19. It is therefore necessary to produce mental analogies of situa tion in order that a moral relationship may be established; that is to say, until a communication of sentiments has been created. And this is evidently also the case of language. 17. LRBL, p. 33. My italics. 18. On the contrary, many scholars have stressed the marginal role of fi gures of speech, see Bryce (1992), p. 8; S. Skinner (1994), p. 9; V. Brown (1994), p. 10. 19. TMS, p. 9. My italics. On these aspects Lindgren (1973), pp. 21-23.</page><page sequence="9">183 The creation of analogies thus becomes the condition for the communication of individual experience that would otherwise be inaccessible. Discourse becomes communicative when it is able to arouse analogies in the listeners imagination which exert an emo tional impact. These observations help to explain why metaphor ical speech consisting of analogies and figures of speech came to perform such a central function in Smith's theory. Smith assigned an even more important role to analogies in the process of know ledge formation, and especially when examining the relationship between speech and cognitive processes, in his essay Considera tions concerning the First Formation of Languages (1761). Here Smith traces the constitution of languages by theoreti cally reconstructing the sequence in which different parts of speech were formed. This process, he argued, moved from the concrete to the abstract and from the specific to the general. The name originally given to a particular object was extended by "resemblance" to a whole range of objects with the same prop erties, thus becoming a common name. The formation of other parts of speech, such as the adjective and the preposition, which requires a more complex process of mental abstraction, also relied on "resemblances and dissimilitudes", since from each of these derived both the qualities of concrete objects and their spatial rela tions. Hence, for Smith, language tended towards progressive generalisation; a process which therefore organized the world through the "different mental operations, of arrangement or clas sing, of comparison, and of abstraction"20; and the increasingly more general abstractions by which we take possession of every thing around us are founded themselves on the cognitive instru ment of analogy-making. Analogies, in fact, enable the of com mon properties of a multitude of objects to be abstracted from their material reality. Smith has already discussed the fundamental role of analogy in his essay The History of Astronomy. The aim of philosophy is to overcome the "wonder" (provoked when an object eludes known classifications, or when it presents itself as an unusual sue 20. Consider., p. 207.</page><page sequence="10">184 cession of objects21) which prevents the imagination from moving with ease in the orderly continuity of things. However, one may argue that, in both cases, the discontinuity which disorients the "imagination" stems from the weakness of the analogical structure of reference. The first type of wonder arises, in fact, from the inadequacy of classifications based on similarities, particularly those of the animal and vegetable species. The second type of wonder is overcome when a new "connecting principle" is found among phenomena which re-establishes an order of things and restores the succession of phenomena interrupted by the appear ance (or by the simple observation) of an anomaly22. In The His tory of Astronomy the theory of universal gravitation is presented as the highest example of "connecting principle" because of its capacity to unify astral physics and terrestrial physics. In this case, too, a common property is extrapolated from phenomenologically diverse objects, and in specific cases is translated mathematically into the laws of physics. The conception of the abstraction of science is therefore bound to the role played by analogy in the formation of scientific knowledge. Although analogy cannot be identified with metaphor, it is clear that the dividing line between the two becom es increasingly subtle the more one asserts that a "principle" valid "in one instance" is binding "in all similar cases", regardless of the region of its application23. It is therefore within this theoretical framework and internal ly to debate on these themes among the Scottish intellectuals of the late 1700s24, that one understands how metaphors provided 21. EPS, pp. 37-41. 22. EPS, pp. 53-105. 23. On this see Hume (1964d), chap. 5. 24. In Hume the cognitive function of analogy is handled in relation to the concepts of "cause", "custom and habit". In particular, see Hume (1964d), pp. 20-47 and 86-8; Hume (1964a), pp. 388-406 and 469-71. Also significant is Kames' thesis that "Analogy is one of the most common sources of reasoning" (Kames, 1751, p. 305) and of J. Millar, for whom analogy is necessary for the growth of technical and scientific knowledge, because it generates a "chain of reasoning" which gives rise to "new inventions and discoveries" (Millar, 1803,</page><page sequence="11">185 Smith with the means to represent the market order of modern society. 3. The metaphor of the machine In The History of Astronomy, Smith represented scientific systems as "imaginary machines", a metaphor with which he in tended to prove that scientific systems, like machines, are cumber some devices characterised by a high number of "cog-wheels" which are progressively simplified: in the history of science, it often happens, that one great connecting principle is afterwards found to be sufficient to bind together all the discordant phaenomena that occur in a whole species of things25. A very similar comparison between language and machines subsequently appears in Considerations-. All machines are generally, when first invented, extremely complex in their principles, and there is often a particular principle of motion for every particular movement which it is intended they should perform. p. 138). H.F. Thomson observes that, according to Smith, "an organising princi ple for a new science has generally been selected as an analogy from some other art or science [...] and has been adapted to serve as the 'main hinge' for a related science". (Thomson, 1965, p. 223). Also A.S. Skinner has stressed "the problem of Smith's use of analogy as an organising principle" (Skinner, 1972, p. 315. See also Skinner, 1994, p. 9). On the use of analogies in Smith and even their in appropriate use, in the creation of knowledge in new areas of learning, see Myers (1983), pp. 97-9. R. Olson, has shown how scientists such as Maxwell, Rankine, Waterson, Kelvin, all Scottish for origin and university education, reflected in their own methods of thought, the writings of Scottish philosophers such as Stewart, Brown and Hamilton, who "were particularly concerned with analyz ing and emphasizing the roles played by analogies and models in the creation of scientific theories". These philosophers sought to enhance analogical reasoning, at least from a heuristic point of view. Given the lack of inductive information, for these writers metaphor was the only means to understand nature. Hypoth eses formed in this way would have been, not arbitrary fictions, but conjectures, capable of conforming to experience. (Olson, 1975, pp.3-25). 25. EPS, p. 66.</page><page sequence="12">186 Succeeding improvers observe, that one principle may be so applied to produce several of those movements; and thus the machine becomes gra dually more and more simple, and produces its effects with fewer wheels, and fewer principles of motion26. Smith's view of the machine derives from an evolutionary principle whereby the mechanism is modified and perfected through time. Although it continues to symbolize the order and the final coherence of the parts, it is freed from the idea of static perfection inherent in the seventeenth-century metaphor of the clock. The coherence of the mechanism is now measured against the new parameter increasing saving of its resources. The concept of the machine comprises not only the co-ordination of the "cog wheels" but also the principle of an efficiency which increases the more the mechanism is improved. It is this concept of the (transformation of the) machine that traverses Smith's economics. The introduction of a straightfor ward alteration to the steam engine, described in the opening pages of The Wealth of Nations, offers a clear example. The simple cord which automatically opens and closes a valve is a simplifica tion of the steam engine, since it performs the same operation as before by reducing the principles of motion, but in this case avoids additional work by the workman27. At the same time it is an improvement that brings major efficiency, saves working time and reduces costs. The principle of progressive efficiency of machines is also found in Lectures on Jurisprudence where a new area of metaphor ical intersection is outlined. The point of departure is the division of labour; this, Smith argues, does not originate from a project but from the propensity to exchange; a tendency which springs from the inclination of human beings to persuade each other. Persua sion is the constant employment or trade of every man, in the same manner 26. Consider., p. 223. 27. TO, I, pp. 20-21.</page><page sequence="13">187 as the artizans invent simple methods of doing their work, so will each one here endeavour to do this work in the simplest manner28. The principle of simplification also applies in the exercise of persuasion. In Smith's lexicon simplification coincides with the tendency of machines to increase in efficiency due to the discov ery of new "connecting principles". Society too acquires these characteristics in that the perfecting of persuasion is expressed by the improvement and greater transparency of exchange29. Market society is therefore represented by the machine in equilibrium, since its own interactive principles move in the direction of major efficiency and simplicity. All this is specified in the concept of the division of labour, which is the most advanced "connecting prin ciple" in the system of the production of wealth. This model in fact explains the complex/simple social relationship already evi denced by the development of the machine. That is to say, the simplification of the "principles of motion" leads to a greater capacity to perform more complex operations. Hence, "while the structure of the social division of labour becomes more complex, the individual worker's role becomes more simple"30. The market mechanism carries out increasingly complex co-ordination in rela tion to the simplification of the functions performed by its parts : "partial"31 workers and producers. It is here, however, that one encounters the most substantial limitation to Smith's mechanical metaphors. In particular, one notes the incompatibility - pointed out by Marx from another point of view32 - between the technical and social division of labour. In the former case, the operations of workers are geared to a specific purpose: the finished production of the good. Hence they express intentional compliance with a project. The role of workers in an individual manufacturing enterprise closely reflects 28. LJ(A), p. 352. 29. See Fiori (1992), pp. 41-53. 30. Rosenberg (1965), pp. 127-39. 31. TO, V, p. 783. 32. K. Marx (1983), pp. 285-90.</page><page sequence="14">188 the hierarchy of the machine's mechanisms, in that what matters is completing the project. Consequently, there can be no freedom of movement of the single parts. In the social division of labour, by contrast, freedom of movement is presupposed of decision making agents, for whom any form of the planned social harmo nization of their actions is out of the question. The lack of con tinuity between human planning and "unintended social outcom es" drives a wedge between the two dimensions of the division of labour, thereby invalidating the attempt to introduce into the im age of the machine (valid, however, only as regards the workshop) an essential aspect of market society: the independent "principle of motion" of individuals and the unintentional tuning of their actions on which social development depends. These inconsisten cies prevent the closure of the explanatory model, and they entail the use of other metaphorical models, above all biological models, with their greater capacity to handle the contradictions left unre solved by mechanical ones. 4. The Metaphor of the Body Biological metaphors appear rather infrequently in Smith's work. Although the influence of natural sciences can be discerned in his political economy theory33, it is difficult to trace a specifi cally biological train of thought in Smith. Conversely, it is rather easy to find metaphors of both the machine and the body used in philosophical movements34 of the late 1700s. Smith's most signifi cant organic analogies appeared in Wealth, but his knowledge of 33. Macfie (1967), p. 69 and p. 142; Campbell (1971), pp. 75-8; Lindgren (1973), pp. 53-9; Skinner (1979), p. 33. In F. Donzelli's opinion, the economic organicism characterises in general the "physiocratic-classical" tradition; the adjustment mechanism that guarantees the "conditions of reproduction" of the system is of a homeostatic type. That is, it displays a self-regulating tendency typical of living organisms. Hence we should talk of "equilibrium of reproduc tion" rather than of neoclassical "individualistic equilibrium" (Donzelli, 1986, pp. 204-46). 34. See for example: Hume (1964b), pp. 391-2 and p. 420.</page><page sequence="15">189 natural sciences was already evident in his acquaintance with the debate on natural science many years previously. In a letter to the "Edinburgh Review" (1755), he revealed not only his knowledge of the works of Buffon and Daubenton, but also his great interest in the entomological studies of Réaumur: a new world seemed to open up before his eyes, revealing the secrets of the "economy and management" of insects35. The idea that organic matter has hidden properties not yet discovered — while at the same time revealing a flexibility and capacity to adapt that no other mechanism, no matter how mod ifiable, possesses — engendered a new view of equilibrium which assailed political economy discourse at one of its most crucial points. The uniform, constant, and uninterrupted effort of every man to better his condition, the principle from which publick and national, as well as private opulence is originally derived, is frequently powerful enough to maintain the natural progress of things toward improvement, in spite both of the extravagance of government, and of the greatest errors of administration. Like the unknown principle of animal life, it frequently restores health and vigour to the constitution, in spite, not only of the disease, but of the absurd prescriptions of the doctor36. Considering the similarity between man's tendency "to bet ter his condition" and "the unknown principle of animal life", it is clearly the organism and not the machine that best conveys the process of wealth formation in the presence of forces acting in the opposite direction. The production of wealth and equilibrium in society is explained by the self-regulating processes of the organ ism. The level of development varies according to the power of these counter-tendencies, thus giving rise to different configura tions of equilibrium. The conditions of good health or illness - that is, the way savings (thriftiness) are transformed into invest ments - and the role fulfilled by public institutions in this same context generate different situations of equilibrium of varying dis 35. Smith, (1755), p. 249. 36. TO, II, pp. 343.</page><page sequence="16">190 tances from an optimal situation. This latter is a state in which the bad management of public expenditure has been neutralised, thus removing the most restrictive constraint on the human propensity to "improvement". However, since the counter-tendencies are not sufficient to reverse "the natural progress of things", the level of equilibrium is determined by the true state of the forces which oppose each other. Significantly, it is at precisely this point that Smith develops his metaphorical argument that man's efforts "to better his condi tion" correspond "unknown principle of animal life". It is this metaphorical context that carries forward and guides the forma tion of theory, on the assumption that these efforts are superior to the forces that oppose them. The legitimacy of this inference lies precisely in its recourse to the biological "unknown principle", without which the idea of social progress would be extremely dif ficult to sustain. Equally evident is the fact that this terminology is used because neither political economy nor biological science pos sessed sufficiently broad linguistic categories with which to give a thorough causal account of these phenomena. While the mecha nistic categories are inadequate, one observes more a certain syn tony between the development of biological science and political economy, rather than the mere overlapping of one category with the other. As the physiologist A. von Haller (1708-1777) pointed out, in the late 1700s, physiology had to handle "causes complète ment inconnues"37 which, when they arose, placed any mechanis tic paradigm in serious difficulty. The biological metaphor assumes even greater theoretical im portance when Smith uses it to refute the Physiocratic system by 37. "Il y a bien des choses dans la machine animale qui sont tout à fait étrangères aux lois de la mécanique-, de grands mouvements sont suscités par de petites causes; le rythme de circulation des humeurs est à peine ralenti par des causes qui, selon les lois reçues, auraient dû l'interrompre; des mouvements sont produits par des causes complètement inconnues» (emphasis added), Haller, Elementa physiologiae corporis humani, Lausanne,1757, cit. in Deleule (1979), p. 264. Deleule's text, addresses, with reference to Hume, themes very close to those proposed here. On these aspects see Foley (1976), pp. 120-38. The author interestingly draws a "Cartesian connection", albeit rather unconvincing, be tween Quesnay and Smith.</page><page sequence="17">191 contrasting his bodily metaphor with that attributed to Quesnay. At stake here was the status itself of political economy. According to Smith, the contrast is centred on the fact that "the human body frequently preserves [...] the most perfect state of health under a vast variety of different regimens; even under some which are generally believed to be very far from being perfectly wholesome" thanks to "unknown principle[s] of preservation" that also allow it to support "a very faulty regimen". Quesnay on the other hand, who Smith claimed, "seems to have entertained a notion of the same kind concerning the political body", maintained that a com munity "would thrive and prosper only under a certain precise regimen, the exact regimen of perfect liberty and perfect justice". For Smith, by contrast, man's tendency "to better his own condi tion, is a principle of preservation" which is able to correct the result of bad political economy, so that in the political body, however, the wisdom of nature has fortunately made ample provision for remedying many of the bad effects of the folly and injustice of man; in the same manner as it has done in the natural body, for remedying those of his sloth and intemperance38. This confrontation between the two systems of political eco nomy is expressed in two contrasting bodily metaphors. The tendency to better one's own conditions is less an outcome of "self-interest", than of an "unknown principle of preservation" involving the body's tendency to improve in spite of illness and the consequences of an unhealthy "regimen". This in turn conveys a specific view of the dynamism of society, one that differs from Quesnay's. One might say that the "body" of physiocratic theory is seen by Smith as lying too close to mechanistic logic, since by envisaging only one state of equilibrium (coincidental with the optimal state), it recognizes, as in the machine, only one type of means-ends coherence, a unique order in the absence of which turmoil would ensue. The notion of historical and social progress seems to derive from that of the science of life, which for unknown reasons de 38. WN, IV, pp. 673-4.</page><page sequence="18">192 velops even during illness. The assumption that the political body prospers even outside the "regimen of perfect liberty", was sus tained by Smith from a logical-historical point of view in Book III of Wealth, where he showed that a multitude of sub-optimal equilibria have characterized the history of Europe since the fall of the Roman Empire. According to Smith, European history has been connoted by the "reversal" of the optimal conditions for economic growth which has favoured the city over the country side through the establishment of corporative regulations39. The "political body", therefore, regenerates and activates the re equilibrating movements. These, however, cannot be completely efficient because the adjustment mechanism determining the allocation of capital and labour is inherently less efficient than it would be if it operated in conditions of the "natural equality" of exchange. The biological metaphor again reveals its soundness when used to indicate some unusual functions of economic policy. The case examined by Smith was that of an excessive flow of capital towards monopolistic commerce with British colonies. Instead of being distributed regularly among the various branches of foreign commerce, this capital was concentrated in one unique "great channel", upsetting the "natural balance" and thus rendering "the whole state of her body politick less healthful". Consequently, Great Britain resembles one of those unwholesome bodies in which some of the vital parts are overgrown, and which, upon that account, are liable to many dangerous disorders scarce incident to those in which all the parts are more properly proportioned40. It was very likely that the violent interruption of the circula tion of goods in the "great blood-vessel" of monopolistic foreign commerce would cause "convulsions, apoplexy, or death". In oth er words, the social body, like any other body, might find itself in a situation in which the self-regenerating properties typical of organisms would be inoperative. It was this limitation of the body 39. WN, I, pp. 135-59; III, p. 380. 40. WN, IV, p. 604.</page><page sequence="19">193 that led Smith to believe that equilibrium was restored by an ex ogenous factor: an economic policy which consciously and gra dually returned the social body to a state of order. Smith con cludes, in what manner, therefore, the colony trade ought gradually to be opened; what are the restraints which ought first, and what are those which ought last to be taken away; or in what manner the natural system of perfect liberty and justice ought gradually to be restored, we must leave to the wisdom of future statesman and legislator to determine41. This passage reveals a view of the role of economic policy which differs from that presented by the stereotyped models of liberalism based solely on Book V of The Wealth of Nations. In the circumstances described, in fact, it is impossible for the market independently to achieve a state of equilibrium. Cautious external intervention is instead required to restore order when the social body is unable to activate its usual self-regenerating capacities, that is, its own equilibrium. This fact in itself demonstrates that the biological model can not be extended to social functions: in certain circumstances, order cannot be obtained by means of the re-equilibrating prop erties characteristic of the model of the organism, it must instead be re-established by external intervention. The superimposition of the "living" model on social theory reveals its inadequacy in other areas as well. For example, Josiah Tucker considered it unaccept able that the features of the natural body should be "metaphor ically transferred to political constitutions". For Tucker, there was a specific constraint on the intersection of the two areas , insofar as although it be true that the Body Politic may come to an End, as well as the Body Natural, there is no physical Necessity that it must1,2. The political body in fact, is not subject to the irreversible ageing process of the natural body, nor are its illnesses "absolutely incurable". 41. WN, IV, p. 606. My italics. 42. Tucker (1974), p. 55.</page><page sequence="20">194 Other authors, Ferguson and Hume, for example, criticise the biological model of the individual body with its own life cycle. While the human frame has a general course; it has in every individual, a frail contexture and a limited duration [...] in a society, whose consti tuent members are renewed in every generation, [...] the race seems to enjoy perpetuated youth43. Like Tucker, Ferguson maintains that the social body is not perishable like organisms; this indeed is its distinctive feature. But he locates the methodological error with major precision in the analogy drawn between the life-cycle of the individual natural body and that of society — which cannot be likened to the cycle of infancy, adulthood and death — although he does accept that the biological model can be recovered through the concept of the spe cies. However, the observations of Ferguson and Tucker are of further interest because they clearly express the importance given to metaphors in scientific research. The adoption of a metaphorical model implies the creation of cognitive systems capable in direct ing theoretical research. However if the model is faulty, like that of the life-cycle of the individual animal body, the conclusions drawn will also be wrong. And this will inevitably produce some contradiction. 5. The "Invisible hand" The "invisible hand" appears on three different occasions in Smith's oeuvre. In my view, although differences emerge in the passage from one to the other, they share what can be called a "theory of order". 43. Ferguson, (1980), p. 209. For Hume the model of the animal organism, following a "natural progress from infancy to old age" cannot be used to show the greater populousness of ancient times "which is commonly supposed by the imaginary youth or vigour of the world" (Hume, 1964c, pp. 381-2). Evident here are the dangers inherent in these bodily metaphor from the point of view of the "querelle" between ancients and moderns.</page><page sequence="21">195 The "invisible hand of Jupiter" appears in The History of Astronomy to denote the anthropomorphic character of polythe ism. According to Smith, in polytheist religions the "invisible hand" is not used to account for the uniformity of nature, as he believes it should be, but on the contrary to explain unusual cases44. More precisely it consists in attributing a typically human "designing power" to the pagan gods, and it is manifest in the interruption and the alteration of nature45. The "invisible hand" is therefore, in this contest, a metaphor for intentionality. The defect of the polytheist conception is not its attribution to Jupiter of the will to intervene, but the fact that intentional power is addressed to exceptional natural occurrences. When in Theory the "invisible hand" expresses the modus operandi of God, intentionality con tinued to be the distinctive feature of the "Great Architect" and "Author of Nature". However it was now of opposite sign and was manifest in universal harmony and regularity. Divine will was the constancy and uniformity of nature, whereas human will was the modification, deviation and interruption of the course of na ture. Thus a clear boundary was drawn between the two spheres that would later constitute the assumption that work transformed nature in compliance with a pre-established end. The "hand", moreover, is a metaphor for intentionality be cause it refers to the planning will of its user46. It reveals its close link with the idea of planning in the famous image of the "man of system" who, according to Smith, ambitiously claims the power to arrange members of a community "as the hand arranges the different pieces upon a chess-board"47, while individuals, on the contrary, are endowed with independent "principlefs] of motion". In The Wealth of Nations and in its subsequent interpretations, the "invisible hand" denotes something very different: the achievement of order in the market which would be impossible by means of planning. However there is a gap here between the image 44. See Macfie (1971), pp. 595-9 and M. Brown (1988), pp. 134-6. 45. EPS, pp. 49-50. See also pp. 112-3. 46. Iacono (1982), p. 11. 47. TMS, p. 233-4. My italics.</page><page sequence="22">196 and its content: the hand arranges and organises according to an end purpose, but the order that should derive from its industry does not conform to a project: the organising hand would contra dictorily be deprived of the requisite of intentionality that com mands it. Yet again it would appear that the metaphor yokes together what theoretical explanation fails to render uniform48. Nevertheless, there is an element of continuity in the three "invisi ble hands". This, in extremely summary form, could be described as an attempt by Smith to understand in successive stages first the nature of human order and then of market society. As we have seen, for Smith both language and scientific sys tems are ways to confer order on the world. Both of them struc ture and (temporarily) organize data, giving uniformity and coherence to external reality, which thus ceases to be a "chaos of jarring and discordant appearances"49. Learning about reality is at one with the progressive construction of its internal coherence, irrespective of the fact that the order that the mind ascribes to things corresponds to the order of those same things (a problem that Smith leaves undefined in the History). What must be elimin ated is discontinuity, the factor which prevents the imagination from moving without ease from one object to another. Not only do these processes respond to aesthetic principles50; they show man's deeply rooted need to create systems with which to estab lish his cognitive bearings. Pagan cults and philosophy both en deavour to uncover an order in nature: the former by following an erroneous procedure, finding some principle to explain unusual natural phenomena; the latter by trying "to introduce order" by locating "the invisible chains which bind together all these dis jointed objects"51. The concepts of nature underlying these two visions of the world are antithetical, but for both of them the disturbing element is the exceptional event that diverges from the established order. The former account neutralises this exceptional 48. Ahmad (1990), pp. 137-44. 49. EPS, pp. 45-6. 50. EPS, p. 37; TMS, pp. 87-8, 179, 183, 185-87, 316. 51. EPS, p. 45.</page><page sequence="23">197 event by attributing it to the will of Jupiter, the latter reviews and reassembles the "visible chains" that organize nature. The fun damental endeavour is to restore a known order to a complex world. This complexity, the subject of Smith's early works, is mainly that of nature; subsequently it became that of modern mercantile society. One observes in this passage both the con tinuity of the Smith's version of rationality, and his political eco nomy, which became an independent form of research. It is in this sense, I believe, that the relationship continuity/discontinuity be tween the three "invisible hands" should be interpreted, because one discerns in them elements of development coherent with Smith's theory, as well as others which, for various reasons, be came marginal. The "invisible hand" appears for the second time in The Theory of Moral Sentiments. The situation described is that of a pre-capitalist economy characterised by scant production and cir culation of goods, and in which the income cannot be spent on consumption goods but must be used exclusively for the support of dependants and servants. While the "invisible hand" in The Wealth of Nations operates within developed mercantile relations in which individuals increase not only their own income but social income as well, in Theory it only intervenes in distribution, so that land-owners are led by an invisible hand to make nearly the same distribution of necessaries of life, which would have been made, had the earth been divided into equal portions among all its inhabitants, and thus without intending it, without knowing it, advance the interest of the society, and afford means to the multiplication of the species. When Providence di vided the earth among a few lordly masters, it neither forgot nor aban doned those who seemed to have been left out in the partion52. The type of pre-capitalist economy described by Smith re lates to a hierarchical society characterised by the personal de pendency between landlords and servants. This is not unlike the community described in Book III of the Wealth, in which an allo dial regime was first in force followed by a feudal one born from 52. TMS, pp. 184-5.</page><page sequence="24">198 the fall of the Roman Empire, when land was a "means of power", and the need for protection among the weakest gave rise to the master-servant relationship. In view of these characteristics it would seem that the pre modern society outlined in this passage of the Theory lends itself to the conceptions of pre-established harmony, and that it is not too distant from the images of the "machine" and the "body". In the feudal society described by Smith, both in Theory and in Wealth, individuals, who are in fact bound by links of dependency to a master, are not at all free in their movements. Their functions are rigidly determined, and in this they do not appear especially unlike their mechanical or bodily counterparts. The distribution of surplus in fact, moves from the landlord, who is therefore the "centre", to the other parts of the micro-system (farmers and de pendants). This, in a sense, replicates the old image of the clock, with its central motor distributing movement to the other cog wheels, which are inevitably in a subordinate position because they do not possess self-movement. Here there seems to emerge some sort of awareness of the ways in which one may talk of equilibrium and wealth in relation to the social relationships that characterise Western history. This awareness is most evident in the Wealth, especially in the third book, in which it is described as the passage from the feudal community to that of commerce. Here, since wealth is the object of enquiry, the differences are comparatively individualised. From command power over men, in mercantile society wealth becomes command power over labour. Smith's brief reference to pre-capitalist economy in Theory sets two connected limitations on the distribution of wealth : one natu ral, the other historical. The first is a bodily limitations: what the landlord consumes is in fact relative to his stomach. The second is that, since there is no possible alternative to consumption, the income cannot be spent on anything but the maintenance of far mers and subordinates. The difference between the proprietor's consumption and that of the servants is almost negligible: the sto mach of the rich "will receive no more than that of the meanest peasant"53. Here the "invisible hand" operates according to a spe 53. TMS, p. 184.</page><page sequence="25">199 cific social relation represented by the master-servant relationship54. The most evident element of continuity regarding the "hand" in the Wealth is the tendency to harmonization, the inevitability of an order asserted in any social form. The difference consists, instead, in the modality of its actions. In a market socie ty, where men are free from subordinate personal ties, not only the proprietors but "every individual [...] is [...] led by an invisible hand"55 that pushes him "frequently" to achieve collective well being unintentionally when he achieves his own. The "hand" now operates on the totality of the individual, and not only on a social class, since this is the condition for conceiving of order in a mer cantile society, which however (like the equilibrium of market) cannot be thought of as a given but as the result of independent actions by decision-making agents. This, I believe, is the challenge that the well-known Smithian metaphor must meet. And even though it continues to express, as previously, trust in the existence of an "order", it must incorporate the features of a non hierarchical, dynamic society, offering a paradigm that postulates harmony and non-conflictual complexity, and which at least approximately indicates conditions for the harmonization of pub lic and private interest. 54.
