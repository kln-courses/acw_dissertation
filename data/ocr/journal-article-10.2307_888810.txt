<plain_text><page sequence="1">Exhibition Reviews London 'Ant Noises' and 'Outthere' For people only casually or intermittently interested in the phenomenon of 'young' British art, the Royal Academy's exhibition Sensation in 1997, drawn from the vast hold- ings of Charles Saatchi, was the first occa- sion on which they could focus in one place on the work of most - but not all - of the leading players. For different reasons, two works became famous overnight, neither of them by the best or better-known artists in the show. One was a head-and-shoulders portrait of a glowering woman in oil on can- vas; the other was a realistic sculpture of a recumbent male nude figure. It was fasci- nating to see that two of the most tradition- ally conceived works on view provoked the public's most extreme reactions - revilement and enthusiasm. Marcus Harvey's Myra Hindley, a large portrait taken from a well- known photograph of the infamous child murderess, and Ron Mueck's Dead Dad, a minutely representational figure in silicone, were the two works in question. The first was the target of public opprobrium that resulted in a physical assault on the work soon after the show opened. The second was the object of popular acclaim and was spared the tirades aimed at most of its fellow exhibits. Its personal subject, eerie presence and obvious mimetic skill appealed to British fair play among the fouls being committed elsewhere on the pitch by artists such as Sarah Lucas, Jake and Dinos Chapman, Marc Quinn, Damien Hirst et al. But both works shared with that of the other artists an imagery of death, violence and mortality. When Sensation went to the Brooklyn Museum, New York, the focus of outrage changed (Myra Hindley is, after all, a daemonic figure only in Britain); on that occasion, the culprit was Chris Ofili whose paintings stabbed at religious sensibilities. Few commented on their relatively sober and traditional presentation - a decorative decorum in oil paint and collage on linen. Conversely, the increasingly subtle subvers- ities of Sarah Lucas, for example, were sidestepped for the unadulterated crudity of her means. Some consider that the power of much recent British work to ignite such public indignation is in itself a positive recommendation. As we know from the history of art, this is frequently not the case. Others propose cynicism on the artists' part as being at the root of their continuing abil- ity to catch the headlines. More often than not the cynicism comes from the viewer - the jaded critics and 'arts correspondents' and a public which has found little or no enlightenment from the press. There are complaints of relentless over-exposure, and certainly some artists show too much and too often so that transitional or slight works are given too much weight. At the same time, an overdose of press profiles and inter- views encourages a thin, autobiographical reading of the works and several of the artists are eloquent only in what they make: in cold newsprint they flounder or talk platitudes. These only fuel the inevitable backlash from once supportive or, at least, 34. Untitled (One hundred spaces), by Rachel Whiteread. 1995. Resin, 100 units, overall dimensions variable (Saatchi Gallery, London). tolerant quarters. Two exhibitions in London, the subject of enormous press coverage, have aroused some irritable and even bilious criticism, almost suggesting that these now well- known British artists should quietly dis- appear. (Indeed, from the rooms of Tate Modern, most are currently absent, while in Tate Britain they are herded into a pen of 'recent acquisitions'.) Between them, the two shows under review provide a partial opportunity to see how some of the Sensation artists have fared in the succeeding three years and how works from that exhibition look now, though neither show, it must be said, has curatorial finesse. In Ant Noises (anagram of Sensation) at the Saatchi Gallery there are in Part 1 works by Hirst, Ofili, Mueck, Lucas, Rachel Whiteread and Jenny Saville.' At Jay Jop- ling's new gallery White Cube2 (48 Hox- ton Square, N1), Outthere (closed 1st July) contained recent works by Gavin Turk, Tracey Emin, Hirst, the Chapmans, Har- vey, Quinn, Sam Taylor-Wood, Cerith Wyn Evans, Darren Almond and Gary Hume and by artists who were not in Sensation such as Antony Gormley, Mona Hatoum and the new addition to the gallery stable, the senior figures of Gilbert and George. The advantages of such baggy displays are few; the disadvantages many: above all the yoking together of utterly dissimilar artists allows a critical seepage from one to the next which is to no one's benefit. At least at the Saatchi Gallery, there 35. Hymn, by Damien Hirst. 1999. Painted bronze, 594.8 by 334 by 205.7 cm. (Saatchi Gallery, London). is enough space for near-solo displays to encourage discrete characterisation but, ominously, except for Hirst and Lucas, there is little post-Sensation art worth a visit. Whiteread's Untitled (One hundred spaces) (Fig. 34) dates from 1995 and is widely familiar but it looks even more impressive reinstalled here. Approached head on, the rows of casts made from the space under chairs fill a rec- tangular area up to the boundary formed by three white, undistracting walls. The particularities of a single cast object such as her Table and chair (1994) - both intimate and poignant - are subsumed in this great grid of squat resin cubes with their varied indentations (nine chairs were used to make up the hundred pieces) and slow-burning colours - amber, ochre, dull green. It is one of her most sombre and grandly conceived works. For some it evokes an unpeopled schoolroom, for others a cemetery of head- stones, all distinct yet all with the same pur- pose. Judd-like minimalist repetition meets anthropomorphic charge in this, the finest work in either exhibition. With it and with her celebrated Ghost (1990) currently on loan from the Saatchi collection at Tate Modern, Whiteread is seen as one of the most sub- stantial artists of the decade. Throughout both shows the human body is found in various permutations, once more underlining the continuing figurative impulse of British art which earlier in the year provided a popular hit in Mark Wallinger's simple and affecting Ecce Homo, sited in Trafalgar Square. Its plangent restraint was in the strongest possible contrast to the then concurrent show in the nearby National Gallery, of oppressively expressionist, tear- jerking paintings and sculpture by Ana Maria Pacheco, the main work Long night of the soul also centred on a near-naked male figure.' At the Saatchi Gallery, Damien Hirst's recent sculpture Hymn (1999; Fig. 35) is also a nude male and if it does not have the specifically Christian resonance of Wallinger's sculpture, it is multi-layered in its presence as automaton, phallus, fetish, specimen and god. As has been widely publicised, Hirst based his figure accurately on a small commercially available toy of a semi-skinned male designed as an anatomi- cal teaching aid. It is an unappealing little object and Hirst's vastly increased painted bronze bears as much relation to it as does a Nile-side Pyramid to a similarly shaped piece of Lego. Hymn is best seen from the untouched right side, in Foro Italico athlete's profile. As you come round to its front, the pink skin has been removed from half the head and all the trunk (the sculpture stops, kouros-like, at mid-calf, rising from its black 455</page><page sequence="2">EXHIBITION REVIEWS 36.

The long tradition of anatomical enquiry combines with contemporary sound-bite learning to produce a sculpture that is formally unremarkable but theatrically compelling. Two sculptures of male figures were on view at White Cube2. One of Gormley's self-portrait casts finds itself at a right-angle to one of the gallery walls, projecting head first high above the ground. Curiously, the figure's genitals fail to conform with grav- ity and do not hang down; the figure thus 37. Dreams go up in smoke, by Sarah Lucas. 2000. 142 by 82 by 62 cm. (Saatchi Gallery, London). retains its upright conception and looks absurd, having neither the poignancy of Wallinger's sculpture nor the metaphoric charge of Hirst's. Gormley acquits himself better at Tate Modern but with older work. The other 'self-portrait' is a hirsute wax figure by and of Gavin Turk (Fig.36) - part Marat in his bath, part Che Guevara, part expired addict or dosser. His Goberesque arm dangles into a dirty low industrial sink. It is extremely literal and though it is one of the most elaborate of Turk's continuing memorialisations of himself, it lacks his usual sardonic flair (as in his famous Pop shown in Sensation) and is too 'interesting' to make more than an eye-catching tableau. The painstaking application of body-hair into wax also occupies Ron Mueck whose huge whiskery self-portrait head Mask (1997) glowers from a wall at the Saatchi Gallery, from which it seems to float free. The just acceptable pathos of Dead Dad descends here into edgy whimsicality. The human figure has long been the vehicle for Sarah Lucas's mordant musings on female sexuality, works marked at one extreme by an innuendo that makes the Carry On films seem the height of sophisti- cation and at the other with a savage alert- ness all her own. The most recent of the four works by her at the Saatchi Gallery, Dreams go up in smoke (Fig.37), is a Koons-like kitsch table sculpture of a copulating couple (objet trouve, German, bronze, c. 1980), the horned male arising from a built-up whirl of end-to- end, tipped cigarettes. Although strikingly unlovely, it is one of her best inventions, the cigarettes transformed into some peculiar hybrid of raffia table-mat, flamenco-skirt and eager spermatozoa. The Michelinesque female bodies in the paintings ofJenny Saville have taken a turn for the worse. Still grossly corpulent and en- twined, as in Fulcrum (1999) at the Saatchi Gallery, they are painted in a more detailed and explicit manner that has become both fussy and slack. Her presence here is inex- plicable, for her work is made from a quite different conceptual standpoint from that of all the other artists on view. Chris Ofili's new two-part painting, also at Saatchi, is not quite as good as the earlier examples with which it is shown and seems to court good taste rather than, as before, to chal- lenge it. To gain a wider picture of British art in the 90s, these two exhibitions need to be considered in relation to the room of recent acquisitions at Tate Britain where, in con- trast, there is a conspicuous near-absence of 'death, violence and mortality'. The emphasis is on painting, with good but not crucial works by Fiona Rae, Hume, Ofili, Peter Davis, Richard Patterson and, from an older generation, John Murphy. It is good to see Angus Fairhurst represented with his amusing and disconcerting sound piece Gallery connections. But the crowded 'con- temporary sale' look of the designated space does nothing to alter the conclusion that here is too little, too late. The slightly false impression of an unadventurous acquisition policy is in part brought about by the pres- ence at Tate Modern of recently acquired British film and video (Wearing, Taylor- Wood, Douglas Gordon, Steve McQueen). This only points to a problem of allocation between the two Tates that will need to be urgently addressed. RICHARD SHONE 'Part I of Ant Noises runs to 20th August; Part II, sched- uled to include further works by Hirst and Saville, will also contain works by Hume, Turk andjake and Dinos Chapman (14th September to 26th November).
