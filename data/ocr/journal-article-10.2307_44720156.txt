Kim, and D.P.V. Weerappuli Ford Motor Company V. Roberts Institute for Product Safety D. Schneider Biokinetic Engineering, Inc. Copyright 1997 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc. ABSTRACT Recent design characteristic changes in a small segment of production passenger car front seats have focused attention on the influence of seat back strength on occupant kinematics and potentially injurious loads placed on occupants during rear end collisions. The National Accident Sampling Study database from the years of 1 980 to 1 993 was interrogated to determine the relationship between vehicle change in velocity, and the nature and severity of injuries sustained by passengers occupying those seats in rear end collisions. The results of the NASS data analysis show that the yielding seats in most current automobiles perform well as a passive restraint system. When the yielding passenger car seats are compared to the stiffer seat/cab, the passenger car seats offered improved protection. Additionally, the data indicate that the three point restraint system provides protection and restraint for front seat occupants in rear impact. To determine what effect seat back stiffness and other seat characteristics have on occupant responses, several seats were evaluated in dynamic Hyge rear impact sled simulations. Two types of production seats, with yielding seat backs, were modified to obtain higher seat back stiffness characteristics. Other production seats were chosen for various design features (i.e. head restraint and seat geometry, recliner systems, integrated seat belts, etc.), as well as seat back stiffness. All the seats were tested in a rigid environment with a restrained Hybrid III dummy. Seats A, A-M, and A-R, were tested at AVs of 9, 16, and 24 kph; all the other seats were tested at these speeds and also at a 40 kph AV. The results of the sled tests indicated that stiffer seats do not have any consistent advantages over yielding seats for the complete range of speeds tested. When the production seats were modified to obtain higher seat back stiffness, higher responses were seen at the neck, thoracic spine, and lumbar spine. The other, stiffer production seats of different design also showed no consistent improvement in occupant protection across the speed range. Even a seat with a head restraint located closer to the center of gravity of the occupant's head did not perform better than the baseline seat. Throughout the testing, the most sensitive response to seat design and crash severity was the lower neck extension moment. INTRODUCTION Collisions that involve forces directed from the rear of a vehicle have received a revival of research interest in recent years. The recent research involves the measurement of the dynamic response of the head/neck complex, the mechanism of soft tissue neck injuries and injury mitigation concepts. The majority of the new research is aimed at the identification and mitigation of low level, AIS 1 , neck injuries that are generally associated with low speed rear impacts. However, rear impacts also occur at higher speeds in which serious neck injuries can occur. Analysis of accident data in the US and UK [33] show that the incidence of AIS 3+ neck injuries in rear impact is low, 1%. In an attempt to further reduce the incidence of these serious neck injuries, stiffer 3935</page><page sequence="2">seat backs have been suggested [2], but the effect of increased seat back stiffness on the predominant soft tissue neck injuries has not been studied. The goal of this paper is to present the results of an experimental study aimed at determining the effect of seat back stiffness on the dynamic response of front seat vehicle occupants in a range of impact velocities covering low speed to high speed rear impact collisions. The first part of this paper reports on a literature survey conducted to identify past studies relative to the role of seat back stiffness in rear impact. The second part of this paper examines NASS data to extract overall effect of seat back stiffness on front seat occupant injuries, and the third part outlines and discusses the experimental study performed by the authors of this paper. LITERATURE SURVEY The impact response of an occupant exposed to a rear-end collision in the struck vehicle has been a topic of discussion in the scientific literature for over 30 years. Investigations have focused principally on two classes of occupant response and associated injury risk. At lower impact severities, the so called "whiplash" injury syndrome can be produced consisting of soft tissue injuries to the head and neck. At significantly higher levels of impact severity, often associated with seat back deformation, occupants can be exposed to more severe cervical spine injuries. The real world incidence of these severe injuries in rear impact is low, approximately 1% [33]. These two injury syndromes have been studied predominantly in independent research investigations, although they are closely linked by the impact response of the seat structure and the safety belt restraint system which dictates the nature of the crash forces imparted to the body in either crash severity. This review of the work done to date is limited in scope and will be divided into two sections. The first topic deals with whiplash injuries. This is followed by a discussion of the research describing the more severe rear end collision characteristics. WHIPLASH EXPOSURE - The first class of injury commonly reported by early epidemiological investigators was the so called "whiplash" injury to the neck produced by relative motion between the head and the upper torso during a rear impact [3,4,5,6,7]. These injuries include muscle and ligamentous strain producing transient cervical pain, symptoms of headache and concussion, and injury to the intervertebral disk infrequently requiring cervical fusion. Many automotive seat designs during this period lacked a means of support for the head and neck during the collision, allowing extension/flexion movement of the neck which was assumed to cause the whiplash injury pattern. Following the introduction of head support in seating systems, further field studies continued to document the production of inertial injuries to the head and neck in low speed collisions in spite of the design change. In a study of over 339,000 accidents, Nygren et al [8] found that 10% of those complaining of pain after a rear-end collision had remaining problems five years after the accident, while fitted headrests had little effect in preventing whiplash injuries. An in-depth study of 33 occupants exposed to a rear end collision was conducted by Olsson et al [9]. The duration of neck symptoms was found to be related to the estimated horizontal gap between the head and headrest. The sensitivity of this type of injury to the relationship of occupant and seat structure was recently reported by Viano and Gargan [10]. In a study of over 1900 vehicles he found that 90% of occupants had a less than optimum relationship to the headrest with respect to vertical elevation and horizontal space between the head and headrest. Quantitative investigations of the whiplash phenomena have also been conducted on a variety of test surrogates and human volunteers. These studies have provided data on both the injury mechanisms and occupant kinematics and kinetics associated with rear end collisions. Ommaya et a/ [11] exposed primates to "whiplash" inertial loading of the head and neck and produced a stunned or dazed condition of the test subjects simulating cerebral concussion. Similar work by Martinez [12] utilizing Belgian hares related the production of cranial and cervical pathology to a whiplash inertial acceleration. These and similar studies allowed the physiologic mechanism of these injuries to be investigated using a variety of species. The relationship of whiplash type head and neck injuries to the human in an automotive environment requires quantification of the impact conditions present in a rear end collision, including the mechanical response of the occupant's head and neck. To this end, Mertz and Patrick [13] conducted a series of crash simulator tests at speeds of 16 and 37 kph using anthropomorphic dummies (ATDs), human cadavers, and a volunteer. A means of analytically evaluating the neck reaction forces was developed. Test results indicated that the dynamically equivalent torque, due to muscle forces and cervical spine distortions calculated at the occipital condyles of the test subjects, is the major factor in producing neck injury. The same authors [14] expanded this investigation to the human injury threshold and observed that dynamic torques at the occipital condyles in extension and flexion of 47 and 88 Nm, respectively, could be tolerated. Torque versus angular position of the head response envelopes were proposed for ATD mechanical necks when in dynamic extension and flexion. A complete understanding of the various injury mechanisms that may be related to a rear impact whiplash exposure Is not known. Consistent with this lack of knowledge regarding the injuries themselves is a similar void in completely understanding the interaction of the occupant and the seat in such exposures. Numerous human volunteer studies have been undertaken to relate the occupant kinematics to the supporting seat structures and to define the tolerances in rear impact collisions. McConnell ef a/ [15] exposed four male volunteers to rear Impact AVs of 3 to 8 kph in four different production vehicles. Results of these low speed test series suggest a compression-tension neck injury mechanism and 3936</page><page sequence="3">concluded that this mechanism was distinct from the classic hyperextension phenomena. A postulated relationship between lower jaw movement during whiplash and the production of temporomandibular joint injury was suggested by Schneiderei al [16]. Szabo etat [17] did not find any substantiation for this claim in an experimental study of 16 kph car-to-car rear impacts with six different test subjects. These individuals, up to 58 years of age, suffered no ill effects in this series employing subcompact vehicles as the struck car. X-ray analysis of human head/neck motion was performed by Matsushita et al [18]. Results of this study suggest that the most significant factor in head/neck kinetic response is the initial curvature of the cervical and thoracic spine. Further evidence of the relationship between the occupant and seat was confirmed by Viano and Gargan [10] who demonstrated in Hyge sled tests using a Hybrid III ATD that non-optimum head to headrest geometry produced higher values of neck extension when compared to the proper positioning. McConnell et al [19] conducted a series of human volunteer tests. Fourteen car-to-car tests involving six male test subjects were performed. Although hyperextension limits were not reached, subjects exposed multiple times did exhibit typical whiplash symptoms suggesting that the injuries may have occurred before the headrest was contacted. For the last decade, there has been an increase in European interest in the low speed collision phenomenon. In an annual sample of Danish cervical spine injured patients, Juhl and Seerup [20] found that 46% of spinal lesions arose from traffic collisions. Thomas et al [21] examined characteristics of rear-end impacts occurring in France and observed that 70% of all collisions produce a struck vehicle AV less than 25 kph, and that cervical pain risk is high for females when the seat remains intact at a low AV. A simulation of low speed rear collisions was carried out by Svensson et al [1] using a new rear impact dummy neck (RID) mounted on a Hybrid III ATD. Test results showed that head-neck motion is influenced by the stiffness and elasticity of the backrest as well as the properties of the head restraint. An aggravation of the whiplash motion produced by the elastic rebound of the seat was also observed. Svensson et al [2] later used the same RID neck to evaluate modifications to the seat back and head restraint, virtually eliminating neck extension with the proper choice of seat properties. HIGH SPEED REAR END COLLISION - The second class of occupant response and attendant injury exposure is encountered in the high speed rear end collision where the resulting AV of the struck vehicle is sufficient to produce gross deformation of the occupant's seat back and significant rotation of the head, neck, and torso. These collisions expose the occupants to an entirely different field of accelerations, accompanying forces, and potential injuries. Again, the supporting seat structure, including the head restraint, plays an important role in mitigating injury. Severy et al [22] conducted car-to-car collisions at 32 and 48 kph with ATDs and concluded that head and chest accelerations were higher if the rear seated occupant was postured leaning forward, thus separating the ATD from the relatively rigid seat back. In this same series, front seated occupants had reduced head and chest accelerations resulting from the yielding front seat back even if initially separated from the seat back structure. The value of a headrest in preventing head and torso differential motion was also quantified. This work was continued [23] in an evaluation of whiplash protective devices. Some degradation of head support performance was observed as the relative impact speed increased for all designs considered. Berton [24] presented the results of a study relating seat back rotation, head restraint position, and rear end collision speed on crash dummy response. Velocity changes from 16 to 48 kph were employed in crash simulator tests and up to 80 kph closing speeds in car-to-car crashes. Berton observed an increase in head vertical accelerations associated with a rigid seat back and a reduction in head response if the seat back rotated rearward during the collision. He recommended that seat back structure deformation should be plastic or damped to minimize the forward acceleration of the occupant's torso and therefore reduce the amount of cervical spine extension. Employing a lumped parameter model of head/neck motion in a rear end collision, Martinez [25] recognized the reduction in occupant acceleration resulting from a yielding seat back structure. Human cadaver surrogates were used by Clemens and Burow [26] and H u et al [ 27] to study the nature of neck injuries sustained in 19-25 kph velocity changes in rear-end collisions. Disc disruption, ligamentous tears, and fracture dislocations were observed by Clemens in 53 exposures where the torso was constrained from moving. Hu also produced similar AIS 3 injury results in a smaller sample of six subjects supported by rigid and yielding seat backs. These were followed by new research which explored the relationship between the vehicle and seat structures, and the occupant's response in a rear end collision. Williams and McKenzie [28] analytically determined that increased seat back stiffness produced greater loads on the cervical spine. Mechanical testing of seats by Strother and James [29] documented the characteristics of production seating systems, while additional analysis of accident field data with a largely unbelted population showed that existing seat designs were providing a high level of occupant protection at moderate to severe levels of impact severity. Later, Warner et al [30] contrasted the consequences of a rigid versus yielding seat back design on occupant safety. Data were presented showing the stiffness of production vehicle seat backs had not changed significantly over a three decade period and elastic rebound associated with stiffer seat designs can produce subsequent injuries. The out-of-position occupant was identified as at risk when combined with a seat back of elevated stiffness. Strother ef al [31] performed 30 rear impact tests with a Hybrid III ATD comparing yielding and rigid seat back designs at speeds from 8 to 32 kph. Yielding seat designs produced lower u«70/</page><page sequence="4">injury measures for all out-of-position subjects whether belted or unbelted. James et al [32] Interrogated the NASS and FARS databases and examined the societal harm of various injury mechanisms associated with current seat back and restraint system designs. Harm related to occupant ejection or secondary vehicle contact was found to be minimal, while restraint usage had a substantial injury reducing effect. Parkin et al [33] analyzed 323 accidents in the United Kingdom and observed that plastic yielding of the seat back is beneficial in a rear end collision, producing a lower incident of AIS 1 injuries when compared with rigid seat backs. In this sample, less than 1% of occupants had injuries of AIS 3+. Severe head and neck injuries, AIS 3+, also comprised less than 1% of exposed occupants in the Thomas et al study [21]. Severe injuries of the cervical spine can occur in rear collisions with a high AV for the struck vehicle. AV of the struck vehicle has long been recognized as an important variable in describing the severity of impact for the struck vehicle [34]. Inertia! loading of the neck occurs when the impact conditions allow the torso to be supported and the head free to move rearward. The neck loads increase with additional increments of AV. The existence of various types of inertially created serious cervical injuries has been known and reported extensively by Portnoy et al [35], Moffatt et al [36], and Huelke et al [37]. Other types of head and cervical trauma can be produced through contact loading of the head/neck/torso system. In rear collisions these impact circumstances can arise in severe crashes where there is movement of an unrestrained occupant from the seated position, permitting contact with deforming vehicle structures, or a significant lateral component of velocity moves the occupant into a vehicle side structure resulting in an injury producing contact. Aspects of these crash kinematics and injuries were discussed by Saczalski ef al [38] in a presentation of 23 anecdotal case studies in support of increasing the overall stiffness of seat back design. No data were presented to evaluate the consequences of such a design change on injury production at the more prevalent low speed impact condition. In a report by Marriner [39], several analyses of real world accident data have concluded that the incidence of serious or greater injury to the head/neck complex has been, and continues to be an infrequent consequence of rear end collision. Strother and James [29] interrogated the 1 970- 1985 FARS and NCSS databases. Fatalities resulting from rear impacts were significantly under represented when compared to frontal and side modes of collision. Injury rates were also found to be significantly lower when compared to the other collision types, leading the authors to conclude that suggested changes in seat design would probably be of limited benefit for occupant protection. In 1991, James et al [32] followed up on this study and applied the societal harm concept [40] to rear impact injuries. Injuries resulting from contact with rear structures represented less than three percent of total harm in rear collisions, and a similar quantitative representation was found for unrestrained occupants who were totally ejected. Digges et al [41], in a review of 1 979-1 986 NASS data, concluded that for rear Impacts, non-contact injuries produced the largest portion of injury harm. Contact injuries in this study were produced predominantly by the seat itself and frontal components in the car. The 1988-1990 NASS data were examined for specific crash characteristics associated with seat performance for rear impacts with AVs between 48 and 62 kph. 92% of the observed injuries had an AIS less than or equal to 2, and the only injury with an AIS greater than 3 was a burn. A second subset of 72 occupants exposed to AVs greater than 48 kph also indicated that 7 of 16 restrained occupants in yielding seats received injuries from frontal components. Three of seventeen occupants in non-yielding seats sustained cervical fractures, all at AVs in excess of 53 kph. No cervical fractures were observed in seats that yielded. The reader is referred to the publications of Strother and James [29], James et al [32], and Warner et al [30], as well the Comments to Docket 89 20-N01-014 [42] for additional bibliographic information and an expanded discussion of seat back design considerations. NASS DATA REVIEW To define the nature and extent of the injuries associated with rear impact collisions, a subset of the NASS data, the Vehicles Crashworthiness Database, was employed [3,4]. This database includes only those accidents contained within the National Accident Sampling System from 1 980-1 994 wherein a valid AV was obtained by the investigator and injury data for the vehicle occupants were available. Vehicles that were involved in rollovers as initial or subsequent events were excluded. When rear impacts were filtered from the database, 4,424 of the vehicles containing 7,518 occupants were available for analysis. These constituted 1 1 % of the available vehicles and 1 1 .7% of the occupants in the planar dataset. Figure 1 shows the cumulative distribution by AV of all of the vehicles in the database where the Principal Direction of Force (PDOF) was 5,6,7 o' clock. The distribution of the accidents indicates that 50% of all rear impact collisions involve a AV of 21 kph or less and that 94% of all such collisions occur at AV s of 40 kph or less. The data also show that 86 % of all rear end collisions occur at velocity changes less than 26-32 kph, the range generally produced in the struck vehicle in the crash tests performed for FMVSS 301 . When we examine the distribution of injuries occurring with the occupants of the front, outboard seating positions of those passenger cars contained in the database, we find the distribution of injuries to be that shown in Figure 2. Figure 2 illustrates the distribution, as a function of AV, for occupants of the front outboard seating positions of automobiles whose respective maximum AIS = 0, 1 or 2, and 3 or greater. The data 3938</page><page sequence="5">show that, for those occupants who received maximum injuries of AIS 3 or more, less than 1% of all occupants in rear impacts received injuries with changes in velocity of the struck vehicle in excess of 40 kph. Figure 1 . - Distribution of vehicles vs. AV for rear impacts (n=4,424). Figure 2. - Distribution of injured occupants vs. AV for rear impacts: MAIS = 0 (n=2,161), MAIS = 1 or 2 (n=3,124), and MAIS = 3+ (n=98). It has been suggested that the study of injuries to the occupants of pickup trucks in rear impacts would show the efficacy of stiff seats since the close proximity of the back of the cab to the seat backs should prevent seat back deflection and produce a seat that is relatively more rigid than passenger car seats. Figure 3 examines this hypothesis. Figure 3 compares the injuries to the occupants of passenger cars and pickup trucks in rear impact collisions. The potential for minor to moderate injury when seated in a pickup truck is greater, for any change in velocity, than when seated in the front seats of passenger cars. The same relationship holds true whether the occupants are restrained or unrestrained. Automobile occupants generally have a lower risk of injury when exposed to a rear end collision of the same severity as one which produces minor to moderate injuries in occupants of pickup trucks. This may indicate that the movement toward stiffer seat backs could very well increase rather than decrease the injuries that they are trying to avoid. Similarly, it has also been suggested that the deflection of the seat back will allow the occupants of those seats to be ejected from the vehicle through the rear window. A review of all cases of ejection of front seated occupants in rear impacts who were utilizing three point restraints found that only one, out of 2,224 occupants, was ejected through the rear window. That occupant was originally seated in the front seat of a pickup truck. Figure 3. - Distribution of occupants with AIS = 0, 1 , or 2, vs. AV for rear impacts: automobiles (n=1,318) and pickup trucks (n=64). Finally it is worth examining the performance of current automotive seat backs in rear impacts with the performance of three-point active restraints in frontal collisions. Figure 4 compares the two impact environments. It illustrates the distribution of drivers and right front seat passengers in frontal and rear impacts with the same maximum AIS, three or greater. The difference in the two groups, other than the direction of impact, is the use or non-use of the three point restraint system. The occupants in the frontal collisions were using the three-point active restraints while those in the rear impacts were unrestrained. The distribution of the two groups is essentially the same, showing yielding seat backs provide a similar amount of protection to the unrestrained occupant in rear impacts that a three-point belt system provides in frontal impacts. DYNAMIC HYGE SLED TESTING A total of three series of Hyge sled tests were conducted to determine the effect that seat back stiffness, and other factors, have on occupant kinematics and responses in rear impacts. In the first two test series, the only difference between the tested seat configurations was seat back stiffness; all other factors were held constant. In the third series, production front seats of various designs and stiffnesses were tested to see if any of them provided the occupant with a 3939</page><page sequence="6">Figure 4. - Distribution of occupants with MAIS = 3+ vs. AV: three-point belt restrained occupants in frontal impacts (n=552) and unrestrained occupants in rear impacts (n=56). significant advantage in rear impacts. The same test protocol was followed in all three series. TEST METHOD - For all three series, the seats were installed in either a rigidized car buck or on a rigid platform buck, eliminating any performance differences due to structural characteristics or floor deformation. The height of the platform buck's floor, with respect to the seat, was adjusted to approximate the real world geometry for each seat type. All the seats were placed in mid-seat track position, except where noted. If the seat cushion was adjustable, it was placed in the full down position and the seat back was set at an angle between 20° and 21°. Adjustable head restraints were placed in their upper most vertical setting, and if they rotated, in their most rearward position. Rear seats were not installed to allow for maximum front seat back deflection. If a seat showed any signs of permanent deformation or damage, it was replaced before the next test. The Hyge sled acceleration pulses used were derived from a 80.5 kph car-to-car rear impact and scaled to give the required AVs (Fig.5). Figure 5. - Hyge sled acceleration pulses. Every seat was tested with a Part 572(b) Hybrid III dummy whose suitability for rear impact testing has been established by Prasad ef a/ [46]. The Hybrid III dummies were instrumented with head, chest, and pelvis accelerometers; upper and lower neck load cells; and lumbar spine load cells. If available, thoracic spine load cells were also used. All the instrumentation was oriented according to SAE J21 1 convention. The Hybrid III dummies were consistently placed in the normal seating position for each type of seat. All the ATDs were restrained with the corresponding seat belt system except where noted. RESULTS: Series 1 - In order to see the effect seat back stiffness has in rear impacts without the complication of confounding factors, three versions of a high volume, American production front bucket seat were tested at AVs of 9,16, and 24 kph. For these configurations, all the factors, such as head restraint and seat geometry, cushion stiffness, etc., were identical; only the seat back stiffness was changed. Seat A, the baseline, is the standard, unmodified production seat with a yielding, deformable seat back and a single, outboard recliner (Fig. 6). Seat A-M is a version of the baseline seat which has been modified to produce a higher seat back stiffness. Figure 7 shows the relative seat back stiffness functions of seats A and A-M as measured in an upper- bar test. The functions were obtained by applying a rearward force to the seat back frame through a rigid bar approximately 0.6 m above the seating reference point and measuring the bar's displacement. The increase in seat back rigidity was obtained by welding a steel bracket to the seat back and seat cushion frames on the inboard side of the baseline seat. Seat A-R is the rigid configuration of the base seat. For A-R, a metal bar, which contacted the seat frame below shoulder level, was placed behind the seat and rigidly attached to the sled buck, preventing any rearward deflection or movement of the seat back (Fig. 8). For all three seat versions, the 50,h% Hybrid III was restrained with the corresponding three-point seat belt system.

Figure 8. - Hybrid III in seat A-R, rigid seat modification. Figure 9 shows the normalized peak magnitudes of the pertinent neck responses for seats A, A-M, and A- R. Each response was normalized with respect to its Injury Assessment Reference Value (IARV), listed in Table 1 , therefore, any value greater than one indicates that there is a risk of severe neck injury to a small portion of the population. The upper neck lARVs were previously established by Mertz [45], and for the shear and tensile responses of the lower neck, the corresponding upper neck lARVs were used. For the lower neck extension moment, an IARV of 154 Nm was chosen [46]. Table 1. - Injury Assessment Reference Values (IARV) Response IARV Upper Neck Fx +/- 3100 N Upper Neck Fz +3300 / - 4003 N -Corrected Upper Neck My -57 Nm Lower Neck Fx +/- 3100 N Lower Neck Fz +3300 / - 4003 N -Lower Neck My ļ -154 Nm As Figure 9 shows, at a AV of 9 kph, none of the seats have any neck responses which approach a possibly injurious level. Because the AV is so low, most of the occupant's energy is absorbed by the seat cushions, not by seat back deflection, so there is not much differentiation between the responses with these three seat configurations. Compared to the baseline, A, A-M has slightly lower tensile peak magnitudes at the upper and lower neck and A-R has slightly lower peaks for the lower neck tension force and corrected upper neck extension moment (moment at the occipital condyles), and a slightly higher lower neck shear force peak. The peak magnitudes of the ATDs' responses for the 9 kph AV are listed in Appendix A - Table 1 . The lower neck extension moments, which are not significantly different for the three seat variations at this speed, also correspond to the moment obtained with a seat with an average Neck Injury Factor score (NIF), defined by Eichberger eřa/[47], of one, at a similar speed as discussed in [46]. At the higher AV of 16 kph, the differences in seat back stiffness between the three configurations affect the Hybrid Ill's responses, as can be seen in Figure 10. For the neck responses of concern, the baseline seat A, which has the lowest seat back stiffness as indicated by dynamic deflection, has the best overall performance. Seat A-M has three responses with higher peaks (the corrected upper neck extension moment, the lower neck shear force, and the lower neck extension moment) than seat A, and only one response, the lower neck tensile force, with a lower peak. The completely rigid seat, A-R, has four higher responses (the upper and lower neck tensile forces, the lower neck shear force, and the lower neck extension moment) and only one lower response, the corrected upper neck extension moment. The lower neck extension moment reflects the trend of increasing seat back stiffness. This, in turn, indicates that as the seat back stiffness of the base seat is increased, the NIF rating of the seat will also increase [46]. Even though none of these channels indicate that there is a risk of severe neck injury, the higher neck forces and moments seen with seats A-M and A-R also indicate that as seat back stiffness increases, the risk of low severity injuries, such as whiplash, also increases. The ATD's responses are listed in Appendix A - Table 2. It is interesting to note that increasing the seat back stiffness also resulted in some significantly increased thoracic and lumbar spine loads and torques. Figure 1 1 clearly illustrates that, for a 24 kph AV, the overall neck performance obtained when the Hybrid III was tested with the seat with the lowest seat back stiffness, A, is better than those obtained with the stiffer seats. Seats A-M and A-R both have significantly higher lower neck shear forces and noticeably higher lower neck extension moments than seat A. In addition, the peak corrected upper neck extension moment measured with seat A-R is significantly higher than that measured with seat A although both peak values are fairly low. Again, none of these neck responses indicate that there is a risk of severe neck injuries, but seats A-M and A-R may 3941</page><page sequence="8">Figure 9. - Neck responses normalized with respect to lARV's: AV= 9 kph, seats A, A-M, and A-R.

The ATD responses for this test speed, listed in Appendix A - Table 3, also show a significant increase in the thoracic and lumbar shear spine forces with the two stiffer seat configurations. Series 1 clearly shows that for a range of speeds up to a 24 kph AV, which covers 67% of all rear impacts reported in NASS (Fig. 1), that as seat back rigidity increases, the occupant's neck loads and moments also increase. Even though none of these forces or moments indicate a risk of severe neck injury, the higher magnitudes indicate a higher risk of low severity, soft tissue neck injuries such as whiplash. Series 2 - A second, high volume, American production front bucket seat with a single, outboard recliner was also studied to determine the effect of seat back stiffness on occupants under more severe conditions (Fig. 12). This second seat was tested not only at the lower speeds (AVs of 9,16, and 24 kph), but also at a higher AV of 40 kph, covering 94% of rear impact accidents. Only two variations of this seat were tested: seat B, the standard, production seat, and seat B- R, a rigid version of the seat. The same external modification which was used to make seat A-R rigid was also used for seat B-R. All other factors were held constant. The corresponding belt system for these seats consisted of a passive shoulder and active lap belt combination. Figure 12. - Hybrid III in seat B. A comparison of the pertinent neck responses obtained for the two different seat configurations are shown in Figures 14-16 and 18 for the respective AVs of 9,16, 24, and 40 kph. At the 9 kph AV, the similarity of the peak magnitudes of the responses indicates that compression of the head restraint and seat cushions is still the primary mechanism of energy absorption. The rigid seat, B-R, did have a higher corrected upper neck extension moment, but none of the scores indicate that there is a risk of severe neck injuries. Some of the Hybrid III lumbar and thoracic spine responses increased significantly with seat B-R in comparison to seat B (Appendix A - Table 4). More differentiation is seen between the two seat configurations at the 16 kph AV (Fig. 15). Three of the Hybrid Ill's neck responses (the corrected upper neck extensions moment, lower neck tensile force, and lower neck extension moment), have slightly higher peaks with seat B-R than with seat B. There is no indication of a risk of severe neck injuries with either seat at this speed. The peak magnitudes of the negative thoracic shear and compressive lumbar forces are dramatically higher with the rigid seat, as shown in Appendix A -Table 5. Figure 16 clearly shows that the yielding, deformable seat, B, mitigates neck loads and moments better than the rigid seat, B-R, at a 24 kph AV. The higher responses with B-R also indicate that the rigid seat presents the occupant with a greater risk of low severity neck injuries, such as whiplash, than the production seat. There were also significant increases in some of the thoracic and lumbar spine channels (Appendix A -Table 6). At the highest AV, 40 kph, the lower neck extension moment measured with seat B-R exceeds the IARV of 1 54 Nm, indicating that there is a risk of severe neck injury to some portion of the population with this rigid seat (Fig. 18). The production seat, B, whose seat back has yielded completely, has no responses which exceed their respective lARVs and, in general, had lower responses than B-R. Plastic deformation of the seat back limited the occupant's neck loads and moments; and despite the large deflection, the restrained Hybrid III dummy was retained in the seat (Fig. 13). Significantly higher shear and compressive lumbar spine forces were also noted with the stiffer seat (Appendix - Table 7). Figure 13. - Hybrid III in seat B: AV = 40 kph, @185 ms. The results of series 2 clearly indicate that by deforming and absorbing energy, the production seat protects the occupant better than the rigid seat in rear impacts. Throughout the range of speeds tested, the rigid seat produced slightly higher neck responses than the production seat and at the highest speed, one of the responses exceeded its IARV.

Series 3 - Four different types of production front seats were subjected to the same simulated Hyge sled rear impacts for the AVs of 9, 16, 24, and 40 kph. These seats were chosen for various characteristics in their designs, such as head restraint geometry, cushion stiffness and geometry, seat back stiffness, and corresponding restraint systems, which differed from those of the production seats used in series 1 and 2. The Hybrid III responses obtained with these seats are compared to those obtained with seat B as a baseline (see Appendix A - Tables 4-7). Seat C, shown in Figure 17, is a European, production front bucket seat whose fixed head restraint was given a "good" rating by the IIHS in comparison to the "poor" rating seat B received [48]. The seat back has a dual recliner system and a higher stiffness characteristic, as determined by dynamic deflection, than seat B. A three-point belt system from another vehicle was used to restrain the ATDs because the original three-point belt system for seat C was unavailable. Figure 17. - Hybrid III in seat C. At the lowest test speed, 9 kph AV, a comparison of the neck responses do not point out any major differences between the performances of seats B and C (Fig. 19). The significantly lower corrected upper neck extension moment obtained with seat C is balanced by the significantly higher lower neck shear force. The other four responses are very similar to those of seat B. The thoracic and lumbar spine forces and moments for both seats were also comparable. A more noticeable difference between the two seats is seen at the 16 kph AV, Fig. 20. Seat C, which deflects about half as much as seat B dynamically, has four higher neck responses despite having a better ranked head restraint. The lower neck tensile force and extension moment are significantly higher than those in the baseline seat. Neither seat produces any neck response which indicates a risk of severe neck injury, but the increased magnitudes seen with seat C indicate that it may present the occupant with a higher risk of low severity neck injuries, i.e. whiplash. At the higher AV of 24 kph, five of the six neck responses with seat C have higher peak magnitudes than with seat B (Fig. 21). None of the neck responses indicate that there is a risk of high severity neck injuries, but the stiffer seat, C, again has a higher risk of whiplash type injuries despite the difference in seat design. The large increases in some of the thoracic and lumbar spine responses seen with increasing seat rigidity in series 1 and 2 are not evident here. At a AV of 40 kph, substantial yielding occurred in both seats B and C, but the deformation modes were different. For seat B, the seat back itself deformed about the seat pivot whereas with seat C, the front, outboard seat track bracket separated from its attachment to the sled. The neck responses are shown in Figure 22. The lower neck extension moment of seat C signifies a risk of serious neck injury to a portion of the population since the IARV is exceeded and the higher peaks of the other responses indicate that C presents a higher risk of low severity neck injuries than seat B. Seat D, a captain's seat with a pedestal base and no seat track adjustment, is available for installation in customized American vans (Fig. 24). It should be noted that its vertically adjustable head restraint, in its upper most position, is much higher with respect to the Hybrid Ill's head than that of seat B. Seat D was chosen for this study not only because its different design, but also because of its reinforced seat back. A seat belt, which is connected to the seat frame, runs diagonally up the seat back from the inboard to the outboard side and attaches to the vehicle's structure via the D-ring. The purpose of this added restraint is to limit the seat back deflection in an impact situation. With seat D at a AV of 9 kph, the three upper neck responses and the lower neck extension moment have higher ratios to their lARVs than with seat B (Fig. 23). At this low speed, this is the most noticeable deviation in performance from the baseline seat that is seen and a major reason for this was probably the increased cushion depth of seat D. There are also significant increases in some of the thoracic and lumbar spine responses. At the next speed, a 16 kph AV, the peak upper and lower neck tensile forces increased significantly with seat D but, at the same time, the corrected upper neck extension moment and the lower neck shear force decreased compared to the baseline responses (Fig. 26). Several of the thoracic and lumbar spine responses also increased significantly while only one decreased. Neither of these seats present the occupant with a risk of serious neck injury at this speed. In comparison to seat B, seat D has three lower neck responses (the lower neck shear force and the corrected upper neck and lower neck extension moments), and two higher responses (the upper and lower neck tensile forces), and may offer the occupant slightly more protection at a AV of 24 kph (Fig. 27). This cannot be attributed to the increased seat back rigidity 3945</page><page sequence="12">1.2 ļ 1.0 1 ļ - 0.8 0.6 -■ ■I ^ d h-Bl-d I ■ i I F Up Up Cor.

The slight improvement at this speed may be the result of the increased head restraint height, some other design characteristic, or the fact that the head restraint support deformed slightly, absorbing some energy (Fig. 25). With D, there are also large increases in the peak tensile forces of the thoracic and lumbar spine compared to those measured with seat B. Figure 25. - Hybrid III in seat D: AV = 24 kph. At the highest AV of 40 kph, seat B clearly offers more protection to the occupant than D (Fig. 28). With seat D, five of the neck responses have higher ratios to their lARVs than with seat B. One, the lower neck extension moment, even exceeded its reference value signifying a risk of severe neck injury to some percentage of the population. The extreme deformation of the head restraint support, seen in Figure 29, illustrates the high energy level of this impact. At this speed, restricting the deflection of the seat back, via the internal seat belt connected to the seat frame, did not benefit the occupant. Seat E is a production, European front bucket seat with a dual recliner system and integrated seat belts (Fig. 30). The head restraint, which is mounted to the seat by one outboard support arm versus two center rods, can be rotated manually to adjust for tilt. The vertical position of the head restraint automatically adjusts for the occupant as the seat cushion is positioned. From the dynamic deflections measured for this seat, it is clear that it has a much higher seat back stiffness characteristic than seat B. 3948</page><page sequence="15">1.2 -J 1 1.0 0.8 0.6 - 0.4 - ■ oo " - , i M I , M - i , ■ - i | - i - i | j ~ Up Up Cor.

Figure 30. - Hybrid III in seat E. Despite the vast differences between the two seat designs, at the 9 kph AV, no drastic differences are seen in the neck responses (Fig. 31). However, three of the neck responses (the lower neck tensile force, and corrected upper neck and lower neck extension moments) are higher with seat E than B. These responses indicate that the increase in seat back rigidity, or some other design characteristic, may be having a slight effect on the neck responses even at this low speed. There are significant increases in the peak magnitudes of some thoracic and lumbar spine responses as well. At the 16 kph AV, the upper neck shear force, and the lower neck tensile force and extension moment measured with seat E are slightly higher than those of seat B (Fig. 32). This increase is offset by the significantly lower corrected upper neck extension moment. Both of these seats do not present a risk of severe neck injuries to the occupant, and as indicated by the similar forces and moments, would present a similar risk of low severity injuries such as whiplash at this speed. Some of the thoracic and lumbar spine responses have significantly higher peak magnitudes with seat E than with seat B, but none of the values are injurious. Even with the increased seat back rigidity, at a AV of 24 kph, Figure 33 indicates that seat E provides the occupant with a slight advantage over seat B. The lower peak magnitudes of the upper and lower neck tensile forces and lower neck extension moment seem to outweigh the higher peaks of the upper neck shear force and corrected extension moment. Although there is no risk of severe neck injuries with either seat, the risk of low severity injuries such as whiplash, is probably slightly lower with seat B at this speed. Some of its characteristics, such as increased head restraint height, and the fact that its design allows the head restraint to move rearwards with the occupant's head, thereby absorbing energy, could account for this. With regard to the lower torso, the amount of significantly higher and lower responses seen with seat E is about even and only the negative lumbar shear force has increased dramatically compared to the baseline. At the highest speed, 40 kph AV, the results are mixed (Fig. 34). With seat E, the upper and lower neck shear forces, the upper neck tensile force, and lower neck extension moment are all higher than with seat B. However, with seat B, the corrected upper neck moment has a significantly higher peak and the lower neck tensile force peak is also higher than with seat E. Without knowing the exact mechanism that causes whiplash or other neck injuries, it is hard to determine which one of these seats presents the occupant with a higher risk for these types of injuries. Since none of the IARVS was exceeded, there is no risk of severe neck injuries with either seat at this speed. Seat F, which is also a production, European front bucket seat, has a design very similar to seat E (Fig. 37). It has a dual recliner system, a head restraint which is mounted from a single, outboard arm and adjusts automatically along its vertical axis as the seat cushion is positioned, and an integrated belt system. The head restraint can also be rotated manually to adjust for tilt, like that of seat E. However, by comparing the dynamic deflection with seat E, it can be determined that seat F has a seat back stiffness characteristic which is much stiffer than seat B's or E's. Overall, as seen in Figure 35, the performance of seat F is slightly worse than seat B's at the 9 kph AV. Although only the lower neck tensile force has a significantly larger peak, a total of five of the six neck responses have higher peaks than the baseline. This may indicate a slight increase in the risk of whiplash type injuries with seat F even at this low speed. Also, the peak negative shear and compressive forces of the lumbar spine are approximately three times as large as those measured with seat B. At a AV of 1 6 kph, four of the six responses (the upper neck shear force, the upper and lower neck tensile forces, and the lower neck extension moment) have higher ratios to their lARVs with the stiffer seat F, than with seat B (Fig. 36).

Although all the values are low, the increases suggest that the occupant may have a higher risk for whiplash type injuries with the more rigid seat, F, than with B, the yielding seat, at this speed. Also, with seat F, the peak compressive lumbar spine force is approximately 4 times that of the baseline's. Figure 37. - Hybrid III in seat F. In contrast to the 16 kph AV response, seat F provides better protection to the occupant's neck than seat B at a AV of 24 kph (Fig. 38). Four of the neck channels (the upper and lower neck tensile forces, the lower neck shear force, and the lower neck extension moment) have lower ratios with seat F than with seat B, although none of the peak magnitudes are significantly lower. At this speed, the occupant has no risk of severe neck injuries with either seat but may be more at risk for low severity injuries, such as whiplash, with the baseline seat. The negative shear and compressive lumbar spine forces increased dramatically with seat F. At the highest AV of 40 kph, the yielding, deformable seat B provides the occupant with better protection than the more rigid seat F (Fig. 39). Four of the responses (the upper neck and lower neck shear forces, the upper neck tensile force, and the lower neck extension moment) are higher with seat F. The fact that the lower neck extension moment is slightly below its IARV with seat F alone indicates that seat B presents a smaller risk of neck injury to the occupant. Summary - Seat C, which has a more conventional design than E or F and a higher seat back stiffness than B, did not provide as much protection to the occupant as seat B, despite the improved static position of its head restraint. This comparison shows that good static head restraint position does not necessarily guarantee good dynamic performance, even for low speed rear impacts. Seat D, which has much thicker seat cushions than any of the other seats and a seat back restraint which limits rearward movement, seems to confirm the fact that at the lowest speed, a 9 kph AV, the primary mechanism of controlling neck loads and moments is deflection of the seat cushions, rather than the seat back itself. Its neck responses at the 16 and 24 kph AVs indicate that despite the increased seat back stiffness (which is comparable to that of seat C), equivalent performances to that of seat B were obtained. At the highest AV, however, a significant decrease in performance was observed, possibly indicating that increased seat back rigidity is more detrimental in severe rear impacts. Seats E and F, although very similar in design to each other, were designed very differently than the other tested seats. They also had much higher seat back stiffnesses, especially seat F, which was almost rigid. At the two lowest speeds, 9 and 1 6 kph AV, both seats produced results which were either equivalent or slightly worse than that of seat B. These are similar to the results of series 1 and 2 which indicated that a higher seat back stiffness may increase the occupant's risk of whiplash type injuries at low speeds. However, unlike series 1 and 2, at a AV of 24 kph, both seats E and F provided the occupant with protection equal or slightly better than that offered by seat B. The obvious conclusion is that other seat characteristics can be designed to either compensate for, or work with increased seat back rigidity, to provide the occupant with an acceptable level of protection. At the highest AV of 40 kph, seat E provided the occupant with protection similar to that of seat B, but seat F, the more rigid seat, did not. Overall, the results of series 3 seem to indicate that no one seat design characteristic determines occupant performance in rear impacts for the range of AVs tested. Seat back stiffness, however, seems to be a very influential factor. For the lower severity rear impacts, other seat characteristics (such as head restraint geometry, cushion stiffness, seat back geometry, etc.), can be designed to provide the occupant with protection similar to that offered by a seat with a yielding, deformable seat back. However, at the more severe impacts, controlled deformation of the seat back seems to absorb some of the occupant's energy, thereby, mitigating some of the neck loads and moments while stiffer seat backs may aggravate the condition. In the three cases where the lower neck extension IARV was exceeded at a 40 kph AV, two of the seats (B-R and D) were stiffer than the baseline, B. The third seat, C, which did yield at the 40 kph AV, was also stiffer than the baseline seat at the lower velocities tested. DISCUSSION Dummy response data from three series of tests with various seats have been reported in this paper. Based on the forces and moments developed at the occipital condyles of the Hybrid III dummy, it can be said that in the majority of the tests across the speed range, between AVs of 9 and 40 kph, no loads were noticed that exceeded known lARVs at the head/neck junction. Only in one case, seat C, at the 40 kph AV, the upper neck 3953</page><page sequence="20">1.2 H 1.0 0.8 0.6 ^ 0.4 ■ 0 0 " I M I M - i i m-, | M ~ Up Up Cor.

In most cases, the forces and moments at the occipital condyles were substantially below their known lARVs. It is believed that these responses were low, regardless of seat back stiffness, due to the head restraints being positioned at their highest position in the tests and because the dummies were belted and were retained in the seat even at the highest AV where two of the seat backs had deformed to a nearly horizontal position. The neck response most sensitive to impact severity and seat back stiffness appears to be the extension moment measured at the location of the lower neck load cell. Most of the other neck responses measured at both the upper and the lower neck load cell locations were not as sensitive to impact speed or seat back stiffness. The extension moment measured at the lower neck load cell, for various test severities and seat back stiffnesses, is shown in Figure 40. Also shown in this figure are the extension moments at the occipital condyles. In Figure 40 seat B is a production seat that yields substantially as impact severity increases. Seat B- R is a rigid version of seat B, and seat F is the stiftest production seat tested in this study. The relative insensitivity of the occipital condyles extension moments to impact severity and seat stiffness is obvious from this figure. However, it can be seen that the extension moment at the lower neck load cell location is sensitive to both impact severity and seat back stiffness. It can be seen in the figure that for the baseline seat, the extension moment increases with impact severity - from 57 Nm at 9 kph AV to 122 Nm at 40 kph AV. This moment increases linearly with impact severity with the rigid seat, B-R, to the extent of exceeding known tolerable moments [46] at the 40 kph AV. Seat F, the stiftest production seat, has higher lower neck extension moments at the 9, 16, and 40 kph AVs than those of the baseline seat. At the 24 kph AV, this moment was the lowest of the three seats shown in this figure. No obvious reasons have been identified for this phenomenon at the 24 kph AV. The sensitivity of the lower neck extension response to seat design changes has also been identified in our companion paper [46]. A potential cause of this sensitivity may be the phenomenon of "differential rebound" identified by modeling studies reported by Prasad et al [50] in which the torso begins to rebound from the seat back and the head lags behind the torso. The stiffer seats in general show higher shear and compressive forces in the neck, Appendix A - Table 7, than the baseline production seat. Although the levels of these forces are judged to be low enough to not cause serious neck injuries, these increased force levels may result in increased potential for nerve damage in the articular facets - a hypothesis advanced by Yang and Begeman [51]. Another dummy response that appears to be sensitive to both crash severity and seat characteristics is the peak shear force in the lumbar spine of the dummy. The shear forces developed in four of the seats tested across the entire speed range are shown in Figure 41. From this figure, it can be seen that the baseline seat has the lowest lumbar spine shear force that is maximum at 24 kph AV and slightly lower at the 40 kph AV. In sharp contrast, seat B-R, the rigid version of seat B, and seat E show substantially higher shear forces at the 9 kph AV and increase linearly as the impact severity increases. Seat F is even higher than seats B-R or E at the 9 kph AV, and approximately the same as seats B-R or E at the 40 kph AV. The significance of these highly elevated shear forces in the stiffer seats need further investigation. Tests reported by Begeman et al. [52] on spinal segments from the human cadaveric lumbar region show failures due to shear at loads as low as 1 ,200 N statically and approximately 1 ,300 N dynamically. Although some differences between the shear stiffness of the Hybrid III lumbar spine and those of the cadaveric spinal segments are noted by Begeman et al [52], such large differences in shear loads in the seats tested deserve further attention. At least, the data indicate that if stiffer seats become more dominant, a new injury mechanism to the lumbar spine may be introduced in the field that is not present with the currently, more popular, yielding seats. For the baseline seats, A and B, the dummy neck responses at the head/neck junction and at the location of the lower neck load cell, are substantially below known lARVs for velocities up to a AV of 40 kph, the 94th%ile of all rear impacts in NASS. Since the baseline seats tested represent the vast majority of seats in the United States, the test data indicate a very low probability of severe neck injuries for belted occupants, even in high severity accidents. The raw data used in Figure 2 show that only 47 out of 5,041 occupants involved in passenger car rear impacts had an AIS 3+ injury for AVs up to 40 kph, a less than 1 % rate for a AIS 3+ injury. However, all these occupants are not belted and are not in the seating position used in these tests. Therefore, the AIS 3+ injury frequency for belted occupants in the real world would be even less than the one reported above, showing that the test data reflect real world experience. Earlier discussion of the test data of stiffer and rigid seats have shown that stiffer seats lead to "higher neck and lumbar spine loadings. This in turn may lead to a higher incidence of low severity and higher severity injuries to in-position belted occupants. If an occupant is not seated normally, but is out-of-position, he will gain more energy before striking the seat back because of the increased travel distance. Because of this, a seat with a stiffer seat back, even one that performed well at the highest speed tested in this study, may present the occupant with a higher risk of severe neck injuries than a plastically, yielding seat which will absorb some of the occupant's energy as it deforms [31 ,49]. Due to the fact that some of the occupants involved in rear impact accidents are out-of-position when they are struck, this effect must be considered further. 3955</page><page sequence="22">_ 180.0-1 1 J 160.0- ^ A a 140.0 - Lower Neck ^ ^ g 120.0 - ^ ^ B 1 100.0- . 2 80.0- 'w = 40.0" £ ^ Corrected Upper Neck 2 200 ^ -■ u. ft u -8 0.0 -I 1 u.

Comparison between passenger car seat performance and light truck seat performance indicate that stiffer seats can increase the incidence of neck injuries in the real world. A series of sled tests utilizing yielding and limited yield seats also validated the relative world performance of yielding seats. Based on the results of seats tested and reported in this paper, the following conclusions can be drawn: 1 . Stiffening of conventional seats without any other modifications (seats A and B), can result in an overall increase of "whiplash" type of injuries in velocities ranging between 8 to 24 kph AVs. At higher velocity impacts, 40 kph AV, the potential for serious neck injuries is also increased, since known tolerable loads at the neck bracket location have been exceeded. 2. Stiffer seats also tend to increase lumbar and thoracic spine loads. 3. Static positioning of the head rest - higher and closer to the head - does not necessarily translate into lower neck forces and moments in dynamic tests. This is demonstrated by comparing the dynamic responses recorded in seats B and C. 4. Comparison of the dynamic responses of the Hybrid III dummy in baseline and stiffer, more recently designed seats, e.g. seats D, E, and F, show no distinct advantage of the stiffer seats over the baseline. In fact, seat D could lead to a higher incidence of serious neck injuries at 40 kph AV than the baseline seat. Although seats E and F, the stiffest production seats tested, show neck forces and moments that do not exceed known tolerance criteria for the neck, they show higher neck forces and moments in the lower neck at the 40 kph AV than those in the baseline seat. Strother et al. [31] and Benson et al. [49] have shown that neck forces and moments are higher in stiff seats than in yielding seats for out-of-position occupants. Therefore, real world concerns regarding neck injuries for out-of-position occupants exist with the stiffer seats. 5. The dummy response measure most sensitive to seat design changes and crash severity appears to be the extension moment measured at the location of the lower neck load cell. This response also appears to correlate with the Neck Injury Factor, as shown by Prasad et al. [46] in a companion paper. Further research is needed to statistically establish injury criteria for this measurement in the dummy for whiplash and serious neck injury.

APPENDIX A - DATA TABLES All the tables of dynamic Hyge sled test results include an estimate of the dynamic seat back deflection, obtained from film analysis, and the measured post-test seat back angles to indicate the relative difference in seat back stiffness between the types of seats tested. No deflection measurements were taken for rigid seat configurations. In general, the seats are ordered from lowest to highest seat back stiffness as determined by the dynamic deflection, but in Tables 4-7, B-R (the rigid configuration of seat B) which may be the stiftest seat tested, is listed second. The average peak magnitudes of the 50th% Hybrid III responses and their population standard deviations, if available, are also listed. If the ATD responses obtained with one seat were significantly higher or lower than those obtained with the baseline seat, they are highlighted with an up arrow, t, or a down arrow, I. The responses were judged to be significantly different if their ranges did not overlap. If the population standard deviation was only available for one seat, it was doubled to determine the range; if no standard deviation was given, a 25% difference from the baseline was judged to be significant. 3960</page><page sequence="27">Table 1. - Dynamic rear impact Hyge sled tests: Series 1 , AV = 9 kph.
