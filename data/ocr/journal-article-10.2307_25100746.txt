HARTMAM'S "RELIGION OF THE FUTURE.1 The earnest reader of Hartmann's latest philosophical work, " The Self-Dissolution of Christianity and the Religion of the Future," will be apt to feel that his bold and generous outline of a world religion is far from satisfying to the intellect of every thinker. According to the most rational estimate, it must be many centuries ere the simple intellectual basis of popular faith will reach any phil osophical refinement. Herr Hartmann proceeds, by the inductive method, to the conclusion that the future religion is to be a panthe istic monotheism. Undoubtedly, just this phase of religious life does already exist among the finest thinkers, among cultivated men of science, in the better class of artists, and in the mental structure of poets like Emerson and Browning, in whom emotion and thought are blended into a poetic completeness. When, however, the phi losophy of life reaches this generous expansion, when men grow into the true pantheistic faith, and believe themselves essentially divine, and participators or actual constituents of the universal being, re ligion must surely cease to be in the present understanding of the word ; for men capable of holding so grand a conviction would surely be incapable of giving formal expression to it. Can we con ceive an organization of men uniting for the propagation of such a religion, or even for its exposition among believers ? Can we con ceive of it as an external religion, in any sense, with a cultus and distinctive symbols? Lofty spirits may breathe this fine ether, may exchange thoughts upon it, and feel their lives exhilarated by the contact, but such experience would be personal and informal. As an inspiration of the human soul we can conceive nothing more powerful. The consciousness that we are indissolubly knit to the universe, nay, that we are utterly and absolutely part and parcel of that universe in all its phases, material, intellectual, and spiritual, gives a sense of claim and kinship that no other theory</page><page sequence="2">HARTMANN'S " RELIGION OF THE FUTURE. 435 could supply. It is hardly possible that such a conviction could actually find a lodgment in the brain without being converted at once into the most passionate and fervent emotion. Imagine the spiritual strength that must flow from such a conviction ! but im agine also the spiritual pride which would follow the formal avowal of such a consciousness ! Perhaps the most unfortunate feature of the Christian system is the spirit of conscious morality which it fosters. Hartmann does not suggest any means for the spreading of this religious philosophy. It has already taken on form and substance in minds of fine texture, but, until this fineness of texture becomes general, human beings will not grow into an exalted pantheism by their own developing mental needs. Could so refined a faith be put into so crude a form that common intelligence could receive it as seed dropped from other minds ? This seems to be answered by the fact that pantheism is the inherited and almost universal faith of all ranks of India ; and this is the source from which Hartmann takes the idea of immanent deity which is to be fused into a new product with the Occidental unity in the creation of the new re ligion. The European mind, however, conceives the universe as separate from the creating Deity, and this idea, both in the old and new world, has by transmission almost the power of an instinct. Es pecially the English mind, in which idealism is a minor force, would long resist the general admission of such a thought. The average American mind with its greater impressibility might take on such a creed and wear it gracefully as some new garment, but only a few would feel the full power of such a theory of life. " Pantheism," says Heine, " is the latent religion of Germany." It is not surpris ing that this discovery should be made by a poet, for all the great poets are unconfessed pantheists, i. e./in their best moods, they un consciously attain the true pantheistic identity ; and doubtless the Germans, with their strong subjective idealism and exaltation above the material, realize the poetic type of tener than others. The finest expression of poetic pantheism in modern literature is distilled from Goethe's brain in Faust's answer to Margaret. Hartmann's conception of the future religion may be further epitomized thus : The gain to the world of a pantheism uncorrupted by polytheism would be immense. The idea of absolute unity is saved, and the abandonment of the personality of God makes it im possible for man to conceive of himself as outside of Deity. Man</page><page sequence="3">436 THE NORTH AMERICAN BEVIEW. is an expression of essential being, a manifestation of the divine reality. Brahmanism has avoided the fatal mistake of Catholic and Protestant philosophy, by assuming an impersonal deity in three modes of manifestation, while Christian thinkers have played around the logical contradiction of one personality in three equal persons for fifteen hundred years. We must utterly break with the idea of a personal God, and accept that of one impersonal essence behind all phenomena. This impersonal Being pervades the whole world of matter and man ; the whole world is indeed a manifestation of this impersonal power. This cuts away for ever every root of poly theism and of anthropomorphism. The God made in the image of man with power to create and destroy by a personal will is for ever lost, and men gain a positive, scientific basis for the brotherhood of man and for the unity of human interests. This result, however, which Hartmann reaches by labored philosophic processes, is the same which has existed in Christ and others as feeling. The crude philosophy of Judaism and Christianity has given birth to a most exalted emotional experience. It is nearly certain that Christ did not think of the brotherhood of humanity as in himself in the usual interpretation, but that he dreamed of the diffusion among men of the fervent consciousness of love, good will, and aspiration which he felt. Religions have a psychological and a material expression. Their psychological phase is the bundle of intellectual convictions (exist ing as thought and coined into language), together with the emotions which spring from them. Emotion grows out of thought as plants out of the soil ; and emotions founded on intuition are the most intense. In families in which successive generations have been im pregnated with moral enthusiasm, morality becomes automatic and conscious effort ceases. Morality is then thoroughly artistic and admirable. The material expressions of religion are the external objects and practices used for perpetuating it, as temples, services, missions, and literatures. Geographically this philosophical scheme is made to cover the whole earth ; but Hartmann draws no chronological lines. Mono theistic pantheism may come soon or in the far future, but it is sure to come. In him it is already fulfilled in the form of a lofty intel lectual life, and if dignity, kindliness, and candor of voice and man ner are true indices of character, it is also fulfilled in his affectional and spiritual life. But has he not conveyed his ardent subjective life into the objective world more fully than he ought ? We long</page><page sequence="4">HARTMANN'S " RELIGION OF THE FUTURE." 437 for the invention of those delicate scales which shall weigh for us all psychological and historic forces with scientific nicety. But where are we to look for this discovery if not to inductive philosophy ? But the brain which shall find out this new metric system must itself be of the finest. At present, the widest possible survey of facts authorizes no positively unalterable conclusion. " Protestant ism," says Hartmann, " is the grave-digger of Christianity." But Christianity stoutly refuses to be buried alive, and countless data show that it is vigorously active : its blood circulates ; its pulse is beating ; its historic force is not spent ; it has still a long lease of life. Science and modern culture may take possession of all the finer minds, but the fine minds are in a minority. Nature perpetu ates her coarse forms as surely as her complex ones, and in greater multiplicity. It will take a long time to wear out the strength of modern spiritualism. Judaism can not disappear for many a cen tury yet. Are there any reasons for concluding that Mohammedan ism, Brahmanism, Buddhism, and Confucianism will be less tena cious of life ? The trees of the forest stand together?pines, oaks, and hemlocks?in democratic fraternity. Diversity is the necessity of organic life. May it not be equally the necessity of intellect and soul ? We are not wise enough with all our data to foresee a uni versal religion ; we are not wise enough to deny the possibility of such a universal religion ; but we are wise enough to see that the present diversity of faith must continue for many centuries, and generous enough to believe that such continuance will not be an unmitigated evil.
