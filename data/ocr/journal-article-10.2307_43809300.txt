<plain_text><page sequence="1">JOHN BERGER'S "WHY LOOK AT ANIMALS?": A CLOSE READING Jonathan Burt Abstract This article is a close reading of John Berger's highly influential essay "Why look at animals?" and its implications for thinking about animals in modernity. Berger analyses the alienation of human and animal as a consequence of nineteenth-cen- tury capitalism, and contrasts it with an earlier period when human-animal rela- tions were more integrated. Despite the power and simplicity of Berger's argument, which has been taken up uncritically by a number of writers, both his historical analysis and his conception of human-animal relations in modernity are highly prob- lematic and need substantial revision. Furthermore, the consequences of his thesis paradoxically reinforce the very processes he is criticising. Inadequate notions of the place of animals in public visual culture, and a more general bias against visual imagery in favour of text-based notions of the animal, create obstacles to theorising human-animal relations and welfare related issues in the contemporary world. The article suggests other perspectives for understanding what it means to look at animals. Keywords'. Berger, zoos, visual culture, killing, animals Introduction A cocadrille comes from a cock's egg hatched in a dung heap. As soon as it comes out of its egg, it makes its way to the most unlikely place. If it is seen by somebody it has not seen, it dies. Otherwise, it can defend itself and kill anything it chooses except the weasel. The poi- son, with which it kills, comes from its eyes and travels along its gaze. (Berger 1979: 107) John Berger's extraordinarily influential essay, "Why look at ani- mals?" (Berger 1980) is something of a puzzle. It is a powerfully expressed critique of the marginalisation of animals in capitalism, and yet is questionable and over-simplifying in its historical claims. The historical trajectory it outlines of the disappearance of animals and their replacement by signs, and the manner in which humans and animals are increasingly alienated in modernity, provides a pes- simistic vision with which is hard to argue. High profile examples of species eradication, the large-scale killing of animals for all man- ner of reasons, and the confined conditions for many captive animals Â© Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, 2005 Worldviews 9,2 203-218 Also available online - www.brill.nl</page><page sequence="2">204 JONATHAN BURT seem to support Berger's argument at a general level. The rhetoric of the text also raises questions about the degree to which histories of human-animal relations can be outlined in terms that cannot but invoke, in some form or other, issues of animal ethics (whether in favour of such ethics, or against them). At another level, "Why Look at Animals?" appears to be something of a double text (aside from the way in which it is polarised through and through by all man- ner of binary oppositions). For instance, despite his critique of ani- mal imagery, the text gains from Berger's use of pictorial illustrations of animals in captivity. However, the idea that animal imagery is itself fluid and ambiguous appears lost in the fervour of Berger's stance against imagery. If some of Berger's historical claims are questionable, as I shall suggest below, then the more general picture he depicts should begin to unravel. However, the disjunctions in Berger's thesis do not seem to undermine the overall claims he makes about the subjection and manipulation of the lives of animals. The different strands that make up the text are bound together and made coherent by his polemic. The factual history of human-animal relations is interwoven with a more hypothetical, quasi-mythical view of human-animal relations (where animals are "magical", "oracular", "sacrificial"), relations that Berger valorises over their modern counterparts. This has the strange effect of implying that the alienation and marginalisation of animals take place within a historically defined context whilst the period of integrated relations between humans and animals is timeless, and by implication beyond historical investigation. It is not, however, as easy as it seems to dismiss Berger's essay as a simplistic romanticisation of the non-capitalist relations of the past over the capitalist present, although that is certainly something he does. This is in part because the text raises intriguing questions about what it is to write about animals and the kinds of consequences that follow from seeing animals in symbolic terms (animals as signs, metaphors and so on), which, as we shall see shordy, Berger often does. Writing about animals as symbols does make it easier to map animals onto the human domain. However, we should be careful not to collapse the kinds of analyses used to understand human- human relationships onto human-animal relations. The latter are constituted on the very edges of the possibility of inter-species com- munication, constantly marked by death and killing, as well as the manipulation and hybridisation of the animal body. Analyses of</page><page sequence="3">JOHN BERGER'S "WHY LOOK AT ANIMALS?" 205 human-animal relations need to take account of their dark opacity, their boundary breaking, and the suspension of the normal codes of conduct by which humans tend to treat each other. How is that to be embodied textually? Taking this argument a little further, how is the animal textualised in Berger and how does his essay negotiate the tensions between questions about looking and visual imagery, and the animal as a lin- guistic sign? In other words, how is the animal constituted by Berger, what do we see when we look at this particular text, where does the focus on animal symbolism leave the practical, experiential and institutional dimensions of human-animal relations, and above all, what is this text? In the detailed reading of Berger's text that fol- lows I will answer these questions, in part because they highlight a number of significant issues around what it is to write about the problematic nature of human-animal relations in modernity. More importantly, a number of blind spots and theoretical lacunae arise in the text; these derive, paradoxically, from not being able to answer the question posed by the title. 1. Reading Berger's text So, what do we see when we first confront the text? Beneath the opening question of the essay is a dedication to the artist, Gilles Aillaud, and then a picture of an elephant at a zoo, giving children a ride and led by its keeper. In a description of Aillaud's work for an exhibition of zoo pictures at the ICA London in 1982, Berger wrote that such pictures were neither a protest against animals in zoos, nor were they anthropomorphic figures or allegories of the human condition. The animals in the cages are there for exactly what they are, no more and no less . . . Aillaud's purpose is not to lead the guilty spectator to a scene of historical crimes. Rather it is to return the spectator to what is still visible, with its ravaged present and its still evident traces of a lost unity, to the visible that contains, but does not in itself recog- nise, tragedy. (Barzdo et al. 1982: 26-27)1 For Berger the real desolation of the pictures is not contained in them but is what stands in front of them: man. Interestingly, in the light of his critique of imagery, Berger manages to void these particular</page><page sequence="4">206 JONATHAN BURT images of connotation, tension, or meaning, thus reducing their sta- tus as images by making them as close to "reality" as possible. He effectively removes these illustrations from his anti-imagist position. The opening lines of the argument then spell out a position that could not be more forcefully put. The nineteenth century begins a process completed by twentieth-century corporate capitalism "by which every tradition which has previously mediated between man and nature was broken." Prior to that, animals had been "with man at the centre of his world" (Berger 1980: 1). Unpacking this open- ing would require a whole study in itself. The terminology and phras- ing - "every tradition", "look at", "animals", "man" - are, for a start, dense with implication, opening up a chain of philosophical conno- tations which should be, but never are, placed under interrogation; most significantly the word "animal". The clumsiness of the chronol- ogy (nineteenth century/twentieth century) implies a history that, with the repeated mention of the term "nineteenth century" as the origin of the rupture, only comes into play in 1800. This periodis- ation still continues in recent writing. "The modern animal ... is the nineteenth century animal (symbolic, sentimental), which has been made to disappear", writes Steve Baker in The Postmodern Animal (Baker 2000: 22). Berger is writing a specific history that postulates a rupture between a time of unity and a time of mutual alienation. This is not, therefore, a history of the treatment of animals as such, much less is it a history of seeing. Otherwise, worthy of attention would be the rise of animal experimentation in the seventeenth cen- tury, and the natural histories of the eighteenth century, which rep- resent radical changes in the observation of, and relation of humans to, animal bodies. At one level it is easy to criticise Berger for this periodisation; it is an easy target. But it has all manner of implications not least of which is a historical partiality that determines how the text con- structs the animal. The question of the title is already impossible to answer from the opening lines of the essay. The "because" with which any "why" should normally be answered is already redun- dant: animals and humans are now too alienated for the look to register anything of consequence beyond exemplifying their degree of alienation. If we were to proffer an answer such as "because we need to re-evaluate human-animal relations by paying attention to the contexts in which we look at animals", or "because we need a considered and attentive looking to appreciate the animal world</page><page sequence="5">JOHN BERGER'S "WHY LOOK AT ANIMALS?" 207 more", Berger would probably answer, "too late." The nature of modernity renders this impossible. Furthermore, looking here is more than simply seeing. It is a word resonant of the dialectics of the gaze as found in the writings of Sartre, LÃ©vinas, and Lacan. One cannot have the idea of looking without the idea of being looked at in turn and, in the instance of humans and animals, this possibility is irre- trievably ruptured. This is both a strength and a weakness in Berger's argument. It is a strength because the look exemplifies the relations between humans and animals; it is an active component in the estab- lishment of relations and not simply a matter of passive seeing or straightforward objectification. On the other hand, Berger's look is singularly conceived and thus limited to a single instant rather than understood as something that might be developed over time. The word used is "look" and not "looks" and this singularity is reinforced by a constant refrain of isolation. "Looking at each animal, the unac- companied zoo visitor is alone" (Berger 1980: 26); "the urban stranger" (5); "the loneliness of man as a species" (4). This solitude is not a condition of man as a social being but man as a being in the world of animals. 2. Linguistic animals and visual animals The problem that arises is not just to do with alienation, but is at a deeper level, whereby the look is modelled on an idea of linguis- tic exchange. At one level, conceived dialectically, it is the manner in which the look is exchanged that determines the relation between man and animal. This is ruled out by the world of capitalism; answers are not returned to the human eye. But at another level, Berger produces a second dead end for any further positive possibilities that may be gained from looking. In the period prior to the nineteenth century, he argues, animals are, in addition to their uses as human resources, mapped onto a language of signs. They are "messengers", "promises", the "first metaphor", the "first symbols", they "offered explanations". And Berger's terminology shifts quite precisely because then, when the animals begin to be marginalised and disappear, to be replaced by spectacle and other forms of substitution such as toys and illustrations, they become images and their linguistic connotations disappear. This is how I would describe the main rupture of the nineteenth century as determined by the overall historical perspective</page><page sequence="6">208 JONATHAN BURT of Berger's thesis: the linguistic animal is replaced by the visual ani- mal. It is because animals have stopped replying (with their look), their part of the conversation if you like, that the companionship has broken down. The thrust of the essay, which appears to be so much on the side of animals, then becomes less concerned with the welfare of animals and their mistreatment under capitalism, and much more focussed on shifts in the psychology of man's self- confirmation as a being in the world. What is lost through the rup- ture is a link between humans and animals that on closer analysis appears to be, like any symbol or sign, highly arbitrary. What is at stake for Berger in the act of exchange is not neces- sarily understanding but recognition. Berger follows the traditional dividing line whereby man is a linguistic animal and animals are not. The main significance of language is confirmation and not nec- essarily mutual understanding. "Language allows men to reckon with each other as with themselves". (Berger 1980: 3). A complicated argu- ment then follows to establish how animals are situated in relation to this, because in the pre-rupture relationship between human and animal, "no animal confirms man, either positively or negatively" (1980: 3). The argument maintains that animals can be hunted and eaten, or tamed by the peasant as a resource, but their lack of a language marks them as irreducibly different from man. The only thing animals share with man is death. Yet in spite of this, and for no particular reason beyond the fact of a mutual existence, the par- allel lives of humans and animals offer a companionship. Note again that the killing of animals is not in itself problematic, providing it is done in a world in which an intimacy exists between man and animal. This is good killing and is contrasted with the attitude of modern alienated man: A peasant becomes fond of his pig and is glad to salt away its pork. What is significant, and is so difficult for the urban stranger to under- stand, is that the two animals in that sentence are connected by an and and not by a but. (5) The italicised and is used previously in the text to make a similar point that a species could be seen as magical and used for food. A whole series of problems follow from this, which increasingly confirm the suspicion that this text has a working ideal of human- animal relations that ultimately benefits man to the detriment of animals. In fact, it is the use of terms like man, the outdoors, com-</page><page sequence="7">JOHN BERGER'S "WHY LOOK AT ANIMALS?" 209 panionship, familiarity and recognition that highlight the many binary oppositions that tacitly structure the text. After the rupture, these terms may be counterposed to the domestic, family, interiority, soli- tude, and children. The period of alienation is marked by infantili- sation, the "withdrawal into the private small family unit"; the masculine realms of the peasant, the hunter, and the warrior are thus displaced. The warrior epic of Homer (Berger 1980: 7-8) is counterposed to Disney's Donald Duck (13-14). This shift is sum- marised memorably by the idea that animals "have been co-opted into the family and into the spectacle " (13). With the exception of pets, which I will discuss shortly, the imagery that Berger discusses as symbolising the condition of the modern animal are all examples related to children: Beatrix Potter books, Disney cartoons, stuffed toys, the rocking horse ("a nineteenth-century invention" (20)). Even the visit to the zoo is familial, the familiarity of the human-animal look has come to be replaced by the family look: "the family visit to the zoo is often a more sentimental occasion" (21). Such visits are about the recovery of loss, "re-finding some of the innocence of that reproduced animal world which they remember from their own childhood" (21). There are many layers of loss evoked here, from the fakery of childhood toys to the captive animals that are "less than I believed" (21). The zoo is thus the climactic figure, the "liv- ing monument" for loss. The whole essay now begins to turn full circle not from the opening thesis about alienation but from the opening figures of the text: question, dedication, and an image of children riding on an elephant. The narrative of regression moves from the world of man to the world of children. The world of women, incidentally, appears to have little to do with animals. However, the relations between human and animal are subordinate to the greater dominance of humans by the capitalist system. Pets, as completely controlled animals, "are creatures of their owners' way of life" (Berger 1980: 12). This is ironic because the relation of pet to owner is not one of a parallel co-exis- tence - outlined as an ideal earlier - but is much more integrated. It is one of mutual completion, no matter how artificial and forced the relationship. Note the language here: The pet completes him [the owner, male], offering responses to aspects of his character which would otherwise remain unconfirmed. He can be to his pet what he is not to anybody or anything else . . . since in</page><page sequence="8">2 1 0 JONATHAN BURT this relationship the autonomy of both parties has been lost . . . the parallelism of their separate lives has been destroyed. (12-13) This completely inverts the relationship of the peasant or the African tribesman to animals. The parallelism of the latter relationships was in effect a connection without connection. Indeed, it is merely the arbitrary connection of the and that binds the symbolic and the sac- rificial (2). In other words, this is a totally human-centred outlook that alludes rather to the idea of the sacrificial origin of signification than the animal metaphor origin of signification (5). The killing of animals is integrally wrapped up both with their signification in lan- guage and with the ways in which humans define their own special status. Cary Wolfe notes how the discourse of speciesism, the symbolic system that rigidly separates human and animal, enables and indeed requires sacrifice. The institution of speciesism is fundamental to the formation of Western subjectivity and sociality as such, an insti- tution that relies on the tacit agreement that the full transcendence of the "human" requires the sacrifice of the "animal" and the animalis- tic, which in turn makes possible a symbolic economy in which we can engage in what Derrida will call a "noncriminal putting to death" of other humans as well by marking them as animal. (Wolfe 2003: 6) The historical basis of the origin of signification, whether rooted in sacrifice or the naming of animals, is lost in an arbitrariness that mirrors the arbitrariness of the sign itself as described in semiotics. As Berger writes, "all theories of ultimate origin are only ways of better defining what followed" (Berger 1980: 6). The circularity of this idea reinforces the sense that a logic derived from semiotics con- structs the animal in Berger's integrated pre-modern world. Ironically, it is in modernity that the fact of killing or sacrifice becomes an issue of tension and is placed under interrogation. One consequence of this is that we cannot look back to Berger's pre-modern version of human-animal relations as a possible alternative to alienation and disappearance, because it is a modern discourse of animal welfare and rights that challenges the necessity of sacrifice and killing. In petkeeping, a different sort of contact is achieved and yet is immediately undermined not so much by something intrinsic to the link between human and animal but something extrinsic: the social system that dominates and curtails all living beings whether human or animal. The rupture then seems to indicate something adi the more poignant: that the point at which human and animal come</page><page sequence="9">JOHN BERGER'S "WHY LOOK AT ANIMALS?" 2 1 1 together is effectively at the death of human-animal relations. So petkeeping is, by implication, another monument to loss. However, in this instance unlike the zoo, it does not point back to older rela- tions between man and animad but indicates a different sort of rela- tionship entirely. Pets can still be killed, or "put down", but they are not generally eaten; at least, not in the capitalist West. So is petkeeping then also a monument to the disappearance of a sacrificial logic? And is the essential paradox of Berger's essay the fact that it fails to see, in the replacement of the symbol by the image, the pos- sibility of the end of relations based on sacrifice? Paradoxically, the sheer uselessness of the pet may be its saving grace. The first appearance of "Why look at animals?" was as three sep- arate articles published in New Society in March and April 1977. The disjointed feel of the essay, which is structured round discrete sec- tions, is partly accounted for by its original format. The three orig- inal articles were entitled "Animals as Metaphor", "Vanishing Animals", and "Why Zoos Disappoint?" (Berger 1977a-c). "Why look at ani- mals?" is not a question integral to the earlier pieces. However, there are only two significant differences between the New Society pieces and the later version. First, a pleasingly symmetrical difference in that it is the tide (and dedication) and the last sentence of the essay that are new; "this historic loss, to which zoos are a monument, is now irredeemable for the culture of capitalism" (Berger 1980: 26). The second difference lies in the use of visual imagery. In the orig- inal three essays the images are purely illustrative of various points made. Thus, there are images of battery chickens, Mickey Mouse, a stuffed teddy bear, and a dodo amongst others. However, the final text is more interestingly illustrated. It contains a Grandville engrav- ing from his Public and Private Life of Animals of humans with animal or fish heads sitting round a table to eat, and four pictures of ani- mals in zoos. The zoo pictures reinforce the sense that the zoo binds every strand of Berger's conception of the plight of animals under capitalism into one figure: captivity and control, disappearance, and the impossibility of answering the look. The figure of the coyote or wild dog lying on the floor of a bare cage amongst a pile of faeces and urine summarises Berger's point perfecdy. More ambivalent, and echoing the Grandville image, is a highly anthromorphised portrait of the head of a sea lion, as it rises out of the water and looks directly at the camera.</page><page sequence="10">2 1 2 JONATHAN BURT I mentioned earlier that the opening image of the children on the elephant ride and the final discussion of the zoo give the text a cir- cular feel. The overall picture depicts the zoo as containing the final remnants of the disappearing animal, with the images, toys, and pets as the remainder. And the relationship of zoo animals to vision is doubly problematic, both as an inappropriate and diminished spec- tacle, and as creatures that do not or cannot return the look. In a sense Berger's thesis also remains captive to this figure of the zoo. In its overall pessimism there is no route of escape from the condi- tions set by capitalism on human-animal relations. Furthermore, because its anti-visual consequences and suspicion of spectacle are derived largely from the idea of zoo display there is an over-empha- sis on an institution which is far from having its roots in moder- nity.2 There is an element of anachronism in this because although there are indeed changes in the visual status of animals in moder- nity, as I shall discuss below, it is not clear that the zoo best rep- resents those changes. Turning to the changing status of the animal in the nineteenth century another perspective can be found. There is a significant shift in the visual status of the animal as it becomes the focus of welfare concerns and legislation from the 1820s onwards in Britain (Burt 2002: 33-37; Kean 1998: 39-69). This is not, as Berger would have it, a shift from an integrated relationship to an alienated one between human and animal, but rather reflects the beginning of the institu- tionalisation of animal-centred issues. No longer is the welfare of animals restricted to the concerns of individual writers, as it had been prior to this period, but it is given an organisational dimen- sion. Alongside government legislation on animal welfare, numerous societies were founded in the nineteenth century including the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, the Vegetarian Society, the Our Dumb Friends' League, the British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection, the Humane Slaughter Association, the Anti-Plumage League which was transformed into the Society for the Protection of Birds, and a host of others. There is, admittedly, a tension in the motivations for codifying the humane treatment of animals. On the one hand, these issues are related to broader considerations of social control, the fear that the barbaric treatment of animals would indi- cate and encourage a greater disorder particularly amongst the lower classes. On the other hand, they arose, for many, out of a direct concern for the mistreatment of animals as an issue in its own right.</page><page sequence="11">JOHN BERGER'S "WHY LOOK AT ANIMALS?" 213 As the discourse of animal welfare and rights is given increasing expression in the nineteenth century it is also the case that the sta- tus of the animal in public visual culture undergoes a change and the two are to some extent connected. Animals needed to be seen to be treated correctly which was an important and measurable crite- rion of welfare and an index of what it was to be a visibly civilised society. It was also increasingly the case that those practices involv- ing animal death, most notably slaughter and scientific experiment, became less and less visible in the public domain. The loss in human- animal relations in the nineteenth century is primarily the margin- alisation of animal death rather than animal disappearance per se. Because of this, images and spectacle become crucial in keeping ani- mal questions in play. In fact, animal welfare politics has been highly dependent on illustrations, photographs and film for the power of its message and its success (Burt 2002: 168ff; Donald 1999).3 The interplay between visibility and invisibility, or imagery and the ani- mal body, are therefore much more problematically aligned in rela- tion to welfare and killing. It is worth noting that Berger's thesis has rarely been challenged, its terms rarely treated critically, and it is still of influence even today, to the point of repeating the problematic consequences of its anti- visual position. Randy Malamud's recent critique of zoos, appropri- ately entitled Reading Â£oos, is a good example of this. An unremittingly negative outlook leads not just to a pessimistic conclusion but a total disengagement from the very demanding challenges facing conser- vation funding and public interest, captive populations and species survival.4 At one level Malamud's argument is very direct: zoos are corrupt and immoral in their imprisonment of animals and their per- version of the natural. Thus there are absolutely no grounds to jus- tify their existence. The problem arises not so much with this anti-zoo diatribe as such, but with how Malamud works his argument out through the valorisation of a certain kind of representation: the tex- tual. In reaction to the zoo experience he celebrates the imaginary over the "real" by setting up a hierarchy of acceptable and unac- ceptable forms of spectacle and imagery. The most acceptable are, paradoxically, those at furthest remove from seeing the animal, although Malamud argues that the contents of the zoo are them- selves unreal anyway; they are "culturally inauthentic". This also implicidy assumes the possibility of being able to look at animals beyond the filters of any cultural construction. On a visit to the zoo</page><page sequence="12">214 JONATHAN BURT one would "not see what I consider to be a real giraffe, but rather a cultural stylisation, simplification, distillation, of a giraffe; a sam- ple of giraffe; a (stinted) representation of a giraffe" (Malamud 1998: 29). By contrast "one can understand and respect something without seeing it. One can imagine a giraffe; one can read about a giraffe." (Malamud 1998: 32). This valorisation of reading over seeing also makes reading a morally superior act, and for Malamud, it is through the textual domain that the zoo can be most undermined and threat- ened, its hypocrisies and inconsistencies exposed: "My anthropo- morphically indulgent humanism inclines me to believe that Virginia Woolf, John Galsworthy and company can probably teach us much more about people and animals . . . than zoos." (Malamud 1998: 39). It seems to me that the important question here is not about the pros and cons raised by supporters and critics of zoos but how these criticisms become limited by the symbolic frameworks they choose to valorise. Malamud's emphasis on the zoo as a representation of human failings in fact marginalises questions to do with animals per se and makes the zoo debate an inward and, to some extent, a back- ward looking one. When it comes to the challenge of conservation, what one might count as some of the real problems facing humans and animals, Malamud fulfils the logic set up by his position in an extraordinary statement: a species so tenuously dependent on the kind of human intervention that the zoo provides should perhaps die out - a horrible eventuality, certainly, but the perversely appropriate consequence of the indigni- ties people have wreaked on our planet. (Malamud 1998: 45) Although it could be argued that Malamud's valorisation of fiction might seem at odds with Berger's notion of the substitution of real animals by images, both writers reflect the weakness of a thesis that depends so heavily on a linguistic/textual notion of the symbolic ani- mal. Being drawn to the spectacle of captivity as their main point of focus rather than, say, the spectacle of slaughter, they are drawn to what is still visible rather than directly challenging what has in fact become invisible. As Malamud's "perversely appropriate consequence" reveals, this way of thinking only reinforces, rather than challenges, the process of marginalisation that modernity has set in train. It appears that there is no intrinsic reason why the two main weaknesses of this structure of argument - the combination of val- orising the linguistic animal over the visible animal and the failure</page><page sequence="13">JOHN BERGER'S "WHY LOOK AT ANIMALS?" 215 to address animal killing - should be connected. Berger's terminol- ogy stresses "disappearance" and not death. The alienation and mar- ginalisation that shifts the structure of human-animal relations is what is centrally at stake. Yet the strand that links the linguistic animal with the effacement of death recurs in a variety of contexts. In Akira LippiÅ¥s Electric Animal , which follows Berger's thesis on disappear- ance and the rise of forms of substitution - especially cinema - the death of the animal is denied. For Lippit the disappearance of the animal is its fundamental condition in modernity; a period in which the animal becomes a spectre or phantasm as it shifts "from a body to an image; from a living voice to a technical echo" (Lippit 2000: 21). In a text much concerned with disappearance and extinction, Lippit's text is haunted not so much by the death of animals but by their ghosts. He notes a paradox around the idea of animal death. Since animals are denied the faculties of language, they remain inca- pable of reflection, which is bound by finitude, and carries with it an awareness of death. Undying, animals simply expire, transpire, shift their animus to other animal bodies. Of the complete absence of death among animals, Bataille asserts: "not only do animals not have this consciousness [of death], they can't even recognise the difference between the fellow creature that is dead and the one that is alive." (Lippit 2000: 187) The idea of the animal that does not die, yet haunts the world through imagery, is specifically textual: "in the philosophical world, the figure of the animal moves undying from one corpus to another, one text to another" (Lippit 2000: 54). This echoes the idea that death amongst animals is not individualised but part of a natural cycle of renewal. Death only matters when species themselves come under threat. Berger reflects this in a poem, entitled "They are the last", where he laments not so much the death of the animal but the loss of their constant existence as a cycle of birth and death, "Once flies and crows/When devouring the dead sheep/began with their eyes./Yet the ewe/had already lambed/her permanence." (Barzdo et al. 1982: 11). In Berger's fictional writing on peasants, especially in the collec- tion of stories entitled Pig Earthy which were written between 1974 and 1978, the world of animals is central to the economic life of humans. This extends to the bonds and seasonal rhythms of the community. In "The Wind Howls Too", the annual killing of the pig is celebrated with a dinner that brings the neighbours together</page><page sequence="14">2 1 6 JONATHAN BURT to finish what remains of the previous year's pig. The descriptions of slaughter, much as they are part and parcel of agricultural life, are described in highly aestheticised, almost picturesque, terms: the son cuts by the throat and the blood floods out on to the floor. For a moment it takes the form of an enormous velvet skirt, whose tiny waist band is the lip of the wound . . . underneath the livers on the concrete floor are spots of bright vermilion blood, the colour of poppies when they first blossom. (Berger 1979: 2) Bruce Robbins has written that the unpleasant and unsetding image of this scene avoids the possibility of pastoral simplification. Yet I would claim that there is a luxuriance and a vivid pictorial quality to the writing that seems at odds with this criticism. However, Robbins goes on to note that Berger is attempting to broaden the notion of a peasant into something much more universal via the experience of killing. Since it is a universal truth that homo sapiens kill animals, the human- ist can always use the killing of animals in order to slip the reader past the actual diversity of historical men and women to the putative species-being of a universal "Man". (Robbins 1982-3: 292) One can see how this links up with other animal themes in Berger's thinking. The more "real" or less "alienated" experience of animals is marked by direct contact with their lives, but also authenticated by witnessing their death. Berger critiques the growth of spectacle in capitalism in other con- texts too. In his "Uses of Photography (for Susan Sontag)" he reminds us that this is part of a general project that combines politics and aesthetics (Berger 1980: 48-63). This is a general critique of the image in capitalism, of which the visual animal is only one symp- tom of negativity amongst many. In his comments on Bacon's paint- ings Berger pursues the theme of the isolation of the human species. Noting how the portraits of friends, or a Pope, in glass cases remind him of those in which animal behaviour patterns can be studied, he sees the human figure as an unhappy ape but one in ignorance of his unhappiness. Berger sees Bacon's paintings as stuck in a resigned view of the human condition, hence the lack of any thematic devel- opment in his life's work (Berger 1980: 114-116). Refusal and hope are pointless. Bacon's paintings offer no comment on the experience of loneliness, nor on social relations,- industrial society, or the his- tory of the twentieth century. This critique echoes precisely the hope-</page><page sequence="15">JOHN BERGER'S "WHY LOOK AT ANIMALS?" 217 less pessimism and inattention to similar sorts of historical detail that mark "Why look at animals?" Conclusion Nonetheless, Berger's essay is worth reading and looking at. By lock- ing the status of animals into the broader problems humans face within industrial capitalism it reminds us that human and animal fates are linked. Furthermore, rather than simply seeing animals as a figure of our plight, the mirror of the animad reflects nothing back: no answer, no solutions. This, then, is a philosophical endpoint that now demands that we seek solutions. Paradoxically, the way to an answer is shown by the tide, which directs us to the visual animal as key to recovering the animal in modernity. Why? Look at animals. Jonathan Burt, Ferry House, Bottisham Lock, Waterbeach, Cambs CB5 9LN, U.K. Notes 1. Gilles Aillaud was born in 1928. He studied philosophy as a young man and began working as a painter in the 1950s. The portrayed of animals in zoos has been a centrad feature of his work. 2. For an extensive world wide review of pre-nineteenth century zoos, see Loisel (1912). 3. The importance of film in bringing the non-visible to attention, including slaughter and animal cruelty, is also reflected in the film Parting Shots from Animals (BBC, 1980, dir. Michael Dibb, Christopher Rawlence) which follows Berger's thesis. 4. It is possible to take account of the problems with zoos without resigning one- self to complete pessimism. "There are stories strange and wonderful in the history of zoos, but perhaps their most extraordinary days are just unfolding. As an ever more ecologically hazardous future unfolds, our society needs institutions that can not only remind people of what losses are risked by reckless actions, but can also inspire compassion for other animals and reveal ways to live in better harmony with nature."
