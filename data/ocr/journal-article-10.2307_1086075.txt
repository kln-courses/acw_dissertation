<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE GODS OF HOMER G. M. A. GRUBE HE problem of the Homeric gods is how to reconcile "the cosmic gods and the comic gods."' The great Olympians often behave in a manner which is both frivolous and, in the widest sense, immoral;2 yet they are the mighty powers which rule the universe and largely control the destiny of men. As such they inspire genuine religious feelings. Their irresponsible ways were con- demned by Heraclitus and Xenophanes and have puzzled commen- tators ever since. In the light of later religious feelings, the gods of Homer present an insoluble paradox. Modern scholars have for the most part not attempted to reconcile these incompatible aspects of the gods. Many have taken them to represent different religious or irreligious phases of thought perhaps centuries apart; such differences are then used as but another instru- ment to dissect the Homeric poems.3 Others have suggested that to Homer and his audience mythology had nothing to do with religion; sometimes they depict Homer, rather surprisingly, as both a sceptic and a religious reformer.4 Others again have found in the epics two quite separate religions: that of the characters and that of the poet.6 Attempts have also been made to explain the inconsistencies by the convenient theory that Homer's mind was so primitive that glaringly incompatible ideas could dwell in it at the same time." Not one of these theories is convincing. If the Iliad is to be carved up, differences of belief are far too uncertain and too entangled to lead to a clean operation; nor is there any agreement among the surgeons as to what is early and what late, or indeed when is early, when late. Homer was a poet, not a theologian, and passages that are not logically consistent may well be by the same hand-even theologians are not always logical; but to regard mythology and re- ligion as completely separate is against the whole spirit of the poems, they are in any case too closely enmeshed. Nor do I believe that Homer had a primitive mind. He may well be blind to implied contradictions which will become explicit in the light of later thought, but that is quite another story. Finally, those who seek to differentiate the religion of the poet from that of the characters overemphasize certain expressions and ignore a good deal; no such two religions would ever strike a reader who was not looking for them. 62</page><page sequence="2">THE GODS OF HOMER 63 Let us rather re-examine the deeper question: is there any real incompatibility; are the gods not the same gods throughout, and such as we might well expect them to be at the stage of development Homer represents? To find an answer it is necessary to clear from our minds the associations of the corresponding modern words, and also the associations which the Greek words themselves acquired in later times. The gods of Homer may help to explain the gods of Plato, but the gods of Plato can only hinder our search for the gods of Homer. More surprisingly, we must clear from our minds also the more primitive notions that seem to emerge from the archaeological evidence of pre- Homeric times, even though many earlier practices survived long after- wards; it has long been recognized that Homer is, in matters of religion, peculiar and unique.7 It will be possible here only to indicate the lines along which the solution can be found; we shall largely restrict ourselves to the great Olympians, for they are the main difficulty. What are these gods? The Homeric gods are immortal, and they are powerful. The greatest of them live as a family on Olympus, with Zeus as the father of the family or clan.8 They are not creators, but have wrested the divine powers from an earlier generation. These older gods are now relegated to Tartarus, and have little dramatic or religious significance. The present generation is solidly established and their collective power is absolute. They have the capacity to see everything and to know everything when they care to use it, when their attention is engaged.9 There are no other powers beyond or behind but only below them. Where Homer uses more abstract terms such as Fate-Moira, Aisa and the like-they are but another way of referring to the power of the gods, or else they represent subordinate functions.'0 Twice Zeus gets out his golden scales to weigh the fate of heroes, once that of the Trojans and Achaeans generally (II. 8.66-67), once that of Hector and Achilles in particular (II. 22.209-214); in both cases the decisions are already taken, known both to Zeus and to us. The scales are but the concrete symbol of a decision and, like an oath, make it irrevocable, so that even Apollo abandons Hector after the weighing, and in the former instance the gods are all on Olympus by order of Zeus, where they stay for a while at least. Consecrated by the scales, the decision must be accepted. There is no hint in these passages of any other power over Zeus. The jars of Zeus, from which he distributes good and evil to mankind in any way he pleases, are of the same kind (II. 24.527-533). The name of Zeus, as that of the greatest god, is often used as equivalent to the power of the gods in general. No other name is so</page><page sequence="3">64 THE PHOENIX used, though that collective power can also be referred to in more general terms as "the gods" or "a god." This is mostly because indi- vidual men, unlike the poet who is inspired by the Muses, have no special knowledge of what particular god is responsible. Such usages therefore occur mostly in reported speech." Zeus' power is also supreme within the divine family, but it is not uncontested. There have been rebellions in the past, and one of these has given Thetis a claim on Zeus which he so fatefully recognizes in honouring Achilles. Rebellion is still possible, as Hera says to Poseidon who recoils from the suggestion (II. 8.202). Though Hera does not really believe such rebellion would be successful, she points out that Zeus would have a poor sort of life on Olympus all by himself. She is the privileged consort, but Zeus himself admits that, if Poseidon rebels, it will be a hard fight, and Poseidon yields only on condition that the agreed destruction of Troy shall finally take place; if Zeus goes back on that, there will be war in heaven (II. 15.113-141). So the divine father has to respect the traditional give and take among the gods, as is natural in any family, even though he has the ultimate power. When, after the duel of Paris and Menelaus, Zeus suggests that they might now stop the war altogether, he does not really mean it, but Hera's furious answer argues that such a decision would be contrary to the agreed Trojan doom (II. 4.1-67). Because Zeus is sorry that Sarpedon must die and suggests he might save him (II. 16.431-461), commentators have assumed that he could not inter- fere with fate or moira (434). Yet Hera should know, and her anger is based on the contrary assumption: she warns him that all the other gods will disapprove, every god will want to save his favourites from death, and confusion would follow. The position before the death of Hector is of the same kind. The decisions have been taken and Zeus must stick to them (ir&amp;Xat rrirpcopvov ato. II. 16. 441). There is no suggestion that the original decision was not that of the gods, or that Zeus has not the power to change it, only that he should have more sense. He is persuaded in both cases. It is towards his own family that he has to assert his power forcibly and repeatedly in order to be obeyed at all, as every reader of the Iliad knows (e.g. 8.1-40; 15.1-235). As long as they yield in the end, Zeus, like any other wise paterfamilias, thinks it wise to overlook even provocative disobedience, though he loses his temper now and again. And he has to respect the prerogatives of the other gods. There is no discord in heaven in the Odyssey because all the gods (except Poseidon) are sorry for Odysseus; so Zeus expresses the hope that Poseidon will give way to this unanimous family opinion (1.77-79); no other weapon</page><page sequence="4">THE GODS OF HOMER 65 is suggested. Even so, Poseidon's anger has to work itself out after all the others have decided it should end (5.282). Moreover, as Athena tells Odysseus herself (13.341), she too has to respect her uncle's anger while it holds the field. The gods, then, have to respect each other's rights and powers. That much is essential to any community life, human or divine. The final authority belongs to Zeus. In this way we may well see the be- ginning of a divine world-order, provided we do not claim for it a moral basis which does not exist. If Homer emphasizes the overriding power of Zeus, we should remember that he is writing for an audience of polytheists and is one himself, and the basic assumption of polythe- ism is the limitations on any one power. The insistence is therefore very necessary. We read the epics against a background of many centuries of monotheism and are too eager to convert Homer to it also. If Homer could have dreamt of expressing his ideas to us, he might have made Hera and Poseidon use even stronger language. In any case, the father of gods and men must have the greatest power, since it is power that makes the gods divine. They are per- sonifications of forces that are active in the lives of men and which men cannot control. This is quite obvious in the case of the lesser gods and spirits, and even among the greatest Olympians the majority are clearly a natural, social, or psychological power which we recognize still. Zeus himself is the weather and sky-god; Aphrodite, the goddess of sexual passion; and the modern world should have little difficulty in recognizing the power of Ares, god of war. There were gods before Homer, and these must have been thought of as powers, spirits, animal or human persons in a general way, but the clear anthropomorphism which endowed the gods with human form, mind, and personality was almost certainly elaborated by the epic poets themselves. While this process was going on and the great Olympians, as other gods in varying degrees, became individual persons with a life of their own, there can have been for some time no thought that the conduct of the gods had any moral or religious significance. Such a concept could only arise after the anthropomorphic gods had been established long enough for men to reflect upon the implications and consequences of conceiving their gods as persons. While the process was actually going on, the poet could, in describing the life of these newly individualized gods, give entirely free rein to his imagination precisely because this individuality was not then the essence of their divinity, which remained vested in their power. The gods, if we may so put it, were anthropomorphized poetically but not yet theologically. The religious or theological problems which were</page><page sequence="5">66 THE PHOENIX bound to follow full anthropomorphism could not then be realized; they arose later when the divine persons largely created by the poets became objects of worship as persons, their power then becoming secondary as their divinity became vested in their persons. At the stage of development we find in the epic, the force is divine, the personality secondary.12 Hence it would never occur to Homer that the conduct of his gods, their family life, could in any sense affect their divinity, or that it should be depicted as a pattern for humans to follow. It is significant that no one in either epic ever tries to justify his own conduct by pointing to similar conduct among the gods; that belongs to a much later order of ideas.'3 For the epic poets, poetic imagination was free from any religious implications in filling in the picture of the personal life of the gods, and it naturally took its material from the only place it could: human life as it would be if freed from the fears and inhi- bitions of mortality. This purely imaginative anthropomorphism could not last. When the divine powers with human personalities had become divine persons with certain powers-an inevitable development already at work in the epics-reflection would follow and, with it, theological implications that had to be faced, such as the moral consequences of divine conduct. That stage was not reached by Homer who never had to justify the ways of the gods to men; his gods did not need to conform to the human code of honour in order to be worshipped. Homer does not give us any catalogue of the gods and their powers; even the family on Olympus is not clearly defined. Some of them, Hera for example, represent a power at which we can only guess; and the gods (not only Zeus) encroach on each other's powers. Yet we should not conclude that these were as vague as they are to us; a good deal of what Homer does not say he takes for granted. However, in so far as the powers of certain gods have become vague and less functional, this only means that the divine persons have emerged. So the dignity of Zeus' position forces a certain remoteness upon him, a certain humaneness as well as humanity, at least in his dealings with men, though it does not yet compel him to be uniformly either just or truthful. His dealings with his family are still quite irrelevant. Once the implications of full anthropomorphism were faced- which man surely could not do till anthropomorphism was fully a fact-the Homeric laughter at the gods could only survive on licensed occasions, on the comic stage for example, but it remained an integral part of the Greek attitude to the gods. Fortunately, it has never quite died out.</page><page sequence="6">THE GODS OF HOMER 67 In the Homeric epic, fear and laughter walk side by side.'4 Homer can laugh at his gods without making their divinity ridiculous precisely because that divinity resides in their power, not their persons. While the gods are often funny on Olympus, when they come down to exercise their power over the lives of men, they are not a matter for laughter at all. Moreover, Olympus itself is at one and the same time both the never-never land of poetic imagination where the gods lead their highly irresponsible and remarkably human lives, and also the awesome dwelling-place of the terrifying powers which the gods repre- sent, which limit human freedom and control human life. No one is less afraid of war because Ares is amusingly caught in bed with Aphrodite. The gods laugh irresponsibly and so do we. Even a modern reader is more shocked by Zeus when he sends a lying dream to Agamemnon than by all his bickerings with Hera and all his amours. Rightly so, for the way the gods use their power towards men is a serious matter; how they behave to each other is a matter for poetry. Nor is it hard to understand why Homer's audience enjoyed the picture of life on Olympus. We all do, but they could enjoy it without misgivings. They enjoyed seeing the great of the universe making fools of themselves, somewhat in the same spirit perhaps as they or their ancestors must often have looked upon the head of the clan. The Old Man might at times behave ridiculously, even badly, but his power, for all that, could not be trifled with. So Agamemnon behaves more than once like a fool, and sometimes rather badly, but he is still the king of kings, the supreme commander whose power and position not even Achilles can defy with impunity. Every soldier who enjoys stories about the private life of his superior officers, every adolescent in his ambivalent attitude towards the head of the family, has some- thing of the attitude of the Homeric hero towards his gods. Besides, men still, in our much more theologically sombre age, enjoy funny stories about their gods or at least about their saints; and it is the believer who enjoys them most, not the atheist. The trouble, however, is not only that the gods are funny, or mis- behave among themselves; they are also bad. They do not seem to conform to any code of morality that any self-respecting human being, Homeric, classical, or modern, could accept as his own; and that is also true of their behaviour towards men. Viewed morally, the moti- vation of their actions is not only selfish, it is often vicious. That they punish beyond all reason any lack of respect shown towards them- selves was perhaps a natural and inevitable inheritance from those less personalized beings whom they replaced,1'6 but Hera's fierce hatred of Troy and the Trojans is both excessive and hardly accounted for;'6</page><page sequence="7">68 THE PHOENIX Poseidon's anger against Odysseus for blinding the Cyclops, that cannibalistic brute, in pure self-defence, is just as bad, and his vengeance on the Phaeacians disgusting. So is Helios' revenge upon the com- panions of Odysseus for slaying a few of his cattle after a month's starvation brought upon them by Zeus.'7 The picture of world forces represented by these gods has little order and no morality. Even much later than Homer, the word eb6s does not connote goodness but power,s'8 and Homer certainly does not depict his gods as moral rulers of the world. Of such a later conception there are only faint traces. It has been said that Homer's ethics are nobler than his theology.'9 That is very true. His heroes have a code of honour of considerable nobility; his gods have none. That is natural enough; men had lived in communities which required an ethical code for centuries; the gods had only just begun to do so, relatively speaking. We are accustomed to think of human conduct as deriving from, or at least sanctioned by, religion; for the Olympian religion, at least, the truth is the other way around. It was the human moral feelings which forced morality upon the gods, once they had become persons. Man's concepts of goodness developed, and the Olympians were always lagging behind. This process, in Homer, was only just beginning. To try, from a few stray passages, to make the Homeric gods the defenders of right and justice, is to force upon them a mould that simply does not fit, and to generalize a few faint hopes into ruling principles.20 Neither do the sons and favourites of the gods claim any special moral merit. Achilles is no better, morally, than Hector, Priam, Nestor, or Diomede; indeed he behaves worse than any of these; but he is the son of a sea-nymph who has a claim on Zeus. The poet makes Achilles greater, but not better. Menelaus is promised eternal life specifically because he is the son-in-law of Zeus (Od. 4.569). Certainly, Odysseus cannot claim any outstanding moral rectitude; in fact the slaying of the suitors, and, in particular, of Amphinomus and Leodes, with the revolting massacre of the maidservants, is the most deliber- ately savage episode in the two poems.21 The maids are not punished for sexual immorality-that, from Odysseus, would be too absurd- but from an outraged sense of property. To say that the gods have no interest in morality does not mean that men have none, but it is quite independent of the gods.22 In a very few particulars, however, the process of imposing this human code upon the gods, and looking to them to defend it, has begun. One of these is the sanctity of oaths. Agamemnon expects Zeus to punish the Trojans after the victory of Menelaus in the duel with Paris (II. 3.160-167).23 He later swears he never touched Briseis, by</page><page sequence="8">THE GODS OF HOMER 69 Zeus, Earth, Helios "and the Erinyes who punish men, whoever breaks his oath." The gods, he continues, punish perjurers (II. 19.255-265). In the Odyssey too, oaths are expected to be kept, even by Calypso and Circe (5.178-187; 10.343). But how about the gods themselves? It is Athena who directs the spear that kills Pandarus (II. 5.290-296), but it was also Athena, sent by Zeus for the purpose, who instigated him to break the truce (II. 3.72-73). Hera does not hesitate, after her escapade on Ida, to perjure herself before Zeus by Earth, Heaven, Styx, Zeus' sacred head, and their own marriage. Zeus smiles, he doesn't really believe her, but nothing happens. Men attach great importance to oaths; but even here the gods have not quite caught up with them, either in their behaviour towards men or towards each other. Then there is the protection which Zeus is expected to give to strangers and suppliants. This is more frequent in the Odyssey, for there are no strangers in the Iliad. The belief that strangers are under his protection is frequently expressed.24 As we do not often meet Zeus himself in the Odyssey, we cannot conclude anything from his silence on the matter, but he singularly fails to protect the Phaeacians, those excellent hosts, whom Poseidon hates for this very reason; in fact, Zeus hands them over to him without a qualm. There is beautiful personification of Litai or Prayers in the appeal of Phoenix to Achilles (II. 9.496-512). Prayers are the daughters of Zeus, wrinkled and squinting though they be, and they follow after Ate, so strong and swift. If not listened to, they pray to Zeus to send At$ to him who did not listen, that he may be punished. The whole passage is a beautiful poetic image of a human hope, but it is only a hope: Zeus may or may not listen. Certainly, this expresses an aspiration towards divine justice, but that justice is not established. It is perhaps significant that in the story of Meleager which illustrates Phoenix' point there is no divine intervention on behalf of mercy; it is simply an example of the principle that mercy is often the best policy. There is only one other passage in the whole Iliad which speaks of moral retribution from the gods, this time more definitely and spoken in the poet's own person, in a simile (16.384-386). The flight of the Trojans before Patroclus is compared to a flood "sent by Zeus when he is angry and presses upon men who by violence give crooked judg- ments in the market-place and have chased away justice (8tKlv), with- out care for visitation from the gods." Thus once and once only in the Iliad do we find Zeus and the gods spoken of as defenders of "justice."25 The exact meaning of even this passage, however, is interesting. ALKtf in Homer is never used in the wide sense of justice; it usually</page><page sequence="9">70 THE PHOENIX means lot or portion or legal decisions which give everyone his due. This is also the meaning here, as the reference to crooked judgments makes clear. The same sense is implied in various passages of the Odyssey where the belief is expressed that the gods will punish the suitors, whose hubris consists precisely in their wasting another man's property. And Odysseus' motive in punishing them is also an out- raged sense of property, which in him was highly developed. The most elaborate of these passages is where the pious Eumaeus speaks of the retribution from the gods which awaits the suitors; here 68Kl still has the same meaning. He says to Odysseus in his cottage (14.80): Eat, good stranger, of this pork which is available to us servants; the fatted hogs are for the suitors who have no thought of visitation from the gods, and have no pity. Yet the blessed gods like not deeds of excess; they honour each man's lot (6K7tvy) and deeds in accordance with fate.26 Even the harsh and implacable men who attack the land of others, when Zeus has granted them booty, return to their ships and, when they have filled them, go home. Great fear of divine visitations comes even upon their minds; but these suitors must have heard some message from the gods that a dreadful death has come upon my master; they will not do their wooing in the accepted manner (6cKalow) nor go back to their own, but without let or hindrance they devour my master's possessions without mercy. Eumaeus then enumerates the possessions of Odysseus that are being wasted. The illustration of pirates is significant. So wherever anyone expresses the hope that the suitors will be punished, the hope is tempered by the knowledge that the gods are unpredictable. Apart from such occasional passages27 which contain the seed of the later concept of divine justice, the gods are not presented, either in their own conduct or in the minds of men, as the protectors of order and justice. They are, of course, capable of the gentler emotions as well as the more violent. Some of them feel pity, usually for their own favourites, as when Apollo resents the treatment of Hector's body by Achilles, or Athena the prolonged sufferings of Odysseus. In both cases they persuade Zeus and the majority, but not all of the others that something should be done about it. We should not, on such occasional better feelings, build any theory of the humaneness of the gods; it is simply part of their humanity.28 For Homer's gods are human; they are often bad, but not one of the great Olympians is uniformly devilish. The gods give of good and evil to the good and the evil at their own sweet will; man must endure whatever they send. This does not mean, however, that man is merely the plaything of the gods, without freedom of action or responsibility for his own life. Far from it. The dependence on the gods is much more immediate and complete in the</page><page sequence="10">THE GODS OF HOMER 71 Odyssey, because there we find ourselves in the realm of folklore and marvellous adventure with the gods, mostly Athena, in constant at- tendance like a familiar spirit. If there is less divine supervision in the story as told by Odysseus himself (9-12), it is because he, like other mortals, is less aware of this supervision than the poet who knows all the details. That is also why there is a freer use in those books of the more general terms-Zeus, the gods, etc. Yet it is also in the Odyssey that Zeus tells us that men by their own obstinacy bring much evil on themselves beyond the fate set by the gods (iirip 6bpov 1.35). He gives the example of Aegisthus; now if Aegisthus' fate did not include his living with Clytemnestra and the killing of Agamemnon, then surely the fate set by the gods left a great deal to the humans themselves. We remember Achilles' choice of a short but glorious life. The Iliad certainly leaves this impression of a wide area of freedom within the limits set by fate, for the heroes are there anything but puppets. The poet expresses this freedom dramatically by leaving a great deal of the action, some of it most important in its consequences, without any divine intervention upon the purely human plane. Apollo sends the plague and Hera puts it in Achilles' mind to call the as- sembly, but the actual quarrel between Achilles and Agamemnon is a matter of human temperament entirely until Athena comes to prevent it from going too far. Later, Achilles sends Patroclus into the Greek camp of his own accord; it is Nestor who first suggests that Patroclus should join the battle in Achilles' armour. This last chain of events has been cryptically forecast by Zeus (II. 8.476) and is later sanctioned by him (II. 9.796) but only human factors are involved. The same is true of the embassy to Achilles. Nor do the gods ever interfere with, or inspire, tactical decisions such as Nestor's advice to build a wall, to fight by phratries (II. 2.364) or to send spies into the Trojan camp at night. And the same is true on the Trojan side (II. 12.88; 15.287-299). Not only will the Homeric hero act independently when the gods are absent; he will continue to fight when he knows that the gods are on the other side. Ajax says any fool can see that Zeus is helping the Trojans, but he then calls upon his friends to see what they can ac- complish by themselves (acrol II. 17.634) and he utters his famous prayer to Zeus at least to let them die in the light. When the Greek envoys come to Achilles, they plead for his help precisely because Zeus is helping the Trojans (II. 9.236-239), and Odysseus appeals to Di- omede in the same manner (II. 11.319). This is partly because, as the gods represent actual forces, to say that Zeus helps the Trojans is only</page><page sequence="11">72 THE PHOENIX to emphasize the fact of Trojan success; partly because the gods are changeable, and men hold on in the hope of such a change; it is mostly because men must follow their own code of honourable conduct what- ever the gods may do. The Phaeacians give a superb example of this: they know perfectly well that they are incurring the wrath of Poseidon by saving his victims; they have been warned of the dreadful fate that awaits them if they persist, but they live up to their code of be- haviour in spite of it all (Od. 8.565-570). The gods may wound a hero, they may kill him, they can never break his spirit. When you die is a matter for fate and the gods; how you die, and what kind of a man you are while you live, is your own responsibility. Such is, in part; the heroic code. In this sense men must endure, bravely and without flinching, whatever the gods may send, be it one's general fate or the result of unpredictable interventions on specific occasions.29 The manner of these interferences sometimes offers considerable difficulty to readers of a later age, even to those who can accept the amorality and frivolity of the gods in general. The more remote interventions, such as the Apollo who sends the plague, are easier: he is a great power that has been offended; his anthropomorphism, in spite of the beautiful picture of his descent, does not here obtrude. Nor do we feel any direct discomfort about the scenes on Olympus once we accept the mythological apparatus; the visits of Thetis to Zeus and Hephaestus are of the same kind. It is when the contact with mortals is more direct that we are disconcerted. In the battle of the gods (II. 20 and 21) the Olympian family moves to earth in a body, with the exception of Zeus, and they bring with them both aspects of Olympus, the home of awful powers and the never-never land of poetic fancy. The intention obviously is to underline the importance of the final battle to come between Achilles and Hector (1. 20.1-74). After their descent, accompanied by thunder and earthquake, the rest of the book is on the human level, with only the customary help from individual gods. Then, as the corpses choke the river Xanthus, we are prepared for the battle be- tween Achilles and the river-god; soon, despite warnings, Achilles leaps into the river itself in pursuit and the battle is on. This struggle is not grotesque, as it has been said to be:30 except that he is a god and speaks with a human voice, all the physical manifestations of this struggle are those of a river in flood which overpowers the reckless Achilles and drives him away as its swollen waves pursue him over the plain. Weird and wonderful this may be, but not grotesque, and without doubt it is entirely serious. Then, as Hephaestus takes over,</page><page sequence="12">THE GODS OF HOMER 73 Achilles disappears and we have the fight between the elements of fire and water. We are now upon the Olympian plane; no mortal will appear until the battle of the gods is over (II. 21.328-520). This, as always, is a matter between us and the poet; and at this point comes the usual comic or fantasy-relief. The battle of the gods themselves cannot be tragic for, as Aristotle might have said, no one can kill anybody.31 After Xanthus has been forced to plead for mercy and return within his banks, the gods draw up for battle and Zeus smiles as he sees them, in fact he laughs out- right (II. 21.389-390). The dramatic purpose of the battle is perhaps to emphasize the superiority of the gods on the Greek side, the side of Achilles, but the details are frankly amusing: Athena lays out Ares; Aphrodite leads him out of the battle but Athena pushes her down on top of him; Hera jeers at Artemis, holds her by the wrists and boxes her ears; Artemis then rushes up to Zeus but he refuses to take the incident seriously. There is no major battle between great gods equally matched, and when Poseidon challenges Apollo the latter refuses. We laugh with Zeus, and then the gods retire and leave the field to the much more terrible struggle between mortals. One thing is clear: the poet did not try to depict a mighty battle of the gods and fail; he obviously did not try. He is indulging his usual fantasies about the gods, and amuses us before we face the tragic death of Hector. This is true of the battle itself; but there is nothing funny about the gods' descent from heaven or Achilles' fight with Xanthus. If the frivolous and serious aspects of the gods are here kept separate, the Diomedeia, where Diomede wounds both Ares and Aphrodite, is the boldest mixture of serious and funny business in our epics. The reason is that Diomede must never rise to the same level of greatness as Achilles, but he must do the same kind of things. So he too fights the gods, but under the direct supervision of Athena who sees to it that things do not get out of hand and his encounter with the gods remains more than half comic. Before Apollo or the lightning of Zeus he gives way (II. 5.440-445; 8.169). The personal interventions of particular gods to encourage their side or on behalf of their favourites are very numerous. If the question of fairness is raised, they are all equally unfair. Commentators are inclined here to strain at the gnat while they swallow the camel, and their modern feelings lead them to object to certain details of the interference. We should always remember that the appearance of a god on behalf of a hero is a poetic symbol of that hero's greatness, so that it is ex hypothesi impossible for that greatness to be tarnished by</page><page sequence="13">74 THE PHOENIX the help of the god. We dislike the way Apollo pushes Patroclus, strikes him in the back and sends his helmet flying, thus making him an easy prey for Euphorbus and Hector (II. 16.694, 788);32 yet the poet feels that Zeus is giving glory to Hector and he is compared to a lion when he delivers the final blow (II. 16.800, 827). We dislike the deceit which Athena practises on Hector to make Achilles' task easier. That is because we like Patroclus and Hector, and we have modern notions of sportsmanship, but these interventions are like many others. Nobody likes Pandarus, but Athena's instigation to break the common oath is at least as objectionable (II. 4.90-102) and if it be said that Pandarus is a poor lot anyway (forgetting that it is Athena who made him so), what of Rhesus who has done no harm, and Athena's conduct throughout the Doloneia, or the less deadly, but so unsporting inter- ventions of the gods in the games (II. 23.380, 392, 774, 865)? The details of these interventions vary as fancy dictates, they have no moral significance whatever; they are dramatic and poetic symbols of the greatness of particular heroes. Some interventions are even less objectified, and the god seems part of the human personality, as when Aphrodite appears to Helen to make her look after Paris (II. 4.386-420) or Athena stops Achilles from drawing his sword (II. 1.195). Our trouble here is that we ob- jectify the gods more than Homer. Aphrodite is not only the goddess of love, she is love or passion, and she is Helen's passion, both at the same time-a synthesis which few modern readers seem able to achieve. Homer provides the answer himself, when Odysseus says to Eurycleia: "Now that you've thought of this and a god has put it in your mind" (Od. 19.485). Divine intervention does not exclude human activity, it is merely a poetic and imaginative way of describing the same activity. Let us always remember that the gods are forces rather than persons. It would be very strange if we could feel about them as Homer did; the wonder is rather that we can accept so much and enjoy so much. The reason for this is probably the same reason which caused these Olympians to remain objects of worship for another thousand years, and never to lose their imaginative appeal: they are forces many of which every man knows and recognizes in his own life, forces which control a great part of life, and which no one can deny.33 Lightning and thunder, fire, death, sexual passion, music and the arts, and those lesser spirits, Fear, Panic, Rumour, Death, and the rest, are they not obviously true, and has anyone represented them more vividly than Homer?</page><page sequence="14">THE GODS OF HOMER 75 The picture of life represented by the gods of Homer is a true pic- ture, even if it is incomplete. But over all these forces Zeus has been established as master. That mastery is pregnant with the problems of later religion, when men will insist that the order of Zeus must be a moral order, or refuse to believe. Then Ionian scepticism will arise, but it is as foreign to Homer as are the other implications of his anthropomorphic Olympian company. At most we find in the epic only the very first glimmerings of such an order of thought, as men have only just begun to feel the need to impress upon the gods the essentials of their own moral code, when they hope or begin to expect that these gods will punish perjurers, protect strangers seeking hospi- tality, and punish those who have no respect for the property of an absent laird. It will not be till later still that the gods' conduct will be looked upon as an example to mankind. This is entirely absent from the epic. To attribute scenes which depict such divine conduct to interpolators and later poets is to miss the whole spirit of those scenes themselves, to read into Homer what belongs to later centuries, and a point of view which is quite incompatible with that full, poetic, irresponsible anthropomorphism which is one of the chief glories of the Homeric epic. NOTES 1. The phrase is G. M. Calhoun's in "Homer's Gods: Prolegomena," TAPA 68 (1937) 21. The whole article is an interesting statement of our problem. 2. Throughout this article I use the words moral, morality, immoral in their true sense, not in the debased and restricted modern fashion excellently illustrated when one of our learned judges, addressing the jury in a recent murder trial, said: "This, I repeat, is not a case of morals but of murder; morality has nothing to do with it." His lordship was of course referring to the sexual immorality of the accused. 3. Proponents of this view, among others, are P. Cauer, Grundfragen der Homerkritik3 (Leipzig 1923) 376-406; Wilamowitz, who discovers several strata of development and degeneration, Die Ilias und Homer (Berlin 1916) 316-355; G. Finsler, who has an earlier stage of unrelated gods whom men revere, and a later stage when Olympus has become a state of the gods and the poet hates them as cruel and selfish, Homer IP (Leipzig and Berlin 1924) 1.168-169 and 2.207-215; Gilbert Murray, who distinguishes four different strata, The Rise of the Greek Epic' (London 1934) 267. Interesting criticisms of this whole point of view will be found in E. Drerup, Das Homerproblem in der Gegenwart (Wiirzburg 1921) 226-231 and 414-422, G. M. Calhoun's "The Higher Criticism on Olympus," AJP 58 (1937) 257-274. J. M. Duffy, in his dissertation, reviews the evidence to show that the gods are the same throughout: A Comparative Study of the Religion of the Iliad and the Odyssey (Chicago 1937).</page><page sequence="15">76 THE PHOENIX 4. So C. M. Bowra, Tradition and Design in the Iliad (Oxford 1930) 215-233, Calhoun also separates the gods of ethical thought from those of myth in TAPA 68 (1937) 17. Andrew Lang, The World of Homer (London 1910) 120-127, and Drerup 416-422. 5. In particular E. Hed~n, Homerische Giitterstudien (Uppsala 1912) speaks of a deeper religion, that of the characters, tinged with scepticism but closely con- nected with ritual, and that of the poet which is purely mythical and poetic. But the most "religious" passage of the Iliad (16.386-393, see below) is in a simile. Hed~n's theory is discussed by E. Ehnmark, The Idea of God in Homer (Uppsala 1935) 64-70; M. P. Nilsson, A History of Greek Religion (Oxford 1949) 162-179. 6. B. E. Perry, "The Early Greek Capacity for Viewing Things Separately," TAPA 68 (1937) 415-418; and J. A. Notopoulos' "Parataxis in Homer" TAPA 80 (1949) 8-9. Here more openly stated, some such mental parataxis is implied in most discussions of Homer's gods. 7. Wilamowitz, Der Glaube der Hellenen (Berlin 1931) 317; T. D. Seymour, Life in the Homeric Age (London 1907) 392-395; Jane Harrison, Mythology (Boston 1924) xvi-xx; Gilbert Murray, Five Stages of Greek Religion (Oxford 1925) 24-32; Nilsson, A History 135-146. While many of the details of Homer's representation of his gods can be accounted for by earlier evidence, and Athena may be called yXavKiwrLs because she was once an owl-goddess, this is of little help in interpreting the Homeric Athena. We shall therefore find little to help us in the many interesting books on the origins of Greek religion. 8. M. P. Nilsson's theory that Homer's Olympus was created after the pattern of the Mycenaean kingship is well known; Homer and Mycenae (London 1933) 266-277, The Minoan-Mycenaean Religion and its Survival in Greek Religion (Lund 1950) 30. Finsler too speaks of Olympus as a kingdom, but G. M. Calhoun has shown that Zeus is much more like a patriarch than a king, he is never, for example, called 3aoLXeVs; see "Zeus The Father in Homer," TAPA 66 (1935) 1-17. Calhoun's other interesting theory that there is no real nobility of birth in Homer may also be noted here: "Classes and Masses in Homer," CP 29 (1934) 192-208 and 301-316. 9. The qualification is important, for if all the gods knew everything, and could do everything, all the time, life on Olympus could not be of much dramatic interest. So the poet solved the difficulty by letting the attention of the gods wander, even that of Zeus. This dramatic necessity should offer no difficulty and is hardly worth learned discussion. So also the gods can move very quickly, but they have chariots and make at times elaborate preparations for a journey they could have accomplished as quickly as thought (II. 5.711-791; 8.381-396; 13.17-28). Poseidon is away among the Ethiopians at the beginning of the Odyssey (1.22) as Zeus is at the beginning of the Iliad (1.423). The gods can also hide from one another (II. 5.844; 13.352). For the omniscience of the gods see Od. 4.468; 10.306, 573; 14.443. 0fO. Moira or Fate appears sometimes alone sometimes along with Zeus, some- times as explicitly sent by the gods. Surely the poet need not repeat whence it comes every time it is mentioned, provided there is no suggestion of any other agency, and we have no right to pick out the places where it occurs alone to build on them a theory of an independent power. W. C. Greene, Moira (Harvard 1944) 14, says "there is no essential conflict" between Moira and Zeus, but he continues: "even the gods are under the stern power of the Erinyes." Actually the Erinyes too perform their function under Zeus. The two passages where the gods are under their power are II. 21.412, where Athena warns Ares he may suffer the Erinyes of his mother Hera, and II. 15.204 where Iris warns Poseidon of the anger of Zeus, "for the Erinyes always follow the elders." In those cases the Erinyes would obviously be acting for Hera</page><page sequence="16">NOTES 77 and Zeus, and represent their anger. In other passages the Erinyes are another expression for the will of the gods which they execute (II. 19.418; 19.258-260 where they punish perjurers and are immediately equated with the gods at 264-265; cf. Od. 2.135). The same is true of Att who also is sent by Zeus (II. 19.87-94). Jane Harrison, Themis (Cambridge 1927) 481, claims that "Themis is beyond all the other gods," but the Themites come from Zeus also (Od. 2.67), and Themis is clearly a subordinate when he orders her to call an assembly of the gods (II. 20.4) as much as Iris when she is sent on an errand; it is foolish to say that Zeus could not call the assembly himself. All these concepts were to develop later, some had an earlier history, but in Homer they are subordinated to the great gods, particularly Zeus. If this is thought to be an over-simplification, it is Homer who simplifies. For other views see Greene's Moira 10-28, Bowra, Tradition 230-231; Ehnmark, The Idea 78- 80. The fullest discussion of the evidence for Moira in Homer is still NAigelsbach, Homerische Theologie (Niirnberg 1861) 120-148. 11. This generalized use of the name of Zeus, and the vaguer expressions Oe6s, ol OwLo, is excellently discussed by O. J6rgensen in "Das Auftreten der G6tter in den Biichern '-M der Odyssee," Hermes 39 (1904) 357-382. He shows how these ex- pressions naturally occur in direct speech and makes short work of the elaborate theories that ignore this simple fact in the story told by Odysseus. Hed~n (above, n. 5) then exploits this discovery less happily for his own purposes. See also G. F. Else, "God and Gods in Early Greek Thought," TAPA 80 (1949) 24-36, and Ehn- mark, The Idea 80-85. 12. One is reminded of Wilamowitz' profound remark that, in Greek, ebs is a predicative notion, "ein Pridikatsbegriff," Der Glaube 17-20. 13. Homeric characters blame their misfortunes on the gods, e.g. II. 19.87-94; they even blame the gods when they are not responsible (II. 19.270; Od. 4.261) but they do not excuse their conduct by that of the gods. 14. Drerup reminds us (417) of what is far too often forgotten, that Homer does not hesitate to laugh at his heroes too. 15. To insist that honour be paid to them is as characteristic of other than Homeric gods; the Jehovah of the Old Testament is just as insistent. 16. There is only a casual reference to the judgment of Paris at II. 24.25-27, which should remind us of how much may be taken for granted that we do not know. 17. Od. 12.370-390; 13.125-187; we may also compare Poseidon's anger at the building of the Greek wall in I1. 7.442-463 and the ugly give and take of II. 4.40-90. I can see no evidence for considering Zeus as "a high philosophical conception of the world-conscience" in the Odyssey, Jaeger, Paideia (Oxford 1945) 1.54. 18. I have discussed the meaning of 0Es also in Plato's Thought (London 1935) 150-153 and in The Drama of Euripides (London 1941) 41-44. 19. Greene, Moira, 11. 20. Typical of this point of view are W. E. Gladstone, Homer (London 1878) 66-67; Andrew Lang, The World of Homer (London 1910) 120-122; L. R. Farnell, Outline of Greek Religion (London 1920) 19-20. 21. It will be recalled that Leodes is killed by Odysseus while a suppliant (Od. 22.310-329) although his claim to have been a restraining influence upon the suitors is endorsed by the poet himself (Od. 21.146-147). Telemachus kills Amphinomus (Od. 22.89) although it was he who had dissuaded the suitors from killing Telemachus (Od. 20.242-246). Amphinomus was also kind to the beggar Odysseus who in fact tried to warn him, but Athena saw to it that the warning should be ineffective (Od. 18.118-156). The conduct of Athena throughout these books is quite as objectionable as anything in the Iliad.</page><page sequence="17">78 THE PHOENIX 22. A very striking brief account of the code of the hero and its relation to the gods is that of Rend Schaerer, La Morale grecque dans Hom~re (Lausanne 1934, in- augural lecture). 23. It is interesting to find Idomeneus (II. 4.270-271) saying that punishment and death will come to the Trojans for breaking the oath, without mentioning the gods. That is the general feeling that honesty is the best policy, before it is linked with the gods. 24. Od. 6.207; 7.165, 180; 9.268, 478; 13.203; 14.57, 284, 388; 16.422; 17.484. 25. We might declare at least 386-387 a later interpolation, but that way lies chaos. While we are not told that punishment always follows crooked judgments (which it obviously does not), the implication that crooked judgments are punished by Zeus is there, even if the punishment is rather indiscriminate. The sentiments are closely parallel in Hesiod, Works and Days 219-264. It is wiser to let this passage remind us that we are not dealing with static ideas about the gods. Human rewards for the best judgment are found in II. 18.507-508. The expression irrs OEcov is usually translated as the wrath of the gods, but that is too strong a word. The word 7rLs seems to mean the attention of the gods, cf. A~bts 6' cnrLEero i.wjvL/~elVov (Od. 14.283-284). It was used later in both a good and a bad sense. 26. ob0i v a~XrXLa 'pya Oeol piape~s kLXEovULv, &amp;XX&amp; 6Lv TrovUL Kal a~acLu a Zpy' &amp;vOpc~rowv. 27. We should perhaps add to them Od. 11.73, Elpenor's request that he be buried lest he provoke the anger of the gods against Odysseus; and Od. 18.130-142- the famous passage on the wretchedness of men, where Odysseus (in his warning to Amphinomus) says that man must bear bravely what the gods send, for even his thoughts depend upon the lot Zeus sends him, and that man must not be &amp;Oeortos but bear the gifts of the gods in silence. The ethical implications, however, are very faint. 28. II. 24.23-64; Od. 1.44-47. One should, of course, not include the pity which the lying dream says Zeus feels, for there the whole point is that he doesn't, but pity is also felt by Zeus at II. 15.12; 17.201, 441, 648; 19.340; 22.169. 29. Obedience to the gods is part of virtue, but it is largely voluntary: cf. II. 1.207 and 216. Nor does the Homeric hero hesitate to curse his gods: II. 3.365; 9.17-25; Od. 20.201-203. 30. E.g. by E. T. Owen: The Story of the Iliad (Toronto 1946) 211-212. 31. See Poetics, 13.1453a. 39. 32. "The poet has piled up point after point in his description of the circum- stances of Patroclus' death, so that even the least imaginative reader must burn with indignation at the way it is accomplished. That is what Homer wants, for he is motivating the terrific fury and grief of Achilles" (Owen, The Story 163). 33. "Die G6tter sind da." Wilamowitz, Der Glaube 17, 42. There is an interest- ing discussion of the meaning of some Homeric terms in Bruno Snell, Die Entdeckung des Geistes (Hamburg 1946) 15-36, and the Homeric "belief" in the gods, 40-41.</page></plain_text>
