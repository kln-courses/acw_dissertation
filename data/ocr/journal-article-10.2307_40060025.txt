<plain_text><page sequence="1">ADULTERY, IDOLATRY, AND THE SUBJECT OF MONOTHEISM Catherine E. Winiarski From the ancient Hebrew Decalogue to the Protestant hagiography of the sixteenth century, female monogamy within contractual marriage serves as a primary figure for covenantal monotheism. The Mosaic covenant represented itself as a radical break from the polytheistic and pantheistic religions which preceded it in the Near East and continued to surround it after its inception. The repression, containment, and regulation of polymorphous sexuality instituted by marriage parallels the repression of sexualized, fertility-cultic pantheism and polytheism by monotheism and the Mosaic covenant. Following the analogy between contractual marriage and covenantal monotheism, adultery becomes the figure for idolatry and vice versa.1 These fertile analogies have generated a long history of legal and political principles - as well as literary motifs, figures, and plots - in Judeo-Christian texts and the secular literature that branched from them. In particular, these analogies serve to incorporate the multitude of Israelites at Sinai into a coherent communal body. They also define and configure the spaces that competing national groups, inside and outside the covenant, occupy, as well as the transit points between those spaces. This essay traces the constitution of the subject of monotheism and the zones in which she - a R&amp;L 38.3 (Autumn 2006) 41</page><page sequence="2">42 Religion &amp; Literature decidedly feminine subject - moves, through several historical variations on the marriage /monotheism analogy: the Decalogue, the prophetic books of the Hebrew Bible, the Christian gospels, Paul's Epistles, and Augustine's City of God. These texts establish and test both the boundaries and the points of interpenetration between monotheism and its others - between the brides of God and the strangers who court them. Whoring after Idols: A Hebrew Allegory The first commandment establishes a pre-condition of the marriage contract between Yahweh and Israel even as it establishes the first term of that contract: "I am the Lord thy God, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. Thou shalt have no other gods before Me" (JPS Holy Scriptures, Exod 20.2).2 In his anthology of rabbinic commentary on the Decalogue, Avrohom Chaim Feuer notes that "before Me" is literally, in the Hebrew, "before my face" (29). This is a pre-condi- tion of God's marital contract with Israel: he assumes an anthropomorphic form that permits the parties to meet face-to-face. Of course, this anthro- pomorphism does threaten the sublimity of God, his transcendence from the world of his creation, and moderates the strictness of the second com- mandment, which outlaws images. As Kenneth Reinhard and Julia Reinhard Lupton observe, this figuration of God holds "the lure of the imaginary in abeyance rather than killing it off entirely" (79). This sacrifice of some of God's sublimity, this figuration of him as "faced," is vital in establishing a particular space of monotheism and spatial orientation of the human subject of monotheism: covenantal fidelity figured as nearness to the imagined face of God and moreover, physical orientation towards that face. The religious subject has, as it were, a face with which she can turn towards God, as well as a back with which she can turn away. Jeremiah affirms this double-sided- ness of the religious subject: God's oracle proclaims, "they have turned their back unto Me, and not their face" (Jer 2.27). This double-surfaced subject would seem to have only these two determinate orientations: towards God or away from him. Nonetheless, this possibility of vacillation or play within the religious subject registers her freedom to accept or renounce, even if it is within a system of determinate and dichotomized choices. On the other side of the contract, God's face is, above all, observant, over the entire face of his creation; Yahweh emerges as an examining, even a scopophilic god, reserving the pleasures of the visual for himself as he denies them to his new subjects. The text imagines violation of the first commandment as distance from this observing face, an attempt to escape God's omniscient gaze.3 The</page><page sequence="3">CATHERINE E. WINIARSKI 43 idolater wanders from the centered, settled oikos of God as anthropomor- phized husband, out into a peripheral wilderness occupied by nomadic, idolatrous peoples. And indeed, aspects of the wilderness itself (stones, trees, mountains) are the very objects of pantheistic worship, demoted into idols by the new religion of Yahweh. Fidelity to covenantal monotheism is a settled, directed nearness, a centripetal orientation towards God. Idolatry is a centrifugal turn away, a wandering outwards, a "scattering of the ways." Here and elsewhere in the Hebrew Bible, a native space, near to God, is established in opposition to a foreign space, far from him (but nonetheless within his omniscient view). These short opening lines of the Decalogue conceive the Israelite community through this dichotomy of near/far or center/periphery. The second commandment (or the second part of the first, according to some traditions)4 more explicitly constructs Israel as the bride of God. This commandment further secures his exclusive status as husband of Israel, securing him both from the lure of nature as a potential object of worship and from the lure of human art. Yahweh puts a ban on image creation itself, condemning it perhaps as an attempt to usurp his exclusive creative power.5 Yahweh's stated rationale for prohibiting image manufacture and worship is his jealous nature, the quality of a human husband: "for I the Lord thy God am ajealous [Hebrew: qanna^ God" (Exod 20.4). Here we may observe erotic passion animating the quid pro quo legalism of the contract.6 This would suggest that God's justice, his exaction of penalty in measure with the crime, is compromised by the passion present in the legal contract. Indeed, God's impassioned, jealous nature leads him to punish in excess of the crime, as well as reward in excess of the good work: "I the Lord thy God am ajealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate Me; and showing mercy unto the thousandth generation of them that love Me and keep My commandments" (Exod 20.4-5). The threat of punishment arises here in emphatic and violent terms; it is mentioned only in moderated form after the third commandment ("Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain; for the Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh His name in vain" [Exod 20.6]). It is the threat of direct competition with other gods or images for the affection and obedience of the people that most obviously arouses Yahweh's wrathful and punitive nature. As emphasized by the rabbis and many other commentators, the sym- metry between the first half of the Decalogue and the second supports the association of idolatry with adultery. The injunction against image-making (the second commandment on the first tablet) is matched with the injunc- tion against adultery (the second commandment on the second tablet).7 The</page><page sequence="4">44 Religion &amp; Literature biblical prophets, as we shall see, provide an allegorical development of this parallel. Tertullian and Calvin recognize and develop the parallel in their attacks on Roman paganism and iconophilic Catholicism. Because the in- junction against idolatry precedes the injunction against adultery in the text of the Decalogue, the laws governing the human relationship could be said to follow from the laws governing the religious one and to be modeled upon it. On the other hand, God presents "jealousy," the passionate possessiveness of a human husband as his rationale for the second commandment. In this way, the prohibition against idolatry seems to be modeled on a prior injunc- tion against adultery. By implication, the Israelites are to imagine themselves as the wife of a jealous husband. Thus, a circular figuration presents itself: the Decalogue patterns adultery on idolatry and idolatry on adultery. As in the confrontation of God's face with that of the religious subject, idolatry and adultery confront one another in a relationship of mutual mirroring. Mirroring and figuration continue in the penalties God establishes for the sins of adultery and idolatry. Deuteronomy 22 lays out the specific punishment designed for those guilty of adultery, intended to be carried out by the community and not God himself: stoning to death. As revealed in Deuteronomy 17, the penalty for idolatry is the same. God's oracle in Ezekiel proclaims against the lapsed Israelites, "I will judge thee, as women that break wedlock and shed blood are judged; and I will bring upon thee the blood of fury and jealousy" (Ezek 16.38).8 Stoning is a penalty which, in this case, cannot be considered generic or arbitrary. The penal law laid out in the Pentateuch is markedly concerned with the representation of the crime in the punishment, suggesting that this principle of accurate representation constitutes a principle of justice itself. The "graven images" of the second commandment refer, at least in part, to the stone statues of the Egyptian and Canaanite religions. Though Deuteronomy 1 7 does not mention stones as objects of idolatrous worship, they appear frequently in the prophetic books, especially Jeremiah. Yahweh's punishment of stoning turns the idolater's object of worship against him; the idolater worships the object in the hopes of receiving blessings but instead brings destruction upon himself. In Ezekiel, Yahweh appoints the idolatrous enemies of Israel, those with whom the Israelites have been fornicating figuratively, as the executors of this penalty of stoning: "I will also give thee into their hand. . .They shall also bring up an assembly against thee, and they shall stone thee with stones" (Ezek 16.39-40). The idolatry of the Israelites is thus conceived as a kind of tragic self-subversion in which the subject, trusting in the idol to bring him profit, is ironically destroyed by it and by the idolaters he has imitated. The image of the idolater's "heart of stone," seen elsewhere in Ezekiel, suggests that the stone idol even has a power of contagious metamorphosis; it turns</page><page sequence="5">CATHERINE E. WINIARSKI 45 the idolater himself to stone, hardening him to the loving, spousal affection of God and even killing him.9 God's calls for Israel to return to him contain the promise to remove the idolater's heart of stone: "I will remove the stony heart out of their flesh, and will give them a heart of flesh" (Ezek 11.19). The idolater's transformation to stone suggests that she loses the complexity and freedom she enjoyed in the covenant and becomes a monad, simple and unchangeable. It requires a kind of transplant surgery, performed by God, to convert her back to a monotheistic subject. The monotheistic sub- ject is decidedly organic here, in contrast to the inorganicism of the idolater transformed by the stone idol. The heart of flesh is soft, receptive to influ- ence from the outside, animate and affective; of course, this animation and affectivity always carry with them the threat and promise of death, just as monotheism is constantly threatened by idolatry. Life itself becomes the figure for the monotheism of Yahweh, death for idolatry. In the historical books following the Pentateuch, the marriage between Yahweh and the Israelites turns out to be a rocky one indeed, as Israel lapses again and again into adulterous affairs. In the Book of Judges, the exceptional characters of the judges serve as strong examples to the Israelites and enforce their conformity to the covenant. However, when these special exemplar-executives die, their office often goes vacant, and the Israelites fall back into idolatry. These repeated instances of backsliding are figured as whoredom: "And it came to pass, as soon as Gideon was dead, that the children of Israel again went astray [Hebrew: zanah ("play the harlot; commit fornication")] after the Baalim, and made Baal-berith their god" (Judg 8.33). This scene presumes the Israelites' freedom as the embodied wife of God; they are not His property, locked up by force. Furthermore, they are animated by erotic desire. The Israelites' act of free choice, their following after their desires in choosing the Canaanite Baal as their god, is an essential component of idolatry. (Later, the prophets will argue that this adherence to erotic passion constitutes not freedom but a ridiculous form of slavery.) Following the conception of God in the Decalogue as a face that must be faced, the text figures idolatry as a "turn away" from God: the people face God within the covenant, but they are vulnerable to the pull of neighboring and faraway distractions, away from God. To approach this scene from a literary point of view, we might regard this "turn away" as a trope, a diversion away from an abstract, intangible object of worship (Yahweh) towards a tangible, figurative vehicle that serves to represent deity in a more comprehensible way (the fertility god Baal, figured in statues). Of course, figurative operations are precisely the problem in this new religion and constitute the very idolatry against which the second commandment reacts. This passage from Judges begins to analyze the formidable attrac-</page><page sequence="6">46 Religion &amp; Literature tive force of the pantheistic religions surrounding and pre-dating Hebrew monotheism. The books of the prophets, where the tone is one of impending crisis and punishment, develop the metaphors of whoredom and adultery posited in the earlier books, expanding them into long allegories. The prophets' decidedly masculine voices of judgment, ambiguously overlapping with God's voice, reprimand the feminized nations of Israel and Judah, trying to instill shame and repentance. Ezekiel presents an allegory of idolatry through the story of the many adulterous affairs of the sisters Oholah and Oholibah:10 [TJhere were two women, the daughters of one mother; and they committed har- lotries in Egypt; they committed harlotries in their youth; there were their bosoms pressed, and there their virgin breasts were bruised. And the names of them were Oholah the elder, and Oholibah her sister; and they became Mine, and they bore sons and daughters. And as for their names, Samaria is Oholah, and Jerusalem Oholibah. And Oholah played the harlot when she was Mine; and she doted on her lovers, on the Assyrians, warriors, clothed with blue, governors and rulers, handsome young men all of them, horsemen riding upon horses. And she bestowed her harlotries upon them, the choicest men of Assyria all of them; and on whomsoever she doted, with all their idols she defiled herself. ..Wherefore I delivered her into the hand of her lovers, into the hand of the Assyrians, upon whom she doted. (Ezek 23.2-9) The two figures are women bound to an already established system of regulated sexuality, where virginity is prized and extramarital sex forbidden, presumably in the service of patriarchal and patrilineal social organization. In this way, Yahweh reveals himself as a decidedly patriarchal deity. This passage reveals the tragic irony of the idolater's pursuit: the sensual plea- sures of idolatry eventually betray the idolater to complete ruin. Ezekiel suggests that idolatry is, in its final effects, similar to the experience of rape; idolatry ironically vitiates the freedom that the sisters exercise in their initial turn away from Yahweh. In the space of two sentences, the sisters change from active subjects ("they committed harlotries") to passive victims ("their bosoms were pressed"). In Egypt, the fornication of the sisters resulted in injury and violation, a loss of physical freedom and integrity. They were forced, perhaps against their intentions, into passivity: their breasts were violently "pressed" down by a superior sexual force. The injury specifically to their breasts compromises their maternal capacities. Their adultery/ idolatry hinders their capacity to carry out God's injunction in Genesis to "be fruitful and multiply." The sisters' production of "sons and daughters" in their marriage with God allegorizes the fertility promised to Israel in its several covenants with God. Israel's idolatry, conversely, injures its fertility and enjoyment of prosperity.</page><page sequence="7">CATHERINE E. WINIARSKI 47 Ezekiel's allegory suggests that just as fornication leaves a bruise on the body as a mark of its violence, idolatry leaves a visible, contaminating mark upon the initially pure, virginal surface of the religious subject. The sisters are visibly marked by this crime whose consequences they may not have anticipated; they are openly guilty before God's ever-observant face. In all the prophetic accounts of adultery/ idolatry, the prophet and God himself uncover deeds which may be hidden from human eyes and open them to the full examination of the reader. The adulteress-idolatress may attempt to fold her damaged surface into a hidden interior, invisible to observing eyes. In this way, the harlot may appear virtuous. This infolding of the marked surface ultimately proves futile. The prophet's charge is, in part, to uncover the marked surfaces concealed by the idolater. God tells Oholah that her Assyrian lovers, turned to God's revengers, "shall leave thee naked and bare; and the nakedness of thy harlotries shall be uncovered" (Ezek 23.29). God's omniscient gaze, uncovering what has been concealed, goes hand-in-hand with his role as law-giver and judge. This God must claim to see all in order to judge all. Despite the threat of physical violation that comes with it, idolatry is highly eroticized in Ezekiel's allegory: the attraction of the foreign religions is sensual (especially visual) and romantic. The Assyrians wear luxuriant, exotic fabrics in brilliant colors. They have a horseback-riding culture foreign to the Israelites, now a settled community. They are excellent in military campaigns due to the technological advantage of cavalry; their captains are mentioned in particular. Brilliantly attired and deft on horseback, these Assyrian horsemen cut a romantic, heroic figure. The lure of the exotic, itinerant warrior, a commonplace of heroic romance, is likened to the lure of idolatry. The Assyrians' itinerancy itself seems a threat to the settled belief of Yahweh worship. ' ' A greater threat posed by associating with the exotic warrior or inviting him to enter Israelite culture appears in Jeremiah: "Lift up your eyes, and behold them that come from the north. . .What wilt thou say, when He shall set the friends over thee as head, whom thou thyself hast trained against thee?" (Jer 13.20-21). Here, the Israelites have invited for- eigners into their midst to take part in their military.12 The superior military power of the Assyrian horsemen doubles their attractiveness. However, the prophets hint that these strangers will not remain allies for long; they will soon conquer those who invited them in. God will eventually deliver Israel into the hands of these idolaters in war, as punishment for their association with them and their forms of worship.13 Again, idolatry is conceived as an ultimately self-subversive transgression, a rebellion that ironically subjects the idolater to greater slavery; it seems motivated by a death drive. The threat of violence and political overthrow always accompanies the erotic</page><page sequence="8">48 Religion &amp; Literature attractiveness of the idolater. One of the most notable features of Ezekiel's allegory is its permeable, ambivalent structure, with terms of the figure crossing over to the side of the referent and vice versa. The vehicle (adultery) actually conditions the tenor (idolatry). The two sisters (the figures) are guilty not only of adultery (the figure for idolatry) but of idolatry itself, which seems to follow from their adulterous contact with the idolatrous warriors. Adultery is both a figure for idolatry here and its cause, both metaphor and metonymy. This assertion that sexual contact can transmit religious influence resonates throughout the Hebrew Bible. Deuteronomy forbids intermarriage with the nations driven out of the Promised Land because it is supposed to precipitate idola- try: "For he will turn away thy son from following Me, that they may serve other gods" (Deut 7.4). Sexuality, whether endogamous or exogamous, is a powerful determinant of religious identity. Sexual relations can reinforce religious continuity and identity, if the partners are of the same religion; they can also contaminate and undermine religious identity and integrity, if the partners are of different religions. This passage in Ezekiel also illustrates the temptations of the visual art of neighboring nations, alluding to the prohibitions of the second as well as the first commandment. The threat of idolatry comes not only from the sexual lure of the Assyrian warriors but also their elaborate visual culture, including representations of non-divine beings: "[Oholibah] increased her harlotries; for she saw men portrayed upon the wall, the images of the Chal- deans portrayed with vermilion, girded with girdles upon their loins, with pendant turbans upon their heads. . .And as soon as she saw them she doted upon them" (Ezek 23. 14-16). The prophet's tone turns from condemnatory to satirical here. Kenneth Gross asserts that parody is one of the modes of Hebrew monotheism and iconoclasm as it defines itself against Canaanite and Assyrian iconophilia: "it reveals idolatry as a binding fascination that is entrapment rather than covenant" (33). The idolater has completely lost her senses, lost the ability to distinguish between animate and inanimate objects, and gives erotic attentions to mere images. She permits no delay for the operation of sound judgment; there is no pause between sight and worship. Yahweh worship, however, demands discrimination between the animate and the inanimate, between the living (though invisible) God and the dead (though visually appealing) image. Oholibah 's fascinated, reflexive "doting" on the Chaldean images illustrates the operation of a dead, mechanistic drive in place of an animate desire; it is this mechanistic drive that the idol commands, according to the prophets. Ezekiel censures Oholibah 's choice to give in to this drive, a choice which ironically consigns her to slavery. Ezekiel represents idolatry through an allegory of unreflective sexual</page><page sequence="9">CATHERINE E. WINIARSKI 49 adventure and excess that leads to tragic ruin. Fornication with exotic strangers is the cause of and the model for idolatrous worship. The prophet Jeremiah, by contrast, places an emphasis on the various objects of idolatry in nature: mountains, trees, and stones.14 Jeremiah conceives of idolatry not as sexual excess but as the perversion of nature into sexual objects - fetish- ism. Jeremiah condemns Israel, again feminized, in this way: "she went up upon every high mountain and under every leafy tree, and there played the harlot" (Jer 3.6). The shade of trees and tops of mountains are concealed places, at least to human eyes, where presumably the harlot can escape any judging gaze as she consorts with her lovers. Again, the idolater makes a futile attempt at concealment. Of course, God's penetrating gaze, as well as the prophet's exceptional insight, sees all and uncovers Israel's hidden sins. To interpret the allegory, these mountains, trees, and stones are themselves the false gods that Israel is consorting with in idolatry. Again, the allegory exhibits an ambivalent, double-sided structure. What is a metonym to the adulterous act, within the vehicle of the allegory (and a sign of the Israelites' deviousness in their sin), is the idolatrous object itself within the allegory's tenor. If the pantheism of the tribes surrounding Israel regarded deity as immanent in the earth, in the trees and stones that it worshipped, Jeremiah calls this worship of the land a contaminating fetishism: "and it came to pass through the lightness of her harlotry, that the land was polluted, and she committed adultery with stones and with stocks" (Jer 3.9). Jeremiah firmly sets the natural world apart from the divine. Nature is not the immanent dwelling place of God: God intends it as the source of Israel's prosperity promised in the covenant. The produce of the earth is, to follow the alle- gory, the offspring from the marital relationship between God and Israel. If Israel stays true to the covenant, God fertilizes the earth and produces the offspring that sustain the people; faithfulness to the covenant ensures God as the rightful father of the earth's produce. To worship the earth's produce is to confuse the father with the offspring, figuratively to force the non-sexualized earth into a sexual relationship, which defiles it. Jeremiah 3 refers to Deuteronomic laws of divorce to help guide judg- ment in the case of Israel's adultery and defilement of the land. The chapter opens with a reference to the laws of marriage laid out in Deuteronomy and Leviticus: "If a man put away his wife, and she go from him, and become another man's, may he return unto her again?" (Jer 3. 1). This seems a clear reference to earlier legal texts like Deuteronomy 24, which asserts that a man may divorce his wife "because he hath found some unseemly thing in her" (Deut 24. 1). If she marries another and is again divorced, or if the second husband dies, the first husband may not take her back again: "after that she is defiled" (Deut 24.4). Thus, it seems that the marriage covenant,</page><page sequence="10">50 Religion &amp; Literature once broken by the wife's defilement (presumably through adultery, though other causes seem possible), cannot be renewed. The breach of covenant is irreversible, just as the wife's defilement is irreversible. This secondary law in Deuteronomy, elaborating on the seventh commandment, establishes a definite absolutism in the law. The sin of adultery cannot be redeemed; the marriage cannot be renewed; the broken covenant cannot be resealed. Following the analogy of adultery and idolatry, this marital law would seem to suggest that the Mosaic covenant between God and the Hebrews, once violated, is irreparable. The same narrative of defilement and divorce is told in Jeremiah's history of Israel: "And I saw, when, forasmuch as backsliding Israel had committed adultery, I had put her away and given her a bill of divorcement" (Jer 3.9). However, Jeremiah 3 goes on to mark the limit of the analogy between adultery and idolatry. Here, divine forgiveness and redemption, which technically violate human marriage law, intervene. l5 God suspends the laws applying to human adultery, with regard to Israel's sin of idolatry: "return, thou backsliding Israel, saith the Lord; I will not frown upon you; for I am merciful, saith the Lord, I will not bear grudge for ever" (Jer 3.12). Again, the metaphors of "turn" and "return" appear. While the trope of idolatry carries the subject away from the center of face-to-face contract with God, there is always the possibility of return to that center. This gesture of return carries within it a trace of the initial turning to face God in the Mosaic covenant, but it carries the trace of the turn away as well. The return is historicized as a second covenant. God also allows the possibility of change in the jealous, impassioned temper he proclaimed in the Decalogue: he will not always bear his grudge. There is the possibil- ity of softening and mediation of his justice. God's nature itself becomes contingent and historical, and the covenant remains a historical agreement, subject always to change and reform. This suspension of the law marks God's sovereignty within (and without) the Mosaic code; he is the one, to quote Carl Schmitt, who "decides on the exception." If the law establishes and embodies Israel as the bride of God, that law which establishes the com- munity itself is marked as qualitatively different from the laws that apply to marriage within the already established community. Without the Mosaic covenant, without the contract with God, in the suspended state of divorce from God, the Hebrew community, with its institution of marriage, could not exist as such. Yet there is a troublesome moment in Jeremiah 1 3 which casts doubt on this promise of redemption and renewal of the covenant. After God warns Israel of the threat from their Assyrian chiefs and princes, he poses this puzzling rhetorical question: "Can the Ethiopian16 change his skin, or the leopard his spots? Then may ye also do good, that are accustomed to do</page><page sequence="11">CATHERINE E. WINIARSKI 5 1 evil" (Jer 13.23). Again, the idolater is regarded as visibly and permanently marked by his sin, this time without the potential for re-conversion. In a more extreme metaphor than Ezekiel's bruises, Jeremiah chooses the color black to represent the permanent contamination of an earlier state of purity, represented, by implication, by lighter colors like white. Ania Loomba has noted the iconographic symbolism established in this aphorism: blackness is a metaphor for an unchangeable essence and moreover, for intractable, unredeemable idolatry or apostasy; this color-coding of religious difference sets the stage, she argues, for the invention of modern categories of race. The threatening, heathen outside of Hebrew monotheism is marked with a color code which migrates into Christian culture and eventually into European encounters with Africans.17 Perhaps, given the references to foreigners earlier in Jeremiah 13, the Ethiopian may also represent one more example of an idolatrous neighbor of the Israelites. In this way, the Ethiopian is both an example of idolatry (a synecdoche) and a metaphor for it. This verse suggests that there exists in some a reprobate condition, not essentially inborn but hardened through custom, which cannot be converted or redeemed; there is no possibility of return.18 This disrupts the marriage analogy established in the Decalogue and earlier in Jeremiah, which insists that monotheism is a contract that the subject can enter into, turn away from, and return to. In this case, religious custom, presumably inherited from the culture one is born into, determines the subject absolutely. This verse presents a scandalous exception to the notion of covenantal religion modeled on marriage. Like the heart of stone, the metaphors of the Ethiopian's skin and the leopard's spots suggest an absolute determination that immediately and permanently solidifies the subject's identity into a monad, admitting none of the double- ness or free play seen in the covenantal subject. Apparent Adultery and Incorporational Marriage in the Gospels, Paul, and Augustine The New Testament gospels conserve but radically reform the adultery/ idolatry analogy they inherit from the Hebrew tradition. Joseph's response to Mary's pregnancy in the Book of Matthew is a reference to Deutero- nomic marriage laws: "When as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy Ghost. Then Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not willing to make her a publick example, was minded to put her away privily" {King James Bible, Matt 1.18-9). According to the Deuteronomic law, Joseph is just in deciding to put Mary away for fornication with another man, but the angel of the Lord</page><page sequence="12">52 Religion &amp; Literature suspends this law, calling him to take her back. Here, the human husband, Joseph, is cuckolded by God himself. Mary, a new kind of religious subject, accepts the shame of adulterous reputation, concealing the greater glory of marriage to God and impregnation by him. She is a sort of comic inverse of the tragic Old Testament adulteress who conceals her guilt only to be exposed by God. Crucially, Mary only appears to be an adulteress (or, prop- erly, a disloyal fiancee) from a limited, human point of view; divine insight, granted to Joseph, reveals her to be God's holy vessel, chosen especially for his incarnation. Joseph's sainthood, we might say, is to receive the title of cuckold as a blessing. The Christ event can be understood as a dismantling of and a crossing between the two sides of the analogy between marriage and the Mosaic covenant: God, the figurative husband of Israel, has at this moment crossed over to the opposite side of the analogy, entering into the human world as a divine adulterer, breaking, in paradigmatic fashion, the human laws of marital monogamy to establish a new covenant and a new relationship with his people. God breaks the law of marital monogamy and breaks the analogy between monotheism and marriage in order to become the literal impregnator of Mary. This conception of God as divine adulterer shares much with the Greek and Roman conception of Zeus/Jupiter and may even derive from it. Zeus' many affairs with human maidens such as Europe, Io, and Danae mark Greco-Roman paganism as a pantheistic re- ligion, in which deity is immanent in creation. The impregnation of Mary by God and the incarnation of Christ moderate the transcendence of the Hebrew God and grant him some of the immanence of the Greco-Roman gods. In this way, Christianity negotiates between the competing myths and logics of its predecessors, Judaism and Greco-Roman pantheism. In Mark 10, the Deuteronomic law of divorce, invoked momentarily against Mary, is overturned by Jesus himself. The Pharisees refer to Moses to defend the practice of divorce, but Jesus nevertheless strikes down the law, asserting it to be a law fit only for fallen idolaters: For the hardness of your heart he wrote you this precept. But from the beginning of the creation God made them male and female. For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and cleave to his wife; And they twain shall be one flesh: so then they are no more twain, but one flesh. . .Whosoever shall put away his wife, and marry another, committeth adultery against her. (Mark 10:5-12) Jesus upholds the standard of an eternal, unbreakable covenant. Appealing to origins in Genesis, the origin of sexual difference itself, Jesus affirms that the marriage contract is unbreakable, in that marriage joins the two sexes into a united whole, even at the level of material flesh. In the logic of this interpretation, God creates sexual difference in the service of a unified whole</page><page sequence="13">CATHERINE E. WINIARSKI 53 subsequently created and sustained in marriage. God created them male and female in order ultimately to overcome that difference in the oneness of marriage. According to this argument, God granted the precept of divorce to the Israelites as a mark of their lapse from the covenant, their "hardness of heart," clearly a reference to the stony heart of the idolater in the prophetic books. Jesus reverses Jeremiah's logic here: in Jesus' account, divorce law was established by God in response to the Israelites' hardened (idolatrous) hearts, thus matching a new human law to an already fallen religious condition. Jew- ish divorce law is a sign of religious apostasy already committed. Jeremiah, on the other hand, suggests that God's divorce of Israel was patterned on a pre-existing human law of divorce. Jesus' charge of hardness of heart, in this case perhaps irreversible, is part of the Christian condemnation of the Jews as recalcitrant bodies that resist incorporation into the one Christian body. In this new Christian context, they have become the "Ethiopians" unable to change their skin: hardened and unredeemable. The redeemed subject's "heart of flesh" (from Ezekiel) is echoed here, but further, the union of flesh in the sexual relation becomes a new model for the religious relationship. The religious subject is created as different from God only to be melded with him in the unity of the religious covenant, now much more than a contract: an incorporation. The two elements joined in the covenant become a single, new compound substance, incapable of being broken down again. The initial liquidity of the subject is mixed inextricably with God's substance, then solidified and sealed. After such a mutual incorporation, division is literally impossible (and thus divorce is impermissible). The law, which establishes divisions, dissolves away here. This conception of the mar- riage relationship is a radical re-writing of the face-to-face confrontation of God and subject in the Mosaic covenant, where the freedom to turn away and return, and the essential difference between God and subject implied in it, is always present. In Ephesians, the Pauline author reaffirms this material incorporation of the two partners in marriage, specifying the precise organization of husband and wife in the incorporated body. Here, Christ's self-sacrifice for the church initiates a reformed marriage contract between God and people. Christ offers his people not material offspring in return for service and obedience but self- sacrifice for their preservation and sanctification, and love, a spiritual union with himself which is modeled on physical incorporation. As the old contract provided, the wife is subject to the husband's law as the people are subject to Christ's authority: "Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body. . .Husbands, love [Greek: agapao] your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave</page><page sequence="14">54 Religion &amp; Literature himself for it" (Eph 5.22-5). The Pauline author adds another layer to the Hebrew analogy: the material incorporation of husband and wife as head and member of one body. This notion of material incorporation in mar- riage is arguably enabled by the material incarnation of Christ. And now, the obligation of the body's members to obey the directing reason of the head strengthens the binding force of the marriage covenant (the religious subject's obligation to fulfill her side of the contract).19 This theory vitiates the freedom of the religious subject to turn away and return; in fact, it pre- empts adultery/idolatry altogether. Conversion entails a radical change of substance and form: the transformation of a body whole unto itself into merely one member of a whole body. The incorporation of wife and hus- band turns marital love into a species of self-love. Echoing Leviticus' "love thy neighbor as thyself," the text proclaims, "[s]o ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his wife loveth himself. For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord the church" (Eph 5.28). Christ's love for the church could likewise be explained as love for a self that has been enlarged into the corporate church. His body and blood are literally incorporated into them and gather them into a single, mystical body. The whole community of Christians is embodied as the various (feminized) members of Christ's mystical body. 1 Corinthians develops this vision of Christian incorporation: "That there should be no schism in the body; but that the members should have the same care one for another. And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it" (1 Cor 12.25-6). This commonality of feeling constitutes agape or charity, a charity which, according to Paul, is greater than the gift of the prophets. For Paul, this marriage with Christ and incorporation into his body rep- resents the second marriage of the religious subject, after the death of her first spouse and her liberation from him. In Romans, Paul conceives of the Christ event and its suspension of the old "law of sin" through the analogy of a widow's remarriage: For the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth; but if the husband be dead, she is loosed from the law of her husband. So then if, while her husband liveth, she be married to another man, she shall be called an adulteress: but if her husband be dead, she is free from that law; so that she is no adulteress, though she be married to another man. Wherefore, my brethren, ye also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ; that ye should be married to another, even to him who is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit unto God. (Rom 7.2-4) Paul refers to established Hebrew law concerning marriage and the condi- tions of re-marriage in order to present his vision of the new religious sub-</page><page sequence="15">CATHERINE E. WINIARSKI 55 ject. Rather than providing the terms that dictate the relationship between husband and wife, the law itself is the husband of the religious subject. In her first marriage, to the old law of the letter and sin, the feminine religious subject is truly subjected to that husband, "bound" to a mechanistic desire to commit sin.20 It is perhaps more accurate to say that both the husband and wife in this marriage are internalized in the religious subject. However, the Christ event kills this oppressive husband, the law of the letter and sin, within the religious subject.21 In so doing, Christ abolishes the distinction of adulteress, a distinction created by the old law. The "new creature" con- ceived here, a Hebrew subject renewed in Christ, consists of the widow of the old law, remarried to the resurrected Christ and the revived law of the spirit he represents. This new subject is released from subjection to the old law; she is now "free" from that law. Paul dwells upon the offspring of the two marriages: the children of the first marriage were of the flesh (sin and death); the children of the second were of the spirit (faith and everlast- ing life). The first marriage is regarded as infertile, while the second bears "fruits." In this way, the Hebrew marriage covenant, Yahweh's original promise of fertility and prosperity in return for faithful service, is retained, though reinterpreted, by Paul. 1 Corinthians offers a crucial revision of the Hebrew doctrine of marital and religious purity. On the matter of inter-faith marriage, Paul dismisses the threat of religious contamination: "If any brother hath a wife that believeth not, and she be pleased to dwell with him, let him not put her away. And the woman which hath an husband that believeth not, and if he be pleased to dwell with her, let her not leave him. For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband" (1 Cor 7.12-14). In Paul's account, marriage can serve as a vehicle of conversion to belief and the incorporation of converts into the body of Christ. The sanctified believer can spread his or her faith through the marital relationship. The prophets regarded the monotheism of Yahweh as subject to contamination by outside religions, by way of sexual contact between Israelites and heathens. Paul, by contrast, grants this contagious power (here a positive power) to his Christian faith; it can penetrate and convert idolaters and non-believers; sexual relations, as long as they are within marriage, are a positive conduit for the religion. Pauline Christian- ity takes on the contagious, sexualized power the prophets granted to the pagan religions, though Paul may call this power agape and not eros. As 1 Corinthians suggests, Pauline Christianity attempts to integrate those who were regarded as strangers and idolaters by prophetic Judaism. In Ephesians, the Pauline author explicitly declares the conversion of former strangers to citizens and members of God's household: "Now therefore ye</page><page sequence="16">56 Religion &amp; Literature are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellow citizens with the saints, and of the household [Greek: oikeios] of God" (Eph 2.19). This passage alludes to the Jewish understanding of the Greeks, as much as the Canaanites and Assyrians, as idolatrous strangers, outside the enclosed space of the Judaic covenant. It clearly alludes to the Hebrew notion of God's household, his position as husband married to his feminized religious subjects, enclosing them within a centered, domestic space. The Pauline author employs the prophetic vocabulary of "near" and "far": "But now in Christ Jesus ye who sometimes were far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ" (Eph 2. 13). These old distinctions of "near" and "far" are erased as all become "near" through Christ.22 Roman citizenship, which could be granted to those not born into the Roman nation or citizenship, is one available model of com- munity membership, which enables this incorporation of far to near. The Roman Empire certainly becomes a model for the expansive Christian community, reaching beyond its ethnic origins to incorporate people of many nations.23 The space of prophetic Judaism is therefore radically re- zoned this in conception of Christianity: if the Judaism of the Decalogue and the prophets was centripetal, settled, and vulnerable to contagion from the outside, Pauline Christianity is by contrast centrifugal, expansive, and contagious to the outside. In this reconceptualized space, we might say that there is no longer any stranger with whom to commit adultery or idolatry. Alternatively, we might say that the Christian mission is a kind of sanctified adultery that converts the heathen and gathers him into God's household. Another theorist of the new Christian subject and community, Augus- tine exhibits a relationship to paganism far closer to that of the Hebrew prophets than to that of Paul. In many ways, Augustine performs the same function for Christianity that Ezekiel and Jeremiah performed for Judaism. He develops a logic of inside and outside, defining Christianity against its heathen neighbors and predecessors. Like the prophets, Augustine grants religious significance to marriage and adultery. Jupiter's numerous adulteries are proof to Augustine either of his not meriting worship as a god or to the error of the legends that attempt to depict him. Marital and extramarital sex on the part of the female (again conceived as the model religious subject) is crucial symbolic material for Augustine, as for the prophets. However, Augustine draws a line between Greco-Roman culture and Christianity in their respective attitudes to rape rather than consensual adultery. Augustine marks this change from pagan to Christian ideology when he compares the famous Roman lady, Lucretia, to the Christian women raped during the captivity of Rome: Being a Roman lady excessively eager for praise, [Lucretia] feared that, if she re-</page><page sequence="17">CATHERINE E. WINIARSKI 57 mained alive, she would be thought to have enjoyed suffering the violence that she had suffered when she lived. Hence, she judged that she must use self-punishment to exhibit the state of her mind to the eyes of men to whom she could not show her conscience... But this is not what those Christian women did who suffered in the same way yet are still alive... Within themselves, indeed, by the testimony of their own conscience, they have the glory of chastity Moreover, they have it in the sight of God, and they require nothing more. (3 1 ) Both the Hebrew prophets and Augustine perform the prophetic function of disconcealment. In their systems of thought, the religious subject consists of a surface, visible to public view, and a secret depth, visible only to the subject herself, to God, and to the privileged view of the prophet. While the Hebrew prophets' charge was to disenchant the innocent appearance of the adulteress and reveal the secret traces of her sin, Augustine seeks to rescue the chaste interior of the Christian subject from the public ap- pearance of disgrace. This depth model of the subject may be Augustine's inheritance from the prophets. The double-layered Christian subject stands in stark contrast to the pagan subject, represented for Augustine by Lucretia. Lucretia appears as a simple monad, entirely innocent or entirely guilty. She is determined absolutely by her public appearance, her body which is entirely vulnerable to the contamination of rape; she has no inner being which might escape this contamination. Augustine's Christianity reforms the paramount Greco-Roman values of public fame and praise, by which immortality was sought. Immortality, for Augustine, is earned through a private contract with God, overseen by him alone. Love of public fame now borders on a vice, and fame itself becomes an idol. Augustine's new model for the Christian subject applies well to the Virgin Mary, who, accepting the status of adulteress in human eyes, was glorified by the Angel Gabriel and eventually exalted to a station near to that of Christ himself. The Adultery Plot: Religion and Literature in the Renaissance If we examine the relationship between religion and literature in the European Renaissance, we find that religious and cultural authorities of- ficially denounce the pagan content of Greco-Roman texts as idolatrous folly but conserve those texts as secular literature within "the liberal arts," entirely separate from accepted Christian theology and practice.24 Thus, Greek tragedy, originally composed and performed in honor of Dionysus, is stripped of its original religious significance and relegated to the sphere of natural and temporal wisdom. The realm of the liberal arts represents the state of suspension in which Greco-Roman materials are held. Inside and outside at the same time, Greco-Roman culture is exclusively included in</page><page sequence="18">58 Religion &amp; Literature Renaissance Christian culture. One of the most formidable pressures on the English dramatists of the Elizabethan period was the gradual ban on Christian subject matter in the 1 560's and 1 570's, a ban inspired by Calvin- ist iconoclasm; this was one more effort to keep the spheres of liberal arts and religion separate.25 What dramatists and audiences were being asked to do, in a sense, was to repress their desire for religious representation (now regarded as idolatrous desire) and re-channel it into classical or secu- lar representation. Of course, Freud's theory of repression insists that the instinct is never entirely suppressed - it always returns in disguised form. Today we acknowledge the influence of religious ideas on the "secular" drama of Elizabethan England, even though the authorities at the time tried to keep these spheres strictly separate. I would suggest that Hebrew and Christian theologies and theories of religious subjectivity function as more than mere contexts for works of literature, "context" implying an ex- ternal, clearly-defined discourse that exerts influence on the content of the drama. Despite the efforts of reformers to suppress their performance and visual representation, Judaic and Christian ideas like the marriage of God and people or the smashing of the pagan idol beg for enactment and dra- matization, and their plots infuse, complicate, and reinvigorate the classical genres, especially tragedy and comedy. In this way, goods smuggled in from the Judeo-Christian canons enrich the old treasuries of classical literature in order to create the new hybrid we call Renaissance literature. Judeo-Christian figures and plots may have been locked out of the newly constituted secular-classical drama, but they continued to haunt it. Thus, inside the romantic hero is the threatening, nomadic Assyrian idolater. Under the surface of a revived Helen or Lucretia are Aholah and Mary. Behind Niobe, Medusa, Galatea, and other objects of Ovidian metamorphosis is the Hebrew who changes from flesh to stone and back again. The tragic figures of Othello and Tamburlaine can be better understood by considering the threat of idolatry and violence that the prophets attributed to the romantic nomad. Characters like Shakespeare's Desdemona and Webster's Vittoria Corombona exhibit an ambiguity that comes from the complex interplay between the types of the heathen adulteress and Christian "apparent adul- teress." The transformation of Hermione at the end of The Winter's Tale cannot be fully understood without considering both Ovidian and Hebrew metamorphosis. The Judaic and Christian conceptions of religious sub- jectivity as marriage to God or Christ resonate with the classical comedic plot and its resolution in marriage and a reformed society. For example, the Pauline narrative of marriage between old and new Christians fortifies the classical comedic plot of Act I of Othello, in which a youthful couple defeats the opposition of a conservative old father. The declared others of</page><page sequence="19">CATHERINE E. WINIARSKI 59 Judaism and Christianity, whether Canaanite and Assyrian pantheism (for Judaism) or Greco-Roman paganism and Judaism (for Christianity), which are associated with folly and pride by the religions opposing them, resonate with the tragic plot and its conclusion in personal and social ruin. Jeremiah's figure of the "Ethiopian" or "Black More," long accustomed to idolatry and impossible to convert, illuminates the tragic fall of Shakespeare's "noble Moor," whose suspicions "stone" his heart and who transforms his wife into an idol of "smooth alabaster." This play is witness to a renewed religious function for comedy and tragedy, despite their restriction to the sphere of the liberal arts and the de-activation of their original functions within pagan culture. Renaissance drama performs a secret marriage between religion and literature, unsettling the militant efforts of reformed religious authorities to divorce them. University of California, Irvine NOTES 1 . It is worth noting that in the ancient Near East, adultery was defined as "sexual intercourse by mutual consent between a married woman and a man who is not her lawful husband" (Sarna 1 14). According to Sarna, while adultery was regarded as a private offense in ancient Egypt and Ugarit, it was viewed also as a public and sacral offense in Israel. 2. References to the Hebrew Bible are to The Holy Scriptures according to the Masoretic Text, theJPS translation of 1917. 3. The commentaries of rabbis Ibn Ezra and Sforno address this all-pervading presence and watchfulness of God: "I am Omnipresent; wherever idolatry is practiced, it is before My presence" (qtd. in Feuer 29). 4. The enumeration of the commandments has been a matter of serious disagreement among the various inheritors of the Hebrew Bible. The Jewish tradition separates the prohibition against polytheism from the prohibition against image worship. The Catholic Christian tradition combines them, regarding image worship as a species of idolatry gener- ally. The reformed religion under Calvin returns to the Jewish count. This recuperative analysis of the Decalogue was directed specifically at the idolatry these reformers perceived in the image veneration practiced in the Catholic Church. See Aston 371-92. 5. Gross distinguishes between the Platonic and the biblical distaste for representation in this way: "While, for Plato, representations fall short because they are subject to the flux of time and opinion, the historicizing emphasis of the Bible suggests that it is the very delusive stillness and fixity of the idolatrous image or word which betray both the flux of human imagination and divine revelation" (30). Zizek argues that the target of Jewish iconoclasm</page><page sequence="20">60 Religion &amp; Literature may in fact be its own anthropomorphism of God, evidenced in God's creation of man "according to [his] own image" (104). Judaism is thus, according to Zizek, determined by its own negation of divine anthropomorphism. 6. The newJPS translation of qanna' as "impassioned" emphasizes, even more than the Geneva, King James, and 1917 JPS translations of "jealous," God's affective invest- ment in his covenant with Israel. Feuer notes Rabban Gamliel's response to a non-Jewish philosopher's wonder that God should be jealous of vain idols: "This divine jealousy can be compared to a husband who marries a second wife in addition to his first spouse. If the second wife is superior to the first in every way, then the first wife has no legitimate cause for jealousy. But if the second wife is inferior, the first wife will be infuriated" (qtd. in Feuer 33). This analogy is notable in that the genders attributed to God and Israel are reversed from their traditional form: God is feminized as the first wife of a masculinized and polygamous nation of Israel. 7. For a discussion of Tertullian, Calvin, and the English Reformation iconoclasts' per- ception of the symmetry between the first and second halves of the Decalogue, see Aston. Lupton also discusses this symmetry in Afterlives of the Saints (185-96). 8. Boose observes that Deuteronomic law allows for the wife accused of premarital intercourse to display before the city's elders a "vesture" testifying to her virginity, as a defense against the accusation. She notes that the Geneva Bible glosses "vesture" as "the shete, wherein the signes of her virginitie were" (qtd. in Boose 58). 9. On this strange effect of transubstantiation, see also Psalm 1 15, wherein the deaf, dumb, and blind idol transmits its qualities to the idolater: "They that make them shall be like unto them; yea, every one that trusteth in them" (Ps. 1 15.8). 1 0. Greenberg's commentary on Ezekiel notes that the two sisters' names, Aholah ("her tent" or sanctuary) and Aholibah ("my tent in her"), refer to the idolatrous sanctuary of Sa- maria and the holy sanctuary of Jerusalem respectively (474). 11. Citing Karl Jaspers, Bentley notes that the so-called Axial Age (800-200 B.C.E.) was characterized by the defensive response of settled societies to the threat presented by nomadic societies with which they came into contact. In the Middle East at this time, the Hebrew prophets represented precisely this protective legal and philosophical attitude. Bentley notes that it was perhaps the Assyrians, the very targets of the prophets, who "had first recognized the potential of cavalry formations" and began to threaten the more settled civilizations in their area (24). 12. Greenberg asserts that the historical "liaison" between Israel and Assyria consisted in part of offerings of tribute by Kings Jehu and Joash to Assyrian kings in the eight and ninth centuries BCE, in return for confirmation of their reigns and defense against Aramean incursions (475). 13. Walzer examines the problem of collective punishment in the prophetic books: Ezekiel and Jeremiah, in their prophecies of total destruction, stand in stark contrast to Abraham, who pleads with God for the rescue of a righteous remnant from the wholesale destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah. The notion of collective punishment would seem to follow from the incorporation of all the Israelites into one body, the bride of God. The al- legory itself sets up this particular problem. 14. In his commentary on Jeremiah, Lundbom notes that the tree was associated with the Canaanite fertility goddess Asherah; at sacred sites, trees or wood poles were placed next to stone altars or pillars, associated with male fertility and the father-god El(284-5). 15. Carroll suggests that the "deuteronomists" (exilic and post-exilic editors ofjeremiah) may have introduced the themes of return and redemption in to Jeremiah's text. The deuter- onomists, Carroll argues, used Jeremiah (and distorted his message of impending absolute</page><page sequence="21">CATHERINE E. WINIARSKI 6 1 doom) in order to reconsolidate the community in exile and after. 1 6. The original Hebrew is Cushi (after Cush, son of Ham), used customarily in the Bible to refer to the inhabitants of Ethiopia. Though not present in Genesis, the myth of Ham asserts that his descendents were cursed with black skin for their father's sin of sexual excess. The Kingjames Bible, along with the 191 7JPS version, translates this term as "Ethiopian." However, the Geneva Bible of 1560 translates it as "blacke More." These two translations represent very different conceptions of religious and cultural difference. 1 7. In his analysis of the biblical story of Ham as well as the Greek myth of Phaeton, Little concludes that "these typifying examples assume that whiteness functions as the originary truth and that blackness signifies some later horror, a kind of accident or aberration" (308). Little emphasizes the association of blackness with lost identity in these sources. 1 8. Confronting a commonplace reading of this passage, Lundbom stresses that Jeremiah does not claim here that sin is innate. Rather, the claim is that sin that has become deeply ingrained by teaching and custom is as difficult to reverse as an innate condition (687). 19. Boyarin notes that Paul's dualism permits him to promote gender hierarchy in some passages and deny it in others. Marriage, marked by the dominance of male over female as head over members, must persist at the level of the flesh while androgyny and the equality that comes with it exist at the level of the spirit. Paul thus allows marriage and even praises it as a metaphor for the relationship between Christ and his church, even while maintaining celibacy as the physical practice which best approaches the spiritual ideal (194-5). 20. In his explication of Paul's Letter to the Romans, Badiou explains that, for Paul, the law creates a form of desire that is "automatized" and can express itself only through transgression of the law (79). 2 1 . Agamben comments on how Paul is able to rescue the goodness of the law, never opposing law to faith. Paul does not negate the law so much as divide it: the law of faith vs. the law of works. In Agamben's words, Paul sets the "promissive" element of the law against the "normative" element. It is the normative law which is "de-activated" by the coming of the Christ (88-99). 22. Badiou explains Paul's understanding of Jewish and Greek discourses in terms of exception and totality: "In the eyes of Paul the Jew, the weakness of Jewish discourse is that its logic of the exceptional sign is only valid for the Greek cosmic totality. The Jew is the exception to the Greek. The result is, firstly, that neither of the two discourses can be universal, because each supposes the persistence of the other" (42). 23. Although circumcision (not the literal custom but the displaced "circumcision of the heart") provides another model to Paul for the conversion of Gentiles to "citizens with the saints," the model of citizenship in the Roman Empire best expresses the expansiveness of Paul's conception of the Christian community. Lupton asserts that in the Letter to the Romans, Paul refers to "the Roman juridical and political framework as a map, model, and shelter for [his] universalism" (Citizen Saints 37). 24. Frye asserts that m the sixteenth century, the spheres of "natural truth" (revealed in the Greco-Roman classics) and theology (revealed in the Christian scriptures) could exist side-by-side, though they should not be confused. The "liberal arts" (i.e., the classics) were also regarded as essential preparation for the study of theology and for the professions. Frye shows that reformers such as Luther, far from calling for the abolishment of classical studies, called for their fortification against scholastic teaching. The curriculum at Calvin's University of Geneva was rooted not in theology but in the classics. 25. For a good historical account of the elimination of medieval biblical drama during the early years of Elizabeth's reign, see O'Connell. He notes that while extant records do not mention a specific church or government policy banning religious subjects on the stage,</page><page sequence="22">62 Religion &amp; Literature "it is clearly the case that individual bishops and archbishops, most likely at the direction of the crown, oversaw the elimination of play cycles in the late 1560s and through the 1570s" (20). This research documents the gradual disappearance of biblical dramas from stages around England during this period. WORKS CITED Agamben, Giorgio.
