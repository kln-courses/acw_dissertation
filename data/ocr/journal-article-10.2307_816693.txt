<plain_text><page sequence="1">Twenty Hours of Activities in Vocabulary Building for High Potential Students Wilma Clark Vocabulary is not learned in lists, and yet it would be a mistake to reject all systematic word study in the English classroom. Students do need help in in- creasing both their recognition and use of vocabu- laries. In a class I recently taught, I attempted to de- velop effective methods for improving students' language power through a mix of abstract learning and concrete application in the daily lessons. In the vocabulary class, for students age thirteen through eighteen, in a summer institute for high po- tential children, each of the ten two-hour sessions began with a drill and quiz on roots, affixes, and definitions. Each session was highlighted by activi- ties so students were able to incorporate the words into their repertoire. Parents, who had paid for the course, and stu- dents were delighted by the pace and variety in the class as well as by all the words students were learn- ing. Admittedly, this was not a typical schoolroom situation. A group of bright and eager adolescents electing to attend a vocabulary class on hot July af- ternoons is not normal, at least in my experience. But teachers in various kinds of classrooms may find some ideas here worth adapting and modifying. The Core: Drill and Quiz on Assigned Words with Goals Individually Set Our text was a paperback, Word Power Made Easy by Norman Lewis (New York: Pocket Books, 1978, rev. ed.). The chief merit of the book is its etymological approach through which students see that learning the meaning of one root (e.g., anthropos-mankind) unlocks the meanings of many words (e.g., anthropol- ogy, misanthrope, philanthropic, anthropomorphic, anthropo- centric). Another strength of the book is that Lewis discusses words; students learn not only definitions but also contexts in which a word can be used. For example, tactiturn and tacit both denote absence of speaking, but taciturn describes a person while tacit describes an understanding, an agreement, a refusal. It is useful for students to read that "a person is never called tacit." Lewis also provides numerous exercises (with answer keys) in each chapter, so that the reader can examine words from many angles and understand them more completely. (I chose this text because it is pedagogically the best I've seen, but teachers should be warned about Lewis' occa- sional use of rather tasteless examples aimed, I sup- pose, to amuse an adult audience.) I divided the book into ten sections, assigning a large chunk of material to be studied for each class meeting. The problem was deciding how much ma- terial to expect students to master. There would be no grade or credit in class, there would be a wide range in age, and students would differ in motiva- tion. Some would want to work assiduously, even to cram, for upcoming SAT or ACT tests. Others would want no more than a vacation-time enrich- ment experience. I didn't want to dampen enthusi- asm, but I knew the class would benefit from some device to structure their learning. The solution that came to me was entitled "the System" by the class. They liked it, primarily be- cause it gave them a way to measure learning while allowing each one to decide how hard to work. With our supplies allocation I bought each stu- dent a small file box, a packet of 3" X 5" file cards, and a set of alphabetical index guides. Each day, students were to look through the assigned pages in the textbook to decide which words they wanted to learn. For each word a file card was to be made: the 16 English Journal</page><page sequence="2">word correctly spelled, correct pronunciation in any notation understood by the student, definition, syn- onyms, helpful notes on history of the word or root meaning, and a sentence using the word. On the re- verse side of the card, the word alone was to appear, permitting students alone or in pairs to study their words in flash-card style. We decided on a minimum of five words each day with no maximum. Students would decide which words they wanted to learn and how many. In finding words, students were not re- stricted to the textbook but were encouraged to nail down meanings of new words encountered in read- ing, in conversation, or on TV. We discussed goals and the importance of con- sistency in the study plan. Would they set a goal of so many words per day? Would they set a temporal goal, promising to study vocabulary one hour a day? Or would they attempt to be thorough, to master all words in every assignment no matter how long it took? I asked each student to write an inclass jour- nal entry specifying goals and describing a system- atic plan for study throughout the course. Occasion- ally, I asked them to write briefly in their journals about whether or not they were satisfied with their progress. Quizzes were needed to provide the students a check on their own learning, but the quizzes had to accommodate the individualized learning plan. I told the class to bring the file boxes to class each day, five cards would be chosen at random, and they would be tested on the words drawn. Words on cards in the box were thus to be those which they had chosen to learn and which they really knew. It worked. Each day we sat in a circle. I'd say, "Pass your box to the person on your left" or "to the second person on your right." Then, "From the box you received, choose any five word cards. Star each card you draw [to insure that the student would be tested on five new words each day]. Write the stu- dent's name on the board, and underneath it list the five words you drew. Be sure to spell these words cor- rectly." (There is a difference, after all, between ety- mology and entomology.) I gave out paper and asked for brief definitions of each word. Further requests varied slightly from day to day: "Use each word in a complete sentence" or "Working with the word from your list which I have asterisked, write a paragraph illustrating a use of the word." Students found that creating a setting for a word helped them toward a real and permanent un- derstanding of the word. The class delighted in hearing these paragraphs read aloud before I col- lected the quizzes. The many word lists on the board provided a rich source of material for spontaneous drill. After col- lecting the answer sheets, I would quiz the students orally in various ways. A good strategy was to ask the class to identify a word on the board which they did not know. The student who had contributed that word would then explain its meaning and an- swer our questions about it. The Journal The writing-across-the-curriculum movement is showing us how valuable journal writing can be in any subject. In "Journal Writing across the Curricu- lum" (Classroom Practices in Teaching English 1979- 1980: How to Handle the Paper Load, Urbana, Illinois: NCTE, 1979, pp. 15-22), Toby Fulwiler explains how informal writings (sometimes as homework, of- ten in class) help students explore new ideas, dis- February 1981 17</page><page sequence="3">cover meaning, verbalize concepts precisely. The journal is also a valuable aid to classroom dynamics. A five-minute written response to a specific question at the beginning of class can rein in attention and give students time to connect their thoughts, result- ing in good discussion with maximum participation. A mid-class writing can calm a class, change the pace, focus a discussion that has become confused, quite a monopolizer. An end-of-class writing allows reflection and synthesis of material covered. The journal served these purposes in our vocabu- lary class. We wrote in the journal two or three times during every two-hour session. After an ex- hilarating role-play session, the room felt awkward, with everyone up high, needing a transition to more normal classroom procedure. A journal item-"De- scribe how you felt during the role-playing activ- ity"--did the trick. Rapport Writing serves many wholesome functions in a class. It can certainly be a vehicle of communication among participants. Notes to the Teacher I started doing this about a year ago in methods classes and faculty workshops. At the end of the first session and then periodically at the end of a class, I give out half sheets of paper and ask for a brief re- sponse. "What do you like? What are you dis- gruntled about? What do you hope we get to before the class is finished? Tell me anything you think I, as teacher of this class, should know." Signatures are optional. Positive comments at the end of the first day will produce a surge of creative energy that will surprise even the most confident teacher. Such notes also help work out the kinks before problems magnify. "Too much talking, not enough doing," one boy wrote in the vocabulary class. I immediately planned more movement, more physical activity for the younger students. "You are asking us to go beyond the call of duty!" they protested, unani- mously, at the end of the seventh session because they did not want to sing. I had asked everyone to produce a song featuring a vocabulary word in a context of music and rhyme. The plan was to video- tape the performances. But since the protest seemed genuine and since they had been such good sports about everything else, I changed the assignment for videotaping: song, poem, or three-member-cast skit. The result was that while I read a poem, everyone in the class chose to do a skit. Class Log A wonderful idea I've seen recently in National Writing Project teacher workshops. Each day two members of the class are asked to observe as well as participate, to take notes on both the content cov- ered in the class and the interaction among class members. Each recorder is given a ditto master and is asked to make something in writing that reflects the content and feel of the class session. Illustrations are optional. These log entries are dittoed and dis- tributed during class the following day. They pro- duce a delightful interaction among class members as well as a record of the substance of the course. (This is also writing for a real audience, one more way to do writing without creating a paper load for the teacher. In fact, grading by the teacher would be absolutely out of place.) Activities Using the Words The students soon came to look upon the creative activity as the dessert of the class. In planning, I looked for projects that would enhance word learn- ing and rejected ideas, no matter how appealing, in which too much creative energy went into artistic production. I've seen attractive amelioration and pejo- ration banners, for example, made by embroidering words onto 6" X 6" pieces of fabric which are then appliqued to colorful burlap. Lovely to look at and enjoyable to make, but the few words learned do not justify, in a vocabulary class at least, the long hours spent in sewing. Below is a list of ten activities that the class enjoyed and that, I believe, helped them to incorporate new words into their active vocabu- laries. Teach a Word In a letter to students prior to the first class, I asked them to be alert to new words in reading and con- versation, to track down the meaning of one new word, and to come to the first class ready to explain the meaning of that word and the situation in which it was discovered. "Ifyou explain it to someone else, you are likely to remember it," I stressed. I offered an ex- ample, which happened to be avuncular, a new word to me when I saw it describing Walter Cronkite in a New Yorker cartoon. Our first class opened with a get-acquainted ac- 18 English Journal</page><page sequence="4">tivity. The class formed pairs, who interviewed one another. Person A talked for five minutes, telling the partner some biographical information and explain- ing the new word as described above. Then Person B talked for five minutes, doing the same. Next the class formed a large circle. Person A introduced B to the entire class, reported some biographical data, wrote B's word on the board (correctly spelled), pro- nounced it correctly, and explained its meaning and the situation in which B had encountered the word. Then B did likewise for A. As students took their turns, I interrupted period- ically, quizzing one and then another about the names of all students introduced so far and about the meanings of words on the board. The activity ended with a journal session on one of the words on the board. Draw a Word Root I gave each student a word root discussed in our up- coming assignment, a transparency, and access to marking pens of various colors. The student was to write the root, draw a picture that would help fix its meaning for all of us, and list words built from that root. Students then used the overhead projector to show and explain their transparencies. Psyche was a butterfly. Cheir, chiro was a tapered hand, adorned with rings, bracelet, and bright red nail polish. Or- thos, to straighten, was an arrow. Pathos took the form of the bereaved Juliet beside the dead Romeo. This activity was most effective. Each multi- colored drawing flashed across the screen, pierced the imagination, and left a permanent image. Write Test Items One of the best ways to learn material thoroughly, as teachers know, is to write an objective test. Trying to avoid ambiguous questions forces the test writer to examine details from the perspective of the test taker. From a commercial book on preparing for the SAT, I extracted models for three types of vo- cabulary questions: antonyms, sentence completion, and analogies. Working in pairs, students wrote one test item of each type, frequently using words we had studied. I had the questions typed up as a test (with writers of each item identified), and we tried the test during the next class. The class log that day revealed the challenge students had found in the test writing exercise: "It was hard, but good, because we really had to think about the words, especially in the analogies part." Transcribe a Fairy Tale The objectives here were to practice using a the- saurus and, as always, to have a good time. Students brought a book of fairy tales and a thesaurus to class. Working alone or in pairs, they chose a fairy tale, rewrote it in their own words, and substituted in at least twenty instances a word found in the the- saurus for a word in the fairy tale. They worked fu- riously and became almost giddy. Everyone wanted to read aloud. In addition, we had all the stories typed in a small booklet and distributed to everyone in the class. The reader may recognize some of these titles: "Bullion Bristles and the Trio of Carnivores," "The Sovereign's Neoteric Garments, " "The Noble- woman and the Legume." (The ideas for this activ- ity and the one after the next are borrowed from a workshop conducted by Cindi Nielsen and Robert Skaife, two middle school teachers, at the Wisconsin Council of Teachers of English Annual Meeting, April 25, 1980.) Write a Cumulative Sentence To provide materials for this activity, I asked the class to bring items that moved and/or made noise (e.g., wind-up toy, music box, wind chimes). I showed them examples of the cumulative sentence (short base clause with concrete details added in the modifying phrases and clauses). I had two objectives. First, awareness of con- notation. Much of the humor in the fairy tale exer- cise had resulted from choices of grossly in- appropriate words. In describing an item, the student was to search for the precise word--exact for sound, color, shape, movement, and appropriate in emotional overtone. Second, practice in realistic composition. Although most of the activities asked students to begin with new words and to fabricate situations in which they could be used, the normal linguistic challenge occurs, of course, in just the re- verse order. We are in a situation, and we search for the word to express it. I wanted the class to come back to this reality. The activity worked in helping us think about connotation and the lexical challenge in writing. It must be noted, however, that one hour is not enough time for the cumulative sentence. Only the barest beginnings can be made, and the teacher may want to follow up in other classes. I liked the vocabulary work and the rhythm in the following sentence, but even this short sentence was the result of revisions after class: "An adult's toy used to usher new years February 1981 19</page><page sequence="5">in, the noise maker cranked in my hand, filling the room with a raucous cacophony that rasped our nerves." Dress up as a Word The assignment (adapted from Nielsen and Skaife) was to select an adjective, to dress in a costume ex- pressing its meaning, and to give the class a list of clues to help them identify the word. I demonstrated by appearing first in a white sheet and gold tinsel and then removing the outer garments to reveal a flask-slinging bacchanalian. Attempting to teach the class the meaning of pejorative, I gave the clues re- quired by the assignment: Origin-Latin Synonyms-deteriorated, worsened, degenerative Antonyms-improved, ameliorative, elevated Number of syllables-four Affixes-ative for adjective, ation for noun Rhyming word-restorative Since the class was not familiar with the word or concept, I then explained examples of words such as fair, crafty, and egregious which have undergone pejora- tion over the years. In addition to the demonstration, the teacher may want to suggest other responses to the assign- ment. A student in pajamas and night cap might rise from a reclining position and stroll slowly down the aisle to represent somnambulant. A person could dress all in black on one side of the body, with stripes and polka dots on the other side, to signify di- chotomous. Furs, feathers, and sequins would express flamboyant. It is important to emphasize that students should choose a word neither too common nor too esoteric but one worth the attention of the class. On the day of the presentations, even amidst the twitter of excitement caused by the visit of the insti- tute photographer, we had a good lesson. As each word was identified, it was written on the board, pronounced correctly, and discussed briefly. Stu- dents were encouraged to add words from this list to their file box of vocabulary cards. Role-Play a Group of Related Words I divided the class into groups of three, and in antic- ipation again of an upcoming assignment, I gave each group a word root: e.g., phobia, mania, pater, ma- ter, theos. The group selected three different words containing its assigned root and in twenty minutes, planned a dramatic situation in which the meaning of these three words would become clear. I advised the groups to have an exact beginning and ending planned but to allow room for improvisation in the middle of the presentation. Each group was asked to write its three words on the board so the class could think about them dur- ing the role-playing. Representative of the results, the mania group dramatized three obsessions (for food, for horses, and for nighttime) with a noc- tomaniac who tried to make her two housemates stay up with her all night even though they, the ciboma- niac and hippomaniac, were exhausted from cooking and riding horses all day. Role-playing never seems to fail to stimulate excitement, develop creativity with language, and bring out the personality in sev- eral students who have heretofore been reticent. Explore the Oxford English Dictionary Exposure was my objective. I dittoed thirty-five questions to reveal the various uses of the OED. Sample questions and answers: On what part of the body was a thimble worn originally? Thumb. What is the early English word for the tomato? Love- apple-it was thought to be an aphrodisiac. By selecting from various English language texts ques- tions I had researched myself at one time, I was bet- ter prepared to help students through the finely printed intricacies of the OED entries. Students chose partners, I gave them copies of the questions, and we went to the library, making it a contest to see which pair of students could find the most an- swers in an hour and a half. (The winner had thirty- two correct answers.) Videotape a Skit I knew from Nielsen and Skaife that a musical per- formance would work well with most classes. How- ever, I had let my class talk (write) me out of it, and we had skits instead. They broke into groups of three or four, each student drew a piece of paper on which I had written a word from the chapter as- signed that day, and the group had one night to pre- pare a skit based on the words thus chosen at ran- dom. Levitation, surreptitious, and opulence, for example, resulted in a three-scene dramatization in which a news reporter sent to do a story about a lux- urious and supposedly haunted mansion was snared by the con-artistry of two of the servants. Before watching each videotape replay, we discussed the meanings of words the actors had drawn. 20 English Journal</page><page sequence="6">Engage in a Vocabulary Quiz Bowl Our last class featured a team competition that pre- cipitated as thorough a review of the words as a fi- nal exam might have if the course had been credited and graded. We formed teams of four with the youngest members of the class acting as captains. I prepared lists of questions on transparencies so stu- dents could look at the words while they were for- mulating their answers. Varying the types of ques- tions and structuring the games to involve all students helped maintain interest. Sample games: a. The contestant tells whether two words shown on the screen (e.g., intrepid-fearful) are similar or opposite in meaning. b. Four words are shown, each with an under- lined part. The team confers to list the mean- ings of the word parts underlined: e.g., Philadelphia, love; prescient, knowledge; au- tonomy, govern; circumspect, around. c. Four words are shown. Each team member takes one word, writes out a situation in which the word would be used, then defines the word and reads the paragraph aloud. d. The first letter of a word is shown on the screen. A definition is given, and the student is asked to recall the word. Extra points are awarded for correct spelling and for giving the word in the correct form (e.g., adjective or noun suffix) as specified by the wording of the definition. However the teacher decides to quiz students, the class will enjoy a spirited contest and will take im- mense pleasure in demonstrating how much they have learned about words. The principle underlying these vocabulary exer- cises is similar to that underlying sentence com- bining practice. We know parsing sentences does not improve writing, but sentence combining requiring repeated use of various sentence patterns does im- prove syntax. It is likely so with diction. We do not achieve vocabulary growth by memorizing lists, but studying groups of related words along with system- atic exercises in using them seems to enhance word power. I do not know how long my students will remem- ber specific words we studied. I believe, however, they developed a process for learning new words, a process they will retain as a permanent skill.
