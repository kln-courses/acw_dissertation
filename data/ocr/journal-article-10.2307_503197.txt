Kerle Verlag, Heidelberg, I974. DM I15- Der r6mische Genius is a revised and expanded version of a 1968 dissertation at the University of Cologne, written under the direction of Heinz Kaihler. It updates the only previous monographic treatment of this subject, a 1931 dissertation by E. Rink published in 1933. Kunckel discusses the nature and origin of the Roman genius and traces the chronological and typological development of the concept and its pic- torial representations from the Republic to Theodosius. A catalogue of all extant sculptured, painted, and numismatic examples of genii constitutes about one half of the volume. The Roman genius is a guardian spirit or power that can be of a private and personal nature (i.e., the genius of an individual) or of a public and corporate nature (i.e., the genius of a group of people). The origin of the Roman concept of genius is difficult to trace. It is probably an outgrowth of Etruscan beliefs, but there are no Etruscan representations of genii; the Romans are responsible for giving anthropomorphic form to the concept. The earliest type of Roman genius is of a personal nature. Every individual had a genius, but the only genius revered by the Roman family was that of the living paterfamilias. The cult of the genius of the pater- familias assumed the aspect of a state religion with the establishment of the cult of the Genius Augusti by a senatus consultum of 30 B.C. The sacrifice of bulls to the Genius Augusti on the birthday of the emperor (in contrast to the incense, wine, and flowers used to honor private genii) associated the new state cult with those of Jupiter, Mars Ultor, and Apollo, to whom bulls were also sacrificed. Already during the late Republic the personalized nature of the Roman concept of genius had been transformed by the introduction of the Genius Populi Romani. It is interesting that the earliest extant pic- torial formulation of the idea of genius is a numismatic representation of the genius of the Roman people as a whole, rather than of a personal genius. A denarius of Gnaeus Cornelius Lentulus Marcellinus, struck in 76- 74 B.C., bears the bust of a mature, bearded, Zeus-like man and the legend GPR. An earlier denarius of 96-94 B.C., also issued by the gens Cornelia, is stamped with an unlabeled image of a full-length, semi-nude youth holding a cornucopia, which may also be a representa- tion of the Genius Populi Romani. Thus, from the beginning, the pictorialization of the Genius Populi Romani took two distinct forms, and both types are known under the Empire, although the latter type is more common as well as more familiar, because it is employed on such monuments as the Arch of Titus and the Cancelleria reliefs. In these and many other cases the youthful Genius Populi Romani is paired with a bearded, togate genius of the Roman Senate, a contrast which was undoubtedly intentional. (The first appearance of the Genius Senatus is on the Arch of Titus.) Like the Genius Senatus, personal genii, including the Genius Augusti, are shown as togate figures, but genii of private persons and the emperor have veiled heads and are, like the most common type of the Genius Populi Romani, youthful and clean-shaven. The Genius Augusti seems always to have had a cornucopia and patera as attributes, whereas extant private genii have three combinations of attributes: cornucopia and patera, acerra and patera, or patera and rotulus. In the 2nd and 3rd centuries new types of group- genii come into prominence-genii of corporations, societies, military camps, etc. These genii are almost all semi-nude youths and have a cornucopia and patera as attributes. The most remarkable pictorially are the genii of the military camps, which also wear military boots and have fortified walls as headdresses. Only one known statuette, from the Lauriacum camp (pl. 92, 2-3), is clothed in a cuirass rather than a mantle. The latest Roman representations of genii are the images of the Genius Populi Romani on coins of 326 issued on the occasion of the vicennalia of Constantine. The public and private cult of the Roman genius was put to an end by an edict of Theodosius in 392. Kunckel's presentation of the long and complex history of the Roman genius is clear and well-docu- mented throughout. Scholars will be indebted to the author for collecting and organizing such a large and dispersed body of material. The catalogue of repre- sentations of Roman genii alone comprises hundreds of entries, and the written documents have also been as- sembled and discussed. There are three maps of find- spots of extant examples of Roman genii and 96 plates with a few hundred generally excellent photographs. The casual reader of this volume should be forewarned that the one-page Summary touches on only a few points and does not do justice to the foregoing text. DIANA E.E. KLEINER FRED S.
