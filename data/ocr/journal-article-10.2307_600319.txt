<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE MAHAVIRA VESSEL AND THE PLANT PJTIKA STELLA KRAMRISCH THE PHILADELPHIA MUSEUM OF AIRT AND THE INSTITUTE OF FINE ARTS, NEW YORK UNIVERSITY 'The Pravargya sacrifice is centered in the making and the worship of a non-iconic earthen pot, the Mahavira vessel. The ritual enacts an initiation through a craft, the craft of the potter. The vessel, made to glow in the sacrificial fire is the "all encompassing hero," Mahavira, the Sun. The vessel is the head of the sacrifice, the Head of Makha. Makha however is the cosmic giant. The myth of the decapitation of Makha and the restoration of its head to the sacrifice rest on a secret magic knowledge, the mystery of Soma. In the Pravargya the mantle of King Soma has fallen on the shoulders of Emperor Ma- havira-and the myth of the Soma plant has been substituted by that of the plant, Putika. The odour of this plant, an ingredient of the Mahavira pot, is of great significance in myth and ritual. The name of the plant, Putika, survives to this day in the name "Putka" which is that of a mushroom sacred to the Santal, an aboriginal tribe in Eastern India. The mush- room Pftika is the mythically and ritually authenticated substitute of Soma. This makes it more than likely that the Soma plant itself was a mushroom. The symbolism of the Mahavira vessel, as the Sun, the "all seeing eye," on the other hand survives in representations of the auspicious vase in Western Indian paintings preserved from the fifteenth century A.D. THE MAHAViRA VESSEL is an anointed, empty earthern pot glowing red hot in the sacrificial fire. Its function, in the first and original part of the Pravargya rite of which it is the center, is sym- bolic. It is only in the second and subsequent parts of this rite that the vessel will be filled with milk, that it will be replete with perceptible con- tents. Pravargya means that "which is to be put on the fire," viz. the Mahavira vessel. In the later Vedic age, in the White Yajurveda, the Pravar- gya sacrifice had been combined with the Rg Vedic Soma sacrifice, the Pravargya being performed just before or at the beginning of the Soma sac- rifice. Myth and ritual of the two sacrifices were coordinated in one configuration. The head of this configuration is called the Head of Makha. The Head of Makha of which the Mahavira vessel (ukhl) is the symbol, is the main and central sacred object of the Pravargya sacrifice. The ves- sel is made of clay to which four other ingredients are added. Puitika plants are one of them and their significance is paramount in the myth and ritual of the Head of Makha. The Pravargya sac- rifice requires a special initiation over and above that of the Soma sacrifice and it must not be performed by one who for the first time offers a Soma sacrifice (9B.14.2.2.44-46; Ap.gS.15.20-21). THE SECRET OF THE CUT-OFF HEADS The myth of the Mahavira vessel is told in several versions, that of the gatapatha Brahmana being the most exhaustive: The gods, Agni, Indra, Soma, Makha, Visnu, and the Visve Devah perform a sacrificial ses- sion in Kuruksetra in order to win glory. They agree that whoever amongst them through aus- terity, fervour, faith, sacrifice and oblations would first encompass the end of the sacrifice would be the most excellent among them and the glory should then be common to them all. Visnu obtained it (9B.14.1.1-5). Visnu is the sacrifice. But Visnu was unable to contain the love of glory of his (9B.14.1.6). Taking his bow with three arrows he stepped forth and rested his head on Ithe bow. Then the termites of the Upadika kind gnawed the bowstring, it was cut, the ends of the bow 222</page><page sequence="2">KRAMRISCH: Mlahvuira Vessel and Plant Pitika springing asunder cut off Visnu's head (SB.14. 1.1.7). It fell and became the Sun. The rest of the body lay stretched out with the top towards east (SB.14.1.1.10). The gods said: Our all-encompassing hero (mahan virah) has fallen. Therefrom the Maha- vira vessel was named, and the vital sap (that flowed from him) they wiped with their hands (sam-mrj). Whence the Mahavira is the Samraj (the emperor) (gB.14.1.1.11). The gods rushed forward to him, Indra ap- plied himself to him, limb to limb, engulfed, encompassed him and became possessed of his glory [i.e. of that of the headless Visnu] (SB.14. 1.1.12). The gods went on worshipping with that headless sacrifice (gB.14.1.1.17). Dadhyafic Atharvana knew this pure essence (the Madhu, the sweet [and secret] knowledge of the Pravargya), how the head of the sacrifice is put on again; how the sacrifice becomes complete again (SB.14.1.1.18 [cf.4.1.5.18]). Indra threatens to cut off the head of Da- dhyafic if he divulges the secret to anyone else [for Indra had obtained only the glory of the headless body.] (SB.14.1.1.19). The Asvins hear this and offer themselves as disciples to Dadhyaic (SB.14.1.1.20). Dadhyafic refuses them, fearing Indra would cut off his head (SB.14.1.1.21). However the Asvins promise to protect Da- dhyafic by the following scheme: when Dadhy- afic would receive them as pupils they would cut off his head and replace it by a horse's head. Dadhyafic will teach them through a horse's head-which head Indra will cut off. Then they will replace Dadhyanc's own head (SB.14.1.1.22- 24). Dadhyafc Atharvana with a horse's head taught them the sweet [secret] (SB.14.1.1.25). The god who does not honour an agreement and arrogantly keeps to himself the glory he under- took to share with the other gods is beheaded by his own bow. The decapitated god is Visnu, in the Satapatha Brahmana. His name is Makha in the Tandya Brahmana while in the Taittiriya Aranyaka he is called Makha Vaisnava.l He is 1 Tandya B.7.5.6; Taitt. Ar. 1.1-7; Satapatha B.14.1.1- 5; 14.1.2.17, a different version in Ait.B. 1.19; cf. RV. also called Makha Saumya (in SB.14.1.2.17). Visnu and Makha are equated, they are one person for Visnu is the sacrifice (SB.14.1.1.6) and Makha is the same as Visnu (SB.14.1.1.13). Visnu is par- ticularly the Soma sacrifice. Except in the above story, Makha does not figure amongst the gods. Makha's head however is invoked in Taitt.S.1.1.8. and it is the very center of the Pravargya sacrifice. Makha's head means the Sun (SB.14.1.1.10) and has for its symbol the Mahavira vessel. Mahavira is here being trans- lated as "all encompassing hero," with reference to the sun,2 but also with regard to Makha whose cutoff head is restored by the Pravargya ritual to the sacrifice.3 Makha, in the SB. is the deific name of the sacrifice.4 The Sacrifice had its head cut off. Its headless body lies prostrate. This fallen hero is reconstituted by having his head sacrifi- cially joined by the Pravargya ritual to the body, that is to the basic Soma sacrifice. Who but Visnu or Makha among the gods could encompass to its end the sacrifice? For Makha himself is the sacrifice and Vignu is the sacrifice; subject and object are one. In its deific shape, as Makha or Visnu, the sacrifice is the main figure in the myth. The myth is acted out in the form of the ritual. The meaning of the sac- rificial myth, the staging and action of the sac- rificial ritual, aim at the atonement of an initial wrong and at reintegration. In the present myth an arrogantly broken pledge is the initial wrong, the departure from integrity, a broken promise out of self-seeking niggardly pride. This initial dis- integration that causes Visnu-Makha, the sac- rifice, to lose its head, wants to be undone by a reintegration, which is the purpose of the rites of the sacrifice. The Pravargya sacrifice is added on to the beginning, or precedes the Soma sacrifice. The 10.171.2 "Indra severed Makha's head from the skin" (body; and Taitt.S.1.1.8.) 2 J. A. B. van Buitenen, 'The Pravargya, Poona 1968, 35, translates Mahavira as "Large MIan." The largeness being that of the sun, does not refer to its size, but to its all-encompassing power. 3 Pravargya is "that which is to be put on the fire," L. Renou, Vocabulaire du Ritual ediqule, Paris, 1954, 111; i.e. the Mahavira pot. 4 Makha has been variously translated; M. Mayrhofer, A Concise Etymological Sanskrit Dictionary, Heidelberg 1963, s.v. "Sacrifice" and "Hero," both fit Makha in the present context. 223</page><page sequence="3">Journal of the American Oriental Society 95.2 (1975) Pravargya is not known to the Rg Veda. It ap- pears to have been a sacrifice originally independ- ent of the Soma sacrifice. The two conjoint sac- rifices have their mythical figure in Makha, the Pravargya being Makha's head. Its symbol is the MahSvira pot. The Soma sacrifice has Visnu for its mythical figure. When the Pravargya sacrifice is added to the Soma sacrifice, they form as it were one sac- rifice of which the Pravargya is the head, Makha's head. Forming one albeit extended sacrifice, Vis- nu becomes equated with Makha. The Pravargya preceding the Soma sacrifice, being in front of the sacrifice, it is the "Head of Makha"; nowhere is it spoken of as Visnu's head. In the SB. version it was Visnu who encompas- sed the entire sacrifice: this was his glory which identified him with the sacrifice. But in the elation of his triumph he literally lost his head. His bow cut it off. The head fell and became the sun. The rest of the body lay stretched out to- wards the east. In this calamitous situation, Indra encompassed the prostrate body, lay down on it; limb to limb he embraced it and its glory was absorbed by him. It was a truncated glory of a headless body. The gods went on worshipping with that headless sacrifice and gained nothing by it. Truly, the gods were cheated by Visnu of the glory of the sacrifice. Moreover the identities in the 9B. story do not work out squarely. Visnu is the sacrifice and he who is the sacrifice is the Sun (SB.14.1.1.6,32). In itself however, and not by synecdoche, the cut off head becomes the sun. It is Makha's head which is represented by the MahSvira pot in the Pravargya sacrifice (Vaj.S. 37.8; SB.14.1.2.1). One who teaches and partakes of the Pravargya sacrifice enters the light of the Sun (SB.14.1.1.26-32). By offering the Pravargya, the head of the sacrifice is replaced. (Tandya, 7.5.6, end) Two equations hold good: Visnu is the sacrifice; Makha is the Sun. The two conceptions are com- bined. They are linked in the ?B. by the role of Indra. It is as problematic as it is imitative. It is moreover futile, for the gods sacrificing with the headless sacrifice do not obtain blessings. (Taitt.Ar.I.6) Dadhyafic, the Atharvana, the fire- priest, comes to their rescue by telling the Healers among the gods, the Asvins, the "madhu-vidya," the "sweet" or secret magic knowledge how to replace the head of the sacrifice. The Asvins, in possession of the secret knowledge, ask the gods for a boon and receive it in the shape of a libation of hot milk (gharma) out of the Mahavira pot (Taitt.Ar.I.7). They promptly replace the head of the sacrifice. Henceforward, Gharma, Mahavira, Pravargya and "Makha's head" refer to the same complex reality. The Asvins learned the Madhu Vidya, the "sweet" secret knowledge straight from the "horse's mouth," for it was with a horse's head that Dadhyafic spoke to them (1RV.1.119.9). Now Indra had entered also this part of the story. He had cut off the head of Dadhyafic, that is the horse's head. (RV.1.84.14). Indra had to cut off the head which had divulged the secret to the Asvins. In fact, Indra previously had threat- ened Dadhyafic that he would cut off his head should Dadhyafic ever betray the secret known only to Indra and Dadhyafic. By a ruse the Asvins made Dadhyafic part with the secret and keep his head. That is, they themselves cut off Dadhyanc's original head and put on Dadhyafic a horse's head which told the secret. When Indra fulfilled his threat, he did cut off Dadhyafic's head but that was the head of the horse which had told the secret. Finally the Asvins know how to restore the original head of Dadhyafic. This miraculous restoration these divine healers accomplished. Now, their knowledge further increased by the secret they had learned from the horse's head, they also knew how to restore the head of Makha. But did the "sweet," the Madhu, that only Indra and Dadhyafic5 knew and that Dadhyaic announced to the Asvins through the horse's head remain un- changed from the Rg Veda to the Brahmanas? The Rg Veda speaks of the "sweet" (madhu) of Tvastr, it also speaks of the fly that gave away the Madhu, the "sweet" (RV.1.119.9). Tvastr's sweet is Soma. Indra once stole the Soma from Tvastr (RV.3.48.4), whereas the fly betrayed the secret to the Asvins. In the ancient story of the Rg Veda, the secret of Soma is betrayed to the Asvins, by Dadhyanc, or else it is betrayed to them by a fly.6 Was the "sweet" that Dadhyafic knew the knowl- edge of Soma and where the Soma could be found? The horse's head of Dadhyafc was submerged in Saryanavat.7 Saryanavat is a lake or river in the 5 RV..116.12; 1.117.22; 1.119.9; 9.68.5. 6 RV.1.119.9; R.

It is rich in Soma.8 With the bone of that cutoff horse's head Indra slew nine times ninety arch enemies (Vrtras).9 That bone served as Indra's Vajra, his unfailing weapon. It was the thunderbolt.10 The Madhu in the Rg Veda has the secret of Soma for its content. This secret, the repository of Indra's strength, is revealed by Dadhyafic to the Asvins. A later text" also tells us that Indra himself had imparted to Dadhyaic the magic secret (brah- ma) and had forbidden him to reveal it to anyone. This secret knowledge in post-Rg Vedic texts ap- pears not to be the same pure essence, viz. Soma, the innermost mystery and life elixir of the sac- rifice, but another carrier of sacrificial transport, viz. the secret of the Pravargya. This mystery is revealed to the Asvins by the horse's head which was cut off by Indra. Another cutoff head, that of Makha and the life elixir which flowed away from the decapitated head of the sacrifice itself, have their own initiatory power. Soma, the drink of immortality, sweetness itself (madhu), is the original mystery. The mystery now however is centered in the restoration of the head of Makha. The horse's head told the Asvins the secret of how to restore the head of the sacrifice. The secret, however, shared originally by Indra and Dadhyafic is Soma. Secretly, by the horse's head, the sanctity of Soma was assigned to Makha's head in a duplicity of meaning, implying a transfer of significance from the Soma sacrifice to the Pravargya sacrifice. The Soma mystery is the primary secret. It is the "sweet" of Tvastr, the maker of all form, the mystery of creativity itself, of which the Rg Veda sings. The secret given away by Dadhyafic Atharvana, according to the gatapatha Brahmana, is the knowledge of the restoration of the head of the sacrifice (SB.14.1.1.18; 4.1.5.18). It is the secret of the restitution of wholeness which had become fragmented. The cause of the fragmentation, the cause of the lost head, was the overweening pride of the god himself who thus "lost his head." While Soma is creativity itself--in a state untainted by egoity-the secret of regaining the lost head belongs to a state in the godhead fallen from primal in- 8 RV.9.65.22,23; Say. on 1.84.14; cf. 10.35.2. 9 RBV.1.84.13-14. 10 Cf. A. A. Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, Strassburg 1897, 142. Wasson, 40. 11 Brhad Devata, 3.18-24. nocence, when guilt had come to be. This latter mystery-enacted in the Pravargya ritual-slides into the place of the divine Soma transport. The horse's head divulged secrets of the gods. They were not the same, one supplanted the other. Makha's head was cut off by a divine act of retribution-the termites hence were divinized. His sacrificial death is an immolation. Makha is the sacrifice by expiation. The slaying of Soma however fulfills his inner destiny. In order to be consumed Soma must be killed. The Soma sac- rifice is a passion whereas Makha was felled by his overweening selfishness. The demon in Makha was liberated, the dark face of the cosmic giant was severed from the trunk, the cutoff head was purified in the Pravargya sacrifice. In its flames the head of Makha was made to glow with the radiance of the sun. The secret knowledge by which the Asvins, the celestial Healers, restored the sacrifice is contained in the Mantras of the Hymn to the Light (RV.10. 170.1-3). It is these incantations which are meant by the Divakirtyas of which the Satapatha Brah- mana speaks (9B.4.1.5.15; SV.2.803-805; Uhya- gana.2.2.9). By the power of these words addres- sed by the Asvins to the Light radiating from the Sun the head of Makha is restored to the body of the sacrifice. Significantly, the hymn RV.10.171.2 immedi- ately following this laud of the celestial Light, the Sun's radiance, praises Indra who severed the head of raging Makha from his body.l2 The beheading of Makha underlies the rite of the Pravargya. It is also one of Indra's heroic deeds. The slaying of demoniac darkness and thereby turning into Light is celebrated in more than one version. Makha, in the Rg Veda is raging darkness from whose body Indra severs the head so that it may arise as sun.13 12 See note 1; RV.10.171.2. Makha as raging darkness thus figures as the primeval sacrificial "animal." The transformation of the demon into the sacrificial victim leads one step further. As sacrificial victim Makha sup- plants King Soma. At a time when the Soma sacrifice was waning and Soma not readily obtainable, the Pravargya was added on to, supplemented, expanded, and reoriented the ancient rites. When Indra had severed the raging head of Makha "he came to the house of one who had prepared Soma" (somin; RV.10.171.2). 13 Indra liberating the Sun is the subject not only of the Vala myth, but figures also in other images like that of 225</page><page sequence="5">Journal of the American Oriental Society 95.2 (1975) No doubt the "demon" Makha is cognate, ab intra, with Makha, the sacrifice. The horse's head of Dadhyafic the fire priest, which the Asvins-whose name derives from agva, "horse,"-had put on his shoulders, reveals the secret. The horse's head is the sun, itself. It is at the same time the head of the sun-horse. Through the mouth of Dadhyainc, the sun-horse's secret knowledge, the Madhu Vi- dya is revealed, or, it is said, the sun horse "sings to- gether with the Soma-inspired singers in heaven."14 In the Pravargya ritual, the head of Makha, the severed head, the Sun, represented as the "all en- compassing hero," the Mahavira pot, is hallowed by the horse even before the pot is made. A stal- lion leads those who go to collect the clay from a hole, significantly situated towards the sunrise, to the east of the Ahavaniya altar where the gods are invoked, the priest addressing the clay, "Thou art the head of Makha,"15 and the stallion is made to sniff at the clay.'6 When the Mahavira vessel has been shaped, it is fumigated with horse-dung burnt on the Garhapatya altar.l7 And the Maha- vira vessel glowing on the crackling fire is lauded: "Loudly the tawny stallion neighed."18 Dadhy- raging Makha (IIV.10.171.2), or also that of Indra striking down the chariot of Usas, the Dawn (RV.10.73.6) in her darkness-aspect cf. A. K. Coomaraswamy, "The Darker Side of Dawn," Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections, 64.1. Washington, 1935,6. cf. 1~V.9.73.5, the dark skin which Indra hates and which is magically blown away from heaven and earth. Taitt.S.1.1.8 invokes the head of Makha as the wide extended vessel which contains all life. This vessel how- ever is made of potsherds (kapala). The skin which is to be grasped by a god (not named), the victory over the demon appear in the same context, and Savitr, the Impeller or solar power is invoked to make ready (the vessel) in the highest firmament. The Pravargya ritual is adumbrated in the Yajur Veda. 14 RV.I.6.8, cf. A.

And thus its symbol is the earthen Mahavira pot. THE ELIXIR OF LIFE: SOMA AND PUTIKA When Visnu or Makha or the sacrifice-they are synonyms-had his head cut off, sap flowed away and entered the sky and the earth. "Clay is this earth and water is the sky. Hence it is of clay and water that the Mahavira vessel is made."19 The elements earth and water carry the sap of Makha's head into the substance of the Mahavira pot. It will dry in the sun and be baked in fire. Earth or clay as it is dug from a pit east of the sacrificial hut is the major but not the only solid substance that goes into the making of the Mahavira pot. Four other ingredients are added to the clay. Their importance is primarily symbolical, the rel- evant ingredient is a certain plant. 1B.14.1.2.12 speaks of this plant:20 "Adara plants are Indra's might21 for when Indra encompassed (Visnu) with might, the vital sap of Visnu flowed away. And he lay there stinking as it were after bursting open (a-dar). The vital sap sang praises. The Adara plants originated and because he lay there stinking (puy) therefore [they are also called], putika. When laid on the fire as an offering they are fragrant for they originated from the vital sap of the sac- rifice." The vital sap that flowed from the head penetrated heaven and earth and mid-air, all that lies under the sun. The vital sap that flowed from the beheaded body was pressed out from it by Indra's might. Indra's might is sustained by Soma. In the transport caused by that drink of immortality the inspired poets sing about Indra's deeds. Does the Adara plant here stand for Soma inasmuch as it is here called Indra's might? The Adara plant is not otherwise identified except that it originated then and there and that it is also called Piitika. If the etymology of iidara is her- think, with some reserve, of the little baked clay horses attendant on icons. 19 B.14.1.2.9; 14.2.2.53. 20 Cf. Taitt.Ar.5.1.3.5; Ap.gS.15.2.1; Manava gS.4.1.11, ed.

In Indra's close embrace of Visnu's body-limb by limb, he covered him-was Indra's power car- ried by osmosis into the fallen body of Visnu- Makha ? Was it too much for that beheaded and dis- integrating body and did it burst open and plants spring forth ?23 These plants called either "Adara" or "Pfitika" are the most significant amongst the five ingredients that make up the clay of the Mahavira pot. They represent the might (ojas) of Indra communicated to the body of Makha and transmuted into plants which will be ground and mixed with the clay out of which Makha's head, the Mahavira pot, will be formed.24 The other ingredients of the Mahivira pot are: earth from a termite hill25 for these termites had been divinized and made "first born of the world" 22 Mayrhofer, s.v. 23 gB.4.5.10.4 speaks about the provenance of Adara or Putika. This passage does not treat of the Pravargya myth, but of substitutes for Soma. The Adara plant in this context is one of the Soma substitutes, when Soma can- not be had. It is said to have sprung from the sap which spurted from the head of the sacrifice when the head was cut off. The implications of the myth are lost or overlooked when a part of it only is taken out of context. SB.14.1.2.19 narrates somewhat vaguely "when the sac- rifice had its head cut off, its vital sap flowed away and therefrom those plants grew up." 24 According to Manava grauta Suitra, 4.1.9-10, the Pftika plants were ground. Another version of the origin of the Pitika plant, though lacking the coherence of the Brahmana of a Hundred Paths tells that the Pfitika plant grew from a feather or leaf (par.ra) when Somna was carried through the air by the falcon (Ta.nd.B.9.5.1). This plant which properly is called gyenabhrta, "carried hither by the falcon," is Soma (RV.1.80.2; 8.95.3; 9.87.6). gB.4.5.10.2-6 however, enumerating the substitutes for Soma speaks of gyenabhrta and Adara as two different substitutes of Soma. Taitt.Ar.5.1.3.5 presents yet an- other name and story: "Makha leaning on his bow smiled overbearingly and his warmth of life (tejas) left him. The gods wiped it on the plants. The plant Syamaka originated therefrom. Also his manly power (virya) flowed out." Makha here is not decapitated, Indra is absent from the story. The gyamaka plant which may be a kind of grain or corn, does not otherwise figure in the story of Makha nor amongst the substitutes for Soma Makha pays with his life for his hubris, his vitality goes to the plants. 25 gB.14.1.2.10; Vaj.S.37.4; Taitt.Ar.4.2.3; Ap.gS.15.2.1. in return for the part they played in the severance of Visnu's head; earth turned up by a boar, for it was the boar Emusa-Prajapati that raised the earth herself-she was quite small then-into ex- istence.26 These two additional kinds of earth establish mythically the consistency and existence of the substance of the Mahavira vessel from the beginning of things. The Piltika plants are the third additional ingredient.27 The sources do not reveal their identity. But the secrecy that sur- rounds them is not the only thing they share with Soma. The wrong identifications of the Pfitika plant are proportionate to those of the Soma plant, which is fair as the former is only a sub- stitute for Soma.28 Yet its relevance is such that it confirms the drink of immortality to have been pressed from a mushroom. This mushroom has been identified as the fly agaric, i.e. Amanita muscaria.29 The fourth ingredient added to the clay, making altogether five components of the Mahavira pot, 26 Cf. 25. These two earth admixtures are not always enumerated in the same sequence. Their proportionate amount is not indicated and seems to have not been rel- evant to the texture of the clay of which the pot was made. Like the ground Piitika plants these ingredients had more ritual-symbolical then technical importance similar to the presence of gold and silver in the metal alloy called as- tadhatu (eight substances) of later day Indian bronze images. 27 Vaj.S.37.6; gB.14.1.2.12; Ap.SS.15.2.2; van Buitenen, p. 57 quotes from Baudhayana gS., a variant of Pitika, namely Badara [Adra ?] stalks. For references here given to Ap.gS. cf. van Buitenen, passim. 28 Sayana on Tan.LB.9.5.1 considers the Pfitika plant to be a creeper; Pitika is explained as the flowers of the Rohisa plant by the commentary on Katyayana SS. An impressive array of wrong identifications of the Soma plant is given by W. Doniger O'Flaherty in Wasson, 93-130. According to gB.4.5.10.2, one of the Soma substitutes, the Phalguna plants, deserve mention. Of their two varieties, one with bright red flowers, the other with reddish brown flowers only the second was considered eligible. In this connection the observation in the Athar- vaprayascittani, J. von Negelein, JAOS 34, 254-256, is of interest. Red Soma is said to grow in the Himalayas and brown Soma on Mujavant. If the fly agaric, the mushroom identified by Wasson, has a red as well as a brown variety it would appear that in post-Vedic time the latter was in demand.

King Soma was killed in that he in the shape of the Soma plant was pressed.30 "In the slaying of Soma the sacrifice is slain, with the sacrifice the sacrificer."31 In the Soma sacrifice the sacrificial significance of Soma was enhanced by his royal status. In the course of the Pravargya sacrifice, King Soma having been enthroned, that is a bundle of Soma plants having been placed on the seat of a high four-legged stool, the rdjasandi, which reaches to the navel of the sacrificer, a similar throne that may be higher, even shoulder- high, is placed near King Soma's throne. This is the Emperor's throne (samraidasandi) on which the Emperor, the "All-encompassing Hero," the Ma- havira vessel will rest.32 The Emperor, the All-encompassing Hero, Ma- havira, the Sun, is the Great God of the Pravargya. His throne faces east, for nothing must come between Mahavira and the sun.33 Symbolically they are one, Makha's head is the Sun.34 This is the meaning of the Mahavira vessel. It has no other "content." Its fiery glowing shape encom- passes its cavity, its vastness. Only after the pot has achieved its greatest heat and splendour is hot milk poured into it, the offering to the Asvins.35 30 Taitt.S.6.4.4.4; 6.6.7.1. 31 Taitt.S.6.6.9.2. 32 .B.14.1.3.10; 3.3.4.21; cf. van Buitenen, p. 15; the three Mahavira pots, two of them in reserve,-should the empty, red hot glowing pot crack during the sacri- fice,-are placed on the Samradasandl, the emperor's throne. 33 The emperor's throne is placed south of the Ahava- niya fire where the gods are invoked and receive their offering and north of King Soma's throne, gB.14.11.3.8, 12. Notwithstanding these rites, raising Mahavira above Soma, the gatapatha Brahmaina, ritually, though not logically, sums up its entire section on the Pravargya with the words "The Pravargya indeed is Soma" (SB.14.3.2. 30). In this identification the Puitika plant plays the main role. 34 Vaj.S.38.24; SB.14.1.3.3-6. 35 Ap.gS.5.9.10-12; 15.10.1-5. In the course of the sacrifice curds are offered to Indra and other gods. The curds offered to Soma should be curdled with Piltika plants (TS.2.5.3.5) in the first place, or with bark while other curdling agents such as rennet, curds, rice, or buckthorn should be used for the offering of the curds The All-encompassing Hero, the Sun, of the Pra- vargya, being joined to the Soma sacrifice, is the head of the sacrifice. "The head of the sacrifice has become joined in the same manner in which the Asvins restored it." (1B.14.2.2.43) Just as the Asvins knew how to put the horse's head on the shoulders of Dadhyafic whose human head they had to cut off and then restored to Dadhyaiic his human head, so they restored the head of the sacrifice. It was the horse's head that taught them this secret. This is how the Satapatha Brahmana presents the Madhu Vidya, the sweet, secret knowledge that Dadhyafic's horse's head betrayed to them. In the Rg Veda however, it was another secret that Dadhyafic betrayed to the Asvins. This secret was "Madhu," the innermost "sweetness," Soma. (RV. 1.116.12; 1.117.22) More than half a millennium lies between the two meanings of the Madhu Vidya in the Rg Veda and the Brahmanas. The Sun cult of Mahfvira, the All-encompassing Hero, was combined with the Soma sacrifice. The meaning of this combined sacrifice revalued the ancient secret of the horse's head, of Dadhyafic and of the Sun. The substitution of contents and the continu- ation of the original Soma sacrifices has a ritual analogy in the relation of the Soma plant, iden- tified by Wasson as the fly agaric, Amanita mus- caria, and its substitute, Putika. King Soma has not been dethroned, but his throne is further from the sun than that of Emperor Mahavira. In- to the making of Mahavira went the Putika plant. This symbolically essential ingredient of the Ma- havira pot has an unsavory connotation accounted for by the myth, told in the Brahmana of a Hun- dred Paths. However, its offensiveness is turned into fragrance when the plant is laid on the fire. This transfiguration in and by the ritual is similar to that of the juice of the Soma plant itself, which is made palatable ritually by an admixture of milk. Mythically, however, the purification of Soma is effected by Vayu, the Wind. He blew with the gale of the spirit when Indra freed the cosmos from the Asura, the non-god, the Titan, Vrtra the Serpent. Soma was in Vrtra (RV.10.124.4) and Indra slew Vrtra, the ophidian Asura. Slain Vrtra stank to heaven, sour and putrid. Vayu blew away that foul smell-"the smell of King to other gods.-In more than one ritual context is Puitika linked with Soma. 228</page><page sequence="8">KRAMRISCH: Mahavira Vessel and Plant Pltika Soma." He was neither fit for offering, nor was he fit for drinking (gB.4.1.3.5-8). Agni, Soma and Varuna were in Vrtra, the Asu- ra. They were ensconced in the ambience of this ancient cosmic power. Indra slew this dragon, his antagonist. Agni, Soma and Varuna were liberated. They went over to the young conquerer god. The rule of the world had changed. But inasmuch as Soma was in Vrtra he was slain with him who had contained him. However, he came out of the decomposing carcass. Its odor clung to him. Vayu blew on him and made him palat- able (9B.4.1.2.10). The preoccupation of this account with the stench of the decomposition of the flesh of the World Serpent and of King Soma smells of guilt, the guilt of murder. The odor associated with the putrid smell of dead bodies was not unfamilar it seems to the priests after animal sacrifices. The gods themselves dispelled some of the smell of King Soma and laid it into [dead] cattle. (9B.4.1. 3.8) In fact, the priests had chosen the plant Putika and endowed it with a myth of its own (SB.14.1.2.12) in the context of the sacrifice. In this myth stench as a symbol of evil is implicated in and purified by the sacrifice. The plant Puitika, however, when laid on the fire as an offering is said to become fragrant, it acquires the odour of sanctity. PUTKA AND THE SANTAL OF EASTERN BIHAR In Eastern Bihar there live aboriginal people, the Santal, occupying a stretch of country called the Santal Parganas, and we find scattered villages of Santal also in the adjacent regions of Orissa and the western marshes of West Bengal. The Santal number some millions. Until recently they were a hunting and food-foraging folk. Their language is not derived from Sanskrit nor is it Dravidian: it leads the third, smaller group, the Munda family. A trait of these languages is that their nouns are not classified into genders-mas- culine, feminine, neuter-but are either animate or inanimate, either possessing a soul or not pos- sessing a soul. The whole vegetable kingdom is inanimate, soulless except for one word that des- ignates a certain mushroom. That noun is putka: it is animate, a soul possesses it. P. 0. Bodding in the preface to his Santal Dictionary (Oslo, 1929-1936, 1, xiv) draws at- tention to a noteworthy fact: "Strangely enough, the Santals use some pure Sanskrit words, which, so far as I know, are not heard in present day Hindi." He might have added that, at least in the instance we are considering, the word has disappeared from all Sanskrit vernaculars. We may owe this survival to the mycophilia of the Santal, whose knowledge of the fungal world is reflected in a substantial fungal vocabulary. By contrast the Hindus are mycophobes: the twice- born castes are expressly forbidden to east mush- rooms, whether growing on trees or from the earth (Manu 5.5.19; 6.11.156; Ap.SS.1.5.14.28). Among the Santal the putka is a mushroom and, alone in the whole vegetable kingdom, possesses a soul.36 Did not putka inherit this sacred char- acter from long ago when it was an ingredient of the Mahavira pot, which was ritually "animated," endowed with sense organs, with a soul? Is not putka the Sanskrit Pultika ? The second peculiarity of putka is its revolting smell when gathered and left for a day or two exposed to the air.37 In Dumka (Santal Parganas) a Santal woman in answer to questions put to her by Wasson said that she thought she might know why putka was animate; the Santal consume putka in their curry, but at the end of a day or two should any putka have been left over, the remains of the leftover putka stink with the stench of a cadaver.38 She did not know the meaning of the 36 Roger Heim and R. Gordon Wasson: "Les Putka des Santals, champignons doues d'une ame." Cahiers dit Pacifique 14, 1970, pp. 59-85. Putka appears to be a Santalized version of Sanskrit Putika, the name in Sanskrit having a long or short "i". In the light of this discovery in Santal, one would like to inquire whether the same word with the same attributes is current in the sister language Ho, and in other languages of the northern group of Munda languages and, if so, whether it is present in the southern group. 37 Heim and Wasson, p. 65. The only other reason sup- plied by many Santal to justify the unique status of pulka was that it was commonly found in the sacred village grove of sarjom trees (i.e. dal in Hindi; Shorea robusla). But the sarjom itself is not animate; why therefore the putka around it, especially as the putka is not confined to Shorea robusta ? 38 Ibid. p. 85. The Santal distinguish three kinds of putka. (1) hor putka in which hor means 'man' or 'human being' or any Santal; (2) seta pulka, seta meaning "dog"; and (3) rote putka, rote being a "toad" or "frog." It emerges from the Heim-Wasson paper that these authors consider the first as variations in usage and the terms are applied interchangeably, the usage varying in different villages and possibly with different stages of 229</page><page sequence="9">Journal of the American Oriental Society 95.2 (197S) word putka nor the myth of Pftika in the Brah- manas. Wasson himself did not link putka with Puitika though he supplied the evidence for the identity of this mushroom. The third peculiarity of putka in Santal culture is the Santal belief that the putka are generated, not from seed, as are the generality of the vege- table world, but by the thunderbolt; in short, generated by divine intervention. Soma itself is generated by Parjanya (RV.9.82.3) apparently when his thunderbolt strikes the earth (cf. RV.5. 83.1,2,7). Piutika, the foremost, and possibly the only direct surrogate for Soma, is a mushroom. When the fly agaric no longer was available, another mushroom became its substitute. It had acquired a myth of its own. Nothing is known about any psychotropic virtue Putika may have. However, no drink was made from it. Instead it was crushed, mixed with the clay of the pot. Its transsubstanti- ation into the "All-encompassing Hero" came about through fire, for it is said that the plants themselves strewn on fire become fragrant "because they originated from the sap of the offering;39 moreover, integrated into the substance of the fire- baked vessel, anointed with butter, they glow in glory in the fire of the Pravargya. None of the other alleged substitutes for Soma has a myth of its own. Putika sprung from the slain body of the sacrifice is a resurrection, as it were, of Soma. The other plants have no myth of growth. The third is a puffball that appears suddenly after thunder storms. Many Santal have never heard of the rote putka and of those who had, few were able to identify it. The puffball does come in response to thunder, but the belief in thunder as the generative agent applies equally to the hor putka and seta putka. The hor and seta putka is an hypogean species, harvested when it finally breaks the surface of the ground. It has often been called a truffle, or 'truffle-like', which it is not. The Frog or rote putka calls to mind the Hymn to the Frogs (RV.7.10.3.8). There reference is made to the Gharma, the offering of hot milk and to the officiating priests, the Adhvaryus. In the gB. the Asvins who had not been invited to the sacrifice became the Adhvaryu priests of the sacrifice after they had restored the head of the Sacrifice by the mantras of the Hymn to the Sun (RV.10.170.1-3). In the paper by Heim and Wasson, Professor Heim de- scribes the putka mycologically and gives them their scientific names. 39 gB,14,1,2.12, their own except the gyenabhrta plant which, as the name tells, is Soma itself. The name gyena- bhrta meaning "carried by the falcon" conveys the myth of Soma having been brought from heaven by a falcon (RlV.8.82.9; 10.144.5) when a feather or leaf, fell to earth40 and the plant sprang from it. Regarding the other substitutes of Soma no- thing but a similarity of colours connects certain flowers; or the fact that they were used in the sacrifice, certain varieties of grass, viz. Kusa and Diirva grass.41 A mushroom is foremost among the substitutes of Soma. Moreover, a mushroom is a significant ingredient in the sun-cult of Makha's head, added to the Soma sacrifice. Putika though secondary in its role, being a surrogate for Soma, occupied a position of eminence in its own ca- pacity as an essential ingredient of the substance of the Mahavira pot. Pfitika was raised into the region of the sacred as a surrogate for Soma, the most exalted plant in Vedic rites which indeed had Soma for their center. Piutika, however, did not succeed Soma, did not become hallowed by the same rites but was integrated into the sub- stance of the Mahavira vessel. Soma was meant to be drunk. The Mahavira vessel was meant primarily to be made and seen. Its communion with the sacrifice was by a craft and ultimately by sight only. The identification of Pfitika, the Soma surro- gate, supplies strong evidence that Soma indeed was a mushroom. Piltika integrated into the Mahavira pot played its part in the mystery of the Pravargya sacrifice. That Putka-mushrooms should be known, to this day, as "endowed with a soul" witnesses amongst the Santal of Eastern India a memory of the numinous emanating from the indigenous Indian Soma substitute. Mixed with the clay and the other ingredients Pitika is part of the substance of which the Ma- havira vessel is made; it is dried in the heat of the sun, baked in the fire, placed on a silver dish and anointed with butter. The vessel is heated at the peak of the Pravargya to a red-hot glow, when the golden plate that had covered the mouth of the Mahavira pot is removed. The "All-encom- passing Hero," the "Head of Makha," the vessel 40 Tandya B.9.5.1 assigns to Puitika the myth of gyeni- bhrta, saying that Pitika is the plant which grew from a feather (or leaf, parna) that fell to earth when Soma was carried through the air in contrast to the far more telling myth of gB.14.1.2.12 about the origin of Pfitika. 41 SB.4.5.10; 14.1.2.12. 230</page><page sequence="10">KRAMRISCH: Mahavira Vessel and Plant Pltika that contains all life,42 that is flame, glow, and heat, is the Sun.43 Mahavira, is "Lord of all the worlds, Lord of all mind, Lord of all speech, Lord of all tapas [the fiery strength of asceticism], Lord of all brahman [the power of the sacred word], Lord of creatures, Spirit of poets."44 THE MAHAViRA VESSEL The Mahavira vessel is prepared at the sacrifice itself. The making of the earthern vessel is itself part of the ritual.45 The pot is shaped by hand; it is not thrown on a potter's wheel. Its height will be a span46 and it is Makha's Head. Its shape however does not resemble any head or face, though part of it is called its mouth, but is also spoken of as opening47 or outlet or as an outlet for pouring into.48 The shape of the vessel re- sembles the Vayavya, the wooden vessel which held the libation for Vayu, the Wind.49 The mouth or opening or top of the pot is also metaphorically called a nose for the Mahavira pot. It is contracted in the middle and projects outward, widening toward the top.50 These metaphors do not aim at conjuring up a physiognomy. They refer to a human face as much or as little as does the measure of a span. The wooden Vayavya vessel is named after Vayu, the Wind. The gods rewarded Vayu with the first libation of Soma from this vessel because he was the first to tell them that Vrtra had been slain (?B.4.1.3.4). Subsequently when Vayu had made Vrtra-Soma fit for offering and fit for drinking the libation vessels belonging to other gods were also called Vayavya or Vayu's vessels (SB.4.1.3.10). Vayu, the Wind, had made Soma sweet. "Therefore what becomes putrid they hang out in a windy place" (TS.6.4.7.1). 42 Cf. TS.1.1.8. 43 gB.14.1.3.17,26. 44 Ap.SS.15.8.15-16; tr. van Buitenen, 92; matter in brackets added. 45 gB.14.1.2.2. 46 gB.14.1.2.17. 47 Agv.Gr.S.4.3; bila, commented as garta, "a hollow." 48 Katy.gS.26.1.16; dsecana. 49 Ap.S.12.1.4; a libation vessel for an offering to Vayu; Renou, s.v. the same as Urdhvapatra, a high vessel in the shape of a mortar. Cf. Katy.8.7.5. 50 gB.14.1.2.17. The references to facial features do not conjure up the image of a face. They enliven single features of the pot. The Mahavira vessel conforms with the libation vessels called Vayavya. While these are carved out of wood the Mahavira pot is built up of clay. The lump of clay for the pot is divided into three parts, one part to be the bottom. The clay, pressed down with the thumbs and flattened, is addressed with the words "you are the two feet of the sacrifice."51 Obviously no similarity to any feet is intended here. The lowest part of the pot supports the vessel as the two feet support the human figure. The second part of the clay is used for building the walls of the vessel up to the height of its col- lar (parigrivi). The clay is laid on in three, five or an indefinite number of uddhis (elevations), that is, in coils or rings.52 They seem to decrease in diameter towards the middle of the height of the vessel and increase towards its top. The contracted middle is referred to as lagnam. This is not to be understood to be a joint but denotes an inter- section of planes.53 The third portion of the original lump of clay goes into the making of the top portion of the vessel which flares out to a height of two or four thumb widths above the collar (parigriva) or girdle (mekhali)54 laid on in high relief around the pot.55 At the conclusion of the rites of Makha's Head, milk will be poured into the pot.56 Once the vessel is completed it must not be touched by hand.57 It is held, raised, and trans- ferred by tongs. The high relief of the collar or 51 Ap.SS.15.2.14; Taitt.Ar.4.2.6. cf. R. Garbe. "Die Pravargya Ceremonie nach dem Ap.gS." ZDMG 34, 1880, 319. 52 Ap.gS.12.1.1. 53 Baudhayana (van Buitenen, 10) gives a clear de- scription, cf. also Apastamba (ibid p. 9). The number of uddhis or "rings," i.e. superimposed parts varies from tree to four or more. 54 Taitt.Ar.5.3.5 parigrivd, also rasna or "girdle" (Ap. gS.15.2.17) are here synonymous. 55 Garbe, p. 329. 56 Van Buitenen, lOf; based on Baudh.gS. [see also drawing on p. 11]. Van Buitenen understands the three portions of the lump of clay to have been shaped as two small balls one on top of the other, and supported on a broad calotte shaped base, suggesting the shape of a man seated cross legged. This reconstruction is not according to the texts nor would it serve the purpose of the Ma- havira pot. 57 Van Buitenen, 15; Ap. S.15.4.6-8, 231</page><page sequence="11">Journal of the American Oriental Society 95.2 (1975) girdle would have prevented a slipping of the tongs. The shape of the Mahavira pot is not anthro- pomorphic: it has neither the shape of a head, face, or figure of man. It is not an icon but a symbol in the shape of a vessel. To the officiating priest and to the sacrificer it means the Head of Makha, the Sun, and its mystery is experienced by them in the ritual. While they enact it, this mystery pervades their entire being, Mahavira comes to life in them and they live in him. "Like the two eyes, like the two ears, like the two nostrils thus he [the priest] places the senses in him."58 The Pravargya is a mystery rite, it requires a special initiatian over and above the one for the Soma sacrifice. The Pravargya is a complex ritual. Its first part, the Pravargya proper, is a sun ritual. Its main symbol is the red hot, glowing Mahavira, "the All-encompassing Hero," who encompasses as sun the horizons of heaven,59 unbounded space, all the world. The second main part of the sacrifice begins when the vessel, having been made to blaze and having been hymned, is filled with milk. This part of the sacrifice belongs to the Asvins: it is the offering of hot milk due to them, the Gharma proper.60 In this capacity, the Aitareya Brahma- na lauds the Gharma as divine intercourse. The vessel is the member, milk is the semen, ejac- ulated-while boiling-into the fire as the divine womb, the birthplace of the gods, as generation.61 Extending beyond the sacrifice, into the cosmos, Mahavira, creator, procreator, by begetting extends from the bottom to the top, penetrates and sup- ports heaven and earth.62 The coincidence within the same visual symbol, the Mahavira vessel, of tropes taken from the shape of man is not to be seen as an overlapping 58 Ait.B.4.1.21. 59 Ap.gS.15.6.2; 15.8.15-16. 60 In the Rg Veda, the Gharma was offered to the Asvins in a metal cauldron (RV.5.30.15) which has no original connection with the Mahavira clay pot. The Pravargya includes finally also an offering to Indra, of hot curds, the Dadhigharma. The Rg Vedic offering of hot milk to the Asvins became combined with the ritual of the red hot Mahavira pot. 61 Ait.B.4.1.22. 62 9ankh.9S.5.9.4; ASv.G.S.4.6.1, cf. AV.4.1; 2.4; cf. van Buitenen, p. 67. This recitation accompanied the first part of the Pravargya. of physical features. Each evocation conjured up an inner experience, valid in itself and not an image. The function of the lowest part of the pot is being felt as akin to that of feet; the top of the vessel, its opening, functions as mouth for liquid to be poured in and out. Or the entire pot is felt to function as the cosmic, procreative mem- ber, aggrandized as cosmic pillar. In another context, however, the Mukhalinga symbol of Siva is a visually materialized form of such coinciding tropes. In this visualized symbol, the linga how- ever had no procreative meaning. On the contrary, the concept of the ascending, not ejaculated but transubstantiated, semen as the substance of il- lumination is the motivating belief or experience that conjoins the shapes of phallus and head. The Mahavira vessel is not anthropomorphic. It re- leases in the ritual the experience of the creative power of the Sun by the conception of "Makha's Head" and again by an upsurge of procreative empathy of which the vessel becomes the lifiga- like symbol. The allusion to the figure of man however is implied throughout the sacrifice. In the Pravar- gya, at the conclusion of the entire sacrifice the implements of the sacrifice are assembled around the Mahavira pot either in the shape of man63 or in that of the sun. This alternative implies the transfiguration of man, the sacrificer, which is the purpose of the sacrifice. The sacrificer has reached the sun, "the radiant face of the gods, the eye of Mitra, Varuna and Agni."64 "With the sun's eye I gaze upon thee,"65 the priest had addressed the Mahavira vessel when it had been baked in the fire and he had lifted the pot on the gravel kept ready for it. "Were not the eye sun-like, never could it perceive the sun," thus Goethe worded a knowledge expressed by the priest in the ritual sun-gaze of recognition of the completed Maharira vessel. This cosmic realization comprises all beings. Mahavira, the sun, the All-encompas- sing Hero is addressed: "Mahavira, may all things regard me with the eye of a friend. May I regard all beings with the eye of a friend. With the eye of a friend do we regard one another."66 "Long may I live to look on thee."67 "Through a 63 gB.14.3.2.2; 14.2.2.16-22 and Baudhfyana; cf. van Buitenen, p. 130, note 6. 64 Ap.SS.15.16; RV.l.115.1. 65 Ap.SS.15.4.6-8; Manava SS.4.1.26. 66 Vaj.S.36.18. 67 Vaj.S.36.19. 232</page><page sequence="12">KRAMRISCH: Mahavira Vessel and Plant Putika hundred autumns may we see that bright eye, god appointed, rise."68 THE LATER AND SEPARATE LIVES OF MAHAV1RA AND PUTIKA Mahavira, the All-encompassing Hero, is also the name of the last Jina or Conqueror of the twenty four Jinas or Saviours (tirthankara) in the heterodox Jaina religion. His mythical life story is the exemplar for that of the other Tirthankaras. Before his birth his mother had fourteen prognostic dreams. In one of them she beheld a vessel, a "brimming vase." This vessel of abundance is a symbol of ultimate knowledge.69 In another frame of reference this vessel is also the Sun as vessel containing all time.70 The brimming vase is com- mon to the art of Buddhism and Hinduism. It is shown brimming with lotuses. They are particu- larly associated with the Lotus Goddess, Laksmi, Goddess of Plenty. The Mahavira vessel, how- ever, held no tangible contents. This sacred ves- sel as the All-encompassing Hero, the Sun, rules over space and time. In its Jain context it also holds that one supreme knowledge which has overcome the separateness of space and time, the manifoldness of the world. The iconology of the prognostic dream vessel seen by the mother-to-be of the Saviour and which prefigures his life on earth, however, differs from all the other sacred vessels represented in Indian art. It is known to us in the Western Indian school of painting after the fourteenth century. There it is shown flanked, at the height of its neck, by wide open, far-seeing eyes. They are painted next to the vessel, whatever be its shape, not on it. Together with it, they form an inseparable configuration showing with utmost clarity the vessel with the eyes that belong to it. Visually, this configuration combines, as a truly creative symbol, the presence of the sacred ves- sel and that of the all-seeing eyes which are its own. Floating on a monochrome coloured ground, they gaze, charged with the mystery of the sacred vessel, with the power of Mahavira.71 68 Vaj.S.36.24; RV.7.66.18. 69 Kevala-niina damsana; A. K.

Puitika starts with being a substitute for Soma, the drink of immortality, the elixir of life. Piltika qualifies for this part because Puitika is a mushroom reddish brown in colour. This mushroom amongst other reasons was chosen when the Soma plant, the fly-agaric, gradually became unavailable, in preference to other indigenous mushrooms for its being conspicuous or notice- able by the bad smell the cut mushroom develops. Hence also its name Pfitika. Once chosen in lieu of Soma, Putika usurped as its own the name "Syenabhrta" and the myth of Soma's origin from on high. The substitute became authenticated as the original. A gap of more than two and a half millennia, a transfer from Aryan priestly symbolism to tribal belief, the tribe adopting a Sanskrit name with but little change into its own language, the sur- vival of this name in a Munda language, in a region at a considerable distance to the east from the ancient center of Brahmanical sacrifices, all this did not impair the ongoing myth of Piltika. This species is known to the Santal as "endowed with a soul." It is distinct from other mushrooms, from all the vegetable kingdom as being numinous. The odor of sanctity clings to this mushroom, however pejorative its telling name. The sanctity of the Mahavira vessel as artifact and symbol, judging by the pristine technique of shaping the earthern pot, would belong to an age far beyond the age of the Brahmanas. Deified, the Mahavira pot is the center of a ritual, entirely its own. The very making of it is part of the ritual. In this respect this pottery ritual may be grouped with the "brick piling" ritual of the Vedic altar,72 but also with the function of the potterpriest in South India today.73 The Maha- devices. On the other hand, the conception of the Sun- eye, as eye "per se" more or less independent of the face of the figure is one of the main factors in the style of the \estern Indian school of painting, cf. S. Kramrisch, "Western Indian Painting," under publication by Bha- gawan Mahavir 2500th Nirvan Mahotsava Samiti, Bom- bay, 1974. 72 The square ukha made of clay which held the heads of the five sacrificial victims was part of the sacrificial pile. It was neither the central cult object nor even a cult object in its own right. 73 S.

The vessel is dried by the heat of the sun and baked in a fiery pit. In the culmi- nating ritual its validity is established in glowing glory wreathed in flames as symbol of the Sun or the Head of Makha, the cosmic giant.74 The worship and disposal-the whole ritual- of Mahfvira, though part only of the total Pra- vargya sacrifice are organised with the finality of perfection. The incongruity of an empty earthen vessel as symbol for Makha's head, the Sun, seems inexplicable. Yet a symbol is what one makes it to mean. The mouth or nose of the pot are as sug- gestive as are the implements in the final laying out of all the paraphernalia of the Pravargya, where they are understood to reconstruct the shape of man. Three pots (the original and the two reserve pots should the original crack) form the "head," the unclipped broom that had been used in the ritual is placed above the head, so as to form a hair tuft, the tongs are the shoulders, and so on, the straws of the other broom are scat- tered over the configuration that embodies the essence of man, so as to form its muscles.75 What- ever took part in the sacrifice, becomes part of the transfiguration of sacrificial man. The con- figuration of the paraphernalia of the sacrifice is vested with their composite magic. If the im- plements are arranged in a way so as to conjure up an image of the sun, the same purpose is fulfilled. The head of sacrificial, transfigured man is represented by the three Mahavira pots, each of them is the head of the sacrifice-even though only one played its role. Though there are three they mean one and the same only. In the sac- rifice Makha's Head is the sun, the pot is Makha's head, the pot is the sun. The pot is the head though it is unlike a head. The pot is made by the priest, the Adhvaryu, or he delegates this task to a potter (kartr, "the maker"). The pot is the sun, is Makha's head, the head of the sacrifice not by a likeness of its shape but by that of another quality which has its maximum effect at the cul- mination of the sacrificial heating of the vessel. It is then that Mahavira, anointed with butter and, heated to the highest degree, attains the fieriness of the sun. It had been covered with a golden dish so that it should protect heaven from its 74 Cf. RV.10.171.2; and, above, p. 225. 75 Ap.S,15,15.,1. heat.76 The "All-encompassing Hero, glowing gold-colored, encompasses as sun, the horizons of heaven. "77 In South India of the present day, the cult of Aiyanar requires clay images of Aiyanar and his retinue. They are made by the village potter who is at the same time the officiating priest. He is a Kusavan by caste, son of a Brahman father and a gudra woman.78 Did clay, being baked in the fire and turning from earth to glowing splen- dor, effect in a potter-priest an initiation through the potter's craft, familar only with his sundried output? Did he behold the fiery sun glowing in his own work? Did the sun cult of the Mahavira pot arise amongst potters and make them priests of their calling ? Was it a cult indigenously Indian where the heat of the sun is as powerful as its splendor so that transposed into a rite the glow of the earthen pot and the vehemence of the flames are intensified by the anointing of the vessel? It was made by hand, the clay pressed into shape by the thumbs without a potter's wheel. This pristine technique was hallowed. It had arisen from direct contact, preserved the shape and the manner in which the vessel had been fashioned when the sediments of more than one myth were integrated in its substance and when the Sun vessel once-finished was not to be touched by human hands. It was not to be touched by human hands for its heat would have burnt them. The vessel was not to be touched because it was sacred. It was not to be touched so that the only contact with the sacred object was by sight, sight intensified to the exclusion of all other sensory perceptions, a rite of "seeing" a communion by vision. An indigenous sun cult celebrated by the ritual of its craft became the "Head of the sacrifice" and Makha's head was joined to its body. Symbols live their own lives, draw to themselves their af- finities, coalesce with them and emerge showing in various facets an identity of ambience of meaning. Mahavira, in the Aitareya Brahmana, encompasses all creation, in the intensity of the climactic moment of procreation. The vessel now stands for the Lifiga. Head and procreative organ are coterminous yet do not overlap in the vision of the Brahmanas. 76 Ap.gS.15.8.5a; Laty.SS.1.6.24; gfakhayana gS.5.9. 13; van Buitenen, 77. 77 Cf. Ap.gS.15.6.2. 78 S.

The Mukhalinga of Siva, the phallus with a head or heads, is a concretely realised sculptural form perduring for two thousand years of Indian art, though with a total reversal of the implied meaning which here extols antithetically the power of cre- ative heat as fervor of ascetic sublimation not as a spending into the fiery lap of all gods-to-be but as a self-contained rarification and ascent of this power. On another facet of its meaning, Makha's head, the Sun, the All-encompassing, All-seeing eye of the world, fastens its steady gaze on all and every- one. The brimming vase sends forth this glance in eyes that are painted outside its shape, bestowing the power of sight and insight. Two vessels over- lap in this Jain rendering of ancient themes. The one is the MahSvira pot, which the "Unbounded," Aditi, is invoked to encompass.79 It contains 79 Taitt.Ar.4.2.6; Aditi, "the Boundless," is invoked to ultimate knowledge and all time. These are in- tangible contents. The other vessel is the "full pot" (plurna ghata), the brimming vase of plenty, Laksmi herself. The symbolism of the Mahavira vessel is deeply ensconced and has manifold connections in Indian thought and art. Piutika, on the other hand, only contributes to the substance of the vessel. The mantle of King Soma had fallen on this notable mushroom, which inherits the glory of Soma for whom it is a surrogate. Its heyday is in the Pra- vargya ritual. Then the mushroom is lost to us in a millennial darkness from which, miraculously, it emerges "endowed with a soul" amongst the aboriginal Santal of Eastern India in our own day. comprise its cavity, gB.14.2.7; Manava SS.4.3.1 invokes the cow as Idia, Aditi and Sarasvati. While on one level the cow whose milk will fill the pot is Aditi, on the highest level Aditi remains Boundlessness itself. 235</page></plain_text>
