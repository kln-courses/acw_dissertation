<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Banquet-Libations of the Greeks. By DELIGHT TOLLES. Vii, I 14 pages. Bryn Mawr Col- lege, Bryn Mawr I943 (Dissertation) This dissertation, prepared under the supervision of Professor L. R. Taylor, reviews all that is known of the libations poured at Greek banquets, for the authoress says she has "collected, co6rdinated and in- terpreted the available evidence" about this ritual act, which a reading of the book amply confirms. While the subject is treated incidentally in all histories of Greek religion, she has written an authoritative and definitive accord in extenso of this little known rite in the domestic religion of Greece. The Introduction defines the terms "banquet" and "libation." The former was a private secular feast which in the classical period consisted of a dinner fol- lowed by a drinking party devoted to pleasure, though, it must be added, often ending in wild gaiety and even bloody strife as in Lucian's parody and on various vase- painuings (e.g. Hartwig, Meisterschalen, Taf. LX); the latter was the ordinary rite of pouring wine to a god or gods on various solemn occasions of which the banquet-libation was a special case at the beginning of the symposium when drinking was introduced. Miss Tolles discusses her subject in three chapters. In the first (8-37), a monograph by itself comparable with Hug's two articles in R.E. s.v. Symposion, cc. I266-70 and Symposion-Literatur, cc. I273-82, and as a pre- liminary to the main subject, she treats the Greek banquet in general where the libation was poured. In the second she discusses the libation in honor of the traditional gods which followed the hand washings, wreaths and incense in which all the guests shared. In the third a secondary rite in treated which is distinct from the former and which she calls "Sacred Drinks," not libations in the usual sense, but performed by the guests individually in honor of certain minor functional spirits or Sondergotter of the household who were nearer to men than the great figures of the pantheon. The source-material for such a study, since the ban- quet as one of the chief forms of entertainment was so important in Greek social life, ranges over most of Greek literature from the epic onwards and includes all writers who describe or even mention it. Because of the extension of the subject, Miss Tolles has limited her preview largely to the fifth and fourth centuries B.C. when descriptive material is most abundant. Here, in the first line, are the Symposia of Xenophon and Plato; the former at the house of Callias in Athens during the celebration of the Panathenaea in which the character of Socrates is delineated and the conver- sation is on the nature of love; the latter at the house of Agathon in honor of the latter's first tragic victory on the stage in 4I6 B.C., when the guests entertained themselves with encomiums on the god of love rather than, as usual, with diversions over the cups. Then there are late imitations of these, only two of which have survived, Plutarch's "Dinner of the Seven Wise Men" (Mor. I46B-64) whose scene is laid two cen- turies before Xenophon and Plato, and Lucian's Ban- quet, a humorous attack on philosophers. And to these must be added Athenaeus' discursive Deipno- sophistae which at least keeps the symposium form. Such primal sources are supplemented by Attic comedy in which the banquet is an integral part of the action, especially in plays of Aristophanes. Of his eleven plays only one, The Thesmophoriazusae, omits a de- scription of a banquet and only because (5, n. 14) its action falls on the second day of the Thesmophoria, a day of fasting, while the Wasps and Ecclesiazusae pre- sent full descriptions. A fragment of the comic poet Plato, contemporary of Aristophanes, gives many details. Tragedy, on the other hand, adds but little since it transports ordinary Athenians of the fifth century B.C. back into the Heroic Age whose aristo- cratic characters, like those of the epic and lyric, dis- play only conservative respect for the customs of the symposium. The Ion of Euripides alone (I 122ff.) pre- sents a complete account of such a banquet. Of the three divisions of the dissertation the third, called "Sacred Drinks," interested the reviewer most, i.e. the drinks taken by the guests from cups as offer- ings to individual minor divine spirits. Athenaeus men- tions three of these-Agathos daimon, an impersonal divine agency, Zeus Soter, protector of the household</page><page sequence="2">CLASSICAL WEEKLY 135 rather than the maiestic head of the Olympians, and Hygeia, a lesser figure in the official religion, while Pollux, who wrote before A.D. 177, names a fourth, Hermes, also a house-guardian. To these four the after- dinner cups were usually dedicated, though archaeology has supplied further names inscribed on cups of the fourth century B.C. and later such as Athena, Eirene, Dionysus, etc., and certain deified abstractions such as Harmonia, even though some of these have been classed by some as pledge-cups. Such dedicatory drinks were not libations since no offerings were poured, nor toasts since they honored divinities and not men. These four are discussed at length, especially the contested identity of Agathos daimon (77-90) whose cup was passed around the banqueters at the close of the symposium, each of whom in tum tasted its contents. As an anthropomorphic deity Agathos daimon was late, but as an impersonal agency early, its identity not yet established (78, n.4), though the Swedish scholar 0. Jakobsson in his Daimon och Agathos Daimon (2nd ed. 1925) mentions (151) seven different interpreta- tions. It was probably, as Miss Tolles concludes, merely an active divine force, an outgrowth of primi- tive demonology, through whose agency the individual might hope for prosperity. While the libation was poured by one from wine furnished by all to the traditional gods collectively, the "Sacred Drinks" were offered individually to individual lesser divinities. In the sixth century B.C., as evidenced by Xenophanes, the libation was still a solemn act of homage at the symposium, but by the late fifth, as shown by Plato Comicus, it had lost its religious mean- ing and become a mere convention since by then the old religious associations of the banquet had been lost. In Philoxenes, the dithyrambic poet contemporary with Plato Comicus, who has left a satirical description of a symposium based on the luxury of the Sicilian court of the Elder Dionysius, no libation is mentioned, although this may have been due (49, n. 37) to the fragmentary state of the poem. It was a communal act since the wine was shared by the gods while the "Sacred Drinks" were for the guests alone. In this connection the authoress points out (Concl.) the well-known phenomenon that as the State-religion waned the common people still clung to its traditional ceremonies and that the Age of Enlightenment, ushered in by Socrates and Euripides, was also the age in which temple-building and festival-observance were at their height. When the official religion collapsed and, in Nilsson's phrase, became "a shell without a kernel" out- ward religious forms were still kept up with the old- time pomp. This, it might be added, was also the case with decadent Roman religion and explains in part Augustus' revival in face of rationalistic philospohy and loss of faith in the old Roman detities. Thus, in Greek symposium the "Sacred Drinks" gradually eclipsed the libation to the great gods. The latter became a formality while the former still typified the real ex- pression of conservative religion. Miss Tolles has done an excellent piece of research with industry and accuracy. Her dissertation is a real contribution to a little-known phase of Greek domestic religion and leaves little to criticise. One notes, how- ever, the omission of the usual Vita and Index and more so that of a bibliography of works consulted. The copious notes, nearly four hundred entries, are numbered by chapters, but the oft-repeated op. cit. should have its limitations and refer no further back than the first appearance of the citation in each chapter. The reviewer was perplexed in locating one title which he finally found seventy-six pages back of its op. cit. He also mildly protests against using English names of places of publication for German or other foreign titles, e.g. Munich for Miinchen (66, n. I04, etc.) though retaining Leipzig for Leipsic (I2, n. 14), and German and French names for those of Latin titles, e.g. Leipzig for Lipsiae and Paris for Parisiis as in the Table of collected fragments on page vii.
