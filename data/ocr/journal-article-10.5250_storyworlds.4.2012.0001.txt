<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Rethinking Narrativity A Return to Aristotle and Some Consequences Nick Davis When does a fl ow of information become a narrative?  Intuitively, the answer is obvious, albeit circular: it be- comes a narrative when it tells a story, and we know a  story when we meet one, a satisfactory story being— let us say—a presentation of some more-or-less con- nected or connectable sequence of events, involving  human or human-like agents, that occur in the sto- ry’s own posited world, usually but not always differ- ent from the one in which communication of the sto- ry happens. A fl ow of information that satisfi es all or  most of such “story” criteria may be considered to pass  a tipping point beyond which we classify it as narra- tive. This answer and others developed along similar  lines are assuredly not foolish, for the simple reason  that we do indeed know how to produce and receive  stories; hence the appeal to folk knowledge concerning  “story” produces solid reassurance. Intuitive security about the nature of “story” yields  in turn one of modern narratology’s familiar imple- ments, the story-discourse distinction, often critiqued  </page> <page sequence="2"> but still widely deployed in varying degrees of refi nement1: if “story” is  some presentation of connected or connectable events, then “discourse”  can name everything that is done to story in the presenting of it, as for  example in the recounting of posited events nonchronologically. But  setting up and making use of the story-discourse distinction does noth- ing, of course, to clarify the nature of story itself, or to make story’s rec- ognition less of an intuitive, aconceptual business. In reasoning of this  kind folk knowledge supplies the idea of story, which then yields the  idea of discourse as its counterpart and complement. We remain in the  position of fi sh trying to discuss the nature of water, a medium with  which lived experience makes us thoroughly acquainted while at the  same time withholding the conditions under which we can separate off  our intuitive registration of it and determine its objective properties.  But fi sh are, one feels, the more to be excused for their lack of objectiv- ity concerning water, since they are obliged to live in it continuously,  whereas human beings know with folk certainty that not all the relay- ings of information that they receive are stories, and that they are not  immersed in the story medium all the time. The aim of the discussion that follows is to identify key distinguishing  properties of narrative discourse. “Discourse” here is not being opposed  to “story,” but, rather, certain infl ections of discourse are treated as giv- ing rise to the effect of “story.” It is useful to begin by examining Monika  Fludernik’s recent, infl uential theoretical attempt to supersede the sto- ry-discourse distinction by identifying the basic material, distinct from  story, out of which narrative discourse is made. Fludernik very interest- ingly treats this basic material as occurring naturally rather than arising  purposely or through artful arrangement. A critique of Fludernik’s ap- proach, followed by a rereading of Aristotle’s discussion of tragic narra- tive, highlights how narrative’s appearance of being fashioned from a ba- sic and natural material is an effect that certain infl ections of discourse  produce. My concluding section further develops the approach by iden- tifying characteristic tropes of narrative-delivering discourse. Fludernik’s Natural Narratology and the Foundations of Narrativity Fludernik’s Towards a “Natural” Narratology (1996), along with a fol- low-up essay from 2003, famously and controversially attempted to  2 storyworlds volume 4 2012 </page> <page sequence="3"> transfer story’s widely assumed role in the minimum constitution of  narrative to what is termed “experientiality.” “There can,” Fludernik  writes, “be narratives without plot [with one acceptation of that term  corresponding to “story”], but there cannot be any narratives without  a human (anthropomorphic) experience of some sort at some narra- tive level” (1996: 13). The later essay explains that the concept of experi- entiality was introduced out of a concern “to characterize the purpose  and function of the storytelling as a process that captures the narrator’s  past experience, reproduces it in a vivid manner, and then evaluates and  resolves it in terms of the protagonist’s reactions and of the narrator’s  often explicit linking of the meaning of this experience with the current  discourse context” (2003: 245). For Fludernik, in other words, narratives  are made out of virtual experiences and are also about them. I wish to  consider what might be at stake in attempting to place the human (an- thropomorphic) experiencer, not the making/receiving of stories, at the  center of the phenomenon of narrativity, as well as the associated claim  that this move establishes a natural basis for narrative study. Recent discussion of narrative has opened up several perspectives in  which the making of stories might be considered to be a natural activ- ity. To identify the most conspicuous of these perspectives, and roughly  following the shape of Fludernik’s argument: (A) Stories arise spon- taneously and pervasively in the telling of jokes, anecdotes, reports of  owned or vicarious experience, and the like. In William Labov’s (1972)  well-known account, spontaneous oral narratives possess certain shared  formal characteristics; in particular the narrator must show that the  narrative is coming to a point, making for meaningful evaluation. (B)  The making of stories appeals to the “natural attitude” of a society or  culture, systematically unrecognized by it as convention and text, de- ploying a discourse that, as Jonathan Culler (1975) puts it, “requires no  explanation because it seems to derive directly from the structure of  the world. We speak of people as having minds and bodies, as thinking,  imagining, remembering, feeling pain, loving and hating, etc., and do  not have to justify such discourse by adducing philosophical arguments.  It is simply the text of the natural attitude, at least in Western culture,  and hence vraisemblable” (140–41). Culler goes on to explain that the re- covery/assertion of what a culture takes to be natural commonly occurs  Davis: Rethinking Narrativity 3 </page> <page sequence="4"> in readerly reception of narrative: “When a text uses such discourse it is  to that extent inherently intelligible, and when it deviates from such dis- course the reader’s tendency is to translate its ‘metaphors’ back into this  natural language” (141). Drawing on the ideas of Russian formalist crit- icism, Culler calls the second of these activities “naturalization” (137).  (C) Fludernik’s emphasis on experientiality over plot derives some of its  authority from (A) and develops on (B): narrativity as a phenomenon  of narrative production and reception “is constituted by [. . .] experien- tiality, namely the quasi-mimetic evocation of ‘real-life’ experience,” re- fl ecting “a cognitive schema of embodiedness that relates to human ex- istence and human concerns” and making for “emotional involvement,  evaluative or empathetic” (1996: 12–13, 318). In this account the human  life-related cognitive schema that narrative’s evocations of experience  refl ect plainly does not derive from narrative performance but logically  precedes it and makes it possible. A question suggests itself here, however: what exactly is the natural  being distinguished from or opposed to in these characterizations of  narrativity? As Fludernik very pertinently comments, common-sense  opposition of the natural to the artifi cial requires deconstruction: since  “the human is both part of nature and constitutive of civilisation [. . .]  [a]nything concerning man in his civilized habitat and his living-act- ing-working conditions [. . .] inevitably discredits the nature-culture  dichotomy and the very artifi cial distinction between the natural and  the contrived” (1996: 19).2 The last phrase seems to concede the prin- ciple that every human culture proposes its own distinctions, typically  on a shifting basis, between what is respectively attributed to “culture”  and to “nature.”3 Nevertheless, discussion of narrative in the manner  of A and C, above, seems to require a dichotomization of nature and  culture, where nature is the privileged category, to do important work.  In Culler’s exposition of B, “naturalization” as the recuperation of dis- course for a going “natural attitude” will occur in every cultural setting,  but differently, in the service of particular constructions of the natural.  By contrast, the “natural” in “natural narrative” is on the side of univer- sality, whereas the “non-natural” is on the side of the differentiated as  found in local contexts, and thus of what has been inferrably construct- ed in order to achieve particular ends. 4 storyworlds volume 4 2012 </page> <page sequence="5"> As I go on to discuss below, the distinction between the natural and  the non-natural has a large Western cultural substratum, most visible in  classical discussion of what occurs differently in the spheres of techne,  human craft and contrivance, and of physis, the activity of nature.  Within the framework of A, in Fludernik’s interpretation of it, if spon- taneous conversational storytelling is to be treated as the “principal and  originary narrative schema” (1996: 323), it has to be set apart from any  “more literary (i.e. institutionalized) form of storytelling [such as oral  poetry] that cannot lay a claim to being ‘natural’ in the same manner  or to the same extent as conversational narration” (14). In Fludernik’s  C, which transposes “naturalization” into “narrativization” and bids to  transcend the perspective of cultural difference, “the natural [. . .] corre- sponds to the human,” and fi nds its practical-cum-conceptual anchor- ing in “human everyday experience” (19), presumably in universal ev- eryday experience. What is based in the experiential, so understood, can  therefore be opposed to more extrinsic and contrived features of story- telling, such as the elaboration of plot, which Fludernik terms “storifi - cation” (34). “Experience” is usually offered as the English translation  of German Erfahrung. We may note in this connection that Erfahrung,  cognate with fahren, “to travel,” carries a rather different semantic  weighting from the English word and implies a synthesis of what prac- tical activity or experimentation has uncovered; connotatively this is a  journey completed or known. An Erfahrung that already does some of  the same things as narrative might plausibly be treated as narrativity’s  naturally occurring ur-material. But this is a large phenomenological  claim and not one that natural narratology has offered to substantiate. The identifi cation of what is natural within narrative, because it is  founded in experience, as distinct from the supplementary provisions  of storifi cation, differs from the identifi cation of narrative as a primary  resource for the organization of experience, in the interests, say, of con- structing memory, of making time a matter of conscious perception,  or of arriving at a sense of personal or group identity. As Werner Wolf  (2003) observes, “the importance of narrativity for the experience of re- ality is by now a well-established idea; opinions are, however, divided  concerning the origins and truth value of narrativity” (195n92). Many  would broadly accept Jerome Bruner’s (1990) contention that if “fram- Davis: Rethinking Narrativity 5 </page> <page sequence="6"> ing provides a means of ‘constructing’ a world, of characterizing its fl ow,  of segmenting events within that world, and so on, [. . .] [t]he typical  form of framing experience (and our memory of it) is in narrative form”  (56). Paul Ricoeur’s (1984) philosophically ambitious argument proposes  that “time becomes human time to the extent that it is organized after  the manner of a narrative” (1: 17).4 In statements like these concerning  the major importance of narrativity as a schema for the ordering of ex- perience, the governing distinction is not between the natural and the  artifi cial, but between the intelligible-because-orderly and the contin- gent or chaotic—with this distinction applying both to the socially em- bedded actions of human beings and to processes in the natural world.  Seen in this aspect, narrativity is one of human culture’s most character- istic products, an ordering of experience in the interests of conceptual  stability, achieved at the cost of fi ltering out or suppressing or rearrang- ing some of the data that experience provides.5 Viewed in this light it  undoubtedly possesses some of the properties of an artifact. Fludernik’s entirely admirable purpose is, as Andrew Gibson (1997)  puts it, to repudiate “the old, procrustean, binary categories so favoured  by a bullish, pseudo-scientifi c narratology from the sixties through to  the eighties” (234), which depended on unchallenged operational dis- tinctions such as those between story and discourse, or character and  narrator. In these couplings the fi rst item is assigned more to the sphere  of nature and the second more to that of art and contrivance, with the  consequence that the relatively technical activity can be understood as  mediating the relatively natural phenomenon. We fi nd, however, that  whatever its declared intentions, natural narratology as currently con- stituted has reinstated the physis/techne distinction at a different level,  in opposing the authentically experiential to the noncore, secondary  procedures of storifi cation. In summary, it has transferred storymaking  (along with mimesis, of which it is taken to be a key component6) from  the category of physis to that of techne, leaving behind what should be  the natural ore of Erfahrung. Rethinking Narrativity: Aristotelian Perspectives It may, however, be possible to conceive of a narratology that uses issues  raised by the physis/techne distinction in order to re-engage with the  6 storyworlds volume 4 2012 </page> <page sequence="7"> formation of narrative experience. Western narratology’s founding text  offers considerable assistance in doing this. The argument of Aristotle’s  Poetics (1995) is substantially underwritten by the distinction of techne  and physis. As in other Aristotelian texts, however, these two forms of  activity, though posited as distinct, are set in a thought-provoking,  counterpoised relationship that allows them to bear differently on the  phenomenon of narrative mimesis. Narrativity as the Poetics conceives it  has, I argue, determinants that are considerably more complex than has  been generally allowed. Aristotle offers no defi nition of mimesis—in its primary sense, a  miming of something—and “imitation” will have to do as a working  equivalent. Aristotle sees mimesis as being natural to human beings,7  a spontaneously occurring activity that is found everywhere and that  techne (craft, know-how, artistry) can shape into something that is ac- complished, creating an object that is appropriate for and worthy of in- tellectual appraisal. For Aristotle, one of the most impressive instances  of such a shaping of mimesis by techne has occurred in the development  of a tragic drama at Athens, the Poetics’ main focus of attention. Aris- totle’s examination of tragedy as a perfected mimetic art forms part of  a larger philosophical enquiry into techne, physis, and the relationship  between them. Here, techne as such has no special affi nity with mimesis  (there are plenty of crafts whose products do not imitate objects in na- ture), but it does have a special affi nity with physis, nature as grasped in  its characteristic mode of activity. Briefl y, in Aristotle’s philosophy the activity of things in nature  moves purposefully toward the achievement of an end, a telos. And in  the same way, the making of things by means of techne moves purpose- fully toward an end, in this case arrival at a product: the techne of med- icine produces health; the techne of building, houses; and so on. But  whereas natural things contain the principle of movement toward an  end within themselves (an acorn has it in itself to become an oak), tech- nical operations are directed from outside, by the agency of the techni- cian or artist and by the purpose of producing a specifi ed product (a  piece of wood doesn’t have it in itself to become a table, a representa- tive technical product). This assumedly radical similarity and dissimi- larity between physis and techne play a very important role in Aristo- Davis: Rethinking Narrativity 7 </page> <page sequence="8"> telian thought: if art or craft makes things in the same way as nature  does—that is, in purposive movement toward a telos, an end8—then art  or craft and nature become extremely valuable explicative models of  one another (see Wolff 2007: 54). At the same time, however, we stand  in no danger of confusing the techne that makes a table with the physis  that makes a tree, since physis as such is not subject to human control,  and human product-making is not a natural phenomenon. In view of  this distinctive confi guring of thought, it is necessary to read Aristotle’s  discussion of tragic performances in two different ways: (1) as an ac- count of a highly achieved biomimesis, where a product of techne takes  over many of the characteristics of a living thing; and (2), as an account  of specifi cally technical procedures that does not form part of a philo- sophical envisioning of organic life. In viewpoint (1) Aristotle sees the tragic drama known to him as a  highly sophisticated, near-defi nitive technical achievement. It is there- fore fi tting that the Poetics should present it as possessing to an unusual  degree the characteristics of a natural organism. The text’s use of bio- logical analogy is also shaped by a tradition of Greek thought accord- ing to which the accomplished artist or craftsman, a kind of Daedalus,  is capable of producing artifacts that present a convincing semblance  of life, often in the form of a capacity for motion (see Morris 1992). (A  classic instance is Hephaestus’s manufacture of self-moving tripods that  serve the assembled gods, as described in the Iliad 18.372–79.) For Ar- istotle the accomplished dramatist’s apparently living creatures, in this  conception, are not the characters who fi gure in tragedies but the trag- edies themselves: although tragedies are not, in the ordinary sense, alive  like animals, they can be understood to possess in full a number of their  characteristics. Individual tragedies are members of the species tragedy  that, we are told, “ceased to evolve [once] it had achieved its own na- ture” (Poetics, chap. 4; 43) in the hands of Aeschylus and Sophocles.9 A  properly formed tragedy, like an animal of a given species, possesses a  recognizable structure of parts, in this case a beginning, a middle, and  an end standing in orderly connection (see chap. 7; 55; I discuss this pas- sage in more detail below).10 Moreover, like other beautiful objects, in- cluding those that are alive, a tragedy should be available to the mind  for contemplation as a whole at one moment (via theoria, the condition  8 storyworlds volume 4 2012 </page> <page sequence="9"> of making proper intellectual appraisal). This condition in turn places  constraints on the size of its plot: Besides, a beautiful object, whether an animal or anything else with a  structure of parts, should have not only its parts ordered but also an  appropriate magnitude: beauty consists in magnitude and order, which  is why there could not be a beautiful animal which was either minuscule  (as contemplation of it, occurring in an almost imperceptible moment,  has no distinctness) or gigantic (as contemplation of it has no cohesion,  but those who contemplate it lose a sense of unity and wholeness),  say an animal a thousand miles long. So just as with our bodies and  with animals beauty requires magnitude, but magnitude that allows  coherent perception, likewise plots require length, but length that can be  coherently remembered. (chap. 7; 55–57) Most crucially a tragedy possesses something akin to a soul, described  in Aristotle’s De Anima as “a substance which corresponds to the ac- count [or principle] (arche) of a thing” (1984, 1: 657; 412b) which ani- mates it: “Plot (muthos), then, is the [. . .] principle and, as it were, soul  (psuche) of tragedy, while character (ethos, form) is secondary” (chap. 6;  53). Plot has been defi ned as “the mimesis of the action” (chap. 6; 49),  and tragedy’s mimesis as being “not of persons but of action and life”  (praxeos kai biou; chap. 6; 51). It is in the virtual life principle of plot, a  made thing that operates as the soul does in animals, that life as such is  convincingly mimed. Small wonder, then, that the plot is treated as the  dramatist’s masterwork: “the poet [poietes, ‘maker’] should be more a  maker of plots than of verses, in so far as he is a poet by virtue of mime- sis” (chap. 9; 61); even a tragic plot recited without stage performance  produces, we are told, the emotions of tragedy in the hearer (see chap.  14; 73–74). Aristotle’s treatment of tragedies as having a soul is, then, a thought- provoking way of characterizing the structure—as it were, the engineer- ing—of tragedies considered from the standpoint of physis as life-imitat- ing fabricated creatures. Talos, the bronze man who guarded Crete (and  in some accounts an artifact made by Hephaestus), was animated by a  liquor called ichor that ran through his veins; when the blood-like ichor  drained out of him he died—or rather, “died,” since he was never alive  Davis: Rethinking Narrativity 9 </page> <page sequence="10"> in the usual sense. Muthos, considered as tragedy’s indwelling principle  or soul, is, however, better than ichor, since in Aristotle’s account even a  small part of it cannot be taken away or altered without compromising  the integrity of the whole. The psuche for Aristotle (1984) is not a divis- ible substance but the indivisible principle by which a given animal is  what it is, namely, alive, and in a particular way: “Suppose that the eye  were an animal—sight would have been its soul” (1.657; 412b). Muth- os should therefore be, on the “soul” analogy, entirely resistant to local  tampering. As the Poetics has it, “the plot, since it is the mimesis of an  action, should be of a unitary and indeed whole action; and the compo- nent events should be so structured that if any is displaced or removed,  the [. . .] whole is disturbed and dislocated” (chap. 9; 59). One notices  that in this last statement the unitary nature of muthos is also treated as  a characteristic of the action imitated: muthos becomes a place of imag- ined convergence and correspondence between what is done by “people  in action (prattontas)” (chap. 2; 33), the object of imitation that forms  part of a scene of life, and what is made present in a dramatic action  possessed of nature-simulating life because, courtesy of metaphor, it is  endowed with a soul. Nevertheless, as Aristotle’s viewpoint (2) suggests, organicist model- ing in the Poetics is not the whole of the story when it comes to plot or  muthos. There is another kind of statement that fully complements it in  that it is elaborated as an account of tragedy’s techne or engineering in  those respects in which it does not replicate the living unity of an ani- mal. The clearest instance is the account of recognition (anagnorisis):  “Recognition, as the very name indicates, is a change from ignorance  to knowledge, leading to friendship or to enmity, and involving mat- ters which bear on prosperity or adversity. The fi nest recognition is that  which occurs simultaneously with reversal (peripeteia) [‘a change to the  opposite direction of events’], as with the one in the Oedipus” (chap. 11;  65). This statement fl atly abandons the principle that the plot should be  conceived only as a whole, as the object of “coherent perception,” and  instead suggests that plotting involves a continuous (re)establishment  of what there is to be perceived. Aristotle’s anagnorisis is a central fi g- ure’s abrupt coming to awareness of some previously hidden aspect of  her or his real situation, giving up or drastically revising what appeared  10 storyworlds volume 4 2012 </page> <page sequence="11"> to be valid knowledge of the same. And by implication it is the audi- ence’s undergoing of a similar cognitive transition: what has looked en- tirely like that now looks entirely like this. “Recognition” is not a wholly  adequate translation of anagnorisis since Aristotle writes of a narrative  transition that involves not only an enlightening discovery of knowl- edge but, with equal consequence, a discrediting and loss of the knowl- edge that has, up to this moment, seemed entirely secure. As Terence  Cave (1988) notes, anagnorisis “makes the world and the text intelligible.  Yet it is also a shift into the implausible: the secret unfolded lies beyond  the realm of common experience. [. . .] Anagnorisis links the recovery  of knowledge with a disquieting sense, when the trap is sprung, that  the commonly accepted co-ordinates of knowledge have gone awry”  (1–2). The effect of anagnorisis arises through the shaping of a story’s  telling in such a way as to throw open to question what has been told,  along with the assumed value for narrative comprehension of narra- tive-produced experience itself. The concept of anagnorisis certainly jars  against its own text’s neighboring account of a unitary muthos whose  “soul” corresponds to a single, through-running, indivisible encoding  for comprehension. Putting these two complementary accounts (1 and 2) together, as the  argument of the Poetics invites us to do, we arrive at two different con- ceptions of narrative experience, of the experience that is likely to be of- fered by any competent narrative performance. By “experience” we now  mean, of course, what happens in the production and reception of nar- rative, as distinct from the refl ection of a pre-existing cognitive schema  that is mediated in the production and reception of narrative. On the  one hand, as the Poetics has it, narrative performance in the instance of  tragedy presents an experience that can be envisaged, by analogy with  a living creature, as unifi ed and interconnected. Aristotle according- ly identifi es plot (muthos, also translatable as “story”), qua perceptible  unity, as a play’s dominant life-simulating component: a whole living  thing, the metaphorical animal whose soul is muthos, mimes another  whole thing, a temporal-spatial scene of actions that human or human- like beings perform. The construction of muthos, a technical product  that ideally bears the stamp of the natural, needs to be overseen by vigi- lant concern for internal connectivity and continuity. The Poetics pro- Davis: Rethinking Narrativity 11 </page> <page sequence="12"> poses, in a formulation that has profoundly infl uenced Western theo- retical understanding of narrative, that tragedy is mimesis of an action that is complete, whole, and  of magnitude [that is, neither too large nor too minuscule]. [. . .] A  whole is that which has a beginning, middle, and end. A beginning  is that which does not of itself follow from something else, but after  which a further event or process naturally occurs. An end, by contrast,  is that which itself naturally occurs, whether necessarily or usually,  after a preceding event, but need not be followed by anything else. A  middle is that which both follows a preceding event and has further  consequences. Well-constructed plots, therefore, should neither begin  nor end at an arbitrary point, but should make use of the patterns  stated. (chap. 7; 55) Such is plot’s ideal articulation of narrative experience in the interests  of imitating whole actions as wholes. But on the other hand, and at the  same time, the narrative experience of tragedy as the Poetics conceives  it also encompasses a certain fracturing of wholeness. Its engineering is  cleverly biomimetic, as distinct from biological, and possesses features  that are best considered as techne’s own distinctive contribution to a  tragic play’s unfolding design. Anagnorisis in particular very conspicu- ously challenges the apparent security of knowledge gathered through  narrative experience and disrupts the unfolding of narrative experience  insofar as this is taken to possess self-continuity. Extrapolating from these Aristotelian insights, in what follows I go  on to suggest that this duality and complementarity of narrative expe- riences—their combination of gestalt wholeness with whole-resisting  particularity—is not only pervasive in stories but in fact constitutive of  narrativity as such. Indeed, both of these two aspects of narrative expe- riences may be understood as being “like life” and “about life,” though  in different senses. Storymaking as pseudo-physis is a means of encoun- tering and conceptually grasping a sequence of actions considered ho- listically. By virtue of some of the features of its construction it is also  a means of encountering sequences of human (anthropomorphic) ac- tions that resist holistic conceptualization, given stories’ capacity to pro- duce experiences of disorientation for the observer or participant. Both  12 storyworlds volume 4 2012 </page> <page sequence="13"> are, however, aspects of narrative-mimetic techne, mediations of what it  is possible to know on narrative’s terms. Neither stands in a closer rela- tionship than the other to nature, the real, or whatever else one might  wish to call the culturally unmediated. In the remainder of the present  account I consider in situ modes of interplay between these two forms  of narrative experience, drawing on a number of textual examples. Varieties of Narrative Experience, Tropes of Narrativity,  and the Role of Metanarrative Awareness Experiences of narratives as things produced or received are established  for us through the processes of storymaking, maneuvers that draw us  a little apart from the other practical concerns of living. Storymaking  inescapably occurs or is encountered as one object in the world among  others: stories are projected in packets of speech, written texts, sequenc- es of images, performed actions, and the like. “Storied” objects necessar- ily possess temporal-spatial boundaries; moreover, internal registration  of this boundedness helps to defi ne them generically. Here the obvious  contrast is with performances that are classifi ed as lyrical. Lyrics clearly  have beginnings, may have a predetermined quantitative organization  (as in the instance of the Petrarchan sonnet), and may exhibit high levels  of self-referentiality. But they are not pervaded by acknowledgment of a  given beginning and inferable end, yielding in its turn the possibility of  “middling,” which structures presentation and response to the thing pre- sented over a span of time. The refrain of Spenser’s Prothalamion, “Sweet  Thames, run softly till I end my song,” might be seen as being charac- teristic of lyric utterance in that it refers to the necessity of the perfor- mance’s having an ending without explaining how this might come  about, and while emphasizing its present deferment. Narrative experi- ence, on the other hand, accrues in the encounter with a given object,  across time, where this object is understood to possess fi xed boundar- ies, and where the boundedness implies that the way toward compre- hension must lie through some discernment of relationship among the  object’s component elements. I would suggest that this founding situa- tion yields the template for narrative as contract, implying a set of rec- ognizable procedures for investing form with signifi cance. Life as such,  Davis: Rethinking Narrativity 13 </page> <page sequence="14"> as Michael Bell (1990) observes, “has no contract” (175). By contrast, the  acknowledged boundedness of narrative as performance-object leads to  the defi nition of an other domain, a “world,” which can be conceived as  existing in space and time, whose constituent elements can be expected  to possess a signifi cant correlation with one another. Narrative is naturalized (in Culler’s sense of the term) insofar as dis- cursive performance and reception in any given setting is naturalized— that is, produced in some degree of conformity to prevalent cultural  beliefs, expectations, and constructions of knowledge. The nature re- cuperated here may be that given to experience considered as unitary;  the performance thus becomes a thing offered up to be understood as  a whole, where such imputedly holistic understanding stands as the  means by which another whole thing is to be known; call this Expe- rience (i). Or, the nature recuperated may be that of experience con- sidered as fragmentary, unstable, perforated, syncopated, or otherwise  resistant to uniform conceptualization; call this Experience (ii). A fl ow  of information that has been organized as narrative simultaneously en- gages both of these “natural” polarities of experience. Narrative Experi- ence (i) as received is entirely mimetic in character: attending to narra- tive performance in this aspect evokes the phenomenal experience of  inhabiting or observing a spatial-temporal world that is incrementally  known. Narrative Experience (ii) on the other hand is both mimetic  and, inescapably, metatextual: it evokes the phenomenal experience of  inhabiting a spatial-temporal world that is not available to knowledge  on wholly consistent terms; and it acknowledges the spatiality, bound- edness, and fabrication of narrative performance, the fact that it is an  object encountered in the world and at the same time an artifact that  offers to construct knowledge under the conditions that it specifi cal- ly produces. Experience (ii) holds open the virtual space of narrative,  and so makes Experience (i) available to those who are caught up in a  particular narrative performance; but the thorough accessing of Expe- rience (i) also involves a defl ection of attention from Experience (ii),  which confi rms Experience (ii) in its character of disruption. I focus on discursive formations that yield Experience (ii). As Da- vid Herman (2002) observes, a good deal of recent research has drawn  attention to the deictic shift that occurs in narrative: “storytelling in- 14 storyworlds volume 4 2012 </page> <page sequence="15"> volves a shift of deictic centers, whereby narrators prompt their inter- locutors to relocate from the HERE and NOW of the act of narration to  other space-time coordinates—namely, those defi ning the perspective  from which the events of the story are recounted” (271). From infancy  we learn how to make transitions from living as such to a kind of vi- carious or virtual living, as we do whenever we gain access to the world  of a narrative and temporarily withdraw some interest from the world  of the here and now, entering a different terrain and allowing the fi g- ures of the story, the narrative agents, to take over for the time being the  business of thinking, feeling, and doing, as it were on our behalf. The  transferring of attention to another world is, as Herman notes, obvious  in the case of fi ctional narratives, whose “worlds” may possess highly  individual and non-familiar-world-like characteristics; but any narra- tive irrespective of genre bids to shift its audience’s framing of knowl- edge away from the given spatial-temporal parameters of performance- audience interaction: “even such minimal narratives [. . .] as John ate;  then he slept require a deictic shift to the world in which the eating and  sleeping occur” (271–72). Deploying a metaphor that captures some of the paradoxicality of  the relationship between Experience (i) and Experience (ii), David Zu- bin and Lynne Hewitt (1995), discussing the phenomenon of the deictic  shift, characterize narrative as “open[ing] a conceptual window through  which the story world can be glimpsed” (131). If a storyworld is only  glimpsed through or by means of a narrative, qua “open[ed] concep- tual window,” does that imply that coming to terms with a narrative’s  framing forms somehow part of our ability to see through it, gazing in  the direction of its world? The paragraph that precedes the present one  has spoken of narrative worlds and the capacity of narratives to afford  us access to them, very much Experience (i) phenomena. “Gain access  to” and “world” here are, however, loaded ways of speaking, and per- haps misleading ones. Story seems to promise access to an “inside” of  itself, an “other” space into which we can proceed, leaving our ordinary  surroundings behind. At issue here is what might be termed the Narnia  effect: the promise of narrative commonly looks like that of a C. S. Lew- is wardrobe, functioning as a conduit between the world in which the  narrative communication takes place and another one that the narrative  Davis: Rethinking Narrativity 15 </page> <page sequence="16"> itself defi nes. Drama offers visual markers of the difference, establish- ing a demarcation between costumed performers and mere spectators,  or between the performing space and the spectators’ assigned space. As  becomes clear, however, when we examine the actual procedures of sto- rymaking, this other space is never fully or fi nally accessed. Rather, and  as the example of drama suggests, the presenting to thought of such an  other space goes on being performed as part of the disclosure of narra- tive. Recitals of events do not feel like stories unless they take us, recur- rently or continuously, to incidences of Experience (ii), which take the  form of a questioning or readjustment of our seeing, and purport to  offer renewed or better access to that spectacle of another reality that  is story’s lure. Narratives are organized, I am trying to suggest, around  tropes that reinstate the promise of narrative itself. A trope in the root  sense is a turn or turning (Greek tropos). I conclude by identifying, with  a few examples, the sort of thing that a trope of narrativity is. I cannot  give an exhaustive account of this fi eld of inquiry, of course; instead, my  aim is to demonstrate that such a fi eld exists and is worth exploring.11 The problematization of Experience (i) in its putative whole- ness seems to take two broad generic forms. The fi rst (X), metaleptic  in character, involves infraction of the communication world / story- world boundary. The second (Y) disturbs holistic conceptions of self  and world that are characteristic of narrative Experience (i), exploiting  forms of cognitive dissonance. Each has a further subdivision. As Marie-Laure Ryan (2006) points out, “every language-based fi c- tional narrative involves at least two levels: a real-world level, on which  an author communicates with a reader, and a primary fi ctional level, on  which a narrator communicates with a narratee within an imaginary  world” (204). Ryan terms this fundamental differentiation of levels “on- tological” (205): in principle, the disjoined worlds exist for us as entirely  different entities. The metaleptic narrative tropes, however, violate this  disjunction by recalling the author’s and reader’s simultaneous habita- tion / virtual habitation of both worlds. (X.1) Metaleptic tropes of the fi rst general sort, which may be termed  tropes of transition, produce boundaries that evoke and resemble the  communication world / storyworld boundary within the diegetic space- time of a narrative. Among these it is possible to distinguish three pre- 16 storyworlds volume 4 2012 </page> <page sequence="17"> dominant varieties. (X.1.a) The fi rst kind of trope of transition involves  the marking out of a threshold, in crossing which the narrative agent  moves from one kind of space of possibility into another. In highly ex- plicit cases, like that of the Narnia wardrobe, this transition takes the  form of a portal leading from one posited narrative reality to another.  But in less explicit cases features of more or less realistically conceived  landscapes or geographies can function as narrative thresholds; one  thinks, for example, of the characteristically frequent shifts of terrain  in picaresque narrative. A narrative threshold can, of course, be defi ned  morally or spiritually or psychologically, without reference to properties  of a story’s virtual topography—though again, transitions of the kind  are quite often signaled by reference to topography. (X.1.b) The second genre of tropings that involve transitions is con- cerned with gifts and exchanges. We are speaking of the new, chance  acquisition that empowers; or the that which is given up for this, maybe  better or at least different. I take it that the underlying model for giving/ receiving/exchanging within the world of the narrative is a version of  the same happening in the narrative encounter itself—a giving/receiv- ing and an exchanging of one construction of reality for another. Gifts  and exchanges are familiar enough in romance and fairy tale. But un- der this heading it is also worth considering realist narratives like Meri- mée’s novella Carmen. This text, whether seen from the standpoint of  its lightly involved frame narrator or else from that of its main narrator  and central fi gure, turns on a series of highly semioticized exchanges or  transactions (whose materials are cigars, food, opportunities to escape  the law, a fl ower, sex, a story . . .). (X.1.c) A third troping of transition produces the effect of anamor- phosis and necessitates a reorganization of perception: what has looked  ordinary or natural from one standpoint abruptly ceases to look like  that from the other one that now becomes available; or, conversely,  what has looked weird or distorted can in a decisive act of re-perception  become beautiful or perfect or irresistibly compelling. Again, Merimée’s  tale offers a revealing example in the representation of Carmen as the  suddenly discovered object of irresistible desire; prior to this discovery  the narrator of the experience has seen her as being alien, repugnant,  even ugly. Traversals of thresholds, transformative gifts and exchanges,  Davis: Rethinking Narrativity 17 </page> <page sequence="18"> anamorphic shifts of vision—all these tropes of transition occur com- monly in narratives, including ones that we consider to be strongly  vraisemblable. (X.2) The second broad category of metaleptic tropes involves forms  of cognitive mapping, which provide means for understanding the  shape of the narrative that is being received, whether in its present un- folding or its entirety, and so of navigating one’s way through the story.  The vantage point that these tropes supply is one associated with the  act of narration, as distinct from a virtual witnessing of story events  in their immediacy. Lucien Dällenbach’s study of mise en abyme (1989)  stresses the capacity of such internal narrative self-refl ection to produce  effects of simplifi cation and paradox. It can be disruptive in that it tells  us things that—within the framework of what I am terming narrative  Experience (i)—we should not be in a position to know, since it provides  a real-world view of the complete story as object. But it can also clarify  narrative design and simplify the reader’s navigational task. For pres- ent purposes I wish to underline mise en abyme’s familiar production  of discontinuity in narrative’s cognitive processing, its communication  with the what will have happened as well as with the now. The joke that  begins “There was an elephant, a sheep, and an alien” is already holding  up a small image of itself in fi nished form by so decisively identifying  its narrative agents. Narrative mise en abyme often produces complexity  via initial simplifi cation. We assess Apuleius’s The Golden Ass differently  and fi nd ourselves asking new questions as a result of reading the inset  tale of Cupid and Psyche. Internal narrative resemblance can cascade in  the production of differing qualitative assessments of what a narrative  world presents, one of the effects of the mirroring of actions and per- sons that is pervasive in Hamlet. Here the operation of mise en abyme  tends to produce a destabilizing of world, which is noted in another  form below, as I shift to the second broad way in which narrativity can  be fi gured through textual tropes. (Y) Tropes of cognitive dissonance interfere with holistic concep- tions of the accessed world that are the substance of narrative Experi- ence (i). This second broad category of tropes can be divided into two  families. In the fi rst, the means offered for the decoding of narrative in- formation as world is, from the standpoint of the reader working to re- 18 storyworlds volume 4 2012 </page> <page sequence="19"> construct that world, manifestly skewed, limited, and partial. In the sec- ond, the proffered means of decoding are manifestly inconsistent. (Y.1) I assume, with Culler and others, that readers’ default tendency  is to decode a narrative statement by applying the principle of vraisem- blance: the software that we bring, as a result of nature and nurture, to  the conceptualization of lived experience is also the starter software that  we bring to the understanding of story data. But given that we learn to  make sense of stories partly by gaining acquaintance with the storied,  as distinct from the merely lived, storymaking can enhance the story- likeness of its own contents, with the result that these contents are seen  as it were in different colors than those of ordinary experience: the cog- nition that is appropriate to them operates in friction against the cog- nition that retains its appropriateness to ordinary experience. A sim- ple instance is offered by narratives that explore more or less fantastic  worlds that are stably conceived—for example, the Italian sword-and- sandal fi lms of the late 1950s that intercalate natural and supernatural  forms of causation in completely explicated fashion. More complex in- stances are provided by narratives that offer the spectacle of the hyper- knowable. Sometimes a narrative text and its genre support removal of  knowledge’s temporal delay, the delay usually needed in life if we are to  gain necessary understanding of a person or situation with whom or  which we happen to be involved. Thus the heterocosm set up by clas- sical Greek pastoral writing smacks of an already established familiar- ity: what obtains is what our most immediate and unmodifi ed desires  or wishes, culturally instated as “natural,” reveal as being the case—for  example, the pleasures and pains of love, and the solaces of friendship  and art. Pastoral fi ctions are often given no backstory, and generically  require none. More generally, narrative invention is frequently found to be orga- nized in this way around generically hyperfamiliar narrative agents or  situations. No one has ever met a pastoral shepherd, but we know them  well as narrative creatures. Much the same can be said of talking ani- mals or friendly robots, knowledge of which is even more clearly pro- jective—simply put, the scenarios in which they participate offer ex- periences of felt certainty that life as such doesn’t offer, and dispense  aerosol puffs of optimism concerning the knowability of the world. Or,  Davis: Rethinking Narrativity 19 </page> <page sequence="20"> more disconcertingly, the heterocosms set up by the short narratives  of Borges are informationally self-suffi cient in a way that lived expe- rience cannot usually be. Though often joined on to culturally famil- iar schemes of history and geography, they are also closed off from the  larger world in that they provide in its entirety the highly specifi c, often  esoteric, information—genuine or cleverly forged—that is needed to  understand their workings. (Y.2) Other forms of narrative troping destabilize or positively dis- rupt certainties concerning the world that narratives typically pro- vide. Anagnorisis in Aristotle’s description of it has been seen to work  in this fashion. Or we meet narratives projecting layered or gnostically  conceived worlds, where the norms of the storyworld’s formation—ex- tending potentially to its theology and physics—are subject to slippage,  and where constructions of a narrative real are threatened by abysses  of counterpossibility. Examples are the fi ctions of Philip K. Dick and  Philip Pullman, the Matrix fi lms, or, as offered to young children in the  1990s, The Teletubbies, where the central partly humanoid fi gures have  TV screens in their stomachs looking on to scenes of ordinary life, a  strange thing in this dislocated setting. Hoffman, Poe, and others have  also provided us with chaotic narrative heterocosms where identities  slide between narrative agents in a way that simultaneously engages and  disables the will to know. Likewise, story creatures such as talking animals and pastoral shep- herds have their strongly disruptive, uncanny counterparts in a-human  narrative agents that are human-resemblant, inserted into narrative  worlds that otherwise possess a fair measure of vraisemblance. Famil- iar examples are zombies, golems, werewolves, androids that pass the  Turing test, human-replicant pods, fi sh-men, and vampires. These crea- tures are knowable, in the sense that stories and story traditions tell us  what they are and do, but their presence in narrative has the effect of  throwing into turmoil normative conceptions of nature and humanity.  The novelist Jeanette Winterson has spoken in a radio interview of her  interest in introducing “rogue elements” into her fi ctions, a helpfully  suggestive phrase in the present context. I take it to mean an agent, ob- ject, situation, or narrative practice that is conventionally inappropri- ate to or otherwise out of place in its circumambient narrative world  20 storyworlds volume 4 2012 </page> <page sequence="21"> and given regime of narration; or, more radically, a narrative entity so  anomalous in itself (see the fi gure-ground morphing images of M. C.  Escher) as to resist uniform conceptualization. An example of this last  is the unspeakable Father in Kafka’s story “The Judgement,” feeble and  childlike, terrifying and commanding. The son who is the story’s focal- ized fi gure here gives up, as it were, on trying to bring these intolerable  contradictions to a conceptual resolution, but dies instead. Or we might  place in the same category some of the narrative agents in Kleist’s sto- ries for whom or in whom discrepant, irreconcilable constructions of  identity are found to coincide. In this concluding section, I have attempted to characterize narrativ- ity by providing a summary account of narrative troping whose general  form is the infraction/reinforcement of narrative Experience (i) by nar- rative Experience (ii). Here a central claim is that metanarrative aware- ness, or registration of a story’s characteristics as artifact, pervades stor- ymaking as such and not just explicitly self-referential storymaking, and  that it is made manifest in several discursive forms. But the satisfactions  of taxonomy can be short-lived, and what has been said about tropes  of narrativity has to be considered suspect if it does not correspond to  fundamental intuitions about story. The correspondence can be tested,  I would suggest, by further study of the perceived differences between  story and neighboring forms of discourse, especially lyric discourse, de- scription, chronicle as recital of events, and commentary on live occur- rence. It is also worth reconsidering those forms of storytelling and sto- ried play, often complex or prima facie strange, by which human infants  are practically initiated into the reception and production of narrative. Notes 1.  See for example the overview of recent developments provided by Shen (2005). 2.  Compare Fludernik’s (1996) statement that “any mythic or originary concepts  of naturalness will here be repudiated” (15). 3.  As an assessment of normative Western attitudes to the dichotomy that brings  out some of their internal tensions, consider placing the following in order  of ascending naturalness: a memory, a boat, an aeroplane, organic farming, a  sporting event, a trained ape, democracy. 4.  In this connection it is also helpful to consider Alasdair MacIntyre’s account  Davis: Rethinking Narrativity 21 </page> <page sequence="22"> of moral action, understood from the agent’s standpoint, as enacted narrative  and Charles Taylor’s contention that experiencing life as an unfolding story is  a requisite for establishing a sense of identity. Bell (1990) comments, however,  on a problem that inheres in MacIntyre’s use of the idea of narrative, which  is representative in this respect of all “pan-narrativist” thinking. As Bell notes,  there is justifi cation in discussing moral life by reference to narrative models;  but “the need for this metaphor to be so deep and subliminal as not to appear  metaphorical at all leaves it with a slippery and potentially misleading value  when extrapolated from its context. The essential problem here is that narrative  has to be a different kind of thing from lived temporality, or there is no point  in drawing any analogy between them. The meaningfulness of the compari- son depends on an implicit recognition of this difference even while it is being  overlooked” (174). In a well-known essay Galen Strawson (2004) argues, fur- thermore, that possessing the view of one’s life as a narrative is not necessarily  a psychological given and should probably not be set up as an ethical desidera- tum. It is also worth considering the psychological phenomenon of confabula- tion, which is the subject’s spontaneous production of unknowingly false ac- counts of his or her own behavior, apparently in order to preserve appearances  of autonomy and continuity in conscious functioning; see Hirstein (2005). 5.  See Davis (1999), which examines elaborated narrative critiques of low-level  narrative certainties—in particular, the ones that have a formative and confi r- matory relationship to the dominant culture through their bearing on concep- tions of reason and gender difference. 6.  Compare Fludernik’s (1996) emphatic statement that “mimesis must NOT be  identifi ed as imitation but needs to be treated as the artifi cial and illusionary  projection of a semiotic structure which the reader recuperates in terms of a  fi ctional reality” (35). 7.  Aristotle postulates that mimesis is doubly natural: young human beings, un- like other animals, instinctively engage in it, and “everyone enjoys mimetic  objects” (chap. 4; 37). 8.  There are further similarities, as Francis Wolff points out (2007: 55–56). But for  present purposes it is suffi cient to stress the end-directedness that, in Aristotle’s  conception, natural and technical processes entirely share. 9.  Aristotle was not, of course, a biological evolutionist in the modern sense. The  burden of the statement is that Aeschylus and Sophocles gave the artifi cial spe- cies tragedy its defi nitive shape, bringing it to generic perfection. 10.  This is a preoccupation of Aristotle’s biological texts, especially De Partibus  Animalium. 11.
