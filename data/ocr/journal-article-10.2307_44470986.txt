ABSTRACT Facial impact experiments were conducted on eleven unembalmed human cadavers. A 32 kg or 64 kg impactor with a 25 mm diameter, rigid, cylindrical contact surface was oriented in the left-right direction relative to the face and contacted the nose at the elevation of the in- fraorbital margins. The impactor was propelled toward the face along an anter i or-to-poster i or path, with contact velocities ranging from 10 to 26 km/h. Accel erometers mounted on the impactor and the occiput provided data for analyzing the dynamics of the impacts. While the threshold for nasal bone fractures was not determined, it ap- pears that a peak force of about 3 kN (filtered 180 Hz) is a representative threshold for more severe fracture patterns. A preliminary dynamic force vs penetration response specification for the above mode of loading is offered. Analyses of the acceleration data suggest that current typical dummy heads (vinyl flesh over aluminum skull) will not provide proper acceleration data in facial impact environments; the face is too stiff. WAYNE STATE UNIVERSITY, under contract with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, is engaged in a study of the mechanical response and injury tolerance char ac ter i st i es of three body regions of human cadaver subjects under various dynamic loading conditions.* The regions of study are the face, abdomen and lower leg. This Paper provides an interim summary of the re- search associated with the facial impacts; a com- panion Paper by Cavanaugh et al.

Nyquist et al. (2) have previously reported on the lower leg study. Since this Paper deals with a topic where little information is available in the literature, discussions judged to be unneces- sary for an understanding of the data are brief, thereby enabling detailed test data to be presented within the available space. Facial impacts to vehicle interior com- ponents has long been (and continues to be) a relatively' common occurrence. A familiar scenario is facial bone fractures as a con- sequence of impact to the steering wheel by an unrestrained or lap-shoulder belted driver. While significant discomfort and temporary dis- ability is experienced, the norm is that full recovery is enjoyed when the impact severity is below levels resulting in brain injury. While admittedly not a pleasant thought, the facial structure can serve as a shock absorber for blows to the front of the head. Crushing of the facial bones attenuates the accelerations experienced by the brain. Consequently, the fracture tolerance and dynamic mechanical response character i st i es of the face are topics of interest. Surrogates of the human face, whether mathematical or mechanical, are of limited use- fulness without associated tolerance and response data. A realistic contact force during a facial impact will occur only if the dynamic force- penetration behavior of the face at the loading site is humanlike. Furthermore, given that realistic forces are generated, the injury con- sequences of a blow can be assessed only if fa- cial fracture tolerance data are available. All human surrogates commonly used in impact testing, with the exception of the cadaver, have had profound shortcomings in this regard. The norm is that the face will not fracture (and is there- fore too stiff) and that recognized fracture tolerance loads are unavailable for a particular type of impact. An ob vi ou s and i mp or tant example i s facial impact to any modern anthropomorphic test dummy. The face is an aluminum casting covered by a vinyl flesh and skin simulation. 5.850 0096-736X/87/9505-0850$02.50 Copyright 1987 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.</page><page sequence="2">861896 Severe blows to the -face will result in unrealis- tically high head accelerations. Vet, -facial im- pacts are common in vehicle crash tests using dummy occupants. There have been limited studies o-f facial bone fracture tolerance and response; more of the former than the latter. For example, Hodgson et al. (3) delivered hammer-like blows to the supra- orbital ridge, the zygoma and the zygomatic arch of embalmed cadavers of the elderly. Similarly, Nahum et al. (4) used a drop weight striker device to study the fracture tolerance of the frontal bone, the zygoma and mandible of embalmed and unembalmed subjects. There have also been some limited efforts toward the development of better facial simulations for an t hr opcmor ph i c dummies. M c L e o d and Gado' ( 5 ) developed a f r a n - gible skull and face with a simulated flesh covering. Warner and Niven (6) produced a prototype load-sensing faceform. Finally, Tar- riere et al. il) have reported on a modification of a dummy head that incorporates a crushable, light alloy honeycomb insert to represent the fa- cial skeleton. Each of these facial concepts is based on minimal bi omechani cal data. and to date nono are commerci al 1 y available or in widespread use. More basic biomechanical data are needed; hence this study. TESTING PROTOCOL Thus far in the study, facial impacts have been performed in a manner analogous to (but not identical with) loading by a steering wheel rim. The testing protocol resembled that previously described for tibia testing (2) and utilized in the companion paper (1) covering abdominal im- pacts, in that the so-called Wayne State Trarsla- tional Impactcr was utilized to deliver tne im- pacts. This facility featured a 32* or ¿4 kg (including i nstr ument at i on ) rigid impactcr that slid horizontally on nylon bearings and was propelled by a 152 mm stroke pneumatic cylinder. Speed was measured during a brief coasting phase immediately prior to impact. A 25 mm diameter aluminum bar on the end of the impacto r, orien- tated with its longitudinal axis parallel te a left-right axis on the head, contacted the face. The bar was longer than the width of the face. The test subject was positioned in an upright seated posture in front of the impactcr with the head held by weak tape tethers such that the Frankfort plane was horizontal. Furthermore, the seat height was adjusted to align the palpated infraorbital margins (i.e. bottom of eye sockets) to the same elevation as the axis of the aluminum bar (Fig.l). Under these conditions the head es- sentially translated rearward (with minimal rotati on) during the portion of the event of in- terest . The instrumentation utilized in these tests included the following: - Uniaxial accel er omet er on impactor, aligned parallel to path of travel. * Except for the first test, that was 31 kg. - Uniaxial accelerometer on occiput (i.e. back of head) of cadaver, aligned parallel to the anterop es- ter i or di recti on . - Magnetic pick-up for speed determina- tion. - H i g h - s p e e d 1 6 in m camera.

The accel er ometer s were Endevco ® Mccei 7264- 200. The analog data were prsfiltered at 1000 Hz, digitized at a sampling rate of 2000 Hz and further analyzed using the University's computer and plotting facilities. Filters fit the centers of SAE channel class corridors. Phototargets were attached midsagi tal 1 y at the occipital ac- celerometer and on the impactor. Figure 1 . Impactor Aligned with F a c e TEST SUBJECTS Data are presented for one test on each of eleven cadavers. The subjects were obtained through the University medical college shortly after death and were unembalmed. Table 1 provides a summary of their characteristics. There were four feifiales, with ages ranging from 43 to 57 years and body mass ranging from 53 to 75 kg. The seven males ranged from 43 to 66 years and 45 to 92 kg. The subjects were clothed in disposable coveralls and had a thin knit cot- ton cloth covering the face during the test. The injuries sustained as a result of the impact were diagnosed during dissection at autopsy by a suitably experienced pathologist.

Figures Al through All of the Appen- dix provide filtered and unfiltered time his- tories of the impactor and occipital accelera- tions. Furthermore, Figures A12 and A13 provide plots of impactor penetration into the face as a function of time, based on analyses of the high- speed films and/or double integration of the ac- cel erometer signals. Penetration is defined as the relative displacement of the aluminum cylinder into the face following initial contact (with the nose) . DISCUSSION OF RESULTS An initial observation from Table 2 is that nasal bone fractures were sustained in every test. This is not surprising, since the impactor alignment utilized in this study results in ini- tial contact at the nose. Referring to Table 2, for fracture limited to the nasal bones, the min- imum speed at contact was 10.0 km/h (Test Nos. 44, 46 and 48); the minimum kinetic energy of the impactor was 241 J (Test No. 13).

Or. the ether hand, with the exception of Test No. 56, the impactor energy associated with tests resulting in more extensive fractures was con- siderably larger than the above value, ranging from Ó46 to 815 J. Interestingly, the energy as- sociated with Test No. 58 was 242 J, which is es- sentially equal to that of Test No. 13 (which had the lowest kinetic energy experienced in the series of tests). No explanation is available for the unexpected results of Test No. 58. Figure 2 provides a plot of impactor penetration versus impactor speed. The darkened data points represent tests where fractures were not limited to the nasal bones. There is a clustering of darkened points at the upper right (represent i ng high speed, high penetration impacts). Figure 3 provides a similar plot, ex- cept that the abscissa is impactor kinetic energy instead of speed. Since impactor mass is ac- counted for in the kinetic energy computation, there are no longer separate sets of points for the iwo impactor masses. The separation of the poiuls for the two levels of fracture severity is e v e ii mor e obvious here, The large variability of peak penetrations in Figures 2 and 3 and the fact that nasal bone-only fractures and the more ex- tensive fractures o c cur red at similar penetra- tions is suggestive that peak penetration is not a meaningful measure of impact severity. This is postulated to be a result of variability in fa- cial anthropometry among test subjects. While peak penetration for an individual subject un- doubtedly would increase with increasing impactor speed and kinetic energy, this trend probably be- comes obscure in a data set comprised of single impacts to multiple subjects. A subject with relatively less prominent nasal bones and/cr that is well endowed with nasal cartilage and soft tissue should sustain larger peak penetrations at a given level of applied force (or given severity of fracture) than could be tolerated by a subject with more prominent nasal bones and/or relatively less cartilage and soft tissue. Unfortunately, detailed facial anthropometry was not documented for the test subjects in this study. (It is cau- tioned that the above remarks should not be in- terpreted to imply thai peak penetration may not be ar. appropriate measure of impact severity for a standardised test tool such as an anthropomor- phic dummy head.) One is led to conclude that impactor kinetic energy should correlate with fracture severity better than does peak penetra- tion. The energy increases with increasing im- pactor mass and impactor speed. Clearly, in- creases in the magnitudes of either of these in- dividual parameters logically equates to the ap- plication of higher loads on the facial bones. Energy may not correlate with injury for limiting cases of very high speed and small mass or very large mass and small speed; however, such impacts fall outside of the realm of interest in this study. A summary of the impactor peak deceleration magnitudes and related information is provided in Table 3.

Impactor Penetration Versus Energy profiles included in the Appendix and the deceleration rise times (zero to peak value) were scaled from the haversi ne-1 i ke 180 Hz filtered 5.854</page><page sequence="6">861896 traces. Noise problems associated with the 1000 Hz data limit its use-fulness. (This is further discussed later in the Paper.) Consequently, the 180 Hz filtered data were relied upon for charac- terizing the overall nature of the impacts. The peak applied forces provided in Table 3 were com- puted using the known impactor mass and peak deceleration together with Newton's law. Larger peak forces clearly would result if the 1000 Hz data were used; however the physical meaning of the numbers would be questionable. The peak values based on filtered data are judged to be représentât i ve of results that would be achieved had noise-free traces been fi.lt er ed. While the ensuing discussion of the biomechanics of the fracture process relies on details that are evi- dent only as a result of analyzing the 1000 Hz occipital acceleration profiles, with the excep- tion of Test No. 13 the more heavily filtered signals are nevertheless believed to provide meaninqful response data for use in establishing dynamic force-deflection specifica ci on s for a surrogate face. (Duplication of typical high- frequency responses in a surrogate face is prob- ab 1 y i mpr act i cal . ) The rise time and peak applied force data of Table 3 may be thought of as the half-period and amplitude of haver si ne-i i ke force versus time profiles, respectively, for ISO Hz filtered sig- nals. The peak force for Test No. 13 seems pathol ogi cal 1 y large compared to that of the other tests, and should not be relied upon. This test was performed early in the study, during a peri od when impact or erratic vibrational problems were experienced. The dramatic effect of filter- ing for Test No. 13, compared to all other tests, is evident in Table 3. Exclusive of Test No. 13, the mean value of peak force (Table 3) for tests with fractures limited to the nasal bones was 2,77 kN and the mean for tests with more exten- sive fractures was 3.07 kN. While it is logical that the latter mean force be higher than the former, it. is important to keep dose-response principles in mind. Since only four of the ten subjects (Test 13 omitted) sustained more exten- sive fractures than the remaining six subjects with only nasal bone fractures, and since the peak force for all ten tests ranged fs'-om 2.01 to 3.89 kN, the above mean value of 3.07 kN should be a fairly representative measure of the threshold for the more extensive fractures. To the contrary, the above mean value of 2.77 kN for nasal bone-only fractures is an upper bound, not a threshold, since none of the tests were of suf- ficiently low severity to avoid this injury. (There is no reason to believe that this upper bound is the so-called least upper bound.) The cadaver head occipital acceleration data have proved to be useful in understanding some of the details of the facial responses during the impacts. It appears that the 1000 Hz data are necessary for studying this detail. The signal-to-noise concerns associated with the 1000 Hz filtered impactor deceleration data are, relatively speaking, absent from the occipital acceleration signals. This is because the head is initially at rest, totally uncoupled from the impactor. Once the impactor contacts the face, it is conceivable that some of the noise is in- troduced into the occipital accel er ometer signal through the head during the course of the impact.

The noise, however, tends to he of high frequency; consequently one might expect it to be attenuated measurably by the time it reaches the occiput, considering the nature of the impactor engagement with the face and the inherent damping characteristics of the head. A careful look at the 1000 Hz filtered oc- cipital acceleration traces in the Appendix reveals a strong trend dur i ng approximately the first 4.5 ms. There is an initial acceleration peak. (Each of these initial peaks is identified by an arrow on the trace.) The data of Table 4 were scaled from the trace and provide a summary of the nature of the initial peaks as well as the subsequent maximum amplitude later in time. It is often possible to distinguish some form of perturbation in the impactor acceleration trace that appears to correlate with the initial o c - 5.855</page><page sequence="7">c i p i t a 1 peak; however, the noise associated with the Í000 Hz impactor accel er a t i ons obscures any strong trends. The early occipital acceleration peaks are postulated to be the result of nasal bone fracture. It is reasonable to expect a momentary drop in the force level applied to the head as the nasal bones fail. This momentary load loss would cause a concomitant occipital ac- celeration peak, immediately followed by an again increasing trace as the impactor continued to bear down the on face.

The above postulated explanation for the early peaks is corroborated by the impactor penetration versus time plots of Figures A12 and A13. There are break-points early in these plots where the slope decreases. Since the slope rep- resents rate of penetration, it stands to reason that the slope will decrease rather suddenly when the impactor has penetrated through (or compressed) the soft tissue and cartilage and begins bearing down on the nasal bones. The break-points in the penetration plots tend to oc- cur slightly later in time than the acceleration peaks; however, since displacement is the double integral of acceleration, it takes time for ob- servable penetration phenomena to occur. Fur- thermore, the resolution associated with deter- mining penetrations from high-speed films was marginal for such detailsā Table 4 indicates that the norm is for the initial occipital acceleration peak to be of les- ser magnitude than the subsequent maximum; however, this was not the case for Test Nos. 15, 34 and 44. Dne can question what is different about these three tests compared to the others. First, it should be noted that Test Nos. 15 and 34 had the highest two impactor speeds and the largest two facial penetrations. Furthermore, the fracture patterns associated with these two 32 kg impactor tests were more extensive than in the remaining 32 kg tests. High loads appear to have been sustained during nasal bone fracture, followed by large additional penetration of the impactor into the face and a relatively extensive fracture pattern with concomitant lesser ac- celeration peak as a result of the larger dis- tance involved. The quantity of data is insuffi- cient at this point in the study to conclude that this behavior is, in fact, caused by the higher impactor speeds (i.e. that the nasal bone frac- ture tolerance increases dramatically with rate of loading). In fact, Test No. 44 (with 64 kg impactor) had a relatively low speed and one of the smallest peak penetrations, yet exhibited the same phenomenon. (It should be noted that the tabulated occipital accel er at i ons , for unexplained reasons, seem small for Test No. 44 compared to those of similar tests.) Referring to the kinetic energies in Table 2 leads one to conclude that Test No. 44 also was not similar to Test Nos. 15 and 34 with regard to this parameter. Furthermore, based on the cadaver character i st i es of Table 1, the subject for Test No. 44 is not an outlier compared to the other two subjects. Details of facial anthropometry, however, could be remarkably different. An analysis of the pairs of peak impactor deceleration and head acceleration was performed that led to a conclusion regarding the need for a more realistic facial structure on anthropomor- phic dummies. Table 5 provides a summary of the ratio of these peaks (occipital divided by impactor). The ratios are tabulated for data filtered at both 1000 Hz and 180 Hz. Under rigid body dynamics (ignoring noise problems and assum- ing the cadaver neck does not apply significant loads in this time frame) the above ratio of ac- celerations should be numerically equal to the ratio of the impactor mass divided by the head mass. While the actual head masses are unknown, a well known statistical approximation is that the head mass is 6.1 percent Df the total body mass for adults (8). This criterion was used along with information from Tables 1 and 2 to compute the entries in the fourth column of Table 5. The remaining two columns of the Table express percent differences in this ratio, com- puted as stated in the footnote below the table, for the two levels of filtering of accel erati ons. Note that {hese differences are predomi nant 1 y of negat-ive sign, ranging from -79 to +21 percent for the 1000 Hz data and from -80 to +18 for the 180 Hz data, with averages of -29 and -40 respec- tively. The nature of the calculations is such 5.856</page><page sequence="8">861896 Table 5 Acceleration Ratios Compared to Predictions Based on Rigid Body Mechanics Ratio of Peak Accelerations Ratio of Masses * Difference of Test (Dcc i pi tal / Impactor ) Impaqtor Ratios (Percent) ** No. Filtered Filtered Head Filtered Filtered 1000 Hz 180 Hz 1000 Hz 180 Hz 13 2.4 3.7 6.4 --63 -42 15 6.0 5. 1 7.7 -22 -34 20 - 2.0 9.9 - -80 25 - 5.9 11.7 - -50 29 8.5 6.6 7.0 +21 -6 34 6.0 3.8 7.7 -22 -51 42 10.1 11.4 19ģl -47 -40 44 3.1 3.2 15.0 -79 -79 46 13.6 13.4 11.4 +19 +18 48 9.5 11.8 17.2 -45 -31 58 4.6 3.0 5.7 -19 -47 Average: -29 -40 * Head mass estimated as 6.1 percent of body mass (8). ** 100 (Accel, ratio minus mass ratio)/(Mass ratio). that a negative sign implies an occipital ac- celeration magnitude that is smaller than would be present under rigid body conditions. Fractur- ing of the face and damped elastic deformation of the skull are logical explanations to account for this phenomenon. To the contrary, displacements of soft tissues relative to the skull (both in- side and outside of the skull) during impact would logically lead to a lower effective head mass. This would cause a larger occipital ac- celeration than would be present for a rigid body, and hence a positive error. The prepon- derance of negative signs in this analysis sug- gests that the combined effect of the two phenomena is dominated by the face fracturing and skull damped elastic deformation. Current typi- cal an thropomorphi c dummy heads, composed of a vinyl flesh over a cast aluminum skull, in this impact environment would undoubtedly mimic rigid body behavior much more closely than has been ob- served for the cadavers in this study. That is, the occipital acceleration magnitudes would be too large. Assuming that facial crush is a more important factor than skull deformation, it fol- lows that acceleration magnitudes measured at the center of gravity of the dummy head would also be too large. The need for some type of deformadle facial structure on dummies is thus demonstrated . While the data already discussed provide a basis for defining performance requirements for a surrogate face, dynamic force vs penetration plots would be helpful. An effort has been made to crossplot force vs time and penetration vs time data to provide the desired results. (The force data used in this analysis were filtered at 100 Hz.) The analysis has been complicated by the impactor deceleration noise problem, time synchroni zati on problems between data sets and the limited precision of the penetration data from the high-speed films. (Double integration of acce! erat i ons proved unreliable). The results of these analyses are depicted in Figure 4. While there is considerable variability among the plots, there is a clear trend toward the typical concave-up f orce-def 1 ect i on behavior commonly ob- served for biological materials. Figure 4 in- cludes three candidate curves that tend to be representati ve of the average response.

Considering the paucity of data and concerns with the precision of the crossplots, Equation (2) should be considered the best descriptor of facial response only in a prelimi- nary sense. Further information is needed. CONCLUSIONS Based on the data and analyses provided above, the following conclusions are offered: 1. The nasal bones appear to fracture rela- tively easily, but dramatically larger forces can be sustained with only limited fracture patterns involving one or more of the maxilla, zygoma, sphenoid and frontal bones in proximity of the orbits. 2. Impactor kinetic energy tends to be predict- ive of fracture pattern severity among subjects; impactor peak penetration into the face is not. A force of about 3 kN appears to be a r epr esent at i ve threshold for frac- ture patterns more extensive than nasal bones-only. 5.858</page><page sequence="10">861896 3. The study provides evidence that there is a need for an thropomor ph i c dummies to have some -form of deformable face if head ac- celerations are to be realistic during fa- cial impacts. 4. The dynamic f or ce- pénétrât i on response of the face in this impact environment is character i zed by a concave-up shape. A preliminary best estimate of a single dynamic response characterizing the data is provi ded by Eg . (2) . 5. Data collection needs for facial impact ex- periments of this nature include relatively noise-free acceleration signals at SAE Chan- nel Class 1000 and high-speed films exposed at at least 1000 frames per second. 6. Additional data collected using essentially these same impact conditions are needed to fully understand the facial response and fracture tolerance for this mode of loading. 7. Details of the facial anthr opomet r y should be documented in all future work, in an ef- fort to understand variability in the data. Cadaver head mass should be measured at autopsy.
