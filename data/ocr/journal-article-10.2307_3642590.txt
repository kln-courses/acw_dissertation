<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE SULTANTEPE TABLETS (continued) IX. THE BIRDCALL TEXT By W. G. LAMBERT THIS TEXT IS one of a number of first millennium compilations that reflect a certain philosophical and religious outlook of those times. The compilers sought to find evidence of current theology in the physical universe, which, viewed dispassionately, had only little relevant to show. Whereas " primitive " man had observed the forces of nature and had worshipped them with anthropomorphic attributes, more sophisticated man imagined signs of divine ordering where certainly none exist. This text is based on birdcalls. The sounds were interpreted as Babylonian phrases of mythological content, and the bird in question was thus " the bird of" the deity to whom the phrase applied. Of course one does not know if in fact the connexion of god and bird preceded or followed the interpretation of the call, and the answer need not be the same in every case. The text is known from two substantially different forms. First, the Sultantepe version, STT. 341 (henceforth: S), has every line preserved, but there is some damage which aggravates the textual corruption which occurs in so many tablets from this source. Some of the corruptions can be corrected from a small Ashurbanipal duplicate from Nineveh, K 10823 (CT. 41 5, henceforth: K), which has the beginnings of lines 9-17, and which has been collated for the present edition by permission of the Trustees of the British Museum. The other form of the text is from Assur, KAR. 125 (henceforth: A). About half of the width of the tablet remains, and the first preserved line on the obverse is either the first or second of the tablet. From this point the first portion of every line is preserved until the end, where a few lines only may be missing. It has been collated for this edition by permission of Professor Dr. G. R. Meyer, Director-General of the Staatliche Museen, Berlin, and the new readings obtained are incorporated in the text below. S deals with 15 birds. A deals with 19 on the obverse, of which 11 are shared with S, though those shared are not in the same order and there are substantial textual variations between the two versions. In the transliteration given below the numbers of the parallel lines are given in brackets. Even the individual copies contain textual variants. S Io has both nu.e.x and uis e.a, and in this contest K offers sad-nis" variant ". S I may also have the same sa-nis, but the context is obscure and provisionally it is read sd man(-ma). The reverse of A (line numbers of this tablet not otherwise specified are from the obverse) offers more textual variants. The first five lines are separated from the rest by a ruling, and they may deal with four more birds, but if so the treatment deviates from the fixed pattern on the obverse. The rest is a collection of phrases and sentences which parallel parts of the obverse and the text of S, though they are in the order of neither. One may suspect that they were culled as variants from a third, now lost edition of this text. If this is a correct conclusion, the lines are perhaps the earliest apparatus criticus. In most cases the form of the text is completely intelligible. Each line begins " the x-bird is the bird of Y-deity ", and ends iJtanassi (gh.gh-si) " it constantly calls ". Between these two parts the Babylonized birdcall is given. S often ends the line with " ditto ", which is taken here for i~tanassi. In a number of cases the calls are onomatopoeic. The cock calls tahta.td ana tutu, cock-a-doodle-doo. The duck's call begins qingu qingu, quack quack (is this evidence for the pronunciation of the Akkadian q sound ?). The owl hoots tukku tukku. Some kind of dove (?) calls</page><page sequence="2">I12 ANATOLIAN STUDIES kiki mus~ur. No serious attempt is made here to pursue the many problems of the identification of the birds. In a few cases lines of literary texts are given as the call. The most striking example is the bilingual description of Nabui's symbolic monster (S 9-1 , see the note). It is hard to believe that both Sumerian and Akkadian were taken as the swallow's call. Enilma Elis VII 35 is quoted in S 16. The call in S 4 = A 17 cf. rev. I I may be related to Gilgames X iii 2 and Descent of Ishtar, CT. 15 46 rev. I, but the phrases could be a literary cliche rather than a direct quotation. The call in S 14 may be a literary citation also, though it has not been located. Birds are associated with gods as their symbols elsewhere. Boundary stone symbols include birds, but they offer no help in this connexion (see U. Seidl, Bagh. Mitt. IV 147-I5'). A ritual names the arbdnm2 " the bird of Marduk " in agreement with S I (see the note ad loc.). A tablet of bird omens of lu type, CT. 40 49-50, names the following birds as " of" the named deity: line 27 mu'en ki-is-re-e-ti muven dgu-la 30 (red bird with white on top of head) muven da-nim 31 mu en sa, muen du. gur 36 DI .

It is unknown if the " red " bird of Nergal here is the same as the named birds of Nergal in A 7-8, or if the DIS. BU here could be the same as the aribadnd or surdfi in S I and 16. Another group of birds attached to particular deities occurs in the expository text STT. 400 28-34: ...] x = muven dmarduk . ..]-nu = musen dutu ...]-nu = muven dU.gur ...] x-nu = musen SAL he-pu [DIS] P ?-ra-pa-di = musen dnusku DIS AD (for DIS ?) .BU = mugen diskur DIS an-pa-tum = muken dgu. la So far as preserved none of these certainly agree with the Birdcall Text. The textual variations involving the deities assigned to particular birds which are found even in the two versions of the birdcall text itself (e.g. the cock belongs to Enmesarra in S 2 but to Nusku in A 15) suggest that these attributions were not firmly estab- lished. The mythological allusions are mostly obscure because of their brevity, but many obviously refer to theomachies. They are part of the large body of myths that were not, so far as is known, ever committed to writing in epic style. However, most of the deities named are known as participants in such struggles somewhere in cuneiform literature. STT. 341 and K Io823 (CT. 41 5) Translation I The aribdnzd is [the bird of] Marduk.

A rev. 12) as better rendering the call of the cock. S 3 = A 16 cf. rev. 8 There may be much corruption in S, since Papsukkal and Kaka are doublets: both are viziers. id.sid could be rendered imtanannu " keeps on reciting ", but the RI is unexplained. S 4 = A I7 cf. rev. II Note the rebus writing i,. gar (igirrui) for igir'd. dakka in S (A has qadda) must be a form of dakdku I (AHw.) and dakdku B (CAD.). The translation is based on the assumption that the two phrases describe the appear- ance of the heron (cf. A rev. I I). However, as suggested by the editor, to whom thanks are due for other helpful suggestions, the first phrase, quddudu appa.Lu, should be translated, in view of the parallel literary passages mentioned in the introduction, " he is dejected " (literally " his nose is bent down " to the ground). This would then be a description, not of the heron, but of the related deity. The second phrase is difficult because of the rarity of dakdku. S 5 cf. i3 = A 18 Since Narudu appears in the line of A followed by ahu ahu, and she is in fact " the sister of the Seven ", as the deity of line 13 below is described (cf. Tallqvist, SO. VII 387), it appears that lines 5 and 13 are doublets, and this raises the question whether si-ih-KUR is not a corruption of ka-te-mat. The present writer knows no bird sihKUR. S 6 = A 14 cf. rev. 14 sussuru explains amursdnu in ijargud (MSL. VIII/2 175 323 cf. 167 254). S 8 -A 2 cf. rev. Io The term mdr larri raises questions. Since all the other owners of birds in this text are gods, so this expression should have divine reference. Ninurta, as son of Enlil, or Nabfi, as son of Marduk, might be meant. ittasd in A suggests a procession in a festival. S 9-II- A 3-4 cf. rev. 6-7 In addition to sinuntu, .inunutu is a well attested form of the name: muLii-nu-nu-tum (CT. 33 2 41 and 4 7; V R. 46 34 a-b), see also ACh. I Sup. 54 12 and CT. 41 5 31. sununutu here seems unique, also the writing sim. MUmusen in A.

[ ... 14 How he is desolated [... 15 Lament, lament [... 16 Tiamat . [... The interesting textual variants are e for bizbiz in S I o, and the occurrence of uis in the same place, which is the basis for the translation variant damu in IV R. This ui, corrupted to nu in IV R. and the beginning of S 10o, is rendered la in IV R. and S I I alongside imtu and damu, but A rev. 7 and S Io (end) correctly lack the negative. Due to the incomplete and corrupt state of the texts it is not clear how this line came to be quoted. A makes it refer to ZiU, and the IB of S could be a corruption of dzu-[. However as a bird himself Zfi is not really appropriate. The following phrase in A, gbirat tdmti, could describe the swallow, but if it is the bird's call, then it should be concerned with the deity. These problems can be solved by emending A to dba ! -Ut, who would then be the subject of jbirat tdmti. This is appropriate in that Bau is traditionally associated with water and fishes. The traces on S could be restored: d !zu !-[ ] re/a'-b[a-rat{K]I . MIN muven} tam-tim. Whatever is made of the preserved texts, there is no evidence that the mulshufu, which is the monster implied in the Nabfi hymn, was ever a symbol of Zi, Bau or Tiamat. S 12 =A 5 cf. rev. 16 Iargud explains ha-si-ba-ru as is-sur kub-ti " bird with crest " (MSL. VIII/2 I66 234 and 176 335), and since kubldnu appears to be lacking from Iarra, the evidence of the two forms of this line must be accepted, that h/asibdru and kubsanu are two names of the same crested bird. For Sirsir, see B. Landsberger, WdO. I 362-366, MSL. III io6 125 and the present writer's forthcoming Babylonian Creation Myths. S 13 - A 18 The Sibittu are commonly described as offspring of Anu, so behind ab ?. dug4. ga there probably lies gig. dug,.ga = re~hut, see SL. 211 48. S 14 = A II TAM of A is to be emended to -te- in accordance with el, of S. Duranki in A, as a title of Nippur, is no doubt meant as a name of Enlil, though it lacks the divine determinative. The meaning of la ka-bar/pdr-ti(m-ma) is uncertain, but perhaps la is abbreviated from sa la " without ". Lines found only in A.
