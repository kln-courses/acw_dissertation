Health Risks from Radiation Exposure for Civilian Aviation Flight Personnel: A Study of Italian Airline Crew Members. Radiat. Res. 156, 689-694 (2001). A study of the effects of exposures of civilian aviation flight personnel to atmospheric ionizing radiation (including high- energy neutrons) is being performed. The results of previous studies and of the criteria required for a more satisfactory outcome in future studies are presented, along with a descrip- tion of the protocol for the Italian national study. A descrip- tion of the cohort is given in terms of its size, composition and member eligibility. The various ways of determining the ex- posure and the health status of past and current aircrew members are discussed, and follow-up procedures are de- scribed. An overview of the data management and processing philosophy adopted in the Italian study is given with regard to flight routes, radiation dose evaluation along the flight paths, and construction of exposure matrices. Other studies of potential interest are also discussed. The study is still in progress, so the results are preliminary. C 2001 by Radiation Research Society INTRODUCTION Techniques to assess the possible risk of health effects from exposure to low-dose-rate radiation require knowl- edge of both the radiation environment and biological re- sponse (1). These effects (e.g. carcinogenesis) are generally evaluated using mathematical models and/or animal and cell experiments (2). Data on human exposures to low- dose-rate ionizing radiation and its effects are not as readily available, especially for stochastic effects (3), such as car- cinogenesis and therefore cancer risk, for which the prob- ability of the event increases with increasing radiation dose (4). One major source of such low-dose-rate data could be aviation personnel (5) if they are considered as epidemio- logical cohorts for studies of the health effects of ionizing radiation, especially cosmic rays, since their total doses would increase over the years of their employment and might lead to delayed radiation-induced health effects. The high-LET and neutron components typical of atmospheric radiation (6) contribute much of the effective dose to these personnel (7). In contrast, the terrestrial background radi- ation (8) on which radiobiological studies are generally based is predominantly low LET (4). Results from studies of flight personnel may be relevant to radiation risk anal- yses for space flights in both near space and deep space2 (9-11), as well as for Martian exploration and colonization3 (12, 13), since the high-altitude aircraft radiation environ- ment is expected to be quite similar to the radiation envi- ronment at the surface of Mars.4 Epidemiological studies of the health status of civilian airline crew members have been initiated in several coun- tries. However, these studies have been limited in scope and cohort size, so no conclusive answers on disease risk have been found. Therefore, a collaborative effort with the par- ticipation of various European countries has been started as a series of individual national-level projects. The results of these studies will then be pooled in a joint analysis using a protocol agreed on by the participants. The design of the study is patterned after that of studies of the health effects of occupational exposures of nuclear industry workers to ionizing radiation (14), in which the results from seven can- cer mortality studies in three countries were pooled for analysis. The national-level studies of airline flight person- nel are under way; the data analysis phase is in progress in ' Author to whom correspondence should be addressed at Lab.

The Italian project described here is one of these studies. The first results are expected soon, and they will provide the potential for interesting side studies. LITERATURE REVIEW AND THE NEED FOR FUTURE STUDIES The discussion of radiation-related health issues for air- craft flight personnel began over 30 years ago (15). In 1990, aircraft flight personnel were given the status of "occupa- tionally exposed to radiation" by the International Com- mission on Radiation Protection (16). It was determined that these personnel receive radiation doses that are at least twice as large as those received by the general population (17). The various epidemiological studies of civilian airline crew members performed until now [e.g. (18-20); reviewed in refs. (21-24)], provided no conclusive answers concern- ing disease risks because of the small sample populations considered in each study. Moreover, all previous studies either contained no information on occupational radiation exposure (radiation dose, flight hours, route haul, etc.), or, in the most recent studies, which have not been included in any of the reviews, used only crude dose estimates (25- 28). As a result, it was not possible to correlate the dose of atmospheric ionizing radiation and (possibly radiation- induced) observed health effects, nor was it possible to dis- criminate between radiation-induced effects and effects caused by potential confounding occupational risk factors (29-34) or those related to lifestyle (35) or leisure activities (36). The possibility of synergistic effects from concomi- tant exposures to different agents (9) was not considered. Tentative evaluations of individual cumulative career doses have been performed with simplistic techniques or ap- proaches (27, 28, 37) that provide dose estimates that can- not be used in dose-effect analyses and related investiga- tions. Thus all these results can be associated only with the "flight environment", with no association with radiation exposure other than the implicit fact that aircraft flight per- sonnel are exposed to the atmospheric ionizing radiation environment. To increase the precision of the estimates of the associ- ation between employment as flight personnel and observed morbidity patterns, different aircrew member cohorts from previous studies have been selected for a meta-analysis us- ing the guidelines proposed by Blair et al. (38). The studies considered were mortality and incidence cohort studies, in- cluding studies of male pilots and female flight attendants. Neither proportional mortality studies nor military aircrew studies were included in the analysis. The results of the individual studies were combined by study outcome (mor- tality or incidence) for cause of death and/or cancer inci- dence sites that had an excess risk in at least one of the individual studies and for which there were at least five total cases among the eligible studies. Calculations of com- bined relative risks for selected causes have been performed using a fixed-effects model with inverse variance weighting of the log risk ratios (39), with an evaluation of potential selection biases and heterogeneity among the combined groups, and with estimates of and adjustments for possible sources of confounding, e.g. by socioeconomic status for those cancer sites that are known to be associated with so- cioeconomic status. The correction for socioeconomic sta- tus has been performed using external (IARC) estimates of confounding by socioeconomic differences in cancer inci- dence and mortality, as described elsewhere (21, 39). For male pilots, the results from two to four individual studies per subcategory were included to estimate the combined risks for nine causes of death (of which seven are cancer- related) or cancer incidence sites, resulting in increased ad- justed relative risks for mortality from melanoma and brain cancer and for incidence of prostate and brain cancer. For female cabin attendants, the results from two studies were combined for the incidence of all cancers, melanoma and breast cancer; excess risks were found for all these sites. Excess disease risks have been found in individual studies, but it has not been possible to confirm these results due to the lack of power of the studies. However, in the meta- analysis process for both male and female crew members, the combined RRs have large confidence intervals, extend- ing well below an RR of I (see Table 1). The results there- fore must be interpreted with caution. The results for all cancer sites are also shown in Table 1. This work has been published in ref. (21). Specific needs and guidelines for future studies have been identified from the studies described above. Further investigations should be performed using much larger co- horts, such as those composed of all the flight personnel of a civilian airline or several civilian airlines together, to pro- vide more conclusive answers and results, to reduce uncer- tainties, and to make even small associations detectable. There should also be a much better description of the flight environment to which the aircrew members were exposed to make dose reconstruction as accurate as possible. The latter requires an in-depth knowledge of the ionizing radi- ation environment of the atmosphere and of its variation with location, altitude and time and information about each crew member's flight history that is as detailed as possible, perhaps including details of each working day of the indi- vidual flights on which each crew member flew, as well as detailed information about the flight paths of each flight, including timing, geographic coordinates, and altitudes. This information can be used to provide more solid clues on disease morbidity patterns after exposure to atmospheric ionizing radiation and for risk analysis. The need for a mul- tipart study or an international study to obtain a much larger cohort size with the radiation exposure patterns considered in detail was recognized several years ago (40).

A collab- orative effort involving 10 European countries (Denmark, Finland, Germany, Greece, Iceland, Italy, The Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and United Kingdom) has been started and will be composed of individual national-level projects that will be pooled in a joint analysis following a jointly agreed protocol, as outlined in ref. (23). This protocol is not necessarily the same one used in each of the national studies, because the analysis protocols differed widely. Most of these national-level studies are presently under way, with the data analysis phase currently in progress. The joint data analysis phase for the European project will fol- low. The remainder of this paper describes the Italian na- tional study. STUDY RATIONALE Radiation exposure is determined for each flight crew member based on his or her work history and is calculated from the actual flight paths taking the atmospheric ionizing radiation environment into account. The individual expo- sure is then associated with the cohort member's vital and/ or health status, and possible radiation-induced effects are tested as disease mortality and incidence risk patterns in comparison with the general population. The possible ex- posure categories among the cohort members are consid- ered in these analyses. All Italian civilian airline flight per- sonnel, both cockpit (pilots, flight engineers) and cabin (at- tendants, i.e. hostesses and stewards) crew members, em- ployed between January 1, 1965, and December 31, 1996 were eligible for the study. About 10,000 crew members have been selected, and complete records of their work his- tory and the actual flights they have flown (route, aircraft type, date, etc. for each individual flight for each person, where possible) are considered for each of them. The his- tories included flights flown before 1965 for those crew members already employed at the date from which the anal- ysis starts. Data on actual flight legs and route profiles have been obtained for the whole time frame. The actual dose and dose-equivalent calculations are performed along spe- cific flight legs, taking into account the actual flight profiles for the different routes and the variations in the solar and geomagnetic parameters. Then the doses for the appropriate flights are assigned to each crew member to obtain the in- dividual annual and lifetime occupational dose. For vali- dation, statistical approaches are also considered. Apart from chronic low-dose-rate career exposures, radiation from large solar particle events (SPEs) has to be considered. Dose rates during SPEs are higher, and the total dose may increase the risk to the crew members (41). All confound- ing radiation exposures (medical, radon) are taken into ac- count. EXPOSURE ASSESSMENT The actual radiation dose calculations along specific flight legs, taking into account the different flight profiles for different routes and the variations over the considered period of the heliocentric potential and of the geomagnetic field, are currently performed with the CARI-66 software, a computer program provided by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) that, starting from a primary cosmic- ray spectrum (42), uses the technique LUIN2000 of K. O'Brien (manuscript in preparation), i.e. the traditional LUIN method (43) coupled with FLUKA results (44) to 6 K. O'Brien, D. E Smart, M. A. Shea, E. Felsberger, U. Schrewe, W. Friedberg and K.

Some modifications of the usual CARI techniques (45, 46) are needed to make it suitable for the project, the most important being that the dose for each flight is estimated along the actual flight path, i.e. taking into account the geographical coordinates and the actual flight phases and cruise altitudes of a flight, with the desired time step between two subsequent points, rather than using the ideal geometrical approximations of the trajectory (i.e. maximum circles between departure and arrival locations). Another software package to be used for the dose calcula- tion process is being developed at the NASA Langley Re- search Center and is based on the AIR model (5, 41). It will be used to analyze actual 3D flight paths to take into account very old flights (before 1958) and SPEs of histor- ical importance (47, 48). STUDY OUTCOMES A complete description of the radiation exposure patterns for the Italian civilian aviation flight personnel is expected in terms of annual and lifetime doses and dose equivalents, separating doses from low-LET and high-LET particles, for each cohort member. Analogous results are expected for each flight route, aircraft type, calendar date, job title, flight haul, and flight altitude, and for all parameters describing flight scenarios. The individual radiation exposure patterns can be matched with the cohort cause-specific morbidity risks by using standard epidemiological procedures based on the person-year approach (49, 50). This allows an external comparison with the general Italian population, a standard- ized mortality ratio (SMR), which will be possible because of the availability of national mortality data, and a stan- dardized incidence ratio (SIR) in those instances where dis- ease registration coverage makes it possible. It also allows comparisons by exposure categories for cosmic radiation and for other exposures of interest (e.g. fuels) to remove effects caused by confounding factors and to check for ev- idence of synergistic effects from exposures to different agents. The follow-up protocol and procedures, along with the rules for the protection of human subjects, are those usually adopted in Italy for similar studies; they are de- scribed in ref. (51). The present investigation has various limitations. The co- hort is composed of relatively young people, younger than those in most other flight personnel studies. Thus low mor- tality and cancer incidence rates are expected, resulting in a reduced ability to estimate risks and to identify associa- tions between occupational exposures, including exposures to cosmic radiation, and death from cancer, if such an as- sociation exists. For persons exposed to 100 mSv of cosmic radiation over a lifetime career of flying at aircraft altitudes, which is a high dose for civilian airline crew members, the overall excess lifetime cancer mortality risk due to cosmic radiation is very low, estimated at 0.5%, compared to a lifetime mortality risk of 25% for cancers arising from all other possible causes (52). For breast cancer, for example, the presumed relative risk is 1.04 for occupational exposure to cosmic radiation, a rate that is rather difficult to detect in an epidemiological study of moderate dimensions such as this one (49, 50). With respect to previous studies, the exposure patterns in this study are obtained with greater accuracy not only in terms of work history and career dose evaluation but also in flight profiles, three-dimensional re- construction, and radiation transport computation. Thus the division into categories can be performed based on different parameters and with smaller steps, allowing for a more pre- cise analysis protocol. One source of inaccuracy in the work history reconstruction is the fact that it has not been possible to ascertain if cockpit or cabin crew members who left service before the end of the observation period con- tinued their flying careers with other airline companies abroad. The data analysis is in progress, and the first results are expected soon. Such a large set of data on radiation expo- sure patterns may provide the potential for some interesting side studies, such as an assessment of the effects of prenatal exposure, to obtain clues about possible embryonic damage and/or lethality (and/or possible association with childhood disease) and about deterministic effects during organogen- esis, especially those due to high-LET radiation (2). It might also be used in association with cytogenetic studies to relate cell damage or chromosomal aberrations to a quan- titative and qualitative evaluation of radiation exposure, to assess whether radiation doses on an individual level can be determined from analyses of lymphocyte chromosome aberrations (53, 54).
