<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE COOPERATION OF MEDIAEVAL PENANCE AND SECULAR LAW' BY THOMAS P. OAKLEY IN THE historical relations of Church and State there is an important chapter which until recently has been wholly neglected, and in which many pages are still missing. This chapter is concerned with the cooiperation of the mediaeval Church and State in combatting what we now call crimes.2 It is known that the processes which furnished the foundations for mod- ern penal law among Celtic and Germanic peoples developed in the Middle Ages.3 The rise of orderly and relatively peaceful methods of settling dis- putes was ushered in by the customs of compounding the blood-feud into money payments, of submitting disputes to the judgment of a court, and of making some provision for the enforcement of court decisions; while malefactors must sometimes suffer additional punishment as breakers of the king's peace.4 But these orderly processes had to struggle against power- ful obstacles, which long retarded the development of peaceful justice. Private vengeance was still allowed in some cases, and sometimes developed into dangerous private wars,5 for some time, the executive machinery for enforcing the law was weak;6 the method of choosing compurgators would 1 Read before the American Society for Church History, December 28, 1931. 2 lVhat we now regard as crimes against the public peace were then more often considered as torts, or wrongs against the individual or clan; cf. T. P. Oakley, English Penitential Disci- pline and Anglo-Saxon Law, (Columbia University Studies in History, cvii, no. 2, New York, 1923), chap. v, and infra. But we shall find it more convenient to use the word 'crime' in its popular sense-i.e., to mean an offence punishable by law. 3 The native elements may have arisen before then and the Roman contributions certainly did, but the actual growth of all these elements among Celtic and Germanic races was in the Middle Ages. Vide infra, the works on the laws of these peoples, passim. 4 Historical antecedent of the present public peace. Vide H.

This aid was rendered by the Church, through religious sanctions and safeguards to strengthen legal procedure, provisions which backed secular enforcement, and supplementary penalties for delinquents. Ecclesiastical discipline was the natural means used for this cooperation,3 and the chief instrument for such discipline was penance.4 Penitential discipline had close connections with many more aspects of mediaeval life than has usually been represented by historians dealing with penance.5 It possessed many ramifications, which penetrated deeply into numerous phases of mediaeval society, secular as well as ecclesiastical. Social life was profoundly affected by numerous penitential prescriptions, which regulated such varied matters as food and drink, marriage, sexual relations, charity, the treatment of children,6 the emancipation of bondmen, and the sacredness of oaths.7 Behind the constant pressure exerted upon the criminal by ecclesiastical discipline and secular law lay other close connections between Church and State. These associations are to be observed in manifold aspects, with an influence which pervaded a great part of life in the Middle Ages. In contrast to our present practice, the secular laws of that time con- stantly reiterated that crimes were sins, and that secular penal law had a religious, as well as a punitive purpose.8 In addition to being wrongs against 1 They were usually chosen in fixed numbers from the kindred of the accused; hence it might often happen that compurgators would swear to matters of which they were ignorant.

Laws of Ireland, i, 232, ii, 280 et seqq., III, 152 and passim. 2 The exact offences so neglected differed for each of the above peoples. Among the Anglo- Saxons, the punishment of perjury, sexual, and ecclesiastical offences were usually left to the Church; vide Oakley, op. cit., pp. 141-142. 3 For moral and ecclesiastical purposes of penances, see the appropriate articles in the encyclopedias of theology, etc. 4 In addition to excommunication, degradation, etc. The greater ban of excommunication was an emergency measure, whereas penance was the more usual means of discipline; cf. the references supra and the arts.

This conception is best exemplified in the Irish laws, in which the Old-Irish verb used to express the commission of a crime also means 'to defile,' and it is definitely stated that 'body and soul are defiled by com- mitting crimes.'2 To purge the criminal from this defilement and to punish him for his crime, the secular laws constantly aided the Church by requir- ing and enforcing auricular confession, penance and excommunication. Such laws exist for each of the peoples in question. Among the Welsh, the Laws of Hoel the Good required auricular con- fession of all above the age of seven;3 and specifically demanded the perform- ance of penance in cases of homicide,4waylaying, and treason against a lord.' Among the Irish, the Brehon Laws elevated the position of culprits who had gone to confession and were undergoing penance ;6 demanded that crim- inals perform penance in addition to other penalties;7 and visited them with partial outlawry until they completed the penances assigned by the clergy.8 In the Laws of Alfred the Great, criminals who sought sanctuary, and there confessed their offences to a priest, should have half of the secular composition remitted.9 Other laws of the Anglo-Saxons required penance for sins in general and for crimes specifically, under penalty of fines for failure to do penance.10 In addition to the pressure of penance and of secular com- positions, the criminal was subjected to the ban of excommunication. This was greatly feared because of the terrible curses heaped upon each member of the culprit's body and upon all persons who aided him." Excommunica- tion carried additional force in that the excommunicated person was de- barred from the royal court, from the right to burial in consecrated ground, and from the rites of the Church, as well as being subjected to social ostra- cism.,2 Legg., Sect. ii, vol. i (ed.

With the Merovingians, such legislation is exemplified in a decree of Childebert, in 595, requiring penance for incest.2 But the Carolingian monarchs constantly reiterated severe laws requiring the performance of public and private penance. Under Carloman and Pippin, several capitularies were promulgated de- manding that ecclesiastical discipline be strictly carried out. Beginning in 742, with provisions applying to false priests and sexual offences, the list of misdeeds for which penance must be performed was extended to many other offences.3 Further decrees required penance for misdeeds in general.4 Under Pippin, in particular, stern laws visited with exile,5 outlawry, fines or imprisonment those who refused to do penance.' The capitularies of Charlemagne frequently ordain ecclesiastical penal- ties, or otherwise hold up the hands of the bishops in disciplining their flocks, in decrees that increasingly become more detailed and severe. In the general capitulary of 760-761, there are several general provisions for enforcing penance.7 In 779, the bishops were empowered to deal with those guilty of incest, and those who resisted episcopal action should suffer con- fiscation.8 A capitulary attributed to the year 802 instructs the counts and the missi to coerce all who refuse to submit to sentences from their bishops, and to perform penances inposed.9 In the same year, another capitulary passed at Aix demands penance for homicide, parricide, infanticide, and illicit and incestuous living, under pain of forfeiture.'0 1 For brief but inadequate treatments: J.

Under Louis le Debonnaire, (814-840) capitularies attempted to revive public penance;' and one who should murder a penitent must pay a triple fine, in addition to the wergeld.2 Still later, Charles the Bald, unable to repress or punish rapine by retainers of his lawless nobles, called upon the bishops to impose penance upon the offenders, and to excommunicate their masters who failed to desist and repent.3 The Church, on its side, supplied potent religious sanctions to reinforce the law. Many religious concepts and customs profoundly affected various phases of secular law, through religious taboos, ideas of magic and of mana.4 veneration of ancestors,5 fear of anthropomorphic deities,6 and the like. These religious sanctions reached back into pagan times and were continued under Christianity, when the powers of pagan priests and deities over law were followed by similar powers of the Christian priests, saints and God.7 Legal procedure was backed by awe-inspiring religious sanctions and sur- rounded by solemn religious rituals ;8 and it was devoutly believed that God and the saints visited with dire vengeance those who misused relics and other religious safeguards employed by secular law.9 Particularly significant were the religious rituals and safeguards used to impart greater sanctity to oaths, especially because such oaths were then required in a multitude of penal, political, business, social and religious transactions. Although these oaths were frequently administered among the Germanic peoples,'0 some of the most interesting examples survive for the Welsh and Irish. In addition to the usual clearing-oaths in criminal cases," the Welsh laws demanded oaths sworn on relics, or on other holy articles or persons,'2 in 1 MGH., Legg., iv, 526, in 819 and the Lombard Laws in ibid. 2 Ibid., iv, 282, cap. 5; Lea, op. cit., ii, 74. 3 Ibid., ii, 11; cf.

It was believed that such perjury was subject to super- natural punishment, which was greatly feared.'4 According to the Irish laws, God, Himself, also 'avenged upon a territory false witness, false judgment for hire and false contracts."5 Both Church and State saw to it that perjurors received condign pun- ishment through secular penalties and ecclesiastical discipline. The measures taken against perjury, that most deadly menace to law enforcement, furnish some of the best examples of the cooperation of the two disciplines. As there were essential differences in the treatment of this offence in Wales, Ireland, England and the Carolingian kingdoms, they must be discussed separately. For perjury, the Welsh laws decreed that penance must be performed, in addition to the payment of heavy secular fines.-" Perjurers were also sub- jected to serious legal disabilities, and were denied the right of sanctuary.'7 In the Welsh penitential canons, the penances for perjury were differenti- ated according to circumstances, ranging from one or two years'8 to six or 1 Anc.

The Brehon Laws provided a great variety of penalties for perjury, cor- responding to the different circumstances in which an oath had been taken, the rank of the injured,3 the place from which an article had been stolen,4 etc. Perjury in cases involving the ownership of property5 entailed restitu- tion,' plus the payment of honor-price and a fine.7 Laymen who committed perjury also suffered diminished honor-price,8 while clerics guilty of this offence lost full honor-price, plus ecclesiastical penalties.9 The secular penalties were in addition to the penances imposed.10 The amount of penance to be assigned was determined by the clergy." For taking a false oath, the Penitential of Vinnian required severe penance for seven years, plus the emancipation of a slave or the giving of equivalent alms; and the offender should never again take an oath.'2 In the Penitential of Cummean,'3 perjury is penanced according to the degree of the offence, terms of one, two, four, or seven years being assigned.'4 Among the Anglo-Saxons, a few of the earlier secular laws penalized per- jury by heavy fines;'5 while later laws punished it with mutilation, or fines,'6 or exile,'7 and perjurors were denied the right to take an oath.'8 But the English secular law put upon the Church the chief burdens of preventing 1 Six, for lay suborners, and seven for the clergy.

To strengthen the sanctity of the law, the peniten- tials used in England prescribed detailed and severe penances for perjury. The Penitential of Theodore penalizes different degrees of this offence by terms of one, three, or eleven years;2 and somewhat similar treatment is accorded by the Penitential of Bede.3 In that ascribed to Egbert, the pen- alties for perjury are very complicated; the terms running for various periods, from three quadrigesimae4 to as high as eleven years.' Very severe penances for perjury are also prescribed by later English penitentials.6 According to a decree of Charlemagne, he who has been convicted of perjury shall lose a hand, or redeem7 it. In addition to such a penalty, Con- tinental penitentials of the eighth and early ninth centuries demanded, for perjury, penances differing according to the degree of the offence, like the corresponding prescriptions of Cummean, Vinnian and Theodore,8 already mentioned. Penitential discipline rendered valuable aid to the secular laws in other ways. Penitential provisions continually insisted that penitents obey the sentences of the secular authorities,9 under pain of additional penance for refusal to do justice.10 Restitution must be made for property stolen or for other wrongs perpetrated." Of particular interest are provisions concern- ing reparations for wounds. Of Irish origin, and subsequently incorporated into penitentials elsewhere, these demanded that he who wounds another must pay for medical treatment, do the work of the injured until his re- covery, and perform penance, as well as paythe regular secularcomposition.'2 Some of the strongest obstacles to the preservation of law and order, in early stages of law, are the survival of the blood-feud and the right of pri- vate vengeance. Among the peoples under discussion, these customs per- sisted alongside of more orderly methods of settling disputes and, in some cases, were recognized by law.'3 But the penitential system set its face I Ibid., ii, s.v.

From the secular laws, we have already seen that criminals must perform penance, in addition to fulfilling the secular penalties. Hence, in the medi- aeval system of social control, the administrative pressure exerted against crimes might amount to a severe total of discipline, composed of secular and ecclesiastical parts.2 In general, the secular penalties were usually money compositions, paid to the victim's kindred in case of homicide, or to the injured person in case of other personal wrongs.3 Penitential disci- pline generally consisted of fasting for three days a week or for three forty- day periods a year, during the term assigned for a specific sin,4 with some commutation or redemption of penance for those who could not fast.5 A few typical combinations of penances with secular penalties will show the severity of the total punishment suffered by the criminal. Among the Welsh, the slayer of a common freeman must pay one-hun- dred twenty-six kine,6 besides the penance for a capital offence.7 For petty larceny, the penalty was convict-slavery,8 plus a penance of six months, or of one or two years.9 With the Irish, the kindred of a slain freeman must be paid seven bond- women or their equivalent,' plus the honor-price of the slayer," plus other secular compensations;12 and the slayer suffered partial or complete loss of legal protection until he performed penance, of which the term was for seven years or more."3 For theft, the customary secular penalty was double 1 Oakley, op. cit., pp. 167-169. The penances might be forty days, three years, three and one-half years, seven or ten years, according to the penitential in question. 2 Penance was intended to be medicinal. as well as punitive.

Sometimes the Church provided the only penalties for certain serious offences of this character: e.g. for sodomy, bestiality, and other unnatural offences. Among the Anglo- Saxons, many sexual offences were peculiarly in the jurisdiction of the Church: Liebermann op. cit., II, s.vv.
