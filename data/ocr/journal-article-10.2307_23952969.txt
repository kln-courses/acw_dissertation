<plain_text><page sequence="1">Dieu à l'Image de l'Homme, by F. Michaeli. Pp. 173. Neuchâtel: Delachaux &amp; Niestlé. 1950. 6 Fr. 50 (Swiss). The author begins with a fairly rapid review of the wealth of anthropo morphism and anthropopathism in the Old Testament in order to demonstrate, in the later parts of the book, both the uniqueness of the Old Testament idea of God and its appropriateness as an introduction to the Christian revelation of God incarnate. The Old Testament is shown to have been subjected to a certain amount of revision and modification in order to avoid undue increase of anthropomorphic idiom and to gain at the same time a positive emphasis on God's moral purity and 'holiness'. The modifications began while the Old Testament was still in growth and continued to be made by editors during its subsequent transmission. The book is to be welcomed as a careful and stimulating study of the relevance of anthropomorphism in Jewish and Christian religious thought and language ; but one may regret that the author did not give more space and attention to the origin and meaning of the words, idioms, and metaphors which are involved in anthropomorphic usage. There is general agreement about the value and necessity of anthropo morphism; but there are few scholars who would not wish for more information about its beginnings and about the phrases which have become its common coin.
