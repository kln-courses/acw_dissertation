In recent years, colonial mapping of South Asia has drawn the atten tion of a substantial number of scholars. Following J. B. Harley's works, these studies tend to problematize maps as an objective scientific entity. Mathew Edney, for example, in an influential study regarded colonial</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews i6i mapping as discursive tool of British imperial domination of India.1 Manu Goswami asserted that national space, a notion that implies a territorial-political isomorphism of India, was produced by economic exigencies of the British imperial state in the mid and late nineteenth century.2 Sumathi Ramaswamy has outlined how colonial maps were transformed into anthropomorphic forms of mother goddess symbol izing motherland in the Indian nationalist imagination.3 Ian J. Barrow, who is definitely a leading figure among scholars engaged in studying maps as a scientific intellectual tool of colonial control and domination, has argued in his earlier monograph Making History, Drawing Territory that colonial maps simultaneously signified the British possession of India and highlighted the separateness of British identity from Indian identity through a divergent projection of histories of possession.4 In his current work on the history of surveying in Sri Lanka under Dutch and British rule, Barrow follows research threads of his earlier study in a rather uncharted field. Barrow starts with a simple query: why did the colonial survey office of Sri Lanka produce inferior-quality maps? The obvious implication of his investigation is that maps are essential tools of modern governance and rule of property. For him, inferior quality maps produced by a colo nial survey department cast doubts on the modernity of the British regime in Sri Lanka. Barrow establishes his case in two different ways. First, Barrow starts with the wider theoretical question about the uni versalistic nature of science introduced through the agency of the colo nial state. His verdict is in favor of the much disputed, theoretically loaded term "colonial science." For Barrow, the scientific exercises of the colonial state, such as surveying, were so deeply embedded in the colonial power relationship that results of such scientific works can not be viewed as universal. Barrow also contests the wider consensus 1 Mathew Edney, Mapping an Empire: The Geographical Construction of British India, 1765-1843 (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1997). 2 Manu Goswami, Producing India: From Colonial Economy to National Space (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2004). 3 Sumathi Ramaswamy, The Lost Land of Lemuria: Fabulous Geographies, Catastrophic Histories (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2004); Ramaswamy, "Visualizing India's Geo-body: Globes, Maps, Bodyscapes," Contributions to Indian Sociology 36, nos. 1-2 (2002): 157-195; Ramaswamy, "Conceit of the Globe in Mughal India," Comparative Studies in Soci ety and History 49, no. 4 (2007): 751-782; Ramaswamy, "Maps, Mother/goddesses and Mar tyrdom in Modern India," Journal of Asian Studies 67, no. 3 (2008): 1-35. 4 Ian J.

Instead of viewing the colonial state as the harbinger of progressive modernity or alternatively as super exploiter of the local population, Barrow maintains that the colonial state was rather an incompetent institution incapable of instituting far reaching changes. For him, the survey department, a crucial tool of the colonial government in controlling peasantry and land, was a rather mediocre, cumbersome bureaucratic apparatus that failed to match the expectations of a modern state. Barrow elucidates his argument through a detailed empirical his tory of the survey and settlement department. He starts his story with the Dutch survey of coastal Sri Lanka, which was under Dutch control for nearly 138 years. He argues that the Dutch surveyors Jacob Burnat and Altendorff produced the most accurate map of the coastline of Sri Lanka. According to Barrow, the establishment of a survey department was intricately tied to British colonial expansion in Sri Lanka. The British ruling elites established the department in August 1800 soon after taking control of Dutch possessions in maritime Sri Lanka, and the department witnessed a revival when the new province comprising the Kandyan kingdom was added to their dominion. Yet the depart ment was soon saddled with the responsibility of public works, such as road building, and thus was overburdened with work. Moreover, the surveyor general's office was coupled with the position of civil engi neers, and thus road building acquired priority over surveying. Barrow moves forward with a depiction of a decaying survey department that neither built good quality roads nor produced an adequate number of good maps. Yet the very process of road construction in the 1820s slowly trans formed the economy of the island and boosted agricultural productivity. With this growth in rural productivity, new rulers turned their atten tion to coffee plantations for economic self-sufficiency for the colony. Colonial cadastral survey as well as the production of topographic maps became tied to the expansion of plantation economy. Surveyors were 5 David Scott, Refashioning Futures: Criticism after Postcoloniality (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1999), p. 41, quoted in Barrow, Surveying and Mapping in Colo nial Sri Lxnka, p. 14.</page><page sequence="4">Book Reviews 163 pressed into cadastral mapping of government-controlled forest lands, which were then auctioned off to coffee planters. Instead of producing detailed topographic maps of the entire island, colonial surveyors went on working for coffee plantations. In many instances, government offi cials bought forest lands to establish plantations. By highlighting the relationship between surveying and the growth of coffee plantations, Barrow here skillfully demonstrates why surveying became colonial science catering to colonial economy rather engaged in disseminating scientific knowledge. Surveyors at local levels were often described as indolent by superiors in their department. Racial prejudices against surveyors of mixed-race Dutch descent were evident in many correspondences among surveyor generals. Workers for such survey works were procured through coer cive means. Leaders of the survey department were either disinterested and uninspiring or lackadaisical in their approaches to work. Taking advantage of weak and disinterested leadership, many embezzled funds from the department. In the twentieth century, Sri-Lankans entered the survey department, and colonial control was slowly relaxed over the department. Barrow's work raises crucial questions about the relationship between science technology and the willingness of the state to transform the practice of governance. His work is methodical, engaging, and solidly based on empirical research. It also provides us with an analysis of the refreshingly uncharted history of mapping and surveying in colonial Sri Lanka. Yet the monograph could have offered us more in terms of wider theoretical insights into the relationship between science, the colonial state, and modernity by taking his questions further. Despite his for midable knowledge of the subject in this area, he exercises a strange self-restraint in relation to theories. This restraint produces a critical contradiction in his thesis. He maintains that the survey department is incompetent and thus reflects the incapacity of the colonial state to embark upon a project of capitalist modernization. This incapac ity of the state is not proved by his empirical materials. Rather his monograph presents the story of a strategically active state that can overcome the mediocrity of its staff when it came to clearing forests and establishing plantations in order to boost colonial interests in the economy. The problem with colonial modernity was not its mediocrity and incompetence but its spasmodic form of strategic intervention that limits its action only to serve its own interests. Thus Barrow was right in using the term "colonial science" but fails to extend the argument to its fullest extent. Despite this inherent contradiction in his thesis, this</page><page sequence="5">I?4 JOURNAL OF WORLD HISTORY, MARCH 20I0 tome is an important contribution to the history technocratic side of colonial state and the relationship between colonialism and scientific modernity in South Asia.
