And, above all, he will know tht he needs courage-simple, rugged, God- given courage-if he really is to bear witness to the truth.-GENE E. BARTLETT. ROBINSON, H. WHEELER. The Cross of Hosea. Edited by ERNEST A. PAYNE. Philadelphia: Westmin- ster Press, 1949. 64 pages. $I.5o. A year ago Ernest A. Payne of Regent's Park Col- lege, Oxford, edited for posthumous publication H. Wheeler Robinson's Two Hebrew Prophets: Studies in Hosea and Ezekiel. The Cross of Hosea is an American issue of the first half of that volume. Both the title and the concern of the little book make it an addition to the author's well-known trilogy on the cross in the Old Testament. The author's point of departure in the interpre- tation of the prophet is the story of Hosea's mar- riage, which he accepts as a historical experience. He does not feel that Hosea married a woman known to be a harlot; rather the prophet describes her as such after her unfaithfulness. He treats the first and third chapters as accounts of one and the same event. That is, the third chapter is neither prelude nor se- quel to the first. The first he considers a biographer's report, the third an autobiographical fragment. But the little book is definitely not an essay in literary criticism. It serves rather to illustrate Pro- fessor Robinson's frequently published view on the character of biblical religion as a "theology of ex- perience." That there is no "otherness" in revela- tion, that human experience reveals God, and that the individualization of such experience is the apex of biblical development are pivotal points in his posi- tion. The Bible, he asserts, does not superimpose a theological structure upon the events of history; it goes deeper into them to discover their intrinsic na- ture and cosmic significance. But in this book one feels that the author's emphasis is psychological rather than historical. The Bible is a unity because, throughout, it finds "God in man." The truth about God is discovered by projecting the inner experience of men-finally, by the individual projection of per- sonal experiences. Robinson suggests that the Bible rejected material images of deity in favor of the "higher anthropomorphism" in which the human medium provides revelation with an instrument that is dynamic and ever moving forward. One wonders whether this immanentist view of revelation would really have been as great a bulwark against idolatry as the author thinks and whether Israel did not, in- deed, actually have a more substantial one. It is this reader's impression that the author's own carefully worked-out theological framework has not really been exhaustively illustrated in this little volume on Hosea. There is, after all, a difference between say- ing that "human experience can reveal God" and saying that the revealing activity of God is revealed in human experience.-J. COERT RYLAARSDAM. NOTES 329 SANGSTER, W. E. Let Me Commend. Nashville: Abington-Cokesbury Press, I948. I50 pages. $I.75. The title of this book on realistic evangelism is taken from Charles Wesley's plea, "O let me com- mend my Saviour to you." Dr. Sangster uses direct and understandable language in showing Christians how to do this effectively in our time. The author defines evangelism as "going to people outside" the church with the gospel. He contends that "the gospel is relevant" to our day and "has proved itself in age after age of crisis . . to be matched to world need." He feels that "our business is to proclaim" this gospel. The forms of evangelistic effort, including public platform approaches, teamwork, and personal witness, are dealt with in simple language and clear detail. Such a method is commendable for many church members, and certainly for a great majority of Americans. While most people in this country have at least a high-school education of a secular nature, few have more than a third-grade training in religious matters. Surely a very simple approach in telling of Jesus and his message for his day and ours is best suited for the needs of most of us. An understanding of what evangelism is and how it can be made to work is the double aim of the writer. He defines evangelism as "the good news of God" and contends that, while all Chris- tians are called to be evangelists, not all can be public preachers of the Word. Yet all can bring others to Christ through personal testimony and witness. Let Me Commend is a refreshing book. While the stress on practical methods is helpful, one feels at least a tendency toward oversimplification. Useful insights in dealing with individuals are evidenced, but would it not be better to offer these as "sug- gestions" than as "rules" for proceeding? Dr. Sangster recognizes the need for a complete gospel of both individual salvation and social re- demption. Yet his chief emphasis is on the former. His strategy for achieving social redemption solely through the work of the redeemed individual might be said to be lacking in method. Theologically, the book takes the Arminian position for granted, exalting man's ability to right his own wrongs by seriously limiting the ultimate power of God. To many who search for real answers to difficult prob- lems these days, this theology is inconclusive and incomplete. Yet, in spite of these criticisms, the reviewer has been helped by the realistically practical and constructive discussion of the subject of evangelism. Many of our ministers are afraid of evangelism, trying to forget or evade Charles Wesley's central theme. Surely, our chief business is to lead men and women to take a stand for Christ, committing their lives to his plan and purpose.-RAY FREEMAN JENNEY.</page></plain_text>
