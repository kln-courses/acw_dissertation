<plain_text><page sequence="1">45 NOTES ON THE RELATION OF MYTH TO RITUAL AMONG THE GURUNGS OF NEPAL. S.S. Strickland In The Foundations of Faith and Morals, Malinowski makes the following observation: The knowledge of the mythological past supplies man with the incentive, as well as with the justification, for ritual and moral action; it furnishes him with a body of indications and directions for the correct performance of the sacred acts (1936:13). In discussing this lucid statement of the 'charter' theory of myth, the present essay attempts to show for the Gurung category of ritual narratives per (i) that Malinowski's view is in certain clear instances supportable; (ii) that this view is not, however, generalis able to all pé; and (iii) that certain narratives make it difficult to uphold a clear distinction between mythic discourse on the one hand, and ritual action on the other. I The Gurungs The Gurungs inhabit the southern slopes of the Annapurna and Lamjung Himal in the Gandaki Zone of the Middle Western Hills of Nepal. The distribution of those calling themselves 'Gurung' is in fact more extensive, both because of migration in search of land or work, and because the name is in places still being adopted. They are largely settled, farming wet rice, millet and maize between altitudes of 3,000 and 7,000 feet. In higher reaches, there is considerable but diminishing transhumance. They fought for Prthwi Narayan Sah during his attempts to unify the state in the latter half of the eighteenth century; and they have, since the early nineteenth century, formed part of the Gurkha Regiments of the British and Indian armies. Gurung language is classed by Shafer as the Gurung Branch of the Bodish Section of the Bodic Division of the Sino-Tibetan Family (1955:100-01; 1974:123-27). The Gurungs have received considerable attention in the past from anthropologists, notably the late Bernard Pignède (1966), Macfarlane (1976), and Messerschmidt (1976a, 1976b and elsewhere). No author has yet superceded Pignède's remarkable chapters on the religion of the Gurungs (1966:289-390); and the present essay is part of a more detailed study which owes a great deal to his pioneering effort.^"</page><page sequence="2">46 II The Two Types of Priest The pairing of ritual specialists has been widely observed in the Himalayas and adjacent parts of the Indian subcontinent; and in distinguishing between the poju or medicine-man and hlewri or priest 2 of local fertility cults, the Gurungs are no exception. Whereas the latter is chiefly a representative of the village community before a deity whose domain is identified with the village territory, the former is a specialist whose principal tasks include the summoning of the souls of the sick, the banishment of harm induced by witches, and the appropriation of good fortune. So phrased, the contrast appears strong; but both types of priest honour the same local deities. Although they invoke the ancestors for distinct sub-clans (localised patrilineal descent groups), they work together in complex funeral rites. The narrative pé belonging to each type overlap to a consider able extent, both in linguistic style and in content. Thus the contrast becomes less marked, and the balance between these attributes of the two types actually varied somewhat as one crosses Gurung country. The material for this study comes from Siklis, a village in central Gurung land where both pojus and hlewris are relatively plentiful. Further to the east, the proportion of hlewris increases while declining somewhat to the west, as Pignède noted (1966:390). The reasons, for this are complex and outside the scope of this essay. Like other priests in Nepal, the poju and hlewri conduct rites which consist principally in long recitations of orally transmitted learning. These recitations are termed pê or péda-luda.^ Distinct rites are characterised by different combinations of pêz the shortest rite observed contained one pe, the longest was a priest's funeral of which the total number of chants performed came to 76 lasting for three days and nights. A pe falls within the range of 15 to 1,000 'lines' or metrical phrases in length. In addition to the pé, there are short spells whispered by the priest to make 'pure' (Nepali cokho) the rainshield on which he sits, and to protect those present from evil. Spells are highly valued for what they are thought able to achieve, though the words are not attributed specific meanings by the priests. Whereas the pê are intelligible to many priests, it is characteristic of spells that they are not meaningful. The emphasis in these rites is on the verbal aspects of perform</page><page sequence="3">47 ance. Ritual activity is by contrast less elaborate and extensive. The priest customarily recites sitting before a basket of millet grain, a dish of popped rice, a bowl of rice grain, a basket of feathers and certain other items of paraphernalia. If there is a sacrifice, of a chicken or goat or sheep, it will occur after the recitations have been completed. To illustrate, it is useful to consider a rich example taken from the repertoire of the poju. Ill Making Meat for the Demon: A Poju's Rite This rite is conducted three days after violent deaths, when the demonic part (mo) of the deceased's soul (plah) is supposed to be especially dangerous. The aim of the rite is (i) to retrieve the souls of the living, which have been taken away by the departed, and (ii) to summon the demon to receive offerings before expelling it. The same rite is also conducted at any time for auspicious purposes, and is then known by a different name. Pignède describes a similar rite under the term mose ho-ba (1966:329-30, 360-61); and there are superficial similarities with the Lepcha moong sot 'killing the devil' described by Gorer (1967:234). (1) Paraphernalia. These include an upturned basket, on the base of which is fixed a bow so that the poju can play the bow string as 4 he chants; morsels of meat or fried egg are fixed onto splinters of bamboo laid across the base of the basket beneath the bow. A dish of polished rice contains also a thigh-bone trumpet and a small, wooden, anthropomorphic wine flask. A large basket contains nine measures of millet grain and a bunch of pheasant feathers; a metal bowl contains eight measures of millet grain and a bunch of porcupine quills in which is embedded a small trident. Further away, directly opposite the priest, is an arch made by bending together two leafy branches of which the bases are fixed into the ground; crosswise, are nine small pieces like rungs on a ladder, from one of which is suspended a cockerel. (2) Recited narratives. These number thirty-three altogether. Their complete narration lasts for about nine hours from start to finish. The following details list the content of each pé in the order of performance.</page><page sequence="4">48 1. Mountain bamboo grows up from the Underworld out into the open; it is cut and used for making a rainshield. 2. Rattan grows up from the Underworld out into the open; it is cut and used for a round tray or basket. 3. The bad dreams of women are about broken weaving rods, those of men are about broken hunting equipment. The wood for making bows emerges from the Underworld out into the open; it is cut and used for a bow. 4. There are certain named places where medicinal herbs can be found and brought down to cure illness. 5. There are certain medicinal herbs, grain offerings and other items used by pojus in rites. 6. The wood for making a partition behind the hearth of a house grows up from the Underworld; it is cut and made into a partition. 7. Trees are felled, debris burned, and millet seed planted. When ripe, the grain is harvested. 8. The youth Leurati refuses to marry any girl suggested by his parents but wishes to marry a fish. He jumps into the river and drowns. 9. Blackbird Kangure and Peacock Tindrupwe go trading. Blackbird sells Peacock for gold, as Peacock cannot understand the foreign traders' languages. (Hence Blackbird has a golden beak). 10. The hunter Pobapodure loses his dog but finds it in the Under world in the care of Moon and Sun. The latter demand a reward in return for having looked after the dog. Pobapodure fails to deliver the promised reward in time, so Moon and Sun snatch away his son. Pobapodure finds a bird which kills Moon and Sun for him. The darkness is disastrous, so another bird is found to bring back the heavenly bodies and all is well in the end. 11. The toad Siljyohle seeks a wife among three sisters. Each girl refuses save the youngest. The toad turns into a man of great wealth. The girl's elder sisters are jealous. They leave her swinging over a river on a swing until she falls in and drowns. 12. A buck and doe are. born, copulate and produce a young deer. The young deer is hunted so that its meat can be offered to the god Pore. 13. Two couples hunt for deer and decide to hold a feast. They need salt, fermenting substance, wine and grain which are produced. They invite the elders to come and drink wine. 14. May the ancestral pojus, from whom present knowledge derives, protect the reciting priest and assist him in his work (Wine is offered to each ancestor as he is named.) 15. Fire emerges from the Underworld; flames fanned are used for cooking. 16. Iron emerges from the Underworld; it is treated at the forge and made into a cooking tripod. 17. Karabare incestuously begets nine sons. His sons try to kill him on a honey collecting expedition but he escapes death. The sons compete among themselves at archery, the winner being</page><page sequence="5">49 intended to have his father's other wife (not his own mother) as his own spouse. Karabare returns secretly and with his own arrow strikes the target. He thus defeats the sons and expels them as demons to dwell about the countryside, each near a different cluster of villages. 18. Two demons attack young children, who try to defeat them. The demons steal the children's souls, whose parents seek a powerful priest named Chyo Poju Tida Poju. The poju successfully retrieves the souls from the demons and invites them to receive offerings demanded in reciprocation. 19. Rangupwe makes tools for cutting wood in order to make a one sided drum. He is frightened by demons near the appropriate tree. A rat deceives him into promising away the village grain in return for being able to cut down the tree. Rangupwe stifles his fear, cuts the tree and makes his drum. 20. Disobedient Leurati refuses to accept his inheritance of priestly wisdom by learning from his father, but goes off to sport with companions. His sister Sirkulami receives the knowledge. The father dies and is buried by the girl. Leurati competes with Sirkulami for the inheritance but the sister wins and kills him, cutting up his body and leaving it with Moon and Sun. Subsequently, she brings him back to life and all is well. 21. Ridsaku commits incest with her brother Myudsaku. They kill themselves by falling down a cliff. 22. Khedapo keeps a pet deer Pusami. He tries to kill Pusami. With the aid of magical instruments given by Khedapo's wife Madapo, Pusami escapes to the forest and hides in the belly of a cow. Khedapo roasts the cow, climbs inside her belly and is defecated over the cliff to his death. 23. A wealthy girl is ill-treated by her maidservant, who is ill-treated by her mistress's parents. The wealthy girl and her husband kill the maidservant by making her fall onto stakes in a pit. 24. The wily rich man deceives the stupid brutish man, so winning meat of a deer, gold and flocks while leaving the stupid man with bones, a dead mother, and finally death by drowning in a river. 25. Shedsaku and Rodsaku go hunting for deer. They seek fire from a witch, who subsequently kills them for trying to deceive her. 26. The poju Apakrolupwedi's pupils spurn him. He departs to the Underworld leaving no protection for the villagers. They are afflicted by demons and ill fortune and seek his return. He comes back, conducts a great rite with the sacrifice of a deer instead of a goat, and all is well again. 27. Pradsihle.'s wife sends him off shepherding in the highlands. He is hurt and no longer loves her. She threatens to curse him if he will not return, for now she misses him. He refuses, is cursed and dies in a landslide.</page><page sequence="6">50 28. The priest Hoso Kroi Poju Le Poju takes the demon Sirapi as a companion deity. The demon has a hairy tongue and will not respond to questions. The poju throws the demon over a cliff down into the river below. The demon rises up to the high mountains, taking away the souls of the priest, and making him ill. The villagers fetch Chyo Poju Tida Poju who agrees to retrieve the soul if the villagers will provide certain types of offerings. Chyo Poju Tida Poju visits the demon, and brings back the souls having secured the demon's agreement to come down to receive offerings. (The performing priest narrates his own metaphysical journey to the demon Sirapi, returning with the soul of the named beneficiary of the rite apparently after securing the agreement of the demon to come down to accept offerings.) 29. All is water in which fishes and frogs play. The water dries away leaving Earth and Sky, the mother and father of Man. The priests, the Lama, the Master guru Rimerache and the Buddhist prayer wheel all come into existence at different places. 30. There are various types of tree which are not used for making the wine flask. Only the kuru-wood will suffice. The flask is made to an anthropomorphic design. 31. Chiefly clansmen agree to intermarry with serving clansmen if the sons of the former pass a test. The sons pass the test, but the chiefly clansmen will permit intermarriage only if the elders of both parties can each build a fire of which the smoke rises straight upwards. The smoke goes drifting. The initial agreement is broken and the clansmen die from wronged feelings. 32. The parents of the bird Aùwokerelurani die, leaving behind only a handful of cold food, ashes and two weaving rods. The bird dies of sorrow. (The performing priest iterates the agreement forged with Sirapi demon until the cockerel suspended from the wooden trellis flaps its wings to indicate the demon's arrival.) 33. The demon of some person who has died before his time has been caught. Now may the demon consume the offerings of sacrifice and depart again I (3) Action. When he recites narrative 18, the priest describes the production of grain and wine and the kinds of animal sacrificed. As he mentions each item, he points to the pertinent object among his paraphernalia in an act of demonstration: thus he enacts to some extent his dialogue with the demons who, in the narrative, request these descriptive accounts. When he recites narrative 21, in which the girl Ridsaku commits suicide, an assistant calls out to the village that all women should stop weaving; the prohibition is lifted as soon as this pê is completed. During the latter part of the performance, villagers may bring bowls of millet, each of which is offered to the demon by the priest and kept by him. Finally, on the arrival of the</page><page sequence="7">51 demon, the cockerel is immediately decapitated and a goat sacrificed so so that the demon will consume the blood offerings. This is the climax of the rite: the measured tempo of the bow string played to accompany the chanting gives way to a rapid tempo while the demon is reminded of the agreement to come down. The priest stares aggressively at the cockerel, leaning forward and chanting with vigour. He has donned a long-tailed woollen cap decked with cowries. The flapping of the fowl is greeted with whistles, a gun shot, the sacrifices, and an extended clashing of cymbals by the priest as he chants again to compel the demon to leave. There are certain other activities which require mention. The priest whispers spells over a brush and two sticks, which an assist ant beats against the windows and doors of the house in order to banish any evil. Names of ancestors, whose funeral rites have been completed, are written on a piece of paper which is placed beneath the upturned basket by the priest. This piece of paper is, at the very end of the rite, fastened to the tip of a tall pole. The ancestors (male and female) have been protected from the demon by the priest's spells, and after the demon has departed this protection is removed: a pot of boiling oil is placed at the bottom of the pole, and when the priest adds a little clarified butter, a pillar of flame rises suddenly and destroys the paper completely. There is then a feast for the local descent group, the household head's wife's brother's family and the officiants. There are some differences between the rite performed for the violently deceased and that performed just for good measure. In particular, at the former occasion a small effigy is made of the deceased; offerings of fine food and wine are presented to it. The effigy is taken away to the west of the village after the cockerel has signalled the arrival of the demon of the dead, and the priest has instructed the deceased about which roads to follow and which to avoid. These features do not occur in the performance held for good fortune. (4) Spells. The priest protects himself and his assistants from the demon. He protects the ancestors of the household. He makes 'pure' the rainshield on which he sits. The present writer was unable to collect any spells from this rite, since they are secret and would</page><page sequence="8">not be divulged. This is unfortunate from an analytical viewpoint because certain pé appear to possess characteristics which ally them with spells. The rest of this paper is intended to illustrate this proposition. IV. The pé in Relation to the Circumstances of the Rite Eleven of the recitations enumerated above recount how people died before their time, so becoming especially harmful demons (numbers: 8,11,17,21,22,23,24,25,27,31,32). In this sense, pe provide illustrative examples of the circumstances under which the rite of Making Meat for the Demon will be performed. Some types of death ante diem are not illustrated in chants, though they would require performance of the rite; for instance, deaths from burning, child birth, or falling from a tree. Moreover, at least some kinds of death which are celebrated in pe appear no longer (were they ever) taken to be sufficient reasons for holding the rite; for instance, death from sorrow (No.32) or wronged feelings (No.31). Kinds of death recited which are among the sufficient grounds for holding the rite include death by drowning (Nos.8,11,24), falling from a cliff (Nos.21,22), being caught in a pit of stakes (perhaps an animal trap?) (No.23), and from the curses of a wife (No.27). Eleven of the remaining chants describe the emergence and treat ment of materials from which items of priestly paraphernalia derive. The following items are concerned: rainshield (No.l), tray or basket (2), bow (3), herbal medicines used as incense (4,5), millet grain (7), fire (15), cooking tripod (16), one-sided drum (19), and anthropomorphic wine flask (30). The eleventh chant which could on formal grounds be included here is No.6 on the manufacture of the wooden partition of a house, but since the rite is conducted outside, on the forecourt of a dwelling, it seems odd to classify this among the poju*s paraphernalia. Certain items of paraphernalia do not receive recognition in chants here, though there are other rites in which this gap is filled; for instance, the cymbals and the cockerel. Some items do not receive such recognition at all, for instance the human thigh-bone trumpet, censer, and trident embedded in porcupine quills. Of the remaining eleven pê , seven can be distinguished from the other twenty-six by the negative criterion of appearing to have</page><page sequence="9">53 no connection with the circumstances, form or purpose of the rite. Instead, they narrate tales like that of the two birds who go trading (No.9), that of the hunter whose son is snatched away by Moon and Sun (No.10), or that of the creation of Earth, Sky and the priests (No.29). Thus it is not necessary that a narrative be related to the context in which it is recited in any straightfoward sense. The remaining four chants are such that they may be called narrative acts: what the priest narrates in Nos.14,18,28 and 33, he is also supposed to accomplish metaphysically by means of his breath (or, on another's interpretation, his soul). As he thanks the ancestors one by one, the priest dabs a little wine in the air for each one named (No.14). As Chyo Poju Tida Poju tells of grain and the victims to be sacrificed during his dialogue with demons, the reciting priest reaches out towards the basket of grain or the cockerel (No.18). In chants 18 and 28, the demons agree to come down to the place of the rite only if certain offerings and paraphernalia are laid out for them. These paraphernalia include meats and grains, feathers, long-tailed woollen hat and a leather belt from which hang bells. All of these items are represented among the priest's paraphernalia. The feature of these two pê linking them with No.14 is the way in which the priest narrates his metaphysical journey to, and negotiations with, the demons so that he accomplishes what he recites in the recitation. Likewise, he thanks the ancestors by saying so; and in No.33, he exhorts the demonic mo to depart with his chanted words. In each case, whether or not there is an accompany ing physical action the narrative act is itself logically complete. Of these four categories of chant analytically distinguished, it is now possible to say that, whatever moral implications might be attributed to them, none of the first three categories can clearly be argued to supply man with "a body of indications and directions for the correct performance of the sacred acts", if these acts are interpreted to be those of the rite concerned.^ However, two pê of the fourth category (Nos.18 and 28) do provide pojus with accounts of events which illustrate Malinowski's view. The demons lay down conditions for their returning of the souls stolen and their willingness to come down to the offerings made by the villagers and priests. These conditions explain for the villager why the ritual is as it appears to be. When the ethnographer</page><page sequence="10">54 observes the rich paraphernalia and wonders why it is as it is, he feels a sense of revelation on understanding the myth which gives reason for the display; and he assumes that the native would feel similarly. Both Malinowski (1936:4) and Lewis (1980:180-71) point to this relation (of action to charter, of token to type); and this is the case with the pe. It should be added, however, that the same items of paraphernalia occur in other rites without similar justifica tion through myth in every case, and that many of the objects displayed in Making Meat for the Demon are recognised only in the chants which describe their emergence and manufacture. There is no justification for the use of these latter items in the sense in which there is for the former category. Hence Malinowski*s view of myth as justifying ritual performance cannot be generalised to all pê. V. The Efficacy of pé The fourth category of chants were distinguished above as 'narrative acts'. In terms of speech-act theory, they possess 'illocutionary force1. As Ahern puts it, In an illocutionary act, one accomplishes something simply by uttering the sentence, without regard to whether or not anyone or anything else is affected, as if one said, 'Please open the door1, and thereby accomplished the act of requesting someone to do something. ... It can be true that I request, promise, thank, or order whether or not my requesting, promising, etc. has any effect at all (1979:8). Ahern characterises two kinds of 'illocutionary act' as follows: An illocutionary act is strong if and only if the speaker regards considerations related to the effect of his act as relevant, intends his act to have certain consequences, and wants what he requests, (ibid:9). In [another] sort of act, which I will call a 'weak' illocutionary act, effects would only be weakly involved: in its most extreme form, the thing wished for would not be believed possible, there would be no agent believed able to bring it about, and the speaker would not intend his wish to bring about any effect. If one or more of these characteristics did not apply in a given case, that case would be correspondingly 'stronger'. We would then have a range of acts, some of which only weakly involve effects and some of which do so in a much stronger way (ibid:10-11).</page><page sequence="11">Strong illocutionary acts are exemplified by requests to gods, for instance in Chinese curing rites. Weak illocutionary acts are the form of expressions of hope and wishes, exemplified by certain types of charm. Ahern's data are principally verbal; and though the same style of analysis can be applied to ritual actions, the present aim is to argue that pé can be characterised in terms of 'weak' and 'strong' illocutionary acts, and to conclude that certain narratives make it difficult to uphold a distinction between mythic discourse and ritual action. The 'strongest' chants are those of the fourth category. Like the Chinese curing rites, the expulsory words of No.33 are intended to have certain consequences in the full sense suggested by Ahern; and the act of expulsion is coterminous with the chant. Similarly, the narrative act of thanking the ancestors by name is represented by No.14, and the request to them for protective assistance is analogously 'strong'. The two other pe in this category pose the problem of the relation between myth and illocutionary act. Not only do they both narrate events that are supposed actually to have taken place in the distant past, they also either replay those events through the narrative (No.18, 28) or contain embedded within the discourse a passage which narrates the accomplishment of essentially the same kind of act (No.28). These chants come very close actually to being ritual action in the literal sense; and indeed the distinction cannot be upheld here. In Stein's terms, this form of pê narrates "un événement unique, archetype que l'homme revit dans le rituel" (1971:504). Although, therefore, they provide some justification for features of the rite discussed earlier in Malinowskian terms, they also define essential parts of the performance. This is also the case with chants which in other rites search for and retrieve the souls of the sick and dead. Ahern states that there can be individual variation among her informants as to whether a given act is intended strongly or weakly (ibid:14). This is also the case with priests' assessments of the efficacy of what they recite. There was disagreement among pojus about whether pé in general were efficacious. One claimed that No.25 would 'stop witches enjoying themselves1 at the expense of their</page><page sequence="12">56 victims, while another would claim that pé were of no practical consequence compared to spells. At this level, the chants can be recited with the 'weakly illocutionary' hope that some good will follow: the intention behind the chant is less explicitly verbalized in the words recited and the nature of the ritual performative act becomes separated from the narrative discourse. In the extreme case, there need by no "thing wished for" which is given expression in words, although the priest may instruct his clients to wish for good fortune in the course of a rite. The logic of illocutionary acts has the practical counterpart in the logic of the 'operative act'. Thus Skorupski suggests that, operative acts effect a change in the pattern of rules by declaring or making it known that there is to be a change: they effect the change they mark (1976:162). He goes on to argue that such a logic can be extended to cover magical acts aimed to affect the natural environment (ibid:168). Some of the physical actions in the Making Meat for the Demon can be understood to follow a similar logic. The small effigy of the dead that is constructed and then thrown away to the West at the end has a parallel in the coming and expulsion of the demon narrated just verbally. One can imagine how each type - the practical and the narrative - might become the other over time and across cultural boundaries. VI. Conclusion This essay began with an attempt to argue that the 'charter' theory of myth finds some support in Gurung ritual chants; that this theory is not, however, generalisable to all cases here; and that certain narratives blur the distinction between mythic discourse and ritual action. Malinowski argued that Since myth does not live by myth alone, but in so far as it influences art and dancing, social organization and economic activities, directly or indirectly through the ritual connected with them, the life of myth is not in its telling, but in the way it is fully enacted in tribal custom and ceremonial (1936:24). Gurung priestly rites are such that there is a clear sense in which 'the life of myth is in its telling' for the very reason that certain pe are not only myths but also (verbally) enacted.</page><page sequence="13">57 Footnotes "''The research on which this study is based was conducted in 1979-81 in Siklis village, Kusia District, West Nepal. 2 The terms denoting the priests are variously transcribed pucu and klihbri (Pignède 1966: index s.v.), pajyu and kheprè (Messerschmidt 1976a: glossary s.v.), pajyu' or pujyu' and khlxyebri or lxebbri (Glover et al. 1977:90b, 46b), as different authors use distinct orthographies in varying dialects. On the distinction between the two types of specialist, compare Rahmann (1959:718 and fn. 103), Elwin (1947:200-01) and Allen (1976:515) for North and Middle Indian tribes and for the Thulung Rai of East Nepal. Since the purposes of this paper are limited, the presence of other officiants, notably village Lamas and wandering popular Hindu specialists, has been for the most part ignored. "^Compare Pignède (1966:323) on the pe-da luh-da. The term pé carries the sense 'example, principle, rule, law' without moral overtones. 4 Though this paper speaks of the 'reciting priest' in the singular, in fact extended rites are usually chanted by at least two, some times as many as four or five, priests performing in unison. This is arguably an important constraint on the variability of individual priest's knowledge and on the variation between distinct performances. ^The diversity of content of pê poses the question of discriminating 'myth' from 'folktale* as Malinowski did for the Trobriand material on indigenous terminological grounds (1936:12-13) and as Kirk has tried to do in terms of literary features (1970:37-41). The present essay passes over this problem. Bibliography Ahern, E.M. 1979. 'The Problem of Efficacy: Strong and Weak Illocutionary Acts' Man n.s. 14:1-17. Allen, N.J. 1976.
