<plain_text><page sequence="1">Jonathan D. Hill Poetic Transformations of Narrative Discourse in an Amazonian Society Recent studies of narrative in lowland South America have demon- strated that indigenous peoples from widely separate regions of the Amazon basin are capable of creatively reformulating their understand- ings of how the social order came into being and how it is situated and transformed, both by themselves and outsiders, in broader historical processes of change (Basso 1985; Chernela 1988; Guss 1986; Hendricks 1988; Hill and Wright 1988; Ireland 1988; Landaburu and Pifieda 1984; Pifieda 1985; Oostra 1988; Reeve 1988; Roe 1988; Turner 1988a, 1988b; Wright and Hill 1986). These studies of narrative construct theoretical approaches to history on the basis of indigenous concepts of power and modes of social consciousness. They have begun to show how indigen- ous peoples have created their own social and historical contradictions and developed collective strategies for impressing these contradictions into consciousness. Narrative discourse is the best place to begin an analysis of indigenous concepts of social agency (see Basso 1985, for example, on the hierarchi- cal levels of "animacy" and corresponding types of sounds embodied in Kalapalo narratives) and mythic and historical modes of social con- sciousness (see Hill, ed., 1988, for examples from several Amazonian and Andean societies). However, mythic and historical modes of social con- sciousness are not only found in narrative genres but are also embodied in closely related genres of poetic, ritual performance as well as in political oratory (see Alcida Ramos's and Terence Turner's analyses of indigenous political speeches to white audiences in Hill, ed., 1988). Indigenous modes of social consciousness are often better revealed through an approach that integrates the study of narrative and "extra- Journal of Folklore Research, Vol. 27, Nos. 1/2, 1990 Copyright Â© 1990 by the Folklore Institute, Indiana University 0737-7037</page><page sequence="2">narrative" (e.g., musical, ceremonial, ritual, and political) genres of discourse rather than a narrow focus on narrative genres alone. To demonstrate this point, I begin with a brief overview of the spatial- temporal transformations of bodily, social, and cosmic processes in the Wakuenai cycle of myths about Amaru and Kuwai, the primordial human mother and son. Next, I provide a glimpse of the ways in which these narrative metaphors are taken up in the poetic language of ritual chanting and singing. Finally, I return to consider how the Wakuenai have used the creative potentials of their myth-music nexus to reformu- late their myth of autochthonous origins so as to accommodate the experience of domination by external, non-native peoples. The transformational space-time of Amairu and Kuwai At the most general level, the Kuwai myth cycle consists of two parts, or stages of creation. Part I of the cycle is concerned with psychosocial processes of development that unfold in parallel with a cumulative series of transformations in the vertical dimension of space-time in human society and the cosmos. This set of myths ends with the fiery death of Kuwai at the first initiation ritual and the contraction of the world back to its former size. Part II of the cycle focuses on the working out of the politics of gender relations in a patrilineal, patrilocal social order and the emergence of a horizontal dimension of exchange between separate peoples and places in the world. Indigenous storytellers describe Kuwai as a monstrous, hairy being whose body consisted of all material elements and whose voice musically created the various species of animals and plants living in the Upper Rio Negro region. In part I of the narrative cycle, bodily processes of giving birth, fasting, vomiting, and eating serve as metaphors for the cumula- tive series of transformations leading from the presocial mythic past to a social world inhabited by fully human beings. The birth of Kuwai was an arduous passage from inside the maternal womb into the external world in which the father (Ifiipirrikuli, the trickster-creator) and father's brothers called upon a series of animal helpers to open up a birth canal. Once outside the womb, the newly born child was immediately removed from the social space of Ifinapirrikuli's village at Hipana to a house in the "corner of the sky" (liwanapu eenu). The father and father's brothers also placed a clay pot over Kuwai's mouth to muffle the sound of his voice. As the child of incestuous, animal-like sexual intercourse between Ifiipir- rikuli and Amaru, Kuwai at birth was a dangerous creature who had to be taken outside and above the world of mythic proto-humans at Hipana and whose voice had to be contained, or socialized. Thus, the initial passage from inside the maternal womb to the external world was paral- 116 Jonathan D. Hill</page><page sequence="3">MYTH, MUSIC, AND HISTORY: POETIC TRANSFORMATIONS leled by the movement of Kuwai from inside to outside social space. The latter movement created a vertically separate "sky-world" (eenu), and the rest of part I of the myth cycle describes the progressive differentiation and mediation of this vertical distance between upper and lower worlds. Movements along the vertical dimension of mythic power metaphori- cally embody the social processes that unfold as individuals move between stages in the life cycle and between generations within the patrilineal descent group.' In essence, the Kuwai myth cycle describes two transformations of body, society, and cosmos leading from the distant, presocial space-time of mythic beginnings at Hipana to the more recent, historical past of human beings in this world. The first transformation is a vertical open- ing up of the cosmos through the musical naming power of Kuwai's voice, or "the powerful sound that opened up the world" (kemakdni hlimeetaka hekwdpi). This raw, monological, musical, life-creating force must be brought down to the ground and inside the social space of the primordial human village at Hipana. Once this transformation has been completed, the life-giving powers of Kuwai are internalized into human social consciousness through Kuwai's teaching of malikai2 songs and chants to Dzuili, the first chant-owner. The completion of the indi- vidual's socialization is overdetermined in myth as the destruction of the child (Kuwai) by the father (Ifiapirrikuli) and father's brothers. After Kuwai has been pushed into a fire, the world contracts, or implodes, to its original, miniature size. The transformational power of Kuwai's fiery death is passed from outside to inside the body through the first initiate's licking hot pepper and eating the sacred food (kdridzdmai). The simul- taneous implosion of the external world of animals, fish, and birds, and internalization of this newly miniature world in the form of karidzamai into the body of the first initiate marks the completion of the series of transformations leading to a reversal of the initial movement from inside-to-outside Amaru's womb. Kuwai's vertical opening up of body, society, and cosmos is now turned upside-down and inside-out. The second transformation of body, society, and cosmos is a horizontal opening up of the world. Kuwai's ashes turn into the plant materials from which men make the sacred flutes and trumpets for kwepani (Kuwai-dance) and for performing the power of ancestral spirits in male and female initiation rituals (wdkapetaka yenpitipe, or "we show our children" and wakaitaka yenpitipe, or "we speak to our children," respectively). These plant materials, and in particular the macanilla palm used to make the resonating chambers of Kuwai's flutes and trumpets, are the starting point of a second creation, or regeneration, of the world. In the myth, Iinapirrikuli orders a squirrel to climb the 117</page><page sequence="4">macanilla palm and mark off sections of different length. The standing palmtree embodies the structure of the cosmos after Kuwai's fiery "death," or transformation: the sky-world of mythic ancestors is both connected to the terrestrial world of humans and animals and insulated, or differen- tiated, through the squirrel's markings. These sections of palmwood will become the flutes and trumpets representing animal species and parts of the body of Kuwai in sacred rites and ceremonies. In this new form, Kuwai is no longer an autonomous, individual being whose voice inde- pendently creates the world, but an assemblage of material objects that must be actively constructed and played by groups of people. In the myth, the completion of Kuwai's transformation from an indi- vidual being into an ensemble of musical instruments comes about when Ifipirrikuli strikes the base of the macanilla palm with a long stick. The palm breaks at each of the places where the squirrel had marked it and falls in a pile of logs.3 Whereas in part I of the myth cycle, Kuwai was a weightless, flying creature who had to be gradually coaxed, or tricked, into coming down to his "death" at Hipana, in part II of the myth cycle Kuwai has weight that can come crashing down upon people below. The downward motion of the macanilla logs in myth turns the first creation of the world, or the coming-into-being of a vertical, hierarchical struc- ture of generations and developmental stages that are poetically mediated by specialists in performances of malikai, inside-out and upside-down. The weight of this power structure comes tumbling down when fiapir- rikuli strikes the base of the macanilla palm with a long stick.4 The horizontal distance between Ifiapirrikuli and the falling logs is the difference between life and death. The regeneration of life through making and playing musical instruments is only possible because Ifiapir- rikuli stays at a safe distance from the falling logs. This horizontal space becomes the prototype of the opening up of a world of socially and geographically separate peoples and places in part II of the myth cycle. At the same time, the vertical dimension of mythic power has been totally inverted, or turned upside-down. The rising and falling of Kuwai in the form of a palm tree replicates in a single episode the entire series of transformations that developed in part I of the myth cycle. The "up- above and outside" is now the "down on the ground and inside," and the transformations of space-time in the second part of the myth cycle outline a process of reversing the initial situation of Kuwai falling down to the ground (in the form of logs) into its opposite, or the final departure of Kuwai from the ground at Hipana up to the "corner of the sky" (liwanapu eenu). The inversion of internal and external space results in a shifting of focus from physiological processes in which foods, bodies, and other substances move across the boundaries of mythic bodies. to Jonathan D. Hill 118</page><page sequence="5">MYTH. MUSIC. AND HISTORY: POETIC TRANSFORMATIONS social processes in which groups of men and women make and play musical instruments while going from one place to another, and, in doing so, create an external world consisting of distinct peoples and places. In other words, the world of Kuwai's first creation has been turned inside-out: internal bodily processes are turned outwards to create an anthropomorphized, musicalized, ritual world of peoples who exchange goods and persons across social boundaries, all within the context of an overarching vertical hierarchy of power relations between mythic ances- tors and human descendants. The clearest examples of this turning inside-out of Kuwai's first crea- tion are the sets of malikai songs and chants performed at male and female puberty initiations. In the opening malikai song for initiation, chant-owners invoke the names of the mythic places where Iinapirrikuli, Kuwai, and Amaru live in the sky and musically bring these mythic beings down into the initiates' sacred food (kdridzdmai) through naming the celestial umbilical cord (hliepule-kwd eenu). Movements between distinct tones, or pitches, within the opening song for initiation are a breakthrough into sung speech that embodies within itself the principle of movements between vertical regions of the cosmos and developmental stages within human society. Midway through the opening song for initiation, the singing transforms into tonally flat, chanted speech. In the long set of chants that follows, chant-owners name all the edible species of plants and animals as they poetically follow Amaru on her mythic journey away from and back to the center of the world at Hipana. A closing song returns to the same pitches used in the opening song to musically create the celestial umbilical cord linking mythic ancestors to the newly regenerated world of human descendants. In these ritual performances, the turning inside-out of Kuwai's first creation is con- cretely embodied in the uses of sung and chanted speech to musically connect the expanding "world-body" to the nurturing, mythic ancestral powers of the sky-world. In part II of the Kuwai myth cycle, the transformation of horizontal space, or the creation of a collectivity of "we people here" who are distinct from "those other peoples there," is depicted as a struggle between men and women. In the context of a patrilineal, patrilocal social world, women are inextricably associated with change and otherness, and gender consciousness becomes the seed of a historical consciousness of changing relations between peoples, or descent groups (ndiki). Amaru and the women take control over Kuwai's flutes and trumpets, but they can do so only by going away from Hipana to other places downstream. The mythic situation of the women is thus analogous to the social situation of newly initiated girls (wilimeru) who are initiated into the 119</page><page sequence="6">Jonathan D. Hill local ancestor cult only to be excluded from it upon reaching full adult- hood and going to live in their husbands' villages. In the final myth of the cycle, Ifiapirrikuli and the men take the flutes and trumpets back from Amaru and the women by knocking them unconscious with a bolt of lightning. Through this imagery, the ambivalent situation of the individual female initiate's simultaneous inclusion in and exclusion from her patrisib is transformed into a collective process of "death," or loss. The individual death, or loss of menstrual blood, by newly initiated girls is ultimately experienced as a collective loss of female blood-kin by wives' kin groups to husbands' kin groups. The myth portrays this collective loss as a simple gender opposition between adult men and women. Analysis, however, reveals that the horizontal dimension of exchange is actually a more complex social confrontation between des- cent groups whose members include both male and female descendants of the local ancestor spirits. In effecting the collective "death" of Amaru and the women and bringing them inside their social world, Ifiapirrikuli and the men have internalized the ambivalent inclusivity/exclusivity of the horizontal dimension of exchange relations between descent groups. The women who are contained inside a ceremonial house by men in kwepani encom- pass both the inclusion of other peoples' female kin and the eventual exclusion of their own people's female kin. By internalizing the simul- taneous gain and loss of female blood relatives through exchange, the men, disguised as animals, embody an alienated consciousness of them- selves as other peoples' others. In the final episode of the myth, Iinapir- rikuli teaches men how to construct the enormous, dzawindpa (jaguar- bone) trumpets of the ancestors, thus allowing men to negate their alienated consciousness of being "other peoples' others" and enabling Kuwai and Amaru to depart for the sky worlds. In the two parts of the Kuwai myth cycle, the Wakuenai construct two contrasting views of their social world and its relations to the inner world of bodily experiences and the outer world of non-human animal nature. The first perspective on human social relations is that of the child's internal, bodily experiences of birth, separation from the parents, and self-empowerment through ritual fasting and eating the sacred food (kdridzdmai). The socialization of individual, bodily processes in child- ren is a process of mediating and constructing a vertical dimension of space-time, or the opening up of a cosmic structure of upper and lower worlds and a power structure of ancestors, ritual specialists, and descend- ants. In this internal view of the social world, the child's experience of socialization is also defined along the vertical dimension of space-time as a movement down from the initially natural status of newly born infant 120</page><page sequence="7">MYTH, MUSIC, AND HISTORY: POETIC TRANSFORMATIONS (kerramu), through the various intermediary transformations of the semi-socialized child (yenpiti), and down to the ground as a fully social- ized, initiated young adult (wiwlitdki, or "newly fasted"). With the eating of fully socialized nature, or the sacred food (kdridzdmai), the child's internal perspective of social reality has reached completion, and not a single reference to the first initiate is made throughout the entire second part of the narrative cycle. The social processes of exchange, or inclusion and exclusion, that open up along the horizontal dimension of space-time in part II of the Kuwai myth cycle are inherently collective processes of integration and separation among peoples, or descent groups, from different places. They cannot be reduced as in part I to the level of the individual's socialization. The disappearance of Herri, the first socialized individual, from the sequence of narratives in part II of the myth cycle concretely expresses the irrelevance of the individual level of experience for the development of collective institutions, such as bride service, exogamy, and patrilocal residence. As Turner noted in his analysis of a Kayapo creation myth, the story of the proto-human individual's socialization implies that there must be another story about the coming-into-being of the family structures into which the individual has been socialized: " . . . namely, how the collective form of human society arose from the disper- sal of an individual domestic family, and how the collective institutions in turn established the pattern for the reproduction of all future families" (1985:95). For the Wakuenai, part II of the Kuwai myth cycle answers these questions by showing how the individual experiences of young, newly initiated men and women are transformed into collective processes of inclusion and exclusion among a plurality of intermarrying descent groups, or peoples. Part II of the myth cycle demonstrates how a single descent group was opened up to produce a world consisting of a collectiv- ity of "we people here" and a contrasting plurality of social others, or "those peoples there." In doing so, the second part of the Kuwai myth cycle also establishes the pattern for reproducing the plurality of social others through the negation of a people's alienated consciousness of themselves as "other peoples' others." The child's internal view of social reality as a process of becoming human and the adult's external view of it as the collective reproduction of descent groups form two contrasting perspectives that are defined relative to one another in the Kuwai myth cycle and yet cannot be reduced to mere reflections of each other. In the final analysis, to control social reproduc- tion, or the formation of descent groups through exogamous exchanges of male labor and female blood relatives, is a more dynamic and powerful process than the intra-descent group process of the individual's socializa- 121</page><page sequence="8">tion. However, these two hierarchical levels of power relations are mutu- ally defining, since the more dynamic processes of social reproduction embodied in part II of the narrative cycle are themselves a product of the transformation, through turning upside-down and inside-out, of the socialization of Kuwai and the first initiate in part I of the myth cycle. This double perspective upon Kuwai's two openings of the world consti- tutes the highest level of mythic meaning, or the symbolic mediation of the social contradiction between the individual's socialization and the collective reproduction of descent groups. The poetics of ritual power Before going on to discuss the mediation of temporal relations in malikai, it is important to reiterate that spatial movement, or expansion, is basic to the nature of Wakuenai ways of thinking about the past. The spatial movements of Kuwai and Amaru in the primordial human past are not described as mere journeys between places that already exist but as a dynamic process of creating spatial distances between places. The narratives do not arrange the space inhabited by the Wakuenai phratries of the Isana and Guainia rivers into a "mythic timeless order"; rather, they describe that space as a dynamic, temporal process in which an earlier, space-less time preceded the growth of the world in primordial human times. The transformational space-time of Kuwai and Amaru separates the mythical Beginning at Hipana from the human past, resulting in a tripartite temporal framework, which is in turn matched by a tripartite division of the cosmos into the world of living human beings (hekwapiriko), the dark netherworld (iyaruddti) of recently-deceased per- sons (liddnam, or "shadows"), and the celestial paradise (likaremi) of Ifiapirrikuli. Thus, when the Wakuenai speak about earlier and later past times, they are also speaking about places and spatial movements. Conversely, the way in which the Wakuenai speak about and enact past times is most often accomplished through metaphors of place and spatial movement. Wakuenai ritual language (malikai) differs from the dialects of every- day speech in several important ways. Although all native speakers can recognize the literal meanings of many words in malikai, only the specialists, called malikai liminali (malikai "owners," or chant-owners), know all the nuances and allusions to narrative episodes condensed into the spirit-names of Kuwai. The activity of performing malikai is called inyapakaati and refers minimally to a voiced, aspirated exhalation of the breath made visible by tobacco smoke (see Hill 1985). Spirit-naming in malikai is thus more than a simple verbal act and entails the audible, visible releasing of spirit-names as musical tones. In talking about mali- 122 Jonathan D. Hill</page><page sequence="9">MYTH, MUSIC, AND HISTORY: POETIC TRANSFORMATIONS kai, chant-owners have little more to say about these musical sounds than that they are kemakani hlimeetaka hekwapi. In contrast, they are extreme- ly articulate in speaking about the language of malikai (i.e., the spirit- names themselves). Basically, all spirit-names in malikai have two parts, or identities, one generic and the other specific. The double identity of beings named in malikai has its origins in the primordial human being, Kuwai, who describes himself in narratives as "all things in this world" (phiutmi hekwapirzko). In linguistic terms, malikai contains a system of generic classifiers in which each specific object, species, or person is categorized in one or more generic noun class. The principle of generic classification is capa- ble of expressing profoundly contradictory images of the mythical figure of Kuwai. On the one hand, the chant-owner can enact Kuwai's vertical creation of the world by placing emphasis on generic categories which include many distinct individuals, species, and objects into a single compound entity. This process, called "heaping up the names in one single place" (waketaka nakuina papz'nirztsa), is a relatively simple tech- nique of naming a generic class of spirits and then filling it up (wakam- taka nakutna) with specific names. On the other hand, the chant-owner can juxtapose a variety of different generic names, each with a comple- mentary, specific name, to enact Kuwai's second, horizontal creation of the world. The result of this process, called "chasing after the names" (wdpinetaka watsani nakuna), or "going in search of the names" (wdpi- netaka wadzuhiakdw nakuna), is a dynamic montage of unique meta- phors highlighting the uniqueness of specific spirit-names which ex- clude all but a single individual, species, or object on the basis of distinctive qualities. In childbirth rituals, for example, the chant-owner uses a variety of auditory, tactile, and visual imagery in searching for the tobacco spirits of a newborn infant's mythic ancestors. The spirit-names connect the everyday world of tools, weapons, and objects of the father's work activi- ties to the hyperactive, undifferentiated musical naming power of Kuwai, or "the powerful sound that opened up the world." The spirit-name for pwaapwa, a palmwood species that men use for weaving baskets and other products, is limutukeku eenu, or "the ripping sound of the sky," referring to the ripping, tearing sound produced when the outer bark of the tree is peeled off to make thin strips of weaving material. Eenu means "sky" in everyday speech, but in malikai chants eenu is a category of spirit-names that includes various species of wild palms that are sources of useful material and/or edible fruits. Palm trees have a broader mythic significance as the reincarnation of Kuwai after his fiery "death." As the vertical pathway between the celestial world of mythic ancestors and the 123</page><page sequence="10">social world of human descendants on the ground, palm trees form a cosmic umbilical cord that nourishes humanity with life-giving ances- tral powers. This connotation of the term eenu is expressed in the spirit-naming of pwaapwa palms which, like other important species or objects, receives more than one spirit-name in malikai. Wadewatsa liatkan, likaiteri limutukeku eenu, So that no harm is done, the name of the ripping-sound sky-spirit is spoken, Likaiteri lztiekutka eenu, The name of the cutting smooth sky-spirit is spoken, Likapani hliepulepukuike eenu, The navel of the sky, the manioc sieve, is looked upon, Wadewatsa linakuka likanupa limidzdka ikerramulena, So that no harm is done to the newborn infant, Nuawa lidakiwa manupanam dzeema. I give for his body that-has-no-danger tobacco. Like the spirit-names for sharp, cutting tools, the second spirit-name for pwaapwa, litiekuika eenu, associates the smooth, thin strips of weaving material with cutting and loss of blood. The third name relates pwaapwa, the material for making manioc sieves, to an anthropomorphic image of the cosmos as a "body" linked to the celestial world of ancestor spirits through a "navel" at the center of the world, or Hipana. Thus, in the space of one short stanza, the chant-owner synaesthetically interweaves auditory, tactile, and visual images of mythic power to verbally construct the pwaapwa palm as a ripping-sound, cutting-smooth, cosmic navel of the human universe. The two processes of spirit-naming in malikai, "heaping up" and "searching for the names," are semantic expressions of a relative hier- archy of structural levels that pervades Wakuenai sacred myths and rituals. "Heaping up the names," or categorizing specific objects, spe- cies, and individuals into generic classes, is a taxonomic principle which defines a lower-level pattern of relations. "Heaping up the names" is a classificatory operation in which the natural, social, and mythical worlds are organized into relatively discrete, bounded semantic classes, each of which is analogously constituted with all the other classes through the generic-to-specific relationship. The more dynamic process of "searching for the names" operates against the relatively static taxo- nomic principle of "heaping up the names" into discrete categories. 124 Jonathan D. Hill</page><page sequence="11">MYTH, MUSIC, AND HISTORY: POETIC TRANSFORMATIONS "Searching for the names" is essentially a process of transferring spirit- names which are exceptionally powerful or harmful from the generic class to which they would belong according to the lower-level, taxo- nomic principle into a different class of names on the basis of mythical connections. For example, in the process of "heaping up" the spirit- names of edible bird species for the food of a newborn infant's parents, the chant-owner names the yellow curassow in the class of umdwari, or fish and aquatic animal species. The reason for this shifting of a bird species to the class of aquatic species is that in myth the yellow curassow transforms itself into an anaconda. The higher-level process of "search- ing for the names" is thus a mythic principle of semantic transferral which overrides the lower-level, taxonomic principle of "heaping up the names."5 In any given performance of malikai, chant-owners make use of both taxonomic and mythic principles, but one or the other of the two princi- ples is dominant. The relation between higher- and lower-levels is not an absolute opposition between dynamic and static but a relative contrast of more to less dynamic. "Searching for the names" is a semantic expression of transcendence through which processes of change, reordering, and transformation are given symbolic form. "Heaping up the names" is an expression of the basic order from which meaningful change and trans- formation arise (see Hill 1985 for a more detailed account of these naming processes and their projection into musical processes). The poetic transformation of narrative discourse The hierarchy of mythic and taxonomic principles enacted in malikai and the transformational space-time described in narratives about the primordial human past of Kuwai and Amaru have become a basis for interpreting the history of Indian-white relations. As a mode of historical consciousness, Wakuenai ritual language and narratives do not form an atemporal structure of "conventional meanings" that absorbs or freezes the events of Indian-white history into a "mythic timeless order." The Wakuenai do not see themselves as the passive reactors to events initiated by the whites or as recipients of the whites' culture. Instead, the white men and their culture are classified through the taxonomic principle of ritual language so that they can be understood in relation to the more dynamic mythic principle of "searching for the names." In what amounts to nearly a reversal of the "cold" versus "hot" society distinction in structuralist anthropology (Levi-Strauss 1962), the Wakuenai inter- pret the white men as a "heaped up pile of souls" who are less dynamic (though not totally static) than the Wakuenai and neighboring indigen- ous societies of the Northwest Amazon region, who possess powerful sib 125</page><page sequence="12">names, or souls, which must be "searched for" anew in each generation. Through the complex of narratives and ritual language outlined above, the Wakuenai view themselves as the principal makers and keepers of a sacred regional history, which subsumes the origins of the white men and their culture in the Upper Rio Negro region. The following version of the myth of sib ancestor emergence comes from a Dzawinai chant-owner of the lower Guainia river in Venezuela (Hill, field notes). The bulk of his narrative consists of a simple listing of Wakuenai sib names and their corresponding male and female tobacco spirits. Excluding the list of names in "brackets," the narrative is reduci- ble to the following underlying sequence of actions: 1. The white men were the first people to emerge from the hole beneath the rapids at Hipana, and Iinapirrikuli gave them all a single name (yarinarinai) and tobacco spirit (Herri halepiwanai ienipe). "Later we will go to search for the names (naniiiika) of these people," explained the trickster-creator. 2. Ifiapirrikuli searched for the names of all the Wakuenai sibs and gave them each a pair of tobacco spirits. 3. After giving names and spirits to all the Wakuenai sibs of the Isana and Guainia rivers, Ifiapirrikuli continued to search for the names of Arawakan and Tukanoan groups of the Vaupes (Tariano, Uanano, and Cubeo). Although these groups formed part of the same search for sib names by Ifiapirrikuli, they are distinguished from Wakuenai sibs by the phrase "after the white men" (hnetedali ydriznrini). 4. fiiapirrikuli ran out of names, for "there were too many people" (neni netim yuihakawa). "Let's heap up these people and give them the spirit-name liwaketanhim dzdwinaipirrikuli (the heap or pile of Ifiipirrikuli)." Iiapirrikuli gave the white men the name ydirinai- rindi, and he named the places where they were to live Colombia, Venezuela, and Brazil. In this narrative, the relative hierarchy of semantic principles in malikai becomes a means for giving cultural form to an indigenous interpreta- tion of the history of Indian-white relations in the Upper Rio Negro region. The arrival of the white men is not expressed as a passive expe- rience that "happened to" the Wakuenai but as part of the same active process through which Ifiapirrikuli, the trickster-creator, brought into being the ancestral spirits of the Wakuenai. The trickster-creator raised the white men's ancestors from the ground at Hipana before raising the sib ancestors of the Wakuenai and other indigenous groups, but he did Jonathan D. Hill 126</page><page sequence="13">MYTH, MUSIC, AND HISTORY: POETIC TRANSFORMATIONS not give the white men powerful sib names that must be actively "searched for." fiiapirrikuli announced his intention to search for the sib names of the white men later, after searching for those of the Wakuenai and their neighbors. As is so often the case in narratives about Iinapir- rikuli, the trickster-creator's words and deeds are in the final analysis shown to be clever deceptions which must be interpreted rather than taken at face value. In the final episode of the narrative, when Iinapir- rikuli has run out of names because the white men were too numerous, the real intentions of the trickster-creator are revealed: to heap up the white men as liwaketanhim (heap or pile) rather than to search for their sib names (nandikika). This denouement makes explicit the contrast between higher- and lower-level naming principles and the analogous contrast between indigenous peoples (hwa nawiki) and the white men (yindrindi). The contrast is not a simple binary opposition of the Levi- Straussian sort (i.e., Indian: white :: dynamic: static) but a continuum of more-to-less dynamic. In the concluding episode of the narrative, Ifiapirrikuli runs out of names because there are "too many people," and he names the places where the white men are to live: Colombia, Venezuela, and Brazil. The indigenous view of history presupposes smallness of social scale, but not rigidity. Sib names for several indigenous societies of the Upper Rio Negro region are added to Inapirrikuli's search "after the white men," but the white men themselves are simply too numerous to include into this mythical process. The trickster-creator does, however, name the places where the white men are to live. Given the central importance of spatial movements and the naming of places in Wakuenai ways of thinking about the past, Inaipirrikuli's naming of white men's places is better understood as a metaphor of the active creation of an historical space-time which the Wakuenai have shared with the white men for the past 250 years rather than a static, atemporal arrangement of space into a mythic order. The division of Wakuenai ancestral lands among Brazil, Colombia, and Venezuela was an historical process of great significance to the Wakuenai, for the spatial movements back and forth between river systems has been a key strategy for coping with the white men's diseases, economic oppression, military force, and missionary activity. Whereas the Wakuenai understand their history as a balanced relation between the rivers and forests which they inhabit today and the dynamic transforma- tions of the closed world of the mythical Beginning at Hipana during the primordial human past of Kuwai and Amaru, the white men have struggled since the time of their arrival in the eighteenth century to divide the Upper Rio Negro region into separate administrative spheres of control. For the Wakuenai, it is the white men and not indigenous 127</page><page sequence="14">peoples who have treated their territory and its inhabitants as cold, ahis- torical, and lifeless abstractions open to instrumental manipulations. Conclusions In transforming their narrative of collective, mythic origin from the ground at Hipana, the Wakuenai have taken the poetic mediation of the contradiction between vertical (developmental-generational) and hori- zontal (political-historical) dimensions of space-time from the ritual language of malikai songs and chants and integrated it into a narrative discourse that comments upon and socializes the macabre history of interethnic relations in the Upper Rio Negro region. The whites are simultaneously included and excluded into the bodily, social, and cos- mic worlds created by Kuwai. Whereas the final narrative of the Kuwai myth cycle is about the negation of a people's alienated consciousness of being "other peoples' others," the transformed version of the myth of autochthonous origins is concerned with negating the alienated con- sciousness of the Wakuenai as being "the whites' others," or unwilling, coerced victims of political-economic domination and the culture of terror during the rubber boom and earlier, colonial periods (see Wright 1981; Wright and Hill 1986; Hill and Wright 1988). The dynamic interrelations between mythic discourse and ritual per- formances of the Wakuenai have far-reaching implications for contex- tual studies of indigenous South American discourse. The gap separat- ing mythic discourse from ritual performance allows room for creativity, improvisation, and the emergence of novel interpretations as well as for the passing down of knowledge from ancestors to descendants. The metaphorical processes of mythic discourse do not exist as a frozen stockpile of concepts forming a rigid, logical order but are actively put to the service of collective thought and action in narrative performances that are themselves socially situated, sensuous expressions of verbal artistry. Moreover, these narrative constructions of mythic creation can stimulate the search for new metaphorical relations in nature, society, and history through asserting the primacy of dynamic transformations over categories or states of being. For Wakuenai chant-owners, the twin processes of "heaping up" and "searching for" spirit-names are poetic tools for exploring the diversity of natural species and social beings as a mythic palette of colors, shapes, sounds, textures, temperatures, and emotions. "Searching for the names" is a concrete expression of the musicality of spoken and chanted speech and a virtuoso display of poetic creativity. "Heaping up the names" gives poetic form to the classificatory power of mythic speech, its capacity to facilitate the arts of memory and the continuous passing down of power- 128 Jonathan D.

Historical interpretation emerges from the interplay between poetic creativity and mythic imagi- nation, between "searching for the names" across the cultural landscape and "heaping up the names" in a single place. Southern Illinois University Carbondale NOTES Field research with the Wakuenai of Venezuela in 1980-81 was supported by doctoral grants from the Social Science Research Council and the Fulbright-Hays Doctoral Dissertation Abroad Program. In summers of 1984 and 1985, I returned to the Venezuela Amazon Territory to conduct research supported by the Fulbright-Hays Faculty Research Abroad Program. I wish to thank Robin Wright and Terence Turner for their contributions to my developing understand- ing of Wakuenai history and the complex ritual and narrative genres through which the Wakuenai construct a meaningful present. Finally, I am deeply grate- ful to the Department of Anthropology, Smithsonian Institution for offering me a research fellowship that has provided me with the time for pulling together the diverse strands of my ethnographic and historical knowledge of the Wakuenai. 1. This analysis of vertical mythic space as a metaphor for specific types of social time builds upon Turner's pathbreaking study (1985) of a Kayapo creation myth. 2. Mdlikai is a complex genre of spoken, chanted, and sung speech performed only by specialists, called mdlikai liminali (chant-owners) during rites of pas- sage, curing rituals, and a variety of less formal contexts. For a detailed analysis of the two sets of malikai chants performed in childbirth rituals, see Hill (1985). 3. This is yet another of Kuwai's unsuccessful attempts to kill Iinapirrikuli. The trickster theme continues throughout the Kuwai myth cycle just as it does in myths about the primordial past and more recent, shamanistic times. 4. The chopping down of macanilla and other palms to make instruments and harvest wild fruits is the first activity of all sacred rites and ceremonies. 5. I worked primarily with a chant-owner from the Dzawinai phratry and have little comparative data for determining how much variation exists between the metaphors employed by different specialists. Listening to tapes of a chant- owner from the Hoh6deni phratry in Brazil has revealed that the same principles of naming are employed in widely separate areas of Wakuenai territory. Much like the Kuna chiefly chanters described by Sherzer (1983), Wakuenai chant- owners' reputation and prestige is partially based on their abilities to create and use multivocal metaphors. 129</page><page sequence="16">Jonathan D.
