<plain_text><page sequence="1">Voice as Fossil Madame de StaeFs Corinne or Italy: An Archaeology of Feminine Discourse Marie-Claire Vallois Miami University, Ohio When asked what he thought of Mme. de Stael's latest novel, Delphine, Talleyrand's witty remark, "I have heard that in her novel, Mme. de Stael depicted us both disguised as women," was to become famous.1 This bitter jest from a wounded ex-lover evokes, in a few words, the entire mentality of the period, while emphasizing its prejudices. Talleyrand gets even for being feminized by accusing the woman writer of actually being a man. These words constitute one of the first accusations with which Germaine de Stael would be frequently stigmatized: the scandal of "gynandry," or androgyny. If we were to leaf through the stacks of literary criticism concerning Stael, we would read over and over again this same rebuke. This reproach was echoed by another passionate enemy, the Emperor Napoleon, for whom Stael's "monstrosity" consisted in being a "female ideologist."2 She incarnated a semantic combination of terms that, according to the new Civil Code, were to be naturally opposed. In the post-revolutionary society that was emerging, Stael, as a woman, played a bit too free with words, scrambled letters just a bit too much by ironically entitling herself a "female author" ("auteur femelle") and laughing about it.3 In the preface to the work of criticism that swept her, in spite of herself, into a literary career?Les kttres sur Rousseau?Germaine de Stael herself agreed that she would have been content if "someone else had described what [she] felt." Entering the Republic of Letters with a critical treatise rather than a typical work of woman's fiction demanded an apology. None? theless, she did not conceal the enjoyment that this transgression provided: "but I delighted in the pleasure of recounting this memory and this feeling of enthusiasm to myself."4 This double declaration?both the denial and the affirmation of her talent as a writer?is accomplished by the contradictory inscription of the prohibition against female writing. This dramatic demon? stration of writing's duplicity makes us think, by analogy, of the symptom of hysteria identifiable in the gesture of Freud's patient who, "keeping (as a woman) her dress held tightly to her body, with the other hand struggles to 47</page><page sequence="2">tear it off (as a man)."5 In this provocative spectacle, a woman exhibits what it is proper to conceal, the play of her bisexuality. Criticism has not always been so hostile to the Staelian phenomenon. The reevaluation of Stael, starting at the end of the nineteenth century, obviously must be set in the context of the more general revival of the Romantics. But even in this context the case of Germaine de Stael cannot fail to strike us by its very ex-centricity. She is celebrated not only as one of the Muses of the Romantics, but also as one of their main theoreticians (Des Passions, De la litterature, De I'Allemagne), as well as a novelist (Delphine, Corinne ou I'ltalie). Nonetheless, the numerous biographies of Stael appear? ing during this period, while giving her credit for her eclecticism and for initiating this renewal of interest, also betray a strategic shift of critical perspective whose consequences for a woman of letters must be evaluated. This new perspective transforms the author-writer into a "voice." The shift of perspective will be used, as we will see, simultaneously as praise and as dismissal. This should not obfuscate, however, the fact that Stael's writings by their ex-centric specificity force the invention of a new critical category in itself: the category of the "author's voice," which should not be mistaken for the first person of narration. In reading the biographies of Germaine de Stael one cannot help but be struck by how insistently all these critics testify to their constant impression of not only seeing her again, but, particularly, of hearing her. Sainte-Beuve is the first to launch these archaeological expedi? tions in search of a voice, in pursuit of something dead, lost forever, yet feebly echoed in the writings.6 As an example, we note that Pierre Kohler con? cludes his biographical study thus: elle a mis le meilleur de son esprit et de son art dans ses paroles envolees. Ecrivant, elle causait encore....7 (she put what was best in her spirit and in her art into these vanished words. Writing, she went on conversing-) In the tradition of literary criticism classified under the rubric "Life and Works," this sort of commentary tends to "de-scribe" the difference between the sexes, while at the same time re-inscribing it, though more discreetly. A woman does not write; she converses, she chatters. Yet this partisan and reductive attitude of criticism indicates an especially troubling insistence. Why does it seem important in the case of Germaine de Stael to go back to the "living source," to the origin of the text, a text that seems to be only the lifeless remains of a voice whose strange charm echoes from beyond the grave? It is precisely this hollow echo that all those explorers into literary necromancy claim to bring back from their voyage. But is this expedition not 48</page><page sequence="3">doomed in advance to failure? Stael, as we know, almost never uses the voice of autobiography: she rarely writes "I." In De I'Allemagne, she explains this withdrawal of a personal voice: Les femmes cherchent a s'arranger comme un roman, et les hommes comme une histoire.8 (Women tend to veil themselves in the cloak of fiction, men in the cloak of history) Women disguise themselves in fiction or romance while men expose them? selves in memoirs and autobiographies. The apparent inevitability of this sexual segregation of the genders should not obscure in the female author the strange process of repression and displacement that it implies. Twenty-six years later, composing a second preface to her first writing, Les Lettres sur Rousseau, Germaine de Stael reflected on the extraordinary condition of the Woman of Letters. She consoled herself for the excessiveness of her talents with the thought that no one can blame heaven for having been given "an extra faculty."9 Certainly it is something extra that the woman author enjoys; writing springs from an excess, a supplementary experience, as Germaine de Stael said in speaking of the novel.10 This personal logic of the supplement was to shape her theory of the novel in an original manner. It is therefore proper for the female author (our literary hysteric) to cloak herself in fiction, but should we understand this disguise in the sense of dressing and attiring oneself with jewels to cover something that one does not have, or is it covertly robbing, concealing, and disrobing this monstrous extra that only fiction could enrobe and recount? Fiction and woman in this sense would go together, not according to the restricted economy of the literary institution, but according to an unthinking expenditure and excess. Our hysteric is a creature with not one sex but two; from the beginning she represents the problematic mystery of all feminine identity. And this mys? tery can only be written as fiction. Unlike her masculine contemporaries?Goethe, Chateaubriand or Stendhal?Germaine de Stael would never recount "her story" or that of her heroines through the mirror reflection of a first-person narration. Her memoirs, Dix Annees d'exil, which are not autobiographical, remained frag? mentary and unfinished, as did the diary of her youth: Je voulais faire entierement le journal de mon coeur, j'en ai dechire quelques feuillets.... D'ailleurs malheur a celui qui peut tout exprimer, malheur a celui qui peut supporter la lecture de ses sentiments affaiblis.11 49</page><page sequence="4">(I wanted to make a complete journal of my heart, I tore out some of its pages.... Besides, damn the person who can say everything, damn the person who can put up with reading these faded feelings.) In these few lines Alain Girard sees the rejection of the intimate auto? biographical project (J.I., 74). In fact, it does seem difficult for Germaine de Stael to submit herself to the legality of the identification ritual: "I, the undersigned, Louise, Germaine de Stael, do hereby testify...." Her refusal of confidential discourse is not so much motivated by a feeling of embarrass? ment for her real feelings as it is by their inscription. Pour moi cependant, je ne rougis pas de mon coeur et seule dans le silence des passions, je le sens sous ma main, battre encore pour l'honneur et la vertu. (J.I.,76) (As for me, I was not ashamed of my heart and all alone in the silence of passions, I felt it beneath my hand still beating for honor and virtue.) What is wrong is shifted from the level of feelings and fixed at the level of the language expressing them. The mutilation and abrupt interruption of the diary thus acquires symbolic value. Autobiographical writing registers a split between the "I" who writes and the Me reader-receptor?the split, the phenomenon of double consciousness identified by Freud as "hypnotic states" characteristic of hysteria.12 It is thus not a coincidence that the names of the two Staelian heroines, Delphine and Corinne?the sibyl?evoke, with their mythological connotations, the image of an inspired woman, one possessed, one other people might call hysterical.13 Oracular women, receptacles for divine voices or inhabited by external voices, become allegories for the Staelian feminocentric novel. The woman author is no more able to speak in her own name than Delphine or Corinne are able to tell their own story. And yet she speaks, but without ever putting herself into the position of being interpellated exclusively as a "female subject," as the subjected subject of gender ideology.14 Germaine de Stael escapes the trap of autobiography, the ritual of confidence and penitence performed by an "I," which imprisons once and for all?the trap of the "I" that could only repeat, as Napoleon would have it, that anatomy is destiny.15 Rejecting both the repressive practice of personal and fictional auto? biography, Germaine de Stael wrote her most famous novel, Corinne ou I'ltalie, in the third person and as a curious mixture of romance and trav? elogue. Corinne ou I'ltalie, in spite of its woman-centered title, presents us, at least at the outset, with the parallel story of two heroes: a male hero, Oswald, Lord Nelvil, heir to a great Scottish name, the stereotype of the English 50</page><page sequence="5">romantic hero, and Corinne the female hero, a poet who lives in Italy but whose real name and birth remain secret until the middle of the book. After a long and risky journey through Europe, Oswald arrives in Italy where his doctors advised him to go to restore his health and cure the melancholy caused by the death of his father. Once in Rome he is immediately distracted from his sorrows by the celebration of a woman poet, Corinne, the famous "improvisatrice," who is to be crowned at the Capitol. He is seduced by Corinne's beauty and talents but more particularly by the quality of her voice: he falls in love with her. Corinne offers to show him Rome and falls in love with him. The antique palaces and ruins of Rome and then Naples constitute the romantic, haunting, and ensnaring decor of the love story. Corinne, who is acting as Oswald's private guide to Italy and Italy's spokeswoman, soon lets the ruins speak for her. The story could have concluded with a happy ending if only the female heroine could have continued talking about Italy and kept her own story secret. But once in Naples surrounded by the fumes of the erupting Vesuvius and on their way to the archaeological site of the vanished city of Pompeii, Oswald narrates the story of a past love with a Frenchwoman that, according to him, killed his father. Corinne then cannot help but reveal her own secret childhood story, a story that strangely echoes Lord Nelvil's. She, too, exiled herself in Italy after her father's death. She, too, like Oswald, was guilty of transgressing the father's law. The two heroes have a common past: they lived in the same country; their fathers were close friends and even wanted to marry them when they were still children. But Oswald's father changed his mind when he saw and heard Corinne. This piece of censured familial memory that uncovers their similarities will at the very moment of revelation separate them tragically. For if both heroes have transgressed the father's law, only Corinne remains convinced of the necessity of such a transgression. It is the very inscription of such a story, the female version of the oedipal moment, that will ruin the Roman idyll from then on. Only the pretext of ending the tour of Italy can keep the lovers together. The woman-story then must continue to be censured, and it is replaced by an Italy-story travelogue. This displacement must be analyzed more closely. Until the end of the nineteenth century the Bibliotheque Nationale classified Corinne ou I'ltalie as a travel guide.16 This constitutes an ex- centricity or de-centering of the romantic subject, of which the female author was fully aware right from the start. J'ecrirai une espece de roman qui serve de cadre au voyage d'ltalie.17 (I shall write a sort of novel that will serve as a frame for a trip to Italy.) 51</page><page sequence="6">In a curious reversal of the classical hierarchy, the trip to Italy is presented as the privileged subject of fictional writing?the personal fiction serving only as a frame. This displacement of the fictional subject is disturbing because it questions the anthropomorphic hierarchy that is traditional in western fictional writing, where a thing, an inanimate object, cannot take the place of a person (except in the fantastic genre, where the passage from one kingdom to another?inanimate to animate?is the rule).18 Does that mean that Germaine de Stael's novel should be read under the rubric of fantasy? At first glance, lacking any commentary from the author, nothing would seem to authorize us to do so, unless perhaps it is the figure of the double?person or country?so oddly emblematized in the novel's title, Corinne ou I'ltalie. Germaine de Stael, in fact, titled her second novel, as she had her novellas and Delphine, with a feminine first name without a patronym. Unlike the other novels, the erasure of the father's name is here compensated by the vague indication of a place name: Corinne or Italy. This substitution of toponym for patronym cannot help but be problematic for the reader. Is the loss of the paternal reference redeemed by the place name Italy, which, bound to the first name by the copula "or" is, in fact, inscribed as another enigma? A real literary sphinx, does not this fictional entitling speak to the reader with stone words in a landscape of ruins all the better to evoke a woman's secret? From the beginning this riddle seems open to a double solution: one a metonymic performance, Corinne in Italy; the other a metaphoric description, either Corinne or else Italy. The second possible way of reading?Italy as the metaphorical double of the heroine?is quick to present itself to the traveling hero. In Italy Oswald discovers a mysterious woman; while she reveals Italy to him, he sets out on the quest of loving and knowing her. This romantic key, moreover, was suggested to him by Corinne's attendant and confidant, the Prince de Castel-Forte: "Regardez-la, c'est l'image de notre belle Italie"19 (Look at her, she is the picture of our beautiful Italy). A mysterious key nonetheless, for it is not granted to everyone to understand it, since, as the Prince de Castel- Forte says, Corinne is someone "dont il est impossible d'avoir l'idee quand on ne l'a pas entendue" (II, 2,665); (whom it is impossible to imagine when one has not heard her). The word "heard" (entendue) must be taken here in its double sense: in the sense of hearing, but also of interpreting and deciphering. It is a question of reading Corinne's story in that of Italy. There has been a substitution of stories through a delegation of discourse: for Corinne's personal discourse, an autobiographical discourse, is substituted the tourist discourse on which the subsequent delegation of speech depends. In the Italian descriptions, it is no longer the heroine but the "monuments qui parlent a l'ame par une veritable 52</page><page sequence="7">grandeur" (IV, 3, 680); (monuments who speak to the soul with their true grandeur). The heroine's lost voice is inscribed in her stone double: a fossil voice ready to live. The Corinne-monument substitution, moreover, is poetically implicit from the moment of Corinne's first appearance at the Capitol. Does the narrative describe a stone figure carved in an ancient bas relief or a being of flesh and blood? Corinne etait assise sur ce char construit a Fantique.... Ses bras etaient d'une eclatante beaute; sa taille grande, mais un peu forte, a la maniere des statues grecques. (II, 1, 662-63) (Corinne was seated on this chariot built in the ancient style.... Her arms were radiantly beautiful; her stature tall, but somewhat heavy, in the manner of Greek statues.) Half-goddess, half-woman, the statue nevertheless begins to live beneath the admiring and loving gaze: elle donnait a la fois l'idee d'une pretresse d'Apollon, qui s'avancait vers le temple du Soleil, et d'une femme parfaitement simple. (II, 1, 663) (She made one think of a priestess of Apollo coming towards the temple of the Sun, and, at the same time, of a perfectly simple woman.) The tourist trip is thus transformed into an idyll. The statue becomes a woman?a commonplace of that period's literature, some of whose veils Freud lifted in his reading of Jensen's Gradiva.20 The obvious archaeological parallelism between Corinne ou I'ltalie and Gradiva permits an illuminating comparative development on the theme of voice. Gradiva is another magical fiction, the story of a woman of stone who comes to life before the eyes of Jensen's hero and makes him recover his health by the familiar sound of her voice: "Je savais quel etait le son de ta voix" (Deh'res, 142); ("I knew your voice sounded like that"). This reunion with the beloved feminine voice can only take place, according to Freud's reading, through the loss of the voice of the analyst-doctor that he is: "Gradiva was able to return the love which was making its way from the unconscious into consciousness, but the doctor cannot" (Delusions, 90). Affirming the superiority of fiction over analytic science, Freud in this study nevertheless refuses to assimilate himself into the "total psychiatrist." He rejects the power attached to the institutional "I" of science. But at the same time, he allows himself the right to fiction, the pure fiction of this "classic happy ending, marriage" in Jensen, which cures 53</page><page sequence="8">because it is so strongly romantic. In fact, it is in separating himself from the psychiatrist that he dismisses the reading of Gradiva according to a fetishist etiology (a reading privileging the hero's fixation on Gradiva's lifted foot). Thus Freud's more fertile reading becomes necessary: "The case of Norbert Hanold should be described as hysterical, not paranoid delirium" (Delusions, 54). This hysterization of the hero is, however, very discreet, since Freud only provides the key to his reading in a note written in the conditional, the mode of the imaginary. The Freudian reading, a fictional supplement to the analytic discourse, would consist in revealing the hero's bisexuality, but also simultaneously the bisexuality of the heroine, Zoe-Gradiva, who has become the doctor. This operation of fictional androgyny, moreover, is doubled in the fiction's margins by its repressed opposite, that of a Freud-Gradiva who, losing his sexual identity, receives in return the "voice" of fiction. The hysterical symptom as an "unconscious sexual phantasy that is simultaneously masculine and feminine" is contagious and passes first from the hero to the heroine and then outside the text to include the analyst who secretly becomes hysterical through the pleasure of reading.21 So Freud, by this fictional detour, is put in the position of speaking, of being spoken, as a woman. As for Germaine de Stael, she had to publish her sort of novel as a travel guide, and she thus reveals the urgency with which a private story opens onto public discourse, blocking at the same time any possible return to the private. Her archaeological quest does not have Gradiva's happy, familial solution: there is no marriage. The romantic ruins remain palatial monu? ments, destroyed forever without so much as the outline of a familial roof. Italy remains an open space, knowingly chosen by Corinne as the only one from which she can speak: Vous m'avez permis la gloire, 6 vous, nation liberate, qui ne banissez point les femmes de son temple. (XX, 5, 861) (You allowed me glory, O you, liberal nation, who does not banish women from the temple.) This exalting of feminine talent seems curious when in the novel the poet finds herself being reduced to silence in order to let the stones speak. It would seem that the Staelian novel demonstrates almost perversely all the dangers implicit in feminine fiction's strategy of metaphorical substitution. This delegation of the power of speech is not without risk. By assigning to the decor of ruins the task of refracting her image and presence, as if speaking in her name, the heroine not only effaces herself as the subject of the discourse but in the end positions herself as an object of the masculine gaze. Does not 54</page><page sequence="9">the fiction of the touristic narrative, a strategic feminine tactic, risk falling right back into the phallocentric representational trap in which woman is unable to inscribe herself unless it is as an object in ruins, a mutilated object? Does not the ruin, that broken, fragmented object, serve too readily in that worshipping of the feminine body?already lost?only by re-inscribing its presence as mutilation? Pleasure in ruins is part of an androcentric strategy that, while maintaining the fascination of the object of love?and beyond that, sexual difference?denies it by displacing its adoration onto fetish objects: monuments, frescos, statues.22 This new, melancholy religion of the aesthetic appropriation of the world of shapes makes one feel secure, but it can only reveal the narcissistic investment of the Romantic poet, tourist, or analyst. It is the compulsory route taken by every Romantic author, who, in the depths of exile, can find only the specular double of his own image. The romantic episode at the Fountain of Trevi, stirring the lovers to resume their Roman quest, barely conceals this androcentric and nar? cissistic dimension of the amorous relationship: il se pencha vers la fontaine pour mieux voir, et ses propres traits vinrent alors se reflechir a c6te de ceux de Corinne. Elle le reconnut, fit un cri.... (IV, 6, 690) (he leaned towards the fountain so he could see better, and his own features then appeared in reflection next to Corinne's. She recognized him and cried out-) This introspective splitting of the individual between two heroes as self and knowledge of self?another characteristic of the modern imagination- according to Stael gives only a partial account of this novel of doubles, Corinne ou I'ltalie.23 In the end Corinne's story is not reducible to that of Oswald. The quest abandoned by the masculine hero at the end of the novel will be taken up again by his wife, Lucile, another English double for Corinne and her paternal sister as well. The novel's riddle does indeed reside, as this proliferation of doubles attests, in the problem of identity, an identity that is the actual "object," initially and forever lost. The novel, Corinne ou I'ltalie, is, in fact, the story of a double voyage. The voyage of exile of the hero overshadows (in the first part of the novel) the heroine's return to her mother's homeland. If it is the fathers presence and voice that Oswald seems to have to designate as the goal of his Italian trip, for Corinne it is the mother's. For the heroine Italy is the maternal land, or rather the maternal breast. Corinne both is and is not Italy, which is also her mother. We are in the presence of a new definition of a polymorphic identity or a strategy for escaping the Romantic schema. In other words, the Staelian fiction figures the locus of a loss, the loss of the family patronym, and 55</page><page sequence="10">therefore the loss of the connection of identity that is bound to the name of the father. But, at the same instant, it reveals itself as the locus of another type of privileged connection, one buried more deeply in the memory of civilizations as well as in individual memory. Another narcissism, a primary narcissism that disregards oppositions between person and country, subject and object, self and other, takes the detour of writing to inscribe itself as the archaic relationship with the mother.24 A return to origins and a taste for the archaic become clear in other respects as a return to the naming of spaces (the evocative power of the mother as "place name" has been demonstrated by Julia Kristeva25) and to the privileging of orality in descriptions. The tourist descriptions only fill the gaps in the adult feminine story?Corinne's story?in order to re? organize, as we have seen, the euphoric space of another story that would resemble that of childhood loves. It would be the story of the infant, the "in- fans": the one who does not speak but shows and calls with his or her voice? a child's viewpoint that others will call poetic. The descriptions in this sense are evocation not only in the traditional sense of the word, but also in the etymological sense of "e-vocation" as "calling out" or even as "in-vocation." It is these tourist designations with their strangely evocative power?the power to evoke archaic place names?that ultimately give the descriptions in Corinne ou I'ltalie their real strength. This evocation of the dead ends with the disturbing evocation of the eternal absence in the plot, the mother. Indeed, the tourist discourse would derive its all-powerful rhetorical being from the fact that it ultimately functions as prosopopoeia: that is, as the evocation of a dead person?or rather a dead woman?whom, however, the discourse has made speak and act. The final double, the maternal double, brings together and reconciles all of writing's doubles. It is certainly this maternal double whom the poet Corinne unceasingly invokes by means of a series of apostrophes opening the first improvisation: Italie, empire du Soleil, Italie; maitresse du monde; Italie, berceau des lettres, je te salue. (II, 3, 665) (Italy, empire of the Sun, Italy; mistress of the world; Italy, cradle of letters, I salute you.) These are invocations to the maternal homeland where the evocation of the past serves less as a signifier than as an alibi for vocalization, for the call, the cry. These are cries of distress by Corinne whose return trip to the mythologi? cal past of civilization is poetically akin to the voyage of "Chore" when Pluto, her lover, steals her from her mother, Persephone/Demeter, to carry her away into the kingdom of the shades and the dead. By playing with 56</page><page sequence="11">mythological connotations, this new playful trick of writing refers to that other quest of a mother for her daughter. Through an infinity of displace? ments in the linguistic chain, through the impossibility of closing off the naming that is the keystone in the architecture of language, through a perverse game played with her romantic writing, de Stael's ultimate goal seems indeed to be the deconstruction?or the ruin?of this privileged cultural edifice that is language as "home." Both in the home of logos that Plato constructed and in the paternal home delimited by Freud, Staelian writing defines itself as a strategy of exile with no real return.26 From this perspective, Corinne ou I'ltalie, Corinne in Italy, Chore/Persephone calls up the Platonic "Chora," a linguistic articulation completely provisional and essentially mobile, which, "unable to locate itself" except through a "bastard reasoning"?that is, fiction for Germaine de Stael?elsewhere in Timaeus finds itself absorbed by the nourishing, maternal space, a space that, "neither a being in itself," nor a projection of the One, is a "being never to be named."27 The novel Corinne ou I'ltalie produces, in the theater of Romantic literary ruins, the diverse masquerades presented by the myth of voice as understood in its different meanings.28 First, voice understood in its grammatical sense, the impersonal voice of narration of the travel guide as it presents, in disguise, the story of the heroine. But then the Staelian feminine novel would also appear to be written in another, grammatical, sense of voice, the passive voice: woman speaking herself, being spoken by the discourse of the Other, the voice of culture, the voice of the father. Giving voice to culture results, however, as we have seen, in a troubling perversion of the narrative apparatus where the in-vocation of the classical past is transformed into an e-vocation of person?the mother. In this last transformation, voice as e-vocation is the calling upon breath to vocalize; it is the first language constituted between mother and child. Feminine literature would here demonstrate its ludic specificity. The role of the Sibyl, her body in a trance applying herself to voicing Apollo's oracles, is thus used in a subversive and playful way. For Corinne, the Staelian sibyl, voicing Apollo's oracles is a pretext for recalling, like in the older version of the myth, the original possessor of the Delphic oracle?Gaia, Mother Earth. Feminine writing would here operate according to the model of an archaeological quest whose success and pleasure could be achieved only in the mode of theft. The writing of the Staelian tourist novel is certainly?as criticism has long acknowledged and we must acknowledge?a product of the typically femi? nine perversion, kleptomania.29 It has been pointed out that the literary artifact obtained, Corinne ou I'ltalie, partakes in the esthetic of the "ready- made" before any such thing existed. Literature in this sense would discover the veils of its fiction?a fiction where it could only be a question of stealing 57</page><page sequence="12">dresses, a robbery that would disclose, under the travesties of the imaginary, the nothingness of a voice that never stops laughing.30 This laughter, however, ends up with more than the last word in the melancholy cemetery of romantic writings. Among other examples, by way of a Staelian postscript, there is the example of the kleptomania (masculine this time) in Me*moires d'outre-tombe. In order to explain his love for Mme. Recamier, Chateaubriand needs the echo of another voice. He inserts in their entirety the love letters sent by Germaine de Stael to the beautiful Juliette, changing neither the heading nor the signature.31 It is a strange play of echoes, a strange travesty of voice, of this fossil voice that has long haunted and continues to haunt the mansions of the Romantics.

Subsequent references are cited parenthetically in the text. S. Kofman has analyzed the fictional dimension of Freud's reading in Gradiva: Quatre romans analytiques (Paris: Galilee, 1973), pp. 101-33. It is to shed light on the effect of this reading regarding the notion of author and voice that we discuss it here. 21 Freud, "Hysterical Phantasies," p. 159. 22 Roland Mortier, in La Poetique des ruines en France (Geneva: Droz, 1974), has brilliantly analyzed the thematic variations of the ruin motif. His work is rein? terpreted from a psychoanalytic perspective here. In this light the melancholy attitude of the observer of ruins began to disclose the possibility of a connection to fetishism (cf. Freud, "Fetishism," in The Standard Edition, XXI, 152-59). The lost object is, in fact, described in a contradictory manner in "Fetishism" as simul? taneously the "mother's penis" and the mark "of the lack of a penis." The fetish is thus presented as a sort of ambiguous "memorial substitute." The indecidability of the melancholy memorial as it concerns sexual identity, implicit in Freud's text, is fully exploited in the Staelian novel. The analysis of the fetishism of ruins is clarified elsewhere in Jean Baudrillard's study, "Fetichisme et ideologic: la reduction semi- ologique," in Pour une critique de I'economie politique du signe (Paris: Gallimard, 1982), pp. 93-113. 23 See Madame de Stael, De la litter ature, in Oeuvres Completes, I, 170. 59</page><page sequence="14">24 See Sigmund Freud, "L'Inquietante Etrangete" (Paris: Gallimard, 1933) pp. 186-87: "It is a matter of returning to certain phases in the developmental history of the awareness of the Ego, a regression to the period in which the Ego was not yet clearly defined in relation to the external world and to others." The relationship between mother and melancholy is developed by Melanie Klein in "Mourning and Its Relations to Manic-depressive States," in Love, Guilt and Other Works (New York: Delta Books, 1975), pp. 186-95. 25 See Julia Kristeva, "Noms de lieux," in Polylogue (Paris: Seuil, 1977), pp. 497-90, where putting the proper name or patronym into question is presented in the following manner: "This archaeology of naming (spatial marker, demonstratives, "topic," a person's name) and what is undecidable about the subject-object rela? tionship accompanying it on the psychoanalytic level (potential space, primary narcissism, auto-eroticism, sado-masochism) will have a connection to the confused reflections of logicians on the semantics of proper names." 26 We are establishing a parallelism between the strategies of Staelian writing and those identified by Kristeva in Mallarme. See in "Noms de lieux," p. 479, "what is it that the poet unearths from the paradoxical semiosis of the newborn, of that 'semiotic chora,' of that 'space' before the sign, the archaic organization of primary narcissism, in order to defy the closing off of senses." 27 Kristeva, p. 479. 28 The notion of voice is taken here in the different senses set forth by Guy Rosolato in "The Voice," in Essais sur le symbolique (Paris: Gallimard, 1964), p. 304: "Literary voice in the linguistic sense, linked to the system of pronouns or the verb system (passive, active, pronominal), or the 'relative' voice linked to the question of the 'Name of the father' and finally the voice in the sense of origin that sustains the fantasies of a unity, ambisexuality and that in that case, becomes the 'not-lost object.'" Helene Cixous and Catherine Clement stress the specific relationship to voice in what is described as "feminine writing" in La Jeune nee (Paris: 10/18, 197?), p. 170. 29 For theft and kleptomania defined in feminist theory as characteristically feminine, see Clement/Cixous, La Jeune nie, p. 178. 30 See Helene Cixous, "Le rire de la Meduse," in L'Arc, 8 (1975), 39-54.
