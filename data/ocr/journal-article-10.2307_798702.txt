<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEW REFLECTIONS ON THE REVOLUTIONS OF PARIS: AN ESSAY ON RECENT HISTORICAL WRITING CHARLES TILLY Harvard University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology At least once a political generation, historical writing on the French Revo- lution renews itself. Perhaps one can see in the flourishing of a new variety of historical analysis in the late 1950's a response-with a suitable delay for the painstaking research required-to the tearing and battering that France suffered at the end of World War II. The trait which sets off this new re- appraisal from those which came be- fore it is its concern with the ordinary participants in massive political move- ments, particularly in Paris.' The city's crowds have arrived on stage. Historians of France are already quite aware of this invasion of the scene, and of the shifts in the dramatis personae it will call for.2 It would therefore be both useless and presump- tuous for me to attempt here to re- write the history of the Revolution in the light of these new studies. How- ever, the current reappraisal of the Revolution inevitably involves some questions in the sociology of political upheaval. That is true both because students of upheaval have so regularly taken the Revolution of 1789 as a model and because the relentless re- searches of historians have yielded such an ample supply of organized in- formation on its course. The Revolu- tion is a great proving ground for hunches, hypotheses and formulations. A review of new conclusions and their implications may therefore help stu- dents of contemporary political conflict to check their own formulations. That is the purpose of this essay. No, not exactly. The purpose is a little broader, in two ways. First, the studies I want to consider deal mainly with the Revolution, but they also have some very important things to say 1 This change of focus is by no means the only important postwar innovation in the analysis of the French Revolution, even if it is probably the one which will affect the present generation of researchers most profoundly. The elaboration of the idea of an "Atlantic Revolution" with com- mon features in many western countries-- stated notably in Jacques Godechot, La Grande Nation, Paris: Aubier, 1956, 2 vols. and R. R. Palmer, The Age of the Demo- cratic Revolution, Princeton: Princeton Uni- versity Press, 1959--certainly deserves at- tention. And the appearance of a number of detailed analyses of eighteenth century rural organization, rich in demographic and economic data, will surely force his- torians to revise their conclusions about rural participation in the Revolution; ex- amples are P. de Saint-Jacob, Les Paysans de la Bourgogne du Nord au dernier sidcle de l'Ancien Regime, Paris: Les Belles Lettres, 1960, and Paul Bois, Paysans de I'Ouest, Le Mans: Vilaire, 1960. Let me record here my gratitude to the Center of International Studies, Princeton University, for the encouragement to consider the problems of this essay, and the leisure to write it. 2 See, for example, Marcel Reinhard, "Sur I'histoire de la R6volution francaise," Annales; Aconomies, Societes, Civilisations, XIV (July-Sept. 1959), pp. 553-570; R.

Second, the issues they raise have to do not only with the sociology of political upheaval but also with the profound problem of the relationship between major social changes and the appear- ance of "disorder" in society. What do sociologists ordinarily say when they are asked to pronounce on this profound problem? They certainly do not agree on the definition of "dis- order," "deviance," "disorganization" or "disintegration," even if they are inclin- ed to apply those terms to events and behaviors of which a large number of people disapprove simultaneously. And when confronted with the fact of per- vasive change, they are often con- founded by the difficulty of deciding which concomitants of pervasive change deserve to be called "disorder- ly," "deviant," "disorganized" or "dis- integrative." Yet sociologists common- ly assert that there is a correlation (and more than that) between major struc- tural change, strain, and disorder. The assertion often shows up on a theoreti- cal level, whether it is Sorokin conclud- ing that " ... during the periods when the existing culture, or the system of social relationships, or both, undergo a rapid transformation, the internal dis- turbances in the respective societies in- crease""3 or Ogburn, "In a changing so- society ... the times seem out of joint, and there is much maladjustment be- tween the different parts of culture,'"' or a well-known textbook enumerating sources of change: " ... a 'disturb- ance' of the system, a strain or conflict, or a cultural or environmental impetus of some kind.... "5 The same general correlation reappears in such first-rate case studies as Smelser's analysis of the textile industry, or Hughes' dissection of rural-urban tensions in Canada.6 Conclusion: the idea that structural change, strain and disorder ordinarily accompany each other is both credible and widely held. All the more reason for scrutinizing the idea closely. No doubt one could usefully begin such scrutiny with a con- ceptual analysis; there is enough am- biguity in "structural change," "strain" and "disorder" to keep a whole flotilla of philologists at sea for life. Or one might review the evidence on all sorts of changes and all sorts of disorder, with the hope of knitting them to- gether in one graceful synthesis. That is a very large job, one for someone else. The consideration of one kind of event commonly defined as disorderly, and its possible relations to major so- cial changes, is task enough for this essay. The revolutionary crowd will occupy our attention. In the pages of the his- torians of the French Revolution, the crowd has gone through a remarkable evolution. More exactly, a dialectic. On one side, there has always been the Burkian disdain of the multitude, the free use of words like "rabble" and "mob," the belief that the bulk of the participants in revolutionary events consisted of historical flotsam. On the other, there has been confidence in The People, the utilization of much more political titles like "democrats," "sans-culottes," even "Jacobins," and the tendency to assign well-articulated political and economic objectives to the mass of revolutionaries. The mutual criticism of the two factions of his- torians has gradually reduced the crudity of the differences they have ob- served among the participants in the 3 Pitirim A.

Michelet, in portraying the Revolution as the intentional work of a unified people, provided the most compelling state- ment of the romantic-revolutionary theme. And Taine, from whose pen the epithets "plebeians," "canaille," "dregs," "scum" and "guttersnipes" gushed unstoppably, was the fountain- head of antirevolutionary vocabulary. Le Bon's famous essay on revolution is largely a gloss on Taine. And it is there that we find the various anti- revolutionary themes reduced to their lowest common denominator: The facts of the Revolution teach us . . . that a people freed from social constraints, the foundations of civiliza- tion, and abandoned to its instinctive impulses, speedily relapses into its an- cestral savagery. Every popular revolu- tion which succeeds in triumphing is a temporary return to barbarism.7 Shades of Hobbes and Burke! The very lack of subtlety of Le Bon's pronounce- ment serves to emphasize the curious combination of political, philosophical and sociological issues the analysis of revolutionary crowds entails. The in- vestigation of popular participation in revolution involves not only the factual questions of who did what, but also the controversial problems of the breadth of support for the revolution as a whole, the value of revolutionary accomplishments, the reliability of the masses, the rights of the elite and the desirability of gradualism. A formid- able catalogue of issues in political philosophy. But also a compendium of issues that are never far away when sociologists begin to analyze massive social change. Historians have formulated three or four general ideas about the relation- ship between popular participation in French revolutionary movements and major changes in French society. The first, I suppose, belongs to what Wil- liam Kornhauser calls the aristocratic criticism of mass society.8 It assumes an eternal danger from the masses, and explains their collective action by a change-usually conceived to be a de- cline-in the position and organization of the elite. We might therefore call this the elitist thesis. When "natural" restraints weaken, the daemonic force of the mob breaks loose. So what has to be explained is how the elite lost its grip. In Crane Brinton's list of pre- liminary signs of revolution-"govern- ment deficits, complaints over taxation, governmental favoring of one set of economic interests over another, ad- ministrative entanglements and con- fusions, desertion of the intellectuals, loss of self-confidence among many members of the ruling class, conversion of many members of that class to the belief that their privileges are unjust or harmful to society, the intensifica- tion of social antagonisms, the stop- page at certain points . . of the career open to talents, the separation of economic power from political power and social distinction"9-the disintegration of the elite has pride of place. But it is Taine who provides the purest form of the theory: . . . another colossal monster rises up, a monster with millions of heads, a blind, startled animal, an entire people pressed down, exasperated and suddenly loosed against the government whose exactions have despoiled it, against the privileged whose rights have reduced it to starvation, without, in these rural districts abandoned by their natural pro- tectors, encountering any surviving au- 7 Gustave Le Bon (Bernard Miall, tr.), The Psychology of Revolution, London: T.

It could bear the name of the uprooting thesis. It shares with the elitist thesis an emphasis on the break- down of social controls, but locates the breakdown in the mass instead. The essence: that massive social change (and not only strictly economic change) ordinarily tears large numbers of people away from the old norms, from their well-defined roles, from their communities, and leaves them drifting, hopeless and unduly re- sponsive to the political appeals of the extremes. Uprooted masses make revo- lutions. That is the point of Korn- hauser's contention that "transitional societies are vulnerable to mass upris- ings among those sections of the popu- lation who no longer are rooted in communal groups and have not been fully incorporated into the newly emerging society."" We shall discover an eloquent defender of this thesis in Louis Chevalier. A third broad proposition on the relationship between social change and participation in revolutionary move- ments is essentially economic. Let us call it the misery thesis. In its simplest form, it says that those who suffer most from economic change are most likely to rebel. As Francois Furet ap- plies the proposition to the old regime, "the great collective outbreaks of vio- lence which burst into the people's long periods of resignation and silence are consumers' violence; they are riots for price control and not for social transformation."12 With advancing in- dustrialization, according to this thesis, the weight of misery shifts to the ur- ban proletariat, which thereby becomes the most troubled and troubling sector of society. We shall see a sophisticat- ed and powerful presentation of this point of view in the work of Ernest Labrousse. No one could call the fourth general proposition uneconomic, since Karl Marx contributed so mightily to its formulation. However, beginning with Marx' contention that "the separate in- dividuals form a class only in so far as they have to carry on a common battle against another class,"13 the proposition emphasizes the organiza- tional, political conditions for common revolutionary action. A suitable label: the organizational thesis. Economic evolution establishes the framework for class consciousness. But it takes in- tense communication and considerable organization within a class to trans- form a vague awareness of common in- terests and common opposition to an- other class into revolutionary con- sciousness; and revolutions (goes the theory) are ordinarily the work of the most class-conscious segments of the population. Hence the persistent French concern with the prise de con- science of the urban working class.

Because he has lost everything, says Marx, the worker will reconquer everything. The factory al- lows him to renew himself. This dialectic unquestionably contains a large element of truth: in fact, the great battalions of industry are the backbone of revolution in modern France.14 Among French historians, the organiza- tional thesis, which goes from eco- nomic change to revolutionary action via common interests, organization, communication and class consciousness is probably the most widely accepted of the four under discussion. The elitist, uprooting misery, and organizational theses do not entirely exclude each other. Nor does each one identify a well-established intellectual faction. But each does lead to some- what different expectations concerning the character, role and origins of revo- lutionary crowds. The novelty of the bulk of the recent research we have to review is that it has set out to test these general ideas by direct examina- tion of the participation of ordinary people in revolutions, instead of simply inferring the facts from general im- pressions and theoretical preconcep- tions. The authors have purposely abandoned history "from above"- from the vantage points of parliaments, political commentators, party chief- tians, memorialists. They have espoused history "from below." This kind of history inevitably comes close to the everyday preoccupations of sociologists. These comments apply least well to the first author, Ernest Labrousse. He is by no means a recent arrival in French historiography, and he has chosen to sculpt a very large block indeed: the economic history of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Nevertheless, his researches have pro- vided not only the setting, but also the working hypotheses and direct inspira- tions of a large number of studies of revolutionary action in France since 1700. In two influential books, them- selves largely inspired by the eco- nometric work of Francois Simiand, Labrousse has long since enunciated the idea that fluctuations in prices, wages and revenues provide a master key to the incidence of French political upheaval.15 Contemporary historians owe La- brousse three fundamental hypotheses. The first is that modern French eco- nomic history falls into three rather distinct periods, each with its own internal laws, those of a) the old-fash- ioned economy of grains and textiles, subject to short, acute crises based on bad harvests, enduring until around the third quarter of the nineteenth cen- tury, b) the stable-money industrial economy, full of tensions between mar- kets and manufacturing, subject to crises of overproduction, lasting until the first World War, c) the unstable- money industrial economy, from that time on, with the problems of the previous regime greatly amplified by the dangerous swings of inflation and deflation."' Each of these economic types, Labrousse contends, produces its own brand of conflict. The second major hypothesis: that 14 Georges Duveau (L.-H. Parias, ed.) Histoire du peuple francais. IV.

Each of these long- range tendencies was overlaid with sig- nificant cyclical fluctuations, with the most serious of the eighteenth century reaching exactly its maximum at the fateful time of July, 1789. According to this analysis, the periods of rise (notably the crucial period before the great revolution of 1789) usually squeeze the workers and small peasants unmercifully, while immensely profit- ing the holders of land and capital. The third hypothesis is that there is a high correlation between the ap- pearance of the cylical economic crises that each type of economy produces and the outbreak of political disturb- ances, even if the most serious con- flicts presuppose the simultaneous (and somewhat independent) development of a political crisis.17 The last qualification makes it clear that Labrousse is no simple-minded economic determinist. So does the fol- lowing dictum: In order to bring about a revolution of the type of 1789, of 1830 or of 1848, to put a mass into motion, in the ab- sence of an impulse from a great popu- lar party or of the traumatic shock of defeat or of occupation . . . the only force strong enough is another kind of massive fact, of which an economic oc- currence is the most developed type.18 In short, Labrousse is very much con- cerned with the social conditions- economic or otherwise--which can mobilize a large number of people simultaneously. Nonetheless, his an- alyses of the period 1750-1850, the pe- riod which concerns him most, identify economic crises as the essential anima- tors of political disturbances. Further- more, these analyses strongly imply that misery (especially a sharp in- crease in misery) tends to erupt direct- ly into political disturbance, although the objects and forms of political dis- turbance change with the evolution from one type of economy to another. The most important distinction La- brousse makes in that respect is be- tween a) the subsistence-based agita- tion of the "old regime" and b) con- flict between organized blocs of work- ers and employers. He observes that the old economic regime suffered from a typical two-phased crisis. The first phase, beginning with a deficient har- vest of a major food crop, sent prices up catastrophically, and thus hurt all consumers; the second, essentially a response to the decline in demand due to the diversion of money to high- priced food, brought a drastic decline in industrial production (especially textiles) and consequent unemploy- ment. The ordinary response to such a crisis, according to Labrousse, was a series of uncoordinated local disturb- ances centering on the question of sub- sistence: attacks on bakers and grain brokers, popular attempts to impose price controls on grains (including forced sales at "just" prices), stopping of grain shipments, demonstrations against suspected hoarders. To these 16 In fact, this typology is a fourfold classification based on two dichotomies- a) predominance of localized agriculture plus minor light industry/predominance of manufacturing, b) stable money/unstable money-with one cell empty. 17 In addition to Esquisse and Crise, op. cit., see "1848-1830-1789: Comment nais- sent les r6volutions," Actes du Congres historique du centenaire de la Revolution de 1848, Paris: Presses Universitaires de France, 1948, pp. 1-20; Le mouvement ouvrier et les theories sociales en France de 1815 a 1848, Paris: Centre de Documenta- tion Universitaire, 1961, "Les cours de Sorbonne." 18s"Comment naissent les r&amp;volutions," op. cit., p. 3.

Labrousse's discussion of the economic crisis of 1817 includes these observations: The consequence of the crisis was a recrudescence of Luddism and violent popular reactions, much more serious than workers' reactions strictly defined. Workers, artisans, country day-laborers, smallholders who had not harvested enough to live on, in a word all the popular classes joined in and reacted to the economic difficulties of 1817, above all to the rise in price of bread, with generalized disturbances. There were multiple disturbances, especially at the time of milling. They stopped the shipping of grain and brought about frequent riots.19 The periodic outbreak of such scat- tered, short-lived, violent disturbances was endemic in the old economic sys- tem. The middle of the nineteenth cen- tury, on the other hand, saw the in- stallation of a genuine industrial econ- omy in France. Consequence: the de- velopment of a true proletariat, con- centrated in the cities, in the great metal-working industries. Consequence: increasing working-class awareness of their common interests, their common opposition to the employers. Conse- quence: tendency of crises of the new type, throwing large numbers out of work simultaneously, to array political- ly-conscious workers against their em- ployers and their government. So the change of economic type brought about a major transformation of po- litical disturbances: from scattered to collective, from rural to urban, from unfocused to focused. The Revolution of 1848, in Labrousse's opinion, came at a critical point in that transition: it broke out "at the meeting-place of crises of the old type and the new. On the crisis of grains and textiles was superimposed the crisis of the metal- working economy."20 The two types of crises and their political consequences seem to have a few properties in common. In both cases, those who suffer most from the crisis are most likely to take politi- cal action. In both cases, they tend to blame their suffering directly on the political regime. In both cases, they supply a very large share of the fol- lowers among the revolutionaries: In today's society, as in the society of those days, there are two large categories in the rebel mass: the believers and the floaters. The believers have no need of an economic crisis to undertake a revolution. But all their grievances, all their hostility will then be brought to the highest pitch. Alone, furthermore, they can do nothing. They need the lever of an entire people. No doubt the believers make revolutions. But the float- ers, by the weight of their mass, change a riot into a victorious movement. An innumerable mass is necessary, a kind of popular unanimity.21 It is therefore fair to say that Labrousse attaches great importance to short- range economic suffering as a precipi- tator, as a mobilizer of popular parti- cipation in political upheaval. This is the judicious way in which Labrousse integrates political and eco- nomic elements in the Revolution of 1830: It was therefore popular intervention that resolved the issue. We know very well that in many workingclass circles that intervention was due to an ideology fundamentally hostile to the regime, an ideology inherited from 1789, at once nationalist and democratic. But to that was added the unemployment and the misery which synchronized discontent and brought the popular masses to re- bellion. That combination of economic crisis, political crisis and provocative govern- mental imprudence creates a truly revo- lutionary situation, an explosive mixture. That is true for 1789. It is true for 1848. It is true for 1830.22 19 Le mouvement ouvrier et les theories sociales, op. cit., p. 87. 20"Comment naissent les revolutions," op. cit., p. 8. 21 bid., p. 12. 22 Mouvement ouvrier et theories sociales, op. cit., p. 97.</page><page sequence="8">106 SOCIAL PROBLEMS Likewise, in discussing the repercus- sions of the economic troubles of 1846-51 on the critical political events of those years, Labrousse takes great care to distinguish his position from a simple economic mechanism: Deeply felt-like every movement, like every acute misfortune-by a consider- able number of affected persons, crisis and depression influence the judgments and attitudes of large human collectiv- ities. But that influence works in an al- ready-constituted psychological setting. It affects a kind of sensitivity, a mentality, an ideology. The fact of the crisis is per- ceived, in the last analysis, through a social psychology already in existence. If the fact modifies the social psychology, the social psychology begins by impreg- nating the fact, coloring it deeply. And that exchange of influences is all-impor- tant. In the last analysis, the study of such crises is a chapter in the study of social psychologies--one of the great tasks of tomorrow's History.23 Such a statement from an eminent historian is fascinating in its own right. Yet the fact remains that in their spe- cific historical analyses Labrousse and his co-workers have emphasized the temporal and geographical coincidence of sudden misery and political disturb- ance. The thesis that there is an inti- mate connection between the two is the unifying element in the studies of the background of 1848 which the last statement introduces. It is, I think, the rationale of the captivating map of local disturbances of 1846-47 which stands at the head of those studies.24 It is the nub of Deyon's conclusion concerning the region of Rouen that "The people were not content to com- plain and appeal to the generosity of the rich. Hundreds of popular out- bursts showed their discontent. Those outbursts contributed heavily to the triumph of the February Revolu- tion."25 Still, this group of researchers neith- er demonstrates nor insists on a per- fect correspondence among the in- tensity of the crisis, the extent of misery and the amount of political conflict. Even less do they construct a case for the notion that those who suffered most from the crisis therefore participated most actively in political disturbances. The crisis of 1847 stabbed the region of Caen deeply, and yet the region did little more than murmur.26 The crisis was apparently quite gentle with the Var, but the Var was turbu- lent from 1848 to 1851.27 And in the Nord: Altogether the workers of Lille, hard hit by the crisis, could only express their discontent by noisy but bootless dem- onstrations, unhappy but resigned agita- tion, disturbances over the supply and price of food. It is no doubt because they belonged to a sector for the most part spared by the crisis that the actions of the miners of the Nord basin were more dynamic, as well as more fruitful.28 In summary, these fact-filled analyses of the eve of the 1848 raise the critical question of the relationship between the general fact of economic crisis and the specific fact of political disturb- ance, provide a wealth of data on the question, but do not answer it. That is, in fact, the great virtue of Labrousse's work, from the viewpoint of the stu- dent of political upheaval: as well as offering an illuminating analysis of the broad lines of economic change and its social consequences, he has posed sharp and inescapable questions about the exact relationship between economic 23 "Panoramas de la crise," in C.-E.

No one could confuse Ernest La- brousse with our second author, Louis Chevalier. The one, an economic his- torian seizing a large period of the life of French society as a whole and gen- eralizing about it broadly; the other, a sociologist - demographer - historian concentrating his great energies on a single half-century of one city's ex- perience. Yet both have important things to say about the relationship between social change and political upheaval. Where Labrousse emphasizes economic transformations, Chevalier accentuates the unsettling effects of migration and urban life. The combination of talents and dis- ciplines-demography, history and so- ciology-which Chevalier brings to his work is much rarer in the United States than in France, for reasons which would in themselves be interest- ing to trace. The combination permits him to write urban history of a unique variety-rich, textured, comprehensive and frequently quantitative. In addi- tion to his work in technical demo- graphy, he has produced studies of peasant life, of the cholera epidemic of 1832, and of the problems of French colonies.29 But the works that interest us here are Classes laborieuses et class- es dangereuses and its statistical under- pinning, La formation de la population parisienne.30 In these books, he seeks not only to reconstitute the transforma- tion of Paris' population, organization and way of life during the nineteenth century, but also to understand the con- nections among the city's social com- position, its recruitment of popula- tion, its physical character, its political traits and its pathology-in the widest sense of the word. The books are first-rate sources for urban sociology. They incorporate biological considerations-not only mortality and fertility, but also ques- tions of health, disease, nutrition and sexuality-into the study of history in a way that only a demographer is likely to have devised.31 Indeed, at times their reader has the eerie feel- ing of being initiated into an occult belief in the determining force of place and physique. Classes laborieuses is almost as much a plea for a par- ticular conception of history as it is a document on the history of Paris. That does not mean Chevalier's work lacks solidity. Considering our usual notions of the insufficiency of statisti- cal sources concerning the nineteenth century, La formation de la population parisienne offers an amazingly detailed picture of migration to Paris in the nineteenth century and its effects on the characteristics of Paris' population. Likewise, the discussion of sources which fills the opening pages of Class- es laborieuses leaves no doubt that the Parisian observers of the early nine- teenth century bequeathed their so- ciological successors a wealth of de- scription and analysis-both quantita- tive and qualitative-of the city's pop- 29 See Les Paysans (Paris: Denoel, 1947); La probleme demographique nord- africain, Paris: Presses Universitaires de France, 1947; Demographie ginerale, Paris: Dalloz, 1951; Madagascar: Populations et ressources, Paris: Presses Universitaires de France, 1952; Le Choldra, La Roche-sur- Yon: Imprimerie Centrale de I'Ouest, 1958; Bibliotheque de la Revolution de 1848, tome XX; collective work with contri- butions by a number of other authors. 30 La Formation de la population paris- ienne au XIXe sidcle, Paris: Presses Uni- versitaires de France, 1950; Classes la- borieuses et classes dangeruses a' Paris pendant la premiere moitid du XIXe sidcle, Paris: Plon, 1958. 31 For Chevalier's conception of bio-his- tory, see Classes laborieuses, op. cit., xxv- xxviii; Le Cholera, op. cit., iii-xvii.

To such famous descriptions as those of Fr6- gier, Parent-Duchatelet, Villerm6 or Buret, and such statistical compilations as Recherches statisiques de la ville de Paris, Chevalier adds a long, illuminat- ing analysis of literary testimony: Mer- cier, Janin, Sue, Balzac, Hugo. Gavro- che, the gamin of Les Miserables, ap- pears to Chevalier as the epitome of the city's drifting, neglected, violent youth. And in the pages of Balzac he finds the idea that "crime became sat- urated with popular rebellion, until it turned into popular rebellion" (p. 71). There he states one of the fundamental themes of the book. After this review of reports of Paris' crime and disorder, Chevalier turns to a discussion of demographic problems. He treats the great growth of the city's population after the Revolution, and its implications for housing, public services and the composition of the population itself. Major conclusions: a) the "basic disequilibration" (always a conveniently ambiguous word) of the Parisian population, as exemplified in its age and sex structure, b) the appearance of a whole threatening class of immigrants who "remained nomadic ... or settled in the margins of the capital, and of its activities and civiliz- ation, in low neighborhoods and low occupations" (p. 258). This exploration of demographic changes leads into a detailed treat- ment of other forms of misery and "social deterioration": infanticide, pros- titution, insanity, suicide, concubinage, illegitimacy, differential morbidity and mortality. That life was hard in that old Paris, Chevalier leaves little doubt; but the sociological reader is left won- dering whether this section of the book really establishes a deterioration during the period under study, or a firm con- nection between disorder and popula- tion growth.32 Yet Chevalier insists: The excessive growth of the population rebounded here very strongly, produc- ing the most abnormal consequences. The determinism of the city apparent. in the close connection between crime and misery, between the working classes and the dangerous classes, in the ever- present invitation to a criminal career, is simply the expression of a more general determinism. (p. 378) In short, the city formed ("deformed" is the word Chevalier prefers) its new arrivals, and forced them into a chaos of despair, immorality, crime, violence and deprivation. And finally, there is death, comptabilisant le tout, freezing in in its grim statistics the proof of inequality and suffering. The last large section of classes la- borieuses is a discussion of "public opinion" concerning the Parisian mass- es, which returns to dip deeply into the literary and descriptive sources presented at the beginning. Then Chev- alier closes with an exasperatingly brief section on Parisian violence it- self, and an infuriatingly indefinite half-dozen pages on The Biological Foundations of Social History. I need hardly emphasize the impor- tance of such a book for the study of the processes we vaguely call urban- ization and social disorganization. In a certain light, one can read the entire book as an extended argument, via a case study, for the uprooting thesis, for the idea that massive social change (here, mainly migration and urban population growth) tears men from social ties and leads them into desper- ate and disorderly actions. And the case is the crucial one of Paris. Crucial, because Paris has so long ruled France with a force that London, New York or Berlin could not imagine. Crucial, because events in the streets of Paris have so often changed the political course of the nation. Over a century ago, Alexis de Tocqueville made the preeminence of Paris one of his prin- 32Note Georges Lefebvre's doubts as to the novelty of Paris' nineteenth-century situation, in his review of Classes laborieus- es, Annales historiques de la Revolution francaise, XXXI (avril-juin 1959), p. 174.</page><page sequence="11">Essay-Review 109 cipal explanations of the Revolution of 1789: "Thus Paris had mastered France, and the army that was soon to master Paris was mustering its forces."33 In this context, Chevalier's carefully- reasoned conclusion that Paris grew only sluggishly during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries (pp. 205-6) is something of a surprise. The rise of the monarchy and the geographic expansion of the city itself would have suggested other conclusions; the ques- tion probably deserves further investi- gation. In any case, Chevalier states that the Parisian population went from relative stagnation to rapid growth during the first third of the nineteenth century, to very rapid and jerky growth from about 1836 to 1856, slowing down thereafter. From 1801 to 1851, while the population of France as a whole increased about 30%, that of Paris doubled. Migration accounts for most of Paris' growth, as well as for the fluctuations in its rate of growth.34 The capital's boisterous expansion, Chevalier concludes, scrambled its own population and ripped thousands of men from their provincial attachments to leave them drifting in Paris, vulner- able to the city's peculiar pains and temptations, often desperate, always ill-controlled. Even the Revolution "looks in some respects like a settle- ment of accounts between two cate- gories of population: the old Parisian bourgeoisie and the others, those who in earlier days were called savages, barbarians, nomads .... " 35 And the changes of the early nineteenth cen- tury only aggravated the disorder. By implication, they account for the in- cessant political turbulence of Paris after the Revolution.36 But only by implication, for Chev- alier avoids two kinds of analysis which one might have expected him to use extensively. The first is the de- tailed study of the linkage and covaria- tion among the different types of dis- order which concern him; the second is the application of his hypotheses to 33 The Old Regime and the French Revo- lution, New York: Anchor Books 1955, p. 76. 34 For those who tend to equate urban- ization and industrialization, there is an- other small mystery here. Other authors- e.g. Marcel Reinhard and Andre Armen- gaud, Histoire generale de la population mondiale, Paris: Montchrestien, 1961, p. 245 and Charles H. Pouthas, La population francaise pendant la premidre moitie du XIXe siecle, Paris: Presses Universitaires de France, 1956, esp. p. 102-have raised doubts about the connection between in- dustrial expansion and urban growth in France during the early nineteenth century. Chevalier's Formation de la population parisienne (part II) contradicts the notion that real salary differentials between Paris and the provinces can explain the geo- graphic pattern of migration to the capi- tal, fails to find a close correlation be- tween fluctuations in employment and fluc- tuations in the volume of migration, and suggests that the occupations which ab- sorbed the largest number of migrants were not in the great modern industries, but in construction, food, metal-working, chemi- cals and a variety of small specialties. So how should we conceive of the migration that fed the mighty growth of Paris? Was the surplus rural population perhaps pushed off the land into unready cities? Is nine- teenth-century France a special case of what Kingsley Davis describes as the "overurbanization" of some underdeveloped countries? Surely there are some remark- able similarities between Davis' animad- versions on Cairo or Seoul ("Faced with idle, impoverished, and rootless urban masses, the government is forced to take drastic action or to allow itself to be dis- placed by a new revolutionary group,") and Chevalier's or Reinhard's portrayals of Paris at the beginning of the nineteenth century.

In fact, these two kinds of analysis present some grave and interesting problems for the major theses of Classes la- borieuses. On the question of covariation, no one is likely to deny that nineteenth- century Paris offered a dazzling display of vice and violence. But it is not enough to show that various forms of irregular behavior existed together in the city. Within the city, did they vary together in time and space? Did they, in fact, overlap and influence each other? Did the same people, or the same kinds of people, indulge in all of them? And were the producers of disorder actually those whom social change had uprooted and swept away? The rather general statements in Classes laborieuses that infanticide, prostitution and insanity were more common in working-class sections of Paris than elsewhere, and the slightly more precise assertion that insanity among workers was most common in the "lowest, roughest, most despised" occupations (p. 337) do not make the case. The discussion of suicide (pp. 338-359) contains more detail, and some edifying divagations, but fi- nally rests with the observation that toward the end of the nineteenth cen- tury, for France as a whole, the oc- cupational category "without occupa- tion or occupation unknown" had the highest suicide rate (p. 358).37 The weakness of the evidence on such matters is, of course, partly due to the state of the available historical materials. The more distressing part is therefore M. Chevalier's failure to re- analyze systematically the information that is available, especially from the great social surveys of the time, in order to test his inferences concerning the incidence of major forms of social disorganization. As for the great collective outbursts, at least Chevalier neglected them knowingly. Some of the eloquent final pages of his book block out the part that an analysis of participation in the crucial disturbances under the Restoration and the July Monarchy could have played in its argument, and whisper the hint that such an an- alysis will one day appear. But those same pages contain the curious admis- sion that "In spite of the influence of the powerful immigration that we have measured and of the aggravation that it could hardly fail to have brought to all problems, including po- 36 Louis Girard has combined these im- plications with some inferences from La- brousse's work in his comparative analysis of the revolutions of 1830, 1848 and 1871: Etude comparee des mouvements revolutionnaires en France en 1830, 1848 et 1870-71, Paris: Centre de Documenta- tion Universitaire, 1961, "Les cours de Sorbonne," 3 fascicules. M. Girard's writ- ings and his advice have helped me greatly in formulating the ideas of this essay. 37 In this discussion, Chevalier presents the rise in the absolute number of suicides and attempted suicides in the department of the Seine as proof of the increasing dis- organization of Paris. One can combine his figures (from pp. 345-6) to produce the following two series of rates per 100,000 population: Seine: Suicides France: and Attempts Suicides 1819-23 43 1824-26 41 1826-30 6 1831-35 6 1839-43 58 1836-40 8 1841-45 8 1844-48 56 1846-50 10 (I have recomputed the incorrectly calculat- ed rates for France as a whole---most likely taken from Emile Lavasseur, La popula- tion francaise, Paris: Rousseau, 1891, II, 126--shown on p. 346.) Even allowing for a large number of unsuccessful attempts at suicide, suicide was evidently much more frequent in the department of the Seine than in France as a whole, but its rise over the period was less impressive in the Seine than in the rest of the country. The socio- logical reader will wonder why so expert a demographer as as M. Chevalier neither prepared that simple statistic, showed the data for the intervening years, nor made allowances (verbal or statistical) for the fact that Paris' share of the Seine's total population was increasing between 1819 and 1848.</page><page sequence="13">Essay-Review 111 litical problems themselves, it is not evident, in fact, that it greatly changed the character of the most active sec- tors of the working class or the re- cruitment of its leaders." (p. 551) Indeed, the passage continues, the fragmentary evidence suggests that es- tablished Parisian artisans retained their preeminence as political activists and participants in public disturbances throughout the period from 1815 to 1848.38 If so, the fact challenges the directness of the connection between population changes and political up- heaval. It challenges the uprooting hypothesis. In the last analysis, it chal- lenges some of the major teachings of Classes laborieuses. For if the person- nel of riots and revolutions changed little, and the outsiders had little to do with political conflict, then we ought to conclude either that the influx of ill-integrated immigrants did not sweep away the old social arrangements or that Paris' propensity for political upheaval had little to do with the rest of the city's character. What conclusions should we draw? Surely not that this one area of un- certainty destroys the great value of Classes laborieuses as a source of hypo- theses and methodology, as a descrip- tion of Paris and its social disorgan- ization. Rather, that the debate con- tinues, the question remains open. Chevalier himself (p. 552) finally judges that the great contribution of demography to the analysis of the nineteenth century in France is that it adds that "more continuous and ample" history of the mass of men, the history of the crowd. That affirma- tion accentuates the importance of the revolutionary crowd as a theoretical junction of demography, sociology and history. Both Labrousse and Chevalier have enriched the theory of relationships be- tween social change and political up- heaval, and have come closer to the analysis of participation in political upheaval than their predecessors. Nev- ertheless, neither one has taken that analysis as a central concern. There is another group of historians which has recently devoted itself to the study of the revolutionary crowd in France, dealing mainly with the period from 1789 to 1795. These historians have produced the latest turn in the Left-Republican tra- dition of French historiography, which has flowed through the pages of Michelet, Jaures, Mathiez and Le- febvre. No doubt by the same tropism which attracts American sociologists of a conservative disposition to the study of "stable" hierarchies, and sociologists of the Left to the investigation of so- cial mobility, these historians seize on the characteristics of the turbulent revolutionary classes of 1789 and after. They reject the Burke-de Maistre- Taine-Le Bon contention that mindless mobs make revolutions, and with it the broad conclusion that change in the order of classes means catastrophe. They have made the people of the old Paris their intimates, have plunged to unheard-of depths into police records and the papers of local administration, and have not been afraid to put their findings in quantitative form. In short, they write authentic "history from be- low." The chief spokesman for this group 38 For further information, generally con- firming the political inactivity of the city's marginal populations, see Adeline Daumard, La bourgeoisie parisienne de 1815 a 1848, Paris: S.E.V.P.E.N., 1963, esp. pp. 576-593; R6mi Gossez, "Diversite des antagonismes sociaux vers le milieu du XIXe si&amp;cle," Revue economique (May, 1956), pp. 439- 457 and "L'organisation ouvriere a Paris sous la Seconde Republique," 1848.

Among his many works, his thousand-page thesis, Les Sans-culottes parisiens en l'an II, stands out.39 The title states the concerns of the book well enough, for the sans-culottes were the ordinary local political activists, the Year II (running from the fall of 1793 to the fall of 1794) witnessed the peak of the Terror, the apex of Robespierre's power, and a bitter struggle among supporters of competing conceptions of democracy and revolution, and Paris was the arena of that struggle. The book falls into three sections: a roughly chronological account of popu- lar participation in local revolutionary activity during the early part of the Year II, a detailed analysis of the composition and activity of the popu- lar democrats, and a description, again more or less chronological, of the "de- cline of the popular movement" and the social setting of Robespierre's de- bacle at Thermidor. Together, these sections (and the voluminous appen- dices) urge in great and persuasive detail a whole series of important historical conclusions: that the sans- culottes were a political force quite distinct in recruitment, activity and as- pirations from the Jacobins at the top of the revolutionary hierarchy; that the sans-culottes had their own primitive conception of autonomist, egalitarian democracy; that there was a genuine, far-reaching "contradiction" between these popular conceptions of the Revo- lution and the needs of national unity and defense so apparent to Robespierre and his confreres; that the Jacobins' momentarily successful campaign to arrive as the single party in revolution- ary politics explains many of the con- flicts and complexities of the Year II. Our interest here, however, is not so much in these conclusions as in Soboul's findings concerning the iden- tity, organization and activity of the sans-culottes. Who the sans-culottes were, of course, depends partly on the stringency of the definition applied to them. From a broad, geographic point of view, we can note that the most militant sections of Paris were neither those with fluid, marginal populations nor those with the largest industrial establishments, but the ones filled with artisans and small shops. The famous- ly insurrectionary Faubourg Saint-An- toine is the most obvious case. In order to avoid giving too "bourgeois" a tint to the map of sans-culottism, however, it is important to add that both pov- erty and unemployment were on the whole much more common in these sections than in the "moderate" areas of Paris. The revolutionary neighbor- hoods, in short, contained little people, many of them familiar with want, but many of them also skilled and es- tablished in their trades or businesses. This sort of ecological analysis, how- ever, concerns Soboul much less than the class composition of the sans- culotte militants. He has two questions in mind: 1) what occupational groups did they come from? 2) How much class-conscious solidarity did they dis- play? His answer to the first question is the most detailed and comprehensive ever given. In summary, it is that " . .. the avant-garde of the Parisian sans-culottes was not composed of an industrial proletariat, but of a coalition of little masters and journeymen work- 39La Roche-sur-Yon: Potier, 1958.

Even by a fairly generous definition, less than 7 % consisted of factory workers. Grocers, publicans, cabinetmakers, tailors, shoe- makers, hairdressers-these were the neighborhood revolutionaries. T h e privileged classes, the marginal, un- skilled occupations and the true prole- tarians alike seem to have been sub- stantially under-represented in their number. As for class-consciousness, Soboul's position is quite complex. Part of the discussion starts from a strict, essen- tially Marxist, definition of class, ob- serves that the sans-culottes as a whole did not fit into any such single cate- gory, and concludes that the category's "internal contradictions" (by defini- tion, it appears) prohibited any class- consciousness: "The sans-culottes, het- erogeneous in recruitment, could not therefore feel any consciousness of class" (p. 1030). At the end of the Year II, furthermore, the imposition of price and wage controls brought dis- array within the ranks of the sans- culottes, and a glimmering of class- consciousness in each of its two major divisions: " ... the opposition grew between those, artisans and merchants, who enjoyed the profit they drew from their ownership of the means of pro- duction and those, journeymen and day-laborers, who had only their wages" (p. 1029). Despite this analysis, in other sec- tions Soboul stresses the distinct and solidary outlook of the sans-culottes, their common hatred of the aristocracy and common hostility to the political ideas of the bourgeoisie. The sans- culottes were "a social element in op- position to the bourgeoisie in many re- spects. They could not change the gen- eral direction of the Revolution; none- theless they pursued their own objec- tives, often in alliance with the bour- geoisie, sometimes in opposition. The sans-culottes, like the peasants, tended beyond the ruin of the aristocracy to- ward goals which were not exactly those of the revolutionary ruling class" (p. 10). And more specifically: "Attached to the regulation and price control which characterized the old sys- tem of production and exchange, [the sans-culottes] remained hostile on the whole to the mentality of the bour- geoisie, which peopled the assemblies and administrations and would not stop until it had established the liberty favorable to its enterprises" (p. 11).41 By a looser definition, then, the sans- culottes were class-conscious in their revolutionary activity. They were intensely organized as well. Soboul presents a great variety of information on membership and participation in patriotic associations, assemblies and affairs. He finds evi- dence of an average attendance at sec- tional assemblies-the Parisian version of town meetings in its 48 sections- of from 5 to 20 percent of all those eligible to attend. Something like 10 percent of all men took an active part 40 He insists on the point-which may not dumfound any reader of this essay- partly in reply to the strongly-stated as- sertions of Daniel Guerin, La lutte de classes sous la premiere Rdpublique, Paris: Gallimard, 1946, 2 vols.

And a huge proportion had at least nominal membership. Soboul records the fever of participation: public meet- ings, clubs, discussions at the local inn, proud wearing of the liberty cap and the good sans-culotte costume, use of the familiar tu and toi, quasi-military missions, assiduous reading of news- papers, constant awareness of political issues and alignments.42 This brings up one of the most in- triguing implications of Soboul's an- alysis. In his opinion, revolutionary violence was neither an aberration nor a phenomenon distinct from "normal" political activity: "Against those who resisted unity, violence seemed to the sans-culottes to be the final recourse" (p. 576). The popular democrats openly declared their right to insurrec- tion, clung to it as a direct consequence of their sovereignty. Surely, says So- boul, the sans-culottes reached an un- forgettable exaltation during the great insurrectionary surges, and perhaps they were temperamentally more tol- erant of bloodshed than the staid bour- geois. But, on the whole, "that violence was not gratuitous. It had a political purpose and a class content" (p. 578). At the time of the sans-culottes' un- successful attempt at insurrection on 12 Germinal, Year III, one of their number declared that "the sovereign people has the right to sound the gen- eral alarm and to open its assemblies" (p. 544). True, the bourgeois used and even encouraged many of the great demonstrations and uprisings for their own purposes--the point matters a great deal to Soboul's analysis. Yet this matters, too: the insurgents were drawn especially from the political ac- tivists, and the insurrection was a con- tinuation, in an extreme form, of their everyday politics. Organization pre- cedes insurrection. If so, we might well return to the problems raised by our earlier discus- sions of the work of Labrousse and Chevalier. Do Soboul's findings permit an idea of the Revolution as a strug- gle between the old, established popu- lation of Paris and the uprooted new arrivals in the city? Only in a very limited sense, one which almost arbi- trarily gives the aristocracy and the substantial bourgeoisie temporal prior- ity over the workers of shop and studio. The findings imply very little partici- pation in either ordinary political ac- tivity or revolutionary outbursts by misfits, outcasts, nomads, the truly marginal, the desperately poor. Practic- ally the only room for doubt left on the question is in the weakness (per- fectly comprehensible) of direct in- formation on the participation of po- litical activists in violent movements. Soboul's conclusions give more sup- port to Labrousse's general contentions. He treats hunger as "the essential fac- tor in popular upheaval" (p. 439). George Lefebvre drew from Les Sans- culottes parisiens confirmation of his thesis that "the popular revolt of the spectacular revolutionary days from 1789 to the Year III surged from an- guish about daily bread."43 Questions of subsistence and price control oc- cupied a large place in the major revo- lutionary outbursts, and rapid rises in the price of bread or contractions in its supply mobilized popular discon- tent with fair regularity. Yet I wonder whether Lefebvre, and perhaps even Soboul himself, did not minimize the importance of one of Soboul's most 42Soboul himself is not so impressed with the level of participation, but that is because he constantly measures it, not against ordinary political behavior, but against what it could have been with a strictly disciplined, class-based party. In fact, the whole complex-small units of relatively skilled and established workers, muscular egalitarianism, vociferous opposi- tion, proliferation of political and para- political associations and activities-recalls unmistakably Lipset's analysis of the con- ditions for union democracy: Seymour Mar- tin Lipset et al., Union Democracy, Glen- coe: Free Press, 1956. 43 Lefebvre, op. cit., p. 170.</page><page sequence="17">Essay-Review 115 striking conclusions. The shortage of bread mobilized a population already politically conscious, active, and organ- ized. If Soboul's major conclusions are valid, it mobilized particularly those segments of the population which were most conscious, active and organized. And they were far from the most des- perate or miserable segments of the population. One might be able to say they responded to the presence of mis- ery more than to their own misery. At one point, Soboul comes close to saying just that: "At the edge of the working world, but exerting a determining in- fluence on the general population dur- ing periods of famine, there was the miserable and starving mass of the penniless" (p. 438). Maybe the pres- ence and pressure of desperate masses -whether in Labrousse's sense or Chevalier's-stimulates the politically alert portions of the population to ex- treme actions, and this explains some of the broad correspondences between change and upheaval from which both Chevalier and Labrousse have argued. Of course, the sans-culottes suffered from high prices and food shortages too, and complained about it in sharp- ly-phrased political formulas. The point is that the correlation between the amount of suffering and the amount of political response was im- perfect indeed, and that the extent of prior communication and organization accounts for some of its imperfection. Despite his concessions to hunger, then, Soboul finally supports the or- ganizational thesis concerning the re- lationship between social change and political upheaval. He assigns great im- portance to the intimacy and solidarity of the small shops and traditional crafts. He describes the proliferation of organization among the revolution- ary activists. He portrays them as highly-integrated members of their working-class society. He sees among them a substantial amount of common outlook which, when the definition is not squeezing too tightly, looks very much like class-consciousness. He al- lows for the mobilizing effects of short-range economic fluctuations, but even there his entire analysis emphasiz- es the mediation of intensely active local political organizations. Every one of these conclusions impinges directly on the major theses we have concern- ing the relationship between social change and political upheaval. Similar ideas appear in La defaite des sans-culottes, by Kare Tonnesson, which is a sequel to Soboul's work in more ways than one: it was published the year after Les sans-culottes paris- iens, it treats the following year of Parisian history, and it follows Soboul's analysis quite closely.44 La defaite des sans-culottes, however, stays closer to the chronological account and political analysis of standard historiography than the other works under consider- ation here. Just as Soboul's book can be read as an analysis of the social setting of two critical events of the Year II-the reputedly radical eco- nomic decrees of Ventose and the vio- lent reaction against Robespierre and his following in Thermidor-Tonnes- son's deals essentially with the origins and significance of the last two im- portant attempts of the Parisian sans- culottes to assert themselves: the in- surrections of Germinal and Prairial, Year III (April-May, 1795). In both cases, days of agitation over food short- ages were followed by concerted, if not highly disciplined, marches on the National Assembly, popular clashes with the troups, and repression. Many others, of course, wrote about these days before Tonnesson. He is particularly interested in reexamining the work of Tarle, the Russian his- 44 Oslo: Presses Universitaires, and Paris: Clavreuil, 1959. Given the circum- stances, it is not overly surprising that Soboul (in Revue d'histoire moderne et contemporaine, VII [Oct.-dec. 1960] p. 317) calls the book "a precious working tool, indispensable for the profound un- derstanding not only of the Year III, but of the whole of the revolutionary period."</page><page sequence="18">116 SOCIAL PROBLEMS torian of France, who declared that "these days occupy a great and forever memorable place in the history of the world proletariat, even if they were not simply proletarian uprisings . . . in the whole history of the French Revolution it is impossible to name an- other revolutionary outburst which was to such a degree . . . an insurrection of the have-nots against the haves."45 Tonnesson's conclusions, while far from denying the importance of class alignments and class conflict, reveal the profound ambiguity of Tarlk's ap- plication of the terms "workers," "plebeians" and "proletarians" to the time of Germinal and Prairial. For the essential drama of the months after Thermidor, as Tonnesson portrays them, is the continued (even accent- uated) separation of the same sans- culottes described by Soboul from the bourgeois Jacobins, and their successive weakening, repression and demoraliza- tion. In identifying the sans-culottes of the Year III, however, Tonnesson does not simply subscribe to Soboul's find- ings. For one thing, he pushes the study of variation from neighborhood to neighborhood somewhat farther. This leads him to a significant elabora- tion of an idea which only glimmers in Les sans-culottes parisiens. Problem: why were some of the faubourgs-the neighborhoods between the center of Paris and the true suburbs---continuous hosts to popular insurrection? Tonnes- son concludes a survey of the ecology of industry and indigence with this summary: If it is true that the bulk of manufactur- ing industry was established in the middle of the city, nevertheless we find the bulk of the misery-stricken on the edges. It seems to us that the social structure of the faubourg Antoine and- with local variations-those of the other faubourgs was characterized by three salient elements: a broad artisanal ele- ment-equalitarian and fiercely jealous of its independence, but economically very vulnerable in times of crisis-a mass of indigents-wage-workers, artis- ans fallen into poverty, immigrants from the countryside who had not found work permitting them to gain their liveli- hood-and a bourgeoisie small in num- ber. Under these conditions, the in- digents . . . could become the political clientele of the sans-culotte masters. The special force of the popular move- ment would then be explained by the fact that in the world of the faubourgs, the artisans and shopkeepers, who were the most active elements of the little peo- ple, occupied the position of a "social elite," a position the less contested the weaker was the bourgeoisie (p. xv). There are apparently two propositions here. Both of them express the author's fine sociological sensitivity. The first is that the activists were a working- class elite whose activity and effective- ness both expanded in the absence of direct, local competition from the bourgeoisie. The second is that the "dangerous classes," while politically ill-organized and inactive themselves, stimulated the sans-culottes to greater revolutionary activity. And it follows that food shortages and rises in prices activated the sans-culottes at least as much through the plight of their help- less "clientele" as through their own personal privations. Tonnesson has skillfully refined the basic argument of Soboul with the insights of La- brousse and Chevalier. These sensitive judgments, however, are based mainly on Tonnesson's study of political variations from section to section in Paris. They are, that is, largely inferences from ecological cor- relations. Having Soboul's findings to build on, Tonnesson devoted much less attention to the fine detail of recruit- ment and participation in everyday local politics. And he is less sanguine than some of his co-workers about the possibility of describing the social composition of the insurrections of 45 E. V.

Nevertheless, he concludes that: We find in the insurrectionary crowd the social elements which formed the heterogeneous whole of the Parisian little people. The insurrections of Ger- minal and Prairial belong, by their complex structure, to the lineage of the French Revolution's popular insurrec- tions, which the Parisian insurrections of the nineteenth century, furthermore, continued from 1830 to 1871" (p. 346). Despite this fundamental contin- uity, the Year III did bring some in- novations to the structure of popular rebellion. In a number of the secondary clashes of the periods we find a new social element: The reactionary "youngsters" (jeunes gens), said to be mainly bourgeois, largely draftdodgers, and under the control of such Thermi- dorean leaders as Freron. (This por- trait, incidentally, is so much a mirror- image of earlier hostile depictions of working-class rebels that it deserves careful verification.) Many of the dis- turbances leading up to the peaks of Germinal and Prairial began with street brawls between "youngsters" and "workers." The other innovation is the prep- aration of an insurrection from a prison. Tonnesson argues plausibly that political prisoners at Le Plessis played a large part in the planning of the Prairial rebellion (pp. 365-375). This argument adds another complexity to an already complicated analysis. For he seems to say that while an increase in misery in itself sufficed to arouse some form of rebellion among the politically sensitive sans-culottes, it took a measure of leadership and an- ticipation to produce the kind of con- cert that appeared in Prairial. Nevertheless, Tonnesson is far from returning to the old explanations of Parisian insurrection as the simple products of conspiratorial manipula- tions. If anything, he decides that there was not enough leadership "to furnish the popular insurrection with a conscious and effective direction" (p. 378). In the last analysis, he agrees with Soboul that it was the simple but overwhelming problem of subsistence that "caused the explosion of popular despair and anger" (p. 127). George Rude agrees with his co- workers on the great importance of bread. But he goes much farther than any of the other authors we have dis- cussed into the conditions, mechanisms, organization and personnel of popular rebellion. Partly because this interest aligns Rude with researchers on "So- cial movements," and partly because of his having written in English, Rud6's The Crowd in the French Revolution is much better known to American sociologists than the other works on our list.46 A synthesis and amplification of Rud6's many articles on individual political disturbances, The Crowd criticizes directly the var- ied misconceptions of popular rebel- lion in the work of Burke, Michelet, Taine, Aulard, and their successors. And it criticizes them in a novel way: by actually assembling data on partici- pation in popular rebellions. More precisely, Rud6 builds his book around the discussion-first 46 Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1959. Among Rude's many articles on re- lated subjects are "La composition sociale des insurrections parisiennes de 1789 a 1791," Annales historiques de la Revolu- tion francaise, XXIV (July-August, 1952), pp. 256-288; "The Motives of Popular In- surrections in Paris during the French Revolution," Bulletin of the Institute of Historical Research, XXVI (May, 1953), pp. 53-74; "Prices, Wages and Popular Movements in Paris during the French Revolution," Economic History Review, VI (April, 1954), pp. 246-267; "The Out- break of the French Revolution," Past and Present, VIII (November, 1955), pp. 28- 42.</page><page sequence="20">118 SOCIAL PROBLEMS roughly chronological, then analytical --of the best-known Parisian revolu- tionary Days of 1789 to 1795. The list includes the storming of the Bastille, the fetching of the king from Ver- sailles, the massacre of the Champ de Mars, the invasion of the Tuileries on the 10th of August, the insurrections of Thermidor, Germinal, Prairial and Vend6miaire, and a number of other critical events involving fairly wide- spread participation. Rude supple- ments these analyses with brief dis- cussions of popular rebellions before and after the Revolution in both Eng- land and France, a valuable precis of the social character of Paris at the eve of Revolution, and an appendix jam- med with supporting statistical data. The Crowd's principal conclusions may look a little less fresh after an exposition of the findings of Soboul and Tonnesson than they would have before. I cannot think of any major issue touched by this discussion on which the three disagree at all serious- ly. Rud6's distinctions are to have ex- panded the span of time under investi- gation and to have specialized in the phenomenon of insurrection itself. Generally speaking, he finds that the everyday political activists, the parti- cipants (but not ordinarily the lead- ers) in various popular rebellions and the solid Parisian little people were one and the same group. For the most part, they were our now-familiar tradesmen and craftsmen. Wage-earn- ers rarely predominated, true industrial workers (although they existed in con- siderable numbers in Paris) were poorly represented, and the entirely un- skilled, marginal occupations virtually absent. At the storming of the Bastille, according to Rude's evidence, there were a tiny number of bourgeois. "The rest," he remarks, " ... are almost all small tradesmen, artisans, and wage- earners. Of these, about two-thirds are small workshop masters, craftsmen, and journeymen drawn from about thirty petty trades; the remainder are engaged in manufacture, distribution, building, the professions, and general trades" (p. 57). What is true of the Bastille stands for most of the popular movements: "*... it is perhaps of interest to note the sustained militancy of certain trades such as furnishing, building, metal-work, and dress. Most conspicuous of all were the locksmiths, joiners and cabinet-mak- ers, shoemakers, and tailors; others fre- quently in evidence were stone-masons, hairdressers, and engravers; and, of those engaged in less skillful occupa- tions, wine-merchants, water-carriers, porters, cooks, and domestic servants. Workers employed in manufactories (textiles, glass, tobacco, tapestries, porce- lain) played, with the exception of the gauze-workers, a relatively inconspicuous role in these movements" (p. 185). The continuing importance of centers of small crafts like the Faubourgs Saint-Antoine and Saint-Marcel con- firms this general proposition. Of course, there were important variations from event to event. Where the ques- tion of the supply of food was most salient, women seemed to appear in greater numbers. On the only occasion on which direct conflict between work- ers and local employers seems to have been involved, wage-workers did pre- dominate. The more highly coordinat- ed, the more "political" the movement, the more the small shops seem to have gone out en masse. That is exactly what the analyses of Soboul and Ton- nesson would have led us to expect. Participation in violent outbursts and the more peaceable forms of local working-class politics reinforced and corresponded to each other. If so, Chevalier's "dangerous class- es" could not have been very active in the rebellions of 1789-95. "At the Bastille," reports Rude, "the unem- ployed country-workers, whose influx into the capital had been one of the more striking manifestations of the economic crisis which heralded the Revolution, played little or no part" (p. 180). Many of the conquerors of the Bastille had been born outside of</page><page sequence="21">Essay-Review 119 Paris, to be sure, but most of them had become settled residents of the Faubourg Saint-Antoine. If the unem- ployed and the occupants of rooming- houses sometimes figured in insurrec- tions, homeless men, criminals and men without any settled occupation were rare indeed among the rebels.47 With his colleagues, Rude attributes great influence to food shortages and rises in prices. The sans-culottes com- bined their personal demands with criticisms of the regime, and accepted or rejected proffered leadership ac- cording to political principle; never- theless "the most constant motive of popular insurrection during the Revo- lution, as in the eighteenth century as a whole, was the compelling need of the menu peuple for the provision of cheap and plentiful bread and other essentials, and the necessary ad- ministrative measures to ensure it" (p. 200).48 This response to short-term eco- nomic fluctuation is the most sig- nificant element of a more general trait of the movements Rud6 describ- ed. They were, in a rather strict sense of the word, essentially reactionary: "At every important stage of the Revolu- tion the sans-culottes intervened, not to renovate society or to remodel it after a new pattern, but to reclaim traditional rights and to uphold standards which they believed to be imperilled by the in- novations of ministers, capitalists, specu- lators, agricultural 'improvers,' or city authorities. This defensive reaction to events is a characteristic feature of each of the great journe'es that led up to or marked the progress of the Revolution" (p. 225). Their reactionary character and their social composition combine to falsify a number of widespread notions about the Parisian rebellions: that they were the direct expression of modernizing Philosophy, that they were the escape of the unbridled mob, that they were genuine precursors of proletarian re- bellion, that they displayed the solidar- ity and the identity of purpose of the Jacobins and the people of Paris. By this, Rud6 does not mean to argue that the great journees were purely spontaneous and unconnected with their political context. He shows how the Parisian social structure shap- ed its rebellions. The great outbursts grew from more usual concourses of the population--meetings in markets, sessions at the inn, orderly political demonstrations, and so on-which were transformed into violent affairs by extraordinary tensions, by what Rud6 calls panic-fear, and by conscious promotion.49 The little people develop- ed increasingly definite political ideas as the early Revolution advanced; they chose their leaders and stated their grievances in terms of those ideas. The channels through which the insurrec- tionary word circulated were essential- ly the same as those followed by the routine forms of revolutionary in- 47 Rud6 makes remarkably limited use of his rich statistical data in these and other respects. For example, his conclusions on participation in various journees are based almost entirely on simple marginal counts; he does not investigate the relationship within each of his "samples" among oc- cupation, type of participation in the re- bellion, punishment or reward received, provincial origin, residence in the city, and so on. Again, he makes no attempt to cal- culate rates of participation for different areas or social groups. Nor does he examine in any detail the covariation from section to section of participation in successive events and of the (admittedly meager) social characteristics recorded in Appendix II. 48 Rud6 treats this matter-and, in par- ticular, the covariation of food crises and popular disturbances-more amply in "Prices, Wages, and Popular Movements in Paris during the French Revolution," Economic History Review, VI (April 1954), pp. 246-267. 49 One can see here the influence of an article which has inspired Rude, Soboul and Tonnesson alike: Georges Lefebvre, "Foules r6volutionnaires," republished in Lefebvre's ltudes sur la Revolution fran- caise, Paris: Presses Universitaires de France, 1954, pp. 271-287.</page><page sequence="22">120 SOCIAL PROBLEMS doctrination. Rud6 argues, furthermore, that "each of the great political jour- nees... was the outcome of consider- able preparations" (p. 228). He seems to hesitate, however, when it comes to deciding how much importance to give to the deliberate fomentation of violence by elites with well defined political intentions. In fact, the exact place of insurrectionary leaders is an obscure point in an otherwise lucid book. It may be that by introducing the notion of panic-fear, by stressing the reactionary character of popular out- bursts, and by hesitating on the ques- tions of leadership and deliberate agi- tation, Rud6 leaves more room than Soboul or Tonnesson for both irration- ality and manipulation in the explan- ation of political upheaval. On the whole, however, he supports their con- ception of the crude rationality of popular movements. Disorders, they may have been. Aberrations, they were not. The violent popular actions of the Revolution, in Rude's view, expressed the heightened hopes and fears of ordi- nary men and women, and came into existence through approximately the same mechanisms and milieux that brought ordinary men and women in- to other forms of political activity. That general assertion tends to break our five authors-Labrousse, Chevalier, Soboul, Tonnesson, and Rude--into two groups. Labrousse and Chevalier are more inclined to depict political disturbances as extraordinary events, as discontinuities, as rents in the social fabric; the others incline to see them as natural outcomes of normal con- flicts and tensions. This is, of course, a matter of degree, not of absolute difference. Consideration of the effects of economic hardship aligns the au- thors differently; Chevalier stresses its absolute effects; Tonnesson, Soboul and Rude emphasize shorter-range fluctua- tions, while suggesting that popular political organization greatly affects the intensity of response to misery; Labrousse is probably closer to the second group than to Chevalier. As for the foci of their studies, we find Rud6 and Chevalier alike concerned with the facts of "disorder" in themselves, while the other writers are more in- terested in their context. When it comes to our central question, the character of the revolutionary crowd, Labrousse hardly commits himself, but a very wide gap opens between Chev- alier and the historians of the Revo- lution. Different questions align the authors differently. Of course, one could now attempt to explain away these differences, and thus arrive at an easy synthesis. Chev- alier writes about the period after 1815, Soboul, Rud6 and Tonnesson about the period before 1796; perhaps the conditions of political upheaval changed drastically in the interim. La- brousse is analyzing the general eco- nomic conditions for revolution; the others concern themselves with the im- pingement of specific economic depriv- ations on well-defined urban groups. And so on. I think, however, that it is more fruitful to assume that they are talking about the same phenomena, and that their divergences offer an opportunity to reexamine the major theses linking social change with po- litical upheaval. How do the major theses fare? Neither the theory nor the findings of any of the authors gives much rein- forcement to the elitist emphasis on the release of the inherently violent tendencies of the masses through the disintegration of the controlling elites. The other kind of breakdown of social controls, the uprooting of ordinary men from stabilizing norms and social at- tachments, emerges from Chevalier's analysis as an extremely potent process. But its effects are least certain precisely at the point that concerns us: the in- citement of political disturbances. Some of the observations of Soboul, Tonnesson and Chevalier may justify the hypothesis that the presence of up-</page><page sequence="23">Essay-Review 121 rooted and desperate populations en- courages the politically sensitive groups in contact with them to more extreme actions, even if the uprooted them- selves stay on the periphery of popular rebellions. Otherwise, their findings, and those of Rude, give a very small share in rebellion to the "dangerous classes." Misery apparently still loves com- pany. All the authors confirm the ex- citation of political disturbances by economic deprivation, but each with his own nuances. Labrousse presents the general connection between eco- nomic crisis and political upheaval, but finally labels the exact connection between the fact of crisis and the form -as well as, by implication, the in- cidence-of political upheaval as an unresolved problem of social psychol- ogy. Chevalier stresses the disorgan- izing effects of the continuing, grind- ing poverty brought on by rapid mod- ernization. The other writers, on the contrary, point to fluctuations in the economic situation, although they would tend to agree that the fluctua- tions mattered so much because a sub- stantial part of the population was at the minimum level of subsistence; there are strong hints in their other findings, however, that those who suf- fered most from economic fluctuations did not protest most violently. So we clearly have more research to do on the exact relationship between subsis- tence crisis and popular rebellion. Finally, the organizational thesis gains a lot of momentum in the course of these studies. They do not, to be sure, uncover a class-conscious and revolutionary struggle of oppressed workers against their employers. But they do reveal the parallelism of in- surrection and other, more peaceable, forms of political activity, to the point of suggesting that one is essentially an extension of the other. Chevalier does not, of course, reach that sort of con- clusion. Yet he does not so much dis- sent, as not discuss at all the kinds of organization that may have existed among the city's marginal inhabitants, and the relations they may have had with the "integrated" working class. Those problems are well worth in- vestigating. Once again, the discon- tinuities among the findings of our authors show the path to some new and significant research. It would be foolish to generalize the conclusions of these five authors into universal statements about the relationship of political upheaval to social change. After all, they deal mainly with one city, and little more than half a century. Nevertheless, their work contains some lessons for students of political upheaval, whether the French Revolution attracts their inter- est or not. That work raises some doubts whether broad temporal or spatial correlations between appearance of urbanization, industrialization or economic hardship and the appearance of rebellion permit the inference that those most deranged by such changes rebel most willingly. It demonstrates the utility of examining the incidence of political turbulence within a so- ciety in order to test propositions about the connection of change and turbu- lence which have ordinarily been dis- cussed in terms of variation among whole societies. It illustrates, incident- ally, how often debates among his- torians impinge on crucial sociological issues and how relevant some varieties of the historical data so neglected by sociologists are to the resolution of those issues. It proclaims the value- despite all the obvious differences be- tween the situations of currently-in- dustrializing countries and those which entered the industrial revolution a cen- tury or more ago-of referring our many formulations about the produc- tion of political upheaval in modern- ization to the accumulated records of societies whose experiences in revo- lution are already centuries old.</page></plain_text>
