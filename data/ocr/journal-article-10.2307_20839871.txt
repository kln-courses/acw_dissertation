<plain_text><page sequence="1">RIB?T TTHWTR AND THE ORIGINS OF MOROCCAN MARABOUTISM VINCENT J. CORNELL Perhaps no other word in the lexicon of North African studies has been more used, not to mention misapplied and abused, than "marabout." The term seems to appear ubiquitously in the literature and has come to symbolize all that is unique in the popular religion of the Maghrib. Yet in spite of the fact that one is likely to see marabouts in print nearly as often as one sees their domed, whitewashed tombs dotting the countryside from Casablanca to Cairo, there remains a surprising lack of agreement among scholars as to what these individuals really represent. Theoretical nuances aside, most Western scholars still build their definitions of "maraboutism" upon foundations laid by the French orientalist Alfred Bel in his famous work, La Re&amp;g?m aaa? mane en Betbe^tce.1 Working from a "stratigraphie" model of reli gious development,2 Bel postulated that the rise of maraboutism was rooted in a thirteenth-century attempt by urban religious scholars to spread their brand of theology in the countryside. This attempt at religious "consciousness raiding" supposedly foundered on the rocks of primitive Berber religion, which stressed belief in the presence of good and bad forces and magical protection against vague, malevolent spirits.* The outcome of this conflict between two spiritual worlds was a religious figure that Bel called the homrnd ^?tiche, (human fetish), often a descendant of the Prophet Muhammad, who personified a vulgar synthesis of formal religion and popular superstition. For Bel this "taboo" individual symbolized a rural Islamic populism that heralded the decline of high Muslim civilization in North Africa.* The problematic nature of a model of popular religion such as this should be self-evident in the light of recent anthro pological and historical research. The idea of a primitive Berber religious substructure easily played into the hands of colonial</page><page sequence="2">24 Islamic Studies, 27:1 (1988) administrators, who found it useful to stress a supposed unbridge able gulf between "Eastern" authoritarian Islamic traditions and "Western" democratic Berber society. The possible effects of Islamic reform movements and the relevance of sophisticated religious philosophy were trivialized by the corollary assumption that "dry" urban religious practices had no place in the "moist" affective climate of tribal peoples still living in a "state of nature."5 Perhaps the most glaring error on Bel's part was that he overlooked the often turbulent history of popular religion in his own country, and consequently missed noticing the strong similarities in the expression of faith (mentioned by the Spanish scholar As?n Palacios in Bel's own generation) in both the medieval Christian and Muslim worlds.6 More recently European and American scholars (usually anthropologists) have tended to characterize the marabout in functional terms, hoping to derive a conceptual mosaic from an analysis of the marabout's social behaviour or from the attitudes expressed by his clients. A typical example of such a combination of perceptions can be found in the work of Ernest Gellner, who defines the marabout (he uses instead the Tamazight word agutiiam) as one who: i. Possesses the appropriate descent from other marabouts and ultimately traces his supposed descent from the Prophet. ii. Possesses banakah, divine grace and approval, which manifests itself in further ways, such as: iii. material prosperity, and iv. magical powers. Moreover he is: v. generous and hospitable, conspicuously so, and above all, in a spontaneous, uncalculating manner. He is in theory: vi. pious and well-versed in Quranic matters, which... he is supposed...to exemplify automatically. vii. He is pacific. He does not fight, feud, or, by extension, litigate. viii. He secludes his womenfolk, tends not to divorce, nor gives away daughters in marriage to lay tribesmen.7 Gellner's understanding of sanctity is teleologica!: "A person is an agu/i/iam by virtue of being held to be one."8 For any anthropologist this statement is a social truism and serves to lead</page><page sequence="3">Islamic Studies, 27:1 (1988) 25 us no further in the understanding of exactly why the m?t?i?i, agut?CLm, or more commonly waZi comes to occupy his crucial interstitial social position in the first place. Ascription of charac teristics by one's client is indeed important to the continued social functions of a person perceived to be a living saint; they are, however, pcAt hoc assumptions and provide no help in under standing why the founder of a z?u?yah like Gellner's Ahansal continues to be venerated. A more carefully considered analysis is given by Dale Eickelman, who recognizes that the term muA?t?t or voaJUL overlaps with the European idea of a saint, but differentiates the two by reference to the Moroccan conception of "closeness" (qa/t?bah).9 Such an approach is useful in bridging the gap between super natural and human relations in that it postulates a correspondence or analogy between man in relation to God and man in relation to other men. Thus for Eickelman the - mut?b?t can be "tied" (a word derived from the meaning of the Arabic root labata) to man as well as to God.10 While a definition based on a key concept is analytically more useful than a simple list of perceived traits, Eickelman's attempt to define the muA?tUt remains based on the point of view of those not privy to sanctity. Since the time of Alfred Bel no scholar has seriously attempted to look back far enough into the history of rural Islam in North Africa to determine the origins of the social role played by the muA?bit or even to determine the original meaning of the word itself. This reticence has largely been due to the assumption, erroneously fostered by early French orientalists like L?vi-Proven?al, that early sources dealing with what we would today call the social history of the Maghrib ar? so rare as to make such an inquiry impossible.11 In the case of Morocco, at least, this assumption could not be more mistaken. Since its independence from France in 1956, thousands of manuscripts in both governmental and private collections have come to light and are now catalogued, many of which are devoted to describing the lives and political roles of urban and rural.religious figures. Because of this new material it is now possible for a researcher to undertake a more thorough and systematic study of Moroccan religion than was previously possible. Moroccan primary and secondary sources dealing with the history of rural Sufism reveal that the use of the term mu&amp;?bit in the sense popularized by Western social scientists, began quite late (no earlier than the late fourteenth century) and commonly occurred only by the mid-seventeenth century-coincident with the socio-political crisis that preceded the rise of the 'Alawite dynasty. The earliest synonyms for "saint" found in the literature are instead attributional in nature, being one-word descriptions of aspects of holiness: S?XJk (pious), w?t? (piously scrupulous and</page><page sequence="4">26 Islanic Studies, 27:1 (1988) inclined toward ritual purity in all aspects of life), and mutaqc^JiM? (ascetic)12. Suf? the most general term used to identify the characters in these early biographies, whether or not they belonged to an established order, or t?'i?ah, had the broadest of definitions: MThe most excellent of the scholars, the legists, the pious, the ascetics, the scrupulous, and others from among the elect."13 Even though the term mut?bty was not widely used in Morocco until relatively late in its history, the Kibdt as an insti tution was widespread. Anyone acquainted with the history of North Africa is aware of the famous rib?t founded in either Senegal or Mauritania by 'Abd Allah b. Y?s?n al-Jaz?l?, which bacarne the nucleus for the Almoravid movement. Less widely known, perhaps, is the fact that Ibn Y?sih was himself the product of Rib?t M?ssa, established on the Atlantic coast of southern Morocco not far from the present city of Agadir. The founder of Rib?t M?ssa (the original "D?r al-Mur?bitih"), Wagg?g b. Zall? al-Lamt? (d. mid-eleventh century), appears to have been the first in Morocco to use a rib?t f?r the spread of an exclusive and militant religious doctrine. Rib?t M?ssa, however, was not unique. By the time it was founded Rib?t T?t-n-Fitr was already well established on the Atlantic coast near the town of El Jedida. Other rib?t s contemporary to M?ssa were Rib?t Tlisq?wan, founded by Ab? Inn?r Abd All?h b. Wakr?s al-Mashanz?*! (known today as the town of Sidi Bennour); Rib?t Sh?kir, founded north of the present town of Chichaoua by Ab? 4 Abd All?h Muhammad al-Ragr?gi ( fi. ca. 450/1060); and Rib?t Tasamm?tat in the Ayl?n (Haylana) region near Marrakech, which was created as a satellite of ll?sq?wan. While not unique, Rib?t M?ssa was, however, anomalous, in that the rib?ts contemporary to it were neither associated with exclusivistic doctrines nor with the holy war or jihad. Indeed a fundamental characteristic of the rib?t in Morocco, unlike its military counterpart in Muslim Spain or IMq?yyah, was the complete lack of concern with jihdd stated as. such either versus Christian invaders or local heretics.1* Other than M?ssa the only /cnad-orien ted rib?t in Morocco appears to be Rib?t al-Qadam/ Rib?t al-Fath (the present capital of the country), founded as a staging area for a projected Almohad invasion of Christian Spain. The typical early Moroccan rib?t was a privately created and locally maintained institution specializing in the dissemination of religious doctrine (on this point Bel seems to have been correct, for the doctrine taught tended to be a thaVt form of Sufism emphasizing Malik? theology with an orientation toward a a a -den ), literacy (via studies of Qur'?n and rjad?th), and the modification of socially disruptive behaviour in rural areas. In a certain sense they were indeed "forward positions," in that they often served functions</page><page sequence="5">Islamic Studies, 21 (1988) 27 similar to those of cities and towns, but on a smaller scale. In the vocabulary of modern social anthropology these early rib?ts could accurately to characterized as "nodes" in networks of tribal and sub-tribal relations, strategically placed (often at former pilgrimage sites or at places considered holy in pre-Islamic times) to facilitate effective communications as well as the mobilization of economic and political resources. Fortunately for the researcher interested in the origins of this institution, the earliest example of a rib?t mentioned in Moroccan sources, Rib?t T?t-n-Fi^r, located eight kilometers south of the city of El Jedida on the DukkaLa coast, is well-documented, largely due to the existence of a late fourteenth-century biography of its saints called Bahjat al-Nazitin wa Um a - $ a WaMat Rabb al-'&amp;tanwi Uan?qib Rijal Amgh?K al-S?JUIwi by Muhammad b. *Abd al-'Azim al-Zamm?r? (d. early ninth/fifteenth century).15 Detailing the history of Tit from the time of its founding in the late fourth/tenth century until the reign of the Marinid sult?n Ab? 'In?n. F?ris in the eighth/fourteenth century, Bahjat a - a a not only mentions miraculous and pious acts, but also gives fascinating insights into the social, political and economic life of early Morocco as well as textual transcriptions of important documents. According to this account, the family of Ban? Amgh?r "marabouts" who founded Tit were descendants of the Prophet Muhammad by way of "Fatimi Husayni" lineage-the sons of Amgh?r (Shaykh) Ab? 'Uthm?n Sa'id b. Abi Zakariyya' Yahy? b. Abi Sh?kir Hamm?d b. Abi Sulaym?n D?w?d b. Abi Zakariyy?' al-IJunayf.1 ? Whether or not their origin was North African, as their name implies, or yij?z?, as the text states, there are certain indications in the narrative that they were somehow associated with Sharifian politics. The name Arngh?* itself has political overtones, being the Berber equivalent of the Arabic word ?haykh, used in the sense of tribal rather than religious leadership. Most of the accounts collected in Bahjat a -N?zVun place the origins of the founder of Rib?t Tit, Shih?b al-Din Ab? Ibrahim Ism?'?l b. Sa* id Amgh?r, in Madinah, where he was known as an ascetic and as a firm adherent of the ways of the SaJta^ aZ~S?t?h. After settling in the coastal village of Jeddah, he began to hear a voice telling him to go to the Maghrib so that his wind (invocation) and his family would be of benefit there. Finally the voice spoke to him directly: "Oh Ism?'?l, go to the Maghrib and follow the light that you see before you. Wherever that light settles in the Maghrib, there should you stay, for it shall be a plaice of taWOn."17 Accompanied by his two brothers, Ism?*?l Amgh?r travelled through the Maghrib until he reached the Atlantic coast of Morocco, following the light (significantly called a?-N?A aZ-Hoibhiml)</page><page sequence="6">28 Islande Studies, 27:1 (1988) that appeared before them until they saw it settle on an island just off the coast. Crossing over to the island at low tide, they found a clear, cold spring of water and honeycombs from which to take their sustenance. The brothers thus called the spring "The Spring of Sustenance," or 'Ayn ot-Fipi \T&amp;rn-r~ipi in the ?anh?jah Berber dialect of the region). Continuing its legendary account, the text goes on to state that the Dukk?la region of Morocco was at that time covered with low scrub and full of wild beasts including lions, who would rub themselves on Ism?'?l Amgh?r's clothes as he made his invocations. This soon came to the attention of local Gud?la ?anh?jah pastoralists who told their leader, ftbd al-Az?z b. Batt?n. Going where they indicated, he found the u)dBL in a field surrounded by a pride of lions. The chief asked him to live among the tribe but was refused, being told that the shaykh would never leave the spot where he was commanded to settle. When Ibn Battan pushed his requests to the point of threats, the ground opened up beneath his feet and held him until he apologized. An amicable, though informal, relationship with the "?anh?ja Azamm?r" was eventually established after the shaykh stepped in to settle a dispute over the use of a well and aided the tribe by providing rain during a drought.18 A number of the themes common to later stories of mut?l&gt;i?in can be found in this early legend. There is the Eastern, Sharifian origin of the founder of the ribat, common today but rare in the early sources, that bestows both holiness and legitimacy upon his descendants and their activities. There is also the association with a specific rural locality, and by extension with the tribal peoples who inhabit it, except that the shaykh, by stressing his nature as an outsider in refusing to settle among the ?anh?jah, affirms his independence and impartiality. This enables him to exercise the conflict-mediation function central to his social role, which is illustrated by the water-rights dispute. The second shaykh of Rib?t T?t-n-Fitr, Zayn al-$bid?h Ab? Ja* far Ish?q b. Ism?*?l Amgh?r, is the first for which the text of Bahjat al-H?z?t?n contains dated, factual material. The earliest of these is a decree promulgated by Tam?m b. ZM b. 'Atiyyah (the Ifr?nid ruler of Northern Morocco allied to the Umayyads of Spain) in the year 409/1018, authorizing Ab? Ja* far and his descendants to take an annual tribute from the ?anh?jah Azamm?r as upkeep for their family, servants, and associates so long as they maintain their spiritual state (hot) and do not leave for another locality.19 This clear contractual relationship between the Ban? Amgh?r saints and the tribe among whom they lived is reaffirmed in a report dated 696/1297, in which Q??l? Ab? M?s? 'Isa b. AbPl-tfasan 'Ali Amgh?r is paid ten gold dinars monthly from the tribal zak?t in return for his legal services, so long as he (again) undertakes not</page><page sequence="7">Islamic Studies, 27:1 (1988) 29 to leave *Ayn al-Fitr for another locale, not to change his state for another, and so long as he and his descendants maintain a high level of knowledge in the religious sciences.20 Also attributed to Shaykh Ab? Ja* far Isft?q Amghar is the earliest dated theological creed ('aqfdah) from a Moroccan religious figure. Supposedly written in 412/1021 in answer to comments on the nature of God addressed by a scholar from Sfax in Ifriqiyyah, it reads in part: Then you believe that [God] is One in four aspects; One without limit, One without number, One without differen tiation [it is not permissible to conceptually divide him into different aspects], and One in His Dominion. No partner has He; He is One in the attributes of Perfection - nothing has attributes like His Attributes. He is Existent in the act of creation; none other creates anything with Him. His Attributes are pr?existent. His Speech is with voices, not dependent upon a (physical) tongue or sounds. He sees without the physical eye or...(gap in text). He te the Knower of All without physical mind or heart; Exalted above the existence of opposites or progeny; free from likeness to physical bodies. He makes miracles appear at the hands of His Messengers and makes them indicators [pointing] to His various ways. Prosperous is the one who believes in all of them in order to affirm the Truth and who follows their laws in order to firmly establish himself. 1 counsel you to believe in God the Almighty and to beware not to be excessive in external devotion while ignor ing the inner life; for the work of the inner spirit is more excellent than that of the outward. The example [to follow] and the group [with which to identify] is that of the Companions [of the Prophet], may God be pleased with all of them.21 In the context of Moroccan religious culture, an 'aqXdah characteristically takes the form of a quasi-legal document. It serves as a sort of position paper or formal statement of theological and ethical principles, clearly defining what its writer claims to represent. Its use by religious reformers and ?uf?s was especially common, in that for the former it served as a succinct religio-political manifesto and for the latter a justification of orthodoxy. Literally scores of these creeds can be found today in Moroccan manuscript collections and can be very valuable to one interested in the political implications of theology. The above fragment of Ab? Ja* far Isfo?q's *aqtdah is Ash*arite in tone and appears at variance with the anthropomorphic M?lik? theology espoused by the Almoravids, who took power around the time of his death.</page><page sequence="8">30 Islamic Studies, 27:1 (1988) Ab? Ja'far Amgh?r was further noted, according to the text of Bahjat at-Ndzit?n, as the builder of the physical complex of Rib?t T?t-n-Fitr. We are told that until the year 419/1027-28 he lived with his family and entourage in dwellings clustered around his father's tomb. During that year, however, famine and unrest caused by wars between the ?anh?jah Berbers and Barghw?ta Masm?dah heretics living in the T?masn? and Za'ir regions near the modern city of Rabat caused the shaykh and his family to flee south to a spot on the Dukk?la coast called lyyir. There he formally began to teach students and to invite the locals to "believe in God and follow the Mnnak of the Prophet."22 While a great number apparently followed his teachings, an equally significant number opposed him, and the shaykh was forced to return to 'Ayn al-Fitr sooner than expected. It was after this return from lyyir that Ab? Ja'far decided to develop and fortify the site of Tit so as to preclude the need for further flight. After clearing away the low scrub plants that covered the area he built a mosque next to his house, where his tomb stands today. Eventually a larger number of the ?anh?jah Azamm?r settled near him, so to provide the immigrants with water he dug the famous well called "Timkid?t" fed by the .holy spring and providing water up to the present. At an unspecified later date Ab? Ja'far built a Friday mcsque (ma?jid al-jaml'} next to the well. The main structure, built of stone and driftwood, has long since collapsed, but its cut-stone minaret, the oldest privately-built religious structure now extant in Morocco, still stands where it was built.23 Sometime around the year 475/1083, Ab?'l Budal?' Rukn al-Din Ab? 'Abd All?h Muhammad b. Ish?q Amgh?r succeeded his father as paramount shaykh of Rib?t Tit-n-Fitr. Acknowledged throughout Morocco as one of the greatest religious figures of his age, he was famed for his knowledge of the Qur'?n and ability in its commentary. Along with his son, Ab? 'Abd al-Kh?liq ' AM al-'Az,?m, he is credited in indigenous sources with founding the earliest specifically named Moroccan ??f? order, the Sanh?jiyyah, mentioned by the late eighth / fourteenth-century traveller and religious scholar Ibn Qunfudh as one of the five major Moroccan orders [t?'^ah?? extant during the apogee of Marinid political power.lh As the name "?anh?jiyyah" implies, membership in tl\e Ta^ah based at Tit had a strong ethnic basis, and seems to have been virtually obligatory for all religious Berbers of ?anh?jah stock for nearly four hundred years, until the temporary destruction and abandonment of the rib?t at the hands of the Portuguese in the sixteenth century. As late as the mid-fifteenth century, one of the greatest of Moroccan ??f?s, Muhammad b. Sul?ym?n al-Jaz?lx (the Gaz?la are a collection of ?anh?ja Berbers living in the Atlas foothills north of the River S?s), traced his spiritual lineage through the then reigning shaykh of Rib?t Tit.</page><page sequence="9">Islamic Studies,.27:1 (1988) 31 There is no question but that the ?anh?ja Almoravid rulers of Morocco regarded Ab? 4Abd Allah Amgh?r as the religious spokesman for their cousins north of the Sahara desert. The author of Bahjat a -U?z?Kox reports that just prior to the year 522/1128 4Ali b. Y?suf b. T?shfin had his vizier Ab?'l-Walid b. Rushd (the grandfather of the famous philosopher) wrote to the shaykh soliciting his blessings for the proposed construction of the walls of Marrakash.25 Another letter, date 527/1133, in the name of "Am?r al-Muslim?n N??ir al-D?n 4All b. Y?suf b. T?shfin," mentions with approval the shaykh's Prophetic lineage and asks again for his blessing and support, probably against the nascent Almohad movement. Significantly perhaps, when all the Shaykhs and AuJ?ik?9 of Morocco were called to a meeting before the Sulf?n in Marrakash, "Ab? 4Abd All?h al-Shar?f" refused, citing an "extreme lack of care for the world."26 We later find that the shaykh's son enjoyed a close relationship with the Almohad ruler Ya4q?b al-Man??r, who gave him financial support and allowed him to intercede on behalf of those who sought his help.27 Coupled with the theological nature of the *aq&lt;dak of Ab? Ja4 far Amgh?r quoted above, information such as this leads, at least circumstantially, to the conclusion that Rib?t Trf may have been prominent in the general support given by Moroccan and Andalusian ??f?s for the Almohad cause. Although we can no longer get a complete picture of the spiritual method of the T?'i&amp;ah aZ-Scinliajiyyah, a skeletal outline is provided by a number of contemporary sources. We know, for example, that Ab? 4Abd All?h Amgh?r was a firm adherent of the M?lik? school of Jurisprudence. It is said that he read part of Saljnun's Mudawwana al~&gt;KubnA every day, and that, like his father and grandfather before him, he stressed firm adherence to the example of the Salai a - . This attitude is consistent with the then popular Moroccan ??f? trend away from speculative theology and toward a "pristine" u^??-oriented M?likl orthodoxy.2* The ??f? method of the ?anh?jiyyah appears to have been strongly ascetic and mor/fe attuned to the pietism of figures like al-rjasan al-Ba?r? than to the practices of Philosophical ??f?s in the contemporary twelfth-century Muslim East. We know that the shaykh's own activities included a concentration on spiritual retreat (khatuoak), mortification of the lower soul [mujahadahi, fre quent fasting, and extreme care in the amount, type, and origin of food taken into the body (like many Moroccan ??f?s of the day Ab? 4Abd All?h Amgh?r restricted his diet to leaves of trees, "allowable plants of the earth," and fish from the sea).29 From his son and successor Ab? 4Abd al-Kh?liq 4Abd al-4Az?m (fi. ca. 550/1152) we learn that along with his elder friend Ab? Shu4ayb Ayy?b al-?anh?l? (the famous "S?d? B?sh4ayb" of Dukk?la and putative founder of Rib?t Azamm?r) the shaykh required from</page><page sequence="10">32 Islamic Studies, 27:1 (1988) his followers adherence to ten commandments known as the "Rules of Companionship" [ShuA?t a -Suhbah): 1. Avoidance of controversy among the mu/udin and others. 2. Justice. 3. The obligation of noble character [Jhiz?m oJi-Wj&amp;l). 4. Constancy and satisfaction with what God provides. 5. Forgiveness of the harmful acts of others. 6. Preservation of transcendent realities from the un initiated. 7. Concealment of the sins of others. 8. Forgetfulness of the need to have the last answer in a dispute. 9. Satisfaction with what comes to one most easily. 10. The eating of what is found close at hand.30 The significance of the greatest shaykh of Rib?{ T?t-n-Fitr to the development of Moroccan ??fism can hardly be underestimated. Apart from his friendship with Ab? Shu'ayb of Azamm?r, Ab? 'Abd Allah Amgh?r was also known to have been in contact with the greatest ??f?s and formal religious scholars of his own and his son's generation. These included Ab? Ya'z? Yalann?r b. Maym?n (S?d? B? *Azz?) the great "marabout" of the Middle Atlas; Ab? 'Isa Wazg?g al-Dukk?li; Ab? Muhammad ??lih b. Yantaran al-M?giri (founder of Rib?t ?safi and initiator of the "Hujj?j" movement that opened a permanent exchange between Morocco and the Muslim East); the great M?liki legist Ab? Bakr b. al-'Arabi (who wrote a book for the shaykh called St&amp;?j at-Muktadw $c Addb aZ'S?W?tn); and Q??l? 'ly??l b. M?s? al-Yahi?ubi, author of the famous' K?t?b al-Shi^d9 U Huqaq al-MuMaid}1 The text of Bahjat aZ-Ndz?un also indicates that the shaykh inaugurated an exchange of ideas between ??fis in 'Iraq and Morocco, and that after 'his death a delegation from Yemen came to visit his tomb.32 Although the point is not made directly, Moroccan manuscripts mentioning Rib?t T?t-n-Fitt leave the distinct impression that it was regarded as a model for other rib?ts and that its shaykhs were seen as the quintessential mti??bt?cn. The kunyah of Ab? 'Abd Allah Amgh?r, "Ab?'l-Budal?," indicates this perceived centrality in that seven of his descendants were regarded by other ??f?s as badil (substitute)- those shaykhs from whom the Axis of the Age, or Qutb is selected. To this day in Dukk?la qa?tdahb are sung recounting the glories of the Amgh?n?yy?n and lamenting the lost grace that resulted from the downfall of this most ancient and noble of Moroccan rib?^s. What can the example of Rib?t T?t-n-Fitr tell Western scholars about the nature of Moroccan "maraboutism" in general? First of all, one can find many of the popular themes of later</page><page sequence="11">Islamic Studies, 27:1 (1988) 33 maraboutism prefigured in the historical accounts and legendary tales about the rib?t and its founder. The shaykh of Tit clearly served as a figure of authority in a segmentary society. Because he was a "disinterested" outsider linked to the surrounding tribal peoples only through marriage ( a rather weak link in a situation of strong patrilineality), he could perform functions of conflict mediation and even dispense formal justice with state backing. The existence of the formal post of q?dZ at Tit indicates that rather than representing an ad hoc form of rural religion as Gellner and others seem to believe, the mu??t?t could just as well serve as a point man in the projection of formal, "orthodox" Islam in tribal areas. The indigenous sources make indisputably clear that the shaykhs of Rib?t T?t-n-Fitr in its heyday were anything but the marginally educated rural opportunists that are found in recent anthropological literature. This latter impression, though perhaps accurate in describing the shaykhs of a rural zauuyah in decline, all too easily obscures the vital and progressive educational role played by major rib?ts in Moroccan cultural history. Abu *Abd Allah Amgh?r, his father, and descendants were clearly intellectuals, and as such could hold their own among the greatest scholars of their day. Another popular theme represented at Tit is that of inherent nobility, represented by Sharifian ancestry. A scholar acquainted with Moroccan history since the eighteenth century may find it surprising that very few early ??f?s ever bothered to make such claims. The idea that a Prophetic lineage is central to religious legitimacy was an innovative idea in Morocco before the arrival of the Ban? Hil?l Arabs and thus provides a certain teleological proof of the Bani Amgh?r's claim. In the eighth/fourteenth century the n?bah of the Amgh?riyy?n given in this text suddenly changes and becomes Hasanid and Idrisid- replacing probable fact by legend and eliminating a possibly embarrassing schismatic F?timid association by the substitution of a more proper genealogical orthodoxy.'3 Noble lineage, however, is not the only, or even the most important factor in the perception of sanctity by the uninitiated. Noble character must be present as a necessary complement as well. A European or American social scientist, faced with assessing "character" as a variable, and unacquainted with the subtleties of a mystical tradition long embedded in a foreign culture, is often unable to pinpoint the exact reasons why a person is regarded as noble by others in his society and thus is prone to indulging in speculative analyses that to Moroccans sound as ridiculous as those given by early travellers or Barbary Company traders. While not consciously expressed, the parameters of sanctity are usually understood from stories and orally transmitted experiences passed on over many generations. As Ernest Gellner implicitly acknowledges by presenting his own definitional list, saintly character is often evaluated locally by means of a checklist of attributes, the</page><page sequence="12">34 Islamic Studies, 27:1 (1988) totality of which, combined with accounts of miraculous or paranormal events (the common Moroccan term for a saintly miracle is khafiq aJ?-'?dah?"rendering custom asunder"), allows one to be called a voaJ?L or saint. Such a checklist can be found in the combination of Ab? *Abd Allah Amgh?r's specific personal qualities (knowledge of the Qur'?n, knowledge of law, spiritual retreat, mor tification, and extreme concern with purity) and his ten Shuti?t aZ-Suhbah. While no list of traits or attributes is by itself sufficient to define a phenomenon like sanctity, one generate by the muMbt?w themselves at least provides a greater correspondence with and understanding of the perceptions of those within Moroccan culture and creates a partial bridge between the ideas of the initiated and the uninitiated. The most important aspect of maraboutism illustrated by the example of Tit-n-FiJr, indeed perhaps the fundamental idea implicit in the term mu/i?bit itself, can be found both expressed and implied in the decree of Tamim b. Ziri formally affirming the local authority of Ab? Ja* far Ish?q Amgh?r. The fact is often overlooked that a fundamental difference between the mut?biZ and the Su?c is that while every mut?bit is associated in some way with ??fism, either as a practitioner or as a descendant, not every ??f? can be a muM?K?. On the most simple level the reason for this is that the muJt?b?t is always a rural figure - the "semiofficial" representative of rural ??fism. The fact that he performs his role in the countryside means by extension that his social role must correspond to the social structure of the people among whom he lives. In a very real way his status, function, and sanctity depend on the continued acceptance of him by tribal peoples often much less sophisticated than he is. The muA?bit thus finds himself "bound" hand and foot in a symbiotic relationship with both a locality and a tribe. This relationship is expressed, either formally or informally, as a "social contract" in which a saint (in our case Ab? Ja* far Amgh?r) undertakes to provide certain services for a tribe (here the ?anh?ja Azamm?r), for which he can take a share of their zak?t, so long as he maintains, or is seen to maintain, his sanctity and does not leave for another locality. Leaving was indeed out of the question for the Ban? Amgh?r mut?bt?cn, for the founding fathers of the ?anh?jiyyah ??f? order could have no Ha??O? a' without th? ?anh?ja Berbers. By the logic of a mutual identification between a tribe and "its" saints such as this, it is easy to see how over time actual sanctity can become less important than attributional sanctity, and how, under the weight of years of habit reinforced by tradition, a family could be regarded as "saintly" even if its actions were less than pure. Thus, far from being "tied" to God or the jihad as French colonial scholars and those influenced by them have assumed, the muA?t?t is "tied" instead, even according to his own frame of reference, to a particular rural social structure defined in spatial</page><page sequence="13">Islamic Studies, 27:1 (1988) 35 terms. When,, in the case of the Amgh?rlyy?n, this tie was broken by the displacement of the Gud?la ?anh?ja by Arab tribes in the fourteenth century, the shaykhs of Rib?t T?t-n-Pip: had to look farther afield, to the Sanh?ja of Gaz?la, for their followers. In discussions of the period nearly contemporary to the composition of Bahjdt al-Nazit?n references to the "?anh?ja Azamm?r" largely disappear, and names of individuals associated with the rib?{ more moften than not bear the tribal/regional designation "al-Jaz?lL" When the link to even Gaz?la was broken by the Portuguese occupation of Dukk?la and the dispersion of the Amgh?rlyy?n in the sixteenth century, the surviving saints- of %, rather than being able to reassert their local dominance, found themselves swept up instead by their former followers and identified themselves with the quasi-nationalisti? jaz?liyyah ??f? order-which had by then become so all embracing as to exclusively represent the ??f? tradition in Morocco. As ?anh?jah identity became irrelevant, so did the "?anh?jiyy?n," and the greatest and longest-lasting rib?t in Moroccan history fell to the status of a pilgrimage centre of purely local import.
