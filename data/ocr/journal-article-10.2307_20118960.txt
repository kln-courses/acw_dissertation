<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Supernatural Persistence of the Past in Los d?as enmascarados [The Masked Days) by Carlos Fuentes ANTHONY JULIO CICCONE Carlos Fuentes, the brilliantly successful Mexican author, is a novelist, playwright and short-story writer. In the period of fifteen years, 1949-64, he wrote seventeen shorter narratives. Besides his two collections, Los d?as enmascarados (1954) [The Masked Days] and Cantar de ciegos (1964) [Song of the Blind], he published four uncollected stories: "Pastel rancio" ["Rancid Pastry"] , "Pantera en jazz" ["Panther in Jazz"] , "El mu?eco" ["The Doll"] , and "Trigo errante" ["Errant Wheat"] . These works, written between 1949-57, the era before Los d?as enmascarados (1954) and that im mediately preceding La regi?n m?s transparente (1958) [Where the Air is Clear], have never been incorporated into an anthology. "Pastel rancio, ' ' published on November 26, 1949 l in the newspaper, Ma?ana, deals with a son's rejection of his Jewish mother, whereas "Pantera en jazz," which appeared six months before Los d?as enmascarados,2 presents the nightmarish situation of a young man who believes he has been transformed into a panther. In a different vein, "El mu?eco," written in 1956,3 depicts the plight of the mad Empress, Carlota. Lastly, "Trigo errante," which was published six months later,4 portrays the cyclical existence of the Biblical character, Lazarus, after his resurrection by Christ. These four tales represent an experimental period in the author's career. Much of the thematic and technical material which he introduces in these narratives will be employed, in more complex form, in subsequent works. Hence, we notice that the theme of familial discord, which was present in his first story, is accorded a greater importance in Cantar de ciegos (1964) and in Zona sagrada (1957) [Home Base]. Similarly, "Pantera en jazz," introduces a type of protagonist who will become progressively more significant in Fuentes' art, namely, the unmarried protagonist whose emotional unfulfillment engenders psychological maladjustment, an unreliability of perception and a tendency to over-indulge in fantasy. "El mu?eco, " in effect, is the thematic precursor to "Tlactocatzine, del jard?n 'Carlos Fuentes, "Pastel rancio," Ma?ana, XXVI, 326 (26 de noviembre 1949), 226-27. 2 Carlos Fuentes, "Pantera en jazz," Ideas de M?xico,! ,3 (enero-febrero, 1954), 119-24.

Finally, the topic of cyclical reincarnation, found in "Trigo errante, ' ' is essential to the description of the fantastic occurrences in Los d?as enmascarados, in Aura and in Cumplea?os (1969) [Birthday] . The six stories of Fuentes' first collection, Los d?as enmascarados (1954),may be divided into two categories. In the first classification we find three tales which may be considered social parodies. They are: "Letan?a de la orqu?dea" ["Orchid Litany"] , which explores the problem of human greed, "El que invent? la p?lvora" ["Explosive Invention"] , a parody of our ultra-modern, technological time, and "En defensa de la Trigolobia' '["In Defense of Trigolobia' '], which satirizes the vacuity of political rhetoric. The three remaining narratives depict the fantastic persistence of the past in twen tieth-century Mexico. In referring to these stories Fuentes maintains that: "Son cuentos fant?sticos, (...) en que relato la reaparici?n de las formas extintas, ocultas en el subsuelo' '5 [Theyare fantasticsto-ies, (...) in which I relate the reappearance of extinct forms, hidden in the substratum.] Critics, in turn, often suggest that the title, Los d?as enmascarados, demonstrates the author's preoccupation with the Pre-Cortesian indigenous past of Mexico: " 'cinco enmascarados /con pencas de maguey,' hab?a dicho el poeta Tablada. Cinco d?as sin nombre, d?as vac?os durante los cuales se suspend?a toda actividad-fr?gil puente entre el fin de un a?o y el comienzo de otro--. En el esp?ritu de Fuentes, sin duda, la expresi?n tiene adem?s un sentido de interrogaci?n y de escarnio: ?qu? hay detr?s de las m?scaras? " 6?" * five days masked by maguey leaves,' the poet Tablada had said. Five unnamed days in which all activity was suspended--a fragile bridge between the end of one year and the beginning of another--. Undoubtedly, in Fuentes' tradition, the title further suggests an aggressive questioning of, What is there behind the masks?"] Thus, the supernatural survival of the Pre-Hispanic era is presented in "Chac Mool" and in "Por boca de los dioses" ["By the Gods' Mouth"]. On the other hand, "Tlactocatzine, del jard?n de Flandes," is concerned with the continuation of the nineteenth-century epoch in modern-day Mexico. In the course of this critical study, significant attention will be accorded to the artistic techniques of narrative person, time and space. Consideration will be given as to the ef ficacy of these techniques in evoking the literary fantasy of supernatural reincarnation found in these stories. Since the element of reality-irreality is a recurrent concern in much of Fuentes' art, an analysis of it in these three tales will provide an essential insight into this aspect of his art. The three works to be considered, "Chac Mool," "Por boca de los dioses" and "Tlactocatzine, del jard?n de Flandes," share certain characteristics. All have a first person narrator who is a bachelor. The action of all of them takes place in Mexico City. "Chac Mool" and "Tlactocatzine, del jard?n de Flandes" are related in a diary form. The space in all three has psychological significance for the narrator and the place becomes a point of convergence for diverse temporal and spatial realms. This point may be termed a zona sagrada: a "site" which is not divorced from time. At the end of each story the narrator is trapped in this closed spatial locus. In all three, especially in "Chac Mool' ' and 5 Victor M. Valenzuela, ' 'Carlos Fuentes : novelista mexicano, " La voz, 2 diciembre 1962, 10. Anonymous, "Presencia de Carlos Fuentes en Italia," Siempre, 24 de mayo de 1967, iv.</page><page sequence="3">The Supernatural Persistence of the Past 39 in "Tlactocatzine, del jard?n de Flandes," there is the use of calendar chronology to suggest logical order. While implying a conventional conception of time, other elements are working which subvert the temporal scheme. Thus, the reader is led to conclude the illogical through the distortion of the logical. Fuentes' first concern when dealing with space is place, and often in his works he mentions a specific site as a focal point. As such, a certain location may possess specific historic significance. In other instances, its significance is not historical; nonetheless, it is integral to the development of artistic fantasy as a form of aleph:7 a meeting zone for diverse temporal and spatial realms. This aleph would include that space which may be designated as ordinary and which is the site for logical actions. Oddly enough, the aleph would, conversely and concurrently, be the location of the extraordinary space in which fantastic events occur. Of all the stories in Los d?as enmascarados, "Chac Mool' ' is the best known and most widely commented. Fuentes recalls that the inspiration for it came from a newspaper account in 1952. It told of the events surrounding the shipment of the Aztec idol, the rain god Chac Mool, to Europe. In its transatlantic voyage it supposedly engendered many storms. This led the author to conclude : * * Los datos de la nota roja art?stica enfocaron mi atenci?n en un hecho evidente para todos los mexicanos : hasta qu? grado siguen vivas las formas cosmol?gicas de un M?xico perdido para siempre y que, sin embargo, se resiste a morir y se manifiesta, de tarde en tarde, a trav?s de un misterio, una aparici?n, un reflejo. La an?cdota gira en torno a la persistencia de nuestras viejas formas de vida',8f'The ac counts focused my artistic attention upon a fact evident to all Mexicans : to what extent do the cosmological characteristics of a bygone Mexico survive and become manifest through a phenomenon, an apparition or a reflection. The tale is concerned with the persistence of our ancient modes of life."] "Chac Mool' ' relates incidents in the life of Filiberto, the principal character and one of the story's two narrators, who has unexpectedly drowned in Acapulco during Holy Week. Filiberto's friend goes there in order to bring the body back to Mexico City. In the course of the return trip, he decides to read Filiberto's diary. In it Filiberto relates that he bought a statue of the Aztec god Chac Mool in the Lagunilla market. He placed it in the basement of his house.By causing a series of floods in the basement, Chac Mool manages to surround himself with water, his natural element, and thereby to regain life. Once alive he becomes Filiberto's tyrannical master. Filiberto attempts to escape to Acapulco, which results in his death by drowning. His friend believes that the diary represents the record of an insane individual who has committed suicide. Upon arriving at Filiberto's house he is met by the reincarnated Chac Mool, who tells him to have the corpse placed in the basement. The thematic premise of "Chac Mool, ' ' the omnipresence of the Pre-Cortesian Aztec past in modern-day Mexico, is demonstrated by the fantastic revival of the Aztec god, Chac Mool. The artistic use of point of view, space and time are essential to the development of this fantastic literary topic. 7 Ronald J.

The first is Filiberto's friend, who recounts his own impressions of Filiberto and whose narration furnishes an artistic frame in which the events described in the character's diary are in terpolated. Thus, the friend's narrative accounts encompass Filiberto's presenting a perspective of paralleling verosimilitude to Filiberto's implied fantasy. His possible in sanity, hence unreliability as a narrator, is alluded to in various instances.9 Thus, if Filiberto is mistaken in his sense of perception, what he relates is equally erroneous. The first suggestion of the personage's dubious sense of perception, engendered by emotional traumas, is contained in the early part of his diary. The character has reached forty years of age and senses that at this point he has uncontrollably started to decline. He confesses a sense of bewildered estrangement from his surroundings and past : ' 'Desfilaron los a?os de las grandes ilusiones, de los pron?sticos felices, y, tambi?n, todas las omisiones que impidieron su realizaci?n. Sent? la angustia de no poder meter los dedos en el pasado y pegar los trozos de alg?n rompecabezas abandonado:..." 10{"The years passed of grand schemes, of happy predictions and of all omissions which hindered success. I felt the anguish of not being able to grasp the past and thus collate the pieces of some discarded jigsaw puzzle."] This is the first of a series of references to Filiberto's preoccupation with the past. Previously, he had expressed his memories of adolescence, a segment of his life which presented ample opportunities for friendship and fantasizing about the future. At mid dle age, however, Filiberto is practically alone in life, possessing only a few friends. Moreover, he readily concedes that he has not attained any considerable degree of success in his career. Sensing himself as an alienated, mediocre individual, the character directs his fantasy away from the future and develops a consuming interest in the Aztec past of Mexico. In the ancient Mexican era Filiberto finds the solace which is denied him in his lonely bachelorhood. He relates that one of his friends, aware of his interest in this area, observed that Christianity in Mexico is tantamount to ritualized Aztec religion as Filiberto himself confirms in his declaration: "Pepe conoc?a mi afici?n, desde joven, por ciertas formas de arte ind?gena mexicano. Yo colecciono estatuillas, ?dolos, cacharros. Mis fines de semana los paso en Tlaxcala, o en Teotihuac?n" (p. 19) ["Pepe knew of my fondness, since my youth, for certain forms of indigenous Mexican art. I collect figurines, idols and pottery. I spend my weekends in Tlaxcala or Teotihuacan. "] Indeed, his involvement even evokes in him a feeling of guilt: ''su mueca parece reprocharme que le niegue la luz' ' (p. 20) [' ' ...his grin seems to reproach me for denying him light' ']. His anthropomorphic transformation of the statue is further revealed in subsequent entries in the diary in which he describes it as emitting cries during the night, of developing a flesh-like quality, and of acquiring hair on its body. Throughout his entries Filiberto 9 Wayne C. Booth maintains that an unreliable narrator is one who does not speak in accordance with the norms of the work. Such a narrator may believe that he has certain qualities which the author chooses to deny him. Therefore, what an unreliable narrator chooses to relate may be likewise fallacious. Wayne C. Booth, The Rhetoric of Fiction (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1961), p. 159. 10 Carlos Fuentes, Los d?as enmascarados (Mexico: Los Presentes, 1954), p. 18. (All references are to this edition.)</page><page sequence="5">The Supernatural Persistence of the Past 41 expresses his misgivings regarding his own powers of objective observation when in fluenced by his imagination. His friend notices, while reading the diary, that there is a segment which contains no entry for three days. After this lapse, an account appears written in a child-like scrawl: "Hasta hace tres d?as, mi realidad lo era al grado de haberse borrado lo que era movimiento, reflejo, rutina, memoria, cartapacio. Y luego, como la tierra que un d?a tiembla para que recordemos su poder,o la muerte que llegar?, recriminando mi olvido de toda la vida, se presenta otra realidad que sab?amos que estaba all?, mostrenca, y que debe sacudirnos para hacerse viva y presente. Cre?a, nuevamente, que era imaginaci?n; el Chac Mool, (...) parec?a indicarme que era un dios,..."(p. 23)f"Even upuntil three days ago my reality had erased that which was movement, reflex, routine, memory, and memorandum. And then, like the earth which one day quakes to remind us of its power, or death which recriminates my life-long disregard of its inevitability, another unfettered reality, which we knew existed, presents itself and jolts us in order to gain life and presence. Once again, I believed that it was my imagination: Chac Mool, (...) seemed to indicate to me that he was a god,..."]. Thus, we see Filiberto's estrangement from conventional foci of reality. In his mind the statue of Chac Mool is transformed into an actual fantastic entity which he regards as his tyrannical master and which serves ironically to fill the void of solitude in his life. The site for the fantastic reincarnation of Chac Mool is Filiberto's home. It represents what might be designated as a zona sagrada, a location integral to this fantastic occurrence. The house may be described as poetic space, that is, an area whose significance and extent are determined by perception of the individual. Gaston Bachelard defines the concept in this manner: "Space that has been seized upon by the imagination cannot remain indifferent space subject to the measures and estimates of the surveyor. It has been lived in not in its positivity, but with all the partiality of the imagination. Particularly, it nearly always exercises an attraction. For it con centrates being within limits that protect. ' ' n The space of the house as perceived by Filiberto is vital to the fantastic reincarnation of Chac Mool. In describing his home Filiberto says that its mournful appearance and architecture are reminiscent of the Porfirio Diaz era. The enormity of the house and its occupation by the lonely personage serve to remind him of his personal past with his parents, a contrasting and more felicitous portion of his life. As such, he is psychologically dependent upon the house and cannot or will not leave it. Its anachronistic semblance serves not only as a constant reminder of bygone years but also as a visible ambience for temporal regression. In the house's zona sagrada the convergence of temporal and spatial planes is possible. Initially, the house may remind Filiberto of the pre-Revolutionary past of his parents, and thus gratify his psychological dependence on that realm. However, by placing the statue of Chac Mool in the basement, Filiberto has projected his temporal preoccupations further into the past. In effect, he has accorded his home the aura of the Aztec temples Gaston Bachelard, The Poetics of Space, trans. Maria Jolas (Boston: Beacon Press, 1st ed. 1969), p. 22.</page><page sequence="6">42 LATIN AMERICAN LITERARY REVIEW which he visited at Tlaxcala and Teotihuac?n. Now the space of the basement becomes influenced by the conception which he had previously formed of the Aztec gods. Since he placed Chac Mool in the basement and since the cellar invariably symbolizes the site of illogical actions and repressed evil, it is only appropriate that the inhabitant of that realm be equally malevolent.12 Filiberto's room, in contrast, located at the top of the stairs, represents the realm of Reason. Therefore, when the personage relates that Chac Mool has taken up residence in his bedroom, the implication is that Evil has proven more powerful than Reason and has achieved dominance. Once in control, Chac Mool may proceed to convert the house into an Aztec temple. According to Filiberto, this is ac complished by intermittent floodings of the house, by animal bones strewn in the bedroom, and by the constant odor of blood and incense. Chac Mool, as the god of rain, controls water in all its forms. Hence, he may cause a water pipe to burst or a sewer to flood his temple. His control of water extends far beyond the limits of his temple as evidenced by an incident in Filiberto's office in which: "Un guas?n pint? de rojo el agua del garraf?n en la oficina, con la consiguiente perturbaci?n de los labores. He debido consignarlo al director, a quien s?lo le dio mucha risa. El culpable se ha valido de esta oportunidad para hacer sarcasmos a mis costillas el d?a entero, todos en torno al agua.Ch,...!"(p. 19)["A prankster threw red coloring in the office water cooler, resulting in the workers' excitement. I had to report it to the boss who only laughed a lot. The culprit, and all of them around the water cooler, took advantage of this opportunity to make snide remarks behind my back all day long. Ch,...!"]The incident is significant in several respects. Firstly, it serves to introduce the motif of water which is recurrent in this story, specifically water as aligned with spatial coordinates: in the office's water cooler, the house's basement, and the plaza's public fountain. Also, Chac Mool floods Filiberto's house with water and the latter ultimately drowns while swimming in Acapulco. Both of these are instances of water in spatial contexts. Moreover, the fact that the water is red within the cooler serves as a foreshadowing of Filiberto's unexpected death in an equally enclosed bay of water in Acapulco. By closed spaces we mean enclosed areas which imply confinement. Filiberto's escape to Acapulco is an instance of a closed space, a circular journey, inasmuch as he is ultimately brought back to Mexico City. Conversely, his sense of solitude and alienation is another instance of closed space: an individual living within the boundaries of his own being and deprived of significant psychological relationships. In "Chac Mool" there is an inherent ambiguity between closed and open spaces. Open spaces are those which permit freedom from any predetermined course. Ironically, in this story closed spaces proffer freedom and openness while concealing their inevitable con finement. Thus, the closed space of the house is transformed from a human abode into the fantastic dwelling of an Aztec god, through Filiberto's imaginative powers, his knowledge of and interest in indigenous culture and his psychological dependence on the past, thereby effecting the change. The time element of this story functions less conspicuously than that of space. The diary, in one respect, suggests a linear, calendar progression of time covering a span of 12 Ibid., p. 18. 13 Ibid., p. 19.</page><page sequence="7">The Supernatural Persistence of the Past 43 several months from Chac Mool's purchase to Filiberto's death. In contrast to this con ventional temporal pattern, there is a regressive temporal plan. This is presented in the form of the character's intense interest in all segments of the past. In direct opposition to the time spent at his job is that of his leisure, which focuses upon an ancient era. The coexistence of these two disparate times in Filiberto's mind is essential to the concurrency necessary for Chac Mool's reincarnation. Again the inherent ambiguity between the two realms of past and present ultimately allows the former to achieve dominance in Filiberto's perception. Hence Chac Mool's fantastic reincarnation is a result of the omnipresent past which Filiberto causes to regain life through his imaginative complicity. The next story whose thematic premise is the supernatural survival of the Pre Hispanic past in twentieth-century Mexico is "Por boca de los dioses." The initial reading of this work may cause confusion because of its inherent structure. The events recounted in this tale are related through the consciousness of an individual from the Aztec present who lives in, and views, the twentieth century as an inexplicable, oneiric future. In one respect, all that is told seems more fantastic than realistic. This, however, is the key to our understanding of the story. In contrast to the other stories in Los d?as enmascarados, "Por boca de los dioses" unfolds in a dream-like atmosphere. This characteristic is essential to the work's theme as it accentuates the fluidity of temporal categories in Mexico. Thus, the prose is an essential technique in demonstrating the oneiric quality which Fuentes considers inherent in Mexico's time scheme. In "Por boca de los dioses," Oliverio, the first-person narrator, is an aficionado of painting. Upon one of his visits to the Museo de Bellas Artes he meets an old friend, Don Diego. While visiting the museum, they enter into a heated discussion concerning a Tamayo painting dated 1958.14 Oliverio rips the mouth from this painting. Don Diego protests and Oliverio hurls the old man to his death from an upstairs window. He returns to his hotel with the mouth and later that day places it on his lapel. From this advantageous position the mouth forces him to do and to say things beyond his control. It eventually leads him to the hotel's basement to witness the Aztec rites. Frightened, Oliverio escapes to his room. Tlazol, the goddess of lust and confession, comes to his room and by belittling his masculinity angers him into opening the door.15 She then proceeds with the Aztec ceremony of human sacrifice. Thus, "Por boca de los dioses" presents the theme of the survival of the Aztec past in all historical epochs in Mexico. Time, in this context, is considered by Fuentes to be a composite of the three generally conceived separate realms : past, present, and future. As such, the story recounts events which occur in the twentieth century in Mexico but which are viewed as past occurrences in the Aztec present. The opening segment of this tale presents Oliverio at the moment of his sacrificial death. Therefore, the prose of the first two and a half pages represents his thoughts in a first-person, stream of consciousness technique. These thoughts, moments before his death, reveal all the incidents prior to his 14 This collection was written in 1954 ; therefore, the inclusion of this anachronistic ploy is Fuentes' manner of reiterating the plasticity of time. 15 Tlazol, also known as Tlazolteotl, was called the earth-goddess by the indigenous people because she eradicated sin. Confession was not her only function, although she was pre-eminent in this capacity. She was also the patroness of sensual desire. See CA. Burland, The Gods of Mexico (London: Eyre and Spottiswoode, 1967), p. 134.</page><page sequence="8">44 LATIN AMERICAN LITERARY REVIEW sacrifice. Hence, we learn that Oliverio sought to escape this end by entering the future of the twentieth century. In the future, he confined himself almost exclusively to his hotel room in an attempt to avoid the constant contact with the superficially disguised Aztec essence of Mexico City: ''Vengo huyendo de ellos, de sus formas menores, y est?n aqu?, gigantes sin m?s dimensi?n que la c?lera cort?s y el son reticente de las guitarras. En las calles, me miran feo, pisan mis pies, me?empujan, me pintan violines y me tocan el claxon, ?ay de observar a sus mujeres, ay de rehusar sus alcoholes, ay de demostrar que mi cerebro y mi memoria no laten a su comp?s!"16!"I come here fleeing from them and their short statures, and here they are giants, aggrandized by their courteous anger and the reticent sound of their guitars. On the street, they look crossly at me, step on my feet, humiliate me and sound their horn. Oh, the sight of their women, oh, the thought of refusing their liquor, oh, how to show them that my mind and memory march to a different drum! "]The prose in this story possesses an oneiric semblance inasmuch as it represents events and places which are recalled through memory and are devoid of spatial and temporal limitations. Oliverio's perspective or point of view of the twentieth century is fantastic, in that it views the present and the future of modern-day Mexico as a series of reiterations from the past. In this respect, he considers the receptionist of his hotel as evidencing a frustrated need to express her indigenous past. Also, upon entering a department store he perceives the telephone operator as resembling an Aztec maiden praying at the foot of the altar. When he is about to leave the store he notices that she has been strangled with telephone wires. The significance of his intuitively foreseeing this untimely occurrence indicates the fantastic basis of his perspective, which enables Oliverio to conceive the present and the future as those realms which have already happened. From this perspective Oliverio can likewise discern what belongs to the Aztec present. Therefore, he im mediately recognizes the mouth in Tamayo's painting as: "(...) distinta, como volun tariamente alejada de lo que pueda hacerla feliz. Distinta, mexicana, excelente..." (p. 67) ["( ) diff?rentes if voluntarily separated from that which could make it happy.Different, Mexican, excellent... "jOliverio reasons that the mouth, like himself, is an entity of the Aztec present which exists in modern-day Mexico. The mouth is for Oliverio the overt manifestation of the Aztec gods he wishes to escape. Once it has affixed itself to his body it can force him to warn the modern-day inhabitants of Mexico City of the omnipresence of their Aztec heritage. It can also compel Oliverio to witness rites he wishes to escape, and ultimately it ensures his sacrificial death. Oliverio's hotel, the fantastic site for these occurrences, permits the convergence of these temporal and spatial planes. His hotel room, which bears the number 1519, has a historical significance for Oliverio. It signifies Cortes' entry into Mexico and the end of the Aztec world. Through his fantastic conception Oliverio is able to regress temporally. Thus, 1519 does not signify the end of the Aztec domain but, in an inverse manner, the resurgence of Aztec rites. As such, his room, located at the top of the stairs, symbolizes a sacrificial altar in which the inevitable ceremony will occur. The basement of the hotel represents the original indigenous substratum upon which successive layers of European culture have been superimposed. The elevator connecting the basement and his room is seen through Oliverio's fantasy as the medium by which access to the Aztec present from Carlos Fuentes, op. cit., p. 65.</page><page sequence="9">The Supernatural Persistence of the Past 45 the future is maintained. By descending into the basement Oliverio encounters the initial stages of the ceremony which will be completed at the top of the sacrificial altar, his room. The mode of narration and the spatial components of "Por boca de los dioses" are as fantastic as the time element, which has a dual basis. In one respect, there is a reference to a time which proceeds in a linear, calendar fashion. The twentieth-century Mexico which Oliverio enters is the result of the progression of many centuries of historical epochs. In direct opposition to this temporal scheme is that which considers time in a mythic context, a fluid realm lacking distinctions between past, present, and future. In this unique Mexican time all three realms attain the same parity of existence. Consequently, Oliverio may choose to escape to the twentieth century while considering it from a past perspective of the Aztec present. In the omnipresent Aztec realm his sacrificial death can be con summated. Thus, the mouth inevitably symbolizes the persistence of this Aztec heritage despite the progression of calendar time. "Por boca de los dioses' ' and * 'Chac Mool" are distinct literary entities ; however, they reveal markedly similar depictions of Mexican time as a continual reiteration of the past. The last story to be considered in this critical study is "Tlactocatzine, del jard?n de Flandes." Like "Chac Mool" and "Por boca de los dioses," this work presents the subject of the past's supernatural persistence in modern-day Mexico. In this particular instance it is not the survival of the Aztec era but the continuation of the nineteenth century Hapsburg epoch, in the person of the Mexican Empress, Carlota. The first-person narrator and principal character of "Tlactocatzine, del jard?n de Flandes," Carlos, is invited by a friend to live in an old house on Avenida Puente de Alvarado. The friend asks Carlos to live there in order to imbue the house witfi human warmth. Carlos agrees and is especially impressed with the house's library and its glass doors, which face a garden of evergreens. One rainy day, while looking at the garden, he notices an old woman there. Upon his approaching the doors of the garden she suddenly disappears. Later that same day he receives an enigmatic message in N?huatl: "Tlac tocatzine." 1? On a subsequent occasion he attempts to talk with her. To his surprise he discovers that she is Carlota, the reincarnated Mexican Empress. He attempts to flee the garden but finds that the doors leading back to the house are locked. At this moment he realizes that he is fated to love the resurrected Carlota. The narrative mode of this work is furnished in a first-person, diary account. Like the narrators of the two previously discussed works, Carlos may be considered unreliable in that he is extremely susceptible to the suggestions of his imagination. His susceptibility to his imagination is in large part augmented by his momentary solitude in this enormous, unfamiliar old house. Having no one else with whom to communicate, Carlos must inevitably resort to fantasy in order to fill the psychological void which he senses around him. In addition, he demonstrates a noticeable distaste forhis surroundings and is therefore prone to fantasize in order to escape what he deems unpleasant in his twentieth-century environment. His imaginative conception of the house is first influenced by his friend, Brambila, who informs him that it has been uninhabited for forty years and that it possesses The use of N?huatl phrases in this story serves to confirm Fuentes' contention that the Pre-Hispanic era is omnipresent. The importance of this epoch is superceded, however, by the impact of the nineteenth century upon the protagonist, Carlos.</page><page sequence="10">46 LATIN AMERICAN LITERARY REVIEW a discernible chill which is not present outside. Brambila further influences Carlos by describing the house as: "(...)-historia, folklore, eleganica reunidos" 1H["(...)-history, folklore, and elegance all together "].Upon seeing the house, Carlos confirms his friend's observations concerning its unique attributes. Once within it, he comes to consider it as a sanctuary which removes him from the present-day turmoil of Mexico: "Aqu? se est? lejos de los * males parasitarios' de M?xico. Menos de veinticuatro horas entre estos muros, que son de una sensibilidad, de un fluir que corresponden a otros litorales..." (p. 44) ["Here one is far from the 'parasitic evils' of Mexico. Less than twenty-four hours inside these walls, which are of a sensibility of movement which belongs to other shores... ' '] The following day his fantasy and his desire to be distant from Mexico cause him to see the garden in these terms: "Y la lluvia misma remueve, en el pasto, otros colores que quiero insertar en ciudades, en ventanas; de pie en el centro del jard?n, cerr? los ojos..., (...) Era un paisaje ficticio, inventado. ?El jard?n no estaba en M?xico!..." (p. 45)1' And the rain itself stirs up colors in the grass which I want to insert in cities, in windows; standing in the center of the garden, I closed my eyes..., (...) It was a fictitious, fabricated landscape. The garden wasn't in Mexico!..."]Throughout his stay in the house Carlos finds himself recalling the past in all its forms. He is especially aware of his ability to remember those aspects of the past which are directly associated with Maximilian's Empire. The house presents a preferable alternative, in the form of a nineteenth-century semblance, to the demoralizing world of the twentieth century. In this respect, Carlos expresses an un controllable need to remain within the confines of the house and to stare endlessly into the fictitious garden of his conception. He further implies that this process of fantasizing is not restricted to the garden alone but is applicable to the interior of the house as well: ' 'Esas pisadas lentas, siempre sobre hojas secas, cre?a escucharlas a cada instante, sab?a que no eran ciertas, hasta que sent? el m?nimo .crujido junto a la puerta, y luego, el frotar por la rendija" (p. 47)["These slow footsteps, always on dry leaves, which I believed I heard at every instant and which I knew weren't real, until I heard the slight creak near the door and the swish across the doorsill."??n this state of imaginative suggestion Carlos believes that he encounters the reincarnated Empress, Carlota, thereby demonstrating his separation from conventional norms defining reality. The progressive psychological movement by Carlos from the twentieth-century present to the nineteenth-century past is amply noted throughout the story. Upon first seeing Carlota, Carlos believes she is an intruder who has mysteriously managed to enter the enclosed garden. However, in his subsequent description he corrects his initial impression: "(...) en sus ojos no hab?a ojos... ; (...) No, no dir? que cruz? la enredera y el muro, que se evapor?, que pentr? en la tierra o ascendi? al cielo; ..."(p. 47)("(...) her eyes were vacuous... ; (...) No, no I will not say that she crossed the enclosure and the wall, that she evaporated, that she descended into the ground or ascended into the sky;..."]His ephemeral perception of Carlota con tinues to the extent that he comes to doubt not only his eyes but his sense of touch as well: "(...) y la anciana me tom? de las manos, las bes?; su piel apret? la m?a. Lo supe por revelaci?n, porque mis ojos dec?an lo que el tacto no corroboraba : ..."(p. 49) V '(...) and the old woman took my hands, she kissed them; her skin pressed against mine.

Satisfacci?n de carcelero, de compa??a, de prisi?n eterna. Satisfacci?n de soledades compartidas" (p. 50) t"(...) her gestures are repetitious and evince satisfaction; the satisfaction of a jailor, of companionship, of an eternal prison; the satisfaction of a shared loneliness. "iThus, the solitude which Carlos felt as an alienated dissatisfied individual of this century is alleviated through the fantastic contact with a person from a previous and more desirable era. Essentially, the space of the house on Puente Alvarado serves to support Carlos' fantastic imaginative perspective. The name ^lvarado has historical importance in that it represents the name of the officer who assisted Cort?s. Furthermore, the house located on this avenue is in the style of the Empire of Maximilian. The two are anachronistic reminders which Carlos perceives as spatially together. They represent two divergent historical epochs which, although separated by hundreds of years, are united in his con ception. Essentially, the house becomes the sacred zone which permits the coalescing of divergent space and time planes of Mexican culture. Carlos, through his fantasy interprets the space of the house and its environs in a double basis. The house's exterior remains within the turbulent, modern-day Mexico City. Its interior and the garden, (the latter, mentioned in the title) conversely, assume the coordinates of Flandes in the nineteenth century and thereby represent the tranquility of a small, European milieu of a bygone era. The garden and the interior of the house both represent closed space ; hermetically sealed areas which resist the assault of time and preserve the past. The locked doors leading to the garden represent Carlos' own confinement within himself, his isolation from others. In effect, Carlos retains two alternatives: he can look out onto Puente Alv?rado and feel repelled by what he sees in modern Mexico City, or he can look out at the garden in the hope that he may eventually inhabit it. In this story, as in "Chac Mool," there is an inherent ambiguity between closed and open spaces. Open spaces are those which permit unrestricted movement. The space outside the house on Puente Alvarado represents such a sense of freedom. Ironically, though, Carlos feels encumbered by the openness of a modern metropolis and therefore seeks refuge in the closed space of the garden. The garden, on the other hand, proffers freedom in the form of escape from a modern en vironment, but is a sphere of captivity. Within the house itself, Carlos' conception transforms the space into distinct categories. The living room, because of its proximity to the library and garden, is more readily permeated with the aura of the previous century. His bedroom, conversely, represents the realm of reason and the absence of fantasy. In the course of the story, the delivery of mysterious messages in his room indicates a substitution of illogical imagination for logic. The evergreens in the garden symbolize perennial rebirth of the past. Therefore, their presence in the house, in the form of an overpowering scent, is an indication that the previous century does not exist exclusively within the confines of the garden, but in the house as well. At this point, the fantastic reincarnation of Carlota in the twentieth century becomes possible. Time, like space, in "Tlactocatzine, del jard?n de Flandes" has a dual basis. The daily entries in Carlos' diary infer a linearly progressive calendar expiration of five days. This temporality is most compatible with the modern world of Mexico City which exists</page><page sequence="12">48 LATIN AMERICAN LITERARY REVIEW outside of the house on Puente Alvarado. In contrast to this ordinary temporal scheme is a regressively oriented one. A prime example of these two divergent temporal planes is symbolized in the relationship of Carlos and Carlota. Carlos is a young individual from the twentieth century who is the temporal antithesis of Carlota, the old woman of the previous era. Nonetheless, these two antithetical extremes merge through Carlos' constant preoccupation with the past of the Emperor Maximilian. During his hermetic stay within the house, he focuses his attention on this bygone era. The parity of importance which Carlos accords to the present and to the past enables the latter to achieve dominance. Thus, the inherent lack of distinctions between these divergent temporal concepts in his perspective as narrator-participant assures Carlota 's fantastic reincarnation. At the end, Carlos is Carlota's prisoner within the confines of the previous century. In conclusion, in the course of this study attention was given to the four unpublished stories which preceded this collection in an effort to indicate their contributions to the thematic scope of Fuentes' later work. Consideration was also given to the author's literary premise, the supernatural persistence of the past in present-day Mexico, and to the use of the artistic techniques of narrative person, time and space in depicting this fantastic subject. As has been shown, the imaginative complicity of the narrator-protagonist in conjunction with a zona sagrada and a particular time scheme enable the supernatural event of reincarnation to occur. Lastly, some emphasis must be given to the importance of these three stories with respect to Fuentes' subsequent fiction. The theme of cyclical existence, first presented in "Trigo errante" and later expounded in "Chac Mool," "Por boca de los dioses" and "Tlactocatzine, del jard?n de Flandes," influenced the topical basis of Aura and Cumplea?os. Of the three tales analyzed in this study, "Tlactocatzine, del jard?n de Flandes" has proven to be the one which had the greatest impact on the author's later career. After Los d?as enmascarados, Fuentes expressed no literary interest in the Aztec era of Mexico. The Hapsburg past and the correlated theme of undying love, conversely, continued to draw his attention. Thus, he admitted to Emmanuel Carballo the significance of ' 'Tlactocatzine, del jard?n de Flandes : " "Es un cuento importante no s?lo dentro de Los d?as enmascarados sino en el conjunto de mi obra y mis preocupaciones. En ?l intento recrear la historia, sin caer en los vicios propios del reportaje sobre el pasado. El pasado aparece all? como nostalgia, como esp?ritu que act?a sobre el presente e influye en sus proporciones y texturas. Es un cuento sobre la perseverancia del amor a trav?s de los a?os. Este tema lo vuelvo a tratar en una narraci?n m?s o menos extensa que publicar? pronto: 'Aura.'" 19 ["It is an important story not only with respect to Los d?as en mascarados but also in the context of my work and my interests. In it I seek to recreate history, without falling into the very faults of reporting the past. The past, in this story, is depicted as nostalgia, as a presence which acts upon the present and influences its proportions and qualities. It is a story about the persistence of love throughout the years. I will treat this theme again in a more or less extensive narrative which I will publish soon: 'Aura' "]. Hence, "Chac Mool," "Por boca de los dioses" and "Tlactocatzine, del jard?n de Flandes," although three distinct literary entities reiterate Fuentes' basic premise of the supernatural survival of bygone epochs in twentieth-century Mexico and influence the course of the author's subsequent literary preoccupations.
