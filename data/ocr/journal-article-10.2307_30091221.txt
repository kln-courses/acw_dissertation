In Part One, the questioning of Job and Hopkins, the philosophic probing of David Hume, the literary meditations on death and Christian hope by the metaphysical poets, the experience of suffering due to unjust structures in the third world, all point to the challenge `confronting many of us today to outgrow or overthrow false notions of God'. In other words, the book is a call not only to go beyond the anthropomorphic, but also to reflect on God as `co-sufferer' and 'liberator'. Part Two addresses the task of describing God, of con300tualizing our images of God in the face of suffering, the problem of evil and above all the fact that God continues to be real to many victims of suffering and oppression, the first hand experience of which prompted the authors to write the book in the first place. They weigh up the claims of Latin American theologians with classical theism, condensing the thinking from Philo to Aquinas, from Hartshorne to Segundo, who links injustice to `our perverted idea of God'. The authors limit themselves to focusing on the challenge of suffering in this exploration, rather than on the one other important issues it raises, although the delicate dilemma of predicating change and relativity to God is tackled with balance, in the light of `the methodological presuppositions of Hartshorne's philosophy'. Chapter 7 explores how we might participate in God's 'liberative act', a God of influence more than of control. This involves such notions as creativity as related to causality and sublation, in the context of God's governance of the world. The authors are right in their assertion that the atheistic challenge is not the only one, and that going beyond dialectical thinking is a necessary step in our attempts to con300tualize our images of God, and the presuppositions assumed. An occupational hazard for theologians seems to be letting the pendulum swing too far. I ac300t that God's status cannot be risked for a dogma that serves an idealizing tendency, and that what we need is a doctrine that makes sense of the reality of living as we experience it. This is a refreshing book in that it broadens the base of the debate, and its lack of an apologetic need in talking about God is helpful. At the end of the day however, we do need a doctrine that makes sense of our reality. As Bernard Lonergan reminds us in his charting the road to Nicea, the movement from everyday language to the religious language of the Gospels, and to the theological language of the Greek Councils takes time. The traditional Christian teaching on the divine immutability and impassability, formed as it was in a philosophical soil less governed by the historical climate that is ours, requires modification. We need to be able to talk about God `as transcendent and yet as intimately involved with us', in line with scriptural revelation, Christian experience and creation as `an analogous expression of God', without splitting God. 292</page><page sequence="3">Studies Volume 85 Number 339 This book is a valuable contribution to the ongoing challenge of theological dialogue, which far from being a theoretical problem alone, is fraught with practical, administrative and pastoral repercussions, that permeate the concerns of the home, the classroom, the courtroom, the clinic and the confessional. Does not every homily assume an implicit image of God Working with a priest recently as a psychotherapist, a person with a long history of various treatments for obsessional guilt and self-punishing neurosis, said to me, `what I need above all is to get my theology right, as my image of God only feeds my fear of going to hell, and gives me an antipathy to Jesus that is fierce'. More than books or reflection are needed in this context. Psychoanalytic ideas such as the modes of identifications, that lead to the assumption of images, the imagoes that produce words, could do for theology what philosophy did in the past. In the meantime, this is a work I recommend strongly, as there is a lot at stake in our assumptions about God, considering the needs of the ancient world, the excessive rationalism in some theological positions and the unconscious psychological agencies that govern the heart `out of which the mouth speaks'. The acknowledgements, endnotes, bibliography and index suitably frame this timely book. Brendan Staunton, SJ. The Diocese of Killaloe, 1850-1904, by Ignatius Murphy, Dublin: Four Courts Press, 1995. 600signor Ignatius Murphy died two years before the publication of this book, the third in his series of works on Killaloe Diocese. The Diocese of Killaloe in the Eighteenth Century appeared in 1991, followed by The Diocese of Killaloe 1800-1850 in 1992. By the time the second volume was launched in November 1992, he had completed a draft for the third book, but was already seriously ill. He re-wrote just two of the 14 chapters before his death. The committee of Killaloe priests who had been helping him prepare his works for publication decided to leave the remaining chapters as they were written and to concentrate on preparing the appendices. This homage to their colleague does however mean that there is occasional overlap between this volume and its predecessor. It may seem strange to introduce the documents of the Second Vatican Council into discussion of a work on the second half of the nineteenth century. There is, nevertheless, some benefit in so doing. Ignatius Murphy cited the Council's Dogmatic Constitution on the Church, Lumen Gentium in the introduction to the first volume of this series and the point he made then applies equally to the following two. Any historical examination of the Church, in either its universal or local expressions, has a theological dimension. Lumen Gentium 's vision of the Church as the People of God necessarily has implications for the writing of history. The old style of diocesan history, which could be crudely</page></plain_text>
