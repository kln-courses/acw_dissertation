<plain_text><page sequence="1">Convention and originality in the Old English 'beasts of battle' typescene M. S. GRIFFITH The main part of this paper will deal with the typescene of the beasts of battle, and will describe its content and use as rigorously as possible in formulaic terms. In particular, the relationship between the conventional and the original will be examined in order to show that the scene is more traditional than has been thought and that many of the variations occur within conventional parameters. The term 'typescene' has been used with too much flexibility by Anglo- Saxonists, and will here be used with the meaning outlined by G. S. Kirk: [Oral composition] makes use of other standard components on a broader scale: of typical actions and ideas that are used and reused in different combinations and contexts. These may vary in extent from minor and specific motifs, as of a warrior stripping armour from his victim, to major and more generalized themes, as of a prince refusing to fight because of an insult to his honour. Between the two, and often easier to identify, is the 'typical scene' ... in which recurrent actions of everyday or heroic life are described again and again in standard language that can be abbreviated or elaborated where necessary.1 The definition is based on W. Arend's pioneering work on scenes of arrival and departure, sacrifice and meal-preparation, arming and dressing, journey by land and sea, deliberation, oath-taking and assembly.2 Such scenes are constructed of a sequence of motifs; in the case of the most detailed, the scene of sacrifice, no less than twenty-one successive elements are used. The motifs normally occur in the same order, sometimes, but not always, with verbal repetitions which may extend over several lines. Verbal repetition was central to Parry and Lord's view of the typescene, but is less important in more recent approaches to the subject. M. W. Edwards, for example, remarks: Verbal repetitions sometimes occur in instances of the same type-scene, but they are not extensive. One might have expected the recurrent ritual of sacrifice, for instance, to be described in a block of identical verses, but in fact no two such descriptions are 1 The Iliad: a Commentary , ed. G. S.

Griffith exactly alike, and in the majority of such scenes only a few verses recur in identical form.3 Some have accordingly doubted whether these larger formulaic narrative structures really exist. W. Whallon asks: The question is whether the poet intended to repeat a theme when he used different words to express much the same idea in passages that might be interchanged without harm to the metre. If he himself regarded the idea as being the same, why did he not (as we should have expected from the law of economy) use the same words?4 Parry's law of economy states that formulae used as synonyms differ from each other in metre, in order that they may be as useful as possible to the poet, and so the expression of the same ideas in the same metre should result in the use of the same formulae. That repeated typescenes occur both in Homer and Old English poetry without such economy must either lead us to doubt whether the same ideas are actually being repeated or, more likely, bring into question the existence of the law of economy. Extensive verbal repetition is, of course, extremely rare in Old English poetry and so has never been given a fundamental role in formulaic studies of the Old English typescene. D. K. Fry defined the Old English typescene as 'a recurring stereotyped presentation of conventional details used to describe a certain narrative event, requiring neither verbatim repetition nor a specific formula content'.5 This usefully distinguished the typescene from the theme, for the conventional details of the latter are ťnot restricted to a specific event', and form 'an underlying structure for an action or description'; neither are 'restricted in any way to verbatim repetition, definite metrical patterns, a fixed order of events, details or ideas, or certain formulas or systems'.6 This disparity between the definitions of the Homeric and the Old English typescenes is important, for the latter is greatly weakened by the abandonment of the criterion of fixed order and the further downgrading of the role of verbal repetition. This has allowed some Anglo- Saxonists to focus on the poets' contextualising of typescenes by and large without questioning whether the presence of such variation compromises the theoretical integrity of the type itself.7 3 The Iliad : a Commentary , V (ed.

Finke 180</page><page sequence="3">Convention and originality in the ' beasts of battle * typescene Central to the definition of the typescene is that it must occur regularly with a relatively fixed content of a number of motifs, and it shares this in common with the theme. D. K. Crowne, for example, defined the well-known theme of the hero on the beach - which is seemingly often linked with the typescene of the beasts of battle - in terms of a fixed content of four motifs: the hero appears on a beach, with his retainers, in the presence of a flashing light, as a journey is prepared or begun.8 The existence of this theme has been generally, if uncritically, accepted, but J. A. Dane and J. Richardson have strongly criticized the unsoundness of this definition.9 Their attack exposes the illusoriness of the supposed fixed content, for, in heroic literature, hero and retainers form a social unit, and the latter are almost never seen apart from the former; furthermore, heroes must be somewhere, and if they are seen on beaches it is extremely likely that journeys are about to begin. These ideas are immanent in heroic narrative and do not constitute motifs of a specific theme. The remaining motif, the flashing light, occurs in a bewildering array of guises - the sun, a shining seacliff, a gleaming helmet, a flickering flame - and so the commonality of the idea may be doubted. But, in any case, a motif is not a theme. The collapse of the case for the most widely discussed Old English formulaic theme has serious implications for the endeavour to turn oral- formulaic theory into a literary critical tool for the interpretation of Old English poetic narrative structures. Themes and typescenes must constitute specific nuclei of motifs which must add up to more than generalized truisms about heroic narrative. Battle is typical heroic action, and all Old English poetry that is heroic in theme and formulaic in style should show typescenes in battle narration. B. Fenik has shown that such narrative is a quite exceptional locus for the conventional in Homer.10 Similar work in Old English began with F. P. Magoun who isolated twelve appearances of the scene of the beasts of battle (Beo 3024-7, Brun 60-5, El 27-30, 111-14, Ex 162-7, Finn 5-7, 34-5, Gen A 1983-5,/W205-12, 294-6, Mald 106-7, Wan 81-3), together with the passages which, to his thinking, demonstrated the formulaic status of these passages.11 and M.

Stanley added El 52-3, Fort 10-14, 33-42, Gen A 2157-61, but noted that in The Wanderer and The Fortunes of Men the references to the beasts are either only slightly related to, or are entirely unconnected with, a scene of battle, and the beasts are merely disposers of corpses; as he remarks, 'the original audience may, of course, have supplied the connexion with battle, seeing that the association was so common',12 but the apparent absence from lyric is unsurprising for the scene is linked to a narrative event: battle. As few of the scene's motifs are found in The Wanderer and The Fortunes of Men , the analysis here is confined to the narrative poetry, and Magoun's list, supple- mented by Stanley's, confirms that the scene occurs frequently across a wide range of narratives, and so it passes the first test of formulaic definition. The relevant passages are given in an Appendix. A number of critics have spoken of the beasts as an ornamental embellish- ment of the narrative, rather than as an integral function of it (as formulaic theory defines the typescene). B. Raw, for instance, calls the beasts 'decorative additions to the paraphernalia of battle',13 and R. E. Diamond agrees, calling them 'essentially a convention which the poet might call upon when he had a battle to narrate . . . they are essentially ornament'.14 Indeed, the scene is not logically essential to the action of the narrative and could be removed without destroying the chronological or causal coherence of the narratives in which it occurs, but it is functional in a different sense. Whilst it is true that the scene may appear outside the usual context of battle (in Exodus where battle threatens but fails to materialize, and in the messenger's speech in Beowulf ), nonetheless, where pitched battle - as opposed to single combat or conflict with the focus on a single warrior - really takes place and is narrated, then the beasts are always in evidence. Despite Bonjour's statement that in Beowulf the scene is 'never used in connection with any of the numerous battlescenes which come into focus throughout the poem',15 there are, in fact, far from numerous battles recounted in the poem. Conflicts between armies are quite often mentioned, but are rarely described. Fighting in Finnsburh is alluded to, but the poet focuses on the failed peace treaty and the funeral pyre of Hnaef. The disastrous defeat of the Geats on the Frisian shore is mentioned several times, but the text concentrates on the fall of Hygelac and Beowulf's escape, swimming back with the armour of thirty warriors. Battle seems imminent in the messenger's digression on the Swedish wars in lines 2922-88, but the 12 E. G.

Beowulf centralizes single combat, whilst full battle is referred to rather than narrated. The absence of the scene from some of the other poems would appear to be for the same reason. In Daniel , Nebuchadnezzar marches on Jerusalem and sacks it, but the actual battle is not depicted. The poetic introduction to The Metres of Boethius tells in stirring terms how the Goths sweep south through Italy and sack Rome, but the threat of battle evaporates when the emperor flees and his supporters surrender. The actions of the Mermedonians in Andreas are often described in military language (e.g. lines 40-51, 122-60), but there are no battles, for this language underlines the narrator's disdain for the cowardice of the Mermedonians who attack the solitary Matthew en masse. On the other hand, no proper battle takes place without the obligatory beasts. Apart from the early section on the angels, the only major addition to the source in Genesis A - which generally follows the Bible closely - is the elaboration of the account of the battle of the kings against Sodom in lines 1960-2095, and this contains its appropriate reference to the dark bird that sings in expectation of a carcase (1983-5). The sources of Tiene , so far as we have them, give an unadorned and prosaic account of the battle between the barbarians and the forces of Constantine, but Cynewulf's much more elaborate rendition includes the circumstantial, but apparently essential, detail of the typescene. In Judith , the beasts form part of a highly conventional and mannered description of battle which is almost entirely an addition to the apocryphal source. These poets, at these points, had greater respect for their poetic form than for their sources. The only apparent exception to this, the second battle in the added section of Genesis A between Abraham and the Elamites in lines 2060-95, is in fact no different: Wide gesawon freora feorhbanan fuglas slitan on ecgwale, (2087b-9a) and Abraham in his recapitulation of the battle to the king of Sodom also alludes to the carrion birds: ac nefuglas under beorhhleoķum blodige sittaõ, ķeodherga waele ķicce gefylled. (2159b-61) 183</page><page sequence="6">M.S. Griffith Magoun does not refer to these lines, though Stanley includes the second passage. Both of these are additions to the source, but are highly characteristic of Old English poetry. The available evidence, fragmentary though it is, thus points to the conclusion that the poets felt the beasts to be a compulsory element of battle narration. They do not advance the action, but they are symbolically essential to it, and cannot be eliminated without destroying its poetic coherence. The predictability of their appearance is powerfully sugges- tive of formulaic status. The actions of the beasts may well have begun as nothing more than a particularly morbid and macabre observation of real events. That the link is natural and not of itself formulaic is shown by the fact that it is occasionally made by poets who were not influenced by the Anglo-Saxon tradition. The early Welsh poem, The Battle of Argoed Tlwjfain , refers to the feasting of ravens: There was many a corpse beside Argoed Llwyfain; From warriors ravens grew red, And with their leader a host attacked.16 Such a link becomes formulaic, however, when poets show a predilection for using it, a desire to elaborate and then to fix its details, and an aversion to the description of other aspects of battle. J. B. Hainsworth is alert to these positive and negative aspects of formulaic structure: The theme has its place in oral poetry because certain themes are more frequent and certain set thematic sequences are more regular than one would expect them to be other things being equal. Nor must we overlook the negative side of this frequency. Each use of a theme implies the lack of any wish or ability to channel the thought into any less familiar mode.17 Magoun summarized the complex of ideas in this typescene as 'wolf, eagle, and/or raven as beasts attendant on a scene of carnage'.18 The evidence of the texts suggests that a more detailed abstract of repeated motifs can be made: 'in the wake of an army, the dark raven, the dewy-plumaged eagle and the wolf of the forest, eager for slaughter and carrion/food, give voice to their joy'. Given 16 G. Jones, The Oxford Book of Welsh Verse in English (Oxford, 1977), p. 1. For other examples, Welsh, biblical, Carolingian, and Christian Latin, see R. Frank, 'Did Anglo-Saxon Audiences have a Skaldic Tooth?', Scandinavian Stud. 59 (1987), 338-55, at 348 and nn. 16-17. Other aspects of the scene may be based on observation: that the beasts and birds work in unison may reflect the fact that though the birds first spot the carrion, it is the wolves that open up the body wall of the corpse and thus make the softer innards available to the birds. 17 J.

The list disguises two problems which should be mentioned. First, I have assumed that at those points where the texts more generally speak of a dark bird and a dewy-feathered one, the specifying of these elsewhere as raven and eagle allows us to conclude that the audience would have understood these references. Secondly, the ideas 'slaughter', 'corpse', 'carrion' and 'food' are difficult to separate clearly and the splitting of them here into two broad categories is admittedly somewhat rough and ready. It must also be admitted straightaway that no single motif occurs in all instances of the scene, so we must abandon the notion of fixed content in the Old English typescene if by that we mean a group of ideas which must occur in their entirety from example to example. Perhaps this definition, though, is too strict, and rather unliterary: 19 For a similar analysis restricted to Judith, see D. K. Fry, 'Type-Scene Composition in Judith ' Annuale Mediaevale 12 (1972), 100-19, at 116. 185</page><page sequence="8">M.S. Griffith we may ask ourselves what kind of audience and what sort of taste would have demanded such robotic repetition? We have to accept, I think, that the mentioning of a number of these motifs would by association call up the others. The point is that all of the fourteen passages under discussion contain many of these ten motifs (Jud 205-12 at one extreme omits only the notion of slaughter, though this is of course latent in that of carrion), and all of these motifs occur a number of times (from dewy-feathered four times, to the idea of the birds speaking or singing on fourteen occasions). Furthermore, the overwhelming majority of the verses in these passages express these ten motifs, thus showing that the poets preferred to repeat and recombine certain standard details in much the same language, and eschewed thematic inno- vation. Of course, a number of these details are not at all surprising: ravens are dark, no doubt wolves are usually to be found in forests and it does not require a remarkable flight of fancy to suppose that animals might enjoy their food; but some are unusual. One does not normally think of eagles as dewy- feathered, nor of animals singing. And some equally obvious thematic possibilities are ignored: despite the place-names Hrefnawudu and Earnanœs in Beowulf ^ none of these ravens are of the wood, nor any of these eagles of the cliffs. The creatures are never extensively described: the raven is dark and twice said to be hook-beaked (Brun 62, Jud 212); apart from its dewiness, the eagle is once said to be grey-plumaged and white-tailed (Brun 62-3); and the wolf is twice described as grey (Brun 64, Finn 6), and once as lean ( Jud 205). But the poets were not always averse to detailed portraiture of animals and birds (e.g. The Phoenix 291-313 and The Panther 19-30, though allegorical form might in both have encouraged the elaboration of surface detail). Perhaps more surprising still is the almost total absence of description of the beasts actually eating the slain, and yet Old English poets seem sometimes to have relished the gory realism of bodies being feasted upon (e.g. Grendel's devouring of Hondscioh, Beowulf 740-5, and Gifer the worm's rapid destruc- tion of cadavers, Soul and Body II 11 1-17). Only the poet of Genesis A shows the carrion birds tearing the murderers of free men, and this may be a blend of this typescene with the formulaic motif of the visibility of destruction, or of the tracks of an enemy, after conflict.20 Just as certain thematic possibilities are ignored, so also some other possible ways of looking at carnage and the aftermath of battle are not to be found. Middle English battle poetry does not echo the older tradition, but rather has its own scene of carnage which focuses upon 'pieces of bodies or quantities of blood or dead horses and dead enemies'.21 This less intricate and more literal 20 The motif is indicated by the formula(e) wide gesyne ( Beo 1403b, 2316b, 2947b), wide gesawon ( 'Gen A 2087b). 21 S. Wittig, Stylistic and Narrative Structures in the Middle English Romances (Austin, TX, 1 978), p. 186</page><page sequence="9">Convention and originality in the 'beasts of battlef typescene scene might quite naturally have suggested itself to an Anglo-Saxon poet; but it does not occur. Anglo-Saxon manuscript illustrations of warfare display their own conventional battle iconography, often incorporating a decapi- tation scene, with dismembered bodies lying beneath the battling troops, and the backward glances of those leaving the field; but this did not influence the poets.22 In about half the occurrences of the beasts of battle ( El, Finn , Gen A 1983-5, Jud 205-12, Maid), the beasts appear in anticipation of conflict, before the battle actually begins and, obviously, other themes and scenes could have been more dominant than they are at this moment. The Battle of Maldon provides a unique example of the beasts occurring before battle in combi- nation with another scene which is often said to be characteristic of heroic battle poetry, the flyting or verbal duel in which warriors make boastful promises before the battle which must later be fulfilled in action. That this is confined in Old English poetry to Maldon and Waldere is explained by W. Parks as a consequence of the fragmentariness of the surviving corpus.23 Perhaps, though, the poets were more interested in other conventions. These various aspects of the negative capability of the typescene are rarely or never mentioned, but are, as Hainsworth realized, an important, if hidden, compo- nent of its definition and of its effect. Lexical variation is highly characteristic of the poetic style, and, in general, the more frequently an idea occurs in the poetry, the more fully developed is the vocabulary for that idea. For example, Riddle 22, 'The Wagon of the Stars' - if this is the correct solution - images stars crossing the heavens as horses, and as a result, the text is replete with words for that idea: blonca , eh,fat-ļfrid- hengest , hors , wieg and possibly sceam. Some of these are poetic words, for the special needs of the poets - and in particular the requirements of the alliterative line - produced a poetic vocabulary rich in synonyms or near synonyms for commonly occurring ideas. Some typescenęs use this character- istic verbal elaboration. The central idea of the ship, for example, in the sea voyage scene, is denoted by many terms. There are ordinary words (ac, ase, bat, ceol, flota, seip ), poetic words and words with special poetic meanings (far , lid, naca, w udu), a loan word ( cnearr ), and many compounds, whose first elements 70. Like the beasts, this scene is associated with conflicts between armies, not individuals. For a possible Middle English survival of the beasts, see A. Renoir, 'Christ Ihesu's Beasts of Battle: a Note on Oral-Formulaic Theme Survival', Neophilologus 60 (1976), 455-9, on Lydgate's Life of Saint Alban. 22 See J. Kiff, 'Images of War: Illustrations of Warfare in Early Eleventh-Century England', Anglo-Norman Stud. 7 (1984), 177-94. D. J. Bernstein, The Mystery of the Bay eux Tapestry (London, 1986), p. 86, argues that some of the animals beneath the battle scenes in the tapestry are ravens and eagles awaiting their carrion. 23 W. Parks, Verbal Dueling in Heroic Narrative: the Homeric and Old English Traditions (Princeton, NJ, 1990), pp. 67-8. 187</page><page sequence="10">M.S. Griffith are usually terms for 'sea', with final elements meaning 'ship', 'horse' or 'plank'. On the contrary, it is a fact of the utmost importance that Old English poetry and, indeed, the Old English lexicon do not contain simplexes for 'raven', 'eagle' and 'wolf' other than the non-poetic lexemes hrafn , earn and wulf. There are words for other birds of prey and carrion birds (e.g. ceo , craw e , frisca , giw , gliday higora , hrocy etc.), but, with the exception of the unique compound guöhafoc in Brun 64 and the unique gloss nihthroc in the Lambeth Psalter 101.7, these are not used metaphorically for the eagle and the raven. In the case of the latter, this is especially surprising, for B. Yapp notes that medieval people confused the Latin names corvus , 'raven' and comix , 'crow', and 'the pictures of the two are usually indistinguishable'.24 There are three words for 'she-wolf' in Old English (; wyrgen , wylf^ wylfen) but they are not used more generally of the species. OE wearg , 'criminal', 'outlaw', never acquired the meaning 'wolf' in Old English (cf. ON vargr). There are five nominal compounds for the creatures which occur once each in the examples of the typescene (gudhafoc , herefugol , mearcweard , nefugol ,25 wcelceasega) and, along with nihthroc lyftsceapa ( FtM 39) and gupfugol (R 24.5), these are the only such compounds for these creatures in Old English. That three of these occur in Exodus is further evidence of that text's unusual language. Hasewanfsaluwig- pad, deawig-ļurig-f edere , hjrned-nebha are adjectival compounds describing the birds (which may also be used substantively) which also occur in the scenes. However, there is not a single simplex for the beasts that is poetic in register: beside hrœfny earn and wulf ' the poets seem content to use only the general and prosaic fugo I ( Finn 5, Gen A 1983, 2088, Jud 207, 296) and deor ( Brun 64, Ex 166). This situation contrasts starkly with the wealth of names for these creatures in Old Norse literature: the raven, for example, is there called 'Odin's greedy hawk', 'Ygg's seagull', 'Ygg's swan', 'Gaut's cuckoo', 'corpse-goose', 'corpse-cuckoo', 'blood-swan', 'blood-goose', 'wound-grouse', 'osprey-of- the-spear-storm', 'battle-swallow', 'battle-crane' amongst others.26 Absence of variation is not, of course, the same thing as verbatim repetition, but the fact that the central figures of the scene are touched upon so economically invests its language with a uniformity which brings it as close to the Homeric model of the typescene as Old English poetry ever comes. The limited vocabulary of the scene has more general implications for its 24 B.

Turville-Petre, Myth and Religion of the North: the Religion of Ancient Scandinavia (London, 1964), pp. 58-9. 188</page><page sequence="11">Convention and originality in the ' beasts of battle ' typescene style. Whilst the typescene of the sea voyage is usually at least twenty lines long - though the length of the examples depends to some extent on the definition of the limits of this scene - no example of the beasts of battle scene is longer than eight lines. The greater length of the former is partly the product of a weightier narrative content - embarking, voyaging, disembarking - but it also reflects the more diverse and developed vocabulary for its central ideas (hero, warriors, sea, ship, voyage). The shortness of the beasts scene is clearly connected to its lexical limitations. Richness of vocabulary for common ideas eased the task of achieving the necessary alliteration and encouraged alliter- ative variety. Conversely, the lack of such vocabulary and of the variation so loved by the poets should result in greater dependence on a few alliterative pairings and greater phonetic uniformity in the alliteration. There can be no doubt that the Anglo-Saxon audience expected the wolf to be linked with slaughter ( wulf wœl Beo 3027, Brun 65, El 28, 112, Ex 164, Jud 206-7, 295, Maid 96), and the eagle with dew ( earn : urig- El 29, 111, Jud 210), and food ( earn: ces Brun 63? Maid 107; cet Beo 3026, Jud 210). Two-thirds of the lines in the corpus given to this scene alliterate on vowels, h-, or w-, the initial sounds of earn , hrafn and wulf. Magoun's analysis showed how formulaic the scene is in the traditional meaning of that word:27 a large number of its verse phrases can be found repeated elsewhere in the corpus; but this evidence suggests that it is formulaic in a wider sense, and in a way that is more specific to this typescene. The relative conciseness of the beasts of battle scene, the crisp fashion in which it conveys its key ideas, and the contrast this forms with the more normal leisureliness of the narrative style suggests that it may have been regarded by poets and audience as a rhetorical tour de force , and a demonstration by the poet that he could create a more compact style that was dramatically appropriate to the urgency of the subject matter, and yet one which was still, even in this need, properly done. Magoun's summary of the scene's main thematic aspects omits a crucial feature which gives us important information about the structural relationship between the scene and its context: the stress on the attitude of the beasts, on their expectation and noisy exultation. The origin of this unrealistic and anthropomorphic interpretation of beast noise is almost certainly to be found in the fact that, in almost all the examples of the motif, its appearance is triggered by the noise of battle {Brun 59 wiges hremige, El 24-5 Wordum ond bor dum hofon herecumbol, 50-1 ponne rand dyne de, camp w udu clynede , 109-10 By man sungon h lude for h er gum, Ex 1 59 by man sungon, Finn 6 Gudwudu hlynneò, 30 buruhÖelu dynede, Gen A 1982 f ranean wœron h lude, Jud 204-5 Dynedan scildas, h lude hlummon, 27 Magoun, 'Beasts of Battle', pp. 88-90. 189</page><page sequence="12">M.S. Griffith Maid 106-7 peer wearÒ hream ahafen . . . wees on eorpan cyrm ).28 The formulaic status of the trigger is confirmed by the high degree of lexical repetition it contains: by man sungon, dynnan, h lude, hremig) hream, -wudu. The noise of the beasts seems, then, to be an analogue, or a repercussion, of the immediately preceding noise of the armies, and this corresponding presentation makes them seem like the warriors and, vice versa, warriors in the poetry are often made to seem beast-like. The close relationship between warriors and certain beasts has its source deep in the Germanic imagination, ^and this link may provide the motivation for the substance of the typescene. Much of the language of the scene is, elsewhere in the poetry, associated with warfare and warriors. In Exodus 162 and 168 - framing the scene - the birds and border- guards cried out: herefugolas . . . mearcweardas hreopon. Three of the other six instances of the poetic verb hropan are in the formula hreopan friccaw, the heralds cry out as the beasts do (see And 1156, El 54, 550). In Judith 207 and 295 - linking the two appearances of the scene - the birds are described as wcelgifre, 'greedy for slaughter', a compound elsewhere associated with weapons {Wan 100) and Death, wiga wcelgifre, 'the warrior eager for slaughter' ( Glc 999, Phx 486). If the deawig sceaftum of Exodus 344 ('with dew-moist spear-shafts') is really a grimly ironic reference to the usual liquid that covers spears - blood - then perhaps the dewy-feathered eagle is moist not just because 'the sight of drops of water glistening on the bird's feathers after a struggle with a fish on the surface of the sea' appealed to the poets, as M. E. Goldsmith suggested,29 but also because some such observation excited a deeper metaphorical link with the gore of battle (which explicitly spatters the birds in Gen A 2159-61). Indeed, the many references to the plumage of the birds and the coat of the wolf ( Brun 61 sealwigpadan, 62 hasewanpadan, Finn 6 greeghama, Jud 211 sealwig- pada, etc.) can be seen to function as analogues of the armour of warriors. The compound elements pad and hama elsewhere refer to mailcoats ( Beo 2258 herepad, Wald A 17, Jud 192 byrnhoma, El 992 goldhama, Beo 1895 scirhama). Armour, like the wolf, is often grey (Beo 2153, Jud 327 hare byrnan, Beo 334 grcege syrcari). As mailcoats also sing (Beo 226 syrcan hrysedon, 322-3 hringiren scir song in 28 All of these appear before the typescene, with the exception of Finn 6, which is after, and Maid 106-7 which is before and after. The proximity of by man sungon in Ex 159 to the beasts may suggest that, though the text immediately after is garbled, little or none of the text has actually been lost. On the reconstruction of the Exodus passage, see F. C. Robinson, 'Notes on the Old English Exodus', Anglia 80 (1962), 363-78, at 365-8. Trigger and scene are explicitly connected in Jud 206b, where pas indicates that the wolf responds to the din of the shields. 29 M. E. Goldsmith, ' The Seafarer and the Birds', RES 5 (1954), 225-35, at 234. 1 do not agree with Goldsmith that urigfepera is 'empty of meaning' (p. 235). OE deawig may also have had the general meaning 'wet': see E. Ekwall, The Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Place- Names (Oxford, 1974), p. 143. The more general meaning would more readily encourage the association with blood, but might weaken the metaphor. 190</page><page sequence="13">Convention and originality in the 'beasts of battle ' type scene searwum , 327 byrnan hringdon , etc.), it is not surprising that there has been some discussion about whether Finnsburh 6a gylled grceghama refers to the wolf or the mailcoat. Placed between fuge las singad znàguôivudu hlynneÖ , the reference to the greycoat that sings looks both forwards and backwards, and shows that the poet associated these ideas,30 even if no pun is intended. That berserkr may actually have worn wolf-coats (&lt; úlfheÒnar , vargstakkar)?x may suggest that this nexus of ideas had its origins in social practice, but a more complex relationship between the two is, of course, possible. We can, however, conclude that these links between beasts and warriors show how and why the typescene is built into battle description, and that it is formulaic in the sense that it enjoys a relatively fixed relationship with its context. Though the typescene is formulaic, we should not expect the texts to show mechanistic repetition of sets of features in their entirety. The main function of repetition was to enable the audience to recognize the type, but certain kinds and degrees of variation allowed the poets to localize the scene within their themes and prevented the formulaic ossifying into the clichéd. These special effects are created by two techniques which are generated by the formulaic model itself: substitution and highlighting. 32 More rarely the poets added unique features. Each of these requires comment. Substitution in the supposed theme of the hero on the beach, with the beach replaced by a door on the grounds that a door, like a beach, separates two worlds, illustrates how the technique might operate: the audience recognises a conventional similarity in apparently novel dissimilarity, and the aesthetic impact of the novelty is controlled by the audience's expectation. Only two of the texts that contain the beasts of battle typescene do not refer to the wolf directly: Genesis A and The Battle of Maldon. Curiously, though, the slaughterous Vikings in Maldon are described as wcelwulfas (96), and the Elamites in Genesis A are referred to as herewulfa (2015) and hildewulfas (2051). By a more specific and intense use of the powerful, general link in the poetry between beasts and warriors, the hostile warriors in these two instances have been substituted for the third of the usual triad of beasts in the scene, and these compounds should hence be regarded as transferred epithets. Further evidence to support this interpretation may be found in Exodus , where the opposing Egyptian troops are termed hare heorowulfas (181), a phrase which blends them with the wulfas and carleasan 30 See J. R. R. Tolkien, Finn and Mengest : the Fragment and the Episode, ed. A. Bliss (London, 1982), p. 84. 31 See H. R. Ellis Davidson, 'Shape-Changing in the Old Norse Sagas', Animals in Folklore , ed. J. R. Porter and W. M. S. Russell (Cambridge, 1978), pp. 126-42. W. C. Scott, The Oral Nature of the Homeric Simile (Leiden, 1974), p. 71, notes that wolf similes are used of warriors in Homer. 32 On substitution, see A. Renoir, 'Oral-Formulaic Theme Survival: a Possible Instance in the Nibelungenlied* , NM 65 (1964), 70-5. On highlighting, see Scott, Homeric Simile , pp. 46-9. 191</page><page sequence="14">M.S. Griffith deor who have only just been mentioned, whilst the wolves are called mearcweardas (168), 'guardians of the borderland', immediately prior to the labelling of the Egyptians as mearcpreate (173), 'a frontier guard'. In this association may lie an explanation for the unique and repeated feature of the Exodus typescene: the darkness which is said to pervade it, œfenleoô , middum nihtum and possibly cwyldrof. Commenting on eorp werod , F. C. Robinson has remarked: 'Quite possibly the OE poet's reference to the darkness of the Egyptians derives . . . from the common-place explication of the name Mgyptus as tenebrae .'33 The darkness is a new and unexpected feature, but the poet's connection between warriors and beasts allows a specific quality of the one to colour the appearance of the other. Substitution may be seen too in the absence of the 'trigger' of the noise of battle from Beowulf. Only two poems lack this feature. It is also apparently missing from Genesis A 2087-9 and 2159-61. Though the din of shields and spears is heard in line 2061 ( hlyn)y this is too far removed from the scene to be judged a trigger. It is possible that the noise that is mentioned before the first appearance of the beasts in Genesis 1983 was felt by the poet to trigger the entire section, but this must remain speculation. In Beowulf , however, the trigger could not be present in its normal form because the scene does not contain a battle; it is an ornamental use of the topos. Commenting on the distinctive features of this passage, Bonjour astutely observes: But here, for the first and only time, the motive of the harp is successfully conveyed to set off the theme of the beasts of battle. So that the stirring contrast between the sound of the harp and the harsh voice of the carrion beasts really fuses the hackneyed theme into a haunting symbol of human transitoriness.34 The music of the harp can be seen as a substitution for the clarion call of the trumpet, whilst the poet's invocation of the harmonious pleasures of the hall contrasts also with the terrifying sounds of battle usually heard before the beasts appear. In concluding this section, a caveat should be added: the technique of substitution was of necessarily limited use to the poet, for if the scene was over-burdened with such transformations, the audience might not recognise the underlying motif that was the key to its meaning. Highlighting, or intensification, is a more transparent device: an idea of the scene that is traditional, but of especial importance to the narrative may be repeated several times. Though untraditional, the repetition of the idea of darkness in the Exodus passage already mentioned shows how the technique works. So, in Elene, for example, the poet is most interested by the convention that the beasts express their desires: this is repeated five times in the seven lines 33 F. C. Robinson, 'The Significance of Names in Old English Literature', Anglia 86 (1968), 14- 58, at 26. 34 Bonjour, 'Beowulf and the Beasts', p. 570. 192</page><page sequence="15">Convention and originality in the 'beasts of battle} typescene of the scene. Other kinds of repetition ensure that this key notion is impressed upon the reader. All instances occur in the b- verse in verses which are all of Bliss's Type E (see lines 27, 28, 29, 52, 112),35 and which share some syntactic similarities (e.g. the positioning of the verb at the end of the verse, preceded, in all but 52b, by the direct object). The formula X sangahof occurs twice. Stepsis and Rand rightly note that the poem is 'structured around a repeated series of verbal motifs',36 and one of these is the motif of song which is far more prominent than in the source, The Acts of Saint Cyriacus. The battles are especially noisy (see lines 18-19, 24-5, 50-1, 54-5, 109-10), and the victory is given to Constantine only after the standard of the cross is raised and a song of victory chanted: Fa wses ķ&gt;uf hafen, segn for sweotum, sigeleoõ galen. (123-4) In her speech to the thousand learned Jews, Elene quotes Moses and David singing (333-49). Judas, released from the pit, refers, in his plea to God to reveal the secret location of the cross, to the singing of the cherubim (743-9). Whilst the crowd awaits a miracle to make clear which of the three unearthed crosses is Christ's, men of renown sit and raise aloft their singing: Gesaeton sigerofe sang ahofon, raedķeahtende, ymb ķ&gt;a roda ķ&gt;reo oõ ķ&gt;a nigoõan tid, haefdon neowne gefean maerõum gemeted. (867-70) There are references to the singing of the prophets (1 1 52-5, 1 1 88-90). Finally, in the epilogue, Cynewulf mentions the act of divine grace by which he was given the ability to sing (1250). A series of verbal repetitions - an aspect of Cynewulfian style that has been remarked on37 - links the passages (27 fyrdleoÒ ago 1, 124 sigeleoÒ galen , 342 dryhtleoÖ agol' 28 wcelrune ne maÒ , 1 108 hy germe ne maÒ, 333 haiige rune' 29 earn sang ahof 112 Wulf sang ahof 867 sang ahofon' 110 hrefn weorces gefeah, 869 haf don neowne gefean). At moments of crisis and of triumph, then, the poem is punctuated by the motif of song, and the chief purpose seems to be to show that, just as one standard, the tree of life, replaces another, the boar emblem, and just as one Judas, Judas/Cyriacus, replaces another, Judas Iscariot, so a new kind of singing, a Christian hymn, 35 See A. J. Bliss, The Metre of Beowulf (Oxford, 1967), p. 123. 36 R. Stepsis and R. Rand, 'Contrast and Conversion in Cynewulf 's Elene' NM 70 (1969), 273- 82, at 280. 37 See E. R. Anderson, Cynewulf: Structure, Style and Theme in his Poetry (Fairleigh, 1983), pp. 54-67. 193</page><page sequence="16">M.S. Griffith reinterprets and replaces the heroic song of battle. As has often been said, the central conflict in Elene is that between Christianity and paganism, and this is figured most succinctly in the choice that Elene starkly offers Judas: Fe synt tu gearu, swa lif swa deaõ, swa ķe leofre biõ to geceosanne. (605-7) The heroic song is intimately associated with death (28 wœlrune , 53 w ceifei, 112 wœlhreowa ), the new song with divine intervention (123-4, 867-70, 1096- 1103). The cross, in the end, seems to be not just the source of the poet's conversion, it is also the inspiration for his own song, the poem itself (see 1250a leoöucrceft onleac, and lines 1251-6). Cynewulf tailors the typescene to suit his own poetic requirements, but he does not do this by departing from the conventions; rather, he redeploys the materials to hand in order to give the typescene a new force and direction without altering its constituents.38 Unique thematic and lexical features are necessarily rare and, with the exception of the wolf in Judith 205, are apparently confined to two texts - Brunanburh and Exodus. The darkness of the Exodus scene, the description of the raven there as a chooser of the slain and that of the eagle in Brunanburh as a grey-plumaged, white-tailed war-hawk are without counterparts in the rest of the corpus. It is no coincidence that most of these remarkable ideas are expressed in language that is also unusual or unique. Cwyldrof , guòhafoc , hasewanpadan and wcelceasega are hapax legom ena, and œfenleoô occurs elsewhere only at Exodus 201. The adverb ceftan is extremely rare, and the DOE records other use only in a Wulfstan homily. 39 Cwyldrof is obscure in meaning and has been much discussed.40 Some of these features may occur as a result of local contextualizing, as has been argued above in the case of the darkness of the Exodus passage, but a strong case can also be made for foreign literary influence. Roberta Frank has argued that the hapax legomena in this section of Exodus all 'allude to a familiar skaldic motif,41 and the process of contextuali- zation cannot explain why the poet chose rare language to express the motif of darkness. J. D. Niles points out that encomium - the likely genre of Brunanburh 38 For another example of intensification, note the emphasis on slaughter in the Exodus scene - drihtneum , wcelceasega , cetes , Jyl - which grimly anticipates the expected, but in the event unrealized, consequence of the Egyptians catching the Israelites. On the typescene in Elene , see D. K. Fry, 'Themes and Type-Scenes in Elene , 1-1 13', Speculum 44 (1969), 35-45. 39 A Microfiche Concordance to Old English , comp. R. L. Venezky and A. diPaolo Healey (Toronto, 1980), ceftan: WHom 20.1.59, 20.2.67, 20.3.61, in passages that are virtually identical. 40 For the most important discussion of this word, see J. R.

Nevertheless, such features also suggest that the poets were alert to the difference between type and cliché. Other kinds of variation are possible and do occur. Structural variation is to be expected, for, if genre influences structure, then the formal diversity of these narratives should result in differing treatments of the typescene. By contrast, typescenes in The Iliad all occur in the same genre, epic, and a certain homogeneity might follow from this. For example, the motifs here, unlike those in certain Homeric scenes, are not fixed in their sequence. There is some favouring of the order 'raven', 'eagle', 'wolf, but the orders 'eagle', 'raven', 'wolf (Ex), and 'wolf, 'raven', 'eagle' (Jud) do occur. Ordering is not, however, entirely free, for two arrangements do not occur: 'raven', 'wolf, 'eagle' and 'eagle', 'wolf, 'raven'. There are too few instances of the scene for the conclusion to be drawn that these sequences were actually forbidden, but a refusal to split the birds is perhaps understandable, though it has contributed to editors' difficulties in disambiguating them. In addition, the scene may appear ornamentally, outside battle narrative, representing symbolically in Beowulf ' along with the fire of the funeral pyre, the promise of future exile and morning-cold spears, all of the miseries which the unnamed messenger of Wiglaf fears will befall the Geats, and giving the false impression in Exodus that the flight of the Israelites from the Egyptian army was almost like a battle. In Beowulf ' Finnsburh 5-7 and Genesis A 2159-61, the beasts are referred to in speeches: of the messenger to the Geats after Beowulf s death, of Hnaef to the Danes in Finnsburh, and of Abraham to the King of Sodom after the defeat of the Elamites. The repetitions of the scene in Finnsburh and Genesis A authenticate the words of Hnaef and Abraham. 'The birds are singing, the grey-coated one howls', says Hnaef, perceiving that an attack has begun, and in the battle proper the dark and dusky raven arrives. Abraham's comment that he has seen carrion birds all smeared with blood is not empty repetition of what we already know from the narrator's statement in lines 2087-9, for it proves Abraham's victory to the king, who need not now fear renewed assault. The beasts also appear twice in Elene and Judith, and in these too the purpose is thematic reinforcement. The poets also display considerable freedom in their placing of the scene: although generally located before battle, it is placed after the battle in Brunanburh and Genesis A 2087-9 and 2159-61, 42 J. D. Niles, 'Skaldic Technique in Brunanburh' Scandinavian Stud. 59 (1987), 356-66. 195</page><page sequence="18">M. S. Griffith and in the midst of conflict in Finnsburh 34-5 and Judith 295-6. Finally, the straightforwardness of the relationship between the scene and its context varies. In Maldon and Judith , the sequence of ideas and the link between the picture and the narrative context is transparent, but this is not the case with the Beowulf passage, as Bonjour has pointed out: in the parallel passages the straightforward use of a traditional theme is largely conventional, whereas in Beowulf the indirect use of a conventional theme is largely original . . . Here, indeed, the beasts of battle are briefly turned into a symbol of the ultimate triumph of death, the common destiny of dynasties, and the final fate of man.43 Formalist analysis of conventions cannot, perhaps, adequately prepare us for this kind of free treatment. The intensity and the elegiac power of the end of Beowulf is rooted in the traditional, but this underlying structure has been radically transformed and the result is both poignant and extraordinary. None of the above is intended to show that the poets composed their works orally. The focus of formulaic studies has shifted from the mode of compo- sition to the manner of it. It is the poets' rhetoric that is the proper subject of formulaic analysis. What then distinguishes this rhetoric from classical rhetoric, and differentiates formulaic analysis from rhetorical analysis of a more conventional kind? Much of the terminology of this article could be translated into classical rhetorical terms. The definition of the typescene is similar to that of the technique of ecphrasis' separable or self-contained, decorative description, usually of a stock subject, which can be inserted at an appropriate place in a discourse and which has the effect of delaying narrative movement. Certainly, the scene of the beasts is largely self-contained, its subject is manifestly stock, and it does delay narrative movement. E. R. Curtius notes that medieval writers used ecphrasis lavishly.44 Intensification may then be seen as commoratio by another name, for by this figure a strong point is emphasized by repeating it several times in varying language. Substitution could be seen as a combination of aposiopesis , by which an idea like 'wolf, though unexpressed, is clearly perceived, and of metonymy , the trope by which a term for one notion is used in place of another term for another notion related to the first notion by cause and effect, or by contiguity. The transferred epithets wcelwulfas for Vikings and herefhildewulfas for Elami tes are métonymie because the transfer of language has been encouraged by the physical contiguity of men and beasts and by the fact that the actions of the one cause the actions of the other. Less central aspects of the typescene could, doubtless, be described 43 Bonjour, ' Beowulf and the Beasts', p. 569. 44 E. R. Curtius, European Eiter ature and the Eatin Middle Ages , trans. W. R.

Johnson has analysed the use of ^eugma in the beasts of battle scene in Brunanburh , and regards the relative elaboration of the scene in this poem as evidence of 'embellished verbal figures in Old English heroic poetry';45 W. F. Bolton has argued that there are only five instances of more than two-fold variation in the poem, one of which is the beasts of battle passage, that these variations increase in elaboration or grammatical complexity as the poem develops, and set off its four main sections, which, according to Bolton, have a numerical pattern.46 Promising though this translation looks, there are two problems it faces. First, the lack of lexical variety for the beasts is suggestive of stylistic economy, but dilation is normal in the medieval use of ecphrasis . Secondly, we tend to think of classical rhetorical tropes and figures as inessential ornaments freely chosen by the poets to embellish their narrative as they thought fitting, but the elements and motifs of the typescene as revealed by formulaic analysis look to be more functional and necessary components of the poetic form, in which even some apparently original aspects on closer scrutiny seem to be generated by convention. Formulaic theory still has a place in Old English critical studies as long as it is concerned with the development of a rhetoric that can most economically describe the stylistic features of the texts themselves.
