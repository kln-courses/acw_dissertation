<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE GHOST (S) OF THE AUTHOR(S) PAST, PRESENT, AND FUTURE: A LITERARY-REFLEXIVE PERSPECTIVE ON AUTHORSHIP IN THE POEMS OF JEAN DE MEUN AND MARTIN LE FRANC In a recent article addressing the semiotic analysis of theatrical performance, Marvin Carlson advances a dynamic notion of 'performance intertextuality' by which an audience's appreciation of an actor's 'stage figure' is influenced by their knowledge of this actor's theatrical biography: The 'invisible but inevitable' ghosts of previous roles in the theatre has certain parallels to the phenomenon of intertextuality in reading, where 'ghosts' of previous reading experiences continually condition our activity, though the phenomenological presence of the actor in different performance texts gives this phenomenon a particularly complex and powerful quality in the theatre.1 The analytical lens of 'ghosting' through which Carlson reads the interpretative, connotative activity of a play's audience vis-à-vis an actor's performance may equally be applied, in a literary domain, to a readerly interpretation of the creative activity of authorial composition when this activity is engaging self- consciously with a prior text through citation, allusion, or rewriting. Further- more, as Carlson identifies the 'particularly complex and powerful quality' of performance intertextuality owing to the phenomenological presence of the actor, so a similar peculiarly dynamic quality of literary intertextuality results when it is the person of the author of a previous work with whom the present writer seeks to engage: issues of Bloomian 'anxiety of influence' are raised as the writer vies, negotiates, or disputes with his predecessor in such a way that this ancestor is him- or herself felt phenomenologically to be present. This sense of spectral presence is conveyed by certain late-medieval poets, who turn to account the convention of the dream-vision2 to conjure up the ghosts of past authorities in order to serve a variety of purposes. For example, in Honoré Bouvet's Appańcion maistre Jean de Meun (1398), the late-thirteenth- century continuator of the Roman de la Rose is felt by Bouvet's narrator-persona (l'Acteur)3 as both a psychological and a physical presence: resting in the garden of Jean de Meun's former residence, Bouvet's Acteur sees in 'ymaginacion' the embodied ghost of his illustrious ancestor: 'Mais vecy venir un grant clerc bien fouré de menu ver.'4 He senses the authority of this 'grant clerc' and is moved to acknowledge his own inferiority to the 'maistre': 'Car je ne sauroye pas estudier comme vous feistes jadiz.'5</page><page sequence="2">236 Medium Mv um lxxiii.z Issues of voice are also brought to the fore by the way that Bouvet ventriloquizes a fictionalized Jean de Meun, and it is on this point that Carlson's 'ghosting' proves a useful analytical lens through which to reread certain late- medieval manifestations of literary intertextuality. The performance theorist notes that ghostly reading records the slippage or process of fusion that occurs between an actor's previous and present roles. In the literary text, this slippage occurs between voices and entails an attempt at identifying who is responsible for a given 'langage poétique' that is read, as Julia Kristeva has long established, ťau moins, comme double'.6 What renders the classic Kristevian model of intertextuality inadequate for my purposes is its tendency to evacuate the speaker from his or her speech in the 'mosaïque de citations' that she perceives to constitute a text; indeed, the fundamental tenet of her seminal exposition of intertextuality seems to be the elimination of all subjectivity: 'A la place de la notion d'intersubjectivité s'installe celle d ' intertextualité?1 I propose here a rereading of intertextuality in light of its manifestations in certain late-medieval poems. I argue that a form of interpersonality is congruent with and often operates alongside the recycling of text. Such an awareness of the presence of a previous person as the prior speaker of a given utterance, or even (as we shall see to be the case in one of my chosen works) the personification of a text as itself an 'actor' in dialogue with its author, privileges the idea of speech as an embodied voice just as the words which scold Honoré Bouvet's narrator- persona - 'sy me commença a tancer'8 - are perceived to be indissociable from the voice which utters them and thus from the authority that this voice, that of 'maistre Jehan de Meun', represents. My discussion of ghostly intertextuality takes as its starting point the issue suggested by my reading of Carlson: the slipperiness of voice. I shall be drawing on two strands of modern critical thought to develop a specifically literary application of 'ghosting', namely Bakhtinian dialogism and polyphony, and Derridean spectrality. These discourses will assist me in explaining how the ghosting of voice might be considered a significant feature of late-medieval approaches to adapting antecedent material, the practice commonly referred to as translatio studii , which, as Rita Copeland has shown, applied to vernacular as well as classical auctores and came to operate as a hermeneutic as much as a linguistic enterprise in the later Middle Ages.9 The issue of voice and the structure of utterance are central to Bakhtin's perception that language is essentially 'dialogic': every speech act springs from previous utterances and is structured in expectation of a future response, being, in his terms, 'doubly-oriented' discourse.10 Bakhtin's useful tool for describing the recycling of language is particularly apt to the analysis of voice in late-medieval French poetry, a corpus in which, as critics such as Johnson have noted, writers negotiated their 'creative place or space' through the imaginative 'constant use and reuse' of 'the stock at hand' of existing material.11 Bakhtin's dialogism, in a similar way to Kristeva's intertextuality (which took its lead from Bakhtin), principally addresses utterance as discourse already separated from the voice that utters it. My own study wishes to highlight,</page><page sequence="3">The Ghost(S) of the Author(S) 237 conversely, the embodiment of this utterance in a voice as an author-function,12 which, unlike Barthes's famously 'dead' author, is felt to be very much alive by the writer who encounters or inherits a previously voiced utterance: this encounter can be seen to be dramatized in Bouveťs narrator's conversation with his apparition as he quakes before Jean de Meun's superior skill at versification: Mais quant je Toys parler par ryme, je le pensay aucunement, se luy respondy: 'Sire, pardonnes moy, car en vérité je ne vous sauray pas tres bien parler par vers.' The inheriting writer engages in the sort of interpersonal intertextual negotiation that is depicted by Derrida in his work of political philosophy Spectres de Marx. In this work, Derrida postulates a responsibility for twentieth- century readers, as heirs of Marx, to 'have it out with' ('s'expliquer avec') the spectres of this political authority that come back or are conjured from the grave as revenants in a 'spectropoli tical' process.13 This negotiation entails considerable anxiety on the part of the inheritor. The above example of Bouvet's Apparìcion suggests that Derrida's 'spectropolitics' may readily be transposed into the literary domain as a ťspectropoetic' discourse to articulate certain late-medieval poets' experience of a confrontation, in the very act of writing, with the ghosts of past poets. Looming largest in the French vernacular corpus is, of course, the totemie spectre of Jean de Meun. What is the purpose and function of this interpersonal intertextuality as elaborated by the hermeneutic and linguistic tools provided by Derrida and Bakhtin? To answer this question, we should look to the texts that it is my aim to explore in this article: Jean de Meun's Rose continuation (r. 127 5), 14 Martin Le Franc's Champion des dames (¿' 1442), 15 a debate poem in the tradition of pro- and anti-feminist polemic known as the querelle des femmes ,16 and its curious sequel, La Complainte du livre du ' Champion des dames ' a maistre Martin Le Franc son acteur , extant in only one manuscript (Paris, Bibliothèque Nationale de France, MS f. fr. 12476, fols 148-1 5ov), which was presented to Philippe le Bon in c. 145 1, and in which it is juxtaposed with the Champion}1 It is this latter poem's apparendy unremarkable, if not downright antagonistic, reception at the duke's court that the Complainte seeks both to explain and redress through a dialogue between Livre (the book Le Champion des dames) and L'Acteur (its author, who is simultaneously the implied author of the new Complainte). Despite appearing quite diverse in form, date, and manuscript tradition,18 all three works may be seen, as I shall show, to share a particularly acute awareness of issues of authorship, and to be born through a conscious interaction with ghostly authorial presences: 'dans l'entretien, la compagnie ou le compagnonnage ... des fantômes' (SM, p. 15). The principal spectre for Jean de Meun is his predecessor, Guillaume de Lorris, while Martin Le Franc is haunted by the Rose continuator himself since the Champion sustains the argument against Jean de Meun as an alleged misogynist that was first kindled by the earlier querelle du * Roman de la Rose * (c. 1400-4), the literary debate about the Rose continuator's</page><page sequence="4">238 Medium tEvum lxxiii.2 poetics which arguably only reinforced Jean de Meun's status as the first French vernacular auctońtas ,19 The third ghost in question is, as I have already indicated, the book of the Champion itself as it appears in a dream-vision to its Acteur. As scholars such as David Huit, Anne Berthelot, Jacqueline Cerquiglini- Toulet, and Cynthia J. Brown have shown, poetic practice from the thirteenth to the fifteenth centuries was increasingly preoccupied with issues and problems of authorship. David Huit demonstrates how miniatures taken from several Rose manuscripts focalize different attitudes towards the poem's dual authorship in the diverse ways that they illustrate the passage in which Jean de Meun succeeds Guillaume as composer of the composite work - a passage on which I shall be focusing my textual analysis below.20 For the later fourteenth century, Jacqueline Cerquiglini-Toulet indicates how Guillaume de Machaut thematizes in his dits the tasks of authorship and also, especially in his Livre du voir dit (i 364), how he plays with 'literary polyphony' as part of his problemat- ization of the poet's narratorial stance as an actorial 'je'.21 The Voir Dit ostensibly records the exchanges of correspondence in prose and verse between a fictional personnage de narrateur',22 Guillaume, and his lady, Toute Belle. Their liaison, sparked by Toute Belle's admiration from afar of Guillaume by reputation rather than by any physical meeting, unfolds through their correspondence. The Voir Dit thus provides a notable instance of voice 'ghosting' in the characters' dialogic interaction through a literary medium of communication. Toute Belle appears deliberately to follow her lover 'comme son double fan tomai' (SM, p. 201): she imitates his formal schemes - Ains me respondi proprement De tel metre et de tel rime Com li rondiaus, que j'ai fait, rime ( VD , lines 2898-900)23 - and initiates a lexical enchaînement that forges dialogic links between their rondeaux, responding 'Sans euer, de moi pas ne vous partirés' (line 2797) to his incipit 'Sans euer, dolens de vous, departirai' (line 2789). Any discrete division between present 'self (the first-person Guillaume) and absent 'other' (represented here through Toute Belle) as speaking subjects is undone by the textual interaction of voices that we may consider as a haunting of one by the other, as the tracing of a residue from one discourse to another. This haunting is at the core of the Derridean 'spectrality effect': Il faut peut-être se demander si V effet de spectralité ne consiste pas a déjouer cette opposition, voire cette dialectique, entre la présence effective et son autre. ( SM , P. 72)24 Toute Belle's activity of imitation and citation may be seen as a mise en aby me of the sort of haunted dialogue in which I see certain late-medieval writers to be engaging with past authors. My analysis of Machaut's lovers' fictional communication within the text may be extrapolated to an examination of an author's intertextual dialogue with those poets whom he wishes to imitate,</page><page sequence="5">The Ghost(S) of the Author(S) 239 whether respectfully or subversively, such that the process of authorship effectively constitutes ťle temps de 1' "apprendre à vivre" . . . apprendre à vivre avec les fantômes' (SM, pp. i4f.). The author-function in my trio of poems is particularly complex and intriguing. Its elucidation through the critical apparatus provided by Bakhtin and Derrida will reveal how each writer may be seen to use the interpersonal intertextuality of overlapping or conflicting voices to two complementary ends: to explore his creative space as an author, as Johnson suggests, and to enrich the text's audience's hermeneutic pleasure by encouraging them to engage actively with the intertextualities that the writer promotes as part of the meaning-creating process for the present work. In both Martin Le Franc's Complainte and Jean de Meun's Rose , there occurs a doubling through time of the authorial position, thereby creating a sort of intertextuality within each work. In the Complainte , the book of the Champion returns to its25 author (l'Acteur) after its initial audience reception and asserts itself as an autonomous, contestatory voice who is a victim, he claims, of 'trayson' (C, line 241) committed by l'Acteur. In the Rose , most notably in the central passage of the whole work, the slippery succession between its two authors, the late Guillaume de Lorris and Jean de Meun,26 takes place with the 'senefiance' (RR, line 16) and persona of the former's text lingering to haunt that of his continuator through a particular process of interpretative translatio from an 'art d'amors' (ibid., line 38) into a multifaceted, heterogeneous 'miroer aus amoureus' (ibid., line 10655). The process of spectral dialogism described by Derrida in the exordium to his Spectres de Marx seems precisely to articulate this medieval phenomenon of authorial doubling: Ce qui se passe entre deux, et entre tous les 'deux' qu'on voudra, comme entre vie et mort, cela ne peut que s'entretenir de quelque fantôme. Il faudrait alors apprendre les esprits. (SM, p. 14) In order to appreciate the ghostly games of authorship at work in these two texts I therefore believe that, for us also as critics, it is necessary to learn spirits and to appreciate the diverse, often complementary media - aural, visual, tactile - through which medieval authors imagined themselves to be conversing with their predecessors: in the Rose continuation, it is very much the vocis imagine, to quote Rhabanus Maurus,27 of Guillaume de Lorris which appears to us through the text whilst, in the Complainte, and as we shall see later, Livre is characterized as a physical, visualized entity as well as being l'Acteur's interlocutor. The applicability of Derrida's theory of spectrality as a tool for explaining authorship issues in late-medieval poetics is born out diversely by Jean de Meun and Martin Le Franc. In the latter's Complainte, on a narrative level, we encounter the revenant himself as Livre appears to l'Acteur in a dream-vision. The book's appearance is a second coming that is temporally unexpected by its host:</page><page sequence="6">24o Medium My um lxxiii. 2 Oncques ne cuiday que si tost Deussiez devers moy retourner. (C, lines 65^) In other words, as in Shakespeare's Hamlet , we witness 'la réapparition du spectre comme apparition pour la première fois dans la pièce' (SM, p. 2 2). 28 Allusion to this iterative ontology may be construed as one of the senses of l'Acteur's opening statement that his dream made his book speak 'anew' ( nouvellement ): Songe ... A fait parler nouvellement Ung de mes livres contre moy. ( C ' lines 1, 5f.) Another implication of the adverb 'nouvellement' could be the new relation- ship between author and text that this dream-vision signifies.29 The text returns, having already been released previously from authorial control, and l'Acteur underscores his book's drift from his ('Martin's') authorial intention as he berates Livre's timorous performance before the court: ťDe toy mesmes t'es reculé' ( C ' line 105). Having reappeared to his author, the book is then sent back to reappear to his audience with the implication that his self-presentation has been revised - his resistance to the bite of criticism reinforced - as a result of the Complainte* s dialogue, notwithstanding its fearful prevarication before it finally departs from l'Acteur: Retourner? Las! Je n'oseroye, J 'ay esté trop durement mors. Las! Comment y retourneroye? (C, lines 3 8 9 - 9 1 ) As well as serving to animate the personality of Livre, the chiastic repetition of 'retourner' which frames this histrionic outburst highlights the radical disruption of linear temporality that is provoked by the revenanfs plan to return to court: Livre anxiously anticipates a repetition of his past rejection, fearing 'the future-to-come': 'ce qui viendra dans l'à- venir . . . comme "expérience" du passé comme à venir' (SM, p. 16). Its outburst effectively articulates the complex connection that binds past, present, and future performances in dialogic interrelation, each haunting the others, and evokes the unpredictability of his own future apparition.30 Therefore, as the spectre abrupdy vanishes - 'en l'air vola hastivemenť (C, line 468) - the question of the text's 'hauntology' ('hantologie', SM , p. 16), of the next stage of its spectral (re) appearance, is highlighted. The figure of the phantom book focuses critical attention on the literary reflexive, writerly issues of textual revision and text as performance, and on the processes of (past or future) reception and transmission. In the Rose , spectrality and the activity of phantoms are discernible on two levels: concerning the author as heir to Guillaume de Lorris, and as regards writing itself as a haunting/haunted, dialogic enterprise. I propose that the central passage of the Rose , which presents the relay of authorial voice between Guillaume and Jean de Meun, manifests a notion of textual continuation whose</page><page sequence="7">The Ghost(S) of the Author(S) 241 most exciting and thought-provoking explanation may be provided by a Derridean apparatus of spectres, which will, moreover, appear remarkably suited to such an exercise. Thinking of the deceased first author as a ghostly presence maintained in being by his heir's discourse leads the reader to adopt a peculiar perspective, tending his or her thoughts: . . . non pas vers la mort mais vers une sur-vie . . . une survie dont la possibilité vient d'avance disjoindre ou désajuster l'identité à soi du présent vivant. (SM, pp. i?f.) The complex temporality of such a perspective seems to be what underpins one fifteenth-century miniaturist's visualization of the relationship between the two Rose authors. The illustrator of New York, Pierpont Morgan Library, MS 948, fol. 44, represents the hiatus between the two Rose authors by juxtaposing Guillaume de Lorris's corpse exposed naked on a table, as if awaiting dissection, with a living, clothed figure pictured waiting with arms folded outside the door to this book-lined room, as if in need of a cue to enter stage left and take up the act of narration as the subject acting upon Guillaume as object (see Fig. I).31 The living continuator- figure ensures the sur-vie both of the narrative commenced by the now-deceased Guillaume and, in some sense, of the late author himself. We shall see in textual terms how the multiple voices that are implied by the illustrated continuator- figure (dreamed lover, 'personnage de narrateur', past, present, and future author(s)), are contained in unmerged harmony within the Acteur - the ludic T - of Jean de Meun's ghostly persona.32 The concept of writing as a haunting/haunted activity raises, in Jean de Meun's case, issues of both authorship and authority pertaining to the medieval writer's conception of himself as a translator, selectively inheriting the strands of the past that he wishes to transpose for his own purposes. Christine de Pizan cites his implementation of this literary technique as precedent for her own citations: ť. . . ne s'ayda pas Jehan de Meun en son livre de la rose des dis de Lauris?' In this technique lies the key to artistic excellence: 'la gist la maistrise'.33 The Rose continuator both 'helps himself to' and ťis helped along by' (s'ayda de) his predecessor's (pre)text, and this 'helping' is by no means a hermeneutically neutral enterprise. As Rita Copeland states regarding the rhetoric of vernacular translation, the poet's modus inveniendi becomes assimilable to a modus interpretanda and this hermeneutic translation of sources is demonstrated textually through the process of citation by which the vernacular author defines his relationship with both classical or patristic auctońtates and his vernacular predecessors. Citation - a form of translation which, as we have already seen in the 1 Voir Difs imitative lyrics, 'refigures, through interpretative reception and transference, what has previously been known in a different textual condition'35 - is thus a dialogic operation which may be understood to carry over into the new 'textual condition' the spectral residue of the words' previous usage and of the voice which uttered them; such is the process implicit in the opening of Jean de Meun's portion of the Rose. The persona's exclamation,</page><page sequence="8">242 Medium ¿Evum lxxiii.2 Fig. 1. The Pierpont Morgan Library, New York, MS M. 948, fol. 44'. By permission.</page><page sequence="9">The Ghost(S) of the Author(S) 243 'Desespoir! Las! Je non ferai' (RR, line 4060) and subsequent affirmation, 'En lui [ = esperance] me dois reconforter' (ibid., line 4063), function in dialogic interaction with the abrupt ending of Guillaume's text to accord sur-vie to Guillaume's narrator's surrender to despair: 'durement sui esmaiez' (ibid., line 4051). Jean's 'personnage de narrateur' appears consoled of the grief that afflicted his predecessor's textual being, with his choice of prefix - 'réconforter' - serving linguistically to recuperate the traductio of verbs of despair which concluded Guillaume's lament: Si en ai duel et desconfort: James n'iert riens qui me confort. {RR, lines 405 3 f.) The final line of Guillaume's portion - 'Si je n'ai mes aillors fiance' (RR, line 4056) - persists spectrally in the residual form of the direct object pronoun ('l") which substitutes for 'fiance' in Jean's opening speculation: 'Et si je T'ai perdu, espoir' (ibid., line 4057). The act of continuation is haunted by the voice of the text that is being continued. Derrida offers a striking observation about every human's inevitable, daily interaction with the spectres that prey upon our minds: everyone (and especially every writer) proceeds 'chacun lisant, pensant, agissant, écrivant avec ses fantômes' (SM, p. 222). Jean de Meun interacts similarly and dialogically with a ghost, that of Guillaume de Lorris, since he cannot avoid inheriting his predecessor's text without negotiating and conversing with its writer's spectre. Textual encounters with Guillaume are both inevitable and necessary in the continuator's enterprise of continuation through rewriting: 'Il faut parler du fantôme, voire au fantôme et avec lui' (SM, p. 1 5). The reappearance of Guillaume's voice in the first appearance of Jean's persona thus signals the opening up of the text to a plurality of competing voices even as the dead are made to live again. Fundamental to the apparent ease with which I have shown the thresholds between death and life, and between past and present voices, to be permeated in Jean de Meun's Rose and Le Franc's Complainte is the dialogic nature of 'the relationship to another's word' that prevailed in the late Middle Ages. Bakhtin describes this slippery relationship in his essay 'From the prehistory of novelistic discourse': The boundary lines between someone else's speech and one's own speech were flexible, ambiguous, often deliberately distorted and confused.36 In this essay, Bakhtin explores the way in which a given utterance may be, not just the representation of something, but also a representation of another, previous speech act such that it is 'double-voiced', carrying the ghosdy echo of a past speaker/author.37 Double-voiced speech can thus be seen as a self- reflexive gesture, promoting interrogation of the utterance as a way of exploring how language is inherited and transmitted; hence my image of writing - specifically of the processes of translatio, citation, and continuation - as a haunting and haunted activity. A word, such as the citation of the first line of Le Champion des dames by l'Acteur in the Complainte, is consciously 'double-</page><page sequence="10">244 Medium Mv um lxxiii. 2 voiced'; l'Acteur upbraids Livre: Tu as cuidié du premier sault Que l'en criast a la trompette 'A l'assault, dames, a l'assault!' (C, lines 177-9) The intersection of voices is quite complex here: the current Acteur ventriloquizes the performance given by Livre of the cry that opened L'Acteur's past composition, the Champion ; this cry was heard within the diegesis of the Champion by Le Franc's dreaming personnage de narrateur' (another Acteur), and signalled the start of this Acteur's oneiric adventure. A more limpid way of expressing this complexity may be achieved by marrying Bakh tin's and Derrida's terminology of double-voicing and haunting; a spectre of 'the already-spoken-about'38 accompanies the word when it is given utterance in a new context: the Complainte' s Acteur's utterance is haunted (or 'ghosted') by the previous voicings of this utterance by Livre and by l'Acteur of the Champion. A sort of slippery polyphony results that equally can be seen to occur when the author, through his diegetic personae, chooses to engage dialogically with these spectres of past discourses. At one point in Le Champion des dames , Franc Vouloir - the eponymous champion - pursues his championing of women's cause by affirming his support of Alain Chartier's controversial feminine speaker from La Belle Dame sans mercy (c. 1424) through a strategic 'ghosting' of words uttered by the lover in Chartier's poem. This lover transgressed his courtly code of conduct when he castigated his lady metonymically as ťcueur plus dur que le noir marbre'39 because she refused to accept his amorous advances. Franc Vouloir takes issue with this ťmal disant' (CD, line 1901) perspective on the Belle Dame by rejecting the critical opinion of those who view her as ťdame au euer noircy' (ibid., line 1904). Le Franc's Champion reinforces his defence of the maligned lady by the way he incorporates into his pro-women argument the title of one, anonymous pro-Belle Dame sequel to Chartier's poem that is recorded in manuscript rubrication as 'la dame lealle en amours';40 Franc Vouloir states: Ou paradis d'Amours repose L'esprit de la dame leale ( CD , lines 192 if.) By ghosting the title of the sequel he enriches the hermeneutic interest of his utterance's intertextual dialogue with Chartier's Belle Dame. The plurality of utterances that may be perceptible in a single spectral inheritance are revealed in book in of the Champion as Franc Vouloir casts himself as continuator of Guillaume de Machaut's œuvre , addressing several of its textual voices in turn as shadows that accompany the inherited word.41 He considers firstly, in the third person, the 'personnage de narrateur' of the Jugement dou Roj de Behaignê *2 as a case history in need of closure: Or je retourne a parfiner Le dit de l'amant qui contoit</page><page sequence="11">The Ghost(S) of the Author(S) 245 Que cueur leal vivre et finer En parfaicte leaulté doibt ( CD , lines 1 2697-700) The objective of closure is foregrounded by the rhetorical devices of traductio ('parfiner'/'finer') and paronomasia ('parfiner'/'parfaicte'). The Champion then turns to address the Jugemenť s 'narrateur- amant' directly in exhortation, as if intervening in the déroulement of Machauťs poem's diegesis: Amant doncques qui promis as Cueur, corps, volente et pensee, Avise toy que tu feras. (CD, lines 1 2721- 3) This transition in address from third-person to second-person voices demonstrates the essential role of the voice in the concept of spectrality that I wish to promulgate and that Derrida explains thus: On ne peut parler de générations de crânes ou d'esprits . . . qu'à la condition de la langue - et de la voix, en tout cas de ce qui marque le nom ou en tient lieu. (SM, p. 30) Franc Vouloir initially ťmarks the name' of Machauťs narrative voice before taking its place' in a spectral return to the text as he turns to exhort Machauťs own intradiegetic character. The Champion next moves from speaking to the diegetic persona to address the extratextual author (as a third person) as he takes issue with his fourteenth-century poetic ancestor's verdict to the Jugement 'Je ne m'acorde au jugement / Machauť ( CD , lines 1 2737f.).43 Such a reopening of the earlier judgement seems to suggest that the motivation for spectral revisitation is a pursuit of justice akin to the justice-seeking aim that Derrida theorizes as the essential motive for confronting spectres: Si je m'apprête à parler longuement de fantômes, d'héritage et de générations de fantômes ... c'est au nom de la justice. (SM, p. 1 5) What is unusual about Le Franc's Champion's decision to revisit the Roy de Behaignčs judgement is that it marks the resurrection of a ghost that had already been laid to rest by Machaut himself in his later Jugement dou Roy de Navarre u which reversed the verdict of the earlier poem. The justice-seeking impulse which motivates a dialogue with ghosts may usefully be seen as the ostensible governing principle of the late-medieval Rose quereile in its anti-ifore lobby's endeavours to bring to book Jean de Meun. A later literary phenomenon now called the querelle des femmes also devoted much time to reprehending Jean de Meun, specifically for the alleged misogyny of his Rose continuation. The master text which sparks and fuels these fifteenth- century debates, by dint of its attributed 'masterly' status, possesses a certain spectral potency in its haunting of successive generations of writers. This sense of being haunted by the Rose , and, more specifically, by the Rose continuator himself, was explored in different ways by several late-medieval poets: for example, a distressed lady, 'le chief des dames', in Jacques Milet's pro- feminine Forest de tństesse 45 feels afflicted by the Rose to the extent that she</page><page sequence="12">246 Medium JEyvu lxxiii. 2 arraigns Jean de Meun personally as she prays before a statue of the Virgin Mary: A toy, l'acteur qui l'entrepris, Les ditz sont a mon prejudice Dont certes tu sera repris Et puny bien tost par justice. The lady's distress might be read as a diegetic echo of the fiction framing the authorial persona's own endeavour: Milet's troubled awareness of writing inescapably in the tradition of these alleged misogynistic masterpieces as he seeks to contribute to the querelle des femmes in defence of women. Milet concludes his Forest by fulfilling the lady's prediction that Jean de Meun will be brought to justice: he stages the sentencing of the Rose continuator in the court of Dame Justice. By contrast, as we have already seen, it is the positive authority of Jean de Meun as poet and social critic that is sustained, accorded sur-vie , in Bouvet's Appańcion maistre fehan de Meun. Therefore, whether valued positively or negatively, Jean de Meun's ghost looms large in the later Middle Ages in a manner of haunting akin to Derrida's perspective on the authority of master texts: Derrida comments that a 'chef d'oeuvre ... se meut, par définition, à la manière d'un fantôme' (SM, p. 42), by which he means that masterpieces are ghosdy with regard to the anxiety that they promote in their heirs, who perceive their legacy - both prestigious and controversial - to be a troubling but essential burden upon their own (in this case, literary) consciousness. The Champion gave us a positive example of the spectrality effect being used to recuperate Charder's Belle Darne-, the poem engages similarly with negative shadows of Jean de Meun's Rose and 'son vilain langage' (CD, rubric following line 12240). In one particular instance, l'Acteur attempts to rehabilitate the pejorative connotations acquired by the figure of the beguine. In the Rose, Jean de Meun's religious hypocrite, Faux Semblant, satirizes 'béguins as granz chaperons' (RR, lines 11961fr.), and his partner in crime, Abstinence Con- trainte, is portrayed as someone who fraudulently 's'atorne comme beguine' (ibid., line 12050). The textual conditions of the term 'beguine' are refigured in the Champion by l'Acteur's wholly positive description of dame Charité in her role as ťdu temple d'Amours abesse / vestue en abit de béguine' (CD, lines 1 72 3 f.). The significance of this style of dress is thus hermeneutically redressed as attire that signifies an honourable Christian role. The ťchef d'oeuvre' of the Rose thus seems to haunt the memories both of subsequent poets and of the textual transformations and rewritings that these writers produce: it appears 'à hanter, tel un insaisissable spectre, et la mémoire et la traduction' (SM, p. 42) and this act of haunting/haunted interpretative translation that I have been seeking to describe through an amalgam of hermeneutic discourses - rhetorical, 'spectral', and linguistic - may be grounded within the imagery of the literary masterpiece itself. Jean de Meun inserts in the discourse of his Nature personification46 an effective mini-treatise on lenses ('les miroers', RR, line 18176) which decrees laws of optical</page><page sequence="13">The Ghost(S) of the Author(S) 247 transformation ('le livre de regarz', line 18040). These laws may, I believe, be construed metaphorically - on a metapoetic level - to define the mechanisms of hermeneutic translation practised by Jean de Meun, and may also be extrapolated to describe the operations performed by certain other late- medieval inheritors of earlier discourses. That this translation may be conceived of as specifically spectral is supported by Nature's depiction of a lens's capacity to yield numerous virtual images - phantoms - if it is conjured by its observers: Si font fantosmes aparan2 A ceuls qui regardent par anz. (RR, lines 1 8 1 1 5 f.) Such 'fantosmes' might be seen to be represented within the text of the Rose by the several spurious replies, each equally inauthentic, that La Vieille proposes Bel Accuel might offer Jalousie should the latter enquire how Bel Accuel comes to possess a 'chaplet' (RR, line 12732) given to him by his elderly mentor: 'Et s'ele m'enquiert dont ce vint?' 'Responses avroiz plus de .xx.' (RR, lines 127 15 f.) These phantoms may themselves be translated onto a literary reflexive level of interpretation. La Vieille's speculated 'responses' proliferate variously in the same way that mirrors . . . font diverses ymages Aparoir en divers estages Par composicions diverses. (RR, lines 18 177i., 181 80) The infinite possibility of variation is highlighted by the speaker's rhetorical device of frequentati. A similar law of proliferation and variation can be seen to operate in the broader context of the late-medieval Rose querelle and querelle des femmes: we have seen how the poetic responses generated by a polemical ťchef d'oeuvre' (and especially one which is itself a 'mirouer') vary in their degree of agreement or dispute with the authority that they creatively translate. Having established the validity of my chosen literary approach to the works of Jean de Meun and Martin Le Franc, I shall now consider the slippery activity of the author-function that can be elucidated more clearly by considering the texts in spectral and polyphonous terms, before turning to address the aspects of textual reception, transmission, and 'performance' that are also consciously presented within my chosen texts. I should like to use as a starting point a distinction of authorship that is made by Roland Barthes in his essay 'The death of the author'. With unequivocal certainty he pronounces the difference between conventional, author-centred and 'new', scriptor-centred or what I shall call 'author-evacuated' composition. He associates a radical shift in temporality with this change: The removal of the author utterly transforms the modern text ... The temporality is different. The author is conceived of as the past of his own book:</page><page sequence="14">248 Medium Mvum lxxiilz book and author stand automatically on a single line divided into a before and an after. The author is thought to nouńsh the book ... in the same relation of antecedence to his work as a father to his child. In complete contrast the modern scriptor is born simultaneously with the text ... is not the subject with the book as predicate; there is no other time than that of the enunciation and every text is eternally written here and now.47 I should like to propose that Barthes provides a theoretical model of authorship that we may fruitfully deconstruct in terms of my notion of spectral poetic voices, in order to explain the complex textual activity of certain late- medieval author- functions. In the Complainte and the Rose, the voices of l'Acteur and Jean de Meun appear to straddle the divide between author-centred and author-evacuated conceptions of the writer-book relationship: they impose themselves as controlling, creative presences as well as interacting ambiguously and elusively with other textual voices, namely Livre and Guillaume de Lorris. The poems' author- functions thereby compromise the 'complete contrast' of mutual exclusivity that Barthes presupposes. In the Complainte , it is initially Barthes 's traditional paternal/filial relationship of antecedence between writer and book that l'Acteur evokes as he depicts himself physically embracing his wayward child upon the latter's return: A mon livre se complaignant Incontinent la main tendy Et si lui dis, en l'estraignant Entre mes bras: 'Ha! mon filz tendre' (C, lines 5 8f., 6if.) L'Acteur thus expresses a strong sense of his work as his own literary property.48 Similarly, it is clear from within the diegesis that Livre's self- presentation before Philippe le Bon was judged according to an author-centred rather than author-evacuated view of composition: the book alleges that the extratextual, historical dimension of his author's biography was responsible for his unfavourable reception amongst the duke's courtiers. Livre arraigns l'Acteur: 'Tu m'as fait perdre et gaster' (C, line 196), and enlists as the explanation for this negative response l'Acteur's controversial political and theological status as a 'basilien' (line 230), supporter of ecclesiastical reform at the Council of Basel, opened in 143 1: 'Tu as esté a Basle' (line 229). On the one hand, the dynamic of blame displacement between the two speakers serves to underline their separability and the autonomy of their voices; on the other, their precise relationship remains ambiguous with constant slippage in their terms of address between 'je/tu/nous'. Livre fulminates against what he perceives as the valueless artistic occupation of his author (which is surely ironic as he thereby undermines his own existence as a created subject): Ha! Homme, que fais tu? ... Ton labour ne vault ung festu. (C9 lines 33, 35) Livre reinforces his separability from the voice of l'Acteur with the rhetorical</page><page sequence="15">The Ghost(S) of the Author(S) 249 emphasis of frequentatio on the second-person pronoun and possessive adjective. Within the same stanza, however, he retracts to acknowledge the indis- sociability of the two parties: 'Regarde en quel estât nous sommes' (line 40). For his part, l'Acteur concedes that it is the perceived sins of the father that are being visited upon his child: En despit de moy. je n'en doubte On te regarde de travers. (C, lines 333 f.) The time-line of authorship proposed by Barthes also appears to be at issue in the Complainte. The 'single line divided into a before and an afteť at first seems straightforward, but is nuanced by the psychology of the author-book relationship: Livre's return in accusatory mode through the medium of a dream-vision suggests how, in psychological terms, his 'death' - his past, failed performance - weighs on the mind of his still living author with a rhetorically signifying force. Commenting on Marx's Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte , Derrida voices a similar idea: Peser ('lasten') c'est aussi charger, taxer, imposer, endetter, accuser, assigner, enjoindre ... le vivant doit . . . répondre du mort, répondre au mort. Correspondre et s'expliquer ... avec la hantise. ( SM , p. 177) L'Acteur's 'having it out with' ('s'expliquer avec') his book's ghost in their dialogue entails his decision whether to heed the injunction to revise his work that is delivered from the court by Livre; the spectre speculates what the courtiers might have whispered into the duke's ear: Et si le commandez rescripre A Martin pour pluseurs raisons. (C, lines 143 f.) 'Martin', the poet's projected authorial persona, rejects this order, and this act of refusal highlights how, in the Complainte , the dramatic autonomization of the voices of l'Acteur and Livre functions to disrupt the single temporal line of authorship that Barthes divides into 'a before and an after' on which author and text are supposed to stand in 'traditional' literature. Indeed, the very act of the book's return fractures any clear temporal division. L'Acteur concludes his speculations as to the possible welcomes his Livre could have received before the Burgundian court (C, stanza xiv) with the rhetorical expression of nescience: 'Que sai ge?' (ibid., line 1 1 1), apparendy expressing thereby an author's lack of control over, and ignorance of, his work's experience once departed from his creativity. However, the book's return marks a new present time of utterance out of which, through the performative interaction of Acteur and Livre in a new creative moment, a further text is born, namely the Complainte itself. This doubling of texts is reflected in the ambiguation of a Barthes-like single time-line of authorship. This ambiguity is indicated by certain hermeneutic complexities caused by deictic temporal markers ('cestui') in the poem's opening stanzas. The narrator first addresses his audience in the here-and-now deictic present of narration to affirm, through anteoccupatio , the validity of oneiric revelation. He begins:</page><page sequence="16">2 5 o Medium JEvvm lxxiii.2 Se ce vous semble une faffee, Se cestui propos refusez ... (C, lines 9i.) It is immediately ambiguous as to whether he is referring to the risk of rejection of the 'propos' delivered by his Livre in the dream l'Acteur will relate, or of those pertaining to the poet's current venture, namely his narration and framing of that dream which is referred to a little later in the same terms: 'cestui compte' (line 15). The complicated plurality of voices provoked by the book's return and the temporal interrelation of these voices may be explained more precisely in spectral terms. The complex, multiple relationships between past and present, writer and text, may usefully be signified by the communication Derrida proposes between spectre (the ghost) and esprit (understood as the human spirit which generates the ghost) if we take Livre and l'Acteur to correspond to the two entities respectively: Le spectre est de l'esprit, il en participe, il en relève alors même qu'il le suit comme son double fantômal. (SM, p. 201) Derrida here identifies a dual, simultaneously past and present connection between the two entities: the one both 'stemming from' and 'participating in' the other. This mixed temporal relationship, when applied to the speaking subjects of Martin Le Franc's poem, illuminates how Livre speaks in a spectral version of the current Complainte1 s poet's voice, a voice which itself bears the residue of his past composition (Le Champion des dames). This residual echo of previous discourse is highlighted by l'Acteur's aforementioned citation of the Champion's incipit when he criticizes Livre's performance - a citation which indicates the ineluctable cycle of /^haunting that l'Acteur experiences in his creative writing and whose effect Derrida formulates succinctly, 'Je suis hanté par moi-même qui suis (hanté par moi-même qui suis ... etc.)' (SM, p. 212): hence the slipperiness of relations between the Complainte 's interlocutors. Le Franc problematizes the projection of the past work onto Livre by allowing the book's discourse (the line from the Champion des dames) to permeate the current speech of l'Acteur - a permeation (or 'self-haunting') that is hardly surprising given that l'Acteur was, and still is, the author of the Champion. The spatio-temporal disturbance that ensues from the Complainte 's constant shifting between Barthes's author-centred and author-evacuated concepts of composition is equally evident in the Rose and is similarly assimilable to ideas of spectrality in a way which foregrounds authorial, literary reflexive issues. The single before/after time-line of authorship is complicated by a crucial passage at the poem's mid-point which describes the Rosé* s authorship: Car quant Guillaumes cessera Jehans le continuera Après sa mort ... (RR, lines 105 9 1-3) Jean de Meun, the presumed author of this section, presents himself as a third person acting as the continuator in the future of Guillaume's text. Both the death and rebirth of 'the author' as a plural, two-part voice are being foretold</page><page sequence="17">The Ghost(S) of the Author(S) 251 here by a separate, seemingly disembodied speaker. If Jehans is still to come then what is the status of this utterance? Whose is this ventriloquized voice, attributed to the god of love, that is apparently speaking here and now, prophesying a death that has already occurred (Guillaume's), and being born within the text before Jean's own birth? The composite speaking subject at the mid-point of the Rose thus emerges, at least grammatically, as a peculiarly spectral figure: a disjunctive presence that disrupts temporality, being, in Derrida's terms, 'there' in a way that inhabits both the past and the future (SM, pp. 69, 279). We may support this 'spectropoetic' conception of the author- function by a similar instance of multi-temporality that occurs in Jean de Meun's subsequent address to the text's audience of amorous lords: Et savrez lors par eel escrit Quanque j'avré devant escrit Et quanque je bee a escrire. (RR, lines 1 5 1 5 5-7) This address affirms how the spectral slipperiness of the author-function, able to slide between past ('quanque j'avré devant escrit'), present (the moment of utterance), and future ('quanque je bee a escrire' and the further, hypothesized future of reception by 'vous'), is grounded in the constitutive double-voicing of a given speaker's discourse, whether this double-voicing is due to an author acting as continuator to his predecessor (Jean de Meun), or to an author being confronted by his own past work (Martin Le Franc). Jean de Meun's attitude to his audience may be seen to indicate the ludic nature of late-medieval writers' reflection on their own creative activity. This aesthetic playfulness may be brought out through our enlistment of a second, complementary Derridean discourse: we may interweave with his concept of ghosts and temporal disturbance the notion of 'play' and spatial disruption that he describes in his 1966 essay 'Structure, sign and play'.49 The 'play' on which Derrida concentrates here is play in a technical rather than a ludic sense, in that 'the centre of a structure permits the play of its elements inside the total form'.50 However, Derrida's focus on the sense of a complicating yet controlled freedom of movement only renders his theory of 'jeu' more pertinent to the complex negotiations of narratorial space in which Jean de Meun and Martin Le Franc engage. 'Play is the disruption of presence,'51 and both poets' personae may be seen to be playing with their spectral textual identities in the ambiguous inscriptions of authorial presence that have been highlighted above. Derrida adds: Play is always play of absence and presence but if it is to be thought radically, play must be conceived of before the alternative of presence and absence.52 The theoretical complexity of 'play' seems to be the implicit principle subtending the play of absence and presence that is depicted by the god of love in the central passage of the Rose : he represents neither author - neither the 'already gone' Guillaume nor the 'just around the corner' Jean - as being capable of composition at the current time:</page><page sequence="18">252 Medium JEvvm lxxiii.i Mais par cestui [=Guillaumes] ne puet ore estre, Ne par cestui qui est a nestre, Car il n'est mie ci presanz. (RR, lines 1061 i-i 3) The reader is thus located temporally in a deictic lacuna that is represented visually in the Pierpont Morgan miniature noted previously. Jean de Meun's audience is invited to accept a radical authorial indeterminacy and the independence of the god of love's voice from any authorial discourse: it is this personified abstraction which has metaleptically become the implied author of the text.53 This question of the autonomy of each speaking subject is central to Mikhail Bakhtin's 'problem of polyphony' in that it promotes 'not an absence of, but a radical change in, the author's position' (PDP, p. 67) such as the radical position just implied by the god of love's discourse in the Rose. The multiplication of voices inherent in the late-medieval development of personification allegory means that characters become 'not only objects of authorial discourse but also subjects of their own direcdy signifying discourse' (ibid., p. 7). Each subject comes to stand, to varying degrees, alongside rather than subordinate to the author's word. This illusion of equal authority allows the god of love to appear to exercise authorial authority independent of either Rose author. The god predicts the success of Jean de Meun's Amant in plucking the eponymous rose and foretells how the Rose continuator will record the Lover's dialogues with different personified characters: Et dira . . . . . . toutes les autres paroles Queles qu'eles soient, sages ou foies, Jusqu'à tant qu'/V avra cueillie La tres belle rose vermeille, Et qu'il soit jours et qu'/V s'esveille. (RR, lines 10595, 10601-3, ioóojf.) In this passage, a further polyphony is suggested through the ambiguous referent of the third-person pronoun: il ('he') may be seen to haunt the text as a floating signifier corresponding to multiple signifieds, potentially designating as one polyphonous 'communauté hantée d'un seul corps' (SM, p. 212) the future author Jean de Meun, the dreamed-of lover, and the dreaming narrator inherited from Guillaume. As the Rose both makes explicit and renders frustratingly elusive its author- function, so the Complainte complicates the relationship, discussed above, between l'Acteur and Livre but also offers an insight into the authorial intention of 'Martin', its acteur-persona. Le Franc exploits the dialogue form of the Complainte to provoke l'Acteur into delivering an effective manifesto of the ideology underpinning his poetic creativity. Thus l'Acteur has the opportunity vehemently to reject the counsel offered by his failed book, who advises conformity to established codes of poetic decorum accepted by the court:</page><page sequence="19">The Ghost(S) of the Author(S) 253 Se tu veulx la grace sentir Des seigneurs, tu doibs a loisir Mos apechier et assortir Tout au plus prez de leur plaisir. (C, lines 217-20) L'Acteur rejoins: Or saches, fieulx, que ma science N'est pour oreilles affoler: Je n'en eulx onq experience; Ains est pour langues affiler. (C, lines 245-8) It is worth pausing to examine this statement of intention as it seems to betray detailed reflection on the authorial issues of a text's envisaged reception and transmission. The poet's aim is resolutely not to ťplaire a chacun' (line 257); on the contrary, he strives to be ¿/¿ragreeable and incite debate, with this stance being itself double-voiced, carrying as it does the cultural baggage of a didactic tradition of administering the bitter pill of necessary instruction. The shift from 'oreilles' (C, line 246) to 'langues' (line 248) may be construed to translate the desire that his text be actively rather than passively received and that it promote through its performance what Bakhtin calls a dynamic of ťthe living word' that 'wants to be heard and answered'.54 The worst fate for Le Franc's book is, therefore, that which it has in fact suffered: 'Or m'a l'en imposé silence' (C, line 205). Silence is the only state in which Livre may experience what Bakhtin calls the 'absolute death' of 'the living word': 'It is the state of being unheard, unrecognised, unremembered.'55 The book's afterlife - its life beyond its author's death - depends on its being maintained in the converse of a living audience, otherwise Livre itself will be unable to 'speak'. Livre is not only an aurally perceived ghosdy voice in the Complainte : like the visually present voice of Jean de Meun in the Appańcion discussed previously, the book's ghost is embodied. Livre's abandoned state is rep- resented in terms of his material existence as written artefact, bound in book form and left to decay; he reports: Tant a l'en fait qu'il m'a falu Demourer seulet en la mue De mousse et de poudre velu Ainsy se j'ay la colle esmue Raison y a jusques ad ce. (C, lines 145-7, x49f-) Accordingly, when the narrator-persona first sees his revenant book that has been castigated and threatened with burning because of its polemical content,56 it is dismembered before his very eyes in equally concrete terms: . . . mon dit livre survint Crepy en feulletz plus de vingt, De griefs et de couteaux navré Et en ma presence devint De tous ses membres dessevreé. (C, lines 28-32)</page><page sequence="20">254 Medium íEvum lxxiii.2 This foregrounding of the pity that the book should be abused and allowed to fall into decay might be explained as a further and especially complex instance of double-voicing: the wounded, dismembered book recalls the portrayal of Dame France in Le Franc's own Champion (lines 3 1 1 3-360), a portrait which is itself inherited from the personified France of Alain Chartier's Quadrilogue invectif (1422). 57 Such effects of transtextual and intertextual ghosting hermen- eutically enrich the Complainte 's image in several ways, not least by using the echo of Chartier's well-known treatise to point up the political dimension of his maligned Champion as an exhortation to reform the common weal, namely the ecclesiastical unity of a schismatically divided France. A multifaceted image of the book Le Champion des dames is therefore composed by the Complainte. Livre adds a touch of anthropomorphism to his self-portrait: 'J'ai le viz pale' (C, line 228); elsewhere, it is the book's identity as a speaking subject that is emphasized such that, when referred to in the context of his performance, before Philippe's court, of the text written on his pages, Livre demonstrates the performative fusion of written and oral modes that Sylvia Huot identifies as a self-conscious act from the fourteenth century: she concludes that 'the written text is an artefact that embodies a performance'.58 L'Acteur's accusations of his work's deficiencies focus upon the implied prior event of Livre's performance at court and upon its rhetorical delivery: actio as opposed to authorial inventio. He hypothesizes the book's histrionic delivery of the poem's opening line: Tu as cuidié du premier sault Que l'en criast a la trompette 'A l'assault, dames, a l'assault!' Ha! Mors ta langue et ta lippette. (C, lines 177-80) We may speculate as to Le Franc's reasons for inserting this criticism: is it a form of stylistic self-criticism through a mediating voice, or a genuine concern for the possible misinterpretation of the tonality of his work on the part of its speakers/readers? Might we conjecture the poet's authorial strategy here to be to flag or publicize his Champion retrospectively so as to encourage further dissemination? Elsewhere, l'Acteur upbraids Livre for having overleaped his ambition in his chosen style of performance: Comme pou endoctriné Tu as volu trop hault parler. (C, lines 165 f.) This rhetorical criticism indicates that disjuncture has occurred between 'form' and 'content' in the book's composition: l'Acteur plays on the medieval doctrine of propriety in the co-ordination of 'matter' and 'manner' when he intimates that Livre's deportment should conform to the courage and endeavour manifested within the poem it contains by the Champiorì s epony- mous protagonist; the book should align his behaviour with that of its fictional hero, Franc Vouloir:</page><page sequence="21">The Ghost(S) of the Author(S) 25 5 Mais toy, qui hautement te clames Et par tout te faiz appeller Le loial Champion des Dames , Comment oses tu reculer? (C, lines 425-8) This diegetic promotion of the debate concerning poetic propriety serves to indicate how Martin Le Franc consciously uses his text to interrogate his craft. Douglas Kelly has remarked how, in the later Middle Ages, 'literary works became virtual arts of poetry in their own right',59 and I should like to conclude by proposing that the spectral, polyphonic, temporal, and spatial play exhibited by the Rose and the Complainte justify readings of the two works in Kelly's terms, as Virtual arts of poetry' which are particularly concerned with issues of authorship, continuation, reception, and textual transmission. In this article, I have sought to analyse ways in which modern critical theories of 'ghosting' pertaining to the text as a site of dialogic interaction between past and present voices may fruitfully be applied to two late-medieval works in order to articulate the complex author- function active in these texts. The authorial voice's relationship to other discourses is experienced through textual haunting, whether in direct dialogue with the ghost of one's own composition (as in the Complainte) , or in implicit dialogic interaction with another's word as continuator of that inherited discourse (as in the Rose). Derrida's theory of spectrality and Bakhtin's dialogism and polyphony have enabled us to highlight the dynamic nature of this engagement with past discourses, an engagement which stems from the present, 'inheriting' writer's need to s'expliquer avec his predecessor (s). This textual revenance is manifested in the citation and transmutation of an earlier text or texts, as practised by Jean de Meun in his portion of the Rose , by Franc Vouloir in the Champion as he rewrites both the Rose and Machaut, and by the book of the Champion returning in the Complainte. A critical deconstruction of Barthes's clear-cut distinction between author- centred and author-evacuated conceptions of authorship has reinforced my argument that the late-medieval actorial je should be seen as a complex 'function of discourse'.60 On the one hand, this speaking subject draws attention to the creative, productive role of the author by engaging in diegetic reflection upon issues of responsibility, intention, transmission, and the materiality of the work he produces. On the other, as a slippery subject existing polyphonically alongside other textual voices, this figure is susceptible to analysis in Bakhtinian and Derridean terms, which help elucidate the intricate 'play' of the actorial je in the Rose, Champion , and Complainte , and suggest exciting new avenues of enquiry for analysing the activity of authorship in other late-medieval French texts.

English translations in this paper are my own. 25 Although Livre is ventriloquized and animated by Le Franc in the same way as the voice of l'Acteur, I refer throughout this paper to the book as 'it' and to its author as 'he' for purposes of clarity. 26 This succession was not immediate and its dates are only calculable from intratextual evidence: we deduce from Jean de Meun's comments that his predecessor commenced composition in about 1230 since he was to take it up 'more than forty years' (lines 10590fr.) after the death of Guillaume de Lorris. In the introduction to his edition, Strubel concludes that the continuation dates from between 1269 and 1278 (p. 7). Berthelot offers an interesting and detailed commentary on the succession of authorship, Figures et fonction de l'écrivain, pp. 385-404. 27 See Mary Carruthers, The Book of Memory: A Study of Memory in Medieval Culture (Cambridge, 1990), p. 165. 28 Derrida's point of reference here is the opening act of Shakespeare's play, in which the ghost of the dead King Hamlet returns to haunt his son: it begins its presence in the play by coming back from the dead just as CD starts its role in C as Livre by returning from exile and, before that, from Philippe's court. The condition of revenance is both a strength and a weakness: it affords the spectre a certain authority over its host whilst, at the same time, rendering it malleable and rewritable since it is ultimately only accorded its return in this poem by the voice of the author, who conjures up the particular spectre with whom he wishes his persona to negotiate. 29 The adverb 'nouvellement' is most commonly translated as 'recently' (Frédéric Godefroy, Dictionnaire de l'ancienne langue française (Paris, 1881-1902)). Although this meaning would be quite satisfactory for the present context, it is tempting to speculate other semantic possibilities as the lexeme 'nouveau' is a significant and recurrent term</page><page sequence="24">258 Medium jEvum lxxiii.2 in the same author's CDy where several meanings of the term are sometimes played off each other. This complex connection is also evidenced in l'Acteur's conjecturing of the questions that Philippe's courtesans asked when Livre appeared before them: 'Dont est venu cest avolé?' (C, line 107). 31 See Nancy Freeman Regalado, ťThe medieval French construction of the modern reader: Solomon's ship and the birth of Jean de Meun', Yale French Studies , 95 (1999), 81-107 (p* 9*0- Regalado uses the phrase 'translado ad futurum' to describe the ways in which medieval texts project their succession towards the future and knowingly anticipate (and therefore encourage) a particular interpretative response from the hypothesized future reader. The temporal domain she is exploring thus coincides with the idea of a textual sur-vie that is arranged in advance of a text's transmission. 32 Jean de Meun's use of 'acteur' to denote his first-person speaker implies his wish to exploit the late-medieval term's ambiguity (see above, n. 3), especially since his narrating Acteur is distinct from the third-person lover-protagonist of the diegesis, l'Amant, who was, by contrast, in Guillaume de Lorris's portion of the poem, one and the same voice as Guillaume's Acteur. 33 Christine de Pizan, Le Livre des fai^ d'armes et de chevalerìe (¿'1409), Paris, Bibliothèque Nationale de France, MS f. fr. 603, fol. 291. Contrary to Cynthia J. Brown's belief that 'plagiarism, or the unlawful appropriation of another's words and ideas, could not have existed in medieval times' {Poets, Patrons, and Printers , p. 29), Christine seems here to be questioning precisely whether her citation constitutes such an infraction. 34 See Copeland, 'Rhetoric and vernacular translation', pp. 43 fï*. 35 Ibid, p. 43. 36 In The Dialogic Imagination: Four Essays by M. M. Bakhtin , trans. Caryl Emerson and Michael Holquist, ed. Michael Holquist (Austin, Tex, 1981), p. 59. The original essay was probably written in 1 940. 37 In PDP , Bakhtin goes on to develop an elaborate typology of such 'doubly-oriented' discourse. See Gary Saul Morson and Caryl Emerson, Mikhail Bakhtin: Creation of a Prosaics (Stanford, Calif, 1984), pp. 136-9, for an explanation of Bakhtin's notion of the 'alreadv-spoken-about' word that is 'reaccented' in its different contexts of utterance. 39 Quotation taken from Alain Chartier, La Belle Dame sans mercy , in Alain Chartier, Achille Caulier, and Baudet Herenc, Le Cycle de ' La Belle Dame sans mercy': une anthologie poétique du XV* siècle (BNF MS fr. up), ed. David F. Huit and Joan E. McRae (Paris, 2003), pp. 15-83 (line 689). 40 The Lady is cleared of all allegations of cruelty in her refusal of the suitor because it is shown that she already has a lover, to whom she is true and loyal. See La Dame lealle en amours , in Chartier, Caulier, and Herenc, Le Cycle , pp. 169-243 (lines 393-400). 41 Derrida evokes a similar, necessary plurality of inheritance: 'on n'hérite jamais sans s'expliquer avec du spectre et, dès lors, avec plus d'un spectre' (SM, p. 46). The onus of inheritance as an active operation rests with the heir, since it is his responsibility to perform 'le choix critique appelé par toute reaffirmation de l'héritage' (p. 40) in the process of 'having it out with' ('s'expliquer avec') ghosts. The ghosts here in question are Machaut's poetic voices. 42 Guillaume de Machaut, The Judgement of the King of Bohemia (Le Jugement du Roy de Behaigne), ed. and trans. R. Barton Palmer (New York, 1984). In this debate, witnessed by the narrator, the eponymous king is called upon to determine which of two parties has suffered the greater grief: a woman whose husband has died or a knight whose lady has deserted him for another. Given that the latter must still suffer the anguish of</page><page sequence="25">The Ghost(S) of the Author(S) 259 being able to behold his former beloved before his eyes, the king decides in favour of the knight. 43 Franc Vouloir argues in favour of the widow, since her greater suffering results from being able to summon only virtually the vision of her dead lover through her memory and imagination. 44 See Œuvres de Guillaume de Machaut, ed. E. Hœpffner, 3 vols (Paris 1908-21), I (1908), pp. 137-282. 45 ed. Antoine Vérard, in Le Jardin de plaisance et fleur de rethorique (reproduction en facsimile de l'édition publiée vers 1501), ed.

Burke, pp. 125-30 (p. 127). Underlined emphases are my own. 48 This sense of property renders Barthes's concepts and the previously discussed 'author- function' - ideas generated by readings of the modern novel - applicable to my medieval texts. The proprietorial relationship adumbrated here by Le Franc, and present also in Jean de Meun's assertion of his equivalent status with classical auctores , is noteworthy in the context of late-medieval literary production; as Cynthia J. Brown has explored in detail, such ideas of property are only fully developed with the advent of printing: Poets, Patrons, and Printers , pp. 17-59. For the idea of the 'author- function' in manuscript culture, see also Adrian Armstrong, 'Paratexte et autorité(s) chez les Grands Rhétoriaueurs'.

Le Franc's aim thus appears quite contrary to that attributed to Jean de Meun's persona, who wishes to ensure that no further debate may be generated once the continuator has finished 'interpreting' the text: 'Puis voudra la chose espondre / Que riens ne s'i porra respondre' ( RR , lines 1 0607 f.). 55 PDP , p. 287. 56 'Faictes cestui brûler ou frire / Car il porte au ventre poisons' (C, lines 141 f.).
