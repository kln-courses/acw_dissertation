United States Air Force IN explosive ing the in continuing the experiment atmosphere, program called another of non-nuclear Operation large-scale field Prairie high- test- ing in the atmosphere, another large-scale high- explosive experiment called Operation Prairie Flat has been completed.1 During 1966 and 1967, a series of nine non-nuclear events were conducted, ranging in yields from 20 to 100 tons of TNT. Whereas the primary purpose of the series, called Operation Distant Plain,2 was to obtain basic information on air-blast phenomena, di- rect and air-induced ground shock for a variety of high-explosive types, charge configurations, and burst positions, the objective of Operation Prairie Flat was to determine the loading and response of military targets and civilian structures to the simulated blast wave of a 1-kiloton nuclear surface burst and its as- sociated ground shock. The design of the charge was based upon the re- sults of two events in the Operation Distant Plain test series. Specifically, the charge selected was a 500- ton TNT sphere, tangent to, and resting on the ground surface (Figure 1). This spherical charge produces a crater whose aspect ratio (relation of di- ameter to depth) approximates that of a 1-kiloton nuclear surface burst and also produces less crater ejecta (which would interfere with target response studies) than that resulting from either half -buried spheres or tangent hemispheres. At the same time, the 1 By the Defense Atomic Support Agency (DASA) at the Canadian Defence Research Establishment Suffi eld (DRES) at Ralston, Alberta, Canada, under the auspices of The Technical Co-operation Program (TTCP) in which the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia jointly participate. 2 See "Operation distant dlain," by the authors LM.jü. Jan.-Jí'eb. 19681. Figure I. Prairie Flat 500-ton Charge required simulation of a 1-kiloton nuclear air-blast wave is maintained. The TNT spherical charge was 26.92 feet in di- ameter and consisted of 31,676 blocks of TNT, each weighing 32.6 pounds, supported by precut styrofoam blocks. Four programs consisting of 40 projects were con- ducted in the United States sector of the test site : Program 1, Air-blast phenomena and above-ground target response. Program 3, Ground-shock phenomena and subsur- face target response. Program 4, Biomedical data. Program 9, Technical photography and support. PROGRAM 1, AIR BLAST This program included the measurement of various air-blast parameters with standard and newly devel- oped gauges as well as the structural response of above-ground structures and military equipment. Two air-blast lines were installed to measure the free field environment on the surface and at selected elevated stations with overpressure and dynamic pressure gauges. Further data were provided by the Canadian time-of-arrival measurements and high-speed photog- raphy. Prior to the test, hydrodynamic calculations were made that gave theoretical results which were verified later by the actual measurements. Military equipment exposed to the air-blast wave included such items as model missiles (Figure 2), shipboard antennas and various sized radomes, hardened ultra- high frequency (UHF) communication antennas (Figure 3), hardened blast valves, the Chaparral mis- sile system (Figure 4), and an M-60 tank. The target response experiment afforded studies of the effects of the detonation on a residential structure (Figure 5) and the fragmentation of model and full-size build- ings. PROGRAM 3, UNDERGROUND This program included basic measurements of crater size, ground shock, ejecta, and underground struc- tural response. While the apparent crater was meas- ured by photography and surveying after the event, the dimensions of the true crater were determined by colored sand columns and excavation as in previous tests. Air-induced and direct ground shocks at vari- ous depths were measured between the 2,000 and 10 psi levels. Over 258 gauge measurements were later correlated with theoretical computer predictions. Spe- cial gauges in the hydrodynamic and plastic regions also measured the close-in environment. The targets tested for their structural response to a traveling blast wave were flexible utility connections, blast valves, instrumented steel vertical capsules, an Army model buried field shelter, foxholes and foxhole covers, underground electrical generating equipment, buried glass reinforced plastic manholes, and model under- ground missile silos. These targets were highly in- strumented to obtain measurements of transient ac- celeration, deflection, earth pressure and strain, and, in some instances, internal air pressures. PROGRAM 4, BIOMEDICAL Large biological specimens (sheep)3 were exposed to the blast wave while occupying two-man foxholes. 3 The principles of laboratory animal care as established by the National Society for Medical Research were strictly observed. 16 The Military Engineer, January-February, 1971</page><page sequence="2">Figure 2.

Luminous Jets of the Blast Wave This program was to obtain data for accurately pre- dicting the air-blast effects on man and to aid in de- veloping protective measures. Anthropomorphic dum- mies in slit trenches and prone on the surface were exposed to the blast wave at overpressure levels of 30 to 5 psi and the results were recorded by high-speed photography. PROGRAM 9, TECHNICAL SUPPORT This part of the testing consisted of documentary and technical photography. High-speed cameras with framing rates of approximately 1,000,000 to 128 frames per second were used to record the early shock wave formation and fireball growth. Aerial photo- graphs were taken before and after the detonation to determine if any asymmetries were present in the shock front as well as other perturbations which can arise from a high-explosive detonation. TEST RESULTS The 1,000,000-pound spherical charge of TNT was successfully detonated on August 9, 1968 (Figure 6). The apparent crater diameter was 200 feet and the depth 16 feet (Figure 7). It was broad with an uplift in the center and concentric ridges on the crater floor that resembled a nuclear crater of this yield. Several anomalies in the blast wave were captured by the photography. Luminous jets and nonluminous dust jets were observed to outrun the main shock wave. These luminous jets (Figure 8) had a bow shock wave that interacted with the main shock wave. In a few instances this phenomenon interacted with above- ground targets and thereby reduced the value of their data as compared to a clean shock wave. No under- ground projects were affected by this outrunning shock wave. These jets are being investigated to deter- mine their cause and to devise means for eliminating them in future tests. The air-blast instruments func- tioned properly and recorded the clean blast-wave environment as well as that associated with the anom- alies. The model missiles were somewhat affected by the luminous jets in that lower pressures were re- corded than those predicted. In the shipboard an- tennas and radomes projects, the required informa- tion was successfully obtained. A frame building ex- posed at the 15-psi level in the fragmentation project was destroyed as predicted (Figure 9). The frame dwelling exposed at approximately the 1-psi level re- ceived greater damage than expected. Complete anal- ysis is presently being conducted. The louvered blast valve functioned properly in all aspects under actual blast conditions. All of the underground projects, in- cluding the basic underground measurements and the instrumentation of the buried structures and the bio- medical projects, recorded excellent data. The high- speed cameras functioned properly in photographing fireball growth, shock wave expansion, and target re- sponse. Operation Prairie Flat was a successful test with most of the projects achieving their stated objectives. The results comprise an enormous quantity of scien- tific data. The experimental results will be correlated with other high-explosive and nuclear information to extend and improve the knowledge of the effects of nuclear weapons on military weapons systems and civilian structures.
