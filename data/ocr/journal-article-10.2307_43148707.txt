As we grow older, these early childhood lessons in animal behavior are reinforced by the bad biol- ogy so common in popular literature and films, such as the Disney animal extravaganzas. By our teens, we have been exposed for so long to a world of humanized animals, talking automo- biles, singing pills, "bad" wolves, and "gentle" bears that we are conditioned and take little critical notice of the myriad gross distortions of the natural world that bombard us through the Roy A.

The problem is compound- ed when teachers inadvertently rein- force and perpetuate mass media myths about animal behavior. Of course, one can argue that ev- eryone knows automobiles don't talk (at least Detroit hasn't produced one yet!), bears seldom eat porridge, and cuddly animals don't wear clothes, at least outside the nursery. As adults, we are better able to detect fantasy and selectively dismiss it as a real ingredient of an animal's behavior repertoire. The difficulty comes when a deliber- ate or inadvertent distortion of animal behavior comes so close to reality that untrained observers cannot distinguish fact from fiction. If that were not so, there would be fewer tourists in our national parks mauled by the "friendly" bears, despite park rangers' warnings that the bears are wild. There also would be fewer young people's animal books that are mines of misinforma- tion, too often dismissed as harmless &gt; v LjW because they are intended as "enter- tainment" rather than education. There is, of course, no such sharp boundary separating the two. An imaginative teacher can use such books construc- tively to alert students to the pitfalls of personification. Personification is the act of attribut- ing life to nonliving things. In a tighter context, it is the act of attributing hu- man emotions to nonhuman animals. There are three major types of per- sonification. Animism is personification in the broad sense. Despite its potential en- ergy, a precariously balanced boulder cannot "want" to tumble over a cliff's edge any more than the air in a tire can "try" to get out, or the moon can "try" to escape Earth's gravitation. Such whimsies represent an easy way out of difficult explanations of physical forc- es-the air pressure in a tire, for exam- ple, or the acceleration of gravity in the moon-Earth system. Pitfalls 16 October 1981 Science and Children</page><page sequence="2">Anthropomorphism , the attribution of human characteristics to nonhuman or- ganisms, is especially germane in the science classroom. In the film Bambi, a ; story about a family of deer, the viewer is encouraged to condemn Bambi's fa- ther because he "deserts" Bambi's i&gt; mother. "Desertion" connotes the vio- lation of a social value held by humans only. Can any predator other than man ^ be "evil?" Is a kitty cat any more "ruth- less" in killing a sparrow than in killing a rat? Attributing human emotions to nonhumans is a sure way of misunder- * standing why an animal behaves the way it does. Contrary to many chil- dren's books, birds do not sing on clear spring mornings because they are hap- py. Bird song serves quite different functions. It is the male's way of mark- y ing and defending a territory, a means of identifying conspecifics, or, in some cases, of identifying familiar individual birds. Warn, intrude, anger, desire, loyalty , and other such words describe human ac- tions and emotions. Sometimes we are * tempted to use them indiscriminately when we see an animal behaving in such a way that we are involved emo- - tionally. When a dog growls and lays back its ears, we say the animal is "angry." Is it? Can a dog feel anger as we do? The animal is displaying aggres- sive behavior, but anger is something * else. The central problem - and this ap- plies particularly to anthropomorphism - * is semantic. Animal cries, growls, grunts, and whimpers mean something to other animals, and sometimes to us, but a growl is only a sign, not a word. A wolf's growl lacks the precision and richness of the word growl, although as a graded signal, the sound has a range of meanings to a wolf. By our stan- dards, animal communication is severe- ly limited; what is important for the animal is that it is able to communicate well enough to survive - to defend it- self, court mates, and care for its young. Teleology leads to as much misunder- standing as anthropomorphism does. It means attributing purpose to an ani- mal's act. By doing so, we give the im- pression that animals think through the threats to their survival and arrive at rational solutions. Not so. Here is the sort of teleological state- ment that pervades textbooks and chil- dren's trade books: "Certain animals migrate in winter to avoid the harsh conditions." The author implies that each animal of the species in question works it all out and decides it had better find a warmer spot for the winter. Ani- mals do not migrate in order to survive any more than they mate in order to pro- duce young. They migrate because their internal environment responds to external stimuli ("photoperiod," for ex- ample). They migrate with the result that they avoid harsh seasonal conditions and, therefore, survive. Similarly, animals do not court and mate because they "want" offspring, but because of genetic pressure. They respond to internal and external envi- ronmental stimuli, as their ancestors have for generations. There can be no such thing as family planning among cockroaches. Hibernation is an adaptation that enables certain species to survive tem- porarily harsh conditions. Animals do not decide to grow thick winter coats or change the color of their fur. To pre- sume that a rabbit willfully grows a winter coat of white is to presume that animals assess each change in the envi- ronment, then select the best response. Animals simply reflect evolutionary adaptations. If we label certain animals "good" and others "bad," we can never understand food webs or, on a grander scale, the marvelously complex interac- tions between animals and their en- vironment. Young science students must try to see the natural world from the view of the nonhuman animal. Until they are made aware of the pitfalls of personifi- cation, they stand little chance of under- standing why a bird, an ant, or a dog behaves the way it does. Bibliography 1. Hughes, Austin.
