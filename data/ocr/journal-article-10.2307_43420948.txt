<plain_text><page sequence="1">PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY. By L. H. Dudley Buxton, M.A., D.Sc., Exeter College, Oxford. It would not be fitting to let an account of the progress in anthro- pology pass without paying a tribute to the work done by Professor Arthur Thomson, who retired this summer from the Chair of Anatomy in Oxford.1 Professor Thomson has contributed to anthropological studies in this country not only by his published works but also by his long series of lectures in the subject which 1 Since the above was written we regret to have to record that Professor Thomson has died at Oxford.</page><page sequence="2">716 SCIENCE PROGRESS have been delivered annually since 1895. His successor, Professor Le Gros Clark, is also an anthropologist as well as an anatomist, and in the January number of Man he contributes an important statement on his views on " Man's Place among the Primates." He believes that the lemurs and their allies branched off from the basal Primates at an extremely early stage, probably the very beginning of the Tertiary Period. A second branch from the basal Primate stem was that of Tarsius, who possessed features which approached the higher Primates but like the lemurs showed specialised tendencies. Soon after the branching off of Tarsius the monkeys separated from the group which was eventually to produce the apes and man. There are to-day two separate branches of monkeys, old world and new world, but in this case there has evidently been parallel evolution. In regard to the apes the Professor says : " A searching analysis of human morphology leads to the inevitable conclusion that in the structure of the brain, skull and other features the human stem must have passed through a phase of evolution in which it so closely resembled the known anthropoid apes that it is necessary to postulate an anthropomorph ancestor for modern man." The difficulties in the way of deciding at which stage the human stem branched off are discussed at length. He suggests that the human stem diverged from the anthropoids when the common ancestor was a comparatively small animal. A point which needs special attention is whether this divergence did not take place at a level corresponding to that of the gibbons, rather than a later stage represented by the gorilla and the chimpanzee. This is especially necessary because the two fossil specimens, the Java Ape-Man Pithecanthropus and the Peking Man Sinanthropus, resemble the gibbons in certain respects and indeed have been classified as gibbons by some writers, although it is doubtful whether they really bear any close relation to the evolutionary development of Man as we understand him. The Professor suggests that we shall find the direct ancestors of Man among the Miocene forms of Dryopithecus. Unfortunately these animals are at present only known to us from remains of jaws and teeth, and evidence is badly needed about their general skeletal form. A more specialised paper on the evolution of man is that by Dr. Charles Midlo (Amer. Journ. Phys. Anthrop ., XIX, 3, 1934). He discusses the external appearance of the hand and foot in Primates, a subject whose importance and interest is well known</page><page sequence="3">PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY 717 especially from the writings of Dr. Wood Jones. It is very interest- ing to compare Dr. Midlo's findings with those of Professor Clark given above. Dr. Midlo suggests that the Prosimian (that is Tarsius, lemurs and their allies) hand and foot are markedly special- ised structures, with a greater deviation in their external form from the primitive mammalian form than those of the higher Primates. Both the Old and New World monkeys have rather general- ised hands and feet but various families, especially of the New World monkeys, show varying degrees of specialisation. In the next higher group we find that the gibbons have rather unspecialised feet, but markedly specialised hands, owing no doubt to their arboreal habits. Among the higher apes we get varying degrees of specialisation side by side with the retention of primitive char- acters and it is especially interesting to note that Dr. Midlo con- firms the generally held view that Man has a more primitive hand and a more specialised foot. George H. Hansen {American Anthropologist N.S., 36, No. 3, 1934) describes a skull cap found in Utah Lake. The shore of the lake was formerly a favourite place of habitation of ancient man as is clearly shown by archaeological evidence. Owing to the drought it was possible to explore points normally far out in the lake. This skull cap was found at a position usually quite inac- cessible. Morphologically it contrasts strongly with local Indians and the mound builders of the lake shores. The skull should prove of considerable interest in the study of the distribution of the early populations of America. The Zeitschrift f√ºr Ethnologie , 66, Heft 1/3, 1934, contains an account by Herta Busse on the old Slavonic skulls from Eastern Germany. This extremely careful paper, much of which is devoted to a necessarily technical descrip- tion of the crania, is important as adding a further piece of evidence to our knowledge of the contrast between the culture of the region which was Slavonic and the physical type of the inhabitants which was closer to their more western neighbours speaking Teutonic languages. There are two American papers which investigate subjects to which anthropologists have normally given less attention. First B. B. Gardner and D. L. MacAdam (Amer. Journ . Phys. Anthrop ., XIX, 2) discuss the question of using the technique of physics for testing hair-colour by a colorimetrie analysis. They used Professor Hardy's recording spectrophotometer and attempted to analyse hair samples. As they themselves say, the number of examples used (53) was really too few, but the results obtained do</page><page sequence="4">718 SCIENCE PROGRESS suggest that you could get a scientifically graded hair-colour series which would have the advantage of standardising the work of all observers and also of making the material available, if required, for statistical study. Frederick G. Murray has a paper of exceptional general interest (American Anthropologist N.S. , 36, No. 3). He calls attention to the importance which medical research, especially on rickets, may well have to anthropologists. He postulates two factors, sunlight and such food as fish, oil and meat, and ascribes the whiteness of the White Race as being due to an adaptation which allows as much sunlight as possible to penetrate the body. But the Eskimo, who have black hair and a pigmented skin, should on the same theory also have become white to get sunlight, to which in fact they are even less subjected than the White man. But Mr. Murray draws attention to the fact that their diet - fish, oil and meat - is just as antirachitic as sunlight, and believes that such a diet has not made a specialisation of skin colour necessary. On the other hand, in the tropics there is excessive light and the author suggests that this superabundance of sunlight, combined with a nutritional disease factor, militates against the wellbeing of the white man in the tropics. Comparatively few of the papers read at the International Congress of Ethnology and Anthropology have yet appeared in more than brief summaries. It is impossible therefore to do more than speak very briefly on the subject. It would appear, however, that the main interests of the physical anthropologists were tending towards two Unes at the moment, first the evolution of man (Pro- fessor Le Gros Clark's paper has already been noted) and secondly the systematic classification of racial differences especially in rela- tion to their geographical distribution. On the second subject a fundamental difference of opinion seemed to manifest itself. Some anthropologists preferred to take their racial or cranial series as a whole and to study them in relation to their neighbours and to other similar groups. Other speakers again, notably Professor Czanowski, were equally definite that this was hardly a satisfactory line of approach. They considered that any series should be divided into its component parts and that any particular group should be analysed as containing, say, so much per cent. Nordic, so much Alpine and so much Mediterranean, or whatever the com- ponents may be. The various papers will no doubt be published in due course, but there can be little doubt that the extremely friendly spirit in which these discussions and those on standardisation of anthropometric data were discussed, although they may appear</page><page sequence="5">PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY 719 to be as evanescent as a broadcast programme, will really con- tribute considerably to the progress of physical anthropology which in the past has suffered very much from the difficulty of different schools seeing each other's point of view. The demonstration by Professor Schlauginhaufen and others who were trained in Pro- fessor Martin's school on the actual methods described in Martin's Lehrbuch der Anthropologie may be also mentioned as particularly valuable. Skulls, calipers, and skilful fingers cleared away many difficulties which mere words had only tended to confuse. These things can hardly appear as published transactions, but do in fact contribute more to the progress of the subject than a good many published papers.</page></plain_text>
