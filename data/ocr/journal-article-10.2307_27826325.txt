<plain_text><page sequence="1">COMMUNICATIONS THE SOCIAL BEHAVIOR OF MOLECULES By GEORGE SCATCHARD Massachusetts Institute of Technology Each year the president of the M. I. T. Chapter of the Sigma Xi is given an unusual and valuable opportunity? the opportunity to address the most carefully selected audience in the Insti tute and with no restriction as to his sub ject. My own field is in the area between physics and chemistry. Almost every one of you is working with physics and chem istry, studying these subjects in some special field or applying them to some more or less useful purpose. So I shall not worry about being technical. I shall carry the fantasy of my title through much of my discussion, but shall not, I hope, be too anthropomorphic. Those of you who have studied psychology will remember that the behaviorists are the psychologists who treat men like mole cules. They do not care how men feel, or think, or aspire, but only how they act. I used to say that the difference be tween a chemist and a physicist is that a chemist likes to put molecules to gether and observe how they behave toward each other, whereas the physicist delights in placing a single atom upon the operating table to torture and dis tort it. This was before the days of the Atomic Energy Commission or even the cyclotron, when the physicist could only amputate the limbs of the atom. Now that he can get at its insides he can make the atom really writhe. The chem ist, too, has improved his tools, but the distinction still remains. Most of us think (or at least most of us who think at all think) much more by analogy than we realize. This was first brought home to me about twenty years ago, when I began teaching liquid solutions. Van der Waals thought of liquid solutions as highly compressed gases, Langmuir thought of them as surfaces, Heitler thought of them as cubic crystals. I had the advantage of being able to see all three pictures; 1 knew that no one of them was exact, and I could look for the fundamental re semblances between a highly compressed gas, a surface, a cubic crystal, and a liquid solution. If there is a moral to my talk, it is: "Have your analogies for servants, not for masters, by keeping them always conscious." They are probably most useful when taken in big doses but not too often, as occasional analogical sprees. Sometimes men have imagined utopias for molecules just as they have for them selves. One utopia is the "perfect crys tal/' which has a place for every mole cule, and a molecule for every place. Some will allow the molecules a little warmth, and permit them to oscillate about their prescribed positions. But no molecule may take the place of any other. The "perfect crystal" is a completely or ganized state in which every citizen has duties but none has rights. No wonder the crystallographers talk of "unit cells." In a "perfect gas," on the other hand, there is complete anarchy. Each mole cule can go anywhere in all space, and no molecule pays any attention to any other; each goes its own egotistical way. There is nothing attractive about such behavior. A "perfect solution" is a true de mocracy. All molecules are equal, re gardless of their size, shape, or color. But we are not ready to talk of solutions yet. Let us look at the mutual energy of two molecules as a function of the dis 437</page><page sequence="2">438 American Scientist E O r Fig. 1.

For a perfect crystal, the mutual energy is infinite, unless the distance is that prescribed by the size of the cell (Fig. 2). There will be more positions of finite energy further away, provided that all of the nearer positions are occupied by other molecules. A "quasi-perfect gas" differs from a perfect gas by the addition of a region of negative energy for some very close approaches, while for other close ap proaches the energy remains zero (Fig. 3). In a quasi-perfect gas, the molecules either disregard each other completely, or two molecules coming in contact react chemically. This extremely crude model gives a very fair representation of chemi cal equilibrium in gases, and often does not do too badly for solutions even if the solvent is neglected completely. 0 E r Fig. 3. Mutual energy of two quasi perfect gas molecules. E Fig. 2. Mutual energy of two per fect crystal molecules. For a van der Waals gas, we add a region of infinite positive energy at very short distances (Fig. 4). We can do a better job, making the re lations less stiff and eliminating sudden jumps, by letting the energy vary grad ually with the distance (Fig. 5). One expression which works very well in many cases where there is no chemical action is a repulsive energy proportional to the inverse twelfth power of the dis tance, and an attractive energy propor tional to the inverse sixth power. If there is chemical reaction, we have a descent to a much lower narrow well. Next we should give some considera tion to why molecules behave in this way. We might think first of gravitation, but we soon find it unimportant. If the two molecules are charged, the electro static energy corresponding to Cou lomb's law is most important. If we could take one gram of hydrogen, and r Fig. 4.

Fifty tons per mole at 8000 miles! As a result of this huge energy there never is a very large excess of positive or negative ions anywhere, but the electrostatic forces due to small excesses are very im portant when there are ions. Electrostatic forces are important also with molecules that have two or more widely separated charges. Such mole cules tend to align themselves with un E r Fig. 5. Mutual energy of two gas molecules, improved picture. like charges nearer than like charges, so the net electrostatic effect is an attrac tion. This attraction is most important with molecules that have these charges very near the surface. Many substances have exposed negative charges, but the important positive charges are in mole cules with a hydrogen attached to oxy gen, nitrogen, or fluorine. So we often speak of a hydrogen bond. The mole cules of water in ice are held together almost entirely by hydrogen bonds. Even when the average position of the electrical charges is symmetrical, there will be instantaneous dissymmetry be cause of the motion of the electrons. If two molecules are close together, each alters the other's timing, and alters it in such a way that the resulting forces are attractive. These are called dispersion forces. They are entirely responsible for the attraction between the rare gases, and are the most important attractive forces between most molecules which do not react chemically. However, if a molecule with an odd electron meets another molecule with an odd electron with the opposite spin, there is a large decrease in energy. The decrease which I ascribed to chemical reaction is due to the formation of an electron pair from two electrons of opposite spin. This is the energy that - PERFECT GAS -VAN DER WAALS FLUID - REAL FLUID c Fig. 6. Energy of many molecules. holds the carbon atoms together in the diamond. The repulsion is more difficult to account for quantitatively. Centuries ago men knew that two objects cannot occupy the same space at the same time. We can now express that statement more accurately in some special cases, but wc cannot explain it much more satisfac torily. Behavior may scarcely be called social until the group contains more than two molecules. Then it is necessary to know more than these energy curves could show even if they were exact. Are two company and three a crowd, or will one molecule behave toward each of two as though t'other fair charmer were away?</page><page sequence="4">440 American Scientist If three are not a crowd, how many does it take to make one? If the action is chemical, we speak of the valences of the atoms or groups; even if it is physical we may speak of the number of con tacts, which would be four for each water molecule in ice and for each carbon atom in diamond, and twelve for each of a group of close-packed spheres. Usually it is found to be easier to con sider a great many molecules than to work with any small number greater than two. The simplest diagram is probably one which depicts energy as a function of the concentration (Fig. 6). For a perfect gas the energy is inde pendent of the concentration. For a van der Waals gas the slope is ?a, inde pendent of the temperature, until the concentration reaches three times the critical concentration. Higher concen trations are forbidden by entropy con siderations. For a simple real substance the slope remains nearly constant to about twice the critical volume, and then rises steeply, but the nearly constant slope at low concentrations is not inde pendent of the temperature. It becomes less negative as the temperature in creases, and even becomes positive for very high temperatures. The difference between real molecules and van der Waals molecules lies in the fact that van der Waals pictured perfectly hard spheres, while real molecules are a little soft, so the energy of repulsion does not change with infinite slope as the molecules touch. At very high tempera tures many of the molecule pairs are climbing the steep slopes of these curves together. Liquid Solutions Let us now consider in some detail simple liquid solutions. We want to know the energy change resulting from mixing two liquids, and we can assume that the energy necessary to evaporate each of them is known. Heitler, the cubic-crystal man, would say that the energy of mixing A and is zero if the energy of evaporation of one mole of A is the same as that of one mole of B. Van der Waals, the compressed-gas man, would say that the energy of mixing is zero if the energy of evaporation of one volume of liquid A is the same as that of one volume of B. This corresponds much more closely with the facts. Langmuir, the surface man, would say, however, that the energy of mixing is zero if the energy of breaking one contact between two molecules is the same, and that the number of contacts a molecule can make is proportional to its surface. So far this is better still. Actually Langmuir did go further and state that the surface of a molecule is proportional to the two thirds power of its volume. This would be true, of course, if all molecules had the same shape. But real molecules are more often like strings of beads, and the number of contacts a molecule can make is more nearly proportional to its volume than to the two-thirds power of its volume. Nevertheless, Langmuir was correct in stating that what counts is the number of contacts. When we are dealing with a large num ber of molecules, it is not enough to consider the energy. We must also take into account the entropy. All three of these men assumed that the contribu tion of any molecule depends only upon the fraction of the molecules which are of its species. They assumed this because they did not think of anything different, but they would not have known how to work with any other assumption if they had thought of it. Later, the polymer chemists found the discrepancy so large that they had to resolve it. They found that the effect of a molecule on the entropy depends on the fraction of the molecules which belong to its species, but also upon the ratio of the volume of that species to the average volume of all the molecules. Here again we reach a better result if we replace the ratio of the volumes by the ratio of the number of contacts that the molecules can make. If the energy of mixing is zero and the entropy depends only upon the num ber of molecules, the solution is called perfect or ideal. I stated earlier that a perfect solution is a real democracy.</page><page sequence="5">Communications 441 Each individual molecule behaves the same regardless of the size, shape, color, or species of the molecules it is thrown with, and its influence on the whole sys tem depends only upon the fraction of the molecules which are like it. The other methods of counting, when ap plied to the entropy, are equally demo cratic, but they do count a large mole cule as more important than a small one. If two molecules combine to one, they do not keep two votes, but they do have more than one. By the surface theory, size alone is not enough, but it is the number of contacts that counts. The more versatile molecules can make more than one kind of contact. Let us consider alcohol. Two-thirds of the molecule is like a paraffin hydrocar bon, with large dispersion forces but no other attraction for other molecules. The hydroxyl end is like a water mole cule, except that there is only one hydro gen which can form a hydrogen bond. So the alcohols cannot form a three dimensional lattice like ice. They can form long chains, each hydroxyl group having two hydrogen bonds and furnish ing the binding hydrogen for one of them. Apparently they do form such chains in many solutions. The car boxylic acids, on the contrary, tend to stop at double molecules because they have acceptors so related geometrically to the hydrogens that a pair can form two hydrogen bonds, and thus use up all the resources of both. When ice melts, some of its hydrogen bonds are broken, and the molecule changes its very close relations with four others to much less intimate relations with eight to twelve neighbors. The increased number of contacts outweighs the decreased strength of each, and the whole group comes closer together. Most of the hydrogen bonds seem to persist in water, which probably con tains many submicroscopic ice crystals. We are having fun now trying to under stand mixtures of water and hydrogen peroxide. The hydrogen peroxide mole cule is very likely to go to pieces, but otherwise it behaves socially much like water. It also has two bond-forming hydrogens. It is somewhat larger than water, and it has four acceptors for hydrogen bonding instead of two. There is quite a decrease in energy when hy drogen peroxide and water are mixed, but it seems quite probable that this may be explained merely by the greater number of opportunities for binding in the mixture. A large molecule like a protein has much greater versatility. The protein molecule I know best is serum albumin, with a molecular weight of 69,000. It contains almost ten thousand atoms, about five thousand of them hydrogen, three thousand carbon, one thousand oxygen, seven hundred nitrogen, and forty sulfur. It has about a hundred acid groups and about a hundred basic groups. There is one group, probably a sulfhydryl, which combines so strongly with mercuric ion that one mercury ion will combine with two albumin mole cules if there are not enough mercury ions to go around. Thus one little mer cury atom holds together two groups of ten thousand atoms each. This appears to be most specific. Only mercury can do it, and only one kind of serum albumin. Some of the serum proteins have de veloped a very great specificity, or fussi ness about the molecules with which they will react. If some foreign sub stance is introduced into the blood stream, globulins will appear which react with the foreign substance. The foreign substance is called an antigen, and the globulins which react with it are antibodies. We do not know if the anti bodies are made by altering globulins that already exist, or if they are manu factured for the specific purpose. We do know that they persist long after the antigen is introduced. Antibodies are the substances that give us immunity to some diseases after the first attack. Probably the disease antigens are very different from anything that circulates normally in our blood. But antibodies are also the substances that react to blood cells from another blood group, and the very severe reactions which they</page><page sequence="6">442 American Scientist produce must depend upon very slight differences between the antigens. The A's are as strongly antkB as the B's are anti-A, so it is not the existence of a generally undesirable trait which makes one substance bad. Probably these reac tions also once served a useful purpose in protecting society, but now they seem as senseless as some of our human caste systems. We still know only a little about these reactions, but we are learn ing fast. What we now know gives no indication that they are very different from the chemical actions which we do understand. Indeed I think that the most impor tant way in which molecules resemble human beings is that the likenesses be tween any two societies are much more important than the differences. Perhaps the conclusion to this discussion was ex pressed by Kipling: "And the things that you learn from the yellow and brown, will help you a heap with the white."</page></plain_text>
