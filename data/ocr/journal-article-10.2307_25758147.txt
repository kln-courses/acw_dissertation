<plain_text><page sequence="1">Ethnographic Verisimilitude Michael Jackson Harvard Divinity School I dream of a writing that would be neither philosophy nor literature, nor even contaminated by one of the other, while still keeping -1 have no desire to abandon this - the memory of literature and philosophy. Jacques Derrida1 I have always drawn a strange comfort from the fact that the author of the earliest perfect specimen of the novel' (Benjamin 1968: 99) pretends to feel apologetic about the tale he has told and the character he has created - for in his prologue to Don Quixote, Miguel de Cervantes declares that his book lacks erudition and doctrine' and has nothing to note in the margin or to annotate at the end.Tn the same ironic vein, he goes on to say that, unlike other tomes, his book lacks those citations from Aristotle, Plato, and the entire horde of philosophers'that readers so admire, and is even devoid of references to Holy Scripture. This irony is compounded when Cervantes turns to a fictitious friend for advice. As his 'friend' reels off a series of arcane references and classical allusions, we are left in no doubt as to Cervantes mastery of the academic and literary canon, and we are reminded that what is new' about the novel as a genre is that it engages directly with life, 'sincere and uncomplicated' as Cervantes puts it. Life, for the novelist, is not something to be inter preted or a problem to be solved; it is a journey to be embarked upon, an adventure to be described, a mystery to be fathomed. Don Quixote is an eccentric figure not simply because he is a living parody of the chivalric tradition in which he has ardently schooled himself, but because his errant career subverts that tradition. The world of books not only drives him mad but drives him out into the real world? Over many years of anthropological work and writing I have been brought back to a dilemma that may never be solved. For to fully embrace the vocation of ethnog raphy is to find oneself at odds with the profession of anthropology, not only because one s primary allegiance lies with the people with whom one lives and works in the field, but because doing justice to their experience Etnofoor, Writing Culture, volume 21, issue 1,2009, pp. 9-19</page><page sequence="2">means rejecting many of the genre conventions, the jargon, the key concepts and the paradigms that define professional identity, competence and prestige. For me, the practice of ethnography demands that I am peri odically driven, like Don Quixote, from the sanctuary of libraries and the comforts of an academic commu nity, into the real'world, subjecting myself to its unset tling, surprising, and sometimes dangerous twists and turns. If my writing retains a picaresque element, resisting closure, it is because I can never bring myself to organize as a lineal argument, the improvisatory and open-ended experiences of fieldwork where one is typically embroiled in events over which one has minimal control and limited understanding. I am, of course, not alone among ethnographers in turning to the tradition of novel writing as a source for ways in which one can respect the unpredictable, complicated, often incoherent character of a life, as well as its indeterminate relationship with cultural patterns and ideals. Much of my work has explored and crossed these borderlands between what has been convention ally included within the purview of social science and what has been excluded from it. But having recourse to narrative techniques and to radical empiricism to flesh out and make vivid the encounters, events and details that comprise life as lived is not a pretext for invention; rather, it is a call to do justice to the lifeworlds of others, to recognize what is at stake for them, and to render their lives readable. Hence my irritation with the writing cultures' school, with its tendency to privilege the textual and subjective construction of ethnographic reality over the contextual pressures and intersubjective processes that determine the way in which this reality gets rendered in writing - and my dismay at many recent experiments in ethnographic writing that make fieldwork experience a mere point of departure for poems or stories whose aim is display literary prowess rather than communicate an understanding. Inevitably this broaches the question as to how one understands the relationship between objective and subjective models of truth. Whereas the classical empiricist approaches human reality with an eye to underlying patterns and explanatory principles, the radical empiricist shares with the creative writer a fascination for the mysterious, emergent, and conflicted character of all human relationships. As with the clas sical dilemma tales of Africa, moral, intellectual or legal clarity is defied by the impossible situations in which you find yourself thrown. Your canoe capsizes in the middle of a wide river, and your mother, your daughter, your sister, your wife, and your mother-in-law find themselves floundering in the deep water and fighting the swift current. It is physically impossible for you to rescue more than one of these drowning women, all of whom you are duty-bound to respect, and on whom your own life in one way or another depends. What do you do (Bascom 1975: 93-94)? The call is not for fixed or final answers and, in any case, one can invoke no hierarchy of values that implies that the life of one of these individuals can be set unequivocally above the others. The point of the riddle is to provoke palaver, to provide an opportunity for people to discuss and debate the impossible quandaries of existence, and to foster an acceptance of multiple points of view as the only way of coping with life's bewildering contingencies and double-binds. Here, we can find no consolation in notions of adaptive advantage, rational choice, or moral codifications of what is right or wrong; life confounds 10</page><page sequence="3">reason and is refractory to explanation. At most one can say, 'God only knows,' and accept the limits of what any human being may know, do, or endure. Mindful of the sceptical tenor of these African tales, I resist explaining away the indeterminate relationship that seems to exist, on the one hand, between the conditions that frame our fate, set our course and determine our identity and, on the other, the unfore seen events, adventitious encounters and improbable developments that characterize the course of an actual life. As the writer A.M. Homes understates it, alluding to the fact that she was given up for adoption before she was born and only met her biological parents when she was an adult: 'I have often felt the difference between who I arrived as and who I've become' (Homes 2007: 7). This difference is something we all under stand, though it is especially difficult to come to terms with for those who have been denied any knowledge of, or any relationship with, their birth parents, for in such cases a person remains in the dark as to who he or she arrived as,' and fills the void with excessive imaginings that cannot be tested against any reality. If one has a chance of doing so, as A.M. Homes did, and as many of Australia's stolen Aboriginal children did, years after the original separation, the gap between what one has imagined and what one actually encounters may be impossible to cross. Of her first meeting with her biological mother, A.M. Homes writes, 1 am not who I thought I was, and neither is she the queen of queens that I imagined'(2007: 3). These are mysteries: how a shadowy, unrealized or imagined relationship can hold a person in thrall, eclipsing the relationship he or she is actually and pres ently involved in; how our relationship with ourselves blurs into relationships with significant others; how what is given, in biology or by fate, connects with what we become, by dint of experiences undergone, vicissi tudes weathered, situations encountered, crises worked through, and, above, all experiences dreamt, fantasized and imagined. Such existential situations simply cannot be reduced or referred to evolutionary struggles or single issues - of mating, finding food, defending terri tory, lighting the darkness. For much of its history, socio-cultural anthropology typically conflated singular and collective identities. One read about 'the' Trobriand Islanders or 'the' Tall ensi as though a people living in the same place, participating in the same economy, and having roughly similar views about boat building or begetting, sorcery or sociality seldom if ever called their lifeways into question and only changed their ways of thinking and acting when the outside world forced itself upon them. Though anthropologists like Raymond Firth showed that structure does not preclude the exercise of choice in the organization of everyday life, the general tendency was not to focus on the relative conviction with which customary beliefs were held, the compe tence with which roles were performed, the strategies whereby marriages were made, or the singular stories people might tell, but on the rules people followed, the roles they filled, and the integrity and continuity of the social systems of which they were a part. One conse quence of this way of doing anthropology was to create discursive boundaries between various human polities and perpetuate the popular illusion that non-Western peoples were essentially unlike us. Few anthropologists reflected publicly on what we' might have in common 11</page><page sequence="4">with 'them/ or how 'they might differ amongst them selves. Thus, totemism, animism, anthropomorphism, witchcraft and sorcery were all assumed to be sui generis phenomena typical of pre-modern societies, and until Levi-Strauss demonstrated the illusory and ideological character of these terms (Levi Strauss 1963), few anthropologists acknowledged either the empirical diversity of the phenomena that were spuri ously assembled under these headings, or the obvious similarity of certain modes of thought that were labelled quite differently in different parts of the world. Rather than deepen our understanding of the ways in which the human mind creates systems of identifica tion (as in 'totemic belief'), or how human beings express ambivalence toward outsiders (in witchcraft accusations, xenophobia, scapegoating, and the institu tions of homeland security), these exoticizing terms served mainly to distance the rational subject - the anthropologist - from the supposedly irrational other - the object of his or her observations. My own assumption is that societies differ not in their essences but in the ways in which they manage universally identical existential issues - keeping body and soul alive, bringing new life into the world, coping with separation and loss, creating ontological security. These coping strategies are, I believe, variations on ubiquitous themes that are grounded in the evolu tionary history of our species. Each and every one of us, Kiwi, Kuranko or Kiriwinian, is simultaneously the same as and different from everyone else who ever lived, lives, or will live' (Arendt 1958:8). In other words, our humanity is both shared and singular, and our identity consists in both being identical and the same (idem) and uniquely ourselves in contrast to others (ipse) (Ricoeur 1992: 2-3, 116). For Hannah Arendt, however, human distinction does not automatically imply otherness. Although all human beings are distinctive, she argues, none is absolutely other, for we share the same capacity for interacting and communi cating with one another, based on a common evolu tionary heritage and vague perceptions of a common humanity. A striking example of this is Bob Connolly's and Robin Andersons film, First Contact. At first sight, the New Guinea highlanders see Leahy, Dwyer and their Papuan bearers, as reincarnations of their own ancestral dead - like people you see in a dream.'But as curiosity overcomes fear, people see that these are not spirit beings, but variants of themselves. As Kirupano Eza'e observed, years after the event: 'One of our people hid, and watched them [the white men] going to excrete. He came back and said, 'Those men from heaven went to excrete over there.'When they had left many men went to take a look. When they saw that it smelt bad, they said, 'Their skin might be different, but their shit smells bad like ours' (Connolly and Anderson 1987:44). To make a person other, one arrogates Being entirely to oneself, and makes of the other a mere object of one's actions, one's judgment, one's compassion or one's theorising. Sameness is played down - 'sacrificed' one might say - and difference played up until a radical alterity, a pseudo speciation, an essential incompatibility defines relations between self and not-self. While the anthropology I encountered as a student at Auckland and Cambridge tended to focus on differ ences and discontinuities - matrilineal/patrililineal, centralised/uncentralised, dionysian/apollonian - and anthropologists made their careers on the basis of being specialists in specific cultural areas, spokesmen for 12</page><page sequence="5">'their'people, and rarely committing themselves, except in seminars, to serious reflection on human plurality, the advent of structuralism and sociobiology brought universals back into vogue. Then globalization became the catchword, with diffusion, diaspora, transnation alism, cosmopolitanism and hybridisation defining the postmodern condition, and notions of systematicity and boundedness, both ethnic and discursive, rendered passe. Yet this same period saw a proliferation of life stories and life histories, as well as an ongoing interest in regional ethnography, so that we seem to be caught, as much as ever, between the Scylla of particularism and the Charybdis of universalism. My aim has been to overcome this antinomy between the particular and the universal by exploring what Sartre refers to as the 'singular universal' (Sartre 1971: 7-8; Herzfeld 1997) and Michael Herzfeld calls 'ethno graphic biography' (Herzfeld 1997) - in which individual lives and cultural circumstances are neither ontologized, nor polarized, but seen as mutually arising and contra puntal aspects of our continually shifting sense of ourselves as being both uniquely a 'you' or a 'me' and members of a class or a culture, as in 'We, the Tikopia.'3 Consider our tendency to see the singular and the collective, the individual and the group, the local and the global as designating ontologically discrete domains. The problem here is akin to the longstanding philo sophical problem of unravelling the relationship between percepts and concepts - the experience of being so involved or absorbed in an activity that we have no external vantage point from which to compre hend it, and the experience of looking back at a completed action and rendering a post facto theoretical, interpretive or narrative account of it. These two modes of experiencing a social field - from within (in which case one becomes a null point that occludes seeing oneself completely or grasping fully what one is doing or saying) and from without (in which case one sees the field after the event or from afar) should not be construed as competing domains, the first belonging to the psychologist or phenomenologist, the second to the social scientist. Rather, they are mutually entailed moments of being, and reflect a natural oscillation in human consciousness between engagement and disen gagement. Against the scientific tradition that privi leges a disengaged mode of experiencing and makes epistemological claims that this provides a rational or superior mode of knowing, phenomenology invites us to give equal weight to an engaged mode of experi encing and to lay claim to it as an equally significant mode of knowing. One of the most radical implications of this phenomenological corrective is presaged in the radical empiricism of William James. By this term James sought to place the transitive on an equal footing with the intransitive - verbs with substantives, agitation with stasis, moods with meanings, images with ideas. To fully describe a bird we must accord equal attention to its moments of perching and its moments of flight. Perched, it suggests a person taking stock, contem plating or lost in thought. Flying, it calls to mind someone so immersed in her routines, so bent on some purpose, that she is able to give little thought to abstract matters of identity and meaning. This attentiveness to the transitive and the transitional inspires one to give more space in ones writing to relationships rather than relata, and to give methodological priority not to the 13</page><page sequence="6">identity or subjectivity of who and what is interacting but to what transpires in 'the subjective in-between (Arendt 1958: 183), what comes into being in this intermediate space of human interest, intercorporeity and interlocution. Bypassing both the individual subject and culture as sui generis phenomena, one seeks to explore the space of appearances - where that which is in potentia becomes in presentia - disclosed, drawn out, brought forth, given presence or embodied. Object relations theory is particularly helpful in making critical events central to ethnographic analysis. Culture, writes D.W. Winnicott, is 'in fact neither a matter of inner psychic reality nor a matter of external reality' (Winnicot 1974: 113). Comparing culture with transitional phenomena and play, Winnicott goes on to argue that culture is a 'common pool ... into which individuals and groups of people may contribute, and from which we may all draw if we have somewhere to put what we find (Winnicot 1974: 116, emphasis in text). This means, for Winnicott, that culture is not some kind of ready-made, omnipresent composite of habits, meanings and practices that are located in the indi vidual or in the environment, but a potentiality\ aspects of which will be realised and experienced variously in the course of our interactions with others, as well as our relationships to the everyday environments and events in which we find ourselves. What is foregrounded one moment, will be backgrounded the next, while what is focal for one person may be peripheral for another. Consider, for example, the person for whom religious values and observances appear to play not part in his everyday life yet turns to God in a crisis, crying out His name, summoning His help, seeking to strike a bargain, hoping to be saved. Or one might cite the many examples from Australian Aboriginal ethnography in which ritual marks and manages a transition from in potentia to in presentia. Ancestral essences, seeded in the ground, are fleshed out in song, dance and body painting so that the latent past becomes fully embodied presence, much as a child passes from intrauterine to worldly existence, or the desert comes to life after rain.4 A.R. Luria's work exemplifies the ethnographic phenomenology that I have sought to exemplify in my own work. Like his teacher and mentor, Lev Vygotsky, and his disciple, Oliver Sacks, Lurias approach to neuropsychology was informed by the conviction 'that even the most elemental functions of brain and mind were not wholly biological in nature but conditioned by the experiences, the interactions, the culture, of the individual' (Sacks 1987: viii). Lurias view that 'human faculties could not be studied or understood in isola tion, but always had to be understood in relation to living and formative influences (Sacks 1987: viii, emphasis added), is echoed by many physicians who readily speak of medicine as both a science and an art, demanding of the practitioner biomedical competency as well as an attentiveness to the subjectivity of the patient and his or her narrative experience and a recog nition that healing is as much an outcome of care, trust and cooperation as it is of pharmacological interven tions and surgical procedures (Kleinman 1988). Luria also invokes Goethe's view that theory is grey, whereas the tree of life is green, in outlining what he calls a 'romantic science' that refuses to reduce the 'wealth of living reality'to 'abstract models that lose the properties of the phenomena themselves' (cited in Sacks 1987: x). In his case studies of the 'mind of a 14</page><page sequence="7">mnemonist, and a man with a shattered world' Luria describes in compelling detail what it was for these men - the first afflicted, like Borges' Funes 'the Memo rious,'with an inability to forget; the second oppressed by an inability to remember - to live within the limits of their social and psychological situations. Instead of reducing Zazetsky to his brain injury, Luria reveals Zazetsky's dynamic relationship with his condition over time, his struggle to make good what he had lost. Re-reading this remarkable book recalled, for me, a section in my mothers journals headed 'My Life with Arthritis' in which she refers to her 'illness' as 'my ever constant companion for over fifty years' (Jackson 2009: 84-94). Like Zazetsky, my mother's humanity consists in what she made of what she had been made and brings home to me the extent to which all human beings, in all societies, experience existence as a struggle between limitations and expectations (Sartre 1963:49). This existential view has a methodological corollary, succinctly captured in Niels Bohr's Abtotungsorinzipy which warns against destroying the subject of our investigations through the techniques with which we carry them out, as well as an epistemological corollary, best articulated in the phenomenological view that the truths we live by and the truths with which life may be explained are seldom congruent, and that the latter should not be used to subvert the former or vice versa. We come here to the limits of social science. To understand in depth and detail what transpires within intersubjectivity we draw upon work by social scien tists, psychologists and ethnologists to be sure, but it is to the work of artists, fiction writers and biographers that we turn for techniques that help us do greatest justice to lived experience. In venturing beyond the borders of orthodox science, we may be accused of departing from empirical truth or worse, of pure inven tion and wild surmise. But there may be a middle ground, where anecdote and biography enrich rather than invalidate our work. Let me elaborate by referring to a largely forgotten essay by Lionel Trilling, introducing a 1952 American edition of George OrwelTs Homage to Catalonia.TriHing begins by observing how rare it is that a writer s personal identity is fully acknowledged or fully felt in his or her writing. Indeed, both literature and science tend, conven tionally, to background or occlude the authors own biography in order to give his or her characters, concepts and conclusions greater presence and weight. But like Mark Twain and William James, Orwell presides' over his work, eschewing any false authority and focusing on 'fronting the world with nothing more that one s simple, direct, undeceived intelligence, and respect for the powers one does not have, and the work one undertakes to do' (Trilling 1952: x-xi), he goes on to speak against an etherealizing tradition, dating from the enlightenment, that privileges abstract, rational thought over the commonplace bodily, emotional, and mental realities or our everyday lives. There are overtones of John Deweys empirical naturalism and Bakhtins grotesque realism in Trilling s argument against reification. The prototypical act of the modern intellectual is his abstracting himself from the life of the family. We have yet to understand the thaumaturgical way in we conceive of intellectuality. By intellectuality we are freed from the thraldom to the familiar commonplace, from the materiality and concrete ness by which it exists, the hardness of the cash and 15</page><page sequence="8">the hardness of getting it, the inelegance and intrac tability of family things. It gives us power over intangibles, such as Beauty and Justice, and it permits us to escape the cosmic ridicule which in our youth we suppose is inevitably directed at those who take seriously the small concerns of the world, which we know to be inadequate and doomed by the very fact that it is so absurdly conditioned - by things, habits, local and temporary customs, and the foolish errors and solemn absurdities of the men of the past (Trilling 1952: xvi). Inevitably, a mode of address that remains faithful to the facts of experience - pedestrian, unsystematic, ill-focused and inchoate though they often are - resists the intellec tual s demand for analytical coherence and the conven tional expectation of narrative closure. In this risky endeavour, I take consolation from Herman Melville's Billy Budd, which I re-read after a trip from Boston to New Bedford with an old friend from Denmark, Hans Lucht, who shared my admiration of Melville. It was a late winter day, the streets deserted, a cold wind off the sea, not unlike the day that Ishmael entered the Whalemans Chapel (the Seamens Bethel) and heard Father Mapple's sermon on Jonah. When we failed to find a door into the chapel, and after peering through windows into the gloomy and ghostly interior, Hans and I crossed the street to the Whaling Museum where we were the only visitors. We spent several hours there, separately meditating on the seamen's parapher nalia, the reconstructed isle, the photographs and scrimshaw work that enabled one to piece together a picture of the lives of whalers in mid-nineteenth century New Bedford, and their relationship with the sea. The following lines from Billy Budd had special relevance to me: The symmetry of form attainable in pure fiction cannot so readily be achieved in a narration essen tially having less to do with fable than with fact. Truth uncompromisingly told will always have its ragged edges; hence the conclusion of such a narra tive is apt to be less finished than an architectural finial (Melville 1998:296). Melville's ambiguous, inconsistent chameleon-like characters, his concern with the instability of trust and identity, and his 'quarrel with fiction are all in evidence in The Confidence Man, where he describes the para doxical nature of truth in these words:5,6 That fiction, where every character can, by reason of its consistency, be comprehended at a glance, either exhibits but sections of character, making them appear for wholes, or else is very untrue to reality; while, on the other hand, that author who draws a character, even though to common view incon gruous in its parts, as the flying-squirrel, and, at different periods, as much at variance with itself as the caterpillar is with the butterfly into which it changes, may yet, in so doing, be not false but faithful to the facts (Melville 1990: 84-85). If nature is replete with incongruities, who can fault a writer for creating incongruous characters? Human nature is as various and full of contradictions as the natural world itself.7 But is Melville seeking to justify the liberties he took with the 'facts' of his youthful 16</page><page sequence="9">voyages in the South Seas? Or do his reflections on the inconsistency of character spring from a struggle to bring together two seemingly antithetical notions of truth, the first respecting objective' fact, the second respecting the way the world appears to a person, regardless of how absurd and ill-informed this may seem to others? Moby Dick juxtaposes treatises on cetology with sermons, short stories, and metaphysical speculations as though no single voice, no one genre could do justice to the complexity and inconclusiveness of Melville's theme. By locating oneself in this border land between conventional certainties and vigorous innovation, a writer may be taken to task for playing fast and loose with the facts - as Melville was - when, in fact, truth itself is mercurial in this domain where what rings true to experience or works in practice may be scientifically unproven, and what is empirically true falls short of what we need to believe if we are to live. The image of a borderland is therefore more than an image of interdisciplinarity or blurred genres; it is image of an empirically multiplex world. Moreover, the borderlands defines a vexed and ambiguous zone that is not merely geographic or political; it defines an exis tential situation of being betwixt and between, of struggle and suffering, that Karl Jaspers sums up in the term Grenzsituationen (border/limit situation).8 The frontier throws up images of borderline experiences, of a destabilized and transgressive consciousness in which 'dreams, repressed memories, psychological transfer ences and associations' possess greater presence than they do in ordinary waking life, and religious experi ences emerge from the unconscious like apparitions (Carrasco 1992: 102). This interplay between border lands and borderline phenomena - between 'the differ ences we have with others and the conflicts within ourselves' (Carrasco 1992: 106) also find expression in the work of Gloria Anzaldua. 'Mestizo, consciousness/ she observes, may be identified with a juncture ... where phenomena collide' (1999: 101). This implies a shock culture, a border culture, a third country' where migrants find themselves at the limits of what they can endure, border patrol agents are stretched beyond the limits of what they can control, and intellectuals find that orthodox ways of describing and analysing the world do not do justice to the experiences involved. We are thus reminded that all lives and lifeworlds are more complex and variable than is suggested by the paradigmatic discourses of the academy, the popular media, and governmental organizations. To do greater justice to lived experience we need to put ourselves quite literally in the place of the other, seeing the world from his or her standpoint, bringing together insider and outsider perspectives. But the ethnographic method of participant-observation is, in itself, not enough; we need novel forms of academic writing and interdisciplinary thought that place non-European and European epistemologies and theologies on the same footing. That is to say that borderlands suggest sites of intransitive, unstable and intersubjective meanings that call into question the kinds of reductive and essential izing language that make human experience appear to be coterminous with the conventional categories of religious, cultural or social identity that people use in representing their experience to themselves and others.

With [such] words and phrases the poor gentleman lost his mind, and he spent sleepless nights trying to understand them and extract their meaning, which Aristotle himself, if he came back to life for only that purpose, would not have been able to decipher or understand' (De Cervantes 2005:1). 3 A man is never an individual. It would be better to call him a singular universal; totalized and thereby universalized by his period, he retotalizes it by reproducing himself in it as a singu larity. Universal by the singular universality of human history, singular by the universalizing singularity of his projects, he demands to be studied from both sides' (Sartre 1971: 7-8). 4 Indeed, for Warlpiri, an imagery of birth and becoming is used to describe the ritual work of bringing the ancestral world periodically back into being (Jackson 1995: 57-58). 5 The title of Nina Baym's renowned essay, 'Melville's Quarrel with Fiction' (1979: 909-23). 6 The term confidence-man was coined by the New York Herald in 1849 to describe the activities of a certain 'William Hudson and later became associated with the showman P.T Barnum, whose signature phrase 'there's a sucker born every minute'was in fact put into circulation by one George Hull who unearthed a fake giant near Cardiff, New York in 1859 and made a small fortune from the thousands who flocked to see it. 7 When writing The Confidence Man, Melville may have had Montaigne's observations in mind: 'We are all framed of flaps and patches and of so shapelesse and diverse a contexture, that every peece and every moment playeth his part. And there is as much difference found betweene us and our selves, as there is between our selves and other.'Certainly, in Billy Budd, Melville reveals to a debt to Montaigne as a writer skilled in 'treating actual men and events ... free from cant and convention and able to 'philosophize upon realities' (Melville 1990: 244). 8 Jaspers contrasts Grenzsituationen with Altagssituationen (eve ryday situations'). While we are able to gain an overview'of our everyday situations and get beyond them, limit situations pos sess finality'; 'they are like a wall against which we butt, against which we founder' (Jaspers 1932:178-179). For an account of Grenzsituationen in English, see Ehrlich, Ehrlich and Pepper 2000: 70). Though Adorno treats the term 'frontier-situations' as part of a jargon of authenticity - on a par with 'being-in the-world,' 'individual existence,' and 'heroic endurance' - a way of 'usurping religious-authoritarian pathos without the least religious content,' I see it as a way of escaping from the two dominant discourses of our time, the first that reduces all meaning to political economy, the second to religious belief or doctrine. In my view, it is precisely this tendency to politicize or intellectualize religious experience that the existential concept of Situation helps us to overcome (Adorno 1978:152).
