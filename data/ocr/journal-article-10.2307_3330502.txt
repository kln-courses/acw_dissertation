The Nuer are a people in southern Sudan; most of their land is located in the hydrologic region known as the Southern Clay Plain of the Nile River basin. The 1990 population of the Nuer was between 1.5 and 3.0 million people. Nuerland is subject to extreme but highly regular fluctuations of climate. Rainfall varies in intensity and duration according to seasons established by the direction of the winds. The land is extremely flat. The general effect is that the Nuerland is hot and arid, especially in the dry season of the year. The Nuer way of life is largely pastoral. The Sudd region (flood lands) of the White Nile is the principal source of water during the dry season. People move their livestock on a regular cycle to pools, lakes, lagoons, marshes, and river channels in the dry season and to higher pastures during the wet season. The Nuer are often identified as a paradigm case of an acephalous society-a society without a head. Mary Douglas referred to them as being without palaces or prisons and of circumstances where regulative ideas emerge from social interac- tions.' The development and use of a common language among the Nuer reflect opportunities to communicate with one another in the various exigencies that bring people together and assign meaning to the world. Regulative ideas are regulatory in the sense that marshalling activities depend on a shared community of under- standing. The Nuer as an acephalous society have a close kinship to federal societies, if the AUTHOR'S NOTE: I am thankful to Vincent Ostrom, Elinor Ostrom, Patrick O'Meara, Gayle Higgins, Stanra King, and Stacy Land for their assistance in preparing this article.

There are, however, important features of Nuer society pertaining to ideas of covenant, breach of covenant, and reestablishing the bonds of covenantal relationships that have important implications for all covenanting societies. How a covenanting people think about themselves, their relationships with each other, and their relationships with the larger world, are essential elements in what constitutes a people and their way of life. Common understandings are based partly on similar experiences of the past and partly on basic conceptions of universal order. Individuals think of and justify their own constitution of order in terms of their conception of a universal order. Conceptualizations of political order vary among different cultures. The dominance of the way people think about their own order is made more explicit when they teach their young basic elements of their culture. In an environment where contact with other peoples is relatively frequent, the way people conceive of and explain their constitutional arrangement is, however, susceptible to challenge. The choices people make in ordering societies and organizing principles are, therefore, not uniform, although many scholars have tended to believe that there is only one way to order human societies, namely, the hierarchical structure of organizing authority relationships.3 This view overlooks the way in which diverse societies operating in different cultural environments realize their potential. Per- sons can order their relationships with one another based on shared ideas and the regulatory significance of those ideas in marshalling human activities. Oral accounts suggest that the Nuer have existed for a very long time in relative harmony without a common head. Nuer society is grounded on concepts of covenantal relationships and mutual agreements to resolve daily problems consistently with equality and fairness with reference to limited mediating authorities. First, I shall indicate how the concept of covenant is based on common conceptions of God as the source of man's creation. This concept in Nuer cosmology influences the ways in which the Nuer organize their institutions and their relationships to one another. Second, I will explain the central role of the spokesman as a man of virtue in the Nuer political system. This discussion will demonstrate how concepts and political structure are harmonized. Finally, I will explain how duer developed as a means of coping with an imperial order that was corrupting and destructive of the Nuer way of life. 2Daniel J.

The existence of the world and the institutions of marriage and family are explained in terms of the Nuer idea of cak (creation). Used as a noun, cak means the creation, that is, all created things. As a verb, "to create," it signifies the act of creation. Because there can be no "creation" from "nothing," there is presumed to be a source of creation, a transcendent order: God. However, cak can also be used to refer to the imaginative constructions of men, such as thinking of a name to give to a child, inventing a tale, working out a system of rules, or composing a poem. The word, therefore, means creation by thought or imagination, so that "God created the universe" has the sense of "God thought of the universe" or "God imagined the universe."4 The Nuer believe that things are as they are because God willed it. The heavens and the earth, the waters on the earth, the beasts, birds, reptiles, and fish were made by Him. He laid down marriage prohibitions for man. He gave ritual powers to some men and not to others. This inequality of powers was established, as will become clear later, in order to provide a means to order relationships between individuals related to one another through a segmental family structure that is also viewed as a divine creation. Everything in nature, in culture, in society, and in men is as it is because God willed it so. Nuer think of God as the giver and sustainer of life and the one who brings death.5 The Nuer kuoth is conceptualized as neither a thing of wood or stone, nor an anthropomorphic being, but rather as a spiritual entity. The Nuer do not act toward Him as though He were a man. If He is to be spoken about, or to, He has to be given some human attributes. He is the father of men, their creator and their protector. Kuoth is believed to be in the sky. He is not the same as the sky. He is just especially in the sky in the same way as men are especially on earth. He has no real physical location and no spatial boundaries. In addition, kuoth is a creative spirit, ubiquitous and invisible. He sees and hears all that happens. He can be angry and can love.6 The conception of kuoth as a protector is further elucidated in the frequent use in prayers of the word rom (care and protection parents give to a child, especially in caring for a helpless infant). Another concept often used in prayers, luek, literally means advice, or to guide. God is asked to luek e naath (guide people), which confirms the presence of God. But He is also felt to be far away in the sky. He can, however, be communicated with through prayers and sacrifice. Also, a certain kind of contact with Him is maintained through the social order or rules He is said to have instituted and of which He is the guardian. 4Douglas, Edward Evans-Pritchard, pp. 96-97; Edward E. Evans-Pritchard, Nuer Religion (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1956), pp. 4-5. sNuer do not believe that God causes anyone's death but rather that He can be angry and allow angry "spirits" to cause harm.

At base, these arrangements consist of a man and a woman united in marriage. Domestic relations are what constitute ciaang cieng (life in the family). The birth of children gives rise to relationships between parents and children and older and younger brothers. These relationships among persons within the family and household organization are governed by luek (rules) and customary practices.7 Because the family is a key aspect in the governance of Nuer society, established family law is a part of the larger political order. Children must honor their parents and their parents' age-mates. A wife must obey her husband. A man must respect his wife and wife's kin. Younger siblings must respect older siblings, but do not have to obey them because they stand equal before their father. If an individual fails to observe luek, he not only loses the support of his kin but, it is also believed, the favor of his ancestors and of God. Retribution, in one form or another, is bound to come sooner or later. The Nuer regulation by which a widow remains married to a dead husband gives the rightful family great stability and durability. The domestic group, the house- hold, may break up through the death of the father, but the rightful family, the group of husband, wife, and children born of the wife, endures. The personnel of the household may undergo many changes, but the institution of the family is fixed by the payment of bridewealth, which determines who is the rightful father of any children born of the wife, whether that man be alive or dead. The family structure survives the dispersal of its members.8 The position of father is lawfully predominant in Nuer society. It is through their lawful father, even if he did not beget them, that children trace their descent. They belong to his clan and enjoy the rights of that group. From him they inherit. His herd is their birthright, and any cattle that would have been due to him were he still living belong to them as his heirs. Whatever social or ritual status he may have had, they also inherit. The Nuer think of a son in a lawful family as dependent on the father. A son has no property rights independent of his father, does not own cattle in the family herd (which belongs to the father), and has disposal of the cattle only through the permission of his father or as his father's heir. The status of the members of the house toward one another is more or less in harmony with their sentiments. The feelings of respect and affection of a son to a father are directed toward a man who actually is his physiological and lawful father. The mutual dependence between father and son tends to promote harmony between them. It is usually the son who cares for his father in old age. Begetting sons is a form of security for the future. A father raises the son now and receives assistance from him in the future. 7Wal Duany, "Neither Palaces Nor Prisons: The Constitution of Order Among the Nuer."

Mismanagement of cattle by a father could involve close kin in a conflict between father and son. Because of kin solidarity, relatives are concerned with each other's economic welfare and security. This also implies that the authority of the father in the household is not absolute but limited. A father, for example, cannot kill his son with impunity. All family members stand equal before their Creator regardless of their status. Family disputes are, however, usually contained within the household and resolved speedily to prevent polariza- tion. When a man marries a woman in the name of his paternal uncle or of a brother who is dead, the son he begets is his father's brother's son or his brother's son, and belongs to a different family and potentially to a different gol (household) than that of the man who has begotten him. The legal personality of this son is not, therefore, merged with that of his genitor but with that of his dead father whose status he assumes and whose property rights he inherits. Mar (kinship) relationships continue to be maintained, however, between the household of the genitor and the son's family. Mar relationships, including both agnatic and cognatic kin, provide the stable framework of kinship structures. "Family" associations of one kind or another have independent existence. They anchor, however, an individual to some group.9 If a person breaks away from one group, sooner or later he attaches himself to another group, takes root in its stem, and becomes part of its growth. The Nuer conception of order emphasizes that human relationships are structured by individuals in- volved in society. Persons are viable agents in the maintenance of order, but they must also take into account the interconnections among members of a community and the consequences of their actions on the community. Men are valued as individuals and treated with consideration, sympathy, and respect. A common creation and a commitment to the laws of their Creator have important significance for the constitution of order. First, all Nuer are created by kuoth. They are gaat kuoth (sons of God) and stand equal before Him. Nuer think of themselves as having equal standing in constituting long-term patterns of order. Second, God has given ran (each person) life and the ability to think for himself so that he can do certain things of his own to advance his own interests and to glorify his Creator. Third, there is the implication that the development of a group is primarily viewed as a process of mutual agreement among individuals. This further implies that the Nuer constitution is an artifact made by people to achieve important tasks and things of value for themselves. CONCEPTIONS OF EGALITARIAN SOCIETY The way Nuer people think of their life is reflected in the way they organize their social relationships. The presumption of equality before their Creator gives 9There are a variety of family associations among the Nuer. For details see Edward Evans-Pritchard, Some Aspects of Marriage and the Family Among the Nuer (Lusaka, Zambia: Rhodes-Livingstone Institute, 1945), pp. 49-65; P. P. Howell, The Manual ofNuer Law (London: Oxford University Press), pp. 73-81.</page><page sequence="6">72 Publius/Fall 1992 individuals equal standing in the establishment of patterns of order. A nonhierarchical order is regarded as normal. The establishment of a family is thought of as a means by which new social tissues are formed. As marriage is ordained by kuoth for the purpose of supporting the multiplication of human beings, human love toward one's parents is considered to be acquired by learning. It is a duty of a family to the Creator to raise and care for children. Because loving and caring constitute acting in accordance with the divine will of kuoth, obedience is owed by children to parents and by wives to their husbands only if the parents or the husband have fulfilled their duty. Because all men are children of God, "love thy neighbor as yourself'" implies that neighbors are ones equally entitled to a fellow-feeling of brotherhood. From this basis, nonhierarchical relationships are formed. As nonhierarchical relation- ships develop from the love of God and adherence to His laws, relationships among members of a family remain harmonious under conditions of mutual respect. Orderly relationships in a wider community can be achieved by extending the love of God's children to other social relationships outside the family. So long as each individual seriously takes into account the interests of others, destructive conflicts between individuals can be avoided. If individuals follow the principle of "being in the right" (that is, conducting oneself according to the accepted code of behavior), they will also pay respect to social rules and authority relationships. Failing to do this is considered wrong because it incurs punishment from kin and from the supreme being and reduces the honor and prestige of the family in the society. Being in the right is the goal of character-building in Nuer society, which is begun by parents at home. Individuals know that one is in the right by the support one receives from kin. This principle of "being in the right" is the root of all virtues.10 Nuer religion teaches that whoever is in the right is always doing cuong (right), but whoever is not in the right is always in the wrong and offends elders, religious leaders, equals, and his juniors. As Douglas observes, all relationships in Nuer society revolve around the practice of being in the right.'1 Tojustify nonhierarchical relationships on a basis of being in the right has fundamental implications in a society of equals. Being in the right with others relies on the competence of individuals to maintain the integrity of nonhierarchical arrangements. This author- ity relationship is generalized beyond family relationships. In cases where persons in conflict cannot meet to negotiate, tensions within the structure of authority relationships are inevitable. In order to resolve conflicts among members, third-party intervention by a mediator is required. The Nuer believe that mediators, as members of the priestly lineages, are endowed by kuoth with the ability to cause harm to befall those who obstruct the process of dispute resolution. A mediator is believed to be authorized by God to coerce, curse, and ban from his territory individuals who are destructive of civil peace. In addition to their capacity to coerce, curse, or ban, mediators are well versed in Nuer traditional law. Due to their knowledge of the law, persuasion, and the popular belief in their powers to cause harm to come to individuals, mediators are able to facilitate conflict I1Douglas, Edward Evans-Pritchard.

DEVELOPMENT OF THE CONCEPT OF LAW The Nuer, like other human societies, order their relationships by using rules. Rules reflect the norms people use to decide which actions should be forbidden and which should be permitted or required. By forbidding and imposing limits on all possible actions, individuals are able to achieve predictability and still exercise considerable freedom. Shared rules order behavior in daily life and permit stable relationships that make interdependence productive. Rules are not, however, self-formulating. The task of making rules (enforcing rules and altering rules) is a key function of governance. In an acephalous society, the authority to create rules lies with the individuals who use covenanting as a method of formulating specific rules. A common understanding of rules is an important prerequisite to an effective rule of law. The absence of a single source of common authority to make rules poses a fundamental problem: how to create rules that apply equally to all members in a segmented structure of authority relationships. Because kuoth has given all Nuer a set of general principles, individuals can use these as a guide when making specific rules applicable to smaller communities. Actions consistent with the principle of doing right are permitted, and wrong actions are not allowed. Thus, specific rules exist that guide decisions people make in resolving a given dispute. This can be observed in the structure of the legal system where nguot and cuong are recognized. Nguot: The Legal Foundation of Covenantal Relationship A substantial consensus concerning the rules that govern individuals is vital to establishing harmonious relationships among members of a community. People must understand what is allowed and what is forbidden if interdependence is to be meaningful and acceptable. The spirit underlying proper conduct has a link with Nuer cosmology. This link is the concept of nguot, which means to cut. As used here, nguot means "to cut a covenant," to cut an agreement, or establish a code of behavior for the transaction of tasks valued among individuals.12 It is used to describe covenantal relationships made among men. Nguot suggests that an inviolable bond exists. The result of nguot is a commitment to an established relationship in connection with people. People negotiate and compromise to reach an agreement, but the formalizing element of the nguot commitment is essential to establishing the relationship. People involved in making a nguot commitment verbally declared the nature of the bond or agreement being made. In many cases, '2The concept of nguot-cutting process relating to the establishment of covenantal commitment manifests itself throughout the ancient languages of the Middle East, North Africa, and Africa South Sahara. See Palmer O. Robertson, The Christ of the Covenants (Phillipsburg, N.J.: Presbyterian and Reformed Publishing Company, 1980), pp. 3-67; Dennis J. McCarthy, "Three Covenants in Genesis," Catholic Biblical Quarterly 26 (April 1963): 179-189; Erich Isaac, "Circumcision as a Covenant Rite," Anthropos 59 (1964): 444-456.</page><page sequence="8">74 Publius/Fall 1992 symbolic action accompanies the verbal commitment. These actions include the offering of sacrifice, the dividing of animals in performing yang ruali (the ritual for incest purification),"3 and nguot kuen (the killing of an ox signifying an agreement about bridewealth). The binding character of a covenantal commitment is related to the terminology of "cutting."14 As a nguot relationship is established, animals are "cut" in ritual ceremony. The most obvious example is the shedding of blood in sacrifice. Depending on the types of nguot commitment being initiated, the meat of the animal is cut into pieces and divided for consumption. The meaning of the division of animal meat at the point of the nguot commitment is fundamental to the social order of the Nuer. The division symbolizes a "pledge to the death" at the point of the nguot commitment. The dismembered animals represent the curse that the nguot-maker calls down on himself if he should violate his commitment. By his transgression, he would call down on himself the curses of the covenant or the rule. Thus, he might expect the dismemberment of his own body. This would be the punishment prescribed by the covenant mediator designated by kuoth as His agent in the execution of justice. The covenant mediator or his representative oversees the process of establishing a covenant and renewing a covenant. Once the nguot relationship has been established between individuals or groups, nothing less than the shedding of blood may relieve the obligations incurred in the event of violation of the nguot commitment. Changing a nguot commitment requires mutual agreement, and it is in this context of establishing covenantal relationships that the Nuer concept of nguot is to be understood. Blood is significant because it represents life."5 Life is in the blood, and so the shedding of blood represents a judgment on life. When a breach of the bond is committed, the individual who has been wronged or unjustly deprived of his rights will be set for a fight to enforce his rights unless the community's intervention makes fighting unnecessary by renewing a covenant. Sacrificing cattle belonging to the wrongdoer is a method commonly used by Nuer to punish wrongdoing and to reestablish a covenantal relationship. Cuong: The Rule of Proper Conduct in Community The concept of cuong (and duer) is derived from that of nguot. Cuong can mean "upright," for example, in reference to the upright supports of byres. It is also used figuratively to mean "firmly established," as in the phrase be gole cuong, or "may his hearth stand."'6 It is most commonly employed, however, to mean "being in the right" in both a forensic and a moral sense. Discussion in law cases is for the purpose of determining who has the cuong (right) in the case, or who has the most right.

If he has, then he has cuong, right on his side. The individual involved is seen as doing that which ought morally to be done, that which is conformable with the nguot commitment, or good social order, in tune with the universal order. If a person has cuong, he has observed the rules of proper conduct in community life. This concept of cuong relates directly to man's behavior toward his Creator. It also relates to the Creator in a more indirect way, in that He is regarded by the Nuer as the founder and guardian of human morality. This does not suggest that God immediately and directly sanctions men for their wrongdoing. The Nuer believe rather that sooner or later and in one way or another "good will follow right conduct" and "ill will follow duer (wrong) conduct." If a man keeps himself in the right, that is, if he does not break rules or wrong others, and fulfills his obligations to spiritual beings and to his kindred, he will avoid serious misfortunes or punishment. Edward Evans-Pritchard observes that the Nuer, who are a quarrelsome people, avoid, insofar as they can restrain themselves, giving gratuitous offense, because of the fear of God. The thought of God's heavy-handed intervention encourages compli- ance with the rules of right conduct. Mary Douglas observes: If a man were to refuse to pay up in the social transactions, the whole system would collapse like a pack of cards. It is no small political achievement that any Nuer to whom a cow is owing can go and collect his debt in a camp of strangers with all the immunities of law, because he was in the right. The pressure of cattle debts being strong, the wish to evade payment must be strong also. The possibility of fighting it out when one has had the misfortune to kill another must be more attractive than paying over a full forty head of cattle." However, social debts tend to be paid within geographic and social limits. These payments are seen as creating communities that recognize their own distinct identity and that are able to ally with neighbors to defend their rights against more distant foes. Bringing strife to a truce when balanced segments confront each other depends on the inequality in transactions between God and man. Cuong conceived of as justice and righteousness helps maintain a social order among people. The concept of the universal character of divine righteousness implies a uniform relation of God to man, and man to man, and any violation of the rights of other individuals is seen as an affront to divine will. This sense of justice and righteousness as regulative principles is consistent with the argument that nonhierarchical order among the Nuer emphasizes equality, autonomy, and indi- vidual responsibility. Another way to understand cuong is to study trouble cases. The actual experience of Nuer under the various nguot commitments reflects the continuity rather than the discontinuity of such relationships. John R. Commons' concept of working rules of going concerns, with its emphasis on the important role of "Douglas, Edward Evans-Pritchard, p. 106.</page><page sequence="10">76 Publius/Fall 1992 concerned officials in establishing law on a dispute by dispute basis, suggests that trouble-case methodology is the appropriate method for learning what actions are consistent with cuong.'8 Karl N. Llewellyn and E. Adamson Hoebel argue that trouble cases-"instances of hitch, dispute, grievance, trouble"-reveal more accurately the reality of law in a culture than the study of idealized normative patterns or everyday behavior.19 One should not ignore normative patterns or the practices of everyday behavior that occur within the working rules. Both of these perceived "right ways" and normal ways of doing things interplay with locally sanctioned rules of law. However, if regularities in conduct are to be explained by reference to rules, then trouble cases are the way to see rules in action at the boundary points between licit and illicit action. In the end, they are the way to find out whether a stated norm is applied in practice and, if it is, how it is. Examining recent trouble cases arising among the Nuer reveals rules that elders had used in attempting to assess the conduct of disputants or violators. The cases also show that there is a standard application of who is right or who is more nearly right in particular cases.20 However, who is in the right or who is more right, in practice, is affected by structural distance in genealogical terms. This implies that a similar act can be evaluated differently according to the actors' social distance. ARTICULATION OF CONCEPTIONS IN STRUCTURES The Nuer presumption that all men are equal before their Creator poses a problem: how are laws enforced on those members of the society who deviate from the accepted norms? Because there is no paramount ruler, there is no single person or group of persons who enforces rules on everyone else. But if rules cannot be enforced, some people will take advantage of others. The proper application of the rules both by duek (users) and kuar (enforcers) requires impartial standards of judgment in order to maintain lawful relationships in a society. Persons are expected to make normative judgments by applying criteria of choice for distin- guishing right from wrong. The belief in equality among the Nuer supports the idea that each person is one' s own governor, meaning that he is accountable for his own actions to God, who is thought of as the guardian of morality, and to his fellow men. Associating human rules with transcendental power provides a possibility of orderly relationships among people. Conceptualizing God as the guardian of the moral order poses some problems to man because there are the things of above, associated with the spirit, and the things of below, associated with men. However, the Nuer believe that the divide is bridged: God intervenes in men's affairs; the Spirit in the heavens descends to earth in rain, lightning, or works of individual persons.

For the Nuer, the power to "make a leader" or a priest is latent in the community, but for the actual priesthood to emerge, a "form-giving intervention" is required. This intervention occurred when priestly powers were given to some lineages, such as Jimem, Gatleak, and Jikul, in order to permit them to mediate effectively between individuals in conflict.2" Members of these lineages are known as kuar (enforcers) of God's laws; other lineages are duek (users) of the laws. Members of these lineages are scattered among Nuer communities to provide mediating services." The office of mediator is hereditary. The genealogical arrangement assures an individual's participation as a user or enforcer of the law with the blessings of his forefathers. Associated with the nguot commitment are two principles that sanction the incorporation of strangers into Nuer society and the removal of an individual from his or her position of privilege. Enforcers of the law can forfeit their status.23 This principle of removal is grounded in the nature of the Nuer conception of God. Kuoth can love and He can also become angry and withdraw favor or protection. A mediator is viable only because other Nuer have respect for the holder of the office. The holder must therefore act in such a manner as to earn this respect. Users of the law can withhold respect from a mediator who abuses his office, secure in the belief that God will do likewise. The mediators' curse will no longer be feared. The principle of removal does not alter the genealogical position of the person concerned. Through incorporation into existing lineages, peoples of any origin can become Nuer in the fullest sense.24 This implies that Nuer society is made up of collections of people of different origins.25 Incorporation is accomplished through rituals of adoption by which a person's status is changed from that of a foreigner to that of a person of full standing with equal rights and privileges with the adoptive parents. From this point onward, all children born to the adoptee become heir to all the rights and privileges in the adoptee's lineage. The adoptee's line now stands as legitimate heir to the genealogical benefits given to the original line. 21An interesting comparison is found with the Levites of the tribes of Israel. God appoints them as priests and judges of these tribes (Numbers 1: 47-54). They are not counted in the census of Numbers which is used for the tribal political divisions. God gives them no territory but scatters them throughout all the tribes. But, while receiving no territory, they are allotted cities (Numbers 35: 2-8). Especially fascinating is Numbers 35: 6, "The cities which you give to the Levites shall be the six cities of refuge where you shall permit the manslayer to flee." 22A few lineages provide the various peoples with priests.

Spokesmanship is seen as a quality vested in a "God-fearing" person who is able to maintain or restore the nguot relationships between individu- als. A ruic naath (spokesman) does not impose himself or enforce settlement of disputes by his personal prerogatives but reveals the law to individuals and groups. He speaks to the people, he cannot order them. P. P. Howell observes: There is no verb in the Nuer language meaning "to order," and the imperative is not used with any sense of authority behind it. To get another man to perform some task in his behalf, the Nuer must first draw attention to some special relationship between them, whether it be real or fictitious. It is an appeal to the mutual obligations inherent in kinship and is expressed in kinship terms. Gat mar (O kinsman) is the preface to any request which might otherwise take the form of an order. By this I do not mean that the imperative is never used, but it is used only to persons with whom the speaker has an actual and constant relationship, and usually only when the speaker is a senior kinsman. When telling a foreman woodcutter, for example, to order his men to cut down certain trees, the District Commissioner, allowed greater license than others, will use the imperative, but the foreman will pass the order on in more euphemistic terms and include himself in the effort to be made. This is merely an example of the exceptional independence of character of the Nuer and their refusal to admit superiority or domination.26 A Nuer household is believed to be able to govern itself without outside interference. To protect rights threatened by other householders, households rely on the assistance of other kin. This implies a self-help arrangement.27 But whenever there is really a free-for-all, there is a possibility that the strongest will prevail regardless of whether he was in the right. The operation of the elementary principle of self-help usually produces great disparities of wealth and power. Among the Nuer, however, the strongest does not win for three reasons. First, wealth in the form of cattle, goats, and sheep is distributed fairly evenly among households. Cattle are given in bridewealth by each family in accordance with their means and are received by each family in accordance with the number of their daughters of marriageable age.28 Second, there is no accumulation of power. Individual liberties have not been limited so as to allow power to accumulate with a single person or a body of men for the sake of a "good" order. Third, feuding resolves disputes and allows mutual adjustments between groups. Conflict, by creating regular patterns of alliance formation, serves as a functional substitute for a central government. It is in conflict situations that higher levels of organization become visible when regulative ideas 26Howell, A Manual ofNuer Law, pp. 27-36. 27Michael Barkun, Law Without Sanctions: Order in Primitive Societies and the World Community (New Haven, Conn.: Yale University Press, 1968); Douglas, Edward Evans-Pritchard, p. 64. 28Jack Goody and S.

Because diminishing the equality of members in a group is perceived as corrupting, a spokesman must be able to maintain the unity of the group by the consent of its members. COMMUNITY SPOKESMEN AND CUSTODIANS Other political functionaries play important roles in governing Nuer society. (A list of the principal functionaries can be found in Table 1.) The Nuer recognize two major types of tasks that must be performed in order to sustain their society: one is mediating between man and man; the other is "subduing" the earth. There are consequently two types of priests: the kuar muon (earth custodian) and wud ghok (cattle custodian). Again, the representation of divinity, which is the role of these custodians, is exercised by diverse individuals scattered among Nuer communities. A kuar muon (earth custodian) has priestly power derived from a divinity referred to as the divinity of the flesh. The custodian's responsibilities are to control the earth and its productivity and to promote the welfare of those who live on and by the earth.30 The earth custodians mediate between disputants in conflicts concerning rights in land, grazing, and water. They are also called in cases of homicide." Homicide implies that the soil has been polluted with blood, which may explain why the earth custodian is an indispensable participant in the rituals of atonement and reconciliation. His abilities to curse and to ban, which are a threat to any person obstructing the rightful course of his peace-making duties, are believed to have divine origins. The earth custodian's powers, like those of the enforcers of the law, are hereditary. Neither the earth custodian's lineage nor the cattle custodian's lineage were original diel (settlers) of the land. Neither are ever dominant lineages of their areas. Thus, the earth custodian and the cattle custodian do not have the same extensive kin-ties with other lineages in a particular region. As members of neutral lineages, they are able to mediate disputes between the dominant lineages. 2~The Nuer contributes a negative example to theory of state.

Conversely, his curse can adversely affect the health of a man's herd. The cattle custodian also regulates the social processes of the age-set system. He is responsible for opening and closing the initiation periods and, thereby, creating distinct age sets. Age-set membership ranks people in order of seniority, equality, and juniority so that wherever a man may be, he knows what other men he must treat with formal respect and from what other men he should receive this respect. For this to be possible, a clear line must be drawn between successive sets. The cattle custodian's role in defining age sets derives from the fact that initiation into an age-set system alters the relationship of young men to cattle. Initiated young men are forbidden to milk cows. However, the defense of cattle from outside predation by animals or humans is an important connection between the cattle custodian and the age sets. The priestly powers, and the economic and military importance of a cattle custodian add to his hereditary prestige, thereby providing him an opportunity to acquire the greater political status of ruec (spokesman). Although the abilities of the cattle custodian are thought to be more limited than those of the earth custodian, the abilities of both custodians are derived from the same principle: a hereditary and inherent virtue that is implicit in all men of the priestly lineages, active in some, strong in only a few, and manifest in the deeds and, above all, words of the priestly positions.32 In Nuer thought, man has a unique responsibility to "subdue the earth." This subduing involves the realization of all the potential within creation that might offer glory to the Creator." To accomplish this, there are specialists frequently called kuar (chief) or guan (owner or custodian) who have the hereditary abilities to perform certain activities on behalf of the entire community. Guan buthni is the key spokesman of a lineage as a corporation of segments. He helps to resolve conflict in the lineage. Guan thoi (water custodian) has the ability to assure the safety of water when members of a community fish or cross a body of water. The Nuer that he assists can expect to catch more fish. Guan tang (custodian for defense) plans offensive and defensive warfare. Kuaryiika (custodian for family affairs) mediates arguments on death and injuries inflicted on an abducted girl or a married woman by another man. These abilities are confined to people of certain clans and, as with the priestly clans, only a few people within the clan actually practice the regulatory activities, although, theoretically, the ability is inherent in all members.34 These 32Evans-Pritchard, Nuer Religion; Johnson, "History and Prophecy Among the Nuer of the Southern Sudan."

In order to maintain an ordered life, the Nuer rely heavily on multiple agencies for resolving disputes. The representation of the divinity is fragmented and distributed among members of several lineages scattered through many villages who function as mediating agents. Each of these persons can make decisions without reference to another center of authority. MINIMAL GOVERNMENT The traditional Nuer political system has no single recognized chief to run it and no exclusive judiciary to control it. Persons are divided among political units without any single administrative hierarchy of officials and without any single person to direct all of the common affairs of the society. Although they lack the machinery of centralized government, the Nuer do not experience anarchy and indiscriminate violence. The operation of the society depends on the capability of individuals to form stable expectations about the behavior of other members by knowing the rules of the community. However, many scholars assumed that the Nuer, because they do not have a centralized government, have no rules to govern themselves. They have rules. Rules are built upon the foundation of language. If words are to work in promoting social harmony in an acephalous system, some arrangements must exist for formulating them, determining their application, and enforcing relation- ships in accordance with working rules.35 These are the relationships that are identified with governmental institutions in the broadest sense. Among the Nuer, the members of a single gol (homestead) always recognize the authority of their senior member. If the gol is perceived as a self-governing unit and if the authority of the senior member is considered sufficient to establish rule- ordered relationships, then the family institution is, both in theory and practice, capable of ruling itself. It logically follows that minimal government may be consonant with the Nuer way of life where there are multiple decision structures without a single person monopolizing the prerogatives of governance. The concept of minimal government may be a convenient way of preserving the visibility of the individual in the governance of his or her affairs. The Nuer give support to the concept of minimal government in two ways. First, there are rules and a common understanding of these rules. Persons are conscious of the existence of rules as rules. For example, to kill is an offense. Second, certain persons function as leaders because they are respected. These are elder members of the community. People will listen to what they say because of their age and wisdom. Others have recognized priestly powers that are not shared by all members of the community. Certain ceremonies can be performed only by these men. By performing ceremonies, acting out rituals, they are exercising decisions in relation to the persons involved. "Commons, Legal Foundations of Capitalism, p. 531.</page><page sequence="17">The Nuer Concept of Covenant 83 The autonomy of individuals has a profound influence on the design of institutions in an acephalous society. There is no integrated bureaucratic structure to handle public issues. Individuals, family institutions, and voluntary associations are, therefore, left to regulate their local affairs. This permits individuals to work with other members of the society to resolve their problems instead of waiting for an external authority to take action. THE CODIFICATION OF NUER LAW To understand how the Nuer have mediated conflict over time, it is necessary to know what rules concerning wrongdoing have applied in different historical periods. I will first define what is meant by duer and then explain how the Nuer originally provided for remedies, enforced obligations, and punished wrongdoers. Second, I will examine the effect of the imposition of the British concept of law on the Nuer way of life. Duer: A Code of Rules for Punishing Wrongdoing Although a nguot commitment provides luek (rules) for ordering conduct, the Nuer accept that human beings can make decisions that lead to wrongdoing. In order to maintain lawful relationships when an individual's behavior deviates from the acceptable, a way must be found to stop unacceptable behavior and to bring it into conformity with accepted conduct. The word duer needs to be defined. It means "a fault"; the verb duir means "to be at fault." Like similar words in other languages (for instance, English, Arabic, and Swahili), duir has both the sense of missing a mark aimed at-throwing a spear-and also of a dereliction, a fault that is characteristic of retribution. Any failure to conform to the accepted codes of behavior toward a member of one's family, kin, age set, a guest, and so forth is a fault that may bring about evil consequences as the result of either a curse that is voiced or a silent curse generated by anger and resentment. The misfortunes that follow are regarded as coming ultimately from God, who supports the cause of the man who has the cuong (right) in the matter, and punishes the person who is at fault. There are two punishments for duer, which reflect the type of fault committed. Repercussions from a religious fault, such as the breach of an interdiction or the neglect of some spirit, may be avoided by expressions of remorse and a sacrifice. The Nuer believe that sacrifice without remorse is meaningless. Repercussions stemming from wrongdoing of a political nature can be avoided by the payment of reparations. The fact that the consequences of a duer can be stayed by contrition and compensation indicates that the results of wrongdoing are not perceived to be automatic.36 There is a moral, somewhat uncertain, and alterable element involved in the situation. This is made clear by another circumstance. In estimating the number of cattle to be paid in compensation for the misfortune that has occurred, the earth custodian takes intent into account. The Nuer distinguish duer and guac. 36Evans-Pritchard, Nuer Religion.</page><page sequence="18">84 Publius/Fall 1992 The concept of duer normally implies that the fault committed was deliberate, though this is not always the case. Guac means a mistake, an unintentional error. It implies that the action was incorrect but inadvertent and that a person may ask to be excused. The fact that the action was not deliberate, to some extent, alters the circumstances. This is evident in cases where damage and compensation are involved. The manner of discussions and the amount of compensation depend on whether a slaying was premeditated or accidental. The difference in the weapon used is also a qualification. The Nuer consider the use of a fighting spear as an indication of intent. The Creator is thought to take intent into account in breaches of moral law. However, in the Nuer scheme of things, men have to accept the consequences of their actions, whether they are deliberate or not. Certain acts are always a fault. The Way of Mediating Conflict. The maintenance of acephalous order is the function of multiple agents with limited jurisdiction in resolving conflict. When a Nuer feels insulted or wronged, he does not take advice or seek arbitration, but prepares to fight. Threats may yield counterthreats. Hostility easily escalates to destructive fighting that breaches the covenant or the peace of the community. The openness of Nuer decision processes affords recourse to multiple agents who seek to do justice and maintain the peace of the community by finding means to resolve a conflict when parties to a dispute cannot settle it peacefully themselves. A neutral mediator with the ability to sanction is a necessary feature of an effective dispute-resolution mechanism. Among the Nuer such a person is available in a kuarmuon (earth custodian). He is a member of a lineage with the power to curse or to ban from the territory the individuals obstructing efforts to settle disputes. Disputes are argued before ad hoc assemblies of the acknowledged leaders of the kin groups involved. Conflict resolution involves compensation through the payment of cattle, and the rate of compensation, as well as the time it takes to be paid, depends on the local availability of cattle. Agreements are reached and compensation enforced according to the willingness of the kin groups involved to reach a settlement. This willingness is often affected by the closeness of the kin relationship between the groups, the existence of other contemporaneous disputes between the groups, and the threats of physical retaliation made by the victim's group against the lineage of the wrongdoer. A judicious use of the threat of banning or cursing enables an earth custodian to get groups to meet and to agree to a settlement. In addition to the threat to curse or ban, the earth custodian's power of persuasion and knowledge of traditional law are important in the settlement of disputes.37 As some offenses against a person- homicide, adultery, and incest-also involve spiritual duer (sin), which must be removed before a case can be completely settled, the earth custodian's other duty is to perform the necessary rituals of spiritual cleansing. Thus, the settlement of many cases involves the negotiation of both reparations and spiritual atonement. It "Barkun, Law Without Sanctions, p. 129; Howell, A Manual of Nuer Law, p. 28.</page><page sequence="19">The Nuer Concept of Covenant 85 is necessary to emphasize that the acts of spiritual atonement are necessary to any permanent settlement of conflict. Sacrificing cattle is required to prevent the occurrence of a misfortune or sin, to appease an angry spirit, or to curtail or get rid of a misfortune that has already occurred, as in times of plague. On all these occasions, the Nuer believe that God intervenes, or may intervene for better or more often for worse, in the affairs of men, and His intervention is always dangerous. To accomplish atonement for the breach of a covenant, a cow must be sacrificed. A cow is important to the Nuer; in fact, they consider it nearly the equivalent of a human being. Thus, the payment for life- taking is made through bloodwealth cattle. The institution of restitution for a life taken in bloodwealth cattle has its counterpart to bridewealth cattle as establishing the kinship bonds for the creation of life in succeeding generations. The effective functioning of the multiple agents with limited jurisdiction in resolving conflict is important for the maintenance of equality and autonomy of individuals and the renewal of covenantal relationships. Complementarity in Segmented Structure. Complementarity facilitates order in segmented authority relationships. The acephalous system is made up of many units that are formally independent of each other. However, they take each other into account through the processes of competition, cooperation, fighting, and conflict resolution." Although members of what was formerly a single polygynous household may have become separated as a result of fission, the relationship between the members remains unchanged as persons of common origin. They maintain exchange relationships. These kinship links are the essential ingredients that make it possible for these segmented groups to resolve their conflicting interests. Despite conflicting interests, the Nuer perceive that the segments would be better off by taking into consideration the interests of other segments and by resolving disputes through negotiation and compromise. Taking account of the interest of others means that segmented groups are held together as coherent communities of interest, and all their affairs are managed through their joint acceptance of the regulative ideas that marshall activities in the society. These regulative ideas marshalling activities, when they are acted upon, may be considered to form the constitution of the community and to embody the common understanding. The common understanding is the concurrence of the people of the community rather than the will of a single superior. However, rivalry and contestation exist among the segments. People who live adjacent to each other have more in common to quarrel about than those who live away from each other. Competition for scarce resources-land, grazing grounds, water reserves, and fishing reserves-leads to fighting. When rivalry is expressed in fighting, there are limits which bound the fighting. 3According to Vincent Ostrom, the meaning of American federalism and its treatment ofcooperation, competition, conflict, and conflict resolution are ways of achieving coordination in a covenantal society. See Ostrom, The Meaning of American Federalism.</page><page sequence="20">86 Publius/Fall 1992 The nearness and distance of relationships between the persons in conflict influence the use of different weapons. When people who are closely related or who live in close proximity fight, they are not permitted to use spears. Homicide, which may result in a fight with a spear, is wrong within a community because it can lead to the disruption of the economy and security of a community. Only clubs and sticks can be used to fight close kin. When fighting with distant persons in defense of the integrity of the community, the use of spears is permitted. Thus, complementarity in segmented authority relationships implies varying degrees of communities of relationships. The shared interests of adjacent segments facilitates maintenance of a larger constitutional order among the Nuer. Formalization and Corruption of the Nuer Law The duer (rule) for punishing wrongdoing was codified at the insistence of the British imperial authorities. Although they were unaware of many of the institu- tional arrangements that maintained Nuer society, the British did recognize that the Nuer society was rule ordered. The imperial authority chose to recognize the Nuer customary law of duer for use in new British-style courts. If the new courts were to adjudicate on the basis of duer, it had to be written down. Administrators who were not familiar with the concepts of cuong or duer and the underlying shared understandings in the community could not carry out their responsibilities without the written code. In their case, the purpose of written codes was to "enable administrators and chiefs . . . to discuss common interests, and ensure some consistency in administrative policy."39 These written codes can be found in Howell's A Manual ofNuer Law.40 The written codes are known as nguot Fangak, or laws made in the town of Fangak. They are known by many Western scholars as penal law. Nguot Fangak is a list of mandates from the colonial administrators (including native chiefs) and includes penalties for specific offenses. It is a single standard of behavior used by the officials and chiefs as a code. In short, duer is a collection of pre-defined behavioral rules that exact obedience to the accepted patterns of behavior in the community. When duer appears in written form, it is used as a basis to evaluate people's behavior and to punish those who fail to follow the correct form. Duer, by definition, only refers to penal law. This classification shows that duer is, in fact, more of a supportive legal code than a challenge to the traditional way of right behavior. The model of proper conduct implied in duer can be identified with the principle of cuong. The punishments apply only to those who act in ways that do not conform to accepted patterns of behavior. The Conceptual Conflicts between Cuong and Duer. The Nuer traditional rules of cuong and duer are complementary in their work of maintaining social order. However, important conflicts have developed between the two since the creation of "Howell, A Manual of Nuer Law, p. 1. 40Howell, A Manual of Nuer Law.</page><page sequence="21">The Nuer Concept of Covenant 87 the written codes. In British courts, the method of punishing wrongdoers by requiring that they compensate their victims was replaced by a method that exacts punishment on the perpetrator.41' The establishment of the British-style court system and the appointment of chiefs, conflicts with the Nuer scheme of things in several ways. First, before the creation of the chiefs' courts, the village assembly- village council of elders, religious leaders, and age-set groups-played significant roles in the administration of justice. The creation of chiefs' courts drastically curtailed the ability of those bodies to play their traditional judicial roles. Second, physical confinement as a method of punishment is contrary to the principle of compensation. In a society that punishes deviations by requiring payment of cattle to repair the damage, physical confinement was not an accepted practice. In addition, the application of physical confinement requires jail facilities and machinery to monitor this type of punishment. The Nuer chose not to develop such institutions. They rely upon banishment rather than imprisonment. They believe confinement would result in suffering and would generate bitterness on the part of supporters of the victim and undermine harmony in the society. The Nuer also challenge the application of nguot Fangak in the chiefs' courts because it is not concerned with the spiritual aspect of life. In fact, the Nuer maintain that it is the spiritual aspect of man that maintains proper behavior. In other words, it is the mind that guides men's behavior. The force that prevents men from committing crimes is the fellow feeling of brotherhood, that is, of covenantal relationships. If the doing of justice and righteousness is not developed in men, Nuer cosmology presumes that men will disregard moral judgment. As a result, the lack of spirituality is thought to lower one's moral fiber and one's will to resist evil temptations. The Nuer argue that every religious law and ritual is not an isolated pattern of behavior; they contribute in some way to an individual's actions. The Nuer believe that no written law and no amount of punishment will prevent people from deviating from the accepted pattern of conduct unless the spirit of respect for the spirituality of each person is inculcated in their hearts and minds. The Nuer realize that a man can make unintended errors. This implies both ignorance and potential to learn. With greater moral understanding, men can avoid external restrictions being imposed on them and become responsible for doing right in relation to one another. Constituting order in a society requires the development of a fear of God and a sense of shame for being a wrongdoer.42 A social order based solely on penal law and punishment has no moral foundation. When people know the grounds on which to conduct disputations, they will use the written law to further their self-interest at the cost of others. To the Nuer, conflict resolution is grounded more on a conscience of doing right, repentance for doing wrong, and renewing covenantal relationships in a spirit of reconciliation and compromise. Mutual trust among people is important for self-governance. Written law is inflexible. Once an imperial government proclaims a law, a government must 4Ibid., p. 234; John Wuol Makec, The Customary ofthe Dinka People ofSudan (London: Afroworld Publishing Company, 1988), p. 12. 42Koang Reth, Interview, Khartoum, Sudan, 26 August 1989.</page><page sequence="22">88 Publius/Fall 1992 strictly follow it to build credibility. Human society is too complicated to be ruled by unalterable law. Written codes disjoined from appropriate processes of gover- nance in ongoing communities of relationships restrict the flexibility of inquiry, moral reflection about how to reestablish binding relationships with appropriate affective ties, respect, friendship, brotherhood, and affection mediated by custodi- ans who seek to sustain the bonds of covenantal relationships. Nguot Fangak Becomes Nuer Law. For the "foreign" rulers who had to reorganize the governing of the Nuerland within the Sudan, the concept of cuong became difficult to realize in a large and extensive political setting.43 This is because there is a lack of purely objective criteria for the idea of cuong. The need to unify laws in order to govern the many autonomous units of Nuer society was paramount in the drive to use written law to order an acephalous society under "alien" rule, acting in accordance with a principle of indirect rule. The conference of Nuer chiefs held at Fangak in 1948 was called by the colonial authorities to evaluate the draft rules. The chiefs thought that the threat of physical confinement would be an important additional tool in achieving cuong. These chiefs were handpicked by the British authorities; hence, they were more obliged to accept what had already been decided. The Nuer were expected to adapt and to adjust to the new ways of doing things. Adopting the written duer as Nuer law had several consequences for the constitution of order among the Nuer. First, the nguot Fangak was accompanied by a secularization of Nuer governance. Persons with priestly powers were removed from the governance system in the process of implementing the change from leaders with priestly powers to secular leadership. Kuar muon and wud ghok were regarded as kujur (magicians) and foreign to Nuer society. Instead, persons were appointed as kuar who were perceived as gat wec (citizens of the area). In fact, these were the secular leaders belonging to the dominant lineages. The imperial authorities assumed that prophets and priests were of foreign origins and usurped power from the citizens, and that they had to be eliminated. Traditional leaders and ordinary people opposed this change, but the colonial government prevailed and imposed secularization. Second, the individuals designated as gat tut (head man of an area) sought to acquire a warrant (a license), possession of which enabled the recipient to become a member of the native court. Court membership was now viewed as a prize, a quick avenue to wealth and power. This is largely the reason for the extraordinary demand for warrants among the Nuer lineages. The presumption was that the person appointed as chief must have a warrant because his authority over his people is insufficient without a warrant. This scramble for warrants led to the appointment of many "chiefs." In the process, the "ungodly" were exalted thus leading, ultimately, to a basic transformation of Nuer social life. Leaders were seen as having two separate roles, one in an alien administrative structure and another in Nuer society. While the administrative structure was very much a part of Nuer life, in 43Howell, A Manual of Nuer Law, pp. 225-230.</page><page sequence="23">The Nuer Concept of Covenant 89 many ways it was never fully absorbed into Nuer society, and became increasingly separated from religion. CONCLUSION Nuer governance was shaped by the conceptions Nuer hold about themselves, their universe, their relationships with each other, and their relationships with other people who may come into contact with them. Nuer perceived themselves as gat kuoth (children of a common Creator) and therefore inherently equal. The role of individuals within the social and religious system is an active one--of doing right and of being responsible for one's actions. Because they shared the same conception of God and God's law, and the same ideas of what could go wrong and how to set it right, the Nuer had the possibility of building covenantal relationships. Despite the absence of a clear center of authority and ruling bureaucracy, therefore, a process of governance goes on. There are regulative ideas at work- being acted upon-which are constitutive of a way of life. The spiritual permeates the cultural and social. Individuals can call on numerous persons possessing priestly (spiritual) powers to mediate covenantal relationships-to tie the spiritual to the mundane in building and renewing covenantal relationships. The core ideas are a covenantal cosmology, building covenantal relationships, a watchful concern about the breaching of covenants, and an enduring effort to renew and reestablish covenantal relationships whenever breaches occur. This type of society is viable as a self-organizing society. British imperial rule, even when accompanied by a commitment to indirect rule, was disruptive because law is conceived apart from covenantal commitment. The concept of covenant and a covenantal way of life are so integrally related that to have the one without the other would be destructive of Nuer society. If a covenanting way of life is a federal way of life, a federal society can exist without having reference to two or more "levels" of "government."</page></plain_text>
