<plain_text><page sequence="1">"LEST YE PERISH IN THE WAY": RITUAL AND KINSHIP IN EXODUS 4:24-26* Christopher B. Hays Emory University This study develops two ideas about God's attack on Moses in Exod 4:24-26 in light of the ancient Near Eastern context and traditional Jewish interpretations. First, Zipporah's act of circumcision may be compared to ancient practices of apotropaic magic and sacrifice, rituals that sought divine protection. Second, her statement, "Surely you are a "Vp'^jnn to me," invokes Yahweh's mercy by claiming her family's relationship to the Divine Kinsman. As long as the Hebrew Bible has been read, the Lord's attack on Moses and his family has been a source of discomfiture, fascination, and puzzle ment. Scholars have been troubled both by the reason for the assult and by the mechanism of Moses' deliverance. To judge from the modern commen taries, it does not seem to be licit any longer to begin a discussion of Exod 4:24-26 without an initial disclaimer concerning the sheer difficulty of the passage. The pericope is "terribly mysterious,"1 "very obscure,"2 "enigmatic,"3 "notoriously difficult,"4 and the cause of "much brain racking."5 Although this study does not purport to "solve" the passage, it does de velop a pair of ideas about its ending. The first is the relationship of Zipporah's action to ancient practices of apotropaic magic and sacrifice. Her act of circumcision may be compared with ancient Near Eastern rituals that sought divine protection. The second is the possibility of re-reading her statement?"Surely you are a DW'jno to me"?in light of Divine Kinsman theology. Zipporah is claiming kinship to YHWH, thereby invoking his mercy. Even these ideas will be seen to flow into and out of older streams of tra dition; and indeed, I will not pretend to dispel the darkness of all previous interpretations. Instead, I intend to honor the spirit of midrashic polyphony * I thank William Gilders and Amy Robertson for their kind help in reading and commenting on this article.

Another said, "It was at the feet of the angel." The third said, "It was at the feet of the child." (y. Ned. 3:9) The text goes on to adduce support for each of these possibilities, but none is chosen or excluded. Although I choose a path in my interpretation, my hope is that it will open up new understandings more than close off old ones. My governing assumption is that the Hebrew Bible (especially this piece of it) is a "gapped text," and that "the gaps are there to be filled by strong readers."6 The filling of those gaps is part of Daniel Boyarin's defini tion of midrash; thus my project is essentially midrashic, and I aspire to the grace and humor of the Rabbis. Translation 19 Now the LORD said to Moses in Midian: "Go, return to Egypt, for all the men who were seeking your life have died." 20 So Moses took his wife and his sons, and he mounted them upon the donkey, and he returned to the land of Egypt. And Moses took the staff of God in his hand. 24 On the way, at the camp, the LORD7 came upon him8 and sought to kill him. 25 But Zipporah took a flint and cut off the foreskin of her son, and she touched it to his feet and said, "Surely you are a blood relative9 to me."26 And he backed off from him. It was then 0 that she said, "A blood relative," in reference to circumcision. Verses 21-23, which look ahead to the fate of Pharaoh's firstborn son, are probably an insertion that interrupts the flow of the narrative, and they 6 D.

The Greek and Targumic variants ("an angel [of the Lord]") seem to fit the general discomfort of later tradents with direct anthropomorphic activity of the part of God, and are thus not to be adopted.

Although Zipporah's action is the focus of this study, the context of the surrounding verses is crucial to understanding it, and so I take them piece by piece. On the way, at the camp, the Lord came upon him Moses is "on the way" to Midian after God's call on him is briefly re newed in 4:19-20. Various opinions are recorded in the history of interpre tation concerning the object of the Lord's "attack" in verse 24: Moses or his son? The Syriac simply adds Moses' name to answer the question. In Targum Onkelos, Zipporah says it was Moses who would have been "con demned to die." That is also the beginning assumption of the Talmuds? "Great is circumcision, for all the supererogatory deeds that Moses our teacher carried out did not stand up in his defense when he neglected the rite of circumcision." (b. Ned. 31b)?although both also record the opinion that it was the child (y. Ned. 3: "Heaven forbid! The angel did not seek to kill Moses, but the child."). Ibn Ezra supports the idea that it was Eliezer, claiming that he is not named in verse 24 because he did not yet have a name, being only eight days old.12 For Rashi and Rashbam, however, the peshat was that it was Moses who was attacked. This interpretation is preferable if one omits verses 21-23, as I have suggested, and allows verse 20 to set the immediate narrative context for verse 24. That is to say, Moses, who is referred to by name in verse 20, ought to be the one referred to in the object pronoun of int?a?".] (v. 24). I offer two further points in support of this thesis: 1) The person who is attacked must be the same person who is "on the way," and it is highly unlikely that the narrative would set the scene with 11 Specifically, Propp has 4:22-23 as E with 21b as an RJE text. Anthony F. Campbell and Mark O'Brien, following Martin Noth, deem verses 21-23 a non-Elohistic addition to J (Sources of the Pentateuch: Texts Introductions, Annotations [Minneapolis: Fortress, 1993], p. 134). Richard E. Friedman calls all of 4:21-23 an E text (The Bible with Sources Revealed [San Francisco: Harper Collins, 2003], pp. 125-126). Finally, Childs is agnostic, content to say that the J and E sources, if both are present, "are not easily disentangled" (The Book of Exodus, p. 94). 12 All Ibn Ezra citations are from his (shorter) Commentary on the Pentateuch: Exodus (trans. H. N. Strickman et al.; New York: Menorah, 1996). In general, given the various available editions, when citing rabbinic commentaries, Targumim, and other older texts that are indexed to the biblical verse, I will not cite a page number for the modern edition.</page><page sequence="4">Hebrew Studies 48 (2007) 42 Hays: "Lest Ye Perish1 reference to an unspecified child who has hardly been a part of the story to this point. 2) If it were the son, then Moses is not a part of the story at all13 and so the son's identity would not need to be specified again when Zipporah cuts off his foreskin. and sought to kill him Why would God seek to kill Moses? Perhaps the most logical answer in the narrative context is offered by Rashbam, who connects it to the Lord's frustration with Moses for resisting his call (Exod 4:14): "the anger of the LORD was kindled against Moses." In this view, Moses was not supposed to go home and bring his family with him. The most common classical Rabbinic answer, however, links the attack to its solution, rooting YHWH's action in some failure concerning circumcision. Interestingly, the initial assumption of the Talmuds is that it is Moses who had failed to be circumcised?y. Ned. 3:14: "Because Moses was slow in getting circum cised, the angel sought to kill him."14 In this case, Zipporah's action is seen as a sort of vicarious circumcision on behalf of Moses. A version of this stance, incorporating Freudian theory, is adopted even in the modern period by Propp.15 The Talmud Yerushalmi stays with the theme of Moses' failure to be cir cumcised, while the Bavli quickly shifts the focus to the child?b. Ned. 3IB: "This is what he thought: 'If I circumcise my son and then go forth to Pharaoh, I will endanger his life.'" This is the primary interpretation taken up by the medieval Rabbis. Ibn Ezra thinks the attack on his son convinced Moses to send his family back to Midian, explaining their absence from the events in Egypt. But which son was it? The most "naturalistic" interpretation in the rabbinic tradition (cf. Exod. Rab. 5:8, Rashi, Ibn Ezra) is that Eliezer had been born eight days before, and that Moses had neglected to circumcise him because of his travels?so Mek. Amalek 121-122: "It was merely be cause he relaxed and thought of lodging before performing the circumcision, that the angel sought to kill him." Similarly, Rashi says: "Because his first concern was his lodging." A more fanciful reading is also found in Mekilta, however: that Moses had struck a bargain with Jethro, that in exchange for 13 Nevertheless, some interpreters have suggested this interpretation, e.g., Saadya. 14 Compare H. W. Guggenheimer, The Jerusalem Talmud, Third Order: Nasim, Tractates Sotah and Nedarim (Berlin: Walter de Gruyter, 2005), p. 515. 15 W. H. Propp, "That Bloody Bridegroom (Exodus IV 24-6)," VT43 (1993): 514.</page><page sequence="5">Hebrew Studies 48 (2007) 43 Hays: "Lest Ye Perish" taking Zipporah as a wife, one of their sons would be an idolater? presumably Gershom, because his name incorporates the term for "sojourner," or, in later rabbinic Hebrew, "convert" (Mek. Amalek 1). In this view, Gershom the sojourner was converted and circumcised a bit late in his boyhood. How shall we assess these interpretations? After the birth of Gershom (Exod 2:22), "a long time" passes (2:23), so this is not the eighth day for him. Nor does Jethro's enthusiastic worship of YHWH in Exodus 18 support the idea that he insisted on an idolatrous grandchild.16 On the other hand, Exodus Rab bah and Rashi say that it was Eliezer, Moses' second son, who was uncircumcised. Eliezer is not mentioned until Exod 18:3, but he must have been born at that point because of the plural sons in 3:20 (source critics often attribute the plural to harmonizing by RJE).17 But while the text allows for the conclusion that the attack was related to a failure to circumcise, it does not support it much. Notes Propp, "It seems unfair and implausible that readers should be expected to infer" so much.18 Furthermore, from a source-critical standpoint, the eighth-day command ment (Gen 17:12) is from P, and I am working from the assumption that our text is J, if not earlier. Therefore let us bracket this question as unresolved. Another answer may be sought after we look at Zipporah's saving action. Zipporah took a flint and cut off the foreskin of her son, and she touched it to his feet. Circumcision is described here, obviously enough. The more vexing question is: To whose feet does Zipporah touch the bloody foreskin? All three possibilities?Moses, his son, and the divine figure?are suggested in the Talmud passage cited above. Exodus Rabbah strays further from the text by saying that she cast it at her own feet. In order to discern among the varied explanations, it will be necessary to have a correct picture of what Zipporah does, and what it might have signi fied in its ancient context. First of all, the idea that she throws the foreskin at someone's feet (cf. Rashi) is mistaken. Cornells Houtman adduces a few texts in an attempt to argue that the Hiphil of in: can mean "throw" (Isa 16 On the other hand, a sensitive reader might make much of his confession, "Now I know that the LORD is greater than all gods" (Exod 18:11)?obviously he did not know until then! See references at footnote 11, above. 17 See references at footnote 9, above. 18 W. H. Propp, "That Bloody Bridegroom," p. 500.</page><page sequence="6">Hebrew Studies 48 (2007) 44 Hays: "Lest Ye Perish" 25:12; 26:5; Ezek 13:14; Lam 2:2),19 but those passage all involve tearing down walls or buildings; they are not proper analogues. Therefore, Zipporah touches the foreskin to someone's feet. Grammatically, the most obvious possessor of the feet would be the boy, since he is the proximate male noun in the sentence. On the other hand, if any proper noun were to be omitted in reference to body parts, it would be the Lord's, given the anti anthropomorphic tendencies of various tradents. If it is the feet of the boy, then "feet" must not be a euphemism for "genitals," since there would be no need to place more blood there. Hans Kosmala has taken up the interesting idea that the blood functions apotropaically?blood rites, he notes, "often serve as a prophylactic, espe cially among the Arab peoples."20 Yet Kosmala cannot adduce any direct ritual parallels to his smearing of blood on the thighs as a sign to the angel? his comparison involves smearing blood on the forehead, where it is plausi bly more noticeable. He does not explain why a divine figure would be able to perceive blood on the thighs, but not on the genitals.21 Although Kosmala's reading does not prove convincing, it does raise again an interpretation that was rather popular in antiquity: that the circum cision was some form of communication with the divine figure. The earliest versions seem to favor the idea that the feet referred to are the feet of the angel, and that Zipporah is somehow making supplication (in another idiom, the Hiphil of JttJ can mean 'draw near')?Old Greek: "she fell down at (his) feet"; Onkelos: "she approached before him"; Neofiti: "she placed it before the feet of the destroyer (angel)"; Syriac: "she seized his feet."22 Neofiti goes on to accord power to the blood itself: "[Now,] may the blood of this circumcision atone for the sins of this bridegroom." This pas sage points to a connection between atonement and apotropaism, which will be developed later. Ibn Ezra compares it directly to the application of pas chal blood to the doorways, and Rashbam says that it was "to appease the angel." 19 C. Houtman, "Exodus 4:24-26," p. 85. 20 H. Kosmala, "The 'Bloody Husband,'" VT 12 (1962): 24. 21 In general, Kosmala's "Midianite hypothesis," based on a reconstruction of Zipporah's (essentially unknown) background, is so speculative as to be unfalsifiable. We do better to base an interpretation on Israelite and known comparative data rather than on "natural presumptions" that Zipporah "may have retained some of he older beliefs to which she was accustomed in her early youth" beliefs about which Kosmala himself confesses "we know too little, if anything" (H. Kosmala, "The 'Bloody Husband,'" pp. 20-21). 22 Rashbam ultimately concludes that it was Moses' feet, but his explanation is almost provocative: "I do not want to interpret that she touched the angels legs, for who knows whether she saw the angel's legs?"</page><page sequence="7">Hebrew Studies 48 (2007) 45 Hays: "Lest Ye Perish" By and large, the Sages' approach to circumcision is synchronie (i.e., the law is always in effect) or narrative (i.e., the law of circumcision has already been given in Genesis 17, and Moses' parents are L?vites, so he ought to know the law). But if one assumes, with the "modern midrashists" of source criticism, that J is prior to P, and that Genesis 17 is P, then one has a more difficult task, because Exod 4:24-26 may not have had anything to do with the law, initially?so what then was the meaning of YHWH's attack and Zipporah's response? Given the available data, we must proceed in reverse fashion, first seeking the sense of Zipporah's deed, and then placing it in its narrative context to consider the meaning of the attack. There seem to be two aspects of Zipporah's ritual action which may ini tially be considered separately: 1) the act of touching the feet of the divine figure, and 2) the significance of the blood, specifically. If it is the case that Zipporah touches the foreskin to the feet of the Lord, what would this mean? One needs to find a cognate action. Arguably, the feet of the Lord were rather central to Israelite worship: In the Israelite tem ple, God was envisioned as seated on a cherubim throne, for which the ark of the covenant was a footstool (cf. 1 Chr 28:2; Pss 99:5; 132:7).23 T. C. Vriezen argues that the feet of the Lord were central to the Day of Atone ment ritual in Leviticus 16, particularly the applications of blood described in Lev 16:14-15: The sprinkling of blood upon the kapporet, which takes the place of the ark (in old Israel considered as the throne of Jahwe, as the place where God was thought to be living, invisible but really present) may be explained as a pre senting of the blood to Jahwe Himself.... The God being considered sitting on the ark (throne), precisely the eastern part of the ark [where the blood was to be sprinkled] must have been regarded as the place just before his feet.24 Indeed, this may have been the place of his feet. Nor would it be entirely surprising to find Israelite rituals that involved interaction with the anatomy of the deity, since various rituals in ancient Semitic cultures seem to have involved touching the statue of a god. Devotional practices may have in volved holding or kissing divine images,25 and the Akkadian verb lap?tu? the equivalent of the Hebrew itti which is found in Exod 4:25?appears fre quently in the phrase tam? qaqqad ilisunu lapt?, literally "they have touched 23 The image of the curtain around the Holy of Holies as the hem of the Lord's robe may be noted in Isaiah 6.

Of course, unlike most of their neighbors, the ancient Israelites did not have a statue of their deity seated in their temple. The use of the ark (and cherubim) to mark the place of God would have been an adjustment to this fact. The sprinkling of blood at the feet of the Lord in Leviticus 16 may shed light on Zipporah's action. Jacob Milgrom perceives the ritual primarily as one of purgation, or cleansing, for the temple, but it is also more than that. Milgrom writes that "initially the purgation rite for the sanctuary was an emergency measure," suiting the theory that "originally this chapter fol lowed upon the deaths of Nadab and Abihu."27 But it is the very continuity from the end of Leviticus 10 to chapter 16 that makes the instructions of chapter 16 look rather different. Milgrom is correct that this was to be "an emergency measure," but we could add that it is also a rite intended to pro tect Aaron when he entered the Holy of Holies. Aaron's sons "drew near be fore the Lord" and were consumed; that is the "emergency" that provokes the measures of chapter 16, and that context is specifically recalled at the beginning of the chapter. It is not simply that "Nadab and Abihu had pol luted the sanctuary doubly" so that it had to be purged;28 the rituals that fol low are intended to protect Aaron from the danger of being near the Lord: Aaron "is not to come at will into the Shrine behind the curtain, in front of the cover that is upon the ark, lest he die; for I appear in the cloud over the cover. Thus only shall Aaron enter the Shrine" (Lev 16:2). The "emergency" is primarily the apparent danger of proximity to the divine. Ancient Near Eastern apotropaic texts include ritual actions similar to those of Leviticus 16, for example the Mesopotamian namburb? texts, which include both spoken incantations and action rubrics.29 These actions include sevenfold sprinkling akin to the Day of Atonement rite (cf. Lev 16:14, 19), and painting the doors with various substances in order to ward off evil, in much the same fashion as the Hebrews do with the blood of the paschal lamb in Exodus 12 for protection from the Destroyer. The Mesopotamian rituals do not involve blood, but the sacrificial aspects of the Day of Atone 26 I. J. Gelb, et al. Assyrian Dictionary of the University of Chicago. Vol. 50.

Al though there are conflicting testimonies in the Hebrew Bible concerning the efficacy of sacrifice, there are at least strata of theology in which it is seen to earn the protection of God in times of distress: The LORD answer you in the day of trouble! The name of the God of Jacob protect you! May he send you help from the sanctuary, and give you support from Zion. May he remember all your offerings, and regard with favor your burnt sacrifices. (Ps 20:2-4 [Heb.])30 Throughout the ancient Near East, misfortune was often associated with sin, and in Israel, sacrifice was a prominent way of removing sin (Leviticus 4-5, etc.). Can these animal sacrifices be justly compared to Zipporah's circumci sion, however? Perhaps so, since animals were not the only ones sacrificed to the gods in the ancient world. Jon Levenson's The Death and Resurrec tion of the Beloved Son contains one of the most complete and cogent state ments of the idea that children, too, were seen as desirable for sacrifice in many cultures, and that even in Israelite culture, child sacrifice was practiced at least on the fringes or in extremis. The stories of Abraham and Isaac, or Jephthah and his daughter are only the most striking of the biblical passages that acknowledge the practice in Israel's world, at least in times of peril. God praises Abraham for his willingness, saying, "now I know that you fear God, since you have not withheld your son, your favored one, from Me" (Gen 22:12). Even where child sacrifice is practiced by enemies to the detriment of Israel, its power is not doubted, as when Mesha, king of Moab, performs it (2 Kgs 3:26-27). Levenson's point is not that child sacrifice was widespread in (or char acteristic of) Israel.31 Rather, it is that human sacrifice came to be sublimated in other practices. Among these, the most obvious is animal sacrifice?as in Genesis 22, for example, where Isaac is replaced by a ram. Furthermore, Levenson tentatively concludes that circumcision is another "sublimation of child sacrifice." Therefore, he sees Exod 4:24-26 as a precursor to Pass 30 An analogous case may be seen in the Ugaritic hitpu-sac??cQ, which typically involved rams or goats.

The application of the blood has the same apotropaic value: "The blood of circumcision functions within the larger redacted story of Moses and Pharaoh as a prototype of the blood of the lamb."33 In claiming this, Levenson is not out on a limb alone. Rather, he stands within a long history of Jewish scholarship. The Targum Neofiti to Exod. 12:13 says that the blood of circumcision was applied to the doorposts and lintels of the Israelites along with the blood of the lamb at the first Pass over.34 In the Mekhilta, there is a midrash on the dual form of "blood" in Ezekiel 16:6 (Y.jpna) which seeks to answer the question: How were the Israelites delivered from Egypt when they had done nothing to merit it? Mekilta to Exod 12:6 says: "The Holy One, Blessed be He, assigned them two duties, the duty of the paschal sacrifice and the duty of circumcision, which they should perform so as to be worthy of redemption" (Pesah. 5). And so by these "two bloods" they were redeemed. In the Pirqe Rabbi Eliezer, this line of thought reaches full flower: The Israelites took the blood of the covenant of circumcision, and they put (it) upon the lintel of their houses, and the Holy One, blessed be He, passed over to plague the Egyptians, He saw the blood of the covenant of circumcision upon the lintel of their houses and the blood of the Paschal lamb, He was filled with compassion on Israel, as it is said, "And when I passed by you, and saw you flailing about in your blood(s), I said to you, 4In your blood(s), live'; Yea, I said to you, 'In your blood(s), live.'" "In your blood" is not written here, but "in your bloods," with twofold blood, the blood of the covenant of circumcision and the blood of the paschal lamb; therefore it is said, "I said to you, 'In your blood(s), live'; Yea, I said to you, 'In your blood(s), live.'"35 Although one would not expect any connection of circumcision to child sacrifice at the point in history at which the Pirqe Rabbi Eliezer was com piled,36 the passage still indicates the great weight that the apotropaic power of the blood of circumcision was accorded in the rabbinic tradition. Nor was it only at the Passover that such blood had atoning/protecting power: since I have associated Zipporah's action with the sacrifice of the Day of Atone ment, I note with interest the further claim of Pirqe Rabbi Eliezer: 33 J. D. Levenson, The Death and Resurrection, pp. 50-51. 341 am intrigued by the statement of Mek., Amalek 113-114: "R. Nehemiah says: 'Great is circumcision, for it sets aside the laws concerning plagues.'" It seems to me that this may be another indication that the blood of circumcision was placed on the doors and caused the Israelites to be spared the final plague. 35 Pirqe Rabbi Eliezer (trans. G. Friedlander; London: Kegan Paul, Trench, Trubner, 1916), p. 210. 36 James Kugel concludes that the work may not have been completed until the eighth or ninth century, but probably contains earlier materials (J. Kugel, Traditions of the Bible: A Guide to the Bible as It was at the Start of the Common Era [Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1998], p. 933).</page><page sequence="11">Hebrew Studies 48 (2007) 49 Hays: "Lest Ye Perish" Know then that on the Day of Atonement, Abraham our father was circum cised. Every year the Holy One, blessed be He, sees the blood of our father Abraham's circumcision, and He forgives all the sins of Israel, as it is said, "For on this day shall atonement be made for you, to cleanse you" (Lev 16:30).37 In other words, just as the blood of Zipporah's son is a prototype of the blood of the lamb, so Abraham's blood is a prototype of the blood of the bull and goat. Therefore one element?one valence of meaning?of the touching of the child's blood to the feet of the deity is its vicarious sacrificial value. Rashbam wrote that Zipporah's action could be understood "like the sacri fices offered by Gideon and Manoah [each of whom feared for his life] after an angel appeared to them." The final great mystery of the text opens up another vein of interpretation for Zipporah's ritual. "Surely you are a o^OT-jnn to me." The phrase CT/p^rjnq, unattested elsewhere in the Bible, has inspired no fewer interpretations than the passage's other "bumps." The earliest transla tion, the Old Greek, simply removes the phrase and puts in its place, e a a e a , literally, "the blood of my son's circumcision stands." What exactly this might mean has proved sus ceptible to multiple interpretations,38 but it is surely directed at the angel, since she falls at the angel's feet before she speaks. That was also the con clusion of the Targumim, although they vary in the details. A Targum frag ment from the Cairo Genizah explains, "The bridegroom [i.e., Moses] wanted to perform the circumcision, but his father-in-law did not permit him," whereas Onkelos offers: "On account of this circumcision let my husband be given (back) to me." The Talmuds each record both Moses and the child as possible referents of jnn (b. Ned. 32B, y. Ned. 3), while later interpreters were much more likely to assign the title jnn to Moses (Exod. Rab., Rashi, Rashbam). 37 PirqeR. EL, p. 204. 38 Does the blood stop flowing? Does it "stand out" visibly? A third option is that the Greek translator could have intended in the sense of'stand firm' (cf. Liddell-Scott definition, B.II.2). Akkadian was still in use in the third century B.C.E.; could the translator have been aware of the Akkadian verb hat?nu 'to protect'??"The blood of my son protectsV Consider the continuing use of Akkadian into the Seleucid rule of Babylonia in bilingual inscriptions, etc. (S.

The boy is certainly not the latter to Zipporah. Although various interpreters since Ibn Ezra have tried to argue, based on cognates in later Semitic languages (primarily classical Arabic), that "bridegroom" is a technical term of sorts for any boy who undergoes circumcision,39 these theories are not entirely satisfying for this text if it is as ancient as the Yahwistic source. For these reasons, most modern interpreters, insofar as they claim to un derstand the text, have followed the majority of the medievals and concluded that Moses is the jnn to Zipporah, albeit with some hand-wringing over the fact that they are not newly wedded, as the term usually implies. A reca pitulation of these attempts to explain Moses as "bridegroom" is beyond the scope of this project. A summary of early- to mid-twentieth century inter pretations may be found in Childs's commentary,40 and a more updated accounting in Propp's article and commentary.41 Given their greater proximity to the ancient world and its practices, the versions' idea that Zipporah is speaking to YHWH seems worth reconsider ing, even though this line of interpretation is strictly forbidden by Propp: "In no sense is Yahweh Zipporah's h?t?n?unless we concoct a bizarre theory of hier os gamos [priestly marriage]."42 In fact, Shemaryahu Talmon has ar gued something similar to that, claiming that when Zipporah says to Moses, h DTP^'jnn, h is short for mrrb. So in Talmon's view, Moses is a bridegroom to the Lord through the ritual she performs. There is no textual support for this emendation, and Kosmala rightly objects that a portrayal of YHWH as bride is unlikely. However, Talmon's interpretation does evoke a theory that may be helpful for interpretation: the idea of the Divine Kins 39 Compare J. Wellhausen, Prolegomena to the History of Ancient Israel (Eugene, Ore.: Wipf and Stock, 2003), p. 340; M. Greenberg, Understanding Exodus (New York: Behrman House, 1969), p. 114 n. 2. 40 B. Childs, The Book of Exodus, p. 101. 41 W. H. Propp, Exodus 1-18, pp. 233-240; (cf. also "That Bloody Bridegroom") Propp's interpretation is quite good. He says, in short, that Moses is a "bridegroom of bloodshed" because he still bears the bloodguilt from killing the Egyptian overseer. He has fled to a city of refuge in Midian, and can return after the Pharaoh's death much as Israelite murderers could return after the death of the high priest. Zipporah calls him jnn because it is only at this moment that she realizes she has married a murderer. The problem with his theory is that J precedes the law texts. Propp, to his credit, realizes this. He says: "My assumption is that the Yahwist's original readers were steeped in the general principles of guilt and retribution embodied in a refined form in the legal codes" (W. H. Propp, "That Bloody Bridegroom," p. 505). But to project the laws back onto this text with such specificities as cities of refuge and the high priesthood?Propp should concede that his reading is a sort of modern midrash (to which I now add another). 42 W. H. Propp, "That Bloody Bridegroom," p. 502.</page><page sequence="13">Hebrew Studies 48 (2007) 51 Hays: "Lest Ye Perish" man. Wrote Philip King and Lawrence Stager: "The king...does not repre sent the apex of this [Israelite] societal model; rather it is Yahweh...who is the supreme patrimonial lord. He is the ultimate patrimonial authority over the children of Israel, who are bound to him through covenant as his kindred (cam) or kindred-in-law."43 It is necessary to consider the possibility that jnn is not being used here in a familiar or "natural" sense. In fact, this is also Propp's starting point: "the qualifiers d?m?m...md //...suggest Zipporah is using h?t?n in a new or un usual way, in which case the term might mean anything."44 Since the basic sense of the root jnn is simply "to become related by marriage,"45 with vari ous vowels and endings, it can mean "father-in-law," "son-in-law," "bride groom," "wedding," or "mother-in-law." Koehler-Baumgartner suggests the relatively abstract translation "related by marriage" for one usage, in 2 Kgs 8:27. Adding to the intrigue is the Samaritan Targum's reading hm in Aramaic, as if it had understood jnn 'father-in-law' in the Hebrew. Indeed, in this period we must reckon with the oral transmission of pronunciation? there was nothing in the text to discredit either reading. Once one realizes that 1) jnn may imply a more abstract relationship-by-marriage than diction ary definitions suggest; and 2) it need not even be pointed ~jnn, then the question is open again: in what way could YHWH be related to Zipporah? Frank Cross has recently emphasized the theological importance of ancient notions of kinship, writing: "In the religious sphere, the intimate re lationship with the family god, the 'God of the Fathers,' was expressed in the only language available to the members of a tribal society. Their god was the Divine Kinsman."46 Cross notes that the idea is "especially vivid" in theophorus West Semitic names. He runs through a list of these, some of which are familiar, such as 'father', in biblical names such as bw2$ (El is my father, 1 Sam 9:1). Others are not as familiar because they are attested in inscriptions rather than biblical literature. One of these, Cross notes, is "the more bizarre ham, 'father-in-law,' which survives in Hebrew and Ammonite as an element in feminine names."47 He does not say why he thinks ham is bizarre; is it not possible that a female who was adopted or married into a new family with different gods might adopt a new name with this element in 43 P.

Or are the various re-namings in the Bible that mark major life changes (Abraham, Sarah, Jacob, Naomi, Hosea's children) purely literary devices that do not reflect any socio-historical reality? The objection may be raised that a name for God such as ''p-rjnn (or ^"jnn) is attested nowhere else. And would Zipporah, of all people, have been accorded the right to name God? In this connection, one should re member Hagar, who felt her life to be threatened by God's presence, and who named the LORD who spoke to her, "You are El-roi" Another foreign woman, another strange encounter, another divine name that is a hapax. Furthermore, both passages are attributed to J.48 If we allow that Zipporah may be saying, "You are kin to me by blood," as she applies the blood to the feet of YHWH, what would that mean? It would mean her inclusion in the family. Cross goes on to cite the following passage from W. Robertson Smith's Kinship and Marriage in Early Arabia: [A] covenant of alliance and protection was based on an oath. Such an oath was necessarily a religious act; it is called [qas?ma]...a word which almost certainly implies that there was a reference to the god at the sanctuary before the alliance was sealed, and that he was made party to the act.... We see that two groups might make themselves of one blood by a process of which the essence was that they commingled their blood, at the same time applying the blood to the god or fetish so as to make him a party to the covenant also. Quite similar is the ritual in Exodus 24 where the blood is applied to the people of Israel and to the altar.49 Cross argues that such employment of oath and covenant was "a widespread legal means by which the duties and privileges of kinship may be extended to another individual or group."50 Through this ritual, Zipporah claims her family's relationship to the Divine Kinsman, YHWH. (It is, in fact, a neat play on words: D^'jnri is an oxymoron, since in-laws are not related by blood, yet through the blood ritual she has become related to the Lord.) Zipporah's performative utterance is also reminiscent of Ruth's oath to her mother-in-law that "your God will be my God" (Ruth 1:16). Her words are both reminder and protection, much as Moses has to remind YHWH of his nori in Numbers 14 so that he will not destroy the people. 48 A. F. Campbell and M.

It could be created. A member of the family could accept a stranger into his house hold or tribe by concluding with him a covenant.... It is as if the newcomer C'y shares in some sort the same blood." Still, there may be some relationship between this text's ritual and that of the Mosaic covenant: perhaps a common cultural tradition. Much as the blood of bulls is dashed on the altar and the people in Exodus 24 to mark the covenant, so in Exodus 4 the child's blood is touched to the feet of the deity, envisioned as resting upon the cover of the ark.53 Thus the blood of the circumcision of Zipporah's son functions not only as a (sublimated) sacri fice, but as a marker of the covenant?that is, the relationship?between God and his people. Having filled some of the gaps, let us attempt a new "translation"?one that in its interpretive freedom is more akin to the Targumim: 24 While Moses was on the way to Egypt with his wife and sons, they stopped for the night at a camping-place. There, the LORD came upon Moses and sought to kill him.25 But Zipporah took a flint and cut off the foreskin of her son. She touched it to feet of the LORD and spoke these words: "Surely you are a blood relative to me." 26 And the LORD remembered his promises to his people, and withdrew from the family. Thus Zipporah marked her family as kin to the Lord by blood, by means of circumcision. 51 That is, I do not intend to argue for the antiquity of an Israelite national covenant in the manner of Eichrodt or Mendenhall (see reviews of the modern study of covenant in R. A. Oden, Jr. "The Place of Covenant in the Religion of Israel" in Ancient Israelite Religion: Essays in Honor of F. M. Cross [Philadelphia: Fortress, 1987], pp. 429-447; or E. W. Nicholson, God and His People: Covenant and Theology in the Old Testament [Oxford: Clarendon, 1986]). I merely mean to observe again how much the language of kinship informs diverse relationships in the ancient Near East, including the divine-human relationship; cf. J. D. Schloen, The House of the Father as Fact and Symbol: Patrimonialism in Ugarit and the Ancient Near East (Winona Lake, Ind.: Eisenbrauns, 2001); also D. A. Smith, "Kinship and Covenant in Hosea 11:1-4," HBT 16 (1994): 41-53. 52 P. Kalluveettill, Declaration and Covenant: A Comprehensive Review of Covenant Formulae from the Old Testament and the Ancient Near East (Rome: Biblical Institute Press, 1982), p. 205. Mark S. Smith (to whom I owe the reference to Kalluveettill) has recently demonstrated a familial covenant between Ruth and Naomi: "'Your People Shall Be My People': Family and Covenant in Ruth 1:16-17," CBQ 69 (2007): 242 258. 53 Despite their frequent association, the ark may well have preceded the covenant; cf. C. L. Seow, "Ark of the Covenant," ABD 1:386-393. Furthermore, along with Knohl, Milgrom and others, I perceive in the source at least a significant early stratum. Thus this motif of the footstool may be early as well.</page><page sequence="16">Hebrew Studies 48 (2007) 54 Hays: "Lest Ye Perish" If one steps back again to survey the wider landscape, Moses' journey back to Egypt may be seen as a journey closer to God?closer to the won ders that constituted Israel, but also closer to danger. The encounter "on the way" is a reminder that it is dangerous to be close to God. And this is neither a coincidence nor a contradiction. Readers who do not perceive this in the canon will miss the menace of God's words in Lev 10:3: "Through those who are near me I will show myself holy." The threat of God's holi ness is also clear when the people come to Sinai and are warned: "Set limits around the mountain and keep it holy...otherwise [the LORD] will break out against them" (Exod 19:23-24). The monotheistic thought of ancient Israel greatly muted the demonology of the surrounding cultures; very few Hebrew interpreters?in the biblical period or later?allowed themselves the luxury that the author of Jubilees did, to assign the attack on Moses simply to a devil (Mastema; Jub. 48:1). The function of Exod 4:21-23 (in its narrative context) is to remind Moses of what was affirmed so often in Genesis: that the Lord who is the God of life may also threaten life. He gave it to the patriarchs in the form of child birth, yet required acknowledgment of his gifts; his command that Abraham sacrifice Isaac was such a test. Despite his covenant with Abraham, YHWH asked the same of him that he asked of Pharaoh: that he recognize his lord ship over life. And for each of them, it was a costly recognition. The more broadly one looks at the Hebrew Bible, the more this unsparing equity appears characteristic: God can be just as dangerous to those who are with him as those who are against him. The encounters of Isaac (Genesis 22) and Jacob (Genesis 32) have often been cited in this regard. One could also mention Job, who suffers despite being the servant and pride of God; or the prophets, who often suffered precisely because they delivered the word of God. The story of YHWH's attack on Moses undermines theologies that seek to tame God's incomprehensible aspects, or to keep God safely "on our side" (cf. Josh 5:13-14). God's ways may sometimes be so different from human reason (Isa 55:8) as to seem wild or demonic, but these too are faces of the divine. In conclusion, reading with the ancient exegetes cited is not only fruitful for theology, but also opens up an array of fresh possibilities for scholarship in the present day. It is useful to understand Exod 4:24-26 against the ancient Near Eastern background of ritual practices and kinship relations. In this context, Zipporah's action can be understood as an apotropaic blood rite that invokes her family's kinship to Yahweh, the Divine Kinsman.</page></plain_text>
