<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE POST-CONTACT ORIGIN OF AN AMERICAN INDIAN HIGH GOD: THE SUPPRESSION OF FEMININE SPIRITUALITY by Jordan Paper Introduction' T HE QUESTION OF whether or not there was an aboriginal high god in the Americas has continuously reflected European ideological concerns. The late nineteenth century theories propounding an evo- lution of religion, with Christianity placed at the pinnacle of human development, were countered by Andrew Lang followed by Father Wilhelm Schmidt who, in his Ursprung der Gottesidee (1912), proposed a naive and pure monotheism at the very beginning of human culture. Each side utilized American Indian examples to bolster its argument. Those sympathetic with Native Americans tended to reflect Schmidt's views and assume a "primitive" monotheism as the basis of American Indian religions. American students of Native American cultures tended to avoid the controversy and concentrate on specific ethnological in- stances, usually finding the high god a reflection of missionary influence. W. J. McGee (1897: 182) early on pointed to "the popular fallacy concerning the aboriginal 'Great Spirit' " as an "erroneous interpre- tation" of the Siouan term wakanda: "Among these tribes the creation and control of the world and the things thereof are ascribed to 'wa- kan-da', just as among the Algonquin tribes omnipotence was assigned to 'ma-ni-do'; yet inquiry shows that wakanda assumes various forms, and is rather a quality than a definite quantity". (McGee's linguistic analysis is to be distinguished from simplistic evolutionist positions; e.g., William Jones [1905]). Alanson Skinner (1913: 79) thought in reference to the Algonkin Menomini, "Probably the sun was originally the head of the Powers above and Mati Haiwit ik [Great Spirit] is but a modern development of the old idea, through missionary influence." Frank Speck (1977/1935: 28-29) developed the same understanding in regard to the Algonkin Montagnais-Naskapi beliefs: "To the influence of missionary priests, I am now inclined to believe, may be attributed the concept of an anthropomorphic supreme deity-the historic and often discussed Tcetcimantti, 'Great Power,' commonly interpreted as 'Great Spirit.' " (Paul Radin, the eminent scholar of Amerindian religion, 1</page><page sequence="2">2 AMERICAN INDIAN QUARTERLY, FALL 1983 rejected the concept of primitive monotheism after decades of upholding it [Bidney, 1960: 363] "due to his adoption of an evolutionary point of view."). After more than a half century of debate, one would have thought the issue had since faded away. However, in the relatively recent English translation of The Religion of the American Indians by Ake Hultkrantz (1979: 22), the foremost scholar of Native American religions, we find an assumption of a high god in the religions of aboriginal North America: "The Algonkin single out one of these spirits as 'The Great Spirit' (Kitchi-Manitou) or simply 'The Spirit' (Manitou), specifying the Supreme Being ... Algonkin theism is undoubtedly pre-Christian- the first missionaries in New France mention it-and it is presumably archaic .... " Hultkrantz (1981/71: 21) is not assuming Schmidt's po- sition; he seeks to fill the gap between the concept of primeval mono- theism and the lack of one. This paper is my attempt not only to lay the controversy to rest, but to analyze the means by which high god concepts developed in Native American religions following contact with and eventual dom- ination by European culture. It will be demonstrated that a high god could develop out of the concept of manito given two major ideological changes in Algonkin cultures. The first change derives from an aware- ness of and eventual subordination to a culture with a hierarchical social structure including a supreme ruler; and the second, from a shift in the concept of feminine spiritual powers and the role of women in society. It will be argued that the influence of male oriented Christian missionaries, of the Old Testament creation myths, and of later control of Natives by a patriarchal socio-political order led to the excision of the female from the aboriginal concept of an equality between complementary female and male spiritual powers. My approach to this issue is perhaps different from others in that it does not embody Western theistic values. As a student of East Asian religions for a quarter of a century, I am familiar with nonmonotheistic high civilizations, with cultures without the Western emphasis on linear time beginning with creation, and with religions in which theistic formulations can clearly be seen to evolve with the sociopolitical structure. Given the probable existence of circumpolar concepts-for example, Hallowell (1926) on bear ceremonialism and Erkes (1926) on the sun-shooting myth-it did not surprise me to find Native Amer- ican theistic concepts closer to those of North China than to those of the Eastern Mediterranean. The specific methodologies utilized in the study are those of eth- nohistory, as used by Hultkrantz in "The Problem of Christian Influence on Northern Algonkian Eschatology" (1980), and religioecology, an</page><page sequence="3">PAPER: THE SUPPRESSION OF FEMININE SPIRITUALITY 3 approach pioneered by Hultkrantz. As a classical sinologist, I was given rigorous training in the critical analysis of texts. I have found this methodology pertinent to the analysis of such documents as the Jesuit Relations and to the analysis of the content and context of recorded oral texts. The study will primarily be limited to one linguistic family, Al- gonkin,2 with reference to other contiguous cultures. The Algonkin linguistic family included a large number of cultures, ranging from hunting-gathering groups to those of mixed economy, covering a large part of aboriginal North America; these cultures include those with which I have the greatest familiarity. Before proceeding with this essay, one point should be emphasized. This paper, in part, is a theoretical study of a hypothetical construct: aboriginal American religion. It is not meant to refer to contemporary religious concepts. In the latter regard, I consider the words of Father Verne Dusenberry (1962: 232) to be the most apropos: "And it seems irrelevant to worry whether the Kitchi Manitou is indigenous with the Algonquian Cree or whether it is the result of European influence. The significant thing is that these Cree believe, as did their immediate forebears, the Ki-sei-men'-to is their High God ... ." The Transformation of Algonkin Religion I: Historical Documents The Jesuit Relations: A major reason for Algonkin religion being propounded as a model for precontact religion is that we have relatively extensive records of the culture at the time of contact by educated Europeans: the Jesuit missionaries. However, it must be understood that the Relations do not embody disinterested ethnological studies but were written to engender European support for the Jesuits' activities. To this end, the Relations tend to approach the Native Americans from two extreme perspectives, seeing them either as barbarous, savage heathens or as naturally-enlightened children, predisposed to the teachings of the true religion. The Jesuits, of course, were not free of their own cultural predispositions: they focused on that which met their own religious understanding and were often blind to that which did not. For example, they were unable to perceive the feminine aspects of Native religion, most notably that of matrilinial Iroquoian cultures. For these reasons, all statements in the Relations regarding deities cannot be accepted as ipso facto valid. Rather, those statements that indicate the authors' awareness of differences between Native cultures or of European influence, or that accord with later ethnographic data concerning concepts which could not be European-derived are more likely to be of ethnological value.</page><page sequence="4">4 AMERICAN INDIAN QUARTERLY, FALL 1983 The earliest specific Jesuit mention of deity is that of Biard of 1616 (JR: III, 133): "They believe in a God, so they say; but they cannot call him by any name except that of the Sun, Niscaninous.. ." The Sun was not the sole deity of the Souriquois (Micmacs), but, as Bailey (1969: 134, ft. 44) has written: "Due to its commanding position, brilliance and beneficial power it was felt as the chief repository of manito, or the vehicle of the most powerful supernatural being in nature." Biard frequently refers to sacrifices to "Devils," as he termed the manitos. Jouvency a few years earlier refers to individual, animal protecting spirits from puberty vision-quests as deities and, confused, understands manito to refer to a feared "author of evil" (JR: I, 287). This influenced Euro-American understanding of the term for the next three centuries. In the early seventeenth century, the Jesuits in Acadia were already aware of European influence on Native religion. In the Relation of Latemont to Jerome in 1627 (JR: IV, 201), we find: "They call the Sun Jesus; and it is believed that the Basques, who formerly frequented these places, introduced the name." This influence from the European fishing industry preceded this Relation by a century (Upton, 1979: 18); and, it is to be noted, a major change in religious terminology was effected from tenuous commercial contact rather than from contact with missionaries. In regard to the present essay's thesis, Bailey (1969: 34) found, after a thorough search, that "The belief in this 'higher force,' of which Jenness [1932] speaks, does not, so far as I am aware, appear in any of the explorer's accounts of the seventeenth century or in any report of field work among the eastern Algonkians." Moving to central Algonkin cultures, the Relations of 1648 (JR: XXXIII, 227), in referring to the Ondataouaouat (Odawa) near the Huron (in present-day central Ontario), noted, without realizing it, the aboriginal dualistic Earth-Sky complex: "They also throw tobacco in the fire, offering it by name to the Genie who has created the Sky, whom they believe to be different from the one who has created the earth."3 Although the emphasis on a creator is clearly Jesuit (see following), the observation is perceptive in that the Jesuits were, in a sense, programmed not to notice the feminine Earth parallel to the masculine Sky. The lack of a high-god concept is confirmed by Allouez in 1666-67 (JR:, L, 285 &amp; 289-90), who compares this lack among the Odawa with Algonkin cultures to the south, where he believes a high god is present: The savages of these regions [Outaouacs, etc.] recognize no sovereign master of Heaven and Earth, but believe there are many spirits.... I have learned that the Iliniouek, the Outagami and other Savages towards</page><page sequence="5">PAPER: THE SUPPRESSION OF FEMININE SPIRITUALITY 5 the South, hold that there is a great and excellent genius, master of all the rest, who made Heaven and Earth; and who dwells they say, in the East, toward the country of the French. Whether the Sun was a high god even among the Mississippian-in- fluenced Illinois and Miami is open to question, although this is clearly implied, but Allouez's comparative perspective certainly clarifies the situation among the Odawa. A few years later, in 1671, we have the first documentary evidence for an important and far-reaching shift in Native religious formulation from a Relation (JR: IV, 215) written by Dablon (who lived among the Illinois): "... . worshiped only the Sun. But, when they are instructed in the truths of our Religion, they will speedily change this worship and render it to the Creator of the Sun, as some have already begun to do." Two years later, we have a second documentation (JR: LVIII, 275) for direct Jesuit influence on Algonkin religion: When I arrived among them at the end of 1673 ... they [the Menomini of present-day Wisconsin] believed that the sun was the master of life and of fishing, the dispenser of all things.... After disabusing them of the idea which they had of the sun, and explaining to them in a few words the principles of our faith, I asked them whether they would consent to my removing the picture of the sun, and replacing it by the image of Jesus crucified. They replied, all together and repeatedly, that they consented; and that they believed God was the master of all things ... [following the appearance of sturgeon the next morning,] all said to me: "Now we see very well that the spirit who has made all is the one who feeds us...." In this probably exaggerated narrative of Father Andr6, we should note that among the Menomini the Sun was not a sole high god, but the chief of the powers above; creation came equally from grandmother Earth, as will be pointed out below. The shift in the minds of the Menomini seems not so much from Sun to Jesus but to a spirit above "who has made us all." In the same year, we have a description of the Illinois pipe ritual of importance to later discussion. Father Marquette (1724: II, 314) observed: "At times he presents it to the company and turns it from side to side, then he offers it to the sun as though he wished him to smoke it; at other times he inclines it towards the earth." The seventeenth-century Jesuit missionaries utilized an approach diametrically opposed to that of other orders. In China, this difference led to the Rites Controversy which lasted over a century, a conflict the Jesuits ultimately lost in Europe. The method is described by</page><page sequence="6">6 AMERICAN INDIAN QUARTERLY, FALL 1983 Bowden (1981: 84): "Instead of condemning existing cultures outright, they tried to build on common denominators and gradually reshaped native ways toward closer approximation of a Christian norm." In this regard, the Jesuits were eminently successful in North America. Since the late seventeenth century, it has been normative to attach the Judeo-Christian concept of creation to either the sun, the sky, or a combination of the two among the Natives of northern North America, including all the Algonkin cultures. Eighteenth- and Nineteenth-Century Reports: It is not until the beginning of the eighteenth century that we find the first references to kitchemanito, the Algonkin "high god." Baron de Lahontan writes in a 1703 (1905/1703: II, 448-49) publication that "Old men made their Harangues address'd to the Kitchi Manitou, and present him from time to time with Pipes of Tabacco Lighted at the Sun . . . Great Spirit, Master of our Lives .... " Pachot (Kinietz 1977/1940: 213) wrote, "The Illinois call him Kitchemanitoa which means the spirit master of life; the Outavois call him the same as the Illinois with a little different pronunciation." However, even as late as the end of the eighteenth century, an Englishman (Long, 1791: 7) assumed the term was a Jesuit invention: "Their [Cahnuago: Iroquoian] religion is Catholic, and they have a French priest, or as the Chippeway [Ojibwa] term it, 'The Master of Life's Man' [Kitchemanito's man]." Long (1791: 28-29) also relates stories of Natives who have extensive knowledge of the Bible. However, awareness of Algonkin religion in the eighteenth century was still confused, as in a 1761 (de Charlevoix, cited in Axtell, 1981: 82-83) publication in which Nanabozo (or Nan- bush), the Algonkin culture hero, was perceived as a monotheistic deity: "Nothing is more certain than that the Indians of the continent have an idea of a supreme Being. ... Almost all the nations of Algonquin language, give this sovereign Being the appellation of the great Hare .... " This misperception reflects the "Great Hare" of Perrot (cited in Blair, 1911: I, 59) a century earlier: "The savages-I mean those who were not converted-recognize as principal divinities only the Great Hare, the sun and devils [manitos]." In the following century, kitchemanito, the missionary translation for God, had been fully integrated into Native religion as three mid- nineteenth century works make clear. G. Copway (Kahgegagahbowk), an Ojibwa leader, who as a youth was initiated into the Midewiwin and later became a Christian, writes (1850: 132) of an Ojibwa "Torah": These records are written on slate-rock, copper, lead, and on the back of birch-trees. The record is said to be a transcript of what the Great Spirit</page><page sequence="7">PAPER: THE SUPPRESSION OF FEMININE SPIRITUALITY 7 gave to the Indian after the flood, and by the hands of wise men have been transmitted to other parts of the country ever since. Here is a code of moral laws which, the Indian calls, "A path made by the Great Spirit." In Copway's history, one finds that Jesuits were among the Ojibwa along Lake Superior by 1641 (p. 206), and Methodist missionaries were among the Ojibwa in Southern Ontario by 1824 (p. 177). William Warren (1957: 63-64), in a series of newspaper articles published in Minneapolis between 1850 and 1853, wrote: ... the fact of their [Ojibways] firm belief and great veneration, in an overruling Creator and Master of Life, has been noticed by all who have had close intercourse with them since their earliest discovery. It is true that they believe in a multiplicity of spirits which pervade all nature, yet all these are subordinate to the one Great Spirit of good. .... Ke-che- mun-e-do (Great Spirit) is the name used by the Ojibways for the being equivalent to our God. Kohl (1956: 49), a German traveler, wrote the following concerning the Ojibwa in an 1860 publication: "The name of Kichi-Manitou (the Great or Good Spirit) was ... repeatedly heard, and constant allusions made to his 'mercies and gifts....' " The integration of Christian concepts with Native religion con- tinued well into the twentieth century, especially by Native religious leaders who had a Christian education (missionaries controlled most of the Indian schools) and continued to be active in both modalities. For example, James Redsky (1972: 90), a Midewiwin leader and a Presbyterian elder (Dewdney, 1975: 178-79), wrote: The Ojibways who belong to the Mide-wi-win believe that God made the world and that we, his children, might live the everlasting life. Our great loving Father created this world for us to live in ... In the early days He sent men to come among us and tell us about Him. From these teachings we believe there is a God. This is also how we visualize the power of His almighty word and understand whereby we may have ev- erlasting life. Redsky (p. 94ff.) also conceived of the traditional culture hero ("Nene- bush") as the "devil." The above material documents a sequence of acculturation, an acculturation virtually inevitable given the impact of European culture, at first economic, and then political, that led to rapid and profound changes in Algonkin sociopolitical patterns; i.e., the fur trade and its consequences. The developments that led to the superimposition of European religious concepts on those of Native Americans have been analyzed by a number of scholars (e.g., Upton, 1979: 18-24). Not only</page><page sequence="8">8 AMERICAN INDIAN QUARTERLY, FALL 1983 was there superimposition of concepts as early as the seventeenth century, but in certain areas there was rapid and extensive conversion to Christianity. Some of this missionary activity was actually carried out by Natives on their own initiative (see Bailey, 1969: 127-31). Such superimposition and conversion did not mean the disbelief in native deities but rather the addition of concepts of a supreme deity, of an evil power, and of heaven and hell (see Hultkrantz, 1980). The Transformation of Algonkin Religion II: Specific Cultures Before summarizing the sequence of acculturation, it is useful to discuss cultures and studies frequently cited as evidencing a high god in aboriginal Algonkin cultures. Schmidt (1933: 60ff) considered the Delaware and the southern-plains Algonkin cultures (Arapaho and Cheyenne) as illustrating pure Algonkin concepts, unsullied by the "matrilinial" Iroquois and the "bloodthirsty" Sioux. John Cooper (1934) wrote slightly later an oft-quoted study of the northern Cree, "The Northern Algonquian Supreme Being." Truman Michelson pub- lished studies of Fox oral texts indicative of Native ideology. Analysis of all four cultural configurations utilizing differing methodological approaches will indicate the influence of Christian concepts. The Walam Olum and the Delaware: The Walum Olum, as known from the 1833 manuscript of Con- stantine Rafinesque, is a migration record of the Lenni Lenape (Del- aware), consisting of pictographic symbols to which the recording of oral explanation in Delaware is attached. It was probably collected in one of the Moravian mission towns of Indiana in 1820 (Walum Olum, 1954: 266-8). Often cited as a faithful recording of aboriginal records, William Newcomb (1956: 5) considers it "a product of the Delawares during their phase of revivalistic nativism." This would place the work after the Big House Ceremony, (see Speck, 1931) which Newcomb (p. 64) considers "synthesized during the early decades of the [eight- eenth] century". The beginning of the Walum Olum contains a creation myth (pp. 9-31) attached to migration myths in a manner typical of later nativistic works (e.g., Waters, 1963). That the migration account at one time existed separately is suggested by the account recorded in the late eighteenth century by Heckewelder (first published in Weslager, 1978: 88-90) which begins directly with a migration from the west. The creation material follows a Christian interpretation of Genesis: There at the edge of all the water where the land ends, the fog over the earth was plentiful and there was where the Great Spirit stayed .... He</page><page sequence="9">PAPER: THE SUPPRESSION OF FEMININE SPIRITUALITY 9 created much land here as well as land on the other side of the water. He created the sun and the stars of night.... Then again, the one who is the Great Spirit, a manito, created manitos, and persons who die, and souls for them.... He gave the first mother, mother of persons. He gave fish, turtle, animals, birds. But another powerful manito created powerful men and those water monsters; he created the flies and he created mos- quitoes. Everybody behaved, seeing friends everywhere and was happy, staying with the manitos. But when the snake god, the guardian spirit, the worship snake did things secretly on the continent, he did mean things, he did destructive things, and black deeds came there, bad weather came, killing came, death came.' Here, in Book I, we have the creation of first land, then the heavens, then humans and animals, and the co-creation of evil things by the Devil (elements of the Iroquoian good and evil twins are apparent). Humans lived in an Eden until the snake, identified with personal manitos (considered the Devil by Christian missionaries), did what was forbidden and brought death to the world. Book II (pp. 35-47) provides a truncated version of the typical Algonkin creation myth, the culture-hero combined with the earth-diver motif: Long ago there was a strong snake when men, the big men stayed there.... They were quarrelsome as they lived there: they were lazy and fighting. The strong snake quickly made up his mind about the men: he destroyed possessions of the people; he brought these things, he brought great quantities of water.... Nanabush stayed on Turtle Island: he was a powerful rabbit, the grandfather of people, the grandfather of men. In Book II, the snake is not the serpent of the Eden story, but the water monster that causes the great flood during which Nanabush creates the land (Turtle Island) and saves the people. Nanabush here is not created by the Great Spirit but is conflated with him as the grandfather of all. Although there is a Noah twist with the people being bad before the flood and Nanabush does not explicitly create the land, the essentials of the Nanabush earth-diver myth are present. Hence, as in other, later works, the Genesis-type narrative with the Great Spirit concept is attached to the beginning of the traditional culture-hero mythic material. Cooper on the Northern Cree: Father John Cooper, who accepted Schmidt's understanding of Algonkin religion, produced a study of the northern Cree to supplement Schmidt's view. Cooper's argument is seemingly persuasive. Noting that the Cree were aware that ma'tci manitu (the evil manito) and Kisci' manitu (Great Spirit) only came into use following missionary</page><page sequence="10">10 AMERICAN INDIAN QUARTERLY, FALL 1983 influence,6 their concept of a noncreator Manitu as a single Supreme Being must be aboriginal (Cooper, 1934: 37): "That there is but one Supreme Being is reasonably clear from the evidence." This Supreme Being was even trinitarian, for the one Manitu was appealed to "under three different aspects" (p. 11). Cooper (p. 29 &amp; 53) presents his per- ception of Cree pipe ritual, the holding of the pipe towards the sky, as confirming evidence. He fails to note the complete ritual; e.g., how many pinches of tobacco were placed in the bowl, how many puffs were smoked, was the bowl brought to touch the ground, etc.? In other Algonkin pipe rituals, as already indicated, the stem is offered to the sky as one of six offerings. Cooper (pp. 67-68 &amp; 70) considers Christian influence since 1840 considerable, but negligible before that date. He raises the question himself (p. 70) as to "How could it happen that the Indians of the [Hudson] Bay could be exposed so long-from 1668 up to 1840-to white influence and yet have taken on so little of European religious culture?", which he then proceeds to answer. However, Hultkrantz (1980: 169-70) finds Christian influence already noteworthy in mid-eighteenth century descriptions of the northern Cree.7 In many other Algonkin dialects, manito refers to the plurality of powers, either individually or collectively. The term itself can be grammatically ambiguous. Michelson (1921: 42-43) in his bilingual publication of the Fox Owl Bundle narrative, points to the use of the term in its singular form when a plural meaning is certain. Given the institution of the fur trade with its consequent change in hunting patterns and rituals, the resultant influence of European culture on Native culture, and the distance of the northern Cree from even ru- dimentary horticulture, it is conceivable that the patriarchal Christian culture served to remove the feminine aspect of Algonkin religion. All power was concentrated in the male sky spirit, so similar in that aspect to the Christian concept, and the term manito became a singular word in concept as well as grammar. As there is no evidence that manito was uniquely a singular sky deity among the precontact Cree, it is more logical to see the development as due to Christian influence. That interpretation would coincide with the related development among the Cree's southern neighbors, the Ojibwa. According to Hal- lowell (1960: 44), "The meaning of the term manitu ... may be con- sidered as a synonym for a person of the other-than-human class. Among the Ojibwa I work with it is now generally confined to the God of Christianity, when combined with an augmentative prefix (k'tci manitu). " It is also possible that the very fact of Cooper's being a priest evoked a consistent and particular response among the Cree. In Alanson</page><page sequence="11">PAPER: THE SUPPRESSION OF FEMININE SPIRITUALITY 11 Skinner's earlier recordings of the legends and myths of the overlapping eastern Cree (1911: 112), the only mention of "Great Spirit" is in a story received not directly from Natives, but from the Episcopal mis- sionary at Moose Factory, in an obviously postcontact story concerning why there are different races. The Cheyenne: Among the Cheyenne a similar conceptual transition has taken place, but many other aspects of traditional religion continue. For the Cheyenne, there is available one of the richest descriptions of Native religion, although Peter Powell, the author of Sweet Medicine (1969), is illustrative of a new generation of sympathetic participant- missionaries who are accelerating the process of ideological accul- turation while enhancing the preservation of traditional rituals. In Powell's work, the disjunction between a high god concept and ritual practices is readily apparent. But the high god is not otiose, because offerings and prayers are addressed to it in the ritual, although in a context quite different from theological statements. This disjunction is indicative of acculturation, since, for Native religions in general and for Cheyenne religion in particular, "In religious ceremonies, the rites, not the words are most important (Petter, 1907: 477)." This early twentieth-century observation continues to be valid; for example, among the northern plains Algonkin culture, the Blackfoot, we find this observation: "To the Indian there are no legends, no myths. These are directives, and we understand them without need of explanations. There was a lot more ceremony or action than verbal instructions in Indian activities, like the medicine pipe ceremony. In the Protestant Church there is a lot of verbal direction and less action (Wolf Leg 1979: 5)." Hence, where there is disjunction between ritual and the- ological statements unrelated to ritual, one can reasonably expect the ritual to embody the more traditional aspect and the theology to reflect acculturation. "The Cheyennes believe there is only One who created everything, who created life. The old priests used to tell us, 'There is only one God; but one man was used to bring all good things to the Cheyennes. That man was Sweet Root Standing. He is not Maheo himself. He is the Prophet- not the one true God.' Maheo is the one true God." These are the words of Fire Wolf, the venerable Suhai Buffalo and Sun Dance priest (Powell, 1909: II, 433). Powell (1969: II, 434-35 &amp; 437) adds: Maheo created the Maheyuno, the four Sacred Persons as well as the Maiyun, the Sacred Powers who live above and below the earth. In ritual</page><page sequence="12">12 AMERICAN INDIAN QUARTERLY, FALL 1983 smoking, the Northern Cheyennes first offer the pipe to the Sacred Persons who dwell at the four directions. Then they offer it to Maheo whose home is the heart of the universe. Finally, the mouthpiece is extended downward to Grandmother Earth. The Cheyennes address the Sacred Persons, Maheo, and the Earth by name, asking each to smoke with them. Then the people pray to them, begging for blessings, for health, for abundant food, and for protection of the Cheyennes and their children.... Before each meal a devout Cheyenne offers Niostanivoo, the sacrifice of food to the four directions, above, and below. This ritual equality of the Four Directions, Above and Below, maintains the aboriginal relationship of the sacred powers, apparent in the early recorded description of the calumet ritual, whereas the ritually detached theological statements reflect obvious Christian in- fluence. Native understanding is predominently experiential, i.e., based on visions, rather than theological; the situation is reversed in Euro- American culture. John Stands in Timber (1972/1967: 27-28), Peter Powell's inter- preter and chief informant called Sweet Medicine (Sweet Root Stand- ing) a "savior" and provided him with a virgin birth. John Stands in Timber (1972: 293) was baptized a Catholic in 1896, went to a Pres- byterian school and became a Mennonite in 1916. Powell (1969: I, xxiii-xxiv), an "Anglo Catholic priest," considers a culture worthy of respect to the degree it approximates Christian ideology: "The Church holds that the finest in the pre-Christian religions were, in their way, preparations for God's revelation of Himself in human flesh as Christ." Powell's close relationship with Cheyenne religious leaders is an ex- ample of the continuing means of acculturating Native religions to Euro-American ideology. Ideological acculturation is to be distinguished from material acculturation, which often integrates well with aboriginal ideology; e.g., the Making-the-Blue ceremony (see Powell, 1969: II, 494-96), in which blue glass beads are remelted to create an offering to the Sacred Arrows bundle at the "Sun Dance." Such a ceremony could only develop after the availability of trade beads, yet the remelting of beads among the Mandan and the Cheyenne, at least, was known to Europeans by the early nineteenth century (Orchard, 1975: 91-95). According to Grinnell (1923: II, 88): The Cheyennes say there is a principal god who lives up above-Heam- mawihio-and that there is also a god living under the ground-Ahktuno 'wihio. Both are beneficent and they possess like powers. Four powerful spirits dwell at the four points of the compass. In smoking, the first smokes are offered to these six powers . . . Heammawihio, the Wise One Above, was the chief god. He was the creator; he first of all was addressed in prayer, and to him the first smoke was offered.</page><page sequence="13">PAPER: THE SUPPRESSION OF FEMININE SPIRITUALITY 13 If one excluded the limitation of creation exclusively to the male generative power, we have a relationship among relatively equal powers that reflects the sociopolitical order. Cheyenne culture, as most other Algonkin cultures, was an egalitarian society, loosely organized about leaders who ruled by consensus and who had no authority, save that temporarily granted by each individual. This type of leadership was not understood by Euro-American governments which failed to un- derstand that leaders could not order their followers to do anything, except during communal hunts. (Lack of hierarchical leadership led to the military failures against the American army). Hence, the Power Above was nominally a chief, but one who was at best primus inter pares. For the poorly understood women's rituals, it may well have been that the Power Below was accorded first offering. For the "Sun Dance," it was the power-to-the-east that had primacy. Fox Texts: The interrelationship between sociopolitical patterns and the or- dering of sacred powers is also evident in a Fox text, collected in 1914, associated with the Owl Sacred Bundle. In the main part of the text (Michelson, 1921: 43) where the words are of Grandfather Owl, we find: And all the manitous will hear the flute when you blow it.... But even the one who is above will hear it. But he will only hear it when a dance is given. If now, you hold a small gens festival he will not hear it.... Truly that (Manitou who is above) will only hear it when there is a large gens festival. This means the elder or chief manito, in the above sense, will respond only to large gatherings when a human chief would be present-that is, at a large clan gathering. In the same text (pp. 24-25), the only reference to Ke'tcima'netowani is in an explanatory passage, not in those spoken by Owl, in the context of "the Great Manitou who made this earth, who made every- thing." This linkage of the Great Manitou with creation combined with infrequent mention is found in other Fox texts as well (e.g., Michelson, 1927: 125). Michelson (1930: 56) points out, "Since in the majority of cases the story is nonetiological, once more we hold that the ritual is primary and that the story is secondary in so far as it has been adapted to the former." Hence, these references to the Great Manitou as creator are probably later amendations to earlier oral texts.</page><page sequence="14">14 AMERICAN INDIAN QUARTERLY, FALL 1983 Lakota Parallels: The Christianization of Cheyenne concepts is probably similar to and contemporaneous with the transition that took place in Siouan cultures. Charles Eastman (Ohiyesa), a Wahpeton Sioux with both a traditional and a Dartmouth College and Boston University education, argued (1911: 54-55) in the early twentieth century that "During the era of reconstruction they [Sioux] modified their customs and beliefs continually, creating a singular admixture of Christian with pagan superstition, and in addition to the old folk-lore of disguised Bible stories under an Indian aspect." The recent publication and retran- slation of James Walker's research notes makes explicit the process in Lakota Sioux culture. Since the beginning of the twentieth century, Wakan Tanka is a term generally accepted as designating the Lakota high god. But Walker's oldest informants understood the term differently. Little Wound (b. ca. 1829) used the term as a collective (Walker, 1980: 70). Good Seat (b. ca. 1827) used the term as a designation for the mysterious and wonderful (Walker, p. 140). Red Cloud (b. ca. 1823), speaking in 1903, said (Walker, 1980: 98-99): "I was taught that the Sun (Wi) was a Great Mystery (Wakan Tanka), that he was the Supreme Mystery (Iyotan Wakanta) and that he was our [Grand]father (Tunkansila), and my people addressed him as Father (Ate).... Wi is my father. The Wakan Tanka of the white man has overcome him. But I shall remain true to him." George Sword (b. 1847), of the following generation was Walker's chief informant and had already become an Episcopal deacon. In 1896, he said (Walker, 1980: 75): "In old times the Lakota believed that Wakan Tanka was everywhere all the time and observed everything that each one of mankind did and even knew what everyone thought, that he might be pleased or displeased because of something that one did. So the shaman taught the people ceremonies that would please the Wakan Tanka and gain their favor." (Note in the above the use of the singular until the plural in the last sentence). The means by which the Sun became a "Jehovah"-like figure may be as follows. The Lakota had two primary spirits reflecting the syn- thesis from the move to the plains by Mississippi-Missouri river valley cultures. Little Wound said in 1896 (Walker, 1980: 67): "The Buffalo is the kola (comrade) of the Sun. At night they are familiar and counsel together about all things." The Sun became the chief Wakan Tanka as reflected in the above speech of Red Cloud in his relating it to the "White" god. This cuts the masculine Sun free from the feminine</page><page sequence="15">PAPER: THE SUPPRESSION OF FEMININE SPIRITUALITY 15 Buffalo. Wakan Tanka, under Christian influence, is thus amalgamated with the Christian deity as reflected in George Sword's words. The chief sources of contemporary understanding of Lakota re- ligious concepts have been two books by John Niehardt (1961/1932) and Joseph Epes Brown (1953) recording the words of Black Elk, who taught a monotheistic Wakan Tanka. Scholars who have studied the former's manuscript in comparison to his publication have noted that Niehardt expurgated the references to Christianity by Black Elk who was a Catholic catechist (Steinmetz, 1980: 54). From the recently published autobiography of Fools Crow (Mails, 1980: 45), the synthesis can now be understood as deliberate: I want to point out, however, that my uncle, Black Elk, became a Roman Catholic in 1904.... Black Elk was very interested in the teachings of the Roman Catholic Church and spent many hours talking to the priests about it. When he and I were discussing it one day, Black Elk told me he had decided that the Sioux religious way of life was pretty much the same as that of the Christian churches, and there was no reason to change what the Sioux were doing. We could pick up some of the Christian ways and teachings, and just work them in with our own, so in the end both would be better. Referring to his becoming the Ceremonial Chief of the Teton Sioux, Fools Crow said (Mails, 1980: 107): "It was clear now that the white man's religion was making deep inroads into our traditional life-way, and I knew that my leadership would require me to help the people adjust to it. That would not be impossible for me. I was already attending the Roman Catholic Church." Black Elk and Fools Crow completed the final stage of the Christianization of Sioux religion, reminiscent of the action reported by Dablon in 1671, in creating a monotheistic deity from the sun via the creator of the sun (Mails, 1980: 119-20): The sun knows everything. To us it is like the Sacred Pipe. They are both instruments used by Wakan-Tanka, and they are the greatest instruments he has, next to the directions. The sun is something he created for the rest of creation.... There is only one true God, and we Sioux have believed this for as far back in time as we can remember... Wakan-Tanka, Tunhaskila [Grandfather], and the spirit powers make a trinity, just like the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit do in the Christian religion. The Lakota transformation is comparable to that of Ojibwa culture nearly a century earlier. Similar to Copway, Peter Jones (1860, in Graham, 1975: 100), an Ojibwa chief and Methodist missionary who died in 1856, wrote, "The various tribes of the Ojebway nation scattered along the shores of the great lakes universally believe in the existence</page><page sequence="16">16 AMERICAN INDIAN QUARTERLY, FALL 1983 of one Supreme Being; whom they call Kechmunedo, which literally signifies the Great Spirit." However, in the twentieth century in dis- tinction to the nineteenth, Native leaders such as Black Elk and Fools Crow sought to maintain Native religion alongside Christianity with a harmonized theology. Causative Factors in the Transition to a High God Any discussion of the development of the high god concept in Algonkin culture must be preceded by the point that change in Native American religions was not in and of itself a product of contact with European culture. Any living religion, as any aspect of human culture, continually evolves in response to other changes in the culture. Indeed, the development of a supreme-deity concept can be demonstrated for the precontact Americas in the appropriate context of imperial gov- ernment. John Howland Rowe (1960: 408) supports the Inca assertion that "the worship of the Supreme Being was invented by the Great Inca conqueror Pachakut' Inka Yupanki (1438-71), as part of a general reform of Inca religion which Pachakuti undertook at the time he organised the Inca imperial administration." Contact with European culture led to massive changes in many aspects of Native culture and these changes grew to crisis proportions. In northeastern North America, there was rapid depopulation because of the effects of newly-introduced diseases, a major economic shift caused by the fur trade and its resultant effects on concepts of land- tenure, as well as the shock of confronting cultures with supreme rulers, both temporal and religious, and having a superior technology. The shift from subsistence hunting to fur trapping displaced the eco- nomic base of the individual vision quest for personal power; communal sharing of either the hunt or garden crops eroded; and new patterns of leadership were unsuccessfully sought to counter those of the highly- organized Europeans. Other changes included the introduction of large-scale warfare and massive population moves to the west with eventual forced relocation in concentration camps. James Axtell (1981: 83ff) has indicated two potential options for adjusting to these changed circumstances "without surrendering their ethnic and cultural identity." One was the mode of revitalization movements, such as possibly the Midewiwin (the interpretation is controversial) in the late seventeenth century (Hickerson, 1962), the movement surrounding the eighteenth-century Delaware Prophet (Hunter, 1971), and the reform of Handsome Lake in the early nineteenth century (Wallace, 1969). These movements selectively incorporated aspects of Christianity within a Native context. The second option</page><page sequence="17">PAPER: THE SUPPRESSION OF FEMININE SPIRITUALITY 17 was to accept Christianity, but from a Native perspective, for the purpose of revitalizing Native cultures. The nineteenth-century Ojibwa Christian leaders and, to a lesser degree, the Lakota leaders previously cited illustrate this mode. The evolution of the Algonkin high god was not an abrupt shift from aboriginal understanding, but more likely an increase in emphasis of an aspect of the understanding of manito. That manitos had an underlying unifying aspect was undoubtedly understood, at least by those shamans who had the mystic experience.9 Furthermore, the manitos are functionally similar in that they are manitos. Examples of this type of theological speculation among the Lakota can be found in Walker's manuscripts (1980: 60): "Wakan Tanka is like sixteen different persons. But each person is kan. Therefore they are all the same as one." Such speculation probably also took place within Algonkin cul- tures. As was previously noted, "manito" itself may be spoken in a grammatically ambiguous way; i.e., as singular when the plural is meant. By either shifting the meaning from the plural to the singular or adding the prefix k'ce, Algonkin religious leaders could modify their terminology to respond to the Euro-American valuation of monotheism as a sign of superior culture. The development of the "Great Spirit" concept was integral with a shift in the concept of creation. In most if not all Algonkin cultures, the earth was re-established in the midst rather than the beginning of the culture-hero mythic complex in an earth-diver context. The adoption of the Great Spirit concept prompted by contact with Chris- tianity included the adoption of Western causal notions and emphasis-- for example, the shift to the creator of the Sun by Dablon in 1671- with the Judeo-Christian concept of linear time. Hence, we find the attachment of a Genesis-type myth to the beginning of culture-hero myth chains or migration myths, as in the Walum-Olum. Adoption of the concept of a Supreme Being as creator provided a means for integrating the ideology of European and Native religions and provided a rationale for the crisis engendered by contact, as in an early-twentieth- century Menomini culture-hero myth cycle (Skinner &amp; Satterlee, 1915: 241) which begins: In the beginning, me-c-awe-tok the Supreme God, created the world by putting islands into the great waters. Then he took up some earth like wax and moulded in his hand the image of a human being. Then he blew his breath four times upon it and it came to life and it was his son, Jesus. He placed him across the great waters on the other islands and old German country and gave them to protect and rule. Then the Supreme God took up red clay.., and made me'napos [Nanabush], his servant, to protect this island and his grandmother's people and he decreed Jesus</page><page sequence="18">18 AMERICAN INDIAN QUARTERLY, FALL 1983 and me'napos should be friends and brothers, each to remain on his separate island and to take care of his people. All went well until Columbus crossed the ocean.... The narrative continues " ... the earth is the grandmother of everything that breathes..." indicating the preliminary part was attached to the more traditional narrative. The male-female duality represented by the sky and earth spirits, following the influence of patriarchal Christian religion and usually male-oriented missionary influence, is reduced to a male creator deity dwelling above. Elizabeth Tooker (1964: 81, ft. 42) in discussing a culture contiguous to the Algonkin felt: "It is possible ... that Haveniyu, 'Great Spirit' or 'Controller,' which Handsome Lake called the Creator, has been substituted for the older 'Sky' in Iroquoian religion by Hand- some Lake: in present Iroquoian cosmology, the Creator occupies the place of the Sky in early accounts."62 At approximately the same time, in the early nineteenth century, the Shawnee Prophet, Teenskwaatawa, (unsuccessfully) attempted to change the gender of the female Shawnee creator, Our Grandmother, to accord with the ideology of the dominant culture (contrary to the point of C. E and E. W Voegelin, 1944: 370- 75). Raffaele Pettazoni (1956: 435) argues that "the religion of the Earth-Mother belongs properly to farming cultures." He interprets (p. 380) the two faces on the central pole of the Lenape Delaware Big- House ceremonial as reflecting male-female duality due to Iroquoian influence. While I would agree that emphasis on the Earth-Mother concept would reflect Iroquoian matriliniality and matrilocality, one need not assume that hunting-gathering peoples were unacquainted with the earth-fertility concept. Where women did not garden, they gathered wild plant foods. Furthermore, the archetype-spirits of the hunted animals, the deified symbols of nourishment, are feminine powers related to the earth, as for example, White Buffalo Cow Woman of the Lakota. Robert Lowie (1924: 205-11) considered women's participation in Amerindian religion important, but this participation has been virtually ignored by both male and female ethnologists and students of religion.9 Alan Wolf Leg reports (1979: 21) in regard to the Blackfoot: "There is a woman's Society completely composed of women. They have a lodge and their own rituals. It was not formed because someone noticed that women did not have one, it was created with a woman in it."10 Donald Berthrong'" told me that the Cheyenne women's rituals per se have yet to be studied. Peter Powell (1969: II, 445) discusses the women's essential roles in renewal ceremonies, "in which woman plays a complementary role</page><page sequence="19">PAPER: THE SUPPRESSION OF FEMININE SPIRITUALITY 19 to man." But under obvious Christian influence, the mythic role of female procreative power was made subordinate to the male: " 'Out of man, the woman was first made by Maheo. Through her, the earth and the people of the earth are replenished,' Fire Wolf stated" (Powell, 1969: II, 448). Of all the aspects of Christian influence, it is probably the excision of the female from the aboriginal concept of creation that enabled the concept of a single high god to emerge. Furthermore, with indirect (e.g., Micmac in the 16th century) and direct (e.g., Menomini in the 17th century) missionary influence, amalgamating the Sun as the primary celestial power with the Son, Jesus, the Sun slowly came to be understood as a power subservient to another. As Jesus was understood as the agent of the Father, so the Sun became the "eyes" of the distant kichemanito, watching over the behavior of the people (e.g., Benton-Banai, 1979: 16). There was no superior force of which the Earth was an agent, so Sun as Grandfather/ Father and Earth as Grandmother/Mother maintained their equality, but as kitchemanito was "over" the Sun, so "He" must be superior to the Earth. Ruth Underhill (1948: 12) has pointed out that "With further organization, a change also takes place in the concept of supernatural power. Individual spirits, at first merely a vehicle for impersonal power, begin to take on importance and personality." Among most Algonkin cultures and the contiguous and ecologically related Sioux, leadership devolved on the older men and women of a community. Two males with the greatest prestige, understood as having the most powerful relationship with helping spirits, would function as war and peace leaders, but their control was dependent on voluntary acceptance of their role. The powers were understood in a similar light, the male sky power was a nominal chief over the other major powers; among the Lakota: "Wi [Sun] is the Chief of the Gods" (Walker, 1980: 95). However, a primus inter pares is not a high god in the term's usual sense. Schmidt (1933: 129) uses the term "true Supreme Beings" synonymously with "High God" and considers the term to imply monotheism: "These people [Algonkins] worship One God... a true Supreme God." Other senses of "high god"-superior diety with sub- ordinate pantheon, otiose creator god, etc.-are, of course, also not implied bjr a primus inter pares. The development of a high-god concept required either a consid- erably more complex sociopolitical structure, as among the fifteenth- century Inca, or subordination to a culture with such a structure and religion. Hence, contact with European culture led to the male com- ponent of the Sky-Earth complex becoming an autocratic ruler but a distant one-as distant, from a Native perspective, as were at first</page><page sequence="20">20 AMERICAN INDIAN QUARTERLY, FALL 1983 the European and then the American or Canadian rulers (John Man- atuwaba quoted by Jenness, 1935: 30): "There is a big boss manido, the chief of all manidos. He stays somewhere in one place, sitting quietly and supervising everything. He is like the captain on a steam- boat, or like the Government that remains in Ottawa, yet has servants all over the country. So the Great Manido has lesser bosses in different regions, and they have lesser manidos under them." The female component of the aboriginal spiritual complex came to be considered created by the male aspect, who also came to in- corporate the common unitive aspect of all the powers. The sky manito has become kichemanito, the postcontact Algonkin high god. Afterword Although this paper is primarily an intellectual exercise oriented towards historians of religions, it also enabled me to comprehend certain aspects of contemporary Native religions. For Native people who may read this, I offer this thought for consideration: Terminology does tend to channel our understanding. Although Mishomis (Ojibwa: Grandfather) and Nokomis (Grandmother) are essentially and can be experientially one, to limit our voice to terminology that recognizes only the male generative power as, for example, "Creator" and "Great Spirit," in effect, denies that oneness. NOTES 1. An earlier version of this paper was delivered at the symposium "Monotheism Reconsidered" at the meeting of the Canadian Society for the Study of Religion, Van- couver: May, 1983. I would like to express my appreciation to Amanda Porterfield of Syracuse University and my former student, Dan Merkur, for suggestions incorporated into this paper. 2. Because there is no agreed system of Algonkin romanization and because this paper covers a large linguistic family with varying degrees of linguistic differences between individual cultures, quoted material will embody considerable variation of native terms. The forms I use in discussion were arbitrarily chosen for convenience and do not reflect cultural predilections. 3. Repeated in the Relations of 1653 (XXXIX, 15). 4. In the German edition, we find "Kitche Manitou sometimes ('zuweilen') was no nomen proprium of a single being, but an appellation of a whole class of spirits" (Hultkrantz 1981/1971: 27). 5. Using the translation of C. E Voegelin based on Rafinesque's text, rather than the earlier translation of Brinton (1885). 6. The latter term from two Native missionaries in the mid-nineteenth century; see Grant, (1980). 7. Given that influence, one hesitates to accept Hultkrantz's acceptance of Cooper's mid-twentieth-century "Supreme Being" report. 8.
