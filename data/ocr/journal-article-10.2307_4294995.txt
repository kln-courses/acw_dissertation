ADOX and A. Saxena. Fairleigh Dickin- son University, The School Of Natural Sci- ences-Biology Department, Teaneck, New Jersey. E-Mail: Rosalie.Adox@spcorp.com The cellular microecology of tumors influences responsive- ness to therapeutic agents and has implications in cancer research. Abnormal vascularization of malignant tumors is associated with the development of microregions of hetero- geneous cells and environments. Multicellular spheroids, three-dimensional aggregates formed by the interaction of dissociated cells, are being used to determine the character- istics of these microregions. The normal fibroblast cells of the chinese hamster lung, ATCC#:V79-4, were used for this study because they exhibit a high plating efficiency and generation time of twelve to fourteen hours. Spheroids were grown using the cells obtained from a monolayer cell sus- pension and placed on agarose gels. The Ham's F-12 Me- dium was used to grow the cell suspension and the cell culture was maintained at 37 degrees celsius with 5% CO2. Somatostatin (SS), a growth inhibitory hormone, was added to the spheroids, in the 96 well microtiter plate, and to the monolayer of cells. Thirty ng and sixty ng of SS were added to the spheroids resulting in 23% and 31% inhibition of the size of the spheroid, respectively. An initial dose of 20 ng SS was added to the monolayer of cells with an additional 20 ng to produce 14% inhibition in cell growth. Then, a whole 40 ng dose was added to the monolayer of cells to obtain 65.8% inhibition. The growth of SS treated spheroids and monolayer of cells was inhibited in a dose-dependent fashion. SS inhibits the growth cycle of most somatic cells. This study concludes that SS can inhibit the cell population in normal fibroblast cells. SV-1001 Transfection Shortcuts. L. JACOBSEN, S. Calvin and K. Colvin. Roche Diagnotics, Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN 46250. E-mail: kim.colvin@roche.com We identified steps in transfection protocols that were most tedious for our applications, and determined which could be modified or eliminated. The steps were: 1) plating cells the day prior to transfection 2) plating at specific densities, 3) removing medium and washing cultures during actual trans- fection, and 4) heat inactivating prior to assay for enzymatic activity. We co-transfected pXMlacZ or pHMlacZ (pro- teinC or HA epitope tag vectors) and pCMV-SEAP (se- creted alkaline phosphatase) into COS-1, CHO K-1 293 and NIH/3T3 cells using FuGENETM 6 Transfection Reagent (a trademark of Fugent LLC) from Roche Molecular Bio- chemicals (RMB). We obtained equivalent results when we 1) transfected cultures the day of plating (no overnight in- cubation), 2) transfected at several plating densities (flex- ibility in the number of plates), 3)transfected in plating me- dium (no medium removal or washing), 4) assayed SEAP activity in culture supernatants (chemiluminescent reporter gene assay kit(RMB)) by direct addition of culture medium into the microtiter plates (no centrifugation and heating). After the SEAP activity was determined we either stained the cells for beta galactosidase expression, assayed for pro- tein expression using western blots, or purified the protein using the epitope tag. SV-1002 The Effect of Endotoxin on Transfection Ef- ficacy. L. JACOBSEN, K. Colvin and S. Cal- vin. Roche Diagnostics, Roche Molecular Bio- chemicals, Indianapolis, IN 46250. E-mail: kim.colvin @roche.com It has been reported that endotoxin inhibits transfection ef- ficiency. The greater the endotoxin concentration, the lower the transfection efficacy. Endotoxin concentration is asso- ciated with the purity of plasmid DNA. This correlation had not been tested for FuGENETM 6 Transfection Reagent (a trademark of Fugent LLC) from Roche Molecular Bio- chemicals. We tested the effect of endotoxin on transfection efficiency using plasmid DNA (pCMV 3-Gal) in the pres- ence of increasing amounts of endotoxin; 0.08 EU/ug DNA, 62.13 EU/ug and 4754 EU/ug. The DNA and endotoxin were combined with diluted FuGENETM 6 Transfection Re- agent and then added to the cells(NIH/3T3, COS-1 and HeLa). Transfection efficiency was measured by beta ga- lactosidase activity using a chemiluminescent reporter gene assay kit. We found moderate levels of endotoxin to have minimal effect on transfection efficiency using FuGENETM 6 Transfection Reagent. However, high levels of endotoxin decreased transfection levels in cell line dependent manner. SV-1003 Robotics Automation of Mammalian Cell Cul- ture Processing. P.A. OFFIN, J.A. Edwards and J.R.

SV-1004 HIV-1 Pathogenesis in Human Lymphoid Tis- sue ex vivo. J.C. GRIVEL, M.L. Penn, M.A. Goldsmith and L. Margolis. Laboratory of Cellular and Molecular Biophysics, National Institute of Child Health and Human Devel- opment, Bethesda, MD 20892. E-mail: grigri @ helix.nih.gov 544</page><page sequence="3">The human chemokine receptors CCR5 and CXCR4 are the predominant cellular cofactors together with CD4 for infec- tion by HIV-1 in vivo. CCR5-tropic (R5) viruses predomi- nate in the early stage of infection whereas CXCR4-tropic (X4) viruses emerge later. The evolution from R5 viruses to X4 viruses often precedes the rapid decline of CD4 T cells characterizing the onset of AIDS. Indeed, in in vitro and in vivo model systems, infection with R5 viruses causes less CD4 T cell depletion than does infection with X4-tropic viruses. Despite these evidences, a causative relationship between tropism and cytopathicity has not been established, nor have the reasons for the differential cytopathicity of R5-and X4-tropic viruses been established. To address these questions, we used ex vivo culture of human lymphoid tis- sue together with recombinant isogenic HIV-1 differing only in the regions of gp120 that determine viral tropism. We showed that as opposed to R5 viruses, X4 viruses were highly cytopathic for CD4 T cells. Moreover, the differen- tial cytopathicity between R5 and X4 viruses could be ex- plained by the relative abundance of the T cell expressing the relevant coreceptors. Indeed, T cells expressing CXR4 constitute 80% of CD4 T cells whereas CCR5 expressing T cells represent only 10% of these cells. We show that R4 viruses deplete CXCR4 expressing CD4 T cells and R5 viruses deplete CCR5 expressing CD4 T cells. Because CCR5 expressing CD4 T cells T cells constitute only a small fraction of CD4 cells, their depletion does not sub- stantially change the total CD4 T cell count. These results may explain why the clinical stages of HIV infection cor- relate with viral tropism. SV-1005 A Computer-Based Data Warehouse Ap- proach for Bioinformatic Instrument Standard- ization. S.L. SCHNEIDER, W. Oquendo, A.C. Guillen and S.A. Optenberg. LITTON/PRC and Center For Health Care Education and Studies, San Antonio, TX 78234. E-mail: dr.sandra.schneider@ cs.amedd.army.mi As part of medical health care reform, there is an urgent need to provide early diagnosis and treatment of cancer and at risk disease patients. This process has stimulated a $300 billion global market demand for design, development and management of biotechnology software and bioinformatic systems. The software systems must be analytical instru- ments engineered to solve combinatorial data analysis. More important the system(s) require viable standardized instruments that are user interactive and based on custom data marts/warehouse informatics specific to the community at risk an/or biotechnology research. The Computer-Based Decision (CBD) System is a model for complete biotech- nology data management and data warehousing. The CBD- System uses SAS data warehouse software on a SUN/UNIX platform with RAID, online jukeboxes, off-line disks and workstation optical drives. This modular system provides a secure analytical research environment to efficiently main- tain and standardize data from multiple laboratory and/or clinical trial sites. The CBDSystem provides improvements to current data repositories, fosters biotechnology research and will ultimately enhance clinical diagnosis and treat- ment. SV-1006 Specific Cyclooxygenase 2 Inhibition De- creases Prostaglandin E2 Synthesis in Human Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms. W.N. Wester, J. Curci and J.M. Reilly. Washington Univer- sity School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO 63110. E-mail: reillyj @msnotes.wustl.edu Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) produce prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) which may be key intermediary in AAA patho- genesis. PGE2 synthesis is rate limited by cyclooxygenase which has 2 isoforms, coxl and cox2. The purpose of this study was to determine if specific cox2 inhibition decreases PGE2 synthesis in AAA tissue. Aortic specimens (AAA = 10, normal = 4) were used for whole organ culture. 4 cultures were established for each specimen with 2 being treated with the cox2 inhibitor SC-236 and 2 serving as controls. The conditioned media was assayed by ELISA for PGE2. Histologic analysis included immunostaining for PGE2. The PGE2 ELISA showed that AAA produced 111.2 ? 46.5 ng/ml compared to 4.1 ? 6.9 ng/ml by normal aorta (p &lt; 0.01). SC-236 decreased PGE2 synthesis by AAA to 7.7 ? 6.6 ng/ml (p &lt; 0.001). PGE2 was localized to macro- phages associated with the inflammatory infiltrate within the media of AAA. In conclusion, specific cox2 inhibition decreases PGE2 synthesis in AAA and, therefore, may be useful in pharmacotherapy of AAA. SV-1007 Positive and Negative Hematopoietic Cyto- kines Produced by Bone Marrow Endothelial Cells. W.M. LI, W.Q. Huang, Y.H. Huang, D.Z. Jiang, Q.R. Wang. Experimental Hema- tology Laboratory, Hunan Medical Univer- sity, Changsha, 410078, CHINA. E-mail: liweimin@public.cs.hn.cn Cytokines and interleukins such as SCF, GM-CSF,G- CSF,TGF-b,IL-6,IL-7,IL-8,IL- 11 elaborated by endothelial cells were reported by many authors. Recently, a murine bone marrow endothelial cell line was established in our laboratory (published previously). For further study the ef- fects of bone marrow endothelial cells (BMECs) on hema- topoiesis, serum free bone marrow endothelial cell condi- tioned medium (BMEC-CM) was collected and ultrafil- trated by using a centriprep 10. The concentrated retentate (R-BMEC-CM) contains a substance whose molecular weight was more than 10000 daltons. The filtrate (F- BMEC-CM) contains a substance whose molecular weight was less than 10000 daltons. The effects of R-BMEC-CM and F-BMEC-CM on the growth of hematopoietic progeni- tors and the expression of cytokine mRNAs of BMEC were investigated. We found that the R-BMEC-CM stimulated the growth of CFU-GM, CFU-HPP, CFU-E and CFU- MEG. In contrast to R-BMEC-CM, F-BMEC-CM inhibited the growth of CFU-GM, CFU-HPP, CFU-E and CFU-MEG. 545</page><page sequence="4">Using the method of hybridizing to the Atlas cDNA Array, we were able to detect the expression of cytokine mRNAs in BMEC. Our finding of mRNAs of SCF, GM-SCF, IL-6, TGF-b, IL-1, and IL-11 was in agreement with the data reported previously. Furthermore, we detected mRNAs of MIP-2, Thymosin-b4, PDGF, MSP-1, IFN-g, IL-13 and in- hibin which are in relation with hematopoiesis. Among these cytokines and interleukins, SCF, GM-CSF, IL-6, IL-1, and IL-11 are ematopoietic stimulators which may respon- sible for the stimulative effect of R-BMEC-CM on the growth of hematopoietic progenitors. Our new finding, thy- mosin-b4, is a small molecular hematopoietic inhibitor. This small molecular inhibitor may responsible for the inhibitory effect of F-BMEC-CM on hematopoietic progenitors. The presence of mRNAs for BMP, MSP-1, MIP-2, PGDF and IL-13 suggests that bone marrow endothelial cells might elaborate these substances. The influence of these sub- stances on hematopoietic progenitors needs further study. SV-1008 Cultivation of Bovine Corneal Endothelial Cells in Rotating-Wall Vessel. J. MUHITCH, K. O'Connor, D. Blake and N. Rosenzweig. Tulane University and Medical School, New Orleans, LA 70118. E-mail: KOC@ MAILHOST.TCS.TULANE.EDU The Rotating-Wall Vessel (RWV) is becoming popular for tissue engineering applications due in part to the ease of co-culturing and three-dimensional (3D) cell assembly, as well as the extent of tissue differentiation and viability. The majority of research on this topic has been conducted with epithelial and fibroblastic cells which undergo 3D growth in vivo. In contrast, this study assesses the use of the RWV for the cultivation of cells which exist in vivo as a monolayer, using bovine corneal endothelial (BCE) cells as a model culture. Attachment-dependent BCE cells were grown in suspension within the RWV attached to collagen-coated Cy- todex-3 microcarrier beads. Control cultures for this study were grown on T-flasks, with and without collagen coating. Doubling times were comparable in the RWV and controls. After two weeks, there was extensive bead aggregation in the RWV; each aggregate contained on average in excess of 20 beads. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that the Cytodex-3 beads were completely covered with a single cell layer at the end of the culture period and were bound to- gether by cell bridges of 4-5 cells to form bead aggregates. The BCE cells within the confluent layer covering the bead surface retained their characteristic cobblestone morphol- ogy. The protein profiles in RWV and control cultures were significantly different. For example, there was a reduction in the accumulation of proteins greater than 175 kDa in the extracellular matrix of RWV cultures as a result of perhaps increased proteolytic activity or selective reduction in pro- tein synthesis. These changes in protein profiles may facili- tate cell bridging between beads. As such, RWV cultures may be good models for BCE migration during wound heal- ing. ST-1000 Evaluation of the Phototoxic Potential of Chemically Modified Tetracyclines Using the 3T3 Neutral Red Assay. J. HARBELL,3 B. Zerler', E. Roemer2, H. Raabe3, and A. Sizemore3 and Collagenex Pharmaceuticals, Newtown, PA 18940; 2SUNY Stony Brook, NY 11794; 3IIVS, Gaithersburg, MD 20878. Chemically modified tetracyclines (CMT), which lack an- timicrobial activity, have the ability to inhibit matrix me- talloproteases, and in some cases, serine proteases, thus at- tenuating connective tissue degeneration. Several of these compounds are now underdevelopment. Since the tetracy- clines are known to be photo-active (and some phototoxic), an in vitro screening program was begun. To identify po- tentially phototoxic CMTs, the 3T3 Neutral Red Phototox- icity assay was employed (Toxicology In Vitro 12:305-327, 1998). 3T3 cells were seeded into 96-well plates and incu- bated overnight. The growth medium was removed and re- placed with phenol red-free Hanks' Balanced Salts Solution containing serial dilutions of the CMTs (two plates per com- pound). After an initial I hour incubation at 370C, one plate was exposed to 5 Joules/m2 of UVA/white light from a solar simulator while the other was held in the dark. The plates were then rinsed, refed and incubated for 24 hours. Cell viability was measured by neutral red uptake. Phototoxicity was measured by the relative toxicity between the doses with and without light exposure following published guide- lines. Reference compounds included commercially avail- able tetracycline, doxycycline, and minocycline. The pho- totoxic response of the compounds in the present assay was consistent with their behavior in vivo. These phototoxicity results, combined with efficacy data, facilitate rational choices in selecting compounds for further study and devel- opment.

E-mail: all@anticancer.com Cancers are highly individual in their response to chemo- therapy but attempts to predict tumor response to drugs using in vitro cell culture have largely failed. A new in vitro technology, the Histoculture Drug Sensitivity Assay (HDRA), appears to have solved many previous problems. A prospective trial was conducted to determine whether effective agents for each individual patient could be distin- guished by the HDRA. Patient tumors were placed in col- lagen-sponge-gel histoculture and treated with chemothera- 546</page><page sequence="5">peutic drugs and assayed for cell viability. Patients with HDRA-sensitive tumors were treated with the drugs scored as effective in the HDRA while the patient with HDRA- resistant tumors were treated by physicians choice. For pa- tients with gastric cancer, the 50% survival of the HDRA- sensitive cases was 9.8 months compared to the 50% sur- vival of the 4.7 months for the HDRA-resistant cases (p = 0.02). In colon cancer, the 50% survival in the HDRA- sensitive cases was 16.3 months compared to the 50% sur- vival of the 7.4 months for HDRA-resistant cases (p = 0.02). This is the first prospective, controlled trial demon- strating an in vitro assay that can distinguish those agents effective for survival of the individual cancer patient. ST-1002 Predicting the Ocular Irritancy Potential of Chemicals: Evaluation of an In Vitro Human Corneal Model. X.J. Xiong, N.L.C. Laycock, R. Osborne, R. Munger and M. Griffith. Uni- versity of Ottawa Eye Institute, Ottawa, On- tario, Canada and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company, Cincinnati, USA. E-mail: xxiong@ ogh.on.ca. We have reconstructed an in vitro human cornea that con- sists of human corneal epithelial, stromal keratocyte and endothelial cell lines supported by a collagen-based matrix. The objective of the current study was to compare the per- formance of this model for predicting the potential ocular toxicity of chemicals with that of human eye bank corneas and ex vivo rabbit corneas. We examined the changes in gene expression and changes in optical performance in re- sponse to chemical contact. RT-PCR and Southern blotting were used to analyze changes in gene expression in corneas treated with 5% SDS for 3 minutes compared to untreated controls. Optical performance was measured as a change in light transmission following exposure to different classes of chemicals. RNAs for early response genes (c-fos and c-jun), cytokines (IL-la, IL-6, bFGF, EGF and VEGF) and matrix molecules (collagens I, III and V) were expressed constitu- tively in both reconstructed corneas and eye bank corneas. Expression of c-fos and IL-la was increased more than 4-fold over the untreated controls at 1 hour post-SDS ex- posure in both reconstructed corneas and eye bank corneas. Expression of c-jun, IL-6, VEGF and collagen I was in- creased over 2-fold in SDS-treated corneas. However, there was no significant change in expression of bFGF, EGF, collagens III and V after SDS injury. The change in optical performance of reconstructed corneas paralleled the optical changes measured in human eye bank corneas and ex vivo rabbit corneas for each chemical class. These results dem- onstrate that the reconstructed corneas show very similar chemical-induced changes in gene expression and optical properties to human corneas and ex vivo rabbit corneas. The reconstructed corneas are therefore good candidates for use as a human target tissue-based alternative to animal eye irritation tests. Furthermore, the changes in mRNA expres- sion for the early response genes, cytokines and collagen I following SDS injury in corneas may represent the molecu- lar mechanism underlying corneal damage and repair. ST-1003 Automating Cell Permeability Assays. M. HOGAN. Tecan US Inc., PO Box 13953, Research Triangle Park, NC 27709. E-mail: Martha.Hogan @tecan-us.com Screening assays which model the intestinal epithelial cells are of great interest to the Early Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion (ADME) groups in pharmaceu- tical companies. However, these manual assay methods are unable to provide the throughput required to screen the large number of potential drug candidates arising from the high throughput screening of compound libraries. In addition, these assay procedures are time consuming and show sig- nificant variability in their results. Drug discovery labs have not automated this procedure because they have not been able to find a robotic workstation capable of performing the required auxiliary steps, such as manipulating inserts con- taining the cell monolayers and placing the lids on micro- plates to prevent evaporation. Recently, an automated cell permeability workstation has been introduced that is spe- cifically designed to automate complete cell permeability assays. A key feature of this workstation is a robotic ma- nipulator arm (ROMA) that can pick up and move plates in the robot's workspace and feed other modules of the system. Automating this assay has resulted in an overall increase of speed by more than four times that of the most advanced manual assay, as well as making it practical to add a vali- dation step that determines whether the cell monolayer is intact. 547</page></plain_text>
