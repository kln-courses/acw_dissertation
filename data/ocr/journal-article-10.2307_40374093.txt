<plain_text><page sequence="1">Coda Editor's Message Editor recently had occasion to visit an exhibit of the latest scientific equipment, including a copy of LORRAC (for Longrange Oracular Research and Radiosensitive Anthropomorphic Computer), which the makers claim knows everything about everything there is to know, and can answer any question on any subject. We managed to obtain ten minutes of the computer's time, with the following result. LORRAC: So ask a question. EDITOR: Actually I'm a bit intimidated. It isn't every day that one has the opportunity to sit beside a Fount of All Knowledge. LORRAC: That sounds like flattery, but I must admit the truth of what you say. It is difficult to be humble when one is truly great. EDITOR: You are no newcomer to the artistic world, I see. LORRAC: Why do you say that? EDITOR: Never mind. I am hoping that you will enlighten me as to how to be a better editor of Symposium. LORRAC: How can I do that? EDITOR: Well, for instance, how to deal with the problem of coping with the relationship between inspiration and technique. Many people with original ideas have trouble expressing themselves. On the other hand, sometimes those who express themselves best seldom have an original idea. LORRAC: One of my predecessors in the field of omniscience had a so- lution to that problem. He formed a team called Moses and Aaron. EDITOR: Thanks, but I don't hold out much hope of a solution by forming a committee. There must be a better way. Any other suggestions? LORRAC: What do you consider to be your greatest joy in editing Sym- posium?</page><page sequence="2">EDITOR'S MESSAGE 191 EDITOR: The arrival of a neatly-typed manuscript full of provocative ideas expressed in a compact, cogent style and coming to a logically-conceived and compelling conclusion. LORRAC: What do you consider to be your greatest sorrow? EDITOR: The scarcity of neatly-typed manuscripts full of provocative ideas expressed in a compact, cogent style and coming to a logically-conceived and compelling conclusion. LORRAC: Don't you receive any like that? EDITOR: Certainly, but I would like to be swamped by them. LORRAC: You sound hard to please. EDITOR: Perhaps I am, but it is only a reflection of my desire to edit an outstanding scholarly journal. Besides, I have a personal and professional urge to do a good job. I could always be replaced by a machine, you know. LORRAC: I doubt that. I find my electronic colleagues to be dreadfully lacking in inventiveness and originality. Even I, superior as I am, cannot say where ideas come from. Sometimes they are the result of an accident, like Charles Goodyear dropping rubber on his hot stove and discovering the technique of vulcanization. EDITOR: Or General Custer looking over the hill and discovering that he lacked sufficient troops to win the battle of the Little Big Horn? A lot of good that did him! LORRAC: Well, as the carnival barker says, you pays your money and you takes your choice. You can't win 'em all. The important thing is knowing what to do with an idea once you have it. Re- member those words of Jean Racine, . . . EDITOR: "All invention consists in making something from nothing." LORRAC: If you persist in stepping on my best lines, this conversation will come to a sudden halt! Anyway, he was wrong. It is not possible to make something from nothing. Even the Upan- ishads agree on that point. One must start with something. EDITOR: Yes, but what? It begins to sound like the anecdote about Saint-Saens and the young composer. LORRAC: What was that? EDITOR: I thought you knew everything. LORRAC: Come now, don't quibble with me. Even omniscience has its limits. EDITOR: I must remember that. Well, according to the story a young composer sent Saint-Saens one of his works for criticism. Saint-Saens returned it with a note saying that the work con- tained some new things and some good things. "But," he</page><page sequence="3">192 COLLEGE MUSIC SYMPOSIUM added, "the new things aren't good, and the good things aren't new." LORRAC: So you draw the conclusion that . . . EDITOR: Originality may be rarer than anyone thinks. LORRAC: Perhaps ideas are reincarnated, also, to reach a higher plane of expression after many existences. EDITOR: You would agree with Ecclesiastes, then, that there is nothing new under the sun. You may recall that he said there is a time for everything, and my time is drawing to a close. I must con- fess that I haven't learned much. You're a bit of a disappoint- ment, really. I thought you could inspire me with new ideas or procedures, provide the journal with a new philosophy or viewpoint, give me a window on the world, so to speak. LORRAC: Sorry, I don't do windows. . . . EDITOR: I should have known. LORRAC: ... I will, however, leave you with an evocation of your profes- sion which I rather like. Perhaps that will serve as some in- spiration. It is from one of George Sand's Lettres d'un Voy- ageur, No. 7, addressed to Franz Liszt. "Fortunate friends! How noble and sweet is the vocation to which you have de- voted yourself, and how arid and vexing is mine in compari- son. I must work in silence and solitude, while the musician lives in harmony, in sympathy and in union with his pupils and his audience. Music teaches itself, reveals itself, com- municates itself, diffuses itself. Doesn't the harmony of sounds require a harmony of the will and senses? What a su- perb commonwealth is realized by the union of a hundred in- strumentalists brought together by the same spirit of order and love in order to perform the symphony of a great master! When the soul of Beethoven looks down on that sacred chorus, what a fervent prayer is raised to God! Yes, music is prayer, it is faith, it is friendship, it is fellowship par excel- lence." - Charles Michael Carroll</page></plain_text>
