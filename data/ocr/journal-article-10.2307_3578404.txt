Leukemia, Lymphoma, and Multiple Myeloma after Pelvic Radiotherapy for Benign Dis- ease. Radiat. Res. 135, 108-125 (1993). The relationship between exposure to sparsely ionizing radia- tion and mortality due to cancers of hematopoietic and lym- phopoietic tissues was studied among 12,955 women treated for benign gynecological disorders at any of 17 hospitals in New England or New York State and followed for an average of 25 years; 9770 women were treated by radiation (intracavitary 226Ra, external-beam X rays), while 3185 were treated by other methods, including curettage, surgery, and hormones. The aver- age age at treatment was 46.5 years, and the mean dose to active bone marrow among irradiated women was 119 cGy. Forty deaths due to acute, myelocytic, or monocytic leukemia were observed among irradiated women. This number was 70% higher than expected based on U.S. mortality rates [standard- ized mortality ratio (SMR) = 1.7; 90% confidence interval (CI) 1.3-2.31. A deficit was recorded among nonirradiated women, based on three observed deaths (SMR = 0.5; 90% CI 0.1-1.2). A well-defined gradient in the SMR with dose among exposed women was not detected. The SMR was highest within 5 years after irradiation but remained elevated even after 30 years. The temporal pattern differed by subtype of leukemia: excess mortal- ity due to chronic myelocytic leukemia occurred almost exclu- sively within the first 15 years, whereas the SMR for acute leu- kemia, though also elevated, varied little over time. Cancers of lymphoreticular tissue occurred more often than expected based on U.S. mortality rates, but not appreciably differently for irra- diated and nonirradiated women. There was little or no evidence of effects attributable to radiotherapy for chronic lymphocytic leukemia [relative risk (RR) = 1.1; 90% CI 0.5-3.0], Hodgkin's disease (RR = 0.9; 90% CI 0.3-3.2), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (RR = 0.9; 90% CI 0.6-1.6), or multiple myeloma (RR = 0.6; 90% CI 0.3-1.4). These results corroborate previous findings indicating that acute and myelocytic leukemias are the most prominent malignancies after exposure to sparsely ionizing radi- ation, occurring in excess shortly after irradiation, and that lym- phomas are either not caused by radiation or are induced only rarely. ? 1993 Academic Press, Inc. INTRODUCTION Active, or red, bone marrow is among the tissues most susceptible to the carcinogenic effects of ionizing radiation (1). This has been demonstrated most clearly for acute and myelocytic leukemias, which have been shown repeatedly to occur at increased rates in irradiated populations (2). For these cancers, epidemiological issues of current interest in- clude the shape of the dose-response relationship and mag- nitude of risks, particularly at low doses and dose rates, and determinants of interperson differences in susceptibility. On the other hand, nearly equally consistent findings have been the absence of associations between irradiation and the occurrence of chronic lymphocytic leukemia or Hodg- kin's disease (1, 2). Findings have been less consistent for multiple myeloma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (1, 3), and the ability of radiation to induce these cancers remains in question. The experience of the Japanese atomic bomb survivors (4) has proven to be the single most important source of information about risks of radiogenic cancers in human populations exposed to sparsely ionizing radiation. How- ever, even these extensive data have limitations (1), includ- ing lingering uncertainties about doses, limited information for the first 5 years after exposure, and the possibility that 'Current Address: Department of Applied Medical Sciences, University of Southern Maine, 96 Falmouth St., Portland, ME 04103. 2 Private consultant; Route 1, Box 148D, Huddleston, VA 24104. 0033-7587/93 $5.00 108 Copyright ? 1993 by Academic Press, Inc.

Perhaps more importantly, the A-bomb3 data do not address the effects of the protracted or chronic exposures that are more typical of occupational and environmental settings. Furthermore, background rates for lymphoreticular cancers are substantially lower in Japan than in North America (5). The combined effects of radiation and other causes of cancer are not well under- stood, and it is not known how radiation risks are related to the level of risk from other causes. Medically irradiated pop- ulations, including patients treated for cervical cancer (6, 7) or ankylosing spondylitis (8, 9), have also provided infor- mation about cancer risks over a range of doses. However, bone marrow doses for both populations were very high, a feature that complicates inferences about risks at low doses. Here, we report results of a large, multicenter study of women treated with radiation to control abnormal uterine bleeding or other symptoms associated with benign gyneco- logical disorders (BGD). Radiation is no longer used to treat these conditions (10) but was used commonly during the 1930s and 1940s (11-15). Radiation doses were consid- erably lower than those associated with treatment for uter- ine cancer. The study population, which was drawn from women treated at hospitals in New England and New York State, is three times the size of the largest previous study (16), and includes a comparison group of BGD patients who were treated by methods other than irradiation (hor- mones, curettage, hysterectomy, oophorectomy). Bone marrow doses were estimated for individual women, based on hospital radiotherapy records, and women were fol- lowed for an average of 25 years. The experience of this large cohort provides quantitative information about the risk of death due to hematological cancers associated with average bone marrow doses on the order of tens to hundreds of centigrays.4 METHODS Study population and follow-up. Eligible women were treated for be- nign gynecological disorders at any one of 17 hospitals in eastern Massa- chusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, or western New York between 1925 and 1965. Hospitals were selected based on proximity to Boston, New Haven, or Buffalo and known histories of having treated patients for BGD. Women with gynecological cancer diagnosed prior to or at the time of treatment for BGD were excluded. Women were ascertained through ex- haustive searches of medical records, radiotherapy records, surgical log- books, and physician files. A total of 9770 irradiated women and 3185 nonirradiated women were enrolled. Of the irradiated women, 61% were treated with intrauterine radium (226Ra) capsules, 20% by external-beam X rays, and 19% with radium and X rays. These percentages differed widely among hospitals and states. Two-thirds of the radium patients were treated in Massachusetts or Rhode Island; 86% of the X-ray-treated women were from Connecticut or New York, and most (96%) of the women treated by both radium and X rays, and all of the nonirradiated women, were treated in New York. The histopathological diagnoses most commonly associated with the baseline visit for BGD were hyperplasia or dysplasia of the endo- metrium, chronic cervicitis, endometrial or cervical polyp, uterine fibroid, endometritis, and atrophy of the endometrium. Excessive or irregular bleeding was a presenting complaint among 92% of the irradiated women and 60% of the nonirradiated women for whom information about symp- toms was available. The dysfunctional bleeding sometimes was unaccom- panied by any detectable pathology. Hospital charts noted hormonal treat- ments for BGD or menopause for 6.9% of the irradiated women and 8.3% of the nonirradiated women. Two irradiated women were diagnosed with leukemia prior to their ra- diotherapy for BGD. Both died within 5 years after irradiation; one death was attributed to myelocytic leukemia, NOS (4.1 years after treatment) and the other to lymphocytic leukemia, NOS (3.9 years). These women were retained for comparisons with U.S. population experience (see be- low), but they were excluded from internal analyses contrasting exposed and nonexposed women. The study population is a combination of previously studied and newly studied patients. Cancer mortality among 4483 of the women who were irradiated in Massachusetts or Rhode Island and pre-1967 cancer inci- dence among 1893 women irradiated in Connecticut were reported previ- ously (16-18). The Connecticut population was expanded to 1960 women in the present study, and follow-up was extended through 1984. The occur- rence of leukemia, lymphoma and multiple myeloma among the 6512 women treated in New York is reported here for the first time. A variety of information sources were used to update vital status and determine dates and causes of death, as recorded on death certificates (16, 18). Tracing methods were designed to verify survival as well to ascertain deaths. Follow-up was attempted up to January 1, 1985. For 1066 women included in a previous study (17), personal identifiers were lost during a flood in a storage facility. No additional follow-up was possible for these women, and only their pre-1967 experience is known. Trained nosologists coded underlying cause of death on the death certificates according to U.S. rules prevailing at the time of death, and then recoded to ICD 8 (19). Copies of death certificates could not be obtained for 131 irradiated women (2% of all deaths) and 61 nonirradiated women (3.6%) with known dates (or years) of death. They were included in the analysis as deceased due to unknown cause. No adjustment was made to observed cause-speci- fic numbers of deaths to account for these missing cause-of-death certifica- tions. Hematology review. Copies of hematology or pathology reports, dis- charge summaries, and other relevant clinical notes regarding cases of he- matopoietic or lymphopoietic cancer reported as cause of death on death certificates were reviewed by an experienced hematologist (W.C.M.), who judged whether the descriptions supported the diagnoses given on death certificates. Corresponding microscope slides or tissue samples were not obtained. Review diagnoses were used informally to assess reliability of death certificate diagnoses and indicate patterns of misclassification. How- ever, because detailed review was not possible for all cases, and to maintain 3 Abbreviations used: A-bomb, atomic bomb; AL, acute leukemia (also includes all monocytic leukemia); ALL, acute lymphocytic leukemia; AML, acute myelocytic leukemia; AR, additive risk; BGD, benign gyneco- logical disorders; CI, confidence interval; CLL, chronic lymphocytic leu- kemia; CML, chronic myelocytic leukemia; df, degrees of freedom; HVL, half-value layer; ICD 8, International Classification of Diseases, 8th revi- sion; LL, lymphocytic leukemia, not otherwise specified; ML, myelocytic leukemia, not otherwise specified; NHL, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma; NOS, not otherwise specified; P(,), one-sided P value; P(2), two-sided P value; PY, person-years of observation; RR, rate ratio or relative risk; SMR, standard- ized mortality ratio; SMD, standardized mortality rate difference. 4 Although it is the policy of the Journal to request that only SI units be used, we have made a small number of exceptions in the use of cGy, which is not a recommended SI unit.

Dosimetry. Dose estimation procedures were identical to those used previously (16) and for a large international study of cervical cancer pa- tients (7, 20). Photocopies of radiotherapy reports and surgical reports describing radium implant procedures were sent to a collaborating medical physicist (M.S.). Treatments were simulated for representative radium and X-ray treatment configurations, using anthropomorphic phantoms con- sisting of actual human skeletons and artificial soft tissues designed to mimic the radiation absorption and scattering properties of actual tissue. Approximately 300 thermoluminescent dosimeters were placed in a lat- tice-like network throughout the phantom in skeletal regions and other anatomical sites of interest for each simulated treatment. Dose measure- ments from these simulated treatments were used in conjunction with the treatment data to estimate dose to the active (red) bone marrow for individ- ual patients. Dose was estimated separately for 14 anatomically distinct bone marrow compartments. An average dose to the entire active marrow was estimated by taking a weighted average of dose to each of the 14 compartments using weights believed to correspond to the percentage of active bone marrow in each compartment (21). An implicit assumption is that relevant target cells for radiation carcinogenesis remained within a given marrow compartment for the duration of a course of radiotherapy. Doses to lymphatic tissues were not estimated. Estimated bone marrow doses do not include dose from radiotherapy given for other conditions, including cancer. Three hundred fifty-seven women (289 irradiated, 68 nonirradiated) are known to have received ra- diotherapy for cancer, exclusive of nonmelanoma skin cancer. Radiother- apy for cancer doubtless was underascertained, because the last available medical history for many women was at the time of discharge after treat- ment for BGD. However, none of the leukemia cases are known to have received radiotherapy for conditions other than BGD prior to the diagnosis of leukemia. One woman who died of acute leukemia was diagnosed with cancer of the uterine corpus after being irradiated for BGD and 16 years prior to her death, but we do not know whether she was given radiotherapy for the uterine cancer. Analysis. Person-years of observation (PY) for each woman began with the date of first irradiation for BGD at one of the participating hospi- tals or, for nonirradiated women, the date on which she was first diagnosed with BGD at a study hospital. If a woman had been treated with radiation for BGD prior to being treated at one of the cooperating hospitals, PY of observation began as of the latter date, although the prior radiotherapy was used to mark the date and age at first exposure. Person-years were accumu- lated until the earliest of the following dates: date of death, closing date for the study (January 1, 1985 or January 1, 1967) or, for women lost to follow-up, the most recent date known alive. Observed numbers of cancer deaths (0) and PY of observation were distributed over a matrix defined by race (white/nonwhite), quinquennia of age at observation and calendar year of observation, type of radiation treatment for BGD (none, intracavi- tary radium only, external-beam X rays only, both radium and X rays), radiation dose to active bone marrow (0, 1-25, 26-50, 51-75, 76-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, 401-1100 cGy, unknown), time since first treatment (0-1.9, 2-4.9, 5-9.9, 10-14.9, 15-19.9, 20-29.9, 30-39.9, 40- 59.9 years), and age at first treatment (13-34, 35-39, 40-44, 45-49, 50-54, 55-89 years). The first 2 years of observation after treatment were excluded from dose-response analyses for leukemia (see below), because it was believed that leukemia deaths occurring during the first 2 years after radiotherapy for BGD were unlikely to have been caused by this exposure (1). Persons with multiple radiation treatments for BGD were handled in the following way. Beginning with the date of the first radium or X-ray exposure, all radiotherapy for BGD administered during the same or following calendar year was considered as one treatment and the doses were added together. If a woman was irradiated for BGD in more than 1 calendar year separated by at least 2 years, PY of observation were truncated 2 years after the date of the second treatment, and dose from the second treatment was disre- garded. The remaining PY for such patients were considered as belonging in the unknown dose category. Most (95%) of the study population re- ceived all of their known radiotherapy for BGD in 1 calendar year. Because the numbers of deaths due to cancers of interest among nonirra- diated women were small, the analysis also incorporated information from U.S. mortality rates. Numbers of deaths expected (E) were estimated by multiplying the sex-, race-, age-, and calendar time-specific U.S. mortality rate for each stratum or cell in the matrix by the observed number of PY, and then cumulating the products over all strata. Standardized mortality rate ratios (SMRs) were estimated by dividing the number of deaths ob- served by the number expected (O/E). Confidence intervals (CIs) for SMRs were calculated according to the method described by Liddell (22). Ninety percent CIs are presented; the lower bound of a two-sided 90% CI corresponds to a 95% one-sided interval. Standardized mortality rate dif- ferences (SMDs) were estimated as (O - E)/PY. U.S. mortality rates for subtypes of leukemia were available only back to 1957, so 1957-1959 rates were used for 1925-1959. More detailed analyses were conducted with the aid of Poisson regres- sion models (23-25). The force of mortality (mortality rate, hazard) R was assumed to equal the product of a background hazard term and a relative risk term. Background hazards were assumed to be proportional to, but not equal to, race- (r), age- (a), and time (t)-specific mortality rates for U.S. females [Ro(r,a,t)]. The excess relative risk, RR - 1, was modeled as a function of radiation exposure,f(d), and a function of possible effect modi- fiers, g(z), such as age at exposure and time since exposure. The general form of the model was: R(r, a, t, d, z) = foRo(r, a, t) x [1 + f(d)g(z)], where Ro(r, a, t) is the stratum-specific U.S. rate, 00 is a parameter to be estimated, and Ad)g(z) is the excess RR. For dose-response analyses, 1Ad) was a continuous function, such as #3d, and model fit was evaluated both for the entire population (exposed + nonexposed) and among irradiated women only (dose &gt;0). For initial analyses, however, an indicator function (O3X) was used, with X = 1 if the woman was irradiated for BGD and X = 0 if she was not. Note that, in this simplified model and with g(z) = 1, 0o corresponds to the SMR for nonirradiated women and /o[1 + l1] equals the SMR for irradiated women. The RR associated with radiotherapy for BGD was estimated as 1 + f,, which is algebraically equivalent to a ratio of the SMRs. In reporting our results, we have reserved the notation RR for contrasts between irradiated and nonirradiated women and SMR for U.S. population comparisons. As a check, background hazards also were mod- eled internally, as a power function of attained age [a(Age)Y), calendar year of observation (four 15-year intervals) and race (white/nonwhite). Esti- mates of ,1 generally differed by less than 5% from those obtained when U.S. rates were used to model background hazards. This supports the valid- ity of incorporating U.S. rates into the models. If U.S. rates were not avail- able for a cause-of-death category of interest, this second parameterization was used to estimate the RR. For estimates of excess additive (absolute) risk, models of the form R(r, a, t, d, z) = 3oRo(r, a, t) +fTd)g(z) were fitted. Maximum likelihood methods were used to fit the models. Likelihood ratio tests about parameters of interest were made by comparing deviances for nested models. The difference in deviances for two nested models was assumed to be distributed as a x2 variate with degrees of freedom equal to the difference in the number of estimated parameters. Likelihood-based confidence intervals were obtained by the reverse procedure, that is, by iteratively searching the likelihood surface for combinations of parameter values that resulted in a predetermined change in the deviance. These tasks were accomplished with the aid of the program AMFIT (25). RESULT Radiation dose and dose rate.

Dose to the pelvis accounted for nearly three-quarters (73%) of the overall, or weighted, mean marrow dose; the lumbar vertebra (19%) and upper femur (5%) were the other major contributors. These per- centages differed slightly between brachytherapy and exter- nal-beam therapy. Although we report a single, mean dose for the pelvis, there was a large dose gradient within the pelvic bones for a given woman. Average marrow dose was substantially lower for women treated by radium than for those treated by X rays or radium plus X rays (Table I). Marrow doses from radium treatments tended to be higher in the 1940s and 1950s than during the 1920s and 1930s (Fig. 1). The radium was encased in metal filters, typically 0.5 mm silver and 1 mm brass in the 1920s and 1930s, and 1 mm platinum in the 1940s and 1950s. Only the -y rays ema- nating from the radium would have reached the body tis- sues. Radium treatments typically lasted for between 10 and 24 h, which translates into continuous dose rates on the order of several centigrays per hour. Orthovoltage X rays (200 kVp, 0.9-1.0 mm Cu HVL) were delivered in I to 10 fractions over a period of I day to 6 weeks, but usually within several days. A variety of treat- ment plans were used, but the following three plans were typical for the two institutions that accounted for most of the external-beam therapy: (1) one fraction (exposure) of 600 cGy given dose to one central anterior field (25 x 20 cm); (2) central anterior and posterior fields (25 x 20 cm), with 600 cGy given dose to anterior field on Day I and 600 cGy given dose to posterior field on Day 2; (3) right and left anterior and posterior fields (13 x 20 cm); each field treated with 600 cGy air dose, one field treated per day for a total treatment time of 4 days. Depending on the exact duration of individual X-ray exposures, dose rates would have been two to three orders of magnitude greater than for radium treatments. For the women treated with both radium and X rays, the radium and X-ray treatments usually were given as part of the same course of therapy, although in some instances the two were separated by an interval of months. The mean dose from radium for these women was 62 cGy and the mean dose from X rays was 141 cGy. Follow-up and cause-specific mortality. Nearly 65% of the women are known to have died prior to the closing date for the analysis (Table II). An additional 20% were con- firmed alive as of that date, while 15% were lost to follow- up. The average age at entry (diagnosis or treatment for BGD) was similar for irradiated and nonirradiated patients (46 years), but the average calendar year of entry was 5</page><page sequence="5">112 INSKIP ET AL. 300 250 r9/ 200 / 0 ~ 150 Cm 100 5o0 .. * .....

The average period of follow-up was 24 to 25 years; 4232 irradiated women (43%) and 1349 nonirradiated women (42%) were followed for more than 30 years. Sixty-four leukemia deaths were recorded among the irradiated women (Table III); of these, 40 (62%) were certi- fied to be acute or myelocytic leukemia and 17 (27%) to be CLL or lymphocytic leukemia, NOS (LL). Among nonirra- diated patients, seven deaths due to leukemia were ob- served, of which three (43%) were acute or myelocytic and four (57%) were CLL or LL. There were, in addition, two instances of myelocytic leukemia and one case of ALL mentioned incidentally on death certificates of irradiated women whose deaths were attributed to causes other than hematological cancer (two treated by radium with doses of 48 and 64 cGy, and one by radium and X rays, dose = 170 cGy). There were no additional cases of acute, myelocytic, or monocytic leukemia reported on death certificates of nonirradiated women. As an aside, we note that the review of hospital charts revealed apparent instances of CML evolving into acute leukemia; two irradiated women whose deaths were certified to AML had been diagnosed with CML within the preceding 2 years. Numbers of deaths cer- tified to lymphomas, multiple myeloma and myeloprolifer- ative diseases also are shown in Table III. Among the nonirradiated patients, the total number of deaths and the number certified to cancer were similar to the numbers expected based on U.S. mortality rates (Table IV). The slightly higher overall SMR among irradiated pa- tients is explained largely by their 33% excess mortality due to cancer. Cancers of hematopoietic and lymphopoietic tis- sue (ICD 8 200-209) accounted for 14% (51/361) of this excess. Although numbers of deaths due to specific types of hematological cancer are small, especially among the non- irradiated women, several general patterns are noted. Lym- phoid malignancies, including Hodgkin's disease, non- Hodgkin's lymphoma5 (NHL), multiple myeloma, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, occurred slightly more of- ten than expected among both irradiated and nonirradiated women. In most cases, SMRs did not differ significantly from 1.0 (P(2) &gt; 0.05), but excesses occurred consistently in the different disease categories. There was little evidence of differences between exposed and nonexposed women with respect to SMRs for these cancers. Restricting analysis to the New York subpopulation, which includes all of the nonirradiated patients, did not change this finding. Only for leukemia, and more specifically for the acute, myelocytic and monocytic subtypes (AL + CML),6 were there marked difference in SMRs by treatment category. Only 3 deaths due to AL + CML were observed in the nonirradiated group, versus 6.6 expected based on U.S. rates (SMR = 0.5; 90% CI 0.1-1.2). Among the exposed women, there were 40 such deaths (or 39 if the woman with myelocytic leukemia diagnosed prior to radiotherapy for BGD is excluded), versus 23.0 expected (SMR = 1.7; 90% CI 1.3-2.3). The RR for AL + CML, contrasting irradiated with nonirradiated women, was 3.7 (90% CI 1.6-12). Other clonal hemopathies, including polycythemia vera and myeloid metaplasia with myelofibrosis, taken together, did not occur in substantial excess among irradiated women (Table IV), but numbers were too small to estimate the RR with much precision. Similarly, only six deaths due to aplastic anemia, a manifestation of hemopoietic stem cell depletion or suppression (26), were observed among irradiated women versus zero among nonirradiated women (Table IV). One death due to aplastic anemia occurred within 2 weeks after radiotherapy for BGD; the other five occurred 16 to 44 years after treatment. Hematology review. Materials for a hematology review were obtained for 50 of the 64 irradiated women whose deaths were attributed to leukemia and for all 7 of the non- irradiated women.

For present purposes, it is synonomous with "acute plus nonlymphocytic.".</page><page sequence="6">HEMATOLOGICAL CANCERS AFTER PELVIC RADIOTHERAPY 113 TABLE II Follow-Up Data for Study Population of Women Treated for Benign Gynecological Disorders Irradiated Nonirradiated All patients patients patients Number of women 9,770 3,185 12,955 Average age at entry 46.5 46.2 46.5 Average year of entry 1940 1945 1941 Person-years of observation 246,821 75,552 322,373 Average years of observation 25.3 23.7 24.9 Vital status as of January 1, 1985" Number known alive 1,697 (17.4%) 917 (28.8%) 2,614 (20.2%) Number known dead 6,649 (68.0%) 1,709 (53.7%) 8,358 (64.5%) Number with status unknown 1,424 (14.6%)b 559 (17.5%)b 1,983 (15.3%) a January 1, 1967 for the subgroup of 1066 women for whom follow-up could not be extended (see text). b 170 of the nonirradiated patients and 31 of the irradiated patients were lost to follow-up immediately after treatment for BGD and contributed 0 person-years of observation to the study. corresponding percentages were 68% (44/65) and 61% (14/ 23). Based on this review, none of the deaths certified to acute, myelocytic, or monocytic leukemia were judged to belong outside of this inclusive category. However, one nonirradiated woman whose death was attributed to lym- phocytic leukemia, NOS was judged to have had acute leu- kemia, NOS. Of the other four deaths certified to LL, three were classified as CLL, and one as lymphosarcoma. Among irradiated patients, one death certified to CLL and two deaths certified to Hodgkin's disease were attributed, upon review, to lymphosarcoma. Conversely, one death coded to lymphosarcoma among nonirradiated women was reclassi- fied as CLL, and one such death among irradiated women was recoded to Hodgkin's disease. Of six deaths certified to leukemia, not otherwise specified (NOS), two were judged upon review to have been CLL, one lymphosarcoma, one myeloid metaplasia, one refractory dysmyelopoietic ane- mia, and one "miliary tuberculosis with leukemoid reac- tion." Review materials were not available for the sixth case. Twelve of 22 cases of multiple myeloma were re- viewed, and the death certificate diagnosis was confirmed in each case. Because we reviewed only cases in which death was attributed to a hematological cancer (ICD 8 200-209), we cannot assess the extent to which deaths due to leuke- mia, lymphoma, or multiple myeloma were incorrectly at- tributed to causes outside this grouping. Acute plus nonlymphocytic leukemia. The point esti- mate of the rate ratio for AL + CML varies by a factor of more than two, depending on whether the reference experi- ence is based exclusively on the general U.S. population or also takes account of the limited, but probably more simi- lar, population of nonirradiated BGD patients from the same part of the country. The small size of the latter group means that even one additional or fewer case would have considerable influence on the point estimate. For example, inclusion of the case of acute leukemia ascertained during the hematology review would increase the SMR for non- irradiated women to 0.6 and lower the RR from 3.7 to 2.8. A review of leukemia mortality data over the whole of the United States (27) did not show rates for western New York or neighboring states to have been unusually low, and it is doubtful that the true SMR for nonirradiated BGD patients in the northeastern U.S. was as low as 0.5-0.6. Because of the small size of the nonirradiated group, results presented below for various subgroups are given in terms of SMRs rather than RRs. The estimated SMR for AL + CML varied little, from 1.5 to 2.0, among the four states in which radiotherapy for BGD was administered, even though the respective mean marrow doses varied by a factor of 2 to 3 (Table V). Most of the experience documented in this study pertains to women treated by radium only; the PY of observation and expected number of leukemia deaths for the X-ray and combined modality groups are small. The SMR was similar for women treated with radium only and those treated by both modalities, even though mean marrow dose differed by a factor of 3, and was smallest for X-ray patients, the group with the highest average dose. However, heterogeneity of the SMR by modality of treatment was not significant (x2, 2 df= 1.71; P(2) = 0.43). For the acute and nonlymphocytic leukemias combined, the SMR was highest 2 to 5 years after irradiation, and point estimates dropped steadily over the next 15 years [P(j) (trend) = 0.09 for time &gt; 2 years] (Table V; Fig. 2, upper panel). However, the excess did not disappear entirely dur- ing the later intervals. Approximately one-third of the ex- cess deaths occurred 20 or more years after exposure, and data are consistent with a leveling off of the SMR at or about 1.5 after 15 to 20 years.

Estimates of the SMD initially dropped with time (Fig. 2, upper panel) but then rebounded in later intervals as the cohort matured into the ages of high background mortality rates for leukemia. For example, the SMD was 1.48 per 104 PY for years 2 to 4.9 after irradiation, 0.03 per 104 PY for years 15 to 19, and 1.75 per 104 PY for years 40 to 59. The early peak in the SMR was attributable primarily to chronic myelocytic leukemia (Fig. 2, middle panel), and there was little excess CML after the first 15 years following irradiation (SMR for years 2 to 15 = 5.1, based on 10 cases; SMR for years &gt; 15 = 1.1, based on 5 cases). The decreasing trend in relative risk for CML + ML was significant (P(1) = 0.02). The SMR for acute leukemia varied within more narrow limits (Fig. 2, lower panel) and was nearly equal for years 2 to 15 after irradiation and years 15 to 59 (SMR = 1.54 versus 1.57). However, the absolute excess risk for AL, as represented by the SMD, increased after the first 10 years. For the inclusive category CML + AL, therefore, most of the excess additive (absolute) risk was due to CML during years 2 to 15 after irradiation, and due to AL during later intervals. The SMR was higher among women who were irradiated after the age of 50 years than for younger women (Table V). Women irradiated at older ages were observed, on average, for shorter periods of time. After adjustment for time since exposure and radiation dose, the association between SMR and age at exposure, though still positive, was not signifi- cant (P(2) = 0.22). Most (63%) of the excess leukemia mortality occurred among women who were irradiated during the 1940s (Table V). Average marrow dose from all modalities of radiother- apy combined was not unusually high during this period, but the average dose from radium treatments was higher at that time. Indeed, the average dose increased steadily from 40 cGy in the 1920s to 85 cGy in 1950-1965 (Fig. 1). Although the SMR for AL + CML clearly was higher for irradiated women than for nonirradiated women, an in- creasing trend in SMR with increasing dose among irra- diated women was not apparent (P(l) = 0.39), and data are consistent with a uniform SMR (and RR) over a dose range spanning several hundred centigrays (Table VI, Fig. 3). This observation applies for AL and CML separately, as well as collectively. For AL, the SMRs (and observed num- bers of deaths) for the dose categories 0, 1-50, 51-100, 101- 200 and &gt;,200 cGy were 0.4 (O = 2 deaths), 1.5 (5), 1.7 (11), 1.5 (5), and 2.1 (4). Corresponding values for CML + ML were 0.6 (1), 3.6 (5), 2.1 (5), 1.5 (2), and 2.6 (2). Most of the women who received an average marrow dose of less than 100 cGy were treated by radium only, while most of the women with higher doses were treated with X rays, alone or in combination with radium. Because the dose-response relationship might differ by modality of radiotherapy, separate analyses were performed for each type of treatment. Unfortunately, within a given modality, sample size was quite small, and doses for individual women were clustered centrally around median doses. This lack of spread limited our ability to detect a gradient in RR among exposed women, assuming such a gradient to exist. Data for women treated by radium only or radium plus X rays were mildly suggestive of a positive association with dose (Fig. 3); however, when analysis was restricted to irra- diated women (dose &gt;0), none of the modality-specific slopes was significantly different from zero. Pooling results for all women treated by radium (with or without X rays) and evaluating RR in relation to the radium dose only, still did not yield evidence of a dose-response relationship.

The SMRs for cancers of lymphoid tissue fluctuated erratically over time after treatment for BGD (Table VIII), except for lym- phosarcoma plus reticulum cell sarcoma, for which the SMR increased with time. However, the SMR for nonirra- diated women also was highest 30 or more years after treat- ment. There was no sign of an excess of multiple myeloma associated with radiotherapy, even during late post-treat- ment intervals. There was no evidence of a monotonic trend in the SMR with mean marrow dose for any of the lymphoreticular cancers (Fig. 4).

DISCUSSION Interpretation of these results is influenced strongly by findings for the nonirradiated women, even though num- bers of deaths due to specific cancers among nonexposed patients were small. When the experience of irradiated women was contrasted with that of the U.S. population, the emergent picture was of a rather uniform, nonspecific ex- cess across the different categories of leukemia and lym- phoma. Contrasts with the experience of nonirradiated women, however, point toward greater specificity of effect. Only the excess mortality due to acute leukemia and chronic myelocytic leukemia was associated with radiother- apy. For chronic lymphocytic leukemia, Hodgkin's disease, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and multiple myeloma, there was little evidence of differences in risks between irradiated and nonirradiated women, and estimates of the RR were in the vicinity of 1.0. Although 1.5- to 3-fold relative risks for these lymphoid cancers could not be ruled out, based on 90% CIs, results reinforce an already substantial body of evidence indicating that CLL and Hodgkin's disease are not readily induced by ionizing radiation (1, 2), and weigh in on the negative side of a conflicting literature concerning multi- ple myeloma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (see below). The low SMR for acute and myelocytic leukemia among nonirradiated women indicates that these BGD patients were not at substantially increased risk of dying from AL + CML, independent of radiotherapy. Apparently, few, if any, cases of dysfunctional uterine bleeding could be attrib- uted to leukemia or a related hemorrhagic diathesis (10), and anemia consequent to menorrhagia did not predispose to leukemia. The latter seemed possible in light of the sever- ity of some cases of anemia (11), the possibility that com- pensatory physiological responses include recruitment of reserve stem cells and shortening of cell cycling time (28), and the presumed inverse relationship between lability of the stem cell genome and duration of resting, or Go, stage (29). Although the nonirradiated group was large enough to indicate that the study population was not especially predis- posed to leukemia, it was still too small for precise descrip- tion of the background, or baseline, level of risk, and esti- mates of effects attributable to irradiation are sensitive to this uncertainty. The lesser than expected mortality due to leukemia other than CLL + LL among nonirradiated women might be attributable to chance but also serves as a warning of possible unidentified bias in the study, such as due to nonuniform distribution of unmeasured determi- nants of leukemia mortality or differential ascertainment of leukemia deaths among subgroups of the study population. The temporal pattern in relative risk for AL + CML was typical of that observed after acute radiation exposures, with the highest values occurring within the first few years after irradiation, a fall-off in later intervals, but a residual excess even 30 or more years after exposure. A qualitatively similar time-response pattern has been reported for the A- bomb survivors (4) and ankylosing spondylitis patients (9). Even relatively small excess relative risks during late postir- radiation periods translate into substantial excess additive risks when background rates are increasing sharply with time, as they do for the age range encompassed by this study. Overall, the average excess absolute risk among these BGD patients was 1.2 deaths per 104 PY Gy, and the esti- mated RR at 100 cGy was 3.9.</page><page sequence="11">118 INSKIP ET AL.

Add 2 years to mean to get time since treatment. c Excludes woman diagnosed with leukemia prior to radiotherapy for BGD. An earlier, more sharply defined peak in the RR for CML than for AL has been a repeated finding after irradiation in middle age. This was seen for leukemia incidence among the A-bomb survivors (30) and is apparent in mortality data for spondylitis patients (9). Differences in time response by subtype of leukemia might be expected to be blurred at the level of mortality, because, first, the average interval from diagnosis to death is longer for CML than for AL, especially AML (26), and, second, cases of CML that terminate with a blast-cell crisis sometimes are attributed to AL on death certificates. Still, a difference between CML and AL similar to that seen in other studies was seen among these BGD patients. Whereas an earlier analysis for a subset of this study popu- lation found a significant positive association between the SMR and age the at irradiation (16), such a relationship was not apparent in the combined data. Results provide strong evidence of a difference in risk of AL + CML between irradiated and nonirradiated patients, but rather ambiguous evidence pertaining to the shape or existence of a dose-response relationship. When all modali- ties of radiotherapy were combined, the SMR did not ap- pear to be associated with average marrow dose. However, dose was strongly correlated with modality of treatment, and there are a priori reasons for stratifying by modality of treatment, including differences in temporal and anatomi- cal distribution of dose and in energies of the -y and X rays associated with brachytherapy and external-beam therapy, respectively. Unfortunately, these data are not rich enough to enable us to evaluate possible effect modification by mo- dality of treatment and the associated influence of dose frac- tionation and protraction. If the dose-response relationship for pelvic radiotherapy is indeed flat over the observed range of doses, estimates of the average excess RR per centi- gray, with their implied commitment to a linear dose-re- sponse model, would have limited application. Protraction or fractionation of dose might contribute to flattening of the dose-response relationship, by allowing</page><page sequence="12">HEMATOLOGICAL CANCERS AFTER PELVIC RADIOTHERAPY 119 All Modalities 6 4 10 16 7 2 0o1 Radium Only 0 6 "0 10 7 4 9 2 X Rays Only N 6 2~ 2 ....... ....... ................... ..... . 0o Radium &amp; X Rays 6 4 2 - 0 5 0 100 200 300 400 Dose (cGy) FIG. 3.

The zero dose point in each graph is for the nonirradiated women. There were three leukemia deaths among nonirra- diated women. The number of leukemia deaths in each dose interval is shown above or adjacent to the CI, and dose intervals are as shown in Table VIII. The horizontal dotted line at SMR = 1.0 is included for refer- ence. time for repair of subtransformational or sublethal damage, or for changes in the population of exposed stem cells (31- 33). Mole and Major (33) reported the occurrence of AML in '-irradiated mice to be independent of dose when radia- tion exposures were protracted over several weeks and sug- gested that the irregular dose-response pattern observed for the excess leukemia that occurred among persons irradiated for ankylosing spondylitis (8) might be explained by the fractionated, protracted nature of their X-ray treatments. Mole (34) later reported that protraction of dose over even a 22-h period sharply reduced the yield of leukemia among irradiated mice. In the present study, radium treatments were associated with continuous low-dose-rate exposures lasting a matter of hours, usually 10 to 24 h. X-ray treat- ments, on the other hand, involved one or several brief exposures, each involving a very high dose rate, followed by extended intervals (1 or more days) of no exposure to radio- TABLE VII Excess Relative (RR) and Additive (AR) Risk Coefficients for AL + CML, by Modality of Radiotherapy, Based on Women for Whom Doses Could Be Estimated Modality of Excess RR, Excess AR, radiotherapy %/cGy (90% CI) per 106 PY/cGy (90% CI) Radium only 3.7 (-1.0,a 15) 1.5 (0.3,a 2.9) X rays only 0.5 (-0.6,a 3.3) 0.1 (-0.2,a 0.6) Radium + X rays 2.1 (0.5, 8.3) 1.0 (0.3," 1.9) All modalitiesb 2.9 1.2 Notes. The first 2 years after irradiation were excluded. Models for each modality were fitted independently and included nonexposed women. When analysis was restricted to women with marrow dose &gt;0, lower risk estimates were obtained and none were significantly different from zero. Excess RR estimates were 0.2% per cGy (P(,) = 0.43) and 0.6% per cGy (P(,) = 0.17) for women treated by radium and combined modalities, respec- tively. Parameter estimates failed to converge in the model for women treated by X rays only, but the "excess" RR estimate appeared to be in the vicinity of -0. 1% per cGy. When the SMR was constrained to equal 1.0 at zero dose, the excess SMR per unit dose was 1.4%/cGy for radium-treated patients, 0.0%/cGy for women irradiated with X rays, and 0.8%/cGy for those treated by both modalities.

The radiobiological implications of these differ- ences, from the standpoint of leukemogenesis, are unclear. Survivors of the atomic bomb explosions in Japan re- ceived radiation exposures that were nearly instantaneous and approximately uniform throughout the bone marrow. A strong positive dose-response relationship for leukemia mortality was observed, with a suggestion of a downturn in RR at doses greater than 200 cGy (4). The estimated RR at 100 cGy for women age 40 years or older at the time of the bombing was 4.4. This compares closely with the value of 4.7 obtained for BGD patients in the present study who were treated by radium only (mean marrow dose generally &lt; 100 cGy), but is higher than the estimate of 1.5 for women treated by X rays only, for whom mean doses generally were &gt;200 cGy. It should be noted too that the average excess SMR among radium-treated patients (1.4% per cen- tigray) was substantially lower than the excess RR. Caution in interpretation of the relatively low SMR for women treated by X rays is indicated by the small sample size and correspondingly broad 90% CI, and literature re- ports of higher SMRs for leukemia among other BGD pa- tients treated by X rays (35, 36). In view of the large statisti- cal uncertainties, the risks per unit dose for the X-ray pa- tients are consistent with those for the radium patients. Nonetheless, it is not surprising that risk estimates (per cen- tigray) were higher for radium treatments. Cumulative</page><page sequence="13">120 INSKIP ET AL.

If doses of 100 to 200 cGy sterilize upward of 50% of marrow stem cells (37, 38), exter- nal-beam treatments for BGD might have delivered steriliz- ing doses to a high proportion of stem cells in the vicinity of the pelvis, but only weakly leukemogenic doses to stem cells outside of this volume, to borrow an idea from Hutchison (6) and Smith (39) concerning the lower than expected risk of leukemia among irradiated cervical cancer patients. Ster- ilizing effects from radium treatments likely would have been less and coupled with more leukemogenic doses to other, nearby marrow compartments. One would have predicted a positive association between RR and mean marrow dose among BGD patients based on findings for irradiated cervical cancer patients (7), the popu- lation most similar to BGD patients in terms of the spatio- temporal distribution of dose and energy of radiation. The same modalities of radiotherapy were used, although in dif- ferent proportions (&gt;70% combined brachytherapy and X- ray therapy among cervical cancer patients), and, although the average marrow dose was sevenfold higher for the cervi- cal cancer patients, the mean marrow dose bears a consis- tent proportional relationship to the dose to any particular volume of marrow for both populations. In that study, the overall RR of AL + CML incidence associated with an aver- age marrow dose of 710 cGy was 2.0 (average excess RR = 0.14% per centigray). The RR increased for average marrow doses up to approximately 400 cGy (RR 2.5) and decreased at higher doses. At these higher doses, cell- sterilizing effects of radiation are presumed to counter the cell-transforming effects. Very few irradiated cervical cancer patients received mean marrow doses less than 100 cGy. In this regard, results for the two populations are com- plementary.

The horizontal dotted line at SMR = 1.0 is included for reference. RR associated with pelvic radiotherapy reaches values of 2 to 3 at mean doses well under 400 cGy, at least among women treated with radium. Measurement error might explain, in part, the failure to detect a dose-response relationship in the present study. Cristy (21) stressed that information presented on the ana- tomical distribution of active marrow be taken as "rough estimates". If those estimates are in substantial error, then the weights we used to estimate mean marrow dose are wrong. However, the measurement problem appears to go beyond this. Experimental work (32, 33) suggests that dose rate is also of central importance. It might be that spatially and temporally heterogeneous exposures that are high enough to induce local cell killing and also sufficiently pro- tracted over time to allow for change in the population of exposed stem cells through cell division and/or migration (28, 33), defy simple, unidimensional characterization, such as in terms of weighted mean marrow dose, or even in terms of an array of marrow compartment-specific doses. The dosimetry used in the present study was premised on a static set of potential target cells. A more refined dosimetry, if possible, would seem to require greater attention to the dynamic nature of the hemopoietic stem cell population and the manner in which it responds to injury. Why mortality rates for lymphoreticular cancers were greater among these BGD patients than among women in the U.S. population as a whole is unclear. Elevated rates are not characteristic of the northeastern U.S. in general. For example, mortality rates due to lymphoma, multiple my- eloma and CLL among residents of Connecticut for the years 1973-1977 were similar to average rates for all SEER areas combined (40). Diagnosis of these cancers might be more likely in populations with greater access to, or ten- dency to seek, medical care. Other authors have noted posi- tive associations between socioeconomic status (SES) and risk of lymphoid cancers, possibly related to differences in completeness of cancer ascertainment (41, 42). Multiple myeloma can be difficult to diagnose (43). Because type of treatment received for BGD was associated with hospital, it is possible that correlates of hospital such as region or SES are confounding some of the associations that we observed. All of the nonirradiated women were treated at one hospital in western New York, whereas the irradiated women came from many hospitals throughout the Northeast. However, restricting analysis to the New York subpopulation did not change the finding of no apparent difference between ex- posed and nonexposed women with respect to risk of dying from a cancer of lymphatic tissue. A biological connection between determinants of BGD and the pathogenesis of cancers of lymphatic tissue, such as through an imbalance of steroid hormones, is also a possibility, although it should be noted that most lymphoreticular cancers occur more of- ten among men than among women (5). Whatever the ex- planation, our earlier, unexpected finding of an excess of CLL among irradiated BGD patients based on comparisons with U.S. rates (16) now seems less at odds with the litera- ture; overall, CLL occurrence was not associated with radio- therapy in the present study. Whereas studies of different irradiated populations have been consistently negative for CLL and Hodgkin's disease, results and views in the literature are mixed about multiple myeloma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Among women treated for cervical cancer, the incidence of multiple my- eloma was not associated with radiotherapy (44); indeed, the RR contrasting high marrow dose (&gt;200 cGy) and lower-dose (&lt;200 cGy) groups was 0.3 (90% CI 0.0-2.6). The corresponding RR for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma was 2.5 (90% CI 0.8-7.6), but there was little evidence of dose response. Radiotherapy for cervical cancer delivered very large incidental doses to parts of the bone marrow and lym- phatic tissue (7). The large doses might have resulted in temporary immunosuppression, and immunosuppression is a risk factor for NHL (45); thus irradiation might have acted indirectly to increase lymphoma risk (44). Among persons irradiated for ankylosing spondylitis (predomi- nantly males), the observed number of deaths due to multi- ple myeloma 5 or more years after irradiation slightly ex- ceeded the number expected based on general population rates (SMR = 1.7; 90% CI 0.9-3.1), and a more substantial excess (SMR = 2.2, 90% CI 1.4-3.4) was recorded for lym- phomas, exclusive of Hodgkin's disease (9). Again, the average marrow dose was relatively high, about 320 cGy, with extremely high doses to parts of the marrow (8). A</page><page sequence="15">122 INSKIP ET AL. statistically significant positive dose-response relationship between RR of death due to multiple myeloma and radia- tion dose was reported for the atomic bomb survivors (4), although the slope was flatter for women than for men. There was no evidence of excess mortality due to radiogenic lymphoma (ICD 8 200-202). Similarly, mortality due to multiple myeloma (but not NHL) was positively associated with cumulative exposure to external sources of radiation among workers at nuclear facilities in the U.S. (46) and the UK (47). Mean doses for these populations were extremely low, in the tens of millisieverts, but, in each case, the associa- tion could be attributed largely to a very small number of deaths in the highest dose categories (100-400 mSv) and the possibility of confounding by other occupational exposures could not be ruled out. Matanoski et al. (48) reported excess multiple myeloma among radiologists who began practice between 1930 and 1949, but not in earlier years, when doses presumably were higher. However, neither multiple my- eloma nor NHL occurred in excess among medical X-ray workers in China (49). Overall, the evidence linking NHL and multiple my- eloma to low or intermediate doses of sparsely ionizing irra- diation is not convincing. The possibility of differences in the likelihood of cancer ascertainment for populations under varying degrees of medical surveillance undermines comparisons with general population experience. Concerns about comparability of exposed and reference populations also arise for some of the studies of occupationally exposed groups, and other results are conflicting or based on very small numbers. Radiation is a known clastogen that deposits energy at random within cells. Specific chromosomal rearrange- ments resulting in the activation or deregulation of particu- lar growth-regulatory genes appear to be key elements in the etiology of human leukemias and lymphomas (50, 51), unlike most solid (nonhemic) cancers, for which loss or inactivation of tumor suppressor genes appears to be more important than specific translocations (52). All of the classes of terminally differentiated hemopoietic cells, in- cluding granulocytes, macrophages, monocytes, lympho- cytes and erythrocytes, as well as platelets, are produced throughout adult life, and all are believed to derive from precursor cells in the bone marrow; yet the direct carcino- genic effects of pelvic radiotherapy appear to be confined largely to certain of these lineages. In the present study, radiotherapy for benign gynecological disorders was asso- ciated with excess AML and CML, but not with CLL, lym- phoma, or multiple myeloma. The apparently wide varia- tion in likelihood of radiation-induced cancers of the various differentiated cell types raises questions about the identity, anatomical distribution, and susceptibility of rele- vant target or stem cells, and about lineage-specific develop- mental processes or microenvironments that lead to differ- ential expression of radiation-induced damage. It is unclear whether the multipotent cell that gives rise to myelocytic leukemias and other myeloproliferative dis- orders, such as polycythemia vera and myeloid metaplasia, also is ancestral to the lymphoid line, or whether there is a still more primitive cell that gives rise to both lineages (53- 56). Abramson et al. (5 7) presented evidence supporting the idea that there exist restricted stem cells committed to my- eloid and lymphoid (T-lymphocyte) lineages, respectively, as well as pluripotent7 (or totipotent) stem cells. Others have observed that, unlike with the myeloid lineage, matu- ration of cells in the lymphoid lineage may proceed without loss of proliferative potential, and that even long-lived B and T lymphocytes might serve as target cells for carcino- gens (56, 59). Given the possible importance of extramedul- lary lymphoid tissue (spleen, thymus, lymph nodes) in the pathogenesis of lymphoreticular cancers, dose to active bone marrow might not be the most appropriate scale over which to assess dose response for lymphoid cancers. None- theless, in the present study, even the overall, or summary, RRs for lymphoma and multiple myeloma, contrasting irradiated and nonirradiated patients, were close to 1.0. Perhaps additional and, in the case of these BGD patients, rate-limiting steps are required for a lymphoid cell with a specific chromosomal rearrangement to gain a proliferative advantage. Possibly relevant differences between myeloid and lymphoid lineages include differences in turnover rate of cells (much greater in granulocytes than in lymphocytes with, perhaps, less opportunity for repair of damage to pro- genitor cells), and in the involvement in immunological processes. Nowell [Ref. (51), p. 517] speculated that most dominantly acting oncogenes "will prove to be lineage-spe- cific." Although leukemia is a well-documented sequela of irra- diation, few epidemiological studies have quantified risk in terms of radiation dose received by the bone marrow. The A-bomb data are consistent with a linear-quadratic dose response over the range 0 to 200 cGy, with risk per unit of radiation dose being higher at higher doses, and downward curvature at doses &gt;200 cGy (1, 4). The data for cervical cancer suggest a complex dose response combining induc- tion at low doses and a downturn due to cell killing at high doses (7). The data for ankylosing spondylitis (8) provide little evidence for a dose-response relationship, although risk was elevated at all dose levels. The current study adds to the limited available data, showing that risk is elevated after pelvic exposures, but, again, clear evidence of a dose- response relationship is lacking. Nonetheless, the study is unique, providing estimates of risk at a dose level lower than for the cervical cancer and spondylitis patients, and for 7 Holtzer (58) argues that pluripotency is a property of lineages, not of cells, and that any given cell type can generate at most two new types of cells.</page><page sequence="16">HEMATOLOGICAL CANCERS AFTER PELVIC RADIOTHERAPY 123 protracted or fractionated exposures, thus different from the A-bomb data.
