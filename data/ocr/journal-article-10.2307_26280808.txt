<plain_text><page sequence="1">Pathelinian Semiotics: Elements for an Analysis of Maistre Pierre Pathelin Larry S. Crist y-* TRUCTURALIST ANALYSIS of medieval narrative is no longer like, to borrow from Doctor Johnson, a dog walking on its hind legs, so that, far from being impressed if it is adequately done, we are simply amazed that it is done at all... But those acquainted to even a small degree with such (structuralist) analyses are aware of their painstaking, if not painful, nature1 : A. J. Greimas' last exercise, on the six pages of Les Deux Amis of Maupassant, occupies some 255 pages. I cannot pretend to do a structuralist analysis of Maistre Pierre Pathelin (1599 octosyllables) in the compass of an article. What I shall attempt to do is to set forth some general observations concerning 1) the manifest system of exchange established at the beginning of the play and 2) the basic story/stories as system. This is all very clearly work in progress, far from an exhaustive report, and I hope its loose structure will be forgiven.2 In a system of production of clothing, there are four necessary stages, beginning with the production of the raw material, whose anthropo 1.

With specialization comes a separate operator for each step, with exchange of a counter-value for the transformations (overseeing and shearing, weaving, cutting and sewing). In such a linear economy, the shepherd protects the sheep, takes them to pasture and water, and cuts off their wool. He would be able to feed and clothe himself from "his" flock, and from turning the rest of the fleece over to the weaver, receive payment enough to vary his menu and to provide shelter as well as a few non-essential items for himself. The weaver would exchange his cloth either to the tailor for further elab oration on order (after first having clothing made for himself), or directly to the client, who would then seek out a tailor. In an age earlier than our own, a "non-modern" one, the process is usuauy tne lauer, me tailor being at the client's choice — and thus service — rather than the client being bound by the tailor's possible stock of cloth. Of course, the tailoring may be performed inside a family by the wife, who for her services receives a counter-value, "protection." In any sense of necessary transformations, the middle operator on my list is the least necessary ; he is a mere distributor. But, that notwith standing, the actual social system in effect through most of later Western 70 Fall 1978</page><page sequence="3">Crist civilization makes of the middleman the dominant figure: controlling the supply available for the client by varying his orders to both weaver and shepherd. The shepherd is no free agent ; he is the hired hand of the clothier, to whom both animals and (doubtless) grazing land (even if rented) "belong." The middleman is, of course, the shaman of capitalist society. To the naked (naïve) eye, he is a magician. Adding nothing physical to the items he assembles, he compels producers (and first-transformers) to cede to him their products (as transformed), so that he can merely hand them over to the consumer, pocketing a nice profit (plus-value) in the ex change. For doing nothing (but handing over, which the weaver could have done directly) he receives much. This modified quinquipartite system has been reduced in Pathelin to a tripartite one, by the factoring out of the transformers of the material : clothing t Utiliser = Client ^ Tailor ^ cloth ) cloth Transformers Producer = Shepherd cloth ^ Clothier Weaver ^ wool wool J To each arrow on this second schema, indicating transfer of material, should correspond an arrow in inverse direction, indicating transfer of counter-value. The client must "pay" two persons, and the clothier must pay another two. Since the transformers have been omitted here, this leaves client and clothier each to pay just one; the former to pay the latter and the latter to pay the shepherd. The consumer is the final receiver of the object produced (the middle man being the receiver of the monetary — semi-abstract — counterpart). But Pathelin the final receiver has a role title as well, that of "lawyer" (the exact status of this title applied to him in the play is one I will not take up here). This role, in general, is like unto that of the capitalist Vol. XVIII, No. 3 71</page><page sequence="4">L'Esprit Créateur middleman, who mediates between producer and consumer and profits thereby. We must note that the farce's economic system recycles itself — at least abortively — in that the counter-value (money/gold) with the trans fer of which Pathelin would enter "correctly" into the system comes from the socially lowest actor: the shepherd promises to pay Pathelin for his services as lawyer. He thus becomes a client to Pathelin (on the isotopy of "law"), as the latter was a client to the clothier (on the isotopy of "merchandise"). In an ideal — Solomonic (or Sanctoludovican, in which the lawyer's elm is replaced by the judge's oak)-—system, it is the judge who mediates between accuser and accused and who establishes justice by declaring on which side the truth is to be found. In the Pathelin system, it is the "lawyer" who establishes a seeming system of truth/nontruth. He does this by manipulating words ; indeed, here, he does this by ex changing (confusing) isotopies of discourse. The exchange system is thwarted at its three points, in a refusal of counter-value for services rendered. If we reestablish the diegesis, replac ing things in their "historic" ("real") time order as distinguished from the order in which the literary work presents them (based often on esthetic or "psychological" considerations), we have: Payment Service Shepherd *- Clothier barter economy 1) Shepherd Clothier food and clothing (physical) keeping sheep not fulfilled non-elaboration (physical) Clothier *- Pathelin 2) Clothier -» Pathelin cloth money (and dinner) elaboration - physical not ,ul,il,ed ! money economy 3) Pathelin -* Shepherd Pathelin - Shepherd J (abstract) "advocasserie" money elaboration/interpretation - linguistic not fulfilled (abstract) I C) = exchange; = exchange aborted/not-fulfilled on the given side] 72 fALL iy/K</page><page sequence="5">Crist We must note that exchange 1 is to be understood as unfulfilled, and thus that a misdeed is committed against the shepherd only on the basis of our accepting his own statement to Pathelin: "[I]l me paioit petite ment..." (v. 1088). I maintain that we are forced by the text to read as I do here, thus arriving at a coherent system, or else that we must take the shepherd's killing of the sheep — and then eating them after lying to the clothier about their cause of death — as unmotivated and absurd(ist); but the play is at most a farce, not a sotie... Between aborted exchanges 1 and 2 comes chronologically — although this and 1 are both extra(pre)-diegetic — the taking of the sheep by the shepherd (food and clothing for himself). Thus the ex change is fulfilled, but absent the volition of the clothier. The latter thus charges the former with a /misdeed/ and initiates the process of /pun ishment/ and /retribution/.3 The real non-fulfillment of contract no. 2 leads likewise to the charge of a /misdeed/ and the initiation of /punishment &amp; retribution/. Finally, the real non-fulfillment of contract no. 3 ends the play on a threatened (but not initiated) /punishment &amp; retribution/. No. 2 is the only exchange based on an immediate transfer, wherein money is (to be) exchanged for cloth ; it has as a corollary, that for promise of money cloth is not exchanged. The "time" granted the pur chaser — cloth, then time exchanged for money — is a value added to the cloth. To make this mediate exchange acceptable, Pathelin adds a promise of dinner, this time-delayed counter-value in a sense "paying" for the time granted him. Thus cloth a promise of money is exchanged for + time + a promise of dinner Exchange 1 is based on purely material transfer. Exchange 2 is normally material against semi-abstract/semi-material; Pathelin has raised this to a more abstract level by adding "time" to the exchange. Exchange 3 Where /punishment/ is the communication of a dysphoric Object (pain, im prisonment) to the Agent of /misdeed/ and /retribution/ is the transfer of a euphoric Object from the Agent of /misdeed/ to its Patient (the item stolen and/or payment for the item): /punishment/ Si: F (S2 U 0 =&gt; Si n 0) /retribution/ Si : F (Si 0 0 U Si =&gt; Ss U 0 n Si); which presumes a prior program: S2: F (Sa U 0 0 Si =&gt; S2 0 0 U Si). For the symbol fi, read "conjoined with"; for U read "disjoined from." Vol. XVIII, No. 3 73</page><page sequence="6">L'Esprit Créateur is the most immaterial: abstraction against semi-abstract/semi-material. When we look at this more closely, we can note : cloth (no exchange) promise of money time H (exchange) promise of dinner. The "promise of dinner" causes Pathelin's side to "outweigh" the clothier's. It thus is more valued than simply "promise of money" ; thus it qualifies the clothier as not only "avaricious," but also as "glut tonous." He is thereby more "vicious" than Pathelin. If this series of unfulfilled exchanges is placed over the material transformation (and hierarchical) system, we arrive at our next schema, based on a minimal series of functions: /trickery/ -&gt; /misdeed/ -&gt; /recognition/ -&gt; /retaliation/.4 ' ' 13 /recognition/ 14 /no retaliation/ PATHEUN ^ /'rickety/ /retaliation/ 10, T 5 4 I f' /misdeed/ I 12 " 10, /trickery/ Helper in /trickery/ /misdeed/ I /trickery/ I /trickery/ /recognition/ 6 T8 T10 CLOTHIER T , 4 ' /recognition/ ♦ /misdeed/ ' ' 1 [3] [1] /retaliation/ : SHEPHERD 4. This minimal system is one found by Mary Jane Schenck to be the invariant functional structure of the fabliau; when a number of other functions are joined to this, we have a minimal generic series of functions for the fabliau: see her "The Morphology of the Fabliau," in Fabula, 17 (1976), 26-39, and 74 Fall 1978</page><page sequence="7">Crist The function /misdeed/ is such, of course, only along one or more personal isotopies. A /misdeed/ is that which "causes" an actor to initiate the process of /retaliation/. It can, in addition, be over-determined by the misdoer (admitted to be an intended /misdeed/), as also by the nar rator (or enunciator) or simply, tacitly, by the axiological code prevail ing in the given culture. Thus the first sequence of /misdeed/ is so defined by the actions of the clothier, who recognizes it as such and initiates a process of /retal iation/, later aborted by Pathelin (the dotted lines indicate an unsuc cessful program). In fact, this first full sequence is multiple, as recorded to Pathelin by the shepherd himself (vv. 1091-1120). The process of /recognition/ is aborted at first by the shepherd's /trickery/(lies) ; further /misdeeds/ are then /recognized/ as such by the clothier, who initiates a process of /retaliation/. action [faire] — /misdeed/ /retaliation/ shep. &lt;- clo. ^ shep. -* clo. .modality: cognition [savoir] — /recognition/ (knowledge: k) At this point we can note that it would seem that the /misdeed/, in the domain of action, needs only a single Agent, whereas the /trickery/ as manifested (not simply reported) in the play, involving the modality of cognition (the communication of a false /cognition/), has a manifested Helper: 3rd instance — Pathelin as the shepherd's Helper against the clothier (steps 9, 10, 11); 2nd instance — Guillemette as Pathelin's her Pennsylvania State University dissertation, A Structural Definition of the Old French Fabliau (Dec. 1973). It can be noted that this would give the necessary, but not sufficient, structure of the fabliau, to which a definition of the expression-form (form of the signifier) must be added: narration, of a limited length, in rimed non-strophic octosyllabic couplets, with a sort of expressed "morale" (cf. Paul Zumthor's discussions in his Essai de poétique médiévale [Paris: Seuil, 1972]). Our farce has this base four-part system, but being narration by figurai anthropomorphic dialogue, it is generically dif ferent. As the four-part micro-system stands, it would seem to be not only the invariant structure of the fabliau, but of the very much larger body of "trickster" tales. Vol. XVIII, No. 3 75</page><page sequence="8">L'Esprit Créateur Helper against the clothier (steps 7, 8); the first instance of /trickery/ (in step 5) is a bit more subtle, since it is the clothier's intention (modal ity of /volition/) to cheat (action /misdeed/) (vv. 349-51), which is Pathelin's Helper against him (as is the clothier's gluttony, another instance of /volition/). This is, be it noted in passing, an indication of the clothier's "morally" lowest position in the play, if his role as the "objective" Helper in his own dysphoric program of Patient of /misdeed/ be accepted. We must note also that the only successful /misdeed/ manifested in the play, that of Pathelin against the clothier, is preceded by /trickery/ ; it is followed as well by /trickery/ (all in step 5), so as to abort the initiated /recognition/ (step 6) and thus avoid the connected /retaliation punishment/. In the shepherd's case, /trickery/ (step 10J only follows the /misdeed/ — I leave aside the unsuccessful /trickery/ (in step 1) wherein the shepherd lies to the clothier about the sheep's cause of death. Here Pathelin is, as noted, the shepherd's Helper in the latter's protective /trickery/. And this /trickery/' against the clothier in the shepherd's case is accompanied by /trickery/ against him in Pathelin's case as well (steps 10, 102, lli, lb).5 As we all know by now, the function of /trickery/ returns to Pathelin (step 12), who recognizes it as such (step 13), but cannot obtain /retalia tion/ (step 14), the shepherd simply running off (disjunctive function). Thus, if we consider only the first part of the play, we have a series of /trickery/ -&gt; /misdeed/ * '(/recognition/ -&gt; /retaliation &amp; punishment/) t /trickery/ That is, Pathelin, with his wife as Helper, has thwarted the clothier's potential program (/recognition/ -&gt; /retaliation/) ; but the clothier might 5. In both cases this is also the hierarchically lower function of /(self)protection/. Donald Maddox further analyzes the function of /trickery/ in an article which appears in this issue. 76 Fall 1978</page><page sequence="9">Crist yet institute a Subject (judge) for himself, if he sees that he has been gulled, and continue his program. In the second part of the play, the shepherd is accused of a /misdeed/ against the clothier, for which the latter demands /punishment/ against him as well as /retribution/ for himself: 6 clothier / Oi (payment for sheep) ► clothier ^ ( shepherd 0 (punishment) 1 Pathelin program 1 program 2 02 (cloth or payment) ► clothier , judge This becomes coupled with another accusation, that Pathelin has com mitted a /misdeed/, also against the clothier, and a corollary request, for /punishment/ against Pathelin and for /retribution/ for the clothier. What then happens is that the joint (double) program of the clothier is separated by Pathelin ; the "intended" first program of judicial redress against the shepherd becomes the judge's (and the clothier's) Opponent in the clothier's second program (against Pathelin), a sequel to the anti Pathelin program of the first part of the play. Every time the clothier says something about Pathelin (program 2), the latter tells lyingly (con veys false knowledge — the content of which is program 1 — to) the judge that it is about the shepherd. The judge's acceptance of this thwarts the first program ; the second is blocked by the "béé" trick. Thus the clothier's case in law against the shepherd is displaced hier archically by his case against Pathelin ; whence total confusion and his (permanent) loss of both cases (abortion of both programs): 6.

That is to say, the primary end of all these four functions is that of Amelioration ; Amelioration of the prime Agent of the first pair (against Degradation of the Patient of that pair) as against Amelioration of the prime Agent of the second pair (Patient of the first)... and so on. To be specific: part one of the play Pathelin needs -► desires cloth (—) -&gt; has cloth (+) (still) has cloth ( + ) -'Ur ^ (simple cognition of lack but is threatened (—) secure, no longer threatened ( + ) o O -&gt; volition to fill the lack) needs protection (—) -* protection (Helper) obtained ( + ) (Helper) 78 Fall 1978</page><page sequence="11">Crist This is a program of Amelioration, to which the clothier's corresponds inversely, as Degradation (the correspondance of modalities is different, but I will not take that up here): 1 clothier has cloth ( + ) » has a certain length still lacks that length of cloth no longer (—) of cloth (—) ■O o wants/needs payment (—) ► payment not obtained (—) I -O Icould procure Helper Helper not obtained] The shepherd's program is homologous with that of Pathelin, with the substitution of (food = lamb) for (cloth) ; its first part is not manifested in the play, only presumed, as I have noted. The Agent of the threat in mid-program is the clothier in both cases. Another element enters with the shepherd, in that Pathelin has a second, potential, program at the beginning of the play. The shepherd actualises this program: it is one of non-Amelioration (appearance of possible Amelioration, but no realization of that possibility): 2 ^ ^I———I ». Pathelin 1 2 not employed as lawyer (—) -&gt; employed as lawyer ( + ) — "O no possibility of pay (—) possibility of pay (+) ». not paid (—) As noted earlier, in this case the exchange /protection/ /payment/ exchange (against the law) (money) is not carried through for the counter-value. Vol. XVIII, No. 3 79</page><page sequence="12">L'Esprit Créateur Finally, the axiological status of the functions is made clear by state ments of the personages. Pathelin declares his intention before acting: /trickery/ -&gt; clothier -&gt; (/misdeed/). The clothier, however, defines what he has done, after acting: /trickery/ -&gt; Pathelin -&gt; (/misdeed/) (vv. 349 51). If Pathelin were to pay the clothier, the latter would have accom plished a /misdeed/, since Pathelin would have paid far more than the cloth was worth. But this is thwarted by Pathelin's program of /trickery/ (promise to pay the clothier, promise to feed him on roast goose).7 It seems to me clear that the clothier's "intended" /misdeed/ receives proleptically its /punishment/ in the form of Pathelin's /misdeed/ against him, a successful program in which, let us recall, Pathelin's Helper is the clothier's ill intention and his gluttony. We can now pass to the pièce de résistance, in regard to which I will make but a few remarks in conclusion : - obtains cloth (MISDEED) punishable ► avoids punishment1 avoids punishment* (temporary) 5 (permanent) -O Amelioration ' , PROTECTION I (TRICKERY) does not takes sheep receive payment (MISDEED) Helper sequences non-Degradation 4^ i punishable — 1 avoids punishment J| r PROTECTION (TRICKERY) ▼ (permanent) needs Helper -* has Helper 1 2. lacks work as lawyer ■ - ». has work 4J has (promise of) money non-Amelioration »■does not receive payment promises money ——— does not pay non-Degradation 7. See Mario Roques, "Notes sur Maistre Pierre Pathelin, I: Manger de l'oie," in Rom., 67 (1931), 548-60. The expression operates on two isotopies, literal for the clothier, figurative for Pathelin (and for the public). 80 Fall 1978</page><page sequence="13">Crist An exchange system usually pairs Amelioration with Degradation, in that to I lacks cloth(e.g.) (-—) Amelioration &gt; obtains cloth (+) J usually corresponds I has n money ( +) Degradation &gt; has less (n -y) money (—) J In our play, Pathelin begins in a state of "absolute lack," whereas the shepherd is in a state of "contractual lack." Both of the trick(st)ers have one Amelioration (cloth, food); all the rest is non-processes (blocking of Degradation and thus of Amelioration of the anti-actant). But Pathelin's service to the shepherd is repaid at the trial (again, in a sense, proleptically) by the judge's definitively blocking any further attempt by the clothier at /retaliation/ (punishment and/or retribution) against Pathelin. This would not have happened if the shepherd's case had not confused the clothier's pleading against Pathelin. finally, I note that one somatic non-action (lack of payment) leads to a somatic action (killing and eating of sheep) ; this latter to an inter pretative action, the trial, countered by a contradictory interpretative action, leading to a somatic non-action (the shepherd is not punished), followed by a final somatic non-action (the shepherd does not pay Pathelin for his interpretative non-action). This analysis would suggest that Maistre Pierre Pathelin is not so much about /misdeeds/ and even less /good deeds/ as about /undeeds/. I suspect that this rather downbeat situation is specific to Pathelin. Examination of other 15th-century farces along these lines is thus needed. In any case and for the nonce, I disallow any such analysis of the present essay.8 Vanderbilt University 8.
