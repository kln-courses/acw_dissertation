<plain_text><page sequence="1">THOMAS EUGENE DONALDSON ORISSAN IMAGES OF VARAHI, ODDIYANA MARICI, AND RELATED SOW-FACED GODDESSES* Although in the Puranas the Saptamatrkas (Seven Mothers) are conceived as blood-thirsty warriors, helping Ambika/Kaufiki in her battle against Raktavija, ?iva in his battle against Andhakasura, or for the destruction of the demon Nirrita, in iconographic texts and in sculpture they are generally depicted in pacific forms which stress their maternal nature, their weapons seemingly more for identification than for immediate action. Invariably in the textual accounts it is stated that the "Mothers are to be made with the forms and the cognizances of the gods after whom they are named,"' or that these "?aktis of the individual gods are characterized by the respective forms, ornaments, and mounts of those gods."' Although this is generally true for Brahmi, Maheivari, Kaumari, Vaisnavi, and Indrani, and partially true for CQimunda (who, in essence, is not really a matrkd), it is not true for Varahi. In most iconographic descriptions and particularly in sculptural representations in Orissa, Varahi has little in common with her male counterpart Varaha, aside from her sow-face. The depiction of a Mother with the head of a pig is particularly striking, even more so as Vdrahi alone has a pot-belly, whereas Camund. is emaciated and the other matrkas are characterized by an ideal feminine physique in keeping with Indian conventions. It has been suggested by some scholars that the pot-belly of Vdrahi symbolizes her maternal aspect yet it is curious why she alone would be so singled out, particularly as she (along with Camunda) best exemplifies the terrifying aspect of the Mothers. The pig, when associated with woman, implies a pejorative quality for the latter or serves in a degrading capacity, as in bestiality scenes placed next to curses and imprecatory verses on gardabha or boundary stones erected to protect donated land from invaders, new rulers, and trespassers. In a legend associated with a monastery in Tibet, attempting to explain the origin of the Buddhist goddess Vajravarahi, one of the abbesses had an excrescence behind her ear which resembled a sow's head. The Mongol warrior Dzun-gar, when attacking the monastery, called out insulting challanges for the abbess to come forth and show her sow's head. When the walls were destroyed and the army invaded the place, they found it inhabited by sows and pigs, led by a sow bigger than the rest. Dzun-gar was so amazed at the sight that he stopped the pillage, at which the sows and pigs become transformed back into monks and nuns, and the largest sow into the abbess herself. Dzun-gar became converted at the miracle and enriched the monastery.3 When associated with the male, in contrast, the pig, or more appropriately the boar, lends a heroic or terrifying aspect befitting a warrior and there are numerous gods equated with the boar in early Sanskrit works. In that Varihi has no developed mythology aside from her skirmishes with demons, it is necessary to look at the mythology of Varaha to determine similarities and/or differences in respect to form and iconography. Partial support for field research of this project was provided by a grant from Cleveland State University.

Mythology and Iconography of Vardha In the Rg Veda (I.88), for example, the Maruts are called the "iron-tusked boars" or the "wild boars."4 Rudra is addressed as the boar of the sky (Rg Veda, I.II4.5); while the boar form of Vrtra (Rg Veda, I.IzI.II; VIII.66; X.99.6) plays a significant role in the Vedic mythology which laid the foundation of the later Vaisnava myth of Vardha rescuing the Earth.' Vrtra in the Vedas is the personification of the clouds, and hence the boar, as identified with Vrtra, represents the same natural phenomena, i.e., Vartha is the theriomorphic form of Vrtra, the cloud.6 A hymn in the Atharva Veda (XII.I.48) implies that the earth yields corn and riches to the people with the help of Varaha (clouds, i.e., rain) who is thus represented as a protector and supporter of this wealth. In the myth of Indra shooting the boar Emfsa, who kept the wealth of the asuras concealed behind seven hills, the latter (or Varaha) means the one who carries off the treasures or riches, i.e., the Earth which is the embodiment of riches. The Earth Goddess, with whom Varaha consorts and to whom she opens herself, is thus conceived of as cosmic motherhood.7 In the Matsya Purdna (248.73), Vardha is likened to the manilrnga (cornucopia), which is considered to be a nidhi (treasure), and this may symbolically refer to the act of Varaha bringing forth the riches of the nether world in the form of the Earth. In the Brahmanic literature the relation of Vardha to the earth is fully developed. In the Kapisthala- Katha-samhitd (VI.7), for example, he is associated with the creation of the earth: "In the beginning there were primeval waters - Once Lord Prajdpati, taking the form of a boar, entered it (plunged into it) and brought up (to the surface) the soil exactly the size of his snout. That soil became this very earth." A similar legend appears in the Taittiriya-samhitd (VII.I.5.I); while in the gatapatha BrAhmana (XIV.I.2.nII) Emfisa Varaha is stated to have raised up the Earth from the waters; and in the Taittirlya Aranyaka (X.I.8) it is recorded that the Earth was formerly upheld by the black boar with a hundred arms. These myths represent the initial stages of the later Vaisnava myth, as K. Desai observes, where Vardha is an avatar of Visnu.9 There is also a parallel development establishing a relationship between the boar and the sun. As early as the Rg Veda (X.86), Varaha was referred to as Vrsdkapi. In the hymn so-called, Vrsakapi stands for Vardha, while in the Gopatha BrAhmana (II.6.12) it is stated that Vrsdkapi is the sun."o The Mahdbhdrata (XII.330o.24), the Harivamifa (III.34.48), and the Matsya Purdna (247-79) identify Vrsakapi with Varaha as well as with the sun or Agni. In numerous Purdnas, Chdyv, the consort of Sfrya, actually accompanies Vardha.n According to the gatapatha Brdhmana, Vardha is a fat-dripping animal: Now the Gods once put a pot ofghrta in the fire. Therefrom a Boar was produced; hence the Boar is full of fat, for it was produced from ghrta. Hence also cows readily take to a boar, it is indeed their own essence of life-sap (SB, V.4.3.I9). 4 Hymns of the Rg Veda, trans, by Ralph T.H. Griffith (Varanasi, 1963, fourth edition), vol. I, 113. 6 Kalpana Desai, Iconography of Visnu (New Delhi, 1973), 71. 6 Ibid., 71-72. The cloud is Varaha because it takes the best food (the water), so also is the boar as he takes the best roots that grow up. Varaha is thus the one who eats the best food. See Nirukta (V.4) of Yaska. 7 See Desai, op. cit., 72. 8 Matsya Purdna, trans. by "A Taluqdar of Oudh", vol. II (Allahabad, 1974 reprint), 282-83. 9 Desai, op. cit., 72-73. 'o See Umakant P. Shah, "Vrsdkapi in the Rg Veda,"Journal of Oriental Institute (Baroda), vol. VIII, no. I (1968), 56. " Desai, op. cit., 73- 156</page><page sequence="3">As suggested by V.S. Agrawala, the ghrta-kumbha (pot of butter) or fat-dripping Vardha is Surya, from whom showers of butter or particles of heat (or Agni) are being scattered; there can be no creation without the 'rain of butter' from the father principle in the womb of the mother. Vardha (as Prajapati) is here conceived of as the cosmic father, just as in the marriage ritual the bridegroom is symbolized as Varaha, i.e., "the personified form of Agni or seed or globules of butter, which will function as the fecundating power for the pro-generation of the child."') Thus a bride unveils her body for her husband just as the Earth does for Vardha. Cows likewise can be looked upon as Varahi, i.e., as containers of milk and butter or of the Varahi forces which create the cosmic seed.3 This may be an underlying reason for the pot-belly of Varahi; just as Varaha represents the fat-dripping cosmic father, Varahi symbolizes the cosmic mother, the container of this fat, and is thus synonomous with Prthvi (Earth). Though Varaha appears fat only when represented in his theriomorphic form, the name itself refers to the principle of force which envelops, "finitises or prescribes a limit to an undefined field and by its controlling potency gives form to that which was formless and creates a system of forces and counterforces, regulated or balanced according to a magnetic rhythm," a principle best illustrated in Surya and the solar system, which is the main Varaha form.14 In the beginning, then, Varaha had no association with Visnu. In the Mahadbhdrata (XIII.I5o), in fact, he is considered to be one of the eleven Rudras, while in the Taittirtya Brdhmana (I.7.9-4), he is considered the most wrathful of all animals, just as Rudra is called the most wrathful of gods. In general, the boar (Varaha) is associated with clouds, the sun, and the Earth itself, both as its creator and its sustainer. It is in the Mahdbhdrata (VI.63.I3) that Vardha comes to be incorporated into the avatdra cycle of Visnu; while the first detailed account of the Varaha myth of his rescuing the Earth is found in the Harivamria (III.34.30-53).15 In iconographic texts Vardha may be represented either in a theriomorphic or an anthropomorphic (with the head of a boar) form. In his theriomorphic form he has a massive body, suggesting that of all animals he is the fat-dripping creature par excellence who eats the Pravargya portion of the food as it is rejected out of the body of a living Pranic center;16 the Earth Goddess clings to one of his tusks. Although most of the early sculptural representations of his anthropomorphic form depict him with two hands, neither of which holds Vaisnava dyudhas (attributes/weapons), by the late Gupta period his Vaisnava iconography becomes standardized. In this form he has the head of a boar and assumes the heroic .lidha pose (left knee bent and striding forward) standing on a serpent while lifting up the Earth Goddess. He has four arms and generally holds two or more Vaisnava dyudhas, such as the conch, the cakra, a gadd, or a lotus. Though he does not have a pot-belly, he is often described in the texts as being huge; thus in the Matsya Purdna (248.64-78) he is said to have extended himself to a hundred yojanas in length and twice that in height, and as such symbolizes great strength. In the Mudrdraksasam drama, for example, the concluding verse compares the great victory of Candragupta with Varaha's conquest of the Earth, while the Caturbh.ni refers to Sukara-siddhi and states that wrestlers propitiate him for strength."7 In Iz V.S.

Here he is associated with the Vedic idea that creation is the overflow from a conscious center of Pranic energy. I7 Desai, op. cit, 74, quoting from Caturbhani, ed. by Moti Chandra, p. I96, verse 62. 157</page><page sequence="4">Tantric texts his iconography is more elaborate and in his multiple hands he holds a cakra, conch, sword, dagger, gadad, and lance while two hands display abhaya and varada. He is accompanied by the Earth Goddess and may be flanked by the goddesses Bhfmi and Sri.'8 In a description in the Agni Purdna (49.I8a), in contrast, he has the serpent Sesa in his hand.I9 In Orissan sculpture, where he is represented only in his anthropomorphic form with a human body and the head of a boar, there are two basic modes. In the early mode he is depicted in dlidha with his left foot trampling the serpent king while the ngig queen, with hands clasped in anjali, is beneath his right foot. Varaha has his major two hands clasped in front of his chest with Prthvi seated on his raised left elbow. His rear two hands hold a cakra and a conch (fig. I). In the second mode, introduced in the Somavarlii period (A.D. 93I-IIio), the serpents are frequently eliminated, or a single one is depicted in miniature between the feet of Varaha, while Prthvi is depicted twice (fig. 2). She is represented at the lower proper right holding the lower right hand of Varaha and she is then depicted seated on his raised left elbow, the hands no longer being clasped in front of his chest.20z His rear pair of hands, the right raised and the left lowered, hold the cakra and the conch respectively . In both modes a lotus medallion blossoming above the head of Varaha may be a reference to his original solar character. B. Vdrahi: Iconography In contrast, the matrkd Vdrahi is invariably depicted in a seated or a dancing pose when represented with the other madtrkds in sculpture. Although she seldom wields the Vaisnava dyudhas of her male counterpart, there are some textual references which prescribe these weapons. Perhaps the closest parallel with Varaha is the description in the Vdmana Purdna (30.7), where the madtrkds are said to have been created from various parts of the goddess Candiki, Vdrahi being born from her back. According to this text she carries the gadd and the cakra, and is seated on the serpent ?esa.2I This is a rare example where a serpent serves as her mount or seat. In the Vilvakarma-lilpa she carries the conch and gadd in two hands while her other two display varada and abhaya. She is dark like the clouds that portend destruction of the world, wears a black garment, has a beehive crown, is decked with all sorts of ornaments, and rides a buffalo near a karanja tree.22 In the Devi-mahdtmya, she is described as having a hog-like form, as having uplifted the earth with her tusks, and as wielding a formidable cakra. In the battle against the asura Raktavija, however, she strikes him with a sword,23 a weapon not normally associated with Vardha except in late Tantric texts. In other textual descriptions there are even more variations. In the Matsya Purdna (261.24), she carries a gadd and a cakra while holding a caurt (fly-whisk) over her head. She has the buffalo as her mount. In the Agni Purdana (5o.zo), she also rides a buffalo while holding a gadd, conch, sword, and an arikulsa (goad). In the Mantramahodadhi, she is black like a cloud, has beautiful breasts, wears a moon on her crest, has three eyes, and holds the Earth on her tusks. She carries a sword, shield, pala (noose), i8 Desai, op. cit., 78-79. 19 Agni Purdna, trans, and annotated by N. Gangadharan (Delhi, 1984), pt. I, 131. 20zo Prthvi is also mentioned twice in the Agni Purdna (49.I8-o20) as Earth being held in his left hand and then as resting, along with Laksmi, at his feet.

In the Purvakdranagama she holds the bow, the plough, and the pestle. She wears on her legs nupura-anklets. The Vdrahini-nigrahdstaka-stotra hails her as the spouse of Siva and describes her as dark in complexion with a crescent on her head. Her four hands hold the plough, pestle, rakta-kapala (skull with blood), and display abhaya.25 In the Visnudharmottara Purdna, she has a big belly and six hands which hold the danda (club), sword, shield, noose, and display abhaya and varada. In the gritattvanidhi, four forms of V-ra-hi are described. In the first (S.T. 47), she has a black complexion, a big belly, and mounts the buffalo. Her six hands hold a club, sword, shield, and pot, and display varada and abhaya. As Dandandtha-vdrdhi (S.T. 75), the second form, she has a golden complexion and carries in her eight hands a conch, cakra, plough, pestle, noose, and goad, and displays abhaya and varada. As Svapna-varahi (S.T. 76), the third form, she has the color of clouds, bears a crescent on her head, and has three eyes. Her six hands hold a sword, a shield, a noose, and a sickle, and display varada and abhaya. As Suddha-vdrdhi (S.T. 77), the fourth form, she has a blue complexion, bears a crescent over her head, and has a face like a boar with white protruding teeth. In her four hands she holds a trident, a skull, a pestle, and a serpent.26 In a few cases even her mount changes, as in the guprabhedagama where she is the color of the storm-cloud, is of short stature with the angry face of a boar, wears a karanda-mukuta coiffure, and is adorned with ornaments made of corals. She is seated under a kalpaka tree and wields the plough and a spear. Her vehicle, as well as the emblem on her banner, is the elephant.27 In the Devi Bhagavata Purana (V.28.I3-33) episode of the battle against the army of Sumbha, Vdrdhi, looking like a female boar, came to the battle seated on an elevated seat of departed souls (pretadsana).28 In these textual descriptions of Vdrdhi the most favored ajyudhas are the club (danda or gada), the sword, the cakra, the kapdla/skull, the noose, the plough, the shield, and the pestle. Less popular are the ankuia and the conch. Objects named only once or twice include the bow, the bell, the serpent, a rosary, a sickle, a spear, a khatva~iga, and a trident. In actual battle descriptions in the myths, however, invariably it is her animal form that becomes the weapon, i.e., her boar snout and tusks. The buffalo is by far the most popular mount with the other vehicles being mentioned only once, i.e., the serpent, the elephant, and apreta (departed soul). Varahi is generally dark-colored, suggesting her relationship with clouds, and is sometimes described as having a large belly. Only twice is she described as holding the Earth on her tusks though in the Maitra~yan-samihitd (4.4.6) she is identified with the Earth. In the Vardha Purdna (27.34) she is associated with envy29 while in the gritattvanidhi it is stated she provides pleasure. In the kavaca ritual of the Vaisnavi-tantra mantra in the Kdlika Purana (58.24-27), she is invoked for protection in the water.30 Conspicuous by its absence in these Brahmanical texts is the fish, which is popular on sculptural representations of Varahi, particularly in Orissa where it is a standard cognizance held in one of her 24 N.

The fish is mentioned as a cognizance in the Vdrdht Tantra, an unedited Sanskrit text written in Oriya script in the collection of Saddfiva Rath SarmI of Puri, where twenty-eight couplets describe five different forms of Varahi, i.e., Svapna- varahi, Canda-varahi, Maha-varahi (Bhairavi), Krcchra-varahi, and Matsya-varahi. In the last form she is seated in sukhdsana and holds a fish and a pot.31 The fish also appears as a cognizance of Varahi in the Dharmadhdtuvdgigivara-mandala of the Buddhist text Nispannayogdvali. There, Varahi is said to be blue and has an owl as her vehicle. In her four hands she holds the Rohita fish and a kapdla while clasping her other two hands in anjali. In the Vajrdvalinama-mandalopdyika, the Buddhist Vdrdhi is also described as holding a Rohu fish; while in the Pujdpaddhati (Viracamunda section), Vdrahi is described as being very awesome, terrible, having three eyes, and holding a staff.32 C. Orissan Images of Mhatrkya Varahi Mdtrka worship was particularly popular in Orissa with some thirty sets, or fragments thereof, still in existence, most of which were carved from separate stones, rather than from a single slab, and were intended to be housed in special shrines. On the earliest surviving set of Saptamdtrk-s, on the north side of the jagamohana of the Parasuramesvara temple, dating to the mid-seventh century, all seven mothers are seated in paryanka with one leg resting on the other. The boar-faced Varahi is the sixth in the series, rather than the fifth as is conventional, being placed after Indrdni rather than before her. She is four-armed, wears a kucha-bandha binding her breasts, has large pdtra-kundalas in her ears, and a jewelled diadem at the base of her matted coiffure. In her major right hand she holds a fish while the left hand holds a pot. Her uplifted rear hands hold a lotus and a kuthdra (hatchet). The pendant hanging between her breasts is fastened to a string of pearls which loops down on either side of her pot-belly. Her boar-snout is broken off. On either corner of her pedestal is a tripod holding a pot while her mount, in the center, is a bhdraraksaka or mandira-carini, i.e., a human figure squatting on his haunches with hands placed between his feet. Thus, already on the earliest surviving image in Orissa, the fish is associated with Vdrdhi and none of her four dyudhas (cognizances) is specifically Vaisnava, the lotus being held by most Brahmanical deities during this early period in Orissa. Although the fish, one of the five panca-makaras in Tantric rituals, appears associated with Varahi only in the Vdrdhi Tantra and in Tantric Buddhist texts, this does not necessarily imply that its early appearance here is Tantric-inspired. The fish, like the pot (likewise one of the panca-makaras if filled with wine or flesh) and the lotus, is a general auspicious symbol and need not be Tantric in nature. In that the boar is equally at home in water or on land, the fish, as in the case of the cloud-like dark color prescribed in the texts, may have a natural affiliation with the boar. In the kavaca ritual of the Vaisnavi-tantra mantra of the Kilika Purdna, as indicated, she is invoked for protection in water, suggesting her aquatic nature. In a large Virahi image from Western India, now in the British Museum, she is shown eating a fish held in her major right hand.33 The nara-vahana, or human figure carved on the pedestal of Varahi likewise has no textual precedents, aside from the Devi Bhigavata Purdna where she rides on a seat of departed souls, but is a common vehicle on early Orissan images. It also appears elsewhere in India, as at Mt. Abu and Jagat 3 J.N. Banerjea, Pauranic and Tantric Religion (Calcutta, 1966), 131. 32 D.C.

The nara-vdhana (mandira-carinT/bhdraraksaka), with hands placed on his feet, also appears on the pedestal of the madtrkd Vardhi in the sanctum of the Vaitdl Deul at Bhubaneswar, dating to the late eighth century (fig. 3). Vdrdhi, like Camunda, is seated in ardhaparyanka with one knee raised. She is four-armed and has her boar-head turned to her left so that her snout is more clearly visible. Her major right hand, resting on her raised knee, holds a fish; while the vessel held in the lowered left hand appears to be a kapdla (skull-cup), which would be in keeping with the terrifying nature of the temple, affiliated with the Kdpalika sect of Tantrism as well as being a Sdkta shrine. Her uplifted rear hands hold a rosary and a hatchet. She has her coiffure in the karanda-muku.ta mode with tightly- coiled curls neatly arranged in tiers. The mandira-carinT on the pedestal is flanked by a kamandalu on one side and a tripod heaped with offerings on the other. Also placed within the sanctum is an image of Varaha, who assumes a similar ardhaparyatka pose with his boar-head turned to his left. He has only two hands, however, with the right hand, resting on the raised knee, holding a hatchet. His left hand holds a kapdla to his mouth, suggesting he is either eating flesh or drinking blood. The pedestal is decorated with a tripod of offerings in the center, flanked by a seated male and a vessel on the right and left respectively. In essence, as neither the hatchet nor the kapala is a standard Vaisnava ayudha associated with Varaha, his image here is conceived of as the male counterpart of Vdrdhi, rather than vice-versa, duplicating her pose as well as holding two of her four weapons and likewise being provided with a nara-vadhana. On the jagamohana door frame of the ninth-century Sirihhandtha temple, the matrkd Varahi is seated in ardhaparyatka and has two arms (fig. 4). She holds the fish in her right hand and a pot in her left hand. She is richly ornamented with a necklace, falling between her breasts, to form a large loop on her pot-belly. She wears thickpdtra-kundalas, has a third eye on her forehead, and wears a jewelled tiara. The nara-vdhana on her pedestal, seated in ardhaparyanka, is flanked by a tripod on the right and by a pot and possibly a fish on the left. In the compound of the Madhukeivara temple at Mukhalifigam, likewise dating to the ninth century, the Saptamdtrkis are carved on the door frame of a small khdkhard temple (fig. 5). The four-armed Vardhi, again seated in ardhaparyatka, holds a fish in her major right hand and a vessel in her left. Her uplifted rear hands hold an indistinct object, possibly a goad, and a noose. Her body ornamentation includes pdtra-kundalas. She has a third eye and her tusks are clearly visible. Her coiffure is arranged in two tiers of serpentine curls, the standard coiffure on most later images though in an incipient form here. For the first time, the buffalo is placed on her pedestal as her vdhana, thus replacing the nara-vdhana of earlier images. In the Ptrle"ivara compound at Paikapa.da in Koraput district, dating to the late ninth century, the Saptamitrkas are in a shrine on the south side. For the first time a child is on the left thigh of each mother except for Camunda. Varahi is now seated in lalitisana with one leg pendant, as are all of the matrkas except for Camunda who remains in ardhaparyanka . Due topuja rituals the surface details are badly worn. Varahi is four-armed and places her major right hand in abhaya while the left arm cradles the child. This becomes the standard iconography for matrkd images in Orissa. Her uplifted rear right hand holds a club while the object in the left hand is possibly a goad. Conspicuous by its absence is the fish. Her buffalo-mount is beneath her seat. At Belkhandi in Kalahandi district, where a set of matrkis was retrieved from the collapsed tenth-century Candi temple, the four-armed Varahi, 34 R.C. Agrawala, "Fish and Varhi in Ancient Indian Sculpture," Orissa Historical ResearchJournal XII, no. I (1964), 2-3. 169</page><page sequence="16">now broken in half, holds a fish in her uplifted rear right hand while the left hand holds the goad. At Rdnipur-Jharial in Bolangir district, the uplifted rear right and left hands hold a fish and noose respectively By the late tenth century, with the Somavarii kefari Kings firmly entrenched in eastern Orissa, mdtrka worship becomes even more pronounced as shown by the large-scale images created at this time, including two sets at Jijpur and single sets at Puri, Bhubaneswar, and Dharmaill. They are all four-armed, with the major right hand in abhaya and the left arm cradling the child, and are all seated in lalitdsana, even the childless Camunda. In the colossal image of Vardhi placed in the compound of the Sub-Divisional Officer in Jdjpur, along with images of Indrdni and Camunda, the rear arms are broken off. Her hair is arranged in serpentine coils which radiate out from the center rather than being neatly aligned in tiers as in the karanda-mukuta style of earlier figures. She is richly ornamented and is huge. Her buffalo-mount is beneath her seat. In the image from the set placed in a modern shed on the DasaSvamedha ghdt at Jdjpur, the hands are well preserved (fig. 6). The major right hand is in abhaya while the left cradles the child. The uplifted rear right hand holds the fish while the left holds a kapdla, the same objects held in the major hands of earlier images where no child was present. She is richly ornamented, her necklace forming the conventional loop on her pot- belly, and her patra-kundalas are decorated with eight-petalled flower designs. She wears a jewelled tiara at the base of her coiffure which spirals up like serpents while loose curls cascade down to her shoulders. The buffalo-mount crouches beneath her feet. The slightly later image of Vardhi from the mdtrkd set on the bank of the Markandeya tank at Puri is similar, though the uplifted rear right hand with the fish is broken off. The radiating serpentine coiffure now assumes a circular design with two neatly aligned tiers. In the Vardhi image from Dharmaill, now in the Orissa State Museum along with three other mdtrk~a images from the set, the uplifted rear right hand with the fish is intact (fig. 7). Her uplifted rear left hand again holds a kapdla. Her jewelled tiara is ornamented with pointed crests and miniature kirtimukha masks. The back-slab is decorated with an abbreviated makara-torana with a kTrtimukha at the apex and flying vidyddhara couples at the upper corners. Of the matrkd set originally housed in a shrine near the entrance to the Lirigardja compound, the only surviving image is that of Vardhi now loosely placed within the compound. Iconographically the image corresponds closely with those in the other sets. Her uplighted rear right hand holds the fish; the corresponding left arm is broken at the elbow. Her buffalo-mount is beneath her seat. In the somewhat smaller set at Sathalapura, dating to the late tenth or the early eleventh century, the fish is held in the uplifted rear right hand of Vdrdhi while the corresponding left hand holds a goad rather than a kapdla. Otherwise the iconography is the same. In the image from the mdtrkd slab from the Buddhantha Siva temple at Gare.dipaficana, possibly dating to the mid-thirteenth century, the uplifted right hand holds a goad, rather than the fish, while the corresponding left hand holds a noose. Her major hands are broken off, her facial features are obliterated, and the child is missing. The serpentine curls of her coiffure, arranged in two tiers, assume a parasol shape. The buffalo-mount is placed beneath her seat. The fish is also absent on the Varihi image of the Brahmeivara temple at Beraboi, where the two-armed matrkis are housed in kanika niches of the upper jangha. Each displays abhaya with her right hand while cradling the child with the left arm. Varahi wears patra-kunzdalas and her hair is arranged in two tiers of serpentine coils which radiate around her head. The buffalo- mount is carved beneath her seat. The temple can be dated to the early twelfth century. 170</page><page sequence="17">D. Varahi as a Presiding Deity Though she was not as popular as Camundi, there are numerous images of Virdhi which originally served as a presiding deity independent from the other mdtrkds in a shrine dedicated to her as a form of the Devi. That there was originally such a temple at Bhubaneswar is substantiated in a verse demarcating the boundaries of Ekdmra-ksetra in ancient times; the shrine was possibly destroyed with the construction of the new capital at Bhubaneswar. According to tradition as recorded in the Kapila Samnhitd, quoted in the Ekdmra-candrakd, the Vardhi Devi was at the northern boundary near the village of Miydpalli.35 The only surviving temple dedicated to Vdrdhi is the one at Caurasi which dates to the early tenth century, though numerous large Virdhi images scattered across Orissa, some now housed in the sanctums of modern shrines, suggest there were originally many more such temples (fig. 8). The majority of these survivors appear to date to the tenth century, as do the largest of the mdtrkd sets, suggesting that some among the Somavarihi-kefari rulers must have been very devout worshippers of the kakta cult. The image of Vardhi in the sanctum of the temple at Caurisi is seated in lalitisana, following tenth-century mdtrkd conventions, but has only two arms and no child (fig. 8). Her right hand holds a fish while the left holds a kapdla. She wears conventional ornaments, including pdtra-kundalas, and her necklace forms a loop on her pot-belly. She has a third eye on the forehead and her tusks are clearly visible. She wears a jewelled tiara and her serpentine curls are dishevelled rather than neatly radiating. Her buffalo-mount is carved on her pedestal. A single vidyddhara is at each upper corner of the back-slab. There are in addition two smaller images of Vdrdhi placed within the jagamohana, one with two hands and the other with four, both seated in ardhaparyanka with one knee raised. In the two-armed image, Varihi holds a fish in her right hand and a kapdla in her left, duplicating the iconography of the main image in the sanctum. A mandira-carinT (nara-vdhana) is placed on her pedestal, however, as on early mdtrkd images, rather than a buffalo. The nara-vdhana is flanked on either side by a tripod holding a vessel or heaped with offerings. At the proper right corner is a kneeling devotee. In the four-armed image, the major right hand holds an offering while the left, supported by her raised knee, holds a kapdla. The uplifted rear right hand with the fish (?) is broken off while the left hand holds a rosary. The buffalo-mount is in the center of the pedestal flanked by a kneeling devotee on either side. Thus, at this early tenth-century site, Virdhi appears in two different seated poses, the ardhaparyanka common on early matrkd images and the lalitdsana pose just becoming popular. She also has both of her conventional vahanas, the nara-vdhana seen on early matrkd images and the buffalo which becomes standard later. Both of these features, the pose and the vdhana, thus suggest the transitional nature of the site and of the evolving iconography for independent images of Virahi. At Bafichua, in Keonjhar district across the VaitaranT river from Anandapur, a large image of Varahi presently serves as the presiding deity of a small modern temple, though no doubt there was originally a Varahi temple at the site which likewise must have dated to the tenth century. Virihi is seated in ardhaparyanika and is two-armed. She holds the fish in her right hand and a kapdla in the left, the image being partially covered with modern garments. Jewelled arm-bands are included with her body ornamentation and she wears makara-kunpdalas rather than the conventional patra-kunpdalas. She has a jewelled tiara and her serpent curls coil upward in two neatly aligned tiers while loose curls 35 Rajendra Lala Mitra, The Antiquities of Orissa (Calcutta, 1963 reprint), vol. II, Io5. I7I</page><page sequence="18">cascade down to her shoulders on either side. Her halo is flanked above each shoulder by a makara head which represents the beginnings of a makara-torana. Most unusual is the placement of both vdhanas on her pedestal, a buffalo and a nara-vdhana. The buffalo is depicted walking, rather than recumbent, while the man is seated in ardhaparyaika, rather than squatting as on the earliest mdtrkd images of Vdrdhi. There is also a small two-armed Vdrdhi at the site who is seated in an abbreviated lalitdsana pose. She holds a fish in her right hand; the left arm is broken off. She wears pdtra-kundalas and her serpentine coils are dishevelled. The largest of these tenth-century images of Vdrdhi must have been the one at Navendrapur in Balasore district, now broken into three large pieces and placed in a small modern shed. It is approximately six feet wide at the base and must have measured nearly ten feet in height, which would make her about the same size as the colossal matrkd images in the Sub-Divisional Officer's compound at Jdjpur. Vdrdhi is seated with both legs pendant. Though her arms are now missing, a fish is lying next to her and was probably held in her right hand. She is richly ornamented and her lower necklace forms a loop on her massive belly in the conventional manner. She wears patra- kundalas and a jewelled tiara. Her hair is arranged in tightly-coiled curls on top, neatly aligned as on the earlier karanda-muku.ta coiffure, and in cascading cone-like curls on the sides. A crescent moon is visible on the left side of her coiffure. Between her feet is a small nara-vdhana seated in ardhaparyaika with one hand on his knee and the other arm resting on his raised knee. He is richly ornamented and his hair is somewhat dishevelled. His pose and placement, between the feet of Vardhi rather than on the pedestal, is similar to the female figures that appear between the feet of tenth-century images of Hanumdn trampling on a prostrate corpse or demon. Four similar images of Varahi, about half the size, are presently enshrined in a modern rectangular temple at Satbhaya, on the shore of the Bay of Bengal just south of the Brahmani river (fig. 9). According to tradition there were originally five, but the fifth Vardhi, being very quarrelsome, was chased into the sea by the other four. At present a small, badly damaged image, not identifiable, is placed in the shrine and worshipped as Bata Kumdri. The four Vardhi images are named Janjali, Kdmalai, Bimalai, and Panicu Vdrdhi. In each case, Vdrahi is seated in bhadrdsana with both legs pendant and a diminutive male figure between her feet, seated in ardhaparyanaka as at Navendrapur. She holds a fish in her right hand and a pot in her left. Her necklace forms a loop on her pot-belly and she wears large pdtra-kundalas. She has a jewelled tiara and her coiffure is arranged in tightly-coiled curls on top and pine-cone curls on the sides which cascade to her shoulders. The sides of her back- slab are decorated with virdla (lion) and makara motifs, suggesting a throne, while her head is framed by a plain halo. That a Varahi temple once existed at Domaganrdara, on the northern bank of the river Sona in Nilgiri sub-division of Balasore district, is evident by the discovery there of two of her Varlhi images. The largest, measuring six feet six inches by three feet, must have served as the presiding deity. Although the smaller image was moved to Nilgiri town, an attempt to move the larger image was abandoned. It is now lying beneath a tree. The smaller image is shown seated in lalitisana.36 She is four-armed but all of the arms are broken off. A noose held by the rear left hand is intact on the back-slab. Her coiffure is partially matted with the tips coiled like serpents. The buffalo-mount is beneath her seat. Another image which may have served as a presiding deity is found at Tarapur, off the Cuttack-Paradip road in Cuttack district. She is four-armed and is seated in ardhaparyanika. The 36 N.N. Vasu, op. cit., pl. 16, fig. 3I. The larger image is identical in iconography. 172</page><page sequence="19">image is badly worn and the only intact object is a kapdla. She wears large pdtra-kundalas and her coiffure is arranged in radiating serpentine curls. The buffalo-mount is on the pedestal. There may also have been a Vardhi temple at Khiching as part of an ancient fort is called Vareji which, as Panigrahi suggests, is a corruption ofVardhi.37 Deviating from these Sakta images is the presiding deity of the Lankeivari temple at Junagarh, dating to the seventeenth century, situated on the bank of the Hati river in Kalahandi district. The four-armed Lankeivari has the face of a boar and is seated in vajraparyaika with both legs crossed on a lotus throne. Her uplifted rear hands hold a cakra and a conch while the lower hands possibly hold a gadd (mace) and a lotus. Her four dyudhas thus associate her with the Vardha avatar of Visnu and testify to the growing influence of Vaisnavism on later works, an influence also noticed on late standing images discussed below. There are in addition numerous smaller non-mdtrkd images scattered throughout Orissa which may have been housed in the jagamohana of Vdrdhi temples, as at Caurdsi, or were inserted into exterior niches of Sdkta shrines. From the collapsed Bhimeivari temple at Peddgadi in eastern Mayurbhanj district, for example, is a detached image of Vdrdhi seated in lalitdsana on a low throne (fig. Io). She is four-armed and holds a fish in her major right hand while the left holds a pot or a kapadla. The object in the damaged rear right hand was probably a goad; the corresponding left hand holds a noose. Her necklace spills onto her pot-belly and she wears padtra-kundalas. She has a jewelled tiara and her coiffure is neatly arranged in two tiers of tightly-coiled curls. The image can be dated to the late tenth century. A similar four-armed image, now inserted into the walls of the modern Khutid temple at Ayodhyd, is seated in lalitdsana above her buffalo and holds the same objects in her hands (fig. II). An addition is the pleated skirt, also evident at Domagandard, which hangs nearly to her ankles. The image probably dates to the late tenth century. A detached image now placed in the compound of the Svapnesvara Devi temple at Nardyani, adjacent to Kantilo on the south bank of the Mahdnadi river, is four-armed and seated in ardhaparyaika . Her arms are mostly broken off as is her snout. Her coiffure is arranged in a conical kirita-mukuta, a deviation from convention which suggests Vaisnava influence and a late date. A small female attendant stands on her left. On the right corner of the pedestal is her buffalo-mount while on the opposite corner are two kneeling devotees. There are also a few late examples where the image of Varahi forms part of the iconographic program of ?aiva temples, her images being in exterior niches. On the early thirteenth-century Catesvara temple at Kisenpur, for example, her image is housed in the upper rdhad niche on the north side of the deul, a niche usually filled by a small duplicate of the pariva-devatd in the larger, lower niche. The corresponding niches on the south and west side of the Catesvara temple house ?aiva (Lakuli~a) and Vaisnava (Vamana/Bali) motifs respectively. The two-armed Varahi is seated in lalitisana and holds a kapala in her left hand (fig. 12). Her right hand places an object into her mouth, either the fish or possibly flesh taken from the kapala. She wears conventional body ornaments and has a serpentine coiffure. There is no mount. There is also an image of Varahi, badly damaged, in a munzdi niche on the east side of the jagamohana of the late thirteenth-century Yameivara temple at Bhubaneswar, two-armed and seated in lalitisana. She holds a vessel or kapala in her left hand while the object in the right is indistinct. She has a pot-belly and though her snout is missing, her boar ears are clearly visible. Her hair is arranged in a single radiating tier of serpent curls. There is no mount. 37 Krishna C. Panigrahi, History of Orissa: Hindu Period (Cuttack, 1981), 334. 173</page><page sequence="20">E. Standing Images of Varahi In addition to those non-matrka associated seated images of Varahi, there are four surviving standing images which were housed in external niches of Sakta temples, the two in situ serving as pariva-devatds. In all four cases Vardhi has an ideal feminine body without the pot-belly of seated images. In the detached image from the ruins of the Bhimeivari temple at Ped.gadi, she is eight- armed and stands in a slightly flexed pose holding a sword in her major right hand while her left raises a kapdla to her mouth, her tongue lapping up its contents (fig. I3). The only remaining intact object in her right hand is a rosary, the missing objects being presumably a kartri (sacrificial knife) and arrows. The lower left hand is in varada while the remaining hands hold a shield and a stringed bow. She wears a yajnopavita and other body ornaments though surface details have been left uncarved. She has the head of a boar and her hair is arranged in two tiers of radiating serpent-curls. The attendants in the lower corners, each holding a sword in the right hand, are only blocked out. The pedestal is plain and there is no mount. A similar eight-armed Varahi is now placed in the jagamohana of the Kuttamcandi temple at Debidol, near Kunde.vara in Cuttack district. She likewise laps flesh from a kapala held to her mouth by her major left hand. Only traces of the sword and a rosary are visible in the badly damaged right hands. Her lower left hand is in varada and the other hands hold a stringed bow and the shield. The attendants at the base are obscured by dirt and coats of paint. In contrast to these two late tenth-century examples, the two thirteenth-century images in situ have only four arms. In the example from the Garigeovari temple at Beyalisbati, housed in the east rdhd niche (the temple faces south), Varahi stands in a tribhanga pose with her major right hand holding a sword, mostly broken off, while the left raises a kapdla to her mouth as in the eight-armed images (fig. I4). Her lower right hand holds a kartri and the lower left holds a shield. She has a yajiopavita and is richly ornamented. She wears a short dhoti and a diaphanous scarf which crosses from her waist over her left breast. Her snout is broken but her protruding tongue is visible. Her coiffure consists of two radiating tiers of serpentine curls and a jewelled tiara. A vidyddhara is at each upper corner of her back-slab while below, opposite her shoulders, are a pair of stylized hamtsas (viewed from above) with jewels dripping from their beaks.38 Immediately below each hamsa is an abbreviated bandhand of three moldings. At the base of the back-slab on either side is a female attendant duplicating the features of Varahi but having only two arms. Each holds a kartri and eats from a kapla. The second Vdrahi image appears in the north rdhd niche of the Devi shrine in the northeast corner of the compound of the Buddhanatha Siva temple at Garedipaficana. There Varlhi assumes an identical pose. Both right hands are broken off. Her left hands hold the kapala and a shield. Her boar-head is framed by a hamisa-torana with a krrtimukha at the apex. Above the hamisa on the proper right is a small image of Ganela while the corresponding figure on the left (Karttikeya?) has his hands in front of his chest. The attendants at the base, holding a sword and a kapala, are each housed in a pidha-munzdi. Again there is no mount. Neither the eight-armed nor the four-armed standing forms correspond to any known textual descriptions of Varahi. None of her ayudhas or cognizances can be associated with Visnu, specifically 38 Similar stylized birds appear on images of Camunda though more likely they represent owls. These birds are so stylized their exact identity is unclear. In many cases, in fact, they almost appear like lotus buds, as here, but they are birds and frequently form part of the torana design framing the back-slab, in which case they are depicted in a more natural manner. 174</page><page sequence="21">his Varaha avatar. She represents a uniquely Sakta concept and is, in fact, more closely associated with Siva as is evident when serving as a pariva-devatd. At Garedipaficana, for example, the other pdriva-devatds are Gane'a and Bhairava while at BeyalisbaFti they are Gane'a and Parvati. An image of Ganesa (and possibly one of Karttikeya) is even carved on the back-slab of the image of Varahi at Garedipaficana. That Varihi is terrifying, despite her ideal feminine figure in these standing forms, is evident not only by her weapons and boar face, but even more so by the kartri and the kapdla, dyudhas utilized in human sacrifice and the eating of flesh (which she is doing) which associate her with rituals attributed to the Sakta and related Tantric sects such as the Kapalikas. The terrifying aspect of Varahi is also evident in secondary figures associated with her, such as dvdrapdlas. At Caurasi, for example, the female door guards flanking the entrance to the sanctum, though having a human head, have a pot-belly and a serpentine coiffure. They hold a kapdla in one hand, as if offering its contents to the visitor to the temple, while the other, placed on the hip, holds a noose. On the Samlai temple at Sonepur in Bolangir district, the door guards in niches flanking the entrance of the jagamohana, assume the complementary Vlidha and pratydlidha poses on the right and left respectively. Each has the head of a boar and is four-armed. The right guard holds a cakra and a sword in her right hands while the left carry a kartri and a lotus (?). The left guard carries a kartrri and lotus (?) in the right hands while the left hold a conch and a sword. They each wear a garland of skulls and pdtra-kundalas while their hair is dishevelled. Whereas the poses and Vaisnava weapons suggest the heroic valor of Varaha, the garland of skulls along with the sword and kartrr are indicative of the terrifying Sdkta nature of these guards. These images probably date to the eighteenth century like the temple. The image of the mdtrk- Varahi within the jagamohana of the Samlai temple, forming part of an Astama-trk set in which all of the mothers are depicted in terrifying forms, also shows Vaisnava influence, particularly in respect to the alidha pose, the conventional pose assumed by the anthropomorphic Varaha when rescuing the Earth. She is four-armed and wears a garland of skulls. Her major right hand holds a kartrr while the left holds an indistinct object, possibly a conch. Her uplifted rear right hand wields a sword while her left stuffs a demon into her gaping mouth. She has the head of a boar; her dishevelled hair flares straight back and down her shoulders. She has long, sagging breasts and is thin-waisted, features suggesting the original blood-thirsty and devouring nature of the matrkds, who were created to help defeat demons on the battlefield. She is accompanied by a seated jackal. This heroic pose, suggesting Vaisnava influence, also appears on numerous other late images of Vdrahi, as at Jogiralli ghdt, near Kantilo, where she serves as the presiding deity of a small shrine. She is two-armed and assumes the a-lidha pose while trampling on a demon, in the manner of Varaha trampling on the serpents. Her raised right hand wields a sword while the left holds an indistinct object to her mouth. Surface details are obscured by accretions of paste applied in puji rituals. At Palur, in Ganjam district, she serves as a pariva-devatr on a small Sakta shrine, four- armed and shown in an alidha pose while trampling on a serpent. Her right hands hold a serpent and a sword while the objects in her left hands, possibly a conch and a cakra, are indistinct. She wears a garland of skulls and appears to be supporting an object (Earth?) on her tusks. In essence, then, though Varahi has the head of a boar, she is conceived in Orissan sculpture primarily as a terrifying Sakta divinity, whether serving as a matrka or an independent deity, seated or standing; and she has little in common with Varaha as an avatar of Visnu, aside from her sow face. She seldom carries Vaisnava dyudhas and her association with the boar is due primarily to its ferocious I75</page><page sequence="22">nature. Although her pot-belly, symbolically suggesting her cosmic role as a container of milk and butter, is possibly an underlying reason for her continued popularity as a mother in mdtrkd sets, the less popular Nrsirihi being equally ferocious but lacking such maternal features, this aspect is more closely associated with Varaha's identity with Surya than with Visnu. Rather than stressing her maternal aspect, however, the pot-belly more likely is based on the massive body of the boar with it layers of fat and its voracious appetite, its expanding and enveloping nature a prefect complement to the emaciated Camunda, the one always eating and the other forever hungry; both hold a kapdla and in particular stress the terrifying aspect of the mdtrkds. This inclusion of both a pot-bellied and an emaciated female in a set where the other figures have ideal feminine physiques is a testament to the typically Indian love of extremes. As a madtrkd the cognizances held in her major hands are the fish and the kapdla. The objects held in her uplifted hands on early images include the rosary, a hatchet, a lotus, a goad, or a noose. Once a child is introduced on her lap, the fish and the kapdla are shifted to the uplifted rear hands. In rare examples the goad replaces the fish while a noose or a danda replaces the kapdla. As in the case of the other mdtrkds, her pose changes from the sattvaparyanka on the earliest set to the ardhaparyanika and eventually to the lalitdsana pose. Her coiffure likewise changes from matted hair to the karanda- mukuta and eventually to her distinctive style of serpentine-curls arranged in two radiating tiers. The nara-vdhana on the earliest images is replaced by the buffalo mount. The seated images serving as presiding deities all date from the tenth century and thus are similar in iconographic features. Each is two-armed and holds a fish and the kapdla. The most conspicuous difference is the seated pose of which there are three variations - lalitdsana, ardhaparyaika, and bhadrdsana - the last being an innovation not encountered with mdtrka images. Her coiffure is transitional between the earlier karanda-mukuta and the later serpentine style of radiating tiers. She has either the buffalo or the nara-vdhana on her pedestal with the latter depicted in ardhaparyaika rather than squatting as on the earliest matrka images. The smaller independent seated images may be either two- or four-armed with the uplifted rear hands of the latter invariably holding the goad and a noose. They may be seated in ardhaparyaika or lalitdsana. The mount may be either the nara- vahana or the buffalo. Although the pot held by Varahi may symbolically refer to the ghrta-kumbha concept of Varaha (Suirya), the vessel, rather than containing nectar or Pravargya, probably holds liquor or blood, liquids the mdtrkis were especially fond of drinking. This is particularly evident from the late eighth century onward where the pot, generally an auspicious symbol, is transformed into a kapdla, a Sakta/Tantra vessel associated with Bhairava, Camunda, and gruesome rituals. The fish, though a Tantric panca- makara, may originally have been selected for its aquatic and universally auspicious nature (being a fertility symbol), its possible affiliation with Tantrism beginning with the introduction of the kapala. The noose, equally appropriate to rescue and to bind, likewise useful both on land and water, associates her with Varuna, the god of waters, and Yama, the god of death. The goad, associating her with both Parvati and Indra (the storm god), the latter recalling the boar's identification with clouds, is equally useful on land and water. The hatchet and rosary relate her to Ganela and Siva respectively. The nara-vahana, associated with a preta in the Devi Bhagavata Purina, bears little resemblance to Garuda, the man-bird mount of Visnu, while Varaha himself has no mount. Thus none of the weapons held by the seated images of Varahi in Orissa can be associated with Varaha, nor can her vdhana, whether it be a nara-vahana or the buffalo. In contrast to the independent images of 176</page><page sequence="23">Camundd, frequently accompanied by an image of Bhairava (her male counterpart), either placed in the sanctum next to her or serving as a pariva-devatad, no corresponding image of Varaha (male counterpart) is associated with Vdrahi. At Caurdsi, in fact, the two surviving pariva-devatds are Surya and Gane'a while the missing one was probably Bhairava. The buffalo, along with the noose and the club (danda), closely associate Varahi with Yama, whose mother is Saranyf (cloud). His buffalo form is called Fearful (Ugra), suggesting that the beast not only has a massive belly like the boar but is equally ferocious. The ferocity of Varahi is particularly evident in the Brahmdnda Purdna (Lalita-mahatmya, 17.3-8, 14-15) where, in the march of the army of Syamala against the demon Bhanda, she is called Potrimukhi/Potrigi (Boar-faced?). The many soldiers in her army had boar-faces and the same size, shape, and ornaments as Potrimukhi. They carried the same weapons, were likewise dark in complexion with ruthless eyes, rode buffaloes, and smoke and flames issued forth from their mouths, between sharp, curved teeth. As the goddess betook herself to the task of slaying the demons with blazing fury, the mobile and immobile beings of the three worlds experienced excessive excitement and alarm. Frightened in their hearts, the heaven-dwellers in the firmament thought thus: Will this Potrini (Boar-faced deity) burn down now itself the entire universe by means of her fiery anger? Will she split the earth into two by striking it with her club? Or will she agitate and stir up the oceans by means of her weapon plough?39 Here, in contrast to the concept of Varaha rescuing the earth, the gods feared that the ferocious Vara-hi, equally at home in water and on land, would destroy the earth due to her fiery anger. As in the case of Yama, her ferocity is manifested by her massive body, and that of her mount, as much as by her weapons. In standing images, where Varahi does not have a pot-belly, the terrifying principle is conveyed as much by her sow face, the kartri, and her activity of eating flesh from a kapdla as it is by her many weapons. Whereas the sword, shield, bow and arrows affiliate her with Durga, the warrior aspect of the Devi, the rosary suggests her meditative nature and the varada-mudrad reflects her charitable nature, seemingly antagonistic qualities manifested by all of the mdtrkds who are invariably invoked to remove obstacles and grant liberation, as in the Karnejapa-stotra of the Kulaci.ddmani Nigama (chapter III).4o Even when propitiated to liberate children from afflictions imposed by evil spirits, as in the Agni Purdna (299.50-5I), it is their terrifying nature that is invoked; they are asked to attack, explode, seize, and drive away these evil spirits. This antagonism, inherent in the very concept of matrkas, blood-thirsty warriors as well as loving mothers, is particularly evident in Varahi who, though ostensibly ugly and terrifying by conventional standards, is equally beautiful and loving to her devotees even though she causes as well as prevents epidemics. Indeed, her great popularity in Orissa as an independent deity no doubt stemmed from the belief that she is the cause of all epidemics and it was believed by the people that, to ward off all such perils, it was necessary to propitiate her.4I 39 Brahmdnda Purdna, trans, by Ganesh Vasudeo Tagare (Delhi, 1984), IV, 11ol-oz.

In the Vajrayana pantheon, the goddess Vajravarahi is characterized by a sow-faced excrescence near her right ear. As the prajnU of Sambara, she is red, wears a garland of severed heads, has a kha.tdiga as a girdle, is nude and three-eyed, and has dishevelled hair. She holds the vajra and the kapdla.42 As an emanation of Vairocana and the first queen of Heruka, she is nude, displays intense and passionate love, and may have two or four hands. In one sddhana she is described as red and stands in pratydlidha trampling the Brahmanical deities Bhairava and Kalaratri. She wears a garland of heads still wet with blood, which she drinks, and holds in her right hand the vajra and displays tarjani-mudra~ (raised index finger) while in the left hand she holds the kapdla, the arm cradling the khatudiga. As Vasya- Vajravarahi, in a second sddhana, where she is invoked for the purpose of bewitching, she holds the kartri in her right hand while displaying tarjani, the left hand again holding a kapdla and cradling a khatvdfiga. She dances in ardhaparyanka on a corpse. As the four-armed Arya-Vajravarahi, she carries a vajra and a goad in the right hands while in the left she holds the kapala, the arm cradling the khatviniga, and displays tarjani, the hand holding a noose. She stands in dlidha on a corpse.43 In the Vajraydne Pu-jaividhi, Vajravarahi is nude, of red complexion and has dishevelled hair. She carries a kap-la, vajra, and a chopper while displaying tarjani. She is depicted copulating with her male counterpart.44 Although there are numerous images scattered throughout Orissa which have tentatively been identified as Vajravardhi, including examples from Chaudar,45 Dharmaiala, and Kapila, the absence of the boar excrescence precludes positive identification.The image serving as the presiding deity of the Vdsuli temple at Badgaon, near Bahandga in Balasore district, apparently conforms to the dhyana in the Sddhanamild where she holds the vajra, and displays tarjani with her right hand while her left holds the kapala and cradles the khatvpinga. It is clothed, however, and is thus not available for inspection.46 In these Buddhist images of Vajravarahi, it is primarily her pose, trampling a corpse or Brahmanical deities, the tarjani mudra, and her cognizances, i.e., the vajra, kapdla, kartrT, kha.tvpinga, noose, and goad, which are terrifying, as her boar excrescence is barely visible and she has an ideal feminine physique. More popular is the related image of the goddess Marici, her left face generally that of a sow, who rides in a chariot pulled by seven sows. The close relationship between Mdrici and Varahi is particularly evident on an image of Varahi from Jogeivari (Almora district of U.P.) where she has two heads, the major head being human while the left is that of a sow, the head projecting from behind ber left ear almost like the excrescence characteristic of Vajravardhi though on the opposite side.47 Although the original solar aspect appears to be lost in the iconography of Varaha/Varahi, aside from descriptions of the dark cloud-like color of Varahi or the lotus-medallion above the head of Varaha in Orissan sculptures, it is still in evidence with Marici who is called the "goddess of Dawn" in Tibet where she is invoked by the Lamas every morning at sunrise. In many of the earliest Orissan images at Ratnagiri, her chariot is pulled by horses to suggest her affiliation with Suirya, the sun- 42 Benoytosh Bhattacharyya, The Indian Buddhist Iconography (Calcutta, 1968), 161. 43 Ibid., 217-19. 44 D.C.

XXXIII. 178</page><page sequence="25">god.4 As an emanation of the Buddha Vairocana, she has sixteen sddhanas in the Sddhanamdld which describe six distinct forms. She may have one, three, five, or six faces, while her arms number two, eight, ten, or twelve. In the Nispannayogdvali, she is described as having three faces and six arms. Her spiritual sire is ?avata or Vairocana and her seven sows represent seven rays of the Sun-god. The most popular form of Marici in sculptural art is Astabhujapita or Sariksipta-Marici. She is either white (sddhana No. 134) or yellow (sddhana No. 137) in color, wears red garments, is heavily bejewelled, bears the effigy of Vairocana on the crown, and resides within the cavity of a caitya. The left face, blue in color, is that of a sow and is terrifying, displaying bare fangs and protruding lips. She stands in pratydlidha (with right leg bent) on a chariot drawn by seven pigs and appears like a virgin in the fullness of youth. She has eight arms with her lowest set holding a needle and thread while the others hold the goad and noose, the bow and arrows, and the vajra and the aloka flower. With the needle and thread she sews up the mouths and eyes of the wicked; she strikes their hearts with the goad and binds them with the noose; she pierces them with the bow and arrow; with the vajra (thunderbolt) she shatters their hearts and the aloka bough is used to sprinkle them with water. Below the seven sows is the fierce Rdhu, the ascending node, who devours the sun and the moon. Marici is surrounded by four companion goddesses; to the east is Varttdli; to the south Vaddli; to the west Vardli; and to the north Vardhamukhi.49 In sculpture each of these generally has the head of a sow as prescribed in sddhana No. 137. In Orissan examples, Vardli usually doubles as the charioteer and is placed at the front of the chariot, straddling the image of Rdhu, to suggest that Mdrici is moving westward across the sky in the manner of a solar deity. There are at least fourteen large images in Orissa corresponding to this description, ranging from Sonepur in the west to Ramcandi in the east, from Khiching in the north to Acutrajpur in the south, all of which can be dated from the tenth to the twelfth centuries (figs. 15-16). There are five sddhanas in the Sddhanamdlad (Nos. 136, 138, 139, 140, and 143) which describe a different form of Marici, three of which name her as Oddiymna Mdrici, one as Vajradhdtvi!vari Mdrici and one simply as Marici. All of these sddhanas are similar except for minor variations in respect to the dyudhas. In each sddhana, Marici has twelve hands and six faces, the sixth being that of a sow and placed above the other five. She is fierce in appearance, pot-bellied, with tawny hair rising up like flames, wears a garland of skulls, has a waist band of serpents and a tiger-skin as dress. Vairocana is her consort and she has a female charioteer who displays tarjanika-pdia and holds an asoka in her two hands. According to sddhana No. 136, her right hands hold a khadga, misala, -ara, ankusla, ekasicika vajra (single-prong), and aparaiu while the left hands display sapdia-tarjant, kapila, head of Brahma, alokapallava, chapa, and trident. In sddhana No. 138 the weapons are the same except the aitkula is replaced by a vajra (double-pronged). In sddhana No. 139 the ankuia is replaced by a cakra and a khatvdinga is added, probably cradled by the hand holding the kapala. In sddhana No. 14o the atikuia is replaced by a vilva-vajra (double vajra). Sddhana No. 143 has the identical weapons as No. 138.50 S.K. Saraswati, while illustrating two Nepali paintings of this form of Marici, dating to the eleventh century and labeled either Oddiyvna-Marici or Odiyvna-Marici, each of whom has only three extant heads, mentions that so far there are no known representations of this form of Marici in sculpture.5 48 See Debala Mitra, Ratnagiri (1958-61), MASI no. 80 (New Delhi, 1981) vol. I, pls. LXXVI-LXXVIII. 49 B. Bhattacharyya, op. cit., 2o9. o50 Ibid., zI24. 51 S.K. Saraswati, Tantraydna Art: An Album (Calcutta, 1977), LXXXIX. 179</page><page sequence="26">Although N.N. Vasu mentions seeing an image of Oddiyvna-Marici in the Panchpir sub-division of Mayurbhanj district, he unfortunately does not describe or illustrate it.51 I have, however, come across an example serving as a presiding deity in a small temple at Maricipur, a small village near where the Devi river empties into the Bay of Bengal, about six miles from Machagaon in Cuttack district. Marici stands in pratydlidha on a chariot pulled by seven sows as prescribed in the dhydnas, though the back of the chariot is designed as apidha-mundi (small temple), as on numerous Surya images, rather than the womb of a caitya. She has a pot-belly, wears a garland of skulls, and is richly ornamented (fig. 18). She has six faces, the small sixth face aligned above the other five and represented as a sow, though the two flanking faces on either side of the center face have recently been recarved by a Bengali sculptor, the originals having been obliterated. The small sow-face is framed by her typically radiating serpentine curls to which are added a pair of hands and two serpent-hoods. The latter, along with the flame-like treatment of her coiffure rising above the sow-head, are terrifying features conventionally associated with Cdmundd. Unfortunately, many of the hands and dyudhas are broken off or improperly restored, as in the case of the lowest two right hands which now display abhaya and varada. Only the ekasucika vajra and the pestle (misala) remain intact in the right hands. The major right hand probably held the sword while the lowest hand may have held an arrow as in the paintings. The other two hands would have held the ahikusa or cakra and the paraiu. The only intact objects held in the left hands include the head of Brahma, what appears to be a chopper (?) in the uplifted rear left hand - actually a shield on the paintings - and a kapdla, though this is probably not its original position as the major left hand was most likely in sapada-tarjani as suggested by the serpent. The second lower hand held the alokapallava of which the remains of the branch are partially intact, while the missing object would have been the bow. In essence, then, the only deviation from the s-dhanas, also noticed in the paintings,53 is the object held in the uplifted rear left hand (chopper?) which should have been a trident. There is a single attendant goddess who serves as the charioteer, as prescribed, though she has four hands. She holds a vajra and displays tarjani with her major hands while her rear hands hold arrows and a bow. This is the iconographic description for Varahamukhi though in general the artists do not follow strictly the textual prescriptions for these secondary figures. In some cases they all hold identical dyudhas, particularly in later images of Astabhujapita Mdrici. Here the female charioteer is standing in pratyadlidha between two short balusters. The balusters on each corner of the chariot, along with the railing, are broken off. The seven sows pulling the chariot are frontally depicted and are aligned flush with one another. A second image of Oddiyvna Mdrici has recently been discovered at Odisoandeigoda, a small village adjacent to Singhapur in the Dharmaila area of Cuttack district (fig. I7). Her principal right hand wields a sword while the left is at the chest in tarjant. One of her left hands has a trident. Stylistically these two images can be dated to the late tenth-early eleventh century and are important finds which add further evidence for locating Uddiyanapitha in Orissa. Placed next to the Astabhujapita Marici (fig. 16) in the sanctum of the modern Khutia temple at Ayodhya, in Balasore district, originally belonging to the collapsed Marici Thakurani temple, is a unique independent image of Varahamukhi, worshipped as Varahi by the local populace. She is four- armed and has the face of a sow. She stands in pratyliZdha on the double lotus (vilvapadma). Her major 52 N.N. Vasu, op. cit., XCV. Apparently detailed descriptions were planned for volume II which was never published. 53 The paintings appear in two manuscripts of Astasdhasrika Prajfipdramitd, one dating to A.D. 1015 and the other to A.D. 1071; the later image actually has only ten arms but both hold a shield in the uplifted rear left hand. 180</page><page sequence="27">right hand is raised and holds a vajra while the left is placed in front of her chest in tarjani-pdia, the index finger raised and holding a noose (pdia ). Her rear right and left hands hold a pair of arrows and a stringed bow respectively. Iconographically she conforms closely to a four-armed Mdrici from Udald in eastern Mayurbanj district, now in the Baripada Museum,54 and, in respect to pose and weapons, with her description in sddhana Nos. 134 and 137, except that the tarjani-pdia has replaced the aloka bough. In the sadhanas for these accompanying goddesses, only Vardhamukhi carries a bow and arrows, the other three holding the goad or a vajra, a noose or thread, a needle and the aloka bough in various combinations. Vardhamukhi is richly ornamented and wears a tall conical headdress crowned by a lotus finial. A flying vidyddhara is at each upper corner of the back-slab (fig. I9). In that Mdrici is a Vajraydna Buddhist deity, and many of that sect's celebrated saints belonged to the so-called despised classes, for whom the pig is a favorite animal, D.C. Bhattacharyya has suggested that the pig was associated with Marici not only to indicate her iconographic distinc- tiveness, but also to show some preference for the pet of these despised people who often played a role in Tantric practices.55 The question arises, however, as to why the pig is associated almost exclusively with a terrifying goddess in Vajraydna Buddhism, whether Vajravdra-hi or Mdrici, and seldom with a male deity. As in the case of Vdrdhi, the answer seems to lie in the ferocious and frightening nature of the boar/pig and its antithesis in respect to the physical form of the ideal feminine physique, ugly and terrifying thus being propitiated to frighten away the evil and wicked. In the Astabhujapita Marici images, it is her sow face, her multiple weapons, her tarjani-mudra, pratydl.dha pose and chariot pulled by sows that suggest her terrifying nature. The Oddiyvna/Vajradhatvi'vari form, however, is even more terrifying with her garland of skulls, fierce appearance, and pot-belly. Accordingly, she is invoked for paralyzing, bewildering, and killing all wicked beings. In no way can her pot-belly be associated with maternity. It is meant to suggest massiveness and the terrifying as in the case of other feminine deities with a pot-belly, such as the Buddhist goddess Parnaiavari who likewise stands in pratyalidha and displays tarjani-pdia with one of her hands. She is additionally described as a pisact (eater of flesh) and, like Vdrahi, her worship is believed to be effective in preventing epidemics and trampling diseases. Though she lacks the sow face of Varahi, her dwarfish stature represents another deviation from the norm invoked to terrify and frighten the enemies of the devotee.
