<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Secret'st Man of Blood. A Study of Dramatic Irony in Macbeth WILLIAM BLISSETT ACBETH is a play that has lent itself to frequent and full l analysis,' and several writers have commented in passing on * w MqM the high incidence of dramatic irony in it. There may seem little purpose in isolating this aspect of the play for a treat- * ment which earlier critics have thought fit to leave unmade, presumably because they considered it implicit in their wider studies. The question this paper proposes to raise, however, is whether the definition of dramatic irony that they assumed were not too narrow and whether something at once new and comprehensive might not come into view if a more generous interpretation were given the term. Perhaps this extension of meaning would amount to no more than a con- tinuation of a process some time ago noticed and incisively commented upon by the late Dr. G. G. Sedgewick in his study Of Irony2-a process whereby the word "irony" came no longer to be applied exclusively to the rhetorical trope but more frequently and with increasing critical seriousness to a type of dramatic situation found in Sophoclean and other tragedy, and this "dramatic irony" came to be asserted as of the essence of drama. For if dramatic irony is defined as "the sense of contradiction felt by the spectators at the sight of a character acting in ignorance of his true condition", then all dramatic action is ironic so long as there remains on the stage anyone who knows less than the audience, anyone who still awaits "reversal of situa- tion" and the consequent "recognition" of the truth. Generously compensating for any limitation implied in a "willing suspension of disbelief", is the distinc- tive pleasure of the theatre, the expansive sense of superior wisdom that accom- panies the contemplation of dramatic action. This "general dramatic irony" comes to focus normally in specific situations: obviously, when a character in- tentionally makes a remark that we recognize as not fully understood by others on the stage-as in Macbeth's speech at the discovery of the murder of Duncan; less obviously, when the character says something that has closer application to his own circumstances than he knows-as in the same speech: Had I but died an hour before this chance, I had liv'd a blessed time; for, from this instant, There's nothing serious in mortality; 1I am indebted to the studies of Macbeth by the following contemporary writers: Messrs. Cleanth Brooks, W. C. Curry, G. Wilson Knight, L. C. Knights, F. R. Leavis, J. Middleton Murry, H. N. Paul, and most especially Roy Walker. The new Arden edition, edited by Kenneth Muir, has been used throughout. 2 G. G. Sedgewick, Of Irony, Especially in Drama (Toronto, I935, 1948).</page><page sequence="2">398 SHAKESPEARE QUARTERLY All is but toys: renown, and grace, is dead; The wine of life is drawn, and the mere lees Is left this vault to brag of. This is the sort of dramatic irony that successive commentators have discov- ered in Macbeth, and it must continue to claim its due weight in any analysis of the play. In the light, however, of recent criticism and research, a new dimension of dramatic irony may suggest itself, one which can be grasped only by what may be called an analysis in depth of the poetic action. That is to say, dramatic irony may be regarded not only as a figure of speech or as an element in the plot, as a matter of verbal expression or of stage situation, but as occurring whenever a speech fits into a pattern of imagery or system of sig- nificance of which the audience has a clearer and more complete awareness than the speaker. Before a sample of such an analysis can be offered, it will be necessary to define the point of view to be taken toward the play-whether modern or his- torical, whether literary or dramatic. What I think should be sought is the full- est possible response of a historically informed modern sensibility to the play in the theatre. It is admitted that we are not Jacobeans and never will be, and that we can never recover that state of innocence in which the outcome of the dramatic action was unknown. The ears that hear the actor say, "from this instant there's nothing serious in mortality", will be neither surprised nor for- getful when "tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow, creeps in this petty pace from day to day." About the response of the original audience we can only speculate. The more we know, the better; but whenever something comes clear to us, whether it can be proved Jacobean or not, we can but accept it gratefully. When I say "historically informed", I mean, of course, possessed of the sort of information supplied by editors and annotators. But I mean also, informed concerning the framework of concepts and processes of thought current in Shakespeare's England. At the cost of losing altogether the sweep of the dra- matic action, the bulk of this paper will consist of four digressions in which I shall try to indicate the way that the ideas and images of air, blood, seed, and time are used structurally so as to become inextricably bound up with the action and to constitute a dimension of dramatic irony. The first digression is a digression of air. As is well known, until the rise of modern analytic and quantitative science, the mind of Western man moved in a world of four elements-earth, water, air, and fire. That order is not hap- hazard but is an order of rising dignity, an order which is at once seen to be anthropomorphic and conducive to mythical treatment, whereby human mean- ings are freely implanted on the external world. So much is this the case that a whole scheme of human life as development falls naturally into place in terms of these elements. The child (to make a composite, crude, and skeletal myth) is born of Mother Earth and is (as Shakespearian children curiously to modern taste are) a miniature adult, but inert, unformed, unquickened. Rising in the scale, the youth sports with nymphs by fountain and rill, and is quick and unstable as water. The mature man, however, must rise to responsible in- tellectual life and choose among the ideas that are, so to speak, in the air, often devoting his life to the service of one, be she Justice, Wisdom, the muse, or</page><page sequence="3">THE SECRET'ST MAN OF BLOOD 399 other aerial spirit. Finally, he may hope, with Spenser, for that "Sabbaoths sight" of God who is spirit and consuming fire.3 Such patterns as these pervade our language and thought and may be so ingrained that their eradication would be impossible even if regarded as desirable. There are, however, certain mixed or hybrid states-regressive, to use a modern term. The nymph and bride of pure and quickening water have their muddy opposite in the harlot; the celestial patroness of clear and sweet air is matched by the witch that hovers through the fog and filthy air, whose whole endeavor is to confuse the mind with the winds of doctrine, to blur dis- tinctions, so that fair seems foul and foul, fair. For the air has long been recognized as the abode of fallen spirits, Satan himself being, in Pauline phrase, the Prince of the powers of the air; and the qualities of impure air-fogginess, poor visibility, lack of outline, deceptiveness, instability, and in the case of air made foul by death, the breath of corruption -lie ready at the disposal of the poet, of him who makes sense of the sensible world. The element of air dominates Macbeth to a greater degree even than fire and air together dominate Antony and Cleopatra, and its use is not just "atmos- pheric" but is intimately connected with the theme of the play. Not only have the Witches, or their masters, the outward power to control (rather, decontrol) the weather,4 to raise shipwracking storms, to untie the winds and let them fight against the churches, but they have an even more fearful power to destroy the soul of the man of impure will from within. It is certain that Macbeth after the inspiration of fog and filthy air on the blasted heath-the wilderness or place of temptation-never thinks clearly again. When Banquo asks whither the Witches are vanished, Macbeth replies, Into the air; and what seem'd corporal, Melted as breath into the wind. "Would they had stay'd!" he adds, betraying from the start a willingness to breathe this tainted breath. The atmosphere of the play is not entirely tainted: there are airs from heaven as well as blasts from hell. Lady Macbeth cannot at once extinguish all the light in the world, though she calls upon thick night to pall her in the dunnest smoke of hell. This is impressed upon us in the scene immediately following, for the highest degree of dramatic contrast and irony is achieved when Duncan remarks: This Castle hath a pleasant seat; the air Nimbly and sweetly recommends itself Unto our gentle senses, and Banquo takes up the same train of thought, revealing by his mention of the temple haunting martlet and omission of the croaking raven the difference 3 An alternative myth would assign earth and melancholy to old age. This would be a myth of the cycle of nature, not of spiritual development. For an application of mythical interpretation to The Tempest, see Colin Still, The Timeless Theme (London, 1936). 4 Early in the Golden Ass of Apuleius, when the power of witches over the elements is asserted, a skeptic dismisses it as "high and tragical talk" (Adlington's Elizabethan translation).</page><page sequence="4">400 SHAKESPEARE QUARTERLY between his world of perception and that of the Macbeths.5 This is only a momentary respite, a breather: Macbeth's evil prayer-"stars, hide your fires" -is granted-"there's husbandry in heaven; their candles are all out." The atmosphere of the play from the beginning is black and confused: in the outer world light thickens (contrast the vanishing of the wholesome spirits of the Tempest into thin air) and the little world of man is troubled with thick coming fancies. The Witches first appear hovering through the fog and filthy air as they come to tempt Macbeth; at the end, their victim curses them and himself- Infected be the air whereon they ride; And damn'd all those that trust them! Macbeth's career begins physically on a blasted heath; it ends spiritually in the same place when he cries: Blow, wind! come, wrack! At least we'll die with harness on our back. A similar system, likewise tied to the framework of the four elements in their human and mythical meaning, is the one centering on the use of the image of blood. A blood count shows this play to be uniquely gory: its half a hundred uses of the various forms of the word "blood" is remarkable and has often been commented upon. One interesting set of correspondences has not, however, to my knowledge, been drawn. The four outer elements have their counterpart within in the four bodily humours-earth with black bile, water with phlegm, fire with choler, and air with blood. We of course today know that the blood is in fact the agent for carrying the oxygen of the air to the cells of the body, but we must not forget that the close connection, the mingling in the lungs, of air and blood had been uni- versally recognized from primitive times. For the Greeks, the stuff of conscious- ness, thymos, was located as the vapor arising from the hot blood concentrated in the heart and around it in the lungs, and the word has been variously inter- preted as meaning "blood soul" and "breath soul"." It was with an insight embodied in the language he used that Hippocrates was able to assert that a "man is what he breathes". What Macbeth breathes is, in Bradley's phrase, an "ensanguined mist". Be- 5 The same effect, by the way, is sought and gained in The Tempest. Adrian, one of the hale and holy persons, comments on the enchanted isle, "The air breathes upon us here most sweetly", at which the villains Sebastian and Antonio sneer: As if it had lungs and rotten ones. Or as 'twere perfum'd by a fen. The two plays are companion pieces in their shortness and singleness of effect, in the contrast of Ariel and the Witches and of Prospero and Macbeth. Prospero doffs the magic belt of rule to save his soul; Macbeth dies to both worlds with harness on his back. 6 See R. B. Onians, The Origins of European Thought (Cambridge, I95I), chapter 3 and passim. The ancient conception of blood-soul or breath-soul survives at least as late as Milton, as is attested by his description of Satan's designs on the sleeping Eve: Or if, inspiring venom, he might taint Th'animal Spirits that from pure blood arise Like gentle breaths from Rivers pure, thence raise At least distemper'd, discontented thoughts, Vain hopes, vain aims, inordinate desires Blown up with high conceits ingend'ring pride. Paradise Lost, IV, 804-809.</page><page sequence="5">THE SECRET'ST MAN OF BLOOD 40I fore he even appears on the stage, the Captain, himself drenched in blood, relates how Macbeth's sword in battle "smoked with bloody execution". It would perhaps be pressing analogies too far to state that the Witches rise from the field of carnage as the shades return to Ulysses' trough of blood or the spirits in Yeats's "Byzantium" are "blood begotten". It is sufficient to suggest that the continual blood-letting from the beginning to the end of the play serves to keep the air foul and filthy and that the foulness of the air in turn makes thick the blood of the Macbeths. The murkiest points are reached in the fourth act when the Witches end their incantation on this stifling note: Pour in sow's blood, that hath eaten Her nine farrow; grease, that's sweaten From the murder's gibbet, throw Into the flame. And in the fifth when from the bottom of the fetid air Lady Macbeth cries, "Here's the smell of the blood still." A fume of memory lurks in the reeking wounds and memorizes another Golgotha. The blood that stains the air stains the mind. The tainted air, willingly breathed, inspires bloody hallucination: I see thee still; And on thy blade, and dudgeon, gouts of blood, Which was not so before.-There's no such thing. It is the bloody business which informs Thus to mine eyes. And when the deed of blood is done, it is as if the whole world of experience were corrupted: Will all great Neptune's ocean wash this blood Clean from my hand? No, this my hand will rather The multitudinous seas incarnadine, Making the green one red. The blood-dimmed tide has come in after the murder of Banquo, and Macbeth no longer stands hesitant on the brink of his bank and shoal: I am in blood Stepp'd in so far, that, should I wade no more, Returning were as tedious as go o'er. I have seized upon one aspect of the blood imagery in the play and given it perhaps too heavy-handed and literal a treatment. Certainly it is necessary to bring out another and complementary aspect at this point. Blood when shed, especially the innocent blood, the blood of king, kinsman, guest, sticks on the hands as the foulest and most indelible stain, calling like righteous Abel's to Heaven for vengeance, as Macbeth's conscience realizes in a final extremity of pain before it dies: It will have blood: they say blood will have blood: Stones have been known to move, and trees to speak; Augures, and understood relations, have By magot-pies, and choughs, and rooks, brought forth The secret'st man of blood.</page><page sequence="6">402 SHAKESPEARE QUARTERLY But the thought of bloodshed has so powerful an emotional impact not because blood is itself foul, but quite the contrary because it is the most sacred of things, the residence of life and of racial and family identity. The contrast or polarity of bloodstain and lifeblood, as we may call these two hemispheres of meaning, is well illustrated in the two following passages. Just after the murder of Duncan Lady Macbeth makes her grim pun, If he do bleed, I'll gild the faces of the grooms withal, For it must seem their guilt. After it has been discovered, in a speech of Macbeth's the irony of which has already been noticed, the sense of stain yields place to a sense of desecration of something holy, even sacramental: The wine of life is drawn, and the mere lees Is left this vault to brag of. And it is significant that he goes on immediately in addressing the King's son to associate blood with family continuity: The spring, the head, the fountain of your blood Is stopp'd; the very source of it is stopp'd. Blood is a symbol of life itself, built into the structure of language and of the human world. Its qualities of warmth, density, and richness of color, its quickness of motion so accurately reflecting the health and vitality of the whole person-all associate it with life and the source of life; and this association was the stronger in the Elizabethan mind for the ancient and as yet unchallenged belief that human seed was the finest concoction of the blood. Blood and its refined essence, seed, within the temple are life and grace; the wilful and violent spilling of either is sin and death. But even from this evil good can come, as is recognized in the saying, the blood of the martyrs is the seed of the Church. So the blood of Duncan but more especially that of Banquo is the seed of the kingdom newly united in Shakespeare's day, indeed at the time of the writing of Macbeth, a play very likely written and performed at the command of Banquo's descendent, King James. The minds of these characters naturally employ images of planting and fructification. Duncan, for instance, in acknowledging Macbeth's speech of loyalty and duty, says: Welcome hither: I have begun to plant thee, and will labour To make thee full of growing.-Noble Banquo, That hast no less deserv'd, nor must be known No less to have done so, let me infold thee, And hold thee to my heart. And it is Banquo, not Macbeth, who takes up Duncan's metaphor in his reply: There if I grow, The harvest is your own.</page><page sequence="7">THE SECRET'ST MAN OF BLOOD 403 Banquo it was, we may recall, who thus addressed the Witches in the scene preceding: If you can look into the seeds of time, And say which grain will grow, and which will not, Speak then to me, who neither beg, nor fear, Your favours nor your hate. The terms of the question-the telescoping of "sands of time" and "seeds"- no less than the promise in the reply of fruitfulness and dominion recall the prophecy to Abraham: "I will multiply thy seed as the stars of heaven, and as the sand which is upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies." While these seminal images are assigned exclusively to Duncan and Banquo, the contrast of fruitfulness and sterility to which they contribute and which will become more marked as the play progresses, is not immediately drawn. Rosse in the second scene of the play requires us to think of Macbeth as a potent figure-and not only in warfare-in referring to him as Bellona's bride- groom; and something of the same effect is achieved in Lady Macbeth's char- acterization of her husband as full of the milk of human kindness.7 It is she who by an act of demonic will unsexes herself and perverts her husband's sexual power into destructive channels so that Bellona's bridegroom becomes a Tarquin with ravishing strides moving like a ghost toward his design. Their carnal, bloody, and unnatural acts-to rob a phrase from a neighbor- ing play-are fruitless. Though not afeared to be the same in his own act and valor as he is in desire, Macbeth finds that the bloody and poisoned chalice from which he has drunk "provokes the desire but takes away the performance". As for Lady Macbeth, willingly unsexed, her milk taken for gall, she has dashed out the brains of the naked newborn babe Pity. How ironic is her husband's admiring cry, Bring forth men-children only! For thy undaunted mettle should compose Nothing but males. 7 In primitive thought, the free flowing of bodily secretions was regarded as evidence of genial- ity-in the root meaning of the word; so here; and so too in Duncan's "drops of sorrow", which should not be taken as indicating weakness. The world of psychological and physiological assump- tion described by Professor Onians is still Shakespeare's world in large degree, but is most espe- cially apparent in the "antiquity" from which the playwright took the action of his play. For in- stance, the primitive ascription to brain and marrow of the role of source of life and storehouse of seed is reflected when Macbeth sees the ghost of Banquo whom he had thought to make sterile by doing to death: The time has been, That when the brains were out, the man would die. And again, Thy bones are marrowless, thy blood is cold. If the brain stores the seed, then the head is the residence of potency and hair its outward sign and boast. Banquo lies with "twenty trenched gashes on his head"; Macbeth sees him as "blood boltered"; as "shaking his gory locks"; even when drenched in the blood of murder, the head and locks of Banquo are full of the blood of life; by the dead Banquo, as by the living, Macbeth's genius (with a sense here of "genial power") is rebuked. This is somewhat different from the use of the head and the eye as genital symbols in the more familiar Freudian manner-though that too is an important part of Shakespeare's technique in this play: winking, blinding, and beheading being successive stages in a cumulative image of castration. Macbeth has poured the sweet milk of concord into hell: he has no children.</page><page sequence="8">404 SHAKESPEARE QUARTERLY After the murder of Duncan, the deed of darkness, has been consummated, the ravisher of the Crown recalls the promise of the Witches to Banquo, and obsessively he belabors the contrast of Banquo's fruitfulness and his own sterility: There is none but he Whose being I do fear: and under him My Genius is rebuk'd; as, it is said, Mark Antony's was by Caesar. He chid the Sisters, When first they put the name of King upon me, And bade them speak to him; then, prophet-like, They hail'd him father to a line of kings: Upon my head they plac'd a fruitless crown, And put a barren sceptre in my gripe, Thence to be wrench'd with an unlineal hand, No son of mine succeeding. The next lines join the passage with the image pattern of foul air and con- fused thought, and with the sacrament of grace and of damnation: If't be so, For Banquo's issue have I fil'd my mind; For them the gracious Duncan have I murther'd; Put rancours in the vessel of my peace, Only for them; and mine eternal jewel Given to the common Enemy of man, To make them kings, the seed of Banquo kings! The speech ends on the note of hardened defiance: Rather than so, come, fate, into the list, And champion me to th'utterancel The same frustration, but issuing not in defiance but in a weary ebbing of vital power reflected unerringly in the rhythm of the lines, is present in Lady Macbeth's speech at the beginning of the next scene: Nought's had, all's spent, Where our desire is got without content: 'Tis safer to be that which we destroy, Tlan by destruction dwell in doubtful joy. (enter Macbeth) How now, my Lord? why do you keep alone, Of sorriest fancies your companions making, Using those thoughts, which should indeed have died With them they think on, Things without all remedy Should be without regard: what's done is done. What ironic overtones that last remark causes to reverberate: "I'll do, and I'll do, and I'll do"; "If it were done when 'tis done, then 'twere well it were done quickly"; "Had he not resembled my father as he slept, I had done't"; "I have done the deed"-all to be brought to focus in the reply of the Witches to Mac- beth's opening question at their second meeting:</page><page sequence="9">THE SECRET'ST MAN OF BLOOD 405 How now, you secret, black, and midnight hags! What is't you do? when they all answer, A deed without a name. An act of pointless blasphemy, lust, and violence-the crime of Tarquin, of Cain, of Judas, "shadowy, turbulent, and unsanctified", in Coleridge's phase, deliberately kept undefined, below the level of consciousness and of language- -it is symbolized in the final profanation of air, of blood, and of natural increase which completes the Witches' brew: Pour in sow's blood, that hath eaten Her nine farrow; grease, that's sweaten From the murderer's gibbet, throw Into the flame. And on Macbeth's side it is reflected in his great images of destruction whereby all the seeds of life are lost with the spilling of Duncan's blood and the wither- ing of Macbeth's hope of founding a dynasty. The image first appears when Macbeth improvises a speech of forced and extravagant grief: Here lay Duncan, His silver skin lac'd with his golden blood; And his gash'd stabs look'd like a breach in nature For ruin's wasteful entrance. But what was hyperbole then comes to express the settled disposition of his mind later on when he exclaims as he resolves to kill Banquo, "let the frame of things disjoint", and, connecting destruction explicitly with the imagery of seed, in addressing the Witches- though the treasure Of Nature's germens tumble all together, Even till destruction sicken, answer me To what I ask you. The three prophecies follow, and yet, blood-thinker that he is, his "heart throbs to know one thing"-whether Banquo's issue will reign; and when the answer comes, his sole remaining impulse and action from that moment is to destroy for the sake of destruction, until with no hyperbolical or metaphorical intention he says, I 'gin to be aweary of the sun, And wish th'estate o'the'world were now undone. Though by a crowning irony even this desire is frustrated, for, as his wife had concurrently come to realize, "What's done cannot be undone." Macbeth's destructive passion at the end of the play is directed against the innocent, especially against women and children, those who hold the promise of the future; and this fact provides a transition to our final subject of discus- sion. Both blood and seed are connected with another image of comparable importance in the play-with time.</page><page sequence="10">406 ' SHAKESPEARE QUARTERLY The pulse is the clock of the body, and time may move sluggishly or rush feverishly according to its beat. This is, of course, a general truth of experience, but I believe that an interesting study of the rhythm of Macbeth could be made, relating it to the beat of the heart. We may notice this early in the play in that suggestion Whose horrid image doth unfix my hair, And make my seated heart knock at my ribs, Against the use of nature, and later in the line Yet my heart Throbs to know one thing. In both cases the pounding of blood is occasioned by anxious anticipation of the future, by an attempt to leap ahead in time. Lady Macbeth expresses it well when she says on Macbeth's return from battle: Thy letters have transported me beyond This ignorant present, and I feel now The future in the instant. This prepares us for the violence to be done to time itself when she and her husband "catch the nearest way". The conversation continues with the first sounding of the word "tomorrow": Duncan comes here to-night. And when goes hence? To-morrow, as he purposes. And it ends with a deceptive vision of the future, firmly expressed in a mem- orable couplet and for that reason the source of great irony as the action progresses: He that's coming Must be provided for; and you shall put This night's great business into my dispatch; Which shall to all our nights and days to come Give solely sovereign sway and masterdom. When next we see Macbeth, we find him seething with thoughts, and they are thoughts of time: If it were done, when 'tis done, then 'twere well It were done quickly: if th'assassination Could trammel up the consequence, and catch With his surcease success; that but this blow Might be the be-all and the end-all-here, But here, upon this bank and shoal of time, We'd jump the life to come. If the one action in time-the killing of Duncan-could tie up all the conse- quences that would normally follow and (to say the same thing again) seize hold of all succeeding events at the moment of its accomplishment.... What a singularly tortuous and foggy way of stating a condition which put more</page><page sequence="11">THE SECRET'ST MAN OF BLOOD 407 simply would clearly be seen as impossible: if time would stop at the murder of Duncan. The metaphor then changes to the sandbar of time in the ocean of eternity-the same ocean that is to turn to blood in Macbeth's mind at the accomplishment of the murder. The idea of time's having a stop is brought out with renewed ironic force in the speech already twice alluded to: Had I but died an hour before this chance, I had liv'd a blessed time; for, from this instant, There's nothing serious in mortality. We realize, even if Macbeth does not yet realize, that he has, like the farmer of whom the drunken porter speaks, "hang'd himself on the expectation of plenty." Both the temporal possibilities glimpsed in the fog of Macbeth's mind are coming to pass: time does go on, and will finally commend the ingredience of his poisoned chalice to his own lips; time has stopped at the moment of the murder, for Macbeth and his wife have gone through hell gate. What remains is to see them recognize this: "what's done cannot be undone", that, in Mac- beth's words, I have liv'd long enough: my way of life Is fall'n into the sere, the yellow leaf. Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow, Creeps in this petty pace from day to day, To the last syllable of recorded time. But the play is built up not simply on single themes but on contrasts, on polarities of imagery and idea; and the superior knowledge of the audience, the source of the dramatic irony of the kind we are discussing, arises very largely from our noticing the varying worlds of perception (and hence areas of ignor- ance) implied by the poetic language of the leading characters. This has already been apparent in the contrast between the murky air of the Macbeths and the delicate air that Duncan and Banquo breathe; in the contrast between blood as stain and blood as life; in the contrast between the sterility of the Macbeths and the fruitfulness of Banquo. This last contrast carries over into the field we have just been looking at-the use of the idea of time. By the protagonists, time is made the object of an act of violence: an attempt is made to seize the future in the instant by catching a way nearer than the natural process of growth: Macbeth doth murder time. Time is indeed dead for him from that moment; and what he had been deluded and scolded into regarding as an assertion of potency leads at last only to the impotence of tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow. Duncan and Banquo, however, think of time as seed time-as the object of the husbandman's care. Let us again hear the sound of their voice and notice the phrases that they choose as their own: If you can look into the seeds of time, And say which grain will grow, and which will not, Speak then to me, who neither beg, nor fear, Your favours nor your hate.</page><page sequence="12">408 SHAKESPEARE QUARTERLY I have begun to plant thee, and will labour To make thee full of growing. There if I grow, The harvest is your own. No jutty, frieze, Buttress, nor coigne of vantage, but this bird Hath made his pendent bed, and procreant cradle: Where they most breed and haunt, I have observ'd The air is delicate. This note sounds no more as first Duncan and then Banquo are cut down and fall into the ground and die. No more, that is, until the very end of the play when Scotland's Tarquin, the "tyrant bloody sceptred", has been defeated and beheaded. Then Macduff proclaims "the time is free"; and Malcolm, in whom the blood of Duncan flows, in accepting the crown that is his due, restores the time of the fruitful seasons: We shall not spend a large expense of time, Before we reckon with your several loves, And make us even with you. What's more to do, Which should be planted newly with the time,- As calling home our exil'd friends abroad, That fled the snares of watchful tyranny; Producing forth the cruel ministers Of this dead butcher, and his fiend-like Queen, Who, as 'tis thought, by self and violent hands Took off her life;-this, and what needful else That calls upon us, by the grace of Grace, We will perform in measure, time, and place. The time is free, the rightful seed reigns, the innocent blood no longer calls out for vengeance, broad and general is the casing air. University of Saskatchewan</page></plain_text>
