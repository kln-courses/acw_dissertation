<plain_text><page sequence="1">SOCIAL ANALYSIS No. 19, August 1986 THE CHILDREN OF BRONZE AND THE CHILDREN OF GOLD: The Apolitical Anthropology of the Peasant1 Charmaine McEachern and Peter Mayer Since Redford's discovery that peasants form but a part of wider societies, anthropo logists have had to analyze both the nature of the village and the wider world to which it belongs. Michael Taussig's The Devil and Commodity Fetishism and Jacques Chevalier's Civilization and the Stolen Gift are particularly striking for the theoretical understandings of that relationship which inform their respective ethnographies.2 In this review it is our concern to appraise those accounts, but above all those models, from the perspective of south Asia and the 'mode of production' debate which has occurred there over the past decade. The 'Mode of Production' debate and southern Asian Peasants When Karl Marx surveyed the effects of British rule upon India in the 1850s he had no doubt that a vast transformation was afoot. Traditional village India had been sunk in the superstition and stagnation of which the caste system was the most salient aspect (Marx 1872a: 41). British capital, especially in the form of the railways, would "fulfill a double mission in India: one destructive, the other regenerating" (Marx 1872b: 81,85). Indeed, he suggested, this historic labour had already been accomplished: . . . English steam and English free trade . . . dissolved these small semi barbarian, semi-civilized communities, by blowing up their economical basis, and thus produced the greatest, and, to speak the truth, the only social revolution ever heard of in Asia (Marx 1872a: 40). What no twentieth century observer has been able to ignore is the persistence of caste. As the Rudolphs note: Caste, that most pervasive and, for most students of Indian society, Marxian and non-Marxian alike, most retrograde of India's social institutions has not only survived the impact of British imperialism but also transformed and transvalued itself (Rudolph and Rudolph 1967: 23). While the Rudolphs based their explanation for the persistence of caste on its adaptive ability and its reincarnation as a modern, mobilizing social and political institution, writers on the Left since the late 1940s have tended to argue that the rural transformation which Marx foresaw did not in fact occur. The persistence of feudalism or'semi-feudalism' in Indian agriculture has been a matter almost all have taken for granted, including virtually every faction of the Communist party (Mayer 1982). A typical account of the process by which the old forms were preserved is that given by Utsa Patnaik: The Indian case illustrates clearly that the mere penetration of money and exchange into the precapitalist structure and the consequent growth of commerce, fails to dissolve precapitalist forms of organisation. India was colonised by the leading capitalist power of the time and integrated into the world capitalist system: but in a manner which preserved, even intensified precapitalist forms of economic organisation and exploitation on a more monetised basis; with a change in their legal form but little change in content. Indeed, the unique feature of colonial rule was perhaps the grafting on the precapitalist, largely feudal structure, of a juridical system based on concepts of property derived from an economy characterised by capitalist relations of production (1968: 98). In the early 70s the question arose, in the context of the development of the Green Revolution in the Punjab, whether the long expected capitalist transformation was at last occurring. As that debate has been amply reviewed and analysed elsewhere (McEachern 1976; Thorner 1982; many of the contributions are reprinted in Rudra et al. 1978) it must suffice here to observe that the key question which emerged from it was: what criteria serve to identify the dominance of capitalism in agriculture? The initial suggestion that 70</page><page sequence="2">capitalism in agriculture is typified by wage labour, mechanization, high market orientation and high rates of profit per hectare, was quickly contested. In a critical contribution to the debate D. McEachern stressed that the only satisfactory indicator of capitalist relations of production is the existence of generalized commodity production (1976: 450). Those who have followed up his lead by detailed historical investigations of the political economy of south and southeast Asia have taken the existence in commodity form of land, labour and the products of agriculture as evidence of generalized commodity production.3 They have reported the consistent finding that capitalism came to dominate agriculture before the end of the 19th century. Mayer, for example, studied the early impact of colonialism in the Kaveri delta of south India. He argued that the political economy of pre-colonial south India rested on a base of private ownership of land and slaves which were commonly managed collectively by the dominant class in a village. In successive stages, the East India Company created a commodity market for grain, broke up the joint ownership of the village land and freed the untouchable slaves from formal bondage. He concluded that "By 1860 one can no longer speak [of the persistence of the pre-colonial relations of production], save in a historical sense, for [they] no longer existed: what we have, albeit in its infancy, is colonial capitalism" (Mayer 1980: 17). Knight examined the establishment of the Cultivation System in the sugar industry of north Java in the 19th century. In the pre-existing system of production, he argued, land was held by peasants on the condition that they give both labour services and grain to the priyayi aristocracy. When the Cultivation System was introduced in the 1830s, sugar was grown on peasant land and labour was supplied to the sugar plantations by village headmen. By the 1850s land had become a saleable commodity, wage labour was widespread and the food to feed these workers was supplied by a commodity market. Knight concludes by rejecting Geertz' suggestion that the Cultivation System tended to produce an ossifying 'involution'. Rather, the . . potential for development of a capitalist kind existed in rural Java in the opening decades of the nineteenth century, and . . . subsequent developments, far from representing the petrifaction of 'pre capitalist' structures, revealed a pervasive growth of capitalist relations and purposes" (Knight 1982: 147). The finding that the transition to capitalism in southern Asia occurred in the first half century of colonial contact, must inevitably raise questions about accounts such as those which form the subject of this review collection, which suggest that in the societies they studied the transition has either not yet occurred or is only now taking place. These studies also raise questions about historical method. In particular they indicate that generalized commodity production can become predominant in a society without the destruction of pre-colonial social institutions such as the caste system. They thus underscore the dangers inherent in attempts either to infer economic relations from cultural values or to reduce capitalism in agriculture to the highly mechanized form which has dominated the First World for the last half century. Both works under consideration, Jacques Chevalier's Civilization and the Stolen Gift and Michael Taussig's The Devil and Commodity Fetishism in South America are studies of contemporary peasant societies confronting capitalism. They differ sharply in their conceptualization of that relationship and it is no surprise that these differences profoundly structure the interpretations which they make of their ethnographic material. In Taussig's analysis, the small plots owned by peasants on the margins of the great sugar estates of the Cauca Valley of Colombia exist in a peasant mode of production which remains outside of and is resistant to the capitalism which surrounds them. The striking symbol of the conflict engendered by these adjacent and 'articulated' modes is the belief that some workers in the sugar fields sell their souls to the Devil to raise their piece-work output. By contrast, the mestizo peasants of Puerto Inca in Chevalier's account live in a twilight zone of swidden cultivation integrated with the capitalist world on whose periphery they are placed. From the tropical forest in which they plant their subsistence crops, they also cut the timber they sell to the commodity markets down-stream. The Devil and Commodity Fetishism The subjects of Taussig's ethnography are the black peasants of Colombia's Cauca Valley. Theirs has been a violent history. Their ancestors were brought in chains from 71</page><page sequence="3">Africa to work in the mines, at the gold diggings and on the plantations of the Spanish colonists. Escapes and revolts in the late eighteenth century resulted in a substantial group of independent blacks who established farms in the inaccessible wooded tracts of the valley. They grew, among other crops, significant amounts of quality tobacco. In the 1840s slaves on the estates of the valley rose in support of Obando's unsuccessful emancipist rebellion. Though the movement was defeated, the Liberal Party, which came to power in the early 1850s, legally abolished slavery as part of its radical anti-clerical, anti-hacienda and free trade programme. Resecuring control over the peasants formed a continuing concern for the large landowners throughout the latter half of the 19th century, many of whom went bankrupt. The victory of the Conservatives in the war of One Thousand Days in 1902 led to the resurgence of large estates and the expropriation of peasant holdings. Left with uneconomic holdings, the peasants were at last forced to work for wages on the plantations. Central to Taussig's account of the Cauca is the argument that in the 1970s the valley was undergoing a transition to capitalism. The subsistence farms of the peasants existed in a pre-capitalist mode of production which conditioned their social and economic outlook and their reactions to working in the adjacent capitalist mode of production with which it was articulated. For these "neophyte proletarians" the differences between the peasant world which revolved around 'use values' and the capitalist world with its 'exchange values' were deeply antagonistic. What particularly interests Taussig is the form which peasant comprehension of the social reality of capitalism takes (1980a: 10). Ordinarily, he argues, capitalism is comprehended by those who live under it largely in terms of what Marx termed "commodity fetishism". Commodities are understood as animate beings, the human labour which produced them is obscured, and relations between people are expressed as relations between things. But the people of the Cauca Valley, who he believes remain partially unincorporated by capitalism, interpret it in the light of pre-capitalist ideas. This clash of values produces "a moral holocaust . . (ibid: 101), the most striking image of which is to be found in a widely held belief that: . . . male plantation workers sometimes make secret contracts with the devil in order to increase productivity and hence their wage. Furthermore, it is believed that the individual who makes the contract is likely to die prematurely and in great pain. While alive, he is but a puppet in the hands of the devil, and the money obtained from such a contract is barren. It cannot serve as productive capital but has to be spent immediately on what are considered to be luxury consumer items, such as fine clothes,liquor, butter and so on. To invest this money to produce more money— that is, to use it as capital — is to invite ruin. If one buys or rents some land, the land will not produce. If one buys a piglet to fatten for market, the animal will sicken and die . . . Some people say that although the money obtained through the devil contract cannot buy the aforementioned goods, it should be shared with one's friends who are able to use it as ordinary money. The contract is supposed to be made in the deepest secrecy, individually, and with the aid of a sorcerer. A small anthropomorphic figurine, referred to as a muñeco (doll), is prepared, usually from flour, and spells are cast. The male worker then hides the figurine at a strategic point at his place of work. If he is a cane cutter, for example, he places it at the far end of the rows of cane that he has to cut and works his way toward it, often chanting as he cuts his swath. Sometimes, a special prayer is said just before beginning the work. Another aspect of the belief is that the man working with the muñeco does not need to work any harder than the other workers (ibid: 94-95).4 Taussig interprets devil contracts as expressing peasant antagonism to the world of the market: . . the devil is an apt symbol of the pain and havoc that the plantations . . . are causing . . . [T]he devil in the . . . cane fields reflects an adherence by the workers' culture to the principles that underlie the peasant mode of production . . (ibid: 37). That this is so is indicated by the fact that such contracts are not made by peasants working on their own land or while working for other peasants. "It is only when they are proletarianized that the devil assumes such an importance . . (ibid: 13). Indeed, . . it is clear that the devil is intrinsic to the process of proletaria nization of the peasant and to the commoditization of the peasant's world. He signifies a 72</page><page sequence="4">response to the change in the fundamental meaning of society as that meaning registers in precapitalist consciousness." (ibid: 18) Taussig's focus upon the devil is striking, but is his interpetation plausible? We believe it is not. Let us begin with "our ancient foe" himself, as Luther called him. The idea of making pacts with the devil is a very old one, going back at least to the fifth century account by St. Jerome of the life of St. Basil. The eight century story of Theophilus was repeated in innumerable forms and became the foundation of the story of Faust. A common theme of those accounts is the infructuous nature of the devil's gifts. Marlowe's Faustus, for example, asks Mephistophilis for a book wherein he can "beholde al spels and incantations, that I might raise vp spirits when I please." When he has it, Faustus reads with growing dismay, for it has, in Levin's phrase "little more than the quiddities of Wittenburg . . (Levin 1952: 111). He groans to himself, "O thou art deceived". As Russell remarks of these medieval and renaissance pacts, "The favors obtained in return for the promise of one's soul are usually illusory: a scholar signs a pact in return for gold, which turns into stone; elegant feasts become offal and excrement; beautiful maidens turn into shrieking hags." (1984: 82) It is clear that the pacts alleged to be made in the Cauca Valley are part of a very old tradition of European Christianity. Given a history of such pacts with the devil spanning a millennium and a half, it is impossible to accept Taussig's argument that they are 'intrinsic to the process of proletarianization of the peasant' (ibid: 18). To construct a more plausible interpretation, it is necessary to consider critically Taussig's approach to the analysis of modes of production. We have seen that the south Asian debate rapidly came to a sharp focus on the features which distinguish the capitalist mode of production. Taussig never confronts this central question, but instead takes it for granted that capitalism can be inferred from the existence of "commodity fetishism" or the production of exchange values. It is symptomatic of the looseness of his analysis that he is never able to resolve what the two spheres of social and economic activity he is studying are. They are — variously — social formations (ibid: 67), articulated modes of production (ibid: 88), modes which just co-exist (ibid: 91) or most generally of all, sectors (ibid: 91). At different times what differentiates them is production for "use value" compared with "exchange value" (ibid: 114, 135), at others, precapitalist fetishism (things actually contain something of the person who made them) (ibid: 124). When the "peasant mode of production" is subsequently reclassified as a "householding mode of production", implying a different basis for it (ibid: 118), it becomes female in orientation (ibid: 118,119). The final result is a chimerical social form in which a female oriented peasant (or household) mode of production, characterised by production for use value, pre-capitalist commodity fetishism, reciprocity and mutuality, simultaneously articulates with and stands in opposition to, a male sphere of capitalism, the production of exchange values, and the dominance of commodities. There would also be commodity fetishism were it not resisted by the people. Even if, like the White Queen in Through the Looking Glass, one tried to believe six impossible things before breakfast, this would try one. Perhaps it is sufficient to refer, on the one hand, to the work of those like Ennew, Hirst and Tribe (1977) and Friedmann (1980) who have shown there can be no distinct peasant economy, and on the other those including Foster-Carter (1978) and McEachern (1982) who have demonstrated the inherent untenability of notions of articulation. This carelessness in the use of categories relating to the mode of production is reflected in a similar imprecision in Taussig's analysis of the development of the political economy of the Cauca Valley. As we have already seen, Taussig traces the evolution of the peasants of the Cauca Valley from slaves working on haciendas to free labourers who participated in the civil wars of the late 19th century. He notes also the emergence of militant trade unionism in the 1930s and the violent history of post-World War II Colombia after the assassination of Gaitán in 1948. Despite this century of turmoil, like the early contributors to the mode of production debate in India, he finds that relatively little change has occurred in the mode of production in which peasant life is led. As in the case of the Indian literature, one is compelled to ask whether this interpretation can be sustained by the facts. It is beyond the scope of this review to attempt a characterization of the pre-conquest 73</page><page sequence="5">mode of production in Colombia, or even that which was imposed under the Viceroyalty of New Granada. There is, for example, the question of the status of property in the colony. Parks notes, for example, that "the colony had always been the personal hacienda of the king . . (1970: 58). What seems clear is that slave holding haciendas, producing commodities such as tobacco which were sold to state monopolies, were central to the process of production. From the 1840s onward, exports such as tobacco and later coffee came to occupy an increasingly prominent place in the Colombian economy. Bergquist suggests that the principal base of support for the Liberals came from those engaged in exports (1978: 7). It is evident that by this period land was freely saleable and mortgageable, that labour had been freed from the bonds of slavery, that capital moved with reasonable flexibility within the country and that the production of commodities was taking place on an increasing scale (Palacios 1980: 3). In short, it seems to us inescapable that by the middle of the nineteenth century generalized commodity production was in existence in Colombia. Palacios comes to the same conclusion: . . . the very ability of the internal productive structure to respond to the demands and fluctuations of the external market was a clear indication of the capitalist development which was getting under way. After all, in the thirty years after 1847 there were three distinctive shifts in investment, first to tobacco, then to indigo and quinine, and finally to coffee, each of which demanded the mobilization of capital and the organization of land and labour on a scale which was by no means inconsiderable for a country whose economic resources were modest even by Latin American standards (ibid: 13). If the line of analysis which we are advancing here is correct, then Taussig's explanation of the devil contract as a reflection of the impact of capitalism upon neophyte proletarians is untenable, for the transformation had occurred a century earlier. In that case what are we to make of the contract? The clue lies, we suggest, in Taussig's observation that: belief [in the devil contract] permeates daily activity in a variety of forms. Plantation workers may chide a gang member who outpaces the rest, saying, "What a way you have come with the 'muñecos today!" (1980: 95). Cane cutting is sub-contracted on a piece rate basis and, as Taussig notes, this system "allows the employer far more opportunity to wear down the daily wage, to intensify labor, and to heighten the individualism and competition among workers" (ibid: 84). This is a universal effect of payment on a piece work basis under capitalism, especially where, as in Colombia, trade unionism has been destroyed. As Hobsbawm notes, it was common for nineteenth century capitalists to sub-contract piece-work out to piece-masters, foremen and gangers who set a high piece work rate (1964: 352-3). Many students have noted that attempts to control the process of production, whether it be the speed of the line or the piece-rate "darg" or norm, are an integral part of the class struggle (e.g. Beynon, 1973: esp. Ch. 6). And it has been a commonplace of industrial sociology since the Hawthorne study of Roethlisburger and Dixon (1943: esp. Ch. 22) that piece rate workers utilize such informal sanctions to deter 'rate busting'.5 In our opinion, the accusation that a 'rate busting' co-worker has made a contract with the devil must be seen as just such an informal sanction. So too must the corollary belief that any above average earnings can only safely be spent on luxuries or one's co-workers. The existence of a belief in the devil clearly provides a weapon for the proletariat in their struggle against capital in Colombia, but this is hardly surprising for, as Foster showed in Oldham, working class culture often draws on earlier beliefs and social structures (Foster 1974:22-43). Resistance in the Cauca Valley does not occur only at the cultural level. The kidnapping of estate owners and the sabotage of machinery and equipment in the mills and fields of the Cauca Valley (Taussig 1980a: 89) are clear indications that struggle in the Cauca Valley is not a rear-guard action which takes the form of resistance to commodity fetishism on the part of peasants who inhabit a decaying pre-capitalist island surrounded by an encroaching capitalist sea but one waged by a working class actively confronting capital. Civilization and the Stolen Gift Chevalier's account of Puerto Inca stands as an exemplary contrast to Taussig's. The Pachitea Valley in which Puerto Inca is situated is comparable in many ways to the Cauca Valley. The village was founded in the 1920s by Spanish-speaking mestizo peasants whose 74</page><page sequence="6">livelihood was derived principally from swidden agriculture and commercial lumbering. Surrounded by sparsely settled rain foresst and with no large commercial plantations, the valley is less developed than the Cauca Valley. It presents an apparent paradox which Chevalier confronts directly: On the one hand, merchant and industrial capital has made significant advances in the recent evolution of the Pachitean economy and has succeeded in altering some of the traditional forms of property ownership and exchange, in accordance with its own logic. On the other hand, observed relations of agricultural production point towards the dispersal of simple means of production and a significant lack of interdependence between the domestic units from the point of view of economic production and exchange (1982: 106). Though his prose is often as impenetrable as the rain forest itself, the virtue of Chevalier's account of the political economy of the valley is that it does probe beneath surface appearances. In doing this Chevalier avoids many of the traps into which Taussig has fallen. Central to Chevalier's analysis (as to Taussig's) is the problem of how to characterise peasant agriculture. The problem is further complicated in the Pachitea Valley by the abundance of land on which swidden cultivation rests, and the reliance of peasants upon hunting, fishing and gathering for supplementary subsistence. One might well think that such an economy with its reliance upon family labour is characteristic of a self-sufficient pre-capitalist economy, at best loosely articulated with the capitalist world outside. Chevalier does not (ibid: 105). He rightly perceives that the existence of a capitalist market economy utterly transforms these activities. Explicitly, or often only implicitly, the value of activities in the forest is measured against the income that could be earned by engaging in paid labour: In quantitative terms, the agricultural (or industrial) labour output of one man is valued at fifty soles a day. Every farmer is thus quite aware that the average work he does on his farm in one day is worth the latter amount in the sense that the same work could be, or could have been, performed by a peon in exchange for the sum of fifty soles. Agricultural work has a definite worth in that it is exchangeable; whether it is exchanged or not is another matter (ibid: 121-2). This same argument applies to the apparently free land and food of the forest: Those who settle in the selve [the eastern Amazonian zone of Peru] value the rain-forest land not because of its scarcity, but rather because of its relative abundance. Correspondingly, the worth of the land they occupy is realized not through an act of spending or purchase, but rather through an act of saving: its worth corresponds to a determinate reduction in the cost of appropriating the necessary factors of agricultural production. In short, land has this in common with all those 'subsistence commodities' that are directly consumed by the producers: the realization of the magnitude of the value it possesses as a commodity is conditional upon its exclusion from the domain of market exchanges. The direct and unobstructed consumption of a significant portion of the food produce by the swidden household permits the realization of measurable savings in the family budget; so does the direct appropriation of land in a regional context of low population density and plentiful forest land (ibid: 120). The importance of this observation is hard to overstate. By recognizing that the part has meaning only in terms of the interpretation of the whole, he is able to comprehend what superficially appear to be pre-capitalist labour processes in terms of the logic of that relationship. Integration into the wider market economy means that in the Pachitea Valley even swidden agriculture must be understood through the logic of capitalism. As we have seen, connection with the wider market results in the commoditisation of the factors of production, especially land and labour. Chevalier argues that once labour is used to produce exchange values as it is in Puerto Inca, merchants are purchasing labour by buying the products of the swidden agriculturalists. Thus it is through capitalism, and not some pre-capitalist mode, that the swidden agriculture of Puerto Inca must be understood (ibid: 167). It follows that the many notions of dual or articulated economies are irrelevant: This alternative approach to self-employed work in capitalist economies is 75</page><page sequence="7">hardly compatible with general characterizations of household production — especially in agriculture — as an abstractly recognizable 'mode of production,' or an economic type endowed with its own logic. As argued by Friedman (1979) and Ennew et al. (1977), universally defined notions of 'domestic'; or 'peasant' economy are based on the misleading assumption that household production can be theorized without reference to the specific features of wider economic structures (ibid: 175-6). Like those who have studied southern Asia, but unlike Taussig, Chevalier has understood that capitalism in agriculture assumes diverse forms. For Chevalier many of the peculiarities of the Puerto Incan economic situation arise from the underdeveloped, constricted nature of capitalism in the valley (ibid: 9, 124). Labour processes have undergone little technological improvement, and labour itself is undervalued. Both merchants and industrial capitalists (usually the same few people; ibid: 141) find it difficult to expand their economic base (ibid: 168); their profits come principally from the overvaluationof consumption goods which are sold to the farmers and industrial labourers (ibid: 148, 151). There are both disadvantages and benefits which accrue to the peasants from living on the periphery of the wider capitalist market. Through their reliance on subsistence crops, farmers subsidise the capitalists and thus aid capital accumulation (ibid: 168).6 At the same time, the direct appropriation of land and subsistence production limit the level of exploitation to which farmers are subjected and thus form the basis of their resistance to capitalism (ibid: 150). Anthropology and the Repressive State During the 1970s and 80s horrific forces of state repression were unleashed against the peasants, workers and intellectuals of Latin America. While the victims of the death squads of Guatemala, those tortured by the Centrál Nacional de Informaciones of Pinochet's Chile or the detenid.os-d.esaparacid.os of Argentina are particularly notorious, they nevertheless have their counterparts in the rest of the continent. In 1975, for example, Amnesty International wrote to Colombian President Alfonso Lopez Michelsen "asking for an investigation into the alleged torture and murder of peasant leaders in Cauca province, reportedly by armed forces in conjunction with vigilante groups" (Amnesty International 1974/75: 69). In 1977 the organization noted that small farmers of the Cauca were being persecuted by wealthy landowners (Amnesty International 1977: 134). A 1980 mission to Colombia reported that since 1973, 48 peasant leaders in the Cauca Valley had been murdered. It also identified 33 centres of torture in Colombian military installations; one of these was in the Valle del Cauca (Amnesty International 1980: 123). Amnesty has also reported on the regular use of torture by the Peruvian Guardia Civil and the Policía de Investigaciones del Peru (PIP). Their victims have been peasants, workers, teachers and students. "Torture by these forces has reportedly been carried out most frequently in isolated rural areas" (Amnesty International 1984: 172). Although Taussig and Chevalier have, with varying degrees of success and sophistication, placed their studies of peasant communities in the context of the wider economic forces which act upon them, their neglect of politics seems almost wilful. Thus Taussig, though he notes the turbulent history of party conflict in Colombia and the violencia of the past thirty years, fails to integrate those forces with his dicussion of the "peasant mode of production". The repressive arms of the state in the form of the army and the police have clearly played a decisive role in the Cauca Valley from at least the time of the Conservative victory in the War of 1000 days. And as we have seen, the presence of the army in support of the class of capital in the valley is unmistakeable but like the state itself it hardly finds a place in Taussig's analysis. Similar remarks apply to Chevalier's study. Though Puerto Inca "was founded in the twenties as a politically launched frontier colony initially baptized under the name of Puerto Leguia, in honour of the contemporary president of Peru" (Chevalier 1982: 5) it is presented to us as a society now linked with the wider world only by economics, in which politics are virtually absent, and for which changes in the role of the state since the late 19th century are apparently not deemed to be important. One cannot survey the history of Latin America in the 1970s and 80s without seeing the organized terror and violence, torture and disappearances unleashed by the state 76</page><page sequence="8">against the peasantry. While scholars disagree about the causes of the widespread repression, there is no doubt that it is a world-wide phenomenon. There is hardly a country in the world, above all in the Third World, where the presence of the state apparatus in the country is not marked by the use of torture and killing to suppress deep-set social forces which threaten established élites. Just as anthropologists of an earlier period tended to be oblivious to the actions of the colonial state in the societies they studied, so much of contemporary anthropology has still to come to grips with the realities of politics and state power. The adoption of Marxian categories has added enormously to the sophistication with which the economic environment of village life is understood but its equally powerful tools for understanding the state have yet to be assimilated.
