<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Lady and the Temple The Critical Theories of Katherine Anne Porter LODWICK HARTLEY1 IN SPITE of the fact that at least one of her books has been reissued in a popular edition and that many of her short stories have appeared in anthologies, Katherine Anne Porter remains chiefly a writer's writer. Such a circumstance is a pity, for in her short stories and novelle she has a great deal to say to all intelligent readers; and she says it with clarity and beauty. She is by no means difficult to read; and, though her overzealous critics have made a few of her short stories seem over- wrought with symbolism, there is ac- tually little of the occult in her work. She has always lacked patience with the lit- erary faddists-those people who affect newness of manner when they are ac- tually destitute of matter. She writes in the main stream of English prose style and of English fiction without being imi- tative: a great achievement in itself. Her difficulty is an ironic one, though it in- volves no irony peculiar to her own time. In brief, she is a perfectionist, and perfec- tionists have rarely enjoyed popular suc- cess in any age. Furthermore, in the pur- suit of her ideal she has evolved a theory of art that might reasonably be expected to limit her range. Even among the lit- erary highbrows she has not entirely escaped ridicule for preciosity, as a few delicately pointed barbs in Mary Mc- Carthy's The Groves of Academe will at- test. North Carolina State College. The Days Before, a recent collection of Miss Porter's essays and fugitive pieces written over a period of some thirty years, provides an illuminating index to the excellencies of her criticism and her art, as well as an index to some of her limitations. Though the book contains a great deal of material on other subjects- for example, a long and beautiful essay on the rose as an actuality and as a sym- bol, a warmly vivid description of the Audubon country, colorful and sensitive commentaries on the author's several pe- riods of residence in Mexico, an evoca- tion of the "Old South" through a sketch of her fabulous grandmother-the collec- tion as a whole is really concerned with writing, the one subject to which Miss Porter has devoted the greatest part of her life and thought. And she manages to reveal her own philosophy of art most penetratingly by discussing the achieve- ment of Henry James, Thomas Hardy, Katherine Mansfield, Willa Cather, Vir- ginia Woolf, Edith Sitwell, Ezra Pound, Gertrude Stein, E. M. Forster, D. H. Lawrence, and Eudora Welty. Throughout her critical essays Miss Porter writes with such precision, com- pactness, and fine fluency that no percep- tive reader can fail to be charmed by what she has to say. Whether everyone will want to accept her rigidly pure con- cept of the art of writing is another mat- ter. Certainly, it will be easy to conclude that art is the nearest thing to a be-all 386</page><page sequence="2">THE LADY AND THE TEMPLE and end-all in her existence. The bases of her position she has clearly marked out- so clearly, in fact, that the whole position may seem to approach rationalization. In short, one may be led to feel that her own peculiar experience has developed in her such a profound distrust of institu- tional religion and of human relation- ships that she has felt compelled to seek certainties elsewhere and that, conse- quently, her theory of art, beautiful and praiseworthy though it is, arises out of a peculiar personal necessity rather than out of a completely universal one. From her days in convent schools (where, she once said with delightful candor, she was "precocious, nervous, re- bellious, and unteachable") she has re- acted against authoritarianism and to- talitarianism in any form--in govern- ment, morals, religion-including the faith of her youthful training and either the Southern brand of conservatism of her social milieu or the survival of Puritan- ism that still determines the American moral climate. Religion itself she, of course, does not reject. "The idea of God" she acknowledges to be "the most splendid single act of the creative human imagination"; and she agrees with E. M. Forster (himself hardly a champion of orthodoxy) that "there are only two pos- sibilities for any real order: art and re- ligion." (The order is significant.) But, although she plainly makes a distinction intellectually, she is rarely capable emo- tionally of detaching religion from its in- stitutions, the history of which she thinks of as being "calamitous." The mystical concept of God, she contends warmly, has been harnessed rudely to machinery of the most mundane sort, and has been made to serve the ends of an organization which, ruling under divine guidance, has ruled very little better, and in some respects, worse, than certain rather mediocre but frankly man-made systems of government. And it has often lent its support to the worst evils in secular government, fight- ing consistently on the side of the heavy artillery. The social results of institutional re- ligion, Miss Porter further suggests, have been equally calamitous. "Of all evil emotions generated in the snake-pit of human nature," she writes apropos of the Bishop of Wakefield's unfortunate attack on Thomas Hardy, "theological hatred is perhaps the most savage." And she praises the elder James for inculcating in his children not Puritan notions of re- ligion and morality but "a horror of prig- gishness and conscious virtue" and for guarding them "from that vulgarity he described as 'flagrant morality.'" The deleterious effects of religion are to be found not only in morality but also in criticism and in the arts. T. S. Eliot's en- thusiastic conversion to Anglo-Catholi- cism becomes a case in point. Having turned "preacher," Mr. Eliot's "great gifts as a critic ... do not flow with their old splendor and depth," Miss Porter asserts. In the field of religion Miss Porter's admiration is, therefore, quite logically only for the "great tradition of dissent," which "will remain, persistent, obdurate, a kind of church in itself, with its leaders, teachers, saints, martyrs, heroes; a thorn in the flesh of orthodoxy." But, from this point of view, dissent seems admirable largely for its nuisance value rather than for its contribution to spiritual growth. If religion as she finds it offers Miss Porter no essential and permanent satis- faction, neither do human relationships. I do not mean to suggest that she is a misanthropist in the usual sense of the term. As an artist she finds human life to be full of interest: I have never known an uninteresting human being, and I have never known two alike.... I am passionately involved with these individuals 387</page><page sequence="3">COLLEGE ENGLISH who populate all these enormous migrations, calamities; who fight wars and furnish life for the future; these beings without which, one by one, all the "broad movements of history" could never take place. One by one-as they were born. However, she is acutely conscious of the isolation of the individual, the "locked-in ego." Everywhere she sees the "loveless- ness in which most people live." She im- plies agreement with Willa Cather's con- clusion that "human relationships are the tragic necessity of life .. .never ... wholly satisfactory"; and she even con- cludes that as friends cats might prove more valuable than the common two- legged creature without feathers. "I leave cats to the last," Miss Porter wrote recently in the New York Herald-Tribune Books. "I love them above all animals, and my friendship with them has been the most charming, constant thing, all my life." The statement is, of course, humorous; but its serious aspect is un- deniable. From disillusionment of this kind the artist can take refuge only in the temple of art itself. Hardy, Miss Porter points out, had "the mathematical certainty of music and architecture." And Henry James, who plainly furnishes an ideal for her, sought for truth "not in philosophy nor in religion, but in art, and found his own." And then there was Willa Cather, who held that "knowledge of great art and great thought was a good in itself not to be missed for anything." Moreover, as the record shows, when Miss Porter's own world seemed so definitely to be dis- integrating with the fall of France in 1940, the author herself could find hope for permanence in art alone. But even the search for truth in the arts, as Miss Porter sees it, hardly promises an apoc- alyptic vision. The "triumph" of that "born artist," Virginia Woolf, is simply that, beyond her love for all the arts, she "had no plan whatever for her personal salvation; or the salvation of someone else; brought no doctrine; no dogma"; and she concluded merely that life is a "great mystery." Miss Porter's pervading dislike of dogma and authoritarianism effectually prevents her acceptance of anything like neoclassical ideals in literature. Yet it leads her neither into a form of nine- teenth-century Romanticism nor into sympathy with any of the various "revo- lutionary" schools of literature that have flourished so profusely in the twentieth century. The plain fact is that she wishes to be a classicist in the Greek tradition both in her practice and in her theory; and what she admires in the liter- ary work of her contemporaries often sounds remarkably like what an enthu- siastic scholar like Edith Hamilton ad- mires in the literature of the Age of Pericles. For the floodtide of experimentalism that came in the twenties, Miss Porter has patent contempt. "Every day in the arts," she writes, "as in schemes of gov- ernment and organized crime, there was, there had to be something new," a prin- ciple that operated in crass failure to rec- ognize that in reality there is nothing new except that which conforms to the true classical ideal of being "outside of time and beyond the reach of change." The false ideals of "The Lost Genera- tion" Miss Porter sees as being epito- mized in the "hoarse, anxious, corrupted mysticism" of the magazine transition and in the colossal illogic of Gertrude Stein. Miss Stein's judgments, writes Miss Porter, were neither moral nor intellectual, and least of all aesthetic, indeed they were not even judgments, but simply her description from observation of acts, words, appearances giving 388</page><page sequence="4">THE LADY AND THE TEMPLE her view; limited, personal in the extreme, prejudiced without qualification, based on as- sumptions founded in the void of pure reason. For the serious young men who had found writing difficult (the critic con- tinues) the idea of automatic writing was a comfortable delusion. Ultimately, of course, these same young men who tried at first to write as if they had never read a book discovered that they had to read books before they could write. Naturally, it would be erroneous to feel that Miss Porter's fundamental quarrel has been with the spirit of experi- mentalism itself. Rather is it, indeed, with what she considers to be the super- ficiality and unreason of most innovators and with the use of "tricky techniques and disordered syntax" to disguise "pov- erty of feeling and idea." For the innova- tions of an artist like Edith Sitwell the matter is quite different. In Miss Sit- well's early work, for example, Miss Porter finds a "challenging note of natu- ral arrogance" that is completely ad- mirable, because it was "boldly experi- mental" and "inventive from a sense of adventure" rather than from a paucity of ideas. But even in Miss Sitwell it is rather a classical quality than her experimental- ism qua experimentalism that Miss Por- ter genuinely admires. "A primrose by the river's brim was always a simple prim- rose and nothing more," writes Edith Hamilton of the Greek poets. "Birds were birds and nothing else, but how beautiful a thing was a bird." Of Miss Sitwell, Katherine Anne Porter is moved to write in a similar vein: "Rain is rain in these poems, it rains on the page and you can smell and feel it." Indeed, it is this classical quality of "realism" that Miss Porter seeks in both poetry and prose and that provides reason for her praise of the "objectivity" of Henry James or Willa Cather or Katherine Mansfield or Eu- dora Welty. It is always the concrete de- tail and the exact statement that mat- ters. In this regard, Miss Porter writes of Katherine Mansfield: "She was mag- nificent in her objective view of things, her real sensitiveness to climate, mental or physical, her genuinely first-rate equipment in the matter of the five senses." In the whole matter of style, then, it is not surprising to find Miss Porter writing of an artist like Willa Cather in almost the same language in which Edith Ham- ilton writes of Euripides. "It is plain writing, direct, matter-of-fact," Miss Hamilton remarks of the great dramatist in The Greek Way. "The words [are] so literal, so grave, so unemphatic [that they] hardly assist our attention to see the beauty in them." Miss Porter main- tains the same necessity for the union of content and style. "The style should never attract the attention from what the writer is saying," she comments concerning Willa Cather's work; and it is Miss Cather's "fine pure direct prose . [and her] well-tempered voice saying very good, sensible things with complete authority" that give her su- periority over most of her contemporar- ies. Though Miss Porter's complete con- ception of the artist is not exactly vatic, it is a lofty one, indeed. She sees, first of all, the necessity of "that indispensable faculty of aspiration of the human mind called, in morals and the arts, nobility." The true artist will, like Flaubert, have "astronomical standards" and will be unyielding to the death in his literary principles, even though he may be in dan- ger, as Miss Porter honestly admits, of developing "a coldness of heart." If the artist is "a lover of the sublime and a seeker after perfection," he may be, like 389</page><page sequence="5">COLLEGE ENGLISH Ezra Pound, a true poet, no matter how badly informed he is. His chief natural virtue must be sensitivity: the capability of "soaking in impressions at every pore." ("The whole scene of his child- hood existed in his memory in terms of the lives lived in it," Miss Porter remarks of Henry James, "with his own growing mind working at it, storing it, transmut- ing it, reclaiming it.") The artist's chief acquired virtue must be objectivity, which is the ability to see life with "clear- ness, warmth of feeling, calmness of in- telligence, and ample human view of things" (an idea not unlike Matthew Arnold's pronouncement on Sophocles) or the ability to achieve such an aloof- ness from life that allows him to "bare a moment of experience" without the ne- cessity of stating beliefs, theories, mo- tives (an idea that suggests Keats's com- ment on the "negative capability" of Shakespeare). Art will set the artist apart from the conventional relationships and criteria: "Greatness in art is like any other great- ness in religious experience, in love, it is great because it is beyond the reach of the ordinary, and cannot be judged by the ordinary, nor be accountable to it." Therefore, there is a necessity that the work of art and the personality of the artist should be kept distinct by the critic. "I have not much interest in any- one's personal history after the tenth year," Miss Porter asserts, "not even my own." In another place she insists: "Katherine Mansfield's work is the most important thing about her, and she is in danger of the worst fate that the artist can suffer-to be overwhelmed by her own legend, to have her work neglected for her 'personality.'" And with the same logic Miss Porter decries the "hys- terical nonsense" that has been written about Rilke and D. H. Lawrence. Whatever "separateness" Miss Porter may claim for the artist, she cannot very well deny his social responsibility as a person. Thus she writes: "The responsi- bility of the artist toward society is the plain and simple responsibility of any other human being, for I refuse to sepa- rate the artist from the human race." But arguing on the premise that edifica- tion is the highest form neither of the in- tellectual nor of the religious experience, she allows to art no propagandist func- tion. On this matter her opinion finds clear and sharp statement: There exist documents of political and social theory which belong, if not to poetry, certainly to the department of humane letters. They are reassuring statements of the great hopes and dearest faiths of mankind and they are acts of high imagination. But all working, practical political systems, even those professing to originate in moral grandeur, are based upon and operate by contempt of human life and the individual fate; in accepting any one of them and shaping his mind and work to that mold, the artist dehumanizes himself, unfits himself for the practice of any art. And thus the concept of the functions and limitations of the artist is rounded out. Miss Porter's serene consistency in her philosophy and her tolerance of nothing less than the highest standards of per- formance for herself as well as for others deserve the highest admiration. It is true, however, that, beneath the almost per- fect poise of her manner, her rigid purism and her championship of art as effectu- ally comprehending both morality and religion may at times seem less like a con- fession of faith than an act of despera- tion. Moreover, like the brave generaliza- tion about truth and beauty made by Keats in the presence of physical disin- tegration, her solution has never been a universally satisfactory one. Though this philosophy, however explicitly stated in 390</page><page sequence="6">THE LADY AND THE TEMPLE the critical essays, may appear only im- plicitly in Miss Porter's fiction, its limita- tion curiously suggests a possible restric- tion of her total appeal. "All the con- scious and recollected years of my life," she writes in the 1940 Preface to Flower- ing Judas, "have been lived to this day under the heavy threat of world catas- trophe, and most of the energies of my mind and spirit have been spent in the effort to grasp the meaning of these threats, to trace them to their sources and to understand the logic of this ma- jestic and terrible failure of life in the Western World." But these efforts to un- derstand the failure of life in the Western world, however important they may be in her heart and mind, could hardly be said to be the major subject of her art. Indeed, her writing--imaginative and critical-seems more nearly an attempt to escape from the central problem. Per- haps the reason that her work, for all its beauty, does not etch itself indelibly on our consciousness is that it ultimately does not illuminate the supreme tragedy of which she speaks. Thus, whatever may be the acuity, the vitality, and even the nicely calculated violence of some of her stories, and whatever may be the strength of her utterance in other fields, she may continue to be regarded essentially as a lovely, white-robed priestess of the shrine of Apollo-a role that she seems deliber- ately and expertly to have written for herself. Of Gods and Men in the "Iliad" WALLACE L. ANDERSON1 THE introduction of general education programs in many colleges has given large numbers of students their first taste of classical literature. For many students this experience is disappointing and frustrating; it is neither meaningful nor pleasurable. Homer's Iliad is a case in point. The difficulty is not primarily one of translation, for, even if the poem were to be read in the original, the funda- mental problem would remain. The prob- lem is one of belief. The gods and their relations with men play a basic part in the Iliad from the beginning to the end. In the Invocation Homer calls upon the Muse to sing of the wrath of Achilles and the destruction it brought in fulfilment of the will of Zeus. At the very begin- Iowa State Teachers College. Co-author with Norman C. Stageberg of Poetry as Experience (Amer- ican Book Co., 1952). ning, then, Zeus is mentioned, and his part and that of the rest of the gods is anticipated. It is this mythological world of gods that is incredible to the moder reader, and yet this is precisely what must, in some sense, be believed if the Iliad is to be read with understanding and pleasure. To recapture the original belief of the ancient Greeks is impossible. Yet it is possible to understand the na- ture and function of the gods as Homer uses them artistically in the poem. And once the Iliad becomes artistically credi- ble, it also becomes an experience which is both intellectually and aesthetically satisfying. The most obvious feature of Homer's gods is that they are anthropomorphic. They are "human" to a large degree: Thetis weeps when she sees Achilles sor- rowing; Zeus laughs as he watches the 391</page></plain_text>
