Pflug University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute Mark Haffner U.S. Dept. of Transportation National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ABSTRACT This paper describes the methodology and results from a project involving development of anthropometr i ca I I y based design specifications for a family of advanced adult anthropomorphic dummies. Selection of family members and anthropometric criteria for subject sample selection were based on expected applications of the devices and on an analysis of U.S. popula- tion survey data. This resulted in collection of data for dummy sizes including a small female, a mid-sized male, and a large male. The three phases of data collection in- cluded: 1. in-vehicle measurements to determine seat track position and seating posture preferred by the subjects for use in development of laboratory seat bucks; 2. measurement of subject/seat interface contours for fabrication of an average hard seat surface for use in the buck; and 3* measurement of standard anthropometry, seated anthropometry (in the buck), and three-dimensional surface landmark coordinates using standard and photogrammetr i c techn i ques . Following data collection, activity was concentrated on data analysis and development of specifications. Data for each subject group were averaged for use in development of two reference resources. One is an epoxy/f i berg 1 ass standard reference shell positioned in the average hard seat. The other is an anthropometric specification package consisting of full-size drawings detailing estimates of body linkage, mass, and segmentation data. Final results are presented for the mid-sized male population group. IN RECOGNITION OF THE CONTINUING NEED for detailed and scientifically based data defining both the skeletal and surface geometry of vehicle seated occupants, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration initiated a program of research in 1 98O designed to obtain this information. The product of this research effort was expected to have broad utility as a source of basic anthropometric data, as a resource for vehicle workspace development specialists, and most significantly, as a source of essential data for the development of a new family of advanced anthropomorphic test dummies planned by the NHTSA. The prospectus for the current program of research was developed based upon a review of related efforts extending back to I968. !n that year, the SAE Crash Test Dummy Task Force of the Human Factors Engineering Subcommittee proceeded to create master anthropomorphic surface forms in erect seated posture, based in large part on anthropometric data provided to the SAE by Hertzberg and White derived from military populations. The "golden shells" arising from this effort, although incorporating the best available data for erect-seated individuals, were not wholly applicable to the design of test dummies intended for vehicle seated application. In 1970, Stoudt et al. (1)* began the acquisi- tion of needed vehicle based data. They ob- tained 22 body measurements from a large (N= 1033) sample of adult subjects seated in automotive driving posture in a two-dimensional hard seat. In 197*+» Robbins and Reynolds (2), in a study of literature potentially applicable to vehicle occupant anthropometry and mobility, found the available data to be of limited utility, and recommended an extensive program of further research. Hubbard (3) (1975)» in developing anthropometric guidelines for the General Motors ATD 502 dummy, utilized the erect seated data assembled by the SAE, as well as subsequent data. In 1975, Nyquist and Patrick (4), recognizing the continuing lack of detailed data defining the skeletal configuration of the vehicle seated occupant, obtained lateral X-rays of two volunteers in automobile seat mockups and reported their pelvic and lumbar spine geometry. In 1977» Foster et al. (5) reported the develop- ment of the General Motors Hybrid III dummy, "Numbers in parentheses designate references at end of paper . 4.486 0096-736X/84/9204-0486$02.50 Copyright 1984 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.</page><page sequence="2">which incorporated a relaxed seated posture derived from the previous work of Hubbard (3)« In the present research program, the NHTSA has sought to build upon the limited available data and to address many of the significant gaps in knowledge which have been repeatedly iden- tified by previous investigators. The several tasks in the project include the following ac- tivities : Acquisition of human volunteer data describ- ing automotive vehicle occupant seated pos- ture and body surface geometry. -- Synthesis of a data base for dummy design specifications using existing anthropometric and mob i 1 i ty data . Fabrication of reference standard surface form and seat assembly for each dummy family member . The remainder of this paper presents the methodology used for the three members of the dummy family and the results obtained for the mid-sized male surface form and specification package. VEHICLE SELECTION Criteria used to select appropriate vehicles for assessing vehicle-seated posture were based on consideration of four factors: - Bench and bucket seat configurations A range of seat stiffness Vehicles manufactured inside and outside the U.S. Vehicle types representing a projected 1985-1999 fleet To sort out the great variety of vehicle types, the selection process was begun by adopting the vehicle classification scheme of the EPA. Be- cause of a general trend toward down-sizing, the "large" category was eliminated from considera- tion. A group of four vehicles was thereby chosen that bracketed a wide range of seating con- figurations. The four I98I vehicles selected were: Plymouth Champ hatchback Ford Escort 3"door hatchback Chevrolet Citation A-door hatchback Chevrolet Malibu A-door sedan These vehicles fall into the sub-compact and mid-size categories. Table 1 is a comparison of the four vehicles with respect to front seat volume, rear seat volume, cargo area volume, and total volume based upon the EPA classification scheme. The important parameter for vehicle selection was front seat volume, which shows a relatively even progression from small to larger size vehicles (i.e., Plymouth Champ - Ford Escort - Citation - Ma 1 i bu) . The computation of front seat volume is based on head room, leg room, hip room, and shoulder room. As a result, discussions shifted to the presence of advanced designs in the current marketplace that were likely to have "staying power." The Plymouth Champ was an advanced design subcompact in its class. The Ford Escort represents a major attempt to provide a small, compact class of vehicles that may be expected to remain in production through this decade. The Chevrolet Malibu represents a traditional six passenger vehicle. Most experts feel that cars in this size class will be around for the foreseeable future but others argue that the three passenger front seat will soon disappear. Although historically classified as an inter- mediate size vehicle, the Malibu was selected as a representative large automobile as its general occupant volume has been maintained during the down-sizing of the General Motors A- Body vehicles. Front wheel drive is also in- cluded in this new package so the selection of the Malibu to represent the largest size class of vehicles of the 1980' s appears to be objec- tive. The two smallest vehicles, Champ and Es- cort, were equipped with front bucket seats. It is believed that all vehicles in their size classes are similarly equipped. The Citation has a split bench seat design and the Malibu has a traditional front bench. DUMMY FAMILY MEMBERS AND SUBJECT SELECTION CRITERIA It has been assumed for this project that an automobile seat is designed for use by the entire adult population. This implies that the seated dummy family should represent all U.S. adults. Generally accepted human engineering design practice dictates that one should attempt to accommodate a minimum of 90% of the potential users. The traditional population range is bounded by 5th percentile female measurements on one end and 95th percentile male measurements on the other. This accommodates more than 90% of all potential users and was thereby accepted as a target population range. The basic question which remains is selec- tion of the members of the family. Even though most applications involve use of a mid-size device, the role of additional large and small dummies in a family is important based on their increased or decreased mass and size. The mass variable is important in assessing structural integrity of occupant protective systems while size is relevant to the size and shape of the vehicle interior available for containing the occupant and protective equipment. The case for a mul ti -dummy family is strengthened by the concept of experimental design. Experimental design requires a minimum of two test conditions for each variable to al- low interpolation of test results over the range of the variable. Mass (light and heavy) and size (short and tall) are the variables in this case. 4.487</page><page sequence="3">4.488 D- BOBBINS, ET AL.

The minimum family which takes into account all these factors equally consists of four members - two females (small and mid-sized) and two males (mid-sized and large). The quantities, small, mid-sized, and large, apply to the two basic physical variables - mass and height. However, for time-cost effectiveness, it was decided that the mid-sized female member could be dropped without significant sacrifice of population representation and application goals of the fam i 1 y . Once this family was constituted, it was necessary to establish an appropriate sample of human volunteers whose heights and weights ac- curately fit the criteria for each family mem- ber. The initial sampling was based on exten- sive analysis of the National Health and Nutri- tion Examination Survey (NHANES) U.S. population data for stature and weight variables. For the large and small members, subjects were selected with both height and weight within 2-1/2 percen- tiles of the 95th and 5th percentile values (i.e., 2-1/2 to 7-1/2 or 92-1/2 to 97-1/2 per- centiles). For the mid-sized male, subjects were selected with height and weight within 10 percentiles of the 50th percentile values (i.e., 40th to oOth percentiles. Table 2 shows height and weight criteria for each subject group in- cluding the mid-sized females. Results of analysis of the NHANES data in- dicated that for the extreme groups, selecting the desired percentile for one variable would not produce a sample whose mean value for the second variable is the desired percentile. For example, selecting females who are 5th percen- tile by stature results in a sample whose mean weight is about 1 30 lbs. rather than 104 lbs. which is the 5th percentile weight of U.S. adult females. Similarly, large males who are 95th percentile in stature have a mean weight value of about 194 lbs. rather than the desired 225 lbs. Thus, selecting persons by the defined criteria for both height and weight simul- taneously required careful screening for both variables in a search for persons comprising a relatively small percentage of the population. In addition to the primary selection vari- ables of height and weight, an attempt was made to select subjects over the age range of 18 to 74 years such that: 1. the mean age was close to the mean age of automobile drivers (approximate- ly 37 years) ; and2. the subject sample for each group contained both young persons who are at high risk of vehicle accidents and elderly per- sons who are at high risk of serious injury. Consideration was also given to achieving a rep- resentative balance by race (i.e., approximately 10% non-Caucasian). MEASUREMENTS ON SUBJECTS SEATED IN VEHICLES In the first phase of data collection it was necessary to assess preferred occupant seat position, posture, and orientation in one of the four selected vehicle types to design laboratory seat-bucks for the remainder of the study. Sub- jects responding to advertisements for desired height and weight criteria were measured to con- firm their qualification for participation. Anthropometr i ca 1 1 y qualified subjects were also screened using a health questionnaire and measured for buttock-knee length and erect sit- ting height. These last two measures were used as secondary selection and screening variables. The subjects' shoe heel thickness was also measured. Each subject was then asked to sit in the drivers seat of one of the four vehicles, to adjust the seat to the preferred position, and to assume a comfortable driving posture with the right foot on the undepressed accelerator pedal and both hands on the steering wheel. With the subject holding this position, measures of seat track detent, accelerator heel position and right foot roll and pitch angles were obtained. In a few instances it was noted that without some instruction, subjects would choose to sit in rather unorthodox (but probably realistic) positions such as with the buttock and/or back away from the seat-back. Such ob- servations led to lengthy discussions of "realistic", "normal", "typical", and so on with regard to driving posture and resulted in general agreement of the need for some degree of similarity in seated postures between subjects within each group. Without similarity, the averaging of data would have become difficult and, perhaps, meaningless. Therefore the phrase "standardized driving posture" was coined to mean a relaxed, comfortable driving position with certain guidelines (i.e., with the buttocks contacting the seat-back/seat-cushion interface, the back resting comfortably against the seat- back, and both hands symmetrically placed on the steer i ng whee 1 ) . Photographs were taken of the subject in both the preferred and standardized driving pos- tures with and without the 3"Point seat belt in place. Generally there was little noticeable difference between the two postures (see Figure 1). However, a few subjects, particularly in the small female group, demonstrated significant var i at i ons .

These data insured that each vehicle seat-buck simulated the proper relationship of vehicle interior features relative to each other and the accelerator heel-point. To validate proper seat location, the SAE J826 H-point machine was used to determine seat- buck H-point parameters to compare with the H- point design specifications for each vehicle. Since the bucks did not have an accelerator pedal, it was necessary to set and fix the ac- celerator heel-point of the H-point machine before initiating the H-point procedure. With seats correctly positioned per vehicle package dimensions, data from the first phase were used to specify seat-track detent position, toe-board location and tilt for each subject group/vehicle combination. Figure 2 illustrates some of the basic features involved in setting up the bucks. Since foot pitch and rotation angles were similar across all subject/vehicle conditions, the averages of all subjects were used (58 degrees pitch and 12 degrees rotation). Seat-track detent values were averaged for each of the possible situations (3 subject groups times A vehicles) and rounded off to the nearest integer value. The subjects' heel position relative to the front seat mounting bolt was determined by applying a correction factor due to shoe heel thickness (subjects were barefoot in buck) and detent round off: MEASUREMENTS IN THE SOFT SEATS - For each subject group, eight subjects were selected at random from the subject pool for participation in the second phase of data collection. The subjects changed into clothing consisting of brief under shorts and a halter for the women. After repeating height and weight measures to confirm that the subject still qualified, the subject was targeted with contrast dots to mark the palpated skeletal landmarks listed in Table 3. Location of the pelvis was accomplished by palpating the anterior superior iliac spines (ASIS) and symphysion and having the subject hold and press 1/A-inch diameter rods on the tissue over these palpated points. Location of the three-space coordinates of each of the targets was accomplished using a stereophotogrammetr i c system consisting of the seven camera arrangement shown in Figure 3. These cameras were positioned to view the sub- ject and seat buck from the front, side and rear. The techniques used to determine the three-dimensional location of points viewed by two or more of the cameras involves direct linear transformation as reported by Abdel-Aziz et al. (6). Calibration of the system for the space occupied by the seated subjects was ac- complished using a three-space calibration grid of dyed spherical markers. The cameras were fired simultaneously by means of air pressure activated solenoids attached to each camera shutter release button. Location of the pelvic landmarks at the tip of each probe were obtained by determining the locations of three contrast rings at known positions along the rods and ex- trapolating along the least square fitting vec- tor to the end of the probe which was a known distance from the rings. With the subject seated in one of the vehicle seats on the laboratory buck, (two sub- jects from each group sat in each seat), two sets of photographs were taken to obtain pos- tural anthropometric data. In the first set the subject seated himself or herself in the stan- dardized driving posture with hands on the steering wheel at the 10 and 2 o'clock positions and the feet symmetrically positioned on the toe board. In the second set, the steering wheel was removed and the subject held the two probes pressed firmly on the tissue over left ASIS and symphys i on . After completing the second set of photographs, the subject was asked to get off the seat buck and the seat was readied for cast- ing the subject/seat interface. This process was greatly facilitated by use of a new material called Scotchcast produced by 3M Corporation. This material is essentially a resin impregnated cloth that hardens to a rigid structure in about 10 minutes when exposed to moisture. Strips of Scotchcast were placed over the vehicle seat be- tween thin plastic liners prior to the subject slowly lowering into the standardized driving position by means of a trapeze bar. While the Scotchcast material was hardening, it was fas- tened to three aluminum frame supports with met- al tabs and pop-rivets. These tabs and supports provided the means for relocating the casting in its original position after the subject and seat were removed. While the material was setting up, three more sets of photographs were taken to document the subject's position and posture in the seat with casting material. The first set of photos with hands on the steering wheel provided infor- mation on the location of anatomical landmarks to compare seated posture with and without the Scotchcast. The second and third photo sets were with the subject holding the pelvic probes and were used not only to determine the location of the pelvis but also to locate the center-line of each subject along the Y-axis (i.e., side to side) which was necessary for merging and averaging the seat-casting contours from dif- ferent vehicle seats. After completion of photogrammetr y and when the Scotchcast had hardened (approximately 10 to 15 minutes), the subject and seat were removed from the buck and the seat casting was replaced in the frame and targeted with several rows of contrast dots. A final set of photographs were taken to document the location of these dots in vehicle buck coordinates and thereby determine the individual subject/seat interface contours.

X- and Y-coord i nates from each film frame were transmitted directly to computer storage and then transformed into 3" D laboratory coordinates using DLT reconstruc- tion programs modified for these data points. Seat castings were digitized from three camera views using the rows of contrast dots placed on the castings. To define one standard hard-seat for each subject group from four different vehicle seats positioned differently on the buck, it was necessary to merge the data from the eight seat castings for each group prior to averaging. The first thought was to merge based on the seat H-points. For subjects who weighed significantly less than the H-point machine (e.g., the small females), the seat contour deflection is less than that for the H-point machine in proportion to the softness of the seat (ignoring shape difference effects). Thus, for softer seats the difference in weight be- tween subject and machine resulted in a larger difference in deflection in the region of H- point than for harder seats. This led to the unacceptable result that the seat contour in the region of maximum deflection for stiff seats fell below that for softer seats. As alternatives to the H-point for merging seat contours, the following procedures were cons i dered : 1) DO NOTHING (leave the contours in the iner- tial coordinates of the seat buck measure- ment laboratory) ; 2) Use an ANATOMICAL POINT on each subject (e.g., iliac spine) as a common alignment poi nt ; 3) Use the X- and Z-TRANSLAT I ON distances for each seat needed to achieve alignment of the UNLOADED SEAT CONTOURS. Inspection of the X-Z midline contours for a set of eight castings revealed differences in the relations of seat contours but it was not immediately apparent which was the best procedure. For the case of no merging, the con- tours showed more scatter in the anterior- posterior direction. This approach was dropped. In the final analysis, it was found that merging on the center point between the iliac spines and merging on the features derived from the un- deformed seats yielded very similar results. The former (merging on iliac spines) was chosen as the method to be used as it was related to a merging on subject data rather than seat fea- tures . Prior to the second phase of data collec- tion and analysis it was not known how many sub- jects would be required to define the standard hardseats or even if the castings from different vehicle seats would be similar enough to be merged in a meaningful way. Therefore, prelimi- nary seat castings were made for: 1) the same subject seated twice in the same vehicle seat to assess within subject variability, and 2) the same subject in the four different vehicle seats to assess between vehicle variability. Analysis of these data were favorable toward continuing with data collection. Graphical comparisons of the mid-line X-Z contours for the eight seat castings in each subject group also confirmed that this was a sufficient number of castings to adequately define the contours of the standard hardseats . After the raw data points for each casting were shifted to merge the iliac spine in each subject group, SURF I I , a three-dimensional plot- ting and griding program developed at the University of Kansas, was used to obtain each casting contour. Plots were then visual iy ex- amined and edited for bad data points. As the next step, the digitized data points, obtained from dots placed manually on the castings, were interpolated using SURF I I to provide Z-values at desired X- and Y-coord i nates common to all cast- ings. The final symmetric hard-seat contour was obtained by taking the simple average of Z- values at each of these grid points utilizing the data from both sides of each casting (i.e., by averaging sixteen Z-values at each grid poi nt) . Figure 5 shows the midline cross-section for the eight castings used to determine the "medium" male standard hard-seat while Figure 6 shows the final three-dimensional plot. STANDARD SEAT CONSTRUCTION Designing the hard-seats began with full scale plotting of the averaged seat casting data for X-Z plane cross-sections at increments of one inch from the centerline. These plotted contours were faired between distinct digital data points (every Al. 2 mm) and the plots were over-laid and examined to ensure against any discontinuities between sequential cross- sections. Lines defining important features of the seat (i.e., the front vertical plane, seat- back thickness and shape, top of seat-back, and bottom of legs) were drawn in and the completed drawings were delivered to the University of Michigan Ship Hydrodynamics Laboratory Model Shop along with Y-Z and X-Y full scale cross- section plots of the seat-cushion and seat-back reg i ons . One- i neh thick mahogany boards were cut to the approximate X-Z plane contours and laminated. Cardboard templates of cross-section contours were made from the drawings and used to check the seat as carving progressed. Other cross-section templates from the X-Z and X-Y plane drawings were used to check consistency in these directions after th,e X-Z contours were completed. The seat was constructed with a removable two inch wide center section down the back to allow for viewing targets placed on the</page><page sequence="9">4#494 D. H. ROBB INS , ET AL. FIGURE 5.

The completed hard-seat was coated with a rubber-based paint to seal and protect the final product. It was then brought back to UMTR I where 1-1/A in. aluminum plates were attached to the legs. The seat was positioned on the laboratory buck platform using the forward, lower edge of the front legs as a reference line to locate it properly so that the three- dimensional hard-seat contour attained the exact position in buck coordinates as specified by the drawings. The completed seat for the mid-sized male surface form is shown in Figure 7- ACQUISITION OF DATA FOR SEATED SURFACE FORM CONSTRUCTION AND SPECIFICATION PACKAGE In order to develop a geometric and mass definition of a person seated in an automobile, the gathering of geometric data was viewed from a number of perspectives: The subject pool was defined in terms of standard anthropometry in order to assure that the selected population was represented . The targeting was chosen to be relatable to the definitions contained in McConville et al. (7), and Snyder et al. (8), in order to provide information for derivation and es- timation of the internal body linkage, joints, segmentation, centers of gravity, inertial properties, etc. The targeting and other measurements were chosen to provide sufficient detail with respect to body surface shape to give guidance to the sculptors of the master sur- face form. The third phase of data collection was divided into two parts and used twenty-five sub- jects from each group selected to attain mean height and weight values close to the NHANES percentile target means of each group. In the first part, the series of standard measurements listed in Table 4 was taken using the UMTRI automated anthropometry system to determine skeletal link lengths and provide a basis for comparing each subject population with other studies and populations. The second part involved measuring subjects in the standard hard seat. They were first asked to sit in the seat in the standardized driving posture, hands on the steering wheel at the 10 and 2 o'clock positions, feet against the toe board. They were then instructed to refrain from movement while 58 markers were placed on the skin over palpated bony landmarks and at other points listed in Table 6. After placement of the markers, height measurements of certain landmarks were taken, as were arm and leg angles, and the distance between the elbows and knees. Next, a series of four photographs was taken to document the positions of the markers: 1) Subject with hands on steering wheel; 2) Subject with hands dropped and steering wheel removed to view torso and abdominal markers ; 3) Subject holding probe on symphysion; k) Subject holding probes on anterior superior i 1 i ac spi nes . Figures 8 and 9 show the subject in the first and fourth positions and illustrate the targeted points. After completion of these photographs, additional anthropometric measures of breadth, depth, length, and circumference not critically dependent on subject movement were taken to com- plete a total of 82 anthropometric measures in the automotive seated posture. The values ob- tained for the mid-sized male group are included in Table 5- Finally, a series of five contours was taken of the shoulder, knee, and thigh regions using a specially designed contour gauge. Individual tracings were superimposed to construct an average profile. Cardboard templates were made from these profiles for use by the sculptor. The photographs were analyzed using the direct linear transformation programs to define the location of the 58 landmarks in a laboratory-based coordinate system. The three- dimensional data for these points are given in Table 6 for the mid-sized male. The targets marked with an "x" in the "linkage" column of Table 6 are those estimated to be required for internal geometric linkage development. Thirty-one of them are minimum re- quirements for body segmentation, mass property definition, and segment coordinate system con- struction using the formulae and techniques of McConville et al. (7). Three additional landmarks can be used to locate the position of the scapula within the space defined by a separate shoulder girdle mass. Five of the landmarks relate to the spinal column. These data were required as input for procedures reported by Snyder et al. (8), to define the location of several spinal interface centers with respect to surface coordinate data and are important for placing the vertebral column in a correct relationship to the exterior of the sur- face form. CONSTRUCTION OF SEATED SURFACE FORM The development of the seated surface form was accomplished in four steps including con- structing an armature, building a clay model, casting a multi-piece plaster mold, and fabricating an epoxy/f i berg 1 ass shell. For the mid-sized male the skeletal armature consisted of acrylic castings of bones closely represent- ing 50th percentile sizes determined from the third phase of data collection. The acrylic castings of the ends of long bones were con- nected with adjustable steel shafts to allow lengthening or shortening.

The armature, roughly simulating skeletal structure, thus was suitably positioned in the laboratory coordinate system under the surface landmarks. Translation of measured three-dimensional coordinates each to the seat buck was achieved by means of a three- dimensional measurement frame designed to fasten to the buck platform. Clay was then built around the armature to fill in the soft tissue. The surface landmarks were specified as design points which had to be duplicated in three-dimensional coordinates within 2 millimeters. The circumferences and the remainder of the anthropometric measurements obtained in the standard seat were used to as- sist in defining the shape of the clay form. Additional information was available from the contour measurement for the shape of the shoulder and knee. Figure 10 shows the com- pleted mid-sized male surface form in clay. Strips were then placed on the surface as an aid to digitize outlines of body shape for use in engineering specification drawings of the sur- face form. multi-piece plaster mold was made using a high quality, low expansion plaster. After removal from the clay form, each piece of the mold was finished off, sealed and waxed. The various epoxy/f i berg 1 ass sections were then laid up in- dividually with several layers of glass and epoxy and then assembled together using epoxy and fiberglass to seal the seams. In this process, the hard-seat itself served as the mold for the occupant/seat interface thereby ensuring a perfect f i t of dummy form and standard seat. The final steps in the fabrication of the mid-sized male shell involved smoothing the sur- face and coating with epoxy paint. Anodized aluminum rivets were inserted into drilled holes in the shell to mark the location of the various surface landmarks. Figure 11 shows a left side view of the final mid-sized male surface form seated in the standard seat assembly. ANTHROPOMETRIC SPECIFICATION PACKAGE DEVELOPMENT OF STANDARD SEAT COORDINATE SYSTEM - The selection of a standard seat coor- dinate system was made between two candidates: Traditional H-point (representing the hîp joint) Seat-based coordinate system The traditional H-point represents a point on the H-point machine associated with the hip pivot point. Seat-based coordinate systems of- ten reflect the intersection point between seat back and seat cushion lines. The continuous curvature of the seat back and cushion of the average standard seat which was developed on this project prevented development of any clear definition of seat back and seat cushion lines. FIGURE 10. Surface Form in Clay. FIGURE 11. Final Mid-Size Male Surface Form with Metal Surface Landmark Points.</page><page sequence="16">VEHICLE OCCUPANT POSTURE 4.501 Hence, it was decided that the traditional H- point concept offered the better alternative. Surface landmarks (right and left anterior superior iliac spines as well as symphysion) were available for orientation of the pelvis in three dimensional coordinates. In order to define the H-point it was necessary to estimate tissue thicknesses of the surface landmarks over the body landmarks. Estimations for these data being available, it was then possible to orient the pelvis in space if an appropriate average structure could be found. The data of Reynolds et al. (9), are based on a subject group similar in average stature and weight to those measured during the current study. These data were used for the following purposes : Location of the standard seat coordinate system at the center of a line connecting the H-points; Location of the center of rotation of the two hip joints; Location of the lumbar-sacral (L5/S1) joint center . In order to apply Reynolds' data, his three- dimensional coordinate system was superimposed upon the UMTRI data for anterior superior iliac spine and symphysion. This allowed conversion of any of the Reynolds et al. data points into the UMTRI laboratory coordinate system. Points of particular application were; Anterior superior iliac spine Symphysion Ili ocr i sta 1 e H-points Points on the 1st sacral vertebral body Points on the ischial tuberosity The key points for development of a standard seat coordinate system were the H-points. The center of the line connecting these two points is located at X-657, Y=6 1 9 , Z-k22 in the UMTRI laboratory coordinate system used earlier in this paper. All further data in the paper are related to a coordinate system with this point as an origin. SEGMENTATION AND LINKAGE SYSTEM - The traditional segmentation of the human body for use in developing crash test device linkages is as fol lows: - Head - 2 Lower Legs - Neck - 2 Feet - Thorax - 2 Upper Arms - Abdomen - 2 Lower Arms - Pelvis - 2 Hands - 2 Upper Legs Although substantial mobility in the shoulder girdle has been known for years (see Dempster (10,11) and Snyder et al. (8)), only minimal data are available for the description of its mass and inertial properties. Dempster (10,11) reports a center of gravity, mass, and inertial properties around the side-to-side axis (Y-axis) for the masses associated with scapula, clavicle, and soft tissues exterior to most of the bony thorax. No shoulder girdle data are given in the most recent work of McConville et al. (7) and Reynolds et al. (12). As a result, it was concluded that insufficient consistent data were available from the literature to con- struct a separate shoulder girdle within the scope of the current activity. A non- trad i t i ona 1 segmentation scheme is recommended for the eventual advanced dummy family which includes a separate, mobile shoulder girdle link and the associated mass. Sufficient surface landmarks are available in the UMTR I data (scapula, clavicle, extent of rib cage) to define this segmentation. Mass, center of gravity, and inertial properties could be measured directly from a solid casting of the surface form shoulder girdle after separation from the thorax. In conclusion, the traditional segmentation and linkage system was adopted as the only one feasible based on available data. It has been simplified slightly by coupling hand and lower arm masses although the location of the wrist joint is specified. Figure 12 shows the segmen- tation planes, linkage, and other aspects of the anthropometric specifications. CONSTRUCTION OF SEGMENTATION PLANES - The construction of segmentation planes is based largely upon the scheme used by McConville et al. (7) in their determination of anthropometric relationships of body and body segment moments of inertia. The constructions are modified somewhat to account for differences between body segment relationships in the seated and standing postures . The head plane is defined to pass through the left and right gonial points and the nuchale for a standing subject. As head orientation is very similar for both standing and seated pos- ture, it is assumed that the procedure can be directly adopted. The gonial points are avail- able from UMTRI measurements. The nuchale was estimated from data contained in the McConville et al. report. The neck segmentation consists of two planes. The first plane is parallel to the floor and anterior to cervicale. The second plane originates at the clavicle and tilts up and back at a k$° angle until it intersects with the horizontal plane. Because the orientation of head and neck were similar in the seated and standing postures, this procedure was adopted d i rect 1 y . The thorax definition specifies that the plane originates at the 10th rib mid-spine landmark and passes through the torso parallel with the standing surface. In order to ap- proximate this plane in the seated posture, a line was constructed from the 10th rib landmark which was perpendicular to a line connecting the T12 and L5 surface landmarks. This line, which is roughly perpendicular to the body centerline, is intended to separate the thorax which has a bony skeletal periphery from the abdomen which</page><page sequence="17">4 502 D. H.

In dynamic ap- plications, thorax and abdomen will have very different stiffnesses and are coupled very dif- ferently to the bony skeleton. For the abdomen the definition specifies that the plane 'originates at the iliocristale landmarks and passes through the torso parallel with the standing surface.' This plane presents a dilemma even more complex than the thorax. Because of the spinal tilt due to the seated posture, it would seem logical to develop a seg- mentation scheme similar to that used for the thorax. However, on the basis of the physical na- ture of the abdomen, it is preferable to define a scheme which better delineates the extent of the soft abdomen. A pair of new planes are proposed, the first of which angles backward from the iliocristale landmarks perpendicular to the same line connecting the T12 and L5 surface landmarks which was used in constructing the thorax plane (see Figure 13). The second plane is horizontal and extends from the iliocristale target to the front of the body. The region of maximum abdominal protrusion is included in this definition. This plane passes just above the anterior superior iliac spine landmarks and about 50 mm above symphysion. Two more observations on the McConville et al. data conclude the information required for making a final decision on the abdomen segmenta- tion plane. The first is that the distance be- tween the thorax and abdomen planes, which are parallel, is similar to the distance from the iliocristale landmark to the thorax segmentation plane developed from tne UMTRI data. The second is that the data which are available for mass and inertial properties apply only to the paral- lel planes through the iliocristale and 10th rib 1 andmarks . The conclusion was to present data based on a segmentation plane parallel to the thorax plane and recommend that new inertial and mass properties be developed based on the proposed definition given above and illustrated in Figure 13. The objective of the hip segmentation plane was to separate the upper leg region from the bony pelvis. The procedure used by Clauser et al. (13) extended the plane 'from the level of the iliac crest interiorly along the external shelf of the ilium, cutting the rim of the acetabulum and severing the ischial tuberosity (posteriorly at the level of the attachment of M. Semimembranous, anteriorly at the mid-point of the ascending ramus of the ischium).' That procedure yields a plane which approximately bisects the H-point and removes as little of the bony pelvis as possible. A procedure which defines a plane based on available data and which avoids cutting into the pelvic bone mass uses the four bony landmarks quantified by Reynolds et al. (9): Anterior superior iliac spines Pubotuberos i ty Lateral tuberosity point Inferior tuberosity point To define a pelvic mass which is separate from the upper leg mass, a segmentation plane is proposed which does not intersect the average pelvis but which maintains the relation to the inguinal ligaments, is very similar to the other procedures, and can be quantified in three- dimensional coordinates. To represent pubotuberos i ty a point 35 mm lateral to the symphysion on (or near) the dummy surface has been selected. Likewise, for the anterior superior iliac spine, a lateral shift of 10 mm from the surface marker is selected. The final point, which may be considered the represent the bottom of the crotch, is selected as 10 mm lateral to and projected vertically to the seat surface from the inferior tuberosity point. This segmentation plane passes 8 mm lateral (oblique) to the H-point joint center and less than 2 mm from the lateral tuberosity. The definition for knee plane specifies that the plane 'passes through the lateral femoral condyle landmark parallel to the stand- ing surface.' Because of the difference between the standing and seated postures, this defini- tion is not realistic. As an alternative, which is designed to separate the upper and lower leg masses, it is proposed to pass the plane through the lateral femoral condyles bisecting the angle in the X-Z plane made by the lines connecting the upper and lower leg links. The definition for ankle plane specifies that the plane 'originates at the sphyrion landmark and passes through the ankle parallel to the standing surface.' This plane is main- tained fairly well by constructing a plane through the sphyrion landmark, parallel to the Y-axis, and perpendicular to a line projected into the X-Z plane connecting the knee and ankle joi nts . For the shoulder, the definition specifies that the plane 'originates at the acromion landmark and passes downward through the anterior and posterior scye creases at the level of the axilla.' This segmentation plane appears to be similar for both the standing and seated postures . For the elbow, the definition specifies that the plane 'originates at the olecranon landmark and passes through the medial and lateral humeral epicondyle landmarks.' Table 7 lists the formulation of the various segmentation planes in the coordinate system based on the H-points. It should be noted that the formulae for segmentation planes can be used to determine the intersection of the plane with the surface form at points other than surface landmarks used in the definitions. DEVELOPMENT OF ANATOMICALLY-BASED SEGMENT COORDINATE SYSTEMS - This part of the paper shows the development of anatomically based</page><page sequence="19">4.504 D* H* ROBBINS, ET AL. coordinate systems for each of the various seg- ments of the body. The coordinate systems which have been constructed are the same, or very similar to, those which have been reported by McConville et al. (7) in developing anthropometric relationships of body and body segment moments of inertia. As such, they have been used directly in the presentation of center of mass and inertial data will provide the linkage between the coordinate system defining the principal axes of inertia and the standard coordinate system at the h-point center. Table 8 shows the measures of surface landmarks used in constructing the segment systems. Four of these differ from McConville definitions. The 'intersection point on the back of the surface form...,1 used for the thorax and abdomen coor- dinate systems, is chosen to define a coordinate line perpendicular to the back of the seated oc- cupant. Also, it was necessary to reconstruct a trochanter i on point different from that obtained in the measurements due to differences in definitions between research teams. Finally, the heel point mark on the floor of the seat back was used to model posterior calcaneus. Details of the development process are included in the UMTR I project final reports (1A). Table 9 gives the location of origins of segment anatomical coordinate systems in the H-point based coordinate system.

VOLUME, MASS, AND INERTIAL PROPERTIES - To compute the segment volumes, the regression equations given in McConville et. al. (7), were used. The predicted volumes and the sum of volumes for the whole body are given in the first column of Table 10. The values obtained from the left and right sides of the body have been averaged. If one uses these volumes in combination with density data from page 25 of the McConville et al. report, the resulting body weight would be 18A.2 lb., an overestimate of about 3%. The density data are from Dempster (15) and Clauser et al. (13)- Because of this apparent overes t i mat i on of volume a correction factor was used as follows: Volume Correction Factor = (Average subject mass/initial prediction) = O.9I66 Scaled volumes and estimated masses are given in the final two columns of Table 11. An overes- timation of volume was expected based on similar results reported by McConville et al. McConville et al. (7) give data on center of volume for the various segments of the body. The assumption was made that center of mass and center of volume are coincident. It is known that this assumption is not completely correct because of density variations with segments. Clauser et al. (13) note that mid-volume of limb segments are proximal to centers of mass. The differences, however, are small and believed to be insignificant in comparison with other pos- sible errors. The greatest of these is the mobility of soft tissues with respect to the bony skeleton as the body moves either volun- tarily or especially under impact loading. For the current static case of seated posture, and for applications where the assumption of an ar- ticulated linkage of rigid masses is valid, the forestated assumption is believed to be ade- quate. However, if these data are to be used for dynamic applications where there is loose coupling between soft tissue and bony skeleton, the assumption should be questioned and sub- stitute data gathered where necessary. To the knowledge of the present authors, there are no substantive published data available to address this issue for automotive applications. Table 11 gives the location of estimated centers of gravity with respect to the whole body coor- dinate system. To compute the segment moments of inertia, the regression equations given by McConville et al. (7) were used. The predicted segment iner- tial properties are given in the first three columns of Table 12. Values from the left and right sides of the body have been averaged. A MODEL FOR THE LOCATION OF JOINT CENTERS - The most commonly accepted location for a joint at the head/neck interface is at the occipital condyles. Mertz et al. (l6) and Ewing et al. (17) have used this point for presentation of neck torque data. Its location has been given in anatomical coordinates constructed from targets on the superior edge of each auditory meatus and at the infraorbital notches (l8). So, it will be assumed that the coordinate sys- tem of Ewing et al. is cons i stent wi th that of the current project. The location of the various joint centers are given Table I3. The Snyder et al. report (8), dealing with the link system of the human torso, provides the only known source of data which relates external spinal landmarks to vertebral interspaces. As such, it has been used to construct the spinal linkage from the C7/T1 to the 1 umbar/sacra 1 interface. The seated posture used in the torso link study was most often more erect than that assumed in the automobile seated posture. However, the position of the arm in the current study was about the mid-range for most of those assumed by subjects in the torso link study. The available data from the torso-link study i n- c 1 ude: Distances between surface landmarks, Distances from surface landmarks to ver- tebral interface, Angles between lines connecting surface landmarks and a laboratory coordinate sys- tem, and Angles between lines connecting surface landmarks with vertebral interfaces and a laboratory coordinate system. It should be noted that the surface landmarks chosen for the current project were selected to match those of the torso link study.

H. ROBB INS, BT AL. the geometry of the torso link data, vertebral joint centers were estimated. The shoulder girdle is the structure which connects the arms to the remainder of the bony skeleton. This structure, often represented by a simple ball joint in crash test dummies, ac- tually consists of three independent joints and two bony links. The joints are the: Sternoclavicular joint where the clavicle meets the sternum C 1 av i scapu 1 ar joint which models the complex connection of the scapula to the clavicle (10) -- Glenohumeral joint where the humerus inter- acts with the scapula at the glenoid fossa The body links can be modeled as: -- The clavicle from the sternoclavicular to the c 1 av i scapul ar joint The scapula from the c I av i scapu 1 ar to the glenohumeral joint In order to implement the shoulder concepts of Dempster (10, 15» 19)» the following surface landmarks were used: CI avi cai e Acrom i o-c 1 av i cu 1 ar articulation Greater tubercle of humerus - Medial and lateral humeral epicondyles Dempster has defined the elbow joint to be the 'midpoint of a line between (1) the lowest palpable point of the medial ep i condyle of the humerus, and (2) a point 8 mm above the radiale (radio-humeral junction).1 The two bony landmarks available from the present project which were used in this reconstruction were the radiale and the medial humeral epicondyle. The 8 mm point was chosen to be along an extension of the lower arm defined simply as a line from the ulnar styloid to the radiale. The wrist joint has been considered in or- der to define a long axis of the forearm based on joint centers. Again, Dempster's definition has been used. The hip joint centers have already been discussed in detail. The center of the line connecting these points is used as the origin of the standard seat coordinate system. They have been developed based on symphysion and anterior superior iliac spine surface landmarks in con- junction with the pelvic reconstruction of Reynolds et al . (9) . Based on Dempster and Frankel (20) it is estimated that knee joint center can be ap- proximated by the center of a line connecting the lateral and medial femoral epicondyles. Tht axis of the pin joint will be on a line perpen- dicular to the plane formed by the lines con- necting joint centers in the upper and lower legs. The ankle joint center has been defined by Dempster to be on the 'level of a line between the tip of the lateral malleolus of the fibula and a point 5 mm distal to the tibial mal- leolus.' So the ankle joint center is at the center of the line connecting a shifted sphyrion landmark with the lateral malleolus of the fibula which was also measured in the current project. JOINT PARAMETERS - There are two basic types of parameters which should be considered in the development of joint parameters. The first of these is an identification of the range of mobility between different segments of the body. The second is the resistance of motion wnen one segment of the body moves with respect to its neighbors. The normal range of mobility of the body is usually described as joint range of motion data. The most commonly used sources are Dempster (15)» Barter et al. (21), and Glanville et al. (22). References with particularly exten- sive data on neck mobility have been prepared by Ferlic (23) and Snyder et al. (24,25). Thoracic and lumbar spine mobility data have been reported by Nyquist et al. (26), as well as Mi- tal et al. (27 » 28) and Krieger (29). Additional extensive range of motion data on head/neck flexion, extension, lateral flexion, rotation, and combined modes are expected in the near fu- ture from the Naval Aeromedicai Research Laboratory in New Orleans. An assembly of range of motion data is included in Table 14. Data on resistance to motion are very much more difficult to find, interpret, and assemble into a form usable in dummy design work. The most directly applicable data have been reported for the: - Neck by Mertz et al. ( 1 6) , Snyder et al. (24,25)» and Robb ins et al . (30) Head/trunk, waist, hip, knee, shoulder, el- bow by Krieger (29) - Lower spine by Nyquist (26) and Mi tal et al. (27,28) Shoulder, arms, legs by Engin et al. (31,32,33,34,35) SUMMARY The University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute has conducted a study of the seated posture of vehicle occupants. Work which has been completed for average-sized U.S. male occupants includes: 1. Development of an average contoured seat representing the interface between occupant and vehicle. 2. Fabrication of a complete body surface form representing the seated occupant which was based on extensive anthropometric measure- ments of subjects seated in representative automobile seats. 3. Development of specifications for the body surface form including segmentation, joint locations, segment masses, inert i al proper- ties, and mobility. These were all based on the available literature. 4. Full-scale engineering drawings illustrating the surface form outline, the anthropometric landmarks defining the average male form,</page><page sequence="24">VEHICLE OCCUPANT POSTURE 4.509 TABLE Ut: RANGE OF MOTION DATA Value Ref.

Although not reported in detail within this paper, similar data, drawings, and surface forms are in process for both the small female and large male vehicle occupant sizes. Recommendations have been made to evaluate and improve the b i omechan i ca 1 data base for ap- plication to the design of advanced anthropomor- phic test devices in several areas including: 1. The shoulder complex. Shoulder girdle mobility should be studied in detail and in- cluded in any improved dynamic test device. 2. Body segmentation. Planes separating the thorax, abdomen, and pelvis should be im- proved to better represent the dynamic be- havior of these elements. 3. Mobility between body segments. Although various data describing voluntary ranges of motion are available, the tests on which they are based are static. Research is still needed to define dynamic mobility, the resistance properties of most joints beyond voluntary ranges of motion, and the effects of tense muscles versus relaxed muscles. Also, all mobility data should be gathered and reported with respect to body or segment-based anatomical coordinate systems. In conclusion, data have been presented in this paper which define the vehicle seated pos- ture of an average U.S. male. The data presented are complete and can be either used directly or altered by the user.
