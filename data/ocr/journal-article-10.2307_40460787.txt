Mask Characteristics and Attributes Quite frankly, the mask is a charismatic device sui generis; whether in its magical, ritual, religious, artistic, or socio-political conception and application. Theatrically, it commands a cognitive ubiquitous presence that could be instantly felt in the auditorium. It possesses a cognitive form, a consciousness, and an essence. Therefore, whether the mask is native, common- place, or exotic to the culture that uses it; whether it is beautiful, placid, and sublime in form, structure, and appearance; or whether it is simply ugly, fierce-looking, horrendous, grotesque, and bizarre (like most African masks), a mask is generally presumed to be imbued with strange metaphysical powers and attributes. These could be (and they have been) translated into adept theatrical and aesthetic advantages both for the actor wearing the mask and for his audience. It is the peculiar combination of these attri- butes in the mask which ineluctably activate vibratory vectors that in turn create the strange feelings and atmosphere, characteristically native to the theatre - notably feelings of awe, wonder, admiration, and reverence which derive mostly from paradoxes, such as those innate to attraction Inih Akpan Ebong, poet, playwright, critic, actor, and play director; honours degree in English (Drama) from the University of Nigeria, Nsukka; Master's Degree in Theatre Art from Michigan State University; member of the World Leisure and Recreation Association (WLRA) and appointed into the International Commission for Leisure Information Exchange (INTERCALIX); since 1977 he is Lecturer at the University of Calabar, Nigeria, for Directing, Contemporary African, Third World, and Twentieth Century Theatre; in addition to his doctoral degree on "Utuekpe, a Nigerian 'Folk Theatre'" (University of Birmingham), Ebong is working on "Dramatic Theory and Criticism in Africa 1800-1980" and "The Theatre Concepts ofWole Soyinka" the mask has similarly been used for various geo-political, socio-cultural, and religious purpo- ses, for example, warfare, divination, and rites de passage, even for exhibitions and tourist indulgen- ces. It is virtually being used today in most cultures for the same or similar objectives. Historically, the mask is synonymously pre- sumed to date the human society. Even though its true origins may be shrouded in an enigmatic and mysterious whirlpool, yet it could be speculated with some certainty and accuracy that mask and mythology share common origins and ancestry: both are living conceptions of the human mind, with the one explaining the other, and designed principally to teach, amplify, and reinforce the religions, history, aspirations, hopes, fears, mora- lity, etc., of the community. Masks are, in fact, concretized and emblematic actualizations of mythological abstractions, specifically contrived to amplify, reinforce, and codify the beliefs, metaphysics, and cosmology of the community, including their basic and essential philosophy of life and existence. Therefore, its enigmatic origin notwithstanding, there is a considerable degree of unanimity about its artistic, religious, social, and other roles or functions in nearly every culture that has used the idiom. For example, it is almost universally accepted that the diverse applications of the mask idiom have their origins and roots in the religions, rituals, and theatre crafts of the so-called "primitive," non-literate societies. Similarly, the Greeks are universally acknowl- edged with scholarly accreditations for the "for- mal" and "conventional" use of the mask in the theatre. Later centuries have equally followed in the footsteps of ancient Greece. Medieval thea- tres, for instance, extensively used the various and repulsion, empathy and alienation, excite- ment and alarm, etc. Apart from its extensive use for the myriad forms of theatrical entertainment,</page><page sequence="2">2 Inih A. Ebong forms of the mask idiom to recapture their grim imaginations of hell, Lucifer, the demons, and anti-religious agencies. The Commedia dell'arte and the Court Masques were largely mask- oriented in conception and execution. The artists were quick to discover and exploit the infinite capacity of the mask for boisterous humour and poignant satire - a universal aesthetic principle common even among communities where the socio-aesthetic encapsulation of the mask is pre- dicated upon and dictated by ritual, religious, metaphysical, and cosmogonie primacy. 2. Theories and Functions of Mask In her definitive study of West African masks, Elizabeth Tonkin observes, for example, that "the 'dramatic' masquerade is especially satiric; the closer to the human, the more is that humanity criticised or ridiculed" (1979: 17). This is especi- ally true of Efik-Ibibio-Annang culture. Utuek- pe} for example, directs its mask energies towards poignant criticisms of social, in particular sexual, vices, even to the point of daring to call individual members of the society by name. Idip Akpan Adiamo, is an equally delightful example of penetrating social commentary; a delightful cre- ation of the paradoxical synthesis of comedy and tragedy, the bizarre and the sublime; a symbolic form by which modes of feelings are held before us for contemplation; a masquerade the perfor- mance of which is the continual inversion of orthodox views of wisdom and foolishness (see Ita 1975: 12). Similar usage has been made of the mask idiom in Europe, America, and the East. Bertolt Brecht, O'Neill, Shakespeare, and many others have used masks in their times to create and sustain diversely contrived emotional and psy- chological effects on their audiences. Eminent directors, actors, and theatre theoreticians have similarly used the mask idiom in their work. Stanislavski probably adapted the mask motif to propound his famous theories about acting. In fact, throughout all times, the mask has been used for the serious and the farcical, the tragic and the comic and humorous, the exotic and the com- monplace, the metaphysical and the mundane, the picturesque and the bizarre, the profound and the sordid, etc. And, these are also to be found in the theatre of speech, of mime, and of musicals. Because of the diversity of its usage and application, theatre practitioners throughout the world, especially directors and actors, are cogni- zant of, as well as they have fully acknowledged and accepted, the theatrical importance and signi- ficance of the mask idiom, which they have inevitably exploited to astoundingly successful and brilliant actualizations of their artistic and creative dreams. Jacques Copeau, Brecht, Wole Soyinka, Jerzy Grotowski, are only a few of such practitioners. In fact, a considerable number of them have accepted the pre-eminent and symbolic configuration of the mask idiom as the probable primordial lingua franca of the theatre. The modern theatre was, probably, drawn to this awareness by Jacques Copeau, himself a formidable influence on the modern theatre, especially in Europe and America. His extensive and relentless experimentations with, and applica- tions of, the mask motifs for ramified psycho- aesthetic vantages have had varying degrees of profound impact on modern theatre practitioners: Grotowski, for example. While this may hold very true for modern Europe and America, Africa remains an exception; chiefly because the use of mask in contemporary African theatre derives not from Copeau's influence, but directly from the cultural and metaphysical roots of African aesthe- tic thought and mind. Nevertheless, whether it is African or not, it is important to note that wherever the mask has been used as a theatrical device, there is always the consciousness (to borrow the words of J. S. Boston [1960: 59] in a different but related context) of using it to "heighten the atmosphere of alarm and excite- ment." Several views have been held to the fact that masks are profound universal statements on the metaphysical paradox of being and existence. "At its most fundamental," says Tonkin (1979: 1), "the act of masking is an embodied paradox: the wearer has a face and a not-face, he is transformed by that which dehumanizes him." Jon Baisch (1977: 18) contends that masks are the artistic creations of "universal duality." That is, they are 1 Annang puppetry and masquerade drama. Also the subject of current Ph. D. work. Anthropos 79. 1984</page><page sequence="3">Mask and Masking 3 visceral statements about the "duality" of man and his ever-changing universe; they symbolize the dual personality of man and the changes in his psychic and physical composition; they are powerful reverberations of the paradox of revela- tion in concealment and vice versa: masks are devices for concealment and disguise, but in the process they reveal the multifarious forms and attributes, polarities and essences of life, being, and existence. That is, they present double and mutiple images of the psycho-physical composi- tion of man and phenomena. Thus, in a relatively parallel argument, Robert Benedetti (1972: 72) concludes that the mask idiom is a principal psycho-physical "mechanism . . . designed to pro- ject a sense of the self." This idea or concept has been similarly and variously expressed and amplified by other theo- rists, practitioners, and critics in contexts slightly different from, but, nevertheless, adaxial to Bene- detti's. Stanley Macebuh (1974), for example, believes very strongly that the mask probably holds the key to the profound psychological contemplation of the essence and meaning of life. In Soyinka's view, the role, function, and signifi- cance of the mask are inextricably woven in collective ("communal") consciousness, in the "communal" metaphysics and cosmology from which the mask derives, and in terms of the "masonic" bond that exists between the mask and the community. Therefore, he argues, the mask could be the means or device for the "spatial definition of being within phenomena" (Soyinka 1976: 1-60). Jon Baisch (1977: 8) similarly argues that the mask could be a mechanism designed by man as "part" of man's attempt "to solve the mystery of his own identity." From these views, we could deduce, at least, three important univer- sal absolutes about the mask, namely: the mask is a (1) melange of cosmo-physical powers and attributes, (2) symbol of the universal paradox and duality of the cosmo-human personality, and (3) visceral matrix for the comprehension of the metaphysical paradox of man and phenomena. W. T. Benda's germane conclusion that the mask breathes and possesses life (1944: viii) crystallizes the argument that the primum mobile of the mask derives from the cosmo-physical agglomeration which characterizes and defines its nature and essence. The geist therefore of, and beliefs involved in, the charisma of the mask probably have their origins and roots in the cosmological power and vital energy innate to all organic and inorganic matter. The hypothesis contends that a mask will naturally assume or inherit the melange of attrib- utes innate to all the elements that compose it. And, this ever-present force vitale is a volatile, active, cosmic force that is at once creative and destructive, attractive and repulsive, empathetic and alienating, exciting and alarming, etc., how- ever sublime, exotic, commonplace, fierce- looking, or unbalanced the mask may appear in form and substance. Macebuh recalls, for instan- ce, that masks have been used in traditional Africa as instruments of warfare, to strike terror in the hearts of the opposing forces precisely because it was assumed that the sight of so unharmonious and unbalanced a spectacle would pre- sumably remind them of the unnaturalness of war (Macebuh 1974: 17). The moral, philosophical, and even metaphysical foundation for the functional configuration of the mask was precisely to compel the human society to contemplate and discover "the psychological significance of the beautiful," the aesthetic, and the sublime (ibid.); to nurture man's ability to discriminate between aesthetic, ethical, religious and moral values; and, to inform and regenerate the thought and behaviour of posterity towards the profound, the orderly, and the sublime (see Ebong 1976). In fact, as we have noted else- where, Ugly and fierce-looking masks were not necessarily intended to frighten spectators but to amplify the religio-metaphysical powers which they represented, as well as to create and establish that feeling of awe and reverence that was vitally necessary for holding together the social, political and religious structures of the community. Thus the grotesque and the terrifying combined in a strangely unique way to become an important aesthetic, socio-religious and socio-political factor in traditional African recreational and leisure arts (Ebong 1980: 90-91). 3. Masking for the Theatre The paradoxical synthesis manifested by eve- ry mask derives from the masonic bond that exists between their physical and metaphysical compo- nents. The mask wearer who is automatically Anthropos 79. 1984</page><page sequence="4">4 Inih A. Ebong linked with this bond becomes imbued with the consciousness of his masonic counterpart, as he absorbs its attributes. He becomes, according to Benda (not only possessed by it, but), "a weird, perfidious, and singularly perplexing object" (1944: 1), possessing the dual effect of "a release and a control" (Baisch 1977: 18). His action, Tonkin stresses, most simply and completely produces the effects understood in most Mask users' philosophies as the eliciting, channeling or control of Power. As with masks [masks per se] and A/asks [masks plus carriers], we here need to distinguish power in its common "social science" senses - political, coercive, etc. - and Power in all the dimensions which it can have, including fertility, growth and energy. These qualities are linked different- ly in different situations and societies (Tonkin 1979: 3). In the different cultures, the phenomenon is surrounded by taboos, sanctions, and sacrosanct rites and rituals for the protection of those who more directly handle, communicate, and com- mune with the mask and the unseen forces that surround it. Therefore, when worn or displayed, the completed mask usually becomes a complex apodictical suffusion of strange, metaphysical powers which its wearer absorbs and is directly felt and experienced by the audience. The concomitance to this theory is the expe- rience of possession which the mask frequently manifests, especially in non-literate societies where the mask idiom is not just integral but central to their social, religious, and artistic life. The power to "possess" and "take control of" its wearer induces the actor into a hypnotic state where he almost completely loses consciousness of his human personality and identity (Gassner's "depersonalization"). The actor attains a "dual" or "double" consciousness in the process of recreation, of recreating himself and redefining his being within phenomena. First, he is the known personality who, behind and inside the mask, is fully conscious of the uniqueness of his identity and the uniqueness öf the role he is playing as actor. Second, he is the unknown personality, the unpredictable, "weird" presence - the masked actor who, having absorbed the cosmological vitality of the mask, has become possessed by, and unified with, forces by far greater than, and beyond, his mortal estimation and control, and has therefore become transformed into both a receptacle and a vehicle for the "terrifying" forces of his subservience. David Cole shares the view that during this transmigration of consciousness, the tout ensemble of the mask invariably becomes "a precious means of union [and communion] with the divine" (Cole 1975: 33) which, according to Baisch (1977: 20), takes place in the "realm of myth and archetype." This is the metaphysical, transitional, realm of mind and matter; the explosive world of art (see Obiechina 1975: 61-62); the "illud tempus" (Cole 1975: 16); the "chthonic realm" which lies bet- ween two or more areas of existence, described as "the seething cauldron of the dark world will and psyche, the transitional yet inchoate matrix of death and becoming" (Soyinka 1976: 142). The union, therefore, of the protagonist with cosmo- logical divinity in the archetypal world, compels the actor to some decisively definite and symbolic processes of passage from one state of conscious- ness to another. This is precisely the meaning of Soyinka's contention that The actor dares not venture into this world unprepared without symbolic sacrifices and the invocation of the eudaemonic guardians of the abyss. In the symbolic disintegration and retrieval of the protagonist ego is reflected the destiny of man (1976: 36). This, in fact, means a rite de passage into, and through, the "psychic interior" (Cole 1975: 23) of the actor or protagonist; a process which ineluc- tably means the total submergence and transmi- gration, the "control and release," of the protago- nist's will and psyche to contact and commune with the godlike-demonic essences, the "eudae- monic," cosmo-human presences, that jealously guard and control the artistic-metaphysical world. We could state, with a measure of convic- tion and confidence, that Stanislavski's "psycho- physical" approach to acting owes much of its foundation to the mask theory of transmigrational consciousness, which Gassner (1956: 168) has defined as "depersonalization," and which Ton- kin (1979: 4) refers to as "the point of zero - complete absence." As an artistic, psycho-physical vehicle and receptacle, the protagonist finds himself in a paradoxical state of conflict and communion with forces absolutely beyond his powers and control. While in this state of "symbolic struggle," he is also able to interact with his audience, and to Anthropos 79. 1984</page><page sequence="5">Mask and Masking 5 communicate to them glimpses and experiences of the archetypal world. Soyinka (1976: 38) stresses that the protagonist's conflict is "a symbolic struggle with chthonic presences, the goal of the conflict being a harmonious resolution for the plenitude and the well-being of the community" - the audience. The actor brings into the "symbolic" conflict the personal jiuances of his personality as well as the cosmo-spiritual nuances of the role he is playing. The conflict takes various forms and shapes which include his attempt to challenge and bridge the gulf in existence and phenomena; to define his miniscule disposition within the macro- cosmic immensity whereby he could more readily and properly identify himself with his role; to absorb, and be absorbed by, the metaphysical essence of his role by unifying his consciousness with the primum mobile of the mask; and, to reconcile and, then, resolve his personal nuances with those of the metaphysical encapsulation of his role. The process leads ultimately to a union of consciousness. The union of nuances, and their total liberation from the control and influence of the protagonist, constitutes what has been com- monly defined and designated possession? and known to others as "trance," "depersonaliza- tion," "rapport," "somnambulist improvisa- tions," etc. Possession, writes J. P. Clark, is the attainment by actors in the heat of performance of "actual freedom of spirit from this material world," a state of transformation which has been given the rather sniggering name of "possession" or "auto-intoxica- tion" by those outside of its sphere of influence and sympathy. When [in] this stage of complete identifica- tion with his role ... at that point when . . . "things unseen enter the man," the actor may become a medium, a votary of some ancestor spirits or divine powers filling him with the gift of prophecy (1970: 87). Similarly, Soyinka (1976) argues that the actor, when possessed, becomes the unchallenged "mouthpiece" of the gods. Both views are anal- ogous to Cole's comparative synthesis of the shamanic-hunganic rituals as they closely relate to modern theatre practice. Under the influence of possession, Cole argues, the actor automatically becomes "the community's envoy," with the sole responsibility of reaching up ("journeying") to the "illud tempus" and, then reaching down ("returning") to the community with new knowl- edge and inspiration for action (Cole 1975: 12-57). The process and the experience whereby the actor advances "from [being a] masterful explorer to mastered vehicle" (which Cole defines as "the 'rounding'"; 1975: 15), finds profound expression in and through the medium of art and metaphysics. The "rounding" is a metaphysical state of absolute freedom; a "masonic union" which has the power to "unearth cosmic uncer- tainties"; a state of profound harmony with the cosmos during which the performer completely identifies himself with his role (see Soyinka). As Rotimi clearly observes, The mysteries and strange forces long identified with mask in traditional thought become real at the moment of ceremonial performance. This is when the power of the god or spirit of the ancestor comes forth and enters into the masked performer with the aid of the masking medium. The feel of the presence of these powers affects the masker's state of mind. Absolute belief in this presence results . . . self-identification by the masker with the power being pleased becomes total, and the caution of self-regard is submerged. Sometimes, further stimulated by sounds of rhythm (music), this feeling of mystical eminence is heightened and stretched beyond the level of the purely physical to affect the psyche, precipitating a state of trance (1971: 44). The Greek theatre was "an event" which relied very heavily for its success on the use of masks. The Greek mask was heavily coiffured and of a size to enlarge the actor's presence. Consider- ing the enormous size of the Greek theatre, it is, perhaps, reasonable to argue that the Greek mask was specially designed to "throw," project, and amplify the actor's voice - probably by means of a built-in megaphone device. By using the mask to exaggerate the facial features of the actor, the Greeks were committed to making clear at a distance the precise nature and intensity of the emotional and psycho-cosmic conflicts experien- ced by the character; King Oedipus, for example. And, to establish the distinction between the two extremes of human experience and emotion, the Greeks created two distinct types of mask - the tragic and the comic mask. By wearing the mask, the Greek actor was able to economize, clarify, and magnify his gestures and movements by 2 The subject of a recent discussion with Mr. Imai- kop S. Orok, a colleague, and the conclusion we both arrived at. Anthropos 79. 1984</page><page sequence="6">6 Inih A. Ebong simply transferring his facial expressions and gestures to his whole body. Every gesture he made clearly communicated the special needs and motives, moods and intentions of the character. The great idea and principle behind the Greek use of masks was latterly incorporated and amplified by Copeau, and almost perfected by Grotows- ki. Jacques Copeau, the French director, actor, and teacher was, perhaps, the first theatre practi- tioner to more seriously engage the attention of modern European and American theatre towards the realization of the infinite theatrical potentiali- ties of the mask (see Eldredge 1975; see also Baisch 1977). Before his retirement from the Comédie Française about 1941, Copeau had, for example, discovered that masks could be used as training devices to release his apprentice actors psychologically as well as teach them in a correct fashion to transform themselves physically and vocally into the being that masks represented (quoted in Eldredge 1975: 1 and "Abstract"). In his Theatre Lab, Grotowski uses the mask idiom to achieve an economy and immediacy of action and to enlarge the actor's presence. In his training and performance programmes, Grotows- ki, for instance, makes his actors wear masks and "imitate" the sounds, gestures, and other charac- teristic traits of the animals of their preference and choice, and towards which they were either affectionately drawn or could affectionately iden- tify themselves with. The onus probandi rests on the actor to express through intense concentration and visualization the sound, gesture, and other intimate characteristics of his chosen animal; a process which must first pass through the whole body . . . the body must adapt itself organically to the impulses that precede the sound. So it is necessary first to express the animal with the body (Grotowski 1968: 202). Throughout theatre history, theatre practi- tioners have recognized the role of the mask as a viable theatrical device capable of producing profound, even shocking, effects. They have, therefore, employed most of the mask motifs in furthering their ideas and visions about theatre. Grotowski, even Stanislavski, are notable exam- ples. They understand the iconology of the mask, know its symbolic and metaphysical language. These they have translated into diverse and profound aesthetic effects. In his study of Artaud's theatre concepts, Eric Sellin makes a salient observation that The basic hieroglyph or ideogram for the actor lies in the mask, the gestures, and the voice, which is to be used as an extension of the mask, conserving a monotonous continuity in keeping with the character. The subtle variations on the underlying theme or character should be achieved not by facial tics but with the variegations of the ideogram itself (1975: 62). When Stanislavski formulated the principles of his famous "system," he was synthesizing, perpetuating in theory and in practice, the funda- mental, psycho-theatrical principles that most inform and animate the mask idiom. The Magic If which forms the basis of the Stanislavski "sy- stem" is an important "key" to a further under- standing of the mask theory-in-practice, especial- ly as it relates to acting. Stanislavski found in the "magic if" his principal key to characterization, as well as to the "creative impulse" for truth and the "ruling idea" of the drama. The "magic if" is one of the principal tools with which the actor identifies himself with his role. It "acts like a lever to lift us out of the world of actuality into the realm of imagination" (Stanislavski 1979: 43, also 1977: 19 and 167). It has a profound liberating effect, in the sense that the //liberates the actor's imagination from a debilitating sense of sham, stimulates and transports that imagination it liberates. The masked performer, like Stanislav- ski's actor, needs the "magic if" in order to attain that state of "mystical eminence" which makes absolute freedom possible. Close comparisons could be made between some of the views expressed by Stanislavski, Baisch, Cole, and Soyinka. The "realm of imagi- nation" (Stanislavski), for example, is synony- mous with the "realm of myth and archetype" (Baisch), the "illud tempus" (Cole), and the "chthonic realm" (Soyinka). It is also synony- mous with what Obiechina (1975: 61-62) has described as the "area of artistic upheaval" - the "domain" of the most profound artistic and metaphysical experiences. Also, and by close correspondence, Stanislavski's "lever" accords with Benedetti's "mechanism . . . designed to project ["to lift," according to Stanislavski] a sense of the self." Similarly, Stanislavski's "magic Anthropos 79. 1984</page><page sequence="7">Mask and Masking 7 if" concurs with Baisch's germane conclusion that the mask is a "key" to understanding the complex and intricate principles or processes of characteri- zation, and of the actor's complete identification of himself with his role (Baisch 1977: 2). There- fore, the unmasked actor who possesses the "magic if" is very much akin to his masked counterpart: both of them possess, at least, the "creative state of mind" which makes artistic creation and fulfilment possible, and enables the role-players to journey into the "psychic inter- ior" of their roles. This state, which David Cole defines as ''the rounding," makes the theatre an event. It is "the defining characteristic of theatri- cal performance." And, it is during this "moment of the rounding that the theatre, as an event, is born" (Cole 1975: 15). Bertolt Brecht was equally conscious of the iconology of the mask. He was cognizant of the fact that the mask is a viable, potent theatrical means and device or "mechanism" for the attain- ment of "alienation" effects, and for the represen- tation of "the truth." In the theatre, he writes, reality can be represented in a factual or a fantastic form. The actors can do without (or with a minimum of) make-up, appearing "natural," and the whole thing can be a fake; they can wear grotesque masks and represent the truth (Brecht 1964: 110). Brecht knew that using masks to attain the effect of "alienation," as well as to represent universal truths, is a theatrical technique which owes "more, not less, to hypnotic suggestion than do those by which empathy is [usually] achieved" (1964: 192). The "hypnotic suggestion" spoken of by Brecht alludes to Soyinka's theory of symbolic preparation by the actor before donning the mask. The content and matter of this idea derive from the many beliefs and forces that surround the mask, namely the cosmological, the psychologi- cal, the physical, and the metaphysical. Brecht's conclusion that the technique is fundamentally one of "hypnotic suggestion" (symbolic prepara- tion) does not only tally with the opinion of, say, Copeau, Stanislavski, Cole, and Soyinka, but remains conclusively legitimate and viable. There is no doubt, however, that the use of masks by the different cultures for symbolic representations of universal truths is dated. Sym- bolism itself is an iconic and universally recogni- zed language (and device) for representing (or portraying) universal truths, as well as for the attainment of sublime effects which could be of harmony or alienation. Like symbolism, a mask is a codified language with an infinite range of associations and meanings, some of which may be simple and straightforward, complex and obscure, or strangely paradoxical. This array of meanings, together with its other metaphysical associations, is what gives the masks idiom its sustaining power, makes it the lingua franca of the theatre, and establishes it as a principal device for charac- terization and for exploring the internal and external dynamics of the changes both in man and phenomena. In his study of traditional African masks and aesthetic principles, Stanley Macebuh similarly observes that since the life of contemplation was part of [man's] natural bent, the artist could hardly have failed to observe the numerous incongruities and contradictions in human experience, and he was occasionally called upon also to record this in his art. Whatsoever else of meaning the masks and those horrendous figures of gods may have, there is no doubt that asymmetrical and disproportio- nately-sized sculpture [mask] also sought to remind man of his vanity and viciousness . . . ugliness . . . can at times serve the function of the sublime, precisely because it is employed often as a means of duplicating the deformity of human behaviour (1974: 17). This paradoxical ineluctability of the mask idiom, its dual and multiple functions and appli- cations, is what we have described elsewhere as the aesthetics of ugliness (Ebong 1976: 23). Brecht was probably aware of this principle, for he employed it in his creative art. He was conscious of the fact that ugliness has a dual and multi- theatrical effect, as well as the capacity for sublime, salutary, and alienation effects. He belie- ved, for example, that through the distortions inherent in the mask, the actor was more readily able to make manifest the unexpected effects (to "unearth cosmic uncertainties," according to Soyinka) which invariably alienate the audience from his experience (Brecht 1964: 91 and 93). W.B.Yeats and Eugene O'Neill were also cognizant of the universal application of the mask for the symbolic representation of the truth about man and his psycho-physical universe. They imagined the mask to embody vital statements about man's duality and his ever-changing univer- se. In a production of On Bailees Stand by W.B.Yeats, Gordon Craig conceived and brilli- Anthropos 79. 1984</page><page sequence="8">8 Inih A. Ebong antly executed the design of the mask of the Blind Man to reflect apropos the playwright's awareness of the fact that "the advantage of a mask over a face" is not only to "conceal" or "disguise" the face, since the mask "is always repeating un- erringly the poetic fancy" (Leeper 1948: 46). The "poetic fancy" obviously relates to the world of myth and archetype from which the sublime aesthetics of the mask derives. Similarly, a 1926 production in New York of O'Neill's The Great God Brown witnessed the "formalistic" use of masks "to symbolize modern man's dual persona- lity" and the "changes" in his "internal and external" composition (Gassner 1956: 25; see also Encyclopaedia Britannica 3/II: 586). The forma- listic structure permits the audience to see beyond the encrustations of modern man's spatial dimen- sions, and into the penetralia of his values and fantasies. The formalistic style is an obvious technique for double-casting the actor-as-charac- ter, in order to reflect or portray the changes and the evanescence of his cosmo-human composi- tion, also his socio- and psycho-biological consti- tution. Soyinka is a contemporary example of the "formalistic" use of masks for profound theatrical comments and effects. But, unlike his predeces- sors and contemporaries, Soyinka introduces into his formalistic use of the mask an intensely patterned ritualistic complexity of form, content, structure and context, with the result that he creates a prismatic, even polysemous, complexity of effects on his audience. His characters are not merely double-cast, but multi-dimensional; they do not merely "present a double image" of man and his universe because "they are possessed of more than earthly wisdom," as Eldred Jones concludes of the characters in A Dance of the Forests? but they present multiple and diverse images of man in his paradoxically changing, yet recurrently static, universe and values. Evidently, and when under the stress and control of the charismatic influence of the mask, the characters' voices no longer become their own because their voices have now acquired or attained "a more than human authority" (see Note 3) to authenti- cally comment on the nature of man. Soyinka himself points to this fact in his theatrical deploy- ment of the mask idiom in his other plays (notably The Road), and by his conviction that the mask derives its origin, functions, and powers from the archtypal essences whose language derives not from the plane of physical reality or ancestral memory . . . but from the numinous territory of transition from which the artist obtains fleeting glimpses by ritual, sacrifice and a patient submission or rational awareness to the moment when fingers and voices relate the symbolic language of the cosmos (Soyinka 1976: 155). 4. Masking and Acting All accounts and theories relating to the mask and its theatrical adaptability and importance are so far unanimous about its fundamental character- istics and essential attributes, whether the mask is anthropomorphic or, like the masks used in most of Grotowski's work and experiments, therio- morphic. Since global consensus has not only encapsulated the innate metaphysical, psycholog- ical, and symbolic powers and attributes of the mask, but has also directly and indirectly influen- ced most theories about acting (such as those of Stanislavski, Grotowski, and Brecht), it is essenti- al to more closely examine how the (unmasked) actor-as-character-in-performance relates to, and derives from, his masked counterpart, and the degree to which they differ. Figuratively, acting could be simply classified and defined as masking; an act or process of symbolically putting on a mask. Acting, like wearing a mask, compels an actor to assume personalities and consciousness other than his own. Both processes are an orientation in the process of impersonation, a personality-in-personalities approach towards the comprehension of man. The argument persists that the theatre as an event "exists to challenge" (Cole 1975: 13), even shock, awareness through representational acting and symbolism, both of which require some form of organic movements (Grotowski 1968: 194) in all the visual, auditory, and imaginative elements that compose and surround drama. The actor, with the aid of the psycho-physical powers of his medium, must create, establish, and command a moving and dynamic presence which, in itself, 3 Jones 1973; also recently directed for Calabar Univer- sity Theatre, Soyinka' s A Dance of the Forests, with a cast of about 250 students. Anthropos 79. 1984</page><page sequence="9">Mask and Masking 9 constitutes the nerve centre or dynamo of the theatrical event (1968: 175). The response of the audience to this dynamic presence must (for the proper theatrical effect to be achieved and expe- rience gained) be "grounded in awareness of the power and process of the actor, a sense of what he is doing and what he is" (Goldman 1975: 6). This is because the actor, like his maskevd counterpart, "exists to challenge/' threaten, and shock compla- cent dispositions and illusions by directing his vital energies, and those of his role, towards the audience. He must, according to Michael Gold- man (1975: 7), create that "fear or strangeness or terribilità which enters into [his] power over the audience." If he is adept in his role-playing, and this the audience must not just feel but intimately experience, there is bound to be something unusual and riveting about the actor-as-character ... a compelling strange- ness about him, the presence ... of that strange ener- gy ... the energy which is other-than-mimetic ... the energy which defines the actor's art... "terrific" energy... awesome and fearful... both exciting and terrible . . . (ibid.). This "terrific," "awesome," "fearful," "ter- rible," yet "exciting" energy which defines the actor's art, the energy in which the actor is absorbed, and which he absorbs and exhibits, is no less different from the "godlike," "spiritual," "demonic" attributes and power which define and characterize the mask idiom, and which the masked actor also absorbs and exhibits. The essential difference between both actors may be perceived only in terms of the degree of the overall effect and impact their respective energies have on the audience. Although both actors may have, as their common objective and goal, the task of representing universal truths, there is reason to believe that the masked actor could more readily attain a much more visceral level of possession than his unmasked counterpart; the degree of which could be determined by its corresponding effects on the audience. The state of possession or "mystical eminen- ce" is the alchemical, masonic union of flesh with divinity and, this, according to Gassner (1956: 168), "could distance [Brecht's "alienation"], elevate [Macebuh's sublimation], and dignify [Stanislavski's freedom of the creative imagination from a debilitating sense of sham] dramatic experience, freeing it from the temporality and flux of realistic theatre." In stage dramatization, the actor usually finds himself in an intense participation-response process towards an achie- vement, an objective, a goal - the spatial definition of being in phenomena and the representation of truth. One could therefore say of acting (and the actor), as it has often been said of the mask (and its wearer), that it (acting) is "an instrument of participation and achievement" (McLuhan and Parker 1962: 153); that it "acts as a form of compensation" (Cole 1975: 46); and, since it is "a part of man's attempt to solve the mystery of his own identity" (Baisch 1977: 8), acting endows the actor with a "double consciousness" (Cole 1975: 43). Margaret Mead has carefully examined a propos, that during the process of acting and role-playing, man becomes a spectator of his own fears and hopes, embodied in grotesque or lovely forms, and in turn those fears and hopes become more manageable or more meaningful, but always more highly patterned (1940: 285). At this moment, the actor's self-consciousness is "held in abeyance"; becomes "suspended" as he increasingly becomes "subservient" to the creati- ve will and intelligence of his role; and, he is able to more than ever "perform with a skill greater than his own" (Laurence 1968: 15). The experience of acting is highly intense and strange, even perplexing, yet exciting, in the sense that acting presents or creates strange, paradoxical feelings both for the actor and the audience - feelings and experiences which originate more from symbolic and metaphysical associations than from physical trappings or details of the actor and his stage. In his brilliant study of the actor's freedom, Michael Goldman very accurately records that there is a kind of uncanniness about acting, akin to the uncanniness of the mask - a mingling of the animate and the inanimate, a projection of human energy beyond normal bounds, as in mediumship or ventriloquism (1975: 9). Therefore, since "acting ... is always . . . the sub- ject of the play" (1975: 92), and "every role possesses ... a rigid, inanimate, mask-like quali- ty" (49), the actor, in any role or part he plays, "must be changing masks from moment to moment"(93). This must be understood to mean Anthropos 79. 1984</page><page sequence="10">10 Inih A. Ebong the intricate and complex oscillating process of makebelieve, of pretending to be ("imitation" of), and at the same time being what one is not, yet really is. For, by figuratively or symbolically donning his "mask," the actor, like his masked counterpart, establishes before us a particularly interesting and energetic human being, who is not simply the actor and not properly the character, but the actor-as-character, to whom we relate in a special way (6). This "special" actor-audience configuration and response is the complex psycho-physical experience and feeling of ecstasy and strangeness, the terribilità, the alarm-excitement, attraction- repulsion, empathy-alienation experience and res- ponse, which makes the theatre an event. And, if the actor is an adept role-player, the inviolate hermetic irradiations of his role-as-character will certainly give a sense of, as well as make one feel and intimately experience, the presence of some profound energy that goes beyond and transcends the mere temporal demonstrations of what some real person is like (5). The certitude of this is encapsulated in the fact that the "actor-as- character" is an embodiment of the "double impulse" of the dramatic and theatrical art; that is, the ecstasy of power over others and the ecstasy of self-surrender ... its presence always shapes the audien- ce's expectations. The actor-as-character is a godlike figure who in some senses defies the gods, becomes more vulnerable to them (15). Speech is one of the actor's most important tools for profound and effective theatrical com- munication. In fact, one would be right to say that speech is to acting what wings are to a bird. Its importance to acting and the theatre, however, needs no detailed elaboration here, except to posit that speech (dramatic dialogue and monologue) and the mask idiom are intimately homologous, adaxial, and complementary. Speech, like the mask, creates a variety of visual ad hominem images which derive from the metaphysical chthonic world of myth and archetype. These images have their roots in the visceral domains of the human mind. It is, therefore, not surprising that Eric Sellin (1975: 61-64) enthusiastically accepted the mask idiom as, perhaps, the most veritable language that is not only native but belongs strictly to the theatre than the everyday language that is commonly used in the theatre today. While there are fundamental bases for truth in Sellin's point of view, it is equally important to understand that speech or dramatic dialogue, as a masking device, conveys intensive dramatic ideas through the elements of visual and aural theatri- cality; through the variations and unexpected possibilities inherent in the improvisation; and, through a medium of improvised words that may or may not employ the interchanges of dialogue. In its relationship with the mask, Ruesch and Kees (1956: 93) have, in fact, observed that speech sets up "chords of tactile images that often produce sharp and immediate physical and emotional reactions." And, Michael Goldman more exquis- itely considers speech as a rapidly changing mask with which the actor attains his freedom to affect the audience. He states very clearly that Speech in particular, because of its nobility, its density of impressions, should always be thought of as a disguise [mask] - a disguise that slips, reveals, changes, strains to be adequate, strains even to be true or transparent to what it describes, breaks away, breaks down, stiffens, must be bolstered up. It is the fastest- changing mask of all (Goldman 1975: 93). 5. Conclusion Much is yet to be discovered about mask, its aesthetic profundity, and its true and proper relationship and significance to acting, the actor, and the theatre. The evidence before us has not only proved its importance and indispensability to the theatre, but has gone as far as to suggest that the mask idiom offers infinite theatrical possibili- ties to the practitioner who most profoundly understands its language. For example, the idiom or concept of mask, when adapted for acting as it is applied to masking per se&gt; could precipitate within a performance a diversity of pre-emptive subtexts, unusual patterns of movements, even in design and costume, and could suggest other possibilities for lighting and effects; all of which aim at a more perfect synchronization of all the creative and artistic elements of the production in order to achieve the highest possible spectacle. Such an adaptation will give to the performance an important and unusual spark of vitality, and will make the actor come alive by his poses, gestures, Anthropos 79. 1984</page><page sequence="11">Mask and Masking 1 1 and movements, and by the power of the radiation of the light flashing from his own eyes. Evidently, masking and acting are adaxial constructs, both of which must be seen as complementary principles operating on the same, but somewhat different planes. There, however, remains at all times some important and universal, even if sub-rosa, associ- ations between the mask, its wearer, acting, and the actor. Abstract. - The paper is a general survey of the universal characteristics , attributes, and theatricality of the mask phenomenon, with examples from Africa, America, Europe, and the Far East. On the premise that the mask is an all-purpose charismatic device, imbued with physical, psycho- logical, and metaphysical attributes, the paper argues that the mask is a multi-symbolic and antithetical mechanism for astounding theatrical effects, such as the serious and the farcical, the comic, tragic, and the humorous, the exotic and the commonplace, the metaphysical and the mundane, the picturesque and the bizarre, etc.; or the antithetical effects of alarm-excitement, attraction-repulsion, empathy-alienation, etc. The argument develops through a brief overview of the masking tradition from pre-Greek, Medieval, Commedia deWarte, and the Court Masques theatres to the modern theatre; thereby showing how the tradition has affected or influenced major theatre practitioners and their theatre concepts, such as Copeau, Brecht, Soyinka, Grotowski, Artaud, Stanislavski, etc. It draws a parallel, for instance, between Stanislavskys magic if and the mask idiom as an important theatrical key to characterization and the actor's complete identification of himself with his role. It also argues that Brecht used the principles of the mask idiom to achieve his "alienation" effects. - On the basis of W.B. Yeats's On Baile's Stand and O'Neill's The Great God Brown, the paper illustrates how the mask idiom could be used to create the poetic fancy, man's dual personality, and the changes in man's internal and external composition. It further illustrates with the example of Soyinka's A Dance of the Forests how the formalistic use of the mask could become intensely patterned with ritualistic complexity of form, content, structure, and context, such that the drama creates a prismatic complexity of effects on an audience. Even though masking and acting are fundamentally different, they are, nevertheless, essentially the same and complementary - both are role-playing and an embodiment of the double and multiple impulses of the dramatic and theatrical art. The only difference between masking and acting is to be found in the depth of impact each makes on an audience. In addition to acting, the paper also makes a distinction between speech and masking, thus coming to the conclusion that speech is probably the greatest mask of all in the theatre. The study concludes with the awareness that in spite of its extensive universal usage, much is yet to be discovered about the mask, its aesthetic profundity, and its true and proper relationship and significance to acting, the actor, and the theatre.
