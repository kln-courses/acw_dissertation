<plain_text><page sequence="1">Gabrielle Maryse Rochecouste, The Role of Parallel Catamorphic Systems in the Structure of Zola's „Rougon-Macquart" (Romanistische Texte und Studien, 2). - Hildesheim, Zürich, New York: Georg Olms Verlag, 1988, 275 S. Dr. Rochecouste's book seeks to show the continuity of what she calls catamorphic vision in the Rougon-Macquart. The adjective "catamorphic" and the substantive "catamorphism" are her neologisms in semantic correspondence with the concepts of la chute. Her argument is that the "work is centered around notions of the Fall, of falling, crumbling, decaying, with all the associated manipulation of systems of descent and ascent" (13). These themes are realized through "icons". As used by Dr. Rochecouste the word 'icon' has its "generally accepted literary sense" and means the "verbal equivalents" of „concrete visual representations" (21). Her book studies a wide range of linguistic forms showing orders of perception of which a notion of literal or figurative movement downwards is part of the semantics. In the Zolian text isomorphisms, that is to say icons belonging to the same isotopy, construct systems of paradigmatic and syntagmatic relationships. The category of paradigmatic relation- ship is a broad one and it includes métonymie, metaphoric and symbolic links. Syntagmatic relationships are those structured by the "sequence of the text" (16). As they cluster and unfold their multiple relationships, the icons belonging to the catamor- phic isotopies are subjected to processes of "valorization" and "devalorization" (25): valorization Ztschr. f. frz.

Their resulting ambiguity as signs is the ultimate stage of Zola's realization of the catamorphic theme. At the outset of Le ventre de Paris, for instance, Paris presents itself as an oasis and the ascent towards it up a slope from Courbevoie is an advance to success: gradually, however, the metropolis takes on the identities of a labyrinth and moloch. Chapters successively consider Le Ventre de Paris, Une Page d'Amour, Au Bonheur des Dames and Le Docteur Pascal. In Le Ventre de Paris catamorphic isomorphisms serve a theme of Parisian moral and social breakdown. The extracts closely read in this novel are a description in the first chapter of an approach to Paris from the west, and then two of Les Halles in afternoon and at night respectively. These analyses demonstrate for the first time the author's ability - sustained in further commentaries - to explore skilfully the analogical density of the Zolian text and especially the constant metaphorization of space. When she reads Une page d'amour Dr. Rochecouste finds that "major paradigms" (72) realizing a catamorphic theme are present from the outset in evocations of Hélène's sleep or Jeanne's epilepsy which she judges to be symbolic of death. Her analysis of descriptions of the interior of the appartment in Passy and the perspective of Paris from it is developed in a complex schema associating modes of perception; the interior, the window and Paris as actants; concrete signifiers and their signifieds; and linguistic signs and their "significations" - their symbolic values (87). Subsequently she reads across a similar grill two descriptions of the stairway le passage des eaux which in the novel links Passy and Paris (101). The palette of modes of perception: anamorphic, uranian, chtonian, proxemic, kinetic, static etc. is a measure of the complexity of the textual effects uncovered. In this schema and in later ones Dr. Rochecouste's attention to the multiple figurative effects of vocabulary is exemplary. Her complicated dia- grammatic mapping of "convergence of signifieds" and "opposition of signifieds", however, seems visually obscure and too subtle. In the case of Au bonheur des dames Dr. Rochecouste notes that her postulation of a "catamorphic insight" in the novel conflicts with an established critical assessment of it as a work determined by "the author's optimism". After a "misleading first impression" (114) of themes of enthusiasm for progress and modernism, she discovers an abundance of catamorphic icons signifying the immorality and ogrish appetite of the new forms of commerce. A very comprehensive analysis of contrasting descriptions of the archaic establishment Au vieil Elbeuf and the recently constructed new department store, associates the two premises and their denizens as actants, twenty modes of perception, and an even larger number of signifieds and significations, these latter being generically subsumed into the notions of disaster and success. Within the confines of the huge department store, reifying, anthropomorphic, sexual, religious and theriomorphic icons suggest manipulation of clients, temptation, ogrish appetite and sacrifi- ce. For Dr. Rochecouste Le docteur Pascal does not represent a departure from catamorphic "obsession" (233) and the novel is a "microcosm" (234) of the Les Rougon-Macquart. Dr. Rochecouste's study of style takes the form of commentaries of four passages which are chosen from L'Argent, L'Œuvre, La Curée, and Son Excellence Eugène Rougon. She acknowled- ges that her method "is not conducive to objectivity" (219) and one is inclined to concur with this avowal. A number of her observations and arguments merit questioning. These include the notions that there is a stressing, a slowing down and a speeding up of the rhythm of the sentence Un silence effrayant régna, lorsque, après le coup de cloche de la clôture, le dernier cours de 850 francs fut connu occasioned respectively by consonants, monosyllables, and one polysyllable huit cent cinquante (176); that a "heavy bludgeoning effect" is produced by abstract substantives ending in - ment (178); the final è and ait sounds "sustain the hammering effect that emphasi- zes the terror of mass hysteria"; that "smoothly sliding liquid / and s consonants" reflect "a powerful driving force" (182) or that "Claude's crippling impotence is particularly emphasized"</page><page sequence="3">330 Besprechungen in the coupling of semantic and phonetic elements in pu être prêt pour (189). Among other arguments which invite query are ones relating to rhythm and "grammatical iconicity" (194) in a sentence and a recurring judgement that certain tautologies and hyperboles "emphasize the message conveyed" (206). Dr. Rochecouste's volume has other shortcomings. There is little argumentative relationship between her various chapters. While each of them shows the workings of the catamorphic theme within individual novels, none of them is given a conclusion which would link its analysis to wider aesthetic perspectives. Successive chapters tend also to reproduce an familiar pattern of investigation rather than using established positions as the basis of a deeper examina- tion of further dimensions of the organizing myth of Les Rougon-Macquart. At the same time author of The Role of Parallel Catamorphic Systems is a perspicacious reader of the Zolian text. Her identifications of clusters of paradigmatically related elements and of series of metaphors nurturing the catamorphic symbolism are as sensitive as they are thorough. Her faultless examination of the plasticity of this language and of the dense network of figurative relation- ships which it sustains is a solid contribution to criticism of Les Rougon-Macquart. The relentlessly pursued spatialization of discourse which Dr. Rochecouste's volume shows so well is an aesthetic choice that links the cycle to the fiction of Flaubert. This formal continuity underlying the well chronicled contrasts between the two authors' theories is something to be borne in mind when one approaches the problem of describing Realism in the nineteenth century French novel.
