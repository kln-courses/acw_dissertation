XVIII</page><page sequence="15">PART I: BACKGROUND</page><page sequence="16">CHAPTER 1 INTRODUCTION Yosef Garfinkel The research of the eighth millennium BP (uncalibrated)* in the southern Levant poses several fundamental problems. After Kathleen Kenyon's excavations at Jericho in the 1950s, a settlement hiatus was believed to exist during this time span. Thus, following the early part of the Neolithic period, that is the Pre-Pottery Neolithic A (hereafter PPNA) and the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B (hereafter PPNB), there was a gap in the settlement history of the southern Levant until the appearance of the first Pottery Neolithic (hereafter PN) cultures of the Yarmukian and Jericho IX. Only during the excavations of Gary Rollefson at 'Ain Ghazal in the 1980s did it become clear that there was no hiatus in some sites. Thus, a new term, Pre-Pottery Neolithic C (hereafter PPNC), was introduced. In recent decades several other PPNC sites have been excavated. These include the site presented in this volume, as well as Wadi Shu'eib, 4 Ain al-Jammam, Tel 'Ali, ' Atlit Yam, Hagoshrim, and recently Sha'ar Hagolan (Fig. 1). Radiometric dating enables us to pinpoint the chronological span of the PPNC to the first half of the eighth millennium BP. While the chronological framework is more or less clear, other aspects of this period still await detailed discussion. The material culture, subsistence strategies, and social organization of the PPNC are not well defined. Very little can be said about the settlement pattern and regional differences between sites in this period, or about the nature of the transition from the earlier PPNB, whether due to collapse or simply to cultural * All dates mentioned in this volume are BP (before present) uncalibrated, unless otherwise noted. change. The relationship with later PN cultures also needs clarification. This lack of definition is due to the small number of sites excavated to date, the small area unearthed in most of them, and the lack of final detailed excavation reports. We are only at the beginning of the long process of filling the PPNC with content. This report aims to provide, for the first time, a detailed account of a PPNC site. Two factors give the site unique importance. Firstly, a large horizontal exposure of about eight hundred square meters was achieved. Secondly, Ashkelon is essentially a single-period settlement, and consequently no mixture with earlier PPNB or later PN finds can have occurred. The extensive excavated area yielded a large sample of flint items, enabling a comprehensive analysis of the industry's technology and typology. The large amount of mammal bones provides most of the data on subsistence, and sheds light on the beginning of pastoral societies in the Near East. The assemblage of fish bones points to the beginning of intensive exploitation of marine resources. Human remains attest to mortuary practices. Exotic and other imported items indicate long-distance exchange networks. Altogether, the excavation of Ashkelon has brought to light a vivid picture of a PPNC community that lived on the Mediterranean coast some nine thousand years ago (Photos 1-3). 1.1. THE SITE AND ITS ENVIRONMENT The name Ashkelon is derived from the cities that flourished in the second and first millennia BCE in the southern part of the Israeli Mediterranean 3</page><page sequence="17">CHAPTER ONE Fig. 1. Sites mentioned in the text. 4</page><page sequence="18">INTRODUCTION Photo 1. General view of the site in 1997, looking northwest. coast (Stager 1993). Today a modern city with ca. 100,000 inhabitants bears the same name. The Neolithic site is located in the Afridar neighborhood within the modern city of Ashkelon. About 1 .5 km to the south is Tel Ashkelon, where a large Early Bronze Age site has been extensively excavated over the years (Gal 2004). The Israeli coastal plain is a strip 20 km wide and running north-south, bordered on the east by the Judea and Samaria foothills. The shore is sandy and lacks inlets. The western part of the plain is covered with sand, connecting directly with the sand dunes of the northern Sinai desert. The maximal width of the sand strip is 7 km. Several sandstone ( kurkar ) ridges run along the coastal plain. These are the remains of ancient petrified dunes, representing various higher Pleistocene sea levels. The eastern part of the plain is covered with alluvium, usually the fertile hamra soil. The southern plain is drained by four major streams: Sorek, Lachish, Shikma, and Besor. The slope of the streams is sharper in the mountainous area of the central ridge to the east and fairly mild in the coastal plain itself (about 0.5%). The mild Photo 2.

General view of the site in 1998, looking east. slope continues under water until the end of the continental shelf, about 20 km from the current coastline. The coastal plain of Israel receives a fair amount of annual precipitation on a descending gradient from north to south and is considered part of the Mediterranean vegetational zone. The Ashkelon area, which lies at its southern end, receives 437 mm of annual precipitation, mostly in the winter, with 30-40 annual rainy days (Bitan and Rubin 1991). This places the site in the steppic vegetational zone, which lies between the Mediterranean to the north and the desert region to the south. The climate is temperate: the mean annual temperature is 19-21°, with the mean maximum varying from 12-14° in January to 26-28° in August. The daily temperature amplitude is about 8-10°. The area enjoys 120-160 dew nights, mostly in the spring/summer. The temperature difference between land and sea results in westerly/southwesterly winds during the day and easterly winds during the night. Further discussion of the climatic conditions can be found in the chapter on the Testudines remains (below, Chapter 16). The vegetation is typical of sandy zones, with some Mediterranean-type hatha/ garrigue areas and some Irano-Turanian vegetation. The site is located on the western coastal kurkar ridge about 200 m from the current coastline and about 13 m above current sea level. During the PPNC the sea level was about 9 m lower (Galili et al. 1993), resulting in an addition of about 650 m to the width of the coastal plain. The location on top of a ridge enabled a good view over and control of the adjacent landscape, since it is higher than the flat dunes area. A second advantage is the shelter from winds provided by the ridge. No permanent water resource, such as a river or spring, is known today in the immediate vicinity of the site. However, the kurkar ridges block the outlet of streams to the sea, creating a swampy area to their east that can serve as a source of water. Such swamps were known at Hadera and Ruhama, where they were drained only in the twentieth century by pioneer Zionists. Moreover, the recovery of at least seven 6</page><page sequence="20">INTRODUCTION bones of the freshwater turtle Mauremys caspica in the excavations (see below, Chapter 16) attests to the presence of fresh water in the vicinity. We should also bear in mind that three Neolithic wells are known on eastern Mediterranean shores. Two, dated to the PPNB, were found at Kissonerga- Mylouthkia in Cyprus (Peltenburg et al. 2000) and another, dated to the PPNC, at ' Atlit Yam (Galili et al. 1993). It is possible that a similar well supplied water at Ashkelon. The location of PPNC Ashkelon on the southern Israeli coastal plain is of special interest for the settlement history of the region. On a long time scale, a three-stage pattern is evident here: a There are numerous Epi-Paleolithic sites in the southern coastal plain (Burian and Friedman 1965; Bar Yosef 1970a; 1970b; Barkai et al. 1995). These indicate extensive exploitation of the area by hunter-gatherers from 20,000 to 12,000 BP. b With the beginning of sedentism in the Natufian, PPNA, and PPNB, the coastal plain was almost completely abandoned. Large Natufian campsites or Neolithic villages, such as Jericho, Netiv Hagdud, Hatula, Yiftahel, Munhata, and Beisamun, are known in the Jordan Valley and the central mountain ridge. In the Negev, Transjordan, and Sinai, well-built seasonal camps, such as Nahal Issaron, Dhuweila, Wadi Tbeiq, and Wadi Jubba, have been found. In the coastal plain, on the other hand, only a few instances of sparse early Neolithic presence are documented (Burian and Friedman 1965; Gopher et al. 1998). This was a marginal territory in the southern Levant and essentially underwent a long settlement gap (Noy 1977; Gopher 1993). c The PPNC marks the beginning of flourishing settlement in the region. The built village of 'Atlit Yam and the site of Ashkelon clearly indicate the growing importance of the coastal plain. In the following PN, the southern coastal plain was intensively exploited, as indicated by the sites of Giv'at Haparsa, Nizzanim, and Ziqim (Olami et al. 1977; Yeivin and Olami 1979; Garfinkel et al. 2002). Later, there were Qatifian sites in this territory (Epstein 1984; Gilead 1990). In this context, Ashkelon is a cornerstone in the understanding of the resettlement of the southern coastal plain. The conquest of a new ecological zone is often a fascinating process. What was it that prevented early Neolithic occupation in the southern coastal plain? What enabled the inhabitants of Ashkelon to venture during the PPNC into a hitherto unsettled area? 1.2. PERROT'S EXCAVATIONS The Neolithic site of Ashkelon was first surveyed and excavated by the pioneering work of Jean Perrot in the mid-1950s, published in a brief preliminary report (Perrot 1955) and in a final report over forty years later (Perrot and Gopher 1996). In the 1950s the area of the site had not yet suffered from massive development and the survey encountered the more or less virgin landscape. This survey yielded a scatter of finds in several areas, altogether encompassing some 2 hectares (Fig. 2). At the time the modern city of Ashkelon was much smaller and the site's original topography was still intact. Since then, and mostly in the 1990s, massive development works have been carried out, altering the topography completely and destroying most of the Neolithic site. Perrot's survey is the only indication of the original landscape of Neolithic Ashkelon. Perrot excavated in one location, at the top of the kurkar ridge, where the surface was rich in finds. Some 100 m2 were opened and features of three different types were reported (Figs. 3^1; Photos 4-7): 1 Eight dwelling pits, circular or oval, 1 .5-3 m in diameter and up to 0.9 m deep. 2 Five bell-shaped silo pits, with an opening 0.5-0.6 m in diameter and maximum diameter of 1.5 m, and an average depth of 0.9 m. 3 Four shallow basins, up to 1 m in diameter and up to 0.5 m deep. No occupational debris or living surfaces were found between the pits, an indication in 7</page><page sequence="21">CHAPTER ONE Fig. 2.

The location of the area excavated by Perrot has been forgotten over the years and during the 1990s it was completely demolished. The material culture associated with the features included flint items, animal bones, seashells, stone and bone tools, and obsidian, but no pottery was found. Based on the presence of coarsely denticulated sickle blades, the site was defined as "Yarmukian without pottery", and thus dated to the second half of the eighth millennium BP. However, after the new excavations with a reliable series of radiocarbon dates, this definition should be revised. Neolithic Ashkelon is clearly a PPNC site, dated to the first half of the eighth millennium BP (Table 1). 1.3.

The project was headed by Yosef Garfinkel on behalf of the Institute of Archaeology of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. For two weeks in the 1998 season Angela Davidzon directed the fieldwork. The expedition's surveyor was J. Rosenberg. The staff in 1997 included two students from the Hebrew University: Avi Krauz and Dalit Weinblatt-Krauz. The staff in 1998 included seven students from the Hebrew University: Anna Eirikh- Rose, Zinovi Matskevich, Yoni Mizrahi, Angela Davidzon, Doron Dag, Vered Barzel-Ben Haim, and Hila Debono. Unexpected help in excavation and surveying was received from Prudence M.C. Philips, a yacht owner resident at the marina who had archaeological training. The work was done carried out by about thirty paid laborers with some experience of excavating in other salvage projects. During the work they gained additional specific experience needed for the excavation of proto- historical sites. The excavations and the analysis of its finds were sponsored by the Ashkelon Economic Cooperation and were supported by the Muriel and Philip Berman Center for Biblical Archaeology of the Institute of Archaeology of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. The logistical management of the excavation, including digging equipment, manpower organization, vehicle rental etc., was conducted by Buki Boaz. Niv Avivi was responsible for daily administration and technical assistance. The field photographs were taken by Yosef Garfinkel, Buki Boaz, and the various expedition members. Studio photographs of most of the objects were taken by Buki Boaz and Gabi Laron; some additional zoological and anthropological finds were photographed by the scholars who analyzed them. The objects were drawn by various artists: the flint by Julia Moskovich, the stone artifacts by Daniel Ladiray, and the pottery by Mika Sarig. 13</page><page sequence="27">CHAPTER 2 THE CHRONOLOGY OF THE EIGHTH MILLENNIUM BP Yosef Garfinkel The basic sequence of the Neolithic period in the southern Levant was formulated by Kenyon following her extensive excavations at Jericho in the 1950s (1957; 1960; 1981). She suggested two pre- pottery phases, designated Pre-Pottery Neolithic A (PPNA) and Pre-Pottery Neolithic B (PPNB). These were followed by a settlement gap that lasted several centuries. Later, two successive pottery phases developed: the Pottery Neolithic A (PNA) and the Pottery Neolithic B (PNB). Kenyon's phasing of the earlier part of this sequence, the Pre-Pottery, was accepted during the 1960s through the 1980s without serious criticism (Perrot 1968; Bar- Yosef 1981a; Stager 1992). Jericho produced quite a large number of radiometric dates for the two earlier Neolithic settlements. Of about twenty dates for the PPNA (Burleigh 1981; 1983), most fall between 10,300 and 9200 BP. Of about twenty dates for the PPNB (Burleigh 1981; 1983), most fall between 9200 and 8200 BP. The two later Neolithic phases (PNA and PNB) at Jericho, however, produced no radiometric dates at all. This produced much speculation on the relative, as well as the absolute, chronology of the later sequence of the Neolithic period in the southern Levant (see discussions in Garfinkel 1999a; 1999b). In this chapter, 13 reliable radiometric determinations from three Neolithic sites (Ashkelon, Sha'ar Hagolan, and Tel 'Ali) are presented. This is a significant addition to the systematic dating of the eighth millennium BP in the southern Levant, clearly helping to solve some of the chronological problems of the period under discussion. 2.1. THE SITES AND THEIR DATES ASHKELON The Neolithic site of Ashkelon, the subject of this report, was first excavated by Jean Perrot in the mid-1950s (Perrot 1955). He concluded: "On a more general level, the site of Ashkelon should be assigned to the sensu lato Yarmukian" (Perrot and Gopher 1996: 166). Noy, on the other hand, assigned the site to the "Yavne Yam" phase, predating the Yarmukian (Noy 1977). It is important to note that neither Perrot's excavation nor the current one yielded any Neolithic pottery. The preservation of organic material at Neolithic Ashkelon was very poor. Since no lumps of charcoal were found at the site, six samples of black sediment that is rich in ash were submitted to the Oxford accelerator unit (one sample could not be processed). The results are shown in Table 2. Four of the five dates fall between 8000 and 7935 BP, and only one date is much younger, by nearly 350 years, at 7639 (for calibrated dates, see Fig. 5). This clearly indicates that the site should be dated in the early eighth millennium BP. TEL 'ALI This multi-layer site is located in the central Jordan Valley, only 1 km south of the Sea of Galilee. It was first excavated by Prausnitz in 1955-59 (Prausnitz 1 975). I conducted further excavations at Tel 'Ali in 1989-90 on behalf of the Institute of Archaeology of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem (Garfinkel 1993a). Layer 2, of which about 200 m2 were exposed, is characterized by pits and open areas. 15</page><page sequence="28">CHAPTER TWO Table 2. Radiometric dates from Ashkelon.

Calibration graph. Although no pottery was found, a few fragments of White Ware vessels were encountered. The flint assemblage is characterized by medium-sized arrowheads and sickle blades with broad, deep denticulation. A detailed account of this assemblage has been published (Garfinkel 1994). The preservation of organic material was very poor, and only tiny fragments of charcoal were found. Thus it was not possible to conduct botanical identification of the wood. Nine samples consisting of small lumps of charcoal from various layers at Tel 'Ali were submitted to the Oxford accelerator unit. The results of the four samples from Layer 2 are shown in Table 3. While the first two dates fall well within the expected chronological range of the period under discussion, supported by some twenty other dates (Table 6 below), the last two dates are clearly too young, Tel 'Ali 4 by some 2000 years and Tel 'Ali 3 by some 8000 years. The two reliable dates came from a pit, which is a relatively secure archaeological context. The other two came from open areas, lying only half a meter below the site's topsoil. It thus seems that charcoal samples 3 and 4 from Tel 'Ali are later intrusions into Layer 2. SHA' AR HAGOLAN This site is located in the central Jordan Valley, about 1.5 km southeast of the Sea of Galilee. It was first excavated by Moshe Stekelis in 1948-52 (Stekelis 1951; 1972).

Two periods of occupation were discerned in Areas E and G: PPNC and PN. The preservation of organic material is quite poor at Sha'ar Hagolan and only tiny fragments of charcoal were found. Thus it was not possible to conduct botanical identification of the wood. PPNC At the base of Area E about a meter of PPNC debris was found. While three samples from this location were sent for radiometric dating, all failed. In Area G only meager PPNC remains were found, including one pit (Loci 103 and 109); the rest are mixed with the later PN material. The radiometric dates obtained from Area G are shown in Table 4. PN (Yarmukian) It was at Sha'ar Hagolan that the Yarmukian culture was first identified, with its main characteristics of pottery decorated with incised herringbone pattern, small arrowheads, sickle blades with coarse denticulation, and a rich assemblage of art objects. Over the years almost twenty samples of small charcoal lumps were submitted for radiometric dating to the Oxford accelerator unit. The successfully obtained dates are shown in Table 5. ATLIT YAM ' Atlit Yam is a four-hectare Neolithic village site located in the coastal plain of Israel, currently 8-12 m below sea level (Galili 1987; Galili et al. 1993; 2002). Building activities included rectangular houses, long walls (fences?), megalithic stones, wells, rounded installations, and pits. Large assemblages of flint items, stone tools, animal bones, fish bones, botanical remains, and human burials were found. For this site, attributed to the PPNC, a series of radiometric dates has been obtained over the years (Galili et al. 2002: Table 1). The dates range from 8170±55 (the oldest) to 7250±45, with one exceptionally young date of Table 4. PPNC radiometric dates from Sha'ar Hagolan.

In accordance with the géomorphologie observations and the radiometric dates, it was suggested that: " ' Atlit Yam contains a habitation sequence from the very end of the ninth and the first half of the eighth millennia BP. The different phases of the site are scattered on the sea floor, creating a mosaic of horizontal stratigraphy, in which areas containing ancient relics (c. 8180 BP) were discovered beside areas with later finds (c. 7800 BP). The fill of the water-well belongs to the later phases of occupation (c. 7700-7550 BP). However, the wells were most probably constructed earlier" (Galili et al. 2002: 173-174). As can be seen, the chronological distribution of the radiometric dates is quite wide, including the second half of the eighth millennium as well. Altogether the dates spread over 900 uncalibrated years, from 8 1 70+55 to 7250±45 BP (excluding the anomalously young date). It seems quite possible that parts of the site were already occupied in the late PPNB, while other parts may have coexisted with the PN Yarmukian culture of the Jordan Valley. The earlier dates from the Yarmukian site of Sha'ar Hagolan are contemporaneous with the latest dates from 'Atlit Yam. This very long sequence is quite problematic, and raises questions as to the validity of relating all the material collected at the site to the PPNC. 2.2. DISCUSSION THE PPNC: THE "MISSING LINK" BETWEEN THE PPNB AND THE PN The first problem that one faces when dealing with the eighth millennium BP is the transition from the PPNB to the PN. The PPNB stage is one of the best- documented periods in the Neolithic of the Levant. It is known from dozens of sites and is radiometrically well dated (Bar-Yosef 1981a; Weinstein 1984; Kuijt and Bar-Yosef 1994). It apparently came to an end around 8 100 BP and did not continue into the eighth millennium BP. The first PN units, on the other hand, seem to have flourished in the second half of the eighth millennium BP (see below). One is confronted with the question of what occurred during some 600 years between the end of the PPNB and the beginning of the PN. Four suggestions to bridge the gap have been advanced: a Kenyon suggested a settlement gap of several centuries at the beginning of the eighth millennium BP between the end of the PPNB and the beginning of the PN (Kenyon 1960). b Perrot suggested a settlement gap throughout the entire eighth millennium BP, which he named the hiatus palestinien (Perrot 1969). c Stager, in the new edition of the Chronologies in Old World Archaeology, suggests that the PN directly followed the PPNB at the beginning of the eighth millennium BP, with no gap at all between them (Stager 1992). d Rollefson, following the excavations of 'Ain Ghazal, suggested that another cultural unit, hitherto unknown, fills the gap. He designates this unit "Pre-Pottery Neolithic C" (Rollefson 1989; Rollefson and Köhler-Rollefson 1993). In some publications a synonymous term, "Final PPNB", is used (Rollefson 1989: 69). This unit lies above the PPNB and below the Yarmukian of the PN period. Of these four proposals, it is quite clear nowadays that the suggestion of an additional pre-pottery Neolithic stage, the PPNC, bridging the gap between the end of the PPNB and the beginning of the PN solves the problem (Perrot 1993; Nissen 1993). Thus, the supposed gap in the settlement of the southern Levant was in fact a gap in our knowledge. PPNC sites have now been reported on both sides of the Jordan. On the east are 'Ain Ghazal (Rollefson 1989), Wadi Shu'eib (Simmons et al. 2001) and 'Ain al-Jamman (Wahib and Fino 1997), while on the west are Ashkelon, Layer 2 at Tel 'Ali (Garfinkel 1993a; 1994), 'Atlit Yam (Galili et al. 1993), Layer VI at Hagoshrim (Getzov 1999), and recently Sha'ar Hagolan (Garfinkel 2003). Table 6 presents the PPNC radiometric dates published to date in chronological order. This cultural unit seems to have lasted for some 600 radiocarbon years, ca. 8100-7500 BP.

Table 7 presents the Yarmukian radiometric dates published so far in chronological order. It seems quite clear that the Yarmukian flourished between ca. 7500 and 7000 BP. THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE YARMUKIAN AND JERICHO IX In Layer IX at Jericho, Neolithic pottery was recognized for the first time in the southern Levant (Garstang et al. 1935; 1936). This stage was later designated "Pottery Neolithic A" (Kenyon 1957; 1960). The shapes of the pottery vessels, as well as the flint items, are very similar to those of the Yarmukian. Nevertheless, a number of differences have been noted over the years: 1 At Jericho IX sites, the pottery is decorated with paint and burnish rather than with the typical Yarmukian incised herringbone pattern. However, some incised sherds of the latter type were reported from Jericho (see, for example, Kenyon and Holland 1982: Figs. 18:16; 32:7-10, 12; 33:5-7; 1983: Figs. 10:2, 4; 215:6-7). 2 At Jericho IX sites there are sickle blades with rectangular contour shaped by pressure retouch (Crowfoot-Payne 1983: Figs. 336-337). Sickle blades of this type were not found at Sha'ar Hagolan. However, such items have been reported at other Yarmukian sites: Munhata (Gopher 1989: 95, Fig. 40) and Nahal Qanah Cave (Gopher and Tsuk 1996: Fig. 3.17:2-3, 5-7, 10-11). Note also that Crowfoot-Payne, who published the PNA flint from Kenyon 's excavations at Jericho, called it "Yarmukian" (Crowfoot-Payne 1983: 706). 3 Jericho IX sites do not usually yield the art objects that are so common at Yarmukian sites (Garfinkel 1993b; 2004). However, a typical "cowrie-eye" Yarmukian clay figurine was recently discovered at the Jericho IX site of Lod (Yannai, personal communication). Various suggestions have been raised over the years 20</page><page sequence="33">THE CHRONOLOGY OF THE EIGHTH MILLENNIUM BP Table 8.

Of these diverse proposals, only two are still in vogue: 1 The Yarmukian and Jericho IX are contemporary. 2 Jericho IX postdates the Yarmukian. This is an interesting development, since at an earlier stage of research it was customary to place Jericho IX before the Yarmukian. Clear stratigraphie relationships between the two units have not yet been discovered, although nowadays the Yarmukian is known from some twenty sites and Jericho IX from ten sites. Hopefully, the debate will be resolved when sufficient radiometric dates from Jericho IX sites are obtained and compared with the Yarmukian dates presented here in Table 7. PN SITES IN THE SOUTHERN COASTAL PLAIN Finally, one should not overlook the few PN sites located in the southern coastal plain of Israel: Nizzanim (Yeivin and Olami 1979), Giv'at Haparsa (Burian and Friedman 1961; Olami et al. 1977) and Ziqim (Noy 1993; Garfinkel et al. 2002). Only three radiometric dates have been obtained from these sites (Table 8). The date from Nizzanim, which is sometimes accepted (Gilead 1990; Gopher and Gophna 1993), is in my opinion too late, and the two from Giv'at Haparsa are completely anomalous. 2.3. CONCLUSIONS The first half of the eighth millennium BP, ca. 8100-7500 BP, is characterized by the PPNC. This archaeological unit, only recently recognized, is known from a considerable number of sites. The second half of the eighth millennium BP is characterized by the Yarmukian culture. The long- debated dating of Jericho IX, as well as that of the PN sites of the southern coastal plain, still await clarification. 21</page><page sequence="34">CHAPTER 3 THE GEOLOGICAL AND GEOMORPHOLOGIC AL SETTING OF THE ASHKELON NEOLITHIC SITE Eldad Barzilay The archaeological sites in the Afridar neighborhood of Ashkelon are located on an elongated kurkar ridge of Pleistocene age elevated 15-20 m above sea level, and in the elongated trough to its east. The purpose of this chapter is to describe the geological and geomorphological setting of the Neolithic site and its geo-archaeological implications. The stratigraphy of the site was studied through field observations in the excavated site itself, in construction trenches in its immediate proximity and along the shore. A kurkar quarry and other archaeological sites along the same ridge added a wider perspective. Sediment samples were taken from different sedimentary layers within the excavated area. These samples were processed to evaluate the physical and chemical properties of the sediments. 3.1. PHYSIOGRAPHY The site of Ashkelon can be grouped with a number of Neolithic sites located along the Mediterranean coast of Israel on the kurkar ridges and in the elongated basins (troughs) between them. This landscape of elongated sub-parallel ridges accompanied by elongated depressions extending along the present shoreline and inland characterizes the entire coastal plain of Israel (e.g., Nir 1970; Horowitz 1979; Gvirtzman et al. 1984; Gavish and Bakier 1990; Gvirtzman 1990; Nir 1992; Netser 1994). Studies of the topography of the shallow continent shelf revealed more sub-parallel ridges spread up to 600 m off shore, and even further on (Bakier 1989; Nir 1992; Gvirtzman 1990, map 10). The westernmost kurkar ridge forms a discontinuous coastal cliff rising in places to 40 m above mean sea level. This cliff is prominent along the central coastal plain of Israel and less prominent along the southern coastal plain. A segment of the cliff, some 8 km in length, is situated along the Peleshet Plain shoreline. This coastal cliff segment is best developed in the vicinity of Ashkelon (Nir 1992). A second ridge elevated 40-50 m above sea level is situated 1 .5 km east of the Ashkelon shoreline. The trough between these two ridges is elevated only 10-20 m above sea level. The Afridar neighborhood has been built on the trough and the coastal ridge. A third ridge is situated at a distance of 3-4 km from the shore. These three ridges, as well as the troughs between them, are covered in most places by a recent overlay of mobile sand dunes. Other less distinct ridges are found further inland. None of the ridges is continuous, for they have been breached by the hydrographie network draining the western national divide watersheds, as well as by local channels (Dan and Yaalon 1976; Dan et al. 1975; Nir 1992). Two wadis, Nahal Lachish and Nahal Shiqma, drain the Judean Mountains and the Shephela Hills into the Mediterranean Sea. These wadis share the same watershed from the national water divide down to the coastal Peleshet Plain, where local drainage basins exist. Consequently, most of the eastern Peleshet Plain is drained northwards to the Mediterranean by a local wadi named Nahal Evtah. Other areas, including the vicinity of Ashkelon, are drained by small-scale local or discontinuous hydrological networks. 23</page><page sequence="35">CHAPTER THREE 3.2. THE GEOLOGICAL SETTING The kurkar ridges mentioned above are a relic of the longitudinal sand dune fields of Pleistocene age that covered the shallow continental shelf and the coastal plain of Israel (e.g., Gvirtzman et al. 1984; Gavish and Bakler 1990; Gvirtzman 1990; Netser 1994). The sand originates in Ethiopia, moves down the Nile, and is carried by longshore currents to the coastline (Emery and Nee v 1960; Goldsmith and Golik 1980; Nir 1989; 1992). Penetration of sand inland is controlled by major wind directions, the topography of the beach, and the water content of the uppermost sand layer. Climatic changes and sea level fluctuations bring about constant change in the rate and location of sand deposition (Issar and Picard 1971; Gavish and Bakler 1990; Tsoar 1990; Tsoar and Blumberg 1990). The Quaternary Kurkar Group sediments that form this topography of ridges and depressions include mobile sand, eolianites ( kurkar ) and other calcareous sandstones, red loamy soils (hamra), and alluvial soils (Dan et al. 1975; Dan and Koyumdjiski 1979; Gvirtzman et al. 1984; Dan and Yaalon 1990; Gavish and Bakler 1990; Gvirtzman 1990; Netser 1994). A typical kurkar ridge is built of several sedimentary units of sand, kurkar, and soils of the hamra soil association. These units accumulate one on top of the other as a result of interaction between several processes such as sedimentation, soil formation and erosion. The Kurkar Group sediments have accumulated in the coastal plain on top of the Saqia Group. As a result of the initial dip of the Saqia Group's roof, the Kurkar Group sediments show a wedge-like cross-section. The Kurkar Group's base along the shore is at 1 80 m below sea level, with a thickness of about 200 m. In the eastern foothills the Kurkar Group sediments wedge out at an elevation of 0-30 m above sea level (Gvirtzman et al. 1984; Gvirtzman 1990; Netser 1994). The Kurkar Group consists of the Hefer and Rehovot Formations, which interfinger in places. The Hefer Formation covers most of the western area, while the Rehovot Formation covers the eastern vicinity of red sand hills. Only the upper members (geo-stratigraphic units) of the Hefer Formation are exposed in the vicinity of Ashkelon. These geological units are herein described from the lowermost to the uppermost. THE RAMAT-GAN MEMBER The Ramat-Gan kurkar (Horowitz 1978; Netser 1994) is the oldest and lowest exposed unit at the Ashkelon coastal cliff. This unit has a typical dunal morphology, characterized by cross-bedding of a well-cemented medium to fine quartz sand. Although this unit is not exposed in the excavation site itself, it is found in construction trenches just south of the site. Gvirtzman et al. (1984) and Gvirtzman (1990) suggested to combine the Ramat- Gan Member, the Nahsholim Member, and the Dor Member as sub-members of another member named the Giv'at Olga Member. THE NAHSHOLIM MEMBER The Nahsholim Member (Horowitz 1978; Netser 1994) is exposed along the coastal ridge above the Ramat-Gan kurkar. This dark-gray to brown sandy regosolic paleosol, 1 m thick, follows the paleogeography. The lower contact is gradual, while the upper one is clear. Other names given to this unit are café au lait (Avnimelech 1952) and Ga' ash hamra (Bakler 1989). This unit is not exposed in the excavation site itself but is found in construction trenches just south of the site. THE DOR MEMBER The Dor kurkar (Horowitz 1978; Netser 1994) is less consolidated than the Ramat-Gan kurkar. Another name given to this unit is Wingate kurkar (Bakler 1989; Gavish and Bakler 1990). The unit fills the relief of the Nahsholim Member with cross-bedded eolian sand, fairly well cemented by carbonate. A 3-meter-thick section of this unit is exposed below the excavated area. THE NETANYA MEMBER The Netanya Member (Horowitz 1978; Gvirtzman et al. 1984; Bakler 1989; Gavish and Bakler 1990; Gvirtzman 1990; Netser 1994) is the most developed of the hamra soils of the coastal ridge. 24</page><page sequence="36">THE GEOLOGICAL AND GEOMORPHOLOGICAL SETTING OF THE ASHKELON NEOLITHIC SITE The unit fills the relief left by the Dor Member. The hamra soil was altered into husmas soil in a process that will be encountered again below. This unit, 1 m thick, was the natural surface for the Neolithic occupation of the site. THE TEL- AVIV MEMBER The Tel- Aviv kurkar (Horowitz 1978; Gvirtzman et al. 1984; Gvirtzman 1990; Netser 1994) or the Bet Yanai Member (Bakier 1989; Gavish and Bakier 1990) is the uppermost and youngest kurkar unit in the Hefer Formation. This unit appears as a homogeneous lithologie layer, 1-5 m thick, which forms the summit of the coastal cliff and parts of the top of the second cliff, covered only by a thin layer of sand. The Tel- Aviv kurkar is cross-bedded, poorly sorted quartz sand, cemented by biogenic carbonate. This member is also known as "the plata" because of its leveled field appearance. The unit spreads north of Ashkelon but is lacking at the excavated site. THE TA'ARUHA SAND MEMBER The Ta'aruha Sands (Horowitz 1978; Gvirtzman et al. 1984; Gvirtzman 1990; Netser 1994) or the Nof-Yam Member (Bakier 1989; Gavish and Bakier 1990) are young quartz sand dunes that have stabilized to form a regosol. These sands appear along the present shoreline. The layer is very thin on the ridge and thickens eastwards. THE HADERA SAND MEMBER The Hadera sand (Horowitz 1978; Gvirtzman et al. 1984; Gvirtzman 1990; Netser 1994) or the Rishon le'Zion Member (Bakier 1989; Gavish and Bakler 1990) is the present-day sedimentary unit of the coastal plain of Israel. The dunes advanced inland and filled the depressions east of Ashkelon. Near Rishon leZion and Holon this dune field covered the old relief and formed a new one (Netser 1994). This unit forms the uppermost part of the site, bearing artifacts from Byzantine to later periods. 3.3. THE LITHOGENESIS OF KURKAR The internal structure of eolianites ridges indicates that they originated from dunes (Avnimelech 1952; Yaalon and Laronne 1 97 1 ). The lithogenesis process of kurkar starts with the deposition of windblown sand as transverse dunes in the area that we know as the coastal plain. The slip face orientation of the dunes is shaped by the direction of prevailing winds. The dune advances over the previous landscape, covering surface and soil (Netser 1994). The internal structure and orientation of the lamination in the dune is a result of particle size differentiation during ripple formation. The kurkar rocks maintain this structure because the amounts of carbonate are distributed within the dunes in accordance with their internal structure. The shells erode to small grains that the wind can carry, and they move inland with the quartz sand. These calcareous shell fragments, being coarser-grained than the quartz, accumulate on the crest of the ripples (Yaalon 1967). Wetting and drying cause cementation of the quartz sand by calcium carbonate, which is the first stage of the kurkar formation. There is a clear relationship between the degree of cementation and the amount of carbonate within the original sand dune. A minimum of 8-10% calcium carbonate in the sediment is needed to achieve lithification of the dune (Yaalon 1967). Hard kurkar rock contains about 30% calcium carbonate. A probable source of additional carbonate is pedogenic carbonate leached from the surface by rainwater. The rate of lithification decreases with time. An initial rapid cementation process induced by the impact of plant roots, especially in the presence of high percentages of carbonate (Dan et al. 1985; Dan and Yaalon 1990). Such a process can produce a fairly cemented kurkar during 4000-5000 years (Bakler 1989; Porat and Wintle 1995; Ritte et al. 1997). The complete diagenesis of kurkar is a much slower process. It certainly takes tens of millennia or more to change all the original aragonite and magnesium calcite into calcite process (Yaalon 1967; Yaalon and Laronne 1971). 3.4. THE PEDOGENESIS OF HAMRA Hamra (Soil Survey Staff 1975: Typic Rhodoxeralf) soils consist of an ABC horizon sequence. The A horizon is brown, sandy in texture, and massive to 25</page><page sequence="37">CHAPTER THREE loose in structure. The red B horizon has a strong blocky or prismatic structure with continuous clay coatings on ped surfaces (Dan and Koyumdjiski 1979; Dan 1988). The hamra soils originate from sand dunes containing low percentage of carbonate under a favorable water percolation regime (Dan et al. 1975). Once the sand dunes are stabilized, the pedogenesis process starts with leaching of the carbonate into the groundwater and reddening of the sand (Dan et al. 1985). Such reddening indicates that the calcium carbonate is leached out, some dust is infiltrating, and magnetite and other iron oxides are coating the quartz grains. Dust accumulation is important because it is the agent by which clay and silt size grains are added to the soil (Dan and Yaalon 1966; Yaalon and Ganor 1975). Clay and silt accumulate mainly in the B horizon of soil profiles along the hamra soil association catena. Due to runoff water movement down the slopes, the lower parts of the slopes and the depressions receive much more water than the upper parts. Clay particles move downslope with the water and leach in the lower parts of the catena (Dan and Yaalon 1966). As a result, the clay content of these soils is higher. A typical catena consists of red sandy-clay-loam hamra on moderate slopes and sandy hamra on steep slopes. On the footslope, compaction by settling and imbedding of clay impedes drainage, resulting in the development of nazaz, a dense mottled pseudogley. Gray and black hydromorphic grumusols occur in the depressions, exhibiting a perched water table and marshy conditions during winter rains (Dan et al. 1985; Dan and Yaalon 1990; Yaalon 1992). Many of the depressions have a closed drainage (Yaalon 1967). 3.5. THE PEDOGENESIS OF HUSMAS Husmas (Soil Survey Staff 1975: Calcic Rhodoxeralf) soils have an ABcaC horizon sequence. The A horizon is brown and calcareous and the B horizon is reddish and contains hard calcareous concretions. The soil matrix may be non-calcareous (Dan 1988). Essentially, husmas is a hamra soil that contains large amounts of calcium carbonate (Dan and Koyumdjiski 1979). This carbonate cements the quartz grains of the B horizon and forms a hard rock-like mass. During the pedogenesis process of hamra soils, calcium carbonate is leached out of the soil profile into the ground water table (Dan and Yaalon 1966). Therefore, it is clear that husmas is a polygenetic soil in which the accumulation of calcium carbonate within the soil profile is a secondary process succeeding the pedogenesis of the hamra (Wieder 1977). This phase is induced by environmental changes due to fluctuations of the climate from the Mediterranean to the semi-arid moisture regimes (Dan and Yaalon 1971). Such changes may include one or more of the following: a dramatic increase in dust influx, a decrease in rainwater available for leaching, changes in pC02 due to change in vegetation coverage, or even burial of the soil. This process is prominent within the coastal Peleshet Plain (Dan et al. 1972; Wieder 1977). The modification of hamra into husmas takes thousands of years. In most cases this process is followed by an erosion phase eroding the upper profile of the soil and exposing the calcareous B horizon at the surface. 3.6. THE GEO- ARCHAEOLOGICAL IMPLICATIONS OF THE GEOMORPHOLOGICAL HISTORY OF THE ASHKELON COASTAL CLIFF Much of the geomorphological history of the coastal cliff of Ashkelon was determined by the global climate changes that occurred during the Late Pleistocene and the Early Holocene ( 1 30,000-7000 BP). These climate changes caused a change in the global ice volume that resulted in major fluctuations in global sea level (Dawson 1992). The global sea level during the last interglacial (ca. 125,000 BP) was close to the modern mean sea level. Subsequently, sea level fluctuations show a trend of decline to a minimum level of 1 20-1 30 m below modern sea level. This minimum level was reached during the last glacial maximum ( 1 8,000 BP) when the global ice sheets reached their maximum size (Shackleton 1987). The release of most of this ice 26</page><page sequence="38">THE GEOLOGICAL AND GEOMORPHOLOGICAL SETTING OF THE ASHKELON NEOLITHIC SITE into the oceans occurred between about 16,000 and 8000 BP, resulting in rapid sea level rise at rates of 15 mm per year during this interval (Lambeck 1996). The sea level then rose at an average rate of 5.2 mm per year from -14 m at 8000 BP to -4 m at 6000 BP (Galili et al. 1988). The present sea level was reached about 6000-7000 years ago (Morner 1969; Fairbanks 1989). It has fluctuated by no more than a meter during the last 2000 years (Galili et al. 1988; Pirazzoli et al. 1989). The migration of the Mediterranean coastline in accordance with these climatic fluctuations caused a 20-kilometer reduction in the width of Israel's coastal plain. The appearance of the dune fields, their stabilization, and the formation of the kurkar ridges along the coastal plain are results of these global changes, although the connection between the changes and the sedimentary sequence is not clear (see review in Gvirtzman 1990). Several events of dune mobilization and stabilization are recorded in the coastal ridge. The stabilization of the dunes was dated using the Infra- Red Stimulated Luminescence method (Porat and Wintle 1995; Ritte et al. 1997). According to the estimated dates for the Ramat-Gan, Nahsholim, and Dor Members, these units were deposited during a short interval of 10,000-15,000 years, which ended at about 50,000 BP. Hence, the main body of the present coastal ridge of Israel was formed during this time interval in a terrestrial environment in which the Mediterranean shore was located some 10-15 km west of its present location (Porat and Wintle 1995). Subsequently, the Netanya Member paleosols were active at the surface until 13,000 BP (Ritte et al. 1997). At the same time, major climate and sea level fluctuations occurred. The last glacial regression caused a further drop in the sea level (-130 m at 18,000 BP) and the transgression that followed it elevated it to about -100 m at 13,000 BP (Lambeck 1996). The hamra paleosols sequence of the Netanya Member is represented in the coastal Peleshet Plain by husmas soils. These soils indicate that in the past, the primary stages of soil development resembled the typical hamra soils of the Sharon plain due to a somewhat moister climate (Dan et al. 1972). Moister conditions are proposed for the latest Pleistocene in Israel (cf. Begin et al. 1985; Goring-Morris and Goldberg 1990; Frumkin et al. 1991) and the Palmahim region over the interval 14,000-19,000 BP (Schuldenrein 1986). The drier conditions that followed enabled the formation of the calcic husmas soil. These soils were eroded during a later period of their evolution. In Ashkelon, as in most places, the upper A horizon is totally eroded, leaving the harder calcic B horizon at the surface. This is the surface that was occupied in the PPNC at Ashkelon. Since the Neolithic period the sea level has risen at an average rate of 5.2 mm per year from -14 m at 8000 BP to -4 m at 6000 BP (Galili et al. 1988; Fairbanks 1989). The paleo-shoreline of -14 m was situated a few hundred meters west of the kurkar ridge and the site. The transgressing Mediterranean has caused a progressively narrowing of the coastal plain, leaving less space to be exploited towards the west. As a result of the discontinuous nature of the hydrologie network and the proximity of the coastline, the area offered rich resources, both from the sea and from freshwater swamps. Grazing pastures for sheep and wild life are available both on the ridges and in well-drained basins, which in places offer good agricultural land (Dan et al. 1972). Fresh water at a level close to sea level is easily reached by digging shallow wells (Nir and Eldar 1986). Such a well, dug to a depth of 5.5 m and dated to the PPNC, was excavated at the submerged Neolithic site of ' Atlit Yam (Galili et al. 1993). During the Neolithic occupation of the site, the western kurkar ridge was an inland ridge with a symmetrical cross section, similar to the other inland ridges. As the sea level rose to the present sea level, the western flank of the ridge was partly eroded by the waves and a discontinued coastal cliff ridge was shaped. This level was reached about 6000 years ago. Since then the sea level has hardly changed, with only minor fluctuations during the last 2000 years (Pirazzoli et al. 1989; Galili et al. 1988). This young coastal cliff is prominent along the central coastal plain of Israel and less prominent along the southern coastal plain. The coastal ridge near Ashkelon was sparsely eroded by the waves because of the wide sandy beaches 27</page><page sequence="39">CHAPTER THREE and large amounts of beachrock, which preserved the foot of the ridge. At the same time, the husmas soil preserved its upper surface. As a result, the northern part of Ashkelon cliff is low (its general height is 10-20 m), covered with sand dunes, and static (Nir 1992). No tectonic uplift activity subsequent to the Late Bronze Age is documented (Nir and Eldar 1987), and no destruction of the cliff during at least the last 800 years is discernible, apart from the massive destruction during the twentieth century (Nir 1989). The sediments accumulated at the site during and after the Neolithic occupation consist mostly of fine sand with additional fine earth. The eroded husmas surface was covered by large amounts of windblown sand. Some of the sand was deposited but most of it simply moved inland. The sandy nature of the natural sediment was altered by the human occupation. Fine sediments and organic matter were brought to the site and mixed with the sand. The sources of the fine earth were mud bricks and waste from installations that the inhabitants of the site dug into the hard husmas layer. As a result, artifacts were deposited within a loamy sand regosol with residual calcareous concretions. No clear stratigraphie marker can be used to combine different installations into a single occupation phase, because of the dynamic nature of the environment. This unconsolidated sediment was easily eroded by combined forces of wind and water prior to the Late Chalcolithic occupation of the site. A clear erosion surface can be detected between the Late Chalcolithic sediment and the Neolithic sediments: the Neolithic period sediment is darker in color and more compact in texture when compared with the Chalcolithic sediment (Ta'aruha Sands Member). The last sedimentation phase of the Hadera sand took place after another erosion phase, which followed this occupation. The human impact on the soil accelerated the initial stages of pedogenesis but left the soils in the same mode of change. The young soils of the Peleshet Plain, developed under the present semi- arid climatic conditions, show with increasing evolution a slow change from a sandy regosol into a residual dark brown soil and finally even a grumusolic dark brown soil (Dan et al. 1972). 3.7. GEOLOGICAL RESOURCES The aeolian nature of the sediments that comprise the ridge and its surroundings reduces the variety of resources to kurkar , husmas , and fine-textured soils. Other materials had to be brought to the site by the inhabitants. Materials such as beachrock and seashells were brought from the sea. Flint, chalk, and limestone pebbles occur at least 10 km from the site, in the channel beds of Nahal Shiqma and Nahal Lachish and in outcrops of conglomerates of Neogene and Quaternary ages (Buchbinder 1969; Gvirtzman and Buchbinder 1969). High- quality tabular flint was probably brought from Eocene outcrops located even further away in the northern Negev and the Shephela (Rosen 1983). The nearest Miocene basalt outcrops are exposed in the Hulda- Yesodot area (Gvirtzman and Buchbinder 1969) and the northern Shephela (Livnat 1985). Other Miocene basalt outcrops are exposed in the Negev craters and in the Carmel region (Picard et al. 1965). Vast basalt fields are located in the eastern Galilee, the Golan, and along the Dead Sea Rift valley (Picard et al. 1965; Mor 1986). Ferrogenous sandstone, found in previous excavations, probably originates from the lower Cretaceous Kurnub Group, of which the nearest exposures are in the middle Jordan Valley, the Negev craters, and the Timna and Sinai regions (Picard et al. 1965). 28</page><page sequence="40">PART II: THE FIELD OBSERVATIONS</page><page sequence="41">CHAPTER 4 EXPEDITION ORGANIZATION AND EXCAVATION METHODS Yosef Garfinkel and Angela Davidzon 4.1. THE EXPEDITION In the early 1990s a new yacht marina was constructed on the Ashkelon seashore, in the neighborhood known as Afridar. This was followed by massive development of the vicinity, including hotels, resort apartments, and the necessary infrastructures (Photo 8). These developments required numerous large-scale salvage excavations conducted by various archaeologists, as well as underwater surveys (Brandl and Gophna 1993; Baumgarten 1996; Braun and Gophna 1996; Galili and Sharvit 1996; Golani 1997; Khalaily and Wallach 1998; Golani and Milevski 1999; Golani and Segal 2002). Many of these excavations were published recently in a monograph (Gal 2004). The sites excavated range in date from the Late Chalcolithic to the Byzantine period. Although it was known that a Neolithic site had been excavated in the 1950s by Jean Perrot in this region, the exact location of the Neolithic site was unknown, as the area excavated by Perrot had Photo 8. Aerial view of the marina area in 1995 during construction. 31</page><page sequence="42">CHAPTER FOUR Fig. 6. The location of the 1997 probes. been covered over the years. Thus, a great deal of damage had been inflicted on the western portion of the Neolithic settlement by the developers. The area excavated by Perrot was completely removed by building activities and an artificial cliff was formed. In 1996 Amir Golani, who was excavating part of the nearby Late Chalcolithic site, observed two Neolithic pits in this cliff. This observation pinpointed the location of the Neolithic site and saved it from utter destruction. In 1997 the Ashkelon development company performed road works that required the complete removal of this cliff. This created the need for emergency excavations in the newly recognized Neolithic site. A strip 25 m wide and about 80 m long was in immediate danger of destruction. In 1997 we were asked to test this strip, adjacent to the pits observed by Golani. A two- week excavation was conducted, aimed at defining more accurately the horizontal and vertical extent of the Neolithic layer (excavation permit G-59/97). The section of the already destroyed western side of the site was recorded, revealing a Neolithic layer below the modern sand dune and above the kurkar ridge. Eight probes were excavated (Fig. 6). The total area of these probes is 60 m2. The southernmost probe revealed no archaeological remains, limiting the extent of the site to the northern 60 m of the strip. The depth of the Neolithic layer proved to be shallow (ca. 40 cm) on the west and greater (almost two meters) on the east. In the spring of 1998 a long season of three months of excavation was conducted (excavation permit G-41/98), in order to uncover the entire strip (Fig. 7 ; Photo 9). The Neolithic site extends to the east of our excavations, and as it is covered with a thick layer of sand its boundaries are unknown. Additional excavations will be needed when further building development takes place here. 4.2. EXCAVATION AND REGISTRATION METHODS In the western section a clear boundary was noted between the topsoil sand dune and the archaeological layer; the two differed markedly in color, composition, texture, and compactness. Thus, it was unnecessary to remove the dune by manual labor and it was removed mostly mechanically (Photo 10). Only the lowermost portion of the sand dune was removed manually to prevent damage to the archaeological remains. 32</page><page sequence="43">EXPEDITION ORGANIZATION AND EXCAVATION METHODS Fig. 7.

After clearance of 1-1 .5 m of the sandy topsoil, a multiple grid system was laid out. First, large squares of 5 X 5 m were marked, mainly for the convenience of the technical work of recording. Balks 50 cm thick were left between the squares, providing a network of sections. Sandbags were placed around the squares to avoid sediment collapse (Photos 11-13). For the actual work of excavation, a finer 1 x 1 m grid was used inside each 5 x 5 m square. The excavation was organized into several teams of three workers each, each team including one more experienced worker digging in the probe (Photos 14-15). The buckets of soil were labeled for each excavation unit, and the other two members of the team screened all of the Neolithic sediments by dry sieving through a 3 mm mesh (Photo 16). Two or three such teams worked in each square and were headed by a student. Since the sediments were soft, containing a fair amount of sand, the excavation was executed by delicate tools, mostly trowels, brushes, and small geological hammers. In the 1997 season each large square was covered by fine netting to protect the workers from the sun (Photo 17). In the 1998 season, when larger areas were excavated, large nets in the shape of a tent were constructed above the working areas (Photo 18). All archaeological finds, including animal bones, flints, and various other types of artifacts, were collected, preferably during the excavation or alternatively from the screens. All finds were washed and placed to dry in the shade. The finds of each excavated unit were placed in a paper bag on which all the relevant information (bucket number, square, elevation, and date) was recorded (Photos 19-21). After drying, the finds underwent preliminary sorting. Each category of finds (e.g. flint, bones, stone artifacts, obsidian, and seashell) was packed and marked in the field daily. In both seasons, altogether ca. 800 m2 were excavated and ca. 480 m3 of Neolithic sediments were processed. The basic unit of excavation was the basket. In most cases baskets were defined by spit, meaning that a basket contained all the material derived from a 1 x 1 m square dug to a spit usually of five to ten centimeters, although thinner or 35</page><page sequence="46">CHAPTER FOUR Photo 12. A large grid of 5 x 5 m was marked all over the excavated area. thicker spits were used in accordance with the archaeological context. The basket represents a sediment unit and all the finds retrieved from it. Different materials, such as flints, bones, or soil samples, received the same basket number but were packed separately. In order to represent the archaeological reality more accurately, a system of loci was also used. A locus was initially defined as any well-delineated unit deposited by man, such as a hearth or installation. In strips D and E, the Neolithic layer was rather thin and homogeneous and received no locus number, though a detailed description of the matrix was entered into the log. However, during the excavation of strip F it became evident that there was more than one phase of Neolithic occupation. We continued to note changes in color and matrix in the log without attributing locus numbers to the different units, but it became apparent that our recording was inadequate. As a result, during the excavation of strip G a different strategy of assigning locus numbers was applied. Each deposited layer was defined as a separate locus, in addition to the basket/spit system. In effect, every change in sediment color, matrix etc. resulted in a change of locus. Thus, every bucket of sediment removed from the strip belonged to a locus, and the relations between the loci eventually represented the superposition of layers, sub-layers, and installations relating to them. Technically, the basket served as a sub-unit of the locus and each locus was excavated in several baskets. Naturally, some of the loci did not encompass large volumes of sediment. Some of the hearths, for example, were smaller than one meter square and only a few centimeters deep. Thus, in such instances the boundaries of the basket were defined not by the grid and spit units, but rather by the limits of the locus. The recording system was based on a running list ("bank") of numbers, one list for the basket numbers and another for the locus numbers, and on two daily logs, written and graphic. During the 1997 season, different lists were used for each probe. This created problems in controlling the baskets after they underwent washing and packing, and a single list was used for the entire 36</page><page sequence="47">EXPEDITION ORGANIZATION AND EXCAVATION METHODS Photo 13.

Each supervisor drew numbers according to need from both the basket and the locus lists. Records were kept for baskets (number, square, opening and closing elevations, and eventually also contents) and loci (number, square, and elevations). Loci were additionally described in a log that contained, in addition to a description, such data as relation to other loci. A daily graphic log was kept indicating the location of the excavated units for that day and schematic drawing of any features discovered. P. Philips made detailed drawings of both sections and installations before their demolition. Later, J. Rosenberg produced the final drawings for publication in Jerusalem. Elevations above sea level were measured at the end of each day. Installations were drawn at a scale of 1:50 or 1:10. Photographs of installations, squares, and sections were taken systematically by the staff. B. Boaz took general photographs of the site as well as studio photographs of artifacts. The nature of the project required cooperation with the development company. Thus, the excavation started at the western end of the site in a strip 5 m wide (Photo 22). After the strip was completely excavated and sections were recorded, the area was released for construction. In several cases bulldozers demolished the excavated strip while archaeological work was still on going in the next strip (Photo 23). This limitation prevented exposure of the same phase over the entire site. Rather, four strips 5 m wide were excavated separately to their entire depth and connected later on the basis of the sections and documentation of the excavation. 4.3 THE ANALYSIS AND PUBLICATION OF THE EXCAVATED MATERIAL The analysis of the excavated material and its preparation for publication is no less important 39</page><page sequence="50">CHAPTER FOUR Photo 22. Work was done in 5 m wide strips; this is strip G at the end of the 1998 season looking north. than the fieldwork; in fact, it is a much more demanding and tedious task. The analysis of the excavated material, and the writing of this report, took six years (1998-2004). Altogether, 14 scholars from various disciplines were involved in this process. At the end of the first season in 1997, a preliminary study of the flint assemblage was carried out by Y. Garfinkel and A. Krauz. Six samples of organic material were sent to Oxford for accelerated radiocarbon dating (Garfinkel 1999a). At the end of the second and final season in 1998, preliminary accounts of the excavations were published (Garfinkel 1999c; 2001). The main project of studying the excavated material was then initiated. One primary goal was to summarize the field observations, i.e. the various pits, hearths, sediment layers, and their stratigraphie relations to one another. A preliminary description and summary of all excavated units was completed immediately after the second season by Anna Eirikh-Rose. The other primary goal was to study the various categories of finds. The largest category, Photo 23. Bulldozing away the excavated strips D and E, while work continues on the next stnp (F). 40</page><page sequence="51">EXPEDITION ORGANIZATION AND EXCAVATION METHODS nearly 94,000 items, is the animal bones. These were analyzed during the summers of 1998 and 1999 by Brian Hesse and Dolores Rookis. Only a preliminary summary of this vast collection has been written so far, and is presented here in Chapter 15. During this analysis, Testudines and fish remains were separated from the rest of the bones and were given to specialists: the Testudines remains to Gideon Hartman (see Chapter 16) and the fish bones to Omri Lernau (see Chapter 17). The second largest category of finds is the flint assemblage, comprising 36,786 items. This assemblage was studied in detail by Doron Dag. Preliminary observations were presented in the third workshop on PN assemblages of the Levant (Garfinkel and Dag 2001). The comprehensive analysis was presented in Dag's MA thesis (Dag 2001). Part II of the present report is dedicated to the technology, typology, and comparative analysis of the flint industry. In addition to these two large categories of finds, numerous smaller classes of finds were analyzed: the bone tools by Paula Wapnish (Chapter 12), the burials by Marina Faerman and Patricia Smith (Chapter 14), the molluscs by Daniella Bar-Yosef Mayer (Chapter 18), the provenance of the obsidian and pumice by Jörg Keller, Ernst Pernicka, and Kirstin Kasper (Chapter 19), and the Hellenistic to Islamic pottery by Barbara Johnson (Appendix C). A welcome by-product of our work at Ashkelon was the study of the material from the nearby PN site of Ziqim. Ziqim was surveyed and excavated by the late T. Noy in the early to mid- 1 970s and was partly presented in her PhD thesis (Noy 1975; 1977; 1993). With the involvement of various scholars (Doron Dag, Liora Kolska Horwitz, Omri Lernau, and Henk K. Mienis), a final excavation report on the site was completed and published (Garfinkel et al. 2002). 41</page><page sequence="52">CHAPTER 5 THE STRATIGRAPHY Yosef Garfinkel, Doron Dag , and Anna Eirikh-Rose Six basic stratigraphie and cultural units were observed in our excavations (Table 9; Figs. 8-1 1 ; Photos 24-26). The data are presented in the following manner: 1 Section 5.1 of this chapter presents a general summary of each layer, from topsoil to virgin soil. 2 Section 5.2 of this chapter deals with the field observations of all layers in a detailed analysis, square by square. Most of the photographs of this section present individual installations, such as hearths and pits. 3 Chapter 6 concentrates on the PPNC layer, summarizing its various installations and their spatial distribution. The photographs of this chapter present whole squares and larger excavation units. While Chapter 5 presents the vertical dimension of the site, Chapter 6 deals with the horizontal dimension. 4 Appendix A at the end of this volume gives a list of all excavated loci, their location, and a short description.

THE LAYERS LAYER I A recent yellowish sand dune, mixed with the ruins of a modern kiosk, electricity trenches, drainage pipes, and one brick wall. One of the trenches crossed the excavated area from northwest to southeast and cut deep into the Neolithic layer (Loc. 288; Photo 27). The brick wall, running east- west, was about 40 cm wide and its foundation trench cut through the Neolithic layer down to virgin soil (Loc. 72; Photo 28). The topsoil was assigned several locus numbers during the excavations (Loc. 1, 50, 51,70,297,298, 351,389). Although the finds were overwhelmingly modern (glass bottles, pieces of plastic, ceramic tiles, etc.), some Islamic and Roman/Byzantine potsherds and Neolithic flints were mixed with them. The layer was 1-2 m thick and was mostly removed mechanically. LAYER II This layer is composed of 39 pits, distributed more or less evenly over the entire area. The pits were dug into the Neolithic sediments and contained yellowish sandy sediments and Roman/Byzantine potsherds (see, for example, Photo 29). No architecture, floors, or occupational debris were found. The pits were mostly circular or ovoid, with a diameter of 20-120 cm and a depth between a 43</page><page sequence="53">CHAPTER FIVE Fig. 8.

In some cases (particularly in the western part of the site, where the layers are thin), the pits were dug right through the Neolithic layer, down to the husmas. In three cases the pits were in pairs, a larger one containing potsherds (Loc. 201, 205, 206) and an adjacent smaller pit that yielded no finds (Loc. 201a, 205a, 206a). In two cases, both in Square G/13 (Loc. 310, 313; Photo 29), the pits had a paving of potsherds with burnt sediment above it (cooking installations?). LAYER III This occupation phase consists of two or probably three Late Chalcolithic pits. Two are bell-shaped pits containing potsherds (Loc. 296, 3 1 1 ; Photo 30) located near one another, one in Square G/15 and the other in Square G/14. The third pit (Loc. 355; 47</page><page sequence="57">CHAPTER FIVE Photo 27. Modern trench (Loc. 288) in Square G/16, cutting Loc. 300 and 330. Photo 28. Modern trench and brick wall (Loc. 72) in Squares D-E/16. Photo 29. Roman/Byzantine Pit 310 in Square G/13. Photos 31-32) may be dated to this layer as well, although it contained no indicative finds. Loc. 296 is a small bell-shaped pit in Square G/15, 50 cm in diameter at the opening and 70 cm at the base, and about 60 cm deep. It was dug through the Neolithic layer, penetrating the virgin soil. The fill sediment was dark and sandy, and the finds were mainly Late Chalcolithic potsherds and a broken grinding slab. Loc. 311 is a large bell-shaped pit in Square G/14, about 80 cm in diameter at the opening and 130 cm at the base, and almost two meters deep. The top of the pit was below the recent sand layer and its base was dug into the virgin soil. The fill sediment was dark and sandy, and the finds were mainly Late Chalcolithic potsherds, some bones, and some charred olive pits. Loc. 355 is a very deep straight-walled shaft in Square G/12, about 3.5 m deep and one meter in diameter, dug through the Neolithic layer and deep into the virgin soil. The sandy fill was very similar to that of the Late Chalcolithic pits, but no indicative finds were found in the shaft. In addition, about ten Late Chalcolithic potsherds were found in Square G/14, in the topsoil Loc. 298 and in Neolithic layers -3 12 and 356 (see below, Appendix C). They reflect an additional activity area of the Late Chalcolithic period at the site. These poor remains represent the margins of a Late Chalcolithic and Early Bronze Age site found nearby (Brandl and Gophna 1993; Baumgarten 1996; Braun and Gophna 1996; Khalaily and Wallach 1996; Golani 1997; Golani and Milevski 1997; Braun 2001a; 2001b; Golani and Segal 2002). Our part of this site is designated "Afridar Area L" (see below, Appendix C).

It is characterized by numerous pits, hearths, and animal bones. The sediment was mostly sandy, with the amount of sand increasing in the upper parts of the section. This layer is subdivided into three phases: IVa, IVb, and IVc. A detailed description of Layer IV and its three phases is given below in Chapter 6. LAYER V An assemblage of 460 Epi-Paleolithic flint microliths was found mixed in the Neolithic layer. This intrusive element apparently eroded from an unknown, but probably nearby, Epi-Paleolithic site and was transferred and redeposited in the Neolithic layer. Its material is presented and analyzed in Appendix C at the end of this book. LAYER VI The virgin soil is not homogeneous in the excavated area. In the western part of the site, which is topographically higher, hard husmas and kurkar rock were found below the archaeological layers (see Chapter 3 for detailed discussion of the geology). In most of the area light yellowish husmas sediments constitute the virgin soil. In the eastern part of the site the Neolithic remains were found on top of a very dark, sterile layer of clay. During the excavations the virgin soil was assigned locus numbers in only a few instances (Loc. 52, 97, 374). The topography of the virgin soil slopes down to the east, as the excavated area is located on the eastern slope of a kurkar ridge. Thus, it is higher in the western part and lower in the east. In three places in the east, natural depressions in the kurkar ridge were used for Neolithic occupation; the northernmost of the three is the largest, about 1.5 m deep and almost 100 m2 in area. These depressions created more sheltered areas and were intensively used. The topography of the virgin soil also affects the archaeological layers, which are thicker in the lower parts of the site. This is probably related to two factors: a preference for the more sheltered areas of the site (the prevailing wind is westerly) and post-depositional processes that moved material (by rain, wind, and gravity) down the slope. 49</page><page sequence="59">CHAPTER FIVE 5.2. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EXCAVATION BY SQUARE In the following, the detailed stratigraphy is presented square by square, starting from the southern part of the excavation and progressing to the north. Details of the individual loci are given in Appendix A. SQUARE G/9 When we started excavating in this square, the upper 1-2 m had already been removed by construction works carried out nearby to the west. All of the southern part of our area, nearly 200 m2, was lower than the northern part, which still preserved its original topsoil. Our goal in testing Square G/9 was to find out if any Neolithic remains had been preserved, or whether the entire layer had been removed. An area of 2 x 4 m was excavated at the western end of the square. A section about 1.5 m deep was exposed below the current topsoil. The upper meter consisted of brown clayey sediment, mixed with large quantities of sand. Within this layer darker lenses of clay were detected, while compact black clay was found below. The section yielded only sparse flint items in secondary deposition. Since no Neolithic layer was found in situ , it became clear that the entire southern part of the site had been completely destroyed. SQUARE G/ll The topsoil of the square (Loc. 389) consisted of sand. Below it, dark brown clayey sediment (Loc. 392), rich in animal bones, was found. The layer was about 50 cm thick and sloped down by about 40 cm towards the north. A large elliptical hearth built of large and medium-sized stones (Loc. 400) was found in the lower part of the layer, directly above the husmas. Below the Neolithic layer the natural hard husmas was found. SQUARE H/ll A 2 x 2 m probe was excavated in the 1997 season (basket numbers with top and base levels were given here rather than locus numbers). After removal of a modern sand dune, a dark brown clayey layer was exposed below it. This layer was about 40 cm thick and contained Neolithic flint items and animal bones. At the top of this layer burnt stones were found, together with dark sediment, burnt items, and lumps of baked sediments. These are probably the remains of a hearth in a poor state of preservation. The lower part of the layer contained no installations. At the base of the square, light yellow sterile husmas sediment was exposed. SQUARE F/12 Only the northeastern corner of the square was preserved. The topsoil (Loc. 1) consisted of sand. Below it, two Neolithic phases were detected. The upper one, about 10-20 cm thick, was light brown in color, while the lower one, also about 10-20 cm thick, was dark brown and clayey. Since the contact between the two was not clear-cut, about 10 cm were defined as transitional. A large shallow depression (Loc. 263) was found at the lower level, sunk into the husmas. At the base of the square, the natural husmas sediment was found. SQUARE G/12 Below the sand topsoil of the square (Loc. 35 1 ), a pit (Loc. 352), dug into the Neolithic layer, was found. It was full of sand containing Roman/Byzantine potsherds. Another pit (Loc. 355), nearly 3.5 m deep and 1 m in diameter, cut through the Neolithic layers and deep into the virgin soil; this was perhaps a well. Although it yielded no indicative finds, this pit may date from the Late Chalcolithic. Two Neolithic layers were detected in the square. The upper one (Loc. 357) was very dark and compact, with abundant signs of burning and animal bones. It was about 10-20 cm thick and sloped down by about 30 cm towards the east. Below it was a slightly darker layer with a broadly similar matrix (Loc. 368, 371, 372, 385; Photo 33); this layer was about 20-60 cm thick and more or less horizontal. From it a circular pit about 2 m in diameter and 45 cm deep (Loc. 390) was dug into the virgin soil. The pit's walls were oblique and incorporated large stones up to 40 cm across. At the base of the pit were several hearths built of 50</page><page sequence="60">THE STRATIGRAPHY Photo 33. Loc. 371, combined with Loc. 368, in Square G/12. stones and accompanied by lumps of clay. The fill contained dark burnt sediment, plentiful bones, flints, and a grinding slab. This feature may have served as a dwelling pit. The lower Neolithic layer included two additional hearths (Loc. 378, 391), as well as the edge of a large dwelling pit (Loc. 263) extending into Square G/13. A thin layer of husmas (Loc. 374) was found interstratified with Loc. 368. At the base of the square, light yellow sterile husmas sediment was exposed. SQUARE H/12 A 2 X 2 m probe was excavated in the southern part of the square. After removal of a modern sand dune, a dark brown clayey layer was found below it. This layer was about 80 cm deep and its base sloped down towards the north. Two dense occupational phases were detected, the upper one about 30 cm thick and the lower containing a round hearth. Below this layer, light yellow sterile husmas sediment was exposed. SQUARE F/13 Only the eastern half of the square was preserved. The topsoil of the square (Loc. 1) consisted of sand. In the Neolithic layer below it two phases were detected. The upper one was light brown in color and about 10-30 cm thick. The lower one was dark brown and clayey, and about 10-40 cm thick. The contact between the two was not clear-cut and about 10-20 cm were defined as transitional. The layers sloped down by about 20-30 cm towards the south. At the base of the lower level a large hearth (Loc. 257) was found. It was made of small and medium-sized burnt stones and burnt lumps of clay, red/orange in color. Between and around the stones was a very dark burnt sediment and the area around the hearth was rich in animal bones. In this square the continuation of the large shallow depression (Loc. 263), partly excavated in Square F/12, was found. This probably functioned as a dwelling pit. At the base of the square, light yellow sterile husmas sediment was exposed. SQUARE G/13 The topsoil of the square (Loc. 297) consisted of sand. Below it were found two pits dug into the Neolithic layer (Loc. 310, 313; Photo 29). The pits were filled with sand containing Roman/Byzantine potsherds. The upper Neolithic layer (Loc. 308) was light brown in color, about 10-30 cm thick, and sloped down by about 20 cm toward the east. Below it was a darker Neolithic layer (Loc. 325), about 30 cm thick and also sloping down towards the east. Below it was a still darker layer (Loc. 345); it was about 30 cm thick and sloped down towards the northeast, with the western part being about 20 cm higher and southern part about 20-80 cm higher. In this layer, in part of Depression 263, an exceptionally large hearth (or perhaps several connected hearths) was found (Loc. 370; Photo 34). It measured about 4 x 1 m and was made of small and medium-sized burnt stones. Between and around the stones were a very dark burnt sediment and burnt lumps of clay. Below the Neolithic occupation a sandy, clayey sterile layer (Loc. 346) constituted the virgin soil. SQUARE E/14 Only 1 m2 in the northeastern corner of the square was preserved. The topsoil consisted of sand. Below it, a dark brown clayey Neolithic layer (Loc. 71), about 30 cm thick, was found. Further down the natural husmas sediment was reached. SQUARE F/14 The topsoil of the square (Loc. 1 ) consisted of sand. Below it, a single pit (Loc. 416) was dug into the 51</page><page sequence="61">CHAPTER FIVE Photo 34. Hearth 370 in Square G/13. Neolithic layer. The pit was full of sand containing Roman/Byzantine potsherds. Below it was the Neolithic layer, in which two phases were detected, the upper one light brown in color and about 20-50 cm thick, and the lower one dark brown and clayey and about 10-20 cm thick. The contact between the two was not clear-cut and about 10 cm were defined as transitional. In the lower Neolithic level, a large hearth (Loc. 250) was built directly above the husmas. Another hearth (Loc. 251) was found in a poor state of preservation. At the base of the square, light yellow sterile husmas sediment was exposed. SQUARE G/14 The topsoil of the square (Loc. 298) consisted of sand. Below it, four pits full of sand containing Roman/Byzantine potsherds (Loc. 294, 295, 301, 309), dug into the Neolithic sediments, were found. An additional pit (Loc. 311) was bell-shaped and dug through the entire Neolithic layer down to virgin soil. The fill of this pit was dark yellow sand and contained Late Chalcolithic potsherds. A few more Late Chalcolithic potsherds were found intruding into the Neolithic Loc. 312 and 356 below. Below the topsoil, a dark layer mixed with sand (Loc. 299), about 10 cm thick, was exposed, mainly in the western part of the square. This layer may be the result of post-Neolithic digging activity. Below it, a dark brown Neolithic layer (Loc. 312), 60-80 cm thick and sloping down by about 40 cm towards the east, was found. A destroyed hearth (Loc. 323) was associated with this layer. Below it was a darker layer (Loc. 356), 20-50 cm thick and sloping down towards the east by about 60 cm. There were two hearths (Loc. 354, 360) at the base of this layer, directly above the husmas, as well as four concentrations of burnt stones that may be additional small hearths (Loc. 358). The edge of Loc. 370, most of which is in Square G/13, was also found here. At the base of the square, light yellow sterile husmas sediment was exposed. 52</page><page sequence="62">THE STRATIGRAPHY SQUARE E/15 Only the northeastern half of the square was preserved. The topsoil (Loc. 70) consisted of sand. Below it, the Neolithic layer (Loc. 71) was dark brown and clayey. The layer sloped down toward the east by about 30 cm. At the base of the layer three hearths were found (Loc. 83, 84, 85; Photo 35) directly above the virgin soil. At the base of the square, light yellow sterile husmas sediment was exposed. SQUARE F/15 The topsoil of the square (Loc. 1) consisted of sand. Below it, in the Neolithic layer, two phases were detected. The upper one was light brown in color and about 10-40 cm thick. The lower one was dark brown and clayey, and about 10-20 cm thick. The contact between the two was not clear- cut and about 10 cm were defined as transitional. The layers sloped down towards the northeast, with the western side being about 30 cm higher and the southern about 70 cm higher. A series of hearths was associated with the transitional layer (Loc. 246, 247, 249, 261). On the lower Neolithic level, directly above the virgin soil, a few remains associated with activities were discerned: hearths (Loc. 260, 262; Photo 36) and a large dwelling pit (Loc. 258; Photo 37). The dwelling pit was about 50 cm deep and the remains of a few hearths were unearthed on its base. At the base of the square, light yellow sterile husmas sediment was exposed. SQUARE G/15 The topsoil of the square consisted of sand (Loc. 1), including a modern trench, 10-20 years old (Loc. 288). Below this, dug into the Neolithic sediments, were four pits (Loc. 293, 302, 304, 305). They were full of sand containing Roman/Byzantine Photo 35. Pit 85 in Square E/15. Photo 36.

An additional bell-shaped pit was dug down to virgin soil and contained darker sand and Late Chalcolithic potsherds (Loc. 296). Below the sand was a dark brown, compact Neolithic layer (Loc. 285, 287). The layer was 20- 50 cm thick and sloped down towards the southeast, with the western part being about 40 cm higher and the northern part about 30 cm higher. A few Late Chalcolithic potsherds were found intruding into Loc. 285. An installation constructed from three large stones (Loc. 322) was associated with this layer. Another element is Loc. 307, an elliptical lump of burnt clay, about 30 cm long, red/orange outside and black inside. A similar lump was found in the center of the square. Below this was a darker layer (Loc. 329, 332). It was about 10-40 cm thick and sloped down towards the northeast, with the western part being about 50 cm higher and the southern part about 20 cm higher. Two hearths (Loc. 328, 339; Photo 38) were associated with this layer, as well as three pits dug into the virgin soil (Loc. 337, 347, 361). Pit 361 was found below Hearth 339. At the base of the square, light yellow sterile husmas sediment was exposed. SQUARE D/16 Most of this square had been completely destroyed by modern construction before the excavation started; only the southeast corner was preserved. This area was badly disturbed by an electricity post, probably erected around the 1970s. A shallow pit (Loc. 89a) dug into the sterile husmas sediment Photo 38. Hearth 339 in Square E/15. contained no finds. Like similar pits in Square D/17, this pit should probably be dated to the Roman/ Byzantine period. SQUARE E/16 The southeastern corner of the square was not preserved. The topsoil (Loc. 70) consisted of sand and a modern brick wall (Loc. 72; Photo 28). The wall and its foundation trench cut through the Neolithic layer into the virgin soil. Below it, the Neolithic layer (Loc. 71) was dark brown and clayey. The layer was about 10-50 cm thick (thicker in the east) and sloped down towards the east, with the western part being about 40 cm higher. At the base of the layer were seven hearths (Loc. 73, 76, 78, 79, 80, 81, 94), built directly above the virgin soil or in shallow pits dug into it. Four additional pits were dug into the virgin soil, two of them circular (Loc. 77, 95) and two bell-shaped (Loc. 74, 75; Photos 26, 39). Although the two bell-shaped pits are the only examples found in our excavations, they are similar to pits unearthed by Perrot (Chapter 1 , Fig. 4). They were found near the top of the cliff in the western part of the square, partly destroyed by development activities in the vicinity prior to our excavation. A large dwelling pit, consisting of a shallow depression in the virgin soil (Loc. 245), had an elongated asymmetrical shape and continued into Square F/16. Its sides were oblique and the fill was very dark clayey sediment. Near the western edge of the depression were two small hearths, Loc. 78 in the north and Loc. 81 in the south. In the eastern part of the depression were small concentrations of burnt stones. The sparse finds included flints and animal bones. At the base of the square, light yellow sterile husmas sediment was exposed. SQUARE F/16 The topsoil of the square (Loc. 1), which consisted of sand, incorporated a modern trench (Loc. 288). The topsoil covered two pits full of sand containing Roman/Byzantine potsherds (Loc. 414, 415). Below it, in the Neolithic layer, two phases were detected. The upper one was light brown color and about 10- 40 cm thick, while the lower one was dark brown 54</page><page sequence="64">THE STRATIGRAPHY Photo 39. Pits 74 and 75 in Square E/16. and clayey, and about 10-30 cm thick. The contact between the two was not clear-cut and about 20 cm were defined as transitional. The layers slope down towards the northeast, with the western side being about 50 cm higher and the southern part about 20-30 cm higher. Three hearths were associated with the transitional phase (Loc. 238, 243, 244). A pit (Loc. 259; Photo 40) was dug from the lower phase and into the virgin soil. A large dwelling pit (Loc. 245) extends into this square from Square E/16. At the base of the square, light yellow sterile husmas sediment was exposed. SQUARE G/16 The topsoil of the square (Loc. 1), which consisted of sand, incorporated a modern trench (Loc. 288). Below it was a partly disturbed brown Neolithic layer (Loc. 284), 10-20 cm thick and sloping down by 10-20 cm towards the east. Below it was a darker layer, about 10-30 cm thick, which we divided into two units, Loc. 300 in the southeastern corner and Loc. 306 in the rest of the square. The two were Photo 40. Pit 259 in Square F/16. 55</page><page sequence="65">CHAPTER FIVE Photo 41. Neolithic layers 324 and 330 in Square G/16. distinguished by a slight difference in color. The layer below Loc. 300 (Loc. 317) was identical to Loc. 306; thus Loc. 317 and 306 covered the whole square and apparently reflect the same depositional process. Loc. 317 was about 30-50 cm thick and sloped down by 20 cm towards the east. Below it, we exposed a layer of hard sand in the middle of the square. In the northern part of the square, a dark layer was found, sloping steeply towards the northeast (Loc. 315). Below it was a pit dug into the virgin soil, with a hearth on its base (Loc. 338). In the southern part of the square, a dark brown layer containing pockets of sand was discerned (Loc. 324, 330, 331; Photo 41). This layer was about 10-40 cm thick and sloped down by 20 cm towards the southeast. Several hearths were found, three directly above the virgin soil (Loc. 328, 327, 314), one at the base of Loc. 317 (Loc. 326) and one at the top of Loc. 317 (Loc. 316). Hearth 328, most of which was in Square G/15, was nearly 1 m long. At the base of the square, light yellow sterile husmas sediment was exposed. In Square G/16, therefore, at least three stages of hearth construction and at least four stages of deposition were discerned. SQUARE D/17 Only 7 m2 were excavated on the northeastern side of this square. One modern disturbance (Loc. 91) and two Byzantine pits (Loc. 89, 90) were found, all three features dug through the Neolithic layer and into the virgin soil. The Neolithic layer was not well preserved and survived only as a layer of brown clayey sediment about 2-3 cm thick. At the base of the square, light yellow sterile husmas sediment (Loc. 97) was exposed. SQUARE E/17 The topsoil of the square (Loc. 1), which consisted of sand, incorporated a modern sewer trench dug into Neolithic sediment (Loc. 288). Below it, the Neolithic layer was dark brown and clayey. The layer was about 10-60 cm thick (thicker on the east) and sloped down toward the southeast, with the northwestern end being about 40 cm higher. At the base of the layer five hearths (Loc. 86, 87, 96, 222, 223; Photos 42-43) were built directly above the virgin soil, together with another possibly scattered hearth (Loc. 88/93). A single pit (Loc. 92) was dug into the virgin soil, directly below Loc. 88/93, probably as part of the same installation. At the base of the square, light yellow sterile husmas sediment was exposed.

Below that were three pits, full of sand containing Roman/Byzantine potsherds (Loc. 411, 412, 413). Below, in the Neolithic layer, two phases were detected. The upper one was light brown in color and about 20-50 cm thick, while the lower one was dark brown and clayey, and about 10-30 cm thick. The contact between the two was not clear-cut and about 10-20 cm were defined as transitional. The layers sloped down towards the northeast, with the western part being about 40 cm higher and the southern part about 20-30 cm higher. Two hearths (Loc. 235, 236; Photos 44-45) were associated with the transitional phase. Directly below one of them, and immediately above the virgin soil, was another hearth (Loc. 254; Photo 46). Two additional hearths (Loc. 237, 242; Photo 47) were also built directly above the virgin soil. At the base of the square, light yellow sterile husmas sediment was exposed. Photo 44.

SQUARE G/17 The topsoil of the square (Loc. 1) consisted of sand. Below that were three pits, full of sand containing Roman/Byzantine potsherds (Loc. 279, 417, 418). The pits were dug into the Neolithic layer below. The Neolithic layer consisted of brown clayey material. The top of it was light-colored, loose, and mixed with some sand (Loc. 278), while the base of the layer was darker and more compact (Loc. 303). 57</page><page sequence="67">CHAPTER FIVE The layer was 20-50 cm thick and sloped down by 30 cm towards the east. Below it, three different units were found. In the center of the square was a patch of mixed sediments (clay with sand) that created a spotty matrix (Loc. 319). In the east very dark sediment (Loc. 318) was found. In the west the sediment (Loc. 320) was also dark brown, compact, and clayey, with some small lumps of burnt clay and abundant flint and animal bones. Below Loc. 320, a living floor (Loc. 334) was found in the southwest corner of the square. It was 2-5 cm thick and made of very light-colored crushed material, probably husmas. The few centimeters of the floor were rich in finds. Below the floor was a dark brown layer (Loc. 336). The lower part of Loc. 336 was mixed with husmas, like Loc. 338 in Square G/18. The layer was about 50-80 cm thick and sloped down by 30-50 cm toward the northeast. Virgin soil was found below. While in the southwestern corner of the square the virgin soil was exposed, in the central and northern parts the Neolithic sediment continues downwards. Here a very dark ashy sediment was found (Loc. 348). This sediment accumulated in a large natural depression in the husmas continuing into Squares G/18 and G/19. It was about 10-50 cm thick and sloped sharply down by about 70 cm toward the north. Several installations were found here: Pit 342 and five hearths (Loc. 335, 340, 341, 343, 344; Photos 48-51).

The Neolithic layer, as well as the husmas , sloped down towards the southeast, the northeastern part being about 30 cm higher. The Neolithic layer was 20-40 cm thick. At the base of the layer three hearths (Loc. 218, 219, 224; Photo 52) were found, all three built immediately on top of the husmas or dug into it. At the base of the square, light yellow sterile husmas sediment was exposed. SQUARE E/18 The topsoil of the square (Loc. 1) consisted of sand. Below it was a pit full of sand containing Roman/Byzantine potsherds (Loc. 410a). This pit was dug into the Neolithic layer. The dark brown, clayey Neolithic layer was 20-60 cm thick and sloped down toward the east, with the western part being about 50 cm higher. Four hearths (Loc. 55, 207, 220, 221; Photo 53) were built directly on the husmas, and one large pit (Loc. Photo 52. Hearths 218 and 219 in Square D/18. Photo 53. Hearth 207 in Square E/18. 419) was dug into the husmas. At the base of the square, light yellow sterile husmas sediment was exposed. SQUARE F/18 The topsoil of the square (Loc. 1) consisted of sand. Six pits (Loc. 405, 406, 407, 408, 409, 410) were found below it, dug into the Neolithic layer. They were full of sand containing Roman/Byzantine potsherds. Below, in the Neolithic layer, two phases were detected. The layers sloped down towards the northeast, with the western part being about 60 cm higher and the southern part about 30 cm higher. The upper phase was light brown in color and about 10-40 cm thick, while the lower phase was dark brown and clayey, and about 10-50 cm thick. The contact between the two was not clear-cut and about 10-20 cm were defined as transitional. Three hearths (Loc. 239, 240, 241) were associated with the transitional sediments, while another hearth (Loc. 252; Photos 54 right, 55) was built directly above the husmas and associated with the lower darker phase. Below the darker phase, a patch of husmas was of different matrix (Loc. 276). Below it, a burial pit (Loc. 253; Photo 54 left) was found. Loc. 276 probably represents material dug out for the burial and spread around. At the base of the square, light yellow sterile husmas sediment was exposed. SQUARE G/18 The topsoil of the square (Loc. 1) consisted of sand. Below it was a light brown layer (Loc. 267, 269). Below this layer was a wall (Loc. 100; Photos 56-57), running from northeast to southwest and continuing into the unexcavated area. The fill to the east of the wall was designated Loc. 365 and that to the west of the wall Loc. 286. They do not differ in character from the loci above. A floor (Loc. 364; Photos 57-58) was found running up to the wall. It was 2-3 cm thick and made of very light-colored crushed material. The few centimeters immediately above the floor were very rich in finds and included a small concentration of burnt stones and sediments (Loc. 376), probably the remains of a hearth. Near the wall was a group of fallen mud bricks, each with a rounded contour (Loc. 369). 59</page><page sequence="69">CHAPTER FIVE Photo 54. Hearth 252 (right) and Burial 253 (left) in Square F/18.

The fill was light brown in color and very similar to the sediments above the floor level. It was about 70-110 cm thick and sloped down by 20^40 cm towards the east. Below it was a dark brown, clayey, and compact layer (Loc. 379). This layer was 30 cm to 1 m thick and sloped down by about 1 m towards the east. Six hearths (Loc. 393, 394, 395, 396, 397, 401; Photos 59-60) and one pit (Loc. 380) were found, all associated with Loc. 379. They were located at the base of this layer and sometimes dug into the earlier fill. Hearth 397 was directly below Wall 100. The stratigraphie position of the hearths and pit indicates that the accumulation of sediments in the deep depression below them belonged to an early phase. Below this was a series of interbedded layers, some light-colored and containing mostly sand and husmas and some dark-colored and containing Photo 59. Hearth 393 in Square G/18. Photo 60.

The two were interlocked both vertically and horizontally and were very difficult to separate into lenses. The light sediments of all phases were numbered Loc. 388 (Photo 61) and 'the dark Loc. 348 A. Because of the technical difficulty of separating the two, some mixture occurred. At the base of this unit was a dark sediment filling a shallow depression in the husmas ; it contained many finds, including several stone tools (percussors) and a secondary burial (Loc. 402). At the base of the square, light yellow sterile husmas sediment was exposed. SQUARE D/19 Only a strip 3 m wide in the east of the square was preserved. The topsoil (Loc. 1) sloped down to the northeast. Below it, the Neolithic layer was dark brown and clayey.

Within the sediments of this layer, Wall 100 was identified. The layer was about 30-90 cm thick and sloped down by 20-30 cm towards the east. A deep, round pit (Loc. 359/387; Photo 64) was dug into this layer, cutting through all the earlier accumulation down to the husmas. Below the light brown layer, a dark brown compact layer (Loc. 349) was found. This layer was about 40-60 cm thick and sloped down by 40-50 cm towards the southeast. Seven hearths were associated with the base of this layer (Loc. 362, 363, 381, 382, 383, 384; Photos 64-65).

Part of a wall (Loc. 100) was found associated with the upper, lighter sediments. A hearth (Loc. 255) was found directly under the wall but still in the sediments of the upper phase, indicating the existence of at least two sub-phases that were not manifested in a difference in the sediment matrix. Four hearths (Loc. 231, 232, 233, 256; Photos 69-70) were built directly above the husmas, probably in two sub-phases of construction. They are associated with the sediments of the lower phase and are interconnected. At the base of the square, light yellow sterile husmas sediment was exposed.

After the stratigraphie analysis presented in Chapter 5, which dissected the site into individual squares, we will now present the complete picture of the spatial distribution of the Neolithic occupation. Various aspects will be presented and analyzed, including site formation processes that affected the accumulation and distribution of the Neolithic material, the various installations and features according to sub-phase, and the intra-site variability including the data from Perrot's excavation of 1955. The figures and photographs accompanying the text show excavation squares (5 x 5 m) and larger excavation areas, rather than the specific features illustrated in Chapter 5. Where relevant, reference is made to photographs in Chapter 5. Additional spatial analysis is presented in Chapter 13, where various categories of finds are examined. 6.1. SITE FORMATION PROCESSES IN NEOLITHIC ASHKELON Five main factors affected the natural and cultural accumulation in our excavation area: 1. The natural topography. The site is situated on a kurkar ridge and its western part is higher than its east. In the Neolithic period the virgin soil was not level but sloped from west to east (Photo 84). The lower parts of the site, in the east, are more sheltered from wind. In addition, there were three natural deeper depressions in the east (Photo 85). 2. The local sediments. The basic local sediment, the virgin soil of the site, is husmas , eroded kurkar sandstone. The final product of its erosion is sand. In addition, sand is deposited by the nearby Mediterranean Sea. The sand is a rather unstable matrix that is easily transferred by wind; winter storms can move sand dunes from place to place in only a few hours. 3. Proximity to the sea. The site is currently situated approximately 100 m from the Mediterranean Sea and 13 m above sea level. In the Neolithic period, however, it was much further inland, 700 m or so and about 20 m above sea level. This raises an interesting question with regard to the large quantities of seashells unearthed in the Neolithic layer. How did several thousand Mediterranean seashells accumulate in the Neolithic site's sediment? Was this a natural process or did the ancient inhabitants bring them to the site? 4. The nature of the occupation. In the Neolithic period (as in the Late Chalcolithic and Roman/Byzantine periods) no structures were built, apart from one wall. The main construction activities were the creation of small hearths and the digging of pits. The site apparently served as a seasonal campsite. Thus, no building materials, such as stones or mud bricks, were brought into the site in meaningful quantities. The accumulation was mainly natural, local sand deposited by wind. 5. An unknown Epi-Paleolithic site. Judging by the large quantity of intrusive microliths found in the Neolithic layers, a currently unknown Epi- Paleolithic site probably existed somewhere on the kurkar ridge, not far from the Neolithic site. The cumulative effect of these factors was the final deposition of the archaeological material: 1. Humans were responsible for some of the accumulation in the site. They transported stones, 69</page><page sequence="79">CHAPTER SIX Photo 84. The natural slope from west to east of the virgin soil, looking south. Photo 85. The northern and central depressions m the eastern part of the site after the entire western part of the excavation had been removed, looking east. 70</page><page sequence="80">THE NEOLITHIC OCCUPATION mud bricks, flint, stone artifacts, animal meat and bones, seashells, and combustible materials. The construction of hearths and a wall added transported materials, while the digging of pits disturbed local sediments. The organic materials and burning resulted in a dark-colored anthropomorphic sediment. Numerous lumps of clay were burnt red/orange on the outside and black inside. 2. The location of the site on a kurkar ridge resulted in thicker accumulation in the lower downslope parts. Thus, in locations less than 20 m apart, 50 cm accumulated in the west and 2 m in the east. 3. Natural forces, mainly wind, water, and gravity, were already responsible for shaping the sediments during the occupation. The basic local matrix is sand, which was carried rapidly by the wind and was mixed with the anthropogenic sediments. Hearths, pits, and living surfaces were covered very rapidly. The naturally deposited sand is light in color. An outstanding aspect of the Neolithic site of Ashkelon is the enormous quantity of animal bones. These were found on the living surface in a good state of preservation. When bones are left in the open, they are usually destroyed quickly by dogs and human trampling, or crumble as a result of exposure to sunshine. The swift accumulation of sand at the site probably buried the bones when they were still fresh, creating good conditions of preservation. 4. The three depressions in the eastern part of the site were intensively used by the Neolithic inhabitants as shelters, and consequently the accumulation in them was thicker and darker than in other parts of the site. In one of them an earlier stage of occupation (IVc) could be distinguished. 5. During the Neolithic period material from an earlier Epi-Paleolithic site was transferred and redeposited in the Neolithic layer. No heavy Epi-Paleolithic flints were found, but only small microliths. This indicates sorting that differentiated between heavy and light components, and at Ashkelon this activity can best be attributed to the wind. As the microliths are evenly distributed in the site, they were naturally deposited together with the sand. 6. The Neolithic activity was not homogenous throughout the accumulation. Three discrete layers were detected in the excavations. The earliest stage of occupation (IVc) could be distinguished in one of the depressions in the eastern part of the site. The main layer (IVb) encompasses the various installations for which the virgin soil (husmas) served as a convenient platform. The few centimeters immediately above the husmas were markedly richer in finds than the rest of the sediment. It is far from certain, however, that the whole area was occupied simultaneously, and the deposition could well have been the result of consecutive occupations. The latest layer (IVa) is defined by a long wall and part of a floor. These layers represent only a small part of the Neolithic accumulation, the rest consisting of various "floating" installations and finds that were not related to any particular living surface. The accumulation above Layer IVb is quite extensive, with sub-layers of light sand, often sterile, between darker layers or isolated feature. The main question is how many occupation episodes can be distinguished in the area excavated by us in 1997 and 1998. In our opinion, three main seasonal exploitations can be identified. While more such events probably took place, they did not leave sufficient markers to be distinguished. 7. The living surfaces, as well as the hearths and pits, yielded material of marine origin. These include turtle bones (see Chapter 16), fish bones (see Chapter 17), seashells (see Chapter 18), and pumice (see Chapter 19). Pumice is a light volcanic material that floats in the sea and is naturally deposited on the Mediterranean shore. The turtles and fish were brought to the site as food, while the seashells and pumice were collected as exotic materials. While seashells are well known from prehistoric sites, to the best of our knowledge pumice has never been reported. 8. Post-depositional processes acted on the sediments after the abandonment of the site. The area must have suffered some degree of erosion, as the upper layer seems to be missing at the top of the kurkar ridge, especially in Perrot's excavation (see below). Note also that the Late Chalcolithic and Roman/Byzantine pits were dug directly into the 71</page><page sequence="81">CHAPTER SIX Neolithic layer, without any accumulation between them. Thus, after the Neolithic period the area was not further covered by sand. In summary, detailed study of the accumulation in the various squares shows a consistent stratigraphie picture. The upper part of the Neolithic accumulation is lighter in color, contains more sand and usually lacks installations; however, it does contain the only evidence for built architecture in the site. The deeper sediments are darker. In the western part of the site the contact between the darker and lighter units is not very well defined. Most of the hearths were constructed at the base of the darker units and on top of the husmas ; only a few hearths "floated" in higher locations in the site's sediment. In the deep depressions the accumulation of debris appears to predate the construction of the hearths. These data lead to the conclusion that the horizon of the hearths is essentially a single phase. It could be postulated that in the western part of the site, where only one phase was discerned, the presence of hearths indicates that it is parallel to the darker lower phase in the eastern part of the site. Thus a schematic division into three phases can be made. The lower phase (IVc) contains the sediments in the depression. The middle phase (IVb) contains the hearths horizon with the darker sediments. The upper phase (IVa) contains a wall, a related floor and the lighter sediments. 6.2. THE SUB-PHASES AND THEIR CHARACTER 1. LAYER IVa This is the latest Neolithic phase, varying in thickness between 20 cm and about one meter. The layer does not cover the whole excavated area, but was found only in its eastern part. Erosion has probably shaved it in the higher western parts, as was the case in Perrot's excavations (see below). The position of the later pits indicates that this occurred before the Roman period and is not the result of modern intervention. The sediment is light brown and mixed with sand; the finds are mainly flints and bones. The layer comprises one long wall (about 17 m were uncovered, and it continues into the unexcavated area), a floor associated with it, and two pits. Some of the many hearths uncovered in the site do not have a clear stratigraphie context and may belong to this layer. Wall 100: A wall running northwest to southeast was exposed over 17 m in Squares F/ 19-20 and G/18-19 (Figs. 7, 12). It continues into the Fig. 12.

The wall is about 80 cm thick where fully preserved in its eastern part, and it is largely built from local kurkar rocks laid as two faces (Photos 56-57, 86-89). Plano-convex sun-dried mud bricks were found both integrated in the wall and fallen beside it (Fig. 13; Photos 90-91). The preservation of the wall is poor except in Square G/18, where it was better preserved, together with part of a floor related to it and dating it to the Neolithic period. This wall was apparently an enclosure wall of some kind. Floor 364: This floor is associated with Wall 100. The floor is made of whitish material (probably ground limestone) containing fragments of kurkar. It is 2-3 cm thick. Above the floor was a layer of very dark and compact sediment, rich in finds, including flint tools, bones, and an obsidian artifact (Photos 57-58, 88-89, 92). Pit 359: This is a deep pit, 1 m in diameter and 1.2 m deep (Photo 64). The pit is dug through Layer IVb sediments and all the way down to the virgin soil. In it were found flints, bones, and a broken grinding slab. Photo 87. The central part of Wall 100. 73</page><page sequence="83">PHAPTFR SIX Photo 88. The southeast part of Wall 100, with Floor 364 in the foreground. Photo 89. Close-up of Wall 100 and Floor 364. Hearths: Although not a single hearth could be clearly associated with this layer, several hearths were found at a high level above the husmas and thus postdating the main occupation of Layer IVb. These hearths can be assigned either to Layer IVa or to a very short episode postdating Layer IVb and predating Layer IVa. The following hearths are in such a position: 235, 236, 238, 239, 240, 241 , 243, 244, 246, 247, 249, 251, 255, 261. 2. LAYER IVb The main Neolithic layer, encountered throughout the excavated area, is IVb (Figs. 14-16). On the virgin soil, and sometimes 10-20 cm above it, we found occupational surfaces exceptionally rich in finds. The layer's thickness varies between 20 cm in the western part of the site and 50 cm in the eastern part. The sediment is dark brown in color and mostly anthropogenic in origin. The main finds are flints and large quantities of animal bones. Photo 90. The plano-convex bricks of Wall 100. Photo 91. Close-up of the bricks of Wall 100. Photo 92. Close-up of Floor 364. 74</page><page sequence="84">THE NEOLITHIC OCCUPATION Fig. 13. Plan of bricks fallen from Wall 100 (Loc. 369). This layer contains many installations (about 90 hearths, about 30 pits, and two burials), but no architecture. Concentrations of pits and hearths were found in Squares E/16 and E/17 (Photo 93), in and around Square F/21 (Photos 94-96), in Square G/15 (Photo 97), in Square G/17 (Photos 98-99), and in Square G/18 (Photo 100). The concentration of hearths in Square F/21 is the largest in our excavation. Both the large number of hearths and the character of thessediment attest to the intensive burning activities carried out during the accumulation of this layer. In some cases we detected multi-phase installations, for instance one hearth above another. Likewise, we cannot tell whether the entire excavated area (about 800 m2) was occupied at the same time or represents different spatially overlapping occupations. The lack of architecture of any kind and the abundance of installations reflect the specialized character of the excavated area. Layer IVb is the main occupational phase of the site. It lies immediately above the virgin soil except in the deep depression, where it lies above Layer IVc. It contains most of the installations unearthed, primarily in its lower part, which is also the richest part of the site in terms of material culture. Two basic types of installations exist in Neolithic Ashkelon: hearths and pits. Each category will be examined below. Hearths Altogether there are some 90 hearths in Layer IVb, distributed more or less evenly over the excavated area. They belong to three main types: a Simple round hearth, full of ash, usually inside a shallow pit dug into the husmas layer (Loc. 76, 81, 84, 88, 94, 96). b Built hearth, circular or oval in shape. In some cases the preservation is poor and the shape is not clear. The hearths are built from small stones. Between the stones is burnt sediment containing burnt bones, flints, and sometimes lumps of baked clay. This type of hearth may be constructed directly on ground level or inside a shallow pit (Loc. 55, 56, 73, 78, 79, 80, 83, 85, 86, 203, 207, 21 1-224, 235-244, 246, 247, 249, 250, 254, 255, 257, 260-262, 271-273, 316, 323, 326-328, 335, 343, 354, 360, 362, 363, 370, 378, 381, 383, 384, 391, 393-396, 400, 401,420). Detailed plans of Loc. 223, 235, 335, 391 and 393-396 appear in Figs. 17-20, 24. c Hearth with circular red/orange border. These hearths were constructed from stones in a very similar way to hearths of Type b, but always inside a shallow pit. During use the edge of the pit was baked by the fire and acquired a red/orange color (Loc. 225-233, 252, 256, 292, 340, 344, 382, 397). Detailed plans of the two phases of Loc. 397 are presented in Figs. 20-21. The difference between this category and the previous one is functional rather than typological, since the hearths in this category were more intensively used. A concentration of eight large hearths of this type was uncovered in the northern part of the excavation (Loc. 225- 232, 275). These hearths, built inside shallow pits (Fig. 22), are sometimes interconnected and in one case also connected to a pit. Pits Pits of several types were uncovered: a Simple pit, medium in size, rounded shape, shallow, usually dug into the husmas layer (Loc. 75</page><page sequence="85">CHAPTER SIX Fig. 14.

Detailed plans of Loc. 333 and 390 are presented in Figs. 23-24. b Bell-shaped pit. Two such pits (Loc. 74 and 75) were found in the western section of the site, which was partly damaged by development works (Photo 39; Chapter 5, Fig. 11). One of the pits is about 70 cm deep and the other about 90 cm deep. These pits were probably used for storage. c Burial pit. A shallow pit (Loc. 253), about 2 m long and 1 m wide, was dug into the husmas. Inside the pit were the remains of several individuals in a secondary burial. The burial 81</page><page sequence="91">CHAPTER SIX Fig. 17. Hearth 223. Fig. 18. Hearth 235. Fig. 19. Hearth 335. Fig. 20. Hearths 393-397. Fig. 21.

This is a shallow depression dug into the virgin soil and the sides are oblique. Near the western side of the depression were two small hearths, Loc. 78 in the north and Loc. 81 in the south. On the eastern side of the depression were small concentrations of burnt stones. The finds are sparse and include flints and animal bones. Loc. 258 is a second large pit dug into the virgin soil (see section, Fig. 25). On the base of the pit were the remains of several hearths made of small and medium-sized burnt stones. On the western side of the pit was another connected pit containing numerous animal bones and some flints. Loc. 263 is an exceptionally large (3.5 x 2.5 m) pit in the form of a shallow elliptical depression. Fig. 24. Pit 390 and Hearth 391. The sides are oblique. The fill consists of the dark clayey sediment typical of the Neolithic occupation with a few bones and flints, but no signs of burning. All three of these pits are large enough to have served as dwellings, and on the base of two of them were small hearths, supporting such an assumption. Living surfaces The hearths and the pits are all part of a living surface exceptionally rich in finds, its thickness varying between 20 cm in the west and 50 cm in the eastern part of the site. The sediment is dark brown, mostly of anthropogenic origin (Photos 101-102). 83</page><page sequence="93">CHAPTER SIX Fig. 25. Cross-section through Square F/15. The main finds are flints and large quantities of animal bones (Photos 103-109). In the eastern part of the site three natural depressions were found. The largest (Loc. 348) is in the east, in Squares G/17-19; for a detailed plan of it and the various installations see Fig. 26. The second depression was found mainly in Square G/15. The third, much smaller, depression is in Squares G/ll-12. 3. LAYER IVc This layer could be defined only in a limited area, in one of the deep natural depressions in the lower eastern part of the excavation area (Loc. 348). It represents sediments that accumulated swiftly inside the depression, with very dark material intercalating lighter sub-layers. This was found below the layer incorporating the hearths (IVb), Photo 101. The Neolithic living surface in Square G/12. Photo 102. The Neolithic living surface in Square H/12. Photo 103.

The time interval between these episodes is probably very short. In the lowest part of the depression is Pit 402, which contained a significant number of artifacts such as hammer stones, broken stone bracelets, animal bones, flint items, and parts of a secondary burial. The composition of the artifacts in the pit suggests that this was a waste pit as well as a burial pit. 6.3. INTRA-SITE VARIABILITY This section analyzes the data collected from Neolithic Ashkelon by the two expeditions that have worked at the site (Table 10). Dwelling pits. In the new excavations three large pits (Loc. 245, 258, 263) were found, irregular in shape but all over 2 m in diameter. At the base of Loc. 245, two hearths (Loc. 81, 82) were found, and at the base of Loc. 258, a concentration of animal bones and remains of hearths were uncovered. These pits are large enough to have served as dwellings, a conclusion supported by the hearths. In Perrot's excavations, eight such pits were found, all located close to one another. Bell-shaped pits. Two bell-shaped pits (Loc. 74 and 75; 70 cm and 90 cm deep respectively) were found in the western section of our excavation in the highest part of the area, closest to Perrot's excavations. They were badly damaged by the development works. In the area excavated by Perrot five such pits were found. It thus seems that the bell-shaped pits were concentrated at the top of the ridge. Simple pits. Pits of various sizes were found in our excavations, some irregular in outline, while others are round. Loc. 359, for example, is a deep pit (1 m in diameter, 1.2 m deep), dug into the virgin soil; flint artifacts, animal bones, and a Table 10. The main features at Neolithic Ashkelon.

The pits are scattered and distant from one another. In Perrot's excavations four simple pits, designated "basins", were found. Hearths. The most distinctive features uncovered in our excavations are 105 hearths, most lying directly on virgin soil, with some being recessed into the ground in shallow pits. The hearths are round or oval, constructed of medium-sized and small stones, densely laid and often touching one another. Between the stones is burnt sediment, containing burnt bones, burnt flints, and sometimes lumps of red/orange baked clay. In some cases the border of the pit has been colored red/orange by the effect of fire. The hearths are distributed in the entire area, with a concentration of eight large hearths uncovered in the northern part of the excavation (Loci 225-232, 275). These hearths are sometimes connected to each other and in one case to a pit as well. No hearths were discovered in Perrot's excavations. Wall. One wall (100) was found at the site, running northwest to southeast for 17 m and continuing into the unexcavated area to the east. The wall, ca. 80 cm thick, was constructed out of small local kurkar stones, laid as two faces. Some mud bricks were found both integrated in the wall and fallen beside it. The preservation of the wall is poor except in Square G/l 8, where part of a whitish floor, running up to the wall, was found. Neolithic flint artifacts found on the floor date both it and the wall to the Neolithic period. No walls were discovered in Perrot's excavations. Floor. One floor (364) was found in the new excavations, a small leveled surface associated with Wall 100. It is 2-3 cm thick and is made of whitish material, probably ground limestone, with fragments of kurkar. Above the floor was a layer of very dark and compact sediment, rich in finds, including an arrowhead, a denticulate sickle blade, an obsidian artifact, and animal bones. No floors were discovered in Perrot's excavations. Occupational surfaces. On virgin soil and some 10-20 cm above virgin soil we found occupational surfaces exceptionally rich in finds. These included large quantities of animal bones. Burials. Human remains were found in Perrot's excavation: remains from three individuals in a poor state of preservation were found in one pit (Perrot and Gopher 1996). In the new excavation seven new individuals were recognized, as well as over 70 isolated bones. The main skeletal remains were found in the following locations: 1 Pit 253 is a shallow feature (ca. 2 m long, 1 m wide) dug into the virgin soil and containing the remains of five individuals (H1-H5). The best- preserved burial included a skull, long bones, and many burned fragments (Fig. 27). 2 Pit 402 included some non-articulated skeletal parts of two individuals (H6 and H7). In addition, this pit contained a significant number of stone tools, broken stone bracelets, animal bones, and flint items. The composition of the sediment in the pit suggests that it was used for waste disposal. 3 Depression 348. 4 Neolithic Layer 349. 5 Neolithic Layer 373. 6 Neolithic Layer 379. 7 Neolithic Layer 388. 8 Hearth 327. 9 Hearth 335. 10 Hearth 382. An anthropological analysis of the skeletal remains is presented in Chapter 14, and the spatial distribution of the human remains is discussed in Chapter 13. Most of the human remains are concentrated in and around Depression 348. The excavations conducted by Perrot yielded different settlement features (Table 10) and a dissimilar stratigraphie picture. Features of three types were reported: eight dwelling pits, circular or oval (diameter 1.5-3 m; maximum depth 0.9 m), five bell-shaped silo pits (diameter of opening 0.5-0.6 m; maximum diameter 1.5 m; average depth 0.9 m), and four shallow "basins" (maximum diameter 1 m; maximum depth 0.5 m). Three main differences between these finds and the material unearthed by the new expedition should be noted: 1 Perrot's excavation yielded only sunken 87</page><page sequence="97">CHAPTER SIX Fig. 27. The burial of HI in Pit 253. installations (dwelling pits, bell-shaped pits, and "basins"). 2 Perrot's excavation did not yield hearths, while many were found in the new excavation. 3 In Perrot's excavation a layer of occupational debris was not discerned between the various pits. These striking differences in what is definitely the same site call for explanation. The answer lies, in our view, in two main factors. The first is the depositional history of the site. The area excavated by Perrot was at the top of the kurkar ridge, while the area excavated by us was on the eastern slope of the ridge. During the excavation it was noted that the layers become progressively thinner toward the western (upslope) side of the area, while becoming thicker toward the east. In Perrot's area at the top of the ridge, the living surface between the pits had apparently been eroded, most likely with the upper parts of the pits themselves. What had been preserved at the top of the kurkar ridge was only the lower parts of the sunken installations. The second factor is markedly different activity during the Neolithic occupation. While the area excavated by Perrot served mainly for dwelling and storage, in the new excavated area only two bell-shaped pits and three dwelling pits were found. Instead, two intensive activities took place in the new area: the construction of hearths and the accumulation of very large quantities of animal bones. The local topography and the proximity of the sea are important to the understanding of the spatial organization of the site. The virgin soil is not level but slopes, together with the kurkar ridge, from northwest to southeast. The Mediterranean is located northwest of the site, and this is the prevailing direction of wind and rain. Thus, the lower eastern parts of the site are more sheltered. The higher part of the site, from which there is a clear view of the entire seashore, seems to have been more intensively used for dwelling and for storage. Here eight out of 11 dwelling pits (73%) and five out of seven bell-shaped pits (71%) were found. On the eastern slope of the ridge, activities connected with meat processing took place. This area, relatively sheltered from the westerly wind, was more suitable for the fire and smoke needed for the processing of meat. Thus, the different activities resulted in a different pattern of archaeological features (Fig. 28). The last issue that still requires clarification is the total site size and how much of it was 88</page><page sequence="98">THE NEOLITHIC OCCUPATION Fig. 28. Schematic model of ultra-site spatial organization. occupied simultaneously. The Neolithic site was first surveyed and excavated by Perrot in the mid-1950s. At that time this area had not yet suffered from intensive modern development. Perrot estimated the size of the site as ca. 2 hectares, based on the distribution of Neolithic artifacts (Fig. 3). Ashkelon was occupied as a seasonal campsite, and it is likely that each time a somewhat different area was used. Nomadic groups using seasonal sites generally do not occupy a large area at any given time. Thus, taking into consideration the character of the human occupation, it seems quite clear that the two hectares represent the total accumulation created over a long period, probably at least several decades. 89</page><page sequence="99">PART III: THE FLINT INDUSTRY</page><page sequence="100">CHAPTER 7 THE FLINT KNAPPING TECHNOLOGY Down Dag 7.1. METHOD OF ANALYSIS The assemblage presented here includes all of the flint items retrieved. The basic collection unit was the basket, an excavation unit consisting either of one square meter and several to twenty centimeters deep, or of a smaller area within a specific locus. The flint items were retrieved during the excavation or by screening through three-millimeter mesh. Yosef Garfinkel and Avi Krauz first analyzed the small assemblage collected during the 1997 excavation season. Later I analyzed the large assemblage collected during the 1998 season, integrating within it the data of the 1997 season, and reexamined the tools and cores of the first season, but not the debitage (Dag 2001). The various phases of the Neolithic occupation do not differ technologically or typologically from one another (Appendix B). The same is true for Neolithic flints retrieved from later contexts, i.e. flint redeposited in Chalcolithic or Roman-Byzantine pits. Thus, the assemblage will be discussed as a single unit, excluding the intrusive Epi-Paleolithic artifacts, which are presented in Appendix C. The assemblage was divided into the following principal waste categories: Primary elements: Items with more than 30% of cortex on the dorsal face. Flakes: Items with a length to width ratio smaller than 2:1. Blades: Items wider than 12 mm and with a length to width ratio larger than 2: 1. Bladelets: Items shorter than 50 mm, narrower than 12 mm, and with a length to width ratio larger than 2:1. Chips: Items smaller than 15 mm. Chunks: Items without a ventral face, and items broken or burnt to the extent that they were not identifiable. Cores: Items without a ventral face and with more than three removal scars. Core trimming elements (CTEs): Items that served for core preparation and maintenance. Burin spalls: Items with a triangular/rectangular cross-section that have, beside their own ventral face, another face that is part of a ventral face. Axe spalls: Items that show evidence of bifacial shaping and/or polish. Tools: Any items modified after their detachment by retouch longer than 10 mm, burin removal, bifacial flaking, etc. Usewear: Items retouched on less than 10 mm or items with regular edge damage. Varia: Items not fitting any of the above categories, such as rolled items, small flint pebbles, tabular flint waste, etc. Broken items were classified according to the assumed morphology of the complete item. Thus, for example, broken bladelets less than 15 mm long were counted as bladelets rather than chips (where the estimated length of the complete item exceeded 15 mm). Broken and burnt items were counted (per basket for the 1997 season and per category within the basket for the 1998 season). The flint was weighed (per basket for the 1997 season and per category within the basket for the 1998 season) as a means of evaluating size. Weight, rather than length, width, or thickness, was selected to represent size because: a) it gives a better index of efficiency of exploitation; b) the irregular 93</page><page sequence="101">CHAPTER SEVEN shapes of the items make any single measurement inaccurate and weight is a better indicator of size than any combination of the other measurements; c) weighing is a time-saving measurement. The cores, CTEs, and tools underwent further analysis that included observations on the raw material, preservation condition, amount of cortex, and typological classification. Further variables were observed as well. For the cores the maximum length was measured, the number of scars was counted, and the last removal was defined as a flake or a blade or bladelet removal. The CTEs were defined as bladelike or flakelike. The tools were observed (according to type) for the type, position, and intensity of retouch. Some specific cases (such as arrowheads and bifaces) were also measured for length, width, and thickness. The typology used for the cores and tools followed that used for the PPNC site of Tel 'Ali (Garfinkel 1994) in order to enable comparisons. 7.2. THE ASSEMBLAGE COMPOSITION Altogether, 36,786 flint items were recovered at Ashkelon. While some items are very fresh, others are patinated with a white patina typical of sandy sediments. Table 11 shows the composition of the principal waste categories. The industry is clearly flake-oriented, with a flake to blade/bladelet ratio of 3.7:1. A total of 232 cores was found, with a ratio per core of 158.2 items, of which 2.9 are CTEs and 10.4 are tools. The high proportion of waste to cores attests to the degree of core exploitation. 54.1% of the flint items (excluding debris) were broken either during knapping or as a result of post-depositional processes. Blades and bladelets were broken more often than other categories. Tools and items with usewear were also often broken, but considering their blank composition the pattern is similar to the waste. 16.8% of the waste was burnt, with a very high amount of burnt debris. Again, there is no marked difference between tools and waste; the low frequency of burnt items with usewear is probably due to the difficulty of identifying them when the item is burnt. The assemblage was weighed as a whole and reached a total of 76,945 g. The entire assemblage thus represents no more than a few man-loads of flint. The weight of flint brought to the site would have been only a small fraction of the weight of other materials, like stones or meat. Such small loads certainly posed no real problem of raw material acquisition. In theory the inhabitants of Neolithic Ashkelon could have brought the required Table 11.

Note that the final estimation (76,269 g) is very close to the actual weight of the entire assemblage (76,945 g), an error of less than 1%. quantities from the best-quality outcrops. The fact that they did not do so indicates that it did not rate highly on their list of priorities. A large sample was weighed according to waste categories. Table 12 presents the results of this sample. Although the flake to blade ratio is the same as in the count, the assemblage's picture is slightly different for weight than for count. Obviously, the chips and bladelets are relatively light. In contrast, the chunks, CTEs, and cores are relatively heavy. The primary elements are heavy as a result of a decrease in the item's size along the reduction sequence. The most significant fact is that tools weigh even more than the primary elements and almost as much as the CTEs, indicating a selection of large items as blanks for the tools. The weight of the items gives an indication of the efficiency of flint exploitation. Tools (including items with usewear) account for 21% of the flint weight and a similar proportion forms the non- usable component of the assemblage (debris and cores). In this respect, artifact counts give a biased picture, with 9% tools and 4 1 % non-usable items. 7.3. RAW MATERIALS At Ashkelon, as in the entire southern coastal plain of Israel, flint is not found in primary geological context. The main sources of raw material are conglomerates of the Ahuzam Formation and the nearby streambeds that carry raw material from the Hebron Mountains (see Chapter 3). Both sources contain flint nodules, originating in formations of Eocene age and in the Mishash Formation, in secondary deposition. Since the water energy of the streambeds is very low after they pass through the coastal plain, the only nodules available are small ones (about fist-size or smaller). The few tested nodules found on site represented the typical nodule. Many of both the cores and the primary elements display battered cortex, evidence for the use of small river pebbles. Naturally, the exploitation of small nodules poses severe limitations on the reduction sequence. Similar constraints of raw material are found in sites dated as early as the Lower Paleolithic (Marder et al. 1998). The raw material sources are several kilometers away from the site, making procurement difficult. 95</page><page sequence="103">CHAPTER SEVEN Table 13.

Some of the blades seem to have been manufactured from a different kind of raw material. On some of these fresh cortex indicates production from primarily deposited nodules, while in others their length indicates that they were not made from small nodules. This is an indication for at least some import to the site, as is the case for raw materials such as tabular flint and obsidian. Flint of five main types was used at Ashkelon: 1 Flint of the Mishash Formation. Flint of this kind is usually badly cracked and contains many chalk inclusions. It is therefore not convenient to work with, although the flint itself, when pure, is of a very fine quality. It is very fine-grained with a translucent gray /brown color. Flint of the Mishash Formation was found in various states of preservation at the site. When fresh it presents a translucent quality, when exposed it develops patches of white patina, and further patination may cover the entire surface of the item with white patina. A process of calcification occurs simultaneously. 2 Gray-brown flint, sometimes with yellowish or reddish narrow veins. It is medium-grained and usually of quite good quality, without many cracks or limestone inclusions. It probably originates in formations of Eocene age. 3 Chert of very poor quality. The chert is gray and coarse-grained, with many white (chalky) and dark inclusions (an indication that it too may originate in the Mishash Formation). 4 Purple-pink flint, with a very high-quality, smooth, and oily surface. This raw material did not serve for cores (neither cores or CTEs of this material were found). If it was heat treated, blanks rather than nodules were treated, or end products treated elsewhere were imported to the site. 5 Tabular flint 3-14 mm thick, cortical on both sides. The flint is fine-grained and gray/brown in color. The frequencies of the different types of flint are presented in Table 13. The most abundant types are the gray-brown and Mishash, together forming about 85% of the assemblage. Chert was not used intensively, probably due to the poor quality of this raw material. Purple-pink and tabular flint were also found in small quantities; they were used only for tools and were probably imported to the site. The raw material breakdown attests to a local industry without intensive import of flint, despite the limitations imposed by the exploitation of small nodules. 7.4. CORES A total of 232 cores (0.6%) was found (Figs. 29- 35). All of them are made from local raw materials. There were remains of battered cortex on 153 of them. Where the diameter of the pebbles could be detected, it was small. The frequencies of the local raw materials used are very similar to those of the tool assemblage (Table 13). There is no selection of a specific raw material for a specific core type. 96</page><page sequence="104">THE FLINT KNAPPING TECHNOLOGY Fig. 29.

Cores: 1-2 amorphous; 3 core with one striking platform; 4 core on flake. Most of the cores were used very intensively and abandoned only when completely exploited. The average length (maximal) of the abandoned core is only 36.6 mm and the average weight is only 27.6 g. However, most cores are a little smaller and only a few much larger. Chert cores tend to be slightly larger but to have fewer scars; these cores are less exhausted, probably because of the poor quality of the raw material (Table 14). The small dimensions of the abandoned cores and the high degree of exploitation are partly due to scarcity of raw material. Eight types of core were defined, the relative frequencies of which are presented in Table 15. The following is a description of the various types 1. Cores with one striking platform (41 items, 17.7%; Figs. 29, 35:3) These are cores on which one striking platform is evident. The striking platform was usually shaped by a single blow that left the smooth surface of one scar. Only when needed was this striking platform further modified by small scars (e.g., Fig. 29:5). In 32 cases small flakes were removed from the entire perimeter, leaving a more or less ovoid striking Table 14. Length and weight of cores by raw material.

In many cases (e.g., Fig. 29:1) there is evidence for scars originating in previous striking platforms, although no remains of the striking platform itself survive. A slightly different method of exploitation is evident in Fig. 29:4, where the exploitation is from only one side of the core, leaving the other side completely unexploited and thus cortical. The final result is a very flat core with one scarred face and one cortical face (nine such cores were found). All but two of the cores were exploited to the maximum and abandoned only when too small to be of further use, or when the striking platform was no longer suitable for further exploitation. Note, for example, the very small dimensions of the core in Fig. 29:3. This core, only 24 mm long and weighing only 7 g, is not the smallest found at Ashkelon. It is very likely that the last items removed from this core were unusable. 2. Cores with two (opposed) striking platforms (19 items, 8.2%; Figs. 30, 34:2) These are cores with two striking platforms, parallel to each other or at an angle sharper than 45°. The variants present in the cores with one striking platform also occur in this type. Twelve of the cores were used around the entire perimeter of the striking platform, creating a roughly cylindrical core (Figs. 30:3, 4; 34:2). Seven other cores were used on only one side, leaving the other side cortical (Fig. 30:1, 2). Most of the cylindrical cores were used from one striking platform at a time. In the flat cores, the striking platforms are usually at a slight angle and they were sometimes used simultaneously for the production of blades (some blades with opposed scar pattern were found). Cores with opposed striking platforms were used more often for the production of blades and bladelets, at least in the discard stage. Half of the cores were used for the production of blades, compared to about 1 1 % for other types (Table 16). Blades and bladelets were often produced by the alternate use of each striking platform to create long ridges on the flaking surface. Table 16. Blank types removed according to core type.

Cores with perpendicular striking platforms (13 items, 5.6%; Fig. 31:1,3,4) Cores with two striking platforms at an angle of 90° to one another. The striking platforms were not used simultaneously, but only one primary striking platform was exploited at any given time. Each of the striking platforms was shaped and used in an identical way to those on the cores with one striking platform. At least one of the striking platforms frequently shows evidence of several hinges (Fig. 31:4) or steps (Fig. 31:1,3), which were the reason for the replacement of the striking platform. In many cases one of the scars left by the exploitation of the former striking platform became the new striking platform, resulting in an angle of almost 90°. 4. Cores with multiple striking platforms (36 items, 15.5%; Fig. 32:5) These are cores with more than two striking 104</page><page sequence="112">THE FLINT KNAPPING TECHNOLOGY platforms. The angles between the various striking platforms are very diverse. There is no regular pattern for these cores and in many cases, especially if there are four or five striking platforms, it is very difficult to determine the chronological sequence of the exploitation of the striking platforms. It is evident that at least in the last stage of exploitation only one striking platform was used. The shaping and use of the last striking platform is basically the same as in the cores with one striking platform. The core was turned several times, but the intensity of flaking in each phase did not totally obscure the previous stages of flaking. 5. Amorphous cores (44 items, 19%; Figs. 32:4, 35:1,2) These are cores with no defined striking platforms. The flaking was done from every possible surface, usually no more than two or three flakes for each surface. The result is a spheroid core bearing scars in various directions. In some cases there is evidence for a previous, more regular exploitation. However, in most cases, if such a stage existed it is totally obscured by the last stages of irregular flaking. These cores apparently represent attempts to produce several more blanks from otherwise exploited cores. 6. Cores on flakes (34 items, 14.7%; Figs. 32: 1-3, 35:4) These are cores created by utilizing a large flake and removing a few smaller flakes from either the ventral or the dorsal face. The core flakes themselves are integral to the reduction sequence of Ashkelon; they were produced in the same way, some of them are thick CTEs that were further exploited, and many are cortical flakes. 7. Discoidal/bifacial cores (24 items, 10.3%, Figs. 33,34:1) This category comprises cores with a ridge that was shaped around the periphery of the core (in some cases not around the entire periphery, for example Fig. 34:1). Small flakes were removed alternately from the ridge, and on both faces only some of the negatives of the bulb of percussion are present. The final shape of the core is flat and discoidal, with a peripheral ridge. In several cases in which both faces still bore remains of cortex, it was clear that the initial nodule was a very flat one, enabling easier shaping of the peripheral ridge. In other cases the final shape of the core is more spherical. 8. Varia (21 items, 9.1%; Fig. 31:2) This category includes thirteen broken cores, six cores that combine a striking platform with a circumferential ridge on part of the periphery, three prepared but not exploited nodules (Fig. 31:2), two small, flat pebbles with some removals on one of the ends, and one triangular core with burin-like removals from all three corners. The eight types of cores represent five main methods of core exploitation: 1 Production of flakes from one striking platform with frequent turning of the core to create a new striking platform when the old one is no longer suitable for exploitation. The number of times and the directions in which the core has been turned determine the final "type " of the core, whether one striking platform, two striking platforms, multiple platforms, or amorphous cores. The production itself seems to be from only one striking platform at a time. The exploited striking platform is prepared by a single strike. 2 Production of flakes or, very often, blades from one side of a striking platform, leaving the other side cortical. The platform is at a sharp angle to the flaking surface. When necessary an opposed striking platform is prepared and used simultaneously. The discarded core is flat, with one side flaked and the other cortical. 3 Production of flakes and blades from opposed striking platforms, used simultaneously and from the entire perimeter. 4 Exploitation of a large flake as a core and removal of a few smaller flakes from either its ventral or its dorsal face. 5 The exploitation of a peripheral ridge by bifacially removing flakes from it, creating discoidal cores. 105</page><page sequence="113">CHAPTER SEVEN Core typology is affected by the method of production, though the correlation is not complete. One exploitation technique (e.g., No. 1) can result in several types. A specific type could be produced in several ways (opposed striking platforms are created in Nos. 1, 2, and 3). In most cases, the method of production can easily be identified. The vast majority of cores were produced by technique No. 1. It was possible to replace the technique during knapping; a good example of this is provided by the cores with one striking platform and a partial ridge. The blanks produced Because of the exhausted condition of most of the cores, it is impossible to determine the type of blanks that were removed at early stages of the reduction sequence. Our only option is to classify the cores according to the last few scars. Most cores (of all types) are cores for the production of flakes. Blade and bladelet cores are almost completely absent, at least at the discard stage. The relative frequencies of blanks removed are presented in Table 16. The flake to blade/bladelet ratio is about 7 : 1 ; it should be noted that even if only one of the last few scars was a blade or bladelet scar, the core was classified as a blade/bladelet core, and thus the actual ratio is even higher. Among the waste, the flake to blade/bladelet ratio is only 4:1. It is very likely that in the initial stages of core exploitation, when the dimensions of the cores were more suitable, more cores were used for the production of blades. The final stages of exploitation took place when the dimensions of the cores already made blade production difficult (Table 14; notice that length is maximal length and not the flaking surface length, which may be shorter). Evidently, as cores became smaller they were reassigned from blade to flake production. The cores with opposed platforms were used more often for the production of blades, by alternate exploitation of each platform. Use after exploitation Many of the cores show evidence of battering or pounding after the last exploitation stage (Figs. 29: 1 ; 30: 1 , 4; 3 1 : 1 , 3; 32:4; 33:4; 34: 1 ; 35:2). Three different activities are evident: 1 Pounding on the core in the framework of additional attempts to exploit it. In some cases only preparation is evident, and in others these attempts resulted in hinges, steps, and signs of pounding. 2 Some of the cores were used for pounding after exploitation. Most of the percussors found in the site are made of flint. Thus, it is no surprise that the exploited cores (roughly globular chunks of flint) were used as percussors. 3 Some of the longer and narrower cores were used as wedges. They bear evidence of pounding on two opposed surfaces. Many other flint items, usually flakes, were used as wedges {pièces esquillées) and will be discussed with the tools. Pounding on the cores, or with them, creates some typological blurring between cores, percussors, and pièces esquillées. Some of the items classified as the latter could well be reused cores. 7.5. CORE TRIMMING ELEMENTS The category of CTEs includes 674 items (1.8%). The cores demonstrate that the industry was not oriented toward blade production. This is evident in the CTE assemblage as well: only a few of them are typical ridge blades or core tablets (even when defined as such). Most of the CTEs are the results of one of three procedures: a The changing of striking platforms and the preparation of the new platform, b The changing of striking platforms and the preparation of the new flaking surface, c The ad hoc solution to problems encountered during the knapping process. These procedures create CTEs with either the remains of the former striking platform, or the remains of problems like hinges, lime inclusions, etc. The relative frequencies of the different types of CTEs are presented in Table 17. The following is a description of each type. 1. Ridge blades (154 items, 22.8%) Three subgroups of ridge blades were defined: a. Primary ridge blades (34 items; Fig. 106</page><page sequence="114">THE FLINT KNAPPING TECHNOLOGY Table 17. Frequencies of CTEs. type N % Primary ridge blade 34 5 Secondary ridge blade 27 4 Unilateral ridge blade 93 13.8 Core tablet 63 9 A Overpass 65 9.6 Lateral trimming 60 8.9 Raking surface rejuvenation 127 18.9 Hook-shaped blade 5 0.7 Varia 206 30.6 Total 674 100 36:1-5, 8, 12, 13): Elongated items (that do not in all cases have the length/width ratio of a real blade, for example Fig. 36:4) whose dorsal face has a central ridge from which small chips/flakes were removed to both sides. On both sides of the ridge one can see the negatives of the bulbs of percussion of the small flakes removed. This form of shaping is meant to enable the removal of an elongated item by guiding the force of the blow along the ridge. The ridge blades found at Ashkelon are not standardized and both the size of the ridge blades and the size of the scars shaping each are very diverse. No attention is paid to the precise shaping of the ridge, it is not straight, and it is sometimes shaped only on part of the blade (Fig. 36:12 as opposed to the standardized one, Fig. 36:3). b. Secondary ridge blades (27 items; Fig. 37: 1-5). Items removed after the removal of a ridge blade and from the same place. The ridge blade has left a long scar during removal of the bulbs area of the scars shaping the ridge. Thus, the secondary ridge blade has a long blade scar on one side and the negatives of the distal part of the shaping flakes (Fig. 37:1, 5). In some cases the ridge blade was unsuccessful, due to the presence of a hinge; in such cases the secondary ridge blade also has some of the original shaping scars on the distal part (Fig. 37:3). In other cases, several preparation flakes were struck before removing the secondary ridge blades, and thus some of the scars show bulbar negatives. c. Unilateral ridge blades (93 items; Fig. 36:6, 7, 9-11, 14). Items with a central ridge shaped by small flake removals from only one side. The other side is plain (Fig. 36:14) or has some scars (Fig. 36:7,11), but not scars that come from the direction of the ridge. The purpose of items of this kind is identical to that of the primary ridge blades, but their preparation is different. The items were shaped on an existing ridge on the core and elaborated from only one side. A convenient ridge was formed by the existing angle between the striking platform and the flaking surface. As noted above, the main reduction sequence includes several changes of striking platform, and any such change could result in a unilateral ridge blade (sometimes perhaps even accidentally). In this case no preparation is needed and the scars on the ridge are simply the remains of the exploitation of the previous striking platform. The existing core morphology in such cases enables the same function for unprepared items. 2. Core tablets (63 items, 9.4%; Fig. 38) These are items removed in order to reshape the striking platform of a core. Once a striking platform was no longer suitable for exploitation a flake was struck to reshape it. A flake of this kind has a tabular cross-section when the entire platform was removed or a triangular one when not all of the striking platform was removed (most cases at Ashkelon; Fig. 38:3, 10), and its lateral edges are faceted. The faceting reflects the former use of the striking platform. The sizes and shapes of the core tablets are identical to those of the cores' striking platform. In the case of Ashkelon, the core tablets are small and the shape is irregular, in good correlation with the cores. The core tablets represent an earlier stage of core exploitation and serve as a good indicator of the initial state of the cores. It is clear that the cores were small and irregular not only when discarded, but also in the first stages of exploitation. The faceted side is evidence of the direction from which the core tablet was struck. The relative frequencies of the different directions are presented in Table 18. There is a clear preference for the removal of lateral core tablets, without left or right partiality (Fig. 38:4, 6, 8, 10), while 107</page><page sequence="115">CHAPTER SEVEN Fig. 36.

The lateral strike made it possible to continue to use the same face of the core without creating a depression by a percussion bulb, and saved the work of preparing a new flaking surface. It is possible that the core tablets did not serve as such. The presence of cores with diagonal striking platform suggests that at least some of the items were removed after orientation change of the core, resulting in an item resembling a core tablet. One example of this possibility was identified by refitting of two CTEs, the first defined as a core tablet and the second, removed immediately afterwards, as a secondary ridge blade. In light of the refitting, the first item could not have functioned as a core tablet. The next item did not exploit a rejuvenated striking platform; on the contrary, it spoiled the angle between the old striking platform and the old flaking surface. Both items are the result of turning the core by 90° and exploiting the former striking platform as the new flaking surface. The ridge between the former striking platform and the former flaking surface was used as the base for production of elongated items. The "core tablet" actually functioned as a ridge blade. This single example emphasizes the role of orientation change in core maintenance, and demonstrates some inconsistency between CTE typology and function. 3. Overpass (65 items, 9.6%; Fig. 39) These are items bearing remains of the core's distal surface on the distal end. The core's distal surface may be a natural surface (Fig. 39:3), a previous scar (Fig. 39: 1), or a former striking platform (Fig. 39:2, 4-7). The latter case is evidence of the use of opposed striking platforms. These items result from either deliberate action taken to create a new face (without ridges) for the core, or misjudgment of the force needed to remove a flake. In many cases the distal end of the overpass is wider than the rest of the item, creating a very typical shape (Fig. 39:2, 5, 6). 4. Lateral trimming (60 items, 8.9%; Fig. 40) These are items bearing remains of a striking platform on one of the sides. There is a 90° angle between this striking platform and the ventral face of the item. Scars perpendicular to the flaking axes cover the dorsal face of the item. An item of this kind is the result of turning the core by 90° and exploiting a new striking platform. There is sometimes a clear reason for the turning, such as a hinge correction (Fig. 40:2, 3, 5) or a problem with the former striking platform like crushing (Fig. 40:6) or an unsuitable angle. In other cases the reason for turning is not so obvious (Fig. 40: 1 , 4, 9), since both the striking platform and the flaking surface are still in good condition. No preference in the direction of turning was found. 5. Flaking surface rejuvenation (127 items, 18.8%; Fig. 41) These are items removed in order to solve problems related to the flaking surface. They were created by the removal of a problematic element like a hinge (Fig. 41:6, 7), a lime inclusion (Fig. 41:4, 5), a cortical part (Fig. 41:8), or a part with raised topography on the core (Fig. 41:1, 2, 3, 9). Since the direction of the blow is from the active striking platform, the scars on the dorsal face are parallel to the direction of the item. Most of the items in this category are very thick and massive flakes, although some are thin flakes (mostly resulting from hinge removal). 6. Hook-shaped blades (5 items, 0.7%; Fig. 37:6, 7. 8) These are blades with a typical hook shape resulting from a thickening of the distal end. Ill</page><page sequence="119">CHAPTER SEVEN Fig. 39.

Core trimming elements resulting from flaking surface rejuvenation. 114</page><page sequence="122">THE FLINT KNAPPING TECHNOLOGY They are a kind of overpass that received its form from the core's shape, with an opposed striking platform angled towards the flaking surface. Two examples (Fig. 37:7, 8) are typical ones with blade dimensions, while the rest are atypical. 7. Varia (206 items, 30.7%) This category consists of items that do not belong to any of the previous categories. They show the remains of a previous striking platform or a problem that was removed, but do not fit into any of the formal types because the position, shape, or direction is irregular. In summary, most of the CTEs are the consequence of turning the core and preparing both the new striking platform and the flaking surface. This results in a high number of CTEs, some unintentional. The typical blade-oriented CTEs (ridge blades and core tablets) form less than 35% of the CTEs (Table 17), and even within these categories there are many atypical examples. The length/width ratio of the items themselves is additional evidence of the flake orientation of the industry. Out of 326 complete CTEs, 208 have flake proportions and only 118 (60 of them ridge blades) have blade proportions. 115</page><page sequence="123">CHAPTER 8 THE FLINT TOOLS Down Dag This chapter deals with the typology of the flint tools unearthed at Ashkelon. Out of 36,786 flint items, 2422 (6.6%) are classified as tools. They are either flaked artifacts bearing retouch or bifacial items made on raw flint. The frequencies of the various tool types are presented in Table 19. Two additional categories, items with edge damage and spalls, are also presented here. 8.1. ARROWHEADS (81 items, 3.3%; Figs. 42-46, Photos 110-119) In the typology commonly used for southern Levantine arrowheads, a distinction is made between large arrowheads (Jericho, Byblos, and Amuq types) more typical of the PPNB and small Table 19.

Boaz). arrowheads (Haparsa, Herzliya, and Nizzanim types) more typical of the PN. The length limit for small arrowheads is 40 mm (Burian and Friedman 1979; Bar-Yosef 1981a; Gopher 1994), but naturally larger arrowheads are found in PN assemblages and vice versa. The definition of a new period (e.g., the PPNC) requires description of the associated arrowheads. According to the trend of size reduction over time, we would expect large arrowheads to dominate in the PPNB, medium-sized in the PPNC, and small in the PN. Making a distinction simply between large and small arrowheads is consequently inadequate, and arrowhead size must be described in a way that clarifies the size range of arrowheads in the assemblage. The Ashkelon assemblage includes 81 arrowheads. The complete typology is presented in Appendix B, Table 59; it includes the Jericho, Byblos, Amuq, Haparsa, Nizzanim, and Herzliya Table 20.

However, for study of the length distribution the assemblage was divided into four morphotypes regardless of size (Table 20): "Jericho" (including Haparsa), "Byblos" (including Nizzanim), "Jericho/Byblos" (including Haparsa/ Nizzanim), and "Amuq" (including Herzliya). The arrowheads were measured (length, width, thickness, and weight) and for the broken ones the complete length was estimated through a comparison with a complete arrowhead with similar width and thickness (this was done only when possible and when the fragment was estimated as constituting at least 60% of the complete item). This procedure was necessary to avoid a bias towards smaller arrowheads due to the higher frequency of fragmentation in the large arrowheads (see fragment frequencies in Table 20). The average length is 46.7 mm, with Jericho and Amuq being slightly smaller and Byblos and Jericho/Byblos larger (Table 21; Fig. 42). Fig. 42 presents the length frequencies of the different morphotypes. The Jericho and Amuq types show one distribution peak, while the Byblos type shows bimodality around 60 mm. Most arrowheads are concentrated in the 30-60 mm range. Smaller arrowheads are almost totally absent. As was expected, the 40 mm line is meaningless in the assemblage of Ashkelon, which in terms of arrowhead size is neither PPNB nor PN. The 30-60 mm range is appropriate for medium-sized arrowheads, but this category should be tested on other assemblages as well. 121</page><page sequence="128">CHAPTER EIGHT Photos 111-119.

Most of the shaping of the tool was carried out by retouching the dorsal face, while the ventral face received less treatment, being not retouched at all or retouched only on the tip and tang (Fig. 43). The intensive retouch on the dorsal face makes it almost impossible to observe the scar pattern; however, despite this it seems that most arrowheads are made on blades from cores with one striking platform. The retouch was intended to reshape an otherwise unsuitable blank and give it the required aerodynamic characteristics. When the initial blank was a straight blade with a triangular section, only the tip and tang were retouched (Fig. 42: 1 , 5, 6, 8). In six cases (e.g., Fig. 42:8), the tang was shaped alternately, dorsally on the right side and ventrally on the left (and never vice versa). This pattern of retouch corresponds with right-handed knapping. 8.2. KNIVES (58 items, 2.4%; Figs. 47-51) Knives are relatively rare in PPNB flint assemblages and appear in larger quantities in PPNC and PN sites. Discussions of this tool type can be found in previous publications (Betts et al. 1988; Rollefson et al. 1994; Goring-Morris et al. 1994). Various approaches have been presented in the literature, sometimes lumping together various types under the single category of "tile knife" (Betts et al. 1988; Goring-Morris et al. 1994). However, in the late Neolithic of the central and southern Levant we see three basic types of knife. Each type was made on a different raw material, and sometimes a different technology was applied: A. Cortical knife (tile knife): These knives were made on rather thick primary flakes produced from large flint nodules. The retouch is quite intensive and covers large parts of the tool. The final result of this intensive treatment is a round or oval outline. In the sites of Har Qeren V and XIV in the western Negev, flint workshops specializing in the production of tile knifes were reported: "The collections revealed that the profusion of locally available Eocene flint nodules, measuring up to 80 cm in diameter, served as the raw material for these knives, with large cortical flakes removed by the block-on-block technique either on-site or immediately adjacent. These were then flaked by direct (soft?) percussion around the perimeter from the prepared dorsal (cortical) surface, removing all traces of the ventral face. This process produced huge quantities of typical 'biface' flakes, items with narrow striking platforms, expanding lateral edges and thin, incurvate profiles. Finally the perimeter of the knives were carefully retouched to produce regular working edges" (Goring-Morris et al. 1994: 512). B. Tabular knife ("Ashkelon knife"): Unlike the tile knife, which was made on cortical flakes, the raw material used for the Ashkelon knife was a thin plate of tabular flint with cortex on both sides. Breaking the plate into an elongated preform formed the general outline of the item. The outline was rectangular, trapezoid, or with a less formal elongated shape. The retouch then concentrated on one of the elongated sides of the knife, creating the cutting edge. In this type of knife the retouch is minimal. Such knives have been reported from a number of sites (see Chapter 9, which deals with comparative analysis). 123</page><page sequence="130">CHAPTER EIGHT Fig. 47.

Bifacial knives. 128</page><page sequence="135">THE FLINT TOOLS Photos 120-125. Ashkelon knives (photographs B. Boaz). C. Bifacial knives: While this category includes mainly knives made on non-cortical blades, it may also include items made on primary elements whose cortex was completely removed during the preparation. This might be considered a sub- type of the tile knife, as it is also made on a large elongated flake. However, it reflects a different functional or esthetic approach, which required the total absence of cortex. The retouch on this knife is most intensive, covering both ventral and dorsal faces of the tool. Thus the knife is relatively thin and usually symmetrical. The Ashkelon assemblage includes knives of two types: 1. Ashkelon knives (Figs. 47-50; Photos 120-125). Fifty Ashkelon knives were found. The knives are made on thin tablets of flint, cortical on both sides and probably imported to the site as 129</page><page sequence="136">CHAPTER EIGHT complete tools. Most of the items have a 90° back, mostly naturally cracking surfaces but sometimes man-made. In four cases, the back is cortical (Fig. 49:3, 4), in eight cases it is retouched (Fig. 49:2), and in one case it is shaped by a burin-like blow (Fig. 49: 1). Although the general shape of the tool is rectangular, the seven tips found have been shaped to create a rounded edge (Figs. 47:2; 49:3, 6). Other tips are either broken or the natural end of the item. The tool itself is shaped by bifacial retouch, in some cases rough (Fig. 48:2) and in others delicate pressure retouch (Figs. 49:4; 50:3), which created a sharp cutting edge. The retouch covers about 40% of the tool's surface (about 8.5 mm on average). In several cases both sides of the tool were shaped (Fig. 49:2), but there is no evidence as to whether both sides were used concurrently. The average dimensions of the knives are presented in Table 22. The length data relate only to complete knives. 2. Bifacial knives (Fig. 51). Five bifacial knives were found at Ashkelon. They are shaped by bifacial flat and very intensive pressure retouch on both sides (one item, Fig. 51:5, is shaped on only one side). In four cases the retouch covers most of the two faces of the item and in one case the retouch is almost exclusively on the ventral face (Fig. 5 1 :2). All of the items have a more or less biconvex section that resulted from the retouch. The blank used is a blade, except for one item made on tabular flint (Fig. 51:3); it was included in this group rather than in the tabular knives because of the shaping. The shape of the tools is slightly trapezoid, and since they are all fragments, this shape suggests that the complete tool may have been pointed. If this is indeed the case, three additional items may belong to this type; these are pointed fragments with the same kind of Table 22. Dimensions of knives.

One of them is retouched dorsally and two bifacially. 8.3. BIFACIAL TOOLS (17 items, 0.7%; Figs. 52-55) Bifacial tools are very rare in the assemblage. They include: 1. Five axes (Fig. 52-53), two of them polished. The axes are rectangular in shape and rather small in size: two complete axes measure about 55 x 40 mm and two of the broken ones seem to be slightly larger. There are remains of cortex on one of the axes and all of them are covered with patina. None of the active edges was transversally shaped. 2. Four chisels, three made on tabular flint (Fig. 54:2, 4). Their dimensions are on average 62 mm long, 1 8 mm wide and 6 mm thick. The final shaping of the tool was done by pressure retouch. 3. One pick made on tabular flint (Fig. 54: 1). It was shaped by rough bifacial flaking and measures 81 x 36 x 15 mm. 4. Two choppers (Fig. 55:1, 2), one of them made on calcified limestone and the other made on flint but atypical in shape. 5. Five undefined tools were classified as varia; they were shaped in a bifacial technique but lack a defined shape. 8.4. SICKLE BLADES (313 items, 12.9%; Figs. 56-59) The sickle blade is one of the most abundant tool types at Ashkelon. Two types were found: 1. Denticulated sickle blade. The most common type of sickle blade is the "Yarmukian" coarse denticulated one (272 items). The shaping of the denticulated end was done by shaping rough notches by pressure retouch on the dorsal face and then giving them the final shape by ventral pressure retouch. Occasionally another cycle of dorsal and ventral retouch was performed. In eleven cases the notches were shaped by retouch on one of the faces (on the ventral face in six cases and on the dorsal face in five). The denticulation width is not standardized, ranging from 4.2 to 7.5 mm (Table 23); there are 130</page><page sequence="137">THE FLINT TOOLS Fig. 52. Axes. sometimes differences even between two sides of the same item. Based on the distribution of the gloss and on remains of adhesives, it is clear that the sickle blades were hafted along the long axes, leaving the denticulation outside the haft. The hafted end was treated in a variety of ways. a. Denticulated (93 items; Figs. 57; 59:8, 11). In this type both sides of the sickle blade received the same denticulation, as well as gloss. The gloss is usually more intensive on one of the sides. On the basis of their size and shape, it is clear that sickle blades were hafted on their long axes (this is also 131</page><page sequence="138">CHAPTER EIGHT Fig. 53. Axes. Table 23.

Thus, only one side was used at a time. The existence of two-sided sickle blades may be taken as evidence for recycling of old blades by utilizing the second hafted side when the first had lost its sharpness. Five items denticulated on both sides did not show any gloss; they had been prepared in advance for multiple use. b. Retouched (44 items; Figs. 58:1-5; 59:3, 6-7, 9). Sickle blades that bear various types of retouch on their hafted side. The following types of retouch were found: fine (five items), regular (16 items), backed (18 items), and pressure retouch (five items). The retouch on the other side of the sickle blade prevented it from being reused, since it was impossible to denticulate the retouch. These items were apparently intended from the beginning to be used only once. 132</page><page sequence="139">THE FLINT TOOLS Fig. 54. 1 pick; 2-4 chisels. 133</page><page sequence="140">CHAPTER EIGHT Fig. 55. 1-2 chopping tools; 3-5 bifacial points. 134</page><page sequence="141">THE FLINT TOOLS Fig. 56.

Plain (122 items; Figs. 56; 59:1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 12). These items were not treated at all. It is possible that there was an intention to denticulate the other side, which was not realized due to breaks, etc. Among the denticulated sickles, 13 were laterally broken, so no information is available about their opposite side. 2. Non-denticulated sickle blades. About 13% of the sickle blades do not belong to the deep denticulated type. These include 14 items with retouched active edge (Fig. 58:5, 8), ten items with bifacial retouch that creates a fine denticulation on the active edge (Fig. 58:7, 9), two items with plain active edge and thirteen fragments, with some gloss on them. Twenty-nine complete sickle blades were found, some shaped on broken blades. They include 26 deep denticulated items (five are denticulated on both sides), two fine denticulated items, and one retouched item. Their dimensions are presented in Table 23. The blades utilized are very heterogeneous, as evidenced by the wide ranges and large deviations. The hafting depth probably compensated for the diversity of the blade dimensions. The distal and proximal ends (626 in total) were treated in several ways: 114 are truncated (mostly a straight truncation), 58 are left in their natural condition, and 454 are broken. Most of the breaks clearly postdate the manufacture or use of the tool, but in some cases it is clear that the sickle blade was made on an already broken blade, as the gloss and denticulation postdate the break (Fig. 59:3). Most of the sickles are rectangular in shape, but some are triangular and were probably hafted at the tip (Figs. 56:13; 57:3; 58:8; 59:11). The scar pattern is unipolar in most cases but bipolar in some. Twenty-five of the sickle blades had remains of cortex on the dorsal face and 67 of them were burnt. All but five of the sickle blades had gloss on them (the other five were defined as sickle blades due to the characteristic denticulation). A total of 357 glossed sides were examined. In 52 cases there was only weak gloss, covering the tip of the denticulations; in 141 cases there was medium gloss, covering all of the denticulations; and in 164 cases there was intensive gloss covering more than the denticulations and up to half of the item's width (indicating the actual hafting depth). The intensive use is not surprising given the investment needed for replacement of the blades in the haft. The intensity of use is even more pronounced in the case of the blades denticulated on both sides (i.e. recycled): of 93 such blades, 65 were intensively used on at least one of the sides, 22 had medium gloss on one of the sides, and only six had weak gloss or none at all. 8.5. PERFORATORS (310 items, 12.8%; Figs. 60-64) Perforators were found in large quantities. Typologically, they include the following four types: 1. Awls (278 items), mostly epines and bees (Figs. 61; 62:4-17, 63:9-10; 64:1-6, 9-12). 2. Massive awls (7 items; Fig. 62:1-3; 64:13). 3. Multiple awls (19 items; Figs. 63:1-7; 64: 8). 4. Delicate borers (6 items; Figs. 63:8, 11; 64:7). Most of the perforators are very small, weighing on average only 1.6 g (for 141 complete perforators, including the massive ones). The small dimensions raise the possibility of hafting; although there was no direct evidence for this, some of them present two proximal notches that might have served as tangs (Figs. 60:7; 61:4, 6), while others are too tiny to enable convenient use without hafting. Fifty-six of the perforators had remains of cortex and 48 items were burnt, with a notable concentration of 35 burnt awls in a single basket (6189, Fig. 60), together with nine unburnt awls and 13 additional awls in different baskets from the same locus (Loc. 392). The tip is shaped in one of several ways: two long notches (e.g., Fig. 61:1-6, 8), two wide and shallow notches (e.g., Figs. 61:9-14, 62:4, 5), convergent retouch (e.g., Fig. 60:33-35; 61 : 15-20, 23), a combination of a notch and retouch (e.g., Figs. 60:37, 41; 61:21, 22), or a combination of a 139</page><page sequence="146">CHAPTER EIGHT Fig. 60.

Perforators: 1-7 multiple awls; 9-10 proximal; 8, 11 borers. notch/retouch and a break (Fig. 62: 10-17). In some cases the tip is only a small projection (e.g., Fig. 62:3, 7). The tip section is usually either triangular or semi-trapezoid. In most cases (about 80%) the position of the tip is distal (in the middle or on one of the sides of the distal end); the rest are lateral or proximal. Lateral tips are found almost exclusively on flakes (only one is on a blade), while proximal tips are found mainly on blades and bladelets as part of multiple tools. The awls are relatively homogeneous in terms of raw material and size: over 75% of them are made on flint from the Mishash Formation (compared to about 37% for the entire assemblage). This is clearly the result of intentional selection of blanks for the production of perforators and will be discussed later. The perforators are a unique group among the tool assemblage of Ashkelon, being a more or less homogenous group in comparison with the heterogeneous character of the assemblage. 8.6. SCRAPERS (102 items, 4.2%; Figs. 65-68) The scrapers vary in elaboration of shaping; while some are very elaborate and shaped by very regular retouch (sometimes even pressure retouch), others 143</page><page sequence="150">CHAPTER EIGHT Fig. 64. Perforators: 1-6, 9-12 awls; 8 multiple awl; 13 massive awl; 7 borer. are shaped by rough retouch that almost forms a denticulate. They were divided into five groups: 1. Fine scrapers with a regular active edge shaped by fine or regular retouch (26 items; Figs. 65:1-6; 68:4-6). Four were burnt and 11 had remains of cortex. The average weight of the fine scrapers is 3.7 g, about one fifth of the weight of the other scrapers. Most of the fine scrapers (20) are end scrapers, while on some (3) the scraper is shaped also on one or more of the sides. Two are double scrapers and one is a butt scraper. One tool was shaped on the ventral face. 2. Pressure-shaped scrapers with a very regular active edge (15 items; Fig. 65:7-14). One was burnt and six had remains of cortex. The average weight is 15.4 g, very similar to the rougher types of scrapers. Three tools are end scrapers, ten are also shaped on one of the sides (Fig. 65:9, 13), one is a side scraper (Fig. 65: 11), and one is a butt scraper (Fig. 65: 10). Two are shaped on the ventral face and two by alternate retouch. 3. Rough scrapers shaped by abrupt, semi- abrupt or invasive retouch; in some cases the scars are composed of regular retouch above a very invasive retouch (27 items; Figs. 66: 1-4, 9; 68: 1-3, 7). Four tools are burnt and 18 bear remains of cortex (e.g., Fig. 66:4, which is cortical except for the retouched areas). The average weight is 15.3 g. Twelve are end scrapers, 12 are also shaped on one of the sides, one is a side scraper, and two are 144</page><page sequence="151">THE FLINT TOOLS Fig. 65.

In some cases the retouch forms a step of hinges at the distal end and can also result in a carinated item. 4. Denticulated scrapers shaped with a very rough retouch, invasive, abrupt or semi-abrupt, that creates a roughly denticulated edge (24 items; Figs. 66:5-8, 10; 68:8). One item is burnt and 18 bear remains of cortex. The average weight is 25.6 g. and the large dimensions of the tools are probably related to the high proportions of cortical blanks. Six of the tools are end scrapers, 12 were also shaped on one of the sides, four are circular, and two are too fragmentary to be defined. Four were shaped on the ventral face and three by alternate retouch. 5. Varia, including six scrapers shaped on thick blades with a very intensive pressure retouch (Fig. 67:1-5). The items have a plano-convex cross- section and are very similar to seven items that were shaped on the lateral ends without distal or proximal shaping (classified with the general varia, Fig. 80). Three pointed scrapers are shaped with a very invasive retouch; one of them is shouldered (Fig. 67:6) and one is a rough scraper with a step on the ventral face (Fig. 67:8). We are well aware that a classification of this kind is not commonly used for scrapers. In our view it is better suited to the assemblage, but for the sake of comparison with other sites the common typology is presented in the complete typological list (Appendix B). 8.7. DENTICULATES (111 items, 4.6%; Figs. 69:5, 7-8; 70; 71:2, 6-11) The denticulates include three main groups: 1. Rough denticulates on massive and very often cortical flakes (34 items; Figs. 69:5, 7-8; 70:1-5, 7; 71:7, 9, 11). They are shaped by small flake removals or by abrupt retouch. The notches are large and wide but uneven. 2. Regular (saws) and fine denticulates (59 items; Figs. 70:10; 71:2, 8, 10, 12). They are shaped by regular retouch. The notches are small and even. 3. Pressure retouched denticulates (18 items; Figs. 70: 6, 8-9, 11-13; 71:6). They are notched delicately and evenly by pressure retouch, usually on the entire side. The rough denticulates are distinct from the other types in other aspects as well. The flake to blade ratio is 4: 1 for the rough denticulates and 1 :4 for the rest. The proportion of cortical items is 2:3 for the rough denticulates and 1 :5 for the rest. The average weight is 18.9 g for the rough denticulates and 3.3 for the rest. Thus there appear to be two distinct groups. 8.8. NOTCHES (132 items, 5.5%; Figs. 69:1-4, 6; 71:3, 4) The notches were classified as follows: 1. Single notches (95 items; Figs. 69:6; 71:3) 2. Strangulated notches (18 items; Figs. 69: 2, 4; 71:4) 3. Multiple notches (19 items; Fig. 69:1, 3) Most notches are lateral (139), although some are distal (19) or proximal (6). They are shaped by regular retouch ( 1 1 9) or abrupt/semi-abrupt retouch (62). In the latter case the notches are usually rougher. In some cases in addition to the notch there was some retouch, probably to blunt the item to enable it to be held (e.g., Fig. 69:6). 8.9. BURINS (31 items, 1.3%; Figs. 71:1, 5; 72) Burins are very scarce (3 1 items). They include: 1. Burins on natural surfaces (6 items; Figs. 71:5; 72:1).

Multiple burins (8 items; Fig. 72:7-9), of which one is dihedral, three are on break, three on natural surface, and two mixed. The variety in such a small sample of burins is evidence of familiarity with the type, whose lack in the assemblage is probably functional 149</page><page sequence="156">CHAPTER EIGHT Fig. 69. 1-4, 6 notches; 5, 7, 8 denticulates. 150</page><page sequence="157">THE FLINT TOOLS Fig. 70.

PIÈCES ESQUILLÉES (225 items, 9.3% ; Figs. 73; 74:6, 8) This category, also known as wedge or "blade chisel" as at Jericho (Crowfoot-Payne 1983), includes 225 items. It differs from the other tool types by the fact that it is shaped by use rather than retouch. The common interpretation of this tool is that pounding activity created scars on both the dorsal and ventral faces. This is the fourth most abundant tool type in the assemblage, its large quantities an indication of extensive pounding activity carried out at the site. The blanks used are usually thick rectangular items, mostly flakes (161 items), but occasionally also blades, bladelets, CTEs, or chunks. Twenty-four items are very similar to small cores (Fig. 73:9, 10) but were included in this category because they show signs of pounding, and because their small size (average weight about 2 g) make it improbable that they were cores. The direction of pounding was in most cases distal/proximal (160 items; Fig. 73:1, 2, 4, 8-10), probably using the striking platform as a convenient pounding point. In the other cases pounding was carried out on the lateral axis (43 cases) or on both axes (22 cases; Fig. 73:3, 5-7). Although the pounding often resulted in a burin-like scar (60 items, e.g., the left scar on the ventral face in Fig. 73: 1 , 2), this was clearly not intentional and the item was therefore not classified as a burin. 8.11. RETOUCHED ITEMS (905 items, 37.4%; Figs. 74:1-5, 7; 75; 76; 77:5-10, 12, 13) The retouched items are the most abundant tool type in the assemblage. The term is used here in the wide sense and includes various blanks and various types, positions, and intensities of retouch (this variety is presented in the figures). Any subdivision will give a different picture of the group, due to the lack of correlation between attributes. We preferred not to emphasize one characteristic rather than another and thus, instead of subdividing this large group according to a single element (like the partiality of retouch or the intensity of retouch), we present it in a table containing all the information (Table 24). Although most items are made on blades and flakes, there is some use of bladelets, chunks, and CTEs. The flake to blade and bladelet ratio is about 3:4, compared to about 4:1 in the waste. There are about five times more blades in the retouched items category, a fact that indicates deliberate selection. Other differences between blades and flakes are the frequency of breaks, which is higher for the blades; the frequency of cortex, which is higher for the flakes; distal or proximal retouch, which is more abundant on flakes; and pressure retouch, which is more abundant on blades. 8.12. TRUNCATIONS (40 items, 1.7%; Fig. 77:1^4, 11) The truncation is shaped by regular retouch (26 cases, of which three are ventrally retouched) or abrupt or semi-abrupt retouch (14 cases). The shape of the truncated end is straight (12 items), oblique (14 items), concave (7 items), or convex (7 items). In 39 cases the truncation is distal and in only one case is there a proximal truncation. 8.13. MULTIPLE TOOLS (45 items, 1.9%; Fig. 78) The criterion for classification as a multiple tool was the presence of two independent types. For example, an awl with retouch dulling one of the edges was considered a single tool, while the same awl with an independent retouch was classified as a multiple tool. This admittedly vague criterion was adopted in order to represent the actual use of the tool. The repertoire of types is not consistent. The most abundant combinations are the following. Retouch with another tool: denticulate (8), notch (9), truncation (3), and perforator (3). Pièce esquillée with another tool: retouch (10), denticulate (1), notch (1), and sickle blade (2). Burin with another tool: retouch (4), scraper (2), and knife (1). The lack of any consistent pattern implies an unintentional process leading to the production of the multiple tools. In at least some cases the chronological 154</page><page sequence="161">THE FLINT TOOLS Fig. 73. Pièces esquillées. 155</page><page sequence="162">CHAPTER EIGHT Fig. 74. 1-5, 7 retouched flakes; 6, 8 pièces esquillées. sequence of the types is evident, showing that the multiple uses were not contemporary. This is particularly true for the pièce esquillée, where it is clear that one use is later than the other. Recycling of tools was evidently not a common practice; as a rule, a tool was manufactured, used as a single type and abandoned. When the need for an ad hoc type occurred, a suitable item was collected and used. 8.14. VARIA (52 items, 2.2%; Figs. 79-80) The category of varia includes: 1. Fifteen items with a tang shaped on them (Fig. 79:2, 3). The tang is created by two strangulated notches at one of the ends (in many cases broken). These items could be broken perforators or strangulated blades. Six are shaped by pressure retouch and the rest by regular retouch. 156</page><page sequence="163">THE FLINT TOOLS Fig. 75.

In some cases the differentiation between these items and massive denticulates or denticulated scrapers is not clear-cut, and it is possible that those three categories in fact served the same purpose. 3. Five thick flakes, heavily battered and with many hinges, mostly on the ventral face (Fig. 79:1). 4. Seven blades with intensive pressure retouch, mostly on the dorsal face (Fig. 80: 1-7). Relative to other tool types these are very elaborate; they are also exceptional in their straight (rather than curved) profile. One of the items is made on a completely cortical blade removed from what looks like a flat pebble. Since no such pebbles were exploited on site, these items may be imported. These blades were classified as varia because they are intermediate between retouched blades, 163</page><page sequence="170">CHAPTER EIGHT scrapers, and bifacial knives. In our view they are closer to the latter, in view of their elaboration and unusual cross-section. 5. Two fragments of narrow items with a hemispherical section, shaped by intensive pressure retouch covering all of the dorsal face (Fig. 79:4-5). 6. Eight retouched fragments whose fragmentary condition prevents typological classification. 8.15. ITEMS WITH EDGE DAMAGE There are 822 items with edge damage. They include items with retouch less than 10 mm long, items with irregular retouch, and nibbled items. While some of these items probably reflect use, others could definitely have resulted from trampling. The composition of this group is rather similar to the tools (Table 26 below): the blanks are primary elements (82 items), flakes (301 items), blades (305 items), bladelets (88 items), and CTEs (47 items). The average weight of the items is 3.9 g, intermediate between the tools and the waste (Table 27 below), and this is consistent with all blanks. Thus the items with edge damage appear to represent a significant use of unutilized" pieces. Unfortunately this is probably masked, at least to some degree, by items derived from post- depositional processes. 8.16. SPALLS (Figs. 81-82) The spalls are part of the waste assemblage and were not counted as tools. However, for some types they contribute significant information. A total of 165 spalls were found in Ashkelon. These include: 1. Burin spalls (94 items), a high number for the 31 burins (with about 50 scars). However, work with pièces esquillées also resulted in burin spalls. When added, there is a good correlation between the number of spalls and the number of tools (31 burins and 60 pièces esquillées with burin scars). Resharpening of burins was not a very common practice and most of the shaping of the tools (in the case of burins) and use (in the case of the pièces esquillées) was done on site. 2. Retouched spalls (50 items, Fig. 82:1-5) probably resulted from work with retouched items, scrapers, etc. Seven of the spalls are tabular knife spalls (Fig. 82:9). Since none of them belongs to any of the recovered knives, they raise the number of tabular knives to 57. One of the spalls belongs to an unusual type of knife, retouched on both sides and with a tang-like end. There are 20 bifacial tool spalls, of which 11 removed part of the active edge of the bifacial tools, leaving the ridge forming the active edge visible (Fig. 82:6). In most cases the type of tool is not recognizable, but in one case it is a chisel (Fig. 82:8). Nine of ''the spalls are small, polished flakes removed from polished axes (Fig. 81). In 14 cases it was possible to establish the fact that the spalls did not belong to any of the bifacial tools found in the site. This attests to the presence of at least five more polished axes, another chisel, and eight more bifacial tools that were used in the site. If the location of the spall represents the place where the tool was used, there is evidence of the high Fig. 81. Polished axe spalls. 164</page><page sequence="171">THE FLINT TOOLS Fig. 82. 1-5 retouched burin spalls; 6 axe spall; 7 tabular knife spall; 8 chisel spall. mobility of knives and bifacial tools, which were moved at least out of the excavated area. 8.17. HAFTING AND REFITTING HAFTING Several indications of tool hafting were found. For some types (arrowheads and sickle blades) the a priori assumption is that they were hafted. Indeed, on five of the sickle blades there were still remains of a black adhesive, probably bitumen (Fig. 58: 1-2). In all five cases the sickle blade was hafted parallel to the long axes, and none was a threshing knife. Several of the perforators are of small dimensions that make it likely that they were hafted. In two cases two notches opposite to the tip formed a kind of tang (Fig. 61:4), but no direct evidence for the perforator's hafting was found. One denticulate was found burnt, and the burning left a clear oblique line near the proximal end of the item, leaving the proximal end unburnt. This is most probably the result of a haft protecting the hafted area from the fire (Fig. 71:12). 165</page><page sequence="172">CHAPTER EIGHT REFITTING Four pairs of items were refitted to each other as a by-product of the analysis rather than as a result of intentional effort. Three of them are broken tools (one sickle blade, one retouched blade, and one tabular knife) whose two parts were found apart (the retouched blade was found out of context). The fourth case is of two CTEs removed successively from the same core. These cases are evidence of minimal vertical movement (up to 15 cm), while horizontal movement varied between 3.5 m for the knife, 10 m for the sickle blade, and 23 m for the CTEs. Naturally, with such a small sample it is impossible to determine whether the movements are the result of human activity, or of post-depositional processes. Technological conclusions could be drawn only from the CTEs. 8.18. BLANK SELECTION One process that can be deduced from the analysis of flint assemblages is the selection of blanks for tool production. The selection follows a decision-making algorithm. Its reconstruction is not an easy task, since many factors, some of which are unknown, affect the actual decision. The distance from raw material sources, the quality of raw material, the desired size, shape, and section, the time available, the dexterity of the knapper, etc., are all part of the process, as well as the social and esthetic value ascribed to the specific tool. Obviously, some of the choices do not leave traces in the archaeological record (for example, one cannot tell if a choice was made because the knapper was in a hurry). Nevertheless, some of the more consistent preferences are detectable, since they affect the final composition of both the tools and the waste assemblages. The analysis presented heie is based on the assumption that when the tool assemblage differs from the waste assemblage, this is due to such regularity of choices, resulting from consideration and thought. RAW MATERIAL Raw material is probably the first factor in selection. The first step in the reduction sequence is the selection of a nodule. This is affected by raw material type and also by size, shape, quality, etc. Variables like the distance and composition of the raw material source naturally play an important role in the process. Since, as noted above, the total weight of flint is small, distance did not impose any limitation. The composition of the source is unknown: whether there was a selection of raw material at the source, or the assemblage represents the actual composition of the source, remains an open question. The raw material comparison is based on the cores and CTEs (representing the waste) on the one hand and the tools on the other (imported raw materials were omitted from the comparison). The most obvious selection of raw material is that of tabular flint for knives and, in some cases, for bifacial tools. Table 25 presents the frequencies of local raw materials according to tool type. The relative frequencies are very similar in the waste and in the tools (Fig. 83). This means that there Fig. 83.

However, when looking at the tools by type, the picture becomes more complex. In most types there is a more intensive use of gray/ brown raw material (60-70%, compared to about 30% of Mishash and around 3% of chert). There are some exceptions to this picture. In the perforators, there is a very high frequency of Mishash, including the translucent type. A similar correlation between perforators and Mishash flint was observed at the nearby PN site of Ziqim (Garfinkel et al. 2002). An opposite trend is evident in the pièces esquillées and in the bifacial knives (a very small sample of the latter). Chert was not used for several types; this is probably due to the sample size, but in the case of the arrowheads may be intentional. BLANKS Some of the waste assemblage was ruled out a priori for use in tool production; cores and debris (used in negligible numbers) were not considered fit for exploitation. The rest of the blanks, mainly flakes, blades, bladelets, CTEs, and cortical items, were used to make tools. Fig. 84 shows the frequencies of the blanks (excluding debris, varia, and cores in both charts). Blades were clearly preferred, rig. »4.

Flakes, bladelets, and primary elements were accordingly used less. When examined by type, the picture is again complex. Table 26 shows the distribution of blanks by type. The selection patterns differ from type to type. As noted above, blades were preferred; this trend is particularly strong for arrowheads and sickle blades (made almost exclusively on blades). In contrast, the burins and pièces esquillées demonstrate selection of flakes. CTEs were not used for arrowheads, sickle blades, or multiple tools, but were preferred for scrapers, notches, burins, and pièces esquillées. Primary elements, which were preferred for scrapers, served as a negative selection factor for most types, especially arrowheads, sickle blades, perforators, and truncations. Bladelets were not used for sickle blades, truncations, scrapers, or burins, and were rarely used for other types as well. It is clear that the choice was made by type, sometimes against the general trend of selection of blades. Some of the blanks were ruled out for some types and preferred for others. There is some evidence for import of blades. The size of some of the blades exceeds the dimensions of the local nodules (e.g., Figs. 45:2; 56:1; 70:6; 80:1-2). On some of the blades fresh cortex, rather than the typical battered cortex, was found. However, there are very few of these blades and it is clear that the vast majority of the blades were prepared locally. SIZE OF TOOLS Tools and waste were weighed in order to evaluate their size, and the weights were compared separately for each blank type (flakes, blades, etc.), and for each tool type. The range of sizes of the tools is very similar to that of the waste. Blanks of all sizes, from the smallest chips to the largest primary elements, were considered suitable for exploitation. However, small items are used less frequently and there is a clear selection of larger items for the tools. The trend is very strong for flakes and primary elements and less pronounced for blades and CTEs. Bladelets are similar in size because they have an arbitrary upper size limit (Fig. 85). While this is true for most tool types, and particularly for scrapers, burins, and varia, there are exceptions; small blanks were used for perforators and sickle blades and to a lesser extent also for arrowheads and truncations (Table 27). Within each type the size selection is more or less consistent across the blanks, although small blanks can be found. SUMMARY Some general trends served as guidelines in the selection of blanks, sometimes against the general 168</page><page sequence="175">THE FLINT TOOLS 'ig. 85.

There is selection of large items, while in the waste almost all items are small. This is a process of overcoming the natural constraints of the raw material by selection. There is a selection of blades, while the majority of items in the waste are flakes. One could expect that if blades were preferred, a more blade-oriented method of knapping would be applied. Since this is not the case, the selection of blanks was probably carried out separately from the reduction sequence (as opposed to a situation in which the blank selection dictates the reduction sequence). In addition to this general trend (and perhaps contradicting it), there is evidence for a very complex selection system of blanks for each type. Different criteria define the ideal blank and a special mental template for each type. Raw material, size, cortex, and blank all play a role in this system. There is some connection between different characteristics of the blanks. Interlocking factors are the size of blanks and the 169</page><page sequence="176">CHAPTER EIGHT Table 28.

This is particularly true for the Ashkelon industry, since no large nodules were available. There are further correlations between raw material and size: the Mishash items are smallest, probably because the nodules are cracked and enable production of fewer large items, and chert items are largest (the chert cores themselves are less exploited) (Fig. 86). This probably reflects a mixture of the natural limitations of the Mishash flint and a human preference not to produce small chert items. Since many of the criteria are interlocked, there is great difficulty in determining which factor was most significant. For some types, it is possible to reconstruct the system of preferences. Fig. 87 is an attempt at a schematic summary of the considerations leading to the final selection of blank. While the main trends are represented, the reality is naturally more complex. Fig. 86.

HISTORY OF RESEARCH After Kathleen Kenyon's excavations at Jericho (Kenyon 1957; 1960; 1981), the accepted sequence for the southern Levant Neolithic period comprised four phases, correlating with the stratigraphie section at Jericho. The sequence starts with two Pre-Pottery phases (PPNA and PPNB), followed by a gap of several hundred years and then two Pottery Neolithic phases (PNA and PNB). The gap in the stratigraphie sequence at Jericho, as well as the abandonment of several other settlements, led to the conclusion that the PPNB settlement system collapsed and the southern Levant was completely abandoned or fell back into a nomadic way of life (see, e.g., Kenyon 1960; Perrot 1968). In 1977 Tamar Noy suggested a local sequence for the Israeli coastal plain (Noy 1977). She defined a phase termed "Yavne Yam", an intermediate phase between the PPNB (hardly represented in the coastal plain) and the PN. To this phase she assigned several sites surveyed in the region of Yavne Yam (Burian and Friedman 1965) and the site of Ashkelon, known at that time only from the excavation of Perrot in 1955. The material culture of this phase, according to Noy, is characterized by flint assemblages that resemble those of the PNA but totally lacks pottery. Beyond the Israeli coastal plain, the same features characterized two sites: Layer II at Tel Ramad in Syria (for final publication see de Contenson 2000) and Labwe in Lebanon (Kirkbride 1969). Based on l4C dates from the latter two sites, Noy suggested the first half of the eighth millennium as a plausible date for the Yavne Yam phase, thus closing, at least to some degree, the gap between the PPNB and PN (Noy 1977). Unfortunately, Noy 's work, published in Hebrew and based on very scanty information, received little response. In the late 1980s, following the excavations of Rollefson at 'Ain Ghazal, it became clear that an intermediate phase exists between the PPNB and the PN. This phase was termed by the excavator "Pre-Pottery Neolithic C" (Rollefson 1989), although the term "final PPNB" is also found in the literature (for example, Bar-Yosef and Meadow 1995; Goring-Morris 1993). The PPNC layer at 'Ain Ghazal was assigned by a series of l4C dates to the first half of the eighth millennium (see Chapter 2), again contradicting the common notion of a gap. Since then several other sites have been dated to the same time span; these include Wadi Shu'eib (Simmons et al. 2001), Wadi Jilat 13 and 25 (Baird 1994), and 'Ain el-Jammam (Wahib and Fino 1997) in Transjordan; layer II at Tel 'Ali (Garfinkel 1994) and layer VI at Hagoshrim (Getzov 1999) in northern Israel; and ' Atlit Yam (Galili et al. 1993) in the Israeli coastal plain. Several other sites, which have not been radiometrically dated, are assigned to the same period, both in the Mediterranean zone of Israel (Garfinkel 1994: 558-559) and in the arid zone of the western Negev (Goring-Morris 1993). As is evident from the accumulation of new sites (Chapter 1, Fig. 1), no settlement gap is evident in the first half of the eighth millennium. Thus a "new" Neolithic phase has been defined chronologically and termed PPNC. However, the question of what material culture relates to this period remains unanswered. 173</page><page sequence="179">CHAPTER NINE 9.2. TECHNOLOGICAL ASPECTS The lithic industry of Ashkelon is characterized by the exploitation of small river pebbles for the production of flakes. This is done, in most cases, by the reduction of cores with a single striking platform. Less abundant methods are the reduction of discoidal cores or cores with opposed striking platforms (the latter for the production of blades). Naviform technology does not occur in the cores or the CTEs. Perrot's excavations at the site yielded an identical assemblage (Perrot and Gopher 1996). The flake orientation of the industry, the high degree of core exploitation, and the variety of types of both cores and tools were all noted. The two assemblages are undoubtedly samples from the same industry. How does this industry compare to other contemporary sites? While the possible comparisons are mainly typological, some technological trends are discernible. The tendency towards the production of flakes was also observed at other sites (Table 29). At both 'Ain Ghazal and Wadi Shu'eib, the blade to flake ratio in the PPNC layer is more similar to the PN layer than the PPNB layer. Notably, at both sites naviform technology was reported, but declines in frequency from the PPNB through the PN (Rollefson 1993; Simmons et al. 2001). A similar decline in the application of naviform technology during the PPNC was observed at Wadi Jilat (Baird 1994) and Tel 'Ali. 9.3. COMPARATIVE TYPOLOGICAL ANALYSIS Table 30 presents the frequencies of various tool types in some PPNC and PN sites. Several types will be compared in detail. ARROWHEADS The arrowheads of the Levantine Neolithic were discussed in detail by Gopher (1994), though according to the traditional four-phase sequence. In his view the relative proportions of large vs. small arrowheads can serve as a chronological scale, since there is a decrease over time in the size of arrowheads. As mentioned above, the bimodal distinction between large and small arrowheads does not fit the assemblage of Ashkelon, where medium-sized arrowheads were found. The average length of the arrowheads at Ashkelon is 46.7 mm (Table 21 above). This value is intermediate between PPNB assemblages (like layers 3-6 at Munhata, Jericho, Yiftahel, and Abu Ghosh) measuring about 60 mm and PN assemblages (like Giv'at Haparsa, Herzliya, Jericho, and layer 2 at Munhata) measuring around 30 mm (Gopher 1994: Appendix k-p). Intermediate values were also recorded at other PPNC sites. At 'Ain Ghazal the average is 47.8 mm for the PPNC compared to 56.8 mm for the PPNB and 34. 1 mm for the PN (Rollefson 1993: 96). At Tel 'Ali eight arrowheads were defined as medium-sized and ten as large, without metric data (Garfinkel 1994: 555). At ' Atlit Yam the arrowheads were defined as Table 29.

"characteristic of post-PPNB assemblages" (Galili et al. 1993: 142), again without metric data. Typologically, the assemblage of Ashkelon is dominated by the Byblos type and by a relatively large number of small arrowheads (the Haparsa, Nizzanim, and Herzliya types). The Jericho and Amuq types are hardly represented. A high frequency of the Byblos type was also found at 'Atlit Yam (Galili et al. 1993: 142), Tel 'Ali (Garfinkel 1994: Table 5), and Wadi Shu'eib (Simmons et al. 2001: Table 3). In contrast to Ashkelon, at all these sites the Byblos type was accompanied by significant numbers of the Amuq type and by hardly any small arrowheads. The typological picture fits the results of Gopher's work. According to Gopher, at the beginning of the eighth millennium the Byblos type dominates the Levantine assemblages, the Amuq type is found in smaller numbers but reaches a peak at about this time, the Jericho type is in steep decline, and small arrowheads first appear (Gopher 1994: Fig. 6.10). Given the low frequency of the Amuq type and the high frequency of small arrowheads, the assemblage of Ashkelon should be slightly later than those of 'Atlit Yam, Tel 'Ali, and Wadi Shu'eib. However, the very early radiometric dates from Ashkelon do not support this. At PN sites in the southern coastal plain, a higher frequency of small arrowheads was found. At Ziqim the frequency is about 60% (Garfinkel et al. 2002) or 40% in a larger surface collection (Noy 1975), at Lod 33% (Blockman 1997), at Nizzanim 70%, and at Giv'at Haparsa 95% (Gopher 1994: Table 6.11). Among the larger arrowheads at Ziqim (Garfinkel et al. 2002) and at Lod (Blockman 1997) both the Amuq and the Byblos types are present, at Nizzanim only the Amuq type is present, and at Giv'at Haparsa only the Byblos type is present (Gopher 1994: Table 6. 1 1). A continuous increase in frequencies of small arrowheads is evident, as well as the disappearance of the Jericho type and a decrease 175</page><page sequence="181">CHAPTER NINE in frequency of the Amuq type (despite the exceptional high frequency at Nizzanim). KNIVES Altogether 77 knives were found at Neolithic Ashkelon, 58 from the new excavation and 17 tabular knives and two bifacial knives reported from Perrot's excavation (Perrot and Gopher 1996: Table 2, Fig. 9). These figures make Ashkelon an extremely knife-rich site, justifying the term "Ashkelon knife" given to the knife made on tabular flint in order to differentiate it from the tile knife made on a cortical blade. Knives have a wide geographical distribution in the central and southern Levant. Thus, on the one hand this group can serve as a vital connection between the Mediterranean core area sites and the desert sites of the Negev and eastern Jordan. On the other hand, however, knives are known from the various chronological phases of the eighth millennium BP (the PPNC and PN). Thus, they cannot be used as a fossile directeur for either the PPNC or the PN. Nevertheless, the knife is an important new tool type that may be of economic significance. Knives are known from various PPNC sites. Five bifacial knives, but no tabular knives, were reported from ' Atlit Yam (Galili et al. 1993: Table 2, Fig. 12:8). At Tel 'Ali two items were found (Garfinkel 1994: 556, Fig. 4:5). At Wadi Shu'eib bifacial knives were reported mainly from the PPNC, but the different definition of a knife applied there prevents quantitative comparison; however, tabular knives were reported only from the PN layer (Simmons et al. 2001: 14). At 'Ain Ghazal knives were reported from all layers, with increasing numbers in the PPNC, at least some being tabular (Rollefson and Kafafi 1994; 1996; 1997; Kafafi and Rollefson 1995). Quite a large number of bifacial knives, usually made on tabular flint, were reported from Dhuweila (Betts et al. 1998: Figs. 4.26-4.29) and Tel Ramad (de Contenson 2000). Knives are also known from PN sites. They are documented at almost every site in the southern coastal plain: six tabular and two cortical knives at Ziqim (Garfinkel et al. 2002), five tabular and ten bifacial knives at Nizzanim (Yeivin and Olami 1979: 126: Figs. 13:3-9; 14), one knife at Giv'at Haparsa (Olami et al. 1977: Fig. 14:4), and one tabular and one bifacial knife at Lod (Blockman 1997: 36). In Transjordan knives are reported from PN contexts at Wadi Shu'eib (Simmons et al. 2001), 'Ain Ghazal (e.g., Rollefson and Kafafi 1997: Table 3), Shayyeh (Palumbo and Parenti 1997), and several other sites. In the Jordan Valley knives are reported from PNA Jericho (Crowfoot-Payne 1983: 710, Fig. 338), Munhata (Gopher 1989: Fig. 54.1:1-5, Table 21), Sha'ar Hagolan (Matskevich 2005), and other sites. It seems that the first half of the eighth millennium witnessed an upsurge in the importance and frequency of knives and an increase in the variety of shapes and raw materials. Tabular flint knives appear for the first time in significant numbers, more typically at sites in southern Israel and Transjordan. A key to the understanding of Neolithic knives, especially the cortical flint knives, may lie in the sites of the Tuwailan industry in the western Negev. Among these sites are two (Har Qeren V and XIV) that were workshops for the production of cortical knives (Goring-Morris 1993; Goring-Morris et al. 1994). Unlike at Ashkelon, the appropriate raw materials are found in the vicinity of the sites. However, the origin of the knives found at Ashkelon is still unknown, as none of the sites designated "Tuwailan" have yielded such tabular knives. It has been suggested that the knives are part of a package of equipment related to butchery and pastoralism (Goring-Morris 1993; Goring-Morris et al. 1994; Sharon and Goring-Morris 2004). Pastoralism need not be limited to arid zones but can appear in the Mediterranean core area as part of a mixed economy (Rollefson and Köhler-Rollefson 1993). If so, the abundance of knives at Ashkelon, together with the plenitude of animal bones, is not surprising, and nor is the increasing importance of this type in a period of intensifying domestication processes. BIFACES Bifaces appear at Ashkelon in a very low frequency (0.7%), making any discussion tentative. At other 176</page><page sequence="182">COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF THE FLINT INDUSTRY sites they were found in higher frequencies (Table 30). This low frequency may indicate a functional singularity. The only PPNC bifacial assemblage described in detail to date is that from ' Atlit Yam (Barkai and Galili 2003). Small trapezoid, triangular, or rectangular axes were found, with an active edge sometimes polished but sometimes only bifacially shaped. Chisels were also found; they are never polished and have a narrow active edge. There is a resemblance between the assemblage of 'Atlit Yam and that of Ashkelon in sizes, shapes, and technology, though the bifaces of Ashkelon are shorter. A low frequency of bifaces is typical of PN coastal plain sites like Ziqim, Nizzanim, and Lod (Table 30). The axes are small and polished, in accordance with the finds at Ashkelon. The low frequency, in itself typical, hinders further comparisons. SICKLE BLADES The frequency of sickle blades at Ashkelon (12.9%) is an intermediate value between the lower frequencies atTransjordanian sites like 'Ain Ghazal and Wadi Shu'eib, and the higher frequencies at sites in northern Israel like Tel 'Ali and 'Atlit Yam (Table 30). Intermediate values, though lower, were found at other coastal plain sites like Ziqim, Nizzanim, and Lod. There is a clear regional trend to the frequency of sickle blades (see also Bar- Yosef 1981a). Typologically, about 90% of the sickle blades at Ashkelon are coarsely denticulated (type A at Jericho; Crowfoot-Payne 1983). At Tel 'Ali this type comprises about two thirds of the assemblage and is accompanied by finely denticulated sickle blades, typical of the PPNB (Garfinkel 1994: Table 5). At 'Atlit Yam most sickle blades are coarsely denticulated and none are typical of the PPNB (Galili et al. 1993: 142). Coarsely denticulated sickle blades are also reported from Tel Ramad (de Contenson 2000) and Labwe (Kirkbride 1969). No data from 'Ain Ghazal and Wadi Shu'eib have yet been published. The typical PPNB sickle blades occur at Ashkelon in a very low frequency (less than 3% of the sickle blades); the same low frequency is reported from 'Atlit Yam, though not from Tel Ali. The change from finely denticulated PPNB sickle blades to coarsely denticulated PPNC blades is technological as well as typological. At PPNB Munhata, for example, the sickle blades were "... made on straight blades produced from bipolar cores..." and were interpreted as ripping knives (Gopher 1989: 45). Although their dimensions are not mentioned, it is evident from the figures that they are relatively long (Gopher 1989: Figs. 16-17). Such blades are very rare at Ashkelon. The assumed use of long PPNB sickle blades as ripping knives is very well known (Noy 1996 and references therein). The transition to the PPNC sickle blades is manifested in the technology used for the production of blades, the shaping of the tools, the hafting method, and consequently also the harvesting method. Between the PPNC and the PN, however, greater continuity is evident. Sickle blades of type A continue to appear (more typically in Yarmukian assemblages), accompanied by types B and C (flat and retouched types more typical of Jericho IX assemblages). The frequency of type A varies between assemblages. At PN Jericho, about half of the sickle blades are type A, a quarter type B, and a quarter type C (Crowfoot- Payne 1983: 708-7 10, Tables 18-22). At Ziqim, type A comprises about 92%, type B 6.5%, and type C is not represented (Garfinkel et al. 2002). At Nizzanim and Giv'at Haparsa, all three types are present; although the frequencies were not discussed, from the published illustrations type A appears to dominate (Olami et al. 1977; Yeivin and Olami 1979). At Sha' ar Hagolan, ca. 90% of the sickle blades are of type A (Alperson and Garfinkel 2002). Other assemblages are dominated by types B and C; these include, for example, Lod (Blockman 1997: 35) and Hagoshrim (Khalaily 1999). There is some correlation between type A sickle blades and Yarmukian assemblages vs. types B and C and Jericho IX assemblages (Gopher 1993). This correlation is not clear-cut, as is readily apparent from the assemblage of Jericho IX itself. However, the Ashkelon and 'Atlit Yam assemblages are more similar in composition to Yarmukian assemblages. 177</page><page sequence="183">CHAPTER NINE The retouch shaping the denticulation has been described in several ways. Perrot and Gopher (1996) described the sickle blades from Ashkelon as being shaped by flat bifacial retouch, the same description was applied to those from PN Munhata (Gopher 1989), Garfinkel (1994: 555) described the sickle blades from Tel 'Ali as being shaped by semi-pressure retouch, and Khalaili (1999: 27) described the PN sickle blades from Hagoshrim as being shaped by bifacial retouch, more pronounced on the dorsal face. As far as one can judge, all three descriptions refer to the same kind of retouch. The control needed to make even notches is almost impossible to attain with direct percussion, is more feasible with indirect percussion, but is very easily achieved with pressure retouch, creating the desired results of similar round scars. Thus the appropriate description appears to be pressure retouch, in line with the application of the technique to a wide range of types in the Ashkelon assemblage. PERFORATORS Perforators comprise 12.8% of the assemblage at Ashkelon. Most of them are small delicate awls, while borers are almost completely lacking. At Tel 'Ali, a similar proportion of perforators was found, but half of them were borers (Garfinkel 1994: Table 5). Lower proportions of perforators were found at Wadi Shu'eib and 'Ain Ghazal (Table 30), again with a significant number of borers. At ' Atlit Yam, perforators were not found (Galili et al. 1993: Table 2). The abundance of small awls at Ashkelon thus appears to be unique among PPNC assemblages. PN coastal assemblages are not consistent; while Ziqim also contains a significant component of small perforators, other sites do not (Table 30). Worth mentioning is a small site in the vicinity of Ziqim, which was only tested; it was described as a workshop specializing in perforators (Noy and Berman 1974). SCRAPERS Scrapers form 4.2% of the assemblage of Ashkelon. At other sites they are found in various frequencies, which are significantly higher in Transjordanian sites (Table 30). Typological details have been published for Tel 'Ali (Garfinkel 1994: Table 5) and 'Ain Ghazal (Rollefson et al. 1994). The variability is high and no consistent patterns were identified. Notable are the pressure-retouched scrapers found at Ashkelon; these are also found at Sha'ar Hagolan (Matskevich 2005). They accord well with the increased application of pressure retouch in general. NOTCHES AND DENTICULATES Notches and denticulates, like scrapers, were found in relatively high frequencies in the Transjordanian sites (Table 30). A typological comparison is not possible, since little attention is usually paid to this type (and this report is no different). The gradation between denticulates and scrapers noticed at Ashkelon was seen at 'Ain Ghazal and Tel 'Ali as well. BURINS Burins were found in a very low frequency (1.3%) at Ashkelon. At other PPNC sites, particularly in the Transjordanian sites, they were found in higher frequencies (Table 30). The relative importance of burins at 'Ain Ghazal has been discussed in detail (Rollefson 1995) and attention must be drawn to the burin sites in eastern Jordan. Clearly, burins did not play a significant role in the coastal plain of Israel. PIÈCES ESQUILLÉES Pièces esquillées were found in large numbers at Ashkelon, their frequency is much lower at Tel 'Ali, and they are not reported from other PPNC sites. They are reported from PN coastal plain sites like Ziqim, Nizzanim, and Giv'at Haparsa (where they were named "cutting pieces", Olami et al. 1977), but not from Lod. Again, Ashkelon stands out among PPNC assemblages, its characteristics more closely resembling those of PN coastal plain sites. 9.4. DISCUSSION 1. THE PPNB AND THE PPNC Some marked differences are evident between the flint assemblage of Ashkelon and the PPNB industries: 178</page><page sequence="184">COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF THE FLINT INDUSTRY 1 Naviform technology is not found, and even opposed striking platform cores are found only in small numbers. 2 Pink and purple flint is found in very small quantities and is not used for elaborate types like sickle blades and arrowheads. During the PPNB purple flint is found in slightly higher frequencies but was used for preferred types; for example Gopher states of PPNB arrowheads that "in many assemblages a large proportion of the tools was fashioned on pink-violet flint" (Gopher 1994: 200). 3 Arrowheads are smaller and shaped by more intensive pressure retouch. 4 A new type of sickle blade, coarsely denticulated, is found. 5 Tabular knives are found in greater numbers. Nonetheless, some continuity from the PPNB is discernible at Ashkelon and other sites (Banning et al. 1994; Nissen 1993): 1 Naviform technology is reported from most other PPNC sites, although in declining importance. 2 There is continuity in the development of arrowheads. 3 Most types, including tabular knives, already occur in PPNB assemblages. 2. THE PPNC AND THE PN The assemblage of Ashkelon shows a very marked similarity to PN assemblages, especially those of the southern coastal plain. The same raw materials are exploited, the same types are found, and continuation is seen in the development of both arrowheads and sickle blades, not to mention a similar location of sites on the western kurkar ridge. A great similarity between PPNC and PN industries was also noted at 'Ain Ghazal, to the extent that the excavator declares: "The Yarmukians were simply PPNC people with pots" (Rollefson 1993: 98). Thus, while the similarity between the PPNC and PN assemblages is readily apparent, the relationship between the PPNB and the PPNC is more ambivalent. Three parallel ceramic traditions have recently been suggested for the PN (Garfinkel 1999b): the northern Yarmukian, the southern Jericho IX, and the coastal Nizzanim ware. During the PPNC, regional differences have been noted as well. These are often highlighted for the Transjordanian sites (Kuijt 2000; Simmons 2000); similar site sizes, locations, and stratigraphie sequences are noted, as well as high frequencies of burins and scrapers and low frequencies of sickle blades (Rollefson 1995; Simmons et al. 2001). Another regional industry has been identified in the western Negev and termed the Tuwailan (Goring-Morris 1993; Goring-Morris et al. 1994). In the southern coastal plain, Ashkelon is the only PPNC site excavated so far. Given the great similarity between Ashkelon and PN coastal sites, it is plausible to define a third regional tradition. The term "Yavne Yam" has already been suggested for eighth-millennium sites (Noy 1977). In order to separate chronological from material cultural terms, we suggest PPNC as a broad chronological term and "Yavne Yam industry" for the material culture typical of the southern coastal plain. Other industries of the same period are the Tuwailan of the Negev and the industry of Transjordan, which should properly be termed Ghazalan. In northern Israel the situation is not yet clear, but in due time an additional entity or two would also be defined. In summary, some common traits of the PPNC and the PN are coarsely denticulated sickle blades, smaller arrowheads, and the widening of the repertoire of knives. Other characteristics, like the abundance of awls and pièces esquillées at Ashkelon and of burins, scrapers, notches, and denticulates in the Transjordanian sites, should be regarded as regional hallmarks, reflecting different settlement types. 179</page><page sequence="185">PART IV: MATERIAL CULTURE AND BURIALS</page><page sequence="186">CHAPTER 10 GROUND STONE TOOLS, CHIPPED STONE, WHITE WARE, A CLAY INSTALLATION, AND VARIOUS MINERALS Down Dag and Yosef Garfinkel 10.1. GROUND STONE TOOLS Stone tools are a basic component of the material culture of the Neolithic period, being found in large quantities at every Neolithic village site (see, e.g., Dorell 1983; Wright 1992; 2000; Gopher and Orrelle 1995). At Ashkelon an assemblage of 109 ground stone tools was uncovered. Among these, nine derive from insecure contexts, the surface, or balks, but according to their typology probably belong to the Neolithic occupation. Four additional tools were found in Chalcolithic pits and are discussed in Appendix C. TYPOLOGY OF THE GROUND STONE TOOLS Almost all of the items are broken, indicating that they were abandoned at the site only after they went out of use. The typology is presented in Table 31 and selected examples are shown in Figs. 88-93. The repertoire includes only small items: bowls, a small grinding slab, handstones, palettes, weights, perforated disks, disks, a shaft straightener, percussors, various tools, bracelets, and decorative items. No heavy grinding implements were found. In Perrot's excavation an assemblage of 41 items with a rather similar composition was reported Table 31. Frequencies of stone tools and raw materials.

For the benefit of the reader, drawings of the stone items published by Perrot are presented below in Figs. 94-95. Bowls Ten bowls were found, nine made of limestone and one of kurkar. Most are small rim fragments of small globular bowls, 90-120 mm in diameter and about 50 mm deep (Fig. 88:2-5). They are smoothed on the inside, while the outside remains rough. They are usually made on small soft limestone pebbles and the outside, though not carefully treated, is still round. The sides and base are thick. In one case (Fig. 88:4) the preparation technique is evident, since chisel marks are visible on the inside. Another item is a complete small, shallow bowl, about 50 mm in diameter and 20 mm deep. The outside has been roughly shaped by flaking and the base is flat (Fig. 88:6). One of the bowls, made of hard gray limestone, is of much better workmanship. The sides are very thin, with a smoothed/polished finish, and decorated by two incised parallel lines around the rim (Fig. 88:1; Photo 126). This item belongs to a totally different tradition of workmanship, indicating craft specialization in stone tools, and was probably produced outside the site. Another such item was Photo 126. Stone bowl fragment with incised decoration (photograph B. Boaz). apparently found at Ashkelon by Perrot. This is a small shallow bowl, carefully made, with a ring base (Fig. 95:2 below). Grinding slab One grinding slab was found (Fig. 88:7). It is made from a thick block of basalt. Its upper side is polished and slightly concave. One similar item was reported from Perrot's excavatioifs (Fig. 94:9 Fig. 88. Stone items: 1-6 bowls; 7 grinding slab; 8-10 handstones; 11-15 palettes.

Both items are rather moderate in size and do not belong to the massive type of grinding slab known from Neolithic village sites. Handstones An assemblage of 11 handstones (active grinding stones) was found (Fig. 88:8-11). They are small, 50-80 mm in maximum length and 15-50 mm in thickness. The periphery of the item is shaped by grinding, pecking, or flaking. They are mainly made on limestone, sometimes on basalt or beachrock, and occasionally on a soft type of limestone. The basalt used is actually scoria, a light, soft stone (Fig. 88:8). These items are not suitable for heavy grinding activity, and indeed no massive grinding slabs were found at the site. However, these handstones do bear evidence of grinding, as at least one of their sides is either smoothed or polished. Perrot's excavations uncovered a few items of this kind as well, defined as "processors" (Perrot and Gopher 1996: 160-161). Palettes Seven small items are classified as palettes and were made of a variety of raw materials: hard limestone, basalt, and schist (Figs. 88:12-15; 89:9; Photo 127). They are rather flat, shaped into a rounded or rectangular outline, and their upper side is Photo 127. Light basalt (scoria) palette (photograph B. Boaz). usually well smoothed or even polished. Delicate grinding or other work was apparently carried out on the working surface. One disk-shaped item is made of hard reddish limestone. It is about 90 mm in diameter and 10 mm thick. In the middle of each side is a shallow depression about 10 mm in diameter and 1 mm deep, and around it radial lines are engraved (Fig. 89:9). Weights Three weights were found, all broken. They are made of oval limestone pebbles (Fig. 89:1-3). One of them is perforated in the center by drilling (Fig. 89:3). The other two have deep biconical depressions from both sides, which were created by battering (Fig. 89: 1-2); they were probably pierced as well, but the hole was in the missing part. The weight of these items is estimated as 200-600 g. Perforated disks Two perforated disks, sometimes called "spindle whorls", were found (Fig. 89:4-5). They are made of limestone, carefully smoothed on all sides. They are pierced by a biconical hole. They are 40-50 mm in diameter, 4-8 mm thick, and with a bore about 6 mm in diameter. Both are fragments, each of a slightly different diameter and thickness. Similar items were reported from Perrot's excavations (below, Fig. 95:5, 7). Disks Eight disks were found, very carefully made, smoothed or even polished (Fig. 89:6-8). They are made of different raw materials: limestone, sandstone, and one of marble-like stone. They are 50-70 mm in diameter and about 10 mm thick. None of them is perforated. The weight of the complete item is estimated as about 80-100 g. Shaft straightener One fragment of a shaft straightener was found (Fig. 89:11). It is made on a rectangular dark- colored sandstone slab. The groove is about 12 mm wide and 4 deep. The item is very smooth and polished, not only in the groove, but on the entire upper surface. 186</page><page sequence="190">GROUND STONE TOOLS, CHIPPED STONE, WHITE WARE, A CLAY INSTALLATION, AND VARIOUS MINERALS Fig. 89.

Nine are complete, five are flakes split by use from percussors, and the rest are broken, usually split in half. This is evidence for intensive use of the percussors until complete destruction; some were used even after they split. Flint was the primary raw material for the percussors, since 22 of them were made from this material (the remaining eight were made from limestone). The shape of 20 percussors could be identified (the rest were too fragmentary); of these, 15 are spherical, two are cubical, and three are discoid. All show very intensive signs of pounding, but the discoid items were used only on the narrow side. In one case signs of polish are superimposed on the pounding marks; this could be a result of some grinding activity, perhaps during the production of flint cores (some abrasion of flakes was noted). The percussors are medium-sized, with a diameter of 40-70 mm and an estimated weight of 100-350 g. Four are much smaller, 20-25 mm in diameter and about 50 g, while four others are larger, around 100 mm in diameter and about 700-1000 g. These percussors were probably used for different purposes, the smaller ones perhaps for retouch and the larger ones for rough knapping. In addition to the percussors, many of the flint cores were used for pounding after their exploitation. Together they indicate a vast activity of pounding with flint items. Twelve hammerstones were reported from Perrot's excavation (Perrot and Gopher 1996: Table 3). 188</page><page sequence="192">GROUND STONE TOOLS, CHIPPED STONE, WHITE WARE, A CLAY INSTALLATION, AND VARIOUS MINERALS Various tools Five items are included in this category. They include: 1 A small chopper made on a small, flat, hard limestone pebble. It is 35 mm long and flaked on one face to create the cutting edge (Fig. 89:10; Photo 128). 2 Two elongated bifacial tools, their end shaped by bifacial chipping and battering. They were probably used as chisels. 3 A soft limestone flake with incisions. 4 A massive soft limestone slab, partly smoothed on its upper side. Bracelets The new excavation of Ashkelon yielded 25 bracelet fragments (Figs. 91-92; Photos 129- 130). They are made of limestone or sandstone. The section is in most cases triangular, rectangular or pentagonal, but is occasionally ovate. The outer diameter of the bracelets (70-120 mm) is less homogeneous than the inner diameter (55-80 mm). Most are 6-15 mm wide but there are six wider items, 20-25 mm wide (Fig. 92:1-6); one of them may be a pendant, since it is perforated near one of the ends (Fig. 92: 1 ; Photo 130). Most items are well finished and polished. They bear no decoration. On two items there are striations on both the outer and the inner surface; these are Photo 128. Limestone chopper (photograph B. Boaz). Photo 129. A group of stone bracelets (photograph B. Boaz). probably remnants of preparation by repetitive grooving. The final stage of good-quality polishing was not performed in these two cases, though at least one of them is worn. Two items (Fig. 92:7-8) are irregular in shape and may be locally made products, unlike the others, which seem to have been imported as complete items. One of the bracelets is perforated (Fig. 92:1; Photos 129-130). Although drilled holes in bracelets are quite rare, a few similar items are known from other sites: Basta (Starek 1988: 139, Fig. 3:8035) and site 1-62 in the southern coastal plain of Israel (Burian and Friedman 1965: PI. 18 lower). The shape and section of each bracelet is unique and the production is thus not standardized, though following the same basic concepts. In this respect a group of five sandstone bracelet fragments (Fig. 91:1-5) is exceptional. They are very similar, 5-6 mm wide and 4-5 mm thick, and all have a 189</page><page sequence="193">CHAPTER TEN Photo 130. Close-up of two sides of the same perforated stone bracelet (photograph B. Boaz). pentagonal section. While the similarity is great, the fragments do not necessarily belong to the same bracelet. Since the raw material is not local, these five fragments may represent import of bracelets from a production center producing items to a great degree of standardization, while the other production is more heterogeneous. Decorative items Six decorative items were found, all presented here in Fig. 93: 1 A small broken disk with three concentric circles (Fig. 93:1). 2 A small disk bead made of polished limestone (Fig. 93:2). 3 One limestone flake with ten shallow holes drilled on one of its surface (Fig. 93:3). The holes are not pierced through. 4 A limestone flake with shallow incisions (Fig. 93:4). 5 A stone rod, conical in shape, decorated with engraving of a circle on the top and parallel lines on one of the sides (Fig. 93:5). Similar items, but made of clay, are known in large quantities from the PN sites of Munhata (Garfinkel 1995: 112-113) and Sha'arHagolan (Stekelis 1972: PI. 59:3; Garfinkel 1999d: 28-29). At Munhata a few such items were made of stone as well (Gopher and Orrelle 1995: Fig. 44:1-5). 6 An elongated limestone object, cylindrical with a wavy cross-section (Fig. 93:6). It is partly smoothed or even slightly polished. It may be a bead. TECHNOLOGY OF THE GROUND STONE TOOLS A variety of raw materials were used for making the stone tools (Table 31). Most are local materials: limestone (63.3%), flint (17.4%), kurkar and beachrock (2.8%), and chert (1.8%). However, 16 tools are made on imported raw materials, or rather were imported as complete tools. These include sandstone (9.2%), basalt (3.7%), and schist (1.8%). The closest sources of basalt and sandstone are in the Ramon Crater 120 km southeast of the site. Fig. 91. Stone bracelets.

All three non-local raw materials are also found in Transjordan (130 km away) and could have been imported from there. This is particularly true for the sandstone items, since most of them are bracelets, paralleled in many sites in Jordan. The methods used for the shaping of the stone tools are diverse; the repertoire of methods is presented in Table 32. For each type there are usually several shaping methods. Sometimes the finishing procedure or use has erased earlier traces of working, and the observations presented here thus reflect the final stage of preparation. On some items more than one shaping method was discerned. Thus, the total number of observations presented in Table 32 is 140 for 109 stone items. The most common method is polishing, found on every type of tool, but mainly on bracelets and bowls. Grinding is also abundant, found on handstones, bowls, weights and decorative items. Pounding is found in high frequencies on percussors and on two weights. Drilling was used for perforating weights and, together with incision, is the main decorative technique. Table 32.

The absence of heavy grinding tools The assemblage of Ashkelon is characterized by two groups of artifacts. On the one hand, there are small utilitarian objects, like percussors, handstones, bowls, and weights. On the other hand, there are many decorative items. Missing from the assemblage are the heavy ground stone tools: querns, grinding slabs, mortars, and pestles. Such items are known from other PPNC sites such as Tel 'Ali (Garfinkel 1992b: 60-62, Table 42), 'Atlit Yam (Galili 1987), and 'Ain Ghazal (Rollefson and Kafafì 1994; 1996; 1997; Kafafi and Rollefson 1995). However, all of these are village sites located in more favorable ecological zones. As a rather large area was excavated at Ashkelon, the absence of heavy grinding tools is unlikely to be the result of sampling bias, but must be taken into account when considering the site's function. This will be further discussed at the end of this report. 2. The appearance of weights Weights are rare in PPNB sites but become common from the eighth millennium BP onwards. At the PN site of Sha'ar Hagolan, hundreds of stone weights, of various sizes and made from different raw materials, were found. At the PPNC site of 'Atlit Yam, the weights constitute 6.5% of the stone tools and are associated with fishing (Galili et al. 2002). The low frequency of weights at Ashkelon appears to indicate that they were not an important component of the site. If they are indeed associated with fishing, or with weaving, these were not intensively practiced. 3. Bracelets Twenty-five bracelet fragments were found, comprising nearly 23% of the total stone tools. This is an exceptionally high proportion for this typological category, which usually appears in rather small quantities at Neolithic sites in Israel, for example two items at PPNB Abu Ghosh (Lechevallier 1978), two items at PPNC 'Atlit Yam (Galili et al. 1993), and one item at PN Lod (Blockman 1997). In Jordan, on the other hand, bracelets are quite common. At the late PPNB site of Ba'ja, a workshop for the manufacture of the bracelets was found (Gebel and Bienert 1997) and they are very common at the nearby contemporary site of Basta (Starek 1988). At PPNC sites in Jordan bracelets are also found in rather large quantities, such as the 95 items found at 'Ain Ghazal in the 1993-1996 seasons alone (Rollefson and Kafafi 1994: 3 1 ; 1996: Table 6; 1997: Table 6; Kafafi and Rollefson 1995: Table 6), and those from Wadi Shu'eib (Simmons et al. 2001: 21). A few bracelets were found at the PPNC site of el-Kowm 2 in Syria as well (Stordeur 2000: 216). Though the sites are not exactly contemporaneous, there is a remarkable resemblance between the bracelets of Ashkelon and those reported from Ba'ja and Basta. The resemblance includes sections that are very often triangular or pentagonal, the size (especially the inner diameter), and the production technology (oblique striation is evident on items from both Ashkelon and Jordan; Starek 1988). Eight (32%) of the bracelets from Ashkelon were made of sandstone. This raw material was imported to the site but occurs locally in the vicinity of Ba'ja and Basta. It is very plausible that stone bracelets were imported from Transjordan to Ashkelon; archaeometric studies may shed light on this aspect (Thais et al. 1997). The imported bracelets, together with the chunks of exotic minerals (see below), Red Sea shells (Chapter 18), and obsidian (Chapters 11, 19), indicate that the inhabitants of Ashkelon were deeply involved with long-distance exchange networks. 10.2. CHIPPED STONE In addition to the chipped flint industry, many chipped limestone and quartz items were found (Figs. 96-97). The presence in the site of the many pebbles used for construction of hearths and installations resulted in some chipping of artifacts. This was particularly true for the hearths, in which the exposure of limestone pebbles to heat and fire resulted in cracking and flaking. A cautious 197</page><page sequence="201">CHAPTER TEN Fig. 96. Limestone flakes. 198</page><page sequence="202">GROUND STONE TOOLS, CHIPPED STONE, WHITE WARE, A CLAY INSTALLATION, AND VARIOUS MINERALS Fig. 97. Limestone flakes. 199</page><page sequence="203">CHAPTER TEN approach was needed in order to separate such accidental chipping from intentional limestone knapping. Several criteria were used to stay on the safe side of the intentional assemblage. First, only scarred dorsal faces were defined as intentional; dorsal faces that were 100% cortical were defined as accidental, resulting in some loss of primary flakes. Second, all burnt items were defined as accidental. Third, only items with clear flaking characteristics, such as bulb of percussion or striking platform, were defined as intentional. The result of these strict criteria is an intentionally knapped assemblage of 304 items (out of several thousand objects initially examined). These were treated in much the same manner as the chipped flint artifacts. The composition of the assemblage is presented in Table 33. It is evident that the assemblage is characterized by a very high proportion of flakes. It is likely, however, that with a different methodology a higher proportion of primary elements would have been detected. The raw material breakdown of the assemblage is presented in Table 34. While most are made of local rocks, two are imported basalt flakes. The non-flint component could have resulted from several processes: 1 Flakes could be byproducts of flint knapping, being derived from cortex cover. However, most of the flint nodules used have battered cortex rather than a chalky cover, and thus only a minority of the flint cores could have yielded limestone flakes as byproducts. 2 Flakes could be byproducts of the preparation of ground stone artifacts. However, the small Table 33. Composition of the chipped stone assemblage. In |% Chips 68 224 Chunks 5 L6 Primary elements 7 23 Flakes 206 67.8 Blade/lets 5 L6 Tools 13 43 Total 1 304 1 100 Table 34.

Although chipped limestone from protohistoric sites is not very often discussed in the literature, an exceptional pioneering example is presented by Gilead and Fabian (1995). They describe a Chalcolithic assemblage from the site of Grar. There, as at Ashkelon, the assemblage is greatly dominated by flakes. However, unlike at Ashkelon, the frequency of tools is very high. While at Grar there seems to be an industry oriented towards the production of chipped limestone tools, at Ashkelon such an industry plays only a secondary role in producing the chipped limestone assemblage. 10.3. WHITE WARE A few fragments of White Ware vessels were found at Neolithic Ashkelon. These include one thick rim of a large bowl or a shallow basin (Fig. 98; Square E/16, Locus 81, Basket 1035). In addition there are 11 small fragments, from which the shape of the complete vessel cannot be reconstructed. Portable containers made of lime have been discovered at various Pre-Pottery Neolithic sites. 200</page><page sequence="204">GROUND STONE TOOLS, CHIPPED STONE, WHITE WARE, A CLAY INSTALLATION, AND VARIOUS MINERALS Fig. 98. A rim fragment of a White Ware vessel. The earliest appearance is during the PPNB. White Ware vessels of this period from 'Ain Ghazal have been described in detail (Kafafì 1986; Rollefson 1990). In the first seasons at 'Ain Ghazal 48 White Ware items were discovered, 34 from the PPNB, seven from the PPNC, and five from the PN (Rollefson 1990: 36). The variety of shapes is limited, comprising only a few types of open vessels: deep bowls, shallow bowls, and basins. During the first half of the eighth millennium BP in the northern Levant, White Ware vessels occur at various sites: Stratum II at Tell Ramad, Labwe, Neba' Fa'ur, and Stratum Va at Ugarit (Garfinkel 1999b: 12-15 and references therein). The largest collection of vessels, in both number of items and variety of shapes, has been reported from Tell el- Kowm in Syria. A detailed typological discussion appears in the excavation report (Dornemann 1986). It is interesting to see that at this stage closed vessels were also manufactured in White Ware technique. In the southern Levant, White Ware vessels are reported from 'Ain Ghazal, Stratum II at Tel 'Ali, and probably at the base of Tel Dan (Garfinkel 1999b: 12-15). 10.4. A CLAY INSTALLATION One item made of unbaked clay was found at Ashkelon (Fig. 99; Square G/12, Loc. 371, Basket 5997). It is ca. 10 cm long, 7 cm wide and 4 cm thick. On both sides there are parallel straight elongated depressions with rounded cross-sections. These depressions are the negatives of organic material, either reeds or small wooden branches, which has decayed over time. This is probably the small remaining fragment of a much larger installation. It reflects a technology of smearing wet clay over a wood or reed construction. A similar item, but made of plaster, was reported from el-Kowm 2, a site in Syria dated to the eighth millennium BP (Stordeur 2000: 38, Fig. 1). The same technology was used in the PPNB for the construction of large anthropomorphic statues (Bar-Yosef and Alon 1988; Tubb and Grissom 1995). 10.5. VARIOUS MINERALS A variety of exotic, usually imported, minerals were found at the Neolithic site of Ashkelon. Some of them are discussed in other sections of this report, but in order to emphasize this phenomenon all the relevant information is summarized here. The imported minerals include the following: 1 Obsidian. Fourteen items were found, weighing together ca. 12 g. The obsidian is discussed in Chapter 11. 2 Sandstone. Various items made of sandstone were discussed above in the section on ground stone tools (10.1). These include disks and bracelets. 3 Basalt. A number of stone tools made of basalt are described in section 10.1. In addition, 15 chunks of basalt were found, weighing together 318 g. These are unworked, rather small fragments, which seem to be splinters from stone tools that were broken during use. Fig. 99. A fragment of a clay installation. 201</page><page sequence="205">CHAPTER TEN Photo 131. A chunk of green mineral (photograph G. Laron). 4 Schist. Two items made of this mineral were found, a palette and a chisel. 5 Green stone. A small chunk of unworked green copper mineral. It measures 13x9x6 mm and weighs 1 g (Photo 131). This item probably originated in the Feinan region of Transjordan or the Timna area near Eilat. Beads made of copper minerals have been found in various Neolithic sites, like Jericho (Wheeler 1983), Abu Ghosh (Lechevallier 1978: 80), Nahal Oren (Noy et al. 1973: 88, Fig. 7:17), and Yiftahel (Garfinkel 1987b). Unworked chunks were found at some of the sites as well. At Nizzamin, a PN site in the southern coastal plain, a chunk of green copper was reported, also unworked (Yeivin and Olami 1979). 6 Blue stone. A small unworked chunk of a blue mineral. It measures 24 x 22 x 5 mm and weighs 3 g (Photo 132). It appears to be azurite (Y. Goren, personal communication). Natural exposures of this mineral are found in Transjordan. 7 Black stone. A small unworked chunk of a dense Photo 132. A chunk of bluish sandstone mineral (photograph G. Laron). black stone. It measures 12 x 7 x 6 mm and weighs 1 g. It appears to be agate or hematite. 8 Quartz. A large unworked chunk of quartz crystal. It measures 35 x 34 x 34 mm and weighs 67.5 g. 9 Pumice. About twenty chunks of a whitish to yellowish, very light, and spongy sediment. This is pumice, a light volcanic sediment created during volcanic eruptions in the Mediterranean basin, which floats on the sea's surface and is eventually deposited on the shore (see Chapter 19). In the PPNC the shoreline was about 700 m away and the pumice, like the Mediterranean seashells, was probably collected by the Neolithic inhabitants and brought to the site. It is not clear whether the pumice had a specific purpose or was collected out of curiosity. 202</page><page sequence="206">CHAPTER 11 THE OBSIDIAN Yosef Garfinkel 11.1 THE DATA Altogether 14 obsidian items were recovered, all in the 1998 season (Fig. 100; some examples are shown in Photo 133). Table 35 gives data for each item. The 14 items, most of them broken, include seven bladelets, three chips, two chunks, a flake, and a blade. An additional unretouched obsidian blade was found during Perrot's excavation, in his Locus 13 (Perrot and Gopher 1996: 151). In Chapter 19 the provenance of ten of the obsidian items is presented. Six of them originate from Göllü Dag, while the remaining four are from Nenezi Dag. The ratio of obsidian to flint is 14:36,786, i.e., 1 :2628. In Perrot's assemblage the ratio of obsidian Photo 133.

Obsidian artifacts. account; by weight the ratio is about 1:7000 (for the 1998 items only). This low ratio accords well with the distance between Ashkelon and the nearest obsidian sources in Anatolia (some 800 km): the obsidian had to travel a very long distance, probably changing hands several times on the way. Indeed, all of the items show at least some degree of wear, and in some cases they are very worn. On their way to Ashkelon, the obsidian items apparently lost their utilitarian value while gaining status as exotic material. There is little doubt that by the time the obsidian items reached the site they were no longer considered functional, but rather were viewed as decorative and/or status objects. Despite the small absolute number of obsidian items and their very small total weight, Ashkelon was not a backwater in the Neolithic obsidian exchange network. As we shall see below, when our assemblage is compared with other sites in the southern Levant a total different picture emerges. 11.2. ASHKELON AND NEOLITHIC OBSIDIAN EXCHANGE NETWORKS The geological formations of obsidian have a limited distribution in the Near East and are located on its northern border, in today's Turkey and Armenia. Numerous studies have been devoted to the study of obsidian sources and the origin of specific artifacts unearthed in archaeological sites in the region (see, for example, Renfrew et al. 1966; Wright and Gordus 1969; Perlman and Yellin 1978; 1980; Yellin and Garfinkel 1986; Cauvin et al. 1998; see also Chapter 19). However, less attention has been paid to the cultural implications of quantity in obsidian distribution. The eighth millennium BP has been divided into two units: the PPNC (the first half) and the PN (the second half).

Within each period, the sites are organized from north to south. Two general models are utilized in analyzing exchange networks: "down the line trade systems" or "trade between centers" (Renfrew 1982). In the first case, there is a direct correlation between the amount of obsidian at any given site and the distance between that site and the obsidian formation. In the second case, larger amounts of obsidian are found at central sites, despite their distance from the obsidian sources. In order to analyse obsidian distribution, a quantitative approach must be used. There are, however, various methodological problems. Basically, quantifying obsidian distribution is quite simple: the number of obsidian items is usually juxtaposed with the number of flint items. Another simple method, usually applied in the northern Levant near the geological formations of obsidian, is to give the percentage of obsidian out of the entire knapping industry. However, in reality there are various problems in the way the data on obsidian artifacts have been published: 1 When a report on a knapping industry relates only to flint, it is not clear whether obsidian was not discovered at the site, or whether the report is dedicated only to the flint. At Munhata, for example, the flint report (Gopher 1989) gives no hint that 13 obsidian artifacts were also found (Wright and Gordus 1969). 2 In older excavations only a selection of artifacts was collected, kept, and analyzed. While a large part of the flint assemblage was either not collected or discarded, all the obsidian items were kept. In such cases, the ratio of obsidian to flint reported by the excavator is artificially high. 3 Scholars tend to mix together obsidian from excavations and surveys. As obsidian is a rare raw material, it is quite common for excavation reports to give the total number of obsidian items discovered at a site during both excavations and surveys, without differentiating between the two. However, when the flint is published, only the excavated material is included. Again, juxtaposing the number of flint with that of obsidian items will increase the proportion of obsidian. At Kefar Hahoresh, for example, it is stated that "seven pieces of obsidian were recovered from surface contexts and the excavation" (Goring-Morris et al. 1994-5: 114). As the ratio of obsidian to flint at this site is quite low in any case, I utilized the numbers as presented. 4 At sites with several periods of occupation, the amount of obsidian in each layer should be given. However, at 'Ain Ghazal, for example, the material from the 1984 excavation season was published by area rather than by period. As three different phases were discerned in this season, it is not clear how the five obsidian items should be distributed chronologically (Rollefson and Simmons 1985: Table 9). 5 At some sites, while the total number of obsidian items is given, only partial data are presented for the flint. This is the case, for example, in the report on Nahal Lavan 109, where 356 obsidian artifacts were found, one of the largest assemblages from the southern Levant (Burian and Friedman 1988). When the flint was described, only the tools were included and the rest of the knapping industry was disregarded. When we attempt to go a step further and interpret the meaning of the figures obtained from juxtaposing the numbers of flint and obsidian objects, as in Table 36, the situation becomes complicated. We do not have a simple "down the line" trade system in any of the periods and the distribution was apparently carried out through trade between centers. Beyond this rather general statement, can we draw some more specific conclusions about the nature of obsidian distribution in the southern Levant during the eighth millennium BP? Where we have data on obsidian from a multi-layer site, it is clear that the location of the various layers in relation to the obsidian sources has not changed over time. What may have changed are the following two factors: 1 The relative importance of the site in the regional settlement pattern. A site may be a central location in one period but become peripheral in another. It is the relative status of the site in 206</page><page sequence="210">THE OBSIDIAN a given period that determines the amount of obsidian transported into it. 2 Changes over time in the absolute amount of obsidian distributed throughout the Near East. Even without changes in settlement pattern, this will produce changes in quantities of obsidian. 11.3. DISCUSSION Table 36 shows the quantities of obsidian found at various Neolithic sites of the southern Levant. All known assemblages with quantitative date are shown. The assemblages are organized chronologically into five units: PPNA, PPNB, PPNC, PN, and EC (the Early Chalcolithic Wadi Rabah culture). Two of these are relevant to the eighth millennium BP: the PPNC and the PN. Traditionally, the periods following the PPNB have been considered a time of cultural decline (Kenyon 1957; 1960; Perrot 1969; Kirkbride 1971). This approach has recently been summarized in rather dramatic terms: "a major breakdown of the Early Neolithic culture occurred in the southern Levant while prosperity continued in the northern parts of the Near East. The collapse is evident from the disintegration of all major settlements and the erection of small villages. The dominant dwelling form in this period is the circular house; in most cases these were only circular pits that formed the lower part of huts" (Herzog 1997: 27-29). In another recent discussion of the period, Bar-Yosef (1998: 170-171) wrote: "The 'grandeur' of the PPNB days are over. The main economic powers at this time are in the northern Levant, Anatolia, and northern Mesopotamia. Although there was no gap in the population history, the people of the southern Levant definitely became 'marginal' to the powerful social organizations further north." And just recently Simmons (2000: 224) has stated that the decline that begun during the PPNC continued during the PN. However, as can be seen from Table 36, the amount of obsidian found at PPNC sites is considerable. In Tell 'Ali layer II, 17 obsidian artifacts and 8622 flint items were found, a ratio of 1:507. This is a high ratio, even higher than Ashkelon's 1:2628; at many PPNB sites it is lower than 1:15,000. The relatively large number of obsidian artifacts at Tell 'Ali and Ashkelon points to a strong exchange network between the northern and southern Levant. This is certainly not a phenomenon to be expected during a period of major collapse. The PN is characterized by a mosaic of regional cultures: three different pottery traditions, Yarmukian, Jericho IX, and Nizzanim, coexisted (Garfinkel 1999b). In this period hardly any obsidian artifacts are found at most of the sites. The data in Table 36 indicate a ratio of 1 : 1 6,07 1 at Sha'ar Hagolan and 1:2366 at Munhata (only one obsidian item has been reported from each site). The data from Sha'ar Hagolan relate only to the first two seasons (1989-1990). During the excavations carried out in 1996-2000 about ten more items were found, but since the amount of flint is probably also ten times larger, the ratio will not change radically. At Munhata many of the Layer 2b flints were not included in the analysis of the layer (Garfinkel 1993b: 122-123), and thus the ratio should have been much smaller (probably ca. 1:15,000). A similar picture emerges from Ugarit in the northern Levant (de Contenson 1992; Garfinkel 1996). In Layer Vc, contemporary with the PPNB of the southern Levant, the obsidian artifacts constituted ca. 3% of the knapping industry. In Layer Vb, contemporary with the PPNC of the southern Levant, obsidian became more abundant, rising to ca. 8.5%. In Layer Va, contemporary with the PN of the southern Levant, obsidian declined to 4.5%. In Layer IVb, contemporary with the Early Chalcolithic (the Halafian of the northern Levant and Wadi Rabah of the southern Levant), the obsidian level increased once again and reached a peak of ca. 15% of the knapping industry. My explanation for this phenomenon is that there is a positive correlation between obsidian distribution and cultural homogeneity in the Near East. In periods in which there are strong relationships over large areas, there is also cultural similarity in pottery and architecture, and a more active network of obsidian distribution. The sharp decline in obsidian distribution during the second half of the eighth 207</page><page sequence="211">CHAPTER ELEVEN millennium BP coincides with the period in which various regional cultures coexisted in the southern Levant: the Yarmukian, Jericho IX, and Nizzanim (Garfinkel 1999b). During this period the Levant was divided into small territories, each emphasizing its identity through different pottery, flint industry, and artistic traditions. During the first half of the seventh millennium BP, the Near East came under the strong influence of the northern Halafian culture, with various cultural similarities being apparent in pottery, seals, and sling stones. In this period there is once again a higher ratio of obsidian to flint. 208</page><page sequence="212">CHAPTER 12 BONE TOOLS Paula Wapnish Although bone tools are frequently found in Neolithic sites in the Levant, they rarely receive much attention. Systematic presentations of this category of material culture are quite limited (see, for example, Bar-Yosef and Alon 1988; Garfinkel and Horwitz 1988). Within the faunai collection from the excavations conducted in 1997-1998 at Neolithic Ashkelon, 84 bone tools were identified. These may be divided into three broad functional types, with an additional category of varia. Some of the bone tools are too fragmentary to determine their use, but are included here because it is clear that they were deliberately worked. 1. AWLS FROM SHEEP/GOAT LIMB BONES Most of the awls recovered (39 in total) were preserved only as shaft fragments or tips; the scale of these specimens suggests they were fashioned from the bones of medium-sized artiodactyls (Fig. 101; Photos 134-136). However, in a few cases it could be determined that sheep and goat metapodia and tibiae were selected for the implements. All the preserved butts of the awls were fashioned from the distal end of a long bone, with one exception, a proximal metacarpal. Only one specimen, a sheep metatarsal, was made using a complete distal end, retaining both condyles. The rest were split along the length of the shaft so that only one condyle remained per tool. This may have been the norm so that two awls could be made from one bone. The interior spongy bone was pared away and the shaft walls were usually polished along the interior surface; the outside surface was often polished as well. In working the piece, the shaft was tapered from the distal condyle to the pointed tip. 2. TOOLS FROM CATTLE RIBS Cattle (Bos sp.) ribs (21 in total) were worked by first splitting them longitudinally and then removing varying amounts of the spongy material from the interior of the bone (Figs. 102:1-4, 6-8; 103; Photos 137-142). Sometimes the outer surface of the rib was also smoothed and polished. Most worked ribs were recovered as sections, rather than as whole tools, and some of these appear unfinished. There are eight specimens of the spatolate type tool known from many parts of the Old World, where they persisted for millennia. These are usually rounded at one end and pointed at the other and occur in a wide variety of lengths. While many proposals for their use have been made, none seems definitive. They were almost certainly multi- purpose tools whenever and wherever they were made. One worked rib, a short broken fragment, was not longitudinally split but is rounded at one end. It is possible that the rounded end was the product of wear, rather than deliberate modeling. Five rib fragments simply show evidence of working; the interior spongy bone has been reduced and the outer surface cut or smoothed (Figs. 102:4-7; 103; Photos 139-143). Four are covered on one side with numerous cut marks. Two of these specimens are not longitudinally split. One of these is an almost complete rib, including the distal end, which is covered with many fine, light, horizontal cut marks, all of which originate on one side of the rib, some long enough to almost reach the other side. 209</page><page sequence="213">CHAPTER TWELVE Fig. 101.

One short section of rib has five light, evenly spaced horizontal cuts. A small section of a sheep or goat rib bears four evenly spaced grooves perpendicular to the axis of the bone. The two remaining rib sections are deeply notched transverse to the main axis of the bone. None of these cuts present an obvious pattern, but they appear more organized than the horizontal cuts that result from stripping meat from ribs. Because of this, they were likely a form of decoration. Incisions on worked ribs are known from other Neolithic sites like Nahal Hemar Cave (Bar-Yosef and Alon 1988: Figs. 11, 13) and el-Kowm 2 (Stordeur 2000: 273). 3. FLENSER-TYPE TOOL Flenser-type tools (6 in total) were made from dense, thick shaft sections of cattle long bones (Fig. 104: 1-6; Photo 144). They are rounded and blunted at one end from modeling and use and the other end is always broken. Two of the tools are smoothed all over, possibly from use. 4. VARIA Most of the remaining pieces (18 in total) are fragments of worked large mammal (probably cattle) shaft bone. Two fragments were modeled into points. One appears to be more of a "rough and ready" casually shaped tool, but the other is tapered down two sides of the shaft toward the point, and much of the interior spongy bone has been removed. A flake of cattle long bone shaft was worked into a thin rectangular shape and smoothed all over (Fig. 104:8; Photo 145). Five fragments were shaped into flat rectangular sections, one of which was cut and polished on all six surfaces. One was made into an oval rod. Six additional pieces bear evidence of working but no shape is discernible. The distal humerus of a sheep is cut along the border of the Photo 144. Flenser-type tools (photograph B. Boaz). lateral condyle with deep cuts that look patterned: one cut mark is followed proximally on the shaft by three evenly spaced sets of two cuts each. Although the anterior surface of the medial condyle is also cut, the deliberateness of the cuts on the lateral side goes beyond what would be expected from routine dismemberment. A small bone fragment, possibly from a thin section of rib, has been worked on one side into a denticulate edge (Fig. 104:7). The small grooves of denticulation are discernible, but the tops have been rounded from age or wear. This modest collection is restricted in scope and use. The few clues that are present suggest an emphasis on skin working or perhaps meat processing, but not dismemberment. Conspicuous by their absence are implements clearly associated with the procurement of aquatic resources. Photo 145. Polished bone (photograph B.

Nevertheless, one must be aware of the problems involved in this approach, some of which are noted below (see also, e.g., Binford 1981; Schiffer 1985). The objectives of the spatial analysis of the material culture at Ashkelon were as follows: 1 To examine various aspects of flint exploitation activities, from knapping through use and curation until discard. 2 To identify relationships and correlations between artifacts and to reconstruct activities and their location within the site. 3 To improve our understanding of site formation processes by comparing densities of artifacts in different parts of the site. By doing so, we hoped to achieve a better insight into the way in which artifacts accumulated. 13.2. METHODOLOGY The excavations at Ashkelon used a multiple recording system. On the one hand a one-meter- square grid was used and was excavated in spits of several centimeters (usually 10 cm, depending on the context). On the other hand, depositional contexts, which naturally do not coincide with the excavation grid, were defined as loci. The artifacts recovered at Ashkelon were organized in units termed "baskets". In principle the excavation of the baskets followed this twofold system. A basket usually contained all the finds in a spit, unless the spit was subdivided into loci. In the latter case a spit could be excavated in several baskets, in both the horizontal and vertical dimensions. In specific contexts, like topsoil or disturbed areas, excavation was conducted in larger units, usually a 5 X 5 m square. These cases were omitted from the analysis. In the field 5 x 5 m squares were recorded by letters for the west-east direction and numbers for the south-north direction. Thus Square A/1 would be in the southwestern corner, well beyond the excavation border, in accordance with the grid applied to the entire area. The 1 x 1 m squares were recorded graphically in the field and were given numeral coordinates for the sake of this analysis. The southwestern corner of Square A/1 in the grid was designated 0, 0 and the excavation was conducted in Squares 15-35 west-east and 50-105 south-north. Thus, coordinates that contain a letter and a number refer to the 5 x 5 m grid and those containing two numbers refer to the 1 x 1 m grid. Altogether ca. 4500 baskets were recovered, covering an area of about 800 m2 and containing a volume of about 480 m3 (Table 37). The spatial Table 37.

A total of 3355 baskets fulfilled these conditions, comprising a volume of 346 m3. Several methodical dilemmas were tackled during the analytical work. Since we feel that different responses to these dilemmas would have affected the results to some degree, we present the dilemmas and the solutions that led to the results presented here. For each basket the area excavated was calculated from the daily log, at a resolution of 0.1 m2. The volume was calculated by using the upper and lower elevations measured in the field. Both area and volume are sources of inaccuracies, particularly where the borders of loci are curved (creating some error in the area) and where the surface is inclined (creating some error in the elevations). Since baskets were excavated in fairly small volumes, these errors can accumulate to form a significant part of the volume. The smaller the volume of the basket, the larger the potential for error. On the one hand, from an analytical point of view it might be preferable to omit the low-volume baskets to reduce the potential for error. On the other hand, from an archaeological perspective the quality of the context is in inverse proportion to the size of the unit excavated. In other words, archaeological contexts with better resolution (floors, installations, etc.) are excavated in small units that create a methodological problem. Omitting these units would solve the problem but exclude the best-quality data, hence throwing out the baby with the bathwater. The second dilemma relates to the scale of the unit used for the analysis. The smallest possible unit is the smallest excavated unit, i.e., the basket. Larger units (e.g., locus, square, layer) could serve as well. The choice of scale amplifies or blurs spatial phenomena: small-scale features are emphasized by small-scale analysis and blurred by larger scales. On the other hand, large-scale features are blurred by small-scale analysis. For example, a small concentration of perforators was excavated in Loc. 392. It included 57 perforators, 47 of which were concentrated in about a quarter of a one- meter square and the rest scattered in an adjacent area of about 5 m2. Moreover, the 47 concentrated perforators were excavated in two baskets, one of them (6189) containing most of the items (43) and the other only four. When we calculate the density of the perforators (the numbers are items per m3), the results change dramatically with the scale. If only the actual concentration is calculated the density is well over 3000, for basket 6 1 89 it is 733, for the relevant ten-centimeter spit in the square it is 440, for the locus it is 185, and for the square 107. In this case, the smaller the unit used, the higher the contrast between the concentration of perforators and the background. Other cases behave differently. Some clustering is evident only with the accumulation of larger units. This is especially true when the sample size is small, as it is for some tool types. The dilemma lies in the desire to analyze the finds on the right scale. This scale should ideally be the one that correlates best with the way in which activities were organized in the past. Unfortunately, there is no one such scale, since different activities were executed on various scales. For example, caching tools or raw material for further use requires only a small area (10-20 cm would be sufficient), dumping waste can be done in larger areas, flint knapping creates an activity area of several square meters, residual space encompasses a larger area. The third dilemma relates to the problem of data use. Two basic data sets were considered: the first is absolute artifact counts and the second is artifact densities (i.e., numbers of artifacts per m3). Each has its own advantages and drawbacks. Absolute counts are affected by the depth of the layer's accumulation (the thicker the layer, the higher the expected artifact count). At Ashkelon, the layer's depth varies by 500% or more. Even if only a thin sub-layer is considered, for example the ten centimeters immediately above the kurkar, the arbitrary nature of the excavation units creates great variability in depth. While it is clear that depth 218</page><page sequence="221">SPATIAL ANALYSIS Fig. 105. Flint density as a function of elevation above virgin soil. must be controlled, the use of densities creates other problems. The dilemma lies in the fact that some (but not all) depositional processes are independent of artifact accumulation processes. In most cases people use a surface rather than a volume. The artifacts scattered during the activity cover an area and do not fill a depositional unit (unless they are discarded in pits). The optimal spit should be of the thickness of the items, allowing some freedom to account for post-depositional disturbance. A thicker spit will reduce the density, while counts will retain it. A mud-brick wall collapsing on a floor will form a sterile area above a very thin, dense layer; likewise, material carried downslope will create a different pattern from material in situ. Another more fundamental problem is that prehistoric people worked with tools counted and not with tools per m3. Any activity required a certain number of tools, regardless of the amount of sediment deposited during and/or after the activity. Numbers of artifacts may not correlate with the amount of sediment deposited by the activity. The fourth dilemma relates to the method of analysis. Again, two options were considered. The first is the use of visual criteria, producing density maps and interpreting them according to the observed clustering of denser areas. The second is the use of analytical tools, testing statistically the differences between various areas of the site. Naturally, both encompass diverse methods and models. The first is simple, clear and based on common sense; the second is more accurate, and the results are probably more reliable but less readable. The limitations of resources (time, money, and publishing space) dictated a single approach rather than the exhaustion of all possibilities. The results presented here are based on a compromise. Based on the stratigraphie interpretation, two living surfaces were identified as representing the best archaeological data: the virgin soil (the lower part of Layer IVb) and the floor adjacent to Wall 100 (the upper part of Layer IVa). The fill between them, though partly the result of natural processes, contains evidence of human activity, demonstrated by the higher density of flint artifacts associated with these phases (Fig. 105). These two units were analyzed in detail, while other parts of the site were analyzed only very generally. The depth of layer chosen is ca. 20 cm, based on the thickness of the densest layer and the fact that some of the built installations are about as thick. In most squares a layer of 15-25 cm was isolated despite the uneven spits, presence of pits, and sloping virgin soil. Given a more or less homogeneous layer, the use of absolute numbers of artifacts was preferred. Actual counts carry meaning: one arrowhead is one arrowhead, while five arrowheads per m3 is less informative. Results were considered only if they relied mostly on homogeneous spits, although shallower or deeper spits were accepted in support of conclusions. The eastern part of the site (strips D and E) was omitted from the analysis since the great differences in layer thickness did not fit the chosen methodology. The presentation is mostly graphic, though some geostatistical factors were considered. 219</page><page sequence="222">CHAPTER THIRTEEN Fig. 106. Plan of lower Layer IVb. 220</page><page sequence="223">SPATIAL ANALYSIS Fig. 107. Sediment volumes in the analyzed area, lower Layer IVb (lighter cells have lower volumes while darker cells have high volumes). 13.3. RESULTS The analyzed lower part of Layer IVb encompasses about 4502 in area in a strip 55 m long and about 10 m wide. The volume analyzed is 86.73. This is about 18% of the sediments (Table 37) but comprises a greater proportion of the artifacts due to greater densities (e.g., almost 25% of the tools). The features associated with it are presented in Fig. 106 and the volumes in each unit in Fig. 107. Notably, features correlate with larger volumes, since many are dug into the kurkar. The lower 20 cm and associated pits and hearths were analyzed. The assemblage includes 6299 waste items. Fig. 108 shows the distribution of the flint items in this area. Hints were found in various quantities over the entire area (830 of the 890 baskets contained some flint items). Very few square meters yielded no flint at all and the densest square (32, 52) contained 284 waste items. The flints are clearly denser in parts of the area. The densest concentrations of flints are found in Squares G/11, F/12, F/18, G/18, F/19, and F/20. In order to check the methodology, the flint was plotted by volume; the results are presented in Fig. 109. While they differ in minor detail, there is a great similarity between the two plots, confirming the validity of the choice. The assemblage was separated into its constituents (chips, chunks, flakes, blades, bladelets, and primary elements), and each was plotted separately. The results for each category were essentially identical; the same clusters were evident and no other clusters were found. 1. PROXIMITY TO HEARTHS In many sites, the focal point of activities, including flint knapping, was the hearth. This is true for many small Paleolithic sites in which a single hearth was found, with concentrations of knapped flint items around it. It is also true for Neolithic sites, where hearths often remained the focal points of daily life. A picture of this kind emerged at PN Ziqim, where one of the hearths and an adjacent pit were accompanied by high densities of flint waste, and by higher proportions of burnt flint items (Garfinkel et al. 2002). Consequently, the potential association 221</page><page sequence="224">CHAPTER THIRTEEN Fig. 108. Waste item count distribution in lower Layer IVb. Fig. 109. Waste item density distribution in lower Layer IVb (artifacts per m3). 222</page><page sequence="225">SPATIAL ANALYSIS between waste items and hearth distribution at Ashkelon was examined. Fig. 106 above presents the location of hearths in the analyzed area. Hearths were found in five main clusters, in Squares F/21, G/18-19, G/17, F-G/13-14, and G/ll-12. Very few hearths were found outside these clusters. Clearly, there is a negative correlation between the densities of hearths and flints. Single hearths (as opposed to clusters) do appear in dense flint areas, usually as part of an exceptional context. Examples are Loc. 252 in Square F/18 (a hearth found in close proximity to a burial) and hearths found inside dwelling pits. This pattern has important implications for the interpretation of the occupation. Two main points should be stressed: 1 Regarding the nature of the occupation, two extreme possibilities should be considered: that Layer IVb, including all features and related occupational debris, represents a single occupation or that it represents an agglomeration of small-scale occupations, each with its own features and related artifacts. In the latter case, a repetitive pattern of hearths with artifacts around them is expected and there will be some overlap between the occupations. However, the observed overall separation of flints and hearths implies that this is not the case. The entire slope is divided into different activity areas, with some relationships between them. While we cannot rule out the possibility that some of the features belong to separate occupations, it is plausible that most belong to a single event, or perhaps very few events. The numerous hearths are not the result of repetitive visits to the same locality by small nomadic pastoral groups, but must result from activity on a larger scale. 2 The function of the hearth is illuminated by the separation of the hearths from the clusters of flint objects. As noted above, the typical small hunter-gatherer site has a single hearth, which is the focal point of activity. Around it most activities are conducted (indeed, in Hebrew the same word, moqed, is used for "hearth" and "focal point"). The hearth supplies functional needs like heat and light, but also serves as a social meeting place, attracting activities like flint knapping that are not directly related to fire. At Ashkelon, this pattern does not exist. Most of the hearths do not serve as focal points for activities and flint knapping, at least, is carried out elsewhere. Thus the hearth should be regarded from a narrower functional viewpoint: the hearth is no longer a generalized feature but a specialized, craft-specific tool. Altogether, 16.8% of the flint was burnt. The distribution of the burnt flint items was examined and, as expected, the areas with more hearths tend to have higher proportions of burnt items, up to 100% of the material. Thus, the distribution of burnt flints correlates with hearths rather than with the densest clusters of flint. This accords well with accidental burning of flint items. 2. FLINT KNAPPING One of the goals of the analysis was to identify areas of flint knapping, curation, and discard. In order to do this, some components of the flint assemblage were studied. These include such technologically distinct items as cores, CTEs, and percussors. On a sloping surface, knapping is much more comfortably done while facing downslope. The concentrations of waste will be scattered below the knapper (to the east in the case of Ashkelon). Items, especially round ones like cores, percussors, or chunks, may roll downslope. Six percussors were found. They comprised two pairs, each found less than a meter apart, and two separate items. One pair was found in Squares 32, 53 and 33, 53, with a third percussor close by in Square 3 1 , 56. The other pair was found in Squares 33, 88 and 32, 89. The last percussor was found in Square 29, 97. They were all found either within the densest flint concentrations or directly downslope from them. Fifty cores and 142 CTEs were found. The distribution of cores and CTEs is presented in Figs. 110 and 111. Fig. 112 presents the distribution of cores, CTEs, primary elements, and chips together. Evidently, the technological components that are indicators of knapping are distributed in the same general spatial patterns as the rest of the assemblage. The areas with the densest flint concentrations are 223</page><page sequence="226">CHAPTER THIRTEEN Fig. 110. Location of cores in lower Layer IVb. Fig. 111. Location of CTEs in lower Layer IVb. 224</page><page sequence="227">SPATIAL ANALYSIS Fig. 112. Location of cores, CTEs, primary elements, and chips in lower Layer IVb. the locations where flint was knapped. We should consider the possibility of these areas being merely discard areas for the disposal of flint. However, in such a case, flint must have been knapped over a portable surface like a leather blanket, and tighter scatters would be expected. The fact that the denser spots cover large areas and contain many small artifacts indicates that these are primary knapping areas. Three very dense localities were detected, one in Squares 31-33, 52-57 (including three percussors), the second in Squares 28-30, 61-63, and the third in Squares 25-28, 83-88 (including a pair of percussors). The first two are small enough to represent a single event and the third is probably more complex. 3. THE TOOLS In total, 559 Neolithic tools (and 75 Epi-Paleolithic microliths) were analyzed. The tool distribution is presented in Fig. 113. In general the distribution of the tools follows the same trends as the distribution of the waste. Areas richer in flints will also contain larger quantities of tools. The two densest localities were in Squares 31-33, 52-56 and Squares 25-29, 85-91. These two localities correlate very well with the densest localities of flint overall, while the third locality of flint knapping in Squares 28-30, 61-63 did not contain an exceptional concentration of tools. Thus tool discard (and use?) spatially overlaps flint knapping in some, but not all, cases. Several localities contained a large amount of tools in a single spot, not within the densest concentrations. Squares 27, 66 contained two scrapers, two retouched items, a sickle blade, and a notch. In close proximity is Square 29, 67, which yielded five tools, including two denticulates, a notch, an arrowhead, and a perforator. In Square 26, 72, six tools were found, including two perforators, two retouched items, and two denticulates. Square" 26, 75 contained six tools, including two sickle blades, a retouched item, a scraper, and a pièce esquillée. In Square 32, 77, nine tools were found, including seven perforators, one retouched item, and one backed and truncated blade. Square 34, 79 yielded eight tools, all perforators. The densest square (32, 52) contained 52 tools, 45 of which 225</page><page sequence="228">CHAPTER THIRTEEN Fig. 113. Location of tools in lower Layer Ivb. are perforators. Perforators thus clearly tend to be grouped together. This is true for other types as well but to a lesser degree; even in the small sample mentioned here there are several pairs of tools in the same locality. Some tool types (arrowheads, sickle blades, and probably also bifaces) were obviously not discarded at their use location. These were all hafted and their maintenance included occasional rehafting; thus these items probably represent stocks stored for future use or discarded worn-out items. The most striking example is the sickle blades. In this category the vast majority are used items, as is evident from the gloss; thus the pattern is that of discard rather than caching items in a stockpile. The distribution of the curated tools is similar to that of other tools and the waste as well. Thus it is probable that flint knapping, curation, use, and discard were performed in the same general areas. Arrowheads: 14 arrowheads were found, distributed over the entire area; a concentration of five was found in Squares 31-33, 52-55. Sickle blades: 56 sickle blades were found; one group of 13 items was found in Squares 30-33, 51-61 and another group of 26 tools was found in Squares 26-31, 82-93. Knives: 10 knives were found, two of them in the southern concentration in Squares 33-33, 52-56, and six in the northern concentration in Squares 25-29, 85-91. Bifaces: three bifaces were found. One of them, a polished axe was found in Loc. 227 (Square 26, 100). This is outside the area of denser flints and in a special context, within a complex of built hearths. Perforators: 108 tools were found. They are distributed in a very different way from other tools. There are several localities in which several perforators were found together; the most impressive example is the 45 perforators found in Square 32, 52, but other groups were found as well (Fig. 114). In the northern concentration of tools, only eight perforators were found, about 7.5% of the perforators compared to 20% of the entire tool assemblage. Pièces esquillées : 52 tools were found, distributed in very close accord with the entire 226</page><page sequence="229">SPATIAL ANALYSIS Fig. 1 14. Distribution of perforators. assemblage; two main concentrations of tools were uncovered, while outside these areas only a single tool was found. Retouched items: 204 tools were found. Two denser spots are evident, but retouched items are also scattered in significant numbers over most of the area that is rich in flints; about half of the retouched items were found outside the denser areas. Scrapers: 26 tools were found, distributed evenly in the flint-rich areas. Notches and denticulates: 46 tools were found. A group of eight tools were found in the southern concentration, in the northern concentration they are sparse, an additional group of five tools was found in Squares 29-30, 67-69. The correlations between several types were studied* and the results are presented in Table 38. While there is some positive correlation between all the types examined (high densities of one type tend to correlate with high densities of others), in most cases only a weak connection was found. The strongest correlations are between sickle blades and pièces esquillées (0.54), knives and sickle blades (0.44), knives and scrapes (0.42), and arrowheads and perforators (0.42). Notches and denticulates have the lowest correlations with other types. In addition, perforators (except for the perforator-arrowhead correlation) and pièces esquillées have a very low correlation with other types. 4. SPECIFIC LOCALITIES A. Squares 30-33, 52-56 The densest concentration of flints was found in this locality. Despite its small area (16 m2), its finds include 125 primary elements, 214 flakes, 24 blades, 29 bladelets, 210 chips, 19 CTEs, seven cores, and 121 tools. Among the latter, * The correlation was checked by r coefficient. The range of r is -lsrsl. r=l when high values correlate with high values, r=0 when there is no correlation and r=-l when high values correlate with low values. 227</page><page sequence="230">CHAPTER THIRTEEN Table 38.

Other types are found in smaller concentrations (10-15% of the assemblage). Also found were three percussors, one stone bowl, 125 fish bones (about 45% of the assemblage), but no turtle bones. The abundant finds are scattered around a large hearth (Loc. 400), one of the very few parts of the site in which flints are scattered around a hearth. The hearth itself was almost sterile, containing three waste items, no tools at all and none of the fish bones that are plentiful around the hearth. The densest square within this area is 32, 52: in addition to 45 perforators, this square also yielded 284 waste items (half of them chips) and many other small flakes or primary elements. The locality is characterized by very high quantities of burnt items (230 of the waste items and 36 of the tools). Notably, the raw materials of the tools and waste in this square are fairly homogeneous, consisting almost exclusively of Mishash Formation flint. Do these finds represent the spill from cleaning the hearth? And if so, why are there so many perforators, many of them burnt? Around the hearth, fish bones are concentrated in the northeast, two percussors in the southeast and one in the northwest together with the stone bowl, cores in the west, CTEs in the west and south, and waste in the west and in Square 32, 52 in the south. The area south of the hearth is also where most of the tools were found: arrowheads in the southeast, sickles in the east, perforators in the south and northwest, the two knives in the west, and notches in the east. Retouched items are scattered all around the hearth. The high density of finds around Loc. 400 may be interpreted as resulting from several specific activities. The cache of Square 32, 52 appears to be the result of a single knapping event oriented towards the production of small flakes, later used as blanks for perforators. The orientation towards the west of the distribution of waste, especially that of cores and CTEs, may indicate that most of the knapping was done west of Loc. 400. The suitable blanks were then transferred to the south side of the hearth, where some of them were transformed into tools. To the north and northeast of the hearth was an area of different activity that has left many fish bones and several tools, including five arrowheads and two tabular knives. If, as seems likely, intensive consumption of fish took place in this locality, the arrowheads may have played a role in fishing. The fish found at the site are mostly small in size, caught in shallow water (Chapter 17). If this is the case, it is not unlikely that fish were speared rather than being caught with rods or nets and were brought to the site still speared, creating an association between discard of arrowheads and fish bones. B. Dwelling pit 263 and its vicinity Loc. 263 lies in Squares 28-31, 58-61 and was interpreted as a dwelling pit, partly because of Hearth 386 found at its base. Inside the pit itself 45 waste items, two cores, and eight tools were found. Although this is not a particularly high density of finds, the variety of tools is impressive: 228</page><page sequence="231">SPATIAL ANALYSIS they include one sickle blade, one arrowhead, one notch, one pièce esquillée , one pounded flake, and two retouched items. A concentration of waste items was found adjacent to the pit on the northwest (Squares 28-29, 62). The 151 items included many flakes, chips and primary elements, four CTEs, and six tools (two scrapers, two perforators, one pièce esquillée , and one retouched item). Most of the identifiable pieces are made of flint of the Mishash Formation. As in Square 32, 52, a single knapping event apparently took place in this spot, just outside the dwelling pit. Two unusual stone tools, a shaft straightener and a flat slab of schist, were also found in the vicinity of the pit. Very low frequencies of waste were found downslope from the pit. The variety of tools indicates that the pit was the locus of diverse activities, though none of them was conducted in a very intensive manner. Flint knapping was obviously done outside the pit, to the north. Hardly any fish bones were found in or around the pit and there was apparently no sweeping or cleaning of the pit down the slope. The interpretation of the pit as a dwelling pit seems plausible: it does not seem to have been a focal point of activities involving flint and/or refuse disposal, for reasons of hygiene or simply convenience. C. Pit 258 and its vicinity This is a large oval pit in Squares 26-28, 72-74. Inside the pit were a large quantity (about 100) of waste items, one CTE, and eight tools (four retouched items, three perforators, and one sickle blade). Compared to Loc. 263, this is a more restricted repertoire associated with twice as much waste. Around the pit, the southeastern side is poor in flint items, while the northern area is richer. One handstone was found in the southeastern part of the pit's interior. No turtle bones and only a single fish bone were found. Locus 258 is interpreted as a dwelling pit because of its size and because it contained a hearth at its base. However, it is very different from Locus 263 (see above), being half as large in area but much deeper. The hearth is much less distinct and the pit has an attached pit containing many animal bones. Moreover, the repertoire of flint tools is more restricted and associated with more waste. Loc. 258 was apparently used in a more restricted manner than Loc. 263, perhaps as a sheltered area used for specific functions rather than the full repertoire of actual dwelling. Three features are defined as dwelling pits: Loc. 245 (Squares E-F/16, not discussed because it is partially outside the analyzed area), Loc. 258 (Square F/15), and Loc. 263 (Squares F-G/12-13). In all three loci a relatively low density of flints was found. They are located at the margins of the densest areas but not inside them. Flint manufacture and use was apparently an outdoor activity. D. The northern concentration of hearths (Squares F-G/20-21) In this area of the site there was a dense concentration of hearths, most built of stones inside pits whose border was baked by fire to a red color. Since the area as a whole is characterized by very low densities of flint items, this is apparently not a flint knapping area. Additionally, no stone tools or fish or turtle bones were found in this area. Eighteen flint tools were found in the vicinity of the hearths: nine retouched items, three pièces esquillées , one sickle blade, one arrowhead, one polished axe, one perforator, and two multiple tools (retouched and denticulated). The repertoire of tools does not help us to identify the use of this area. While the hearths point a special activity, the sole evidence is negative in nature: flint was not knapped in this area, groundstones were not used, and nor were flint tools used intensively. E. The wall and its adjacent area (Layer IVa) Wall 100 is the only wall uncovered at the site. It is built of two faces of kurkar fieldstones and probably had a mud brick superstructure. The wall runs in a straight line from northwest to southeast. Although a floor surface (Loc. 364) was unearthed in a very restricted area, the whole configuration is not typical of a domestic building. Rather, Wall 100 appears to be a wall separating different areas of the site, which in that particular phase was a more or less open area. The analysis included a strip about 3-5 m wide on both sides 229</page><page sequence="232">CHAPTER THIRTEEN of the wall and aimed to discover whether there are any significant differences between the spaces defined by the wall. Since hardly any associated surfaces were preserved, all baskets from the top of the wall to its base were considered (this in some cases proved problematic due to the wall's state of preservation). Altogether, 253 baskets were analyzed from the wall area, containing 36.7 m3 of sediment (7.6%). While absolute numbers of artifacts were high due to greater densities, surprisingly low numbers of cores and CTEs were found (about 3%). The flint items, tools, and waste were distributed more or less evenly both north and south of the wall and along the entire length. If this was a dividing wall, it probably separated two equal units of more or less identical function. The amount of artifacts (individual types of flint tools, ground stone tools, etc.) is too small for meaningful results. Interestingly, however, six of the 14 obsidian items found at the site were related to the wall (see below). 5. OBSIDIAN Fourteen obsidian pieces were found, one of which was found in a balk and the rest in the Neolithic layers. The obsidian is largely concentrated in one part of the site, both vertically and horizontally; only one item was found in the southern part of the excavated area. Of the 14 pieces, 1 1 were found in Layer IVa, three in Layer IVb, and none in Layer īve. The items found in Layer IVb are from the upper part of the layer; in other words, no obsidian was associated with the hearths phase. All the obsidian found is later, contemporary either with the "floating" poorly defined occupations consisting of the upper part of Layer IVb and the lower part of Layer IVa, or with the upper Layer IVa phase of Wall 100. Spatially, a significant part of the obsidian was concentrated near the wall and the adjacent surfaces (Fig. 115); only two pieces were found more than five meters from the wall. One piece was found immediately above Floor 364, and five other pieces were found at elevations appropriate to association with the wall (the other four pieces are lower than the wall). It is no coincidence that the only architectural remnant in the site is associated Fig. 115. Distribution of obsidian items. 230</page><page sequence="233">SPATIAL ANALYSIS with a large number of obsidian pieces. This phase is apparently associated with a more permanent settlement, enjoying long-distance connections. The lower industrial area is more self-contained and task-specific, and apparently had only short- distance connections. 6. SHELLS As only a sample of the shells was counted, the discussion here relates to two aspects: 1) the deposition of the shells as reflected by the distribution of baskets containing shells and 2) the distribution of imported and worked shells. It is noted by Bar-Yosef Mayer (Chapter 18) that many of the shells found in the site are worn fragments, indicating that most were deposited by a natural agent. Shells are found in ca. 60% of the baskets originating in the modern sand dune. This is probably not limited to modern times, since baskets containing shells are distributed in all of the depositional units. There is a negative correlation between the amount of human activity and the amount of shells found. For example, the hearth phase at the bottom of Layer IVb is very poor in shells, which occur in only 24% of the baskets, while in Layer IVc, the deepest part of the site, a higher proportion of baskets (ca. 30%) contains shells. When compared to baskets containing clearly intrusive late pottery, two very distinct patterns are seen. Amounts of pottery decline very rapidly with depth. It was found in ca. 75% of the modern dune baskets, in less than 25% of Layer I Va baskets (most in the upper part), and declines rapidly in the Neolithic layer down to 0.6% of the baskets in Layer IVc (two baskets containing a very small sherd each). Shells, on the other hand, are distributed much more evenly across the section; although some decline in frequency is evident, this is much less steep than that of the pottery. In the lowermost portion of the site, ca. 30% of the baskets contain shells. These cannot be intrusive from the modern layer, since the same layer contains only negligible amounts of intrusive finds. A second indication of the Neolithic date of the shells' deposition is the occurrence of some burnt shells. At the same time, however, there is some correlation between high densities of flint items and low densities of shells. In conclusion, shells were probably deposited naturally during the Neolithic occupation. It has already been noted (Chapter 5) that the sediments contain a large component of sand, and it appears that most of the shells were deposited by natural agents. The shells are more abundant in the parts of the section in which human activities are less evident: the more dominant the component of anthropogenic sediment, the smaller the amount of shells. There are a few exceptions to the above observations. Obviously, the fact that shells were naturally deposited does not rule out their collection, modification, and use by humans. The problem is how to separate the natural component from the modified one. Three groups of shells were defined as being associated with human activity. The first is imported Red Sea shells. The second consists of shells that were modified by drilling, cutting, or engraving. The third consists of shells with a special association, for example a group of naturally pierced shells found together inside one of the Chalcolithic pits. The modified shells were found in three areas of the site. Three shells (two from the same square) were found in close proximity to Wall 100, less than five meters from it and in the same elevation range. Two shells were found about five meters apart in the northwestern part of the site, where the layer was very thin. An additional shell was found in the upper part of the section in the southern part of the site. 7. HUMAN SKELETAL REMAINS Identifiable human remains were found in a number of places (Fig. 116): 1. Pit 253 is a shallow feature, ca. 2 m. long and 1 m wide, dug into the kurkar and containing the remains of five individuals (H1-H5; see Chapter 14). One of them (HI) seems to be a distorted primary burial, and there are fragments of four other secondary burials. Many of the bones from this pit were burnt. 231</page><page sequence="234">CHAPTER THIRTEEN Fig. 116. Distribution of human skeletal remains. 232</page><page sequence="235">SPATIAL ANALYSIS 2. Pit 402 contained fragmentary remains of two individuals (H6-H7). In addition, this pit contained a significant number of stone tools, broken stone bracelets, animal bones and flint items. The composition of the sediment in the pit suggests that it was used for waste disposal. 3 Hearth 382 is a fine construction of stones laid inside a pit. Inside it a human mandible was found. 4 Some 70 isolated bones were found in the site. When the various remains are combined on a distribution map, it is clear that they are all concentrated in a rather small area of the site, in Squares F-G/18-19. All but one are clearly secondary burials, and the single possibly primary burial (HI) is badly disturbed. Furthermore, the human bones are sometimes scattered, accidentally burnt after burial, deposited in hearths, or even in waste disposal pits. This probably indicates some lack of knowledge as to the whereabouts of human bones once they were buried. Apparently, there was a general area for burials but the exact location of each burial was not obvious, resulting in repeated disturbance of old burials. 8. EPI-PALEOLITHIC MICROLITHS The last aspect to be examined here is the distribution of the Epi-Paleolithic microlith component unearthed at Neolithic Ashkelon. From a typological point of view the microliths are clearly an intrusive element, as they are completely absent at PPNB and PPNC sites. Appendix C, at the end of this volume, is dedicated to the Epi-Paleolithic microliths. Nevertheless, the spatial distribution of the microliths is examined here in order to compare them with the spatial distribution of the Neolithic flint. The distribution of the microliths differs from that of any of the other tools (Fig. 1 17). The southern concentration is not evident at all and the northern denser area is not pronounced, while other areas of the site that are very poor in other types are richer in microliths. It is worth noting that their distribution is sparse overall. Their correlations with other tool types are the lowest found and they are the only type to have a negative correlation with other types Fig. 117. Distribution of Epi-Paleolithic microliths. 233</page><page sequence="236">CHAPTER THIRTEEN (high values of microliths correlate with low values of perforators). The above indicates that, at least to some extent, microlith distribution is different from the distributions of other types, attesting to a different mechanism of deposition. 13.4. DISCUSSION To sum up this chapter, two points will be discussed further. One major conclusion that emerges from the spatial analysis is that the complexity of functions within the site is best manifested on a large scale. The differences between areas in the site are more pronounced for areas of 50-100 m2 than for smaller areas of a few square meters. In this respect we should note the marked difference between the area excavated by Perrot (Perrot and Gopher 1996) and that excavated by Garfinkel and published here. While the two present a more or less identical material culture, they are very diverse in their spatial organization. The former included many dwelling and storage pits (Fig. 4) but hardly any hearths, while the latter, over a larger area, included very few such pits and a plenitude of hearths. Only through combination of the two excavations can the true complexity of the site be exposed. The site of Ashkelon was evidently divided into at least two sub-areas, one of them serving for households while the other served a more "industrial" purpose. Within the area presented here there are also marked differences between areas with a high density of hearths and low densities of flint artifacts, and on the other hand areas with almost no hearths but with larger amounts of artifacts. Another large-scale phenomenon is the separation of two, apparently similar, open spaces by Wall 100. Thus four dissimilar areas are found: a dwelling area, an area with dense hearths, an area with clusters of flint knapping and use waste, and open areas. At least some contemporaneity between the areas is evident, indicating a large-scale division of space. This large-scale division is very meaningful for the understanding of the social organization of the site's occupants. Clearly, there are two levels of space classification. The basic level is the household level, in which each household has a defined space, presumably the dwelling space and its immediate vicinity. Within this area decisions about the division of space are private, and the areas destined for sleeping, cooking, etc. are allocated according to the household's need. On a more complex level, there is a separation between the area dedicated for dwelling and that used for other activities. This separation is not performed by a single household; the decision is respected by all the occupants of the site and can be considered a public decision. A twofold system of space categories, the private/household space and the public space, is formed. The division of space between the private and the public realms becomes possible only when there is a repetitive use of the same places and is facilitated by the establishment of a sedentary way of life. The existence of a realm of public decision- making and a public space raises the question of the division of labor and property. How was labor divided in the public space? Was the product of this labor public or private? Communal efforts are by no mean unknown in earlier periods (the best example is the tower at PPNA Jericho). However, at Ashkelon the issue is not a single event of communal labor for the realization of a large project, but the creation of a public space for more or less prosaic daily activities. These were probably performed by many members of the community for their own benefit, and thus the product of these activities remained private rather than public. The second issue is the way in which the interpretation of features depends on the distribution of artifacts around them. To demonstrate this point, let us consider the function of the hearth. Many features in the site were labeled "hearth". However, the spatial analysis of the artifacts revealed considerable differences between them, as is evident from the following examples. Loc. 229 is a large hearth that is part of the northern concentration of hearths. Since the hearths in this concentration were associated with low amounts of flint items, it was concluded that they served as task-specific features exploiting fire as the sole contribution of the hearths. Loc. 400 is a large 234</page><page sequence="237">SPATIAL ANALYSIS hearth in the southern part of the excavated area. Around it were found a group of perforators, a flint knapping area, and large amounts of fish bones. Here it appears that the hearth itself was not used as a tool, but rather was a focal point around which other activities were performed. A third example is Loc. 386, found inside a dwelling pit. Here the hearth is a part of the standard household equipment; it could have served for cooking or heating, but its location on the margin of the dwelling pit precludes it from being the center of activity within the household. These are three examples of features given the same label, but probably fulfilling different functions. "Hearth" is no longer an adequate label; if in Paleolithic times most hearths functioned in a more or less identical manner, in Neolithic sites, which are more complex, this is no longer true. A more nuanced classification of features is needed to represent this greater complexity. Contextual comparison enables us to make a finer distinction between otherwise similar features. At Ashkelon such a comparison yielded a distinction between hearths that were part of a household complex, hearths around which other activities were performed, and task-specific "industrial" hearths. 235</page><page sequence="238">CHAPTER 14 ANTHROPOLOGICAL AND TAPHONOMIC ANALYSES OF SKELETAL REMAINS Marina Faerman and Patricia Smith 14.1. INTRODUCTION This chapter describes human skeletal remains recovered from the Neolithic site of Ashkelon during the excavations in 1997-1998. Human remains recovered from the site included a disturbed primary burial and other human remains in secondary context, as well as numerous isolated bones and teeth scattered around the excavated area. Anthropological analyses carried out at the Laboratory of Bio- Anthropology of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem included age and sex identification and examination of morphometry and pathology (Krogman 1962; Bass 1971; Katzenberg and Saunders 2000). In addition, age in juveniles was independently determined from dental development (Liversidge et al. 1998) and used to estimate attrition rates in adults after Miles (1963) as an additional guide to age estimation. Many of the bones had been exposed to fire and varied in color from black to light gray. Most of them were in poor condition and crumbled when touched. Nevertheless, we were able to estimate the minimal number of individuals based on the most frequently found bone: the mandible and/or its fragments. Those for whom age and/or sex could be determined were given H {Homo) numbers and are described in detail below. Altogether seven individuals were identified (one child, one juvenile, two adolescents and three adults). Sex estimation was possible in five of them, two females and three males, including a 10-11-year-old juvenile male and a 13-15-year-old adolescent female. Age and sex distribution of the individuals is given in Table 39. Additional isolated bones and teeth were recovered from disturbed contexts and could not be attributed to a specific burial. Most of these were too fragmentary to provide informative data on sex, age, or disease patterns. These findings are listed separately in Table 40 following the description of the burials. A careful examination of the additional findings allowed us to suggest that there might be two additional juveniles, one aged 8-10 years and the other aged 11-12 years. Altogether, data obtained from the analyses of the isolated findings were in agreement with those derived from the burials. A similar poor preservation of human skeletal remains was reported from the earlier excavation at Neolithic Ashkelon (F. Le Morte in Perrot and Table 39.

They described the presence of a few bones in Locus 1 and identified three individuals: a child (a mandible fragment), an adolescent about 15 years old (an incomplete mandible) and an adult (first metatarsal, epiphyses of two long bones). Other fragments found may belong to an adolescent or adult. They included cranial fragments, epiphyses of femur, tibia, humerus, fibula. No morphological study was performed due to the poor condition of the bones. 14.2. THE HUMAN SKELETAL REMAINS LOCUS 253 Skeletal remains of at least five individuals were recovered from this locus: a 2-3-year-old child, a 15-year-old adolescent, a 20-25 -year-old male, a 25-30-year-old female and another adult male of undetermined age. HI: This is a burial of a young adult male, oriented west-east with the skull in the west, 240</page><page sequence="242">ANTHROPOLOGICAL AND TAPHONOMIC ANALYSES OF SKELETAL REMAINS Photo 146. The skull of the young male adult (HI) in situ. facing southwest and lying on his right side in a pit (Photo 146). Since the skull was deformed postmortem by the wet, heavy sand, measurements are approximations. Nevertheless, the skull can be described as long and narrow and belongs to a dolichocranic type with a maximal cranial length of about 1 88 mm (Photo 147). Other measurements included upper face height at ~70 mm, frontal and parietal arches both at 1 35 mm, frontal and parietal chords at ~113 and ~124 mm, respectively, and right orbital height and width at 29 and 34 mm, respectively. The naso-maxillary area was partly broken but all the maxillary teeth were recovered. The right and left mandibular body fragments including a small portion of the symphysis and a part of the ascending rami were also found (Photo 148A, B). The right PM2-M3 teeth were present in the mandible and showed little attrition. Dental age was estimated at 20-25 years. Signs of periodontal disease were noticed in the PM2-M2 area (Photo 148A), an unusual finding in such a young individual. The left part of the mandibular body, corresponding to the PM2-M3 area, was partly burnt, with all the teeth burnt and broken. Roentgenographic examination of the mandible showed that the permanent right 1st molar roots were shorter than those of the 2nd molar (Photo 148B) and that the left mandibular 3rd molar was congenitally absent (Photo 148C).

Faerman. central incisor and the lower right canine were also recovered. The latter showed severe hypoplasia. All the teeth from the canine to the 3rd molar were present in the right maxilla and showed little attrition. Both upper left incisors, the upper left canine and the upper left 1st and 2nd premolars were also recovered. The left lateral incisor showed semi-shoveling, while the right lateral incisor was markedly shoveled. Carabelli's cusp was observed on the upper right 1 st and the upper left 3rd molars. Hypoplasia was seen on the upper left canine and the upper left 1st premolar. H2: A burnt mandibular body fragment (right) containing broken 1st and 2nd permanent molars (roots only); part of the crypt of the 3rd permanent molar was recovered. Dental age was estimated at ~15 years. H3: The left portion of the mandibular body containing the 2nd premolar and the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd molars of an adult was found (Photo 149A). The mandible was very small and gracile, with very small teeth, and might belong to a female. Age estimation based on attrition was assessed as 25-30 years. The 1 st molar was described as a 5X- type and also had a 6th cusp. The 3rd molar had a deep buccal pit. The molars showed hypoplasia in the cervical third. Alveolar bone resorption was seen in the M1-M2 area as a result of periodontal disease. An unusual (cultural?) wear pattern was observed on the 2nd premolar, possibly due to use of the teeth for smoothing fiber. Roentgenographic examination of the mandible showed pulp stones in the 1st and 2nd permanent molars (Photo 149B). All permanent molars were taurodont and the 2nd molar was one-rooted. H4: An unerupted lower right permanent 1st molar (crown incomplete) was recovered. A burnt mandibular body fragment (right side) with the broken deciduous 2nd molar was also found. Dental age was estimated at 2-3 years. Other skeletal remains that could be attributed to the same child included a burnt right pubic bone, a burnt right condyle of the mandible, and a midshaft fragment of tibia. H5: A burnt mandibular body fragment (right side) containing a broken 1 st molar was recovered. 242</page><page sequence="244">ANTHROPOLOGICAL AND TAPHONOMIC ANALYSES OF SKELETAL REMAINS A large and deep mental foramen was located below the 2nd premolar, which had been lost postmortem. The mandible was large, thick and heavy, as was a burnt fragment of the symphysis with no preserved teeth. Both fragments might belong to the same adult individual, possibly a male. Several small cranial fragments of both adults and sub-adults (adolescent and young child) were recovered. Additional findings from this locus included post-cranial bones and bone fragments of both adults and sub-adults. In most cases isolated bones could not be attributed to a specific individual, and only age category was assigned when possible. Post-cranial bones were found in different states of preservation; some had been Photo 149. (A) Lateral view of the mandible of the H3 individual.

Burnt post- cranial remains of adults included tibia (?) midshaft fragment, humerus midshaft fragment, left (?) femur midshaft fragment (close to the proximal end), right zygomaxilla (almost black), tibia (?) midshaft fragments (light to dark gray), right (?) ulna midshaft fragment (gracile), humeri, radii and ulnae midshaft fragments, proximal phalanx of the toe, rib fragments, and a small pelvis fragment (almost black). Other adult remains included a right femur head, right femur midshaft (anterior-posterior diameter of the midshaft, roughly 30 mm), right tibia midshaft, right fibula midshaft, two midshaft fragments of the forearm bones, right humerus midshaft fragment (close to the proximal end), metacarpal bones, distal, proximal and middle phalanges, fragmentary metatarsal bones, left patella, fragmentary 1st cervical vertebra, and rib fragments. Burnt sub-adult post-cranial remains included tibia (?) midshaft fragment, right humerus midshaft fragments, other long bone midshaft fragments, fragmentary ribs, fragmentary right pubic bone (young child), tibia midshaft fragment (young child), and hand and foot bones. Other sub-adult bones included right femur midshaft (anterior-posterior diameter of the midshaft 21.8 mm, mediolateral diameter of the midshaft 21.3 mm; adolescent), right humerus (distal part), iliac bone fragment, 1st proximal metacarpal (13-15-year-old adolescent), foot phalanx (small size, fusion of the epiphysis in progress but still incomplete, indicating late adolescent), two proximal phalanges (small size, complete fusion, may be from the same individual as the previous one), metacarpal bone and proximal phalanx (juvenile), proximal and distal phalanges of the toe (adolescent), and 1st proximal phalanx of the hand (adolescent). Other findings were small fragments or merely charred pieces of bones and could not be identified. Data obtained from the analyses of post-cranial bones were in agreement with the cranial findings. The analyses did not reveal additional individuals but did confirm the presence of a child, a juvenile, an adolescent, and adult(s) in the locus. 243</page><page sequence="245">CHAPTER FOURTEEN Photo 150.

Fragments of the right and left parietal and of the frontal bones were also found and might belong to the same individual. H7: This is a juvenile, possibly male. A mandibular body fragment with the right 1st permanent molar, unerupted right 2nd permanent premolar and the broken left permanent canine was found in a pit (Photo 151 A). The canine showed 244</page><page sequence="246">ANTHROPOLOGICAL AND TAPHONOMIC ANALYSES OF SKELETAL REMAINS severe hypoplasia. The isolated lower left deciduous 2nd molar and the lower left permanent 1st molar were also recovered. The latter showed attrition identical to that of the right permanent 1st molar found in the mandible and was of the same size and shape. Based on these findings, the molar was attributed to the same individual. Dental age was estimated at 10-11 years (Photo 151B). The well- defined squared chin suggested a male individual. ISOLATED FINDINGS Additional findings from this site included mainly teeth, hand and foot bones, and cranial and long bone fragments of both adults and sub-adults. These findings could not be attributed to a specific individual with certainty. We could assign some of the findings to an age category and have presented our considerations as comments in Table 40. Data obtained from the analyses of the isolated findings were in agreement with those derived from the burials. A careful examination of the additional findings allowed us to suggest that there might be two additional juveniles, one aged 8-10 years and the other aged 1 1-12 years. Moreover, we identified teeth of an individual aged ±35 years. These teeth, however, could represent an additional individual or could belong to the H5 adult male whose age was not previously determined. 14.3. BURIAL PRACTICES Taphonomic analyses of the bones, their positioning in the grave, and their different state of preservation as compared to other bones found at the same locus suggest that the burial of HI was initially primary and was later disturbed. The skull was found lying on its right side with the mandible located downward of the maxilla but at almost at 90° to it, with the left ramus pointing upwards. No signs of fire were observed on the skull or on the right side of the mandible. On the other hand, the small portion of the symphysis that was recovered separately did show signs of burning, and such signs were seen to a much lesser extent on the internal lower edge of the left portion of the mandibular body. Small burnt long bone fragments were found inside the left orbit, below the left part of the mandibular body, and in close proximity to the skull. Although most of the post-cranial bones were found intermixed with the remains of other individuals, a larger portion of the right femur including the head, a right tibia, and a right fibula were recovered and might be attributed to this young male. The right tibia and fibula were observed in the anatomical order. None of these long bones showed signs of exposure to fire. Altogether, these findings suggested that the primary burial of a young adult had been disturbed. 14.4. PALEODEMOGRAPHY Of the nine individuals (including two juveniles identified from the isolated findings) recovered from the PPNC Ashkelon site, six were sub-adults and three adults (Table 39). Eight of them (~89%) could be aged using standard anthropometric criteria. Nearly 70% of the identified individuals were less than 1 8 years old. Neither infants nor old individuals were found. Sex was determined in five individuals, two females and three males. They included a 10-11- year-old juvenile male and a 13-15-year-old adolescent female. 14.5. OSTEOLOGY AND DENTITION The human skeletal remains found in the site were poorly preserved. Two major factors have contributed to the poor state of bone preservation: heavy, wet sand and exposure of some of the bones to fire. The only almost complete cranium, that of the young male, was long, narrow, and dolichocranic in shape. Only approximate measurements could be obtained because of post-mortem side-to-side compression. The maximal cranial length could be approximately estimated at 188 mm, falling well within the range of variation for this region (Smith 1995). All long bones were incomplete and presented mostly as midshaft fragments, with the external surfaces having eroded post mortem. Neither length nor diameter could be measured except for the right femur, measured in the field as ~440 mm long. The bone had a marked linea aspera 245</page><page sequence="247">CHAPTER FOURTEEN and its anterior-posterior diameter was measured as 30 mm. Thick cortex was observed in the broken midshaft of the bone. The stature of the individual was estimated following the equations of Trotter and Gleser (1958) for white males based on the femur length and accounted for 167.61+3.94 cm. This estimate falls well within the range of variation reported for this period (Smith 1995). Mandibles and teeth were much better preserved. The estimate of the minimal number of individuals was based on the number of the mandibles and mandibular body fragments and accounted for seven individuals. Age of individuals and disease patterns were obtained based on the teeth. Mandibles and teeth were measured and compared to those available from other middle to late PPN sites in Israel: Abu Ghosh, dated to the PPNB-PN, and 'Atlit Yam, dated to the PPNC (Tables 41-43).

The data for comparison were thus limited to two sites and only a few measurements (Arensburg et al. 1978; Smith and Horwitz 1997; Sklar and Smith 2003). The HI mandible of the young male from PPNC Ashkelon was very similar to that of the Homo 8 male from Abu Ghosh. It should be noted, however, that the mandibular body of the H7 juvenile was wider than that of the HI adult male. The teeth of HI and H7 from PPNC Ashkelon were similar in size to those from Abu Ghosh. The very small mandible of the H3 individual had small teeth and taurodont molars (Tables 42^13). Carabelli's cusp was recorded in two permanent upper 1st molars and one permanent 3rd molar. Among the deciduous teeth only one upper 1st molar showed this trait. Shoveling was observed in both upper lateral incisors of the HI individual. 14.6. PATHOLOGY The poor state of bone preservation did not allow examination of bone pathology. Teeth, on the contrary, provided a wealth of information on disease patterns, including hypoplasia, periodontal disease, and caries. Forty-seven teeth were examined for the presence of hypoplasia. Due to the small number of the teeth available for the analysis, the data for the right and left sides were combined and are summarized in Table 44. There were more hypoplastic teeth among the mandibular teeth. The permanent canine, the 2nd permanent premolar and the 3rd permanent molar were worst affected. Out of the three deciduous molars analyzed, hypoplasia was observed in only one, an upper left 2nd molar. Altogether, these findings suggest that the population was exposed to multiple environmental 247</page><page sequence="249">CHAPTER FOURTEEN Table 44. Prevalence of hypoplasia in permanent teeth.

Periodontal disease was observed in both HI and H3, the only two that were available for this kind of analysis. In HI alveolar resorption was observed in the M1-M2 area in both the maxilla and mandible. Both individuals were less than 30 years old: the HI was a young adult in his early twenties and H3 was 25-30 years old. Only one case of caries was recorded. This was in the lower right 2nd permanent molar of a young individual. This finding is consistent with the low caries frequency previously recorded for this period. In addition, agenesis of the 3rd permanent molar was observed in the HI mandible and pulp stones were noticed in the 1st and 2nd permanent molars of the H3 mandible. 14.7. CONCLUSIONS The single primary burial showed some charring on the lower border of the left side of the mandible. This, like the burnt bones attributed to other individuals in the vicinity, shows none of the cracking or shrinkage associated with cremations, and the bones were probably accidentally exposed to fire some time after death. It does not seem that we are dealing with intentional cremations such as those described for the PN site of Eilat (Avner 1991). Anthropological findings suggest that the PPNC inhabitants of Ashkelon resembled the PPNB-PN population of Abu Ghosh, both in skeletal and dental morphology and in disease patterns. The one cranium that could be measured falls within the range of the larger PPNB crania summarized by Arensburg et al. (1978). The adult male mandible and teeth were also found to lie within the upper range of variation of the PPNB and PN findings from Abu Ghosh. The skeletal remains from Ashkelon attributed to the PPNC described here are too fragmentary for far-reaching conclusions. However, they do seem to fall within the range of variation found in the earlier PPNB populations in the region, and differ from the later Chalcolithic populations so far identified in size and robusticity. 248</page><page sequence="250">PART V: ARCHAEOZOOLOGICAL AND ARCHAEOMETRIC STUDIES</page><page sequence="251">CHAPTER 15 THE MAMMAL BONES Brian Hesse and Dolores Rookis Remarkably abundant and well-preserved samples of faunai remains were recovered from the excavations conducted in 1997-1998 at Neolithic Ashkelon. The following short review summarizes the key features of the mammalian assemblage and discusses a few aspects of the significance of the bone sample to the history of animal exploitation in the southern Levant.* While the basic identifications were made with the aid of the comparative collections at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, additional work on the identification and morphological description of the rarer taxa remains to be done. Thus, the current report presents only the initial impressions of the fauna from Neolithic Ashkelon. The curated collection is managed by the Israel Antiquities Authority and housed in the zooarchaeological storage facility at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Giv'at Ram campus. Attentive collection methods produced over 94,000 bone fragments from the site. While most of the fragments can be assigned to a 1 x 1 m sampling unit within the site, for the purposes of this initial report the collection is treated as a whole. The materials were assigned to a series of taxa at various levels of specificity (Table 45). Much of the sample is made up of small scraps of bone, classified as "animal" (a category that includes mammal, bird, * DR was responsible for much of the administration of the processing of the material in Israel and also created the StatPac™ data file used to develop this report. BH identified the bone fragments and conducted the analysis of the collection.

Ostrich egg shells (photograph B. Boaz). Thirty-two ostrich eggshell fragments were found as well (Photo 152). 15.1. MAIN SPECIES The most salient part of the collection for the purposes of this article is the main mammal species, whose frequencies are presented in Table 45. The values for sheep and goat are included in the sheep/ goat category as well, to facilitate comparison to the pigs and cattle. Estimates of taxonomie abundance are presented for these species using the raw count of bones assigned to a category (TNF=total number of fragments, or NISP=number of identified specimens; see Hesse and Wapnish 1985). Cattle and sheep/goats (mostly sheep) dominate the sample, though modest amounts of pig and a scattering of gazelles are present. The results can usefully be compared to the sketchy record of other late PPN and PN sites in the southern Levant (see Hesse and Wapnish 2002: 475-476, Tables 17.1, 17.2). Other coastal sites also seem to be relatively rich in cattle, the most distinguishing feature at Ashkelon. The patterns at ' Atlit Yam (Horwitz and Tchernov 1987) and Neve Yam (Horwitz 1988), though based on much smaller samples, also reflect a focus on cattle, as well as roughly comparable usages of pigs. The significant number of sheep remains in the Ashkelon sample compares best with the few samples of PN sites published to date. The data contrast with the samples from inland sites (except for the lowest levels at Tel Dan, where the tiny size of the collection makes it a less than robust estimate of animal exploitation in the Galilee), in which cattle are far less frequent. Tentatively, we may suggest that a coastal form of animal utilization persisted in the late PPNB through the PN. The abundance of cattle in this phase of the Levantine Neolithic, in a site where the lack of architecture suggests a non-sedentary occupation, raises the question of the domestic or wild status of the animal. Morphologically, the animals are considerably larger than Middle Bronze Age specimens from the tel at Ashkelon (Hesse and Wapnish in press). However, in order to determine whether they are large enough to be considered wild cattle or small enough to be securely classified as domestic in form, a better understanding of the morphology of Bos primigenius on the eastern Mediterranean littoral is necessary. A summary of several measurements is presented in Table 46 as a step towards compiling the database of evidence needed in order to make that set of distinctions. A similar set of problems besets the pig sample. Table 46. Measurements of cattle bones and pig teeth (GL= greatest length).

The sheep and goat specimens are all much smaller than wild examples. 15.2. MORTALITY The mortality pattern of culled animals is a useful indicator of the relationship between human groups and the species they exploit. The mortality of the Ashkelon sheep/goat and cattle samples were estimated through an evaluation of the state of long bone epiphyseal fusion (for this method, see Hesse and Wapnish 1985). These data are presented in Tables 47 and 48. The patterns for the small and large cattle diverge sharply. Between one-quarter and one-third of the cattle are culled from the herd as young calves, while about half of any cohort survives to maturity. Few late adolescent and young adult animals seem to have been taken. A pattern like this is consistent either with dairy production, if the animals were husbanded, or with a catastrophic kill-off, if the population consisted of a (perhaps wild) nursery herd. The mortality of the sheep/goat cull is quite different. Few animals are slaughtered Table 47. Cattle mortality. Note that after an initial cull in the first year of life, most cattle in a typical cohort died as adults.

This pattern is consistent with the management of caprids in a scheme emphasizing the production of meat. 15.3. CARCASS REPRESENTATION There is a difference between large and small animals in the way their carcasses are represented at the site. The comparison of the sample of large mammals (almost all likely to have been cattle) with that of the medium-sized mammals (mostly sheep and goats with some mixture of pigs and gazelles) shown in Table 49 illustrates that the differences are concentrated in the abundances of fragments of crania, mandibles, and teeth, which are relatively high for the medium mammals, and toes, which are high in the large mammals. Given the relatively intensive collection methods employed during the excavation and the large number of small bone fragments recovered, we believe that these data are an accurate reflection of the state of preservation in the site. Looking at the evidence more closely, the abundance of elements of the head in the medium-mammal category stems almost completely from the large quantities of tooth fragments in this group, suggesting that part of the contrast is related to the relative survivability Table 48. Sheep/goat mortality. Note that most sheep and goats were apparently culled as adolescents, between 1 and 2 years of age; many survived to adulthood.

The difference in the abundance of toes seems not to be affected by a similar taphonomic process, suggesting that the animals in the different size categories were butchered in somewhat different ways. 15.4. CONCLUSIONS The preliminary analysis of the Ashkelon faunai sample reveals a pattern of animal use comparable to other contemporary coastal sites in the southern Levant. The domestic or wild status of two of the main taxa, cattle and pigs, remains unresolved. The mortality and carcass utilization patterns of the large and small cattle suggest that the two taxa were used in different ways. Considerably more information about spatial patterning in the reduction of the carcasses of these animals will emerge when the locational information about the collection can be included in the analysis. 254</page><page sequence="255">CHAPTER 16 THE TESTUDINES REMAINS Gideon Hartman 16.1. INTRODUCTION Turtles are very abundant in hunter-gatherer sites throughout the Paleolithic sequence in the Mediterranean region. Establishing whether tortoise remains accumulated in archaeological sites due to human activity or natural processes is important for refining our understanding of human foraging strategies and their continuity through the Paleolithic and across the Neolithic transition. The tortoise remains retrieved from the excavations in 1997-1998 at the PPNC site of Ashkelon will first be examined according to taphonomic criteria, to establish whether humans were the primary collectors of the tortoise remains. If this proves to be the case, the turtle remains will be used to consider whether the transition to farming was a gradual process, with domestic resources slowly replacing foraging, and if the transition to a domestic economy was fully completed by this stage. In addition, the representation of turtle species at the site will be used to reconstruct paleoenvironmental conditions at the site and determine whether conditions in the PPNC were similar to those of today. 1. THE PRESENT ENVIRONMENT The southern coastal plain is characterized by interlocking areas of sand dunes, fertile soils and marshes. A series of calcareous sandstone ridges ( kurkar ) runs north to south along the coast and marks former beach transgressions created by fluctuating sea levels during the Pleistocene (Klein 1988). The presence of two major seasons, mild, wet winters and hot, dry summers, typifies the climate (Table 50). The vegetation of the plain region is largely Mediterranean, with shrubs and grasses that thrive in dune and marshy environments (Zohary 1982). 2. PRESENT-DAY HABITAT DISTRIBUTION OF THE TESTUDINES The Testudo graeca tortoise is the commonest representative of the Testudines in Israel. It inhabits a variety of habitats in the Mediterranean climate zone, including sandy soils and hilly regions, but prefers scrub-covered areas (Werner 1966; Pritchard 1979). The distribution of the Mauremys caspica freshwater turtle in Israel is limited to permanent bodies of water, including extremely polluted ones, in which the depth does not normally exceed one Table 50. Average temperature (°C) and precipitation (mm) in the southern coastal plain of Israel (Central Bureau of Statistics, 2000).

Human-made fishponds and sewage plants, created in the last fifty years, have extended its present distribution in the southern Mediterranean coastal plain from Nahal Sorek to Nahal Lachish (Sidis 1983). This artificial expansion, however, still lies to the north of the archaeological site. 3. METHODS OF COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS The site was excavated using a 5 x 5 m grid, generally subdivided into 1 x 1 m sub-squares. All the excavated material found in situ or in the sieves was numbered and identified by layer and subsquare. B. Hesse of the University of Alabama at Birmingham carried out a preliminary identification and separation of the chelonian remains. Further identification of species and shell element was carried out by myself using the comparative collection in the Zooarchaeology laboratory in the department of Evolution, Systematics and Ecology at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. It is worth noting that while Hesse and Rookis (Chapter 15) identified 132 turtle remains, only 57 fragments were made available for this study. Because the sample is incomplete, part of the taphonomic interpretation might be biased. Each bone was measured for comparative research, and taphonomic factors affecting the bony plates that comprise the testudines shell were examined. Taphonomic damage attributed to both natural depositional processes and human activity was recorded (i.e., burning, polishing, breakage pattern, abrasion of sutures, striations, carnivore damage, and digestion marks). The maximum length and width of each of the bony plates were recorded using digital calipers (Tesa) to the nearest 0.1 mm. All measurements were taken on fixed reference points specific to each element. In addition, general maximum length, width, and thickness of the bony plates were recorded for the fragmented specimens that included the majority of the recovered material. To monitor the role of fluvial processes in the deposition of the turtle assemblage, an issue especially relevant to turtles, which naturally inhabit aquatic environments, the degree of abrasion was recorded for each specimen. A relative scale for the quantification of abrasion (1-4) was created by measuring the finely serrated circumferential sutures surrounding the bony plates. Stage 1 refers to perfect preservation of the sutures. Stage 2 is slight abrasion expressed as minor blunting of the denticulation. Stage 3 refers to heavy abrasion with massive wear of the sutures. Finally, Stage 4 describes a complete disappearance of the sutures and abrasion of the sulcus (the impressions made by the overlaying keratinous scutes on the bony plates). Other taphonomic indicators, including polish, striations, and burning on the bones' surface, were recorded on a presence/absence basis to assess the role of human activity. Weathering was not recorded according to the typical standard created by Behrensmeyer (1978) due to differences in the structure and size of chelonian bones, which affect the way they respond to external elements. Instead, weathering was recorded as "dry" or "fresh", somewhat subjective categories assigned according to the texture and color of the archaeological bones. Finally, the location of fractures on each specimen was recorded in detail and checked for regularities. 16.2. RESULTS 1. SPECIES REPRESENTATION Two Testudines species were identified at Ashkelon, Testudo graeca and Mauremys caspica rivulata. Despite the presence of a unique barnacle species ( Chelonibia testudinaria), which is often commensal with sea turtles (Chapter 18), no remains of sea turtles were recovered. 2. SPECIES IDENTIFICATION Since the onset of the Holocene 10,000 years ago, the number of Testudines species found on the eastern Mediterranean coastal plain is limited to one tortoise, four sea turtles, one semi-aquatic turtle and one freshwater turtle species. No remains of large shell elements related to sea turtles or to the semi-aquatic softshell turtle Trionyx triunguis were recovered. Elements found at the site instead belong to small to medium-sized Testudines species. The 256</page><page sequence="257">THE TESTUDINES REMAINS Fig. 118. Shell morphology of Testudo graeca, with nomenclature of bones. In the carapace: PI- 11 peripheral; Pie 1-8 pleural; Nl-7 neural. most common medium-sized species (with carapace size of 150-220 mm) in the region today are the terrestrial tortoise Testudo graeca and the freshwater turtle Mauremys caspica. Only two other species may have occupied the region in the PPNC, another species of terrestrial tortoise, Testudo kleinmanni, and a second freshwater turtle, Emys orbicularis. T. kleinmanni is a very small tortoise (maximum 135 mm), found only in arid habitats of North Africa and Sinai. T. kleinmanni is much smaller in body size than its Mediterranean counterpart and can be differentiated by its pygal bone, characterized by a distinct upward flare (Ernst and Barbour 1989). No remains of T. kleinmanni were identified at the site, according to these criteria. E. orbicularis is a freshwater turtle found today in Europe and Western Asia, and it has been claimed that the species was present in the Mediterranean region less than a century ago (Fritz 1989). E. orbicularis is easily distinguished from the local freshwater turtle M. caspica by the lack of buttresses on the hinge connecting the plastron and the carapace, the absence of a deep xiphiplastral notch, and the presence of a hinge at the point of contact between the hyoplastron and hypoplastron plates (Ernst and Barbour 1989). As for T. kleinmanni, no remains meeting these characteristics were identified at the site. The remains at the site do, however, closely match modern comparative specimens of T. graeca and M. caspica. Discrimination between T. graeca and M. caspica was relatively simple since they belong to well distinguished families. T. graeca is a member of the terrestrial family Testudinidae, while M. caspica is a member of the freshwater family Bataguridae. Clear differences in the shape of individual elements, the pattern of sulci in the bones formed by the keratinous sheath, and the thickness of plastral elements are evident between the two species. For example, the carapace can generally be divided into three major groups of bony plates; neurais, pleurals, and peripherals (Fig. 118). In the neurais of T. graeca the vertebral column is connected to the neural plates by a narrow bridge structure. In M. caspica the vertebral column is fused to the neural plates, forming a wide tunnel- shaped structure. On the dorsal side of the pleural plates of T. graeca, the proximal epiphysis of the ribs are narrow in comparison to M. caspica and the marks of the growth rings are obvious.

Hartman). profile the peripheral plates of T. graeca are straight, while in M. caspica they are concave with a slight upward tilt on the distal edge (Photo 153). Of the 57 chelonian bones identified at the site, the dominant species is T. graeca (NISP=48), with an MNI of at least five individuals determined by the hyoplastron (L), one of the plastral plates. The representation of M. caspica in the site is less significant (NISP=7; MNI=1). 3. BODY-PART REPRESENTATION OF TESTUDINES AT ASHKELON Only shell fragments were discovered in the site. Though they are easily identified, no long bone or cranial elements were recovered, most likely because of sampling limitations derived from the urgent character of the excavation. Of the bony plates, 65% (NISP=37) originate from the carapace and the rest (NISP=20) from the plastron. This ratio is slightly biased toward the plastron in comparison to the expected ratio observed in the complete shell, of which 80% is composed of bony plates from the carapace. This bias can be explained by the fragmentation of the majority of the plastron elements (75%, n=15). In at least two cases, fragments with the same provenience were refitted. The percentage of fragmented carapace plates was lower (58%, n=19) than for plastral elements. 4. SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION OF TESTUDINES ELEMENTS AT ASHKELON All of the turtle remains were found in Layer IV, assigned to the PPNC, and 91% of them were concentrated between Layers IVa and IVb. The excavators described the separation between these two layers as unclear, and some of the bones have therefore been categorized as belonging to both layers (IVa/b). There is no evidence that the fragments were sorted by natural pre-depositional processes or by post-depositional vertical movement in the sediment (Fig. 119). 5. TAPHONOMY OF THE TESTUDINES ASSEMBLAGE The majority of plates show signs of dry weathering, though observations indicate that in several cases 258</page><page sequence="259">THE TESTUDINES REMAINS Fig. 119. Spatial distribution of turtle remains by layer, plotted on the excavation grid lines. The circles represent relative size of individual fragments. (n=6) the quality of preservation appears much fresher. The average degree of abrasion recorded in the site is low. None of the plates was diagnosed as more than Stage 2; 42% were perfectly preserved and 58% were minimally abraded. No connection was identified between soil type (sands or clays), stratigraphy, and the level of abrasion or weathering (Tables 51-52). Only three plates showed possible burn marks, though none of these was recovered from a hearth. All of these plates are also polished and comprise the only polished bones in the assemblage. One of these plates showed additional signs of digestion, including pitting and thinning (Photo 154). None of the bones showed signs of cut marks or tooth marks. No regularities were found in the breakage of the bony plates. Each of the plastron plates was uniquely broken. In two cases fragmented bony plates were found in articulation. In the first case, peripheral plate 7 was articulated to a broken peripheral 8 (Photo 155). In the second case, two fragments of the entoplastron and hyoplastron (right side) were still articulated. 6. CARNIVORE DAMAGE A few of the bony plates (n=3) show evidence of digestion marks. Digestion can be identified by the 259</page><page sequence="260">CHAPTER SIXTEEN Table 51. Distribution of bone fragments in the Neolithic layers. Layer Maximum Width Sd. Maximum Length Sd.

Environmental factors like water that has the potential to create polish marks are expected to act on the whole assemblage. The fact that only a few bones were partly polished supports the assumption that the source of this polish is digestion. Both hyenas (H. hyaena ) and canids (C. lupus, C. aureus, Photo 155. Fragmented peripheral 8 (right) still articulated to peripheral 7 (left) (photograph G. Hartman). C. familiaris ) can be responsible for this type of damage. Both are opportunistic scavengers and their geographic distribution includes the southern 260</page><page sequence="261">THE TESTUDINES REMAINS coastal plain (Mendelssohn and Yom-Tov 1999). It seems implausible that hyenas approached the site, scavenged non-meaty bony plates, and had enough time to leave feces in the same location (see Yellen 1991). In addition, there are no tooth marks to support active prédation of tortoises. Hyenas should therefore be excluded as possible contributors to the creation of the assemblage. Series of dog- feeding experiments show that canids are capable of swallowing and digesting bone fragments smaller than 25 mm (Payne and Munson 1985). The size of the damaged plates in Ashkelon falls between 12 and 25 mm. Davis (1985: 79-80) used the same argument to support his claim that dogs were already domesticated in earlier Natufian sites. This indirect evidence is supported by other reports of early domestication from the Levant that include joint burials of humans and canids (Davis and Valla 1978; Tchernov and Valla 1997). Canid remains are mentioned in the zooarchaeological report by Hesse and Rookies (Chapter 14), but are not identified to the species level. Until the completion of the faunai analysis this issue will remain unresolved. Domesticated dogs (C. familiaris), wolves (C. lupus), or jackals (C. aureus ) could all be equally responsible for the digestion marks evident on the tortoise remains. 16.3. DISCUSSION 1. TAPHONOMIC SUMMARY In the absence of extensive carnivore damage, as is the case at Ashkelon, there are three natural factors that could have deposited the bones: water, wind, and bioturbation. However, overall the evidence does not point to natural accumulators. First, the site is located on top of a kurkar ridge, and it is therefore unlikely that water energy could have played a significant role in moving the whole assemblage directly into the site. Wind transport can also be excluded because of the absence of abraded bony plates. Analysis of the rate of abrasion shows a low level of abrasion, suggesting that the bones were not transported prior to the burial. Despite the dynamic character of the sediment within the site, and the potential for bioturbation by rodent species, no shell refits were made in support of this argument. In addition, as mentioned above, most of the bones were deposited in two adjacent layers and no size sorting was observed. Finally, most of the Testudines remains from Ashkelon were found in Layers IVa and IVb, as are the rest of faunai remains in the site. All the remains are directly associated with numerous hearths and pits, which accumulated in the same layers. Together these lines of evidence point to humans as the most likely collectors of turtle bones at the site. Under natural conditions, tortoise shells disarticulate into separated bony plate along the suture lines (Dodd 1995; Hartman 2001). Breakage of bony plates can be related to the immediate cause of the animal's death or may happen at later stages in response to factors such as trampling or the methods of excavation. While later breakage of the bony plates affects only single separated bony plates, impacts to fresh, articulated chelonian shells influence the shell structure as a unit. This kind of impact results in breakage across more than one plate and is independent of the suture lines, thus creating smaller fragments formed from partly articulated plates. Two interesting kinds of breakage were observed at the site. As presented in the results, the first case involved the articulation of two fragmented plastron plates and the second, the articulation of two broken peripheral plates at the edge of the bridge that connects the plastron to the carapace. In the absence of clear evidence for burnt plates, as reported in South African sites (Sampson 2000), this is the best evidence that these tortoise remains accumulated in the site as a direct result of human activity. There is evidence from the Paleolithic in Israel that tortoise carapaces were used secondarily as containers (Munro 2001; Speth and Tchernov 2002). Perhaps, in an attempt to avoid damaging the carapace during use, the shell was opened from the plastron or the bridge structure that connects the plastron and the carapace, as demonstrated by Stiner and Tchernov ( 1 998 : 25 1 ). This may explain the lack of burn marks on the remains and the high percentage of unbroken carapace elements in comparison to plastron elements. 261</page><page sequence="262">CHAPTER SIXTEEN 2. FRESHWATER TURTLES AND FLUCTUATING CLIMATE At least seven bones of the freshwater turtle Mauremys caspica were recovered from separate locations in the site. The geographic distribution of this species in Israel is limited by the presence of permanent freshwater sources. Its preferred habitat includes low-energy streams or standing water that does not exceed a depth of a meter. The site of Ashkelon is located about 25 km south of the nearest natural, permanent source of water found today in the region. It is highly improbable that the inhabitants of Ashkelon invested energy in carrying freshwater turtles from such a distant source. New paleoclimatic reconstructions based on speleothems obtained from karstie caves located near Jerusalem recorded a simultaneous decrease in 8180 and a high increase in 813C, interpreted as an unusually wet period between 8500 and 7000 years ago (Bar-Matthews et al. 1999). The source of the precipitation recorded in the caves has been attributed to the Mediterranean Sea (Frumkin et al. 1999). These new results indicate that earlier suggestions explaining the collapse of the PPNB by the retreat of monsoonal systems around 8000-7800 years ago are not directly relevant to the Mediterranean coastal region (COHMAP 1988; Bar-Yosef 1996). The presence of the freshwater turtle beyond its present distribution can only be explained by the existence of permanent water bodies, extending southward during a wet period. Therefore, one should be cautious when suggesting that the shift to pastoral lifeways was triggered by deteriorating environmental conditions (Köhler- Rollefson 1989). 3. CONCLUSION Evidence from the site of Ashkelon shows that turtles were actively gathered and consumed by humans during the Neolithic period. This suggests that the transition to an agricultural economy was a gradual rather than a revolutionary process. Bones showing digestion marks, presumed to be created by canids and perhaps even domesticated dogs, were found in the site, but more direct evidence is needed to support this suggestion. The presence of the freshwater turtle M. caspica in the assemblage indicates environmental conditions that were wetter than today's. Therefore, the reconstruction of the paleoenvironment of the region should include the presence of permanent water sources in proximity to the site during the PPNC. 262</page><page sequence="263">CHAPTER 17 THE FISH BONES Omri Lernau The systematic sieving through a 3 mm mesh of the entire sediment excavated in 1997-1998 at Neolithic Ashkelon produced 789 fish bones for analysis. The poor state of preservation allowed the identification of only 294 bones, which constitute the basis for this report. Sizes of some of the original fish could be estimated by measuring the better-preserved bones, though these sizes should be regarded only as rough approximations. The minimum number of individuals (MNI) was estimated for the entire excavated area. 17.1. THE DATA The bones belonged to nine different families (Table 53). There was only one bone of a freshwater fish, while all the others belonged to marine families. The identified bones are described according to their frequency in the assemblage. Family Serranidae (groupers, marine fish): There were 252 bones identified to this family (Table 54), 86% of all identified bones. Only four bones could be more specifically identified to the level of four species: Epinephelus aeneus (Geoffrey St. Hilaire 1817) = white grouper; Epinephelus marginatus (Lowe 1834) = dusky grouper; Epinephelus costae (Steindachner 1878) = golden grouper; and Mycteroperca rubra (Bloch 1793) = mottled grouper. These are the important species of groupers in the Mediterranean, and the other Serranid bones probably also belonged to them. The majority of the bones (196), including the first vertebrae, were skeletal elements from the region of the non-edible head, while 55 vertebrae and one dorsal spine belonged to the meat-bearing edible part of the fish. Estimation of MNI for this family was 22. Measurements of 123 bones gave size estimations between 34 and 76 cm, with an average of 51 cm. Family Sparidae (porgies, marine fish): Sixteen bones belonged to this family, all of them from the region of the head (premaxillary bones, dentaries, and typical loose flat molariform teeth). Three bones were identified to the level of the species Sparus auratus (Linnaeus 1758) = gilthead sea- bream. MNI was estimated at 3. Measurements of one bone gave an estimated size of about 31 cm. Family Mugilidae (mullets, marine fish): One head bone (left operculum) and one posterior vertebra were identified to the level of the family only. MŅi = 1. Measurements of the head bone gave a size estimation of about 35 cm. Family Sciaenidae (drums, marine fish): One left otolith was identified to the species Argyrosomus regius (Asso 1801) = meagre, with an estimated size of about 57 cm. Family Carangidae (horse mackerels, marine fish): One large jaw bone (right maxilla) belonged to a sizeable fish of this family, probably Seriola dumerili (Risso 18 10) = greater amberjack, with an estimated size of about 120 cm. Family Scombridae (tunas, marine fish): One posterior vertebra was identified to the level of the family only. Family Balistidae (triggerfish, marine fish): One third spine behind the head belonged to Balistes carolinensis (Gmelin 1789) = gray triggerfish. Sub-order sharks and rays (Elasmobranchii, marine fish): Nineteen centra of cartilaginous fish were found. Sharks have no ossified bones, but the 263</page><page sequence="264">CHAPTER SEVENTEEN Table 53.

DISCUSSION The bones of groupers were found scattered over a large part of the excavated area, with an average concentration per 886 excavated m2 of 0.3 bones/ m2. However, they showed four areas of clustering in the northeastern and southeastern zones. There, in sectors measuring 24, 18, 17, and 6 m2, their concentrations were found to be 0.9, 2.3, 4.1, and 4.7 bones/m2 respectively. Three of these sectors coincided with clusters of hearths, but one did not; conversely, the main cluster of hearths in the northern part of the excavated area produced no fish remains at all. There were 90 bones that showed signs of scorching by fire, 33 of them belonging to groupers and the remainder damaged beyond identification. The spatial distribution of the non-edible head bones was compared to that of the meat-bearing parts of the body, and was found to overlap. These findings suggest that there was no separation between areas of processing and of consumption of the fish; the fish had been prepared and consumed in the same locations. Another probable conclusion is that the fish were not processed for the purpose of trade. One may deduce this from the large proportion of vertebrae among the remains of groupers (28%). Had the fish been decapitated and dried or smoked for transportation, one would expect to find only few vertebrae left behind. The role of fish in the economy of PPNC Ashkelon needs to be evaluated against the background of other finds, especially the remains of domesticated and non-domesticated animals. During the early eighth millennium BP, growing human societies experienced increasing environmental pressures, which directed them to new modes of combined exploitation of available resources. Marine resources were significant components of these new types of subsistence for settlers along the coast, as suggested in the 264</page><page sequence="265">THE FISH BONES Table 54. Serranidae skeletal elements (L=left, R=right, M=median). present chapter, as well as in a recent model of an "Eastern Mediterranean fishing village" described by Galili et al. (2002). The predominance of groupers in this Neolithic site, in terms both of identified bones and of MNI, is worthy of attention. Groupers in the size range found at Ashkelon inhabit inshore waters and may be caught among underwater rocks with baited lines or spears (Golani and Darom 1997). Remains of groupers have been found in almost every excavated assemblage of fish bones in Israel. They frequently compose a substantial fraction of the identified bones, but usually remains of other fish, often porgies, are much more common, e.g. at Megiddo (Lernau 2000) or the City of David (Lernau and Lernau 1992). Bones of porgies, especially jaws, are tough and durable. Consequently, their dominance among fish remains might be a result of a preservation bias. It seems, therefore, even more significant that at Ashkelon there were so many bones of groupers, more than 15 times as many as bones of porgies (Fig. 120). Bones of groupers also formed the majority of fish remains excavated at PN Ziqim, 49 out of a total of 51 identifications (Lernau in Garfinkel et al. 2002). These two neighboring sites are situated in the southern coastal plain of Israel. At 'Atlit Yam, a PPNC site in the northern coastal plain, the gray triggerfish was by far the dominant fish, with 97% identified bones of a large assemblage of 3811 bones (Zohar et al. 1994; Galili et al. 2002), with only a few bones of groupers among them (Fig. 121). The apparent dominance of one kind of fish over others in these assemblages could result from a local abundance of these fish during the time of occupation of the sites, whether permanent or seasonal. This was suggested for the overwhelming dominance of the triggerfish at 'Atlit Yam, in light of a recent documented upsurge of the same fish in Ghana that occurred in the 1970s, to the extent that it completely changed the economy of fishermen for several years (Caveriviere 1982; 1991), thus demonstrating a biological potential for a dramatic and transient proliferation of the gray triggerfish. An alternative explanation would be that early Neolithic fishermen concentrated on catching certain kinds of fish. One could suggest that the simplicity of their fishing gear forced early fishermen to rely on meticulous knowledge of the conduct of their prey, and that this entailed a focus of their efforts on a limited number of species inhabiting shallow waters. A similar pattern, although less pronounced, with two dominant kinds of fish (Sparidae and Mugilidae) was found among fish remains in an earlier inland site, Epi-Paleolithic and PPNA Hatoula 265</page><page sequence="266">CHAPTER SEVENTEEN Fig. 120. Bones of fish identified at PPNC Ashkelon expressed as MNI. Fig. 121. Bones of fish identified at PPNC 'Atlit Yam expressed as MNI. (Fig. 122). These patterns should be compared with fish remains in later periods, e.g. Lachish of the Late Bronze Age and the Iron Age II (Fig. 123) (Lernau and Golani 2004). It will take the analysis of several additional assemblages of fish bones from early coastal Neolithic sites to corroborate this supposition, which seems to emerge from the limited data available to date. 266</page><page sequence="267">THE FISH BONES Fig. 122.

THE DATA The excavation in 1997-1998 of the Neolithic site of Ashkelon yielded an estimated 3000-4000 mollusc shells. Of this assemblage, a random sample of 578 shells was examined,* described here in taxonomie order (Table 55): GASTROPODS Trochus sp.: One broken shell. Nerita sanguinolenta : One shell, worked with a hole ground opposite the aperture. Cerithium vulgatum : A broken shell. Cypraea erosa nebrites : A worked shell with a hole ground at one end of the dorsum. Cypraea pantherina : Two fragments: one of the inner (left) lip and the other of the dorsum. Phalium granulatimi: One broken shell and four fragments. Four specimens of the Muricidae family: Thais haemastoma : A complete shell with a hole in the body whorl. Hexaple x trunculus : A fragment of the spire. Bolinus brandarisś. A broken shell. In addition, there was one unidentifiable fragment from this family. In addition to the above-described marine shells, there were seven landsnails belonging to the genera Helix sp., Trochoidea sp. and one Theba pisana. * I wish to thank H.K. Mienis (curator, Mollusc Collection, Hebrew University of Jerusalem) for his assistance with shell identification and valuable comments.

Three unidentifiable gastropod fragments were also found. BIVALVES Glycymeris insubricus (previously known as Glycymeris violacescens ): 156 specimens, mostly fragments and broken specimens, and only eight</page><page sequence="269">CHAPTER EIGHTEEN complete valves and ten valves with a naturally abraded hole in their umbones. Mytilus sp.: One complete juvenile valve. Ostrea sp.: 174 specimens, mainly fragments. Only four complete valves are among them. Cerastoderma glaucum : 116 shells, of which only ten are complete valves and two more have a naturally eroded hole in the umbo. The rest are fragments and broken shells. Donax trunculus : 41 specimens, all of which are fragments and broken shells. Pholas dactylus: One fragment. In addition, there were 52 unidentifiable fragments of bivalves and six fragments of either gastropods or bivalves. SCAPHOPODS Antalis sp. (previously referred to as Dentalium sp.): One shell was found with both ends removed, measuring 16 mm long. BARNACLES Chelonibia cf. testudinaria : Five fragments were identified among the shells. This barnacle lives symbiotically on the carapace of the sea turtle (possibly Caretta caretta). One carapace fragment of a sea turtle was identified at the site (Chapter 15). 18.2. DISCUSSION Most of the shells found at Ashkelon are fragments of bivalves (95%) and gastropods (4%) of very common species and seem to represent a natural deposition. Many of the fragments (of all species) are very small and measure ca. 1 cm or less. A few comments on the ecology of some of these species may shed light on this assemblage and reinforce its interpretation as a natural deposition. The largest group in this assemblage is that of Ostrea sp., and all of its specimens belong to either Ostreola stentina or Ostrea edulis. Both species are common in the eastern Mediterranean and live on rocks in shallow water; however, they are poorly defined and difficult to distinguish (Harry 1985; Tornaritis 1987). Pholas dactylus bores into peat Fig. 124. Pendant made of worked shell. and, like Cerastoderma glaucum, is indicative of an estuary or a closed environment of shallow waters. While both of these bivalves are edible species, they have been ruled out as representing a shell midden due to the abraded and fragmentary condition in which they were found. The most common shell on eastern Mediterranean shores today is Glycymeris insubrica. It is outnumbered in this assemblage by Ostrea sp., probably due to the more fragile structure of the latter, resulting in a greater number of fragments. The presence of landsnails and barnacles further adds to the impression that this is indeed a mostly natural deposition. Theba pisana is a landsnail species introduced into Israel during the Holocene (Heller and Tchernov 1978) and recently identified at an ancient well in the underwater PPNC site of 'Atlit Yam (H. K. Mienis, personal communication). Its presence at PPNC Ashkelon as well may reflect an earlier introduction than previously thought. Alternatively, it may be a natural deposition postdating the site, as landsnails tend to estivate underground and fall into cracks. Six specimens are certainly a result of human activity: three fragments of Cypraea sp., one Nerita sp., and one Trochus sp., all originating in the Red Sea, as well as one Antalis sp. from the Mediterranean, which may have been worked or used as a bead. In addition, there is one pendant made of unclassified shell (Fig. 124). These species are common in various archaeological sites of different periods, but especially in the Neolithic (Bar- Yosef Mayer 1989; 1997; 1999). These finds are consistent with those of Perrot's excavations, in which both Red Sea and Mediterranean species were found, some of them worked (Perrot and Gopher 1996: 163, Fig. 12:3-6). 270</page><page sequence="270">CHAPTER 19 OBSIDIAN AND PUMICE FINDINGS AND THEIR PROVENANCE Jörg Keller ; Ernst Pernicka , and Kirstin Kasper 19.1. OBSIDIAN Of the 14 small pieces of obsidian found during the current excavations of the PPNC site at Ashkelon (see above, Chapter 11), ten were received for chemical characterization. Due to their small size, only trace element analysis with neutron activation (INAA) was performed in the TU Freiberg laboratory. The methods used are described elsewhere (Pernicka 1992; Pernicka et al. 1996). Forty-two elements were determined and correlation with Central Anatolian obsidian sources was achieved through an element-by- element comparison with our existing database and published datasets (Besette 1994; Keller et al. 1996; Pernicka et al. 1996; Cauvin 1998; Poidevin 1998). For the visualization of this approach we use linear , non-logarithmic binary element plots. As an example, Fig. 125 shows the La-Th relationship for all of the Anatolian, Armenian, and Caucasian obsidian sources published in Keller et al. 1996 and Pernicka et al. 1996. Other diagrams add more discriminators and can be found in these earlier publications. It should be noted that we have slightly edited the original Th-La plot by including new data for the Göllü Dag sources (Bessette 1994; Yellin 1996; Poidevin 1998). This now shows an overlap of the Nenezi Dag and Kayirli Village fields in the Th-La space. Our results, the interpretation of the analytical data shown in Table 56, clearly show two distinct and homogeneous groups representing two geological sources. These sources are identified as the Central Anatolian obsidian occurrences of Göllü Dag (six of the ten pieces; average 1 in Table 56) and Nenezi Dag (four of the ten pieces; average 2 in Table 56). The Göllü Dag source is identified as Göllü Dag A from Kömürcü (Keller and Seifried 1990; Bessette 1994; Keller et al. 1996; Pernicka et al. 1996; Yellin 1996; Cauvin 1998; Chataigner 1998; Poupeau et al. 2005). The distinction of different Göllü Dag sources with differing compositions is underlined by Table 57, in which we give averages or representative analyses of four Göllü Dag groups, GD-A to D. Table 57 also shows the similarity of the Nenezi Dag and Kayirli Village (GD-D) sources. This similarity may suggest that both obsidian eruptions are magmatologically related. Central Anatolia, and in particular Göllü Dag, have been previously identified as major sources of the obsidian artifacts found in the early sites in the Levant. Although obsidian from both the Göllü Dag and Nenezi Dag sources were already exploited during the PPNB in Anatolia, for instance at Asikli (Todd 1966; Esin 1991; Cauvin 1998; Chataigner 1998), Yellin and Frachtenberg (1992) stated that Göllü Dag is the only documented source of obsidian objects in the Levant up to and including the PPNB. It should also be noted that Perlman and Yellin (1980) already discussed a possible Nenezi Dag provenance for one obsidian tool from Beisamoun but concluded "it is not unlikely that the piece(s) are not of PPN date". Thus, the confirmation of Göllü Dag as the main source and the addition of the Nenezi Dag source in the context of PPNC obsidian from Ashkelon are the significant results of our analyses. However, the 6:4 ratio for Göllü Dag vs. Nenezi Dag may not be statistically representative. 271</page><page sequence="271">CHAPTER NINETEEN Fig. 125. Thorium-lanthanum diagram for discrimination of Anatolian and Armenian obsidian occurrences (adopted from Keller et al. 1996). Triangles represent the averages for the two compositional groups of obsidian artifacts found at Ashkelon and correlated with Göllü Dag A (Göllü Dag Kömürcü) and Nenezi Dag respectively. Note that the eastern Anatolian peralkaline obsidians from Nemrut Dag and Bingöl fall outside this field due to their high La contents (Keller et al. 1996). The designation "Göllü Dag", originally "Çiftlik" in Renfrew et al. (1966; 1968) and Blackman (1984), warrants further clarification and definition. The Quaternary dome complex of Göllü Dag between the townships of Çiftlik- Gelveri-Derinkuyu, or within the wider triangle of Aksaray-Nevsehir-Nigde, is dominantly rhyolitic, and several centers have produced obsidian-facies flows, cupolas, and pyroclastics (Batum 1975). Göllü Dag has long been recognized as a major source area for Neolithic obsidian use and trade. Intensified investigations during the last decade (Keller and Seifried 1990; Bessette 1994; Keller et al. 1996; Cauvin and Chataigner 1998; Chataigner et al. 1998; Poidevin 1998) have also led to the recognition that the rhyolitic dome complex of Göllü Dag has extruded obsidian domes and flows from several centers and at different times during the Quaternary (Batum 1975, Bigazzi et al. 1998, Chataigner 1998, Poupeau et al. 2005). Chemically, several compositional groups from Göllü Dag have been distinguished. Keller and Seifried (1990) recognized the three different local sources of Göllü Dag Kömürcü (GD- A), Göllü Dag Bozköy (GD-B), and Göllü Dag C (also known as Bozköy North or GD-NW). To these, the Kayirli source was added later and is shown as Göllü Dag D in Table 57 (Bessette 1994; Keller et al. 1996; Pernicka et al. 1996; Poidevin 1998, Chataigner 1998). Chataigner (1998) has reviewed the Göllü Dag sources in great detail and her map of the area (ibid.: 289) helps to clarify the situation.

Table 57 shows the chemical composition as well as the differences between this Göllü Dag B compared to Göllü Dag A. No object of GD-B composition has been identified at Ashkelon. The "Göllü Dag" samples recognized at PPNC Ashkelon (Table 56) refer unambiguously to the Göllü Dag Kömürcü (GD-A) occurrence, previously recognized as the Göllü Dag occurrence of first-order archaeological importance. In correlating four out of ten obsidian artifacts from Ashkelon PPNC with the Nenezi Dag source, another issue of Central Anatolian obsidian source characterization has to be addressed. This is the distinction between Nenezi Dag and Göllü Dag D (Kayirli). Nenezi Dag rises as a steep dome 500 m above the surrounding plain, only 3^4 km from the northwestern slopes of Göllü Dag and 6-7 km northwest of the village of Kayirli. Morphologically, the Nenezi dome is clearly separated from Göllü Dag. Workshops ("ateliers") of prehistoric obsidian mining have been identified on the flanks of Nenezi Dag (e.g. Chataigner 1998). There is a very close compositional similarity to the nearby obsidian 273</page><page sequence="273">CHAPTER NINETEEN Table 57. Göllü Dag and Nenezi Dag averages.

The best discriminator is obviously the Ca0-Fe203 relationship based on high-precision major element analysis (as used in Keller et al. 1996: Fig. 7). Among the trace element data, there is a tendency for Sc, Zr, and Hf to be higher in the Nenezi Dag obsidian. Chataigner (1998) has used a number of 274</page><page sequence="274">OBSIDIAN AND PUMICE FINDINGS AND THEIR PROVENANCE binary plots with Fe, Ba, Sr, and Zr, in which Nenezi Dag and Kayirli Village show slight but systematic differences. If, after this prologue, we assign the four Ashkelon obsidians to Nenezi Dag rather than the Kayirli Village source, this is based on two facts. One is the compositional trend that is recognized in all distinguishing elements, as explained above. Moreover, the Nenezi Dag source is identified as important in PPN times by its abundant presence at Asikli and Çatal Hüyük (Cauvin 1998; Chataigner 1998; Poupeau et al. 2005; Keller unpublished data). The correlation of the Ashkelon obsidians leaves no doubt about the identity of the six Göllü Dag artifacts from Ashkelon (average 1 in Table 56) with Göllü Dag A (Kömürcii). This is underlined by comparing Table 56 and 57. This comparison also shows the similarity of the Nenezi Dag and Kayirli Village sources, but underlines the correlation with Nenezi Dag. The obsidian sources of Central Anatolia (Cappadocia) are ca. 800 km from Ashkelon. Their representation in Ashkelon is striking evidence for long-distance connections in this period. It is also striking in terms of obsidian distribution that the Eastern Anatolian sources, particularly the important Nemrut Dag peralkaline obsidians, apparently reached the Palestinian area only in later periods, although they form an essential source for other Neolithic sites that include dated PPN localities in Eastern Anatolia, Mesopotamia, and Iran (Blackman 1984; Cauvin 1991; Pernicka et al. 1997; Chataigner et al. 1998). In finding confirmation of the exclusivity of Cappadocian obsidian in the early Neolithic of the Levant (Renfrew et al. 1966), we remain intrigued by what seems to be an early obsidian divide between the Cappadocian and the Lake Van distribution, a divide that seems to have been overcome only in later periods. 19.2. PUMICE A number of pumice pebbles, generally up to 3 cm in diameter and well rounded, were also found in the excavation. Although their exact use and significance are unknown, this was certainly a useful abrasive for any polishing purposes. Pumice lumps or pebbles have been reported from quite a number of prehistoric excavations from the Neolithic onwards (Faure 1971; Renfrew 1971). Huber et al. (2004) have analyzed a large number (286) of archaeologically stratified pumice samples from different excavation sites throughout the Eastern Mediterranean (Israel, Egypt, Turkey, Crete). In this study, concentrating on Late Bronze Age and younger contexts (including post-Neolithic levels at Ashkelon), the vast majority of samples (214 of 286) could be related to the Minoan Santorini eruption. Other presumed sources are Nisyros, Giali, Kos, pre-Minoan Santorini, and unknown provenances. Huber et al. (2004) use a set of 22 trace elements (plus the three major elements Fe, Na, and K) for the characterization of pumice composition. Comparison with the known major pumice-producing eruptions in the Eastern Mediterranean has established similarities that are used for specific correlations. Although the match of 25 elements represents quite a robust base for correlation, it is inherent in all compositional provenance correlations that we can only establish similarity between the unknown sample and a possible source. It always remains to be shown that no other source has a similar composition. Moreover, for pumice characterization one should ideally be able to combine pétrographie characteristics, bulk composition, and glass composition for major elements and trace elements respectively. As is apparent from our Tables 58 and 59, we have achieved only the first steps of such a full characterization. Pumice is often transported over long distances by the action of sea currents. If washed ashore in greater quantity following a major eruption, it can even form significant beach deposits. One prominent example from the Levant has been reported by Pfannenstiel (1952) and Picard (1955) from Quaternary deposits near Tel Aviv. Keller (1971) has analyzed the mineralogical composition of a pumice sample from Tel Aviv, received from the late Prof. Picard.

Several authors have concentrated on the analysis of sea-borne pumice found in paleo-beach deposits along Eastern Mediterranean coastlines (Keller 1971; 1980; Schneider 1974; Sotiriadis and Schneider 1974; Fornaseri et al. 1975; and, in particular, Francaviglia 1990). In general, the appearance of larger quantities of sea-borne pumice on more distant shores is a direct follow-up of an eruption. However, minor quantities of pumice can be involved in sea transport by erosion of older coastal deposits of a volcano. A quite instructive example is the recent distribution of Santorini and Lipari pumice on distant beaches of the Mediterranean, triggered by pumice dumping during quarrying activity. If found outside its natural occurrence, pumice can also be an indicator of long-distance transport by man, in a similar manner to obsidian. The rounded shape of the pumices at Ashkelon is indicative of a sea-borne origin and the pumice was presumably collected from ancient beach deposits. These original deposits, however, are unknown and may well lie below the present-day sea level, since the sea level at 8000 BP was apparently about 14 m lower than today's (see Chapter 3). Unlikely, but not absolutely excluded, is a scenario in which pumice was collected along the obsidian transport routes from Central Anatolia to Israel. This would multiply the possible source areas and source eruptions. As for obsidian, chemical composition and petrography, particularly the mineral content, define the petrological affinity of pumices, in favorable cases matching the compositional identity with a possible source. But pumice, unlike obsidian, can show a much wider variation in chemical composition even during a given eruption. Most eruptions are of Plinian style, resulting in the distribution of large quantities of pumice. Our analytical approach included firstly a mineral separation to establish the phenocryst content of the erupting magma. Pumices were crushed and separated with heavy liquids and magnetic fractionation. Several fractions according to specific weight and magnetic properties were thus obtained for microscopic determination. Where enough material was available (after removing the iron-oxide-stained alteration rind), whole rock XRF analysis was performed (Table 58). Our results indicate that the ten pumice samples received for analysis all belong to the calc- alkaline or volcanic-arc type petrogenetic clan. This is shown, for instance, by the predominant hypersthene-plagioclase phenocryst assemblage (Table 59). For the Eastern Mediterranean, the calc-alkaline or volcanic-arc type most likely originates in the volcanic islands of the Hellenic arc (Keller 1982). We should also consider submarine eruptions from known or unknown centers, which can produce large quantities of pumice that may be transported ashore. Theoretically, the Aeolian island arc (Southern Tyrrhenian Sea) could also come into consideration as a calc-alkaline or volcanic- arc type source, but the distance and the complex sea-current paths make them less likely sources for Eastern Mediterranean deposits. Sources like Pantelleria, Etna, or the Campanian/Napolitanean volcanoes are excluded by the mineral assemblage and composition. In theory, the Central Anatolian and part of the Eastern Anatolian volcanoes are additional possible sources; however, these centers are far from the sea and it is difficult to envisage a geological process by which their products could have reached the Mediterranean to form secondary deposits. As a general observation, it must be emphasized that, unlike the restricted number of natural obsidian occurrences, the number of possible pumice sources is very high. For Santorini, for instance, Druitt et al. (1999) refer to twelve major Plinian eruption cycles in the last 300 ka, several of them with more than one pumice unit. Many more smaller eruptions occurred between the major cycles (Vespa et al. 2006). Among the ten pumice samples of PPNC Ashkelon, three petrographic-geochemical groups can be distinguished (Tables 58, 59). The main group (A) is represented by seven pumices and is 277</page><page sequence="277">CHAPTER NINETEEN characterized by its phenocryst content dominated by hypersthene and plagioclase, with hornblende as accessory phase. Chemical composition is a high-K calc-alkaline dacite to rhyolite. Two bulk- rock analyses (samples 6489 and 3933) indicate a constant composition and the two splits for separate analyses of sample 3933 show the possible analytical variation. Of the known eruptions from volcanoes in the Hellenic arc, Santorini and Nisyros are theoretical candidates. From the large chemical data sets available for both islands (Rehren 1988; Keller 1996; Druitt et al. 1999; Vanderkluysen et al. 2005; Vespa et al. 2006), it appears that at the level of Si02 of pumice Type A (69-70%), Santorini has a tendency for higher Na20 and higher Na20/ K20, and in particular lower Ba. This Ba spike of samples 6489 and 3933 (with values of 770-780 ppm) contrasts with all Santorini pumices, rarely exceeding 500 ppm Ba for comparable compositions, but could be indicative of a provenance in Nisyros. In addition to two caldera-forming eruptions, Nisyros experienced a whole series of Plinian eruptions postdating the 161 ka Kos Plateau Tuff (see below). With the restrictions cited above, no more detailed correlations can be proposed without time control, distribution and additional data for the unknowns and their possible source. The two pumice samples forming group B are chemically characterized by high-silica rhyolite. Both samples are phenocryst-poor. Their heavy mineral concentrate is dominated by a hornblende- hypersthene association. This is reminiscent of the pumice sample from Tel Aviv (Pfannenstiel 1952; Picard 1955; Keller 1971), for which to our knowledge no chemical data are available. The last group (C) is formed by one piece (sample 618) that aroused our special interest because it is in every aspect a typical Kos Plateau Tuff (KPT) pumice (Keller 1971; Stadlbauer 1988; Keller et al. 1990; Allen et al. 1999). The ignimbritic KPT eruption is the largest Quaternary explosive event in the Eastern Mediterranean, or one of the largest. The fibrous-silky rhyolitic pumice of the KPT eruption is highly distinctive by virtue of its biotite phenocrysts and its large rounded quartz and feldspar crystals 5-10 mm in diameter. Sample 618 shows all these characteristic features, and mineral separation and chemical analysis confirm the correlation unambiguously. The KPT eruption is dated at 161 ka BP (Smith et al. 1996) and primary deposits are known from many islands in the Dodecanese (Keller et al. 1990; Allen et al. 1999). Presumably sea-borne Kos pumice has been indicated on the basis of trace element spectra by Huber et al. (2004) in several archaeological sites of the Levant, including one unstratified piece from Ashkelon. 19.3. DISCUSSION The PPNC occupies the first half of the eighth millennium BP, ca. 8100-7600 (Chapter 2). The PPNC site of Ashkelon was well connected with long-distance exchange networks. These include obsidian, pumice, shells from the Red Sea, flint from the Negev, and stone bracelets, some possibly originating from Jordan. The ten obsidian artifacts analyzed in this study come from the Central Anatolian sources of Göllii Dag (in particular Golili Dag A) and Nenezi Dag. This seems to us the earliest securely dated example from Nenezi Dag in the PPN of the Levant. Pumice of likely Aegean origin, but possibly collected from Mediterranean paleo-beaches, is represented by three compositional groups of different parenthood. One piece of pumice is distinctively Kos ignimbrite. Such widespread connections, as indicated by the obsidian trade and possibly by the pumice distribution, are not typical of marginal isolated communities, but are characteristic of pastoralism (Khazanov 1994). They indicate that the inhabitants of Ashkelon were involved with trade in rare and exotic artifacts. 278</page><page sequence="278">PART VI: DISCUSSION</page><page sequence="279">CHAPTER 20 THE RISE OF PASTORALISM IN THE SOUTHERN COASTAL PLAIN OF THE LEVANT Yosef Garfinkel and Doron Dag In the previous chapters of this report, various aspects of the PPNC site of Ashkelon were presented and analyzed. Here, in the final discussion, we will concentrate on what we see as the major contribution of the site to the larger developments that took place during the later part of the Neolithic period. As we shall see, Ashkelon is fundamentally different from the Neolithic sites that predate it, but it has many similarities to PN sites in the coastal plain that postdate it. Thus, the site represents a new subsistence strategy that developed in marginal regions of the Near East during the eighth millennium BP: the rise of pastoralism. 20.1. COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF NEOLITHIC SETTLEMENT TYPES In order to evaluate the site of Ashkelon the general picture of Neolithic settlement types should be examined. The first part of the Neolithic period in the Near East (PPNA-B) dates from approximately the tenth to the eighth millennium BP. This phase witnessed the development of two contemporary subsistence systems: A. PERMANENT MEDITERRANEAN VILLAGES In the more favourable climatic zones, the Neolithic revolution took place and farming communities flourished. Elaborate dwelling units were constructed, at first rounded in shape, with rectangular architecture developing later. Rounded architecture can be clearly seen at every PPNA village site, such as Jericho (Kenyon 1981), Netiv Hagdud (Bar- Yosef and Gopher 1997), Hatoula (Lechevallier and Ronen 1994), Gilgal (Noy 1989), and Gesher (Garfinkel 1990). Rectangular architecture with plaster floors is known from PPNB village sites, like Jericho (Kenyon 1981), Yiftahel (Garfinkel 1987a), Beisamoun (Lechevallier 1978), 'Ain Ghazal (Rollefson et al. 1989; 1991; 1993), and many others. Later, rectangular architecture is known from the PPNC site of ' Atlit Yam (Galili et al. 1993; 2002), which is contemporary with Ashkelon. The economy of these communities was based mainly on the cultivation of cereals and legumes and the hunting of gazelles, as well as a gradual increase in the exploitation of domesticated animal during the PPNB. A complex stratified society developed, rich in artistic expression and displaying various cultic and burial practices. The size of these settlements varied from 1 to 14 hectares. The most characteristic flint implements uncovered at these sites are arrowheads, sickle blades, and bifacial tools. The site of Ashkelon differs from the traditional Neolithic village site in the following: 1 Its location in the southern coastal plain, in an area outside the traditional geographic distribution of permanent Neolithic villages. 2 The absence of solid architecture, rounded or rectangular, for dwellings. 3 The site consists mainly of pits and hearths, unparalleled at other Neolithic village sites. 4 Bifacial tools appear in village sites in higher proportions. At Ashkelon there is a very low percentage of bifacial tools relative to arrowheads or sickle blades. 5 None of the heavy grinding implements, such as 281</page><page sequence="280">CHAPTER TWENTY mortars and slabs, that characterize village sites were found at Ashkelon. 6 Ashkelon is unique in the very high proportions of animal bones to flint. 7 At village sites the burials are primary ones. At Ashkelon the skeletal remains are fragmentary and disturbed, indicating secondary burial. 8 When large areas are excavated at village sites, a number of anthropomorphic or zoomorphic figurines are usually found. In the 800 m2 excavated at Ashkelon, no such figurines were found. Nor were other typical baked clay objects, such as tokens, uncovered. B. SEASONAL DESERT CAMPS In the arid zones of the Negev, Sinai, and Transjordan, a large number of PPNB sites have been identified and excavated over the years. These include, for example, Nahal Boqer (Noy and Cohen 1974), Nahal Divshon (Servello 1976), Abu Salem (Gopher et al. 1998), 'Ain Qadis (Gopher et al. 1995), Nahal Issaron (Goring-Morris and Gopher 1983), Wadi Tbeiq and Wadi Jibba (Bar-Yosef 1982), 'Ain Abu Nukhayla (Henry et al. 2003), and Dhuweila (Betts et al. 1998). The known sites are small (less than 0. 1 hectares) in size and the architecture, if any is found, consists only of rather small rounded huts exhibiting a condensed "beehive" settlement plan, with the rooms abutting each other. The flint assemblage contains a high percentage of arrowheads, while sickle blades, axes, and other bifacial flint tools are absent. These sites yielded remains of hunted animals (gazelle and ibex) rather than domesticated species (e.g. Bar-Yosef 1981a; 1984; Goring-Morris 1993; Bar-Yosef and Meadow 1995). Basically, the Paleolithic way of life was still practiced by these local desert populations. Ashkelon differs from these desert sites in every aspect: 1 No architecture was found; instead, the living accommodation was in pits. 2 It is an open settlement, with many hearths and pits. 3 The site size, according to Perrot's survey, is ca. 2 hectares, i.e. 40 times larger than most Neolithic desert sites. 4 The flint assemblage, as presented in Chapter 8, includes a large quantity of sickle blades, as well as a few bifacial tools. 5 The fauna includes domesticated sheep and goat, as well as cattle and pigs whose domestication status is not clear (see Chapter 15). Ashkelon differs radically from the traditional Neolithic settlements. On the one hand, it is not a village site with rounded or rectangular houses. On the other hand, it is not one of the hunting campsites known from the desert regions of the Negev, Sinai, and Transjordan. At Ashkelon the dwellings were probably in semi-subterranean huts, remains of which were discovered in the form of pits. Temporary shelters made of perishable materials, or simple mud-brick structures without stone foundations, have completely eroded over time. The lack of architecture implies that the site was used seasonally. In each episode of occupation of the site, hearths were constructed and pits dug in only part of the site. During occupations the sand was mixed with anthropogenic sediments and thus turned black, while light-colored sand accumulated naturally in unoccupied areas and between occupations. Thus, considering the nature of the human occupation, it seems quite clear that 2 hectares represent a total accumulation created over a stretch of time, probably several decades. Ashkelon represents a third type of human adaptation in addition to the Mediterranean sedentary villages or the nomadic hunters' camps. At Ashkelon, a combination of animal husbandry and a nomadic way of life is evident. This stage represents a mixed economy of hunted and domesticated animals. Later on, in the Neolithic and Late Chalcolithic periods, from ca. the eighth to sixth millennium BP, further fundamental developments took place. The village communities gradually increased in size and in social complexity, evolving over time to become city-states and kingdoms. In the arid zone the climatic conditions prevented large-scale cultivation of the land, and hunting and gathering were replaced by pastoralism. A pastoral economy focuses on the exploitation of domesticated animals, involving a nomadic way of life in accordance with the seasonal movements of 282</page><page sequence="281">THE RISE OF PASTORALISM IN THE SOUTHERN COASTAL PLAIN OF THE LEVANT the herds. When and how specialized pastoralism evolved in the ancient Near East is not clear, since very few archaeological data from the incipient stage have been gathered (Bar-Yosef 1987; Rosen 1988; Bar-Yosef and Khazanov 1992). Ashkelon, with its earlier dates, fits exactly into this "missing link", showing that pastoralism did not emerge as a full-scale phenomenon but developed in a slow process. 20.2. FLINT AND GROUND STONE TOOLS When three typological groups (arrowheads, sickle blades, and axes) in the flint assemblage are examined together, the sickles constitute ca. 75%. This very high proportion is indicative of the harvesting of large quantities of vegetation. The sandy and salty area around Ashkelon is not ideal for the cultivation of cereals, and moreover no heavy grinding implements, like mortars or grinding slabs, were found at the site. It thus seems that the sickles were not used for harvesting grain. What, then, were they used for? A nomadic way of life limits the amount of property one can own to a man-load. A sedentary way of life, however, eliminates this limitation and creates new means of property accumulation. The beginning of sedentary settlement is evident in the Natufian period. It was accompanied by a significant increase in the frequency of heavy ground stone utensils, with mortars, pestles, and querns appearing in the archaeological record in large quantities (Valla 1995; Wright 2000). They are often interpreted as the means for processing vegetal foods, and more specifically cereal grains (for example, Gopher and Orrelle 1995: 85). These heavy utensils remain important through the Neolithic period, appearing in large quantities at sites like PPNA and PPNB Jericho (Dorell 1983), Munhata (though lacking stratigraphie provenience, Gopher and Orrelle 1995), Abu Ghosh (Lechevallier 1978), and Sha'ar Hagolan (Garfinkel 1999d: 32-34), to name but a few. Sites lacking heavy ground stone tools are often interpreted as representing a nomadic and/or hunting-based way of life, as opposed to agriculture-based subsistence (Goring-Morris 1993), particularly when the lack of ground stones is correlated with a high frequency of arrowheads and total absence of sickle blades and bifacial tools (Bar-Yosef 1981a). The ground stone tool assemblage of Ashkelon is characterized by two groups of artifacts. On the one hand, there are small utilitarian objects, like percussors, handstones, bowls, and weights. On the other hand, decorative items such as bracelets are present in relatively large numbers. Missing from the assemblage are heavy ground stone tools: querns, grinding slabs, mortars, and pestles. The lack of such utensils in Ashkelon contrasts with to the presence of about 13% of sickle blades in the chipped stone assemblage. How are we to interpret this? Several hypotheses can be proposed: 1 Sickle blades, despite their gloss, did not serve for harvesting cereals for human consumption. Other possibilities for the use sickle blades are reaping reeds for construction or fuel, and harvesting cereals for animal consumption. 2 Cereals were harvested with the aid of sickle blades, but were processed without grinding, for example by roasting. 3 There is a spatial separation between the discard areas of the sickle blades and the grinding utensils. This possibility is the least likely, since the total area excavated by the old and the new excavation is very large. A lack of heavy grinding utensils combined with a plenitude of sickle blades is also observed in PN sites in the coastal plain. At Zikim no heavy tools were found and sickle blades comprise some 12.5% of the flint tools (Garfinkel et al. 2002), at Nizzanim sickle blades comprise about 8% of the flint and the stone objects include bowls and small grinding stones (Yeivin and Olami 1979, excluding unretouched blades and bladelets counted there with the tools), and at Giv'at Haparsa sickle blades comprise about 30% of the flint tools and stone tools, when described, include only small items (Olami et al. 1977). A consistent pattern emerges, in which sickle blades were used and heavy grinding utensils were not. In this respect the PN site of Lod is clearly beyond the boundaries of the phenomena. There, an abundance of heavy grinding equipment 283</page><page sequence="282">CHAPTER TWENTY was found, including grinding slabs and a mortar, comprising together about 22% of the ground stone assemblage (Blockman 1997). At PPNC Tel 'Ali, some 98 ground stone tools were found, including two large grinding slabs, small mortars, and pestles, while the rest are smaller handstones (Garfinkel 1992b: 60-62, Table 42). In the flint tool assemblage the sickle blades constitute ca. 31% (Garfinkel 1994). At PPNC ' Atlit Yam, a concentration of some 26,000 stored wheat grains was found, establishing the importance of cereals in the diet. Both heavy ground stone tools (grinding slabs and mortars) and sickle blades (23% of the flint tools) were found (Galili et al. 1993). At PPNC 'Ain Ghazal, most ground stone tools are small objects: handstones, bowls, weights, and bracelets. However from the 1996 season five querns and one mortar were reported (Rollefson and Kafafi 1994; 1995; 1996; 1997). The sickle blade frequency at 'Ain Ghazal is much lower, at 3.2% (see Table 30 above). 20.3. SPECIAL CHARACTERISTICS OF NEOLITHIC ASHKELON Ashkelon differs from other Neolithic sites in various aspects, which all indicate that the site functioned as a highly specialized meat processing site on the Mediterranean coast. This is evident from the following features: Concentration of hearths. Over 100 hearths were found in the new excavations, clearly indicating a specialized activity associated with fire. It is possible that the hearths were used for drying or smoking meat. Very large quantities of animal bones. Nearly 100,000 animal bone fragments were found in Ashkelon. At the end of the excavations, when all the finds were packed in large boxes, three boxes were needed for the flint, while twelve similar boxes were needed for the bones (in Neolithic excavations the proportion is usually the opposite - the volume of flint is four times larger). To quantify this observation, Table 60 presents the ratio of flint to diagnostic bones in various Neolithic sites. Without going into detail, it is clear that the ratio of flint to bones is lowest at Ashkelon. While in some sites 20, 70, or even 200 flint items were found for each bone, at Ashkelon only 4.5 flint items were found for each bone. These data clearly supports the definition of the quantity of animal bones at the site as very large. Elongated flint knives. A large assemblage of 58 elongated knives was found, the richest known collection of such items from a single site. The knives were apparently used for slaughtering animals and butchering meat. Salt. The location near the sea supplied the inhabitants with salt, an important meat- preservation agent. Numerous sickle blades but no heavy grinding tools. As discussed above, sickle blades are heavily represented at Ashkelon, indicating the harvesting of large quantities of vegetation. The sandy and salty area around the site is not ideal for the cultivation of cereals and no heavy grinding implements were found, indicating that the sickles were not used for harvesting grain. However, the sandy area near the sea is rich in shrubs and grasses, which may have been fuel for the drying and smoking of meat. This would explain another problem: the southern coastal plain is not rich in trees and suffers from a shortage of wood, and indeed no charcoal was found in the numerous hearths or occupation debris. 20.4. LONG-DISTANCE EXCHANGE NETWORKS Ashkelon was connected with several long-distance exchange networks. Imported items include obsidian from Anatolia, shells from the Red Sea, tabular flint from the Negev, and stone bracelets, some originating from Jordan. The appearance of obsidian in relatively large quantities should not be overlooked; this material is totally absent from typical PPNB desert sites like Nahal Hemar Cave, Nahal Issaron, Wadi Tbeiq, and Wadi Jibba. The widespread connections reflected at Ashkelon are not typical of marginal and isolated hunter-gatherer communities, but are characteristic 284</page><page sequence="283">THE RISE OF PASTORALISM IN THE SOUTHERN COASTAL PLAIN OF THE LEVANT Table 60.

They indicate that the inhabitants of Ashkelon were involved in the trade of rare and exotic artifacts. It seems quite possible that in such trade relationships, Ashkelon provided meat, Mediterranean seashells, and fish to sites further inland. 20.5. ANIMAL REPRESENTATION As analyzed by Hesse and Rookis in Chapter 15 of this report, the bone assemblage includes domesticated sheep and goats. Cattle and pigs also played an important role in the diet, but from their morphology they were not necessarily domesticated and may have been hunted from the wild. Whether or not the cattle and pigs were domesticated is crucial for understanding the process of pastoralism in the Levant. Since this question has not yet been answered, we will examine it from a different point of view: general changes of animal composition in the bone assemblage over time. It seems that three main phases of animal composition in Neolithic sites can be identified: 1 Before the introduction of domesticated animals, in PPNA sites and some of the PPNB sites as well, gazelle or ibex are the dominant species. 2 During the PPNB . domesticated goats appeared. In the Jordan Valley sites their percentage is higher, while in sites further to the west the percentage of domesticated goats is much lower. 3 During the PPNC and the Pottery Neolithic, the animal composition changed and two new species became more prominent: cattle and pig (Table 61). The Ashkelon bone assemblage is clearly related to the third category. Similar compositions of animal bones have been reported from Ziqim, Nizzanim, Qatif, and even the Chalcolithic site of Grar (Table 61 ). At Grar it is clear that the cattle are domesticated. Thus, although the cattle at Ashkelon are morphologically still wild, the site may well 285</page><page sequence="284">CHAPTER TWENTY Table 61.

When discussing the process of animal domestication, Horwitz (1989) suggested a model with the following four stages: "specialized hunting", "incipient domestication", "domestication", and "husbandry". Since the cattle and pigs of Ashkelon are morphologically wild, the site may represent either "specialized hunting" or "incipient domestication". In any case it is the first step toward actual domestication. Thus, Ashkelon presents a new subsistence strategy by which human developed a strong dependence on cattle exploitation. 20.6. THE RISE OF PASTORALISM The site of Ashkelon presents a new exploitation strategy for the semi-arid areas of the southern Levant. It is different from the traditional PPNB 286</page><page sequence="285">THE RISE OF PASTORALISM IN THE SOUTHERN COASTAL PLAIN OF THE LEVANT hunting campsites known from the desert regions of the Negev, Sinai, and Transjordan. It is basically an open settlement, with many hearths and pits, which are distributed over two hectares. The fauna include domesticated animals. This type of settlement is known in the southern coastal plain of the Levant in a number of sites dated to the second half of the eighth and the seventh millennia BP, like Giv'at Haparsa (Burian and Friedman 1961; Olami et al. 1977), Nizzanim (Yeivin and Olami 1979), Ziqim (Garfinkel et al. 2002), and Qatif (Epstein 1984). Two more Neolithic sites in the central coastal plain should probably be added to this list: Habashan Street in Tel Aviv (Kaplan and Ritter-Kaplan 1993) and Herzliya (Prausnitz et al. 1970). These sites postdate Ashkelon, being dated to the PN and later. Thus, Ashkelon marks the beginning of a new way of life that developed in the semi-arid zone of the southern coastal plain of the Levant during the early eighth millennium BP. This new survival strategy led to pastoralism, as clearly indicated by the domesticated animal bones of the later sites, like Qatif (Grigson 1995a). But do we have early pastoralism at PPNC Ashkelon and, if so, what kind and degree of pastoralism are represented here? We are confident that the inhabitants of Ashkelon were involved in the herding of sheep and goats. These two species form 47% of the main mammal bones uncovered at the site. The other two species are cattle (46%) and pigs (7%). Were the latter two the object of hunting or of controlled herding? The size of the cattle and pig bones rules out a confident classification as anatomically domestic. However, in the very first stage of domestication, whether of plants or animals, morphological changes have not yet taken place. It takes a good number of generations for genetic changes to have a clear impact on animal size and body morphology. Thus, the large size of the Ashkelon fauna, which resemble wild cattle and pigs, cannot in itself be taken as absolute evidence for non-domestication. To understand Ashkelon we need to consider two issues: whether the site was a permanent or a seasonal settlement, and whether the cattle and pigs were domesticated or wild. Different combinations of these two issues create four basic situations Table 62. The basic theoretical framework for settlement pattern and animal domestication at Neolithic Ashkelon. Domesticated Wild cattle cattle Permanent settlement A B Seasonal settlement |_C ļļ) (Table 62), and we will evaluate each in accordance with the data described above. A A permanent settlement with domesticated sheep, goats, cattle, and pigs. In this case, Ashkelon is a village site. This suits the domesticated pig, an animal that cannot move over long distances. However, the archaeological record of the site does not reveal clear indicators of permanent dwelling, like domestic architecture or heavy grinding facilities. B A permanent settlement with hunted cattle and pigs. While the large number of arrowheads accords with a hunting economy, the archaeological character of the site, as well as the hunter ecology, are incompatible with permanent settlement. Out of the four possibilities, this seems the least likely. C A seasonal settlement with domesticated sheep, goats, and cattle. In such a case we have pastoralism of these animals. The status in this economy of the pigs, which constitute 7% of the animal bones, is not clear. As pigs cannot move over large distances, their remains may represents marginal hunting. D A seasonal settlement with pastoralism of sheep and goats on the one hand and hunting of cattle and pigs on the other. This is a mixed economy, a transitional stage from a hunting to a pastoral economy. This scenario satisfactorily explains the lack of dwelling and heavy grinding facilities, together with the large number of arrowheads. It worth noting that in various eighth-millennium BP (post-PPNB) sites in eastern Jordan a similar mix of pastoralism and hunting has been reported (Baird et al. 1992; Betts et al. 1998). In the PPNB in this region, the main hunted animal was the gazelle. During the eighth millennium 287</page><page sequence="286">CHAPTER TWENTY BP sheep and goats were introduced, but hunted gazelle was still the dominant species in the sites. This situation is understood as a mixed economy of hunting side by side with small- scale pastoralism. As Ashkelon is situated in a different ecological region, the main hunted animals were not gazelles but cattle and pigs, which suit the marshy areas that characterize the coastal plain of Israel. Of the four possible situations just discussed, it seems that D is most compatible with the data currently available. In any case, since the sheep and goats at Ashkelon are domesticated, we have clear evidence of animal-keeping and thus some degree of pastoralism. Pastoralism, however, is a complex term, which can be used to describe various modes of life (see, for example, Clutton- Brock and Grigson 1984; Cribb 1984; 1991; Chang and Koster 1986; Bar-Yosef 1987; Zarins 1990; Bar-Yosef and Khazanov 1992; Köhler- Rollefson 1992; Grigson 1995a; Rosen 2002). If this is true for historical and recent traditional societies, the situation is much more complicated when dealing with a prehistoric society, at the very earliest stage of this way of life. Thus, the main question is what kind of pastoralism was practiced at Neolithic Ashkelon. In our view, Ashkelon represents pastoralism of sheep and goats heavily mixed with hunting of cattle and pigs, a similar scenario to that arising from other eighth-millennium BP sites in Transjordan. At this early stage we cannot talk about long-distance nomadic pastoralism, and the inhabitants of Ashkelon probably exploited a rather limited territory within the southern coastal plain and perhaps adjacent regions, like the northwestern Negev to the south, or the Judean lowlands to the north. The rather extensive data on long-distance exchange networks (obsidian, Red Sea shells, tabular flint, and stone bracelets from Jordan) indicate that the inhabitants of Ashkelon were not isolated, but maintained intensive connections with other regions. In this way they could obtain agricultural products from neighboring farming communities, which according to ethnographic observations is an essential supplementary feature of the way of life of pastoral nomads. Sheep and goats constitute nearly 50% of the animal bones, but by weight of meat comprise no more than 10% (Grigson 1995b). Thus, pastoralism was not the main meat source at the site and herding products apparently played only a supplementary role in the diet. As observed by Köhler-Rollefson (1997: 557), "to manage a confined goat population would have required a considerable amount of work on a daily basis and certainly much higher labor inputs than hunting". Thus, the energy needed for pastoralism is much higher than its relative contribution to the diet, raising the question of why hunter-gatherers bothered to herd animals at all. Herding apparently had the valuable advantages of providing an alternative in a bad year when stocks of wild game animals were low, and providing a mechanism for the accumulation of wealth. In this context the herding of sheep and goat in the peripheral and arid zones of the southern Levant started as a supplementary device to enhance economic and social stability. Only over millennia did herding completely replace hunting and full- scale pastoralism evolve. 288</page><page sequence="287">APPENDIX A LIST AND DESCRIPTION OF LOCI Yosef Garfinkel, Down Dag , and Anna Eirikh-Rose Locus No. Square Layer Description 1 Whole site I Topsoil, modern sand dune. 50 E/20 I Topsoil, modern sand dune. 51 E/20 IVb Dark clay below the topsoil. 52 E/20 VI Virgin soil, sterile husmas. 53 G/18 Combined with Wall 100. 54 E/20 IVb A circular installation, ca. 80 cm in diameter, built of stones placed directly on the husmas. 55 E/l 8 IVb A small circular hearth, ca. 50 cm in diameter and 16 cm deep, built of medium-sized burnt stones and burnt lumps of clay, red/orange in color.

Twelve microliths and four microburins were reported from Perrot's excavation (Perrot and Gopher 1996: 160). How are we to interpret this large number of microliths? Typological, spatial, and preservation condition analyses were applied here as analytical tools to resolve the problem. 1. TYPOLOGY The typology of the microliths is presented in Table 68. The majority of the items (ca. 80%) are backed bladelets, most of them fragmentary. Some of the items are backed and obliquely truncated, and some are arched backed. Other types include retouched bladelets, scalene bladelets, and a single lunate. Seven items, all backed and obliquely truncated, show some evidence of hafting. One has remains of a black adhesive, and six show change in color. If the latter cases derive from hafting, the items were hafted with the distal part protruding 5-10 mm from the haft. Only 13 items have some cortical cover on the dorsal face, covering 10-50% of the total surface. This indicating systematic production of bladelets, preferring the deliberate products of advanced stages of the reduction sequence. Another component of the microlith assemblage is ten items of microburin waste (Fig. 127:8-11). However, the small number of these items may point to an accidental origin. Typologically, the microliths form a more or less uniform group. The bulk of the material consists of backed bladelets, and many of them are also obliquely truncated or arched backed. Such a repertoire is appropriate to an Epi-Paleolithic assemblage (Bar-Yosef 1981b). Backing is not a common manner of retouch in the Ashkelon assemblage as a whole (only 8.5% of the retouched blades in the assemblage are backed), and thus the habitual backing of bladelets is foreign to the Neolithic component of the assemblage.

SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION This aspect has been presented in detail in Chapter 13, which dealt with various aspects of spatial distribution in the site. The basic conclusions were that the microliths are distributed more or less randomly in all contexts, found scattered on the surface and embedded in the recent sand as well as in Neolithic and post-Neolithic archaeological contexts. The frequencies of the microliths in the squares closest to Wall 100 were also examined; they were found to be much higher than those of other tools, raising the possibility that microliths were quarried with mud as construction material. 3. PRESERVATION CONDITION Most microliths are fragmentary: only 20 are complete (less than 5%), 166 are distal fragments, 59 are proximal fragments, and 215 are medial fragments. This is the most fragmentary tool type in the assemblage. While the fragmentary condition is partly due to the fact that bladelets are more delicate and tend to break, since in the waste only about 60% of bladelets are broken, an additional explanation is needed. All of the microliths are covered with various degrees of patina, in about 25% of cases to the extent that the raw material could not be identified. This far exceeds the patination of other types. Some of the patinated microliths are dull and slightly rolled. In addition, 40 items were burnt. All the indications are that the microliths suffered a greater degree of post-depositional damage and relocation than the rest of the assemblage, suggesting the possibility of secondary deposition. 4. CONCLUSIONS All of the criteria suggest that the microliths should be regarded as an Epi-Paleolithic component rather than part of the Neolithic assemblage. The only drawback of such an assumption is the abundance of microliths in all contexts. This seemingly even distribution of intrusive elements needs an explanation. If there were an Epi-Paleolithic site below the Neolithic occupation, a decrease of microlith numbers in the upper parts of the section would be expected. However, the more or less homogeneous distribution means that the microliths were deposited at the time of the Neolithic accumulation. This could have been carried out by either a human or a natural agent. In the first case, activities like quarrying material for mud bricks in an Epi-Paleolithic site could have transferred 309</page><page sequence="306">APPENDIX C microliths into the site. A similar explanation was suggested for the unusually high frequency of microliths in the PPNA site of Netiv Hagdud (Nadel 1997). A natural agent could be gravity, carrying material from an Epi-Paleolithic site, situated up the slope, into the Neolithic site. Our analysis suggests that both factors were at work. The assignment of the microlithic component to the Epi-Paleolithic industry raises the question of whether other components of the assemblage should be regarded as intrusive. In other Epi- Paleolithic sites, microliths are accompanied by distinctive items, such as carinated bladelet cores, thumbnail scrapers, and burins (Bar-Yosef 1981b). In the Ashkelon assemblage these components were found very rarely, in the case of burins and scrapers, or not at all, in the case of carinated bladelet cores. This suggests that only a small part of the Epi-Paleolithic assemblage was redeposited in the Neolithic layer. In conclusion, the microliths attest to the existence of a nearby Epi-Paleolithic site, which has either not yet been located or has completely eroded over time. It was one of many such sites known from the coastal plain of Israel (Burian and Friedman 1965; Bar-Yosef 1970a; 1970b; Barkai et al. 1995). LAYER ffl: LATE CHALCOLITHIC REMAINS Yosef Garfinkel This occupation phase consists of a few Late Chalcolithic pits (Fig. 128): Loc. 296. Asmall bell-shaped pit in Square G/15, dug through the Neolithic layer and into the virgin soil. It is 50 cm in diameter at the top and 70 cm at the base, and ca. 60 cm deep. The sediment is dark Fig. 128. Distribution or Late Chalcolithic remains. 310</page><page sequence="307">EARLIER AND LATER REMAINS (LAYERS V, III, AND II) Fig. 129. Section of Late Chalcolithic Pit 311. and sandy. The finds were mainly Late Chalcolithic potsherds and a broken grinding slab. Loc. 311. A large bell-shaped pit in Square G/14, its top below the recent sand layer and its base dug into the virgin soil. It is about 80 cm in diameter at the top and 130 cm at the base, and almost two meters deep (Fig. 129). The sediment is a dark and sandy. The finds were mainly Late Chalcolithic potsherds, some bones, and some charred olive pits. Loc. 355. A very deep (ca. 3.5 m deep) shaft dug through the Neolithic layer and deep into the virgin soil. It is ca. 1 m diameter and has straight walls. The fill is sandy and very similar to that of the certainly Late Chalcolithic pits, but no indicative finds were found in it. In addition, about ten typically Late Chalcolithic potsherds were found in Squares G/14 and G/15, in the topsoil Loc. 298 and in Neolithic layers 285, 312, 355 and 356 (Table 69). They reflect an additional activity area of the Late Chalcolithic period in the site. These rather poor remains probably represent the margins of the vast Late Chalcolithic and Early Bronze Age I site located nearby (Brandl and Gophna 1993; Baumgarten 1996; Braun and Gophna 1996; Golani 1997; Khalaily and Wallach Table 69.

Our part of this large site was designated "Ashkelon Afridar Area L" (see "Discussion" below). THE FINDS Very few finds were recovered (Table 69). These included 85 potsherds, four stone vessels, and four sea shells. As the site sediment was all sieved, the pottery includes many small sherds, 1-2 cm in size. The larger items are thick sherds with rough temper, sometimes poorly fired. There were only seven indicative Late Chalcolithic items, all presented in Fig. 130. These include one small V-shaped bowl (No. 1), two medium-sized V-shaped bowls (Nos. 2-3), two krater fragments with thumb-impressed rim 312</page><page sequence="309">EARLIER AND LATER REMAINS (LAYERS V, III, AND II) Fig. 131. Late Chalcolithic stone artifacts from Pit 296: 1 handstone; 2 kurkar slab; 3 quern. decorated with red paint (Nos. 4-5), one cornet base (No. 6) and two fragments of a small jar (No. 7). In Pit 296 three ground stone tools were found: one fragment of a large discoid handstone with signs of polish, one fragment of a quern, and one broken triangular slab (Fig. 131). All three are made on kurkar slabs. All are large and massive, compared to the tools of the Neolithic layer. In Pit 311 an additional small fragment of a kurkar slab was found. Four Mediterranean sea shells were found in Pit 3 1 1 , all naturally perforated Glycimeris valves. Although they are not worked, the concentration of perforated items is indicative of intentional collection. DISCUSSION Given the large Early Bronze Age I occupation reported in the Ashkelon AMdar area, it seemed at first that our site was part of this larger phenomenon. However, our assemblage, although small and mostly containing undiagnostic potsherds, contains a cornet base, fragments of V-shaped bowls, and two kraters with thumb-impressed rim. These pottery shapes are typical of the Late Chalcolithic period and cannot be attributed to the Early Bronze Age I. Some radiometric dates from the excavations at Ashkelon Afridar Area E, located 400-500 m south of our excavations, have recently been published (Golani and Segal 2002). The dates 313</page><page sequence="310">APPENDIX C fall within 3900-3500 BCE calibrated. These dates are very early for the Early Bronze Age, but are perfectly in accord with the traditional chronology of the Chalcolithic. When the artifacts found in Area E are examined, they are seen to include typical Late Chalcolithic pottery (Golani and Segal 2002: Fig. 8:5-11) as well as a basalt bowl typical of the period (Golani and Segal 2002: Fig. 8:3). Furthermore, in the excavations conducted by Khalaily and Wallach (1998), three stratigraphie phases were noted. The upper two were related to the Early Bronze Age I, while the lowest constituted eight ash pits contained V-shaped bowls and a possible dating to the Late Chalcolithic period was mentioned (Khalaily and Wallach 1998: 101). Additional support for a Late Chalcolithic presence at Ashkelon has been expressed by other excavators of the site (Braun 2001b: 1281): "Despite these new determinations, R. Gophna and myself, the excavators of Afridar, Area G, are convinced that such an early date for the beginning of EB I is highly improbable and we offer the following explanation for the data. The artifact assemblages of Areas E and G both contain fossiles directeurs (e.g. cornets and fenestrated, pedestalled basalt vessels with incised cross-hatching) of the Chalcolithic period together with EB I diagnostic material. In the case of Area G, we believe that the site was occupied earlier than Stratum 2 (the first phase of EB I), from which the l4C samples come." Thus, our Level III pits are the first clear evidence of a Late Chalcolithic occupation in Ashkelon, undisturbed by the later, more massive Early Bronze I settlement. The date of these remains is probably 3900-3800 BCE calibrated, like the early dates obtained from Area E and erroneously related to the Early Bronze Age. LAYER II: HELLENISTIC TO ISLAMIC REMAINS Barbara Johnson The post-Chalcolithic finds come from the surface, pits, and mixed contexts. The distribution of pits associated with such finds (designated Layer II) is presented in Fig. 1 32. A sample of 3097 potsherds, about half of the material, was examined and identified. Having been excavated according to a small 1 by 1 m grid and sieved, the assemblage mostly comprises miniscule body sherds. Table 70 presents the distribution of types. The bulk of the material is from the Late Roman period, mostly Gaza jar (71%) and cooking pot sherds, some of them ribbed. Most of the material is of local production and only a minority is imported. The lack of small kitchenware items (bowls, cups, plates, etc.) is indicative of the non-residential nature of the occupation. A few sherds predating the Late Roman period were found; they form less than 1 % of the assemblage and consist mainly of amphorae and bowls. Sherds postdating the Late Roman period were also found; these too form less than 1% of the assemblage and comprise mainly Umayyad "White Ware" and glazed Islamic sherds.
