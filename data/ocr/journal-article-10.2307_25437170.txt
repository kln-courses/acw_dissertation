<plain_text><page sequence="1">Normal ileostomy output: close relation to body size What determines the normal ileostomy output for an individual is unknown, but we have suspected for some time that it is related to the size of the patient.1 Such a finding would be of importance to clinicians who manage patients with ileostomies but would also have important implications in gastrointestinal physiology. For this reason we studied the relation between various anthropomorphic measurements and the output of ileostomy fluid from a group of healthy patients with well-functioning ileostomies. Patients, methods, and results We studied 18 healthy patients (10 women, 8 men) aged from 27 to 71 years (mean 50-4 years). Each had had total proctocolectomy for histologically proved ulcerative colitis at least one year previously. None had had an ileal resection greater than 10 cm. The patients were studied out of hospital during their usual daily routine and none were taking any medication. They / were asked to collect five consecutive full 24-hour samples of ileostomy fluid, each in a separate polyethylene container supplied to them ; to eat their normal diet with the exception of cooked cabbage and prune juice2; and not to disturb their usual routine. Containers were collected each day from their homes. The weight of each daily sample was measured on arrival in the laboratory and the daily ileostomy volume was expressed as the mean measurement for the five consecutive daily collections. The physical characteristics and chemistry of the ileostomy fluid were also measured in each sample. In all collections they were within the published normal range.1 At the end of the study the height and weight of the patients were measured</page><page sequence="2">832 BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL 6 OCTOBER 1979 and the thickness of the mid-biceps, mid-triceps, and subscapular skinfolds were measured three times each with a Holtain skinfold calliper. Body density was calculated from the mean of the three measurements at each site by the method described by Durnin and Womersley.3 Body fat was subse quently derived by Siri's equation,4 and the fat-free mass calculated by subtracting the weight of body fat from body weight. Total body nitrogen was measured by in-vivo neutron activation using a sealed tube neutron generator producing 14 MeV neutrons.5 The mean weight of ileostomy discharge for the whole group was 459 ?172 g/day (range 222 ?60 g/day to 861 ? 198 g/day). Each patient had small daily variations in the weight of discharge (mean coefficient of variation 18-9 %). The relation between the mean of the five daily collections of ileostomy fluid and body weight is shown in the figure. The regression equations, together with the standard error of the estimate, for the prediction of mean daily ileostomy output (IO) and the various anthropomorphic measure ments (that is, height (Ht), body weight (BW), fat-free mass (FFM), and total body nitrogen (TBN)) are : IO (g)=10-8 Ht (cm)-1280?116 r = 0-75 IO(g)=lM BW(kg)-240?57r = 0-95 IO (g)= 12-9 FFM (kg)-135?97 r = 0-84 IO (g) = 0-42 TBN (g)-171 ?78 r = 0-90 1000 900 800 2 700 | 600 0 500 | 400 1 300 -?T 200 o Q 100 0 ..... . ^-.-.-^ 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 Body weight ( kg ) Relation between daily ileostomy output and body weight. Comment The results show a close relation between the size of a patient and the ileostomy output. The relation is closest for body weight and the lean body mass (fat-free mass and total body nitrogen), but there is also a relation between height and the daily output of ileostomy fluid. According to these equations a so-called normal patient of 70 kg should have an average daily output from his ileostomy over five days of around 540 g (95% confidence limits are ?114g). These results put a new light on past and present studies of ileostomy function in health and disease. Probably they will also have important consequences for our understanding of gastrointestinal physiology.
