<plain_text><page sequence="1">MAIMONIDES AND KANT ON METAPHYSICS AND PIETY R. Z. FRIEDMAN I NT IS, TO BORROW ONE OF HIS OWN METAPHORS, the keystone of the modern defense of religion. This defense turns on the contention that religion is not to be understood in terms of its own metaphysical claims?the most notable being that God exists?for this claim, as well as the obvious counterclaim, cannot be demonstrated. The existence of God is an antinomy?a claim that theoretical reason (that is, metaphysics or theology) can neither prove nor disprove.1 Religion, however, can be, indeed must be defended, because of the claims that a completely dispassionate, even irreligious, reason must make consequent to an analysis of morality. If we understand the nature of duty, conscience, and the moral law, and the end or good to which the moral law obligates us, we will conclude, Kant argues, that we must accept the existence of God (and the immortality of the soul) as a postulate of practical reason.2 Kant's defense of re ligion rests on a strategy that aims to prove the limits of theoretical reason and the necessity of assuming the primacy of practical reason. Hume, of course, is the philosopher who Kant himself tells us is the force behind his defense of the skeptical critique of meta physics.3 In a less direct way, however, Spinoza is the thinker be K. 1 Immanuel Kant, Critique of Pure Reason, trans.

Having ignored religion's philosophical defense of itself and having disposed of re ligion's reliance on biblical prophecy or revelation, Spinoza argues that a religion shorn of its of intellectual, philosophical, and scientific claims has yet an immensely important role to play in social and political life.4 In a move the roots of which may be found in Hobbes,5 Spinoza contends that morality, the Golden Rule, practical excel lence, or, in a word, piety is the true purpose of the religious life and is indeed the goal of religion correctly understood.6 Spinoza understands piety in the spirit of Maimonides' under standing of moral virtue in the Guide of the Perplexed, that is, mo rality consists of rules of conduct, which are neither universal nor necessary.7 As does Maimonides, Spinoza sees moral rules as rel ative to time and place and, therefore, as inferior to knowledge claims which, if true, are necessarily and therefore universally true.8 For Spinoza, morality9 is rooted in the emotions of human beings and makes human beings subject to individual, social, and political an archy?to error and destructive behavior.10 These consequences can be avoided only by deploying rules of conduct and backing these rules with a system of reward and punishment. This in turn in themselves. Whether this is a rejection of Hume's skepticism or a confirmation of it is a matter of debate. 4 Benedict de Spinoza, A TheologicoPolitical Treatise, trans. R. H. M.

Working from moral rules, which are understood to be culturally and historically relative, Spinoza arrives at a God who is a morally necessary fiction. In contrast, Kant argues that the prin ciple of morality is a synthetic a priori principle, a principle that is universal and necessary.12 He then proceeds to argue that the high est (in the sense of complete) good which, he contends, is dictated by this law, requires human beings to hope for happiness in pro portion to their achievement of moral worthiness. This connection between nature and morality would not be possible and hope would be undermined unless it were assumed that God exists.13 Spinoza develops a moral reconstruction of religion in light of what he thinks to be true, that is, modern science, rational metaphysics; and also in light of what he thinks to be politically necessary, that is, a new liberal political order. Kant, on the other hand, develops a recon struction of the epistemological foundations of modern science and rational metaphysics to provide for a moral religion. This religion is metaphysically neutral but necessary from a practical point of view. Kant's move is uniquely modern. He is a metaphysical skeptic who begins with the moral experience of the human self (conscience) and proceeds from this subjective standpoint to a practical yet nec essary interpretation of "ultimate reality" as, in his view, human beings must think it to be: as encompassing freedom, the existence of God, and the immortality of the soul. Not only is Kant's view of great influence within the tradition of philosophy (Hegel and Kierkegaard are obvious inheritors of his position), but his moral 11 Spinoza, A TheologicoPolitical Treatise, 186-7; Tractatus Theologico Politicus, 224-5. 12 Immanuel Kant, Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals, published as The Moral Law: Kant's Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals, trans.

When Nietzsche unleashes his critique of this culture he singles out Kant for special mention.14 A critique of Kant and of the modern moral-religious culture which is his legacy is also to be found in Maimonides, Spinoza's medieval "coreligionist" in whom Spinoza finds an antagonist in matters philosophical and religious. Spinoza seeks to exclude re ligion from natural and metaphysical inquiry and assign it a solely moral function; Maimonides, on the other hand, is the defender of the view that religion is itself the source of a metaphysical tradition as well as a moral tradition. Furthermore, Maimonides contends that religion holds the metaphysical tradition to be more important than the moral tradition. The contrast with Kant becomes appar ent. Kant's modern defense of religion limits theoretical reason in the name of practical reason; Maimonides defends religion by in sisting that it is a source of metaphysical knowledge that can claim to be universally true. He deemphasizes the role of morality, which, he believes, results in principles that are historically and culturally contingent. Kant and Maimonides seem diametrically opposed to each other. Advancing this view, I encounter an immediate problem, namely that in the twentieth century the dominant interpretations of Mai monides have in fact seen him as an ally of Kant; they have seen both philosophers as seeking to develop a defense of religion along the lines of a metaphysical skepticism on the one hand and an em phasis on practice on the other. Leo Strauss is the central figure associated with this approach to Maimonides.15 Making extensive 14 Friedrich Nietzsche, Twilight of the Idols, published with The Anti Christ, trans. R. J. Hollingdale (Penguin Books, 1968), 68. Kant is, ac cording to Nietzsche, the "cunning Christian" who deprives this earthly world of reality and who insists that a moral world, which Nietzsche dis misses as no more than "a moral-optical illusion," is real. Kant is, Nietzsche tells the readers of Twilight, "the most deformed conceptual cripple there has ever been" (p. 66). 15 See Leo Strauss, "Persecution and the Art of Writing," and "The Literary Character of The Guide of the Perplexed," in Persecution and the Art of Writing (Glencoe, 111.

If understood esoterically these claims become, if I understand Strauss correctly, aspects of a political insight and strategy whose inspiration is to be found in Plato and Aristotle. According to this way of thinking, what are alleged to be metaphysical truths are really to be seen as beliefs made necessary by the political task in which the few who can lead the many teach the many what is necessary to allow them to be lead. Governance, in this view, not metaphysics, is the key to the Guide.17 Pursuing this line of interpretation, Shlomo Pines argues that Maimonides, like Kant, limits the theoretical to provide for the practical and emphasizes the desirability and superiority of practical over theoretical perfection.18 Pines argues that for Maimonides "the only positive knowledge of God of which man is capable is knowledge of the attributes of action," and that "this leads and 16 Strauss, "The Literary Character of the Guide" 60-78. 17 "What is the ultimate purpose of prophecy? Why is the human race dependent on prophets? The answer Maimonides gives to this ques tion, although not explicitly as such, says that man is by nature a political being and, in distinction to the rest of the living beings, he needs association with others by nature .... The prophet is the founder of a society that is directed to the proper perfection of men"; Strauss, "The Philosophical Grounding of the Law," 99. 18 Aviezer Ravitsky contends that the roots of the esoteric interpre tation of the Guide found in Strauss and Pines are to be found in the work of Samuel ibn Tibbon, a contemporary of Maimonides, who translated the Guide from Arabic to Hebrew. See his "Samuel ibn Tibbon and the Eso teric Character of the Guide of the Perplexed," AJS Review 6 (1981): 87 123. It may be the case that the roots of the practical interpretation of the esoteric lie in the work of the neo-Kantian philosopher Herman Cohen. "A religion's right to exist is derived from its concept of God," he writes. "And this concept must be constantly reaffirmed and perfected. This is particularly true of Judaism which, as a matter of principle, makes no distinction between religion and ethics. For the God of Judaism is the God of morality"; Reason and Hope: Selections from the Jewish Writings of Herman Cohen, trans. Eva Jospe (New York: W. W. Norton and Company, 1971), 45.</page><page sequence="6">778 R. Z. FRIEDMAN ought to lead to a sort of political activity that is the highest per fection of man. The practical way of life, the bios praktikos, is su perior to the theoretical." Furthermore, Pines argues that this Maimonidean turn to the practical is echoed in the work of Immanuel Kant: Both Kant and Maimonides, the first outspokenly and the second partly by implication, have tried to show that because of the limitations of his mind man is incapable of intellecting some of the main objects of the traditional metaphysics. There may be a correlation between this fact and the tendency of both philosophers ... to accord primacy to the life of action.19 I propose a different interpretation in this paper. Perhaps be cause I come to the Maimonidean defense of religion by way of the Kantian rather than the other way around, the matter looks very different to me. I see the two philosophers not as allies but as antagonists. While Kant and Maimonides develop systematic and unified positions out of many of the same philosophical pieces (for example, the difference between practical and theoretical reason, and between moral virtue and intellectual virtue; the critical role played by knowledge and the status of human knowledge; the in terpretation of the nature of religion and the desire to defend re ligion), they arrive at quite different conclusions. Kant attempts to resolve the problems he believes afflict phi losophy by denying the possibility of knowledge of things as they are, as noumena, and allowing only for knowledge of things as they appear to be, as phenomena. Kant attempts to terminate meta physics and redirect philosophy towards epistemology. He then turns to the will, links freedom of the will to a synthetic a priori principle, and this, in turn, to religion. Kant is a defender of piety against the claims of knowledge and metaphysics. The highest good, he informs his readers, is moral virtue or the good will. Philosophy leads us to this conclusion, he argues, and religion, if understood 19 Shlomo Pines, "The Limitations of Human Knowledge according to Al-Farabi, ibn Bajja, and Maimonides," in Studies in Medieval Jewish His tory and Literature, ed.

Buijs (Notre Dame, Indiana: University of Notre Dame Press, 1988), 111.</page><page sequence="7">METAPHYSICS AND PIETY 779 properly, advances and defends this very view.20 In contrast, Maimonides is a defender of knowledge and metaphysics against the claims of piety. Knowledge of that which is most real, that is, God, is the content of human perfection. It is intellectual virtue that is the highest good. Philosophy, Maimonides argues, leads us to this conclusion, and the Bible and the prophets advance and defend this very view. Simply put, where Kant champions piety against metaphysics, Maimonides champions metaphysics against piety. By denying a positive connection between Maimonides and Kant, however, I am not seeking to terminate a fruitful philosophical discussion. It seems to me that philosophers who speak to their opponents can provide a more interesting philosophical discussion than those who speak to their allies. The critiques the Maimonidean and Kantian positions direct at each other provide a philosophical discussion of great value, especially at a time when thinkers of various stripes are reconsidering the development and value of modern thought. It is this systematic discussion rather than an historical inquiry that is the subject of this paper. The format of my paper is straightforward. In section II, I consider Maimonides' position, specifically its view on the existence of God. In section III, I distinguish Maimonides' position from Kant's, specifically with regard the problems associated with skep ticism and negative theology. Section IV develops Maimonides' in terpretation of the Book of Job, which underscores Maimonides' views on the dangers of a purely practical interpretation of human existence. Section V is devoted to a Maimonidean critique of Kant and a Kantian reply. Section VI provides a conclusion. II Maimonides presents the Guide as an attempt "to explain the meanings of certain terms occurring in books of prophecy" (l.Introduction, p. 5). He embarks on this task, I believe, in order to lay bare the metaphysical dimension of prophecy. He does this, he tells the readers of the Guide, to address the needs of his student, Reb Joseph, and those who, like him, are both learned in the Law 20 Kant, Critique of Practical Reason, 132.</page><page sequence="8">780 R. Z. FRIEDMAN and yet eager to expand their intellectual horizons. These are indi viduals who, Maimonides fears, might be inclined to pursue phil osophy and science at the expense of the Bible and the Law (Epistle Dedicatory, pp. 3-4). They must be made to see that while Law and practice are certainly one dimension of the Bible, they are not the highest dimension. The purpose of the Guide, I believe, is to argue that the key to human life and to the Bible is not goodness, moral virtue, or piety, but truth or knowledge. The Guide is not a skeptical rejection of knowledge and a defense of a life of action but, quite the contrary, a rejection of piety as an end sufficient unto itself and a defense of the view that human perfection consists in the intel lectual apprehension of the highest reality, or God. As Maimonides sees it, the difference between the Bible and the teachings of the philosophers is that the former argues that the world is created and sustained by God while the latter argue that the world is eternal and needs nothing but itself to exist. The con frontation Maimonides sees is between two metaphysical positions, and is, in his view, won by the Bible. It is won, furthermore, on the very presuppositions upon which the philosophers themselves rely. Maimonides' proof for the existence of God begins in earnest in the Introduction to Part 2 of the Guide where he sets out twenty six premises "needed for establishing the existence of the deity" (p. 235). In 2.1 he sets out four arguments clearly designed to dem onstrate the existence of God (pp. 243-52).21 The first argument is based on the twenty-fifth premise, in which Maimonides observes that according to Aristotle "matter does not move itself." For Mai monides this is "the capital premise calling for an inquiry concerning the existence of the Prime Mover" (2.1, p. 239). The process of things passing from generation to corruption is proof of movement in the world, and this movement can be traced to proximate movers and 21 A thorough account of these proofs is to be found in William Lane Craig, The Cosmological Argument from Plato to Leibniz (London: The Mac millan Press, 1980), 131-57. Harry Wolfson provides a discussion of Mai monides' proofs with attention to the role played by the cosmological argument and the absence of both a teleological and an ontological argu ment in "Notes on Proofs of the Existence of God in Jewish Philosophy," in Studies in the History of Philosophy and Religion, vol. 2, ed. Isadore Twersky and George H. Williams (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1977), 561-82.</page><page sequence="9">METAPHYSICS AND PIETY 781 this in turn to the movement of "the fifth body" (2.1, p. 243). The movement of this body is also in need of explanation. Maimonides finds the explanation in an entity which must be understood to be separate from the heavenly bodies and itself not a body or a force in a body, but a source of motion which is itself not moved. This is the first cause, and Maimonides identifies it with "the deity may His name be sublime" (2.1, p. 246). The second argument is also based on Aristotle's interpretation of motion. The argument turns on the contention that the existence of a composite thing of which one element is understood to exist separately from the other implies that the other element must itself exist outside of the thing. Now proximate movers are both movers and themselves moved, which if understood in terms of the premise, implies that the element of being a source of movement can exist separately from the element of being moved. Maimonides concludes, without stating, but presumably drawing upon, the contention that an infinite regress of movers is impossible, that "there must exist a mover that is not moved at all; this is the first mover" (2.1, p. 247). Let us set aside the third argument for the moment. The fourth argument, which like the others is "philosophic," turns on the Aris totelian observation that "things are in potency and pass into ac tuality." Again there may be intermediate causes which help to explain this process, but "this series of causes or factors cannot continue to infinity," and hence "one must come to something that causes the passage from potentiality to actuality, that is perpetually existent in one and the same state, and in which there is no poten tiality at all." This entity is, Maimonides concludes, the deity (2.1, p. 249). The third argument turns on Aristotle's contention that there are existent things and the existence of these things is contingent. This implies, Maimonides reasons, that all the things that are in existence could possibly go out of existence, and so nothing would exist (2.1, p. 247). Maimonides implies that if this is possible not only might it happen, but it should already have happened, for he observes, Now we perceive things that are existent. In fact we ourselves are existent. Hence it follows necessarily, according to this speculation that if there are, as we perceive, existents subject to generation and corruption, there must be a certain existent that is not subject to generation and corruption. (2.1, p. 247)</page><page sequence="10">782 R. Z. FRIEDMAN We are forced to conclude, Maimonides believes, "that there is an existent that is necessary of existence in respect to its own essence." This is God (2.1, p. 248).22 Maimonides has already made use of the idea of God as a nec essarily existing entity in an earlier section of the Guide, namely 1.57. God's "existence is necessary," he writes. "His existence is identical with His essence and His true reality and His essence is His existence" (1.57, p. 132). Maimonides' purpose here is not to advance a demonstration of God's existence but to distinguish the way in which God can be said to exist. "He exists, but not through an existence other than His essence; and similarly He lives, but not through life; He is powerful, but not through power; He knows, but not through knowledge" (1.57, p. 132). In the following chapter Maimonides says, "I shall say that it has already been demonstrated that God, may He be honored and magnified, is existent of necessity and that there is no composition in Him, as we shall demonstrate, and that we are only able to ap prehend the fact that He is and cannot apprehend His quiddity." At this point in the text Shlomo Pines, the translator, adds the following note: The statements regarding God are considered in this sentence as al ready demonstrated and as to be demonstrated later. This inconsis tency, which may of course be explained away, cannot but strike the reader of this sentence. (1.58, p. 135) Is this an inconsistency the force of which is to allow the esoteric meaning of the work to surface through the exoteric, to allow the reader to conclude that Maimonides' metaphysical defense of God is really merely exoteric? Or is it a part of a larger esoteric strategy which will indicate to the well-attuned reader that God's existence 22 Kenneth Seeskin contends that this argument is intended to teach not that God exists but that only the existence that is said to be His is unique to Him. See Kenneth Seeskin, Jewish Philosophy in a Secular Age (Albany: State University of New York Press, 1990), 34. Negative theology, in Seeskin's view, is not a teaching that affirms a metaphysical view of any kind. "The positive contribution of negative theology is that the only content we can ascribe to our idea of God is moral" (p. 63). In his view, Maimonides' negative theology neutralizes metaphysics and provides for a turn to morality. Like Kant, he believes, Maimonides is a defender of moral religion.</page><page sequence="11">METAPHYSICS AND PIETY 783 is an issue for Maimonides which is solved in a way that places Maimonides closer to Kant than, let us say, to Aquinas?23 This is a rhetorical question in response to a textual innuendo. There is, as far as I can see, no inconsistency in Maimonides' pre sentation. He has not attempted at this point a demonstration of God's existence but only a demonstration of the way in which the existence of God is to be understood. The demonstration of God's existence is yet to come and of course we find it in Guide 2.1. Mai monides is a metaphysical thinker intent on proving the existence of God. Furthermore, Maimonides develops his proofs not by be ginning, as he thinks the Mutakallimun did, with creation and pro ceeding to the existence of God. Where the Mutakallimun simply start with a religious fact and use it to prove another religious fact, Maimonides attempts to prove the existence of God by turning to what he believes to be "clear and manifest," that is, motion, contin gent things, natural processes. Maimonides, in fact, follows those he thinks are his opponents, the philosophers, confident that he can make his case on their premises. Reading 1.57 on the necessary existence of God from the vantage point afforded by the third proof for the existence of God (2.1) allows us to conclude the following: Underlying the analysis of necessary existence is the conviction, which Maimonides believes can and will be demonstrated by argu ment, that the very existence of the thinker?an existence which, like the existence of all existing things, is contingent?must point to the existence of God as that entity for whom existence is not contingent but necessary. Contrary to Pines' view on the matter I find no inconsistency, strategic or unintended, in the development of Maimonides' position here.24 23 In Interpreting Maimonides: Studies in Methodology, Metaphysics, and Moral Philosophy, (Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 1990), Marvin Fox provides an extensive and acute discussion of the issues sur rounding the question of Maimonides' proofs for the existence of God in which he gives special attention to the role of contradiction in Maimonides' presentation. He acknowledges the extensive argumentation in the Guide that would lead its readers to conclude, as I do, that Maimonides does indeed argue the case for the existence of God. Fox contends, however, that there are instances in which Maimonides indicates that the whole issue of the existence of God may be simply beyond the limits of human knowledge. See Fox's discussion on pp. 17-21 and 83-90. 24 Perplexed by Pines' contention that "God is essentially unknowable," Norman Roth writes that this conclusion is "strange indeed; for Maimonides throughout his writings, not just in the Guide, argues precisely that the</page><page sequence="12">784 R. Z. FRIEDMAN Metaphysics is the highest human pursuit and intellectual virtue is the highest human achievement. Maimonides clearly develops and defends this position. Furthermore, he argues, this is the view of the Bible itself.25 The prophets, Maimonides contends, were in possession of metaphysical knowledge. Moreover, they arrived at this knowledge not because of the active intervention of God, but because they themselves were human beings of exceptional intel lectual achievement.26 Unlike Spinoza, who will argue that the prophets were unreflective and undisciplined human beings rooted in the imagination,27 Maimonides argues that they were rooted in the intellect, although they expressed their teachings through the use of the imagination (2.56, p. 369). The Bible is a book written in the language of man (1.26, p. 56), written to accommodate human beings at various levels of intellectual ability and achievement, from those who can imagine but not think to those who can think and do not need to imagine. Maimonides sees intellectual capability and achievement as pyramid-like, with the many who rely on the imag ination at the base and the few who can be said to be intellectually perfected at the top. The primacy of divine science will not be apparent to the mul titudes. Most human beings, Maimonides contends, lack the apprehension of God and the knowledge of God is the ultimate perfection and end goal of man!" Norman Roth, "Knowledge of God and God's Knowledge: Two Epistemological Problems in Maimonides," in Norman Roth, Maimonides: Essays and Texts, 850th Anniversary (Madison: The Hispanic Seminary of Medieval Studies, 1985), 78. 25 Maimonides identifies prophecy with intellectual achievement, and he locates the biblical prophets on eleven levels of such achievement, from the judge or political leader who acts in the spirit of the law to Abraham at the binding of Isaac. Above the eleventh level Maimonides places Moses, who, in terms of intellectual perfection, is in a class by himself (2.45, pp. 395-403). 26 It would be as possible for an uneducated individual to become a prophet, Maimonides states, as for "an ass or a frog" to do so. He is sympathetic to the "philosophical" view that "prophecy is a certain per fection in the nature of man" that becomes actual as the result of a certain training. He advances another view which, he says, "is the opinion of our Law and the foundation of our doctrine" and "is identical with the philo sophical opinion except in one thing": God may prevent the prophet from fulfilling his task. In both views, though, the prophet is understood to be responsible for his own intellectual achievement (2.32, p. 361). 27 Spinoza, TheologicoPolitical Treatise, 13-42; Tractatus Theologico Politicus, 59-87.</page><page sequence="13">METAPHYSICS AND PIETY 785 capacity and the discipline that the pursuit of knowledge requires. Those who do have these qualities are few in number. For the many, prophetic teaching will appear to be simply a practical guide to conduct, complete with inducements and explanations to facilitate submission to rules of practice. This is what Maimonides calls the "silver": a valuable teaching, a teaching concerned with "the welfare of human societies," and indeed, one without which human societies might not exist. This teaching, however, is not the "gold." The gold is "divine science" or metaphysics: that which "contains wisdom that is useful for beliefs concerned with the truth as it is" (1.Introduction, p. 12). The silver, or practical teaching, is the meaning imparted by the surface rendering of prophecy. The gold is that which is hidden in and behind the surface meaning in such a way that it does not disturb the surface meaning for those not able to "climb" past it, while at the same time providing various clues for those who will be able, like Reb Joseph, to aspire to know ledge of God. The Guide is the guide past the silver to the gold, past the prac tical to the metaphysical. The path requires the perfection of the intellect, and the maturity and responsibility not to reject the silver and with it those incapable of attaining anything more than a prac tical interpretation of life and the Bible. There can be no doubt, however, as to the relative value of the practical and the meta physical: "The internal meaning of the words of the Torah is a pearl whereas the external meaning of all parables is worth nothing," Maimonides unequivocally tells his readers (1.Introduction, p. 11). Ill This remarkable conclusion, so clear in its statement of the relative values of theoretical and practical matters, finds support in an equally remarkable and much studied interpretation of the expulsion of Adam and Eve from the Garden (1.2, p. 22-7).28 The accepted interpretation, Maimonides is quite aware, contends that 28 Pines considers Maimonides' account of the Garden and the tree of knowledge in the Forward to David Hartman, Maimonides: Torah and Philosophic Quest (Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society, 1976), pp. xi-xv.</page><page sequence="14">786 R. Z. FRIEDMAN Adam and Eve disobeyed the divine command not to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and were punished by actually receiving this knowledge and being sent into the world. The error of this widely accepted view, Maimonides argues, is that it interprets knowledge as a punishment. Knowledge could not be a punishment?unless, of course, one had a superior know ledge to start with, and this is exactly the approach that Maimonides advocates. Knowledge of good and evil, he contends, is an inferior form of knowledge. Knowledge of truth and falsity is superior to it. "In the beginning," prior to the sin of eating from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, Adam and Eve had true knowledge; that is, they were intellectually perfect, or simply, they knew God. After their sin they were deprived of this knowledge and forced to make do with what we would call moral or practical knowledge. Deprived of knowledge and truth, humankind wanders about in the world relying on directions, rules, and commands, which Maimonides believes "belong to the things generally accepted as known, not to those cognized by the intellect" (1.2, p. 24). For Maimonides, it would appear, moral rules are not only not metaphysically rooted, they are not even socially objective. They are, he tells us, simply useful guides to the orderly conduct of life. The primary task of human life is to return to the Garden, but this is not a return to innocence; it is a return to knowledge. The human task is not good ness but wisdom, and this is achieved through the intellectual ap prehension of the highest things. This interpretation is in stark contrast to the interpretation of the same biblical passage that Kant develops in "Radical Evil in Human Nature," the first chapter in Religion Within the Bounds of Reason Alone.29 For Kant the story is a moral allegory. He argues that it is an attempt to explain the human condition in the light of the discovery of the moral law. The story teaches us that evil is the human choice against the moral law. Evil is man's work, but this also means that for those "who despite a corrupted heart yet possess a good will, there remains hope of a return to the good from 29 Immanuel Kant, Religion Withing the Bounds of Reason Alone, trans.

Hudson (New York: Harper and Row, 1960), 37-9.</page><page sequence="15">METAPHYSICS AND PIETY 787 which [they have] strayed."30 Having willed himself to evil, man can yet will himself to good. This moral interpretation fits well with the broad direction of Kant's argument. As I have already pointed out, Kant argues that the skeptical critique of metaphysics makes knowledge of God impossible and that therefore neither theism nor atheism can make its case. For Kant this is not a tra gedy. As he understands it, human beings do not believe that knowledge, no matter how desirable, is the highest good?neither the supreme nor the complete good. Human beings believe, Kant thinks, that happiness is that end which is the most desirable, while virtue is that end which, while not desirable, is most worthy in itself of being achieved. Virtue is the supreme good; virtue conjoined with happiness is the complete good. The good is defined in practice, not in knowledge. The impossibility of human knowledge is there fore not a tragedy; indeed, for Kant it turns out to be an asset. It is an asset for two reasons. First, the metaphysical objects that Kant believes are of great interest to human beings?God, free dom, and immortality of the soul?are bracketed, not denied. Sec ond, against Humean skepticism Kant argues that we can know the world that appears to us; that causality expresses necessary con nection, not merely habitual association; that everything in nature, and man to the extent that he is a part of nature, must be seen to be subject to causal connections, to natural causality; and, therefore, that nothing in nature can be understood to be free. Natural de terminism pertains only to the phenomenal world, however, not to the noumenal. The door is left open for a defense of human freedom, not from a metaphysical point of view, but, perhaps, as a meta physical object demonstrated from a practical point of view. Free dom cannot describe the phenomenal world, for there the categories of the understanding are thought to rule and to insure natural de terminism. If freedom is to be provided for it must be given a status in relation to the noumenal world. In effect, Kant's critique of metaphysics blunts the metaphysical critique of God, freedom, and immortality, while allowing Kant to give full support to pietism, to the view that the highest end of man is moral virtue or perfection of the will. The law of the highest good is not the law of truth, intellectual perfection, ascent to the good, the intellectual love of 30 Kant, Religion Within the Bounds of Reason Alone, 39.</page><page sequence="16">788 R. Z. FRIEDMAN God; it is rather the Categorical Imperative, the Golden Rule, love of one's neighbor as oneself. This is the very position against which Maimonides argues. Maimonides contends that there is a God, that we can prove this fact, but that we cannot know God if by "know" we mean have an understanding of His essence. We can know that God is, but what we know of Him is through the world that is the result of His action. This is not skepticism, but Maimonides' negative theology. Maimonides does not claim that the world we see is phenomenal, and he does not claim that because we cannot know God we cannot affirm that He exists. Maimonides is not a skeptic in physics or in metaphysics. Negative theology is not the denial of metaphysical knowledge of God, but only a limit in the nature and extent of that knowledge.31 I have already quoted the passage on 1.58 in which Maimonides says "that we are only able to apprehend the fact that He is and cannot apprehend His quiddity" (p. 135). We can know that God exists. Philosophical demonstrations requiring us to ac cept this conclusion have been provided. But we cannot know the essence of God. Negative theology in Maimonides is the teaching 31 The philosophical def ensibility of negative theology per se is not the concern of this paper. My purpose is to refocus the interpretation of neg ative theology within a critique of the practical interpretation of the Guide understood as an esoteric book, and to argue that Kant, who is a defender of a practical interpretation and defense of religion, is an ally not of Mai monides but in fact of those Maimonides criticizes in the Guide. For a discussion of Maimonides' negative theology particularly sensitive to the text of the Guide and the philosophical and religious roots of this approach, see Zevi Disendruck, "Maimonides' Theory of the Negation of Privation," Proceedings of the American Academy for Jewish Research 6 (1934-35): 139-51; Alexander Altmann, "The Divine Attributes: An Historical Survey of the Jewish Discussion," Judaism 15 (1966): 40-60; and Harry Wolfson, "Maimonides on Negative Attributes," in Studies in the History of Philos ophy and Religion, vol. 2, 195-230.

It affirms metaphysical knowledge, it does not deny it.32 In Guide 1.54 Maimonides says, Know that the master of those who know, Moses our Master, peace be on him, made two requests and received an answer to both of them. One request consisted in his asking Him, may He be exalted, to let him know His essence and true reality. The second request. . . was that He should let him know His attributes. The answer to the first request is that "His essence cannot be grasped as it really is" (1.54, p. 123). Maimonides applies this negative an swer to the "I am that I am" of Exodus 3:14. "This notion," Mai monides says, "may be summarized and interpreted in the following way: the existent that is existent, or the necessarily existent" (1.63, p. 155). "I am that I am" is not the name of God, Maimonides cautions, if by name one means that which defines the thing as the very thing it is. The "I am that I am" defines God only to the extent that it allows that the essence of God involves the necessary exis tence of God. So in response to those who would ask Moses who had sent him to Egypt to bring the Israelites out of the land Moses would respond, in effect, with "He who is, sent me." But, Who is He who is? is a question that cannot be answered. Negative theology is a metaphysical teaching consistent with and perhaps motivated by Maimonides' continuing preoccupation with idolatry. Idolatry, for Maimonides, is a pseudo-intellectual defense of ignorance. It is the conviction that because human beings are said to be created in the image of God they are like God, that they know Him, and that their knowledge is like His. Idolatry is the denial of human ignorance, which in Maimonides' view is perhaps itself the greatest and most damaging instance of human ignorance. The second of Moses' two requests returns the discussion to Pines' point about attributes of action. Denied knowledge of God, Moses is also denied knowledge of His attributes, but he is told that God is to be known by His actions. What are His actions? They are not His miracles, if miracles are to be understood in the 32 Isaac Franck wrestles with this issue in "Maimonides and Aquinas on Man's Knowledge of God: A Twentieth Century Perspective," Review of Metaphysics 38 (1985): 591-615.</page><page sequence="18">790 R. Z. FRIEDMAN conventional sense of divine interventions in the natural order; for Maimonides does not believe in such interventions. They are not His revelations, for Maimonides, as I have noted, does not believe in the conventional view that revelation is God speaking to man. He believes, rather, that it is man knowing God. God's action is His creation, which is studied by physics, the teaching of the begin ning. I assume that this is what Maimonides wants to say when he quotes the passage from Genesis: "And God saw every thing that He had made, and, behold, it was very good." "I mean," says Mai monides, "that he [Moses] will apprehend their nature and the way they are mutually connected so that he will know how He governs them in general and in detail" (1.54, p. 124). Is Maimonides attempting to replace metaphysical attributes with practical attributes, as Pines suggests? I think not, for in the same paragraph Maimonides goes on to say, "The meaning here is not that He possesses moral qualities, but that He performs actions resembling the actions that in us proceed from moral qualities" (1.54, p. 124). In other words, not only do human beings not know the essence of God (only his existence) when they describe what God has done in His role as efficient, formal, and final cause of the world (1.67, p. 167), but their explanation is drawn from their ex perience of the world, from their way of construing the world, namely, in terms of morality or governance. Physics is the appli cation of a moral mentality to nature; physics is theory by way of moral analogy. To think otherwise is idolatry, and Maimonides reminds his readers further in the very same chapter (1.67) that the harsh punishment of visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children "only applies to the sin of idolatry in particular and not to any other sin" (1.54, p. 127). Maimonides' view may overlap with a form of skepticism, but clearly the point of his exercise is not to leave his readers with attributes of action as a replacement for metaphysical attributes. It is rather to caution them that while they may have no recourse to any attributes but those of action, these are not to be construed as metaphysical. Confusion on this point will encourage idolatry, the contention that one knows more than is humanly possible. The prophets are necessarily involved in an active life of teach ing this knowledge. Teaching, which is made possible by the per fection of the imaginative faculty, comes after intellectual perfection,</page><page sequence="19">METAPHYSICS AND PIETY 791 but is not higher than intellectual perfection. The prophets teach the value of orderly social conduct, obedience to law, and the im portance of moral virtue, to the multitudes; but they teach meta physics, or the ascent to God, to the few. This should not lead one to think, however, that the Bible is, as Spinoza and others will come to see it, a pedagogical tool by which the philosophical few direct and organize the lives of the uninformed, and perhaps uneducatable, multitudes. The gold is not the license, nor even the responsibility of the few, to deploy a teaching about what the many need to ensure their continued conformity even to an enlightened social and political order. This view holds that Maimonides' contention that the surface layer of the Bible hides a secret teaching that includes a physics and a metaphysics is itself only a teaching on the surface, hiding a secret teaching about the responsibilities of the few with regard to the many whose lives they must now order and direct. I see no reason to accept this view. The gold of the Guide is not that the silver is a lie, even a noble one. I would suggest that the gold is the first statement of Genesis: In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. God is and is the cause of the world. This is what the Bible teaches, and furthermore the Bible teaches that knowing this is the highest perfection of man. It is misleading, I think, to call the Guide an esoteric book.33 The Guide seeks to teach metaphysics, or divine science, to those who can learn it, while protecting those who cannot from being harmed by their failure. The Guide is a pedagogically careful book written by someone who believes that the Bible itself insists that teaching is a necessary part of human perfection.34 For Maimonides, 33 See Strauss, "The Literary Character of the Guide," 55. 34 Joseph Buijs argues against Strauss's contention that the Guide is a Jewish book and not a philosophical one: "There is ample evidence in the Guide to substantiate the interpretation that Maimonides does . . . intend to present a philosophy of religion, or specifically, a philosophy of Judaism"; "The Philosophical Character of Maimonides Guide?A Critique of Strauss' Interpretation," in Maimonides: A Collection of Critical Essays, 66-7. There is only one truth and it is open to all who would seek to know it and are endowed with the ability that knowing the truth requires, and are fortunate enough to belong to a tradition that encourages one to learn it. As Mai monides sees it, Judaism is such a tradition, and the Bible is exactly that book which seeks to teach this truth. God is not a Jewish God, but the teaching that He is and what it means that He is the core of Judaism.</page><page sequence="20">792 R. Z. FRIEDMAN knowledge is of a higher value than obedience, but obedience, ob viously enough, is preferable to the abandonment of the teachings of the Bible.35 In 1.32 Maimonides says the following: For if you stay your progress because of a dubious point; if you do not deceive yourself into believing that there is a demonstration with regard to matters that have not been demonstrated; if you do not hasten to reject and categorically to pronounce false any assertions whose contradictories have not been demonstrated; if finally, you do not aspire to apprehend that which you are unable to apprehend? you will have achieved human perfection and attained the rank of Rabbi Aquiba, peace be on him, who entered in peace and went out in peace, (p. 68) One might well say that the goal of the Guide is to produce an Aquiba. But Maimonides is equally concerned with avoiding an other possibility. Advising his reader, presumably the young Reb Joseph, Maimonides continues as follows: If, on the other hand, you aspire to apprehend things that are beyond your apprehension; or if you hasten to pronounce false, assertions the contradictories of which have not been demonstrated or that are pos sible, though very remotely so?you will have joined Elisha Aher. That is, you will not only not be perfect, but will be the most deficient among the deficient; and it shall so fall out that you will be overcome by imaginings and by an inclination toward things defective, evil and wicked?this resulting from the intellect's being preoccupied and its light's being extinguished. (1.32, pp. 68-9) This is an either/or: either Aquiba, a learned man actively involved in teaching and a leader of his people, a leader because he was a learned teacher; or Aher, "the other," or "outcast," who abandoned 35 I would caution here that I am not arguing that wisdom is not, as Maimonides understands it, a part of the prophetic teaching on human perfection, as opposed to obedience, which is. Maimonides believes that both wisdom and obedience are prescribed within the prophetic teaching on human perfection. In Maimonides: Torah and Philosophical Quest, Hartman?who understands the Straussian position as maintaining a clear, if not rigid, distinction between the philosophical-theoretical Maimonides and the religious-practical Maimonides?argues for an interpretation that would integrate the two within an idea of what Hartman takes to be the distinctive character of Maimonides' ideas of spiritual and social life. See chap. 4, "The Philosophic Religious Sensibility," pp. 139-86. Hartman, I think, is attempting to find an umbrella that encompasses the religious and the philosophical, or Torah and metaphysics. In this paper I argue that the Torah is a metaphysical position; for, if nothing else, it insists on the existence of God as a position without which nature would be unin telligible.</page><page sequence="21">METAPHYSICS AND PIETY 793 the Bible and the religious community. Any teacher who would aspire to instruct an Aquiba must take account of the possibility of producing an Aher. The teacher is responsible for both?hence the strategy, which Maimonides believes is to be found in the Bible and which he uses in the Guide, of presenting both an external and an internal teaching. The Guide is not an esoteric book; it does not seek to hide a teaching from one group in order to give a certain political edge to those whom the book addresses. It does, however, involve a dis tinction between those who can learn and those who cannot, between the few and the many. This does not mean that the many are to be managed by the few. I do not think that management is Mai monides' idea of political leadership, or at least political leadership as the prophets and Moses understood it. Maimonides acknowledges that the Judges were prophets and that individuals like David are to be understood as prophets, but he places this category of prophet at the lowest level in his eleven-step hierarchy of prophetic perfec tion (2.45, p. 396). The true prophet directs as an educator directs, that is, as a teacher. As I have noted above, Aquiba was such a leader, and of course Moses, known to Jews as "Rabbenu," or "our teacher," is the archetype of such a figure. To lead is not to manage but to teach. Furthermore, there is but one teaching, not two. There is not one for the few, teaching reason and truth, and another for the many, prescribing faith and obedience. There is only the first; the second is simply its foundation. The ascent begins in the achieve ment of moral discipline, but this discipline is not enough. If it were, Maimonides would do what Spinoza does: propose faith as a necessary feature of a moral view, in this way forestalling any aspiration to intellectual ascent on the part of the many, and in stall an anthropomorphic God as the authority and judge behind moral law.36 Unlike Spinoza, Maimonides does not provide a place for faith. The reason is obvious; faith, in Maimonides's view, points to obe dience without knowledge, while human perfection and biblical teaching point to knowledge. For instance, Maimonides insists that 36 Spinoza, A TheologicoPolitical Treatise, 186-7; Tractatus Theologico Politicus, 224-5.</page><page sequence="22">794 R. Z. FRIEDMAN everyone must be taught the deficiencies of thinking about God in anthropomorphic terms (1.35, p. 79-80). Everyone, he believes, must strive for a correct understanding of God. Even the prophet, even Moses, who Maimonides seems to think was more than a prophet, is involved in this task. Moses, the prophets, the multitudes, all stand on the same ladder to the same good. There is not only one God, in Maimonides' view; there is also only one method of ascent to Him, and all human beings are involved in that ascent. IV In sharp contrast to Kant Maimonides argues that a life sub sumed in practice is prone to confusion. Piety without knowledge is a dangerous pursuit. Job, Maimonides believes, is a good illus tration of this propensity for confusion inherent in the pietistic or practical view. The Book of Job is a parable, Maimonides contends, and the key to understanding the book is the observation that Job "is not said to be a wise or a comprehending or an intelligent man. Only moral virtue and righteousness in action are attributed to him." Had he been "wise," Maimonides observes, "his situation would not have been obscure for him" (3.22, p. 487). Job, he observes, is a victim of knowing "God only through the traditional stories and not by way of speculation" (3.23, p. 493). Maimonides understands the Book of Job as a story about the inadequacies of a pietistic view of the world and about the ultimate triumph of a metaphysical view. Job is an individual whose faith in the practical is shaken and who comes to resolve his confusion by acknowledging the limits of the practical and proclaiming the superiority of the metaphysical. As Job initially saw it, he had done what was good; he was rewarded with what was good, and this is as it should be. Then, however, with no alteration in his conduct, his fortunes suddenly changed and suffering became his lot?suffering that seemed to be rewarded by yet more suffering. Something is wrong, Job concludes; the rules by which the universe is governed have been changed, and this seemingly arbitrary change in the established and accepted rules must, as Job sees it, bring these rules and God Himself as their author into question. Job concludes not that he is an evil person correctly punished, but that he is an innocent person wrongly pun ished. With this view, rebellion against God and against the law of the Bible begins to take shape.</page><page sequence="23">METAPHYSICS AND PIETY 795 Rushing in to preserve the integrity of the moral or pietistic view are Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar. They defend the position that doing good produces good for the person who does good, while doing evil produces evil for its perpetrator. Job insists that this view has been shown to be inadequate by his own experience. For Maimonides it is the entrance of Elihu that allows the discussion to reach a higher level, one at which the issue is seen as something more than a conflict within a moral interpretation of man and world. Elihu dismisses the opinions of the comforters as "senile drivel" (3.23, p. 494) and introduces a new idea, one Maimonides believes is an important key to an understanding of the book. According to Elihu, we have no basis upon which to judge God except through our experience of ourselves and the world around us. This experience is simply not appropriate as a basis upon which to judge God, however, for God is not like us or like anything else in the world around us. God is the cause of the world and of hu manity as a kind of creature in the world, but this does not mean that God is like anything in the world, including human beings. There is a difference between human understanding and divine un derstanding. This is a recurrent theme in the Guide: we must not fall into error and seek to affirm in [our] imagination that His knowl edge is like our knowledge or that His purpose and His providence and governance are like our purpose and our providence and our gov ernance. If man knows this, every misfortune will be borne lightly by him. (3.23, p. 497) The point is that moral experience is a very poor guide to un derstanding the world. When human beings place their moral ex perience aside and achieve intellectual understanding of the world, the problems they encounter at the level of moral experience will be resolved. Job is, in the view of Maimonides, a pietist. It is Job's pietistic attitude that is the cause of his problem. He cultivates obedience and ignores truth. His idea of the world is built up from within his own moral experience of the world. The result of Satan's wager is that the coherence of Job's moral view is undermined, and initially Job reacts by rebelling and challenging the very arrange ment of an order he believes originates in the will of God. The three comforters fail to shake him in his conviction that he is a good man made to suffer and that this event needs to be explained. Elihu begins this task of explanation by pointing out, in effect, that the problem Job faces is not one his moral framework has discovered</page><page sequence="24">796 R. Z. FRIEDMAN about the world; it is a problem with that framework itself. Job's conversion from the silver to the gold is completed in the voice from the whirlwind and in Job's new humility. Maimonides would say that only divine science will allow misfortune to be borne lightly and that, indeed, misfortune is intensified, and with it anger and frustration, when the moral point of view is allowed to predominate. Piety is not only an attitude towards obedience and moral virtue; it is an interpretation of what is important in life and of how the world works such that the importance of morality can be understood and appreciated. Job's problem is not simply that he is obedient, but that he has cultivated obedience as the highest task of life; and this has given him a very low opinion of the value of speculative knowledge. Worse, it encourages him to devise an interpretation of the world from the standpoint of one completely convinced of the supremacy of obedience and virtue. Obedience, for Job, is not an end, or at least not an end separable from benefit. This is the con viction that he and the three comforters share: "Do good" is nec essarily conjoined with "Get good." Perhaps one would call this a moral physics, or natural philosophy from a moral point of view.37 Whatever one calls it, for Maimonides it is obviously pseudo science, a complete fabrication based not on knowledge of the natural world but on the needs and interests of human beings. There is no reason to think that those who do good get good or that they ought to. Implicitly aware of this truth, Job and those committed to physics from a moral point of view argue a religious interpretation of nature. That is, nature derives from God, who insures that the principle "Do good, get good" will work. Moral physics finds its support in a moral metaphysics or moral theology. One fabrication deserves another; indeed, one fabrication seems to require another. For one not versed in speculation, Maimonides would surely affirm, this propensity to spin physical and metaphysical fabrications comes easily enough. Convinced of the role of obedience and moral virtue, and lacking intellectual discipline and knowledge of speculative in quiry, the pietist builds sand castles. His work is liberated from the need actually to describe what is real and is completely subsumed in the need to describe the world as he needs it to be. The pietist 37 See my "Evil and Moral Agency," International Journal for Philos ophy of Religion 24 (1988): 3-20.</page><page sequence="25">METAPHYSICS AND PIETY 797 reads his needs into the world and reads his idea of himself into God. In the beginning of the story, as Maimonides understands it, Job is a morally virtuous ignoramus for whom God is but a talisman, a code that gives power over nature and fate to the individual who possesses it. The pietist levels the world and levels God, insuring that neither is higher than his human vantage point will allow. The Book of Job, as Maimonides interprets the story, is an ac count of an individual who fashions the world and God as his moral views dictate. Job places himself in the center of the world and creates the rest of it out of the needs of his own moral experience. But the world, Job learns, plays by different rules, and in the end Job is defeated and left with inner conflict and rebellion. The solution, as Maimonides believes Elihu correctly perceives, is an intellectual understanding of the world, an understanding that cul minates in metaphysics. V Drawing in part on Maimonides' analysis of Job as I have de scribed it above, in this section I will sketch a Maimonidean critique of Kant and a possible Kantian rejoinder to Maimonides. First I will discuss Maimonides' critique of Kant. As we have seen, Mai monides argues that Aristotle compromises his argument on the eternity of the world by arguing that motion cannot be explained by way of an infinite regress, but that it requires a first or prime mover. Maimonides might apply a similar argument against Kant. Maimonides might assert that Kant compromises his argument that virtue is the highest good and that the principle of morality is an a priori synthetic practical proposition when he argues that we must accept freedom as a metaphysical predicate, if only from a practical point of view, and that we must accept the existence of God and the immortality of the soul as well. In effect, Kant is arguing that the practical or moral view of things is not self-contained. By postu lating freedom, God, and immortality Kant is admitting that a com pletely self-contained practical view that makes no knowledge claims is not possible. Of course, Maimonides believes that it is not pos sible. Maimonides might say that, like Aristotle, Kant has given us reason to think that he is wrong. In Kant's thought conscience and obedience become the central concerns of human life. This causes the individual to become</page><page sequence="26">798 R. Z. FRIEDMAN preoccupied with fidelity to principle and disdainful of intellectual pursuits. Kant's notion of the primacy of practical life may well harbor an anti-intellectual attitude. I can imagine Maimonides ar guing that Kant's thought is a glorification of the life of Plato's Cave. It accepts the darkness and fastens onto the idea of orderly existence, investing this idea with the status of truth. Of course, not even Kant can argue that this preoccupation ac tually produces truth: only belief about the world necessary to sup port orderly existence. We can only believe or have faith that God exists and that the soul is immortal. Kant forces the proponent of his view into a moral make-believe. The emphasis is not on know ledge as such but on what the human subject needs for the intelli gibility of the moral task. In this way, the needs of the human subject become the deter mining ground of the process by which truth claims, albeit truth claims self-consciously understood to be inferior, are made. This move shifts attention from the world as such to the self. In Mai monides' view Kant's position, including his defense of religion, is a thoroughgoing humanism. Quite in keeping with the trends as sociated with the mainstream of modern thought, it is antimeta physical and antitheological and turns to the human self for an intellectual foundation and a philosophical justification. Kant, of course, would not be without a reply. He would argue quite simply that the keystone of Maimonides' system is metaphys ical knowledge of God and that this knowledge is simply not available to human beings. The contention that God exists is no more intel lectually credible than the contention that God does not exist. There are limits to human knowledge; this is the way things are. Had Maimonides had the benefit of Hume's critique, he would perhaps have seen the need to investigate the limits of reason?an enterprise that Kant thought would put an end to all metaphysical speculation. Kant would be quick to argue that this does not mean we cannot believe in God. We can; indeed, we must. But belief is not a license to fabricate what we do not know in the name of what we want; it is recognition that we can affirm certain truths about the world as a result of our experience not of the world but of ourselves. What knowledge we have is based on our experience of ourselves, our all too-human selves that live in the recesses of the cave and poke around in an often vain attempt to imitate an order we feel within ourselves, but which we do not see in the world outside of us.</page><page sequence="27">METAPHYSICS AND PIETY 799 Kant might also argue that even if knowledge of the world were possible, it is not the case that knowledge is the highest good. Virtue is the highest good, and freedom, God, and the immortality of the soul "attach" themselves to virtue and allow expression of the high est concerns and interests of human beings. Kant might argue that the Maimonides I have described is really some sort of Platonist, that he has made knowledge the central fact of human existence and in doing so has become not only an intellectual elitist but a dogmatic critic of the value of morality and the moral achievements of ordinary individuals. I do not think Kant would hesitate to defend the view that obe dience to law is the central task of human life. Law is not simply a matter of, let us say, bringing some order to human activity; it reveals the unique character of the human person, that is, the power to impose an order based on justice on a world otherwise based on power. The Golden Rule is the only guide to human life, and it alone gives us what we can know about the world, namely, that it allows of our freedom although we know not how. The moral task is the highest task, Kant would surely argue. It involves a titanic struggle between nature and reason. It touches the life of every human being from the most intellectually illuminated to the un teachable ignoramus, and ennobles human life no less than does Maimonides' ascent to God. Indeed, the achievement of moral virtue is the ascent to God to the extent to which human beings are capable of it. Kant might well be the interlocutor the Guide lacks: the tough minded critic of metaphysics and defender of practice and moral virtue.38 38 Practice and moral virtue, the silver, are central to Maimonides' overall concern; for without the order and stability that religious law, which includes legal and moral law, provides, there would be neither stable communities nor intellectually disciplined human beings capable of making the ascent to God. Maimonides is the author not only of the Guide of the Perplexed, but also of the Mishneh Torah, a systematic presentation and account of Jewish Law. The Law is not the ascent, but without the Law there is no ascent. In his Introduction to the Code of Maimonides (Mishneh Torah), (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1980), Isadore Twersky provides an extended discussion of the intriguing issue of the relationship between law and philosophy in Maimonides, for whom, Twersky tells us, "Law must ... be understood and appreciated as well as obeyed and implemented" (p. 372).</page><page sequence="28">800 R. Z. FRIEDMAN VI Both Maimonides and Kant are concerned with knowledge and its limits. Both are concerned with practice, particularly with moral conduct and moral perfection. Both are defenders of religious points of view. Neither position is a collection of views; each is a systematic and comprehensive unity. For all that, though, it would be a mistake to overemphasize their similarity. Kant and Maimonides may speak the same philosophical language, but they argue very different, I would say, and diametrically opposed philosophical positions. Kant is a thoroughgoing skeptic, affirming the possibility only of phenomenal knowledge of the world, denying the possibility of metaphysical knowledge, including knowledge of the existence of God. Maimonides is not a skeptic. He accepts what Kant would call the "empirical reality" and the "transcendental reality" of the world, and he affirms the possibility of metaphysical knowledge, that is, the existence of God. Maimonides' negative theology is not a skepticism in the Kantian or Humean mode. Rather, it simply affirms the impossibility of the knowledge of God's essence while affirming the existence of God. In direct contrast to Kant, Mai monides believes that the highest good is intellectual perfection and that this teaching is consistent with the teaching of the Bible. Pines' contention that Maimonides finds an ally in Kant suggests an effort to restore Maimonides to the arena of contemporary phil osophical discussion. Maimonides, this view suggests, is to be taken more seriously than otherwise might be the case because, when cor rectly understood, he is aligned with and anticipates certain impor tant elements of modern thought, that is, a skeptical rejection of metaphysics and a defense of the centrality of moral virtue and social well-being. But Maimonides is not a modern thinker.39 Quite the contrary, he would see in Kant's position a false and dangerous view that makes ignorance a virtue while extolling the merits of obedience. He would say Kant's view compounds its ignorance by inventing and imposing a picture of the world liberated from know ledge and forged solely out of the facts of obedience?a view that 39 For a brief characterization of Maimonides as a medieval thinker see Harry Wolfson, "Maimonides and Halevi: A Study in Typical Jewish Attitudes Towards Greek Philosophy in the Middle Ages," in Studies in the History of Philosophy and Religion, vol. 1, 130-8 and 159-60.</page><page sequence="29">METAPHYSICS AND PIETY 801 will fail on an intellectual level and on an individual one as well. Maimonides, I believe, belongs in contemporary philosophical dis cussion. He belongs in it not because he is a supporter of some of modern thought's most important ideas, but because he is a brilliant and tough-minded critic of them. Job, Maimonides might well contend, is the archetype of modern man. Job is the pietist who experiences the world from within his own moral situation and proceeds to invent the world outside of his situation in conformity with his own moral experience. Job sees his invention fail, crushed before a world that works according to rules quite different from those he had imagined. In defeat, Mai monides might well argue, a modern Job would arrive at the same conclusions as did the biblical Job, namely, that he has been "done wrong" and that an explanation is required. When none is forth coming, as indeed none could be within the context of a view that accepts skepticism, the modern Job adopts an attitude of rebellion. From Maimonides' point of view, Camus may offer the final outcome of the Kantian view, that is, the glorification of the posture of re bellion: In a world deemed to make no sense at all, an absurd world, the only authentic posture is the individual's simple determination to live in it and to do so despite the world, as if living in it at all is a protest against the world. Camus' "metaphysical rebellion," Mai monides might argue, is simply an extension, perhaps an inevitable extension, of Kantian skepticism and pietism. The modern Job and the biblical Job have much in common, Maimonides would contend, and both have missed the point: that human beings cannot achieve valuable or enduring understanding from the standpoint of practice, for such a standpoint will encourage the individual to misconstrue his place in the scheme of things. The only way for the individual to achieve this understanding is through "intellectual perception," the highest expression of which is divine science or metaphysics.
