<plain_text><page sequence="1">XVIII MAN AND ANIMALS IN RECENT POETRY IN American poetry written since the World War one of the most significant new developments is now seen to be the fascination which animal life holds for the poet.' In American periodicals during the last fifteen years, 236 writers have been publishing earnest and philosophical poems about animals.2 In 1933 and 1934 the newest poets-Frederick Prokosch, Frances Frost, Marie Welch, Audrey Wurdemann, Joseph Auslander, Laura Benet, and above all Robert Tristram Coffin-were writing of little else. And practically every one in the older groups, whether traditional or radical, simple or esoteric, has written occasional poems about them. Notably Robert Frost, Edna St. Vincent Millay, Elinor Wylie, Hart Crane, Robinson Jeffers, Padriac Colum, and D. H. Lawrence have dealt with the subject repeatedly. Before our day, to be sure, there have been scattered poems about animals, but nothing like the mass of our new poetry could have arisen till the theory of biological evolution had not merely been formulated and accepted but also become part of the unconscious background of men's thinking, so that its subtler implications might color the poet's moods. As a result of modern biology the fabulous animal poetry of the imitators of Chaucer and Spenser has been superseded by a carefully literal poetry,3 which sees man and animals in perspective against a vast background of evolutionary wons. It regards the animal as the elder brother of man, more at home on the earth, yet an intimate com- rade on our strange and perilous journey through time.4 I A survey of books and periodicals printed since 1920 has revealed 165 poems about wild animals, 282 about domestic animals, 484 about birds, 52 about water animals, 164 about insects, and 28 about fabulous animals. In 1933 the theme became more popular than be- fore. 2 I have searched the American Mercury, Atlantic, Bookman, Canadian Bookman, Cen- tury, Commonweal, Current Opinion, Dial, Forum, Harpers, Hound and Horn, Literary Digest, Midland, Nation, New Republic, North American Review, Poetry, Saturday Review of Literature, Scribner's, Virginia Quarterly Review, and Yale Review. 3 Poems referring to mythological animals are still written, but are symbolical and psychological. The most striking ones are Elinor Wylie's Minotaur in New Republic June 1923, Marianne Moore's Sea Unicorns and Land Unicorns in Dial Nov. 1924, Countee Cullen's That Bright Chimeric Beast in New Republic Jan. 1929, Audrey Wurdemann's Borzoi in Forum Dec. 1930, Robert Coffin's Song for March in New Republic Feb. 1930, T. S. Eliot's Ash Wednesday (1930), Frederick Prokosch's The Lonely Unticorn in Harpers Feb. 1932.

Our poets, seeing man in a world not made for him, a world which has existed without him for countless ages, are yet haunted by one echo of a man-centered Christian theology. The counterpart of the old notion of "original sin," setting man apart from the other animals, persists. If lustful goats and serpents envious Cannot be damned, alas, why should I be? asked Donne rebelliously in the seventeenth century, and a similar tone of injury is heard in the twentieth, a complaint that the human race has been discriminated against.'0 The nature of our damnation is, however, conceived very differently, as we shall see. Not only biology but psychology has made today's poetry about ani- mals a new thing. Current psychology has so outmoded the moralistic animal-verse of the Victorians that even the gentle birds and beasts that they most admired are ignored." And it has made archaic also that poetry, especially characteristic of the romanticist period, that ascribed human or angelic trains of thought to animals.'2 The common-sense of I See the satire on Blake's Tiger in Basil Bunting's Fearful Symmetry in Poetry Feb. 1932, and Winifred Welles' The Unicorn in Memory in Harper's July 1934. 6 See Anna Hampstead Branch's To a Dog and To My Black Kitten in Saturday Review Dec. 1928 and John Finley's Song in Saturday Review April 1929. 7 See Robinson Jeffers' Roan Stallion (1925) and Hurt Hawks in Nation Feb. 1928, and D.

Ficke's Soul in Torment (John Donne) in Forum July 1932. 11 Louis Untermeyer enumerates these animals in a satirical poem called A Georgian Anthology in New Republic Dec. 1925. 12 For the best account of this theme in the past see Caroline Richardson's Story Animals in Yale Review Vol. 13.</page><page sequence="3">Elizabeth Atkins 265 our time does not tolerate this humanizing of an animal's conscious- ness."8 Once written, poetry is largely independent of changing theories; the poetry about birds by Wordsworth, Keats, Arnold, and Whitman has the abiding place in literature always granted to great beauty, but imi- tation of it nowadays would be as artificial as imitation of the cosmogony of Paradise Lost.14"15 One aspect of tho animal poetry of the past has, to be sure, persisted. A sensuous delight in birds and beasts is not a new thing. It has always existed-in Theocritus, in Anacreon, in the young Vergil, in Petrarch, in Chaucer. The poet of today, no less than one of the past, is often like a child, standing in the freshness of the countryside and suddenly, at a strange movement or sound, staring hard, while his breath comes deeply. "Oh look! Oh listen!" the new poetry cries of some wondrous thing with its unmistakable pulse and accent of life. Before a shy woodland crea- ture our poets may be filled with as eager approval as was any early Greek or Elizabethan. The lark now leaves his watery nest And climbing, shakes his dewy wings, cried Davenant one spring morning, and after three centuries it is still as if the listener felt the freshness of dawn on his uplifted face. That is the magic our poets would catch if they could. The root of the matter is in them-the sense of marvel, the self-forgetful absorption in the strange color, the shape, the sound, the feel of mysterious creatures. It causes Frank Kenyon, enraptured by the whiteness of a swan among water- lilies, to cry out: A man might live a score of lives But not surpass such sights as this!'" Nor is this childlike mood of marvel unknown to our more occult poets. Even in the most esoteric poem of our times, Brooklyn Bridge, Hart Crane muses: 13 Poetry is now ahead of prose in giving up humanized animals. Virginia Woolf's Flush, for instance, appearing in 1933, presents a dog-consciousness so incredibly human that it would seem thoroughly outmoded if it were poetry, though it is being praised for its fresh accuracy as a prose-work. (I am not denying that "cute" and insincere verses about animals still appear in magazines, but this paper is concerned entirely with poetry.) 14 Of course animals are still humanized in humorous poetry. One of the best examples is Vachel Lindsay's The Mountain Cat in New Republic Dec. 1922. See also Theodore Maynard's Tragedy in Saturday Review of Literature March 1934. 15 Shelley's Ode to a Skylark has more in common with present poetry. His intense in- terest in philosophy and psychology made him almost prophetic of twentieth-century theories of animal consciousness. 16 The Swan in Atlantic Jan. 1931.</page><page sequence="4">266 Man and Animals in Recent Poetry How many dawns, chill from his rippling rest, The sea-gull's wings shall dip and pilot him, Shedding white rings of tumult! Though this mood is immemorial, yet our poets express it more fully than poets of any earlier period. Ours is a time of intimate portraiture of animals, with fidelity of detail worthy of the old Dutch portrait painters. The profusion of detail is new, and the poet's simplicity and sincerity give many of the poems lasting beauty. Their great number makes it inexpedient even to list them here, but their very profusion as well as their quality arouses curiosity as to how they came to be written. Perhaps one thinks first of the more superficial causes. Chinese and Japanese poetry has always dealt with tiny forms of life, and the popu- larizing of Oriental poetry in America-first through the essays of Lafcadio Hearn and then through the translations and imitations by Amy Lowell, Ezra Pound, and Eunice Tietjens-undoubtedly had some- thing to do with the fact that 165 American poems about insects have been published recently. One remembers also that the essays of the naturalist, W. H. Hudson, became very popular in America shortly before so many poets began to record their delight in the power, beauty, and grace of woodland creatures. Also during the 1920's a revival of interest in Emily Dickinson undoubtedly had its effect. The sensuous- ness and accuracy of her poems about birds and snakes and insects are so in key with twentieth-century writing that it is hard to realize that they were not written during the decade when many of them first saw the light of print. Undoubtedly reading Emily Dickinson has made our poets more sensitive to animals' movements and less tolerant of blurred recording. In addition some importance should be attached, I suppose, to two other influences. The last twenty years have removed most of us from habitual association with animals. Living with machines rather than with horses"7 and cows,18 and in cities rather than among creatures of the woods and fields, we see animals nowadays with a shock of novelty. 17 For poems about missing the horse see Clinch Calkins' I Sometimes Think in Nation April 1927, Bert Cooksley's Stable Boy in Nation Oct. 1929, Hal White's Bent Toward Mountains in Nation April 1929, Calvin Wilson's Phantom Hoofs in Poetry May 1930, Charles Reznikoff's Horse in Poetry 1931, Helen Cornelius' Elegy in New Republic Oct. 1932, and Wm. Rose Ben6t's The Ponies in Forum July 1932. 18 Of the forty poems about cows the best, in my opinion, are Elizabeth Coatsworth's The Cows in Poetry May 1922, Joseph Auslander's Three Things in New Republic Feb. 1923, Lizette Reese's Driving Home the Cows in New Republic Oct. 1931, Frances Frost's Roadside in Blue Harvest (1931), David Cornel Dejong's Calves in Virginia Quarterly Re- view July 1932, Robert Frost's Pasture in Canadian Bookman 1932, and Robert Francis' Midsummer in Virginia Quarterly Review July 1933.</page><page sequence="5">Elizabeth Atkins 267 And almost as important an influence has been the widespread interest in psycho-analysis, with its emphasis on the animal substratum in human nature. Obviously the poetry of D. H. Lawrence,'9 Robinson Jeffers,20 and Conrad Aiken21 bears trace of this influence. Yet even if none of these influences had been operative, I am convinced that the new poetry about animals would still have arisen. The funda- mental cause for the new interest lies, I think, far deeper than any of these conditions. In the first place, for years a fresh note in poetry has been insistently demanded. Ever since the World War, poets have been choking in the closed room of a sick civilization. But no longer, as once in the past, may an escape to savage or peasant life bring fresh air to their laboring lungs. They have seen the diseases of the human spirit infect all classes. Nor has the Victorian way of escape been open, that of turning from a sordid adult world to adore free and innocent child- hood and cloistered girlhood. Children no longer seem free, for behavior- istic psychology shows society slipping its control belt over the kicking legs of the new-born infant. Girlhood has moved from the poetry pages into the advertising section, and with advertisements reiterating the relationship of diet and exercise to her slender, lithe perfection, the young girl is no longer praised as God's handiwork but as her own. She is told no longer that she is fit for heaven, but that she is ready for Hollywood. Poets no doubt admire these self-made young creatures; but they do not write poetry about them. A more desperate mode of escape from a sick civilization was sought by poets immediately after the War, when they attempted withdrawal into their inmost incontaminable selves. But these hidden selves proved incommunicable, even to other poets; and as recent studies in psychology have weakened belief in freedom of thought and in the validity of intro- spection, the spirit is ebbing from this subjectivist and symbolist verse. Edmund Wilson's admirable book of criticism, Axel's Castle, published in 1931, seems to mark the passing of symbolist poetry in its more recondite phases. Therefore it seems natural that poets turned to almost the only un- tried way of escape from despair, to reverence for non-human life. After all, the animals are kin to us, and a soundness at the core of our natures is suggested if we can find soundness in the primitive life of the beasts.22 19 See the volume Birds and Beasts and Flowers (1923). 20 See especially the Freudian echoes in Roan Stallion (1925). 21 See Preludes for Memnon (1933). 22 There was also the related movement in poetry after the war toward so-called "da- daism," or conscious infantilism. This was a failure, of course; yet some of our serious animal poetry has grown out of consciously infantile poetry. See especially the earliest animal poems of Robert Tristram Coffin, The Day After Christmas in Forum Dec. 1928.</page><page sequence="6">268 Man and Animals in Recent Poetry The pioneer in this movement was the poet and philosopher Santa- yana. Detecting the fallacies of myths, he has no over-strained aversion to using them. As early as 1906, in one of his sonnets, he expressed his revulsion against our human self-consciousness and his envy of the beast's different awareness. But he met with no responsive cry from other poets until 1924, when he published his Preface to a System of Phi- losophy.23 From that time on poetry has been filled with echoes of his thought. He said: The world is old, and can have changed but little since man arose in it, else man himself would have perished.... Sundry animals not much older than man ... have had time to take the measure of life, and have settled down to a routine of preferences and habits which keeps their heads as a race above water; and they are presumably visited at appropriate seasons by magic images, which are sym- bols to them of the world or of the cycles of their destiny. Again he attacked our feeling of human superiority by saying, "Perhaps the only true dignity of man is his capacity to despise himself." The germ of all our most significant new poetry is in these remarks. Between the publication of his sonnets in 1906 and his Preface in 1924, much had happened to put poets in greater accord with Santa- yana's criticism of our human pre-occupations. In the first place there was, during the first two decades of the century, the introspective trend in literature, which reached such lengths that for a few years poet and novelist were self-obsessed to the point of abnormality. When this pa- thology of self-consciousness began to wear itself out, it left poets with a new appreciation of Santayana's cry: I would I might forget that I am I! Happy the dumb beast hungering for food, But calling not his suffering his own.2u Then, in 1921, just as the public was beginning to find the literature of pathological self-concern intolerable, Edna St. Vincent Millay burst out: O tiresome heart, forever living and dying, House without air, I leave you and lock your door. Wild swans, come over the town, come over The town again, trailing your legs and crying!25 And she led poets out into the fresh air, where they were filled with ecstasy at the sight of Jiving beauty without self-awareness, of grace that does not preen before a mirror. By 1923 Elinor Wylie too was musing on an animal's freedom from vanity and reflecting: 23 This essay first appeared in Yale Review April 1924. 24 Sonnets (1906). 2f Wild Swans in Current Opinion Sept. 1921.</page><page sequence="7">Elizabeth Atkins 269 Aristocratic skulls Rejected as inept That innocency kept 'Twixt orbed eyes of bulls.21 And soon Grace Conkling also recoiled from human vanity to delight in the gull, "so unaware that it is beautiful,"27 and A. D. Ficke watched the innocent beauty of his horse almost with reverence, as She lifted up her head With the proud incredible poise Of beauty recovered From the Mycenian tombs; She openied her nostrils With the wild arrogance Of life that knows nothing Except that it is life.28 The nature of this dream-consciousness, blessedly unentangled with all one's own problems of self-sickness, fascinates the poet. What is it? Santayana's name is "solipsism of the present moment," and he suspects that an animal may "keenly enjoy the momentary scene, never con- ceiving himself as a separate body or as anything but the unity of that scene, nor his enjoyment as anything but its beauty."29 I have no idea how many of our poets read Santayana, but of course that does not matter, once his ideas are in the air. His idea is their feeling. So to Charles Ballard the sea-gull, in its ecstasy of flight, seems to cry out: I am not I- only space- And wind and spray!30 All the intensity of the poet's longing goes out to this magical, free knowledge, this dream-consciousness, free of the past, free of the future, free of self-sickness.3' Marie Welch has, I think, better than any other poet, evoked the quality of this dream-consciousness: 2' Minotaur in New Republic June 1923.

The wood is a pattern of wakening, although The brook fades, and the dry leaves stir, For, bearing a delicate answer, the young doe As in a dream seeketh the questioner.32 Stanley Burnshaw feels that men too may once have possessed this unconscious grace, and in nostalgia for our lost Eden he cries: Would we could know The way men moved When thought was only The great dark love, And blood lay calm In a depthless dream.33 The "awkward age" of psychology must have had much to do with the recoil, at this time, from simpering human pretensions to beauty. When William James first began to speculate about a human robot (an "automatic sweetheart," for instance) most readers were amused; but by 1920 the idea was no longer a joke. It had become the fashion to speak of ourselves as puppets, jerked by invisible strings. But our hearts were unreconciled. No doubt if we ever become convinced that we are part of an absolutely fatalistic universe, all sense of human awkwardness will pass, and we shall admire the behavior of our friends and of our- selves as unselfconsciously as we now admire winds and tides and the moving planets. But in the early 1920's we were very far from this mood. We human beings, with our very uncertain notions of freedom and im- portance, looked as awkward as riders on an escalator, undecided whether to go through the motions of climbing or to assume statuesque Snow (1928), Raymond Holden's Wind Across the Valley in New Republic Dec. 1928, Joseph Auslander's Indictment in New Republic May 1928, Charles Ballard's Sea Bird in North American Review Aug. 1930, Arthur Davidson Ficke's Emblems of Spring in Harpers May 1931, Janet Lewis' Lines to a Kitten in New Republic Sept. 1930, Robert Tristram Coffin's Go to the Barn with a Lantern in Literary Digest Oct. 1930 and Crystal Moment in Harpers Dec. 1931, Frances Frost's Portrait of Life in Blue Harvest (1931), Marjorie Seiffert's The Name of Life in Scribners May 1932, Carl Rakosi's A Journey Away in Hound and Horn July 1932, Christina Chapin's Birds in Atlantic July 1933, E.

We seemed stupidly self-concerned, absurdly pretentious; and we were impossible subjects for ecstatic poetry till the feeling passed. A far greater cause of recoil than the technicalities of psychology was, of course, the war. On poets the first after-effect of the war was longing for oblivion,-was nausea at the thought of any existence. The fertility of lower animal life seemed revolting. "Insane old salty womb," Max Eastman called the sea, with its continual spawning.34 Later Scofield Thayer expressed the same revulsion, reflecting that even the freshness of spring air is infected with animal existence: It is the worm-and-corpse-corrupted Earth which wrought this air. It is her heart, made rich with vileness, Which wails and mounts the wind.35 And this mood led, for a time, to interest only in macabre animal forms.3" But the mood lightened and gave way to a wistful feeling that the first step in nature's experiment of conscious life was not to be regretted, since it is a life so dreamlike that it is carried on the current of the world without any of the rebellion arising from grief or egotism.37 Another reflection, forced upon them by the war, left poets not merely tolerant of simpler forms of life, but newly respectful toward them. For the paragon of animals suddenly saw himself in danger of insane self- slaughter, leaving the earth to exclusive possession of lowlier animals 34 See The Net and Little Fishes in the Masses Anthology. See also Alfred Kreymborg's Festoons of Fishes in Dial June 1923, Amy Lowell's Apotheosis, and Raymond Holden's Spring in a Dry Valley in New Republic April 1927. 35 The Fingers of the Night in Dial Feb. 1926. 36 This interest in the macabre (in imitation of the style of Poe's The Conqueror Worm) resulted in no memorable poetry; but it was valuable in opening the way to interest in the harsher forms of animal life, which led to perception of strange beauty in them. See, for instance, The Ugly People, by Marie Welch, in New Republic, May 1932. The beauty of snakes was, of course, perceived by Blake and Shelley, but it is more widely acknowledged nowadays, as a result of poems written since the war. See especially D. H. Lawrence's Snake in Dial May 1922, Margaret Larkin's A Snake Poemn in Poetry June 1924, Elizabeth Coatsworth's No Snake in Springtime in Poetry 1927, Margaret Emerson Bailey's Higher Mathematics in Harpers July 1929, Kenneth Alling's WVater Sntake in Poetry March 1933, and Robert Tristram Coffin's Strange Holiness in Harpers July 1933. 37 Yet since animals are only half-way to unconsciousness, -a few poems have dwelt upon their capacity for pain or even for awkwardness. See Alice Corbin's Trees and Horses in Dial Dec. 1920, Djuna Barnes' Pastoral in Dial April 1920, Elinor Wylie's Cold Blooded Creatures in New Republic Aug. 1921, Robert Hillyer's Moo in New Republic Oct. 1923, Elizabeth Coatsworth's The Old Mare in Dial Feb. 1924, Robert Frost's The Cow in Apple Time in Mozntain Interval (1924), Glenn Dresbach's The Gnawing Mouse in Poetry Nov. 1927, Janet Lewis' Little Goat in New Republic Sept. 1930, Lew Sarett's Coyote Brood in Poetry May 1931, Ellis Barrett's Ostrich in Poetry Jan. 1932 and Lionel Wiggam's Sharp Fear in Nation May 1934.</page><page sequence="10">272 Man and Animals in Recent Poetry What wonder that our human pride was humbled? What wonder that in 1920 T. S. Eliot, already musing on the human Waste Land, gave the traditional symbol of the deathless nightingale new significance, as he posed it against an ancient and a modern murder? The public caught his mood and recalled his lines in Sweeney Among the Nightingales: The nightingales are singing near The convent of the Sacred Heart And sang within the bloody wood When Agamemnon cried aloud, And let their liquid siftings fall To stain the stiff dishonored shroud. In the same year Djuna Barnes mused that the humblest animal forms would have the wit to survive the self-destructive human race.38 Soon Robinson Jeffers,39 Carl Sandburg,40 Archibald MacLeish, 4 and minor writers were making the same asseveration.42 Finally, in 1928, it achieved its supremely beautiful expression in Edna St. Vincent Millay's sonnet- sequence, Epitaph on the Race of Man.43 Musing on the ultimate destruc- tion of our planet, Miss Millay said: High on his naked rock the mountain sheep Will stand alone against that final sky. For she was sure that long before that day there would be nothing but the ruins of our steel towers to indicate that on this Earth there had once existed Most various man, cut down to spring no more, Before his prime, even in his infancy Cut down, and all the clamor that was he Silenced, and all the riveted pride he wore, A rusty iron column whose tall core The rains have tunneled like an aspen tree. Can poets comfort themselves by reflecting that during our little human interval we may hold in serene possession a beauty greater than that of animals, which the best of our race have achieved? Not in their present mood, for they feel that men cannot reproduce themselves exactly, as animals do. Shakespeare might beg the beautiful boy of his sonnets to beget sons that the future might possess his beauty, but we 18 Pastoral in Dial April 1920. 39 In The Cycle in Roan Stallion (1925). 40 In Four Playthings of the Wind in Smoke and Steel (1920). 41 See Streets in the Moon (1926) and The Hamlet of Archibald MacLeish (1928). 42 See Robert McBlair's Philosophy in New Republic Feb. 1928, Daniel Hickey's The Victors in Harpers April 1932, Charles Norman's Sapphic in Hound and Horn Winter 1930, and B.

And only less ephemeral are the beautiful things that men create. Edna St. Vincent Millay, piecing together some beautiful shards of a past civilization, cried out to the beauty of the birds, the flickers, above her, for consolation. But their beauty seemed to answer, "I cannot console the broken thing; I can only make it whole."" The shards of the ancient pot crumble into dust, but the wonder of the under-wings of the flickers remains as bewilderingly burnished as when flickers flew above those early men at the time the pot was in the making. As a result of such brooding certain poets plunged headlong to the conviction that the race of man is in every way not superior but inferior to other animals. In 1922 D. H. Lawrence wrote of the snake that came up to drink out of his watering trough: Was it humility to feel so honored? I felt so honored.45 And a whole book of his poems is filled with his envy of the possessions of various animals, from the "grand old lust" of the goat, to the exuber- ance of the turkey-cock.46 We human beings are divorced from the natural dignity and zest of animals, D. H. Lawrence felt, because we are in conflict with our own natures. As we have developed power of reflection, we have begun to lie to ourselves about our own desires, so that natural love and hate have degenerated into sentimentality. "Who- ever walks a mile full of false sympathy," he said, "walks to the funeral of the whole human race." And again, When Jesus commanded us to love our neighbor He forced us to live a great lie or to disobey, For we can't love anybody, neighbor or no neighbor, to order, And faked love has rotted our marrow. Most of the poets following Lawrence stressed human rationality as the cause of our artificiality and awkwardness. One remembers that Berg- son's philosophy was very much in the air, after the war;47 and poets 44Pueblo Pot in The Buck in the Snow (1928). A sense of the greater permanence of animals is also expressed in Louise Driscoll's The Owl in Poetry June 1923, James Rorty's Now That These Two in Nation Sept. 1925, Theodore Momson's The Swallows in Atlantic July 1926, Allen Tate's Ditty in Nation June 1926, Joseph Auslander's The Death of Adonis in Dial Feb. 1928, Hal White's These Things Shall Stay in North American Review June 1928, George Dillon's Pigeons in Boy in the Wind (1927), Marian Canby's Hermit Thrush in High Mowing (1932), David Cornel Dejong's In Parting in Virginia Quarterly Review Oct. 1932 and F.

In 1925 Robinson Jeffers attacked our human problem in People and a Heron and in Roan Stallion, and he returned to it in his later volumes. Our so-called human nature is a cramping vice upon nature, he asserted. Humanity is the mold to break away from, The crust to break through, The coal to break into fire, The atom to be split.48 The science in which we trust is merely a wild fence-jumper, carrying our attention farther and farther from our desperate problems, and the most terrible perversions are only insane attempts to break through the human crust that has hardened over our live natures.49 We are the one luckless race on "the starlit stone breast,""0 he feels, and our one hope of peace is to escape from one another and try to learn something from the free energy of hawks and stallions.6' More quietly Robert Frost asserted the same disbelief in the power of science to comfort us. Rational man, he says, is a caged bear That all day fights a nervous inward rage, The telescope at one end of his beat And at the other end the microscope.52 And a still quieter poet, David Morton, was overwhelmed with envy of swans, as he watched their serenity, in contrast with our tortured labor at release From the dark chambers of tormented thought.53 In 1926 Archibald MacLeish began a similar complaint against the unnaturalness and the dis-ease of human life.

Raymond Holden,66 Mark Van Doren,"7 Frank E. Hill,58 John Hall Wheelock,59 and most recently William Faulkner60 have all comforted themselves with the dreamlike, uncertain hints in our natures of a time in the past when we were wholly in harmony with the Earth-life. To me the most lyrical of these com- plaints against human unnaturalness is Leonie Adams' Lament of the Quarry, in which man is called "the Natureless creature that has con- fusion to his part."'61'62 It is paradoxical but natural, I suppose, that poets, lovers of words, should be in revolt against the instrument of the human reason, lan- guage. If rationality is a paralysis of nature, then language is a distor- tion of reality and should be abjured.63 And several poets do, in fact, denounce their own medium of communication. In 1925 Rolfe Hum- phries spoke against language as Against Fog, and sighed enviously: Where deer and panther go No gray vapor of nomenclature is, No film of title coats the colored bird.64 A few years later Hart Crane expressed the same envy: I dreamed that all men dropped their names and sang As only they can sing who build their days With fin and hoof, with wing and sweetened fang, Struck free and holy in one Name always.65 Recently Virginia Moore also, finding that every human hope, idea, and memory are rendered equivocal by words, has felt that animals are less handicapped :66 16 See Forest in New Republic June 1926 and Farewell to Simple Earth in New Republic May 1929. 57 See How Can Man in Nation May 1923 and Man in Dial Sept. 1927. 68 See Black Magic in New Republic Sept. 1922. 69 See Unison in Yale Review March 1932. 60 See Over the World's Rim in New Republic April 1933. 61 In Poetry March 1927. 62 See also Babette Deutsch's Sonnet in Saturday Review May 1926, James Rorty's Words for a Young Woman in Nation Sept. 1926, Harold Cook's Against Heaven in New Republic Oct. 1929, Eunice Tietjens' Revolt in Poetry Oct. 1930, and Robert Tristram Coffin's Wild Bee's Nest in Nation May 1934. 63 A few poems praising rationality above animal dream-consciousness are Eunice Tiet- jens' Neanderthal in Poetry July 1923, Enrique Martinez' Wring the Neck of the Swanl in Poetry June 1925, Mark Van Doren's Farewell to Fields in Now the Sky (1928), Isador Schneider's After Reading a History of Biology in Nation Oct. 1930, Babette Deutsch's Brief Solace in Yale Review Dec. 1930, Elder Olson's Thus Revealed in Poetry Oct. 1931, and Leila Jones' Wings for the Intermediate in Saturday Review Oct. 1933. 64 Against Fog in New Republic Nov. 1925. 65 A Name for All in Dial April 1929. 16 See Tell Me God in Nation Dec. 1931.</page><page sequence="14">276 Man and Animals in Recent Poetry There's no reproach to a bird; Whatever he does is right. There's no mistake to be heard In his crying by night.67 And she repeats: I would be shriven strict and fine Of a subtle lie Which birds know not.68 And Conrad Aiken has shut himself up with this same problem for the last three years. Denouncing language, he does not use it the less. Now and again, in this magazine and that, appears a fragment of his brood- ing, under the invariable title Prelude. Our human world is "voice- shaped," he laments.69 We falsify everything by expressing it. And our human trouble grows worse from one generation to the next, he laments, since each generation adds a further burden of verbal description to our notion of the world, which is passed on as tradition, to stand as a thicker screen between our descendants and the real world. Another group of poets, Elinor Wylie, T. S. Eliot,70 George Dillon, and Merrill Moore,7" have conceived of our human trouble as due less to artificial rationality and stubborn language than to fatigue. It was natural, of course, that Elinor Wylie, in her mortal illness, should have been repelled by human frailty and should have felt that we experience the world less truly than the stronger animals do, with their "flesh of fiercer grain."72 She declared: From flesh refined to glass A god goes desertward, Astride a spotted pard, Between an ox and ass.72 Again, looking at a lion, she became contemptuous of the power of human-beings to be unkind, even, and asked herself, of the nerve- tortured man who had offended her: Can this spider-web image hurt you? This ramshackle atomy lacking strength And brave commensurate virtue?73 67 Justified Bird in Nation Sept. 1928. 68 If I Could Utter in Saturday Review April 1930. 69 Prelude in Atlantic March 1933. 70 See The Waste Land (1922). 71 See If I Could Speak in The Noise That Time Makes (1929). 72 Minotaur in New Republic June 1923. 71 Unfinished Ballad in Collected Poems (1932).</page><page sequence="15">Elizabeth Atkins 277 In the same mood George Dillon, in his Address to the Doomed, con- ceived of man as The weariest creature and the last, The sigh of God upon the seventh day, and he said to him: Of all living creatures you alone Surmise exclusion from the secret plan- You, with the cipher cut into your own Most unimaginable substance, man.74 Such an attitude has led almost to a deification of the larger, stronger animals, much in the spirit of ancient religions. Some of the poems about cattle suggest the Zeus legends strongly.75 A few poets comment on the resemblance of their feeling to that of the ancient Greeks and Assyrians, but more of our poetry in praise of cattle and bison,76 goats77 and stallions,78 does not seem to be consciously echoing classic legends, 74Much the same idea of human nature as a degeneration of animal vitality is in William Faulkner's The Race's Splendor and Man Comes, Man Goes in New Republic May 1933, and in Edgar Lee Masters' Beethoven's Ninth Symphony and the King Cobra in American Mercury Oct. 1932. 75 Poems about bulls and cows suggesting bulls and cows of Greek myths are Elizabeth Coatsworth's The Cows in Poetry May 1922 and Wm.

Robinson Jeffers is more explicit than any other poet in this new tend- ency to deify animal energy. He returns again and again to his idea that the stallion and the hawk are the incarnation of God. In Roan Stallion the woman of the story, living in primitive conditions, is unable to conceive of God in the conventional Christian terms, and trying to tell a Bible story to her little girl, she finds her tongue tripping: "Mary was the stallion's wife. What did I say? God's wife." And she can pic- ture the angels only as hawks. In another poem Jeffers asserts that the "wild God of this world" has nothing to do with our anthropomorphic religions. He declares: You do not know him, you communal people, or you have forgotten him. Intemperate and savage, the hawk remembers him.79 And Jeffers adds, "I'd sooner, except for the penalties, kill a man than a hawk."80 But I find this explicit myth-making by Jeffers less significant than the widespread conviction among poets that animals are wiser and more beautiful than we and that we can learn of them. Not that poets believe in bringing animals to us. Several poems describe the ruinous effect of the artificial human race on an animal's natural beauty. The beast may even become infected with something of human awkwardness and falsity. Pet animals, caged animals, city sparrows, swans in city parks making "a peanut parody for peanut people," these, poets usually treat with a measure of contempt.8' Natural animals, poets say, regard the race of man, and even the dog, won over to us, as outcasts.82 Robert Tristram Coffin shows how the mere sight of a human being kills a fox's ecstatic beauty: Such beauty was not meant for me With my dull eyes so close to see.

Robinson Jeffers makes the stallion symbolic of God, George O'Neil and Frank Mitalsky of beauty, Lee Weber of imagination and of the swift-moving Earth, and Miriam de Ford of swift darkness. 79 His latest book carrying this thesis is Give Your Heart to tke Hawks (1933). 80 Hurt Hawk. 81 See Padriac Colum's Jackdaw in New Republic April 1921, Frances Jenning's Thunder Storm at the Zoo, Basil Thompson's A Rhyme of Reasoning, Camilla Doyle's The Town Rab- bit in Chapbook 1923, E.

Then he faded at a stroke Like a dingy, melting smoke.83 But the poets seem to hope that if we admire animal qualities intensely enough, we may perhaps put them on, as Indians, in their ceremonies, try to put on an animal's nature. (Several poets of today are deeply impressed by Indian ceremonial.)84 What does this putting on of animal nature mean to the poet? It means, first of all, thirstily drinking up sensation. Poets, more than other men, must live for the qualities of their sensations, and a too practical, too cerebral life in our day is the chief reason why there has been the widespread worry lest the themes of poetry be exhausted. Poets have nervously asked, "What shall I write about?" instead of abandoning themselves to the intense awareness of the present moment which is poetry. Some of the most truly poetic of our animal-poems are those in which the poet vicariously enjoys taste, or scent, or temperature, or muscle-sensation as he believes that an animal enjoys them.85 Strange Holiness in Harpers July 1933. 14 Poems interpreting the Indian's deification of animals are Lew Sarett's Blue Duck in Poetry Nov. 1918, Mary Austin's The Eagle's Song in Poetry Jan. 1920, Lew Sarett's Broken Bird in Poetry April 1921, Witter Bynner's Buffalo Dance in Nation Sept. 1924, Lilian Spencer's Pueblo Legend in Nation Jan. 1926, Witter Bynner's Eagle Dance in New Republic July 1929.

Strengthen us so that we can suffer with intensity and dignity, seems to be the poet's prayer. It is significant that the most convincing pictures of animal ecstasy portray the hunted deer and the hunted fox. Today's poetry has none of the overstrained pity that was so popular in the past. The continual danger in a wild animal's existence-life beating against death at every moment-is what gives it intense awareness that rises to ecstasy. That being the case, danger of death is not the torturing thing that it has seemed to the fevered imagination. This is the most tonic note in the new poetry. Poets face the cruelty in animal life squarely, and praise it.92 "The fierce, sane cruelty of life" before it is distorted by the brain's sick fevers, simply means single-minded intensity of life, they say." So Mr. Coffin describes the ecstasy of the hunted fox: He came down the road on feet Quiet and fragile, light as heat. His ears were conscious, whetted darts; His eyes had small flames in their hearts. The preciousness of life and breath Glowed through him as he outran death. This poem.

In an equally beautiful poem, Crystal Moment, Mr. Coffin returns to the same theme, the ecstasy of hunting and hunted creatures. As a child, he is watching a deer pursued by hounds: I saw the crystal drop of light In his eyes turned dark with fright, I saw the forest's holiness On him like a fierce caress. In his wake the hot hounds churned, They stretched their muzzles out and yearned. They cried no more, but swam and throbbed; Hunger drove them till they sobbed. Life and death upon one tether And running beautiful together. There is healing for the spirit in considering this ecstatic awareness of life that seems to arise from the cruelty in the animal world. The poet, bruised and strained by pity past the breaking point, can no longer tolerate sentimental poetry of "the little hunted hare," that Ralph Hodgson popularized at the beginning of our century. There is no denial nowadays of suffering in the animal world-in fact there is insistence on it-but there is a bracing doctrine that to live with self-forgetful energy as hunter and hunted is preferable to egotistical cringing in a shelter. The animal is for the time being a deification of qualities that men have been afraid to worship before: ruthless intensity, unbridled energy, unhindered sensation, disregard of reason, abandonment of anxiety for the future. Probably men would still be afraid to proclaim their allegiance to such qualities if they were not incarnate in animals. One is reminded of the rustic in the Elizabethan drama who enjoyed a cozy friendship with his old dog, even though he realized that the devil had taken the dog for his familiar. These qualities that the poets thirst for lose their demonic and terrifying quality as we see them incarnate in the beautiful and innocent birds and beasts. I suspect that a person of common sense would remark after all this that poets are idealizing animals beyond all recognition, and would voice his conviction that animals enjoy little of the felicity ascribed to them by these carpers at the human race. And a person combining common sense with erudition, if that is possible, would doubtless have much to say of this being an old philosophy under a new coating. In poets' nostalgia for their natural life in the earlier stages of evolution, such a person would see a refurbishing of Rousseau's myth of men's</page><page sequence="21">Elizabeth Atkins 283 felicity before the Social Contract, or of Plato's myth of our prenatal bliss free of our bodily fetters, or of the Hebrew myth of Eden. It is an old mythology, of course, cropping up perennially within many a fence erected against it. But I am chiefly interested in the fact that the new turn given to it, the new idealization of animals, is as earnestly believed as any old mythology was believed in its time. Like any other myth- ology, it has grown out of the science and special problems of its day. ELIZABETH ATKINS University of Minnesota</page></plain_text>
