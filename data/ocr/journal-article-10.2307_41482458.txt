<plain_text><page sequence="1">Penso's Roots: The Politics and Poetics of Cultural Fusion Eleazar Gutwirth With the recent establishment of the Joseph Penso Prize by the European Federation of Stock Exchanges, Penso has, like Spinoza, once again transcended the parameters of history, community and discipline. Joseph Penso de la Vega (1650- 1692) rose to prominence in the Sephardic community of Amsterdam in the 1660s. A successful merchant with relatives in Hamburg, Livorno and later in London, it was with his pen that he earned his fame. In a succession of subjective and impressionistic studies, however, critics have tended to judge rather than explain his work.1 It is therefore refreshing to note the growing interest among economists in his innovative ideas. An analysis of the reception Penso's publications received is made additionally complex by the wide range of audiences he addressed. His subjects included the stock exchange as well as politics and religion; his terms of reference were Italian, Spanish, Jewish and more specifically Sephardi culture. Moreover, not all Penso's work has survived, as the evidence of various lost writings testifies. He stated, for example, that he had written around two hundred epistles, a genre no longer as disparaged as it was some generations ago. Although critics have tended to focus on his printed output, some surviving manuscripts also exist.2 Indeed, research among manuscript collections in Europe and the United States has revealed handwritten copies of Penso's Asire Ha-Tiqwah , probably made in Italy in the eighteenth century, of which two codices survive.3 Current research has focused on Penso's impact on Christian audiences in the Iberian peninsula. 1 The critical heritage surrounding Penso's work extends beyond pure theology and ideology, to embrace literary reception, a subject discussed in E. Gutwirth, 'The Study of Hebrew Epigraphy in Eighteenth-Century Spain', in C. Davis and P.J. Smith (eds), Art and literature in Spain 1600-1800 (London 1993), p. 135-152. Regarding Penso's place in the historiography of the stock exchange note the recent rise in interest in his Confiision de Confusiones-. O. Pringler's Confusion (Breslau 1919), followed by Geers' Dutch translation and Smith's valuable historical introduction to the Confusion (The Hague 1939). Kellenbenz's introduction to the selections of the Confiision (Boston 1952) is worth reading. A facsimile was published in Va- lencia [Saetatis] in 1977; another edition appeared with an introduction by Gonzalo Anes in Madrid in 1986; and lastly by C. Buezo et al. (Villaviciosa 2000). This repeated investment in the study and publication of his oeuvre suggests that Penso's de- tractors have yet to convince their public. 2 I hope to deal with the questions of what I would call Penso's early phase, i.e. his Sabbataianism, his Italian writings, his Hebrew compositions be- yond the Asire Ha-Tiqwah , the early circle, in a forthcoming study. For the Sephardi tradition of epistolarity in modern languages see E. Gutwirth, 'Medieval Romance Epistolography: The Case of the Iberian Jews' Neophilologus LXXXIV / 2 (April 2000) p. 207-224. 3 One at JTS and one in Berlin. 269</page><page sequence="2">ELEAZAR GUTWIRTH Although he preferred prose, Penso also wrote poetry. Members of his circle described him as meshorer or shorer. In the 1660s he contributed some idiosyncratic verse to the Hebrew sonnet tradition, as a recent collection of Hebrew poetry has shown,4 while his Spanish coplas and decimas and metrica cortesana were not unsuccess- ful. Penso wrote in several languages, in an environment in which bilingualism, or literary polyglossia, was more complex than either Kayserling or his predecessors have supposed. Unlike his Spanish contemporaries, such as Gongora and Gracian, Lope and Quevedo as well as Calderon and Tirso, who have been the subject of critical and textual studies from their own day to the present and regularly feature in Spanish syllabuses, there is no detailed body of commentary on Penso. Assertions about him therefore carry a different weight and credibility. Thus, while he was a cosmopolitan polyglot, he has been viewed from a monolingual national and nationalistic perspec- tive; and although he was a poet, it is his prose that has formed the focus of atten- tion, despite only part of his oeuvre having survived.5 In a cultural sense, Penso's roots are encapsulated in language. And this cuts to the heart of the criticism. For many readers, the main problem with Penso is his style. In his Estudios in the first half of the nineteenth century, Amador de los Rios con- demned him for being natural y sencillo , while Cecil Roth called him a poetaster. Caro Baroja linked his lineage and style, asserting that Academia had other ingenios de su mismo linaje y de igual pésimo gusto ; writing in Madrid in the 1950s he complained that Penso mezcla el barroquismo de exposición con tendencias kabalistas. Caro Baroja condemned el delirio verbal , decrying Penso's Andalusian roots and referring to his facundia andaluza .6 These aspersions gave rise to the view that the only terms on which to assess Penso were his clarity, or lack of it. However, an examination of Penso's own background - the historical community in which he lived - offers other vantage 4 On the Hebrew evidence for readers reception as well as an impressive list of admirers see J. A. Brombacher, 'Vier lofdichten uit Asire ha- Tiqwa', in H. den Boer (ed.), Mikhtam le-David: Een gulden kleinnood (Apeldoorn 1990), p. 93-104. On the Hebrew sonnet tradition see D. Bregman, Tseror Z ehuvim (Beer Sheva 1997). 5 In 1856 Inocencio da Silva spoke of the 'works of the Portuguese Jews [... whose] value and intrin- sic merits [...] is at times quite small' while at the same time affirming that the books 'are of ex- treme rarity to us'. See H. Den Boer's valuable catalogue: 'Spanish and Portuguese Editions from the Northern Netherlands in Madrid and Lisbon Public Collections', in StRos 22 (1988), p. 97-107. Nicolas Antonio in the seventeenth century had set the tone: Cipriano de Valera was 'infame'; Isaac Cardoso was a 'desertor'; Joseph de Caceres was an 'apostata'. Den Boer proves 'his lack of information on the works printed in the Nether- lands' (p. 100). Barbosa Machado writing on Abravanel uses the epithet 'delirium' for Abravanel's source, the Talmud. Den Boer points to his 'lack of a direct examination of the works'. My point here is the continuity of the same epi- thet in Caro Baroja who influenced a whole gen- eration of critics and historians of Penso. 6 J. A. Torrente Fortuno, La Bolsa en Jose de Vega (Madrid 1980). 270</page><page sequence="3">PENSO'S roots: the politics and poetics of cultural fusion points. After all, it would be wrong to assume that we do not know how Penso was received or read in his own lifetime. Contemporaries of Penso acclaimed the volume, variety and range of his output.? Orobio de Castro noted his raro entendimiento excediendo las leyes de la naturaleza , and that he had learned public speaking by the age of fifteen (i.e. c. 1665). He praised lo fecundo de la hermosa erudición. Miguel de Barrios took the theme of procreation and reproduc- tion: Con la luz de tus primores crecen de Helicon las plantas Monte cuando te levantas Vega cuando brotas flores tus lineas son las majores que Apolo a mi musa entrega Alvaro Diaz returned to the theme of nature: Nadie a las plantas te llega con el vergel de tus Hojas cuando voz fragante arrojas de tu siempre fértil vega Alferez don Diego Lopez de Almeyda repeated the notion of innovation and origi- nality, while citing the idea of fertility: Fertilize la Vega hasta la cumbre del Sacro Monte Fuente de Hipocrene Con el Pindó Feliz que en Josseph tiene nuevo Apolo que esparce nueva lumbre Diego Silvera returned to the theme of excess in a variation on the topos of ineffabil- ity, asserting that modesty was misplaced: Como cabra en mis razones si en mi admiración no cabe Readers of Penso's texts have therefore responded with radically different views: some emphasising his range, fertility, creativity and erudition, while for others Penso represented race, delirium and obscurity. To outline the contours and context of the traditions and models on which his oeuvre was founded it is perhaps useful to examine Penso's family background. Fortunately, precisely dated texts provide this information. Penso wrote two funeral orations: one for his mother in July 1679 and one for his father in February 1683. 7 The contrast between the facility of totalising judgements on the one hand and the lack of evi- dence for access to or detained reading of Penso's corpus [by the critics] on the other makes the condemnations of Penso a curious critical phe- nomenon. Torrente Fortuno seems to have intu- ited some of the intriguing quality and irregulari- ties of the criticism and began the task of collect- ing critiques such as those of Amador and others in his La bolsa [...] p. 46fr. 271</page><page sequence="4">ELEAZAR GUTWIRTH A consideration of the composition of these two orations, and Penso's subsequent decision to publish them, raises the subject of rhetoric, as do the wealth of allusions and the difficulties presented by his oeuvre. The titles alone, with their repeated use of terms such as oracion and discurso suggest a preoccupation with the spoken word, although this may reflect a modern prejudice that the Jewish or Judeo-Spanish tradition was primarily rhetorical. Does this apparent disorder indicate a regional culture, or the unpolished rhetoric of discursos and oraciones ? Penso's supposed Andalusian influences were referred to by Caro Baroja - who complained of his facundia andaluza. But gongorist prose is less disparaged now than it was before the generation of 1927 began rehabilitating the Andalusian author of Polifemo, with whom Penso was once compared. Today, it is generally recognised that however elaborate their style, it is still possible to discover a certain coherence in the early seventeenth-century poets of Cordoba and Antequera.8 This has implications for an appreciation of the authors of Spanish texts in Am- sterdam, many of whom, like Orobio Prado, Penso or Barrios, apparently originated from that region. This aesthetic sensibility is epitomised in the Andalusian taste for the Latin poet Statius (ad 45-96). The metre of his Silvae was cultivated by Spanish writers in Andalusia and later became the Baroque form par excellence for authors such as Quevedo, Calderon and Lope. Its influence was felt in every theme and every region, as far as Latin America. Statius used all the resources of rhetoric to flatter his audience; his Baroque imitators preferred hyperbole and scholarly refer- ences, as Penso's texts show. Beside elegies and compositions on death, the Silvae also include humorous poetry. The genre allowed the poet to appear to improvise and digress with elaborate profusion - for which Penso was later to be criticised. In fact this genre was employed throughout Spain for funeral orations. De Barrios himself used the form in 1686 to salute the illustrious genios of Lisbon in his Triumpho académico: Silva en alabanca de los ilustres ingenios de Lisboa que compusieron el libro titulado Aplausos académicos. Recent research on Andalusia's academies has discussed the similarity of poetic elaborations on the popular motif of music and painting. In his funeral orations Penso employed this theme. His associate Daniel Levi de Barrios had composed a Comedia entitled Contra la verdad no hay fuerca around 1665. This 160-page volume contained a Panegirico a los tres bienaventurados mártires Abraham Athias, Tahacob Rodriguez Casares, Raquel Nunez Fernandez que fueron quemados vivos en Cordoba por sanctificar la unidad divina. It opens with a Dedicatoria to Penso's father. Stanzas of eight hendecasyllabic lines produce an elevated effect appropriate for this ottava rima panegyric. It culmi- 8 These have been collected by Torrente from Fineza de la amistad ; cf.

The generic title is not insignificant. In 1625 Hortênsio Paravicino published his Panegirico funeral и oracion funebre del Senor Felipe Hi. It led to an aggressive, anonymous reply attacking his culteranismo or gongorismo. Jauregui came to his defence in an Apologia por la verdad of no less than eight pages containing an erudite justification of the phrase oracion funebre. Paravicino claimed to be an innovator in the genre. He responded to his detractors that El sentimiento mayor de los que carecieron de este genio [...] es contra la novedad de las Oraciones fúnebres (those who lack genius are most deeply opposed to the innovation of the funeral oration).10 Orations had reemerged in the fifteenth century among several genres cultivated by humanists and inspired by classical models - such as the epistle and the preface - featuring short, discrete interrelated prose. The catalogues of Latin incunabula reflect this growth in the latter half of the century. In recent decades Hispanists have emphasised the genre's significance in vernacular Iberian literature from the late fifteenth century on. I have argued elsewhere that Iberian Jews were among those who cultivated oratory in this period. By the mid-sixteenth century Sephardi Jews were being praised as great orators in the Ottoman Empire. This theme is found in a panegyric to Gedalyah ibn Yahia in Salónica in the 1560s and in Shevet Yehudah , 9 On the Andalusian Silva see A. Egido, Silva de Andalucía (Malaga 1990). 10 In the oration to his mother he writes: 'Sirvan os pues de Tumbas las Harpas ya que os sirven las lagrimas de ríos que yo acompanandoos en la sensible perdida que lloro colgando sin esperança mi Harpa para formar caudaloso el rio hare que sea incesable mi llanto. O Harpa desdichada ¡suspendida a los rigores de una Harpia! si hasta ahora fuyste el dulce instrumento para mi musica ya no servirás sino de triste instrumento para mi desdicha'. Here Penso addresses poetic analogies of music and pain, or painful memories. The tomb is the icon of memory and pain. For Penso the pain was the loss of his mother, but also the Jewish loss of liberty and sovereignty. The connection of litera- ture and music is as old as the myth of Orpheus, but recent research may help elucidate the con- text of Penso's directions more precisely. Egido {op. cit., p. 41ÍI) notes the focus on Seville of early 17th-century Spanish Baroque. Juan de Arguijo wrote two Silvae copied in a manuscript in Seville in 1 61 2. One is dedicated 'a la vihuela'. In the 'Oda ad florem' Gnidi exclaims: 'sois por ventura la famosa lira / del que al mar arrojado / supo aplacar su ira /'. The line indebted to Garcilaso appeals to notions which come from Propertius' Elegies I / lib. 2. Arguijo's verse features 'orfismo' and 'planteamientos musicales'. Luis de Leon's 'Oda a Salinas' is another famous precedent. Arguijo believes that the sensation of harmony is false because once the instrument is laid to rest the bitter memories reappear. In fact Arguijo is said to have played the discante. For Barrios's en- comium of Penso's father see his Contra la verdad no ay fuerca (Amsterdam: David Castro Tartaz, 16 Tammuz 5425). A.

To which he replies: it is el sentimiento which is influencing la memorial He continues Ire pues leyendo : he cannot speak without reading the text from emotion. The implica- tion being that he had been reciting from memory and that he only switched to reading from the text at this point. But of course that is not the case. Penso is simply searching for another way to express his depth of feeling. The incoherent words and the ellipses are not a mark of uncontrolled, unpolished and spontaneous delirium but a graphic and literary representation of rhetorical incoherence in a controlled writ- ten and printed environment. Penso used ellipsis elsewhere too. In another work that appeared in the same year that the oration was published: Rumbos peligrosos , contain- ing Penso's Retratos de la confusion which describes the behaviour of Flora, a heroine of a courtly novel: [...] proseguio Flora a desmayarse llama ... da por ... su ... pru ... den ... cia el pro ... di ... gio y ... y ... y. Here Penso attempts to represent the words of a woman fainting. This use of ellipsis suggests two possible avenues. One is an intense preoccupation with language, its concrete description or representation in extreme situations: language at the limit. In the context of Spanish literature, this expressionism is reminiscent of St John of the Cross's Cantico espirìtuah Un no se que que quedan balbuciendo ,14 The difficulty of even approaching the full implication of the original is revealed in translations such as Roy Campbell's 'babbling I know not what'.15 The author's aim is to express inco- herence and explore the limits of language. Wilhemse, for example, refers to the history of mysticism and cognitive psychology to explain the verse. For her, the line concerns 'the negative moment of confrontation with the limitations inherent in human speech [...] the stage of the unintelligible utterances the stammering referred to in Sanjuanist poetry'. 16 John of the Cross explains in a prose commentary on his own poem: 11 On traditional Hispano-Jewish attitudes to lan- guage, rhetoric and oratory see E.

It reflects a thread that appears to run throughout his work: theatrical effect. Thus the dialogue in the stock exchange description echoes the mise en scene in his orations or Discursos. Following the death of his father in 1683, Penso noted in reference to his own writings: [...] atajo la muerte de mi venerable padre los impulsos deste buelo conque se halla la pluma mas prompta a llorar tragedias verdaderas que a machinar ideas fabulosas [...] In this passage Penso contrasts the two products of his pen: llorar tragedias verdaderas and machinar ideas fabulosas. The contrast is of course rhetorical. Both notions are borrowed from theatre - self-evidendy in the case of tragedias. But also machinar , synonymous with tramoya - the staging apparatus of the age of Calderon and Penso. In his Discursos Martinez de Mata praised this art form. A fascination with the machinery of the stage is evident from references to tramoyas (such as pulleys and lighting) among numerous seventeenth-century Spanish writers, as Maravall has shown.18 Naturally, any funeral oration written in this period must inevitably be compared to the immensely successful Oraisons fúnebres of Bossuet. One key aspect is the repre- sentation of women: in Bossuet's case, Henriette Marie; in Penso's, Esther Penso. Another is the theatrical presentation. Bossuet was well known for his histrionic effects. Scholars have studied his preaching methods: delivering a sermon to nuns on the theme of the Cross, for example, he spoke holding a cross in his hands; in 1692 preaching at his cathedral on a verse from Revelations - 'there was a silence in heaven for half an hour' - he suggests that this represents the time of the delibera- tions of divine justice and asks: va-t-elle punir va-t-elle attendre encore? at which Bossuet paused as if waiting for a decision from heaven. His notes for the sermon read: se taire durant quelque temps comme en attente de ce qui sera decide. Standring describes him as: 'a popular preacher [...] ready to resort to [...] the dramatic [...] in the interest of the cure of the souls'.^ Chronologically the first of Penso's two compositions is the funeral oration to his mother. The titlepage states: Oración funebre de Josseph Penso En las exequias de su prudente y virtuosa madre Dona Ester Penso Que llevo Dios en 27 de Tamuz Ano de 5439 Corresponde a 7 de Julio Ano de 1679 17 Commentary to Cantico espiritual , ed. E. Pacho, (Madrid 1981), p. 678. 18 Rumbos peligrosos, (Amberes 1683), p. 296. In a pro- logue to a 'fe de erratas' he writes: 'promete seis novelas y paro en tres el desempeño porque atajo la muerte de mi venerable padre los impulsos deste buelo [...]'. The evidence for machinar and the connection between economic and theatrical thought forestalling the industrial revolution is discussed in J.A.

Ano MDCLXXXIII Funeral Oration by Josseph Penso in the exequies of his prudent and virtuous mother Dona Esther Penso whom God took on the 27 Tamuz of the year 5439 which corresponds to the seventh of July 1679. He composed the Oration in Livorno at the famous and notable Academy of the Sitibundos in Amsterdam. At the House of Jacob of Cordoba in the year 1683. Penso was therefore in Livorno in July 1679, and in August he delivered the oration at the Academia de los Sitibundos, also in Livorno. The speech begins with a thema and ends with the words: llegue y a [la Luz eterna] como lo desseamos. Since the early homiletic midrashim it has been conventional to open a speech with a biblical verse - here from Lamentations. The conclusion referring to the hope for the speedy arrival of the luz eterna or yom she kulo or is another traditional stylistic feature. It was customary in Hebrew (and non-Hebrew) homilies to close on a messianic note, as described in liturgical codifications such as the fourteenth-century work by Abudarham.20 Amid the extraordinary profusion of metaphors, conceits and hyperbole of Penso's address, there is one glaring omission. Indeed, it is the most noticeable feature of the whole piece: the total lack of information about Penso's mother. Penso seems to have been so preoccupied with his literary effort that he almost forgot to mention her. Apart from stating that she was prudent and virtuous, little is said about when and where she was born, what she did, how she died or anything else about her. This contrasts sharply with Penso's address at his father's funeral, whose realistic elements - homely and sensitive - have provided fertile terrain for the author's biographers. Penso referred to this himself, noting Calle pues la lengua los excessos de la Fama.21 Elsewhere, alluding to Moses, he writes that his mother's death was a golpe , a blow from which salieron gotas , while that of his father was a golpe from which salieron nos.22 In part, this is a question of genre. Employing the title Oración funebre in the seventeenth century was itself a statement about genre and style. Throughout the century, the discussion about this form of rhetoric centred on whether it was sacred or profane and on how to balance the requirements of paroenesis and a panegyric. Sephardim had composed commemorative addresses since metred Hebrew poetry first emerged in the eleventh and twelfth centuries. Ibn Gabirol's compositions on the death of Yequtiel, for example, are classics of Jewish literature. Ibn Gabirol mourned his death not only as a private loss but as a catastrophe touching all Jews and affecting the entire world. In fact the Hispano-Jewish perception of death re- 20 E.

Because his mother died in the month of Tammuz, the sheloshim coincided with the month of Av, the traditional time of mourning for the destruction of the Temple. This added poignancy to what had become an estab- lished tradition of elevating a person's death by linking it to the sorrow of all Jews. Ibn Gabirol's elegy on the death of Yequtiel, Biyeme yequtiel asher nigmaru , six hundred years earlier employed a similar effect.24 For Penso, the general sorrow was for the loss of soberania (sovereignty) and libertad (freedom): he connected the death of his mother with the loss of national freedom and sovereignty through the patriarchal name of Israel. O tristes Ysraelitas que / auspiciándoos el nombre de Ysrael la Soberania / perdiendo la libertad no os ha quedado de lo que erays ni el nombre [...] Language is linked here with politics: the name and the political status of Jewry. Indeed, a logical conclusion would be that a change of name would lead to a change in political status. Thus referring to Jews as ysraelitas, israeliten or israelites would have a political effect. 25 23 E. Gutwirth, 'Muerte y Mentalidad hispano- judia' (ed. С.

See the English translation in T. Oelman, Marrano Poets of the Seventeenth Cen- tury (East Brunswick 1982), p. 62. In 'En alabanza del Senor' politics and culture are linked through images which oppose but also unite the emblem- atic 'duro marmol' to poetry or 'llanto': 'al duro marmol enternece el llanto - y con el se endurece el fiero echo - o duro Oficio quien te llama Santo /', p. 123 (idem, p. 78). The 'Canción aplicando misericordias divinas y defetos proprios a la salida de Egipto hasta la Tierra Santa' again associates spaces of political geography with freedom / ser- vitude and with poetry: 'En este fiero Egito / de mi pecado donde el alma mia / padece la tirana servidumbre [...]'. It ends: 'Canción mientras no puedo / la voz formar que el tiempo no corrompa / ni tocar con el dedo / que no se canse ni las cuerdas rompa / el arpa santa el son si diferente / siempre al oido me sera presente' (idem, p. 124). In his Academias morales de las musas in 1642 Enriquez Gomez writes: 'cuando contemplo mi pasada gloria no tengo no segura confianza / de ver lo que perdi [...] / [...] perdi mi libertad perdi mi nido / perdi mi alma el centro mas dichoso / y a mi mismo también pues me ha perdido / (idem, p. 140). Here the ancient (e.g. in Greek poetry) basic image of the 'poet- as -bird' effects a transition (through the nido) to the political space and the concept of 'libertad'. Po- etic language is inextricably bound with the conversos political status since the loss of 'estimación' was accompanied by a loss of literary style: 'perdi mi estimación [...] del cortesano estilo noble llave' (idem, p. 142). In 'La oracion y muerte de Sanson' (1644?) those key areas of Penso's text [tirania yugo dura potencia] are pre- figured in a poetic rendering of Biblical history: 'Yo me ofrezco a la muerte porque sea - redimido mi pueblo en este dia / de la dura 277</page><page sequence="10">ELEAZAR GUTWIRTH Penso did not go that far, but the link between national imagery and the use of the name Israel in linguistic cultural practice is clear. In fact, in Penso's texts these cultural constructions are hybrid rather than pure. This aspect of the construction of a national identity in a Jewish text in a European language is reflected in the lines immediately following. This passage contains a development on a fluvial theme. The anthropomorphic description of rivers is an ancient motif that can be traced in modern European literature to Petrarch's allegory on Africa. Ancient midrashic texts appear to lie at the root of a negative vision of the Perat, or Euphrates and the exile under Nebuchadenezzar - these complain that the river was malodorous and poisonous. Miraos en essas piadosas olas del Eufrates y vereis que borrando con la coniente a cada passo vuestra efigie solicitan no ser espejo de vuestra miseria. O miseria no hallar quien sea espejo a tan gran desgracia por no hallar quien haya sido espejo a tan gran rubina. Sino es que conciderandoos[!] a cada punto tan diferentes de lo que erays os significan que a cada momento soys différentes de lo que soys empiessan a representaros vuestra imagen en sus cristalinas luzes y huyendo misteriosas antes de proporcionar el retrato os advierten que vuestra misma imagen no es la vuestra. Look at yourself in these pious waters of the Euphrates and you shall see that by erasing your effigy with every step they ask not to be a mirror of your misery. Oh misery to be unable to find a mirror for such great disgrace, not to find a mirror which had witnessed such great ruin. It is because they consider you so different from what you had been that they signify at every moment that you are different from what you are. Therefore they begin to represent your image in their crystalline lights, but mysteriously flee before they provide the portrait. They are telling you that even your appearance is not yours. Traditionally, orations written for the month of mourning were composed as la- ments. Penso wrote in Spanish and like every writer he faced the abyss of the empty page. But while a lament was governed by certain rules, how could a mourner grieve in Spanish? Virgil's second Eclogue contains an imitation of two Idylls of Theocritus, the third and the eleventh in which the Cyclops Polyphemus laments Galatea's cruelty. potencia filistea / arbitrio de la misma tirania / sacuda el yugo de la nación hebrea /' (idem, p. 172). Penso's account of the history of his father recalls the 'Romance al divin mártir Juda Creyente martirizado en Valladolid por la Inquisición' written on the martyrdom of Lope de Vera y Alarcon 1644 (idem, p. 176). Similar events to those of Penso's father's life are thought to be legitimate themes for poetic development '[...] circuncidóse en la cárcel / cual otro Abraham el mesmo / escribiendo con su sangre / el caracter mas supremo /' (ibid. p. 176). The peculiarity of this use of the term 'libertad' is revealed by con- trasting with other usages such as that in the pref- ace to Boileau's Satires (1666): '[...] faire ses ex- cuses aux auteurs qui pourront etre choques de la liberte qu'il s'est donnee de parler de leurs outrages [...] le Parnasse fut de tout temps un pays de liberte [...] l'auteur ne les citera point devant d'autre tri- bunal que celui des Muses [...]' 278</page><page sequence="11">PENSO'S roots: the politics and poetics of cultural fusion Corydon the shepherd [...] alone in fruitless passion [...] flings artless strains to the hills and the woods: on the shore the other day I looked at myself when by grace of the winds the sea was at peace and still. With you for judge I should fear not Daphnis if the mirror never lies.26 These lines were remarked on by Virgil's earliest commentator in late antiquity. He was evidently troubled by them, particularly the idea of the sea being able to reflect a face. He suggested it might be possible in a sheltered lagoon, but that it would be impossible for the sea to reflect an image. Ascensius broadened the discussion. He discussed the nature of reflection itself, claiming that no image is perfect: even in a mirror an image is reversed and in water an oar that is intact appears to be bro- ken.2? In the sixteenth century, critics such as Garcilaso suggested: No soy pues bien mikado, / tan disforme ni feo / que aun agora me veo / en esta agua que corre clara y pura.20 While Penso would certainly have read Gongora, who wrote: Marítimo alción roca eminente / sobre sus huevos coronaba el dia / que espejo de zafiro fue luciente / la playa azul de la persona mia / Mireme y lucir vi un sol en mi frente / cuando en el cielo un ojo se veia / neutra el agua dudaba a cual fe preste / o al cielo humano o al ciclope celeste. 29 Polyphemus saw his reflection in the calm sea, the image of his single eye rivalling that of the sun and raising confusion: his perception was ambiguous and unclear.^0 It was therefore with Virgil that the connection between reflection and lament originated. The relevance of the theme to compositions about death and funereal orations can be seen in Garcilaso's Egloga segunda on the death of Bernaldino de Toledo: Oh claras ondas como veo [...] en viéndoos [...] en vuestra claridad vi mi alegria escurecer se today enturbiarse ß1 In the inner logic of the pastoral, the clear waters of the Arcadian landscape reflect images in times of joy and happiness, but not in times of sadness and grief; then the image is obscure and turbia. In the Iberian Jewish culture of Penso, his antecedents and his audience and readers, the Jewish pastoral was a familiar feature. This vision of Arcadia was one in which shepherds engaged in constant discussions of the subtler points of Torah. Usque's Jewish Arcadia, in his Portuguese Consolacam , contained crystalline waters (en maym elah Torah) which reflected an image in times of joy. Nestas agoas espelhandose se alegravan verense [laariba] no envoltorio dos que vivem tizouro dos justos.32 26 Virgil, Eclogues, ed. H. Rushton, (London 1978), p. п. 27 P.J.

In the six- teenth century the printing press provided easier access to Virgil's texts, with com- mentaries in the margins. Spanish and Portuguese writers borrowed these forms of lament and melancholy, producing eclogues, pastorals and similarly expressive gen- res. In Penso's day, readers would have been familiar with these cultural styles. Penso adopted the classical tradition of the lament from modern European literature, with its decorous motif of reflection and veracity. But he changed it completely. Reflec- tion, originally in the Mediterranean, later in Garcilaso's pure and crystalline waters of Italy's pastoral landscape and with Gongora's mythological allusions, was given a new setting. Penso mentioned Zephyrus and clear waters, as Gongora had, but with a difference. It was the Euphrates, the métonymie of exile, and the Diaspora as a whole which provided the location for reflection. And whereas love was the cause of lament in the classical tradition, Penso transposed the form into a political statement of collective loss. He debated whether a true external representation could ever be found, but linked it inexorably to the political loss of soberania and libertad. As I have stated elsewhere33 the question of reality and representation is certainly not marginal in Penso's work. Some years after his orations, the theme reemerged in his Problema curioso . In fact it is also relevant to his economic oeuvre. Rather than resolve the apparent differences between Penso's purely literary work and his eco- nomic work, critics have emphasised the lack of coherence. They have accepted the anecdotal statements of intent on the titlepages, even though a closer examination of the text shows that Penso returned to the theme of representation in the 'Dialogo Segundo' of the Confusion de confusiones and proclaims its relevance to that most 'solid' and objective of subjects - money and price: Philosopho: La experiencia nos ensena que el que mira en el agua turbia su imagen se le representa la imagen tan turbia como el agua tenemos ocupado el entendimiento con los embaraços de las acciones; [...] Pero dexemos estos disparates de la imaginación y sepamos (si no os sirviere de molestia accionista amigo) con que nuebas suben las acciones y con que nuebas baxan. The Accionista replies: Este es un nudo tan indissoluble que no hay espada de Alexandro que se atreva a cortarlo pues hazen las acciones tal alarde de tener algo de divinas que cuanto mas se discurre en ellas menos se entienden y cuando mas se sutiliza mas se yerra. No hay cosa como comprar o vender a ciegas hazer poco [...] pagar la diferencia (a que llamamos Surplus que significa en francés la demasia). E.

Diaz Esteban (ed.), Literatura Castellana de los Judios, (Ma- drid 1994), p. 185-192. 280</page><page sequence="13">PENSO'S roots: the politics and poetics of cultural fusion The philosopher abandons the realm of disparates de la imaginación in favour of saber. But this simple contrast is soon undermined. Prices rise and fall as a result of nuebas - language and gossip. In the inner logic of the text the only reality is 'blindness' [a degas) and Surplus , or demasia , along with the cosmopolitan European fusion of cul- tures in a discurrir recalling classical references (the Gordian knot) and surplus in English and French. Penso's readers would have recognised the political references to libertad and tirania as echoes of the conventions of seventeenth-century converso poetry, with its analogies and references to the relative religious freedom Jews enjoyed outside the Iberian peninsula in cities such as Hamburg, Amsterdam and Livorno. He contrasts Amster- dam's Jewish community and the tyranny of the Spanish and Portuguese Inquisi- tions. These concerns were far from trivial, even in the 1670s and 80s, years after the Penso family had escaped and settled in freedom. They formed a central part of the message of the oration for his mother, and even more so of that for his father. The theme of his father's name and that of the Jewish nation is not confined to this oration. It occurs in the funeral oration for his mother Esther Penso, and even perhaps in the repeated allusions to Espqo (mirror) and to a small town near Cor- doba, thought by some to be where Don Isaac Penso was born. They are linked in his writings to the contrast of Judaism and Catholicism, a life of hiding and a life of openly professed religion. His father's funeral oration is described in the titlepage as: Oración funebre de Josseph Penso En las Exequias de su Honrado y Virtuoso Padre Ishak Penso Felix Que llevo Dios en 28 de Sebat Ano de 5443 Corresponde a 24 de Febrero Ano de 1683. Hizola en 26 de Marco en Amsterdam En la Yesiba de Keter Torah que tiene en su Casa. En Amsterdam En Casa de Yahacob de Cordova Ano MDCLXXXIII It seems that after the death of Esther Penso in 1679 the family moved to Amsterdam where they set up a yeshiva in their house and where his father died in February 1683. Penso described his father in greater detail in the second oration. Penso's elabo- rate discussions on his father's age at the time of his death reveal that he must have been born around 1608. He starts by mentioning that he was compasivo and implies that he gave limosna. He and his brothers used to visit their father when he was ill. They knew that he was dying but hoped that it would not be en la Primavera sino en el Otoño. This suggests that he became ill as early as the spring of 1682, between March and June. In his oration, Penso developed the notion of a return to childhood after the death of his father. Without their mother, he and his brothers are inconsolable. He cites the talmudic dictum: Yahacob nuestro padre no murió ( Ya'aqov avinu lo met). The funeral was a teatro de tragedias. Although set in conventional terms, he seems to be describing his father's body: [...] la Calavera vaya perdiendo con el tiempo las facciones [...] llevándole los dientes los anos nevándole los cabellos los Heneros ya cegándole los ojos los estudios ya desviandole los recreos 281</page><page sequence="14">ELEAZAR GUTWIRTH los achaques y ya emudeciendole la lengua las suspensiones [...] de que puede quexarse quien vivió feliz todo lo que podia vivid [...] He wonders what more a person could want from life than to die slowly in old age [...] a que las Alas se remonten todo [lo que] quieren sin que la tirania las corte. A discussion of his father's life would have been incomplete without mentioning libertad and tirania - a key theme in the family history and that of his father. His father emulated Jacob: [...] tanto en la virtud como en la peregrinación [...] muriendo antes de morir por lo fatigado [...] vivió a respeto de las edades de su siglo mas anos que Jacob en tiempos que eran mucho mayores las edades. Padeció tantas molestias como Jacob pues pide en su Testamento a Dios que sirvan los trabajos de expiación a los delitos [..-]34 This relates to the fact that until the age of twenty-five, Isaac Penso had lived as a Catholic. Here again tirania plays a major role in Penso's account of his father's life: [...] vivio forcado el primer tercio de la vida fingiendo violentado lo que seguia y ocultando tiranizado lo que profíessava. Que mayor prueva de ser una Tirania la que le impedia el sossiego y de ser una violencia la que le estorvava la felicidad [...] His father's life was exemplary, not least his concrete resistance to tirania - fasting on Yom Kippur and circumcising himself with a bone in the Inquisition jail: [...] campeando lo religioso entre las tenebrosidades de lo Tirano ayunar en la Inquisición el Santo dia de Kipur que fue lo que le puso en peligro la Libertad y circuncidarse dentro de la misma Inquisición con un huesso que fue lo que le puso en riesgo la Vida? Here, language - lengua - the main area of critical condemnation of Penso relates to history: Y quien huvo que se governasse con mas constancia en estos trabajos? con mas atención en estas miserias? con mas Acierto en estos Yerros? Pidió a Dios que no fuesse su lengua causa de verse ninguno en esa desdicha y tuvo la dicha de no haver padecido nadie aquellas incomparables penas por su lingua.35 Similarly, the basic component of language - naming - relates to the historical pattern that dominated his father's life, as perceived and constructed by Penso: Entonces prometio de llamarse Ishak si lo librasse Dios de aquellas tinieblas diziendo que por la resolución que havia tomado de dar la vida por su padre [...] era justo que se llamasse Ishak Meanwhile, the lament and paroenesis are linked (unlike in Penso's oration for his mother) with actual historical facts: Salio al cabo de algunos anos deste horrifero sepulcro y echándolo a Galeras la Emulación acredito con propiedad el titulo de primer poco en las Galeras [...] Hizo voto de entrar en dentro de un ano en Judaismo propusiéronle conveniencias para Amberes [...] passo en veynte y quatro horas de - Aver de Gracia a Zelanda viage tan singular que mas pareció vuelo que и Oraciones , p. 52.

According to Penso, his father's illness was diagnosed by Orobio de Castro, whom he calls el Insigne Orobio . Penso's teacher was Aboab, called here mori we-rabbi. The latter visited his father on his deathbed and encouraged and consoled him. Penso recalls that the rabbi said: Que si el vulgo divulgava que Ishak Penso estava malo о que Ishak Penso moria que Ishak Penso asegurava que ni estava malo ni moria Ishak Penso. This offers a rare insight into the speech of Penso's teachers and acquaintances. It suggests that this differed only in degree to the hyperbole of their literature. Thus equivoques, puns and etymological figures were used in spoken as well as written form (e.g., el vulgo divulga). Similarly, Aboab's words suggest the verbal use of antithesis or chiasmus. At one point Penso's father fell into a coma or letargo , awaking to state that he could die happy in the knowledge that he was still of sound mind and able to bless God, that he left his sons as adults, as herederos and teachers, and that su cuerpo no havia padecido martirios. Isaac Penso's qualities were not those of a scholar, the expectations of scholarship being specific to time and place. No le falto [...] mas que ser Sabio en la Sagrada Ley [...] Suplió con el desseo el Estudio no hallando libro Devoto que no leyesse y no encontrando Sabio agradable que no comunicasse [...] no contento con asistir a ellas tan puntual como cuydadoso transporto la [...] de estos haberim ha tantos anos a su casa.36 In other words, he regularly participated in synagogue, he read ethics and conversed with hakhamim and scholars. In this sketch of his father's intellectual life Penso reveals his own perspective. He distances himself from his father, who participated in the community, attended the yeshiva, conversed with hakhamim and haberim , and read devotional literature. For Penso, it was not enough to be a Sabio en la Sagrada Ley. He had been raised in a home in which the best rooms were reserved for a school. He refers to Aboab as mori we-rabbi. In his youth Hebrew was the main vehicle for creativity. In fact, language is the key to understanding Penso's work, and that of his contemporaries. For Penso, the turning point was the death of his uncle and mother in Livorno, the composition of the Carta or Epistle to Orobio and the oration to his father: the late 1670s and early 1 680s saw a transition from Hebrew to Spanish, to elevated literary compositions in a modern European language. He did not need special lessons to learn Hebrew.37 Nor was Spanish a transitional phase towards an idealised Hebrew monoglossia. On the contrary, Hebrew preceded Spanish. Thus Penso's roots lay in a culture at the dawn of the modern age, the culture of the humanistae whose search for patronage revived the ancient art of short prose, of З6 Idem, p. 71. 37 As suggested by Caro Baroja, op. cit. 283</page><page sequence="16">ELEAZAR GUTWIRTH orations and epistles, classical theatre and an active Christian Kabbalah linked to the ancient schools of Pythagoras and the Gnostics. While taking these factors into account, earlier traditions may explain the links between various disciplines in Penso's texts. Recent research has shown how Jews in medieval Spain expressed views on the connection between politics and language centuries before Nebrixa's famous la lengua companera del imperio .з8 For Penso, libertad was more than freedom from the Prision de amor or a feature in the Land of Parnassus. It was not only Valla who combined philology and philosophy, Nebrixa and his followers and readers did so too. Penso attempted to deal with the issue of represen- tation, of language at its limits.
