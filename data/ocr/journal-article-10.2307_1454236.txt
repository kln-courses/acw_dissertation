<plain_text><page sequence="1">JOSEPHUS' COMMENTARY ON GENESIS As the earliest extant systematic paraphrase and exposition of the Bible (unless we except the Septuagint), the first half of Josephus' Antiquities is of prime importance. Josephus' statement (Ant. 1. 17) that he has neither added to, nor omitted anything from, the Biblical narrative is, of course, something of a hyperbole. Yet we lack a comprehensive study that might tell us precisely what changes Josephus has made. Rappaport' has attempted to note Midrashic parallels, but he is far from exhaustive, and he has omitted all consideration of the stylistic changes made by Josephus. Thus Franxman2 is the first to attempt to analyze any sizable portion of Josephus' work and to compare it with its Biblical source, Philo, the Targumim, the Pseudepigrapha, and the Midrashim. He has on the whole carefully noted changes in detail, especially stylistic ones. His conclu- sion, which seems well substantiated, is that in ten segments of his narrative of Genesis Josephus noticeably expands the Biblical account; in twelve segments he compresses, shortens, or omits Biblical matter, and in twelve others he strikes a more or less even balance between his version and the original. For this collection of data we must be grateful to Franxman, but at the same time we must express disappointment because he has missed numerous changes made by Josephus and has not answered the gnawing questions as to why Josephus claims not to have modified the Biblical acccount when he has manifestly done so, why he exhibits such a variety in his treatment of the Bible, and why he so often chooses to deviate from known exegetical traditions. A few examples of Franxman's omissions may be in order. Thus he fails to note that at the very beginning of his account of creation Josephus (Ant. 1. 27) uses the verb cKTICTEV, "founded, built, brought into being," for the word K13, rather than the Septuagint's noirioev, "made," since the former implies more clearly creatio ex nihilo, whereas the latter implies creatio ex aliquo. Franxman (p. 39) notes that in translating Gen. 1:2 Josephus (Ant. 1. 27) says that "a breath from above sped," which recalls the effort made by the Targumim to interpret this breath as something distinct from God Himself. A glance at the Septuagint would have enabled Franxman to see that the real problem is the anthropomorphism implied by the word nrlD'n, which the Septuagint partially eliminates by saying that the breath of God "was borne" upon the water. The connotation of the word nDrn'n is not merely hovering but also brooding, with the image that the world-egg was hatched, as it were, from fluid chaos. Josephus, presumably because he feared that such an image would be regarded as grotesque Salomo Rappaport, Agada und Exegese bei Flavius Josephus (Wien, 1930). 2 Thomas W. Franxman, Genesis and the "Jewish Antiquities" of Flavius Josephus (Rome, 1979). (Biblica et Orientalia, 35).</page><page sequence="2">122 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW by his Greek audience, avoids it by using a word which implies only that the breath sped rapidly over the surface of the earth. Franxman (p. 39) fails to explain the fact that Josephus (Ant. 1. 28) has omitted reference to Gen. 1:5, which declares that "there was evening and there was morning, one day," a passage which presents difficulties because the Jewish day did not end at sunrise (and so it is not possible to understand this clause as meaning that the evening and the morning formed the first day), and because it is hard to understand how there could be evening before the day on which light was created. Josephus avoids these problems by omitting this difficult statement altogether and by noting merely that God named the dawn of the light morning and its cessation evening, as does the Bible. Sometimes Josephus adds information to the meager and even telegraphic account of the Bible, so as to make it more intelligible to his Greek audience, or so that they will understand more fully the processes described there. Thus in Gen. 1:6 God says, "Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters." The Hebrew is obscure, and the commentators are puzzled. Josephus, as Franxman fails to note, seeking to avoid the charge of obscurity made by Jew-haters (cf., e.g. Juvenal 14. 102), explains (Ant. 1. 30) that what God did was to set the heavens above the universe and to congeal ice about it; he thus explains the origin of rain, which in the Biblical account is left unexplained. From the Biblical account (Gen. 1:9) one might conclude that the earth existed before creation, since according to it God says, "Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear." Josephus, as Franxman again fails to note, resolves this ambiguity by stating explicitly (Ant. 1. 31) that on the third day God established (orCTIt) the earth, pouring the sea around it. A most striking device used by Josephus in his narrative is to present it in terms familiar to his Greek audience. Thus in rewording the Biblical account of the creation of the waters (Gen. 1:9), Josephus (Ant. 1. 31), by saying that God poured (dvax%ag) the sea around the earth, comes very close to Ovid's (Meta- morphoses 1. 36-37) formulation that "whoever of the gods it was who created the world" bade the waters to "surround the shores of the encircled earth" (ambitae circumdare litora terrae). This is another point missed by Franxman (p. 42). Again, fearing that his readers might regard as mythical the great sea-monsters (the Leviathan and its mate, according to Rabbinic tradition) mentioned in the Hebrew account of creation (Gen. 1:21), a view that would certainly be held by the Epicureans in his audience, Josephus says merely (Ant. 1. 32) that God created "the creatures that swim." Again, Franxman (p. 45) has no mention of this. The fact that Josephus uses the word 6rqtoupyei when he speaks of God's creation of four-footed creatures, whereas the Bible (Gen. 1:24) says, "Let the earth bring forth the living creatures after its kind," should immediately remind the reader of Plato's familiar picture of the 65lItoupy6g, the artificer who creates</page><page sequence="3">JOSEPHUS ON GENESIS-FELDMAN the visible world in Plato's Timaeus. Again, Franxman misses this modification and reference. The Rabbis realized the problem inherent in the use of the plural "Let us make man in our image" (Gen. 1:26), and they explain that before creating man God took counsel with the angels (Gen. Rabbah 8. 3-7). Philo (De opificio mundi 72) inferred from this passage a plurality of 6rlptoupyoi, just as Plato (Timaeus 41 C, 42 E) spoke of the Creator as having collaborators. The classical Christian commentators generally found in the use of this plural an allusion to the Trinity. But, as Rashi notes, the use of the singular verb in the next verse, "And God created man," shows that there was only a single Creator. Nonetheless, in the list of the changes (B.Meg. 9a) which according to the Rabbis the translators of the Septuagint were inspired by God to make, we note that this verse is changed to "I shall make man," presumably to prevent the reader from concluding that more than one Power created man. Elsewhere (Contra Apionem 2. 192) Josephus states that God performed His work of creation without assistants, for He has no need of them. Here, too (Ant. 1. 32)-a point missed by Franxman-he avoids this problem and the consequent misunderstandings by reporting simply that "on this day also He formed man." Moreover, the classical Jewish commentators were well aware that God's words (Gen. 1:26) "Let us make man in our image, after our likeness" had anthropo- morphic implications, and they sought to soften these by explaining that "after our likeness" means "with discernment and understanding" (Rashi) or that it refers to those respects in which man's soul is similar to God (Ibn Ezra and Nahmanides). Josephus (Ant. 1. 32) avoids this difficulty by omitting the phrase completely and by simply reporting that God formed man. Again, Franxman (p. 45) makes no mention of this modification. Franxman (p. 46) has missed Josephus' solution of the problem of the so-called twin accounts of creation in Gen. 1 and 2. Josephus avoids the isssue by stating explicitly (Ant. 1. 34) that in the second chapter (Gen. 2:4 ff.) Moses is merely giving the details of God's formation of man. He also explains (Ant. 1. 34) that in chapter 2 of Genesis Moses begins to interpret nature ((puatokoyeiv), just as he had declared in his proem (Ant. 1. 18) that much of his work is devoted to natural philosophy ((puctooXoyia). These terms ((pucatooyia and (puaotooyeiv) are familiar from Aristotle (De Sensu 442 b25, and Metaphysics 988 b27) and from Epicurus (Epistulae 1, p. 4 [Usener]; 2, p. 35 [Usener]). Josephus apparently felt that the statement (Gen. 2:7) that God breathed into man's nostrils the breath of life was too anthromorphic, and so he omits it and says instead (Ant. 1. 34) that God instilled (?vfKcev, "sent into, implanted, in- spired") into him spirit and soul. Franxman (p. 47) merely notes that Josephus used the word EvjKcev, without attempting to explain why. Gen. 2:7 says that God formed man out of the dust of the earth and breathed into him the breath of life. Josephus (Ant. 1. 34) adds that in addition to the dust and the breath (nveci4a) God infused soul (WuXxi) into man. Franxman (p. 47) cites the parallel with Wisdom of Solomon 15:11, which uses the same two words, 123</page><page sequence="4">124 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW WuXr and nrvEi)a, for the spiritual elements in man, and notes that Lev. Rabbah 32. 2 and Eccl. Rabbah 10. 20 also speak of the tripartite composition of man, consisting of body, spirit, and soul. Lewinsky3 suggests that nvEipa and WuXi are synonymous, and that Josephus placed the two terms in juxtaposition in the hope that they would explain each other. We may, however, object that the two concepts are directly opposed to each other in the epistles of the New Testament (1 Thess. 5:23, Romans 8:2) written by Josephus' contemporary, Paul; and Josephus may well have had in mind Plato's trichotomy (Republic 439) of the logical, spirited, and appetitive faculties of the soul. In any case, as Best4 notes, Josephus avoided the Septuagint's translation of rny3, nvot, which is a purely physiological term, and used WuXr, which has psychological overtones; Wuxr has strong classical antecedents, particularly in Plato's Phaedo. We may suggest a parallel in the Septuagint's rendering of lpru :y (Gen. 3:14), as bti TO ar)TOet aou Kai Tf Kotlia, which Drummond5 regards as a reference to the division of the human faculties into rational, spirited, and appetitive elements, noting that the serpent was deprived of the first when speech was taken from him and was left with the last two elements. All of this has been missed by Franxman. Franxman moreover omits the significant fact that in Josephus it is God, and not Adam as in the Bible (Gen. 2:20), who gives names to the animals. Epicurus (Letter to Herodotus 75-76), we may note, criticizes the hypothesis that names were at first deliberately given to things, and contends that each man, in accordance with his feeling and impression, assigned his own names to objects, and that it was only at a later stage that particular names were by common consent deliberately assigned to things. A similar view is expressed in Diodorus (1. 8. 3). Lucretius (5. 1041 ff.) ridicules the notion that any one person assigned names to things and that other men learned their first words from him. He is apparently, as Bailey6 suggests, refuting the portrayal, in Plato's Cratylus 388 E-390 E, of the lawgiver who assigns names to things, comparing them so that they will bear a correct relation to the nature of the things named. Lucretius indeed (5. 1043-1045) asks why one man should have this faculty while others did not. Similarly, in the second century the Epicurean Diogenes of Oenoanda (frag. 10, cols. 2-4 [William]) declares that it is nonsense to say that names were given to things by deliberate choice. "It is ridiculous," he adds, "indeed the most ridiculous thing in the world, to suppose, in addition to the sheer impossibility of the task, that some one single man should have got together so great multitudes 3 A.

The notion, then, that one man had assigned names by his spontaneous declaration seemed naive and ridiculous, at least to the Epicureans. Josephus (Ant. 1. 35) thus avoids this possible objection by having God, not Adam, name the animals.7 Again, Scripture (Gen. 2:17) states that God warned Adam that on the day when he ate of the tree of knowledge he would die. Commentators have long been troubled by this passage, since Adam did not die after he ate of it but actually reached the age of 930. Nahmanides explains that the meaning is that on that day he became mortal. Cassuto,8 after summarizing many other explanations, suggests that the meaning is that when Adam ate of the tree of knowledge it was decreed that he would never be able to eat of the tree of life, which would have given him eternal life. Again, Josephus (Ant. 1. 40)-a point omitted by Franxman-avoids the problem by omitting the phrase "on the day." The warning is more general, namely, that if Adam and Eve touch the tree of knowledge, it will cause their destruction. An obvious question which occurs to the reader of the Biblical narrative is the identification of of the person whom Cain married, and the answer would appear to be that he must have married his own mother, since there was no other woman in the world at that time. The Rabbis were clearly troubled by this, and they declared (B.Yeb. 62a) that the superfluous word nr before the names of Cain and Abel indicates that they had twin sisters born with them. Similarly, the Book of Jubilees (4:19) postulates a sister for Cain whom he married.9 The Greek reader, with his similar traditional abhorrence of the kind of incest practiced by Oedipus with his mother, would be horrified at the thought that Cain had done the same, and so Josephus (Ant. 1. 52), immediately after reporting the birth of Cain and 7 Abraham Schalit (Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews, I [Jerusalem, 1944] p. 5, n. 7b) asks why, if God gave the animals their names, did He bring them before Adam? He therefore sees a change of subject in the middle of the sentence, though this is stretching the Greek, so that it is Adam who names the animals. But, we may reply, the reason why God brings the animals, male and female, before Adam is to arouse in him the instinct for a female mate. Alternatively, we may suggest that according to Josephus God devised the system of classification and Adam carried it into effect. 8 Umberto Cassuto, A Commentary on the Book of Genesis, Part 1: From Adam to Noah (Jerusalem, 1961), pp. 124-25. 9 The basis for this, of course, may well be Gen. 5:4: "And he [Adam] begat sons and daughters." See Victor Aptowitzer, Kain und Abel in der Agada, den Apokryphen, der hellenistischen, christlichen und muhammedanischen literatur (Wien, 1922), p. 115, nn. 41 ff.; Arthur Marmorstein, "Die Namen der Schwestern Kains und Abels in der midraschischen und in der apokryphen Literatur," ZA TW 25 (1905), 141-44; and Samuel Poznanski, "Zu den Namen der Frauen Kains und Abels," ibid., 340-42. 125</page><page sequence="6">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW Abel, explicitly states that Adam and Eve also had daughters. Franxman, p. 65, to be sure, notes that Josephus mentions the birth of daughters to Eve, but he does not ask why Josephus did so. Franxman fails to note that the picture of Noah as a preacher, introduced by Josephus (Ant. 1. 74), is that of a Cynic or Stoic preaching such "diatribes"'° as those written by Menippus, Meleager, Petronius, Epictetus, Dio Chrysostom, and Seneca, which profoundly influenced Paul in his sermon to the Athenians on the Areopagus (Acts 17:22-31)." Josephus thus adds to the Biblical narrative by describing Noah as indignant (6uoXcpaivwcv) at the conduct of the sinners, viewing their counsels with displeasure (dr6co6)), urging them to come to a better frame of mind (£ni 6T KpCiTTov Tnv 6tdvotav) and to mend their deeds (Trdt nrpd4t1 PiCTaoptpE1V). Josephus' account of Noah and the flood (Ant. 1. 75 ff.) has a number of touches unnoticed by Franxman, reminiscent of the Greek story of Deucalion and the flood. The extra-Biblical statement (Ant. 1. 75), not found in Gen. 6:7, of God's resolve to replace the existing race of mankind with another race pure of vice, has its parallel in Ovid (Metamorphoses 1. 250-252), who similarly notes Zeus' promise to replace the wicked race of men with another race of wondrous origin not like the earlier one, as well as in Aeschylus' Prometheus Bound 248-249 (232-233), who likewise notes that Zeus, before he had been thwarted by Prometheus' philanthropy, had intended to blot out the human race and to create a new one. Again, Josephus (Ant. 1. 76) says that Noah alone was saved, God having put into his mind (u6ro0ecvou) the idea of making an ark. This is closely paralleled by Apollodorus (1. 7. 2), who relates that Deucalion constructed an ark on the advice (6no0ecVou) of Prometheus. There is a curious similarity also between the language introducing Lucian's account of how Deucalion was saved (De Syria Dea 12) and Josephus' language (Ant. 1. 76-77) describing how Noah was saved. Lucian says that Deucalion's salvation occurred in this wise (i 65 oi aoWTrrpirl q16i yvETro): he built a large chest (XdpvaKa), into which he put his children and their wives (Icai6dq Te Kai yUvaliKCaq auroi). Josephus says that God put into Noah's mind a means of salvation in this wise (aCoWrpiav rota6rnv): he built a chest (XdpvaKa) on which he embarked with [his children],'2 the '0 See Horace, Satires, 2. 3.

St. John Thackeray (Josephus, IV [Cambridge, Mass., 1930] [Loeb Classical Library], on Ant. 1. 77) and Schalit (ad loc.) comment, the words must have dropped out accidentally. 126</page><page sequence="7">JOSEPHUS ON GENESIS-FELDMAN 127 mother of his children, and their wives (aoCv rq TrTrpi Tiv 7caiS6v Kai trat TOUTov yuvactiv). The very word for "ark" used by Josephus, kXpvat, as Thackeray (ad loc.) has noted, is the word used by classical writers of Deucalion's ark (e.g., Apollodorus 1. 7. 2; Lucian, De Syria Dea 12), rather than the word KIpcor6; used in the Septuagint (Gen. 6:14 ff.) and in Philo (De Plantatione 43). Again, a reader might find an allusion to the doctrine of original sin in the passage (Gen. 8:21) in which God says that "he will not again curse the ground any more for man's sake; for the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth." Rashi comments that the word translated "from his youth" is actually written defectively, and that it can consequently be construed to mean that when man is "bestirred" to leave his mother's womb, the Inclination to evil enters into him, that is, at birth. To avoid the theological problem of original sin which such a passage presents, Josephus omits it completely from his paraphrase, a point missed by Franxman. Just as Josephus (Ant. 1. 73) takes pains to point out the similarity between the sons of the angels (Gen. 6:4) and the Titans of Greek mythology, so does he note that the rainbow, which is a token of God's covenant with man (Gen. 9:13), is "among people there" (nap&amp; Toi01 cKi) believed to be God's bow. Though Josephus would seem to refer here to the belief of the Babylonians, his Hellenistic readers would most probably have thought of the Greek gods Artemis and Apollo, both of whom bore the epithet TO~o(p6poq, "bow-bearer." Indeed Homer's favorite epithet for Apollo is "far-darting" (Kr1P6Xoq). To be sure, as Schorr13 remarks, the rainbow is to the Greeks (e.g., Homer, Iliad 17. 547) a portent of war and thus has the very opposite connotation to that of the rainbow in Genesis, but in his eagerness to note parallels between aspects of the Jewish cult and of Greek mythology, Josephus omits this observation, a point again missed by Franxman. Josephus is well aware that his Greek readers would regard with skepticism the long lives of the early patriarchs; and so he cites (Ant. 1. 107-108) a number of non-Jewish historians (including the Egyptian Manetho and Hieronymus, the Babylonian Berosus, Mochus, Histiaeus, and the authors of Phoenician histories), who concur in the tradition that the ancients lived long lives, as well as several Greek poets and historians (including Hesiod, Hecataeus, Hellanicus, Acusilaus, Ephorus, and Nicolaus of Damascus), who report that the ancients lived for a thousand years, the ultimate limit also for the Biblical patriarchs. In the end (Ant. 1. 108), to be sure, Josephus closes with the formula that "on these matters let everyone decide according to his fancy," a phrase very similar to that of Dionysius of Halicarnassus (1.48. 1, 1.48.4, 2. 40.3, 2. 70.5, 3.35.5). But Josephus is not content with this: he feels the need to rationalize the longevity of the patriarchs, and so he explains (Ant. 1. 105-106) that it is due to four factors: first, they were beloved of God (0ooptXkei) because they were the creatures of 13 Alexander Schorr, Antiquitates Judaicae (Hebrew), I (Jerusalem, 1940), 20, n. 3.</page><page sequence="8">128 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW God Himself; secondly, their diet (Tpo(pdq)14 was conducive to long life; thirdly, they possessed merit (dpeTi ); and fourthly, since they could not have predicted anything with certainty unless they lived for 600 years (the period of a "great year"), God permitted them to live longer lives so as to promote the utility (eXprlarTiav) of their discoveries in astronomy and geometry. Schalit 5 rightly sees in the last reason a typically Hellenistic motif, that of the e6upyTrTlq, the benefactor. One sees this motif, for example, in the line in Euripides (Heracles 1252) in which Theseus call Heracles e6uppytrTnlq poToiat Kai Pt-yaq (pikog, "the benefactor of men and their great friend." One finds the term as a title conferred on such kings and emperors as Antigonus,'6 Ptolemy V Epiphanes,'7 and Trajan. 8 Again, the point is missed by Franxman. Whereas the Bible (Gen. 9:18) makes no mention at all of the descent of Noah's sons from the mountains to the plains, and only later (Gen. 11:2), in speaking of the descendants of Noah who comprised the generation of the Tower of Babel, makes note of the fact that they found a plain in the land of Shinar and dwelt there, Josephus (Ant. 1. 109) adds that Noah's sons were the first to descend from the mountains to the plains (CiS -Td nc6ia), and that they persuaded the others (presumably the grandsons and later descendants), who were afraid to descend (KaTdpaotv) from the heights (dor TC)v 6WXk6Wv) because another flood might overwhelm them, to take courage and follow them.'9 A similar account, unnoticed by Franxman, appears in Plato's description of the development of society after the Greek deluge. Those who escaped, he remarks (Laws 3. 677 B 1-3), were only hill shepherds, "small sparks of the human race preserved on the tops of mountains." A natural fear rang in their ears at first, preventing their descent (KaTapaiivev) from the heights (K ... TC6V 6rXd v) into the plains (nri T&amp; 7n6ia). 14 Aristotle, De Longitudine et Brevitate Vitae, 464 B 19-467 A 5, discusses the reasons for the long life of certain species and of certain individuals, but he does not mention diet.

The reasons given by God (Ant. 1. 110) in urging them to send out (cTneXXtv) colonies (d&amp;rouciaq) are those that led to the founding of many Greek colonies,2 namely, an increasing population21 and the consequent threat of internal strife (iva Cpi caTactdotCev).22 It is only after God had caused the dispersal of the generation of Babel through their diversity of languages that they founded colonies on all the continents, on the mainland or on islands, on the coast or inland, wherever they happened to go (Ant. 1. 120). There is an obvious contrast here between the refusal of these people to found colonies and the willingness of Abraham's sons and grandsons to follow his advice (Ant. 1. 239) and found colonies in Arabia and Libya. There is a typically Greek picture of 6pptq and v£tcatq1 in Josephus' depiction of the generation of the Tower of Babel (Ant. 1. 113-119) that has escaped Franxman's notice.23 Their refusal to listen to God's advice to found colonies is laid to their willful blindness (dpaiaOi, ignorance, stupidity). Their undue pride in failing to realize that their blessings were due to God's benevolence,24 and their insolence in regarding their own might as the cause of their abundance (Ant. 1. 111), together with their suspicion that God was plotting against them in urging them to send out colonies so that they might be more vulnerable to attack (Ant. 1. 112), are justifications for the v4cat1o that follows.25 They were incited, says Josephus (Ant. 1. 113), to this insolent contempt ({iptv.. . Kai KaTa(pp6vrlg) 20 Schalit, introduction, p. lxx, states that the picture of the founding of colonies (CrTeXCtv, noteioclOt dnortKiaq, Latin colonias deducere) is taken from the world of the Greeks and the Romans. 21 Pirke de-Rabbi Eliezer 24 also notes a rapid increase in population, remark- ing that the women gave birth to sextuplets. 22 It is this threat of civil strife that is constantly presented by Josephus as the greatest danger to orderly rule; thus, for example, the greatest political blessing that can be bestowed by God upon Solomon (Ant. 7. 337) is peace and freedom from war and civil dissension (Cadoacov ?t(pukiov), and in commending Solomon to the people, David asks his sons (Ant. 7. 372) to refrain from civil dissension (PL C.n TaotldCtv ). 23 See my "Hellenizations in Josephus' Portrayal of Man's Decline," in Jacob Neusner, ed., Religions in Antiquity: Essays in Memory of Erwin Ramsdell Goodenough (Leiden, 1968) (Studies in the History of Religions, 14), pp. 336-53, especially 352. 24 Rappaport (p. 98, n. 69) cites several passages in the Midrash which indicate that the generation of the Tower of Babel became proud only on account of the goods that God had granted them. 25 On the difference between Josephus and the Midrashim as to the reason for God's punishment of the generation of Babel see Louis Ginzberg, The Legends of the Jews, V (Philadelphia, 1925), 204, n. 90, and Schalit, p. 22, n. 97a. 129</page><page sequence="10">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW of God by Nebrodes (i.e., Nimrod), and it was he who persuaded them to attribute their prosperity not to God but to their own excellence. Nimrod is depicted (Ant. 1. 114) as gradually transforming the state of affairs into a Greek- like tyranny in which the masses were continuously dependent upon the tyrant's power for their protection. Nimrod has the audacity to challenge God, threaten- ing that he will take revenge upon Him if He should send another flood. Thus the framework of the whole incident of the Tower of Babel is presented in terms familiar to a Greek audience.26 Again, there is added color, unnoticed by Franxman, in Josephus' description of the building of the Tower. The masses, deeming it slavery to yield to God, eagerly follow Nimrod's advice (Ant. 1. 115) and build the Tower with no lack of zeal (ou6v dinoXeiinovT£; anou6i5 ) and with no hesitation (6Kvrlp6)), so that it rose more swiftly than anyone expected. The size of the Tower is exaggerated; the thickness, we are told (Ant. 1. 116), was so great as to dwarf its height to viewers. There are several parallels with the Greek story of the giants Otis and Ephialtes, who sought to storm heaven by piling Mount Pelion on Mount Ossa. In his listing of the nations descended from Japheth (Ant. 1. 122-129), Josephus, as Franxman fails to remark, constantly seeks to make the matter intelligible by giving the Greek equivalents. He claims (Ant. 1. 121) that it is the Greeks who were responsible for the change of nomenclature, as though these nations were descended from themselves, but actually many of the equivalents seem to be Josephus' own conjecture, according to the geography of his time, made so that the names will not sound so strange to Greek ears,27 for as Thackeray28 notes, it is because of lack of euphony that Josephus elsewhere,29 like Strabo,30 omits lists of strange names as unnecessary. This is merely a sampling of points which Franxman has missed for the first part of Genesis. For the rest of Genesis, we may note, for example, his failure to explain the significance of Josephus' depiction of Abraham as a philosopher and scientist, as well as the omission of reference to the gift of the Land of Israel as a 26 On the connection of Nimrod with the Tower of Babel, which is not Biblical, as Thackeray (on Ant. 1. 113) notes, see Pirke de-Rabbi Eliezer, chap. 24, and other citations in Ginzberg, V, 201, n. 88. 27 On Josephus' table of nations see now Philip S. Alexander, The Toponymy of the Targumim, with Special Reference to the Table of Nations and the Boundaries of the Land of Israel (Diss. D.Phil., Oxford University, 1974). Josephus himself (Ant. 1. 129) says that the names have been hellenized "with a view to euphony and my readers' pleasure." "The form in which they here appear," he continues apologetically, "is not that used in our country, where their structure and termination remain always the same." 28 Thackeray, on Ant. 1. 129. 29 Josephus, Ant. 2. 176, 7. 369, 11. 68, 11. 152, 12. 57. 30 Cf.

Cadbury, The Making of Luke-Acts (New York, 1927), cited by Thackeray, on Ant. 1. 129. 130</page><page sequence="11">JOSEPHUS ON GENESIS-FELDMAN 131 possession, the introduction of the erotic element in connection with Abimelech, the omission of the various theological implications of the 'Akedah, the mention that Heracles married the granddaughter of Abraham, the increased romantic flavor of Eliezer's journey, and in general the de-emphasis of the role of God.31 We must be grateful, however, for Franxman's stylistic analysis. Finally, his success in finding parallels in so many points between Josephus' account and that of Philo is the most systematic indication that we have seen thus far to support the view that Josephus did indeed use Philo's Biblical exposition.
