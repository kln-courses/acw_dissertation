The problem, salient to the status of the art object during this period, remains constant: the dissonance between material and the armature or system that organizes it and sponsors its apperception and identification. Yet the gravitational pull shifts. Fontana's reverie of shattering and exceed- ing the shell of material contingency assumes the possibility of abstraction as physical disengagement, of pure space.

At once repugnant and graceful, the jellyfish is differentiated from its neighbors (fish, mussel) by the absence of any internal or external structure, by the lack of skeleton or shell. Rather, it confronts us with an animate materiality in its "waver- ing,"2 non-formed presence. For Broodthaers, this materiality is body. Of note in Broodthaers's insinuations is that a) the "body" need not be located in an anthro- pomorphic vise, and b) it is not understood as a static support anterior to structure, waiting to be specified and realized by form. The corporeal does not act as an ontologically stable base upon which form operates. It drops out, "wave, wavering," yet participates in a process of folding and unfolding through and against an organizing pressure. Piero Manzoni's object production of 1959-63 stands between Fontana's flight and Broodthaers's slipping and wavering-each, despite their polarity, artic- ulated as a way of wresting loose from the models of modernism in which materiality remained an obfuscated term. In order to approach Manzoni's work in relation to the modernist language that it so dutifully deploys, and so irreverently undoes, one would need to locate the common surface in which the seemingly oppositional terms-the modernist visual system and its field of material exclu- sions-could be shown to be enfolded, a fabric of cohabitant threads. The years 1960-61, in which his critical Achrome with bread rolls series emerges fully to view, witness Manzoni circumscribing his own practice through the reiteration and permutation of prewar idioms. The postwar avant-garde's imperative of coming to terms with the then-ossified vocabulary of modernism provides the conditions that enable Manzoni to investigate the material hetero- geneity rendered inert in modernist painting. For if an irreducibly differentiated materiality embodies the occluded term, it nevertheless manifests this exclusion from a position internal to the exclusionary field. It assumes its valence only in simultaneous contiguity and distinction to modernism's analytically deduced logic. It is in this internal space that Manzoni constructs his radically "organicized" empiricist project. And in order for modernist painting to unravel, it must first be saturated with its own set of possibilities. All of its conceivable permutations must be explored for the silent relationships within them to surface. Manzoni implicitly proposes a 1.

The strategy for answering that question emerges from an elaboration of infinitely multiple terms derived from a seemingly closed and self-sustaining set of coordinates. In Manzoni's Achrome with bread rolls, one encounters the full schema of mod- ernist painting. First, the modernist monochrome, heavy with its historically determined purity and factual self-evidence. Alongside the monochrome stands its incommensurable counterpart, the grid. This grid-as the axiomatically deduced, central organizing principle that claims to transcend particularity-hov- ers in a purely optical space. 3 Each, grid and monochrome, vie to lend legibility to the surface. Yet neither paradigm stands prior to the other; their mutual imbri- cation frustrates the ability to ascertain the status of Manzoni's bread roll amalgam pretending to the category of art. Of course, both modernist grammars share a common place, a joint schema, despite their immediate opposition within its scope.4 Each paradigm effec- tively eradicates painting's dyadic relationship between figure and ground, 3. This is not the project of transcendance evident in Fontana's oscillation between the encrusted canvas support and the slash to a zone "beyond that support." That set of differences nevertheless belongs to a separate discussion. 4. Rosalind Krauss pinpoints the schematic rationale within modernist painting.

But the bread rolls unravel the monological empiricism of the monochrome as well as the unitary-immaterial systematicity of the grid. Multiplying across the field under the grid's rigorous spatial control, the rolls paradoxically fail (or rather exceed) its internal consistency. In their lumpy, biradial morphology, they surface in relief, casting shadows over the modular squares. Despite their bulbous presence as objects, gratuitous to the economy of the modernist field, they func- tion as the surface beneath the white kaolin and paint admixture. Here, their material obstinacy is already folded into the logic of both the monochrome and the grid, pushing each into view only to obscure and contaminate the integrity of both models. Paradoxically, each violated cell is constituted by the roll that it also seeks to contain. Unruly in their columns and rows, the rolls appear as both figure and as ground, literally welling up as embodied figure and visually withdrawing as support. They perform this oscillation in the register of the material. But what happens to materiality here, lodged in the optically determined field, and what becomes of system?5 What about the bread rolls considered as specific bodies, like (and unlike) Broodthaers's unbound jellyfish? Again, the status of the rolls as body-as the non-molded-remains opaque. Obviating metaphor and fig- uration, the mounds suggest disparate possibilities. Are they the modernist schema's set of exclusions: the pre-industrial craft object, the readymade that references assembly-line hygiene, the tenacious materiality of dough, or anthropo- solutions, only so many transcodings.

See also "Grids" in The Originality of the Avant-Garde and Other Modernist Myths (Cambridge: MIT Press, 1985), pp. 8-22. 5. I use the term "materiality" to mean that which is neither ideal nor the "thing in-itself." Throughout this paper, in discussing materiality, I am relying on Georges Bataille's definition of mate- rialism, as articulated in his essay "Materialism," in Visions of Excess: Selected Writings, 1927-1939, ed. Allan Stoekl (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1994), pp. 15-16. Bataille defines his materi- alism negatively: "Most materialists, even though they may have wanted to do away with all spiritual entities, ended up positing an order of things whose hierarchical relations mark it as specifically ideal- ist." He wrests materialism from its crutch value as a stable element in a materialism that would seek to re-idealize it (metaphysical philosophy or positivist science). I am also interested in Bataille's sketch, in "Base Materialism," of a "materialism, which, whatever its scope in the positive order, is an active principle. Base matter refuses to allow itself to be reduced to the great ontological machines resulting from these aspirations, by its incongruity and an overwhelming lack of respect, and permits the intellect to escape the constraints of idealism" (pp. 45-52). However, this does not provide a model for the way in which Manzoni folds in materiality as an element. Rather, Manzoni's materiality surfaces as internal to structure, as its other. In this sense, it may recall Julia Kristeva's conceptualization, in "Revolution in the Poetic Language," of the presymbolic, the chora, a bodily trace that seeps through perforations in the symbolic. Yet this model also fails insofar as Kristeva's semiotic, deriving from the chora, is posited as a prior, anterior mode to structure/the symbolic. Again, I am interested in the contiguity-neither anterior nor interior-of materiality and corporeality in Manzoni.

The allover kaolin wash renders this question indeterminate as well. For if they embody the excluded, they nevertheless materialize these exclusions from a position internal to that exclusionary field. Contradictory sets-modernist visu- ality's coordinates and its material exiles-are enfolded, each term implicating the next in a relationship of reciprocal constitution. Nonetheless, each term pulls away from the others. Late-1950s Milan, the scene to which Manzoni arrived, witnessed the aggre- gation of international models of artistic production drawn from a number of historical contexts; contemporary artists were (re)rehearsing avant-gardist mod- els, or shells. Yves Klein exhibits his Propositions Monochromes, a hybridized regurgitation of Rodchenko's monochrome and the Duchampian readymade, in 1957 at the Galerie Apollinaire in Milan. The following year, Jasper Johns has his first solo show at Leo Castelli, while, in the traveling version of MoMA's 1957 ret- rospective, the Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Moderna in Rome presents to Europe a comprehensive exhibit of Jackson Pollock's work.6 Johns's Italian reception in January of 1960 at the Galleria del Naviglio thus follows quickly on the heels of Pollock's European reception. Enforcing the effect of a temporal wrinkle, asyn- chronous and irreconcilable understandings of painting are available simultaneously to the Italian cultural image bank. The picture is of a Milan fomenting with the sudden rediscovery of Dada and Duchamp-frequently exhibited at Arturo Schwarz's gallery in Milan-and of American work ranging from Abstract Expressionism to its insistent critique. This plurality of artistic forms floats deracinated from the dialectical connective tissue that stitched avant-garde paradigms one to the next, through the diachronic unfolding of rupture and continuity, as well as in debates across a syntagmatic field. In the European postwar context, these paradigms are just so many tem- plates, so many readymade categories for artistic appropriation. In the journal Azimuth, a collaborative venture between Manzoni and the artist Enrico Castellani, put out in affiliation with their gallery Azimut, Castellani discusses the postwar presence of modernism in relation to the conventionaliza- tion of the grid. He recasts the ultimate sign of modernist emancipation as a binding apparatus akin to any given sentence, a "formula," an empty "semanticity."7 He thus 6.

Submitted continu- ally to the violence of synthesis, modernist and avant-gardist strategies were denied their historical force as rupture and difference. Modernism-as-template becomes Manzoni's discursive space. In keeping with his collaborator's analysis, two principles are at work in Manzoni's Achromes. The grid and the monochrome as already-made forms predetermine the surface. In many of these works, most notably the "bread rolls," the visual field is quanti- fied. Each squared cell echoes the larger square of the frame, gripping those prior paradigms within its own regularity. A catalogue of the monochrome, the grid, the allover painting, and the relief, the Achrome sets the terms of the enclosed modernist schema in circulation, demonstrating their dependence on one another and a larger visual system that generates them. The parsimonious econ- omy of the white field responds to the avant-garde's seemingly rich, inceptive and original forms, all of which function now as a preconstituted template. In this sense, Manzoni stages the schematization of modernist visuality, which developed ironically under the rubric of self-reflexivity. In contrast to this parsimonious stock-taking, he insists on the eruption of texture. Having rehearsed the very processes of reification, Achrome with bread rolls then presents itself as internal contaminant, irritating the grid's self-closure. A feedback process of folding and unraveling modernist paradigms happens on the level of temporality. The grid that one discovers here is cast as the present arma- ture of its position as historical form. This temporal redoubling operates as a reminder that the modernist strategy is understood in the achrome as always- already-read, as apprehended through layers of previous interpretation, as ubiquitous as the Italian bread roll. The return of a historically instituted support, folded into a work self-reflexively mired in the present that admits to the banality of its objecthood, yields both an afterimage of modernism and its necessary fore- closures. Previously, Lucio Fontana's Gruppo Nucleare, with which Piero Manzoni was affiliated, attempted to theorize contemporary practice against a reading of art's discursive history. In his Technical Manifesto of Spacialism (1951), Fontana formu- lated a story of a continuous mutation of systems giving structure and meaning to matter. "Transformations of the material means of life determine man's states of mind throughout history," he stated. "Little by little, a system opposed to another already accepted system replaces it." In this sense, Fontana posits artistic transfor- mation as a procession of paradigm shifts that draw art to a point ready for radical synthesis and transcendence of matter. "Man's true conquest of space is his 8. Ibid.</page><page sequence="8">Lucio Fontana. 1964 Fontana.

Unlike Manzoni's redoubled grid/monochrome in which history materially aggregates, Fontana's drive to exceed preexisting artistic paradigms opens onto an airy atemporality. Where Fontana conceived of a temporality and materiality that transforms toward ultimate sublation, Manzoni proposes a model wherein materiality unfolds as overlapping and pulsatile. 9.

Reprinted in The Italian Metamorphosis, pp. 713-14. The irony is that Fontana's manifesto reads similarly to Malevich's claim, thirty-three years earlier, to "have ripped through the blue lampshade of color," of painting, and to "swim in the white free abyss" of infinity. See Kasimir Malevich, "From Cubism and Futurism to Suprematism: The New Realism in Painting" (1915), and "Non-Objective Art and Suprematism" (1919). Reprinted in Art in Theory, eds. Charles Harrison and Paul Wood (Cambridge, England: The Blackwell Press, 1993), pp. 166-176 and pp. 290-92, respectively. Given the publication, in an early issue of Metro Alfieri--an art magazine condensing the network of intersecting art strategies in Milan- of writing excerpts by Malevich in a lengthy article on the Russian avant-garde (Malevich, Tatlin, and Lissitzky), there's reason to believe that Fontana would have had some access to those articulations and definitions of artmaking. 10. In contrast to the physical trace of Pollock's line operating as the material precipitate of the artist himself embedded on the pictorial plane, Fontana's slash dematerializes the gestural trace, leav- ing only a negative space-an anti-mark-operating as threshold onto another zone.</page><page sequence="9">36 OCTOBER While Fontana may provide one solution to the postwar condition, Manzoni counters Fontana's claims for a space beyond the contingency of matter and process with a work firmly grounded in his own understanding of "reality." The Manifesto ofAlbisola Marina, which Manzoni signed as early as 1957, insists that the canvas can no longer be "the utopia of an aesthetic order or the folly of idealism without concrete human origin, an impersonal program whose sole and squalid presence resides in the creation of matter. Rather it will be a living flesh, direct and scalding."11 In a move that responds to modernist painting in its double guise-as grid and as monochrome--Manzoni rejects the possibility of a tran- scendental visuality and simultaneously radicalizes the monochrome's claim to material self-evidence. The canvas no longer stands merely as concrete base, or an originary static support. In contrast, it will be "living flesh." Matter is understood as active in process. In his statement for the second issue of Azimuth,12 begun in December of 1959 in response to Fontana's II Gesto, Manzoni polemicizes against the phenomenon of gesturality and its concomitant understanding of the blank surface as a space of projection, just as he had rejected Fontana's concept of sur- face as a liminal crust opening onto an immaterial beyond. He refers to a set of "gymnastics," the mythical Pollock dance, no doubt, that had misapprehended the canvas as a "receptacle."13 Unlike either understanding of the pictorial sur- face as inanimate, Manzoni interprets that surface as already dynamic.14 This emergent understanding of the material surface, in turn, marks Manzoni's break with Gruppo Nucleare in 1959, as well as the direction his work took after his departure. It signals the inauguration of an object production in which the succession of modernist strategies accrete and unravel under their own pressure, as well as the material processes, organic and industrial, that they had withheld. Rather than repeating each strategy discretely, Manzoni piles them onto a single plane, making of the prewar avant-garde a topography impossible to cir- cumvent. Within and despite his accumulation of received paradigms, he paradoxically insists on an art "that wishes always to be 'other'": Every new invention is now at risk of becoming the object of repetition of a purely mercantile character; it is therefore urgent to take vigorous antistylistic action for an art that wishes always to be "other."15 11.

To specify Manzoni's project in relation to modernist language, one would need to locate a common field in which postwar debates about modernism and its disavowals emerge. In Dialectic of Enlightenment (1947), Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer locate an instance of this problem: a unitary logic in search of an absolute, inter- nal resolution. In their attempt to investigate the legacy of the Enlightenment for its inheritors, modernism and twentieth-century rationalism, Adorno and Horkheimer analyze the mutually entwined status of logic as schematization, and the experiential dimension of the subject wedged in everyday contingency. The authors state their underlying principle: "That social freedom is inseparable from Enlightened thought, and yet, if Enlightenment does not accommodate reflection on its recidivist element, then it seals its own fate. Pragmatized logic yields to the violence of rationalism and positivism."16 This "recidivist" element thus derives from the violent neutralization of contradiction, of differences internal to a given set of coordinates. In a chapter entitled 'Juliette or Enlightenment and Morality," for instance, rationalism plays itself out over the register of the corporeal.17 Adorno and Horkheimer locate modernity's failure, or the locus of the beginning of its disso- lution, at its very opening: in the figure of the Marquis de Sade. Indeed, Sade emerges for a number of postwar writers-among them Adorno/Horkheimer, Georges Bataille, Maurice Blanchot, Pierre Klossowski, Michel Foucault, Phillipe Sollers, Roland Barthes, and Jacques Lacan-to rethink modernism and the sub- sequent skepticism toward it in the wake of the war.18 Here, Sade-perhaps very 16.

Adorno's and Horkheimer's thought is ultimately transcendental. It does not focus on the prob- lem of materiality or the body, although their exegesis on Sade of necessity addresses these issues in a manner of relevance to my discussion of systematicity and materiality. 18. Adorno/Horkheimer and Pierre Klossowski both produce in-depth, extended analyses of Sade's writing at the close of the war, in 1947 (Pierre Klossowski, Sade Mon Prochain, translated as Sade My Neighbor, trans. Alphonso Lingis [Evanstown: Northwestern University Press, 1991]). In the intro- duction, Lingis makes Sade's interest to the postwar intellectual landscape quite clear. Sade's work, "of unsurpassable monstrosity is, paradoxically, rationalist in construction, even hyper rationalist, and pedagogic in genre. Does his importance for a Europe mourning the devastation of its populations and its rational programs lie in the demonstration Sade undertakes of how a rationalism compre- hends and embraces the last limits of evil? In his writing, the form of rationalism itself becomes seduc- tion and contamination" (p. x). "In the reasons with which we allowed ourselves to be persuaded of those principles, was there not from the first, a clandestine force of seduction at work, by which the</page><page sequence="11">38 OCTOBER much an imaginary, fictive character-surfaces as the locus of a knot through which to read the irrationality folded within modernist rationality, the gulag in the modernist grid.19 In the postwar context, the Sadean project is understood as the elaboration of a total organization principle founded on the consolidation, and therefore neutralization, of physical and material specificity. In Sade's writing, "deviation" within the corporeal register simply enables the establishment of a system. Proceeding through the loop of this circular logic, the anomalous is evoked in order to generate good order out of the anomalous. Through a reading of Justine and Juliette, Maurice Blanchot interprets Sade's manipulation of the libidinal/sex- ual as a drive to unite a single framework impermeable to the vagaries of those very drives as well as the vicissitudes of the external world. Blanchot balks at the way in which "Sade sets himself the gigantic task of drawing up the inventory of anomalies and aberrations. Having done everything, he will be at the mercy of nothing. He is impervious to all attacks. That is the primary reason of his solitude."20 Via assimilation, the internal coherence of a system is achieved. Blanchot refers to this achieved task as the rigid enclosure of the Sadean set of sexual orchestrations, where all difference can be made to permute as a single form, and thus incorporate into the Sadean grid. Sade's "perfect autonomy with respect to the world" (the exterior) is constructed on the ability to ward off that world by dividing, subdividing, and appropriating antagonistic drives from within. "We can safely state, without unduly modernizing Sade's thought, that he was one of the first thinkers to have recognized and incorporated into his world view the notion of transcendence," by casting his rationale into every recess of the self.21 This strategy, transcendence of the exterior, consummated through a rigorous internal composure, makes of the postwar Sade "the master of the great themes of modern thought and sensibility."22 Sade's reception undergoes a dramatic reassessment between the time of the prewar avant-garde-the Surrealists-and its postwar successors. The tension terminal power of the absolutely antihuman came to infect irradicably" all our human forces? (p. xi). Lingis argues that "Sade's is a project of using the medium of generality, of the generic, to undermine generic man and promote the singular case, the monster" (p. xiii). On the one hand Sade's libertinage as monstrosity surfaces in the medium of a rationalist discourse. On the other, it marks the medium itself, the rationalist discourse, as inextricably linked, bound to the very fabric of its seeming antithe- sis: irrationality. 19.

No longer a countermodel to modern rationality, a vehicle of liberation through a celebratory and irreverent occupation of sexuality, he now figures as precursor to modernity's Taylorist techniques.23 For Blanchot, in 1947, "What is surprising is that Sade suppresses desire and seems to suspect it rather than emphasizing it and raising it to the highest level of importance."24 Sade cannot afford desire an active role in his endless permutation of the sexual, for it permits an experience of the body-as-other; it marks the limit at which self-enclosure dissolves. The reason for this, says Blanchot, is that desire denies solitude and leads to a dangerous acknowledgment of the field, internal and external, of others. Acknowledgment of dissonance arising from within the self dangerously opens onto a permeable relation to the contingency of the field exterior to the subject. Sade, as read by Blanchot, is adamant that the body serve as instrument by which to coordinate the self and regain order over a porous inside/outside field of alterity. To convert the body into a means of transcen- dence, it must be compressed and mediated through a necessary moment of anesthetization or insensibility, after which it will attain its apogee in systematiza- tion. "The subject, having destroyed everything within itself has accumulated an immense strength. All these mighty libertines are mighty only because they have eliminated in themselves all capacity for sensation. They have made themselves insensitive."25 The ultimate impasse, corporeality-as-difference, is appropriated and thus transformed into an absolute way out through a specific order of operations. Adorno and Horkheimer, preceding Blanchot, similarly state the libertine feat: "All will be overcome when one strives to suppress the excessive sensitivity which is irreconcilable with the maxims of [rationalist] philosophy" (DE, p. 102). The Dialectic of Enlightenment traces the monstrosities of twentieth-century moder- nity to the underbelly of the Enlightenment. Here, the Marquis de Sade, historically contemporaneous with Enlightenment philosophy, crystallizes the contradictory implications of Enlightenment thought by driving it to excess, push- ing it to its logical extremes, thereby distilling its internal contradictions and negations. Sade represents the moment in a philosophical unfolding where Kantian thought begins to spill over into its diametrical opposite: anti- Enlightenment thought, expressed here in the figure of Nietzsche. Adorno and Horkheimer argue that "Sade makes the scientistic the destructive principle" (DE, p. 94). For he balances tensely between the autocriticism and empiricism charac- 23.

Monstrosity thus hinges on the seamless, structural resolution of heterogeneous terms. For enlightenment "means no more than that, by virtue of thought's own consistency, it organizes the individual data of cognition into system. It makes a certain collective unity the aim of the operations of the understanding. This unity is the system" (DE, p. 81). To underscore their point, Adorno and Horkheimer quote Kant's Critique of Pure Reason: "'the systemizing of knowledge is its coher- ence according to one principle."'(DE, p. 81). This, in turn, addresses the problem of neutrality, the empty core echoing within universal rationality-empty in that it is no longer contingent on specific phenomena, the tangled configurations internal to the limits of that organization. In Kant, for Adorno and Horkheimer, [the] homogeneity of the general and the particular is guaranteed by the schematization of pure understanding. The understanding impresses the intelligibility of matter on it as an objective quality, before it enters into the ego. Without such a schematization, no impression would har- monize with a concept, no category with an example; and the unity of thought (let alone system) toward which everything is directed, would not prevail. [DE, p. 82, italics mine]. Defined in this way, reason begins to eclipse the object of perception, achiev- ing the very reverse of its claim to truth. It hypostatizes its object as already cut to the form of a given template. This, obviously, generates a circular logic wherein system interpolates all object experience, which then reinforces that very rationale. This appropriation crystallizes in Sade's heroine Juliette, who enacts her sex- ual gymnastics and murders voraciously, all the while operating in the elegant, empirical mode of self-reflexivity. Adorno and Horkheimer thus locate the single knot in which Juliette's mode of sexuality and the regimentation of the body in the modern, bureaucratized state are tied: The strict regimentation of modern sport has its exact counterpart in the sexual teams of Juliette, which employ every moment usefully, neglect no human orifice and carry out every function. The architec- tonic structure of the Kantian system, like the gymnastic pyramids of Sade's orgies-the strict regimentation of the libertine society of 120 Journees-reveals an organization of life.... These arrangements amount not so much to pleasure as to its regimented pursuit, the schema of an activity. [DE, p. 88, emphasis mine] Having demonstrated the schematization of pure logic constructed around a single, unified principle (and its unwitting link to the material and physical), the authors evoke the strictly quarantined, self-generating schema of modernist</page><page sequence="14">Piero Manzoni: "We Want to Organicize Disintegration" 41 painting.26 Adorno and Horkheimer continue: 'Juliette embodies neither unsubli- mated nor regressive libido, but the pleasure of attacking civilization with its own weapons. She favors system. She is a proficient manipulator of the organ of rational thought [DE, pp. 94-95]." Sadean logic, inscribed over an expropriated term, is of dual import to the tension central to Fontana and his system, Broodthaers and hisjellyfish: the prob- lem of system and body. In Sade, however, the problem is resolved through a totalizing structure that generates itself through a set of erasures. The carnal and the systematic, the mutual foundation of one upon the other in a contiguous simultaneity, are reorganized as a single self-supporting loop. The corporeal-as both experiential and objectified-is nevertheless revealed as the stuff of Sadean permutation. Thus, despite modernism's claim to have "liberated" itself under the zoning laws of self-sustained logic, Sade stages the extent to which this purge operates as an internal consolidation. In this sense, Sade enacts a transgression of existent norms only insofar as he reincorporates the results of that transgression into his paradoxically monstrous-as-pristine rationality. To the extent that Sade becomes a locus of postwar critical thought, Manzoni channels the terms of the critique through the space of artistic produc- tion. His work inhabits the Sadean architecture as a strategy through which to dismantle it and regenerate heterogeneity from a univocal order. The question that remains is this: After its apparent disavowal within a homogenized surface, what would corporeality be were it to push through that field? Moreover, how would it emerge without reinvesting and revalidating the representational and figurative ruses, the mythologies that modernist painting had thankfully buried? Blanchot has remarked on the impossibility of recovering what has slid under the "brutal abstract exigency" of the universal. Speaking of a silent contingency, or that which eludes systemic conceptualization, he states, 26. Adorno and Horkheimer see the Enlightenment as having bifurcated at the start of its develop- ment, thus having set two diametrically opposed threads into movement. On one hand, the Enlightenment unfurls a tautological empiricism, a scientistic rationality threatening to eliminate self- reflexive thought. On the other hand, the Enlightenment introduces the notion of the self-reflexive subject. These threads, dialectically related within their common originary field of Enlightenment thought, distill out to two aspects of modernity and modernism. Yet the authors seem to struggle at this juncture: they fail to see the extent to which the two never developed independently of each other, but remained inextricable and interdependent. In other words, rather than operating as two separate threads, each term locates an aspect of itself in the other. Adorno and Horkheimer see this entwinement in operation in early Enlightenment work. But this entanglement-the machinic folded into the machinic-is not acknowledged in modernist painting. They problematize the culture indus- try and its Enlightenment legacy without registering the extent to which high culture-the space for self-reflexive thought-is also deeply implicated in system's rationality.</page><page sequence="15">42 OCTOBER To approach such a movement, one must contradict oneself. What lags and falls back is also what is most important, for it brings us back to existence in its very spontaneity as it is lived, in the moment when, lived, it escapes every speculative formulation, perhaps all coherence, all regularity.27 Thus, an attempt to recapture the contingency of material and experiential process through figuration erases it again. In figural representation, at this histor- ical junction, the corporeal no longer elaborates itself but becomes coordinated to the economy of image, a new postwar template: spectacle. Blanchot refers to this emergent postwar variant of rational systematicity, spectacle, as "the reign of an enormous tautology."28 By contrast, Manzoni does not pretend to wrest mater- ial presence free of a set of rigid structural determinations-one of which would be the mapped-out pictorial surface, the visual schema. Pretension to an emanci- pated corporeality renders presence vulnerable to the eventual expropriation of a seeming expressive freedom within the order of postwar spectacle culture. For instance, some postwar artists came to terms with modernism's exclusion of the body by, ironically, absorbing it anew into another purifying tautology. For an example of the body newly effaced through its spectacularized presentation, think of Yves Klein's Anthropometrie works, where the artist had the naked female body, covered in paint, impress its silhouette on a surface.

Staging was explicitly situated as the central organizing drive behind the resultant images. Paradoxically, the tac- tile and performative dimensions of Klein's strategy become rechanneled through a scopic, spectacular organization. By contrast, the Achromes' very deployment of a modernist syntax unravels the systematicity of that language from an internal vantage. Manzoni initiates the analytical rigor of modernist painting, the self-reflexive elaboration of its terms, alongside the insistence of a radical-and silent-corporeality. It is present, bor- dering on the limits of metaphor yet refusing to crystallize as figure. Rather, it circulates as part object, and as that modality of biradial, unformed body recalling the jellyfish. And it is proffered metonymically--as food, an appeal to oral and anal somatic processes. Extended elastically in the membranous viscosity of Manzoni's kaolin admixture, the body stands, ineffable, as the very condition for the possibility of artistic production. Manzoni thus deploys the Sadean dialectic of body and system, as well as the discipline of an axiomatically deduced formalism. Where Sade proceeds from cor- poreality and appropriates it to a tautological rationality, Manzoni departs from structure, allowing it the resonance of its own internal material contradictions. And where Sade's sexuality as difference-from-norm paradoxically catalogs that difference in order to render it same by submitting to the unitary structure of the inventory, Manzoni unpeels systematicity from its repressed terms. Yet, the system- aticity of a [now received] modernism remains, present yet unraveled, confronted with its own foreclosures within the very forms that had enforced them. Manzoni: "We want to organicize disintegration. In a disintegrated world, we want to be able to discover and reveal to ourselves the inner structures."29 What does this manifesto-like assertion suggest? That modernism-and its analyt- ically elaborated fundamentalist structures (grid, monochrome)-understood now as disembodied systematicity under the pressure of its postwar reception, nevertheless remains present in its unraveling? That inner structure could be neg- atively redeemed through an encounter with its material and corporeal Other? This is where Adorno's and Horkheimer's imperative that Enlightenment thought acknowledge its recidivist repression of the Other within, where Blanchot's cri- tique of Sade's sexual equations, comes in. Still, the term "organicize" occupies a troublesome position. No traditional sense of the organic as holistic, natural plen- itude develops in Manzoni's project. There is no ontologically stable base, just a material aggregate acting as a pulsatile pressure in, through, and around "structure." Recall, once more, the Achrome with bread rolls, in which the rolls, casting shadows over the modular organization of the grid, which they themselves consti- tute, emphasize their reactive embodiment only to sink back into the grid. Similarly, the white, unifying wash refuses the unity of the monochrome even as it 29.

Rather, the Achromes' surfaces eddy and settle, as both anterior matrix and interior gesture, as the kaolin and paint material shifts from one aggregate state to the next (it appears both liquid and solid, viscid, like egg). The visible disobedience of the surface to the monochrome's claim for a sin- gular common denominator corresponds with Manzoni's assertion that surface is itself "the living flesh." This theoretical approach to the white flat plane, in turn, found its way into Manzoni's practical approach to process. Many of the early Achromes of 1958, and later in 1962-63, came to formation after an (anti) process of virtual neglect. After coating the surface with disparate materials, such as gesso, kaolin, resin, white paint, and polystyrene, the artist left the mixture to itself. The components combined, bonded, and deteriorated in a mode specific to the caustic potential of materials. The "blank" surface, having gone through a physical process resulting in a textured distribution of substances, was then declared a finished work.30 The self-elaboration of the corporealized surface informs Manzoni's investi- gation of somatic experience, recognized as continually active at the core of art production. For instance, in 1960, he translates the residual trace of physical pres- 30. This evokes Dust Breeding, Man Ray's photograph of The Large Glass, taken after Duchamp had allowed dust to accumulate for some time in layers of varying density, which he then chemically fixed to the glass surface. The Achromes, of course, relinquish that level of control. Manzoni. Thumbprints. 1960. ? 2001 Artists Rights Society (ARS), New York/SIAE, Rome.

Here, the thumbprint func- tions as the artist's mark-the substitution for the authorial gesture-yet presents two contradictory understandings of that subject's presence. As indexical trace of the artist's body, the print eidetically references a unique identity. In punning response, Manzoni presents the thumbprints enlarged in multiply run litho- graphs. Monumentalized, front and center, they function as a portrait of the subject. This presentation posits the fingerprint as an original and originary site of the mark-making process. Manzoni had stated, smartass-artist-style, that "if the collectors wanted something intimate, truly of the artist's person, that the finger- print was the most unique sign of the person who'd imprinted it."31 This statement alerts us to the other understanding of the print mark. For nothing could be more generic than the indexical trace of a finger. The indexical trace is shown to operate doubly. As a corporeal shutter entering into the condi- tion of the sign, which is to say, a status irreparably cut off from the concrete condition of its production and reception, the index enacts the dialectical entwinement of system and material.32 It enables a rigid, conceptual grid by which 31.

Materiality both falls out as mute ground, and is retroactively assigned an identity. In Manzoni, by contrast, those terms do not circulate in a general equivalence, but waver back and forth, implicating the other's alterity. Presented in rows and columns in a second series of lithographs (1960), the thumbprints again fall into line with the grid, which is made to acknowledge its peculiar mimetic inscription in the rationale of industrial production techniques. For the print, as both serial and singular, meets the demands of said collectors. An egg, Manzoni's most commonly deployed "support" for the thumbprint, attenuates the pulsatile suspension in which modernism's contradictory terms are held. The egg asserts the pristine, pure whiteness of its fully enclosed shell. The joke is on the grid. And it stands impervious to any mimetic, metaphorical rela- tionship one could futilely attempt to ascribe to it. An egg is an egg, grounded in the tautological concretion of itself, like a monochrome. Manzoni's eggs lend 33. One may recall the many archival projects to which the fingerprint has been harnessed.

He then drives the egg- as-surface further by emphasizing its necessarily rigid enclosure (without which it would spill into a pile of goo) by placing it in a wooden frame. Mise-en-abyme, the artificial enclosure echoes at once the organic egg shell and the mythical closure of modernist painting. Finally, the egg overlays the set of determinations and evocations enumer- ated above with an equally doubled introduction of the body. On two levels: first, the eggs (and bread rolls), food, metonymically extend as objects of somatic inter- nalization. In 1960, Manzoni held an opening at which guests consumed the entirety of a large bowl of hard-boiled eggs, presented as individual art works. On another level, the eggs recall the body as Broodthaers later defines it. Within the skin/shell that discretely encloses the mucous substance, the egg is indeterminate body. Egg with Thumbprint No. 37 (1960), for instance, reveals traces of fluid egg forming solid patterns over the cracked shell as the kaolin admixture had spread over the bread rolls. The support (goo) leaks out to double as mark over the sup- port (shell); it functions as both figure and ground in a codetermining tie. Likewise, in an egg Achrome from 1961-62, Manzoni suspends sixteen eggs in a yel- lowish clear resin, as though the eggs were suspended in their own filling. The cracks over the resin surface redouble the cracks of the eggs it displays. The objects, in other words, appear to be contained by their own contents. The artist thus marks the susceptibility of exterior to interior pressure, as well as the reverse.</page><page sequence="21">48 OCTOBER The connective tissue enabling the execution of the work operates on both the inside and outside of the armature, the shell. This interior/exterior fold inverts Sade's strategic disciplinary arrangement of the inside--libidinal drives-as a means by which to transcend the outside. Manzoni's Lines (1959)34 radicalize the ascetic presentation/withholding of process and trace.35 The Lines at once internalize the mechanistic logic of the grid on the level of procedure and emphasize the artist's trace negatively by absenting all material concretion. Here, Manzoni sits down in front of a cog appa- ratus and draws in the nodding state between active and passive, a worker on an assembly line, while a roll feeds the paper through. The length of the precut piece of scroll determines the extension of the final line, which gets rolled up and set in a canister marked with its dimensions and its time of execution. Rather than Duchamp's dandy-like canned chance,36 we are left with the packaged idea of process, referenced in calibrated terms. And rather than the libidinally motivated line, as in Pollock's work, we are confronted with a material trace divested of its [spectacularized] emancipatory energy. Recalling Juliette's sexual labors, which measured and ultimately arrested corporeal sensation through proto-Taylorist means, the Sadean structure remains at stake. Here, visual and physical plenitude is the last concern. The work manifestly recognizes mediation and calibration as the only possibility of presenting matter and process, a knot that paradoxically defers it. The armature that presents/withholds, negatively marks materiality and corporeal inscription as absent. On the other hand, Manzoni introduces the "anonymous toil," constitutive of the industrial object. The realization of that erasure surfaces reconfigured. The lines' foreclosure insinuates the specific experience of an anonymous subject, the worker/maker whose trace is engulfed by the parameters of the product. Still, what happens to the body here? The trace is recorded and conceptualized, held in silence. We are confronted with a frame, here a container, such that the picture itself withdraws. This use of modernist logic nevertheless yields to a frustrated acknowledgment of alterity: not this, but other than this entangled in this, consti- tuting it and comprised of it. The Lines withhold the corporeal trace doubly: as it folds into the industrial procedure and as it stands in reserve, packaged. It thus paradoxically shores it up, designating its absence as absence, which nevertheless marks it as other. 34. I am not adhering to a linear chronology in discussing the works because Manzoni develops one series-lines, eggs, Achromes-simultaneously with others, going back and forth. 35. Line in Manzoni's work appears to be suspended between Pollock's gestural line-scale and spatial extension are operative terms-and Duchamp's line in Three Standard Stoppages, produced through the chance operation of letting a meter-long piece of yarn fall, then tracing its configuration to make a line. Manzoni's index is not personal imprint, but the index of procedure in a Duchampian mode. On the other hand, rather than the result of a total chance operation, as in Duchamp's Stoppages, Manzoni's lines derive from highly controlled material determinations: a marking mecha- nism arranged over a long roll of paper on an assembly-line apparatus. 36. I am referencing Duchamp's Three Standard Stoppages of 1913.</page><page sequence="22">Merde d'artista (nos. 004, 059, 038, 033). 1961.0 2001 Artists Rights Society (ARS), New York/SIAE, Rome. The Sadean system was interpreted in the postwar period as achieving the reverse. Seeming to luxuriate in the body, Sade's writing constructed it as a frame through which to work out a self-sustaining logic. Alongside the monstrosity of Sade's abstraction stands the horror (and monotony) of an abstraction paradoxi- cally embellished around shit. In The 120 Days of Sodom, the reader catalogs through endless accounts of libertines and their coordinated consumption of fecal matter, a process that perfectly mimes a well-engineered plan for the organi- zation of labor. The subject whose body produces the desired product (shit) must internally arrange him or herself to ensure the optimum quantity of feces at regu- lar intervals, eaten at correspondingly even intervals. In addition, the axis from anal to oral and back again ensures that all subjects involved are interchangeable parts in a closed circuit.37 With the series Merda d'artista (1961) Manzoni fills soup-can-like canisters with his own shit,38 and labels them with content, weight, their date of produc- tion, and an assurance of "natural" (i.e., industrial) preservation. Of course, actual matter and corporeal procedure are secured away from sight, smell, and 37. In "The Use Value of D.A.F. de Sade," Bataille notes that the ritual performed along the oral/anal axis is "a process of appropriation characterized by a homogeneity (static equilibrium) of the author of appropriation, and of objects as a final result" (Visions ofExcess, p. 95). 38. Apparently, the cans are filled with tomato paste, the quintessential Italian export product. Perhaps the two are interchangeable.</page><page sequence="23">Piero Manzoni signing a Live Sculpture. 1961. ? 2001 Artists Rights Society (ARS), New York/SIAE, Rome.</page><page sequence="24">Piero Manzoni: "We Want to Organicize Disintegration" 51 physical presence. Recall the Sadean dialectic where the body, mediated through a necessary moment of anesthetization or insensibility, will attain its apogee in sys- tematization. Here, corporeality as material vestige, as waste antiseptically sealed off, attains a similar elevated status in production/consumption systems. The affixed label factually announces itself in several languages, presumably for the benefit of the global art market. Somatic presence is nevertheless articulated as an irreducible condition of artmaking. That it is deferred, tucked away from immediate perception and instant recognition (gratification) ultimately emphasizes its salience. The Live Sculpture series of 1961 stages the body, in part or whole, as the work of art. Here, Manzoni issued tickets proclaiming a person, or part of a per- son's body-that of friends, collectors, and audience members at the gallery where the event took place-as his work. A purple ticket signifies that the occu- pier of said body or body part also owns it, that he or she had acquired the piece. Thus, the collector acquires his/her own body part, often signed by Manzoni, reconfigured through the discursively understood institution of art production and consumption. The body does appear literally, figured concretely. Yet it is all the more sus- pended than in Merda d'artista and the Lines. In this context, Manzoni acknowledges the condition of the nude, partaking in the institutionalized form of the arranged body. For the first time in Manzoni's oeuvre, the body is articulated vertically, supported by an anthropomorphic armature, formed. The single instance in which the body appears reveals it as fully expropriated and homoge- nized. For in manifest quotation of the category of the nude, a woman sits poised on a base, her arm held in a mannered pose. Face turned tensely, every hair on her head holds its place in an equally mannered hairdo, while a sheet over her lower torso recalls classical statuary. "Manzoni, 1961" is signed over the side of her torso. Obviously, she is naked. But, as she is articulated in accordance with the for- mal logic of classicism and bares an artist's signature on her skin, she is a nude, a cultural template of sorts. Her body, in all of its potential specificity, recedes into the hardened mold. That language mapped onto the body, which it then internal- izes as it organizes its muscles to hold the configuration, operates as an armature equivalent to this woman's native skeletal system.39 In another, similar photograph of an enactment of that category of object production entitled "art," Manzoni signs another awkwardly posed woman, her head in a classical three-quarter tilt. He places his name right at the base of her spine, assigning the body "a" structuring principle. This strategy recalls Juliette, the proficient manipulator of rational systems who enacts her logic through a 39. It is critical to-note, at this juncture, that the human body is also understood as a system according to the definition of body that Broodthaers had articulated. Broodthaers's "body" had surfaced as excess/lack vis-a-vis armature. If Manzoni deploys a materiality as excess/lack, it operates as contiguous to structure. The vertical human body functions as a site of the always already entwined status of these two terms.</page><page sequence="25">CARTE 0' AUTHENTICITE No On certifie quo.e ~ a 6t6 sign6 (e) par ma main et pour autant est consider6 (e) a partir de la date ci-dessous oeuvre d'art authentique et veritable. siolature le DECLARATION OF AUTHENTICITY No- 71 This is to cewtlfy that k{~ - has been signed by my hand and therefore is to be considered as an authentic work of art for all intents and purposes as of the date below.

Of and with her body, for instance, Juliette constructs an elabo- rate accounting system. After having calculated that she has "been had 128 times one way, 128 another"-in perfect numerical symmetry, composing her postures in a refined classical architecture, 256 added up-she records her carefully engi- neered Easter orgy. Signing his classicized nude, Manzoni nevertheless enacts a critique of the discursive structures that determine the work, as well as the era- sures they enact on the body-which nevertheless also determine the work in its numbed suspension.40 Another variation on Manzoni's issuance of authentication slips was a cer- tificate that Marcel Broodthaers received, entitled Declaration of Authenticity No.071, proclaiming his physical entirety to be a work of art. Both Manzoni and Broodthaers held a document stating the place and date of certification, much as the canisters containing the lines carried a label denoting length, and time of execution. This transaction fully institutionalizes-fully grids and formalizes-the body, pushing the logic of systems determination. Yet this act also reveals the impossibility of systematicity. Drawing it into perception as a formal work, Manzoni's gesture fully stages the inability to account for the body's development and experience prior to formalization, a gesture challenging the ontologically- bound notion of body as ground. Sade, too, had authored a similar game. In a scene in Juliette, which takes place at the discrete Chateau of Silling, the objects of the Libertine's sexual inter- est are marked with different colors. The purpose of this mark is to direct and then denote each victim's "deflowering." The permission to distribute the ribbon is reserved to one of the four "gentlemen." Because two sites of the female body- the object now in question-can be penetrated, the mark is a dual one. It designates appropriation (to a certain libertine) and localization. Roland Barthes 40. This work once again functions as a kind of reversal of Yves Klein's Anthropometrie enactments. There, Klein's naked lady, freed from enclosure and performing in real space, purportedly stands out- side those determinations. And yet, spectacularized, another vise fully encloses her.</page><page sequence="26">Piero Manzoni: "We Want to Organicize Disintegration" 53 has pointed out that "It is at once an indication of ownership and an act of identi- fication and a fetishist gesture. All of these aims are to be found in the linguistic nature of the mark: as we know it is the basic act of meaning.... Ownership, mer- chandise, and fetish come together in the meaning."41 Also a fetishist's gesture, Manzoni's certificate-of-authenticity work, comprised of formal rules setting the limits of the schema, nonetheless stages the body's failure to comply, as well as the system's failure to elaborate itself other than with and through its internal alterity. Manzoni's object production does not occupy the space of the self-identical, unified, and tautological-there is no univocal ordering principle. Instead, an agglomeration of paradigms is set into dissonant operation critical of, yet inter- nal to, structural determination. In deploying the schema generative of the modernist monochrome, grid, and readymade, alongside the irreducible corpore- ality of the support, Manzoni complicates the postwar condition of general equivalence characterized by the simultaneous availability of avant-gardist and modernist paradigms. Corporealizing, marking the material and somatic inscription embedded within that visual armature, he simultaneously rejects any possibility of exit or space exterior to those systems/molds. Articulating materiality thus, Manzoni develops a corpus that insists that production cannot limit itself to a self-enclosed or self-determined and violently disembodied discursive space. It starts, then, where Sadean logic ends. It presents a negative response to Sade, the figure who crystallizes a strand of modernism as postwar intellectual circles present it. Manzoni's work operates on the register of material and corporeal tissue, at the points where structure and system begin to dissolve under their own pressure. Having dismantled the internally institutional- ized parameters of disembodied form, this work opens onto the critical work of the subsequent generation of European artists.42 Upon Manzoni's death, Broodthaers stated, Is there a connection between his untimely death and the attitude that he took in the context of art. It is most certain that insisting on this kind of humor was not a very comfortable position to have taken. And if this should be the reason, then our inquiry into artistic events, into all kinds of events will have to be profound and thorough. In any case Manzoni will be in the history books of the terrible twentieth century.43 41. Roland Barthes, Sade, Fourier, Loyola, trans.
