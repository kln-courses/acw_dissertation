Pp. 289 and XVI plates. The great religions of India offer a boundless field of research, but of no less import are the minor cults devoted to the numberless spirits which are believed to haunt the trees of the forest and the sources of the rivers. It may even be asserted that the numberless godlings comprised under the general name of devatc are of far greater personal interest to the masses of the rural population than the great gods of the Hindu Pantheon, too lofty and remote to take cognizance of the needs of the humble villager. Among those minor cults tree worship is one of the most fascinating. This is evi- denced by Madame Viennot's book in which in- numerable passages from Brahmanical and Buddhist literature have been systematically arranged and discussed. It also plainly shows the enormous progress made in the study of this subject since James Fergusson published his imposing volume Tree and Serpent Worship (1868). The first part of Madame Viennot' s book (pp. 2 -98) deals with tree worship according to Vedic, Puranic and epic texts, the second part (pp. 99-238) with the prominence of the tree in Buddhist lore, particularly in the legendary life of the Buddha Sakyamuni. The author points out (p. 129) that three important events of his existence are asso- ciated with a particular tree. His birth in the Lumbini garden took place under a sida or a plaksha tree, a branch being seized by his mother Maya. He attained supreme wisdom under the asvattha (Ficus religiosa) at Uruvilva near Gaya which as the Bodhi-tree remained the central object of Buddhist worship until the present day. The sala grove near the town of the Mallas was the scene of his final extinction. The accounts of these three great events (to which one of minor importance, viz. the first meditation under the jambu tree is added) as well as their expression in Buddhist art, supply the nucleus of the second part of Madame Viennot's book. As the artistic and iconographical expression is likely to have a special interest for readers of Artibus Asia, we restrict our review to a few observations on this subject. In Vedic times the tree is conceived as a sentient being. It is called vanaspati and in the Atharvaveda we find this name coupled with herbs (oshadhi), Gandharvas, Apsarasas, serpents, Yakshas (punya- jana) and ancestral spirits (pitaras). The word vanaspati is usually rendered by "lord of the forest", but it is not a poetical term like padapa (lit. " foot-drinker") and naga ("non-walker") which are comparatively modern. It goes back to more primitive times and should be associated and grouped with compounds like vashtoshpati (genius loci), Brihaspati, Brahmanaspati and Manasa- spati. In Buddhist literature the tree-spirit has become anthropomorphic (pp. 104- Io8). The Pali Jataka- book contains several delightful tales in which the dryads (rukkhadevatd) 1 play a prominent part. They usually haunt a definite tree but when danger threatens they can remove to another abode as in the Rukkhadhamma-jdtaka where they fly to the Himalaya. They are worshipped with flowers, in- cense and water and are expected in return to grant sons and daughters, honour and wealth. In the Kundakapuva-jdtaka the dryad of an eranda 1 The term vrikshaka, applied to tree-spirits by modern authors, does not seem to be warranted by ancient literature and should be discarded. 87</page><page sequence="2">(ricinus) rewards his poor devotee by informing him that all around pots of treasure are buried. Madame Viennot (p. 125) draws attention to a curious scene found on the railing of Bharhut 2. It shows a tree from whose trunk two hands emerge, the right holding a ceremonial vessel (Skt. bhrin- gara) and the left a pot, evidently filled with treasure. A man sitting on a stool opposite the tree holds up his right hand, whilst another person, partly visible behind him, seems to walk away with a pouch which the tree-spirit has granted him. The relief is provided with a Brahmi inscription jabi Nadodepavate, meaning "Thejambu tree on mount Nadoda". Evidently the relief pictures a donation made in optima forma by a tree spirit, but the story to which it refers has not been traced in Buddhist literature. Madame Viennot follows Coomaraswamy who connects it with a legend re- lated in the commentary of the Dhammapada, about 500 ascetics who on their way from the Himalaya to Kausambi are supplied with food and water by a large banyan tree (Ficus indica). But the late professor Liders3 has rightly rejected this identi- fication, as, instead of 500 ascetics we see only two persons not dressed as ascetics, and the mu- nificent tree is not a nyagrodha, but a jambu. Another relief of the Bharhut railing (p. 122, pl. III A) shows a tree, the trunk provided with a chabitra, i. e. a stone platform intended as a resting-place for weary travellers. 4 It is surrounded by three 2 A.

The inscription migasamadakamz chet[i]yam has been differently explained by various scholars; but Pro- fessor Liiders has undoubtedly hit the mark by explaining it as "the siesta of the wild animals". He quotes Pali bhattasammada meaning "a snooze after a meal" and adds: "The relief is an excellent rendering of the siesta of the antelopes but also illustrates the peace between them and the lions. In all probability the chaitya owed its name to the miracle of all beasts of the wood meeting here without hurting each other 5. Both at Bharhut and Sanchi we find charming scenes picturing a sacred tree worshipped by wild animals. The example from Bharhut, mentioned by Madame Viennot (p. 122) shows a tree, re- cognisable from the shape of its leaves as a mango tree, with the usual stone chabutrd in the midst of a rocky landscape. The tree is approached by two elephants, the larger one carrying a non-descript object in his trunk as an offering whilst the smaller one at his side seems to kneel. The inscription, interpreted by Professor Luders, locates the scene on Mount Amboda, i.e. the Mango Mountain 6. The same motif we find, more decoratively treated, on the famous toranas of Sanchi. The central com- partment of the top lintel (back) of the northern gateway 7 shows a nyagrodha flanked by two stately elephants standing in a lotus-pond and carrying bunches of lotus-fibres and surrounded by their young ones (pl. III, fig. B). The middle lintel of the eastern torana is decorated with an 5 Liiders, op. cit., pp. 21 f. 6 Cunningham, op. cit., pl.

The first part of Madame Viennot's book (pp. 93- 98) concludes with a detailed and valuable account of the festival of Indra's banner which is often mentioned in Sanskrit literature. The author quotes a passage from the Mahabharata (Adiparvan, adhydya 63) in which the institution of this festival is related. - The Paurava king Uparicara, after conquering the Cedi country, devotes himself to an ascetic life. The ardour of his tapas alarms the gods and Indra at their request induces him to resume his royal dignity by promising him a ce- lestial chariot, a garland of unwithering flowers, procuring victory and invulnerability, and a bamboo pole for the protection of the righteous and pacific. When a year had elapsed, the king planted that pole and from that day all kings planted a bamboo mast for the worship of Indra. At the moment when Uparicara instituted the festival Indra himself appeared in the shape of a goose (hamsaripena) to accept the offerings and declared that all rulers who would observe this ceremony would attain good fortune and victory for their realms. Madame Viennot recognizes this myth in one of the two remarkable rock-sculptures9 found on 8 Ibidem, pl. XLVI. The central tree, according to Foucher, symbolizes the Buddha Sakyamuni. 9 The two Bhaja reliefs have frequently been re- produced. The best reproduction is found in James Burgess, The ancient Monuments, Temples and Sculptures of India, London, Part II, p. 20, pl. 178. both sides of the entrance to a cell of the Buddhist convent of Bhaja. Evidently these two large reliefs, attributed to the third or second century B. C., do not pertain to Buddhism. One represents Surya on his chariot drawn by four horses, the other Indra seated on his elephant. The author draws attention to the conspicuous garland worn by Indra round his neck and to the banner held by the attendant who is seated behind him. Both these objects, according to the account above quoted, were promised by Indra to Uparicara. Moreover it is a point of special interest that we can discern the head of a goose issuing from the railing enclosing the sacred tree in front of the elephant. It is there- fore very tempting to accept Madame Viennot's ingenuous interpretation, despite some details which seems to militate against it, viz. the action of Indra's elephant in seizing one of the three sacred trees and trampling on another and the absence of king Uparicara, the hero of the story. Anyhow, the explanation of the mysterious relief offered by the author is certainly far more accep- table than the attempts made by two other dis- tinguished scholars to interpret it from Buddhist literature. 10 We cordially recommend Madame Viennot's book to all students of Indian religion and art. 7.
