BURNHAM BRIDGEND (1) Bridgend, 16 Adare Street (SS 90606 79811): a watching-brief on an area only 15 m from the recorded site of a coin hoard of the second half of the third century A.D. failed to locate any associated finds or features.1 CAERPHILLY (1) Gelligaer, Dan-y-gaer House (ST 1340 9729): excavations to test the results of a geophysical survey which appeared to show the ditch of the early fort, and two buildings in the extramural area, found that there was only limited evidence for activity, all immediately adjacent to the house, and no evidence for structures. The anomaly which had been thought to be a bath- house had been caused by iron pan and a bonfire, and the ditch turned out to be non-defensive, probably defining a post-medieval trackway.2 CARDIFF (1) Cardiff, Cardiff Castle (ST 181 766): a watching-brief at the base of the E and N ramparts during drainage works recorded archaeological deposits in seven soakaway pits, each 1 m square and 1 m deep. Roman deposits included a soil horizon and beam slots, sealed by medieval bank material.3 (2) Rumney, Wentlooge Avenue (ST 223 784): field evaluation on the interface between the estuarine deposits of the Wentlooge Level and the solid geology failed to find any evidence for Roman activity, though this interface is known elsewhere as a focus for settlement.4 (3) Rumney Great Wharf (ST 239 779-ST 251 787): a walkover survey, watching-brief, and limited excavation were undertaken close to the area examined in 1992.5 Since then, the wharf has locally retreated c. 30 m and no certain correlation could be made with the ditches recorded previously, except in the case of one which was on the same alignment as ditch C2 excavated in 1992, and may have been a continuation of it. The structural remains consisted of three ditches all containing Roman pottery, the bottoms of which were at different levels (4.5 m, 4.7 m and 4.8 m OD), and a feature of unknown but possibly industrial purpose consisting of an extensive spread of fired clay and charcoal, part of which had slumped into the fill of one of the ditches.6 1 Watching-brief for Midas Construction Ltd was supervised for the Glamorgan-Gwent Archaeological Trust (Contracts Division) by R.

BURNHAM (4) St Mellons, Trowbridge Road (ST 23550 79750): evaluation found several in-situ stone spreads dating to the late second or early third century A.D., one of which proved to be the corner of a building. A system of second-century drainage ditches appeared to have had their banks deliberately slighted. All Roman features were sealed beneath later alluvium.7 CARMARTHENSHIRE (1) Llandovery (SN 770 352): a fluxgate gradiometer survey across three fields NW of the modem road recorded details about the fort and its immediate environs (FIG. 2). The outline of the NE part of the fort is clearly visible, represented by two ditches at the N comer and a possible third delineating the outside of the defences. The interior contains a mass of overlapping anomalies, almost certainly indicating several phases of activity. The via principalis is well defined with an internal drain running along its SW and possibly its NE side. One large building in the latera praetorii is probably a double granary to judge from the multiple, closely-spaced, transverse features within its interior. The praetentura appears to contain barracks arranged per strigas. There are clearly several phases of structure in the retentura, including at least one long FIG. 2.

Holbrook sent information. 385</page><page sequence="4">ROMAN BRITAIN IN 2004 building arranged per strigas. There appears to be a substantial annexe NE of the fort, which again contains several phases of activity. A possible array of three ditches on the NE side, which can only be traced with certainty for c. 30 m, might be part of a much larger earlier fort now largely masked by later activity. Two or perhaps three lines of strong anomalies immediately NE of the fort are best interpreted as a series of kilns or ovens; further similar anomalies appear to lie within a building or enclosure. Industrial activity on this scale could indicate a works depot attached to the fort. Although it is difficult to discern any pattern across the rest of the annexe, there are suggestions of a roadside vicus close to the modem road.8 CEREDIGION (1) Llanio (SN 6437 5639): a bronze patera was found by the river close to the fort during metal detecting (FIG. 3). It is now in two parts: the handle and upper part of the rim (150 mm diameter) are almost complete; the base, which has deep turned grooves in its bottom face, is separate.9 GWYNEDD (1) Roman road, Caer Gai to Varis, at Cefn-ddwysarn (SH 9615 3805): two stone surfaces FIG. 3.

The lower one, interpreted as being the Roman road, comprised rounded but flattish cobbles, interspersed with small pebbles laid on the natural clay. The upper surface was interpreted as a post-Roman coach road.10 MONMOUTHSHIRE (1) Caerwent (Venta Silurum): (a) Westgate Cottage (ST 4666 9061): a tumble of sandstone against the town wall recorded during a watching-brief may originally have been stonework from the W gate. However, positive evidence for a N tower was not forthcoming and it is suggested that any remains probably lie beneath the cottage; if this is the case the Roman gateway would be no wider than 22 m.11 (b) 27 Highfield (ST 4742 9024): a watching-brief close to where isolated burial groups of probable Roman date have been recorded failed to find any features of Roman date.12 (c) Army Training Estate (ST 477 914): during works for a pipeline N of the town, a sherd of Oxford mortarium and a possible second sherd of Roman pottery were noted in topsoil, but no associated structures.13 (d) 20 Lawrence Crescent (SO 4724 9082): during groundworks for a new house, Severn Valley and black-burnished wares were found together with post-medieval pottery.14 (e) 3 Llanvair Road (ST 467 908): a watching-brief produced pottery and other Roman material but no significant features.15 (2) Crick (ST 4898 9018): field evaluation near the presumed line of the Roman road, and c. 250 m from the point where early Roman pottery has previously been found, located a small assemblage of pottery, but no related features.16 (3) Magor Pill sewage works (ST 4370 8500): a watching-brief, close to where pottery and burials of Roman date have previously been located, found no archaeological features or artefacts of Roman date.17 (4) Monmouth: (a) 66-68 Monnow Street (SO 5016 1266): archaeological recording during redevelopment work identified the usual layer of humus containing eroded sherds of pottery, including Severn Valley ware, black-burnished ware, South Wales greyware, and Oxford ware. A single coin of Gratian (A.D. 367-385) was recovered from soil disturbed during excavations around the piles at No. 66. This is believed to be the latest Roman coin found in Monmouth.18 (b) Watching-briefs at The Boat House (SO 511 128), New Monnow Bridge (SO 5054 1233), Rockfield Road (SO 496 130), and Rockfield Road/Watery Lane (SO 496 127) produced pottery and other Roman material but no significant features.19 10 Information from Mr E.

Previous excavations have recovered wooden structures, though a geophysical survey suggests that there may be a more substantial feature in an unexplored part of the site N of the evaluation area. The recent excavations revealed further sleeper-beam slots, cut into the natural subsoil or bedrock, while pottery was recovered from across the site. The trial excavations were extended up, down, and across the evaluation area in the hopes of encountering fort ditches but none was found. Scatters of pottery and bloomery iron slag extend away from the evaluation area in all directions.21 NEATH PORT TALBOT (1) Neath (Nidum), Cwrt Herbert playing fields (SS 7461 9781): two trenches designed to test the results of a geophysical survey, which appeared to show both the defences of an earlier fort, slightly W and N of the stone fort, and a road leading to the NW gate, located dumps of clay consistent with rampart construction but no trace of a road; no dating evidence was recovered.22 NEWPORT (1) Caerleon (Isca): (a) Caerleon House Nursing Home (ST 3388 9084): during a field evaluation and watching-briefs in the grounds of this property, which had previously been trenched in 1966 and shown to contain barracks,23 parts of Blocks 3, 4, and 5 were revealed, though the line of the walls did not always match exactly with the projection of the 1966 plan. At least part of Block 5 had been demolished at some stage and a metalled surface laid over the back wall and the alleyway between this block and Block 4. The cessation of activity in Blocks 3 and 4 appeared to have been marked by careful demolition, since there was no overlying rubble; alternatively the superstructure was all in mud-brick or some other form of clay mass walling, since extensive clay deposits were noted overlying parts of Blocks 4 and 5. Traces of opus signinum floors were noted in all areas.24 (b) 1 The Willows, Usk Road (ST 339 909): a watching-brief during groundworks recovered a single cut and moulded stone and iron slag.25 (c) Swyn-yr-Afon, Bulmore Road (ST 347 902): investigation during groundworks located a wall together with a small assemblage of pottery and roof furniture; the wall had previously been encountered in work on the driveway. It had been robbed to its footings which lay beneath the old ground surface and was sealed by hill soil creep.26 (d) The Hollies, Isca Road (ST 3445 9009): an assemblage of Roman pottery and tile was recovered during a watching-brief.27 (e) 4 20 Watching-briefs supervised for Monmouth Archaeology by S.

BURNHAM Tan House Drive (ST 3433 9060): sherds of samian and Caerleon ware box-tile were recovered during a watching-brief.28 (f) 29 Backhall Street (ST 341 907): a watching-brief during the excavation of foundation trenches located areas of closely compacted stones at a depth of c. 0.8 m, together with a relatively flat surface which may have been a wall foundation. Their position and alignment suggest that they may represent the rear wall of a praetorium, for which it has been conjectured the site was reserved.29 The NW corner of a building was also recorded in 1987.30 Residual Roman material was recovered but the foundations could not be definitively dated.31 (2) Lower Machen: (a) Land adjacent to The Old Post (ST 2270 8793): field evaluation revealed a complex series of deposits of clay, silty clay, sandy clay, and gravel, with a generally NE-SW orientation, together with a number of rubble deposits and a cobbled surface, associated with pottery dating to the first and second centuries A.D. A piece of lead was also recovered, though there was no clear evidence for leadworking such as had been noted during works alongside the adjacent A468.32 (b) The Lodge (ST 22654 87956): a watching-brief recovered a quantity of pottery dating to the first and second centuries A.D. from the topsoil and the top of the underlying sandy clay, but no associated features were noted.33 POWYS (1) Caersws: (a) Caersws Workshops (SO 0303 9189): a planning-related evaluation was undertaken near the centre of the village, within 50 m of the S gate of Caersws II fort, close to where excavations in 1985-86 uncovered timber buildings and associated finds which suggested a possible tavern, shops, and metalworking premises.34 Evidence of the later phases of Roman activity was recorded in all four trenches, including a series of soil and stone layers, many of which had been cut by post-holes and similar features. Evidence of various wall-lines was revealed in one trench, while the edge of the outer of the three fort ditches was identified in another. The results confirm the presence of deeply-stratified deposits indicative of intense occupation close to the S gate of the fort.35 (b) Glan y Nant (SO 0327 9214): eight evaluation trenches close to areas already known to have been occupied by the vicus of Caersws II fort36 demonstrated the presence of significant Roman deposits. Few obvious structural features were revealed, though some at least represent either floor levels or yard surfaces associated with a succession of buildings. The associated ceramics suggest that occupation extended into the third century A.D. as elsewhere in the vicus. One significant discovery was a section of road which appears to continue that leading E from the fort. It had previously been assumed that this turned to the N to follow the higher ground now occupied by the Llys Rhufein housing estate, but it now seems likely that two routes existed, one eventually heading N and the other NE 28 Watching-brief supervised for Monmouth Archaeology by S.

(a) At Caerau (SN 932 502) the survey area of 4.5 ha encompassed part of the fort and its annexe. NW of the fort, a 5-6-m wide road with side ditches formed a focus for ribbon development extending at least 150 m from the fort gate. The vicus here is defined by a line of hearths, separated by linear divisions, and there appear to be several phases of overlapping activity. Further anomalies can be seen to the rear of the plots, possibly indicating light industrial activity. Elsewhere in this field two parallel linear anomalies could tentatively be interpreted as ditches beside a road leading N from the fort. No trace of a vicus was detected in a small survey area SW of the fort. (b) At Colwyn Castle (SO 107 540) four areas on different sides of the fort were tested, but no anomalies associated with the Roman or medieval occupation were identified. This may be due to the low magnetic susceptibility of the soil, but as modern agricultural activity did produce anomalies, the absence of earlier activity may be genuine. Conceivably, the fort was occupied for only a short time, and no vicus developed. (c) At Brecon Gaer (SO 002 297), where excavations in 1924-25 recorded evidence of a vicus on the N side of the fort,39 five areas were surveyed, with positive results for the road itself, a series of roadside buildings, a number of features that may indicate industrial activity, perhaps metalworking, and a substantial building, probably stone-built, which may have had a courtyard. The survey thus confirms the presence of ribbon development extending over a distance of at least 200 m. Extramural settlement seems to have been confined to this side of the fort, however, as only the faintest suggestion of a road was detected to the E, while the natural shelves outside the W and S gates were devoid of anomalies.40 RHONDDA CYNON TAFF (1) Caergwanaf, Pont-y-clun (ST 04 80): further geophysical survey and excavation were undertaken on the site of the fort and settlement near Miskin (FIG. 4).41 (i) Resistivity survey concentrated on areas W and N of the 1.6-ha fort identified in 2003, locating a series of large enclosures on its W side (with evidence for occupation inside Enclosure A) but little sign of activity to the N. The settlement now appears to extend over an area of c. 450 m E-W by c. 300 m N-S. Intensive resistivity survey within the ironworking settlement S and E of the site confirmed the position of the fort's S defences. The survey also suggested that the S ditch of Enclosure B followed the line of the fort defences on the S, raising the possibility that the enigmatic enclosure may be a fortlet. (ii) Levelling operations by the farmer provided an opportunity for exploring the suspected line of the fort's W defences. Despite heavy truncation, the inner V-shaped ditch survived up to 3.5 m wide and 1.5 m deep, while the outer ditch was at least 1.5 m wide and 0.6 m deep. Both were interrupted by a gap, c. 3 m wide, which formed the W entrance into the fort. On 37 Evaluation supervised for the Clwyd-Powys Archaeological Trust by I. Grant and R. Hankinson. Mrs J.

This corresponds closely with the shape and dimensions of the N entrance as indicated by earlier geophysical survey. While no trace of a road survived, a linear ditch to the S of the entrance probably represents the bottom of a roadside ditch. A second shallow ditch ran out of the fort on the N side of the entrance, although on a slightly different alignment from its S counterpart. This may have been connected with a possible roadside drain inside the fort, identified by previous geophysical work. A considerable thickness of sediment had filled the fort ditches before they were deliberately backfilled; the associated pottery assemblage indicates that the infilling occurred within the period A.D. 70/75 to 80/85 and points to a short life-span for the fort during the early Flavian military consolidation of South Wales. The backfill of several of the ditches contained slag, revealing that iron smelting began before the abandonment of the fort. (iii) A deposit of laid stones (possibly the remains of a trackway or path), containing quantities of abraded iron-smelting debris and pottery of the second to third centuries A.D., overlay the inner fort ditches. There was little further structural evidence, however, from this period. After this hiatus, occupation recommenced in the W part of the site during the late third or early fourth centuries A.D., comprising a ditch running parallel with the outside of the earlier defences together with an associated gully, a post-hole, and several amorphous hollows eroded in the subsoil. These all yielded a very large quantity of hobnails, ranging from individual examples through to complete soles.42 SWANSEA (1) Gorseinon, Cae Newydd Farm (SS 6093 9700): a watching-brief adjacent to the presumed line of the Roman road between Loughor and Neath, and only 200 m from the practice camps on Garn Goch Common, failed to discover any evidence for Roman activity.43 (2) Loughor (Leucarum): three watching-briefs were carried out in areas adjacent to the fort: (a) in the grounds of the Old Rectory, Glebe Road, where Roman finds have been reported, close to the presumed line of the Roman road E of the fort; (b) in an area where Roman cremations have been recorded SE of the fort (SS 5665 9769); and (c) at Castle Grove (ST 5675 9805) in an area believed to be part of the vicus. Nothing of archaeological significance was noted however.44 VALE OF GLAMORGAN (1) Cowbridge, Bowls Club (SS 9944 7490): a watching-brief during groundworks immediately N of the Bear Field, where evidence of Roman activity was excavated in the 1980s,45 showed that the ground level has been raised by c. 1 m, and consequently it was not possible to determine whether activity continued into this area.46 42 Work by T.

No Roman finds were recovered, but its scale and alignment with the known road line suggest Roman origins. (4) Fendoch (NN 919 283): resistivity survey60 clarified the defensive system of the fort complex (FIG. 7).61 Double ditches with 'parrot-beak' gate terminals surround the fort, apparently reduced to a single ditch where the annexe (c. 81 by 86 m) is attached to the SE side. The annexe has a single ditch and entrance on the E. An adjacent rectilinear enclosure (c.73 by 79 m) to the E, if Roman, suggests changes in the annexe plan. Some 45 m SW of the fort, a high-resistance rectilinear anomaly (c. 16 by 27 m) within a damp area may represent the bath-house; it lies on the line of the likely Roman watercourse.62 A ring-ditch was noted within the annexe.

HUNTER Mumrills fort located possible traces of a fortlet. The Wall, here of clay construction with no stone base, was located on its expected line. Unusually a culvert through it was extended either side, and this may be a roadside drain: part of an entrance through the Wall was located, comprising a metalled surface flanked by a transverse slot, while a post-hole, perhaps from a tower, was found. This suggests the remains are connected to a fortlet; one in the area had been postulated from antiquarian references.78 On the berm lay a staggered series of defensive pits, as recorded elsewhere in this sector;79 here they clearly predated Wall construction slightly, as they were cut by the culvert.

Other trenches revealed the stone foundations of the principia and slots for timber sill-beams. In places more than one phase was evident, but this could not be fully investigated. The small quantities of pottery recovered indicate an Antonine occupation.101 There was evidence that the fort was deliberately slighted on abandonment, with burning recorded in many of the interior trenches.

BURNHAM SOUTH TYNESIDE (1) South Shields fort (Arbeia, NZ 365 679): work continued on the 25-m length of the via praetoria immediately SW of the (now reconstructed) late Roman courtyard-house in the E quadrant of the fort.105 The first via praetoria here was built as part of the fort extension of A.D. 208-211. In its first phase the main part of the street, only 3.2 m wide, was defined by outward- facing crude stone kerbs which left flanking areas 2.4 m wide between the central strip and the building plots to either side of the street. Within these kerbs was a further inner pair, acting perhaps as ribs to strengthen the construction of the road foundation and defining a strip only 1.75 m wide. The street was resurfaced on many occasions in the third century A.D. and no doubt in the great replanning of the fort of the period A.D. 286-318, but any work of that date had been removed by the mid-fourth century alterations described below. The foundation or raft of boulders and pitched stones on the SW side of the street, described last year, was shown to date to the fourth century A.D.: it overlay a drain leading from an apse added to the baths of the courtyard-house during the first half of that century. The suppressed drain was replaced by another which avoided the foundation by running around its NW end, showing that the tepidarium of the baths remained in use throughout these alterations. The foundation is in fact contemporary with the surface of limestone flags covering the street, also previously described. The whole arrangement represents a refurbishment of the street and the entrance to the courtyard-building (now provided with a timber porch), probably in the mid- fourth century A.D. The purpose of the foundation remains unclear, but it seems most likely to 101 The form of the fort, especially the 'parrot-beak' gate terminals, has been seen as Flavian (ibid.); any such early levels were not reached in this work. 102 By Mr D.C.

BURNHAM have formed the interior of a building, defined by a robber-trench to the SW side of the street. In the late fourth century A.D. the apse was demolished and the entire street surface covered with a crude paving of re-used facing-stones, which had been much robbed and disturbed, probably in the early post-Roman period, for tumble from Roman buildings was found to overlie areas where the paving had been removed. The interior of the possible building defined by the foundation was also paved in a style characteristic of the late fourth century A.D. at South Shields.106 (2) South Shields vicus, Coston Drive and Morton Walk (NZ 365 675): further trial trenches were dug in areas around the cemetery partly excavated at Morton Walk in 1993,107 but failed to find any further burials. Two trenches revealed a substantial metalled track running N-S from the direction of the fort towards the known cemetery. This ran parallel to a pair of boundary gullies, one of which is a continuation of a gully found in the known cemetery area in 1993. Pottery found in a midden or dump sealing the track was of predominantly third-century A.D. date.'08 NEWCASTLE UPON TYNE (1) Fossway (NZ 279 652-NZ 274 649): a number of watching-briefs and evaluation trenches were carried out on the S side of the modem Fossway, between Brough Park Stadium and Byker Hill traffic roundabout, during roadworks and service renewal connected with a large retail develop- ment. At four points contact was made with the foundation of Hadrian's Wall or its robber trench, between 0.5 m and 1 m below modem ground level. The remains were consistent with Narrow Wall construction. At no point was the entire width seen, so no dimensions can be given. Trenches crossing the modem highway revealed the Wall ditch beneath the road. It was not established whether any features lay on the berm. Work at Tunstall Avenue revealed the Wall but no definite trace of Milecastle 2, which has been supposed to lie in that vicinity. A mass of disturbed stone, seen c. 60 m E of Tunstall Avenue, probably represents debris from the cottages demolished in the 1920s, rather than the milecastle. These are the first recorded sightings of the Wall curtain along the whole stretch where it is followed by the Fossway. It runs 2-3 m S of the alignment usually adopted on modem OS maps. The newly fixed fragments also confirm that the Wall was probably surveyed in a straight alignment all the way from Wallsend fort to the summit of Byker Hill.109 (2) Union Road (NZ 273 648): the S lip of the Wall ditch and an area of the berm were exposed in evaluation trenches preceding water main renewal. On the berm was an arrangement of pits, interpreted as emplacements for defensive obstacles. They resembled those seen 220 m to the W, at Throckley, and elsewhere.110 The Wall itself no longer survived in the one trench that contacted its line as derived from the ditch and features on the berm. These observations show the Wall continuing the alignment recently established 220 m and 645 m W, that is, several metres S of the line appearing on OS mapping. A slight turn at the summit of Byker Hill will have allowed it to take up the alignment along the Fossway to Wallsend fort, described above. A representation of the Wall laid out in recent times immediately E of the cycle shop in Union Road is in fact some 10 m N of the actual line."11 106 Excavations directed for Tyne and Wear Museums by N.

The width of the Wall could not be determined, but the construction, comprising a flagged foundation, 0.1 m deep directly over natural, and a single course of large sandstone blocks, offset by 0.12 m, with clay bonding and a clay and rubble core, was of Broad Wall type. This is the easternmost sighting of the Broad Wall, bringing it to within 130 m of the Castle Keep. It represents a continuation without change of direction of the alignment recorded in front of the Mining Institute, 110 m W, where the S face of the Broad Wall was found in 1952.112 (4) Lemington Roman Way (NZ 1860 6600): a further watching-brief E of last year's observations113 confirmed that the Wall ditch runs immediately S of its course as marked on the current OS Landline map, i.e. directly under the street named Roman Way rather than in the gardens of the properties on its N side.114 (5) Throckley, Hexham Road (NZ 1544 6685): two trenches recorded the truncated remains of Hadrian's Wall in advance of work on sewerage/drainage. The original ground surface was represented by a palaeosol containing a small quantity of wood charcoal and other charred plant material, the remains perhaps of ground clearance prior to the construction of the Wall. The Wall foundation, up to 2.8 m wide, comprised flat sandstone slabs and sub-angular blocks, bonded with clay. A single course of the S face was recorded in one trench, built of squared sandstone blocks set directly upon the foundation slabs. Little of the rubble core survived. This evidence places Hadrian's Wall to the S of the position shown on OS mapping."15 NORTHUMBERLAND (1) Heddon-on-the-Wall, 23 Military Road (NZ 1322 6701): two trenches, 9 m by 1.6 m and 4.8 m by 1.6 m respectively, on a site S of the Military Road (B6318) and the line of Hadrian's Wall, revealed remains believed to be associated with the latter. They included an E-W linear feature, 0.56 m wide and filled with river cobbles, which is believed to be a Roman drainage feature. It may have been associated with an area of hard-standing, possibly a path, seen in a second trench. A probable pit contained large fragments of worked stone, possibly representing demolition rubble from nearby Roman structures or perhaps bedrock quarried from the Vallum. The features were all covered by a soil layer, 0.38 m thick, which had developed since at least medieval times.116 (2) Corbridge Roman Bridge (NY 9795 6456): continuing erosion of the S bank of the river Tyne led to a full excavation of the road-ramp, first examined in 1995.117 It approached the Roman bridge at a right angle from the SE, continuing the line of Dere Street as it descended the S side of the Tyne valley. (i) The ramp, 11.7 m wide and 17.6 m long, consisted of two walls retaining a rubble core above the original river bank.

Hodgson, Tyne and Wear Museums) lowest course laid directly on the river gravel. The intact part survived to a height of four courses (1.3 m), but the wall had originally consisted of at least eight courses (FIG. 10). The SW wall, similarly constructed, had been laid on level ground above the river bank and only parts of one course survived. Pottery showed that the ramp was not built before the late second century A.D. Many of the blocks in the walls were reused and appear to have come from an earlier ramp which was perhaps destroyed in a flood. (ii) Over 260 blocks were recorded either in what remained of the NE wall or what had collapsed onto the river-bed. They were generally of similar dimensions to those still visible in the E abutment of the bridge at Chesters and displayed the same range of stone-working techniques, although none of the Corbridge blocks had lewis-holes or grooves for lead tie-bars.11" The upper courses nearest to the abutment were joined together with bar- clamps (all removed in antiquity). Architectural fragments included two cornice-blocks with slots in their upper surfaces to hold vertical slabs forming a parapet; they were similar to those at Chesters but had more elaborate mouldings.'ll9 The top of a stone pillar of square section with a cushion-like finial was also recovered; it was probably part of the parapet.

An extraordinary find was the cap-stone of an octagonal column or stele, 1 m wide; the cap-stone was very weathered but preserved a moulding around its base with a series of protuberances at the angles, perhaps originally palmettes; it then tapered up towards a finial in two slightly concave sections. (iii) At an unknown date the river scoured a channel alongside the ramp, undermining the NE wall which had partly collapsed into the channel. Much of the collapsed fabric retained its original coursing, showing that the wall would have been at least 3 m high (including the displaced cornice blocks below the parapet). (iv) Following the excavations the entire structure and areas of collapse were dismantled. The blocks will be re-assembled nearby on a site where they can be protected from destruction by the river.120 (3) Corbridge, Corchester Lane (NY 9836 6498): work to install a new footpath from the W of Corbridge to the English Heritage visitor centre at Corbridge fort entailed the excavation of a trench, 1 m to 1.5 m wide by 0.15 m deep. Excavation only exceeded the depth of ploughsoil at its E and W ends. At the E end was a section of wall, standing up to four courses high, which contained a worked Roman stone. The wall is probably late Roman or medieval in date. A cobbled area found in the trench is probably post-medieval in date.121 (4) Housesteads (NY 790 687): geophysical survey during 2003 identified field-systems to the W of the fort and an area of settlement to the S enclosed by ditches and the Vallum. A possible bath-house was also identified.122 (5) Chesterholm (Vindolanda, NY 768 663): (a) excavation continued in the W part of the site, S of the wells and water tanks (Area B in FIG. 11).123 The early 'fort ditches' proved to represent two different systems, with a later aqueduct channel passing through them. They remain undated, but must be earlier than A.D. 105, when they were filled in to make way for a timber- built fabrica, containing numerous hearths and evidence of ironworking. In the later second century A.D. a series of stone-built structures occupied the site and metalworking continued for some years. In the third century A.D. two successive stone buildings succeeded them, but they were so severely damaged that their function could not be ascertained. The W defences of the Periods IV and V early timber forts have still not been traced. (b) In Area A (FIG. 11) work continued to the S of the 2003 site, between the S Severan rampart and the small cemetery. Further substantial civilian buildings with courtyards were examined, although their remains had been ravaged by post-Roman ploughing. This area, on rising ground c. 100 m from the W wall of the stone fort, appears to have been devoted to more opulent housing. Below the floor of a civilian house, a 15-m section was cut to examine the Severan ditch, which proved to be nearly 5 m wide and 2 m deep; it was used as a dump for more than 200 battered items of footwear and c. 1,500 butchered animal fragments. Cattle bones were in the majority, but pig was more prolific than sheep, goat, deer, and horse. There were scant remains of the early timber periods, which here appeared to have been barracks. The most unusual find was a tightly-squashed bundle of fragments from an ornate silver plaque, lying in a second-century A.D. context, and containing three recognisable figures, two of them deities standing on plinths, accompanied by a third representing a boxer wearing an animal skin and mask (FIG. 12).124 120 Excavation for the Heritage Lottery Fund and English Heritage was directed for Tyne and Wear Museums by P.

The Hadrianic Turf Wall was seen, but its full width could not be ascertained. The Turf Wall simply sat on the pre-existing ground surface and did not possess a cobbled foundation. Overlying its levelled remains was the flagged foundation for the Hadrianic Stone Wall, up to 2.88 m wide. The facing-stones had been completely robbed, but fissures in the footing slabs on both sides allowed the width of the Wall above the footing to be determined at 2.32 m. The core was clay and rubble, with a light adhesion of mortar where the backs of the facing-stones had been. The superstructure had been demolished, perhaps to provide stone for Lanercost Priory.125 (2) Burgh-by-Sands (NY 312 592): geophysical survey during 2003 confirmed the location of Turret 72b and Milecastle 73, together with details of the course of the Wall and Vallum.126 4. NORTHERN COUNTIES By BARRY C. BURNHAM NORTHUMBERLAND (1) Blakehope, Blakehope Farm (NY 8588 9433): a trial trench, 22 m long by 1.5 m wide, was excavated in the S annexe of the fort ahead of a proposal to site an agricultural building there. A series of features was revealed cut into the subsoil, including a foundation slot for a timber structure, a gully, and a short length of a structural slot. Although not linked stratigraphically, their respect for each other suggests they were contemporary. They are interpreted as part of a possible structure with an eavesdrip on the W. Although no dating evidence was found, they pre- date the ridge-and-furrow cultivation and the known context is suggestive of a Roman date.127 (2) High Rochester (NY 831 987): during 2003 magnetometer survey W of the fort confirmed the existence of a complex multi-phase annexe. Structures inside indicate possible buildings. At the SW comer there was a separate enclosure, within which there are traces of a large building which might be a bath-house. N of the annexe there were a number of buildings with small associated fields and access tracks; to the SW may be the slighted remains of temporary camps.128 DURHAM (1) Chester-le-Street, Park View School (NZ 2786 5130): observation of a pipe-trench for a flood-relief scheme, running N-S, 200 m E of the fort, revealed a metalled road with Roman pottery on its surface, crossing the trench at right-angles, on an alignment aimed at the SE angle of the fort. No buildings were seen lining the road, although owing to difficult conditions, the presence of timber buildings should not be ruled out. 55 m to the N, however, was the corner of a 125 Excavation for English Heritage was directed for Tyne and Wear Museums by N.

Roman pottery was scattered on the ground cut by the foundation.129 (2) Darlington, Faverdale East Business Park (NZ 42755 51750): excavation in advance of development investigated an area of nearly 6 ha. Pre-Roman activity was represented by widespread field-systems and several penannular eavesdrip gullies, all associated with a large ceramic assemblage. In the Roman period a sub-rectangular enclosure, measuring c. 90 m E-W by up to c. 65 m N-S, with a wide entrance on its E side, occupied a spur of higher ground. From its ditch came decorated samian and roof-tile, suggesting a building of high status in the vicinity at the time of its infilling. To the N of the S ditch the foundations of a small, stone-built hypocausted block were examined, measuring c. 6.4 m by 3.85 m (FIG. 13). This was evidently a well-appointed building, possibly a bath-house, to judge from the painted wall-plaster, roof- tile and box flue-tile recorded as demolition debris in its interior. It probably post-dated the enclosure, as there was evidence that rakings from its furnace area had been dumped into the partially infilled ditch. There was no trace of any larger dwelling with which it might have been associated, though the area to the N had probably been entirely removed by ploughing. A substantial E-W road overlay the infilled entrance. It was constructed principally from river cobbles and may have been contemporary with the hypocaust building. It extended E for c. 30 m, before disappearing probably through ploughing. Significant amounts of 'high-status' ceramics were recovered, including a relatively large quantity of imported samian, along with a relatively large assemblage of 'small finds', including metalwork and glass.130 (3) Medomsley, Glebe Farm (NZ 1087 5421): a watching-brief on a sewerage main carried across Dere Street just N of Glebe Farm recorded the earth agger of the Roman road, 7.5 m wide, immediately beneath the modem highway, which had removed any trace of stone foundation or metalling. Immediately to the E of the agger lay a shallow roadside ditch, and 3 m beyond that a larger ditch or quarry pit.131 NORTH YORKSHIRE (1) Bilbrough Top, Colton Lane junction (SE 537 458): a watching-brief to the S of the A64, during the construction of a new road and bridge, identified the route of the Roman road from Tadcaster to York. In section, cobbled surfaces over a sand and gravel agger were revealed, as well as a roadside ditch on the S.132 (2) Carkin Moor (NZ 1615 0827): a watching-brief, during the excavation of three launch and reception pits forming part of a scheme of water-main refurbishment, identified no deposits relating to the use of the fort. A pit excavated within a substantial road cutting where the A66 bisects the fort confirmed that in this area archaeological deposits have been totally truncated by the cutting.133 (3) Malton (Derventio), Old Malton Road(SE 794 722): geophysical survey was undertaken on 129 Watching-brief for Northumbrian Water Ltd was supervised for Tyne and Wear Museums by M.

In the N of the surveyed area, a trapezoidal enclosure measuring 70 m long and 50 m wide was identified. To the S, anomalies indicative of a whole range of features were encountered, including ditched boundaries, pits, hearths or areas of burning, and possible buildings. These are thought to relate to the vicus.134 (4) Pickering, Newbridge Quarry (SE 795 857): excavations identified an enclosure complex and a number of cremation burials. An extension to the N saw the continuation of this enclosed landscape with a series of Iron Age and Romano-British enclosures appended to the E side of a trackway. Several phases of occupation were represented by a series of overlapping enclosures containing roundhouses. A significant pottery assemblage was recovered.135 (5) Roman road, Bainbridge-Ingleton, SW extension (Margary 73): fieldwork c. 1 km E of Ravencross at SD 6440 7095 identified a section of Roman road, c. 60 m long, c. 4.5 m wide and c. 0.2 high, immediately E of the SE extension of Black Wood and running parallel with the modem road and adjacent to it. Probing suggests some stone, but also evidence of robbing. An adjacent water-trough rests on a spread of stone, probably former road material, predominantly made up of small boulders 0.1 m to 0.2 m in size. At points S of the modem road between the above site and Ravencross, a series of heavily-wooded enclosures are sited immediately adjacent to the modem road. Within these on the postulated line of the road are sunken linear features, often of appropriate width, which are probably indicative of road material having been robbed out. 136 (6) Roman road, Ribchester-Low Borrow Bridge (Margary 7C): fieldwork S of Ravencross, where two Roman roads cross, identified traces of a road N of Bull Common at SD 6335 7080. The line of the road was cut by a small stream at this point, and evidence of a road of impressive width and construction was seen.137 (7) Wheldrake, Millfield Farm (SE 668 443): a previously unknown Romano-British settlement was discovered during archaeological monitoring of pipeline construction SE of York. Five broad phases of activity were identified, based on stratigraphic analysis of excavated features and assessment of datable finds. The pottery broadly dated to the third to fourth century A.D., with some possibly from the late second century A.D. The general layout of the features suggested a small settlement on higher ground which dominated a largely flat landscape. The earliest phase of activity comprised two inter-cut ring gullies that probably represented two phases of roundhouse. These were superseded in the second phase by a sequence of short linear gullies that may have been part of rectangular timber structures within a ditched enclosure. The settlement during Phase II included at least two enclosures and a small cemetery and possibly a trackway, presumably on the edge of the area of occupation. This area may have been built on during Phase III as the settlement expanded along the trackway. The full extent of the Romano- British phases of settlement is still unknown as only limited excavation within the pipeline corridor was undertaken. The features and artefact concentrations suggest that the main focus of activity was located on the summit of the ridge, immediately SE of the excavation. Evidence that a stone-walled, Roman-style building may have been built in the vicinity of the excavated area took the form of roof-tiles, box flue-tiles, concentrations of stone within a number of features, and a lead wall plug.

Behind the rampart was a large pit or trench which may have been dug for sandy clay used in rampart construction. This was backfilled with deposits containing a considerable amount of ashy material, perhaps deriving from ovens or manufacturing activities. As elsewhere on the circuit, the first-century A.D. rampart was reduced in height before the rampart was reconstructed, to a width of c. 13 m, probably in the late second or early third century A.D. Previous work on the site has indicated that this rampart was contemporary with the stone wall and interval towers on the SW side of the defences. The second rampart survived more or less intact until the tenth century, if not later, before being partially levelled for the construction of the infirmary of St Leonard's Hospital in the twelfth century. Investigation of the NE comer of the Multangular Tower and of its interior, previously examined in 1927,141 revealed a complex sequence. It appears that prior to its construction the late first-century A.D. rampart was largely levelled and then the sloping ground was evened up by deposits containing a good deal of domestic refuse. For the projecting part of the tower timber piles, identified as alder, were driven through these deposits. No piles were identified below the foundations of the rear part of the tower. The foundations themselves were, as previously recorded, of concrete. Subsidence affected the rear of the tower and an attempt to consolidate the foundations with more concrete was recorded. However, it appears that the rear part of the tower had either collapsed or been demolished by the end of the Roman period. Rampart deposits were built up against what remained of the tower which contained large quantities of elaborately painted wall-plaster, possibly from the tower itself. A rectangular timber structure, c. 8 m by 3 m, was constructed in deep trenches dug into the rampart immediately SE of the Multangular Tower, but set back by c. 8 m from the fortress wall; this may have been a tower forming a late addition to the defences.142 (b) 2-4 Driffield Terrace (SE 5932 4510): excavations adjacent to the main approach road from the SW,143 now followed by The Mount, revealed part of a well-known cemetery.144 The earliest feature was a large pit, possibly a well, at least 5 m in diameter and 3 m deep, within an area defined by a ditch parallel to the road. Subsequently, probably in the late second to early third century A.D., the site was devoted to burial. 56 inhumations were identified of which 49 were adult. Of these all were male and none thought to be over c. 45 years of age.

Two inhumations were furnished with pottery vessels, but otherwise grave goods were absent. In addition to the inhumations there were several cremations and several small pits which contained burnt material, but not human bone.145 (c) 4 and 6 Driffield Terrace (SE 592 509): (i) evaluation at No. 6 revealed evidence for Roman burial beneath 0.8 m of garden soils and a buried Roman soil. Four small test pits were excavated, revealing two articulated burials within two of the pits, both of which were recorded and left in situ. Placed at the knees of one of the inhumations was a skull, presumed to have belonged to the same individual (the burial was not fully exposed), decapitated before burial. An iron nail at the left hand of the individual suggests the possibility that a wooden coffin was included in the rite. The second inhumation was found to have the skull placed on the chest. Associated ceramic material suggests a third-century A.D. date; the presence of a sherd of tazza may represent graveside ceremonies.146 (ii) A watching-brief at No. 4 also encountered evidence for Roman burial. Two distinct buried soils were identified, the earliest of which has been identified as Roman. This sealed two inhumation burials: a juvenile, orientated SW-NE, and an adult, orientated NE-SW, of which only the skull was exposed; the burials were preserved in situ.147 (d) Mount School, Dalton Terrace (SE 5850 4190): a watching-brief on a cable trench dug behind the main school buildings revealed what was probably Road 11148 and two additional narrow roads running off it. A pit with some human remains was also recorded.149 (e) Heworth Croft (SE 6102 5261): evaluation revealed evidence for Roman occupation in the form of truncated and shallow pits, which contained ceramic material indicative of occupation prior to the mid-second century A.D. This assemblage comprised domestic pottery, including mortaria, and ceramic building material, including brick, tegulae and imbrices. In addition, however, finds from the site included sherds of vessels traditionally associated with burials (including greyware and Eboracum ware jars and flagons), a fragment of unguentarium, the sooted pedestal of a tazza, and residual calcined human bone. This material suggests that occupation of the site was preceded by a short-lived phase of burial, dating to the late first to second century A.D.150 (f) Laurens (SE 6164 5137): a watching-brief revealed a rectilinear ditch, within which a single inhumation was identified. The ceramic assemblage from the ditch backfill is Roman in date.151 EAST RIDING OF YORKSHIRE (1) Aldbrough, Garton Road (TA 5260 4370): excavations were carried out on the site of a gas storage facility, following geophysical survey. An area of over 2,000 m2 was investigated, revealing evidence of occupation during the late Iron Age and Roman periods. The Iron Age settlement, which was probably occupied in the second and first centuries B.C. and the first century A.D., consisted of a large circular building or roundhouse within a rectangular ditched enclosure. The roundhouse, which was 10 m in diameter, was surrounded by an outer drainage 145 See Britannia 35 (2004), 277. Excavation for York Archaeological Trust was directed by B. Antoni and M.

A single crouched burial was discovered in one comer of the enclosure, with a small handmade pot in the grave alongside the skeleton; though the bones were very badly decayed, it has been identified as probably female, 25 to 35 years of age. The settlement is thought to have been a farmstead. Traces of adjoining enclosures were also discovered, which may have served as fields or animal pens. The later, Roman, settlement was probably also a farmstead, occupied in the second to fourth centuries A.D. Several adjoining enclosures were present alongside a track, some of which contained evidence of rectangular timber buildings, though few walls or foundations were located. The area investigated did not include the entire settlement. The associated pottery included large fragments of coarse handmade Iron Age pots as well as pieces of finer Roman wares, though there were no types which would indicate that this was a wealthy settlement. Well-preserved plant and insect remains were also noted in the fills of some of the ditches.152 (2) Brough (Petuaria): (a) 49 Station Road (SE 9378 2661): the E portion of an evaluation at this site lay immediately outside the SW comer of the walled town, next to the E shore of the Haven, a large area of formerly open water which was an important harbour from the Roman period onwards. The three trenches provided evidence for a series of late third- to fourth-century A.D. deposits and features. These included a stretch of masonry foundation at least 2 m wide, which may have formed part of the town's late third-century A.D. defences, most probably the S wall of a rectangular bastion added to the circuit in the early fourth century A.D. The wall was largely robbed, possibly by the middle of the century. A second curvilinear feature may represent one of several phases of defensive ditch which were observed to the E at 'Grassdale' in 1959. This was infilled some time after A.D. 330-335. A clay and rubble layer representing the latest Roman activity, and possibly the demolition of the main defensive wall, was given a terminus post quem of A.D. 347-348. Further from the walls on the W part of the site, the third- or fourth-century A.D. foreshore was encountered, and there was evidence for post-Roman erosion of the sands forming the shore of the Haven, prior to the deposition of alluvial silts. This is consistent with evidence for a late or post-Roman transgression recorded elsewhere.153 (b) 66 Station Road (SE 9372 2662): evaluation undertaken on this site lay within the former area of the Roman and later harbour basin (the Haven). The natural foreshore was reached by augering, but the overlying alluvial sequence was probably of post-Roman date, with deposition continuing into the nineteenth century. The evidence, though sparse, complemented a more intensive investigation further N at the Magistrates Court site in 2001 and 2002.154 (c) 5 The Burrs (SE 9387 2685): a small evaluation uncovered an interesting sequence in the N part of the Roman town, including a ditch and deposits which may relate to an initial temporary military camp and a late first- to early second-century A.D. fort pre-dating the civilian settlement. These were overlain by a series of levelling layers, floors, and a hearth, dated to the late first/early second to late third/early fourth century A.D., which were probably associated with buildings adjoining a road in the civilian settlement. The later floors were associated with a substantial masonry wall foundation, which had largely been robbed, before being sealed by a layer of 'dark earth' in the early to mid-fourth century A.D.

A trackway ran E-W across the site, consisting of a fragmented gravelly surface flanked by drainage ditches. A less-well-defined track was also evident, running NW-SE and intersecting the E-W track. The ditches produced quantities of Iron Age and Roman pottery. In addition, ring gullies indicative of roundhouses were observed, particularly at the NE limits of the excavation. An inhumation at the junction of two ditches contained a bead necklace and may be of late Iron Age or Roman date. Two crouched inhumations associated with metal grave goods may be Anglo-Saxon in date, but this is still to be confirmed.156 (4) Hayton, Whitehouse Farm (SE 8183 4573): trial excavation and a watching-brief 250 m NE of the fort and W of the Roman road from York to Brough-on-Humber (Margary 2e), in advance of the construction work, produced no trace of Roman activity.157 (5) Hedon, 7 Market Hill (TA 1879 2890): evaluation on a site in the N part of the town, E of what has been considered the original twelfth-century core of the medieval settlement, provided evidence for past activity cutting the natural surface, including a ditch containing a small assemblage of pottery dating to the late second/early third century A.D. and ceramic tile. No other definite features of Roman date are currently known to have been excavated in Hedon.158 (6) Melton, Low Common Lane (SE 964 256): monitoring of a pipeline easement led to the discovery of a previously unknown site. Pre-Roman activity, in the form of a series of gullies and part of a ring ditch, was succeeded by a sequence of three successive double-ditched enclosures, aligned N-S and dating to the later Roman period. The nature of these enclosures was unclear, but the area delineated included a road running roughly N-S towards the highest point in the field (just S of the line of the easement) and a T-shaped 'corn-drying' kiln. The road make-up included a re-used tile stamp of legio VI Victrix dating to the beginning of the third century A.D. The final phase of Roman activity saw a crouched inhumation inserted near the kiln.159 (7) North Cave, Dryham Lane (SE 8800 3270): evaluation on the site of a proposed extension to Dryham Lane Quarry revealed a small number of mainly Romano-British features, including field boundaries, drainage ditches, pits, and a small ring-ditch surrounding a possible hay-rick. These features were laid out to either side of a palaeochannel, previously identified from an aerial photographic survey, which seems to have had some significance in the Roman period, probably acting as a boundary between settlements.

Two crouched inhumations which may be Roman were buried between two of the ditches.161 (9) Stamford Bridge (SE 715 555): during the construction of a new water main a watching- brief and excavations identified three areas of archaeological potential: (i) close to the E bank of the river Derwent, SW of Stamford Bridge, the pipeline easement bisected the projected line of a Roman road (centred on SE 7057 5454). Excavation revealed the remains of the agger with an associated roadside ditch, dated by pottery to the second to third centuries A.D.; (ii) c. 80 m E of the Roman road, the pipeline ran parallel with a well-known series of extensive crop-marks indicative of a Romano-British settlement. A concentration of features, extending over a length of 260 m along the pipeline corridor, was encountered (centred on SE 7082 5450), including a series of enclosure ditches, 'corn-drying' kilns, and 'watering holes', as well as a small number of human inhumations and cremations. Initially two phases of activity were identified, the earlier dating to the first to second centuries A.D. and the later to the late second to early fourth centuries A.D.; (iii) c. 400 m E of this, a further section (centred on SE 7186 5464) was excavated across a Roman road aligned NW-SE.162 LEEDS (1) Al Bramham-Wetherby Upgrading Scheme (SE 4312 4090-SE 4116 4960): extensive trial trenching, following geophysical survey and fieldwalking, has exposed late Iron Age and Romano-British occupation to either side of the A659. Investigations targeted the remains of ditched enclosures and fields identified by geophysical survey and aerial photographic mapping. Evidence for settlement was also encountered, including post-holes, elements of stone revetments, and features containing late Iron Age and late Roman pottery. Disarticulated remains of five human neonates and infants were discovered in association with rubbish deposits of animal bone and pottery.163 (2) Colton, Colton Mill (SE 376 330): trial trenching confirmed the presence of several linear features previously identified by geophysical survey.

Waterlogged conditions had preserved wooden objects and rich environmental remains, with the latter indicating occupation of an area of damp, low-lying alder carr. Animal husbandry and arable production were likely, although known field-systems to the E may represent later Roman additions. Industrial processes have also been tentatively identified, while tree clearance was being undertaken to make more land available for farming or to provide the raw materials for further industrial activity.167 (2) Doncaster: (a) 1O-14A Hallgate (SE 5773 0325): archaeological evaluation revealed rare evidence of pre-Roman or early Roman activity in Doncaster with the identification of a wattle fence and ditch. These were sealed by the first phase of the Lincoln to York Roman road on route N towards the fort. It comprised seven phases of cemented cobbles; late Saxon and medieval pottery associated with the final phase suggests that it continued in use into the medieval period, when the modem route of Hallgate was established, c. 16 m to the S. Numerous sherds of Roman pottery were recovered, including an almost complete vessel, which contained a second, smaller and thinner-walled pot. Such pots, dated to the second half of the second century/early third century A.D., have been associated with cremation rituals.168 (b) Askews' Print Shop (SE 5840 0050): post-excavation assessment of the paper, artefact, and ecofact records from the 1994 excavations confirmed that the early Roman features, which included beam-slots, stake- holes and pits, fell within the boundary of the fort established in the area in A.D. 71, while later Roman features included a substantial limestone wall and boundary ditch, probably related to the rebuilding of the fort in the third century A.D. Occupation of the fort continued until c. A.D. 350, after which date it was gradually abandoned.169 (3) Norton, Barnsdale Bar Quarry (SE 5110 1390): continuing excavations in advance of the expansion of quarry working170 revealed several boundaries, defined by ditches or discontinuous ditches and pits, and a sub-square enclosure, within a late prehistoric/Romano-British landscape of settlement enclosures, trackways, and field-systems. Two fragments of pottery date the boundaries to the early fourth century A.D. Few discrete features were identified within the excavation area, the majority of them being prehistoric with charcoal-rich fills, some flint artefacts, and cremations.171 (4) Rossington Bridge, Parrot's Corner (SE 630 993): evaluation for a proposed Park and Ride scheme, S of Doncaster and immediately E and NE of the 'vexillation fortress',172 confirmed the existence of a pre-Roman field-system but recovered no trace of any extramural civil activity.

A ditch E of the fortress, aligned E-W, produced pottery of the second/early third century A.D., as did a pit containing other burnt material.173 (5) Scawthorpe, York Road (SE 5470 0640): evaluation for a proposed Park and Ride scheme, N of Doncaster and S of Adwick-le-Street, confirmed the results of a geophysical survey. Ditches bordering a trackway, aligned N-S (with an E-W branch near its N end), were trenched, but could not be dated beyond noting that they pre-dated the Romano-British activity and may represent a route replaced by the nearby Roman road. Romano-British settlement was demonstrated within two enclosures, on the highest ground at the S end of the site. The enclosures produced evidence of domestic activity, including coins, loom weights, and nails, as well as hints at cereal processing. Two kilns of uncertain function were examined in the former W ditch of the trackway, close to the W enclosure, whilst iron-smithing slag was found in the E enclosure. The trackway may have continued in use into the Roman period.174 ROTHERHAM (1) Canklow Woods (SK 4310 9050): an EDM survey produced scaled, hachured plans and written summaries of a small field-system, banked enclosures, banks, and cultivation terraces, which survive as upstanding monuments and are thought to be Iron Age/Roman in date. The field-system lay on the lower W slopes of the wood. The banked enclosures and terraces on the E plateau of the wood were also surveyed and a more comprehensive plan produced than in previous studies."75 MANCHESTER (1) Manchester (Mamucium): (a) Deansgate (SJ 38345 39766): excavation in advance of development located two areas of archaeological survival, one in the SW corner of the site (Area A), the other on its NW side (Area B), both associated with the vicus of the fort which lay c. 120 m to the SW. The earliest activity comprised a group of substantial pits, probably dug to provide material for nearby road construction. Pottery from the earliest backfills dates to the period c. A.D. 80-120, indicating an early Flavian foundation. The site seems to have been incorporated into the vicus in an organised and planned manner some time during the early second century A.D. Boundary ditches divided Area A into separate plots and tree clearance may have taken place in the S plot, prior to the construction of a timber-framed structure. Numerous other features originated as fence lines and small storage structures. To the N, a small group of pits may have been excavated for refuse disposal. The structure was later abandoned and demolition and occupation debris was dumped across the area, further backfilling the earlier quarry pit. A developed soil was recorded in the N part of Area A, overlying the refuse pits, which suggests a period of abandonment c. A.D. 120-160. Subsequent activity saw the construction of a small building of clay and timber in Area A, with evidence of rebuilding in the form of a later clay floor surface. The SW comer of a clay and timber building was also recorded in Area B, together with a section of internal clay wall, a clay floor, and associated beam-slots. This structure appeared to have burnt down prior to being rebuilt. Its final phase had been subject to horizontal truncation 173 Excavation for Arup on behalf of South Yorkshire Passenger Transport Executive was directed for Northern Archaeological Associates by Dr M.C.

BURNHAM and survived only as a small area of clay floor with associated beam-slot and stake-holes. Two groups of substantial pits were recorded in the N portion of Area A and the E portion of Area B; these were presumably for the disposal of refuse from the buildings. All these structures were built on the same NNE-SSW alignment, part of a grid-like layout within the vicus. They are likely to have been roadside shops fronting onto a road or street. The final phase comprised a single substantial pit in Area A, from which pottery of c. A.D. 200-250 was recovered. Thereafter a developed soil accumulated, sealing parts of the latest buildings in Areas A and B. The absence of any ceramic material of the later third or fourth century A.D. indicates that the vicus may have contracted and suggests that the area was abandoned completely, rather than being utilised for agricultural purposes in the late and sub-Roman period. The site produced an unusually large quantity of samian, including an extraordinarily high proportion of decorated ware and an important group of South Gaulish vessels of the second century from Montans. The assemblage also contained a large quantity of Spanish Dressel 20 amphorae, representing 60 per cent of the coarse wares.176 (b) Barton Street (SJ 833 977): excavation in the vicus, in advance of redevelopment, revealed four main periods, encompassing at least ten phases of activity (FIG. 14). The Period 1 (late first to early second century A.D.) remains included a large ditch, which probably formed part of a military annexe linked to the Period 1 fort. In Period 2 (early to mid-second century A.D.) a number of successive timber buildings were built across the site, which functioned as both domestic structures and possible workshops. A series of pits also dated to this phase, and some may have been connected to industrial processes occurring within the vicus. During Period 3 (mid- to late second century A.D.) a two-phase building was constructed in the N half of the site, which in its later phase was built in both timber and stone. The latter was also associated with a number of unusual small finds and an urned cremation burial. In Period 4 (third century A.D.), although there was some evidence for sporadic activity, the area appears to have been largely abandoned.177 STOCKPORT (1) Mellor, Old Vicarage (SJ 9826 8893):178 a second trench across the ditch of an Iron Age enclosure has produced further evidence of Roman activity in the vicinity. From the upper fills of the ditch came 221 fragments of pottery, deriving from multiple vessels with a date range spanning the first to fourth centuries A.D. This suggests a rubbish deposit which had accumulated elsewhere, before being cleared into the ditch. The vessel types indicate a high-status site, as the jar:bowl ratio compares with urban and villa sites rather than rural ones. This conclusion is supported by the range of traded wares. Five bronze brooches, an assortment of nails, and 40 fragments of briquetage were also recovered. Despite such evidence for a substantial and prolonged presence, the exact location and nature of the associated settlement remain uncertain, given the paucity of identifiable Roman features so far recorded amongst the Iron Age ditches and roundhouses.179 176 Excavation for CgMs Consulting on behalf of The Beetham Organization was supervised for Pre-Construct Archaeology Ltd by H.

Two phases of stone-built amphitheatre were recognised and the existence of an early timber phase disproved (FIG. 15). Amphitheatre 1: the first element to be built was the outer stone wall (Thompson's 'concentric wall'). A foundation attached to the outer face seems to have been an external stairway from which the higher seats were reached. Against the wall's inner face, redeposited natural had been dumped, probably from the excavation of the turf and soil from the arena. It is probable that the arena 180 See F.H.

(Plan drawn by C. Quinn and supplied by A. Wilmott, English Heritage) wall was now constructed. The dumped material was tidied up and a terrace created, into which beam slots were cut (Thompson's 'grillage'). A complex timber structure of beams and uprights was constructed to take timber seating within the stone shell. The bottom of this structure was weighted into place with red sand derived from the excavation of the lower levels of the arena. Outside the amphitheatre, deposits accumulated against the outer wall, predominantly consisting of layers of yellow sand, imported to the site from nearby. These layers were interleaved by 'occupation' deposits associated with short-lived timber-built structures. It is possible that the clean yellow sand was used in the arena, and removed to this area when soiled. Amphitheatre 2: the only feature of Amphitheatre 1 to be retained in the second phase was the arena wall. The outer wall was demolished and its lower courses incorporated as support into the new cavea. A new outer wall was constructed, 2 m outside, and concentric with, the outer wall of Amphitheatre 1. It was constructed on deep (1.6 m), broad (2.7 m) foundations, using sandstone masonry of better quality than the first building. The upper seats were reached by means of vomitoria, two of which lay between each pair of main entrances. One, and part of a second, lay within the excavation area. These entrances were flanked by buttresses, while single buttresses were situated between each pair of entrances. The side walls of the vomitoria were as deeply founded as the outer wall and of one build with it. A marking-out line for the bottom step was found on a threshold block in line with the outer face of the outer wall, showing that no internal ambulatory existed. No evidence for the nature of the seating has yet been found. Outside the amphitheatre was a build up of cobble and gravel road surfaces. At a late period these were cut by a trench 421</page><page sequence="40">ROMAN BRITAIN IN 2004 along the outer face of the amphitheatre wall which was packed with clean clay. Subsequently at least two of the entrances were walled up. The pattern of stone robbing showed two phases. The first removed internal walls, including the vomitoria side walls, but leaving the outer wall intact. This suggests a continuity of use of the enclosure. The second phase robbed the outer wall from outside the building, suggesting disuse and quarrying.'8" (2) Church Minshull: 58 silver denarii to A.D. 176, found during metal detecting, along with two silver gilded trumpet brooches.s82 (3) Heronbridge (SJ 4105 6350): a third season of work concluded investigation of the quay on the N side of the inlet (FIG. 16).183 An arrangement of at least six rock-cut mooring-post pits along the edge of the quay was confirmed.

BURNHAM while adhering to the carefully finished upper surface is a short length of lead 'solder' used to affix whatever object completed the sculpture. The rock face of the quay was cut back in the Roman period, partly removing the mooring-post pits, and it is now thought this was done at the time of the building of the funerary monument to give it a more imposing appearance. The area fronting the E side of Watling Street, investigated in 1930/31,184 was partially re- examined for the purpose of establishing a date for the inhumations thought at the time to be late Roman. Further burials were encountered. These had been laid in a mass grave, estimated to contain at least 100 bodies; paleo-pathological analysis proved them to be battle casualties. Radiocarbon dating (SUERC 3769 &amp; 3770) indicates a date in the late sixth/early seventh century and so they are thought to be associated with the Battle of Chester fought c. A.D. 616. Evidence suggests that the oval defensive earthwork which overlies the E half of the settlement belongs to the same period. Examination showed that the builders of the masonry revetment at the front of its rampart ransacked not only the ruined Roman buildings but also the neighbouring cemeteries in their search for suitable blocks of stone.

Although the pottery indicates that activity continued into the third and fourth centuries, later pottery types appear to occur in much smaller quantities, suggesting a shift in the focus of any settlement activity, and it is possible that by this time the land may have been given over to another use, possibly grazing. The earliest phase of activity appears to be represented by a ring-gully with nearby post- holes that may be associated. To the north a series of occupation layers was located, including a disturbed cobble surface overlying a series of gully terminals; one of the latter was found to contain a substantial amount of near-complete pottery vessels, including a samian dish, stamped ROPPUS.FE and dated A.D. 100-140. In the south-western corner of the site there were three roughly north-south aligned graves. No bone survived, but one grave was lined with medium- sized cobbles and the other two contained coffin nails. The graves were cut by a network of intercutting ditches, some of which related to a sub-rectangular enclosure of first/second-century A.D. date.

The trackway comprised a gravel surface containing Roman pottery and tile set in a hollow c. 4 m wide. Further unstratified Roman pottery was also recorded.207 HEREFORDSHIRE (1) Lyonshall: (a) Cold Furrow (SO 344 563): geophysical survey and extensive excavation of a cropmark enclosure revealed an enclosed rural settlement of late Iron Age and early Roman date. A rectangular ditched enclosure, 120 m by 70 m, was later reduced to about half its original size when two new ditches were cut across the interior of the settlement during the late first/early second centuries A.D. Also at this time, a second ditch was added to the earlier boundary around the northern half of the site producing the double ditches identified on the aerial photographs. During the later second century A.D., a shallow ditch was dug in the north-eastern comer of the reduced settlement enclosing a roughly 20 m square area. It was within this inner enclosure that considerable evidence for occupation, including part of a rectangular post-built timber building, a hearth associated with metal-working, numerous pits and a domestic oven, was identified and recorded. The settlement at Cold Furrow was most probably a low-status farm which was abandoned during the early years of the third century A.D. (b) Moorcourt Farm (SO 345 556): geophysical survey and excavation of the cropmark examined a late Iron Age and early Roman single-ditched enclosure, measuring 70 m by 45 m, some 600 m south of Cold Furrow (see above). An internal ditch seems to have reduced the site to about two-thirds its original size at some point during the late first/early second centuries A.D.; the settlement appears to have been abandoned in the third century. No evidence for buildings was found and the site may have been a stock enclosure, perhaps associated with the site at Cold Furrow. (c) Chesters (SO 350 553): geophysical survey of the fields known as Big Chesters and Long Chesters, to the west of Upper Moorcourt, produced no evidence for Roman-period occupation that might explain these unusual field-names.208 WARWICKSHIRE (1) Alcester: (a) former Abbey Works, Bleachfield Street (SP 0883 5712): observation of test pits on a site in the southern suburb of the Roman town, in the area of the putative early fort, recorded further evidence of activity from the first to the third centuries A.D., including gravel surfaces and occupation deposits.209 (b) Grammar School, Birmingham Road (SP 086 578): observation confirmed the more easterly line of Roman (and medieval) Ryknild Street, revealed by evaluation in 2003, for a further 135 m to the south; the fill of a possible roadside ditch contained twelfth/thirteenth-century pottery. Topsoil-stripping to the east produced only a late third-century A.D. coin and a single flue tile fragment.210 (c) St Faith 's Primary School, St Faith 's Road (SP 0908 5734): evaluation of a site outside the Roman town, north of the River Arrow, revealed a Romano-British field boundary ditch, but no evidence of occupation.211 207 Observation by B.

Metal-detecting find.212 (3) Long Lawford, west of Caldecott Arms, Chapel Street (SP 4716 7595): further excavation, following evaluation in 2003, on a site in the medieval settlement revealed more ditches containing Romano-British pottery; these may have been field boundaries or possibly settlement enclosures.213 (4) Mancetter, Old Farm Road (SP 3177 9662): evaluation on the north-west comer of the Roman fortress revealed a series of two military-type ditches dating to the first century A.D., preserved beneath the floor slabs of twentieth-century houses. An oven-type feature outside the outer of the two ditches represents the first evidence of Roman activity outside the western edge of the fortress.214 BEDFORDSHIRE (1) Cople: 2 gold solidi of Honorius (A.D. 393-423) and 5 silver siliquae of Theodosius (A.D. 379-395)(1), Arcadius (A.D. 383-408)(3), and Honorius (A.D. 393-423)(1), deposited c. A.D. 402. Metal-detecting find.215 (2) Harrold, former Bridgman Joinery Works (SP 9512 5698): excavation located a ditched enclosure system over 1 ha in extent that appeared to originate in the Late Iron Age. A number of structures associated with agricultural processing were discovered, including a drying oven and a stone-lined threshing area or storage bin. The only Roman activity was 120 m to the north and comprised parallel ditches, perhaps belonging to a trackway.216 (3) Kempston, Box End (TL 0134 4821): the discovery of human remains during gravel extraction led to a salvage investigation. The quarry was located to the north of the extensive Romano-British settlement centred on Kempston Church End and an associated cemetery.217 Features were badly truncated and some had already been destroyed, but a rectangular ditched enclosure system and trackway probably represent a continuation of the system identified in the settlement. Over 40 large pits, a well, and a possible kiln were located in the southernmost enclosure. In the later Roman period the enclosure was used as a cemetery containing over 38 graves. The majority of the graves had been badly truncated and only eight contained reasonably complete skeletons. The majority of the graves were orientated east-west. A small number of graves were oriented north-south and north-east-south-west; these appeared to be on the periphery of the cemetery. At least ten graves produced evidence for coffins, but only one grave contained possible grave goods: a knife and a coin provisionally dated to the third quarter of the fourth century A.D. Nineteen post-holes, some of which formed two- or three-post structures, were identified within the cemetery area.218 (4) Shefford, Shefford Lower School (TL 1375 3875): excavation was undertaken in an area of known Roman settlement.219 The continuation of the western boundary ditch of the enclosure 212 Information from R.

Evidence for a second, less substantial, post-built building was identified within the interior of the enclosure. A second ditch was located c. 23 m to the west of the settlement enclosure, with the area between the ditches being devoid of features and perhaps representing a routeway. To the west was an area of quarry pits, one of which contained an articulated dog burial. Finds included large quantities of pottery and ceramic building material, including tegula, brick, and flue-tile, along with smaller quantities of mortar, painted plaster, and stone roof-tile that are presumed to derive from the aisled building located in 2002.220 BUCKINGHAMSHIRE (1) Denham, The Lea (TQ 0490 8600): excavation of a further area of 0.5 ha221 revealed eight graves, two of which contained fragmentary skeletal remains, and seven bustum burials. The unburnt upper portion of an Oxfordshire Whiteware trefoil-rimmed flagon dating to the mid- third to fourth centuries A.D. was recovered from one of the busta.222 HERTFORDSHIRE (1) Hemel Hempstead, 'The Spinney', London Road, Boxmoor (TL 503702 205876): excavation following evaluation223 showed that what had been thought to be an east-west ditch had localised areas of metalling and was a Roman hollow-way/sunken lane that may be associated with Boxmoor Roman villa, which lies just to the south-east of the site. The hollow- way turned northwards in the direction of London Road, which is thought to follow the line of one of the main Roman roads.224 (2) St Albans, Kingsbury Dairy, Branch Road (TL 138 075): evaluation identified a Roman building, a well, and a pit. The building was only partly exposed but the presence of tesserae suggests that it originally had mosaic floors and may have been of relatively high status. Pottery recovered from the wall foundation trench and a small pier suggested that the building was built in the second century A.D. but pottery from a cobbled floor surface dated to the later third/fourth century indicating that it remained in use for some time.225 OXFORDSHIRE (1) South Oxfordshire: ten coins and a copper-alloy brooch.226 CAMBRIDGESHIRE (1) Babraham, Roman Road (TL 5055 5362): investigation along a green lane defining the borders of Babraham and Fulbourn parishes (on the line of a Roman road known as Worsted Street) confirmed the presence of deposits associated with road construction, although these are undated.227 (2) Bartlow, Bartlow Park (TL 5871 4507): inhumation and urned cremation burials, some accompanied by samian dishes, and also a possible barrow mound were uncovered, presumably 220 Work by M.

The ditch roughly corresponds with the current road alignment and may have formed a roadside ditch for the Roman road to Godmanchester.231 (6) Huntingdon, land west ofErmine Street (TL 2225 7350): evaluation identified a rectangular stock enclosure containing a large waterhole and early Roman ditched field-systems.232 (7) Linton, Linton Village College (TL 5555 4699): investigations at this site revealed a notable concentration of Iron Age pits, many of which produced evidence of metalworking, and associated structures, along with a Late Iron Age-Roman ditched and metalled trackway. This was succeeded by a network of Roman ditches and small enclosures that may form part of a rectilinear field- system, possibly associated with a large villa to the south of the modem village.233 (8) St Neots: 23 AE coins (17 sestertii and 6 lower denominations) deposited A.D. 161, found during excavation by Cambridgeshire County Council Archaeological Field Unit in 2003.234 (9) Sutton, land north of the brook (TL 4427 7916): a large sub-rectangular watering-hole was uncovered, the fill of which contained Middle Iron Age and Roman pottery, animal bone, and wattle-impressed daub. A small ditch to the south may represent an overflow channel, while a nearby post-hole may have been part of a water-extraction device. Palaeo-environmental evidence suggests crop-processing in the vicinity.235 (10) Swaffham Bulbeck, Downing Court (TL 5551 6256): Roman pits had been cut into earlier field boundaries. The presence of building materials such as tegulae and box-flue tiles along with metalwork suggests that there may be a villa in the vicinity.236 (11) Wooditton, School Road (TL 6746 5987): two drainage ditches that may have been associated with the Icknield Way were found.237 228 Work by C.

FITZPATRICK 1972 Chequers Lane excavation, in which a fourth-century shrine was found,267 suggested that during the first and second centuries A.D. the site formed part of an area of strip fields, seemingly outside the limits of the town. It was only during the third century A.D. that development started, with the digging of a boundary ditch and rubbish pits and the laying of metalling. The pottery from this phase contained a relatively large quantity of oxidised Hadham ware, not normally found in Essex until later in the Roman period. It is possible that the boundary ditch marks the rear of a plot fronting onto Stane Street, and that the Romano-British town gradually expanded as ribbon development, though evidence of the morphology of the settlement is still scanty.268 (4) Hadleigh, Hadleigh Castle (TQ 8100 8602): excavation within the medieval castle uncovered a short stretch of gully possibly of Roman date.269 7. GREATER LONDON By A.P. FITZPATRICK CITY OF LONDON (1) 6 Broad Street Place (TQ 33000 81650): excavation continued from 2003 and results of the previous phase of excavation have been updated and revised in the light of more complete excavation.270 The site lies on an island in the Walbrook; the braided channels that ran across the site were infilled in the first century A.D. and the streams replaced by ditches or channels. The site may have been used as a cemetery in the first century A.D.: a single burial cut through an infilled ditch, and a large amount of disarticulated and semi-articulated human remains was found in a 'ponded' area at the east of the site. A road was laid across the site, running in an east-west line along the southern limit of the site, with a roughly-formed roadside ditch to the north; this road had been previously observed at sites to the west. The road was probably constructed about A.D. 120, at a time when much of the Upper Walbrook Valley infrastructure was updated or constructed. A wide channel was dug along the northern edge of the site. The channel would have drained a wide area, and was infilled with flood deposits, interspersed with sandy beach or foreshore deposits. Human remains were found interspersed with the deposits. A number of horse bones were also recovered - a species that has been found associated with cemeteries elsewhere. Geo-archaeological sampling and recording was carried out on the waterlain deposits. A series of burials were dug to the south of the 'Eldon Street channel'; many of these were dug through former flood deposits, and several were being eroded into the channel. The burials appear to date from the second century A.D., although there are few dateable artefacts, indeed few grave goods. The centre of the site had been truncated in antiquity, possibly removing further burials. However, in the centre of the site a group of three burials in coffins did survive, associated with a gully or drain. The complete corpse of a ram had been disposed of in the gully. A total of 22 burials has been identified; however, the burial conditions were such that the analysis of the scattered remains may identify more burials. In the late second or early third 267 N.P.

The drainage channels silted up and a marsh formed across the area that remained into the post-medieval period. This marsh may have been an effect of the construction of the Roman city wall, which culverted the Walbrook lower down its valley.271 (2) Cannon Place EC4 (TQ 32620 80850): the site lies within the Roman Governor's Palace Scheduled Monument.272 Five evaluation pits were excavated on the site for both archaeological and geotechnical evaluation; these showed that the site lies on the valley side/river terrace within a Pleistocene palaeochannel draining into the Thames, as opposed to lying within the Walbrook or Thames valley floor/floodplain. Of particular significance were substantial remnants of Roman masonry discovered in each of the five pits, provisionally dated from the mid-first to mid-second centuries A.D. Whilst it remains unclear whether all the Roman remains relate to the 'Governor's Palace', it seems particularly likely that structural features found towards the east limit of the site are associated with buildings interpreted by Marsden as the 'Great Hall' and 'Great Pool'. All Roman masonry and a medieval chalk foundation have been preserved in situ.273 (3) 120 Cheapside EC2 (TQ 32329 81240): six test pits were excavated and three geotechnical boreholes were monitored on the site; Roman occupation and demolition layers that were sealed by later Roman dumping were observed in three of the pits.274 (4) 16-18 Finsbury Circus, 18-31 Eldon Street EC2 (TQ 32949 81664): evaluation revealed natural stream channels that may be tributaries to the River Walbrook. In Trench 3 in the south of the site, a channel that had partially silted up was then backfilled in the Roman period with clay and gravel deposits, probably for the purposes of land reclamation. Although no burials were found, a single disarticulated human bone was recovered from the backfill of one of these channels. Trench 2 also revealed large Roman deposits of clay and gravel, which may be part of a general raising of the ground level for the purposes of land reclamation. Trench 5 contained two channels; the sharp edges of the second of these suggest that it had been canalized; it truncates the earlier natural channel. Both channels showed evidence of silting up and were then sealed with a heavily compacted gravel layer, laid down as a consolidated surface.275 (5) 311-318 High Holborn WC2 (TQ 31002 81590): trial pits excavated by contractors revealed a feature, probably a gravel pit, containing Dressel 20 and Alice Holt Farnham Ware dated to A.D. 50-160.276 (6) London Wall/Moorgate EC2, drainage drop-shaft connections (TQ 32663 81580): a watching-brief on two new drop-shafts connecting drains from Moor House to the sewer main below London Wall revealed early to mid-second-century A.D. deposits at the bottom of the sequence.

Natural brickearth was overlaid by a number of Roman roads with stretches of roadside ditch. Dark earth was sealed by further external surfaces, which may have been medieval street surfaces.279 BARKING AND DAGENHAM (1) Pipers Pub site, Gale Street, Dagenham RM9 (TQ 47674 84300): evaluation revealed a layer of agricultural/horticultural soil that contained a single sherd of Roman pottery.280 HACKNEY (1) 142 Lea Bridge Road, Clapton E5 (TQ 35562 86508): a watching-brief and evaluation close to the River Lea revealed a gravel deposit, possibly representing a Roman road.281 HOUNSLOW (1) Hotel development, Syon Park, Brentford TW8 (TQ 1712 7696): evaluation revealed a large channel that probably formed part of the Thames during the late Pleistocene and that would have left an island of terrace gravel (where Syon House now stands) within the river. It was filled with alluvium and colluvium. Some of these deposits contained Roman finds, including pottery and a coin of Valentinian I or Valens of A.D. 364-378, suggesting that at least part of the channel was rapidly silting up at this time. Gravel surfaces and dumps containing pottery and possibly debris from a fire-damaged building(s) provided evidence for occupation associated with the Roman settlement in Brentford near to London Road (close to the projected line of the London-Silchester Roman road). Three first- to second-century A.D. drainage ditches or gullies were found between the roadside settlement and the channel.282 MERTON (1) 1-11 High Street, Colliers Wood SW19 (TQ 2703 7073): evaluation of a site to the east of Stane Street revealed a first- to second-century A.D. ditch aligned north-east to south-west that ran parallel to the road. Layers of gravel and silt may represent the truncated surface of the Roman road.283 SOUTHWARK (1) 13 7 Great Suffolk Street SE] (TQ 3223 7967): evaluation and a watching-brief found a later fourth-century A.D. ditch; Roman pottery, which probably derived from ploughed-out features, was found in the ploughsoil interface with the overlying post-medieval layer. There was no evidence of any settlement and it is likely that the ditch formed a field boundary or drainage ditch. The watching-brief recorded several more ditches, interpreted as being field boundaries of probable Roman date. No datable finds were recovered from these ditches.284 278 Work by J.

Three ditches ran parallel to the presumed course of Watling Street.286 (4) 201-203 Old Kent Road SE1 (TQ 3335 7862): evaluation found a pit or ditch containing large fragments of amphora, black-burnished jars and tablewares.287 (5) The Final Furlong, 162 Grange Road SE] (TQ 3361 7913): evaluation revealed a ditch containing third- to fourth-century A.D. pottery and first- to second-century tile.288 8. SOUTH-WESTERN COUNTIES By A.P. FITZPATRICK GLOUCESTERSHIRE (1) Bourton-on-the-Water, Millstone, Lansdown (SP 162 209): a watching-brief revealed a late Roman building, with at least two possible phases of construction, and a further phase once the building had been abandoned. This last phase saw the building of three walls on a different orientation to the original building. The small assemblage of finds is typical of a house in a small Roman town.289 (2) Cirencester (Corinium Dobunnorum): (a) Coach House Mews (SP 0259 0175): evaluation of a site which lies centrally within the Forum piazza revealed Pennant sandstone paving and related make-up/bedding deposits, directly overlaid by heavily reworked dark earth deposits which yielded post-medieval material.290 (b) 77 Victoria Road (SP 0287 0157): evaluation found a wall and an opus signinum floor with quarter-round moulding beneath demolition rubble.291 (c) Old Tetbury Road (SP 0174 0164): excavation revealed three early Roman cremation burials, two of which may have lain within a defined plot. The foundations of a substantial wall of probable Roman date were also uncovered.292 (3) Gloucester (Glevum), former Kwik Save, Worcester Street/Northgate Street (SO 8343 1881): evaluation revealed metalled surfaces, cultivation activity, and bank material sealed beneath dark earth.293 (4) Lydney (SO 6450 0260): evaluation of 50 ha on the eastern side of the town revealed 285 Work by R.

This enclosure had continued to be a visible feature through the early Roman period and formed the basis for a series of smaller ditched enclosures on the same alignment. From the third century A.D. the ditches were backfilled to allow the construction of a series of dry-stone- founded buildings at the south-east and west sides of the excavation. One of these had been incorrectly interpreted as the remains of the road from Gloucester to Sea Mills in the earlier evaluation. These structures continued in use until the late fourth century A.D. The road was not located in the excavation.299 SOMERSET (1) Hemington, Blacklands (ST 766 541): excavations and geophysical survey continued on the site of a late prehistoric-Romano-British settlement (FIG. 17). Excavation took place to the south of the villa and in the gatehouse area. The dating evidence from the enclosure ditches suggests that the enclosure was in use at the beginning of the Romano-British period and probably had three main phases. The earliest, probably later Iron Age, enclosure was small and square, with an entrance at the west. The enclosure was then extended east, possibly to accommodate the main building, and then to the south. Dating from the ditches and the gateway buildings suggests that the building was constructed much earlier than previously thought, possibly as early as the late first century, but no later than the early second century A.D. This is one of the earliest Romanised buildings in this area of Somerset, perhaps suggesting a proto- villa that never reached the potential exhibited by other villas in the area.

These were cut by a V-shaped ditch on a similar alignment to a system of drainage ditches seen previously at St George's.301 Pottery indicates activity in the second or third century A.D. Later ditches incorporating an increased proportion of domestic waste suggest that a settlement was established in the vicinity of the site by the third or fourth century A.D. These features were sealed by thick deposits of post-Roman alluvium.302 (b) Rose Cottages, St George's (ST 3724 6273): evaluation found two sections of a possible prehistoric or Roman ditch. Environmental samples contained waterlogged seeds, wood, fruit stones, mollusca, fish, and insects indicating that the ditch contained still or slow-moving freshwater, and that the surrounding land was under marsh with areas of disturbed ground and woodland. The abundant fruit stones from the final fill of the ditch may be indicative of occupation nearby. The ditch was sealed by an alluvium that formed a stable floodplain upon which a burnt clay feature was founded which may be associated with Iron Age and Roman salt-workings found to the north-west.303 9. SOUTHERN COUNTIES By A.P. FITZPATRICK WILTSHIRE (1) Boscombe Down, Phase II housing (SU 165 404 centred): two more late Roman cemeteries were examined.304 One was focused around a sub-rectangular enclosure which contained twelve graves with two outlying burials (FIG. 18). Many of the burials were in coffins and were also accompanied by footwear. A high proportion had New Forest beakers and/or coins placed in them; one burial had a jewelry box. The enclosure was sited immediately adjacent to a Bronze Age Wessex linear ditch that was only partly infilled in the Roman period; thirteen inhumation graves and two cremation burials were found cut into the ditch. Many of these inhumation graves had been reopened to inter further burials and disarticulated bones were also found. Coffins, footwear, and coins were found less frequently in these graves than in the burials within the enclosure, and there were no pots. A second cemetery also focused around an enclosure, only part of which lay within the excavation area. Four unaccompanied and uncoffined inhumation burials cut into the fill of the enclosure ditch and there were a further seven burials outside it, some of which were in coffins. Subsequently a series of unurned cremation burials and cremation-related deposits were placed in the upper fill of the ditch. Many of these burials were accompanied by 300 Excavation directed by J.

The latter was shown to have walls surviving to over 1.5 m, with a complex structural history including multiple replasterings and blockings of openings - the latter possibly representing doorways, windows, or niches. Waterlogged deposits in the bottom of the cellar incorporated wooden floor-joists that may be suitable for dendrochronological dating. The cold range of the bath-suite consisted of three rooms, two of which, including the apsidal cold plunge, had their floors raised during the life of the building. The modification of the north-western room of the cold range was started with the insertion of a hypocaust, although these changes were not completed. The main hot range was shown to have been remodelled with the location of the praefurnium being moved from east to south and the creation of a large apsidal room which obscured the original plan. Due to the complexity of the deposits encountered, the primary lay- FIG. 19. Groundwell Ridge, Blunsdon St Andrew: bathhouse. (Photo: courtesy of English Heritage) 305 Work by C. Gibson and A.

Further rooms were shown to exist to the north and east of the area excavated. The second- to fourth-centuries A.D. dating of the main period of use of the building appears to have been confirmed. However, walls were left in situ and therefore absolute dating for their construction was not obtained and isolated features indicate possible first-century A.D. occupation on the site. Cumulatively the evidence from the site indicates that it is a villa, rather than a rural religious complex as has been suggested previously. In either the late Roman or post-Roman periods a substantial post-built timber building was constructed over the abandoned bath-suite.307 (3) Idmiston: 72 copper-alloy radiates to A.D. 274.

This work was located to the east and south-east of the winged corridor villa (Masonry Building 2) investigated during 2001-2002, and followed up the results of preliminary investigations in this area in 2002 and 2003.320 Immediately to the east of the winged building, work continued on the excavation of several large pits. To the south-east of the pits, work also resumed on the excavation of Masonry Building 3. This masonry structure, which had first been partially exposed in 2002 and 2003, was now fully uncovered and confirmed as a large aisled building, measuring c. 40 m long and c. 17 m wide, with three rooms at its northern end. At least two of these end rooms revealed traces of tessellated flooring. The south wall of Building 3 had very substantial foundations, perhaps designed to bear the weight of a masonry gable end. Mid-way along the inside of the west wall was a rectangular area of demolition. This feature is at right angles to the wall, an orientation apparently also maintained at this location, but this time immediately outside the building, by several additional walls that continued beyond the excavation area. The area of demolition and the walls adjacent to the west wall of the aisled building will be fully investigated in 2005. The provisional identification in 2003 of a fifth roundhouse - to the north of Masonry Building 3 - has, after further investigation, now been rejected. Continued excavations to the north-east of the aisled building revealed further evidence for later Saxon activity. Discoveries included numerous small pits, some gullies, post-holes, animal bone, iron slag, sherds of unabraded pottery, and fragments of a bun-shaped loomweight.321 KENT (1) Bredgar: Bredgar Church of England Primary School (TQ 880 602): excavation revealed Late Iron Age and early Roman ditches and a number of pits and post-holes. A later masonry building, excavated at the south-east of the site, probably extended beneath the school buildings. Associated finds of flue-tile and tesserae suggest a building of some prosperity which continued in use until the mid-second century A.D. The concentration of Roman finds on this small site is particularly interesting in the light of their close proximity to the find spot of a hoard of Conquest period gold coins,322 just 500 m to the west.323 318 Work by Surrey County Archaeological Unit, for Henry Street (Sand and Ballast) Ltd; Surrey Archaeological Society Bulletin 382 (2005) sent by Professor S.S.

A second trench found a substantial flint wall with its southern face 4.1 m south of the rear of the town wall; this is probably Roman and may be the rear of an internal wall tower.324 (b) Broad Street (TR 1518 5810): a watching-brief on the insertion of a passageway from 'Jervis House' to the cathedral precinct revealed a short stretch of the face of the Roman town wall, standing about a metre high and consisting overwhelmingly of large, water-rounded flints.325 (c) St Mildred's Tannery (TR 1571 5741): during the on-going development and conversion of the site for residential accommodation, a watching-brief revealed a Roman clay floor in Stour Street, probably part of a short corridor, bounded by beam pads or slots on all four sides. Augering has identified probably Roman clay floors over much of the site.326 (d) Market Way (TR 1501 5885): excavation in advance of housing development uncovered a large concentration of Roman features, the earliest being a series of interconnected ditches adjoining a previously excavated enclosure ditch.327 Together, these features (which appeared to continue in use from the Late Iron Age into the early third century A.D.) provide the best evidence so far for a field-system close to the town. An inhumation burial, cut into the terminal of one of the ditches, was accompanied by an inscribed funerary plaque laid face-down over the top of the skull.328 A number of intercutting quarry pits, all backfilled with quantities of waste tile and brick, were undoubtedly connected with an adjacent tile-kiln.329 Pottery dated their infilling to the mid-first to early third century A.D., which equates with the levelling of the abandoned kilns.330 (3) Ford, Ford Lane (TR 2017 6610, centred): two ditches, partially excavated in the extreme eastern comer of the site in a Strip and Map programme, yielded a significant quantity of pottery. One of the ditches undoubtedly formed part of a rectangular enclosure, although the full extent of both ditches was masked by deposits of colluvium.331 A watching-brief over an associated pipeline identified another field ditch (at TR 19916 66416) containing late first- and early second-century A.D. pottery.332 A series of ditches is also visible on aerial photographs of the field immediately to the west of those in the reservoir area: all run on the same north-north-east by south-south-west alignment.

The existence of two, successive rectangular structures here was confirmed. The earliest, Building 6A, was found to be of three phases, the later two connected with a bath-suite, as suspected previously. Subsequently, Building 6A was demolished and extensively robbed to make way for Building 6B. This consisted of a large, rectangular, single-roomed structure. The entire complex has been provisionally dated to the second and third centuries A.D. Further to the north, within the walled villa compound, the remains of a post-built timber barn were discovered. Located at its eastern end was a large elaborate double-flued 'com-drier' or malting kiln. Burnt daub associated with the outer post- holes suggested that the building had been destroyed by fire. Dating evidence was fairly limited but six fourth-century A.D. coins from the upper filling of the pit containing the corn-drier imply that the building belongs to the late Roman period and therefore must post-date the occupation of the main villa complex.338 (7) Saltwood, Harp Wood (TR 1468 3543): inspection of the site of a probable villa, discovered in 1864 at the south-east comer of Harp Wood,339 showed that the covering woodland had been cut down some years ago and the site now lies in an open field of permanent pasture, adjacent to a public footpath. The stub of a 0.5 m-wide wall of mortared greensand blocks was observed protruding from the bank on the southern side of the footpath. A light scatter of Roman building material was also noted in the area.340 (8) Sittingbourne, Kemsley Fields, Ridham Avenue (TQ 9100 6065): excavation found mainly prehistoric features, with scattered pits of Roman date.341 (9) Strood, London Road (TQ 7325 6935): an undated east-west aligned burial was recorded in a watching-brief.

Finds Reported under the Portable Antiquities Scheme By SALLY WORRELL INTRODUCTION The Portable Antiquities Scheme (PAS) was established in 19971 as an initiative to record archaeological objects found by members of the general public. Funding from the Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF) enabled the extension of the PAS to cover the whole of England and Wales during 2003. 2004 therefore represents the first full year in which the PAS has been in operation throughout England and Wales. The PAS is funded until 31 March 2006 by the HLF and local partners. In December 2004 the DCMS Spending Review announced that the government would fund the PAS for three years from April 2006. The first survey of Roman period PAS data was published in Britannia 35 (2004). This report adopts the same layout, with a brief overview of finds distribution followed by descriptions of significant individual artefacts and assemblages. OVERVIEW 39,199 artefacts were recorded on the PAS database in 2004, 16,579 (42.3 per cent) of which date to the Roman period. This figure includes those finds which have been attributed a date overlapping the late Iron Age and early Roman period. The total compares with 9,915 Roman finds (45.8 per cent of all finds) reported in 2003, an increase of 67 per cent. 2004 data include 5,778 pottery sherds and 411 tile fragments. Otherwise the artefacts recorded are predominantly metallic, although small quantities of artefacts made in glass (49), bone (74), shale (4), and jet (4) were also documented. Many of the finds recorded by the PAS come from sites which have been damaged or eroded, usually by agriculture, and the artefactual evidence may be the only surviving trace of past activity at a particular location. Of the Roman artefacts reported during 2004, approximately 60 per cent were discovered by metal-detector users. However, more unusual recovery circumstances must also be noted. At Piercebridge, Durham, divers recovered 234 artefacts, while at Canvey Island, Essex, 146 Roman objects were collected through beach-combing the inter-tidal zone over a period of 30 years, but were only recorded in 2004. Table 1 shows the numbers and distribution of Roman non-ceramic artefacts reported by county (grouped by PAS region) during 2004. These figures are based on the PAS database, except for Norfolk where they do not represent the total number of artefacts recorded.2 The artefacts that qualify as treasure under the terms of the Treasure Act 1996 are excluded from this survey, but are published in the Treasure Annual Report by the DCMS. For convenience of presentation and to enable comparison with other datasets, the subdivision of artefacts by function is based on the scheme introduced by Crummy,3 with some modifications. Coins (72.8 1 Pilot projects were established in Kent, Norfolk, the West Midlands, North Lincolnshire, Yorkshire, and the North-West in September 1997, followed by projects in Hampshire, Somerset and Dorset, Northamptonshire, Suffolk, and Wales in January 1999. During 2003 the PAS expanded to cover the remaining English counties. 2 Owing to the very high number of artefacts presented for identification in Norfolk, only a proportion is currently available on the PAS database. Records of other artefacts are entered into the Norfolk Historic Environment Record. 3 N.

Coins per cent) are the most numerous find: the percentage recorded in 2004 is very consistent with that in 2003 (72.7 per cent). Brooches constitute 14.3 per cent, other items of personal adornment represent 3.8 per cent, and the category combining household utensils, furniture fittings, copper- alloy vessels, keys, weights and textile equipment represents 3.1 per cent of artefacts reported. All other categories are represented by very small numbers. As with the data recorded in 2003, there are significant regional differences in the quantity of finds recorded. FIG. 1 shows the distribution of findspots of non-ceramic finds. Although the distribution is densest in counties where the PAS has been established for some time, it can now be seen that there is a much wider and more even distribution of findspots across South, Central and North-East England. There are substantial numbers of findspots from Essex, Hertfordshire, Wiltshire, Leicestershire, Surrey, and Buckinghamshire. A rise in the absolute quantity of artefacts recorded is also particularly noticeable in Leicestershire, Buckinghamshire, Hertfordshire, Bedfordshire, Essex, Gloucestershire, and Durham. In those counties the number of recorded finds has increased between 2.5 to 23 times in comparison to 2003. However, this increase has not yet been documented in all counties where large quantities of finds might be expected. In Cambridgeshire, Berkshire, and Oxfordshire, for instance, the numbers of recorded Roman period finds are low. In other areas, such as the Weald and Downs in Sussex and Kent, the Fens, and the Pennines, the lacunae are entirely consistent with previous knowledge of land use and settlement. In some counties where a large number of finds has been recorded during 2004, the number of actual findspots is comparatively small, owing to very large quantities of artefacts being recorded from a single site or sites in the same parish. This phenomenon is illustrated at Nether Wallop, Hants., Canvey Island, Essex, Hayton, East Yorks., and Piercebridge, Durham. This is due in large part to the recording in 2004 of large assemblages collected over a number of years. As well as differences in quantity there are also regional differences in types of artefact 449</page><page sequence="68">ROMAN BRITAIN IN 2004 FIG. 1. Distribution of findspots of Roman non-ceramic artefacts recorded in 2004. 450</page><page sequence="69">SALLY WORRELL recorded. In the 24 counties which have recorded more than 100 objects, the proportion of the total represented by coins was calculated. The average percentage of the total for these counties is 73.1%, although regional variations within this group range from 12.4% in Durham to 99.7% in East Yorkshire. A similar analysis of the brooch data, as the second most numerous artefact class, was undertaken. Brooches account for 14.3 per cent of the total non-ceramic artefacts recorded and represent 79.1 per cent of the total of the combined brooches and other personal adornment categories. A comparison between the brooches and other forms of personal adornment in the three counties with the highest numbers of brooches - Suffolk, Essex and Wiltshire - reveals interesting disparities. In Suffolk and Wiltshire brooches comprise 77 and 88 per cent respectively of the combined brooch and personal adornment total, whereas in Essex they comprise only 54 per cent. In addition, the quantity of artefacts of personal adornment excluding brooches in Essex accounts for a very considerable 27 per cent of all non-brooch personal adornments recorded by the Scheme in 2004. High numbers of objects of personal adornment excluding brooches, as well as items of military equipment and studs/mounts, also occur in Durham. The patterns apparent in Essex and Durham are largely owing to the recording of very large and somewhat atypical assemblages from the single sites already discussed (Canvey Island and Piercebridge). The PAS records represent a very substantial and dynamic resource for the study of differences in the use, circulation, and deposition of material culture in Roman Britain. Nevertheless, users must take account of the processes by which the data have accumulated. For example, in any given year for any given county, the data may be skewed by the documentation of a single and perhaps atypical collection (see above). Too much importance should not be attributed to annual statistics; patterns need to be established on the basis of records compiled as the Scheme develops. The entries below set out some of the highlights of the past year's discoveries recorded by the Finds Liaison Officers.4 Fuller details of the finds recorded by the Portable Antiquities Scheme can be obtained from the Scheme's central office5 and there are full descriptions of finds on the PAS website: www.finds.org.uk.

The figure is heavily eroded and much of the original surface and detail is now missing. The reclining banqueter rests on his left elbow with the right arm resting along the body; the right hand is now missing. The figure appears to be naked above the waist whilst the lower part of the body and legs are covered with drapery, the folds of which are indicated by cast and recessed lines on the front and rear. The left hand is visible against the base of the drape. The rear of the figure may have further drapery over the left shoulder. No details of the face survive. The figurine is closely paralleled by an example excavated from a pre-Flavian context at Usk.9 Similar figurines have been found in Colchester,1o Richborough,11 and recently at Bembridge, Isle of Wight, recorded by the PAS (IOW-2F7DD1) (see below, No. 24). 2. ENGLAND DURHAM (2) Piercebridge (NCL-920745) (FIG. 2).12 A copper-alloy object in the form of a right leg and foot depicted wearing a sandal and sock. It is 40 mm high and 11 mm wide. The sandal is represented by ribbed mouldings running down the centre of the foot, encircling the ankle and extending to the flat sole. The sock is toed to take the sandal toe-strap. Its textile structure is depicted as a series of incisions in a herringbone pattern; such a sock would have been made by single-needle netting.13 The incisions continue up the leg and end in a notched circumferential rib which appears to represent the top of the sock. Above this rib the leg expands slightly, ending mid-calf. The leg is hollow and the calf is divided in two longitudinally by a vertical slot, which originally accommodated the remains of what was probably an iron blade, now missing but noted by the finders upon discovery. Iron corrosion and a white substance, possibly lead solder, are visible within the slot. Two plano-convex-sectioned, ribbed copper-alloy plates were also found close to the foot and may have originally extended from the calf area of the object. These plates are each 16 mm long and 12 mm wide. FIG. 2. Piercebrioge, Knife-handle (No. Z). Scale 1:1. (Drawn by and C M. Hoyle) 9 J. Webster, 'Figural bronzes', in W. Manning, J. Price and P.V.

Other objects of similar form are known from sites in the North of England. A similar leg has been identified as a candlestick or box support from Piercebridge.14 A similar object from Corbridge, Northumberland, has been recorded by the PAS (NCL-33E168). Another right foot wearing a sandal or light boot and with a socketed upper section was excavated at Alcester, Warks., and has been interpreted as an item of furniture or a small stand.15 CHESHIRE (3) Church Minshull (2004 T311) (FIG. 3).16 Four fragments from two silver gilded Trumpet brooches, both of which are decorated with La Thne 'Celtic' ornament, were found with a hoard of 58 Antoninian denarii, the latest being of Faustina II (A.D. 161-176).17 (a) The larger and heavier brooch is represented by three conjoined fragments comprising the head, centre FIG. 3.

The head has a design of raised trumpet-shaped peltas, the arch of the bow has a large elaborate boss in the form of opposed column terminals and this motif is repeated on the terminal of the foot. The original brooch was elaborately decorated, with large areas of the raised ornament highlighted with gilding. This brooch is very similar in size and decoration to the complete gilded silver Trumpet brooch found at Carmarthen.18 (b) Only the head of the smaller second brooch survives. It is decorated with curving raised peltas and tendrils and the 'voids' of the design are picked out with gilding. The fragments suggest that these two brooches were deliberately cut up and broken. The decoration of a small number of copper-alloy Trumpet brooches is clearly inspired by La Tbne Celtic Iron Age styles. These brooches are often relatively large and are related to other rare brooches with similar La Thne inspired ornament. The date of Roman objects decorated with La Thne Iron Age inspired designs is very uncertain since few come from closely-dated archaeological contexts. This find is important as the association with the coin hoard provides a further piece of dated evidence, suggesting that the application of this style may have persisted beyond the immediate post-Conquest period. LINCOLNSHIRE (4) Near Ludford (LIN-E8F806).19 Two fragments of a late Roman lead tank found in close association. Both fragments are flat, roughly rectangular and join at the rim and again towards the lower body. The decorated fragment is 395 mm high and 260 mm wide and the undecorated fragment is 348 mm high and 283 mm wide. Both fragments are about 10 mm thick. The fragments have a slightly expanded rim decorated with a moulded single-cable band with incised chevrons. One of the fragments has a moulded vertical double-cable band. These designs are not uncommon and are seen on most of the other examples.20 That the tank represented by these fragments was deliberately destroyed is indicated by the level of damage on the fragments; the upper edges of the rim on both fragments show a series of linear marks made by a chisel, indicating that the initial strikes to split the tank were directed from above. There are also a number of further clean, linear chop marks along the inside edges of the fragments. The complete chisel marks show a consistent blade width of 61 mm. The jagged tears and a warped chisel mark at the base of one of the fragments suggest that the sides were bent back and forth until they fractured at the base. The Ludford tank represents the fourth example found in Lincolnshire and the sixteenth from Britain. The two fragments of the tank found at Walesby, Lincs., perhaps show a similar process of destruction before deposition. The repeated chevron design on the rim and the vertical double- cable motif on the face of the Ludford fragments are also seen on the Walesby tank, although unlike the latter tank, there is no sign of Christian iconography on the Ludford example. The fragments were discovered in a stratified context and a 4 m by 3 m trench was excavated over the findspot. This revealed a shallow oval pit into which the fragments neatly fitted, indicating that it was originally dug specifically for their concealment. No other Roman artefacts have been found close to the findspot. (5) Torksey (NLM-C7BD85) (FIG. 4).21 An incomplete copper-alloy Roman rider figurine.

Torksey, rider figurine (No. 5). Scale 1:1. (Drawn by K. Leahy; C K. Leahy and North Lincolnshire Museum) and both hands and feet are now missing. Both arms are raised and bent at the elbow, the right slightly higher than the left, and this stance suggests that items were originally held in each hand. The posture suggests that the figure was originally attached to a horse. His left leg is pushed slightly forward of the right leg. His hair is curly and there is a trace of a probable crested helmet. Although his face is very worn, the outlines of the eyes, the nose, and a groove for the mouth are still visible. He wears a short-sleeved tunic which ends mid-thigh and is tied at the waist, perhaps with a wide belt, and also a short cape. What is possibly an armlet is visible on his right arm above the elbow. His outfit is similar to that of the rider figurine from Brigstock, Northants.22 Another rider figurine also found near Torksey is slightly smaller than this example and the detail is less clear.23 The PAS has also recorded a rider figurine found 3 miles north of Torksey at Marton, Lincs. (LIN-D53ED6). (6) Harmston (DENO-9632F6) (FIG. 5).24 A copper-alloy figurine of a bound captive of Jackson's Type 11.25 The male figure is crouching or seated, and is tightly bound around the neck, wrists, and under the knees. The rope is realistically represented, with a twist between the wrists and knees, although the detail is hidden by soil concretions at the neck and below the knees. The captive has no hair, the triangular nose is wide and flat, the eyes are large with a central dot, and the mouth is indicated by a short incised line. The hands are grooved to represent the short fingers and thumb and there is a broad vertical groove between the hands. The ribs are represented by six incised lines on the front and back, and two shallow grooves down the back of the figure emphasise the prominent backbone. The figure has no ankles and feet. There is a circular opening between the arms and knees behind the rope. The vertical perforation through the figure's torso that 22 K.S.

The figurine is 40.4 mm high and 24.1 mm wide, with a maximum thickness of 12.7 mm. Other figurines of Jackson's Type II include examples from Brough-under-Stainmore, Cumbria, and Thonock, Lincs.26 The latter was also recorded by the PAS (NLM 2845). The ten bound captive figurines now known from Britain possibly date to the second to third centuries A.D. LEICESTERSHIRE (7) Near Hinckley (FIG. 6).27 An assemblage consisting of nineteen Horse-and-Rider brooches was found scattered over a small area. All the brooches are incomplete and the pin survives on only two examples. Most are in a poor condition, although the enamel survives relatively well on eight examples. They belong, like the majority of known Horse-and-Rider brooches, to Ferris' Type 1.28 This type is characterised by minimal detail on the crude outline shape. None of the riders have feet below the horse's belly, which is a general characteristic of this type. Eight examples are fragments only, four are incomplete with a large part of both the horse and rider present, while the rider on eight brooches is intact, although the horses are incomplete. Only two brooches have nicks to indicate the mane. Of the eight surviving riders, three have an eye depicted by a punched dot which is both disproportionately large and poorly placed on two examples. One rider has a nose and chin crudely depicted, the others are without surviving facial features. There is considerable variation in the shape and colour of the enamel cells.

On the other four brooches, there are one to three spots of enamel on the horse's chest. A similar feature occurs on an example from Lamyatt Beacon, Somerset, which has been interpreted as possibly representing a piebald.30 On four brooches the cells are filled with red and blue enamel in various combinations. Four brooches have only red enamel, while four others contain only blue enamel. Single examples have red and green enamel and turquoise. The most unusual colour combinations are brooches with yellow and red and yellow and green enamel respectively. It is not possible to identify the colour of the enamel in two brooches. Two brooches are particularly crude in their rendering of both horse and rider. On one example, the rider of the schematically portrayed horse is little more than a rounded knob and only the horse has cells which are filled with red enamel. On another example there is little space for the rider's body owing to the disproportionate size of the head (FIG. 6b). Horse-and-Rider brooches appear to be characteristic of religious sites and can be interpreted as ex-voto or souvenir objects. 47 brooches recorded from 27 sites were included in Ferris' study. Of these, 13 are from known temple sites or areas showing ritual activity. Prior to the discovery of this group, assemblages were represented by eight brooches from Hockwold cum Wilton, Norfolk,31 and five brooches from Lamyatt Beacon, Somerset.32 (8) Near Loughborough (DENO-AC7275) (FIG. 7).33 A complete copper-alloy leaf-shaped seal-box with a knobbed terminal and an anthropomorphic head cast in high relief.

It is 33.8 mm long and 15.2 mm at its widest point. The engraved ornament consists of a large peacock and what is likely to represent the tree-of-life. The peacock stands in profile to the left and pecks the tree which has a cross-hatched trunk and four branches, three of which terminate in three fruits. The peacock has a 'crown' of three crest feathers and its neck, body, and tail are decorated with zig-zag, cross-hatched, or oblique lines. On the tail feathers these lines lie either side of circular stamped motifs which represent the eye feathers. The body is also decorated with two circlet motifs. The legs are long and terminate in three toes. Below the tail and above the back is a line of crescentic punch marks. A border along the outer edge of the strap-end and extending to the crest consists of crescentic motifs along a guide line. FIG. 9. Hardwick, strap-end (No. 10). Scale 1:1. (Drawn by D.

The figure is depicted leaning slightly to the right. He wears a draped, full-length, v-necked garment. The drapery extends down the upper part of the arms, although the lower parts are now missing. Traces of solder within the arm sockets indicate that the arms were cast separately. The right arm is raised slightly, presumably originally with the right hand raised to the chin in Harpocrates' characteristic gesture. The hairstyle is elaborate, with a frontal peak and curls to the shoulders. He wears a simple headdress with a backward- facing crest at the front. The eyes contain traces of solder and may originally have held glass or enamel settings. No trace of the nose remains and the facial features are only faintly depicted. The figurine has been broken from a base and the lower legs and feet are now missing. Although more commonly depicted naked, draped figurines of Harpocrates occasionally occur in Britain and are usually assumed to be Eastern imports.

The right arm is set at a right angle to the body and both hands are lowered; in his right hand he holds a possible club which is divided into three panels and decorated with circular and crescentic stamps on both sides; in his left hand he holds what appears to be a snake.44 The naked body is robust, although the musculature is only partially and crudely defined. The features on the round face are well-defined: a wedge nose, almond-shaped eyes, and full cheeks. The 'capped hair' is defined by oblique incised lines at the fringe which extend for a short distance onto the back of the head, while the neatly-trimmed beard extends from the hair-line to beneath the chin. Hercules stands on a rectangular plinth which is 16.5 mm long by 8 mm wide. The front and sides of the plinth, decorated with vertical incisions, are divided in two by a groove. The base of the plinth has a copper-alloy protrusion, which is 12.2 mm long and 3.2 mm wide. It is covered in iron corrosion, presumably from the missing blade. The Hunsdon Hercules was found close to an unusual copper-alloy stud (BH-84F731) (FIG. 12) which had probably been attached to a box or casket. It is 26.6 mm high and 19.5 mm wide.

The spindle holds a fully round zoomorphic mount on either side: one in the form of the head and neck of a bird with ring-and-dot eyes and engraved cross-hatched feathers on its lower neck; the other a cow's or bull's head with recessed eyes drilled at the centres. Such drilled blind holes were sometimes intended to secure enamel inlay. A vertical slot through the bird's neck aligned with a slit or recess in the adjacent arm would have held a wedge that when pushed downwards would have pressed the terminals tightly together, thus fixing the arms at any required angle. The arms are identically decorated with champlevd enamel and moulded facets. Where it survives, the badly decayed enamel is now pale green. The decoration consists of a pair of quatrefoils with drilled holes at the centres, and below these a line of five triangular cells. Where the enamel is entirely missing, the drilled central holes can be seen. The lower parts of the arms, below a wide transverse moulded groove, have three longitudinal facets. File marks cover all the visible parts of the flat inner faces of both arms. The dividers are 171 mm in length and have a maximum width of 40 mm. Although the dividers are early Roman in date, the use of the traditional Iron Age motif of a bovid head together with a bird's head in combination with enamelling suggests that it was made in the late first or second century A.D. Roman dividers are not common artefacts and they are normally undecorated utilitarian objects in iron and/or copper alloy. The Shouldham dividers are an elaborate example of a simple form of dividers. A far less elaborate pair from Caister-on-Sea, Norfolk, was considered to have been used by a surveyor rather than a craftsman.52 SUFFOLK (16) Eye (SF-A3CIA5) (FIG. 15).53 A complete copper-alloy spindle in the shape of a bovine head from a pair of Roman dividers.

At the top of the shaft, which terminates 7 mm above the slot, the casting expands abruptly, forming the neck of the bull, which has two deep grooves on the back. The shaft projects from the centre of the wide neck. The head is roughly triangular in shape with a tapering snout and a pair of horns, which stand out from the object and curl inward to form points. The mouth is slightly open and teeth can be seen. There are also transverse grooves across the top of the snout and at its tip roughly semi-circular grooves with central circular incisions represent the nostrils. The expanded rear of the head is 10 mm wide and 5 mm thick in front of the horn roots and behind the eyes.

Although engraved gems and other works of art show Priapus, the figurine from Ingham is only the second figurine of Priapus from Britain. Together with the Pakenham Priapus,55 the Ingham figurine may suggest a local rural cult venerating Priapus. In appearance the two figurines are rather different; the Ingham Priapus is depicted as a mature, bearded man with enlarged testicles, whereas that from Pakenham is represented by a youthful, beardless, ithyphallic man who is naked but for the head-dress. The Pakenham Priapus is noted for its elegant modelling and, at 84 mm high, is slightly larger than the Ingham Priapus whose modelling is very much coarser.

It is one of over 260 Roman objects collected from the inter-tidal zone at Canvey Island over a period of 30 years. The animal head is realistically portrayed, with the flattened brow running into a pointed snout with a defined nose bridge. The pointed ears are laid flat against the side of the head, maintaining this flattened profile. The lenticular eyes have dots for the pupils and the cheeks are moulded with a realistic bulge. The nose is moulded with a deep septum running down the flat front of the snout and the end is moulded with a bulging muzzle. The mouth is shown slightly open, and its tongue shows between the jaws.

The human head has a horizontal line forming the hair-line, deep circular dots for the eyes, and a short horizontal groove for the mouth. The nose may have been raised, but has now worn away. The anthropomorphic decoration on the bow is unusual, not least since its placing suggests that this brooch was worn with the spring at the bottom. A fragment of a T-shaped 'sawfish'-type brooch found at Neath, Glamorgan, has a similar head on its upper bow, although the head is the opposite way up to the Grittleton example.60 Another T-shaped 'sawfish'-type brooch with a cast head in the same orientation as the Neath example was found at Nor'nour, Isles of Scilly.61 HAMPSHIRE (20) Owslebury (HAMP-3E0708) (FIG. 18).62 A figurine of an eagle standing upright on a flat sub-triangular base.

The upper terminal of the lower section of each table leg ends in an outer calyx into which this piece would have slotted, the calyx thus being formed of two parts. The curving upper section of each leg would have entered from behind the figure leaving it standing proud at the angle of each leg. The outer part of the calyx is integral with the table leg and the inner with the emerging satyr. The Pompeii parallel suggests a Vespasianic date. The fitting is without parallel in Roman Britain.

The brooches, which are incomplete, are constructed from separately-made components. The wings and hook were attached to the head and bow by means of an integral rivet at the back of the head, which was then hammered over on the interior of the wings. At the base of the rear of the head on one example there is a small lug or rivet. The wings arch back from the bow and possibly formed a Polden Hill-type spring arrangement, although the wings only survive on one example and the ends have been lost. The bows are generally slight and undecorated. The upper bow is sub-rectangular in section, the lower bow tapers to a simple foot, and the catchplate is solid. These brooches have a similar method of construction to a brooch from Wroxeter, which has a projection on to which the missing wings would have been attached and in addition has a boss riveted through the upper bow.70 DORSET (27) Puddletown (SOMDOR-86B238) (FIG. 24).71 A copper-alloy human head in a very schematic style. It is 25.5 mm high, 21.6 mm wide, and 21.7 mm deep. The face is oval with a shallow, sloping forehead and high cheek bones. There is no brow ridge and the almond-shaped eyes are deeply recessed and hollow. The triangular nose is broad and has little definition in profile. A short, slightly down-turned groove represents the mouth, the chin is rounded, and the ears are cast as C-shaped ridges. The top of the head is flattened into a sub-circular plane, the back of the head is rounded and no hair is depicted. The head is broken off at the neck and there is iron corrosion within the socket. The function of this object remains elusive, although the iron suggests that it may have been a decorative element from a functional object. An equally schematic anthropomorphic fitting in the form of a bust is known from St Austell, Cornwall.72 FIG. 24. Puddletown, terminal (No. 27). Scale 1:1.

Tombstone of oolitic limestone depicting a funerary banquet scene, found5 in 2004 c. 10 m from the next item (No. 3). It consists of three major conjoining pieces, one smaller (inscribed) piece, and some minor fragments. When complete it measured 0.59 by at least 1.03 m, and up to 0.14 m thick, but the base and top (which may have been gabled) are missing, so the original height may have been 1.30 m or more. It depicts a figure reclining on a couch with his face to the front. He wears a toga which is draped over his head, but his short hairstyle is quite clear. In his left hand he holds a scroll.6 At the foot of the couch, to the viewer's left, is a smaller, standing figure whose body is badly damaged, but whose head and feet are relatively clear.7 In front of the couch is a tripod table with the round top in plan view. The two 'side' legs are widely splayed, while the third is squat and rounded. On the table are two vessels of flaring shape with handles projecting horizontally from the rim, shown front-on and probably intended to represent glass or metal (perhaps silver) canthari. Below is the inscription, which is not set in a recessed panel, nor apparently defined by any moulding or border: M[.]RTIALIS I C[..]LONI A SERV[..] I [...]O A XIIII I [...] E, M[a]rtialis SC[. .]loni serv[us] I [ann]o(rum) XIII I [h(ic) s(itus)] e(st). 'Martialis, the slave of [...]lonius, aged 14, lies here.'8 3 The body was placed in an extended position on its back, the arms folded across the chest. It wore hob- nailed shoes or sandals. In contrast to the rest of the skeleton, the skull and upper post-cranial bones were well preserved, as Mr Sparey Green points out, because of the decay products of calcium carbonate from the marble. He further suggests that the plaque originally accompanied an earlier burial (with which the new one was deliberately associated), and that when the former was disturbed, the plaque was carefully replaced in its position as found, in the new grave. 4 Lines 2 and 3 might be interpreted as Filora co n(iunx) piissime vi(xit), 'Filora, his wife, lived most dutifully', but other interpretations are possible. 2 might be read as a second declension name in the dative, with M VI at the end of 3 as m(enses) VI, 'six months', the age at death. It would be tempting to restore the first word in 3 as [pie]ntissim(e), 'most dutifully', but there does not appear to be enough space at the beginning of the line for three letters, and the space before N also appears to have been blank. If the end of line 2 is also blank, this would exclude pientissime being divided between two lines. For pientissima/e and piissima/e, see L.A. Curchin, 'Familial epithets in the epigraphy of Roman Britain', Britannia 14 (1983), 255-6. 5 During excavation by Oxford Archaeology for CgMs Consulting on behalf of the developer, directed by Angela Boyle, who made this and the next item available to MWCH. Paul Booth, also of Oxford Archaeology, made them also available to RSOT, and provided information on the circumstances of discovery, and shared the results of his work with us; the description of the tombstones is his almost verbatim. Martin Henig discussed the first item with us, noting that the closest parallels to this style of banqueting scene come from Chester: see R.P. Wright and I.A. Richmond, Catalogue of the Roman Inscriptions and Sculptured Stones in the Grosvenor Museum, Chester (1955); and M. Henig, The Roman Sculpture from the North West Midlands (2004) = Corpus Signorum Imperii Romani 1.9, Part I (Chester and the rest of Cheshire), pp. 9-35 (Funerary Monuments). In Part II (Shropshire and Staffordshire), pp. 47-50 (Funerary Monuments), Henig includes six tombstones from Wroxeter, but none is of the funerary banquet type. The close stylistic connection between the Gloucester example and those from Chester, therefore, is to be explained by the presence of Legion XX at both places. 6 Compare RIB 523 (Chester), where the scroll is presumably the deceased's will. 7 In funerary scenes of this type, the deceased is represented by the reclining figure who is often attended, as here, by a (living) slave or servant. In the present case, uniquely for Roman Britain, the identity of the two figures is reversed: it is the standing figure, a fourteen-year-old slave boy, who is commemorated, and the reclining figure, his master, who survives him. It seems likely, however, that the tombstone was purchased in its finished state, complete but uninscribed, from the mason's yard, rather than being specially commssioned. The iconographic type, however, lent itself easily to the role-reversal seen here, incidentally preserving the difference in status between master and slave even after the latter's death. 8 The absence of Dis Manibus with the use of the h(ic) s(itus) e(st) formula suggests a pre-Flavian date; compare the next item (No. 3). In line 2, the first letter is either C or G, not (apparently) an incomplete Q or O. There is no obvious restoration, but the possibilities include G(ai) [Ci]loni and G[al]loni. In 3, there is a suprascript bar over X which does not extend to the four following digits. 474</page><page sequence="93">R.S.O. TOMLIN AND M.W.C. HASSALL FIG. 2. Gloucester, tombstone (No. 2).

Rectangular tombstone of oolitic limestone, originally 0.51 by at least 1.00 m, up to 0.11 m thick, found9 in 2004 c. 10 m from the previous item (No. 2). The stone is incomplete but consists of two main pieces and fifteen smaller ones, as well as minor fragments. The front of the tombstone carries a recess within a plain border, and this area is further subdivided into two panels. In the upper panel is the bust of the deceased, the top of the recess being carried up over his head in the form of an arch. He has projecting ears and hair brushed forward, and beneath his chin is a knot from which emanate two horizontal ends.10 Below and surrounded by its own plain border, is a larger panel on which is cut a five-line inscription: L A OCTAVI I L A POL I MARTIALIS I EPOREDIA I M A LEG XX, L(uci) Octavi I L(ucifili) Pol(lia tribu) I Martialis I Eporedia I m(ilitis) leg(ionis) XX. '(To the Shades of the Dead and) of Lucius Octavius Martialis, son of Lucius, of the Pollian voting-tribe, from Eporedia, soldier of the Twentieth Legion.'11 9 During a watching-brief. 10 It acts as a divider, but was perhaps meant to represent an amulet-thong. The soldier's face, with its jug-ears and fringe, is Claudio-Neronian in style: Favonius Facilis (RIB 200) is the classic example in Britain. 11 This is the first tombstone of a serving soldier of Legion XX from Gloucester, except for RIB 122 (Wotton, north-east of Gloucester), which however is incomplete and now lost. A veteran is also attested, in Britannia 15 (1984), 333, No. 1, with Britannia 17 (1986), 454 corrigendum (e). The legion is likely to have been stationed at Gloucester on two separate occasions: first during A.D. 48-57 at Kingsholm, and second during A.D. 67-75 at the (later) colonia site, before its transfer to Wroxeter and eventually to Chester: see Hassall in R.J. Brewer (ed.), Roman Fortresses and their Legions (2000), esp. 61-4, and in Y. le Bohec (ed.), Les Legions de Rome sous le Haut-Empire (2000), 441-57. It also constructed defences at Gloucester (see Britannia 17 (1986), 429, No. 3), either those of the colonia (thus Hassall) or of a late first-century legionary fortress (thus Hurst in H. Hurst (ed.), The Coloniae of Roman Britain (1999) [Journal of Roman Archaeology Supplementary Series No. 36], 181-9). The location of the tombstone is appropriate either to Kingsholm or the (later) colonia site, but Kingsholm is closer, and this suits its very early date. This can be deduced stylistically (see previous note) and from the formulation: there is no Dis Manibus, and the name of the deceased is in the genitive case. This unusual combination is found in the epitaph of Favonius Facilis (RIB 200, where the expansion Favoni(us) is unwarranted), and in the epitaphs of two serving legionaries at Lincoln, when the Ninth legion was still based there (RIB 256, where the genitive case is unambiguous, and RIB 254). This genitive probably represents an ellipse of Dis Manibus, which is explicit in the almost contemporary but more sophisticated tombstone of Julius Classicianus (RIB 12), whose name is also in the genitive case. As apparently in RIB 122, the legion lacks its cognomina V(aleria) V(ictrix), but this has little bearing on the question of whether it gained them in A.D. 61 or 83 (compare Tomlin in Britannia 23 (1992), 154-8), since the tombstone is probably earlier than 61. More surprising is the omission of the age of the deceased and his years of service, and perhaps of a concluding formula like h(ic) s(itus) e(st). In line 2, F forf(ili) is also omitted; this also is unusual, but for another example, see the next item (No. 4, Alchester). Eporedia in Italia Transpadana, modem Ivrea north of Turin, is noted by G. Forni, II Reclutamento delle Legioni da Augusto a Diocleziano (1953), 162 and 171, as the origin of four legionaries in the period from Augustus to Nero; to them may be added a fifth (AE 1966, 466) and a military tribune (CIL iii 2711).

It was made available by Chester Archaeological Service and the Grosvenor Museum, Chester, where Dan Robinson discussed it with MWCH. See above, pp. 422-3. 17 Mason (see previous note) argues that it is almost certainly to be associated with the Battle of Chester (c. A.D. 613), at which Aethelfrith of Northumbria defeated the forces of Gwynedd and Powys. 18 The inscription would have been five or six lines long. In 1, there is a possible trace of S for D(is) M(anibus) S(acrum), but the letter would have to be very narrow. In 3, the first letter after the medial point is apparently B, P or R, perhaps followed by II, which suggests a phrase like piissima uxor. The cognomen Donatus is quite common, but it does occur on another tombstone from Chester (RIB 523). 479</page><page sequence="98">ROMAN BRITAIN IN 2004 8. Chesters (Cilurnum, NY 913 700), Northumberland (FIG. 5). Fragment of a buff sandstone slab, 0.32 by 0.48 m, 0.21 m thick, found19 in 2004. The bottom edge is original, and it includes a plain double-moulding 70 mm wide, indicating that the inscribed panel was recessed. This would have measured c. 0.60 m (or more) by 0.44 m, to judge by the surviving text, part of seven lines, in letters rather narrow for their height (55 mm). In line 1, only their bottoms survive, but from the content it can be deduced that this was the original first line. The width can be calculated from the restoration of lines 1 and 7.20 In the bottom edge there is part of a socket 55 mm deep, indicating that the slab was intended for insertion into a masonry structure. The inscribed face is damaged and very worn: [...]MDOL[...] | [...]AVG A SAC[...] | [...]ACENTA.[...] I [...]MMACHAR[...] I [...]TEMPLI[...] I [...]NSTITVEROM[...] I [...]MOETAQVI[...], perhaps [I(ovi) O(ptimo)] M(aximo) Dol[icheno] I [Sal(uti)] Aug(ustae) sac[rum ...] [..]ACENTA...] I [sy]mmachar[...] |[ ...] templi [...] I[co]nstituer(unt) OM[...] I[Maxi]mo et Aqui[lino co(n)s(ulibus)].

(A.D. 286.)21 19 In the bed of the river North Tyne, just downstream from the bath-house. The landowner, Mr George Benson, presented it to the Trustees of the Clayton Collection, who have placed it on display in Chesters Museum, where Georgina Plowright made it available. She and RSOT have contributed a brief report, 'A new inscription from Chesters', to Archaeology in Northumberland 15 (2005), 50, with photographs. 20 Line 7 is clearly a consular date, and A.D. 286 is the only year in which an Aquilinus was the colleague of [...]mus; it was actually the second consulship of Marcus Iunius Maximus, but the numeral of iteration has been omitted, perhaps for reasons of space (see below). Their consulship gives the approximate width, showing that DOLICHENO belongs entirely to 1. But [I O] M DOL[ICHENO], unless it was generously spaced (and there is no sign that it was), would require only c. 0.60 m, rather less than [MAXI]MO ET AQVI[LINO COS] in 7. It follows that 7 was compressed, perhaps by ligaturing 'MA', 'NO' and 'CoS': compression is already implied by the surviving ligature 'MO'. This line-width of c. 0.60 m also suits the restoration of [SAL] in 2, [SY] in 4, and [CO] in 6: see next note. 21 For the restoration of I and 7, see previous note. In 2, three letters seem to have been lost between DOLICHENO and AVG. Although Augustus occurs as an epithet of Dolichenus (compare AE 1999, 1784, lovi Optimo Maximo Dolicheno Aug(usto) sacr(um)), an extra intervening epithet is most unlikely. There is no room either for [PRO SAL] AVG (compare RIB 1452, also from Chesters), which any way is precluded by SAC. But a secondary dedication to Salus Augusta is quite possible: compare AE 1988, 937, [I] O M DOLICHENO [S]AL AVG, and note that the deities are coupled in RIB 1131 (Corbridge). The next word, sacrum, may have been abbreviated. Nothing can be made of 3, which may have contained the dedicators' names: note the plural verb in 6. The second surviving letter is either C or G. Line 4 might contain two feminine names, [...]ma Char[is], but a more attractive possibility is the rare word [SY]MMACHAR[II ...] or [SY]MMACHAR[ORVM]. Little is known of the symmacharii ('allied troops'), but the only literary reference, ps.Hyginus, liber de munitionibus castrorum 29, implies that it was a collective term for irregular units of un-Roman type. The only epigraphic evidence is AE 1935, 12 (Ujo in Asturia), the career of Gaius Sulpicius Ursulus, whose first command was praefectus symmachiariorum Asturum belli Dacici. (For a brief discussion after Dobson, see E. Birley, Mavors IV, 389.) As it happens, the third-century garrison of Chesters was the ala II Asturum, and possibly it was reinforced by a draft from the original recruitment-area, but this can only be a guess. In line 5, the letter after TEMPL is almost lost, but the traces exclude V (for templum), and make A unlikely. The genitive case suggests a reference to the fittings of a temple, ornamenta omnia, or similar. In 6, the verb must be [co]nstituer(unt), not [i]nstituer(unt), for reasons of space. [re]stituer(unt) might have been expected here, but the letter before S is N, not E. The next word might be a case of omnis, but OM[NIA] is rather short for the space available; OM[NIBVS] would fit quite well. The consular date is the latest on an inscription from Roman Britain (see the Index to RIB, 31-32, where RIB 180 must be earlier), and this stone is apparently the latest military evidence of the cult of Jupiter Dolichenus (compare M.P. Speidel, The Religion ofJupiter Dolichenus in the Roman Army (1978), esp. 72-5). The cult did survive into the fourth century, but it was fatally compromised when the god failed to protect his own cult-centre from the Persians in A.D. 253 or 256. At Chesters it is already attested by RIB 1452 (where line 1 surely reads DOL[ICHENO] and GAL in 3 should be expanded as Gal(eria tribu)) and by a statue-base matching the statue of his consort Juno Regina (CSIR 1.6, Nos 118 and 117 respectively); these imply quite a substantial temple, whose existence is now explicit. 480</page><page sequence="99">R.S.O.

Scott collected local antiquities including RIB 2216, and was especially interested in the rock-cut figure 'Rob of Risingham' and its destruction. An altar (RIB 1228) dedicated to the Nymphs was found at a spring near Risingham in 1825. 25 Information from Colin Wallace, who sent a slide taken by Trevor Cowie. They were not able to establish provenance, but for Scott as an archaeologist and collector see H. Cheape, T. Cowie and C. Wallace, 'Sir Walter Scott, the Abbotsford collection and the National Museums of Scotland', in I.G. Brown (ed.), Abbotsford and Sir Walter Scott: The Image and the Influence (2003), 49-89. 26 The photograph (see previous note) makes it almost certain that there were only four lines, and this is confirmed by the text itself. To the left of RVBRIVS there must have been an abbreviated praenomen. The dedicator is otherwise unknown. 27 By the landowner, in whose possession it remains. It is fully published with commentary by B.J.N. Edwards and D.C.A. Shotter, 'Two Roman milestones from the Penrith area', in Cumb. Westm. Antiq. andArch. Soc. Transactions 105 (2005), forthcoming. We are indebted to the authors for a copy of their paper and other information. 28 Except for the insertion of PCOS, the Emperor's name and titles are identical to those of the Cawfields milestone (RIB 2306) of the same year. It is the first milestone to measure the distance explicitly from Carlisle, although this can be inferred for RIB 2283, and the second to be erected by the civitas Carvetiorum; the other is JRS 55 (1965), 224, No. 11, found nearby at Frenchfield, Brougham Castle, and dating to Postumus (A.D. 259-68). The civitas is also attested by the tombstone RIB 933 (Old Penrith), but since this is undated, the Langwathby milestone is now its earliest attestation. 29 During excavation by Grumbalds Ash Archaeology, directed by Rebecca Ireland and Andrew Jackson. Stephen Cosh sent a copy of the notice in Mosaic 31 (2004), 4-5, and his own drawing of the inscription which he recognized in 2004. 30 The inscription was meant to be read by standing in the room, and looking towards the walls; the surviving portion belongs to one corner, the two lines being at right-angles. Thus REGI[..]S is likely to be a word-ending, possibly the name Regi[nu]s, but there are other possibilities, e.g. regi[bu]s.

To the left of it, the edge is broken, but the photograph indicates folded metal which might mask the tip of C. *Lutamus is unattested, but the name Clutamus (a Celtic superlative meaning 'very famous') is found in Spain (CIL ii 2584, 2633) and as the patronymic of a cavalry officer likely to be Spanish in origin (CIL iii 2016). 42 During excavation by North Pennines Archaeology for Leader Construction, directed by Frank Giecco, who made them available (context 487, s.f. 273). They will go to Tullie House Museum, Carlisle. 43 There is only space for one letter before graffito (iii), so (ii) was probably a personal name abbreviated to its first three letters, for example MAR for Martialis (RIB II.7, 2501.322-325, 332). 44 This graffito overlies two unrelated scratches; the third, a 'descender' from S, is only a slip. Almost the only possible names are Aestivus and Festivus, but the incomplete letter before S cannot be E; it looks more like X or possibly A. 45 Perhaps an abbreviation of tria nomina formed like RIB 1445, L(uci) A(.)

These are the first sealings of the ala to be found, which is already attested in Britain by diplomas (see Britannia 25 (1994), 44) but only by one inscription, RIB 2140 at Mumrills in the Antonine period. The sealings are unstratified, but the pottery from the excavation was predominantly third-century (information from L. Hird), so it is likely that the ala was then stationed at Papcastle. 47 Olus is a doublet of the praenomen Aulus; see for example CIL iv 2353, Aulus Olo suo salutem (quoted by V.

Hoard found54 in 2002, comprising gold jewellery, a silver figurine and inscribed base, two silver model arms, and nineteen votive plaques, seven of gold and twelve of silver. The plaques are very similar in style to RIB 218 and 220 (Barkway), and most of them are inscribed. They are dedicated to the same deity as the silver base itself; on this, in letters formed by punched dots: o D o SENVNE FLAVIA o CVNORIS o V o S o L o M, d(eae) Senun(a)e Flavia Cunoris v(otum) s(olvit) l(ibens) m(erito). 'To the goddess Senuna, Flavia Cunoris paid her vow, willingly, deservedly.'55 51 With the next item during excavation by Colchester Archaeological Trust for Roff Marsh Partnership on behalf of the Sixth Form College, directed by Ben Holloway, who provided details of both items. 52 This is a (feminine) nomen, but there is no other possibility in Mf6csy, Nomenclator; six of his examples come from Gallia Narbonensis, and three from Italy. 53 There are other possibilities, for example Mari[anus] (compare item No. 42 below) and Mari[nianus] (compare CIL vi 3279, natione Britanicianus). 54 By a metal-detectorist who informed Gil Burleigh, the local archaeological adviser to the Coroner. The hoard was declared Treasure in 2003 and was acquired by the British Museum, where it is now on display; here Ralph Jackson made it available to RSOT. When the subsequent series of excavations directed by Mr Burleigh has come to an end, and the plaques have all been cleaned, there will be an interim account of the inscriptions in these pages. Meanwhile there is a brief report by Ralph Jackson in Instrumentum 20 (Dec. 2004), 10, and another by RSOT in the forthcoming Proceedings of the second international Instrumentum Domesticum conference at Klagenfurt (May 2005). We have discussed the names with Patrick Sims-Williams. 55 Senuna is once attested as a personal name (RIB 11.7, 501.505), but the goddess was hitherto unknown; she can now be recognized in RIB 11.3, 2422.33 (see below, Addenda et Corrigenda (a)). Her name is apparently compounded from the adjective *seno- ('old'), a frequent name-element, and the suffix -una, the latter found (for example) in the British river-name Ituna. The plaques, but not the figurine, give her the visual attributes of Minerva, like the spring- goddess Sulis Minerva. Since there are springs near the find-spot, it is tempting therefore to associate her with the south-British river whose name is transmitted by the Ravenna Cosmography (108.40) as Senua. Cunoris is presumably a variant of *Cunorix, compounded from the well-attested elements, *cuno- ('hound') and *rix ('king'); -rix names are sometimes borne by women. 489</page><page sequence="108">ROMAN BRITAIN IN 2004 LONDON 31. The City (Londinium, TQ 3192 8132), Newgate Triangle, Paternoster Square, a site bounded to the north by the main Roman road leading west from the city.

Jackie Keily provided information and made the tag, 468 from context NGTOO [185], available to RSOT. 57 L of Similis resembles inverted T. The cognomen Surus is much more common than the derived nomen Surius (they both have the genitive Suri), and a name 'Surius Vitalis, son of Similis' would be unlikely for other reasons. The sequence of three cognomina could be understood as Suri (servi) Vitalis Similis f(ili), '(the property) of Surus, the slave of Vitalis son of Similis', but this again is unlikely, particularly since the cognomen Surus is not typical of slaves; it is widely distributed, especially in northern Italy, Noricum and Dalmatia. The label looks as if it were made for attachment to a piece of military equipment, and would have identified the owner as usual by name and century, in this case not legionary, but auxiliary. There is no trace of a centurial sign before SVRI, so this would be a rare instance of its omission (compare RIB 344 and Britannia 8 (1977), 433, No. 32). The name Vitalis is very common, but Similis is found especially in the Cologne area and the lower Rhineland, from which came much of the invading army. 58 With the next four items during excavation by Pre-Construct Archaeology directed by Helen Clough (site supervisor) and Robin Taylor-Wilson (project manager). Jenny Proctor made the sherds available, and they were identified by Felicity Wild. 59 The first letter is now incomplete. The first A has a short diagonal 'cross-bar', but the second A is 'open'. It is uncertain whether the graffito consisted of a single word or not, but if so, it was probably the masculine cognomen Flavianus, in the nominative or genitive case. 60 Only the tip survives of R, and the first letter(s) might be N, but the angle formed by the two scratches (which do not meet) is rather too wide. An inverted reading SAN[...] cannot be excluded, but it looks unlikely. Many names end in -rius, but they are nomina which would be followed by a cognomen. A few, like Valerius, were sometimes used as cognomina; but much the commonest, in Britain at least, is Ianuarius: for other instances on samian, see RIB 11.7, 2501.226-233. 490</page><page sequence="109">R.S.O.

Birley reads ADV[...], but the line-drawing (fig. 139.27) supports the reading suggested here. Atto and its cognates are frequent in the Rhineland, and thus in Britain; an example is the decurion Atto at Vindolanda (Tab. Vindol. II 345 i 1-2, etc.). 71 The third letter might be G. It is followed by two 'letters', the first a hook, the second a triangle. Possibilities are discussed by Birley. 72 There is no obvious name; possibilities are discussed by Birley. 73 The cognomen is common, especially among soldiers, and is well attested at Vindolanda. 74 Not seen by RSOT. Many Celtic names incorporate the element *maro- ('great'). 75 The cognomen is quite common, but is found in two of the ink tablets (Tab. Vindol. II 352 + add., III 514) and a stilus tablet (Inv. no. 87.689). 493</page><page sequence="112">ROMAN BRITAIN IN 2004 55.

[... ]NIG, Nig(er) or Nig(rinus).84 76 The rest of the reading is uncertain. The first letter might be A or D, the fourth letter D or G. Birley discusses it in detail, and tentatively offers DRIIGIIN[..]. 77 Most likely the abbreviated tria nomina, M(arcus) H(.) N(.), but the letters might be Greek and thus a personal name abbreviated to Men(..). 78 The first letter is made with a curve and diagonal stroke more appropriate to G than C (thus Birley), but C is also possible; neither reading is attractive. 79 Not seen by RSOT. 80so There is no obvious solution. Birley cites some unique names with this letter-sequence, to which Valacius can be added. 81 This name occurs at Housesteads as well as in Lower Germany (RIB II.8, 2503.355 with note), and it may be a Tungrian personal name. The First Cohort of Tungrians was at Vindolanda in c. A.D. 90-120, and at Housesteads in the third century. 82 Only an upper loop survives of the first letter, which might be P, but the spacing suits R. S is barred (i.e. sextarios). The first word might identify the contents, but there is no likely candidate, so it is probably the owner's name in the genitive case, for example [Te]rti. 83 There were 16 asses to the denarius. For the symbols used in monetary accounts at Vindolanda, see Tab. Vindol. II, pp. 54-5. The broken edge cuts the denarii sign, so that it resembles half an X, but the end of the horizontal stroke to the left can just be seen. 84 There is a point before N, perhaps indicating that an abbreviated nomen has been lost, but the graffito is probably complete. For Nigrinus, see above, No. 63. The cognomen Niger, from which it derives, is also common. 494</page><page sequence="113">R.S.O. TOMLIN AND M.W.C. HASSALL 68.

A photograph taken c. 1900 records details now lost of the standing figure to the left of the published inscription. A theatrical mask hangs by her right knee, and she holds open an inscribed scroll. This apparently reads: [...] I IEIA, and may identify her as Thalia (the Muse of pantomime) or Polymnia (the Muse of sacred song).91 (c) RIB 11.7, 2501.194 (Vindolanda), samian (Drag. 43) graffito reading FOF, 'present whereabouts unknown'. This is apparently an error for Chesterholm Museum No. 6644, four sherds comprising most of a black-burnished (BB 1) platter, which has now been found92 with pottery from the 1930s excavations. Scratched inside after firing, on the upper surface of the flat base: FOF. (d) Britannia 34 (2003), 362, No. 2, City of London, Guildhall Yard. The translation of this 'curse tablet' should read: 'I give to the goddess Deana (my) headgear and band less one-third. If anyone has done this, whether boy or girl, whether slave or free, I give him, and through me let him be unable to live.' The commentary should have emphasized that it was found in the Roman amphitheatre, since Diana (or Deana), sometimes identified with Nemesis, was particularly associated with gladiatorial games and the amphitheatre.93 CHANGES OF LOCATION (a) RIB 1004, Wetheral (Cumbria).

Ael. 4th ser. 9 (1932), 219. 93 As the excavator, Nick Bateman, has reminded us. The connection is made by Tertullian, De Spectaculis 12, and is confirmed by many dedications from amphitheatres, for example CIL iii 10440 (Aquincum), 14074 (Carnuntum), and Bonner Jahrbiicher 160 (1960), 162-3 (Cologne).

Information from Ben Edwards. 97 RSOT has not seen it, but he has been told that there were traces of polish(?) in the letters as if to 'age' them. Another informant has told him independently that he knew the local collector who was responsible for cutting this altar and several 'Celtic' heads, using stone from a garden in Bradford-on-Avon. When it was offered for sale to the Roman Baths Museum, Bath, it was declined. 98 Illustrated as (part) Lot 365 in the Bonhams (Knightsbridge, London) auction of Antiquities, 22 September 1998. It is Romano-British in appearance, as are most of the letters, but they have been picked out in modem red paint.
