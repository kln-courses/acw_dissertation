<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE FIRST OF THE MODERNS OR THE LAST OF THE ANCIENTS? BERNARDINO TELESIO ON NATURE AND SENTIENCE Guido Giglioni nihil apud nos impatibile est Bernardino Telesio, De rerum natura SUMMARY Bernardino Telesio's philosophy of nature marked a momentous change in the philosophical panorama of late Renaissance. By redefìning the notion of sentience (sensus) as the ability, inherent in the two principle forces of the universe (heat and cold), to react and adapt to a reality in constant change, Telesio championed a view of nature and man that radically departed ffom the principles of Aristotle's namral philosophy. In developing his new notion of sentience, Telesio insisted on the aspects of receptivity and awareness. Through the first, he stressed the primary role of pneu matic matter (spiritus), understood as a thin, supple and swift vehicle capable of ac counting for ali material changes in the universe; through the second, he raised the property of self-perception to the level of a universal naturai property. This allowed him to replace the key Aristotelian concept of unintentional teleology with the idea of a self-organising power inherent in namre and to endow the material spirit with the ability to feel and react to ali phenomena occurring in the universe (spiritus om tiiscius omnino). By relying on subtly discerning tendencies of pursuit and avoidance, Telesio's spirit was thus capable of preserving life at ali levels, both higher and lower, physical and ethical. Francis Bacon's représentation of Bernardino Telesio as the first of the modems is well known. His portrayal of Telesio as the restorer of Par menides' philosophy proved to be influential as well. The reason that such an interprétation became so successful is that it epitomised the characteris tic tensions of Telesio's philosophy, especially his attempt to provide a radi cally new view of nature while remaining faithful to very ancient Systems of thought. In the following centuries, Bacon s reading became extremely popular in the annals of history of philosophy, perhaps too popular. As a resuit, Telesio remained frozen in his rôle of the iconoclastie thinker who availed himself of the materialistic interprétation of Eleatic monism in or der to overturn the Aristotelian universe fforn its foundations. (To be fair, in this story one should also remember Francesco Patrizi, who played a crucial «BRUNIANA &amp; CAMP ANELLI AN A», XVI, 1, 2010</page><page sequence="2">70 GUIDO GIGLIONI role in the construction of the Telesian myth, which, as any other myth, contains a certain amount of truth).1 There is no doubt that Telesio's attack on Aristotelian naturai philoso phy was originai and groundbreaking. However, it would be fair to say that his work remained deeply rooted in the hermeneutical situation of Renais sance Aristotelianism and adhered to the characteristic scholastic formats of the commentary and the quaestio (with its stringent successions of objec tions and replies). This is not surprising if we think that Telesio studied at Padua and that his trip to Brescia in 1563 to consult with Vincenzo Maggi - a renowned authority on Aristotelian matters at the rime - wasn't just a courtesy cali.2 Moreover, it is évident how Telesio decided to conduci his critique of the Aristotelian worldview by producing a slow, word-by-word, almost parasitic appropriation of the Aristotelian text (and the same could be said of the relationship that connects Telesio's medicai tracts to the body of Galenic works). Finally, a large part of his materialistic reinterpretations of key tenets of Aristotelian philosophy relied on the recovery of past doc trines. Leaving aside for the moment the Parmenidean affair, Telesio's ar 1 F. Bacon, Thema coeli, in Philosophical Studies c. 161 i-c.1619, ed. with introduction, notes and commentaries by G.

In Padua Telesio studied philosophy (under Gerolamo Amalteo), mathematics (under Fed erico Delfino), medicine and 'perspective'. Cesare Vasoli emphasises the importance of the Paduan experience in order to understand Telesio's relationship with Aristole's philosophy (C. Vasoli, Ragioni di un convegno, in Bernardino Telesio e la cultura napoletana, cit., pp. 497 498). As pointed out by Charles Schmitt and Brian Copenhaver, Telesio happened to be in Padua when Vesalio was teaching anatomy and when the debate on the soul sparked off by Pomponazzi's philosophy reached its apex (Β. P. Copenhaver and C. B. Schmitt, Renais sance Philosophy, Oxford, Oxford University Press, 1992, p. 310). On Telesio's appropriation of key Atistotelian tenets, see M.-P.

While I would be wary of dismissing Dilthey's old thesis that Stoicism (with its emphasis on reason embedded in nature and nature as embodied reason) played a signifi cant role in Telesio's new philosophy of nature,1 I have no qualms about getting rid of the thesis that Telesio's 'modernity' dépends on his alleged empiricism, or the thesis that he was not 'modem', or at least 'not modem enough', because he did not leave any room for mathematics in his system of nature.2 ι. From Aristotle's unsentient nature to Telesio's sentience OF NATURE To avoid getting caught in a quagmire of conflicting interprétations, I will try to tackle the question from a différent, safer angle. Everyone agrees that the most innovative aspect of Telesio's philosophy lies in his bold state ment concerning the autonomy of nature - natura iuxta propria principia. But what is exactly 'nature' for Telesio? It is safe to say that Telesio looked at nature as a self-sufficient system, based on the actions and reactions of two conflicting principles, heat and cold, which constantly try to get hold of the bodily bulk of matter (corporea moles). The préservation of the precari ous balance of the universe (conservatio sui) results from the way in which heat and cold confront each other. The unremitting series of conflicts and truces they go through follows the model of physical change known in an tiquity as 'antiperistasis', that is, a system of organised reactivity in which two or more forces manage to remain in a state of tension by alternatively chasing and fleeing each other. Heat and cold do not act blindly and arbi trarily, nor are they instruments in the hand of some omniscient power. In Telesio's opinion, the self-regulatory mechanism is internai to nature and it corresponds to the active principle that he calls «sense» (sensus). There is 1 W. Dilthey, Weltanshauung und Analyse des Menschen seit Renaissance und Reformation (Gesammelte Schriften, n), Stuttgart and Goettingen, Teubner and Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, 1957, PP· 433 437· On Dilthey's interprétation of Telesio, see A. Orsucci, A proposito dell'inte resse di Dilthey per l'antropologia cinquecentesca, in Bernardino Telesio e la cultura napoletana, cit., pp. 417-425. A close reading of Telesio's work reveals that the presence of Stoic themes and their role in shaping his thought cannot be downplayed. A few examples: the idea of an all pervading, active and tenuous substance (spirit), the pneumatic and material nature of the soul, the belief in the rational order of the universe, the concept of a naturai orientation to one's own good (oikeiosis) and the notion of virtue as a form of knowledge. 2 For recent studies on Telesio's philosophy, see: L. De Franco, Introduzione a Bernardino Telesio, Soveria Mannelli, Rubbettino, 1995; R. Bondì, Introduzione a Telesio, Rome and Bari, Laterza, 1997; M. Mulsow, Friihneuzeitliche Selbsterhaltung. Telesio und die Naturphilosophie der Renaissance, Tiibingen, Niemeyer, 1998.</page><page sequence="4">72 GUIDO GIGLIONI no need to look for an ideal craftsman (artifex) capable of moderating the forces of heat and cold according to the internai constitution of naturai beings.1 As Tommaso Campanella would point out a few years later, the extent to which things can be said to be self-sufficient dépends on their level of sentience.2 By providing a rigorous account of the material universe and its phenomena based on the complementary notions of nature, perception and self-preservation, Telesio managed to lay the foundation for a new vi sion of naturai autonomy. In a very originai way, Telesio's notion of sentience combines two almost opposite characteristics: material change and the awareness that accompa nies such a change. Telesio defìnes naturai sentience as the ability inherent in the active natures (heat and cold) to recognise similarities and différenc es while they proceed to shape matter through movements of pursuit and avoidance. Through a direct and unmediated récognition of material reality that is based on a direct and unmediated perception of their own identity, heat and cold strive for their self-preservation, knowingly and expediently. On the other hand, though, Telesio insists on the material and transforma tive character of perception. Acts of sentience are corporeal because first and foremost they presuppose physical reactions and corporeal assimila tions between subjects and objects of knowledge. It does not come as too much of a surprise, then, to learn that Telesio considered the sense of touch to be the primary sense. Through acts of récognition and assimilation, ali sentient principles perceive and react to the material change wrought upon themselves. This means that Telesio does not confine the meaning of pas sion to the condition of being affected and acted upon by an external acting principle. Passion, in the context of Telesio's naturai philosophy, signifies a process of réceptive suppleness that includes a dimension of active response. We can therefore say that Telesio understands sensus as the primordial sense of being affected pervading the entire universe. By being an intentional and purposive reaction, perception is not a condition of passivity that remains at the level of unconscious activity. Ali sentient beings «sense», «feel» the things that act upon them, delight in their contact every time they recognise a similarity of nature and fighi against them when they perceive a threat to their condition. As a synthesis of récognition and transformation - that is, insofar as it is a vital passion - Telesio's sensus is an undivided and seamless process in which feeling, appetite and motion mutate into each other. 1 Citations from Telesio's De rerum natura are front Luigi De Franco's édition (Cosenza, Casa Del Libro, 1965-1974, vols i-η; Florence, La Nuova Italia, 1976, vol. m).

Ev ery naturai being undergoing a sensation must necessarily be aware of its own modifications and of the actions that any other naturai being can cause on it. Heat and cold perceive external things only insofar as they perceive themselves as being modified by the external things.1 Unlike Aristotle, Tele sio does not think that the sentient faculty is actualised by the form of the perceived thing, nor does he endorse the view that ail acts of sensation sim ply mirror an external world, unaffected by the perceptions of the sentient principle. Sentient powers perceive the world by perceiving themselves af fected by the world. From what has been said so far, it is clear that, as a synthesis of mate rial change and active récognition, naturai sentience implies a condition of awareness. Telesio's sensus is fundamentally sensus sui and nature is accord ingly conscious nature. If the autonomy of nature relies on its being aware of its own processes, can nature stili be called 'nature'? In the rest of this essay, I will argue that Telesio could in fact describe nature as a self-sufficient and self-maintaining power because he looked at the universe as a system endowed with self-awareness. I will substantiate my argument, first, by ex amining Patrizi's general criticisms of Telesio's naturai philosophy, then, by dwelling on Telesio's account of the involuntary functions of the body and, finally, by singling out the philosophical implications underlying his ethics of self-preservation. 2. How Patrizi unveiled Telesio's most recondite METAPHYSICAL ASSUMPTIONS In his criticai review of Telesio's philosophy, Patrizi did not miss the oppor tunity to lay bare the metaphysical implications underlying Telesio's attack on Aristotle. According to Patrizi, far frorn relying only on the unmediated and unadulterated perception of the senses, Telesio outlined a rather so phisticated and complex metaphysics of the senses. His notion of material sentience had both epistemological and ontological connotations. Believing that sensation could act as both a source and a foundation of knowledge, he based the reliability of reason and the intellect on the certainty provided by the senses. Indeed, for Telesio, reason and intellect were effete and decaying forms of sensus. It is especially when one examines Telesio's account of maris higher cog nitive faculties that his belief in the ontological primacy of the senses comes 1 Ibidem, vu, 2 (ed. De Franco, ni, p. 6).</page><page sequence="6">74 GUIDO GIGLIONI to the fore. He thought that, regardless of whether one looks at knowledge as an adaptive and self-preserving activity evolving ffom an inner sense of touch or as an inferential skill that develops ffom increasingly more abstract functions of the intellect, the fact remains that by perceiving external things a naturai being perceives the whole life of the universe, for ffom the very beginning a naturai being is already furnished with the subtlest abilities and skills (ingenium).1 The only différence between sense and intellect is one of degree, rather than of nature. Knowledge in ali its forms, both concrete and abstract, originates ffom a direct material contact with reality, i.e., ffom a corporeal immersion into the sentient life of the universe. By contrast, the knowledge provided by the intellect, with its tortuous path of médiations and comparisons, lacks the vigour and adroitness that characterise the op érations of sensus. Patrizi mistook Telesio's notion of self-aware and self-organising sen tience for an expression of tacit and undigested Platonism. He remained convinced that a chasm divided the senses ffom the intellect, and that only the power of the intellect, acting ffom above, could spread the light of in tentional knowledge through an otherwise inanimate world of inert mat ter. By contrast, Telesio believed that material sentience in itself had the power of unifying the parts of the universe through récurrent patterns of actions and reactions, mediating between the whole and the parts, between the past, the présent and the future, the visible and the invisible, causes and effects.2 In this perspective, the intellect represented a more developed form of sentient perception, through which higher organisms were better suited to meet their complex needs. There was, therefore, no need to rely on a universal faculty supervising nature - a soul of the world - for nature, being the originai repository of sensus, does not need intellect, memory, or imagi nation to be guided in its opérations. This is a very important point, which is worth hearing in mind every time one is conffonted with the question of Telesio's anthropomorphism and animism. One could say that Patrizi was right in arguing that Telesio's physics of sentient spirit was, in fact, a metaphysics of naturai perception. Also, one may assume that Telesio and Patrizi would in the end agree that the ulti mate principle governing nature was reason, provided that by «reason» they meant the ability inherent in ali naturai beings to choose what is conducive to their self-preservation. Finally, Patrizi was probably right in objecting to Telesio that mere degrees of heat and cold could never result in the forma 1 On the notion of ingenium in a Telesian context, see A.

However, he missed Telesio's fundamental point that the sentient activity of nature could not be understood simply as a material change mechanically impressed on the sense organs by external objects, or as a reflection of Platonic ideas preserved in nature in a state of latent vir tuality. For Telesio, naturai sentience was the very activity promoted by the forces of heat and cold in their constant attempts to give shape and struc ture to the world. In ali likelihood, Patrizi's review of De rerum natura stimulated Telesio's speculative acumen. In the last édition of the work, published in 1586, he gives the impression that he took Patrizi's objections seriously. He fleshed out the notion of a teleological disposition to being affected by and respond ing to external things inherent in nature and presented such disposition as the foundation of the material universe. He unambiguously characterised sentience as the metaphysical rationale behind the homeostatic balance of the universe. The vicissitudes of the sentient spirit, especially in the way they are described in the last books of De natura rerum - i.e., as resulting fforn an inherently restless substance, thrown into the prison of matter (i.e., the bodily tegument), front which it strives to free itself and rejoin the heav en, its originai abode - resonate with Platonic echoes, while maintaining strong naturalistic traits. Campanella - much more open to Platonic sug gestions than Telesio - would bear in mind such a Platonic rereading in es pousing the doctrine of the anima mundi and articulating his metaphysics of the primai attributes of being (primalitates).1 But what Telesio seems to have accomplished in a more straightforward manner than Campanella would do was to show that the distinctions between souls and nature, on the one hand, and between nature and matter, on the other, were not as neatly spec ified as both Plato and Aristotle had thought. This key point becomes more évident when we examine Telesio's medicai explanations concerning the involuntary opérations of the body.2 3· Ανατομυ and the scope of the involuntary functions Telesio's belief that the universe is governed by intentional knowledge in the form of a sentient, discerning and adaptive tendency, and not by nature 1 T.

Here Telesio is concerned with the role of what he calls «sentient substance», that is, the entire reserve of spirituous matter circulating within the nervous network (universitas spir itus) and distributed by the nerves throughout the body starting front the ventricles of the brain, where the spirit is located for the most part. Telesio calls the whole system of nervous ramifications carrying the spirit, includ ing the brain, the nervous system (genus nervosum). In contrast with both the Aristotelian notion of vegetative soul and the Galenic doctrine of the naturai faculties - a view that, according to Telesio, relies on the assumption that there may be a kind of substance that is «dull and completely devoid of knowledge» (bruta cognitionisque omnis expers substantia)1 - Telesio argues that there is no qualitative distinction between animai (voluntary) and nat urai (involuntary) actions in the body because, first, the soul - which for Telesio is the same thing as the material spirit - is one and not divided into many faculties, and, second, because the spirit is ali sentient, and must be so in order to be able to perform such delicate and complex opérations as the heartbeat, respiration, nutrition, attraction, sécrétion and excrétion.2 As in the greater body of the universe ali material changes resuit from processes of condensation and raréfaction regulated by the forces of sentient cold and heat, so in the lesser body of human beings the contractions and expansions of the fibres are governed by the ratio of the whole spirit (summa et ipsae [...] operantur ratione).3 Telesio argues that the spirit must be thin, supple and continuous in order to move quickly and transmit the directions imparted by the «sentient and intelligent» substance. As is often the case with Telesio, a fine line divides the sphere of vital and sentient opérations from that of the material characteristics of the vehicle.4 1 Β.

The sentient nature of the spirit is such that, by perceiving individuai objects, it perceives the whole uni verse («quae sentit, universa ea simul sentiat omnia»). The perception of the spirit govern ing the body is universal and flawless: «Itaque, ut dictum est, quod spiritus portionum, cui reliquarum passiones rerumque omnium vires et reliquae percipiendae sunt condiciones, motuumque, quibus a singulis commotus est, memoria cognitioque servanda retinendaque est; et ex iis remotarum et praesentium etiam, at quarum non omnes condiciones manifestae sunt, quae latent intelligendae sunt omnes; et modus insuper, quo, quae spiritus portiones patiuntur, mala reiciantur, et quibus opus habent, comparentur, motus nimirum inveniendi sunt, quibus illa omnia peragantur; et singulae spiritus portiones iis commovendae; denique quia reficiendae sunt omnes: utique spiritus universitas ejusmodi sedi itaque constructae, cujusmodi cerebrum est, et quomodo cerebrum constructum videtur, et cerebro omnino indenda fuit». 3 Ibidem, v, 14 (ed. De Franco, 11, p. 296). 4 Ibidem, v, 13 (ed. De Franco, 11, pp. 286-288). Telesio acknowledges that the communi cation between the universitas of the spirit in the brain and the portions of spirit scattered</page><page sequence="9">THE FIRST OF THE MODERNS OR THE LAST OF THE ANCIENTS? 77 Telesio objects to Galen that a 'naturai' (i.e., involuntary and vegetative) action, if there is any such action, should constantly follow the same pat tern and should behave according to the same ratio because it is nature's prerogative to persisi indefinitely, unknowingly and unflinchingly in the un dertaken path. Any déviation from it would represent an arbitrary or vio lent modification of a teleologically determined course of action. However, in Telesio's view, such an inflexible necessity would not be compatible with the flexible and fallible nature of the vital economy of the body. Ali pro cesses, even the simplest ones, involve a certain amount of modifications and adjustments to varying conditions, both internai or external. Such an ability to change in response to internai and external variations - what Tele sio calls the ratio vivendi - implies the ability to abandon the usuai path and to start the formation of new habits. In other words, it involves knowledge and choice, something that is categorically excluded by the Aristotelian and Galenic notions of vegetative soul and naturai faculty. In Telesio's opinion, what at first sight seems to be naturai and involuntary, on closer inspection is, in fact, the outcome of a learning process and the establishment of a suc cessful custom - a type of action that présupposés at the beginning a clear act of knowledge.1 In Telesio's anatomy, therefore, it is the soul, and not nature, that is the principle of bodily life. Of course, by 'soul' Telesio means a corporeal, sen tient and knowing spirit, and not an immaterial form (as in Aristo tle), nor a spécifie disposition resulting from a balanced combination of corporeal qualifies and humors (as is the case with Galen's tempérament). Telesio's soul is the resuit of an integrated system of myriad interconnected opéra tions, and not a set of vital levels hierarchically nested within each other (nutrition, sense, appetite and intellect, to follow the main stages in life ac cording to Aristotle's theory of the soul). The organic, unified and seamless activity of the soul is not determined by the unity of a formai principle; throughout the body is a phenomenon that is longe obscurissimum (De rerum natura, v, 14 (ed. De Franco, 11, pp. 298-300)). 1 Ibidem, v, 13 (ed. De Franco, 11, p. 286); v, 24 (ed. De Franco, 11, p. 350). See also ibidem, iv, 28 (ed. De Franco, 11, p. 192) (where Telesio infers the sun's summa cognitio and summa ratio from its ability to interrupt, increase and diminish its power); Idem, Quod animai universum ab unica animae substantia gubernatur, cit., pp. 214-218. It is worth remembering that Giovanni Alfonso Borelli's explanation of the heartbeat as the resuit of an original learning process on the soul's part, a process that in time becomes a habit and that only apparently (or perhaps only partially) is mechanical and involuntary, seems to derive from this tradition of sentient naturalism (to be sure, through the médiation of Campanella) rather than from Descartes' programme of mechanistic anatomy.

Telesio's redéfinition of the vital economy of the body has a sériés of important con séquences: it debunks the main assumption underlying Aristotelian natu ralism (i.e., the existence of an all-encompassing and purposeful naturai agency), it shifts the emphasis ffom Galen's temperamentum to the soul, and, finally, it makes the soul a particular case of the universal sentience of the cosmos. Knowledge (summus sensus and sutnma cognitio) is diffused ali over the body, in the form of a faculty that is capable of both judgment and will.1 That each single part is able to perform its own spécifie functions smoothly and forcefully, and - what is even more astonishing - in perfect agreement with the actions of ali the other parts, dépends on the fact that the whole system of sentient spirit located in the brain acts as a fully-fledged knowing subject, acquainted with everything occurring in both the body and the cos mos. Telesio's thesis is indeed astonishing, but the rigour of his philosophi cal démonstrations mitigates the strikingly bold move of postulating a fully aware material spirit acting in nature. 4- Sensus, sapientia and spiritus omniscius The study of the human body and its vital fonctions demonstrates that the universitas spiritus has the ability to accommodate the organism to the changes of its environment in the best possible way, for it knows what needs to be modified in order to preserve a balanced interplay between inward and outward changes. In contrast to the Hippocratic, Aristotelian and Galenic view of nature as a power that uniformly and relentlessly accomplishes ali the ends it has in view (provided that matter is not too récalcitrant), and that in so doing it contributes to the general order of the universe, Telesio insists on the aspects of contingency, mutability and uncertainty through which the sentient spirit responds and adapts to the varying circumstances of an ever changing world. In each situation and at the righi moment, within the system of antiperistaltic actions and reactions created by the forces of heat and cold, the spirit finds the appropriate means to maintain the overall bai ance. Here Telesio identifies another crucial différence between Aristotle's and his own system. In Aristotle's philosophy, naturai powers cannot act dif ferently front the way they do because the many possibilities of material development are determined by an unstoppable tendency to be actualized by their corresponding forms, and therefore there is no need for cognitive 1 Telesio, Quod animal universum ab unica animae substantia gubernatur, cit., p. 228; Idem, De rerum natura, v, 14 (ed. De Franco, 11, p. 292). See ibidem, v, 16 (ed. De Franco, 11, p. 304): «Neque enim, nisi partibus insit omnibus, omnium nécessitâtes percipiat».</page><page sequence="11">THE FIRST OF THE MODERNS OR THE LAST OF THE ANCIENTS? 79 principles or souls to regulate the process of actualisation; which means that, when the potentiality of a naturai power is fully developed and no obstacle intervenes, the end resuit comes about as a necessary outcome. In the Metaphysics, Aristotle had explained that, while rational powers have the flexibility to choose between contrarieties and are therefore able to act in opposite directions, naturai powers can only be determined in one direc tion.1 Telesio's view introduces a crucial différence: the ability to discrimi nate between alternatives is embedded in the primai motions of nature, i.e., the tendencies of cold and heat respectively to contract and to expand. The active natures modify their opérations according to the ever changing circumstances of the whole system of antiperistaltic actions and reactions, and therefore they need to be sentient and intentional powers. In the key notion of seif-preservation, Telesio's emphasis is on the 'self ; ali the more so because heat, cold and the sentient spirit do not act driven by self-interest or immediate pleasure, but are provided with the ability to know what is the best option for them (i.e., self-preservation), to defer immediate gratifi cation and to tolerate a certain amount of pain in view of a greater advan tage.2 Telesio can therefore identify the cognitive power of the active natures with their virtue. Spirits are virtuous because «they know what opérations they need to perform in order to preserve and perfect themselves».3 In con tributing to the best disposition of the world, they act 'morally'. Since spirit is a mixture of heat and matter, its spécifie virtue (that is, the degree of knowledge with which it is endowed) dépends on the way in which heat takes possession of matter and deals with the antagonistic principle of cold. Telesio defines virtue as corporeal knowledge, i.e., both a naturai force and a material quality, a property that, in the final analysis, coincides with the degree of warmth, subtlety and purity contained in the matter of the spir its. This is in fine with Telesio's belief that heat, motion and sense share the same active and purposive nature. Virtue is the spirit's ability to intensify or restrain its own actions and passions in order to preserve its own nature, and by preserving itself, the spirit contributes to the préservation of the universe. It is no wonder, then, that in Telesio's list of virtues, sapientia ranks as the most important. Telesio characterises sapientia as «the intelligent fac ulty that is in command of and tries to perceive the nature and the forces 1 Aristotle, Metaphysica, ιχ, ι; Physica, vm, i, 25iab. 2 On the Stoic concept of self-preservation, see: G.

De Franco, ih, p. 328).</page><page sequence="12">8θ GUIDO GIGLIONI of ali things and to understand those which cannot be perceived; in short, it is a faculty that has the power to understand».1 In his treatment of the principal virtues, Telesio relies on the common définition of sapientia. «The wise man is the one who has investigated the nature and the forces of ali things», he says in De rerum natura;2 however, as Campanella will point out in a perfect Telesian spirit, sapere means, first and foremost, «to savor», «to have sense and discernment» and, accordingly, «to be sensible».3 The practi cal knowledge of the world - the virtue of wisdom - is rooted in the cor poreal sense, i.e., in the embodied knowledge that organises and governs the universe. Nature, understood as the Aristotelian unsentient power that actualises the virtual dispositions of matter out of a teleological necessity, is once again rejected.4 In this case, too, the linchpin of Telesio's ethical doctrine is strikingly bold. It is based on the assumption that the spirit is aware of everything (omniscius omnino). In order to be up to its task of promoting the self-pres ervation of the universe, the spirit must perceive the nature and power of ali things, deduce the experiences and events it cannot perceive in a direct way, remember everything that has happened in the past and foresee future developments. It has the ability to react to every single thing and to adjust itself to the constantly changing conditions of the universe.5 One might say that the whole amount of knowledge and spirituous matter scattered in the universe is constantly affected by a powerful 'butterfly effect'. The omniscient sapientia inherent in nature represents the metaphysical foun dation of the universal condition of antiperistaltic reactivity. When Telesio says that everything in the universe has the ability to be affected (nihil enim apud nos impatibile est), he is attaching an active meaning to the word passio.6 Telesio is reversing Aristotle again: far ffom being a condition ontologically 1 Telesio, De rerum natura, ix, 5; ed. De Franco, ni, p. 352. 2 Ibidem. On Telesio's ethical naturalism, see F. W. Lupi, Π sublime secondo Telesio, in Atti del Convegno Internationale di Studi su Bernardino Telesio, cit., pp. 47-63. 3 Campanella, Senso delle cose 2007, pp. 108-109. 4 Telesio's notion of spirìtus omniscius as an expression of the inhérent sapientia of the uni verse is similar to Agostino Doni's concept of a primus sensus. See Doni, De natura hominis, Basel, Froben, 1581, f. 104: «Quam quidem sui ipsius statusque sui abditam in se intellectio nem esse quoque sensus, atque adeo primum sensum, iure opinor aliquis dicere posset, et ex intentione in sese fieri atque constare».

See Campanella, Senso delle cose, cit., p. 12 and especially p. 35, with référen cé to matter, («sendo passione il senso, e la materia nata a patire, è attissima a sentire») and p. 112 («chi è più passibile e molle, più è atto a sentire e diventar savio, e chi è duro manco paté e bisogno ha di sapienza»).</page><page sequence="13">THE FIRST OF THE MODERNS OR THE LAST OF THE ANCIENTS? 8l inferior to activity and actuality, the disposition to be affected is the real source of the life of the universe. Paradoxical as it may seem, Telesio's ethical views reinforce his thesis that ali naturai opérations postulate a condition of primordial awareness, for in the domain of ethics more than anywhere else, Telesio makes clear that the notion of nature présupposés, in fact, a fully developed consciousness, i.e., a truly omniscient power, capable of representing the whole universe, both in its spatial and its temporal dimensions. As an ethical power, even more than as a cosmological power and a physiological agent, nature proves to be a fully-fledged intentional and voluntary subject, a true 'self. 5- Nature's apparent autonomy in Aristotle's philosophy Telesio's De rerum natura provides a systematic account of the world, start ing from the original forces of the universe up to the most sublime deeds that make human nature the pinnacle of nature. It is a picture in which the progress of ethical life develops as a naturai conséquence from the life of the material spirit. For this reason, the concluding stages in Telesio's system of nature prove to be of decisive importance to understand better how bat tling forces of heat and cold operate.1 In Telesio's opinion, Aristotle's notion of nature shows ail its limitations when one examines his concept of motion. Aristotle claimed that motion represented «a kind of life for everything that is constituted by nature», a «deathless and never fadingproperty» belonging to ail things.2 What Telesio criticises of this notion of motion is that the underlying Aristotelian idea of nature as an internai principle of activity is, in fact, a contradictory concept. It is true that in Aristotle's philosophy nature is supposed to be a radically internai source of change; in fact, though, Aristotle ended up by defending the thesis that any change in the universe dérivés from something outside nature that does not belong to nature itself, and this in order to avoid the un welcome conséquence that the motion of nature, being intrinsically teleo logical, may derive from an internai and autonomous source of knowledge. Naturai motions are purposeful, but their directions do not dépend on the actual knowledge of the purposes possessed by the naturai agent, but on the inescapable tendency to be actualised that characterise ail nature beings. On the contrary, Telesio is firmly convinced that things are able to move precisely because from time to time they perceive and interact with other 1 Luigi De Franco rightly emphasised the revolutionary aspect of Telesio's ethical doc trines. See his La prima vera rivoluzione in filosofia: Bernardino Telesio, in Idem, Filosofia e sdenta in Calabria nei secoli xvi e xvn, Cosenza, Edizioni Periferia, 1988, p. 101. 2 Aristotle, Physica, vili, 1, 250b; tr. by P.

In other words, Telesio rules out the possibility that naturai motion may be separated from knowledge. Nat urai beings move not because of an impersonal and unintentional actualisa tion caused by external and unmovable forms (regardless of whether these forms are the naturai places in the case of inanimate beings or the soûls in the case of animate beings). Beings move (they move themselves, and are not moved by something else, Telesio reaffirms criticising Aristotles's solu tion as a merely verbal trick)1 because of and according to their perception of reality. It is because of this cognitive tendency that the iron is attracted to the magnet, i.e., because it feels such a similarity of nature between its heat and the heat of the magnet that it is able to overcome the heaviness of its constitution, «to which it normally succumbs if it is not stimulated by any desire». (The same thing happens when the spirits of the animais are aroused by vehement desires.)2 According to Aristotle, each element is characterized by the tendency to move towards its proper place and to remain at rest in that place once the motion is fully actualised. Everything that moves is moved by something else : the elements are moved by their respective naturai places, the senses by the sensed object, the animal by its environment and the very purpose of its action; the whole universe, finally, is moved by the unmovable mover. Telesio demonstrates that, by advocating such a view of naturai motion, Ar istotle necessarily reached the conclusion that «things that move in a naturai way are not moved by themselves and in virtue of their own nature, but as a resuit of another nature, distinct and separate from them».3 For Tele sio, Aristotle's thesis of nature as an internai principle of motion cannot be reconciled with his other thesis that everything that moves is moved by something else. The conséquence, Telesio concludes, is that Aristotle made the various «natures» and «forms» of things «inert and lazy».4 Havingbeen deprived of the knowledge of their purposes, naturai beings lose the spon taneity of their motions and the control over their actions. What is more - says Telesio adding a further objection - Aristotle reduced the motion of the naturai elements to an accidentai property by describing it sometimes as a conséquence of the so-called «generating principle» and some other times as a mechanical effect resulting fforn the release of a previous tension or fforn the removal of an obstacle.5 Telesio, De rerum natura, iv, 21 (ed. De Franco, 11, p. 139). Ibidem, iv, 23 (ed. De Franco, 11, p. 156). Ibidem, iv, 20 (ed. De Franco, 11, p. 130). Ibidem, iv, 20 (ed. De Franco, 11, pp. 132-134). Ibidem, iv, 20 (ed. De Franco, n, pp. 128-130).</page><page sequence="15">THE FIRST OF THE MODERNS OR THE LAST OF THE ANCIENTS? 83 By now, Telesio's criticai remarks directed at an Aristotelian universe populated with inactive naturai forms should not come as too much of a surprise. However, it is not only the assumption of an external source of motion that, in his opinion, looms large in the Aristotelian explanatory ffamework. On a broader level, it is the very existence of motion and the reality of activity to be threatened. In Aristotle's cosmology, ali elements reach their actuality, that is, their perfection, when they rest in their proper place: full activity is the activity of rest (and, in this respect, the ultimate perfection lie in the unmovable mover). By contrast, in Telesio's cosmology each active nature constantly pours out of its own boundaries and tries hard to invade the sphere of action of the other competing nature. In this case, perfection lies in a perpetually unresolved tension and not in actualized rest. While the unintentional teleology of nature that governs Aristotle's uni verse reflects the impersonal character of the unmovable mover, unrest and appetite are the very hallmark of Telesio's universe. There is, however, a further, deeper reason why Aristotle ruled out the possibility that naturai beings could be seen as self-movers. His argument was that there had to be a clear distinction between the 'moved' and the 'mover'. Likewise, naturai beings devoid of a sensitive soul were not able to perceive themselves and reach the level of sentient awareness, for the distinction between the perceiving subject and the perceived object, like the distinction between the moving and the moved being, presupposed the ontological différence between a state of potential change and its actualised form. In Aristotle's metaphysics of sublunar life, no naturai thing could be agent and patient at the same rime and in the same respect. As is well known, Aristotle argued that «in so far as it is a naturai unity, nothing is acted upon by itself; because it is one, and not a separate thing».1 Aristotle's nature was no self-moving, self-active, certainly no self-perceiving entity. Indeed, nature in Aristotelian terms was by définition unable to perceive, while sentience belonged to a différent ontological level. In the Aristotelian division of nat urai powers and souls, the motion of the elements towards their naturai places, the processes of nutrition, growth and reproduction, and finally the growth in sense awareness ffom the primordial manifestations of appetitive life represented three distinct degrees of actualisation which could not be bridged, nor could they overlap in any way. The fulfilment of the virtual dispositions of matter, the assimilation of the form of food and the ability to receive the form of perceived things without their matter were three dif férent stages in a process leading to increasing levels of disembodiment. It is true that, for Aristotle, perception, like naturai motion, was just another 1 Aristotle, Metaphysica, ιχ, ι, 1046a; tr. by H. Tredennick, Cambridge (Mass.), Harvard University Press, 1933, p. 431.</page><page sequence="16">84 GUIDO GIGLIONI instantiation of the unremitting actualisation of potentiality through which the life of the universe was constantly preserving itself. However, unlike naturai motion, perception presupposed an even more clear-cut division between the acting principle (i.e., the knowing form) and the acted upon substratum (i.e., the corporeal change brought about in the organ of per ception by the sensory material). To recapitulate, then, we might say that, whereas Aristotle explained ali naturai movements as a result of the unintentional process of actualisation pervading the universe, Telesio conflated the very notions of movement and perception by defending the existence of a naturai and sentient appetite of self-preservation in each part of the universe. By shifting the focus from nature to sentience, Telesio set out to dismantle the very foundations of the Aristotelian naturai world. He dramatically transformed the traditional catégories of nature and soul by introducing a notion of sentient selfhood that could be applied to both nature and man. Most of ali, by replacing the distinctively Aristotelian notion of unintentional teleology with a principle of sentient intentionality diffused everywhere in nature, Telesio rejected a deterministic view of naturai change based on the purposive (and yet unin tentional) fulfilment of naturai potentialities. Instead, he introduced a more flexible picture of the physical universe in which the ability to survive and adapt to a world ruled by forms of vital expansions could escape the pres sure of a teleologica! pian. 6. Conclusion Eager to présent Telesio as the herald of new developments in the field of seventeenth-century physics (and maybe led astray by Bacons own mod ernist rhetoric), historians of early modem philosophy have in the past downplayed the rôle that naturai sentience plays in Telesio's view of nature or have dismissed the very notion of naturai sentience as a residue of out moded animism.1 However, if we want to understand the original charac ter of Telesio's position, we cannot pass over his theory of an all-sentient spirit (spiritus omniscius omnino) or ignore those passages in which he unam biguously vindicates the existence of sense and appetite in naturai beings. Modem explanations of heat and matter have often come to the rescue of historians who feel uncomfortable with Telesio's omniscient spirit. Other interpreters have pointed to his defence of knowledge through the senses as a manifesto of modem empiricism. By rediscovering nature and the sens es, some have argued, Telesio prefigured the movement towards objective 1 G. Saitta, η pensiero italiano nell'umanesimo e nel rinascimento, Florence, Sansoni, 1961, in, p. 11; P. O.

The tech nical meaning of nature, so to speak, stili referred, first and foremost, to the Aristotelian internai source of motion and unsentient principle of order. Such a principle represented the defining characteristic of Aristotle's natu ralism, différent ffom both the Democritean concept of material necessity and the Platonic notion of self-motion. No doubt, the long sériés of inter preters who through the centuries espoused Aristotle's model of naturai philosophy testifies to the explanatory success of the Aristotelian notion of unintentional teleology over Democritus' non-purposive determinism and Plato's intentional teleology. Theoretically speaking, though, the Aristote lian notion of nature suffered ffom an ineliminable residue of Platonism, in that ali naturai beings, in their irrésistible tendency to be actualized by the form, appeared to be drawn to a principle that in the end transcended nature itself, regardless of whether that principle was the unmoveable mov er, the pure actuality of the ultimate form or the active intellect. Put in a nutshell, the actions of nature were supposed to terminate in something other than nature itself. Telesio challenged this view on two levels: first, he dismissed the notion of nature as an unconscious source of activity by em phasizing instead its fully sentient character; second, he demonstrated that the view of unintentional finalism was a pure abstraction of the intellect, for nature could not be regarded as occupying an autonomous sphere of activity without adding the decisive qualification that it has to be aware of its ends and purposes. 1 The ghost of Newton hovers over the interprétations of Ernst Cassirer (Dos Erkenntni sproblem in der Philosophie und Wissenschaft der neuren Ζeit, Berlin, Bruno Cassirer, 1911-1920, 1, pp. 232-240), Ρ. Ο. Kristeller (Eight Philosophers of the Italian Renaissance, cit., pp. 103-105), Giuseppe Martano (La "svolta" telesiana nella storia dei concetti di spazio e tempo, in Bernardino Telesio nel 4 0 centenario della morte (1588), Naples, Istituto Nazionale di Studi sul Rinascimento Meridionale, 1989, pp. 71-101), Karl Schuhmann (Le concept d'espace cheç Telesio, in Bernardino Telesio e la cultura napoletana, cit., pp. 141-167). I tend to believe that Telesio's idea of space as a substantial disposition to receive and contain ali naturai things is the distinguishing trait of an all-sentient cosmos rather than an anticipation of the Newtonian notion of objective space. See Tommaso Cornelio, De circumpulsione Platonica, in Progymnasmata physica, Venice, F. Baba, 1663, p. 322: «Bernardinus Telesius [...] ratus est posse in rerum natura existere spatium omnis corporeae substantiae expers atque ideo prorsus inane, quanquam id non sine vi co natuque aliquo fieri posse contendit». 2 Telesio, De rerum natura, 1, 'Proemium' (ed. De Franco, 1, p. 28).</page><page sequence="18">86 GUIDO GIGLIONI However, by replacing the Peripatetic notion of unintentional teleol ogy with the concept of universal sentience, Telesio inevitably exposed himself to charges of animism and anthropomorphism. In De rerum natu ra, he described the spirit as being «most clever» (prudentissimus) in ali its performances, acting as a fully developed self.1 On an even broader level, the programme of explaining nature through itself incurred in a funda mental contradiction: if it is true that Telesio endowed nature with the power to justify and explain itself (iuxta propria principia), so much so that even the human mind could be seen as a by-product of nature, neverthe less, the way he characterised nature's opérations was too similar to the way one would have explained the actions of human beings. If this is the case, then we would have to agree with the classic objection put forward by Giovanni Gentile and Ernst Cassirer (for ali their différences), i.e., that Telesio was unable to disentangle himself from the persistent and insidi ous traps of premodern animism.2 Or maybe, what at first looks like a contradiction between a robust affirmation of the autonomy of nature and a tendency to subject nature to the dictâtes of human consciousness is, in fact, a new way of understanding knowledge, both the knowledge that nature has of itself and the knowledge that man has of nature. Tele sio wrote on nature according to its principles, that is to say, not following his principles - meaning Telesio's mind - and not even following her prin ciples, meaning nature as a personified agent. For Telesio, the point is not that naturai beings act as human beings; on the contrary, human beings act as naturai beings even when they display the loftiest expressions of abstract thought or sublime deeds of heroism.3 Telesio's aim was to dem onstrate that man, despite being endowed with the faculties of intellect and will, remained an integrai part of the life of nature. As Antonio Per sio pointed out correctly in his defence of Telesio, the sentient power of 1 Telesio, Quod animal universum ab unica animae substantia gubernatur, in Vani de natura lisas rebus libelli, cit., p. 216. 2 According to Giovanni Gentile (Bernardino Telesio, now in I problemi della scolastica e il pensiero italiano (Opere, xn), Florence, Sansoni, 1963, p. 133-206), within the context of the gen eral history of philosophy, Telesio's naturalism represented the initial stage in the history of human consciousness. According to Cassirer, Telesio's tendency to empirical descriptions of nature could have become part of the new scientifìc view of nature if, instead of falling back into animism «in its primitive forms», such a tendency had moved towards mathematical idealism (Individuum und Kosmos in der Philosophie der Renaissance, Darmstadt, Wissenschaftli che Buchgeselleschaft, 1963, p. 156; Dos Erkenntnisproblem, cit., 1, pp. 232-240). On Cassirer's reading of Telesio, see G. Raio, Telesio e la filosofia della natura in Cassirer, in Bernardino Telesio e la cultura napoletana, cit., pp. 431-443. 3 In Telesio's view, heroic virtues, even the sacrifice of one's own fife, have always a prag matic motive and they ali fall within the universe's tendency to self-preservation.

These domains correspond to the metaphysical, the ethico-physiologi cal and the epistemological aspects of sentience (sensus). The metaphysical meaning of sensus refers to the original discerning motions of pursuit and avoidance manifested by the active natures, heat and cold.2 The physiologi cal meaning of sensus is related to the spirit's ability to 'sense' its surround ing reality - the actual act of sensation with ali its psychological and ethi cal implications - and it has the certainty and immediacy that reason and intellect lack.3 Finally, the epistemological meaning of sensus dérivés irom the view of sense perception as a canon of intelligibility and a paragon of sound knowledge.4 Since the three domains - the metaphysical, the ethico physiological and the epistemological - represent three stages in the unfold ing of one sentient power throughout the universe, man's knowledge can be seen as a constant re-enactment of the primordial sentience of nature, while his ethical life stands out as a naturai expression of the spirit's activity to adapt to the world. Sentience, the senses and sense knowledge are mani festations of the same life of nature, i.e., sensus. 1 A.
