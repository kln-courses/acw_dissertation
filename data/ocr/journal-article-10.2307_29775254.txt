<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Last Ape: Pygmy Chimpanzee Be? havior and Ecology. Takayoshi Kano. Evelyn Ono Vineberg, trans. 248 pp. Stanford University Press, 1992. $45. The last great ape species to be de? scribed by science was the pygmy chim? panzee, or bonobo, and to date there exist only two field sites in Zaire where this ge? ographically restricted and extremely en dangered species has been studied (com? pared to several dozen sites where com? mon chimpanzees have been studied). One site, Lomako, is familiar to English speaking specialists because of the increas? ing number of articles by several Ameri? can primatologists who have worked there recently (R. Susman, F. White, R. Malenky and N. Thompson-Handler). The other site, Wamba, has been used almost exclu? sively by Japanese investigators and is less well known, in large part because of the language barrier between the Japanese and English-speaking scientists. This bar? rier has been partially bridged by the valiant efforts of Japanese investigators to write and publish in English. Thus, this competent translation of a major synthesis of research at the Wamba site is a welcome addition to the literature. This well-illustrated volume presents an overview of the history, rationale and current status of field research on pygmy chimpanzee behavior and ecology (as of 1986, when the Japanese version was published). In part because it was written for a broad scientific and lay audience and in part because of cultural differences in scientific style, the author often uses anthropomorphisms and human analo? gies to chimpanzee behavior that are less acceptable in modern English-speaking journals but that enliven the text and make it entertaining. The highlights of pygmy chimpanzee behavior as revealed in this provisioned population are its rel? atively stable multifemale groups and the intricate sexual politics practiced by fe? males toward males and other females. The stable (for several weeks) groups of reproductive females stand in stark con? trast to most common chimpanzee popu? lations studied, whether provisioned or not, where females with young offspring typically forage in isolation from other adult females. Pygmy chimpanzee multi female groups exist even though the fe? males in them are not closely related?fe? male emigration from their natal group appears to be as invariant as in the com? mon chimpanzee. Takayoshi Kano as? cribes the difference between the two chimpanzee species to the difference in the dispersion of their food trees: Pygmy chimpanzees suffer less food competition because they typically use larger-crowned and more productive fruit trees than do common chimpanzees. Food competition still exists, however, es? pecially over clumped rich sources of food such as the sugar canes used for provision? ing, and female pygmy chimpanzees have emphasized the use of sexual behavior as an apparent appeasement mechanism to re? duce social tensions. When used with males, female sexual presentation is usually fol? lowed closely by the male's sharing of con? tested food sources. When used among fe? males, genital-genital rubbing appears to allow females to feed in dose proximity from rich food sources. The benefits of reduced aggression over food assodated with sexual behavior have apparently caused pygmy fe? males to have greatly increased periods of sexual receptivity compared to common chimpanzees; indeed, the only primate with longer periods of female sexual receptivity is our own spedes. Although many of the pgymy chimps' social behaviors and the Japanese investigators' interpretations of them have since been published indepen? dently by American investigators studying unprovisioned pygmy chimpanzees at Lo mako, the original (Japanese) version of this book was the first detailed and comprehen? sive account of most of the observations and interpretations. For specialists, the book has some dis? tinct idiosyncracies. First, the study meth? ods are not described for most chapters, so that it is impossible to know how sys? tematic, complete or representative the data are without looking at the original journal articles (and sometimes not even then). Second, the cultural bias inherent in almost any scientific study is perhaps more apparent because Kano's culture is not Western. Explanations for most be? haviors focus far more on psychological than on sociobiological principles, despite the author's evident interest in exploring the evolution of human behavior pat? terns. Many specialists might prefer a book less anthropomorphic and more de? tailed and documented. Nonetheless, this is the only English source for many of the data presented and thus will be indis? pensable to the serious student of chim? panzee behavior.?Charles H.
