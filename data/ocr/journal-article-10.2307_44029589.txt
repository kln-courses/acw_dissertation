<plain_text><page sequence="1">This essay proposes a new reading of the relation between deconstruction and psychoanalysis. Rejecting the terms of the previous confrontations between the positions of Derrida and Lacan, the essay seeks to show how the scope of what Derrida proposed under the title of grammatology can be extended beyond the limits of the "Freudian impression" and provide a key to understanding the complex topological notions Lacan developed in his later years.

It should suffice to refer to the programmatic statements Derrida himself offered on the "science of grammatology," as well as the conflicting, contrary answers Freud and Lacan gave to the question of the possibility of a discourse of the unconscious - only in the genitivus obiectivus : as the unconscious itself is not a discourse. In what follows, I hope to show that (1) the concept of the unconscious is to be understood as a gram- matological concept, and (2) that, once developed, a grammatological concept of the unconscious is not limited to what Derrida himself interpreted under the heading of a "Freudian impression." The main argument is that the power of what Derrida had developed from Writing and Difference and Of Grammatology onwards, while unthink- able outside its connections with Freud, can and must be conceived of beyond the Mosaic 44/3 0027- 1276-07/1 470 16$02.00©Mosaic</page><page sequence="2">148 Mosaic 44/3 (September 2011 ) Freudian "scene of writing." This is what I take to be the contribution of rereading Derrida with Lacan. I hope it will be equally clear, however, that this is not tantamount to a rejection, or even a critique, of Derridas readings of psychoanalysis, whether of Freud or of Lacan. In fact, it is quite the opposite, as I maintain that Derridas decon- struction of the metaphysical commitments of Freud's "Copernican" turn already results in a certain unboundedness of psychoanalysis itself, precisely by virtue of the power of grammatology. Ultimately, the measure of this rereading of Derrida and Lacan will be the resistance to this dual temptation of synthesis and critique. We shall begin by addressing some major obstacles to the interpretation I am putting forward. There are at least three: First, there is Derridas insistence, to be found in its most explicit form already in "Freud and the Scene of Writing," that "despite appearances, the deconstruction of logocentrism is not a psychoanalysis of philosophy" (196). This is "despite appearances," since deconstruction does indeed advance and insist not only on a concept of repression, namely the thesis of a repres- sion of writing, but also, through the articulation of the logic of the trace, which, anal- ogous to the Freudian Urverdrängung (primary/original repression), is refused the status of a concept but whose "very structure [...] makes possible, as the movement of temporalization and pure auto-affection , something that can be called repression in general, the original synthesis of original repression and secondary repression, repres- sion 'itself " ("Freud" 230). 1 Here, the question of the relationship between decon- struction and psychoanalysis already finds itself organized around the thinking of temporality that Derrida considers inaugurated with Freud, and that crystallizes in the notion of the "compulsion to repeat" ( Wiederholungszwang ). Providing a new, or indeed a first, philosophical interpretation of this Freudian concept dominates all of Derridas engagement with psychoanalysis and explains the central role played by a limited number of Freud's texts, above all Beyond the Pleasure Principle. The second obstacle concerns the difficulties concerning the textual basis for the encounter between Derrida and Lacan. These difficulties are not simply of a philo- logical nature. On the one hand, there is Le facteur de la vérité, first published in 1975, often traded as Derrida's canonical deconstruction of Lacan. This text, a reading of Lacan's 1956 Seminar on Poes Purloined Letter that concludes the highly complex tex- tual assemblage of The Post Cardy inscribes Lacan into the pre-established framework of the earlier reading of Freud, and results in the well-known neologistic denuncia- tion of phallogocentrism. Then there are the discussions of Lacan's notion of the sym- bolic in the 1971 interview with Jean-Louis Houdebine and Guy Scarpette, later published in Positions. Also, some clear references to Lacanian concepts, though not by way of the proper name, can be discerned in Dissemination. All of these texts, we</page><page sequence="3">Henrik S. Wilberg 149 should recall, deal with Lacan's thought as presented in Écrits , published in 1966. In Facteur de la vérité in particular, the apparent privilege Lacan himself accorded to the seminar on Poe serves to legitimate the pars pro toto approach. Still, the reader can discern a certain unease with this self-restrictive approach in the barrage of footnotes towards the end of Facteur de la vérité , where the references to other texts by Lacan suddenly multiply. Finally, as a decidedly odd text in this set, there is the much more recent intervention at a Lacan symposium in 1991, entitled Pour V amour de Lacan , subsequently republished in Resistances.2 On the other hand, there is only one refer- ence to Derrida in the entirety of Lacan's work, published and unpublished: a rather malicious remark ("je le crois en analyse") made in Seminar XIX, Ou pire. ... This remark soon found the ears of Derrida, despite being promptly left out in the institutionally sanctioned summary later published in the journal of the École freudienne, Scilicet 5. The third obstacle is arguably the most important, but it is also much less straight- forward. It originates in the development of the "question of the archive" as an explicit development of Derrida's earlier reading of the Freudian topic of the psyche in "Freud and the Scene of Writing." In Archive Fever , Derrida seeks to show that what Freud pre- sented as a topic of retention and an account of memory is not contained and exhausted by this function, but, in what is essentially a rupture, organizes an entire topology of interiority and exteriority. It does so not only as a condition for psychic activity, but as the institution of the hypomnemic apparatus that does not dissolve itself into either the mnéme or the anamnesis. According to Derrida, what the Freudian topic of the psyche is supposed to achieve is already the mark of the institution as such : Ce « Bloc magique », ce modèle extérieur, donc archival, de l'appareil psychique d'enreg- istrement et de mémorisation n'intègre pas seulement les concepts inauguraux de la psy- chanalyse, depuis l'Esquisse jusqu'aux articles de la Métapsychologie , en passant par la Traumdeutung, , en particulier tous ceux qui concernent par exemple le refoulement, la cen- sure, l'enregistrement ( Niederschrift ) dans les deux systèmes ICS et PCS, les trois points de vue topique, dynamique et économique. En tenant compte de la multiplicité des lieux dans l'appareil psychique, il intègre aussi, au-dedans de iapsukhé même, la nécessité d'un certain dehors, de certaines frontières entre du dedans et du dehors. Et avec ce dehors domestique , c'est-à-dire aussi avec l'hypothèse d'un support, d'une surface ou d'un espace internes sans lesquels il n'y a ni consignation, enregistrement ou impression, ni répression, censure ou refoulement, il accueille l'idée d'une archive psychique distincte de la mémoire spontanée, d'une hupómnésis distincte de la mnéme de Vanámnésis : l'institution, en somme, d'une prothèse du dedans. Nous disons « institution » (on pourrait dire « érection ») pour mar- quer, dès le seuil originaire de cette prothèse, une rupture tout aussi originaire avec la nature. La théorie de la psychanalyse devient alors une théorie de l'archive et non seulement une théorie de la mémoire. (Derrida, Mal 37-38)</page><page sequence="4">150 Mosaic 44/3 (September 2011 ) The entire complex of archivization, preservation, and transmission, which in "Freud and the Scene of Writing" was treated almost exclusively under the sway of the conceptual apparatus of Of Gramma tology, is now being analyzed primarily from that beyond of the pleasure principle that only gains prominence in the later texts of the Freudian corpus, such as Moses and Monotheism. What these later interventions have in view, as already announced by the discussion of lifedeath (la vie la mort) in Spéculer-Sur Freud (Derrida, Post 259) is a certain - impossible - affirmation of the death-drive, which can only take the shape of a double bindy rather than the earlier deconstruction of the scene of original inscription viz. repression. This third obstacle begins to gain shape when we couple this with the exigency - both theoretical and ethical - of resistance , put forward by Derrida in the essay by the same name. Here, the trope of resistance is applied by Derrida as much in the name of as against psychoanalysis. The text activates the Lacanian trope of "resistance to the resisters" - " résistance aux résistants " (Lacan, "La Chose" 418) - not just an abused notion of the discourse of the analyst (one recalls here Freud's acknowledgment of the "heads I win, tails you lose" problem at the heart of the concept of resistance). Derrida speaks in the name of another resistance, one that repeats the structural argument of Archive Fever. This time, however, it is applied more widely to the contemporary ques- tion of "what to do with analysis," and specifically to the love of, and /or, Lacan: "I con- sider it an act of cultural resistance to pay homage publicly to thought, discourse, writing, which is difficult and does not lend itself easily to normalization by media, academe, or publishing, is refractory to the restoration presently in progress, and to philosophical or theoretical neoconformism in general [...] which levels everything around us, in the attempt to make us forget what the Lacan era was, along with the future and promise of his thought, thus erasing the name of Lacan" (Derrida, "Pour l'amour" 64, emph. mine). Can one deny that the actuality of the exigency of resistance persists and imposes itself, perhaps even more so than twenty years ago, when these phrases were uttered? This is not a historicist, or even an historical, argument. It is not a question of history, but a question of dusk. As is demonstrated by the publication of Benoît Peeterss biog- raphy of Derrida3 (meticulously researched, written by someone with the necessary credentials, sanctioned by a good press - all the characteristics listed by Derrida him- self), we are witnessing, at the end of deconstruction's long march through the (American) institutions, a crepuscular taking-shape of the period of thought that sailed under the flag of "post-structuralism." The proper names persist, of course, but the mere preservation of the name is no guarantee against forgetting; it is perfectly compatible with the continued groundswell of the conformism and restoration</page><page sequence="5">Henrik S. Wilberg 151 Derrida wished to resist with his declaration of "love of Lacan." To remain for a moment within the Hegelian imagery of dusk: dusk is not the equivalent of a moment within history. Dusk, as it is famously presented in the preface to Hegel's Principles of the Philosophy of Right, is not historical, but the time of the incongruence of history and thinking. It is ultimately impossible to determine whether the present is the dusk at which Minerva takes flight or the melancholic descent into the night in which all cows are black, that is, of true m -difference.4 Part of the task, then, is to put the archival question to deconstruction itself, to allow it to appear historically if only in order to raise its proper problematic of trans- mission. Unsurprisingly, this question had begun insisting from the earliest texts Derrida produced, as this passage from "Différance" demonstrates: "I wish to under- line that the efficacity of the thematic of dijférance may very well, indeed must, one day be superseded, lending itself if not to its own replacement, at least to enmeshing itself in a chain that in truth it never will have governed" (7). This, however, is not to be confused with an echo of Freud's expectation and desire that his name be erased and forgotten in order to give life to psychoanalysis as a scientific discourse. It has even less to do with a vulgar and quasi-historical notion of "overcoming" deconstruction. If resistance here does call for a certain supersession of the "efficacity of the thematic of difference ," acknowledging and entering into the dusk of deconstruction does not mean consigning it to the enclosed space of an epoch, reverting to pre- or non-deconstructive modes of, just to name two phenomena among many, classical-philological hermeneutics and decidedly feverless, anti-inflam- matory archival work (a return to a "literature speaking for itself") or what I would not hesitate to call certain new philosophical ontologies of resentment. The real exigency is twofold: on the one hand, resistance to the transformation of deconstruction into a dispositif that is, it reasserts the incompatibility of Derrida's work with the repressive framework Lacan formalized as the "Discourse of the University." (It is worth keeping in mind that, in his theory of discourses, Lacan sees the repressive discourse not as the discourse of the master, but as the discourse of the university, a discourse that pre- cludes both the position of resistance, be it hysterical or analytical, and that of the mas- ter.) On the other hand, then, as Catherine Malabou has argued recently, it is necessary to assume a responsibility of invention, which is in fact a responsibility for changing difference. The first step of this invention can only be accomplished by "refuser de répéter ou de pasticher un geste qui ne peut plus produire de difference [refusing to repeat or pastiche a gesture which no longer produces difference] " (Malabou 79). This is the field of intervention where a reconsideration of the relation between the works of Derrida and Lacan has become necessary, and from which a grammatological concept of the unconscious can be constructed.</page><page sequence="6">152 Mosaic 4 4 /3 ( September 2011) I have unconscious. already sketched In order to out alleviate the difficulties them somewhat, facing a grammatological I will permit myself concept to argue of the the unconscious. In order to alleviate them somewhat, I will permit myself to argue the following, namely, that Of Grammatology, a large section of the texts contained in Writing and Difference and Margins of Philosophy, and at least up until and including Dissemination , can be read as giving a systematic answer (which is not the same as the answer of a system) to a fundamental question, a question that Derrida gives its "unary trait" by repeatedly aligning it with what he considers the question of meta- physics "itself." In these texts, the local question of one particular thinker, be it Husserl, Plato, Austin, Artaud, or his contemporary Foucault, is raised to the dignity of a deconstruction of metaphysics. I would argue that this is the reason why it is not wrong to consider this part of Derrida's work as inaugurating, or at least co-found- ing, a poststructuralist program. The question of metaphysics was only interrogated anew, that is, given a genuinely novel philosophical form, with the high tide of struc- turalism. We are tempted to paraphrase the question as follows: how can (material) content be attributed to a synchronic system of purely differential relations; and how is one to think the passage from (virtual) differentiation to (actual) articulation? This is what led Gilles Deleuze to answer the question, what is structuralism? with "a new transcendental philosophy" (See Deleuze). Here it is also possible to glimpse why psy- choanalysis came to play such a pivotal role for Derrida in these texts. It should be acknowledged that this is the very same question that lies at the heart of what Freud understood analysis to mean. At the same time, analysis requires an exposition of the functions of Vorstellungsrepräsentanz , that is, the transformation and translation of unconscious to conscious representation, the passage from latent to manifest dream content, in short, the parameters of the dreamwork and the subjection of this "tran- scendental" problem to the absolute novelty of the talking cure, that of how it is pos- sible that meaning, through its production and enunciation, can produce effects in "the Real." Freud considered this the only possible proof of the existence of the unconscious, and attempted to give a theoretical treatment of it in the metapsycho- logical writings. In the end, both Lacan's and Derridas treatments of Freud are inquiries into the Freudian metapsychology and its place in the philosophical tradi- tion, as well as the viability of analysis as a discourse absolutely different from the same tradition. At roughly the same time, three paradigmatic solutions were on offer: Jacques Lacan's logic of the signifier, Gilles Deleuze's logic of sense (with the programmatical alias "transcendental empiricism"), and Jacques Derrida's grammatology. What unites these projects is a fidelity to the three Copernican revolutions of modern thought: Kant's transcendental turn; the "linguistic," viz. semio-logical or semiotic, turn (depend-</page><page sequence="7">Henrik S. Wilberg 153 ing on whether one credits Saussure or Pierce); and Freud's discovery of the uncon- scious. The singularity of each project lies in its claim to simultaneously think these revolutions to their end. In doing so each - in a paradigmatic manner - departs from one of the three "turns" as the condition of possibility for the two others. From this fidelity, both a radical critique and a real transformation emerge.5 As is well known since Le facteur de la vérité , these diverging responses to the question framed anew by structuralism, which is identical to the question of struc- turalism, is also the very source of their incompatibility. It is Lacan's transformation of the Freudian metapsychology into the logic of the signifier that serves as a point of departure for Derrida's exceptional critique. It is not very difficult to superficially trace the philosophical differences between Derrida and Lacan at the time to the lat- terà complicity with Alexandre Kojève's anthropomorphic Hegelian phenomenology and the equally explicit Heideggerianism: "À partir de ce chiasme qui faisait du dis- cours de Lacan un discours trop en confiance avec les philosophes et avec Heidegger [...] je ne pouvais, moi, être avec Lacan comme un philosophe serait avec un psych- analyste" (Derrida, "Pour l'amour" 75). And, in a particularly scornful remark, Derrida suggests that Lacan is essentially proposing that "what 'Freud tells us' very lit- erally would be What Is Metaphysics?"' (Derrida, Post 477n54). Nor would we be able to complete our task were we to embark on an exhaustive exegesis of Derrida's read- ing of Lacan. Nevertheless, we should at least remind ourselves of the central motives of Derrida's criticism, both in the "direct" form, as in the Positions interview and Le facteur de la vérité, as well as in the later corrections that surface twenty years later in For the Love of Lacan. The motives are known: first, the arrival versus the non-arrival of Poe's purloined letter, the reaching or not of a destination, the question of its proper and circular trajectory. Second, there is the supposed indivisibility of the let- ter, its purported remaining-the-same for the completion of its itinerary. There are others too, which in hindsight seem a lot less pertinent, like the alleged failure to take the literary function of narration, which in turn introduces a long tangent of praise of Marie Bonaparte's reading at the expense of Lacan's, which does nothing but par- ody, I think, the malicious surplus - the other letter - of the position of the analyst reflected in the final action of Poe's character Dupin. The optic opened up by dissemination then goes on to reveal these two sides of Lacan's presentation as intimately linked. In fact, Lacan's entire topology, the "system of the symbolic," as Derrida refers to it here, is seen as a protection from the menace of dissemination, which "designates that which can no more be integrated into the symbolic than it can form the symbolic's simple exterior under the heading of its failure or its (imaginary or real) impossibility" (Derrida, "Interview" 70). For The</page><page sequence="8">154 Mosaic 44/3 (September 2011 ) Purloined Letter ; this means "not that the letter never arrives at its destination, but it belongs to the structure of the letter to be capable, always, of not arriving. And with- out this threat [...] the circuit of the letter would not even have begun" (Derrida, Post 444). In a sense, things could not be clearer: no movement, and above all no analysis, without the generic menace of dissemination. We should take care to note that the introduction of dissemination is that of a modality, of an always being able to not arrive, that is, of contingencyy or to be precise, a necessity of contingent Derrida's read- ing is formidable. Lacans presentation is indeed dependent on the unity of the signi- fier (as a subject for another signifier, as the doctrine goes) and on the transmissibility of the letter. There is a clear problem with Derrida's reading, however: "This story," Derrida writes, "is certainly that of a letter, of the theft and displacement of a signi- fier" ( Post 427). And a few pages on, Derrida repeats: "For the signifier-letter, in the topology and psychoanalytico-transcendental semantics with which we are dealing, has a proper place and meaning which form the condition, origin, and destination of the entire circulation, as of the entire logic of the signifier" (437). This is true, but on one condition: that the letter is not the signifier. That this distinction is not made is a little surprising, especially considering the fact that this text was first published two years after Jean-Luc Nancy and Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe's The Title of the Letter ; a text that employs the separation of the signifier and the letter in Lacan's work as its opening gambit (See Lacoue-Labarthe and Nancy). Also available at the time was Lacan's Seminar XX : Encoref which contains the doctrine of the letter in its most developed form. A possible explanation is that Nancy and Lacoue-Labarthe based their reading entirely on The Instance of the Letter in the Unconscious , whereas Derrida - taking up a suggestion from Lacan - clearly considered The Seminar on the Purloined Letter the most important text in the Écrits . In this, of course, Derrida echoes none other than Lacan himself; the Écrits are in chronological order except for this text, which is given the privilege of opening the collection. The reason turns out to be much simpler, as described by Benoît Peeters in his biography. Le facteur de la vérité in fact predates The Title of the Letter, whose prior publication seems to have been a cause for some anxiety in Derrida, leading him to take the unusual step of seeking Nancy and Lacoue-Labarthe's approval prior to publication (Peeters). Why should we insist on this point? Let us quickly recall some elements of the Lacanian doctrine. The signifier is absolutely negative; it is what all other signifiers are not. It is pure difference in the symbolic field, whereas the letter is of a positive order (Milner 128-32). This is already the heart of the matter, the same question raised by the talking cure: how a system of negative differentiation can produce an effect in the real, that is, one which is not purely negative, "La lettre radicalement est effet de</page><page sequence="9">Henrik S. Wilberg 155 discours" (Lacan, Séminaire XX: 36). One could say, very concisely, that the letter is that which makes a difference where there is no(-o)ne.6 From this follows that the sig- nifier is restricted to the symbolic, whereas the letter ties it to the two other registers, the I and the R, completing its nodal structure. Also, within the framework of The Purloined Letter, there is not simply differentiation of positions but actual transfor- mative acts, in this case the (at least) two cases of theft. The letter is transmissible , as the signifier qua signifier cannot transmit anything. Once attuned to this question, one can even sense occasionally a lack of conviction sneaking into Derrida's reading: "a milieu of ideality: hence the eminence of the transcendental whose effect is to maintain presence, to wit phoné. This is what made necessary and possible, in exchange for certain corrections, the integration of Freudian phallocentrism with a fundamentally phonocentric Saussurian semiolinguistics. The * algorithmic ' transfor- mation does not appear to me to undo this tie" (Derrida, Post 478n56). The "algorith- mic" transformation, of which Derrida speaks here, and which does not appear to undo the phallo/phonocentric tie, is already a consideration of later developments in Lacan's work. The algorithmic transformation does in fact not take place in the Seminar on the Purloined Letter (though there is a formalization of the odd/even game in the accompanying "Suite" - which Derrida chooses not to discuss), although it is doubtless part of the nascent programmatic of the Lacanian matheme. And later, in "Pour l'amour de Lacan," Derrida ultimately denies that Le Facteur de la vérité aimed at one final deconstruction of the one Lacanian discourse, and refuses to pass the judg- ment of phonocentrism on Lacan's idea of the matheme , his "mathematical" rewriting of psychoanalysis. Heuristically, as has been suggested by Jean-Claude Milner, one can claim that the transformation of Lacan's work takes the form of two "classicisms," where the first one - designated by the formula "the unconscious is structured like a language" - effectuates a return to Freud by way of a Kojèvian dialectics of desire, Heideggerian questionings of logos and truth, and Saussurian linguistics; whereas the second classi- cism is almost entirely dominated by the exigencies of the matheme. While the first classicism is represented by the texts collected in Écrits , the second classicism is only accessible through later publications, predominantly in the house journal Scilicet. The only one of these texts widely available in English is Seminar XX: Encore. Though some of this thought has found an audience through the select elements that have found their way into the work of Alain Badiou, it is only now being approached in the systematic fashion it clearly demands. This, though, cannot be explored further here. Regarding Derrida, there can be no point in simply underlining a possible mis- reading in Le facteur de la vérité, however rare and noteworthy such an occasion might</page><page sequence="10">156 Mosaic 44/3 (September 2011 ) be. We only move beyond Derrida's reading as far as it itself risks obscuring other wide-reaching consequence of his own project of deconstruction. There is a precedent here of such a "misreading" of Derrida's, his so-called introduction to Hegelian semi- ology, "The Pit and the Pyramid." The problem with the Hegel reading is that it set- tles all too easily on deconstructing Hegel's actual and literal account of the sign and writing of human beings in the Anthropology section of the Encyclopedia , rather than going for the much greater prize, namely how the grammatological principle is oper- ative at the heart of the Science of Logic itself. Derrida's Hegelian semiology should have begun with the concept of the concept (der Begriff des Begriffs)7 (Derrida, "Pit"). But rather than faulting this in Derrida's reading, we should attempt to use this as a chance to rewrite the relation of deconstruction in the hope of establishing not a dif- ferent deconstruction, but a different Hegel than the officially deconstructed one. That this is possible is evidenced by Derrida's preface to Catherine Malabou's The Future of Hegel Once we have realized that the confrontation of Derrida and Lacan on the basis of the arrival and non-arrival of the letter is a dead end, we are one step closer to our goal: that there is a grammatological concept of the unconscious. It takes place in the rewriting of writing. A placement grammatological of the concept point of of contact the unconscious between Lacan begins and to take Derrida shape from by way these of ques- a dis- placement of the point of contact between Lacan and Derrida from these ques- tions regarding the letter to the concept of writing. Two elements show themselves as favourable to the displacement I am suggesting. The first is the assertion of Derrida's in "Pour l'amour de Lacan" that one can discern a heightened sensibility towards, and even an overturning of, phonocentrism in Lacan's later work, notable in the seminar Encore. While stopping short of calling this a complete turn, this development is, according to Derrida, performed " très grammato-logiquemenť ("very grammatolog- ically") ("Pour l'amour" 79). In short, both Lacan and Derrida realize - and this not entirely independent of each other - a rewriting of writing. If we recall the extraordi- nary third, and now perhaps the most dated, chapter of Of Grammatology, titled "Grammatology as a Positive Science," Derrida invokes a "generalized grammatology" in the place of Saussure's own projection of a generalized semiology, all the while acknowledging and inscribing in the idea of this science to come a certain impossi- bility a priori. This impossibility originates in the ex-centric position writing is shown to take up vis-à-vis science - grammatology will not be a science among other sci- ences. As Derrida puts it himself, "elle risque en effet d'ébranler aussi le concept de la science" (Derrida, De la grammatologie 109). In a slight approximation we could say that Derrida's "science of grammatology" receives its problematic structure from a</page><page sequence="11">Henrik S. Wilberg 157 generic re-writing of the origin of writing, whereas Lacan's idea, though no less generic, finds its support in writing's incompleteness. The second element indicating our displacement is merely an extension of this, namely the way in which Lacan himself is oriented towards the limits of science. The problematic of the letter already points towards Lacan's idea of writing: that of the algorithm. Here, Lacan is at a distance from the models of writing Derrida is taking on in Of Grammatology. First of all, there is no secondary hypomnemic character to writing in Lacan. For Lacan, writing is synonymous with formalization - and he gives his formalizations the name of matheme. It should be pointed out, however, that the literal operation Lacan refers to is not the same as the "algebraic" writing attributed to Leibniz's caracterica universalis in Of Grammatology (which, it should be remem- bered, exonerates Leibniz on the charge of phonocentrism, but still falls under the general problem of writing). Lacan takes up a different position from Leibniz due to his reflection of the problem of logical universalism, that is, the fact that a truth- semantics for any given language cannot be formulated in that language (according to Tarskis truth definition). Lacan in fact seeks to negate precisely the "universal" char- acter of the mathematical transmission, while affirming a partial truth ex-centric to the universalist paradigm. In other words, Lacan speaks in breach of Wittgenstein's injunction to remain silent. The explicit aim is an ideal, that of exactitude. But, just as Lacan's concept of writing is not the hypomnemic one of Plato's Phaedrus , the mathematical idea does not correspond to that of Cratylus (see Badiou 141). The primal scene of the math- eme is not in Plato at all, but in a specific turn to be observed in the Prior Analytics. It is Aristotle who introduces the letter proper - literal writing - into the matter of logos , thus creating logistics, that is, conceiving of a literal gap in the writing of sub- ject and predicate. As Lacan puts it in Seminar XVIII, the Prior Analytics perform "un petit commencement de la topologie: Ça consiste précisément à faire des trous dans l'écrit. Tous les animaux sont mortels , vous soufflez animaux et vous soufflez mortels , et vous mettez à la place le comble de l'écrit, c'est-à-dire une lettre toute simple" ( Séminaire XVIII: 81-82). What in Plato was still in the form of the externalized, intersubjective back-and-forth of Socratic dialectics ( ôicdéysaOai ) becomes absorbed into the apparently analytical constellation of apophantic propositions. The intro- duction of the letter, "une lettre toute simple," signals the persistence of the non-ana- lytical relation in the abstract differentiation of the syntactical positions (the topoi: S and P), and the lexical elements they are substituted for. It is this beginning notion of a topo-logical reading that opens up the space for the construction of a grammato- logical concept of the unconscious.</page><page sequence="12">158 Mosaic 44/3 (September 2011 ) Let us present what is at stake by risking a formula: grammatology and topology are gleichursprünglich (equioriginal). The main difficulty lies in demonstrating how the Lacanian concept of the matheme is constituted and sustained topologically. This question of demonstrability of the matheme is ultimately decided by the employment of fundamental concepts of mathematical topology itself, a development that goes back to 1961 and the seminar on identification. Given our limitations here, this is a side of Lacan's work that we cannot explore, except for maintaining that this question of topological ex-position is strictly contiguous to the question of writing. Still, this employment of mathematical topology is a clear departure from Derrida's canonical presentation of writing in Of Grammatology and related texts. We should not, how- ever, rush to identify Derrida's treatment as remaining within the discursive sphere, whereas Lacan would be reduced to the one venturing "beyond." While the influence of topological elements in Lacan's work steadily increases between 1961 and the mid- seventies, we should recall that this ultimately serves an interest in discursivity. Topology does not represent the structure; it is the structure, as evidenced by the turn towards James Joyce in Séminaire XXIII: Le sinthome. From the outset, the Lacanian rewriting of writing involves a change of tropes, which in turn announces a change of register. The central dichotomies of the early work or first classicism, that of parole and langue (in Saussure) or thinking and being (in Heidegger) undergo a change of register to that of the act of writing and the function of the written (écriture and écrit). This is not merely a metaphorical shift. It is also an attempt to address the Saussurian impasse of synchrony and diachrony, that is, of the completely differentiated language system and the absolutely transformative moment of the speech event. Writing comes to stand for the inclusion of the Saussurian antinomy in the synchronic system itself: the leap (Satz) of identity of the synchronic is only possible through the ex-centric act of writing. Here, the founding deconstructive con- stellation of The Voice and the Phenomenon and the insistence on the archi-trace in Of Grammatology can serve to give the Lacanian notion of rewriting a more rigorous form: none of the two elements, neither the identity of the "written" system (which is absolutely subject to the menace of dissemination), nor the act of writing, can be con- ceived of in terms of (self-)presence.8 The structure of rewriting is prior to its signified presence-ing in consciousness - that is, rewriting can only be thought of simultane- ously as a prescription, namely as the non-coextension of lalangue and logos , primary and secondary processes, respectively. In other words, consciousness has an Aristotelian structure for Lacan, whereas the unconscious rewriting is structured like a language (Cassin 58-59). While akin to Heidegger's distinction between the speaking of language (Sprechen der Sprache) and what he pejoratively calls logistics (a register</page><page sequence="13">Henrik S. Wilberg 159 of logos which for Heidegger can only mean a forgetting of Being), this does not amount to a denunciation of the logical. No metaphysical opposition of language and logic is retained. Even in the mode of rewriting, there is no alternative to formalization. The rewriting, then, becomes a rewriting of formalism. The literal treatment of a proposition like All animals are mortal introduces, as we have said, gaps or holes (trous) in the writing of predication. This gap has found a paradigmatic expression in Gottlob Freges division of the predicate function into its saturated and unsaturated positions - quite simply the asymmetry between "f ( )" and "x," between predicate and subject. The topological reading begins here. The gap between the parentheses of the function marks the spatiotemporal moment of the formal structure, the moment of synthesis in the analytical relation. The inside of the subject retroactively appears as the outside of its predicate, giving predication the topological properties of the Moebius strip. But Lacan does not merely seek the mark of the repressed synthetic moment in the analytical proposition. In a certain sense, this is already present in the formal account of writing from Aristotle to Frege. The rewriting proper takes place on the left side of the proposition, in Lacan's example not restricted to what happens between "mortal" and "animals," but the relation to the side of the quantifiers, of which there are two: Vx and 3x. It is only with this operation that the opposition between (uncon- scious) lalangue and (Aristotelian) logos is formalized: Vx.f(x) Vx.f(x) Vx.f(x) Wf(x) 3x.f(x) 3x.f(x) 3x.f(x) 3x.f(x) The rewriting consists in a displacement of the negation from the right to the left side of the formula. More specifically, the rewriting concerns only the universal negative and the particular affirmative, Vx and 3x. This negation, as one would expect, repre- sents the negation of the quantity of the proposition. As such it points to what is not cap- tured by the quantitative relation. For Lacan, these negative quantifiers inscribe the element that does not fall under the function f(x), a difference that is not of a determinable quantitative nature respective to the function. We shall call this the leap to the qualitative position of ek-sistence, an explicit reference to Heidegger's notion of Ek-sistenz. In this view, the negation of the syntactical position of "all" does not come to represent a subset, albeit negative, of f(x), but the negation of the purely quantitative relation as such. Let us note the double articulation of existence in the mode of rewriting, first as 3x, the articulation of the subordination of the "some" corresponding to the universal function of the "all" - these, as the schema shows, have been left in their traditional form (the inauthentic Heideggerian "ma/i"). However, the negative quantifier negates</page><page sequence="14">160 Mosaic 44/3 (September 2011 ) precisely the existential import of this dyad, the closure of universality and exception. The side of the negative quantifiers can be conceived of as a liminal formalization of the logic of the trace, the ek-sistential or evental mode, the diachronic event that never ceases to transform everything, especially the universality articulated by the "all," that is, that which universally falls under a particular function f(x). The goal of the Lacanian formalization is nothing less than a demonstration of the relation of logos and its supplement: a rewriting through an unconscious Mangue. This is what a grammatological concept of the unconscious seeks to accomplish. As a rewriting of the limits of writing itself (" écriture des limites même de l'écriture," as Alain Juranville puts it in his systematic presentation of Lacan's notion of writing [303]), it does not so much assign a definite place to grammatology as restore and present the always-present repressed (non-)ground of deconstruction. NOTES 1/ A second question to consider, if deconstruction is not the psychoanalysis of philosophy, is whether psy- choanalysis is the psychoanalysis of philosophy. Lacan's answer will be yes: even the "subject" of decon- struction will have been the subject of psychoanalysis. 2/ This text is of particular interest because it addresses a controversy over René Major's explicit attempt to address the possibility of a "Derridean psychoanalysis" at the same conference. It was Alain Badiou, one of the organizers of the symposium Lacan avec les philosophes , who made it clear that the presence of the title "Y a-t-il une psychanalyse derridienne?" in the symposium program was unacceptable. This question of the suppression of the proper name is clearly discernible as the guiding thread in Derrida's intervention, originally intended as a response to Major's contribution. The entire controversy and the exchange of let- ters leading up to the symposium were subsequently included in the publication of the conference pro- ceedings. 3/ Benoît Peeters's Derrida was published by Flammarion on 6 October 2010 - as it happens, the first day of the Freud After Derrida conference and the day before I delivered this paper. 4/ From a Lacanian point of view, one should ask whether the triumph of Anti-Oedipus is not in fact a side-stepping, indeed a denial in the clinical sense of the word, of the question of jouissance in order to cement the sexual relation as a task for a coalition of the willing. 5/ A sketch of this post-structuralist topography of turns would look something like the following: Lacan from the Freudian turn (with Hegelian and Heideggerian conceptual support), Deleuze from the legacy of transcendental thought (with Spinoza and Hume), and Derrida from Saussure's linguistics (by way of Husserl's phenomenology of the sign relation). 61 1 owe this formula to my Viennese friend and colleague Sándor Ivády. 7/ This omission is even more striking as the text originated in a paper presented in Jean Hyppolite's Collège de France lectures delivered on the topic of Hegel's Science of Logic. It would require a further paper to discuss the difficult topic of Derrida's "unrestrained Hegelianism." 8/ This corresponds exactly to a passage in Plato's The Sophist , where the absence of the self returns in its proliferation in The Stranger's definition of identity, as interpreted by Heidegger in Der Satz der Identität: ěicaaTOv èauxã) aúxó xaúxóv, each itself to or with itself the same. Elsewhere, I have developed Heidegger's reinterpretation of the principle of identity through Plato and Parmenides as his "formula of castration," giving rise to Heidegger's own concept of the uncanny.</page><page sequence="15">Henrik S.
