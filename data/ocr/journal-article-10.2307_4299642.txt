<plain_text><page sequence="1">SURVEY OF EXCAVATIONS IN IRAN DURING 1968-69 I. EXCAVATION REPORTS Bdbd Jan The fourth season's excavations at BibA Jdn Tepe started on July I4th and continued for two months. As it was intended that this should be the final season at the site, our main efforts were directed towards completing the plan of the large building complex comprising the Fort and " Painted Chamber ", discovered last season on the East Mound. A full report of the 1968 season appears in the main section of this journal and should be read in conjunction with this much briefer notice. Our main discoveries took place in the central area of the so-called Fort. Here, the central room 4, is shown to have had a flat roof supported probably by four columns arranged in the form of an irregular square. Set in the west wall was a large fireplace with an elaborately fluted plaster surround. In the ' . .,/ U. S. S. R.

Measurements taken on the collapsed wall debris found in the centre of the room allowed us to estimate that the total height of the walls must have been at least Io m. There is, however, insufficient evidence for us to calculate whether the columns also reached to this height or whether there was a second storey. Enormous beams found lying on the lower Level III floor indicate how the room was roofed in its earliest phase, but there is some evidence to suggest that in the reoccupation period II, this central area was unroofed and formed an open courtyard. The transition from the rectangular central rooms of the Manors on the summit of the Central Mound, to a square columned hall, may reflect the beginnings of the new architectural tradition that was to culminate in the thirty-columned halls of Godin Tepe and Pasargadae, and the Apadana of Persepolis. Certainly, as with the Manors, one is left with the impression of builders feeling their way with a new form of experimental architecture with which they were not yet familiar. The " Painted Chamber "-which this season's work has shown to be either contemporary with, or slightly later than, the Fort, is already more assured and obviously planned with considerable forethought. West and east of the central room were two long rectangular rooms, 3 and 5, the first of which was completely excavated in 1968. Room 5 proved to be nearly identical, except for the presence of a small stepped plinth in the north-east corner. Tucked behind the plinth was a beautifully modelled and painted statuette of the lower half of a leg encased in a laced boot, and with three anklets. One assumes that this either formed part of some larger statue which once stood on the plinth or else reflects the influence of contemporary " boot vases " found in Eastern Anatolia. The only other room completely excavated was room 9, south of the courtyard flanking the " Painted Chamber ". This proved to be a long narrow living room, again with an elaborate fireplace to the north. The lower sections of the walls had been whitewashed, and the floor was covered with fragments of beautiful genre Luristdn pottery. Careful stratigraphical digging through the reoccupation levels of this room, and those of the courtyard immediately to the east, confirmed last season's pottery sequence, and also gave us our second Lurist.n bronze-a two-faced Janus head, affixed to the top of a screw. It was found in a deposit dating to the latest phase ofII, stratigraphically just above an earlier level which had produced mixed genre Luristdn and Niish-i Jan pottery, and two elbow fibulae. CLARE GOFF Bastam Das Deutsche Archaologische Institut in Teheran fuihrte in der Zeit vom I. Juli bis 31. August eine Grabung an dem urartaischen Platz Bastam bei Qara Zia ed-Din in Nordwest-Azerbaidjan durch. Es war die erste lIngere Kampagne in der 1967 aufgefundenen Anlage (vgl. Iran VI (1968), S. 166 und VII (1969), S. 188). Hauptaufgabe war die Erstellung eines Planes der Festung und der anschliessenden Siedlung, die Klarung der damit verbundenen topographischen Fragen und die Gewinnung datierbarer Keramik von verschiedenen Stellen der Anlage. Der durch zum Teil noch bis in 5 m hoch erhaltenen Mauern und Felsabtreppungen als Spuren verschwundener Mauern befestigte Festungsberg ist rund 850 m lang, etwa 400 m breit und erhebt sich 18o m hoch tiber der Ebene. Bastam ist damit mit Abstand die gr6sste der bisher auf iranischem Boden festgestellten urartaischen Festungen und folgt in der Gr6sse nach Vankalesi und Toprakkale bei Van. Die am Fusse des Festungsberges sich erstreckende Siedlung ist rund 6oo00 m lang und etwa 300 m breit. Ihre Gebude sind grossenteils noch als Schutt- walle im Gelande sichtbar. Eine besondere Stadtmauer scheint nicht angelegt worden zu sein. Auf Festung und Siedlung bezieht sich die Angabe der im Archaologischen Museum in Teheran befindlichen " Bastam-Inschrift" die ausser dem Bau eines Haldi-Tempels den Namen der Stadt, Rusahinili, erwahnt. Die gesamte Anlage ist in der Zeit Rusa II im 7. Jahrhundert v. Chr. gegriindet worden und die Siedlung hat nach den Ergebnissen der diesjahrigen Grabung maximal 60-80 Jahre bestanden, das heisst, sie ging beim Ende des Reiches Urartu um 600oo v. Chr. zu Grunde. Fuir diese Annahme spricht das Vorhandensein von nur einem Stratum im Stadtgebiet und zusitzlich die Keramik, bei der es sich im Stadtgebiet vorwiegend um einfache Gebrauchskeramik spiturartaischer Zeit handelt. Die Siedlung ist mit der Festung durch ein umfangreiches Kammertor verbunden, das in dieser Kampagne zusammen mit flankierenden Bauten in Form von Schnittgrabungen untersucht wurde. Dabei konnten drei</page><page sequence="3">SURVEY OF EXCAVATIONS 177 aufeinanderfolgende Bauphasen deutlich unterschieden werden. Ein ailterer, langrechteckiger Hallen- bau mit Risaliten auf seiner Aussenseite bildet die il1teste Phase. Er ist aus gr6sseren B16cken in sorgfiltig aufgeschichteter Bruchsteintechnik errichtet. Gegen diesen Bau 1iuft eine Risalitmauer, die ihre Fortsetzung in der grossen, noch erhaltenen Aufwegmauer auf die H6he des Festungsberges findet. Als dritte Phase wurde die eigentliche Toranlage mit zwei starken, etwa quadratischen Tiirmen, an diese Risalitmauer angebaut. Auf der Aussenseite des langrechteckigen, ilteren Hallenbaus wurden einige, durch herabgerutschte B16cke der Mauern stark beschiidigte Skelette freigelegt und in Fundzu- sammenhang mit diesen Skeletten Bronzenadeln, Bronzeringe mit Siegelsteinen, Karneolringe und ( " .

Da einer der Bronzeringe ein typisches armenisches Kreuz zeigt, scheint die Annahme gerechtfertigt zu sein, dass es sich bei diesen Toten um die Opfer einer Katastrophe aus friihchristlich- armenischer Zeit handeln k6nnte. In die urartaiische Zeit passen diese Funde stilistisch nicht. Ausser dem n6rdlichen Tor zur Festung wurde auch das Siidtor in seinen aiusseren Teilen freigelegt. Hier ergaben sich zwei urartaiische Bauphasen, darunter als Anbau ein Pfeilerraum, der bisher nur teilweise freigelegt werden konnte. In armenischer Zeit wurde der Raum des Siidtores durch Hiitten einge- nommen, entsprechende Keramik und eine Bronzemiinze wurden in der Grabung gefunden. Auf der H6he des Festungsberges ergab in der Nihe der grossen Steinterrasse, die vorliufig als wahrscheinlicher Platz des von Rusa II in seiner Steininschrift erwaihnten Haldi-Tempels gelten kann, ein Schnitt zwei Riiume. Der untere, am Hang gelegene, angeschnittene Pithosraum erbrachte Keilinschriften und Massangaben an den grossen Vorratsgef'assen. Der hangaufwirts anschliessende</page><page sequence="4">178 JOURNAL OF PERSIAN STUDIES Raum erbrachte grosse Mengen der typischen urartaiischen rotpolierten Keramik des 8.-7. Jahr- hunderts v. Chr. (sog. Toprakkale-Ware), wie sie auch in der gleichzeitig mit unserer Grabung laufenden Grabung in Haftvan-Tepe bei Shahpur (Charles Burney) gefunden wurde. Schliesslich wurde ein zu Fiissen des Festungsberges gelegener Tumulus angegraben, der aus Flusskiesbdndern und Schichten von Material eines alteren Tepe aufgehauft ist. Die Bestattung konnten wir in dieser Kampagne noch nicht erreichen. Die bemalte Keramik aus den Schichten des Tepematerials geht bis in den Anfang des 2. Jahrtausends v. Chr. zuriick. Ausser der eigentlichen Grabung wurde die Surveytitigkeit in Azerbaidjan weiter fortgefuhrt und auch in diesem Jahr wieder einige urartdiische Anlagen neu gefunden. Sie werden durch entsprechende Keramik, durch die typische Mauertechnik oder durch die ffir die Urartter bezeichnenden Felsabt- reppungen als urartiische Anlagen ausgewiesen. Die in den Jahren 1967, 1968 und 1969 festgestellten urartiischen Anlagen sind auf der Obersichtskarte angegeben. Ausser diesen urartiischen Neufunden sind eine Reihe weiterer vor-und friihgeschichtlicher, mittelalterlich armenischer und islamischer Befunde gemacht worden, die, wie die Survey-Ergebnisse der Jahre 1967 und 1968 in den Archdologischen Mitteilungen aus Iran, N.F. II (1969), S. 7 ff und wie die Ergebnisse der Bastamgrabung in den AMI III, vorgelegt werden sollen. WOLFRAM KLEISS Bishdpar The historic city of Shdhpfir, known as Bishaipir, was built in 266 A.D., in the twenty-fifth year of the reign of ShdhpUr I. We owe this discovery to the bilingual inscription in Pahlavi/Arsacid and Sasanian written on one of the columns at the so-called " place of offerings ". The French Archaeo- logical Mission carried out excavations at Bishaipir on five occasions between the years 1933 and 1940, revealing a number of handsome monuments. Unfortunately their work could not be continued, and after a break of several years the Archaeological Service sent an Iranian archaeological mission to Bishapiir in 1968. The Archaeological Mission began its work near the northern wall of the city, exposing a long stretch of the perimeter wall more than I50 m. in length. In its first phase of construction the outer face of the wall appears to have been supplied with a virtually continuous fagade of rounded towers, each 7 -5 m. in diameter with an interval of only 40 cm. between them. The tallest examples still stand to a height of 3 m. During a second period of construction, again within the Sasanian period, many of the buildings of the town were transformed-including the outer face of the wall. Thus in each series of three towers, one tower was removed. Apart from these transformations, another monument, characteristic of the Sasanian period, was built beside the River Shahptir, only Io m. from the perimeter wall. In this building-the function of which is still uncertain-a central iwan is to be found with two wings and two corridors. Engaged columns on rectangular bases also enliven the fagade. The remains of the Islamic buildings recovered so far fall into three distinct periods of which the most splendid date from the late eleventh and early twelfth centuries A.D. ALI AKBAR SARFARAZ Ganj Dareh Tepe Excavations were resumed at this small mound in Kermanshih District for nine weeks from June to late August 1969. The research was sponsored by the Department d'Anthropologie, UniversitC de Montrial and financed by the Canada Council, with the collaboration of the Archaeological Service of Iran. This was the second full season of work here, following a brief sondage in 1965 and two months of excavation in 1967 (see Iran V and VI). These had shown that (a) early phases of the Neolithic were represented extending to the eighth and perhaps ninth millennia, (b) there existed a village level constructed of brick with the buildings unusually intact due to its partial destruction by fire, and (c) evidence of an early stage of pottery making was present.</page><page sequence="5">SURVEY OF EXCAVATIONS 179 In 1969 we concentrated on exposing in the central part of the mound larger areas of the last four levels (tentatively called A, B, C and D) revealed in 1967. The basal deposits of the site (Level E) were not investigated in 1969; thus we are not yet certain as to its relation to subsequent levels nor whether solid architecture is present. It is this level, or part of it, which may date to the ninth millennium B.C., if a single radiocarbon determination from the 1965 sondage (GaK-8o7: 8450?I50 B.C.) is accepted. In the " burned village " level (D) about 60 square metres have now been exposed. This has revealed a more complex situation than suspected earlier. It is made up largely of small rooms, alcoves or cubicles, most of which seem far too restricted to have been used for living purposes. Most are rectangular but some are round and silo-like and were perhaps storage places, though no traces of stored materials were preserved. Some of the walls have round or oval " portholes " which are often sealed by means of flat clay discs. In several rooms there were clay containers resembling storage jars, as well as small domed " bins ", all built against the walls. These were immovable containers, but there was also a very large portable " storage jar " about o. 8o m. high (already reported in 1967 but not removed until this year) standing on a plastered surface in a corner of one room. All these containers and " bins " are made of plaster-like mud, apparently sun-baked originally and preserved by the action of the fire which destroyed the village. The structures in the village are of the cluster type, built against each other with no paths or lanes between them and no clearly defined doorways. Most are built of straw-tempered plano-convex bricks, some nearly I m. in length, laid between layers of mud mortar. The walls, which in some cases are still standing to heights of nearly 2 m., are faced inside and outside with mud plaster. In addition to the brick walls there is an unusual form of walling (unknown to the writer elsewhere in Iran) in which alternating layers of mud and fine plaster were built up in strips and then coated with plaster on both faces. There are no hearths or other signs of domestic occupation in the rooms though some stone tools and animal bones occur. If the sectors so far excavated in this " burned village " represent a storage area then possibly the living areas are to be found on the flanks of the mound. It is not yet clear how many building phases are represented in this level. Several (unpublished) radiocarbon determinations recently obtained at the University of Pennsylvania suggest that it was occupied in the second half of the eighth millennium B.C. Level C was not well represented in this season's excavations and little can be said of it at present. A larger area of Level B was exposed including several rectangular rooms with rich occupation deposits and hearths and a few pieces of crude pottery. The walls are made of brick as well as chineh. Another recent Pennsylvania radiocarbon determination suggests this level dates to about 7000 B.C. The last I -5 m. of deposits at the site are grouped as Level A although it probably corresponds to more than a single occupation. It is badly leached and disturbed by roots and animal burrows, and very little remains intact. Bricks are visible in some profiles but are badly decomposed and very few wall sections could be traced either by following them into the profiles or by scraping horizontally. However, there is a well-made domed structure preserved, possibly an oven or kiln, with several strata of ashy materials. We recovered none of the curious sherds with crescent-shaped or " fingernail " impressions found in 1967. The flint tools seem to be very similar typologically from base to top of this site. The assemblages are characterized by backed bladelets, truncated blades, heavy flake scrapers, end-scrapers, many use- retouched pieces and some fine bladelet cores. Some blades have extensive zones of polish and may be elements of reaping knives. For the first time we recovered a very few geometric microliths (trapezes, segments of circles). No obsidian was used. No ground stone axes or celts occur and only a few frag- ments of polished stone vessels, but there are many rubbing stones, pestles and large limestone mortars. Clay animal figurines and cones are abundant, especially in Level D, and several more female figurines were found including the " stalky headed " type known at Tepe Sarab. Up to now very little in the way ofvegetal material has been recovered although flotation techniques have been employed in both seasons. Study of the faunal remains by Dexter Perkins suggests that goats at least were domesticated here. This interpretation may be further strengthened by discovery in 1969 of hoof prints, probably goat or sheep, on a number of the piano-convex bricks from Level D. Apparently the animals had walked over the bricks while they were being sun-dried.</page><page sequence="6">180 JOURNAL OF PERSIAN STUDIES For the first time we have recovered prehistoric human skeletal remains at Ganj Dareh. A complete skeleton of an adult, flexed and without grave goods, occurred near the top of Level D rubble and thus is of later age. In the " burned village " itself some very burned bones from several alcoves represent three children and an adult. These may have been burials which were later calcined by the fire. Perhaps the most significant general result of the work so far at Ganj Dareh is that at last we have a Zagros site which falls, at least in part, in the eighth millennium B.C. The rich occupation deposits of Level B and the well-preserved architecture and early pottery of Level D promise to throw much light on a millennium for which hitherto no dated materials were known in the Zagros. Another season of excavation at Ganj Dareh is planned, especially to investigate the antecedents of these in Level E. PHILIP E. L. SMITH Gheytaryeh The Gheytaryeh district of north Tehran, where the excavations took place, is situated in a chain of hills at the foot of the Elburz range, between Chizar, Farmanieh, Darrous and Gholhak. Here local building operations had revealed the existence of an important Iron Age cemetery probably dating from I200 to 800 B.C. The remains of this civilization, known by its grey-black pottery, have already been discovered at Darrous and Chizar in the area around Tehran, and also at Khorvin and Chendar in the Karaj-Qazvin area. Pottery discovered in the valleys of Gilan (Amlash-Daylamdn), in the Iranian Talish, at IHasanlii IV, in Tepe Giyan I, in cemeteries A and B at Sialk and at Tepe .Hisr (Ddmghdn), dating from the late second millennium and the beginning of the first millennium B.C., can all be compared to the pottery found at Gheytaryeh. One could say, therefore, that the Gheytaryeh pottery is one sample of the arts that came to be practised by the immigrants who, according to archaeologists' theories, entered Iran towards the end of the second millennium B.C. by routes running both east and west of the Caspian Sea. The dead from Gheytaryeh were buried haphazardly, with some on their left side and others on their right, but usually with the face directed towards the sunrise. The graves themselves consist of earth pits. Usually there were between five and twenty pottery vessels next to each skeleton, apart from other small objects in terracotta and bronze. The size of the ancient cemetery-it occupies an area close to 15,ooo square metres-is proof of a long period of civilization in this region and its environs. Unfortunately the numerous modern buildings that now exist at Gheytaryeh may make it difficult to locate the settlement that once went with the cemetery. KAMBAKHSH FARD Godin Tepe Full scale excavations were again conducted by the Joint Canadian-Iranian Expedition of the University of Toronto, the Royal Ontario Museum and the Archaeological Service of Iran at Godin Tepe in western Iran from mid-June to late September 1969. The excavations were supported financially by the Royal Ontario Museum, the Harvie Foundation, the Babylonian Collection of Yale University and the Ford Foundation. Excavations concentrated on (I) continuing clearance of the Period II or Median structure; (2) extending downward the " Deep Sounding " over an area of some 700oo square metres further into the Period III or second millennium B.c. deposits; and (3) opening sizable areas of the upper Period III building levels which appear at the surface of the mound in most places thus far tested. The Period II structure: The 1967 excavations suggested that the whole of the Upper Citadel was formed from the remains of a large fortified manor house dating to Period II. The 1969 excavations proved the point. We have now cleared a single structure, albeit built in units over a period of time, covering some 3600 square metres. The fortification wall laid bare over some 65 m. in 1967 was found to continue for another 40 m. further east along the steeply eroded north face of the Upper Citadel. This newly excavated segment of wall is marked by six pilasters or bastions, a large tower toward its eastern end, and arrow slots in and between each pilaster and at suitable points in the fagade of the</page><page sequence="7">Pl.

We have yet to find the eastern limit of either the wall or of the structure immediately inside or south of the wall. Here lies a double bank of six great magazines, each store room entered from a long corridor or hallway running down the east-west axis of the building. The six magazines off the north corridor are each approximately 2-75 m. wide and 8-75 m. long. The walls separating the rooms are approximately 1-25 m. thick, while the wall separating the north and south banks of magazines, which was once the outside wall of the fortress, is 2-50 m. thick. The south magazines are approximately 7-25 m. long and 3 - o m. wide. The south wall of the south magazines was apparently the south wall of the entire fortified complex in its final stage. Between these magazines and the great columned hall uncovered in 1967 we found a series of small rooms, difficult to describe without reference to a detailed plan, as well as the remains of two rather fine stairways which once gave access to the second storey that covered this whole wing of the building. Finally, to the west of the great columned hall we discovered yet another, smaller hall with its roof supported originally by a double row of four columns. The western wall of this hall is the western wall of the complex. Stratigraphic and structural evidence indicates that the original structure included the two columned halls and an open courtyard or collection of small rooms immediately east of the great hall-approxi- mately what we excavated in 1967. To this was added first the north bank of magazines (note that the wall separating the north and south magazines contained arrow slots). A third stage of construction is represented by the south bank of magazines. Finally, since our resident local Median prince now had a building shaped roughly like a " C ", he filled in the area between the south magazines and the great hall with the rooms and stairways mentioned above. Eventually, the entire structure lost its original function and was taken over by people who blocked off many of the doorways and passages (the entire east wing apparently went out of use) and who cut up the monumental spaces with small, rather jerry-built curtain walls. This phase was in turn followed by a " squatter " occupation of peoples who may be said to have simply camped in the much-decayed ruins of a once grand building. Preliminary field analysis of the pottery from this structure and consultation with colleagues working on sites in the same general time range suggest perhaps a late eighth century, but more likely a seventh-early sixth century date for Period II. On the whole, any significant Achaemenid occupation would seem unlikely and we appear to be quite firmly in the Median time range. Whether eventually we shall be able to date the several stages in the construction of the building on the basis of the pottery found seems doubtful. Small finds other than pottery were rare, and all data indicate that the building was peacefully abandoned. The " Deep Sounding ": An area of some 700 square metres has been devoted to a stratigraphic sounding that we hope will eventually test the remains of Periods II to V (mid-fourth millennium B.c.) through a depth of deposit of about 15 m. In 1969 this project carried us some 3 m. deeper into the Period III levels, and the sounding now stands at a total depth of something over 6 m. We completed the clearance of Level 111:2, begun in 1967, and defined Levels 111:3 and 111:4. This, the lowest level reached thus far, represents the architectural remains of several small village houses fronting on a packed earth street. The walls were preserved to an unusual height. A great many pots were found smashed in situ on the stone-paved floors and courtyards which are a hallmark of the level, and small finds in general were unusually numerous. The skeleton of a man crushed by falling roof debris was found on the stone floor of one room. All of this evidence suggests some kind of violent destruction, and an earthquake is perhaps the best explanation (cf. the destruction of Level III:2). There may be evidence in both the architecture and the small finds for specialized craft functions in the area excavated. A guess date for this level is c. seventeenth-sixteenth centuries B.c. Attempts to open up large areas of the upper Period III construction level elsewhere on the Citadel were not so successful. Unfortunately, the area chosen turned out to have been comparatively open and few structures were recovered. Work here did demonstrate, however, that there had been a limited Period II occupation, presumably contemporary with the fortified manor house on the Upper Citadel, dug into the upper Period III deposit. The remains suggest a few flimsy structures. All other areas on the Citadel and Outer Town thus far tested have shown Period III materials immediately below the present surface. 16A</page><page sequence="20">182 JOURNAL OF PERSIAN STUDIES Excavations in 1971 should see the end of work on the Median fortification. We shall also continue with the " Deep Sounding ", and may return to do further work in the Period III cemetery on the south side of the Outer Town mound. T. CUYLER YOUNG, JR. Haftavdn Tepe The second season of excavations at Haftavdn Tepe began in the second week of July 1969 and continued till mid-September, the camp being closed on September 18th. There was a staff of fourteen and a work force averaging eighty in number. Work was continued in several of the areas opened in the first season, while new trenches were opened up both on the citadel and below. The intention of investigating as many periods as possible with the minimum of clearing of overlying levels was fairly well achieved as before, though the later levels on the citadel proved to be as severely damaged as in the previously excavated areas. The earliest level to be found was in a new trench (R) at the foot of the north-east side of the citadel, where recent quarrying of soil made it possible to examine the earlier phases of the citadel itself. Rather unexpectedly, since at a height of 17 m. above datum at the spring, Early Bronze II pottery was immediately found, together with a well-preserved and compact building plan, of very different character from any of the later levels at this site. The graphite burnish on some of the pottery gives a clear parallel with the Early Bronze II period at Yanik Tepe and also with pottery from sites in Georgia: a date around 2000 B.C. is indicated. The east end of the Early Bronze mound seems to have been near the lower end of Trench R, while the west end was probably not far east of the major stone building in Trench E found in 1968. Thus the present shape of the citadel was brought about by that of the under- lying Early Bronze mound. The outer parts of the site are therefore almost certainly entirely of the second millennium B.C. and later. A ceramic sequence is being obtained from a sounding (JX) of 10 o I0 m. within the area (J) opened in 1968 at the east end of the site, near the spring. Seven levels have now been found here, the lowermost being very well preserved and clearly not far above virgin soil, although there is at least one more building level as yet unexcavated. The greater part of the pottery from all these levels is un- painted; and grey ware of Iron I (Ijasanlfi V) type occurs commonly in only one level, the fill of a very large pit. This is one of the indications that the site was perhaps only very sparsely inhabited during the Iron I period (c. 1350-1ooo B.c.). In the earlier levels of this sounding, perhaps dating back to c. 1600 B.C., there is a small proportion of painted sherds exhibiting a wide variety and in part demonstrating connections with Trans-Caucasia to the north. At the west end of the site a major extension to the 1968 excavations was begun, but the great depth of deposit made it impossible to complete this to the level of the great stone building till the next season. In these areas (P2 and Q) several building levels were distinguished, though the architecture was in general poorly preserved. These levels appear to date back not before c. 1000 B.C., as the contents and stratigraphic position of two burials, each of a young girl, indicate. For the first time the positions on head and neck of several types of personal ornament found in the 1968 season became compre- hensible. These ornaments include earrings, discs, head-band and tassels of bronze and a variety of beads of glazed frit, shells, etc. Underneath the head, but separated from it by a line of burning in the soil, was a cylinder-seal of local design, not so far attributable on stylistic evidence to any clearly-known class, though possibly with Mitannian affinities. The principal achievement of the 1969 season has been the uncovering of a large part of the plan of the citadel buildings belonging to the Urartian period. Pottery, including several vessels of the characteristic fine red polished ware, and other finds make this dating beyond any doubt, though a more precise date within the period c. 850-c. 6oo00 B.c. would be hard to venture: on the whole this building level, planned to one over-all scheme for the citadel and on one alignment, seems most probably to be of the eighth or early seventh century B.c. At first a line of six column-bases was thought to indicate the fagade of one major building, though this was situated very close to another; but finally it was realized that these columns belonged not to any external portico but supported an upper floor,</page><page sequence="21">SURVEY OF EXCAVATIONS 183 in whose debris was found some of the fine red polished ware, also in similar context in a small room forming a corner tower close to the north edge of the citadel. This was part of the building rather than of any defences. Next to it was a small gateway. This building level was constructed directly on top of the debris of a fire, and was in its turn burnt: in this burning were found fragments of bronzes and of beads, including many of yellow glass, scarcely found in the 1968 season and therefore probably later than the contents of burials in the outer parts of the mound. There seems to have been fairly consider- able stone robbing. There is evidence of the rebuilding of at least the brickwork of the perimeter wall along the very short stretch of the north side of the citadel so far excavated. The level immediately overlying the Urartian buildings may well be Median (i.e. early sixth century B.c.), but is so badly destroyed by pits that no very clear plan emerges. There seems little hope of finding areas of the citadel where the post-Urartian levels may be less damaged: those parts next to the perimeter seem the least destroyed. But the Urartian level will assuredly repay more extensive excava- tion. Overlying the Urartian perimeter wall was one constructed of a few stones and mud packing, all that has survived. Above this was a wall built without use of any stones but with large flat square mud-bricks averaging 40 x 40 x 10 cm. or slightly more: these bricks and an approximately semi- circular tower forming part of these defences seem to suggest a Sasanian date; but the occurrence immediately over the remains of this wall of two Sasanian burials comparable with those found else- where on the citadel shows that these defences must be placed very early in the Sasanian period. Otherwise they could be Parthian, though there is no parallel to support such a dating. Fewer Sasanian burials were found than in the 1968 season, showing that they were probably mostly confined to the north-west part of the citadel. Only when the pottery from the post-Urartian levels has been thoroughly analysed will any certainty on their dating be possible. The two seasons of work at Haftavan Tepe have demonstrated that it was perhaps only partially occupied in the second millennium B.C., after a long earlier duration. In the tenth and ninth centuries B.C., however, it became a large town, which, contrary to the writer's previous opinion, continued as a major town under Urartian rule. The distinctive Urartian pottery was possibly used only in the citadel, and there in the better rooms alone: elsewhere the local wares, made in the tradition flourishing before the establishment of Urartu in the ninth century B.C., were still in use. Several more seasons of excavations are planned, the next one for 1971. C. A. BURNEY Kaluraz Among other excavations conducted by the Iranian Archaeological Service during the summer of 1969, work was again resumed at the important eighth to sixth century cemetery of Kaluraz, which is situated 55 km. south of Rasht. Masjid-i Solaiman La seconde campagne de fouilles sur la terrasse sacree de Sar-Masjid, a Masjid-i Solaiman, dans les montagnes des Bakhtiari, a dur6 six semaines, au printemps de 1968.

Mais l'obstacle pour nos travaux 6tait d'une importance majeure: c'est ainsi que le degagement du temple d'Heraclks, decouvert en 1967, fut stop6 devant les tombes et n'a 6t6 reconnu que sur a peine la moitie de sa superficie. Grace a l'intervention de la plus haute instance du pouvoir en Iran, cette difficult6 fut aplanie et nous avons eu la possibilit6 de poursuivre nos recherches, sans pour cela porter atteinte aux sentiments traditionnels des habitants du grand centre petrolier qu'est Masjid-i Solaiman. La Pl. Ia presente l'aspect de la terrasse "a la fin de cette seconde campagne. On y distingue, au premier plan, un grand batiment dont la destination reste encore 'a determiner apris que son degage- ment aura 6t6 termin6, et, a% sa gauche, le temple d'H6raclks entierement reconnu. La P1. Ib donne l'idee du grand escalier de 25 metres de largeur qui, sur la P1. Ia se trouve a% droite. La P1. Ic montre l'tat actuel de la faqade de temple d'Heraclks avec les restes des dallages de pierre sur le sol, qui indiquent, peut-etre, des voies processionnelles, ainsi que des gradins ou banquettes faits avec de puissants blocs de pierre appuyds contre le mur de la faqade perc6e de deux portes donnant dans l'antecella. Un certain nombre de petits bronzes provenaient de ce sanctuaire, offrandes votives sans doute, parmi lesquels un danseur (P1. IIb) qui, tout comme on peut le voir de nos jours, tient en dansant sa main gauche derriere la nuque; une lampe (P1. IIe); un petit animal (P1. IId); et un pied ou support en forme de g6nie f6minin ailk, qui se termine en bas par une patte griffue (P1. IIa). Des sculptures de l'Cpoque parthe sont venues au jour lors du degagement du temple ou de ses approches. Parmi elles, il faut mentionner un torse d'homme arm6 d'un poignard enfonc6 dans sa tunique sur la hanche droite - oeuvre en ronde bosse mais d'une platitude que sauve l'interessant decor du tissu fait de losanges encadrant un motif 'a quatre petales (Pl. IIc). La partie inf6rieure d'un autre bas-relief presente un noble Parthe dans la pose d'orant, son bras droit (dont on ne distingue que le coude) lev6 en signe de v6neration, et qui tient dans sa main gauche un objet indetermin6 (fruit?). Lui aussi porte sur la hanche droite un poignard dont on ne voit que la poignee, le reste 6tant gliss6 dans une poche faite dans la tunique. Celle-ci, ainsi que le pantalon long gliss6 dans la chaussure que serre un ruban at boucle, sont faits d'un riche tissu orne de losanges et de bandes de motifs en rinceaux au dessin lin6aire (P1. IIIb). La presentation sur les sculptures parthes de ces cofteux tissus, ne souffre pas le moindre pli susceptible de nuire 'a l'appreciation de la valeur du vetement, et contraste avec d'autres repr6sentations d'orants dont les vetements d'un tissu plus modeste ne sont pas depourvus d'un certain mouvement de vie. Parmi les tetes mises au jour, il faut citer celle d'un homme barbu, aux cheveux trait6s par des rangees de bouclettes en bossettes (Pl. IIId); une autre tete, d'adolescent, "a figure glabre, aux yeux grands ouverts, la bouche petite aux lvres serrees, porte quelques lointains reflets de l'art " greco- bouddhique" son contemporain (P1. IIIa); et, enfin, une petite tate de femme en ronde bosse (P1. IIIc). Les recherches de cette annie ont enrichi nos connaissances, parmi tant d'autres, de deux r6sultats auxquels nous attachons une importance primordiale. J'attribuais la cr6ation de cette terrasse de Masjid-i Solaiman i l'6poque ach~minide, et ceci depuis ma premikre visite sur les lieux, il y a exacte- ment vingt ans. Plusieurs raisons m'y invitaient: la conception mime de la terrasse; I'appareillage de son coffrage; l'drection de son podium, quoique remanik et moins bien conserve que celui de Bard-6 Nechandeh voisin. La campagne de 1968 nous a apportC des preuves supplkmentaires susceptibles d'6tayer cette hypoth~se et de maintenir une date qui correspondrait a l'6poque oi les tribus perses vinrent s'installer dans cette partie des monts Zagros. Derrikre le temple d'H6racls et . un niveau plus bas que son sol, entre ce sanctuaire et la montagne contre laquelle est adossde la terrasse, nous avons mis aujour des batiments (P1. IVa) oii fut dfcouverte une poterie dotte de versoirs trbs caractfristiques, connue en Iran et attestfe aussi bien i Suse que dans le nord-ouest du pays comme 6tant celle de l'Cpoque achfmfnide (P1. IVb).</page><page sequence="23">SURVEY OF EXCAVATIONS 185 La seconde acquisition touche plut6t le domaine de l'histoire des religions. Je m'explique: aussi bien &amp; Masjid-i Solaiman qu'a Bard-a Nechandeh, nous nous sommes trouv6s en pr6sence d'une monstrueuse annihilation de tout ce qui pouvait exister dans et autour des sanctuaires d'images de fiddles ou de statues de culte, sculpt6es en pierre ou couldes en bronze. Devant nous, sortaient de terre des " membra disjecta " des images des humains et s'6talaient au sol des tetes sans corps, des corps sans tate ni jambes, des jambes sans corps. Ma premiere pens6e fut de croire a des destructions dues aux fanatiques conqudrants musulmans, puisqu'on sait l'aversion qu'avait l'Islam a cette 6poque pour la representation humaine: je suivais, comme la suite l'a d6montr6, une fausse piste. La fouille se poursuivait et, parallklement aux trouvailles de sculpture s'accumulaient les monnaies d6couvertes. Mais a c6t6 d'une bonne centaine de pikces 61ymaiennes, quelques rares emissions parthes et sassanides, aucune monnaie islamique ne vint grossir le lot numismatique sur aucune des deux terrasses. Le plus surprenant pour nous a 6t6 r6v616 par l'6tude des emissions sassanides dont aucune ne datait de plus bas que le IVe siecle, et cela ' l'encontre de ce qu'on trouve sur des sites de cette 6poque oi les monnaies des Khosroes abondent. Serions-nous done en pr6sence des suites d'une action de l'Eglise zoroastrienne qui, avec les rdformes de Kartir, devint celle de l'Etat sassanide, caract6risde par sa violence contre tout ce qui 6tait consid6r6, par les reformateurs, comme directement non-zoroastrien, et les images des sanctuaires en premier lieu ? Cette hypothese ne s'accorderait-elle pas avec les id6es qu'exprime Nyberg dans son etude r6cemment parue dans les Archaeologische Mitteilungen aus Iran, ressuscit6es grace au Dr Heinz Luschey (H.F. 1968, pp. 39-48)? R. GHIRSHMAN Palaeolithic Excavations in the Zagros Area An expedition was organized from the University Department of Archaeology and Anthropology, Cambridge, during the Long Vacation of 1969, with the primary object of exploring reported pre- historic cave sites in the Hazar-i Masjid (Kopet Dagh) range in Eastern Iran and regions to the south and east. The problem at issue was to throw light on the expansion of the Upper Palaeolithic blade industries in South-West Asia, at the expense of the earlier Middle Palaeolithic flake assemblage. In the event exploration from this point of view of regions south and east of the Hazar-i-Masjid was frustrated by an outbreak of cholera in the area planned for study, while the sites made available by the Iranian authorities in the Hazar-i-Masjid all proved to contain only medieval and later occupations. The expedition accordingly turned westwards to examine certain sites in the Kiih-i-Dasht area of Luristan, already briefly visited earlier in the season. Our first task was to examine in greater detail a series of painted rock shelters in the escarpment which crowns the Ktih-i-Sarun massif, a few kilometres south-east of the town of Kfih-i-Dasht and at an altitude of some 2000 m. above sea level. In addition to the problem of dating the wall paintings, the sites in question and others near them (kindly shown to the writer by Mr. Sarfaraz of the Antiquities Service of the Iran Bastan Museum, during our earlier visit) gave promise of deposits of Palaeolithic date, possibly capable of contributing to the original purpose of the expedition. In all, four sites were sounded and three were dug in some detail. The first, on the west side of the mountain, known as Mirmalas, yielded only deposits of Neolithic date. These were some 2 m. thick, rested on rock bottom and were clearly stratified and undisturbed. They contained large slabs fallen from the wall, whose parent position could be clearly identified from their shape. Since a number of paintings-including the large hunting scene for which the site is chiefly remarkable-had been painted after the fall of the slabs, we had here clear demonstration of the Neolithic or post-Neolithic age of these examples at least. It is hoped to describe these results in greater detail, together with illustrations of the art, in a later report. Six other decorated shelters in the area on the eastern side of the mountain, all with paintings showing points of stylistic resemblance to Mirmalas, were also studied but failed to produce further direct evidence of date. Several of these however contained deposits of quite different lithological character to Mirmalas and it was these last that provided contributions to the second problem.</page><page sequence="24">186 JOURNAL OF PERSIAN STUDIES Bardd Spid I (the Luri version of the place name, otherwise Sang-i-Safid I) was the first to be examined on the Eastern escarpment. It consisted of three openings into a single complex of small caves, affording an overlapping stratigraphical sequence in three segments. The latest segment of this upper portion was not unlike Mirmalas and yielded some coarse pottery of Neolithic date. The second, containing relatively fine-grained deposits, passed downwards gradually into a thermoclastic scree, of a type elsewhere known to result from very cold or glacial climatic conditions. This yielded traces of flintwork of Upper Palaeolithic character and carbon in its upper portion, but below, deeper in the same scree, was a small series of artifacts of unquestionably Mousterian typology. Carbon samples were obtained which, it is hoped, may be sufficient to establish a dated framework for the Barde Spid I finds. A similar sedimentological profile was obtained in the decorated site of Humian II some two miles to the south-east in the same escarpment. Here the only datable object was a flint blade of Mesolithic or later type in situ immediately above the scree. Finally in the important decorated site of Humian I, an extensive formation of cemented scree was found to contain a succession of rich Mousterian horizons throughout at least 3 m. of depth. An upper horizon was studied in detail from the point of view of horizontal scatter while the earlier horizons were exposed in trial soundings. As far as the investigation has proceeded, the Humian I succession would seem to be of special interest as offering a high montane aspect of the Mousterian already known from such lower level sites in the same general region as Kunji, Yafteh, Bisitun, etc. It also offers possibilities of studying the evolutionary pattern of the Mousterian in the area. The realization of these and other objectives must now await the laboratory work in progress. It already seems likely however that the results from the four sites, all from a closely similar topo- graphical and geological context, afford a documented succession of changing sedimentary processes and hence some evidence of climatic change over the last 40,000-50,000 years. If preliminary indica- tions are fulfilled, the human settlements at Humian I should cover an interval roughly in the order of 0,000ooo years. They probably indicate specialized summer encampments designed to exploit such animals of the high mountain environment as ibex, wild sheep, etc. A preliminary examination of the bones at least seems consistent with this suggestion. The raw material of the industry could have been obtained in part locally but in part is likely to have been brought from natural out-crops at a lower level. A brief survey of surface finds suggests the presence of hunters with the same basic stone-working tradition both in the neighbourhood of chert outcrops and elsewhere near water supplies on the mountain plateau. It remains to be seen if micro- scopic examination of the charcoal collected will provide any evidence of the contemporary vegetation but traces of invertebrate fauna were extremely scarce. C. B. M. McBURNEY Persepolis On an aerial photograph taken by Dr. E. Schmidt in 1940 one can see, away from the ruins scattered on the terrace at Persepolis, a certain quantity of hillocks a regular distance apart and linked by a line in high relief which seems to protect the eastern wing of the terrace. These hillocks and the line that links them are less easily seen by the tourist who strolls among the ancient ruins. Dr. Schmidt assumed from his aerial views that these hillocks were the remains of towers that had once defended the eastern flank of the royal palaces. When the Archaeological Service of the Ministry of Culture and Arts charged me, in the course of the year 1968, to proceed with investigations and excavations at Persepolis I thought it would be worthwhile to excavate these remains with a view to identifying the so-called fortifications. After some preliminary studies I chose the highest mound, which dominated the terrace and could be considered as the highest of the ancient remains at the site. From the beginning of the second day of the excavations we could easily distinguish, at a depth of 30 cm., the remains of mud-brick walls that were still almost totally intact. We stopped using picks and, in co-operation with our more experienced workmen, we continued uncovering the walls, this time with knives and brushes. The result of our excavations was the discovery of a number of corridors, rooms, a vaulted fortified tower and a small central court-all of which helped to make up part of a single fortified point in the continuous defences of the Persepolitan terrace.</page><page sequence="25">SURVEY OF EXCAVATIONS 187 The foundations of these fortifications are of unquarried stones on which are built walls of large mud-bricks, 32 x 32 x 13 cm. in size. Some parts of the walls are made of a mixture of small stones embedded in clay, on which are placed mud-bricks. This is also true of the floors of the rooms and corridors. The slope on which the foundations are laid was only rarely modified or smoothed over. The enclosing wall, like that of the terrace itself, possesses niches which retain traces of arches. These niches would have facilitated surveillance of the royal guards. In the northern wing of the court is a large drain, I -80 m. high, carved in the rock and covered with great flagstones. This drain must have served to let rain water flow away. The door which leads to one of the guard rooms is covered by a cradle vault in which either ordinary bricks or possibly long mud-brick units were used to compose the underside of the vault. The discovery of cradle vaults at Persepolis is of great importance in the reconstruction of the history of Achaemenian architecture. Achaemenian art, in fact, has always appeared to us as a specifically imperial art, designed to glorify the power of the King of Kings. The architectural elements in the palaces of Persepolis and Siisa consist of stone columns supporting a horizontal roof. At the very time that the grandiose palaces of the two principal capitals of Darius and Xerxes were being built, the majority of people lived in mud-brick houses roofed with cradle vaults. The discovery of cradle vaults at Persepolis, the home of high stone columns, supports the hypothesis that the vault was used in Iran concurrently with the flat roofs used for the great palaces. Mr. A. Sami, ex-Director of the Scientific Mission to Persepolis, has also discovered on the terrace itself some cradle vaults which he has published in Vol. II of Archaeological Reports under the title " Excavations in one of the original rooms in the sub-soil of the palace of Hadich " (A.H. I330, pp. 51-2). He found there five fairly narrow rooms and two long corridors. " The roofing of the corridors ", he says, " like that of the rooms, is composed of vaults in mud-brick. On this roof are other buildings on the same level as the eastern rooms. In the corner of one of these rooms was found the base of a cradle vault. Until now one could only assume that vaults existed in the Achaemenian period without being able to give a concrete example." Unfortunately the remains of the cradle discovered by Mr. Sami have disappeared and vaults in modern baked brick have replaced it. We do not even have photographs showing these remains of the birth of a cradle vault in mud-brick. The discovery of identical cradle vaults in a tower of the Perse- politan fortifications becomes even more precious therefore for those who wish to study Achaemenian architecture. Seal impressions in baked earth: North-west of the fortified tower, at the bottom of a staircase in corridor B, were the broken remains of a pottery vase, which must originally have contained the fifty- two seal impressions that were found nearby. These impressions were formerly of crude clay, but all had been baked in a fire that had raged through the room in which they lay. The designs represented in these impressions are most interesting. Some of them show an Achaemenian general (whom one can identify as the King of Kings in person) fighting the enemy. Most of them show a conquered Greek soldier on his knees. Behind the general, three officers take part in the fighting. The general wears Achaemenian costume and with his left hand holds the arm of his enemy, whom he bears to the ground with his lance. The costume of the Greek soldiers is minutely represented. On one impression one sees a fight between a Persian officer and a Scythian general. The Persian grasps his enemy by both hands and forces him to the ground in hand-to-hand combat. The artist has shown all the details on this little impression; he even depicts the weakness of the falling general. The fluting of the tiara worn by the Iranian warrior is visible and the proportions of the figures are well kept. AKBAR TADJVIDI Shahddd In the spring of 1968, with the help of the Geographical Institute of the University of Tehran and the collaboration of Mr. Ali Hakemi, certain archaeological researches were made on the border of the Lit Desert by the Archaeological Service of Iran. The area concerned was situated to the east of Shihdad</page><page sequence="26">188 JOURNAL OF PERSIAN STUDIES (the ancient Khabis) in a locality known as Agous. In the course of a ten-day excavation the mission's team succeeded in discovering a number of tombs of the third and fourth millennia B.c. The grave goods were found to include painted pottery, vessels of stone and copper, and jewellery of silver, agate and lapis lazuli. Of particular interest were several grey stone vases engraved with animal designs including a lion, a bull and other animals. These stone vessels were each beautifully shaped and had been fashioned with great elegance. Similar vases have also been discovered at Sfisa, in Baluchistan and at Kirman. One unusual feature of the site was the absence of superimposed strata; the remains representing different civilizations succeed one another on the infinite horizon of the desert. Every two or three hundred years, each successive culture appears to have established itself elsewhere, usually shifting progressively further west towards more mountainous districts. The violent winds and floods of the Lfit may have encouraged this pattern of movement, just as they may also be held responsible for the severe erosion of the graves and houses of each community. ALI HAKEMI Shahr-i Sokhte The researches on the earliest cultures of Sistan have been continued this year, by enlarging excava- tions on the main Bronze Age site of the region: Shahr-i Sokhte. The Italian Archaeological Mission has been operating for two and a half months (September-November 1969) on an area of over 1200 square metres. The main aims this year were to explore a wider surface of the dense inhabitation area (Periods I-III), to study in all details one more building beside the House of Staircases, concluded in the past season (Period II-III), to increase documentation on the Late Chalcolithic layers (Period I), and to start excavations on the highest point of the mound. With the last aim we intended to uncover a main, well-preserved building, which could provide us with extensive information on the large-scale architecture. Our hypothesis turned out to be correct as at the end of the season we had completely isolated a building, extending for at least 500 square metres, with massive mud-brick walls, rising to a height of over 3 m. Three sides of the building's perimeter had unfortunately been washed off by erosion, but we were able to isolate the fourth one and the south-east corner. This large building represents a new period in the cultural sequence (Shahr-i Sokhte IV), completely undocumented in past campaigns. Period IV marks the introduction of the fast wheel in pottery manufacture; the pottery types are characterized by articulated shapes with straight corners, buff or brick-red in colour, rarely painted, but frequently red slipped or burnished in parallel lines; a much smaller percentage are of black-burnished grayware and buff jars decorated in Late Bamptir style, carrying painted and moulded elements. Period IV appears to be datable to the first quarter of the second millennium and the general evidence shows, notwithstanding the sharp changes, a remarkable cultural continuity in the pottery, as well as in the metallurgical traditions. The plan of the building is a series of square and rectangular rooms, peripheral corridors, straight-sided doors with well-marked sills and two staircases, leading to an upper terrace-store, whose steps have the rims strengthened by timber frames: a technique destined to last for long in the architecture of Iran. The end of the palace was certainly a violent one as the whole of the building shows evident traces of an extensive fire: collapsed beams, wall-plasters and floors fully burnt, broken jars still in situ and finally the dramatic discovery of a human skeleton lying on the floor of the most northern, isolated room. The bones were completely burnt a few hours after death, as is proved by the carbonization of the brain in the exploded skull. The body fell among Period IV buff pottery, and the right hand was still holding a stone pestle. The Palace shows only a single building phase, because directly underneath the burnt floor level, the setting of the foundations cut the deposits of Period II, characterized by buff painted ware. The discovery of a fourth period of occupation, to which can be related the Burnt Palace, completes the cultural sequence of Shahr-i Sokhte. It can now be divided in the following way: Period I: Late Chalcolithic, with bichrome buff and red/black on grey ware, painted with geometric designs. The general picture is very close to that of the Geoksyr Culture (Namazga III of the South Turkmenian Sequence). Among the most exciting finds were three sealings of cylindrical seals of a type apparently very</page><page sequence="27">SURVEY OF EXCAVATIONS 189 close to late Uruk or Jemdet Nasr. Periods II and III: Early and Middle Bronze Age: they show a slow but continuous development of the earlier Chalcolithic models into highly standardized pottery types. Bichrome wares disappear and the pottery classes are limited to black on buff and black on grey wares, with the exception of a polychrome pottery, usually limited to a relatively small number of specimens. Stamp-seals of a compartmented type are widely employed, and frequently occur: clay anthropo- morphic and theriomorphic figurines, various types of metal, timber and stone tools and a wonderful bronze figurine, 29 cm. high, representing a woman carrying a jar on her head, with striking Meso- potamian features (P1. XIa). It was discovered on the surface, but is most likely to relate to these periods, which in terms of absolute chronology could mean the second half of the third millennium. This period has connections with Namazga IV and Bampiir I-IV. Period IV: Late Bronze Age. As already stated, this period sees the end of the painted tradition, the introduction of the fast wheel, new types of stamp seals and anthropomorphic figurines and, apparently, a great increase of architectural skill. On the basis of the pottery found in the destruction level (Level 4), we might associate this period with Bampfir V-VI and even with the Umm an-NMr Culture of the Oman peninsula. Tape Rud-i Biyaban: This mound lies approximately 25 km. south of Shahr-i Sokhte in the middle of the ancient Delta system of the Helmand. It is covered with pottery slugs and wasters, and on the surface at least forty-two large and small pottery kilns can be recognized. In a preliminary excavation four of these were cleaned out. The pottery associated with them and covering the mound can be recognized as of Shahr-i Sokhte III and IV types. Kilns Nos. I and 3 have one chamber, vitrified walls, vaulted roofs and their bases are lined with a vertical row of bricks. An identical technique appears to have been employed for kilns 2 and 4 with the difference that these last two have two fire chambers divided by a vitrified earth pillar and average 5.50 m. in length, twice as large as the other two. Excavation of this unique Bronze Age pottery mill will be resumed on a much bigger scale in the following season and will be used for palaeomagnetic studies for the region on the basis of the wall vitrification. MAURIZIO TosI Sirdf The fourth season of the Institute's excavations at Sirdf began in October 1969 and is still in progress as I write. Aided by generous grants from the British Museum, the British Academy, the Royal Ontario Museum, the Pilkington Glass Museum and others, we are investigating three areas: the Great Mosque (Site B), the residential suburb (Site F) and the pottery (Site D). At the same time we are adding contours to the large-scale map of Sirdf and recording additional buildings, including a small mosque situated in one of the cemeteries. Site B: In 1968 we began to excavate the structures preserved beneath the platform of the Great Mosque (see above, " Third Interim Report ", p. 7). This year we are continuing the work by removing the earth and rubble make-up for the platform, but leaving the piers and foundations of the mosque intact. As the excavation proceeds, it becomes progressively more probable that the remains are those of a single large building, measuring at least 70 x 55 m. We have now exposed some 1300 square metres of the building, revealing an irregular plan consisting of numerous interconnecting rooms and small cobbled yards. In the area excavated, we have fifty-two rooms and four yards, two of which contain isolated piers or plinths (cp. " Third Interim Report ", fig. 3, bay 2F). Beneath the north angle of the mosque, the early walls are unusually thick, suggesting that they supported at least one upper storey, and a room beneath bays 13D-E possesses an apse. Otherwise, the building contains few distinctive features and its identity remains unknown. We still know little about its date. However, finds from the late eighth or early ninth century make-up for the mosque include several earlier objects, notably an intaglio bearing a Pahlavi inscription, and it is possible that the building, which is considerably larger than the Great Mosque, is pre-Islamic. Site F: Work has continued at Site F with the object of investigating the early history of the suburb (" Third Interim Report ", pp. 8-15). In House W, which we excavated in 1967-68 (" Second Interim Report ", fig. 4), removal of the existing floors has revealed the floors and footings of an earlier courtyard house. The early house closely resembles the standing building, although its north wall is</page><page sequence="28">190 JOURNAL OF PERSIAN STUDIES almost 4 m. farther south and consequently the overall length is only 23 m. The house has two entrances the more impressive of which is in the south wall. It appears possible now that the original main entrance to the standing house was also in the south side, beneath the loggia, and that the elaborate north entrance is a later addition. Outside House W, investigation of the mosque has shown that it contains two main periods of building. In the first period a small ablution area occupied the angle between the mosque and the main street. This was demolished in Period 2, when the mosque was enlarged. In House S, excavated last season, we have discovered that the semi-circular pilasters belong to Periods I and 2 (not Periods 2 and 3, as originally believed) and that the building was reconstructed using rectangular pilasters in Period 3. In House R we are recovering the remains of an earlier, and no less irregular, structure. Site D: In 1966 we discovered the site of a pottery near the western edge of Sirgf, in a quarter constructed when the city reached its greatest extent. An exploratory excavation revealed that the site, which was being eroded by the sea, contained numerous kilns and pits filled with wasters (" First Interim Report ", pp. I2-14). This season we are attempting to excavate the entire pottery. It is emerging as a complex of at least five walled enclosures, bounded by the sea on the south side and by streets to the north and west. A sixth enclosure may exist on the east side. Excluding this hypothetical enclosure, which awaits investigation, the surviving parts of the pottery occupy an area of some 1250 square metres. In the north-west angle of the complex is a courtyard house measuring 16 - 5 x 15 - 8 m., which resembles the houses at Site F. Although it may have had a purely domestic function at first, the house was later converted into workshops. A potter's wheel was installed in one of the entrance passages, the rooms in one angle were demolished to make way for kilns and two further kilns were built in the yard. To the south of the house lie two enclosures, one of which is almost empty and presumably served for storing clay, fuel and finished pots. In contrast, the second enclosure is crowded with kilns, a well, a cistern and a workshop. Additional kilns exist in the enclosures to the east and south-east of the house and at present we have excavated a total of twenty-six. The excavation has already yielded a vast number of coarse pottery wasters. It is clear that glazed pottery was also made on the site and the persistent occurrence of glass waste and slag continues to suggest that a glass furnace exists in the vicinity. DAVID WHITEHOUSE Suse et Susiane Les recherches entreprises ' Suse et en Susiane au cours de l'hiver 1968-1969 relkvent d'un pro- gramme de cinq ans qui a pour but d'orienter clairement et de prdparer les recherches a venir. Les essais de synthese prdsentes rdcemment par M. R. Ghirshman et par M. P. Amiet ont permis de cerner les lacunes de notre connaissance et d'en souligner les insuffisances. Des problkmes se trouvent posds. Reste a envisager les moyens de les resoudre de la manie're la plus efficace. Pour cela nous avons dtcidd d'entreprendre, a Suse meme, une exploration extensive, mettant a profit la topographie actuelle du site, au moyen d'operations de contr6le stratigraphique suffisamment 'tendues afin d'Ctablir la continuit6 de la sequence archdologique et culturelle. Simultandment, hors de Suse, nous avons commenc6 un inventaire des nombreux sites archdologiques de la Susiane et de l'ensemble du Khuzistan, recherche realisde avec l'aide du C.N.R.S., en 'troite collaboration avec les chercheurs iraniens et amdricains dans ce secteur. La connaissance du terrain et des ressources offertes nous permettra plus tard de faire pour nos chantiers les meilleurs choix. Des problkmes poses &amp; Suse trouveront peut-8tre hors de Suse leur plus rapide solution. Ainsi esparons-nous dans quelques anndes 8tre 5 m~me de prdsenter un programme cohdrent r~pondant aux questions les plus urgentes. A la campagne 1968-1969 ont participd activement M. I. Nafici, reprdsentant du Service des Antiquitds et des &amp;tudiants de l'Universit6 de Tthdran. Mlle. G. Dollfus et Mlle. M. Lechevallier du C.N.R.S. ont dirig6 la fouille de Djaffarabad et en donnent le compte-rendu ci-dessous. A. Lebrun m'a assistt sur le chantier de l'Acropole. Les autres membres de la mission 6taient F. Vallat, apigraphiste, A. Assaf, prdhistorien, A. Labrousse, architecte, D. Ladiray et Mme. Terry Haass, dessinateurs, Mlle. M. Mignon, photographe. Nous avons eu le plaisir d'accueillir &amp; Suse plusieurs collkgues iraniens,</page><page sequence="29">SURVEY OF EXCAVATIONS 191 anglais et amdricains, notamment ceux des universitis de Chicago, de Michigan et de Houston qui prennent part a la prospection archdologique du Khuzistan. Djafarabad: L'objectif de cette premiere campagne 6tait de reconnaitre la stratigraphie du site. Dans cette perspective, une coupe fut etablie d'Est en Ouest sur une longueur de 20 metres et une hauteur de 6 metres, un peu en retrait de la paroi Nord Est du sondage de 1934. En outre, une tranchde de 12 metres de long, large de 2 metres, ouverte sur la bordure occidentale du tipd, dans le prolongement du sondage 1934, permit d'atteindre le sol vierge. Cinq niveaux d'architecture ont dtd reconnus qui ont &amp;t6 numdrotds du sommet jusqu'a la base de I a 5. L'examen du matdriel a permis de discerner deux phases distinctes, l'une correspondant aux niveaux 5 et 4, l'autre aux niveaux 3 a i. Niveaux 5-4 Le niveau 5, premier niveau architectural reconnu au-dessus du sol vierge se trouve a 7 mitres sous le sommet (13 m); ii est caractdris6 par des sols de terre brilde ou cendreuse, des petits foyers et des murs larges de 0,70 m en briques crues conservis souvent sur 13 a 15 assises. A ce niveau appartient une plateforme large de 2 metres dont le d6gagement n'est pas termind, paisse de deux lits de briques o0 alternent rdgulierement briques brunes et briques vertes (0,40 x o, i I o, I i). Dans le niveau 4, l'orientation des murs reste semblable a celle du niveau 5. Des pi ces rectangulaires ont dtd reconnues. En outre, une banquette en briques, en relation avec un foyer construit, a 6td degagde. Dans ce secteur, un feu intense a cuit les sols, deux assises des murs, et ddposd une 6paisse couche de cendres. Cette couche d'incendie, qui a peut-&amp;tre provoque un abandon du site a ce niveau, a etd reparde en coupe en d'autres points du chantier lors du nettoyage des parois du sondage de 1934. Aucune evolution n'a etd remarqude dans le materiel entre les deux niveaux 5 et 4. En ce qui concerne la poterie, a l'exception d'un grand bassin ovale dont la pate est a degraissant mineral, la c6ramique non peinte, mal cuite et friable, prdsente une tres forte proportion de ddgraissant v6g6tal. A l'intdrieur, paroi et fond sont toujours enduits de bitume. Les types les mieux attestds sont un grand pot a carene situde en bas de la panse (morphologiquement diffdrent du " milkbowl " restitu6 par L. Le Breton dont nous n'avons retrouv6 aucun exemplaire) et un bol " renflement cardn6. Les types de formes et de decors de la ceramique peinte sont ceux d6crits par Le Breton comme " Susiane a": coupes a pied au d6cor incise ou fenestr6, bols ovales a bec verseur, petits bols " bord rentrant. Les d6cors en reserve sont internes et externes et se trouvent sur de grands bols " lkvre 6versde et sur des coupes. Sur les bols ovales h engobe chamois, les lignes croisdes, brunes, formant losange a l'intdrieur desquelles peut exister le motif de l'oiseau en vol sont frequents. Deux types non signalks par L. Le Breton sont d'une part des jarres a paule arrondie, haut col et decor de peinture brune, d'autre part des petits bols h6misphdriques a peinture rouge fugitive. L'outillage en pierre consiste essentiellement en '16ments de faucilles a fine denticulation et en houes fabriqudes " partir de galets fendus et retouch6s sur la face dorsale. Une premiere 6tude de la faune montre qu'a c6td du mouton et de la chevre est present un petit bovide qui serait domestiqu6 (J. Wheeler). Niveaux 3-I De mime orientation que les murs des deux niveaux inffrieurs, ceux du niveau 3 sont moins larges qu'aux autres niveaux et n'ont souvent qu'une brique d'6paisseur. Plusieurs fours ont dtd creusis a partir des sols de ces niveaux, fours culinaires, mais aussi peut-etre pour l'un d'eux, four B poterie (P1. XIb). Celui-ci posside une double paroi en briques recouvertes d'un enduit. II a 1,60 m de diamitre et est conserve sur I,40o m de hauteur. Dans le haut du remplissage, de grandes briques cuites (o,48 x 0,20 x o, Io), de texture grossibre, provenaient vraisemblablement de la sole. Au niveau 2 appartiennent des murs conserves sur I,50 m de haut. Seuls de petits C1lments ont Ct6 mis au jour en avant de la coupe et nous espbrons que de plus amples digagements permettront de restituer le plan des habitations. Une tombe d'enfant a 6td digagde (P1. XIc). Le mobilier fundraire consistait en trois vases et un sceau ddpos6 t la t~te. Bien que la partie supdrieure du niveau I ait Ctd trbs perturbde par de nombreuses tombes rdcentes,</page><page sequence="30">192 JOURNAL OF PERSIAN STUDIES des murs et des sols ont dtd reconnus. Des structures domestiques y sont assocides: foyer entourd de murets de briques crues, four, bassin ovale de I,6o m x o,90 m construit en briques crues posees de champ et dont le fond est constitud aussi par un dallage de briques. Dans I'angle de deux murs se trouvait une tombe d'enfant. Le squelette reposait sur le dos, les jambes replides; le corps 6tait envelopp6 dans une natte et un vase peint 6tait placd ' la tete. La tombe, rectangulaire, est constitute par un rang de briques posees de champ, comme c'6tait aussi le cas pour celle du niveau 2. La couche de surface est 6paisse de I,8o m. Des tessons sassanides y sont mel1s a quelques fragments d' " 6cuelles grossieres a bord biseaut6 ". Les niveaux 3 ' I ont livr6 des gobelets, coupes, jarres miniatures en pate fine chamois ' decor peint qui sont les types bien connus de " Suse A ", de mime que le sont aussi les jarres et les bassins en pate chamois ou rouge "a surface brunie parfois lustr6e recueillie en abondance. Outre les elements de faucilles et les houes deja not6s dans les niveaux infirieurs, un outillage lourd en pierre constitud par des meules, des pilons, des grosses masses polies, des haches, est specifique de ces niveaux. Les figurines animales (oiseau, chien, bovidd, etc....), les fragments de grands cachets en terre cuite, les sceaux en pierre perces longitudinalement, decor6s de caprid6s ou de motifs g6omitriques, complktent cet assemblage. Dans le niveau 2 des graines ont etd recueillies en abondance parmi lesquelles J. Renfrew, lors d'un premier examen, a pu identifier du bl6, de l'orge a 6 rangs vetue, des lentilles et des pois. A la fin de cette premibre campagne, il semble donc d'une part que la stratigraphie indique une occupation continue; d'autre part, que le matdriel se rapporte aux deux phases d6finies jusqu'da present comme " Susiane a " et comme " Suse A ". Il sera donc important de preciser si ces deux phases se succedent sans interruption ou s'il existe une phase de transition. A ce jour, l'examen de la c6ramique ne laisse pas apparaitre de groupe interm6diaire entre la c6ramique des niveaux inf6rieurs et celle des niveaux superieurs. Suse: Acropole. Avant de proc6der a Suse m6me aux ddgagements horizontaux indispensables pour eclairer cette plus ancienne p6riode, il nous a paru n6cessaire d'en 6tablir solidement le fil directeur, l'admirable travail de Le Breton reposant souvent-et la responsabilit6 de cette situation ne lui incombe pas-sur une analyse typologique d'un mat6riel arch6ologique sans contexte stratigraphique suffisant. Avec M. P. Amiet, conservateur du D6partement des Antiquites Orientales du Musde du Louvre, nous avons fait choix pour un premier contr6le stratigraphique d'un secteur de l'Acropole qui paraissait offrir le maximum d'avantages, au pied du tamoin laisse par de Morgan sur la face Nord du " sondage 2 " de Mecquenem et a proximit6 du sondage effectud par M. R. Dyson en 1954 (P1. XIIa). Du sol vierge, retrouv6 au fond de la tranch6e de Mecquenem, a la base de la galerie F de Morgan qui traverse la partie haute du tdmoin, nous reconnfimes sur une hauteur totale de 15 metres 19 strates principales, numdrot6es de 8 a 27 du haut vers le bas. Ces 15 m de debris representent les vestiges de l'occupation de Suse en ce point depuis sa fondation dans la premiere moitid du 4e mill6naire jusqu' a la fin de la p6riode caract6risde par la poterie peinte dite du " style II "; les niveaux superieurs du timoin correspondent a la fin du 3e millknaire av. J.C. Ainsi les coupes de Djaffarabad et de l'Acropole, dans le prolongement l'une de l'autre, nous permettent d6ja un coup d'oeil sur l'ensemble de la periode du 5e millenaire a la fin du 3e mill6naire av. J.C. En consideration de l'aspect de la coupe, les divisions principales s'etablissent entre les niveaux 23 et 22 et entre les niveaux 17 et 16. Dans les niveaux infdrieurs (2 7-23) a poterie peinte de style " Suse I " on peut distinguer une phase ancienne (27-26) correspondant aux niveaux sup~rieurs de Djaffarabad et une phase r6cente (25--23) caract~risde par l'apparition de formes nouvelles et notamment en 25 de bords a lvre roulke et en 24 de cols dejarre a bord pined de fagon a former a l'ext6rieur un filet qui souligne la 1kvre; en 23 apparais- sent de petits bols chamois a lvre coupde en biseau; des fragments d'Xcuelles grossibres se rencontrent dans ce meme niveau, il conviendra de pr6ciser leur appartenance au niveau 23. L'architecture des niveaux 25-23 pr6sente un d6veloppement remarquable. Des murs puissants dans le niveau I21 paraissent devoir 6tre mis en relation avec les grandes constructions signalkes par Mecquenem sur cet horizon auquel R. Dyson attribue encore - a juste titre semble-t-il - la con- struction de la terrasse qui occupe la partie centrale de l'Acropole.</page><page sequence="31">SURVEY OF EXCAVATIONS 193 Le niveau 22 est marqud par un changement d'orientation des constructions qui diminuent d'impor- tance. Les murs sont en brique crue de plus petites dimensions que celle des niveaux sous-jacents. Dans le niveau 19, les constructions ont disparu. Il en est de meme dans les niveaux 18 et 17. Les niveaux 22-17 sont caractdrises par des fosses profondes souvent de plusieurs metres et remplies d' " ecuelles grossi'res a bord biseautd " et d'autres debris caramiques (vases a goulot, th6ieres, vases a anse oreillette; le d6cor peint disparait pour faire place a un d6cor incisd ou a r6serve d'engobe). De nombreux petits foyers sont creus6s dans les sols d'occupation qui portent aussi des traces de piquets. Le niveau 18 est caract6ris6 par l'apparition d'une poterie a engobe rouge lie-de-vin ainsi que par des vases &amp; anse torsadde et des jarres-bouteille a goulot tordu vers le bas. Une premiere 6tude typologique des " 6cuelles grossieres " en fonction de la stratigraphie a permis ' M. A. Le Brun de reconnaitre a c6te du type " classique " present dans tous les niveaux et qui pourrait avoir 6td non pas tournd mais mould sur une forme: dans les niveaux de base une varidtd 1a vre arrondie soulignde a l'extirieur par un filet irrdgulier; dans les niveaux superieurs une varikt6 a bord renfl6 16gerement rentrant a lvre amincie. Dans le niveau 17 toutes les dcuelles tendent a devenir plus hautes et plus 6troites; elles sont faites alors sur une tournette rapide et presentent dans le fond la marque laissde par la ficelle (string-cut) qui a permis de les d6tacher du support. Ces distinctions morphologiques et stratigraphiques sont importantes pour l'analyse du materiel provenant des rdcoltes de surface sur les sites de Susiane contemporains de cette p6riode. Le niveau 16 est marqud par la rdapparition de constructions importantes dont l'ordonnance est conservde dans les niveaux superieurs (15-I4). M^me observation en divers points de l'Acropole. Du niveau 15, correspondant a un rdaminagement des constructions du niveau prec6dent, provien- nent des tablettes proto-l1amites d'une 6criture ddja plus dvolude que celle des plus anciens documents de Suse. Cest ablettes, copides par M. F. Vallat, prdsentent l'une un motif decoratif nouveau ' Suse, l'autre, sur les deux faces, une empreinte de cylindre montrant des animaux manipulant des vases. Ces tablettes sont associkes dans le niveau 15 a un cylindre des tdatite brfilde, a des vases et a une figurine en albatre et a une poterie bichrome rouge et noire a d6cor instable encore en usage dans le niveau 14. Le niveau 15 a livrd galement de nombreux objets en m6tal, armes et outils, et en particulier un hamegon en 6vidente relation avec les nombreux ossements de poissons qui jonchent a ce niveau le sol de plusieurs chambres. Cette operation a l'Acropole sera poursuivie au cours des deux prochaines campagnes. Elle apparait prometteuse en ce sens qu'elle permettra de reclasser une bonne partie du materiel archeologique provenant de la tranchde de Mecquenem. Elle permettra ensuite, par l'6tablissement d'une strati- graphie fine, de pr6ciser la relation de chaque niveau avec ceux des sites de Basse M6sopotamie et le sens des dchanges sur l'horizon des pdriodes d'Ourouk et de Djemdet Nasr au moment ofi l'6criture fait son apparition et ofi s'affirme le caractere urbain des agglomdrations. La fouille qui porte sur 200 mi, est suffisamment 6tendue pour donner une idle de l'dvolution technologique, economique et culturelle au cours des periodes dont elle traverse les vestiges. L'impres- sion qui pour l'instant pr6vaut, impression confirmde par des observations en divers points du tell, est que le processus d'urbanisation qui s'amorce, semble-t-il avec les manifestations architecturales caracterisant la fin de la premiere p6riode de Suse (niv. 25-23) marque peut-etre ensuite un ralentisse- ment sur l'horizon de la pdriode mdsopotamienne d'Ourouk. Les installations legeres qui remplacent partout les constructions de la ptriode pr~cddente, si elles n'indiquent pas ndcessairement un ralentisse- ment du progrbs technologique, paraissent impliquer le passage i une Cconomie a pridominante pastorale, succddant t l'dconomie mixte des agriculteurs dleveurs qui ont fondC la premikre agglomdra- tion de Suse. La structure sociale et le mode de vie de ces populations auraient constitud des conditions moins favorables au ddveloppement du processus d'urbanisation. Suse: Apadana. Sur le tell de l'Apadana, oi furent entrepris avec la participation du Service Iranien des Antiquitds des travaux de prdsentation des vestiges encore visibles, furent faites quelques observations. Ainsi B l'Ouest de la cour occidentale du Palais achdminide, A 0,75 m de profondeur, fut d~gag6 un mur de briques cuites lides au bitume dont l'orientation fait avec celle des murs du Palais un angle de Io?. Ce mur se trouve pris dans la terrasse artificielle qui supporte le Palais; il est i la hauteur du</page><page sequence="32">194 JOURNAL OF PERSIAN STUDIES sommet de la butte dlamite qui constitue le noyau de la terrasse artificielle qui supporte le palais ach6minide. Ce mur est au meme niveau que les fondations de colonnes en pierre mises au jour par Mecquenem dans la cour Est du Palais ainsi qu' avec des 616ments de construction en brique cuite et bitume (MDP XXX, pp. 17 et 55) B l'angle S.O. de la terrasse. Si cette relation etait v6rifide, nous aurions la un ensemble d'616ments architecturaux appartenant a une construction d'une orientation lgerement diff6rente de celle du Palais et fondee t 2,50 m au dessous. On serait tent6 d'y voir des vestiges d'un palais antdrieur a celui que nous connaissons a l'Apadana. Cependant, 1'6tude stratigraphique de la terrasse dans le secteur du mur que nous avons ddgag6 montre que ce mur n'appartient pas " une construction ruinde qui se serait trouvie englobde dans le massif de la terrasse que l'on aurait alors surdlevee. Ce mur repr6sente simplement a ce niveau le debut de r6alisation d'une construction dont le projet initial fut rapidement abandonnd, tandis que l'on ddcidait de surdlever la terrasse de 2,50 m environ. Cette op6ration s'effectua dans un laps de temps tres court puisque les gros murs de brique crue ou de terre pisee qui formant caissons quadrillent en le contenant le gravier de le terrasse, reprennent exactement dans la partie haute, au dessus du mur 701, le plan des murs de la partie infdrieure. Le coffrage de ces murs, lorsqu' il existe, ne montre aucune solution de continuit6 la terrasse artificielle constitue un tout. Cette terrasse mesure en ce point Io m de haut. Elle s'appuie a 1'Est contre la butte dlamite centrale dont le flanc a 6td entam6 puis rectifie par un mur de briques crues. Elle repose a 8 metres seulement au dessus des eaux du Chaour, sur des couches creusdes de tombes 61amites de la premiere moitid du IIe mill6naire av. J.C. La salle hypostyle a et6 nettoyde. Dans l'angle N.O., les fondations de briques cuites du mur, large de 5 metres, s6parant la salle des portiques latdraux, ont dtd degagdes. L'existence de ce mur, mise en doute par certaines reconstructions, avait ddja dte 6tablie par M. Ghirshman. Les vestiges actuels ne permettent pas de reconnaitre l'emplacement des portes (P1. XIIb et c). Les fragments sculpt6s dpars a travers le palais ont Wt6 regroupas en un musde lapidaire; des mesures de conservation provisoires ont 6td prises pour certaines pieces. J. PERROT Takht-i Suleimdn (Pls. VI-VII) Die Ausgrabungen des Deutschen Archiologischen Instituts auf dem Takht-i Suleiman in Aser- beidschan wurden mit Unterstiitzung der Deutschen Forschungsgemeinschaft in der Zeit vom 5. 7- bis 12. 9. 1969 fortgesetzt. Ziel der Arbeiten war eine weitere Klarung der zeitlichen Abfolge von iuBeren und inneren Umfassungsmauern, die Vervollstandigung des GrundriBplanes der Lehmzie- gelanlage westlich neben dem Feuertempel, die Untersuchung der achimenidischen Siedlung unter dem Lehmziegelgebiude und die Feststellung sasanidischer Bebauung in der siidlichen Halfte des Takht-Plateaus. AuBerdem waren in einigen Rtumen und H6fen n6rdlich des Feuertempels und am groBen Westiwan Nachuntersuchungen notwendig. Umfassungsmauern: Ein im Jahre 1968 begonnener Suchschnitt hinter dem Turm 18 der diuBeren Ringmauer wurde bis zur nordwestlichen Eckbastion der, das quadratische Tempelareal n6rdlich des Sees umfassenden, inneren Mauer erweitert. Er brachte die alte, m6glicherweise vorsasa- nidische Lehmziegelmauer zutage, die vor der Erbauung der steinernen Ringmauer die Hiigelkuppe umschloB. (s. Iran VII (1969), S. 192.) Die Lehmziegelmauer hat an dieser Stelle die ungew6hnliche Stirke von mehr als 15 m, und ihre klar erkennbare Innenkante weicht in ihrem Verlauf leicht von dem der steinernen Ringmauer ab. Beide Beobachtungen sind vielleicht dadurch zu erklaren, daB die Sondage einen Befestigungsturm der alten Mauer schneidet. Die Mauerkonstruktion besteht aus einem mehrere Schichten hohen Sockel aus unvermorteltem Bruchstein und einem noch etwa 7 m hoch anstehenden Lehmziegelaufbau (durchschnittl. Ziegelformat 45 x 45 x 1O cm). Eine starke, jedoch nur wenig Keramik enthaltende Aschenschicht am FuBe der Mauer ist von Lehmziegelschutt uiberlagert. Offenbar nach einer langeren Verfallszeit, vermutlich in der spitsasanidischen Periode, wurde die steinerne Ringmauer vor die AuBenseite der Lehmziegelmauer gesetzt und, nicht notweni- gerweise gleichzeitig, die innere Umfassungsmauer angelegt.</page><page sequence="33">SURVEY OF EXCAVATIONS 195 24 23 I s \\ \ 27 ', \ 2a' ?~~50.70\ * , 13 oil \3 20 0 0 100 200 3000. id I I 139 T. ?

Als friiheste bisher auf dem Takht-Plateau festgestellte Kulturschicht wurde eine im Vorjahr gefundene, ach~menidische Siedlung weiter freigelegt. Ihre unregelmiBigen Raume und H6fe werden durch Feldsteinwinde gebildet, die ein sehr sorgfaltig gesetztes Fischgratenmauerwerk auf flach gelegten Fundamentschichten zeigen. Einige Raume sind mit groBen, gut zusammengepaBten Steinplatten gepflastert. Wiederum fanden sich neben Mauern oder in Mauerwinkeln in den Felsboden gehackte Grabgruben, auBerdem Erdbestattungen und ein Kindergrab in einem Mauerzug. Die Skelette weisen Anzeichen nachtraglicher Umbettung der Toten auf. An Grabbeigaben wurden Arm- und Ohrringe aus Bronze, dreifliigelige Pfeilspitzen und Glasperlen geborgen. - Wdhrend auf das achimenidische Stratum eine mehrere Jahrhunderte dauernde Unterbrechung in der Siedlungsgeschichte des Platzes folgt, zeigen die dariiberliegenden Bebauungsperioden eine bis ans Ende der zoroastrischen Benutzungs- phase reichende Kontinuitit. Die erste nachachamenidische Anlage ist ein ausgedehnter Gebaude- komplex mit Lehmziegelwinden (durchschnittl. Lehmziegelformat 45 x 45 x 10 cm) auf Feldstein- fundamenten, dessen Grundplan hiufig abegindert, in seiner Disposition jedoch nie aufgegeben wurde. Als Kern dieser Anlage laBt sich ein Viersaulenraum mit quergelagertem Vorraum und schmalen Seitenkammern an der Nordseite eines vermutlich ungedeckten Vorhofes erschlieBen. Vier Raume eines magazinartigen Traktes, der einer groBangelegten Erweiterung auf der Westseite des Vorhofes anzugeharen scheint, wurden freigelegt. Ihre FuBb6den haben Ziegelpflaster, ein Ofen sowie Metall- und Schlackenriickst~nde lassen auf BronzegieBerei schlieBen. - Von einer schwer erfaBbaren Umbauperiode wurden Lehmziegelwinde ohne eigenes Steinfundament, Becken mit Ziegelwandungen und mit Gipsm6rtel verputzte Podien freigelegt. Offenbar wurden groBe Teile der ersten Anlage, die in einer Brandkatastrophe untergegangen zu sein scheint, durch neue Lehmziegelbauten ersetzt, wahrend die Kerngebaude nur unwesentlich verindert wurden. - Der bedeutungsvollste Wandel begann mit der Errichtung der groBen Pfeilerhallen aus Haustein und Ziegeln (PA und PB), welche vor den zunichst weiterbestehenden Viersaulenraum und seine Seitenkammern gesetzt wurden. Ein sicheres Baudatum iiBt sich noch nicht geben, es kann jedoch nicht nach der friihen Regierungszeit Xusr6 I liegen. In der Folge wurde auch der Viersiulenraum durch Steinbauten ersetzt und iiber den westlich angrenzenden Lehmziegelgebiuden gew6lbte Steinbauten errichtet. Die gr6Btenteils gut erhaltenen Steingebaude wurden nahezu vollstindig freigelegt. Dabei fand sich in dem schreinartigen Kuppelraum (PD), welcher den Vierstiitzensaal des Lehmziegelgebiiudes ersetzt und den AbschluB der Saalfolge PA-PB bildet, ein dreistufiger, quadratischer Sockel von 1,65 m Seitenlange mit der Stand- fliche eines siulenf6rmigen, gerundeten Schaftes, wahrscheinlich der Unterbau eines groBen Feueral- tares. Sowohl der Altarsockel als auch weitere Fragmente von Feuerschalen und kleinen Feueraltiren, die in und neben den Pfeilerhallen gefunden wurden, weisen dem Gebiudekomplex eine sakrale Funktion zu. Der Befund in den westlich angrenzenden Raumen und H6fen IdBt vermuten, daB gemeinschaftliche Mahlzeiten zu den Zeremonien geh6rten. Die Pfeilerhallen waren bereits im 9. Jh. n. Chr. weitgehend zerst6rt, wahrend die sie im Norden abschlieBenden Raume (PC u. PD) noch im 12. Jh. eine Wiederherstellung erfuhren. Areal n6rdlich vom Feuertempel: Das kleine Torgebiude (N) des groBen Vorhofes auf der Nordseite des Feuertempels wurde freigelegt. Es ist in islamischer Zeit durch Zumauerung des Haupteinganges und der westlichen Seitentiir in ein Wohngebaude umgewandelt worden. Der ursprtinglich quadratische Innenraum wurde durch eine Querwand geteilt, die FuBbiden mit Stein- platten belegt. - In einem neben dem nbrdlichen Eingangsiwan des Feuertempels gelegenen Raum (K) wurden zwei FuBb5den aus Sandsteinplatten und Ziegeln aufgedeckt. Ein Tiirdurchbruch zum Innenraum des Feuertempels ist m6glicherweise schon in sasanidischer Zeit angelegt worden. - In dem zum Feuertempelkomplex gehorenden Arkadenhof E wurden die Reste einer in islamischer Zeit errichteten Quermauer entfernt. Darunter lagen in der Hofmitte und vor den 6stlichen und westlichen Arkadenmittelpfeilern Fundamentierungen aus vermirteltem Bruchstein. Der istliche Arkadenpfeiler wird in FuBbodenhohe von einer 50 cm hohen, rechteckigen Offnung durchbrochen, deren Zweck unbekannt ist.</page><page sequence="35">SURVEY OF EXCAVATIONS 197 Seerandbebauung: Eine im letzten Jahr angeschnittene Eckbastion unmittelbar siidlich des Westiwankomplexes lieB vermuten, daB der See ebenso wie der Tempelbezirk von einer bastionen- bewehrten, inneren Mauer umschlossen war. Bestitigung brachte ein Suchschnitt auf der Westseite des Sees. Es wurde eine Mauer freigelegt, die sowohl in ihrer Konstruktionsweise als auch in ihrer Flucht dem westlichen Flfigel der inneren Umfassungsmauer n6rdlich vom See entspricht; sie ist zweischalig, so daB im Mauerinneren ein Korridor entsteht. Im FuBboden des Korridors lag eine sasanidische Silbermfinze (Xusr6 I, 1.-5.

In islamischen Schichten wurde qualitatvolle Keramik vor allem des 9.-13. Jh. n. Chr. gefunden. Neben den Grabungsarbeiten wurden umfangreiche Restaurierungen vorgenommen. Dank der Hilfe der iranischen Antikenverwaltung konnten besonders gefihrdete Teile des Feuertempels und des groBen Westiwans gesichert werden. DIETRICH HUFF Tepe rayad The second season of excavation at Tepe Yahyd, supported by the National Science Foundation, Ford Foundation, and the Peabody Museum of Harvard University, was carried out between June 6th and August 24th 1969. This year's excavations concentrated almost exclusively on the horizontal exposure of Periods I, VI-VIII (see Iran VII, 1969). Period I: The top of the mound is capped by a substantial citadel identifiable as Partho-Sasanian. Ceramics consist dominantly of large storage jars with incised and raised motifs. Finer wares of plain buff slip or plain orange-red ware remain in the minority, as does a greenish-blue glazed ware. Of considerable importance was the recovery of a substantial amount of painted fine ware, a black paint on yellowish-buff. This ware was found in considerable quantity in a number of different areas all contextually datable to this period. This type of ware, we believe, has previously been identified as " Londo ware ", but incorrectly attributed to the early centuries of the first millennium B.C. It is characterized by hanging spiral curls and naturalistic motifs. Its clear stratigraphic association with Sasanian pottery and objects, i.e. a rock crystal Gayomard-type seal would appear to mark it as an early centuries A.D. ware or perhaps the last century B.c. A single plain red ware sherd, most probably from a large storage jar, contains an incised inscription tentatively identifiable as Pahlevi. A considerable quantity of iron in the form of a shaft-hole axe, daggers and trilobate arrow heads was also recovered. Decorative belt buckles and ornaments of bronze also appear in limited quantity. A considerable amount of glass, including some whole glass cosmetic vessels, were found. Architecturally this period incorporates large-scale construction of brick- extending platforms from an outside containing wall. The several rooms exposed all contained numerous large storage vessels with potter's marks broken in antiquity. In the centre of this complex, excavation revealed the presence of a well-a considerable feat for securing water from the bottom of a</page><page sequence="36">198 JOURNAL OF PERSIAN STUDIES 20 m. high mound. Considerable work remains in unravelling the complex stratigraphy and archi- tectural configuration of this apparent citadel construction. It would appear from the evidence at hand that its history would extend from the last centuries B.c. to the early centuries A.D. A series of radio- carbon dates will be submitted for both this period as well as all others. In future seasons, work will continue on this period while the completed excavation will allow us next to expose the Achaemenian settlement lying directly below and identified as such in the 1968 excavation. Period VI: Excavation of this third millennium settlement proved most rewarding. A large quantity of carved steatite bowls and objects were recovered. The incised motifs incorporated curvilinear and geometric designs; triangles, hachures, rectilinear designs; architectural scenes, faqades of doorway (hut-pot), and windows; as well as animal figures. These types of steatite incised bowls have been found on several sites in Mesopotamia and dated to E.D. III. At Tepe Yahyd we have examples of almost all previously known motifs and several new ones. The presence of unfinished beads, stamp seals, bowls, etc., of steatite indicates that these objects were locally made. The above objects of unfinished variety are also found in finished form, including a number of steatite stamp seals. A double-axe (shaft- hole variety) had carved on each side of the wing an eagle-a common motif on Sfisa D pottery and on cylinder seals of the late and middle third millennium. The presence of a very fine cylinder seal from this period also argues to the mid- to late third millennium. This seal appears to have its closest parallels with Akkadian type seals incorporating a vegetation god (?) with palm fronds extending from the shoulders and hands folded before the waist. Two almost identical carvings of the same personage wearing a horned helmet with hair tied in a bun are depicted in excellent workmanship. A single etched carnelian bead has also been found of the type found in the Indus and Mesopotamia; while a few fragments of ivory may have served for beads or inlay. The presence of this material is of considerable importance in shedding new light on the commercial relations between south-eastern Iran with the areas to the West as well as to the East. Analysis of the pottery necessitates further work. Ready parallels, however, can be seen in the painted wares of Bampuir (later levels) as well as the site of Shahr-i-Sokhta, while more distant parallels may be suggested at Mundigak, as well as at Sialk IV. The 1969 season provided a single C-I4 date for the lowermost of three architectural phases of this period; a somewhat high date of 3246?465 B.C. (WSU 876). The lower range here of 2780 B.C. could, however, be acceptable. An extensive series of dates has been submitted for the three phases of this period. Architecturally we have exposed domestic buildings, a single kiln, and what appears to be a very substantial wall around the latest settlement. The latest occupation of this period would appear to date to the end of the third millennium, and sees the virtual disappearance of painted pottery. Plain wares, many incorporating elaborate potter's marks, with three or four such marks on a single vessel, bear a striking similarity to the proto-Elamite signs evident at Sialk IV. With the extensive evidence for parallels both ceramic and in other materials to the West, on the one hand, and the East on the other, one cannot help thinking of the larger question of third millennium trade communications, the role played by early Elam, and the identification of elusive Magan. Certain it is that this occupation at Yahya during the third millennium has direct bearing on all of the above. Period VII: Continued work in this period clarified the stratigraphic order of the building levels and added a very considerable understanding to the architectural complexity in the construction of the fourth millennium settlement. Pottery is dominantly a painted black on red ware with a continuation of some of the earlier chaff-tempered coarse wares. Metal chisels, awls and pins, obsidian blades, marble bracelets and bowl fragments, turquoise beads, finely carved mother-of-pearl pendants and animal figures, and clay stamp seals were found in an extensive exposure of domestic architecture. There is a complete absence of any fortification wall about the settlement at this time. A single C-I4 date of 3630+410o B.c. (WSU 872) would be acceptable but for the consistently high ? reported for our dates by this laboratory. (The cause for this has yet to be satisfactorily explained by the laboratory.) The wonderfully preserved architecture, all of a domestic variety, the extensive horizontal exposure and clear stratigraphic association of the materials throughout this and the earlier Period VIII promise to add a considerable understanding of the late fourth millennium. Period VIII: Three major superimposed architectural levels, each with identifiable phases of rebuild, have been uncovered for this period. There is an obvious cultural continuity in these earliest</page><page sequence="37">SURVEY OF EXCAVATIONS 199 levels, observable in both ceramic continuity and architectural construction and orientation. Walls are constructed of variably sized thumb-impressed brick (chaff tempered) and bound in walls by a chaff tempered mud mortar. Rooms are of a consistently small size, hardly ever exceeding I -5 In. square. Often there is no visible access or doorway, while the inside of the rooms and floors are rarely plastered, as is common in Period VII. Evidence of reed impressions in mud brick-bats found on the floors of some of the rooms suggest the manner of roofing. Material found in the dozen odd rooms of the earliest level do not suggest either the function or the activity carried out in these small rooms. This small size would seem to eliminate them as living areas while there is no evidence for them being used for storage. A coarse chaff tempered " soft ware " is consistently present in each level. However, there may prove to be a significant difference after quantification of the ceramics is carried out. Surface treatment: plain red ware, red slipped ware, burnished red slipped, plain buff with red wash and/or fugitive red painted meandering lines, are associated in the same level. However, different percentages of associa- tion can be noted through the different levels together with obvious increases and decreases in the percentage of certain types through time. In the second building level and apparently restricted only to this level, we noted numerous examples of a bichrome painted ware: black and red painted geometric motifs on a fine buff slip. This pottery is without apparent parallels. A wide variety of different coloured flint was used for the production of tools. This material still awaits further analysis. The earliest excavated level appears to be contained by a wall, which was further clarified this season, necessitating a correction from last year's report which viewed the wall as considerably larger than its almost 2 m. width determined this year. A single C-I4 date of 4302 ?- 18o B.C. (GX-1509) can be reported from the 1968 excavations for the fourth level of construction, VIIID. Virgin soil was reached at the base of the mound beneath the lowermost excavated architecture (VIIIE), which we suspect dates from no earlier than the middle of the fifth millennium. The clear association of a wide variety of different type materials in good stratigraphic context and associated with archi- tectural configurations promise to add considerably to our understanding of Iran in the first and third to fifth millennia. C. C. LAMBERG-KARLOVSKY II. SURVEY SECTION Tepe Abdul Hosein During our excavations at Bdbd Jan in 1969 we visited Professor Ghirshman's mound of Tepe Jamshidi, which lies in the southernmost part of the plain of Khawa close to the pass at the southern end of the Nehdvand valley. Our attention was drawn to a second mound lying about half a kilometre away from the main tepe above a huge spring which must form one of the main sources of the River Khawa. The sides of the mound had been extensively quarried away by the villagers revealing the lower strata. These consisted of deep bands of charcoal and occupation debris containing flints, but not a scrap of recognizable pottery until at least the top third of the mound was reached. The flint industry (see Figure), as represented by a random surface collection from both top and sides of the mound, falls within the Ganj Dareh, Sarab and Asiab range. Finely prepared pencil-shaped blade cores are smaller than those generally present at the sites mentioned. The small blade artifacts include backed blades, obliquely truncated blades, notched blades, and a single blade broken with secondary retouch and signs of polish along one edge. A single denticulated flake tool was found. Geometric microliths were not represented. No obsidian was found and the stone is mostly chert of good quality. The many mountain streams in the vicinity of the site are a possible source for the stone. An eroded side of the mound showed a mud-brick wall and a series of well-defined charcoal lenses in section. Fragments of unidentifiable bone were also visible in the section. Protected on one side by a mountain range and lying in an open and well-watered valley the area is ideal for sheep and goat herding. Over 40 m. in diameter, and approximately 6 m. high, the mound is at least as large as Ganj Dareh or Tepe Sarab.</page><page sequence="38">200 JOURNAL OF PERSIAN STUDIES The pottery, which appears to be later than the main deposit described above, comprises a coarse, heavy, straw-tempered ware, with red slip. Simple bowl rims predominate. Similar pottery has been picked up on numerous tepes between Harsin and Khorramabhd. CLARE GOFF and JUDITH PULLAR South- West Khurdsdn From June to August 1969 B. J. Spooner, V. C. Pigott and J. Bockstoce of the Department of Anthropology and the University Museum of the University of Pennsylvania conducted an archaeo- logical surface survey in the south-west of Khurdsin. The survey covered the areas of the shahristdns of Kashmar and Tabas from the city of Kashmar in the north to the village of Naiband in the south, and was undertaken as part of a long-term research programme concerned with the cultural ecology of the desert and semi-desert regions of eastern Persia from prehistoric to modern times. A series of eight mounds was recorded and sherded in the relatively fertile plain west of the city of Kashmar. The pottery was largely Islamic but preliminary analysis suggests that some of it probably dates back to the first millennium B.C. No other sites likely to yield evidence of pre-Islamic occupation were located anywhere else in the region, but numerous forts and mines were noted which would be likely to repay further investigation by an Islamic historian/archaeologist. BRIAN SPOONER Second Millennium Sites in Khazistdn The pottery sequence for this survey was developed from studies of unpublished pottery from Haft Tepe and the study collection from Professor Ghirshman's excavation of the Ville Royale at Suisa.</page><page sequence="39">SURVEY OF EXCAVATIONS 201 This was then employed in field surveys in four areas: (i) Deh Lurdn; (2) central Khizistdn; (3) Ram Hormuz; and (4) the region between the Duveyrij and Karkheh rivers; the last of these was only briefly investigated. Dek Lurdn: In this area six possible Elamite sites were discovered out of a total of 293 sites surveyed. The most important, Tepe Mussian, is the largest early second millennium site outside of SUsa. Pre- liminary ceramic analysis indicates that the centre of settlement in the Deh Lurdn area had shifted from Tepe Mussian to nearby Tepe Goughan by the last half of the second millennium. Study of the second millennium Elamite pottery recently excavated at Tepe Farrukhdbad should provide a more precise dating of the Deh Lurin sites. S%%  SDeh Luran 4%% % % %% % % % % SHorffwz Amms SH z yed, m m Sce 10 20 0 0 io 20 30(ai Central Khazistdn: In the second area surveyed, a total of fifty-four sites, observed by Adams to belong to the second millennium, were re-surveyed: several new Elamite sites were found. Slightly to the south of the area of Adams' survey a major Elamite site was found on the Karun river near the Golestan suburb of Ahwiz. A comparative study of pottery from Haft Tepe and Srisa indicates that Haft Tepe may include a phase not well represented in the Ville Royale, chantier A, at Sisa. Despite the possibilities of regional variation and functional differences of town quarters investigated, it may be speculated that at this time the centre of settlement shifted from Srisa to Haft Tepe. Outside of SUisa there is no major settle- ment (and few minor ones) which belong to the early part of the second millennium, but by the last half of the millennium the number and size of the sites expand. A high percentage of these major late second millennium sites lie on the banks or in the flood plains of the principal rivers. This expansion may well have been based on the control and use of the major rivers of Khfizistan. 17</page><page sequence="40">202 JOURNAL OF PERSIAN STUDIES Rdm Hormuz: The third area, in and around the town of Ram Hormuz, was surveyed with Dr. Henry T. Wright of the University of Michigan. Seven of forty sites surveyed were dated to the second millennium. They were characterized by a non-compact, often black cored, buff slipped buff ware whose colour ranged from reddish to brownish to greenish buff. The ware was often decorated with simple geometric designs in black-brown or red-brown paint placed on the vessel shoulder and/or rim. Final publication of the pottery from Tell-i-Ghazir excavated by Dr. D. E. McCown may give a clearer picture of the time range of this ware. It is uncommon in central Khizistan or Deh Luran (the Khtizistdn survey produced only seven sherds on four sites and none were found in the Deh Luran survey), but a few sherds have been found in the recent Haft Tepe excavations, where the ware has been tentatively dated to the middle of the second millennium. A few painted sherds from Sfisa which are said to resemble those of Giydn III(i) (Arts Asiatiques XIII (1966), p. Io) have not been examined by this investigator; thus it is difficult to compare them with the Haft Tepe and Ram Hormuz painted sherds. To judge from the illustrations (ibid., fig. 24) there are differences. In any case the distribution of this ceramic should prove interesting. Surface finds in the area included an inscribed brick and a tablet fragment from the major second millennium site in the region, Tepe Bormi. The Duveyrij and Karkheh Rivers: The fourth area between the Duveyrij and Karkheh rivers was only briefly investigated. Preliminary investigation here shows a number of promising prehistoric sites as well as several early to middle second millennium sites. More intensive work is planned, possibly in late 1970. ELIZABETH CARTER The Deh Lurdn Region The primary purpose of the reconnaissance and associated limited excavations was to provide a basic fund of information for an intensive study of the prehistoric and early historic water control and irrigation systems. Other than the few sites recorded through the pioneering reconnaissance undertaken by Gautier and Lampre (J. E. Gautier and G. Lampre, " Fouilles de Moussian ", MDP VIII (1905), pp. 59-148) and the limited survey by Hole and Flannery (Frank Hole, " Archeological Survey and Excavation in Iran, 1961 ", Science CXXXVII, no. 3529 (1962), PP. 524-6), the locations and relation- ships of sites representing the various periods of occupation on the Deh Lurin plain were unknown. The area surveyed surrounds the presently inhabited small town of Deh Luran and extended into the lower foothills of the Kih-i-Siyah to the north, those of the Ktih-e-Qutbeh (Jebel Hamrin) to the south, and a short distance west of the Mehmeh river and east of the Duveyrij river (see map accom- panying preceding report). This forms a roughly rectangular-shaped zone some 26 x 45 km. in maxi- mum dimensions and approximately I ooo square kilometres in area. Although most of the final analysis remains, it is evident that the 1968-69 survey of the Deh Lurin plain has largely succeeded in fulfilling the objectives of the research proposed. The following repre- sents only a brief list of our discoveries. (I) A total of 293 archaeological sites and features, including water control and irrigation features, was recorded. This represents an estimated 8o per cent sample of the total number visible on the surface of the plain. This percentage was derived through the intensive coverage of about 70 per cent of the Iooo square kilometres originally designated for study. (2) The sites and features recorded provide evidence of continuous human occupation from at least as early as the Bus Mordeh phase (c. 7500 B.c.) well into the Islamic period (c. A.D. 1300). (3) New techniques enabled us to define the periods of occupation of individual sites and, in many cases, to define the period represented at one particular point on the site and to observe the direction(s) in which the site expanded or " grew ". The survey techniques employed also served to define or predict functionally specific activity loci, which consisted of ceramic kiln areas, flint knapping areas, glass manufacturing areas, smelting areas, burial areas, habitation areas of apparent differing social rank, possible areas of political and religious activities, etc. (4) The reconnaissance produced detailed information concerning settlement patterns and community patterns of each of the cultural phases of the region. Such information pertaining to the Sasanian and Islamic periods is complete because of alluviation, which has been great enough to</page><page sequence="41">SURVEY OF EXCAVATIONS 203 preserve the architectural remains of the inhabitants but has not as yet accumulated to the point where it masks the structures. While perhaps more apparent than real, due to the quantities of alluvium covering earlier occupations of the plain, the Sasanian and Islamic periods seem to have witnessed a dramatic population expansion. This is reflected not only through a sharp increase in the number of sites, but also in the construction of sites and irrigation features in areas that had apparently previously not been inhabited, or only very sparsely so. (5) Much information was derived relating to the form and function of water control and irriga- tion systems. The Sasanian and Islamic systems are the most fully exposed. However, the possibility for recovering nearly comparable data for earlier systems seems quite likely pending future selective tests. While actual features and the techniques utilized remain unknown, there is good floral evidence (Frank Hole, Kent V. Flannery, James A. Neely, op. cit., pp. 406-09) that some form of irrigation was in use as early as the Sabz phase (c. 5500-5000 B.c.). The earliest irrigation features yet discovered on the Deh Luran plain apparently date to the early part of the Uruk period. These consist of dams built across small, now intermittent drainages and canals leading from these dams to terraced fields paralleling the drainage channels. In succeeding periods the use of waters from the Mehmeh and Duveyrij rivers permitted an increase in the areas irrigated and a concomitant growth of the canal systems. The first construction of qanat systems apparently took place during the Achaemenian period, or perhaps earlier. Qandt systems are present in both the " classic " form, taking water from the ground- water table or from aquifers, and in a modified version where the system is used to tap water from the deeply incised rivers. The latter form served to filter out much of the alluvium carried by the rivers as the water seeped through the river banks into the systems. The Sasanian and Islamic periods may have witnessed the greatest use of irrigation in the history of the region. Both large and small canals and qandt systems were built. (6) The survey has presented an opportunity tentatively to date and to define the typological nature and cultural context of " utility ware " ceramics. (7) Based primarily on the ceramic assemblage, but also including architectural, settlement and community pattern information, it seems possible to define an early and a late phase of the Uruk period in the Deh Lurdn region, which correspond with cultural developments in parts of Mesopotamia (Henry T. Wright-personal communication). (8) The distribution of Achaemenian sites across the Deh Luran plain in a general north-west- south-east direction has led to the tentative location of the Achaemenian " Royal Road ". The identifi- cation is pending the study of historical documents and aerial photographs. (9) An extensive study of the soils from throughout the Deh Luran plain by the Drs. Kirkby, the project's geomorphologists-geographers, indicates that, unlike our previous findings (ibid., pp. 19-20), only a relatively small portion of the region was adversely affected through the use of salt-bearing waters for irrigation. These findings correspond well with those of the survey-an apparently continuous and intensive occupation of the plain as well as the intensive and widespread use of irrigation through- out the later prehistoric and the historic periods until about A.D. 1300. JAMES A. NEELY Islamic Monuments in Kirmadn and Khurdsdn Provinces In the summer of 1969 surveys were undertaken in Kirmin and in Khurashn with the intention of examining known Islamic monuments and locating hitherto unpublished ones, both in the provinces and the routes giving access to them. A number of monuments were visited and studied which have already been recorded in various publications, but from a further study of plans and photographs it is hoped that additional information can be obtained which may be published at some future date. Certain monuments were, however, noted which have either not been previously recorded, or merely noted in passing reference. In Athdr-e' irdn I (1936), M. Andr6 Godard noted the portal surmounted by two minarets attached to the little mosque of Imam Hasan in Ardistin. When Godard saw this monument only one of the two minarets remained: this is now considerably shorter. He described this portal as being that of a Seljuq</page><page sequence="42">204 JOURNAL OF PERSIAN STUDIES madrasa, now disappeared. The small mosque alongside however, which contains the remains of a stucco mihrdb, may well also be part of the original madrasa. Although now very ruinous, sufficient remains of the mihrdb (P1. VIIIa) to show that it must have been important. As yet it has not been possible to decipher the remains of the inscriptions, but certain of the patterns, notably that in the centre of the remaining central arched panel, can be paralleled on the outer decoration of the portal, and also in the nearby Seljuq Masjid-i Jami', as well as in the Khwaja Atabek in Kirman. The Ardistin Masjid-i Jdmi' also contains three mihrdbs having similar foliate patterns to the remaining outer bands of the Imam IHasan mihrdb. The brick pattern in the adjacent alcove would appear to confirm a Seljuq date for the building. In the same article Godard mentions the Masjid-i Pamenar at Zavare, but dismisses the Mongol stucco work there as being of no importance. Donald N. Wilber also mentions this stucco in the Architecture of Islamic Iran: the II Khanid Period, although he was unable to visit the mosque. Further examination reveals that the stucco in question consists of six mihrdbs and surrounding decoration extending as far as the soffits of the arches, much of which is of extremely fine work. A detailed study of the stucco in the mosque, and the possible Seljuq work which it overlays, is planned for the future. Some 3 km. to the east of Nayin is the town of Muhammadiyya in which Godard noted two small mosques of the type which he calls Iwdn-e Kdrkha and of one of which he published a plan in L'Art de l'Iran. This mosque, which Godard calls the Masjid-i Muhammadiyya and which is also known as the Masjid-i Sar-i Kiicha, contains a very fine painted Kaific frieze which runs round the entire interior of the mosque (P1. VIIIb). Godard dated these mosques to the fourth and fifth centuries of the Hijra and it would seem possible that the inscription dates from the same time. It is hoped to undertake further study of this inscription in the near future. Some 6 km. to the south-west of Mahan on the road to Chtipar is a small hitherto unrecorded monument which would appear to be a Timiirid mausoleum (P1. IXa). Local tradition ascribes the tomb to Shaikh 'Abd as-Salam, the teacher of the Shaikh Nfr ad-Din Ni'mat Allah who died in 1431 and whose tomb is nearby at Mahan. Although the mausoleum is in a somewhat ruined condition, the dome is intact and much of the original tilework still remains. The dome is of baked brick with patterns formed by light and dark bricks, the top of the dome being in light buff coloured bricks below which a series of light buff lozenges depend against a band of darker bricks. The high drum is ornamented with inlaid tiles each tile being of a single colour and inlaid separately. Below the dome is a band of inlaid Kiffic lettering, below which the drum is encircled with lozenges, each lozenge containing a single word in square Kafic. The tomb chamber is situated immediately below the dome and has a domed plaster ceiling. Adjoining the central tomb chamber is a further single chamber containing another tomb. These two rooms would appear to be all that remains of the original mausoleum, the entrance portico and adjoining room being of more recent date. On the outer wall of the secondary tomb cham- ber is a simple form of mihrdb. The mausoleum is surrounded by an enclosing wall, one side of which still retains the arcading which probably originally encircled the enclosure. The deserted town of Bam east of Kirmin, was studied and plans made, including detailed plans of the Masjid-i Arg, the Citadel, the main gate of the town, and one of the large private houses near the mosque. Particular notes were made of a large Safavid mihrdb in the Masjid-i Arg which had a finely traced and intricate star pattern, as well as an inscription frieze. In Gurgin, formerly AstarIbAd, the Masjid-i Jami' contains a minaret which is of considerable interest (P1. IXb). Local tradition insists that the minaret is older than the mosque and is in fact Seljuq. The form of the minaret is typical of the Mazandaran area, but certain ornamental details would tend to confirm its Seljuq dating. The inscription is framed above and below by a band of ornament which is typically Seljuq; the brick measurements, 20 cm. long by 3 cm. thick, as measured in the thickness of the wall inside the window, conform to Seljuq standard sizes; and the plain brickwork of the lower section with the spacing left between the horizontally placed bricks is typical of Seljuq workmanship, although the patterned area has a pattern which cannot immediately be matched in other Seljuq minarets. A recent Iranian publication, Fihrist-i bindhd-yi tdrikhi va amdkin-i bdstdni-yi Irdn, refers to the minaret as Seljuq, but the form of the letters of the inscription is unique and has not yet been read. Rabino makes no mention of this inscription in his work Mdzandardn and Astardbdd, although he spent some time in the</page><page sequence="43">SURVEY OF EXCAVATIONS 205 mosque and deciphered all the other inscriptions. The brick pattern is in many respects similar to that of the nearby Imdmzdda Nilr, to which a fourteenth century date is assigned. At Sabzavar, known in earlier times as Bayhaq, the Masjid-i Pdmenar has a minaret which can be assigned to the Seljuq period. The inscription, which is composed of cut brick, is almost completely illegible (P1. Xa). The brickwork patterns of the minaret are typically Seljuq and can be paralleled in many instances, although the interstices between the bricks have recently been filled with mortar so that the pattern is less distinguishable. The pattern bands above and below the inscription represent an unusual form of cut brick and if the mortar can be cleaned away from some of them, may give us a new Seljuq brick design. An unusual early squinch form was noted at the Ghaznavid caravanserai of Ribat Mahi, some 80 km. east of Mashhad (P1. Xb). This caravanserai, originally called Ribat Sdhi, was first noted by Godard in Athdr-6 Irdn IV (I949), although he did not visit it. The first photographs appeared in an article by Derek Hill in the LL.N. of August I3th 1966, and again in the second edition of Islamic Architecture and its Decoration by D. Hill and 0. Grabar (1967). The simple semi-dome of the squinch at Ribdt Mdhi is bisected by a cannular groove which runs from the apex of the main squinch arch to the corner angle of the dome chamber below the zone of transition. It may be significant that the brickwork of the arch and semi-dome of the squinch is corbelled and that the lobes of the squinch are purposely separated. It would therefore appear that, in this context, the cannular groove had a specific function rather than being a decorative element, since the line of separation lies along the line of maximum stress of the squinch. One might suggest that the separation of the lobes subsequently evolved into the trilobed squinch. This evolution would be possible in that Ribat Mahi was probably built in 1020-21 and therefore antedates the Duvdzdah Imim at Yazd by nearly twenty years, the squinch at the Duvdzdah Imam always being considered the earliest dated form of the trilobed squinch, and as such the precursor of all subsequent Seljuq squinches. ANTONY HUTT Islamic Monuments in Northern Iran In August and September 1968 a preliminary survey of the imdmzidas of Gilan and western Mdzandardn was carried out. About forty shrines and towers were visited, of which only a very small proportion were of architectural interest. In three imdmzddas, two of them hitherto unpublished, extensive frescoes were recorded, with subjects similar to those on the tomb of Shah Zaid at Isfahdn. South of Rasht the overgrown Qal'a-yi Rfidkhdn, mentioned by Rabino, was visited, as well as the remains of a fine brick bridge, and a well-preserved minaret with decorated brick patterns. Both the latter monuments, which are in the neighbourhood of Minar-i Bdzar, are of uncertain date, though it is unlikely that they are earlier than the Safavid period. The funeral towers of Amul which still remain standing were planned and recorded, including one on the Mahmildabdd road which is apparently unknown. This, like another unfamiliar tower recorded at Kaman Kola just north of Amul, can probably be dated in the fifteenth century. A much earlier dating, possibly in the eleventh century, seems required for the delightful circular red brick tomb tower locally known as that of Darvish Muhammad, near Pul-i Safid, though its shattered sarcophagus is probably roughly contemporary with that of the nearby imdmzdda at Silt Kola, dated 1429. In the course of October 1969 some little-known buildings to the south of the Caspian provinces were visited, among them the possibly eleventh century " Pir " tomb, a domed square at Takistin near Qazvin. This was thoroughly recorded with plans and sectional drawings. The same was done for the mausoleum locally known as the Mazar-i Sipahsalar (P1. V), some 20 km. from Tabas, which demon- strates the widespread popularity of the large open tomb with an intermediate storey below the dome. Externally the building bears a remarkable resemblance to the Mongol mosque at Aziran, the eleventh century tomb at Sangbast (before its recent restoration), and, more distantly, to the Saljuq Jabal-i Sang. It is also closely linked to open mausolea in the area to the north and east of Mashhad, though its material-largely mud-brick-and its limited internal decoration suggest that it is probably later than the Mongol period to which these open mausolea have been assigned, perhaps fifteenth century. The complete lack of tilework would be quite exceptional for a building of this scale in later periods.</page><page sequence="44">206 JOURNAL OF PERSIAN STUDIES Nearby, the Masjid-i Jum'a of Firdaus was recorded. Though badly damaged by the 1968 earth- quake, it has retained most of its single iwdn, whose arch still stands. The elegantly incised brickwork, and lavish use of red plaster, rather than faience, to achieve a wider palette suggest a date around 1200. This is supported by striking resemblances to the mosque at Zuwzan, though at Firdaus the occasional pieces of faience (there is no mosaic faience as at Zuwzan) are still only used for the grace notes of the composition, rather in the manner of the Gunbad-i Surkh at Mardgha. R. HILLENBRAND Islamic Trade Routes in Southern Iran From September 1968 till May 1969 a survey was undertaken in the course of research into the trade patterns of southern Iran in the medieval period. The area investigated included much of Kirman, of Fdrs except the Kilrah of Arrajdn, and a reconnaisance of Sistan. Importance was attached to the identification of sites along historically attested trade routes. A total of 370 mounds was visited, mainly of the Islamic period. In addition material from 21o sites discovered by Mr. W. M. Sumner in the Kur river valley was classified and sites with medieval pottery were revisited. A special attempt has been made to identify pottery kilns and production centres, which have been located at over a dozen sites, those of the greatest importance in the medieval period being at Sirjdn, near Istakhr and near Hormuz. The products of the identified kilns and of other centres were distributed in strikingly clearly defined regions which overlap very little. The Persian Gulf coast and the garmsir (the " warm land " area predominantly of date cultivation) formed an essentially homogeneous unit characterized by wares of types common in Mesopotamia and found stratified at SirMf, while pottery from the inland centres was exceptionally rare. In the interior three principal pottery distribution areas can so far be distinguished. The ceramics of the Kur river basin and the adjacent plains were dominated by wares made in the kilns near Istakhr. The central plains of Kirmdn and eastern Fdrs were served by kilns centred at Sirjan. Desert Kirman and Persian Sistdn form an independent region with characteristic pottery types. In the absence of a stratigraphic chronology, such as the excavations at Sirdf provide for the coastal regions, it is not possible to make any fine chronological distinctions in the pottery, but it does appear that the distribu- tion of ceramics was determined principally by natural lines of communication rather than by fluctua- ting political boundaries. Indeed, in southern Iran long distance trade overland in pottery seems to have been unknown except during the period of florescence of the " Saljuq " lustre ware kilns of the central plateau; though great cities such as Sirjdn, Kirman, Istakhr and Jiruft enjoyed imported luxury wares at all periods. On the coast, however, pottery and glass were transported long distances in large quantities. Even pottery of low value such as the coarse ware bowls from the Sirdf kilns' is found as far distant as Minib (over 500 km. away). Far Eastern pottery and porcelain were used in great quantities especially in the period after the introduction of" Chekiang celadon ",2 and on several sites comprise over 90 per cent of all glazed ceramic. Yet outside the garmsir very few Far Eastern sherds have been found at any site except Sirjin. In the period of the prosperity of Sirdf before the introduction of " Chekiang celadon " the three sites of Sirjan, Istakhr and Kirman city are the only inland mounds with even a few Oriental sherds. The forty-two sites in the interior with fragments of later celadon or blue and white only yielded a total (excluding Sirjan) of ninety-one sherds. In comparison, over 10,000 Far Eastern sherds found in the garmsfr testify to the importance of maritime contact with the East from the earliest Islamic period. An investigation of oyster middens on the Persian Gulf coast dated by associated pottery and glass seems to indicate that the pearl beds which played such a major role in the economic structure of the region have moved little since Sasanian or at the latest early Islamic times. Accounts of several caravansarai and other buildings discovered in the course of this work are being prepared for publication. The prehistoric material is currently being studied by Mr. W. M. Sumner. 1 David Whitehouse, " Excavations at Siraf; First Interim Report ", Iran VI, p. 16A a This first appears at Sirdf in period 4: ibid., p. 17; " Excava- tions at Sirdf; Second Interim Report ", Iran VII, pp. 59-6o.</page><page sequence="45">SURVEY OF EXCAVATIONS 207 It is hoped that during the next year the survey can be completed along the entire coastline of Kirman and Fdrs, as well as extended inland especially around the great medieval city of Sirjan, whose site was located during this year's survey.3 ANDREW WILLIAMSON ADDENDUM Tureng Tipde Les fouilles de 1969 ' Tureng T6p6 ont eu un double objectif: d'une part poursuivre l'exploration du tip6 principal (" Mound A " de Wulsin), d'autre part dlargir le sondage entrepris precedemment dans la region SW du site, qui avait r6v616 l'existence de couches plus recentes qu'Hissar IIIC. Ce dernier objectif nous a amends h' fouiller une surface de 00oo m2 proximit6 des carr's EI et E2. Plusieurs couches de la p6riode Tureng T6p6 III C2 ont et' atteintes et nous nous sommes arrAtis au moment oi furent rejoints les niveaux mieux connus de la periode Hissar III C (= Tureng Tep6 III CI). Divers edifices de brique crue ont 6t6 decouverts, dont l'un 6tait fonde' sur un lit de grosses pierres et de galets. La ceramique 6tait assez abondante et confirme les conclusions auxquelles nous avions pu aboutir precidemment, en ce qui concerne notamment le r61le de la plaine de Gorgan ta l'origine des cultures ta ceramique grise qui apparaissent dans le nord-ouest de l'Iran durant la seconde moiti6 du IIe mill6naire. En particulier un fragment d'un bec a jabot analogue ta ceux de Khorvin et d'autres sites a ft6 pour la premiere fois decouvert dans cette region de l'Iran. Des 6chantillons de charbon de bois ont pu etre prdleves. Par ailleurs nous avons relev6 dans les briques crues de ces sondages d'assez nombreux tessons de petite taille, ta decor noir sur fond d'argile rouge lissde, analogues a ceux qui avaient d6jit et ramassis dans le carr6 E2. II apparait d6sormais que cette cdramique pr6sente d' troites analogies avec celle d'Ismailabad-Cheshmeh Ali. Malheureusement la couche d'habitat correspondante ne pourrait etre atteinte qu'au prix d'un effort considerable d'assechement de la nappe d'eau souterraine. Le tepe' principal a 6td l'objet de plusieurs operations distinctes. Nous avons en premier lieu continue la fouille du plus profond des sondages de 1967 et atteint finalement la base des couches sassanides : il s'avere desormais que celles-ci correspondent exclusivement at la derniere p6riode de l'histoire de l'empire. Il est probable que les forteresses qui se sont succedd au sommet du tipe ne sont pas ant'rieures F l'entreprise de fortification de la frontiere septentrionale ' laquelle se consacra Chosrois ler (531-79). La fouille de ces forteresses elles-memes a 6td poursuivie dans le quart NW du tepe; des murs de brique crue, temoignant de nombreux remaniements, mesuraient plus de 5 m d'epaisseur. Le materiel etait malheureusement tres pauvre. Dans ce meme secteur NW la forteresse la plus recente avait 6t6, apres une longue periode d'abandon entamde par une fosse carrde, de quelque Io m de c6te, dans laquelle un remblai d'argile tres fine avait 6te tass6 pour servir de soubassement 't un edifice islamique. Celui-ci, entierement stuque, comportait quatre iwan qui se faisaient vis a vis de chaque c6to d'une cour pourvue en son milieu d'un idicule carrC t colonnettes de stuc. De nombreux remaniements ont ensuite alt6r6 la physionomie de cet edifice, que l'on peut probablement dater du Xe, at la rigueur du XIe si&amp;cle de notre are. La c~ramique y 6tait rare; toutefois un fragment 6maill6 vert fonc6 t mouchetures bleues a 6t6 dtcouvert entre deux couches de stuc. Or de nombreux vases de cette cat6gorie ont ?td trouv6s dans des fosses qui, aprbs l'abandon de cet edifice, l'ont travers6 en plusieurs endroits. Dans ces fosses une abondante et magnifique cdramique a 6t6 relevte; plusieurs vases comportaient une inscription en caractdres pseudo- coufiques qui devraient dater du Xe ou du XIe si&amp;cle. D'ailleurs la c~ramique dite de Gorgan, t decor bleu noir sur fond bleu, n'y 6tait pas reprdsent&amp;e, si ce n'est peut-etre par un unique tesson. Il est probable que tous ces vases proviennent d'un autre batiment, t peine plus recent que l'edifice gt iwan, et qui se situerait dans la moiti6 est du tip. a The site is different from that mentioned by Sir Percy M. Sykes, Ten Thousand Miles in Persia (London 1902), pp. 430 ff.</page><page sequence="46">208 JOURNAL OF PERSIAN STUDIES Enfin plusieurs sondages ont 6t6 entrepris sur la pente sud du tep6 de fagon 'a en 6tablir la strati- graphie complete. Sous les niveaux sassanides, nous avons atteint quelques couches caracterisees par une ceramique extremement sonore, rougeatre "a taches noires, qui pourrait dater de l'6poque parthe. Imm6diatement en dessous se situe le grand batiment brflle dont les ruines sont visibles tout autour du tepe; nous avons pu toutefois constater qu'apres sa destruction par le feu cet edifice avait ete recon- struit au moins une fois. La ceramique permet de dater ces constructions de l'Age du Fer: elle ressemble a celle qui a 6t6 trouvee au sommet du " Mound C " et qui est probablement de peu anterieure a 1'poque achemenide. Il n'est donc pas exclu que ces batiments gigantesques soient eux aussi des forteresses, que l'on pourrait songer a dater de la periode made. L'un des objectifs de la prochaine campagne sera de preciser la chronologie de ces niveaux intermediaires entre l'Age du Bronze et l'6poque sassanide. Pour le moment on peut 6tablir comme suit la succession des cultures qui ont laiss6 des vestiges ' Tureng Tepe: IA: culture de Jeitun; IB: culture d'Ismailabad; IIA: ceramique grise de type Hissar II et ceramique noire sur rouge de type Shah Tep6 III; IIB: ceramique grise de type Hissar II; IIIA-III CI: civilisation d'Hissar III. III C2: derniere phase de l'occupation a l'Age du Bronze, posterieure ' Hissar IIIC (XVIIe-XVIe siecles ?) ; IV: Age du Fer (VIIe-VIe siecles?); V: epoque parthe (?); VI: fin de l'empire sassanide (VIe-VIIe siecles); VII: batiment islamique au sommet du grand tep6 (Xe-XIe siecles); VIII: vestiges islamiques au sud-ouest du site (XIIIe si&amp;cle).
