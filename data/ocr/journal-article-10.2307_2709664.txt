<plain_text><page sequence="1">PLANCK, KUHN, AND SCIENTIFIC REVOLUTIONS BY HERBERT W. GERNAND AND W. JAY REEDY Hans Kangro recently noted in some biographical remarks that Max Planck's philosophical addresses and papers (written 1908-1947) "have received scarcely any historical appreciation."' This is strange since no- tions of the discontinuous, culture-contingent development of scientific knowledge currently receiving so much attention were, it will be argued, suggested decades ago by Planck. Issues and impasses parallel to the ones he broached are the subject of ongoing controversy, especially as they pertain to the writings of Thomas S. Kuhn. But proper attention has not been focussed on the sundry sources of this recent, post-empiricist phi- losophy and sociology of science.2 It seems appropriate, therefore, to examine at last the extent of Planck's underappreciated anticipations of these trends and their problematic. During the greater part of the nineteenth century most men of science accepted as ultimate the timeless, presumably nonhypothetical model of knowing nature set forth by Newtonian physics. However, the question of precisely how science "knows" and why changes occurred in its knowl- edge was disturbing, particularly in a historically-minded Germany where idealist philosophies had held sway. It was above all Ernst Mach who turned to these topics in 1883 when-in the aftermath of the tenets of G. R. Kirchoffs mathematical physics-he used a genetic method of analytical exposition in his key treatise, Die Mechanik in ihrer Entwick- lung historisch-kritisch dargestellt (1883).3 For many years a professor of physics at Prague, Mach pursued interests in physiology and psychology as well as in physics. These investigations prompted his quasi-positivistic view which, inimical to German Idealism, denied the possibility of going beyond measurable observations to "things-in-themselves." On the one hand Mach put observational statements and their relations, rather than "spiritualist" dialectics, at the center of his philosophy of science; on the Hans Kangro, "Planck, Max," in C. C.

William C. Dampier, A History of Science (4th ed.; Cambridge, 1979), 294-95. Mach's book was translated as The Science of Mechanics (LaSalle, Ill., 1893). "Economy" in science should be "the completest possible presentation of facts with the least possible expenditure of thought." We "should beware lest the intellectual machinery, employed in the representation of the world. . ., be regarded as the basis of the real world" (ibid., 587, 611). Cf. Erwin N.

GERNAND AND W. JAY REEDY other hand he conceded that scientific discoveries were frequently brought about by "thought-experiments" (e.g., Galileo on inertia in dynamics) that proved quantitatively confirmable.4 Small wonder that the opera- tionalist pragmatist, William James, praised Mach while the semiotic pragmatist, C. S. Peirce, who emphasized thought-experimentation through an analysis of "abduction" in science, reproached Mach for his emphasis on sensory data.5 Mach's dismissal of metaphysics concerned not only abstract mechanical "forces" and causal necessity (a la Hume) but even the nonobservable "atom." His critiques appealed to many- among them the young Einstein-and fed the verificationist syntactics and therapeutic semantics of the Vienna "logical empiricists" (e.g., Rudolf Carnap) during the interwar years.6 One scientist attracted by the methodological housecleaning spon- sored by Mach and positivism was Max Planck. While a young professor at Kiel (1885-1889), he consciously considered himself an adherent of that philosophy, but he gradually abandoned full-fledged positivism.7 In 1889 Planck moved to the University of Berlin and, though his unor- thodox theory of heat was ignored by all wings of the academic "estab- lishment," came under the influence of Hermann von Helmholtz. One of his professors twelve years earlier, Helmholtz was among the later nineteenth century's most respected physicists. Like the younger Mach, whom he influenced, Helmholtz also pursued research in physiological psychology.8 While laboratory experiences led the latter, too, toward empiricist presuppositions and away from the Hegelianism of Erdmann, 4 Cf. generally John T.

For he allows thought no other value than that of economizing experiences. This cannot for an instant be admitted.

Despite his awareness of recently imagined non- Euclidean geometries defying Kant's forms of space and time, Helmholtz regarded the "transcendental" categories posited by the "critical philos- ophy" as consistent with the psychology of scientific construction he accepted. Thus, he became a proponent of the "back-to-Kant" movement which, beginning in the 1860's with Otto Liebmann, gained momentum over subsequent decades even as it broke into several groups with varying readings of the master's corpus.?1 We shall see, however, that Hegelianism, suppressed in one form, would return in another in Planck's own "dia- lectical" efforts to explain scientific change while promoting a realist postulate about nature's symmetries. Under this Berlin influence, Planck abandoned crude positivism, re- jecting the idea that conventions of measurement, theory as description or correspondence rather than consistent explanation, could represent the whole of knowledge in science. He came to believe instead, echoing Ludwig Boltzmann, that measurement must be considered in relation to an anterior template.11 In short, he was convinced that positivism, rather than accounting for stability within changing theory, avoided the issue. Science, in some part, is the time-bound creation of practitioners' fallible hypotheses, Planck believed. This fallibility bred the mistakes but had also permitted the inspired understanding of earlier scientists. In this regard he provided a more generous appraisal of "thought-experiments" than the positivistic Machians: It is wholly absurd to maintain that an intellectual experiment is important only in proportion as it can be checked by measurement; for if this were so, there could be no exact geometrical proof.... The intellectual experiment carries the mind of the investigator beyond the world ... to perceive new laws even when these do not admit of direct measurement. [It] is not tied down to any limit of accuracy, for thoughts are more subtle than ... electrons.... Admittedly, an 9 Cf. John E. Toews, Hegelianism (Cambridge, 1980).

JAY REEDY intellectual experiment is an abstraction; an abstraction, however..., is essential to the experimenter....12 Science's propositions are not completely cumulative because not all of them were, or ever would be, logically explicable or equatable with the perceptible. In Planck's mature opinion the essence of rational thinking aimed at deciphering the underlying order of things and involved more conceptual contributions than dogmatic positivism admitted.13 Science was actually deeply anthropomorphic in Mach's sensationalist episte- mology. But inquiry over the long run could not rewardingly be conducted without the acceptance of a "higher kind of reality." By that phrase Planck was referring to his definition of a Weltbild ("world-picture"). A commitment to rationalism and realism had to be immune, as a professional sine qua non, from scientific communities' variations of time, place, and milieu, and independent from faulty ob- servations and deviant flights of fancy. Theory was irreducible to phe- nomenal data; it must be presumed connected in some way to the "things- in-themselves." He was reaching for a balanced definition of science in which the empirical, the rational, the pragmatic, the cultural, the tem- poral, and the ideal occupy interactive niches. In the years following 1908, after his fiftieth birthday and his momentous work on quantum theory, Planck embellished his conception of a "world-picture" and of how science changes.14 In this he appropriated the notion of the Welt- anschauung ("world-view") plumbed by his historian-colleague, Wilhelm Dilthey. Another admirer of Kant, though never a full-fledged "Baden" neo-Kantian, Dilthey joined Helmholtz on the faculty at Berlin in 1882, well before Planck's arrival. To address the question of change in Western civilization's ideas and values, Dilthey sharpened the heuristic device of 12 Philosophy of Physics, tr. W. H. Johnston (New York, 1936), 77-78. "Logical thought by itself does not suffice.... The only possible method consists in immediately gripping the problem....

Thiele, "Ein zeitgenossisches Urteil fiber die Kontroverse zwischen Max Planck und Ernst Mach," Centaurus, 13 (1968): 85-90. A standpoint related to Planck's on this issue has been propounded in Norwood R. Hanson, Patterns of Discovery (Cambridge, 1958). 13 Planck adds that "not all statements which lack a logical foundation are scientifically worthless" and protests against a "short-sighted formalism" (Scientific Autobiography, 148). He disapproved of the monistic materialism of Karl Vogt and others too; cf. ibid., 81. 14 Planck, Original Papers in Quantum Physics, tr. D. Haar and S. G. Brush and ed. H. Kangro (New York, 1972).

However, Dilthey was not strongly concerned with the natural sciences. He conceded, with little ado, that "objective knowledge" could be attained in such investigations. His own interest was justifying the "relative independence" of the human sciences. The latter, he insisted, sought not to discover causal connections between empirical facts but to uncover the patterns of meaning made by mankind. Still, as Michael Ermarth has warned, "Dilthey did not main- tain that there is an ontological chasm between mind and nature, nor an absolute epistemological cleavage between the human and natural sci- ences; the difference is emphatic, not absolute."16 According to Dilthey, the process of living inevitably produces a mental orientation which conditions a person's future conduct and concepts. Human existence is mastered by the individual's integrating diverse "life-events" into an intellectual basis for dealing with experiences. The Weltanschauung is a coherent interpretation activated by a thinker's immersion in a "spiritual" (geistig) vision. It is neither "phenomenal" nor "noumenal" but an in- teraction of those realities, a hermeneutical synthesis of perceived facts coordinated by the teleology implicit in every world-view. Its center is a holistic belief system rather than the observational information or stark calculus of natural science. Diltheyan analysis of world-views eschews static "objectivity" in physics, focuses on the culture-bound variables that are part of all human knowledge, and turns to empathetic understanding (Verstehen). Furthermore, the dissonances found in the thought patterns of a certain person or age became catalysts for new world views and thus, for Dilthey, the driving force behind the history of ideas.'7 Whether taking it strictly from Dilthey or not, Planck accepted this manner of grasping the protean character of scientific practice and sci- ence's historically fitful growth. He adapted it especially to the intellectual activity of the scientist in his community. Planck's "world-picture" is a man-created depiction, different from both the metaphysically "real" world and from sensory data in that, as a product of educated hypotheses, it is open to endless alterations."8 Here there is a difference from traditional 15 Michael Ermarth, Wilhelm Dilthey: The Critique of Historical Reason (Chicago, 1978), 104. 16Ibid., 323-26. 17 Wilhelm Dilthey, Gesammelte Schriften (18 vols.; Stuttgart, 1914-1977), VII, 86.

Indeed, Planck portrays the hypothesizing scientist as dependent, like the artist, on the "eye of the spirit" in spite of our indispensable "physiological tendencies towards con-</page><page sequence="6">474 HERBERT W. GERNAND AND W. JAY REEDY Weltanschauunglehre, because the Planckian world-picture is a vocational segment of the wider intellectual typology informing the physicist's quest. While the Weltanschauung of Dilthey was assumed to alter through time without acquiring the incremental advances of empirical science, Planck's Weltbild is within scientific reason itself but it is hardly less relativistic. Responsive to unforeseen facts and unalgorithmic intuitions though sci- entists are, without the Archimedean anchorage of a Weltbild, they can never achieve the nonrelative truths outside themselves in nature's laws.19 Planck lowers the vocation of science into the maelstrom of history and imagination while insisting on the world-picture as a "transcendental" and a "practical" structure of presumptions held by the profession. Buf- feted by the historical, the world-picture nevertheless provides an ex- traempirical imprimatur-cosmic orderliness-for guiding ongoing inquiry. Though in such a dualistic formulation features of Dilthey's Weltanschauung are readily apparent, Planck blurred the neo-Kantian epistemological line separating the human from the natural sciences.20 His originality in this, together with its attendant impasses, retrospectively resembles the orientations proffered by Michael Polanyi, Norwood R. Hanson, Stephen Toulmin, and particularly, Thomas S. Kuhn. Since there is surface similarity between Kuhn's "paradigmatic" van- tage on the history of science and the aperqus of Max Planck, a broader comparison is now needed. Kuhn, in The Structure of Scientific Revo- lutions, acknowledges the attractions for him of the writings of Alexandre Koyre, Emile Meyerson, Jean Piaget, B. L. Whorf, and J. B. Conant. He also credits Ludwik Fleck's long-neglected Entstehung und Entwick- lung einer wissenschaftlichen Tatsache (1935) with stimulating his explo- rations into the relation of scientific communities to their ideas.21 A familiarity with Fleck's treatise suggests that Kuhn's interest in the so- ciological character of "facts" could indeed have been promoted by the earlier writer.22 But Kuhn has informed us that he had not read Planck's philosophical essays before publishing Structure.23 It is in this same in- stitutional salient of the Kuhnian perspective, nevertheless, that the res- structive picturing which are a feature of the activity of ... sense-organs" (Where Is Science Going?, 93). 19 Hans Kangro, "Max Planck," 14. 20 Planck, Where Is Science Going?, 86-87.

At least one of Planck's points about science's collective psychology of conformism, as the single citation to him in Structure indicates,24 was clearly known by Kuhn. We contend that, whether a direct borrowing can be traced or not, Planck's remarks about the non-inductive and non-deductive facets of science as an historical pursuit are convergent with Kuhn's own. As noted above, Planck presented the tentative "world-picture" as an intersubjective construct through which scientists get their cognitive bearings.25 Science is always tentative and unfinished. Not nature's but science's structure is transitory. Discovering no ready-made or revealed laws, science must form them and reform them artificially.26 Planck's own career experiences dictated his recognition of physics as a contact with the environment perceived, mediated, and structured by a prior model, which, corrigible in detail, is committed at all historical moments to the decipherment of natural order. This archetype embodies rational "values" about the cosmos that are productive of the specific theories sanctioned by experimentation. It constitutes a "third-world" of meanings and symbolic intelligibility bridging the mental and the material and entails a "realist"/deist foundation, either explicit or concealed.27 In being shaped by imperfect minds, this archetype is subject to comparatively superficial metamorphoses, theoretical derivatives issuing from the pos- tulate of order.28 The Weltbild functions in science as the idealized co- ordinator of empirical reports, demonstrative theorems, and potent speculations. It inhabits the standards of sound theory (what Kuhn has since called the monitoring "five ways" of accuracy, consistency, scope, simplicity, and fruitfulness) no less than perennial suppositions and hopes (what Gerald Holton has referred to as "themata").29 Planck admitted 24 "And Max Planck, surveying his own career in his Scientific Autobiography, sadly remarked that 'a new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light, but rather because its opponents eventually die. . .' "(Structure, 151). The quote comes from Scientific Autobiography, 33-34. 25 Planck, A Survey of Physical Theory, 25. 26 Planck, The Philosophy of Physics, tr. W. H. Johnston (New York, 1936), 14-17. 27 An airy theism appears in Planck's 1937 lecture, "Religion und Naturwissenschaft," the English version of which is in Scientific Autobiography, 151-87. Suggestively, Planck frequently mentions Leibniz and the assumption of "pre-established harmony" in the universe. He was also a correspondent of the historian of theology, Adolph von Harnack, and of the Biblical critic and moralist, Albert Schweitzer. A good discussion of Planck's religiosity is in Stanley L. Jaki, The Road of Science and the Ways to God (Chicago, 1978), 166-80; also cf. F. Herneck "Bemerkung zur Religiositait Max Plancks," Physi- kalische Bldtter, 16 (1960), 382-84. 28 Cf.

JAY REEDY that the veracity of the rational world-picture cannot be definitively verified. Nonetheless, the procedural checks of the profession sooner or later validate which interpretation of the phenomena is most conjunctive with a well-ordered vision of the data.30 The Weltbild acts as touchstone of reality's determinate symmetries because it is exempt from mankind's freedom to err and ignore.31 It is Nature with scientists' idiosyncracies and historical dead-ends "bracketed-out."32 While Newton and other natural philosophers of the modern era had demurred at elaborating a world-picture, Planck insisted that what they curtly called the "world" was the "third world," the Weltbild.33 Though Kuhn does not define the term "paradigm" very precisely in his Structure, Planck's "world-picture" is plainly a terminological analogue.34 Kuhn says that a paradigm is a specific scientific community's set of theories, a "disciplinary matrix" conveyed through education in that discipline's most "exemplary" theoretical model.35 At stake is a vocabulary that serves the profession as a prescriptive set of expectations in the same way that Planck's "picture" does.36 Kuhn's paradigm is a "body of accepted theory" imparted to "an enduring group of adherents," yet "sufficiently open-ended to leave all sorts of problems" for resolution. In elucidating "paradigm," Kuhn refers to historical instances, just as did Planck: By choosing it ["paradigm"], I mean to suggest that some examples of scientific practice ... provide models from which spring coherent traditions of scientific research. These are the traditions which the historian describes under such rubrics as "Ptolemaic astronomy" (or "Copernican"), "Aristotelian dynamics" (or "Newtonian"), "corpuscular optics" (or "wave optics"), and so on.37 Like the human side of the Planckian world-picture, it is perpetually mutable, always liable to adjustments large and small.

Kuhn describes normal scientific activity as the exploring of a par- adigm's obscure corners, an investigation within preconceived parameters, a prodding of predictive capabilities, and the further honing of a model.38 All of these "normal science" pursuits-what the average scientist does- reside just as comfortably within Planck's discussion of scientists' typical activity.39 In discussing the evaluative complexity of research he declares, Any scientific idea arising in the mind of a scholar is based on a concrete experience, a discovery, an observation, or a fact of any kind.... The content of the idea consists in this experience being compared and being brought into contact with certain different experiences in the mind of the scholar.... The idea . . . attains value for science if the interconnections thus established can be applied more generally to a series of cognate facts: for the establishment of... order simplifies and perfects the scientific view of the universe. What is most important, however, is that the task of applying the new idea in its entirety shall lead to new questions and hence to new studies and new successes.4 Moreover, both Planck and Kuhn hold that, sooner or later, discrepant data violating the reigning world-picture/paradigm are uncovered. Con- cerning this eventuality, Planck says, "the first impulse toward a revision and reconstruction of a physical theory is nearly always given by the discovery of one or more facts which cannot be fitted into the existing theory... ."41 Using the birth of quantum mechanics (to which he con- tributed so much) as an example, he mentions that when significant observational results cannot be acceptably explained by the ruling world- picture, that particular picture must be overhauled. Such a situation arose at the end of the nineteenth century when consequential discrepancies were found in classical physics' "field" premises. Though at first the anticipation was that the missing functional correlation between the wave- length distribution of energy and temperature would prove an insignif- icant error or a lacuna removable as measurements of heat radiation were improved, these hopes proved futile. They were dashed by his "quantum," a contradictory (if"constant") phenomenon which required a new atomic theory.42 38 Ibid., 25-27. 39 Where Is Science Going?, 88-90. 40 Philosophy of Physics, 89. 41 Survey of Physical Theory, 46.

JAY REEDY Such formidable divergences from paradigmatic expectation are what Kuhn has preferred to call "anomalies." In his phrasing, normal science does not aim at novelties of fact or theory and, when successful, finds none. New and unsuspected phenomena are, however, repeatedly uncovered by scientific research, and radical new theories have again and again been invented by scientists.... Discovery commences with awareness of anomaly, i.e., with the recognition that nature has somehow violated the paradigm-induced expectations that govern normal sciences.43 For him, too, these only lead to a paradigm revision after a period of anxiety. One example of this situation is the confusion and specious epicyclical ingenuity in Ptolemaic science in the many decades before Copernicus published his nonconformist theory: The state of Ptolemaic astronomy was a scandal before Copernicus' announce- ment.... The awareness of anomaly has lasted so long that one can appropriately describe the fields affected by it as in a state of growing crisis.... The emergence of new theories is generally preceded by a period of pronounced professional insecurity.... generated by the persistent failure of the puzzles of normal science to come out as they should.44 Planck described the same development from "crucial anomaly" (to use Kuhn's term) to crisis, maintaining that pressure slowly builds for re- vamping or retiring an exemplar when facts inappropriate to existing doctrine are laid bare. He saw the task of a venturesome hypothesis "to push forward to the solution of the crisis out of which it was born." But it is usually difficult to decide what part or parts of the model to adjust, because a world-picture is a nexus of elements whose creative mending cannot follow a pat formula. Commonly there are several possible so- lutions and strife over the proper adjustment may continue over a long period. This is a critical point signifying the break-up of old certainties.45 He recognized that the theoretical physics of the early twentieth century had experienced such a situation, not merely a correction of the inherited Weltbild. Nonetheless, Planck was confident that this was not a sign of the failure of orderly science. The tremors presaged an imminent cata- clysm that would eventually renew "progress": Experimental research has not experienced, for a long time, such a stormy period... physics gives one the impression of an old and honored building which is falling into decay, with parts tottering one after the other.... No conception could be more erroneous than this. Great fundamental changes are, indeed, taking place in the structure of theoretical physics, but 43 Structure, 52. 44Ibid., 67. 45 Where Is Science Going?, 90-91.</page><page sequence="11">PLANCK, KUHN, AND SCIENTIFIC REVOLUTIONS 479 closer examination shows that this is not a case of destruction, but one of perfection and extension....46 If, stated Planck, a new scientific theory survives quantitative trials, then it gets prestige, slowly expanding to encompass a more and more comprehensive ambit. Otherwise, and when empirical measurements sap the viability of a hypothesis, misgivings persist. Yet, these still belong to the chrysalis for the emergence of a shifted model.47 Kuhn declares in like manner that a crisis is followed by the creation of the "extraordinary." Severe puzzlements lead, slowly but surely, to a casting aside of the scientific community's conceptual gear: The scientist in crisis will constantly try to generate speculative theories that, if successful, may disclose the road to a new paradigm and, if unsuccessful, can be surrendered with ease. Kepler's account of his prolonged struggle with the motion of Mars and Priestley's description of his response to the proliferation of gases provide classic examples of the more random sort of research produced by the awareness of anomaly.48 This usually prolonged transition to an alien paradigm is the "scientific revolution." Planck, as already remarked, used similar terminology in recognizing the discontinuities inseparable from continuous scientific ac- complishments. Such a movement was "explosive," a sharp swerve in a spiral: "the progress of physical science does not follow a regular curve of development... in the knowledge we are gaining of the external world. It is rather a zigzag pattern... where the rebound is an attendant char- acteristic of the advance."49 Intractable data molded by the mysteries of creativity, according to Planck, produce a novel world-picture.50 A char- acteristic of innovative doctrines is that they often reconcile two distinct provinces of facts.51 This requires genius. The shattering hypotheses of twentieth-century physics were caused by the quantum theory which was so incompatible (i.e., "incommensurable" in Kuhnian language) with tradition that it forced a "profound reconstruction."52 In concert with this Kuhn recognizes that a "rupture" is often temporarily postponed by the legitimate conflation of previously discrete spheres of data as well as through the introduction of new concepts. Like Planck, he does not assume that a succeeding paradigm is simply a patching of the old one 46 Survey of Physical Theory, 45-46. 47 Where Is Science Going?, 91. 48 Structure, 89-90. 49 Where Is Science Going?, 90. 50Scientific Autobiography, 98-99. 51 Philosophy of Physics, 90-93. 52 Universe, 22-23. Planck's use of "profound reconstruction" downplays the arbi- trariness of change; cf. Karl Popper, "The Rationality of Scientific Revolutions," in Rom Harre (ed.), Problems of Scientific Revolution (Oxford, 1975), 72-101.</page><page sequence="12">480 HERBERT W. GERNAND AND W. JAY REEDY but that it amounts to a jump which "changes some of the field's most elementary theoretical generalizations as well as many of its paradigm methods and applications."53 This is surely reminiscent of Planck's "pro- found reconstruction." And Kuhn goes on to explain that the revolu- tionary paradigm shift is, despite resistances, an ineluctable outcome. Because such a shift emanates from realizations that an entire explanatory frame is inadequate, there is no other possibility except a substitute of the same overarching magnitude. In this insight Planck was again the predecessor. Shifts in how the natural laws are scientifically talked about, wrote the German physicist, are never brought about by small impulsive whims, but are due to large-scale conundrums internal to science.54 Though the untenable vocabulary of a superseded Weltbild is obsolete, this did not indicate to Planck that it had performed no conceptual service. Ideas had frequently been important for their stimulation as much as for their own innate worth. As the world-picture alters what is vouch- ered, experimental work is altered as well.55 Planck sees failed "scientific" ideas as important for their function in an ongoing mission. Their cor- respondence to the "real" is a separate issue. His assessment of the Renaissance preoccupation with alchemy is a propos: For those who lived in the days of the alchemists this problem had a very important significance.... The problem lost its meaning... when the dogma of the intransmutability of atoms was introduced. But now again, since Bohr has put forward his theory that the gold atom is different from the quicksilver atom by the lack of a single electron the problem has become... vital.56 To Planck, world-pictures containing premodern "myths," such as those of an elixir of life (which contributed to the development of the science of chemistry) and perpetual motion (which helped to direct theory to the law of the conservation of energy), possessed merit because of the sim- plifying research routes they retrospectively can be seen to have blazed. The mistaken theories of the absolute velocity of the earth and the homology between electron movement and planetary movement may have produced illusions but they also provoked modern relativity and atomic physics and therefore deserved a modicum of respect in the chronicles of science.57 A new world-picture, or paradigm, is psychologically and sociolog- ically difficult for established scientists to accept. Planck knew this from his own early career. Even data observed through replicated experiments is no guarantee for converting opponents to the merits of the drastically 53 Structure, 84-85. 54 Scientific Autobiography, 98-99. 55 Where Is Science Going?, 45. 56Ibid., 97-98. 57 Philosophy of Physics, 112.</page><page sequence="13">PLANCK, KUHN, AND SCIENTIFIC REVOLUTIONS 481 new on the theoretical plane. "It rarely happens," he opined, "that Saul become Paul." The triumph of a theory depended on the gradual demise of its opponents and on the appearance of a fresh generation, which, familiar with the new model from its inception, accepts and propagates it.58 Planck concluded that a doctrinal system should not be expected to change solely because of its own limitations. Its fall ordinarily requires the connivance of outside circumstances. Because the broader and more entrenched the old model, the more resistance there will be to recon- struction. A synthesis has a consistency which is threatened by the over- throw of even a single central element.59 Kuhn parallels Planck in the assessment that scientists find it difficult to welcome novelties: "Coper- nicanism made few converts for almost a century after Copernicus' death. Newton's work was not generally accepted, particularly on the Continent, for more than half a century after the Principia appeared." Moreover, Priestley never accepted the oxygen theory, nor Lord Kelvin the elec- tromagnetic theory, and so on.0 Provocatively, Kuhn speaks about the transfer of allegiance from one paradigm to another as a conversion experience, a "Gestalt switch." Inasmuch as opponents cannot be con- vinced by reasoning and evidence alone, the matter is settled, for Planck and Kuhn alike, by a generational succession within the culture and ranks of scientists. Kuhn views a pathbreaking paradigm as a beneficial shock to scientific activity.61 He offers a number of historical illustrations. One is the justifiable bias bestowed on later projects by Dalton's chemical theory, which "suggested new experiments, particularly those of [Joseph] Gay-Lussac on combining volumes, and these yielded still other irreg- ularities, ones that chemists had not yet dreamed of."62 In agreement on this, they judge paradigmatic breakthroughs as valuable for the investi- gative thrusts they furnish. What is the direction of the multifactored movement of science? Planck never argued that what passed for valid in his day would always be so considered. The mutations apparent in science's history were not leading to the timeless validities we find in formal syllogisms. Absolutes can never be reached by researchers but are goals toward which it is science's duty to strive in spite of their unattainability.63 He was, however, confident that genuine gains were being made and found indicators in the successes of technology, in that "we see and hear at a greater distance and command greater forces and speeds than an earlier generation." 58 Planck, Philosophy of Physics, 97.

GERNAND AND W. JAY REEDY Beyond those tokens, there were other clues in the drive toward a world- picture more capacious and more "simplified." Experimental data were causing avant-garde physics to move away from the observable and the visualizable. Science was divesting its anthropomorphic character in favor of statistical mathematics. As a participant in those trends, Planck be- lieved such attributes were symptomatic of advance and, though dis- turbing to laymen and timorous professionals, were no affront to the divinized reality the physicist had to believe in.64 The ontologically and epistemologically agnostic Kuhn-here at odds with the fideistic Planck-asserts that science's revolutions have taken place without an enduring body of scientific truths necessarily having been won. He holds that "the list of problems solved by science and the precision of individual problem-solutions will grow and grow," though in the style of the late twentieth century he is wary about calling that "progress," as Planck explicitly did, and doubts the provability of un- impeachable knowledge.65 Even in this he is not far from Planck who, though invoking the shibboleth of progress, recognized that the actual course of science is erratic. Kuhn compares scientific change from one paradigm to another to the alogicality of "sports" in Darwinian evolu- tion.66 Planck uses the same metaphor ("The world of physics... is subject... to a kind of evolution") when suggesting that pioneering theory succeeds as much through fortuitousness as through following the blueprint of the presiding ideas and rules.67 European scholars have described the Planckian image of change in science as "dialectical," and the scheme described by Kuhn also roughly conforms to a Hegelian unfolding.68 Each stage of scientific development, whether termed world- picture or paradigm, gives an avenue to research which, upon its ex- haustion, serves as the starting-point for the next synthesis. The American is the less forthcoming of the two however in declaring that empiricism is always "aim-oriented," perpetually imbued with the scientists' purpose of finding the ageless ratio bonding natural phenomena.9 Over the last two decades Kuhn's ingenious if waffling work, espe- cially its association with an antilinear, anti-Whig perspective on intel- lectual history, has been assessed for a multitude of fields.70 Yet, as 64 Universe, 14. 65 Structure, 170-73. 66 Ibid., 172.

Stephens, "The Kuhnian Paradigm and Political Inquiry: An Appraisal,"</page><page sequence="15">PLANCK, KUHN, AND SCIENTIFIC REVOLUTIONS 483 intimated above, priority should be awarded to Planck as regards the thematic, historical, and sociological horizons of scientific thought. He sketched near-equivalents to the admittedly fuzzy Kuhnian positions thirty years and more before they appeared in Structure.71 The German's anguished meditations foreshadowed major quarrels among contempo- rary philosophers of science. It is tempting to suggest that Planck, though repulsed by, was partly complicitous with the "romantic reaction" against positivistic scientism in Germany around 1900. He framed a philosophy of science that was something unorthodox: an historically and institu- tionally sensitive idealism.72 Caught in a comparable bind, the Kuhn of the early 1960s now appears as an uneasy compromiser with humanist and leftist assaults on American science's intellectual imperialism. His via media was a schematic empiricism with institutional and historical sensitivities.73 Both men, in short, shied away from the truly heretical conclusions that could be pursued on the basis of their leads. And this covert Planck-Kuhn kinship may extend even further. As several re- viewers have noticed, it is disappointing that in his latest book, where Planck's quantum work is deflated to the status of an unrevolutionary episode derivable from classical physics, Kuhn writes a traditional nar- rative and no longer deploys the premise of socially conditioned knowl- edge. He never mentions the paradigm concept in this careful tracing of the emergence of contemporary physics.74 Rather, he seems to acknowl- edge silently the epistemological fears of Structure's detractors by ignoring the adjectives "normal" and "revolutionary" in his documentation of Planck's odyssey.75 Thus, the ultimate irony may be that the dissident Kuhnian outlook on the dynamics of science has, via a meticulous ex- American Journal of Political Science, 17 (1973), 467-88; and C.

Heilbron's The Dilemmas of an Upright Man: Max Planck as Spokesman for German Science (forthcoming). 72 On this irrationalist current in Germany and how it may have affected scientists in the wake of World War I, see Paul Forman, "Weimar Culture, Causality and Quantum Theory, 1918-1927," Historical Studies in the Physical Sciences, 3 (1971), 1-115. 73 Theodore M. Brown has called Kuhn's Structure "a period piece" that "brilliantly articulates the ideological assumptions ... in the discipline of the history of science and, indeed, in American science" ("Putting Paradigms into History," Marxist Perspectives, 3 [19801, 57). 74 Thomas S.

JAY REEDY plication of Planck's own discoveries, retreated from heterodoxy. In his indecisiveness and evasiveness, Kuhn is rallying around an older trust in the rationality of scientific knowledge which Planck-that other re- luctant revolutionary-upheld against irrationalist threats during la belle epoque. While Structure has been read as denying the observation/theory distinction and advocating radical meaning variance, Kuhn subsequently conceded the likelihood of conceptual overlap ("partial communication") from one paradigm to another. This is a big but cloudy concession. Kuhn has not made his peace in the controversies of realism versus relativism in the philosophy of science or internalism versus externalism in the historiography of science. Rebutting charges that he inculcates an "an- archistic" view of Paul K. Feyerabend's sort,76 he replies that skepticism is not his position, that there is more constancy and cumulativeness in science's development than perhaps his original essay indicated. Paradigm shifts are not, at bottom, unjustified eruptions of novelty and subjectivity nor the reflex of contextual conditioning. While successful coups may be instigated by all-too-human hunches or ideologies, they achieve author- ization to be exemplars only by passing the scrutiny of scientific co- workers.77 But in allowing this, Kuhn persistently shuns the ontological realism that has once more become respectable.78 On this topic he remains, in his epistemological agnosticism, as bold and as unperturbed by em- piricism's philosophical insufficiencies as the first positivists once were. Aware of this fence-walking in Structure, one (realist) commentator is unable to ascertain if Kuhn is at present a "temperate nonrationalist," or an "embryonic rationalist."79 Certainly the current Kuhnian stand-elaborated in Larry Laudan's "research traditions"-which describes rationality in science's history as an increase in "problem-solving" capacity, is still vulnerable.80 To say that problems are solved without saying that a suprahistorical reality, and not just our conceptions and perceptions, is the reference of science leads to a notorious quandary. The pure operationalist position is similarly defenseless before the criticism that, narrowed to fleeting immediacies, it flirts with solipsism and condemns theories to impermanence and incommensurability. Undiluted positivism shares with rampant histori- cism the danger of undermining any science claiming immutable Truth. By contrast, in his last address, "Scheinprobleme der Wissenschaft" 76 See especially Against Method (London, 1975). 77 "Reflections on My Critics," 264-65. 78 See, for instance, Jarrett Leplin (ed.) Scientific Realism (Berkeley, 1984). Planck noted that, "the ... most original minds, men like Kepler, Newton, Leibniz and Faraday, were inspired by the belief in the reality of the external world and in the rule of a higher reason in and beyond it" (Philosophy of Physics, 28-29). 79 W.

He still stressed the metaphysical "given" of a Weltbild that might elude us in tempore but whose regulatory telos pays progressive and tangible divi- dends.81 The paradoxical coexistence of even today's cosmological and particle physics with faith in an idealized cosmos (another "essential tension"?) accentuates the nagging pertinence of Planck's perspective on history and eternity for scientific thinking.82 North Dakota State University. 8' Though Mach's philosophy was undoubtedly a provocative force in the early stages of relativity and quantum theory, Einstein too saw positivism (and probability expla- nations) as unsatisfactory after World War I. He pursued the unified field theory, while avowing a scientific "piety" very much-as he himself admitted-like Planck's. On this topic, Gerald Holton has written two seminal essays: "Mach, Einstein, and the Search for Reality," Daedulus, 97 (1968), 636-73; and "Einstein's Search for the Weltbild," Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society, 125 (1981), 1-15. Planck interpreted relativity within the absolutism of the "world-picture" of course. Cf. Where Is Science Going?, 56 and 195; and Ernst Lechner, Physikalische Weltbilder (Leipzig, 1912), 84. 82 In a reverential mood concerning the attainment of verities, Planck commented that "science demands . . . the believing spirit. Anybody who has seriously engaged in scientific work of any kind realizes that over the entrance to the gates of the temple of science are written the words: Ye must have faith. It is a quality which the scientist can not dispense with" (Where Is Science Going?, 214).
