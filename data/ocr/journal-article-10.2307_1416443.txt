<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS scientific psychology. In the laboratory sensation is no more, certainly, than an abstract category under which observational data are listed. "Without doubt the most numerous of all sensations for the average person are those of color. And yet, a purely psychological description of them has never been made." (Sic!) What is more psychological than the description of an object in terms of color? "Perception implies a knowledge of sensations on the part of the sensus com- munis." The latter is an "inner sense" postulated by Thomas Aquinas to which he ascribed the "power of sifting, sorting, and unifying the data of sensory experience into perceptual wholes." Here is a true "bundle hypothesis" for the Gestaltists to shoot at. It indicates no recognition of the notion of perceptions as integrated compounds, that has grown up from experiments with concrete perceptual objects, because such a concept could not be assimilated by the predicated system. Examples might be multiplied but the picture would not be changed. Biologists will not rally to the interpretation of evolution, nor physicists to that of the principle of uncertainty. How one values Professor Brennan's presentation and interpretation of psychology will depend upon his willingness to accept the systematic postulates. As we have indicated, the response of the laboratory psychologist will be negative. But, then, the latter is but slightly considered in most of the recent textbooks of psychology, of which all but a scanty few present some explanatory system or sociological scheme bolstered by such factual material from psychology and the other sciences as suits their purposes. They do the same sort of thing that Professor Brennan has done, only not so well. In either case experimental psychology is the loser. Hobart College FORREST LEE DIMMICK Theory and Art of Mysticism. By RADHAKAMAL MUKERJEE. London, Longmans, Green &amp; Co., 1937. Pp. xvi, 08. When psychologists wish to characterize an utterly unscientific mode of explana- tion they frequently use the appellation (or epithet) 'mystical.' Whether they are aware of all the implications of the term is not always clear. At any rate, for those psychologists who happen to be seeking a current and, to a degree, adequate treatment of the mystical mode of interpretation this book should prove to be a vade mecum. Its author, a professor of economics and sociology in Lucknow Uni- versity, has performed a real service for occidental readers, regardless of one's ultimate estimate of the applicability of mystical ways of thinking to problems of human nature. One would seek vainly, however, for a critical evaluation of mysticism. Despite the author's avowed intent "to present an objective explanation of the mystical life and experience," one notes from the beginning that he accepts without question the validity of mystical interpretations. His "objective explanation" is of the nature of a defense of mysticism by way of deducing "certain universal principles" from the varieties of mystical expressions found in the numerous religions of the world as well as in the individual verbalizations of representative mystics. To augment his defense he marshals whatever data seem available from various sciences. Of interest to psychologists is the use he makes of the Jungian concept of the subconscious as well as of the Gestalt concepts of totality and structure. At the same time he is critical of those psychological studies which attempt to explain mystical experiences as abnormal phenomena. Such studies, the author contends, are an outcome of a 189</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS wrong approach to religion (e.g. Ribot, Freud, Leuba), for they envisage religion as an aberration, inevitably so when they look only to its bizarre features and ignore its more essential character as an agency of social value and cultural progress. Through the entire book runs the contention that religion and mysticism find prag- matic validation in terms of elevated social values and individual sanity. Of interest to physicists as well as to psychologists is his appeal to "distinguished authorities in modern physics and mathematics" who "now seem to regard consciousness as funda- mental and matter as derivative from consciousness." Accordingly, he relates (p. 269) Jeans' view of the university "as consisting of pure thought" and Eddington's belief that "the stuff of the world is mind stuff" to the Yoga conception of the universe as "mere thought." Let not the reader infer from this review that Professor Mukerjee puts science on a par with mysticism. Despite his readiness to invoke science in defense of mysti- cism, he does not attempt to serve both masters on an equal footing. Mysticism is the preferred master; science belongs to a lower order. Hence the implications of the second law of thermodynamics need provoke no qualms anent personal security. For we find in eastern mysticism "something more than anthropomorphic systematiza- tion;" something which "alone can rescue metaphysics from the crippling effects of the invasion of physical science, and save human souls from the laws governing the motion of electrons and protons or the ceaseless flux of the evolutionary process." Indeed, "science has not always given a true and unfaltering guidance for the direc- tion of human activities along socially desirable channels. Thus, instead of science being called on to advise what expressions of the religious impulse will be permissible, it is upon rleigion that society will have progressively to depend for pulling the chariot of man's destiny along the path of progress." A careful reading of this book has not convinced the reviewer, at least, that mysticism is more dependable than science "for pulling the chariot of man's destiny along the path of progress"-if by "progress" one means escape from obscurantist interpretations. But, then, the reviewer is doubtless seriously deficient in those habits of thought by which mysticism flourishes. Lawrence College J. H. GRIFFITHS Biologische Typen des Menschen und ihr Verhaltnis zu Rasse und Wert. By EDUARD ORTNER. Leipzig, George Thieme, 1937. Pp. 104. An attempt to clarify the ambiguities in Jung's "introversion" and "extraversion" led the author to develop his own schema for classifying human types on the basis of the relation of the organism to the environment, and to coin eight new words to describe his six a priori human types and the two main groups into which he divides them. The first three types adapt their environments to themselves. Dr. Ortner calls them the intrabasal types, in contrast to the last three, or extrabasal types, which become adapted to their environments. For each extrabasal type there is an intrabasal type that contrasts with it in some ways and resembles it in other ways. The whole schema is very pretty-far too pretty to fit the complexities of the actual world of real people. The author identifies his six so-called biological types with the six races described by Ludwig Ferdinand Clauss in Rasse und Seele. He is not disturbed by the fact 190</page></plain_text>
