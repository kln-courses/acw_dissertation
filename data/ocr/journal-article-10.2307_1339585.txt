Tigar * T HERE happens, upon occasion, a judicial utterance so ar- resting as to require study and contemplation for what it tells us of the world in which judges dwell. Surely this has been so of the "moral pestilence of paupers, vagabonds, and possibly con- victs" to which Mr. Justice Barbour referred in i837.1 So, too, of Mr. Justice Black's summing up for the majority in Illinois v. Al- len,2 holding that a trial judge confronted with an obstreperous defendant might hold the man in contempt, bind and gag him, or exclude him from his trial. Such a holding is necessary, the Justice said, to show that "our courts, palladiums of liberty as they are, cannot be treated disrespectfully . . .", and so that they will "remain . . . citadels of justice." 3 Allen, whose mental competence was questionable,4 had ini- tially refused appointed counsel in his state robbery trial, though the trial judge asked an attorney to sit with him "to protect the record." During the voir dire, Allen's examination of the first prospecdve juror was prolix and, the trial judge believed, irrele- vant. He argued with the judge in "a most abusive and disrespect- ful manner," and at one point said, "When I go out for lunchtime you're going to be a corpse here." He tore up the appointed lawyer's file and threw it on the floor. Protesting the exclusion from the courtroom of members of his family who were to be witnesses in his defense, he said: "There is going to be no pro- ceeding. I'm going to start talking and I'm going to keep on talk- ing all through the trial. There's not going to be no trial like this. I want my sister and my friends here in court to testify for me." * Acting Professor of Law, U.C.L.A. Law School. A.B., University of Cali- fornia at Berkeley, i962; J.D., i966. 1New York v.

Relenting, the judge permitted Allen to be present for the beginning of the proceedings, but again removed him when he protested the exclusion of witnesses. Allen was present, under a promise of good behavior, during most of the presentation of his defense, which was conducted by counsel.5 The Illinois courts affirmed Allen's conviction. On his petition for habeas corpus, the district judge denied relief. The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed, holding: 6 No conditions may be imposed on the absolute right of a crim- inal defendant to be present at all stages of the proceeding. The insistence of a defendant that he exercise this right under unreasonable conditions does not amount to a waiver. Justice Black, for the Court, disagreed. There are at least three ways, he said, in which a trial judge may seek to prevent a defendant's disruptions: binding and gagging, use of the con- tempt power, and exclusion from the courtroom. The Court was careful to give only a qualified endorsement to the first method I and noted that the second included both the civil contempt sanc- tion of imprisonment until an assurance of good behavior is given and the criminal contempt penalty of imprisonment for a specified duration as punishment for previous disruptive conduct.8 The power to exclude was based on the conclusion that a defend- ant's contumacious behavior may amount to a waiver of his sixth amendment right to confrontation: 9 Although mindful that courts must indulge every reasonable presumption against the loss of constitutional rights, Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U.S. 458, 464 (1938), we explicitly hold today that a defendant can lose his right to be present at trial if, after he has been warned by the judge that he will be removed if he continues his disruptive behavior, he nevertheless insists on conducting himself in a manner so disorderly, disruptive, and disrespectful of the court that his trial cannot be carried on with him in the courtroom. I The facts are set out in the opinion of the Court of Appeals, United States ex rel. Allen v. Illinois, 413 F.2d 232, 233-34 (7th Cir. I969). 61d. at 235. 7 Trying a defendant for a crime while he sits bound and gagged before the judge and jury would to an extent comply with that part of the Sixth Amendment's purposes that accords the defendant an opportunity to con- front the witnesses at the trial. But even to contemplate such a technique, much less see it, arouses a feeling that no person should be tried while shackled and gagged except as a last resort. 397 U.S. at 344. 8 Id. at 344-45. 9 Id. at 343.</page><page sequence="3">I970] THE SUPREME COURT -FOREWORD 3 Allen was not the only significant waiver case decided in the I969 Term, and it requires consideration along with three others, Brady v. United States,'0 Parker v. North Carolina,"1 and McMann v. Richardson.'2 The ostensible waiver in each of these cases took place in the guilty plea process. Brady pleaded guilty to a federal kidnaping indictment and was sentenced to fifty years imprisonment. Had he been found guilty by a jury, he might have received the death penalty. But the statute provided that the maximum punishment follow- ing a court trial or a guilty plea was life imprisonment. After Brady's guilty plea had been entered and accepted, this statutory provision was held unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in United States v. Jackson,'3 because it impermissibly burdened a defendant's constitutional right to jury trial. Brady claimed that by the same reasoning the statute impermissibly induced his plea of guilty in order to avoid the risk of death. Parker had been charged with first-degree burglary, a state offense punishable by death. He pleaded guilty under a statute which provided a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment fol- lowing a guilty plea. As did Brady, Parker claimed that this constituted unconstitutional inducement of the guilty plea. He also claimed that his plea was the product of a coerced confession which his assigned counsel had told him could be used in evidence against him. In McMann, three New York prisoners sought habeas corpus claiming that they had pleaded guilty because they believed that their allegedly coerced confessions would be used against them. Their pleas were taken prior to the Court's decision in Jackson v. Denno,14 which held that New York's system of allowing the jury to determine the voluntariness of confessions was uncon- stitutional since it revealed to the jury that the defendant had confessed and thereby prejudiced the determination of guilt or innocence based upon lawful evidence. In all three cases, the Court declined to hold the pleas in- voluntary, though upon grounds which are difficult to sort out. In McMann, the Court denied petitioners a hearing on their allegations, saying that resort to federal habeas corpus was precluded because their plea of guilty, and consequent refusal to present the coerced confession claim to the state court for determination, was a deliberate bypass of orderly state proce- 10 397 U.S. 742 (1970). 11397 U.S. 790 (1970). 12 397 U.S. 759 (1970). 13 390 U.S. 570 (I968). 14 378 U.S. 368 (I964).</page><page sequence="4">4 HARVARD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 84:1 dures. The Court bolstered this conclusion by observing that the forces motivating pleas of guilty are many and complex, and that the pleas in issue, though assertedly based upon fear of sub- jection to an unconstitutional method for determining voluntari- ness, were nonetheless the product of a deliberate choice, in- formed by counsel's advice and assistance, and therefore immune from further scrutiny. In Parker's case, there was no issue of deliberate bypass, since the case came up on review of a state collateral attack proceeding. The Court simply held that counsel's failure to advise Parker to challenge his confession on a plea of not guilty was "well within the range of competence required of attorneys representing de- fendants in criminal cases," 15 and therefore that Parker's de- cision to plead guilty was voluntary. In McMann, Parker, and Brady, the Court went out of its way and off the record to validate a number of aspects of present- day plea bargaining, approving the practice of granting lighter sentences or reducing charges in exchange for pleas of guilty, and putting its imprimatur upon the litany of the plea as it is per- formed in almost every court in the land. McMann, Parker, Brady, and Allen raise troubling questions about where the Court is headed now in the field of criminal justice. Taken together, they lead me to doubt that the Court appreciates the real-life events which daily occur in our criminal courts, to conclude that the earlier search for reasoned and con- sistent principles of waiver is now put to full flight, and to wonder at the lawyer's role in the midst of these currents of judicial thought. This Foreword concerns itself with this doubt, conclusion, and wonder. My concern for the view of the criminal process reflected in this Term's opinions is heightened by the in- creasingly strident challenges to the system of criminal justice. As an outgrowth of the social turmoil which attends militant challenges to existing institutions, the criminal courts have be- come a principal weapon for social control. The gap between the carefully cultivated image of disinterest and fairness and the reality of partisanship and inequity is becoming apparent. This Foreword addresses one discrete aspect of this gap.

This lack unfortunately isolates appellate judges from knowledge of the practical impact of their decisions. Al- though there was a day when Supreme Court Justices tried cases on circuit and thus could see the quality of trial-court justice first hand,'9 they have had little trial responsibility since i869.20 While few pretend that reinstating this practice is workable or practical, some means must be found to assure that the Court appreciates the world into which its decisions are projected and that its opinions have the impact their words appear to promise. For it remains true even after the "constitutional revolution in criminal procedure" that the lower criminal courts - where the bulk of American criminal justice is meted out - hardly call to mind images of "citadels" and "palladiums." I think of the District of Columbia courtroom where I had my first trial - dingy wooden panelling, a desultory breeze oc- casionally noticeable, court officials going about their business with weary resignation. And the lawyers - most of whose busi- ness is the daily grind 'em up and spit 'em out of drunks, disorder- lies, whores and vagrants - standing around and calculating how many cases at $50 per case is a healthy day's work. Ten? Sure, on a good day a man can pretend to represent ten clients, if he can plead most of them guilty and not worry about the law in the rest of the cases. For a time, I thought that things must be different elsewhere. That was before iOO Centre Street, Manhattan. If possible, a dingier courtroom in which the men and women with business to do were mostly past caring, and the men and women -liti- gants- upon whom this business was to be done were mostly past hoping. Someone, in a forlorn battle to preserve the trap- pings of justice, had put a large plastic bag over the American flag in the corner to keep it clean. The bag itself had yellowed and was covered with grime. And in back of the judge's bench 17Miranda v.

In one case I was defending thirteen young people who had been arrested for disorderly conduct during a demonstration out- side the National Headquarters of the Selective Service System. The information- the charging paper -was a printed form, which we challenged on the basis of a case more than forty years old decided by the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, hold- ing an information in the same form failed to state an offense.2' Several other disorderly conduct cases were heard after our argument, some to be tried in ten minutes time and some to be disposed of on a plea of guilty. The same or a similar defect was present in almost all the informations that morning, yet none of the lawyers- most of whom had been sitting in court during our argument - bothered to protect the record or even to make reference to the legal insufficiency of the charges against their clients. Nor did the judge or prosecutor advert to the point in any of the cases. The trials hardly deserved the name. One standard script runs thus: Police officers testified that the de- fendant was drunk and when stopped either (i) said a word which would accurately but colloquially describe Oedipus or (2) attempted to strike the officer. Defendants denied these as- sertions. Whether defendants were found guilty in ioo% of the cases or some lesser percentage depended upon whose court you were in and how the judge felt. Who was telling the truth in these cases? It is interesting to note that disorderly cases used to feature officers testifying that the defendant said "god damn" or "'son of a bitch." Rum- blings from appellate courts and the views of a scarce few trial judges 22 on the relatively pallid character of these remarks, taken in context, coincided with an escalation of the police version of the rhetoric of those arrested for disorderly conduct. "In the halls of justice," Lenny Bruce used to say, "the only justice is in the halls." Maybe not in the halls either, for that is where the plea bargains and lawyer-client conversations take place.

But their importance is seldom recognized by those who formulate the theoretical rules under which our system of criminal justice allegedly operates. This conclusion is not novel, but iteration of it seems wise: for the men and women caught up in them, the criminal courts are neither palladiums of liberty nor citadels of justice. Citadels, perhaps, in an older sense of the term, "a citadell, castell, or spacious fort built not onely to defend the citie, but also to keepe the same in awe and subiection." 23 Unfortunately, the constitu- tional revolution in criminal procedure has amounted to little more than an ornament, or golden cupola, built upon the roof of a structure found rotting and infested, assuring the gentlefolk who only pass by without entering that all is well inside. More thoughtfully, the Court seems to some to have failed to examine the process in which its constitutional interpretations must operate. Or, less kindly, to have decided that some prob- lems of process are simply too cumbersome to manage by means of decree, and should therefore be ignored. The Court cannot, of course, rewrite the penal codes. Its role in the rebirth of inter- est in the criminal law has been to superintend the reform of pro- cedural rules in the light of constitutional principle, and to exer- cise some veto power on the legislative process through the "void for vagueness" and delegation of power doctrines.24 One had hoped that in the course of this development a consistent view would emerge of the criminal process and the Court's role in it, but this has not been the case. Whatever the reason, decisions of this past Term illustrate just how far we are from a consistent statement of constitutional principle within the sphere delimited by the Court as its proper concern. II. SOME CONSIDERATION OF WAIVER IN A REAL WORLD The defendants in McMann, Parker, Brady, and Allen were held by the Court to have relinquished some right or rights which they concededly had; in the first three cases, the right to a trial and to remain silent were waived by their guilty pleas; in Allen the waiver was of the right to be present at one's trial and to con- 23 2 A NEW ENGLISH DICTIONARY 440 (I933), quoting from a I598 work. 24 As to the "void for vagueness," rationale, see Giaccio v.

Yet one searches the opinions in vain for a consistently applied concept of voluntariness which inte- grates these decisions one with another and with prior cases on waiver and consent. It is waiver of rights that permits the system of criminal justice to work at all. Consider the model criminal trial, cast in the mold of the adversary system, with the defendant accorded a catalogue of rights, and guilt or innocence the subject of a determination made after full and contentious airing of the evi- dence. In this model, all evidence is collected without impairing, infringing, or disparaging the rights of everyone to be silent in the face of police interrogation, and without overriding the rights of any person to have counsel and resist interrogation under com- pulsory process on any available legal basis. And if someone claims that a right has been overridden or disregarded, means exist for challenging such action. In reality, in most criminal cases, perhaps as many as ninety percent in some jurisdictions, the model has no direct relevance to real life, since the defendant cuts short the process by pleading guilty to the offense charged or some lesser included offense.25 Other defendants shorten the process by waiving a jury trial, or by failing to raise possible defenses on procedural and techni- cal grounds. Criminal courts are crowded now; imagine their utter breakdown in the wake of every defendant insisting on a plenary trial. Whatever the rationale for permitting waiver, courts have applied two principles limiting its application. First, the Court held in Johnson v. Zerbst 26 that a waiver, to be effective, must be an "intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right." 27 This standard stresses the consensual, "free choice" character of waiver and its ultimate reliance upon the individual's freedom to forgo benefits or safeguards through the uncoerced exercise of his rational faculties. Whether the Court in fact has been willing to validate mythical consents and whether the image of the "free man" is grounded in demonstra- ble reality remain to be seen. Second, there may be some procedural incidents of the crim- inal process which the accused cannot waive.21 The Supreme 25 THE PRESIDENT'S COMMISSION ON LAW ENFORCEMENT AND ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE, TASK FORCE REPORT: THE COURTS 9 (I967). 26304 U.S. 458 (I938). 27 Id. at 464.

I will not question here whether waiver standards should be used, but rather will examine the way in which the Johnson standard, with its undertone of express waiver by an informed accused, has fared. The cases show that it has commonly been ignored or, what may be worse, has received a kind of token obeisance which serves only to rob its words of whatever cog- nitive, as opposed to emotive, significance they possess. Indeed, the insensitive application of waiver standards by American courts in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries was consistent with their general view of freedom of contract as the underpinning of the social order. Just as freedom of contract offered a justification for outright robbery by a fortunate few, ranging from employers extracting unconscionable concessions from their unorganized employees to merchants driving uncon- scionable bargains with their customers, so it has been in the criminal process the theoretical construct in whose name men are said to have voluntarily given up their liberty. Consideration begins with an analysis of selected groups of waiver cases. A. Taking Five In Rogers v. United States,30 a witness before a federal grand jury answered a few too many questions about her association with the Communist Party, and was held to have "waived" her privilege with respect to additional details since there was no real danger of further incrimination. The privilege exists as to the dis- closure of a fact which may in any degree form a link in a chain of evidence against the witness.3' Voluntary disclosure of any such fact evinces, the argument runs, an intention not to rely upon the privilege, at least not in that forum, and not with respect to the entire subject matter to which the initial disclosure relates. The same general rule is followed with respect to all testimonial thus waiver of a trial was not allowed. In some early cases the right to a jury trial is spoken of as so basic to the court's jurisdiction that it cannot be waived. See, e.g., Low v. United States, I69 F. 86 (6th Cir. igog); Dickinson v. United States, I59 F. 8oi (ist Cir. igo8), petition for cert. dismissed, 2I3 U.S. 92 (I9go). These cases were overruled by Patton v. United States, 28i U.S. 276 (1930). 29 Singer v. United States, 380 U.S. 24 (i965). 30 340 U.S. 367 (I95I. 31 Blau v. United States, 340 U.S. I59 (I950).</page><page sequence="10">10 HARVARD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 84:I privileges, constitutionally-based or not, including the lawyer- client, clergyman-penitent, and doctor-patient privileges.32 It is difficult to see how the concepts of "intentional" and "known" may be integrated into the Rogers analysis, the logic of which permits the uncounseled witness to give up a valuable right without being aware until after the fact that he is doing so. One pleasantly disposed could term this "gee, you'll wish you hadn't said that" waiver. For example, traditional federal prac- tice, with counterparts in many states, does not permit a witness to have his attorney present in the grand jury room while he is being interrogated. True, the witness may leave to consult his attorney in the anteroom, but as Rogers indicates, he may not know when to stop answering questions and find out whether he is in danger of a waiver. There have been nibbles at the edges of the Rogers rule. At least one court has been willing to say that where a witness be- fore the grand jury is a prospective defendant, he may have the right to counsel and to be informed of his fifth amendment privilege.33 Despite this hopeful sign, experience shows that witnesses summoned before grand juries - and, no doubt, other tri- bunals - are remarkably unaware of the nuances of testimonial privilege and the dangers of waiver. A great many witnesses for whom genuine self-incrimination problems exist testify at grand jury sessions uncounseled by lawyers of their own and unwarned by the prosecutorial staff serving the grand jury of the harm they may do themselves by venturing against a skilled lawyer whose objective position is adverse to their own. B. Misconduct as Waiver Allen reflects another approach to waiver. Allen, the Court held, had by his courtroom demeanor intentionally relinquished his known right to confront the witness against him. So far as the record reveals, there had been no statement by Allen that he wished not to be present. There had been no explicit statement that he had a constitutional right to be present which 32 See generally Preliminary Draft of Proposed Rules of Evidence for the United States District Courts and Magistrates, 46 F.R.D. i6i (i969), reprinted with the Reporter's Notes. Proposed Rule 5-II, 46 F.R.D. at 280, deals with waiver of testimonial privileges. The article dealing with privileges, Article V, is at 243-84. 33See Sheridan v. Garrison, 273 F. Supp. 673 (E.D. La. i967), rev'd on other grounds, 415 F.2d 699 (5th Cir. i969), cert. denied, 396 U.S. I040 (1970); cf. United States v. Luxenberg, 374 F.2d 24I, 246 (6th Cir. i967); Jones v. United States, 342 F.2d 863, 87I-74 (D.C. Cir. i964) (concurring opinion of four of eleven sitting judges). But see United States v. Levinson, 405 F.2d 97I (6th Cir. i968), cert. denied, 395 U.S. 958 (i969) (no right to counsel in room).</page><page sequence="11">19701 THE SUPREME COURT-FOREWORD II he was in danger of waiving, although there was warning that he would be excluded if he persisted in speaking out. If one con- siders the question as one of transactional analysis - or similar psychiatric whizbang - the scene resembled a game of "Now I've Got You, You Son of a Bitch." 34 Allen was held to have "forfeited," by his conduct, the right to be present. The action of the court was little different in form from a civil contempt proceeding which robs a man of his liberty until he shall do what the tribunal has commanded, except in Allen the right lost was not that to move about, but the right to be present at one's trial. The question of waiver is thus different from that involved in asking a defendant if he wishes to plead guilty and to relinquish his right to a trial, or inquiring whether he truly wishes not to be represented by counsel. Since the waiver is not explicitly consensual, what insures that it is "knowing" and "intentional" in the Johnson v. Zerbst sense? The Court's opinion does not suggest a definitive answer. Instead, the Court converts waiver into a punitive sanction, but without setting down any new standards or procedures for its application. By seeing the prob- lem as one of waiver, and attempting to force it into the mold of the consensual waiver cases of Johnson v. Zerbst and its prog- eny, the Court did little to explain how rights should be held lost nonconsensually and nothing to help us understand its present view of the Johnson test. C. Consent at the Threshold The cases which deal with consent to search illustrate another aspect of the problem of waiver. The archetypal search and seizure consent, involving a search for tangible evidence, is given at the threshold, after an officer asks whether he can come in and look around. Most courts accept such consent as voluntary, absent a demonstration that the party was overwhelmed by "au- thority." 35 The Court has not yet addressed itself to the question of whether the party consenting must be informed of his rights in the matter. Here again the Johnson standard is dishonored, and the shadow of consent taken for its substance. Searches conducted with the permission of a third party - a friend, relative, landlord, or employer - raise even more com- plicated problems. Some cases rest a finding of effective waiver upon a property rights analysis, saying that the employer or homeowner, for example, can permit police entry to the property 34 E. BERNE, GAMEs PEOPLE PLAY 85-86 (I964). 35 See Bumper v. North Carolina, 39I U.S. 543 (I968) (no valid consent where officer falsely asserted he had warrant); Judd v. United States, I90 F.2d 649 (D.C. Cir. I95I) (number of armed policemen may be inherently coercive).</page><page sequence="12">I2 HARVARD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 84:I because it is "his." 36 These cases often interweave questions of standing to object to a search with the question of consent. Thus, absent probable cause for the search, the police may still gain evidence against A, a guest in the house of B, in two ways: B might consent to the search directed at A; or, if the search initially were directed against B, A would lack standing to ob- ject to it.37 A second vicarious waiver analysis rests upon such arcane concepts of agency as "apparent authority" and "implied author- ity." If A delivers a bag containing marijuana to B, he obviously clothes B with the "power" (in a physical sense) to show the bag to any police officer who asks to see it. The question is whether A, in turning the bag over to B, should be regarded in law as hav- ing consented that B show it to the police, or as having "assumed the risk" that he would. Courts have had little difficulty in hold- ing that A does assume the risk.38 Both the proprietary and agency rationales lack any intelligi- ble account of the meaning of "consent." The legal consequences which should follow from a grant of power over one's goods and interests have bedeviled the writers about agency for decades.39 But in the field of search and seizure, little attention has been paid to deciding when the law should honor the expectations of one who entrusts an object to another. The situation becomes murkier when one expands his view to searches not for tangible objects but for words. The law of waiver under the Johnson standard would simply insist that the subject of the search be informed of his rights, and that his consent be truly voluntary. However, traditional waiver formulas become inapplicable to seizures of the spoken word. It has been held for some time that the fourth amendment protects the spoken word from unreasonable seizure, and that the eavesdrop- per is subject to the same or similar constraints as the policeman entering through the front door to look for counterfeit money, a murder weapon, or a nickel bag of the dread weed. Katz v. United States,40 which held that a man's telephone conversation in a public booth was protected by the fourth amendment, made express the unspoken rationale of earlier search and seizure cases 36The Court has declined to adopt this theory in its furthest reach, however, and has said, for example, that a hotel employee may not authorize search of a guest's room, Stoner v. California, 376 U.S. 483 (I964), nor a landlord permit search of a tenant's house, Chapman v. United States, 365 U.S. 6io (I96I). 37See Alderman v.

Katz held, in the context of electronic bugging, that the fourth amend- ment protects "what [a man] seeks to preserve as private, even in an area accessible to the public." 4' The emphasis is placed on the will of the actor. Consider the case of a man whose best friend is engaged in reporting their every conversation to the police. Or suppose an informer wins the confidence of a political leader and lays the basis for the latter's prosecution for conspiracy to riot. In each of these cases, the statements which the informer reports were made with the expectation and desire that they would remain confidential. In Lopez v. United States,42 the Court held that an Internal Revenue Service agent who implied he was willing to accept a bribe permissibly recorded the taxpayer's offer of the money. In Hoffa v. United States,43 the Court upheld the use of evidence provided by an informer who infiltrated the defense camp, though it appeared the informer was under considerable pressure to cooperate or be vigorously prosecuted for his own misdeeds.44 The rationale for finding consent in cases like Lopez and Hoffa rests not upon an express waiver of fourth amendment rights, but upon a kind of "assumption of risk" that those to whom one speaks will tell all to the government. Such a risk has always been present and is reflected by the general rule that extrajudicial statements of an accused are admissible, qualified by Miranda 4 and the coerced confession cases with respect to custodial statements. But surprisingly little consideration has been given to the rationale for binding a speaker to accept these risks. To say that when A speaks his mind to B, C, and D he ap- points each one his "agent" to disclose the conversation to the police may be a pleasing conceptual characterization but hardly advances rational inquiry. The answer lies in analysis of the central meaning of Katz: in a mass society which requires the frequent exchange of objects and information, each person must 41Id. at 35I. 42 373 U.S. 427 (I963). 43 385 U.S. 293 (I966). 44 The Court may consider this issue anew in the I970 Term in United States v.

Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (i966).</page><page sequence="14">14 HARVARD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 84: I have some means, through acts of will, to protect his privacy from warrantless intrusion. In Frazier v. Cupp,46 the Supreme Court held that one to whom a duffel bag had been given by the petitioner had the power to consent to its search. As in Lopez and Hoffa, the Court spoke of the petitioner having "assumed the risk" that the con- sent would be given, indicating that the petitioner had no reason- able expectation that his cousin, to whom he gave the bag, would resist a police request to search. The Court also said that the cousin had "authority" to permit the search, and brushed aside as "metaphysical subtleties" the petitioner's argument that he gave his cousin only the authority to use some compartments of the duffel bag. Did the Court mean to hold that one who en- trusts a tangible item to another cannot effectively bind that other to resist police intrusion which has no basis in a warrant or prob- able cause? If so, then how can it reconcile the holding with that in Stoner v. California,47 which refused to permit a hotel room search consented to by the hotel clerk? Both Stoner and Frazier involved an undertaking between two persons concerning the privacy of, in one case, a place and, in the other, an object. The difference, perhaps, is in the workability of a rule which would assimilate Frazier to Stoner. A policeman seeing a man in possession of property may not be expected to inquire about the interests of a third party, but the policeman can be expected to know that a hotel guest expects his room not to be entered without his permission. But this distinction ignores the implication of Katz, which is that the will of the actual victim of the search is the matter of primary concern. Frazier casts doubt on this implication by say- ing that one can confer on another the authority to consent to search without intending to do so and despite efforts to avoid doing so. Thus, the Court has defined certain risks which one must assume, regardless of intent, in conveying things or words to others. To have so quickly ended the effort begun in Katz to let citizens define for themselves a zone of privacy is regrettable, and it does violence to the teaching of Johnson v. Zerbst as well, if that case is considered to have the general application which the Court's subsequent citation of it gives reason to hope. However, if courts do make a list of risks, the list should be based on more than law enforcement convenience. Specifically, we must realize we are saying that by doing certain acts men will be taken to have agreed that their fourth amendment rights 46 394 U.S. 73I, 740 (I969). 47376 U.S. 483 (i964).</page><page sequence="15">I970] THE SUPREME COURT -FOREWORD I5 are to be impaired. What kinds of acts should have this significance? May the government approach my best friend and coerce him into revealing what I have told him? Must I, in speaking with friends, take the risk of this sort of governmental arm- twisting? As Garrity v. New Jersey 48 held that a police officer may not be coerced into self-incrimination by threats that other- wise he will be fired, likewise in the fourth amendment field one should not be subjected to the risk of similar governmental coercion of his "agents." What should be the effect of the presence of a third party where the reasonable expectation of the primary communicators is that of confidentiality? When a lawyer and client, or a doctor and patient, are speaking and a third person is present to aid the client's interest, his presence should not act to destroy the privi- lege.49 Similarly, members of political organizations should not be forced to risk disclosure of their secret party meetings. Such a risk is sure to chill rights of association and free speech.50 In short, if one considers the problem of consent as one of tacit assumption of risk, it is imperative that the doctrine be limited so as to protect important confidential relationships and to minimize the constant fear of unasked governmental intrusion. Justice Jackson put it well: 51 Among deprivations of rights, none is so effective in cowing a population, crushing the spirit of the individual and putting ter- ror in every heart. Uncontrolled search and seizure is one of the first and most effective weapons in the arsenal of every arbitrary government. And one need only briefly to have dwelt and worked among a people possessed of many admirable qualities but de- prived of these rights to know that the human personality de- teriorates and dignity and self-reliance disappear where homes, 48385 U.S. 493 (I967).

The drafts- men, recognizing that in the practice of law and in the consultation of a lawyer, secretaries, accountants, and others may be necessary to permit the lawyer to serve the client, have given the client protection against any of these persons wagging his tongue. When one consults a lawyer, he has a legitimate expectation that what he says will be kept quiet, and it is difficult to square this expectation with the holdings that seem to say it can be undone by the unilateral action of one party to the conversation. 50 See generally Askin, Police Dossiers and Emerging Principles of First Amend- ment Adjudication, 22 STAN.

In the fourth amendment field, a primary goal should be the cultivation of the Katz reliance upon the power of each person to create a zone of privacy for himself. Failing that, one has need of a reasoned set of principles of assumption of risk which both protect and help create reasonable expectations about privacy. D. Waiver by Omission If a defense attorney fails to cross-examine a witness, neglects to raise and preserve a point, or allows the time for appeal to pass, he may be waiving constitutional rights of his client. The possibility of waiver by omission raises two questions. First, which decisions are left to counsel and which must be made by defendant? Second, what standards are used in determining whether a lawyer's inaction is "well within the range of compe- tence required of attorneys representing defendants in criminal cases"? 52 When a man retains a lawyer, he delegates control over a portion of his life to one in whom he reposes confidence.53 This notion of the attorney as an "agent" 54 goes back to the Greek practice of employing a speech writer when a litigant had to ad- dress the Athenian assembly to obtain a legal judgment. The role of the lawyer remained undeveloped in eras when the law itself was less complex. Indeed, some of the colonies prohibited legal representation for money, convinced that lawyers made complex that which was simple and poisoned the well of justice through avarice, delay, and pettifoggery.55 But to each social order, including our own, there comes eventually the notion of the lawyer as an agent conducting litigation in behalf of his client. This rise of a legal "profession" is saluted by those who view a legal system as a set of complex rules which reflect the basic power interests existing at a given moment. But though the creation of a legal profession may improve professional standards and provide a body of experts capable of explaining the intricate workings of the law,56 it carries in its train new problems.

If a man stands in open court and intelligently forfeits rights and privileges, it is not unfair to hold him solely responsible for the consequences. But if the very complexity of the law forces a man to speak through an agent, the ability of the agent to waive the rights of his principal becomes relevant. In Fay v. Noia,57 the Court's majority stated that the considered choice of the litigant was necessary to effect a waiver of the right to seek federal habeas corpus relief. The issue there was Noia's failure to ap- peal his state criminal conviction and present his constitutional claims in the state courts. The Supreme Court recognized a limited discretion in a federal judge to deny habeas corpus relief if the applicant's inaction represented a deliberate attempt to bypass state procedures. However, it emphasized that the de- cision to forgo state remedies could be made by a defendant only after consultation with competent counsel and that a decision by counsel alone would not necessarily bar relief.58 But in Henry v. Mississippi,59 the Court indicated that an intentional failure by counsel to object to the admission of ille- gally seized evidence would have been an effective bar to federal review. In dictum, the Court equated an intentional failure to object with a deliberate bypassing of state remedies. If such a trial strategy is unsuccessful, counsel has waived his client's right to pursue his constitutional claim in either the state or federal courts.60 It is difficult to reconcile the apparent inconsistency between the Fay insistence upon the considered choice of the litigant and the Henry willingness to accept the lawyer's decision as binding the client. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals despaired of reconciling the two statements and held that Henry limited Fay.6" One possible distinction is that Fay involved "a relinquishment . . . as fundamental as a plea of guilty," while Henry concerned "the waiver of the right to object to introduction of evidence . . . normally within the discretion of the attorney." 82 Both rights, however, are of constitutional dimension. Furthermore, challenging an unlawful search may involve pretrial motions and 57 372 U.S. 39I (I963); see Developments in the Law - Federal Habeas Corpus, 83 HARV. L. REV.

It is hard to justify a distinction based merely on timing. Fay v. Noia suggests, as does Henry, that a lawyer is per- mitted to make relatively minor and understandable mistakes on behalf of his client, but not major and inexcusable ones. The question of agency will thus turn on an assessment of the sig- nificance of a procedural right to the proper defense of an ac- cused. Interpreted in this way, Fay makes the issue of allocation of decisions between attorney and client nearly coextensive with that of competence of counsel. That is, minor mistakes which do not sacrifice important rights are excusable and will bind the defendant, but gross legal errors which threaten fundamental rights and raise doubts as to the qualifications of defense counsel can be disavowed by an accused. Thus, competence should be based on an analysis of the step-by-step performance of counsel in the course of representing his client; it should not depend on whether counsel has met some general standard of skill. The Henry Court did say cryptically that "where circum- stances are exceptional," unsuccessful trial strategy of counsel will not preclude an accused from raising a constitutional objec- tion on appeal. But if the Court's statement were intended to have germinal significance, it has not yet borne fruit. This is un- fortunate since many lawyers representing criminal defendants are not "competent" in any sense of the term. The Court's statement in Parker that the petitioner had representation "well within the range" of acceptable competence does not, however, illuminate the meaning of the term. Unfortunately, the statement may imply that "competence" may be assessed generally and mechan- ically rather than specifically and analytically. A "competent" lawyer, the Court may be saying, is a member of the bar who takes some time to talk with his client and who gives the outward appearance of attentiveness to his client's problems. It is not so difficult, however, to give an outward appearance of competence. The litany of guilty pleas in any local criminal court is revealing. "Well, Your Honor," the lawyer's ritual though uninformative speech begins, "'at this time the defend- ant would like to withdraw his plea of not guilty and enter 63 See, e.g., FED. R. CRIM. P. 4I(e), stating the federal preference for a pretrial motion to suppress illegally seized evidence. See also Battle v. United States, 345 F.2d 438 (D.C. Cir. I965).</page><page sequence="19">1970] THE SUPREME COURT-FOREWORD I9 a plea of guilty to petit larceny. I have discussed this matter fully with the defendant and the prosecuting attorney and the defendant has decided that this course is in his best interest. I have fully informed him of all his rights, and this is something he really wants to do." If such a speech even presumptively puts all lawyers within the realm of competence, we will have gone little beyond the District of Columbia Circuit's old statement that "the term 'effective' has been used by the Supreme Court to describe a procedural requirement, as contrasted with a stand- ard of skill." 64 If the guarantee of effective representation requires only the outward appearance of justice, few claims of ineffective assist- ance are likely to prevail. Furthermore, since the decisions in MllcMann and Parker were based on meager records indeed, the Court may be saying that counsel's misadvice must appear on the record. Such a standard would insulate from scrutiny the often crucial advice given over the telephone, in the halls and through the bars of the lockup, and would introduce an irra- tional distinction between those rights which a defendant forgoes in court on the record and those which he gives up because of cajolery and counsel outside the judge's presence. To make real the Johnson promise that no right is lost unless the loser knows it, we need a definition of waiver which identifies on the record the loss to be suffered and ensures the defendant wants to suffer it. E. Consent in the Context of Guilty Pleas The Court in the guilty plea cases seems to assume that the decisions of defendants are the free and voluntary acts of in- formed individuals. This nineteenth-century contracts law notion of consent has proven inadequate in the field of its provenance, but surprisingly few of its logical and empirical faults have been noted in the discussions of waiver in the criminal law. Legisla- tures and civil courts have long since recognized that the con- cept of the individual as a free agent is irreconcilable with the realities of American commercial life. They have developed compensating doctrines in the field of consumer law where grossly one-sided agreements are often extracted from ill-informed pur- chasers with little bargaining power. Courts invalidate or closely scrutinize "contracts of adhesion," emphasizing the need for "actual" consent. They note that when all sellers or lenders use the same or similar printed forms, the purchaser or borrower is "'Mitchell v. United States, 259 F.2d 787, 790 (D.C. Cir.), cert. denied, 358 U.S. 850 (I958).</page><page sequence="20">20 HARVARD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 84:I without a meaningful choice. They attempt to discover whether the consumer actually understood the bargain he was making or merely signed a complex printed form which he assumed co- incided with the oral explanation of the seller.65 Contrast the attitude of the civil courts with that of the criminal courts. Judges who would not hesitate to condemn a furniture dealer who preyed on the ignorance of his customers and exploited a superior bargaining position will routinely ap- prove the plea bargain that results from negotiations between the state and an uninformed, powerless defendant. The contrast is less obvious in Supreme Court decisions since there is no body of federal commercial law. Nevertheless, the Court's attitude toward consent in the context of plea bargaining could seriously weaken the standard of Johnson v. Zerbst. When a defendant pleads guilty, he waives the right to a jury trial and the privilege against self-incrimination. The judge must ensure that the accused knows he is forfeiting these rights and that he is doing so without coercion or unfair inducement.66 In pleading guilty the defendant may also be forgoing a number of procedural rights which might lead to acquittal or dismissal if his case went to trial. He may be losing an opportunity to challenge an unlawful search or a coerced confession.67 He may be givirng up the chance to attack an insufficient indictment68 or the composition of a grand jury.69 He may be waiving the right to insist that the government produce internal documents and reports regarding the investigation that led to his indictment.70 Justice White, the Court's spokesman in the guilty plea cases, pays little attention to this aspect of the guilty plea process. Rather, the rhetoric of his opinions is laden with references to "admissions of guilt" and admissions that the defendant com- mitted "the crime charged." 71 He appears to argue that once a man has admitted his guilt, consideration of the procedural errors which may have attended commencement of his prosecution be- comes much less important. This reliance upon the "admission of guilt" as a universal solvent for procedural error is not the only basis of Justice White's reasoning. By his explicit refer- 65 See, e.g., Williams v.

Both rationales not only are inconsistent with the language of Johnson v. Zerbst, but also undermine the Court's work in establishing a set of procedural guarantees for a man ensnared in the criminal process. Reliance upon an admission of guilt to sweep aside pro- cedural objections such as those presented by the defendants in McMann, Parker, and Brady is difficult to justify. Such an ap- proach seriously weakens the deterrent effect of exclusionary rules and other procedural protections since police and prosecu- tors need not worry about their conduct in the seventy to ninety percent of cases where judgment is entered on a plea of guilty.72 This consequence is inconsistent with the principle that ad- judications of guilt are reached in conformity with procedural guarantees of fairness to both the guilty and the innocent. Our system demands that guilt must be established before a fairly- selected jury and impartial judge, on evidence lawfully obtained, after notice of charges, and with a meaningful opportunity to be heard. Perhaps this list leaves out a right or two, but the point is clear: we often depart from an insistence that the criminal process determine what happened in a real, external world, and we do so in the service of a number of social goals including minimizing the possibility of convicting those who are in fact innocent, deterring official misconduct, and advancing a number of other auxiliary policies reflected in rules of evidence and in other procedural rules. These guaranteed rights are at least as essential to the integrity of the criminal process as its function of convicting the guilty. In fact, they should be superior to any interest in a higher conviction rate, given the intent and language of the portions of the Constitution which deal with the criminal process.73 Moreover, the notion that a guilty plea cures prior procedural 72 See Note, The Unconstitutionality of Plea Bargaining, 83 HARV. L. REV. I387 &amp; n.i (I970). Judge Bazelon has explored the subject of plea bargaining with characteristic thoroughness in Scott v. United States, 4I9 F.2d 264 (D.C. Cir. I969). Many of my own thoughts on the subject were the product of dis- cussions with Robert Weinberg and Barbara A. Babcock (now Barbara A. Bow- man). See Weinberg &amp; Babcock, Book Review, 76 YALE L.J. 6I2 (I967) (reviewing D. NEWMAN, CONVICTION: THE DETERMINATION oF GULT OR INNOCENCE WITHOUT TRIAL (I966)). Obviously, the scope of the present treatment of this subject is sharply limited, and the many other issues raised in the foregoing works are worthy of serious attention. " See Sutherland, Crime and Confession, 79 HARV. L. REV. 21 (1965).</page><page sequence="22">22 HARVARD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 84:I defects creates an arbitrary distinction since the decision to plead guilty is not based solely on the prospects for excluding evidence or challenging the indictment process. The decision may turn upon such factors as the defendant's insistence upon trial, the willingness of his attorney to press the matter to litigation, and the entire network of irrational pressures which experience shows dominate the decisions of a criminal defendant from the moment he enters the criminal process. Finally, one can not always ascribe to a defendant who pleads guilty the intention to forgo a set of procedural rights far larger than those to which explicit reference is made at the time of plea. The Court's reasoning assumes that counsel in McMann knew that he could challenge not only the confession coerced from his client but also the New York procedure for testing the volun- tariness of that confession. It assumes that Brady's and Parker's lawyers were aware of the possible unconstitutionality of a sys- tem in which the accused would risk death by going to trial. Supposedly, after carefully weighing the chances of successful attack against the risks of more severe punishment, the attorneys advised their clients to plead guilty. The assent of the client may not even be necessary, since so much emphasis is placed on the role of counsel relative to that of the client. Although the record does not indicate what factors influenced the decisions of the attorneys in McMann, Parker, and Brady, observation of the day-to-day operation of the criminal courts suggests that the supposition underlying the Court's opinion is erroneous. Too many criminal attorneys are not skilled legal practitioners, well versed in the law relating to confessions, searches, and seizures, who carefully assess the strength of the prosecutor's case before recommending a course of action to their clients. Assuming that a decision to plead guilty is always, or even usually, based on the advice of a diligent and informed counsel emasculates the concepts of "known right" and "intentional relinquishment." A meaningful definition of "known right" would at least re- quire that a defendant be made aware of the rights he impliedly waives by pleading guilty. The Court has been careful to ensure that an accused knows his rights during the custodial interroga- tion stage of the criminal process.74 He must be advised of his right to remain silent, his right to have an attorney present dur- ing interrogation, and his right to appointed counsel if he is indigent. Furthermore, the Court has created a strong presump- tion against the ability of defendants to waive these rights.75 Contrast this scrupulous regard for the rights of the accused 7 See Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (I966). 75Id. See also Carnley v. Cochran, 369 U.S. 506 (I962).</page><page sequence="23">I970] THE SUPREME COURT -FOREWORD 23 during the early stages of the criminal process with the Court's virtual abdication of responsibility at the pleading stage, where the defendant need only be told that he has a right to a jury trial. There is a second aspect to the "known right" problem - the difficulty of knowing what you are getting as a defendant who pleads guilty. Every well negotiated guilty plea is based on the parties' assessments of the chances for success of particular legal and factual defenses. The Court in McMann, Parker, and Brady draws the curtain over this process and leaves the bargaining to the lawyers. The litany of the plea may include only the de- fendant's statement that he is voluntarily waiving his rights to a trial. In shielding the plea-taking process from inquiry, the Court effectively forecloses appellate judicial intervention in all but a handful of the seventy to ninety percent of criminal cases which end in a plea of guilty. In this way the plea is in danger of becoming a mere ritual which sanctifies a criminal process that dispenses "justice" with only pro forma participation from an ignorant and mystified defendant. If the Johnson concept of waiver is to have any real meaning in the plea bargaining context, lawyers and judges must ensure that decisions to plead guilty are made by defendants who are fully aware of the rights and privileges they forgo by not insisting on a trial. At a minimum, a defendant should be asked by the court whether he knows the elements of the offense with which he is charged and understands what the government would have to prove under the indictment. He should be asked how many con- ferences he has had with his lawyer and how long each confer- ence lasted. He should be asked whether he has been shown a copy of the police report and any other prosecution evidence which might indicate the strength of the case against him. He should be asked if he knows what the trial would involve in terms of procedural rights, and he should be given a brief explanation of what those rights are and how they would operate. The judge should then question the lawyer carefully about the factors in- volved in pleading his client guilty, including the availability of legal defenses such as unlawful search, coerced confession, and sufficiency of the indictment. The judge must be an active partici- pant in the process of informing the defendant, ensuring that the lawyer and defendant have taken current judicial decisions into account and weighed the possibility of their application. The defense and prosecuting attorneys should be asked to reveal the nature and extent of their conversations concerning the case, in- cluding their relative assessments of the legal and factual prob- lems and the reasons they were led to agree on a plea to a lesser charge. If there have been judicial or prosecutorial assurances of a particular sentencing consideration, based for example upon</page><page sequence="24">24 HARVARD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 84:1 a pre-plea probation report, then these should be spread on the record. If there have in fact been no such assurances, then this fact should be made of record. Throughout the process, the defendant should be encouraged to ask questions in order to ensure that he understands and rati- fies his lawyer's decisions. If at any point it appears that the lawyer has not given adequate consideration to a possible defense, or that he has not sufficiently demystified the legal issues, the plea process should be terminated, subject to renewal, with the assurance that all statements by the defendant are inadmissible in a subsequent trial. Similarly, if it appears that an attorney has completely overborne the will of his client, the process should be halted.76 One element which the trial court should surely not insist upon is the defendant's assertion that he is guilty, as opposed to a statement that he regards the potential evidence for and against him pessimistically enough to accept the consequences of an ad- judication of guilt.77 The Court's failure to insist in the sphere of guilty pleas upon the processual and structural character of a determination of guilt - an insistence which runs through the criminal process and is reflected in many rules which frustrate the search for real world truth -defies a logical explanation. * * * The failure of this Term's waiver decisions to continue the work begun in Miranda, to seek an understanding of the meaning 76 The judge may also be faced with the problem of defendants who plead guilty because of legal consequences which can be avoided by other means. For example, a jailed defendant, who would demand a trial were he not incarcerated, may plead guilty in return for a sentence equalling "time served." Clearly, the judge should refuse to accept the plea and order the defendant bailed instead. The fact that a judge would be willing to free the accused in return for a plea of guilty indicates that there is no reason to detain him pending trial. See Weinberg &amp; Bab- cock, Book Review, supra note 72. 77 See McCoy v. United States, 363 F.2d 306, 308-og (D.C. Cir. I966). Rule ii of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure requires the trial judge taking a plea to satisfy himself that there is a factual basis for it. However, this requirement, even if it is also one of due process, see Boykin v. Alabama, 395 U.S. 238 (I969), does not contradict what is said in the text. The trial judge's inquiry presumably looks to the evidence which the prosecutor has in his possession, and the proof the defendant would be able to marshal in opposition. Here, as in the trial itself, the concern is not so much "did certain conduct take place in the external world?", but "is the combination of testimony, admissible documents and objects, and judicially-noticed matters that can be produced sufficient to satisfy a trier that a certain degree of probability exists that certain facts occurred in the real world?" See generally J. MICHAEL &amp; M. ADLER, THE NATURE OF JUDICIAL PROOF (I 93 I) . Much of the con- fusion could be eliminated from discussions of the "admission of guilt" aspect of guilty pleas by a much more liberal policy of accepting pleas of nolo contendere.</page><page sequence="25">I970] THE SUPREME COURT -FOREWORD 25 of consent, and to integrate the concept of waiver with the basic premises of the system of criminal justice, is regrettable. These decisions ignore the real world in which criminal defendants are handled, thus making it easier for the system of criminal justice to ignore its shortcomings and to reduce the pressure generated by dockets crowded with the cases of alienated, dispossessed, and desperate men and women. When rights are deemed waived through inadvertence, igno- rance, attribution to conduct of assertive significance it will not reasonably bear, and emphasis on the actions of surrogates and agents, the rules of criminal procedure have lost most of their meaning. To be sure, it may prove impossible for courts to deter- mine whether a surrender of rights is truly "voluntary." The bourgeois archetype, the free man, is gone from amongst us in jurisprudence as well as economic relations.78 But we can ensure that decisions are not coerced by pressures which the criminal process itself creates or which result from discriminations within the reach of established constitutional protections. That far we should surely go. III. HAVE OUR ILLUSIONS A FUTURE? Learned Hand once said, "After now some dozen years of experience I must say that as a litigant I should dread a lawsuit beyond almost anything else short of sickness and death." 79 Indeed, an understanding of the workings of criminal justice is incomplete without a notion of its fearfulness. The man who is facing trial for a serious crime may be little comforted by the reminder that he is entitled to the due process his peers custom- arily receive. Instead, he may react like Thomas More upon discovering that the king had commuted his sentence of hang- ing, drawing, and quartering to a mere beheading: "God forbid the king should use any more such mercy to any of my friends, and God bless all my posterity from such pardons." 80 The vignette illustrates a fundamental division of our day- the conflict of perspective. The perspective of the judicial sys- tem, with its formal hierarchy of rights and remedies, is not that of the individual defendant subject to the very real lash of the system's sanctions. But it is the former viewpoint, that of the illusory Palladium, that pervades the recent decisions of the 78 See generally A. SCHAFF, A PHILOSOPHY OF MAN (I963).

Let us, however, lower our focus for a moment to the man caught up in the system. He seldom either knows or cares about the subtleties of criminal procedure or elevated constitutional ideals. But he knows what in fact the criminal process is doing, or can do, to him and his family. And, as a heightened sense of injustice steals across the face of America and finds devotees in the inner city, the factory, and the campus, he is often conscious of what that process is doing to his community, his class, or his race as well. It palters in a double sense, therefore, to admonish him to observe the arcane rituals of the courtroom and to entrust his future to the remote world of judges and lawyers - only to dis- cover at the end of the process that his rights have mysteriously evanesced through "waiver." As he becomes less patient and more aware of the gulf between the real world and the imaginary city of procedural rights bespoken by Justice Black, there will doubtless be more assertive behavior in court. As the government continues to prosecute dissentient political conduct as criminal, 81 The problem of courtroom disruption, while the subject of renewed interest by the American Bar Association (which held two widely publicized panel dis- cussions on the subject at its convention in St. Louis in August, I970) and the American College of Trial Lawyers (see The American College of Trial Lawyers, Report and Recommendations on Disruption of the Judicial Process (i970)), is certainly not novel. One is struck, as he leafs through records of trials in England and America, by the frequency with which defendants and lawyers cast aside formalism and spoke their minds about the process in which they were engaged. See, e.g., The Trial of William Penn and William Mead, [i8i6] 6 Howell's State Trials 95I, 955-6I (I670); The Trial of George Gordon, [I814] 2I Howell's State Trials 485 (i78i). The theory was apparently that the trial was not merely the business of the lawyers and the judge, but also of the defendant, the jury, and even the public at large. Some residue of this sentiment informs the sixth amend- ment right to public trial. See 6 J. WIGMORE, EVIDENCE ? I834 (3d ed. I940). 82 Both the procedural and substantive aspects of the contempt power merit a careful analysis. The rights to notice, a hearing, a jury trial, and impartial tribunal are all in jeopardy under certain contempt procedures presently available. See, e.g., Harris v. United States, 382 U.S. i62 (i965). The substance of the contempt power must also be reexamined, as it is the last common law crime in our law, giving the judge the power to make as well as enforce detailed rules of conduct. In re McConnell, 370 U.S. 230 (i962), suggests some limitations on the power. But more thought must be given to the problem of warning a potential contemner of the conduct that is expected of him and the sanctions for disobedience. See Illinois v. Allen, 397 U.S. 337, 350 (1970) (Bren- nan, J., concurring): Of course, no action against an unruly defendant is permissible except after he has been fully and fairly informed that his conduct is wrong and intoler- able, and warned of the possible consequences of continued misbehavior.</page><page sequence="27">I970] THE SUPREME COURT -FOREWORD 27 the proportion of such defendants who know of the promise of that city will increase. As more young lawyers despair of inte- grating their sense of right and wrong into the lifestyle of the corporate practitioner, they will venture into the criminal courts. If there is hope for change, it lies in a sense of injustice, informed by past Court decisions and filtered through the per- spective of the individual defendant. First, we should expect to see more activity by defendants who demand to understand the proceedings and to be informed of the rule or rules at issue. They will wish to speak for themselves and not entirely through coun- sel, and their language will be the vigorous speech of the streets, not the accepted courtroom litany. Lawyers, troubled by losing the control they had always assumed to be an essential ingredient of the adversary system, will have to learn that their detachment is now suspect, serving too often to remove their performance from the scrutiny of their clients and, with the recent waiver decisions, to insulate it from judicial review. Rituals will bend. Second, the new perspective will have practical implications for jury procedures. Defendants may ask that juries be per- mitted to participate in the questioning of witnesses, clarifying any lingering uncertainties or doubts. This practice has honor- able antecedents in older English and American trials 83 but has fallen out of use in American jurisdictions. The "men of the country" become increasingly important as the system itself be- comes suspect, for they are presumably less insulated from the real world than the forbidding men in black robes and business suits and presumably less tempted to manipulate clients and concepts for their own benefit. A judgment by the community, moreover, seems inherently more trustworthy than one rendered in a contest of champions. With regard to the role of both de- fendant and jury, then, there is needed an assault on the old procedural forms, to see whether the courtroom can accommo- date the sensibilities of those who are most profoundly affected by what goes on there. This procedural assault is especially important because of the seriousness of the substantive issues that are presently being discussed. Indeed, at the root of the harsh debate over Illinois v. Allen and related cases is a factual dispute about the true nature of our criminal process. If one accepts Justice Black's view that American courts today are palladiums and citadels, then to preserve and protect them in their present condition is 83 Juror participation in trials, to the extent of asking questions and raising issues, is evident in The Trial of George Gordon, [I8I4] 2I Howell's State Trials 485, 5I2-I5 (I78I); see The Trial of William Penn and William Mead, [i8i6] 6 Howell's State Trials 95I, 96I-62 (I670).</page><page sequence="28">28 HARVARD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 84:I logically a primary task. But if one believes that the courts in their day-to-day operation are the means by which a dispropor- tionate number of the nation's poor and powerless are dealt with arbitrarily, then one's primary insistence will be upon fairness and respect for personal rights. And if one further believes that the judicial system in the hands of a hostile government is used as a weapon to repress dissent, then his anger and frustration will be channeled into dramatizing this fact and attempting to cast aside procedural formalisms which mask injustice and make it easier to inflict. From commanders of power both public and private we hear more and more stridently the claim that order must have primacy even over justice; by such an assertion is meant that the speaker prefers that the existing constellation of political and economic power be preserved. From alienated and dispossessed there comes an increasing insistence that the formal guarantees of fairness are primary, and there is a growing willingness to insist upon these guarantees militantly and even disruptively. In such a time, to speak of accommodation of order to justice becomes more and more beside the point, for in the real world they are more and more perceived in counterposition. The causes of and prospects for this increasing tension must be debated elsewhere. But it should be clear that our discussion of the criminal process treads close upon the fundamental social issues of our time. To have neglected this truth, through abstraction, heedlessness, or forejudgment, should be the occasion of regret.</page><page sequence="29">TABLE OF CONTENTS FOREWORD: WAIVER OF CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS: DISQUIET IN THE CITA- DEL .Michael E.

CONSTITUTIONAL LAW A. Equal Protection i. School Desegregation. - In a group of per curiam opinions handed down last Term,' the Supreme Court voiced its growing impatience 2 with the pace of southern school desegregation. In Alexander v. Holmes County Board of Education,3 the Court summarily reversed a lower court decision 4 granting a Justice Department motion for additional time to submit a desegregation plan for thirty-three Mississippi school districts.5 The Court indicated that a standard of "all deliberate speed" was no longer constitutionally permissible and that "the obligation of every school district is to terminate dual school systems at once and to operate now and hereafter only unitary schools." 6 In order to avoid further delay, the school districts were permitted to litigate objections to the plan adopted by the court of appeals only after they had begun operating unitary schools.7 But for all the opinion's strong words and barely suppressed 'Northcross v. Board of Educ., 397 U.S. 232 (ig70); Carter v. West Feliciana Parish School Bd., 396 U.S. 290 (I970); Dowell v. Board of Educ., 396 U.S. 269 (1969); Carter v. West Feliciana Parish School Bd., 396 U.S. 226 (i969); Alex- ander v. Holmes County Bd. of Educ., 396 U.S. I9 (i969). 2 See, e.g., Griffin v. County School Bd., 377 U.S. 2i8, 229 (i964) ("There has been entirely too much deliberation and not enough speed . . . ."); Green v. County School Bd., 39I U.S. 430, 439 (I968) ("The burden on a school board today is to come forward with a plan that . . . promises realistically to work now"). The prize for most emphatic expression of judicial outrage apparently goes to Mr. Justice Black, who demanded integration "not only promptly but at once -now." Alexander v.

'The motion followed a letter to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals from Robert Finch, Secretary of HEW, requesting that the deadline for submission of a terminal plan be set at Dec. i, I969. See Letter from Robert H. Finch to Chief judge John R. Brown, Aug. I9, I969, reprinted in Petitioner's Brief at 53a. The court of appeals had previously set an Aug. ii deadline for submission of the plan with implementation to follow no later than Sept. i. See Order of Court of Ap- peals, July 3, 1969, reprinted in Petitioner's Brief at 28a, as modified, Order of Court of Appeals, July 25, I969, in Petitioner's Brief at 38a.

The "integrate now, litigate later" formula, although expressed more explicitly than before, is nothing new.8 Nor is the opinion significant for its assertion that " 'all deliberate speed' . . . is no longer constitutionally permissible." Whatever the initial wis- dom of the "all deliberate speed" standard,'0 the Court had re- pudiated it long before Alexander." Indeed, the United States conceded as much in its brief 12 and argued instead that the Office of Education was moving with "dispatch" to formulate desegre- gation plans.'3 In view of the Court's dissatisfaction with these representa- tions, Alexander could be read as a rejection of "dispatch" as well as of "deliberate speed." Alexander seems to demand that school districts desegregate "at once - now." 14 Yet no matter how often the word "now" is underscored, it cannot be taken literally. The Solicitor General must be correct when he asserts that "desegregration does not occur automatically . . . [A] plan is usually necessary; and, unavoidably, a plan requires some time to formulate and some time to implement." '5 In many cases, to be sure, a school board acting in good faith can take emergency action to bring about some desegregation the day after an adverse decision. In a district where there has been no integration at all, for example, the white schools can be im- mediately opened to black transfer students and some makeshift transportation can be quickly provided. But the Court has made clear that steps such as these will usually not suffice to meet the board's affirmative obligation to desegregate.'6 More sweeping measures will certainly require at least some minimal additional time. It takes at least a few weeks to redraw district lines, trans- 8 See Keyes v. School Dist. No. i, 396 U.S. I2I5 (Brennan, Acting Circuit Justice, i969); cf. Magnum Import Co. v.

Were a school district to present convincing evidence that im- mediate implementation of a complex desegregation plan was a physical impossibility, it is hard to believe that the Court would nevertheless demand immediate compliance. Indeed, two Justices have read Alexander to require only that school boards demonstrate "beyond question" a plan's "unwork- ability" before they can win delay,17 and two others have con- tended that the "various situations" of the local boards should be considered in setting deadlines.'8 While the remaining four Justices were quick to label these positions a retreat from Alex- ander,'9 it is hard to dispute the proposition that an "unwork- able" plan should not be implemented, or that the "various situ- ations" of local boards may influence workability. But the mere acceptance of these propositions does not deter- mine what factors may legitimately be considered in assessing workability. In its determination to emphasize that "now" means "now," the Court neglected to provide standards for when "now" -as it occasionally must -means "a little later," or for how much later is "a little later:" 20 In Alexander the Court brushed aside arguments that immediate desegregation was too costly, and that it would throw the community into chaos. But the strength of these arguments will vary with the facts of the par- ticular case. They do not lend themselves to an absolute rule. At the very least, it cannot be true that when the manpower is simply unavailable to produce a complex desegregation plan at once, the district will nonetheless be ordered to conjure up a plan "immediately." It is no easy matter to decide when such reasons for delay should be accepted, particularly in the context of the last fifteen years during which such excuses have often served as a subterfuge for intransigence. Yet the excuses must somehow be evaluated, and the Court has yet to provide the analytic tools with which a principled evaluation can be made. Moreover, it is now apparent that the lower courts can no longer look to the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare to make the hard decisions on how much time the school districts 17 Carter v.

Nor does even the Harlan-White opinion tell the lower courts what factors they should consider in deciding whether to allow an 8-week delay.</page><page sequence="34">I970] THE SUPREME COURT, I969 TERM 35 should be given. For the one proposition that clearly -albeit implicitly - emerges from Alexander is that the federal courts should no longer automatically accept the executive branch's recommendations on the mechanics of desegregation. In so hold- ing, the Court significantly modified the judiciary's five-year alliance with HEW -a relationship that has had a more pro- found impact on southern schools than the previous ten years of litigation.2" The alliance had its origin in the Civil Rights Act of I964 22 which authorized the Commissioner of Education to render tech- nical assistance to desegregating school districts 23 and provided for the termination of federal assistance to those school districts not complying with federal guidelines.24 As amended in I966, the statute obligated the Commissioner to treat compliance with a federal court order as compliance with HEW guidelines.25 While the courts were under no analogous duty to defer to the Commis- sioner's guidelines, it soon became apparent that if the courts im- posed less stringent requirements, school boards could evade the force of the I964 Act by submitting to a court order.6 It did not follow, of course, that district courts should refrain from requir- ing more integration than provided for in the guidelines, but many federal judges -particularly in the fifth circuit -were in fact happy to forgo the task of making technical educational decisions for hundreds of southern school systems.27 Hence, the courts 21 In i964, ten years after Brown v. Board of Educ., 347 U.S. 483 (i954), a mere I.I79% of the black students attending school in the eleven states of the old confederacy were attending school with some whites. During the I964-65 school year, the year the Civil Rights Act authorizing the guidelines was passed, the percentage rose to 2.25. During the next year, the percentage jumped to 6.o0. See Carter, The Warren Court and Desegregation, 67 MIcH. L. REV. 23 7, 245 (i968). For a description of how the alliance between HEW and the lower fed- eral courts achieved these early victories, see Dunn, Title VI, the Guidelines and School Desegregation in the South, 53 VA. L. REV. 42 (i967). As of Feb. 8, I970, it has been estimated that 35% of black school children were attending schools with at least some whites. See N.Y. Times, Feb. 8, I970, at I, col. 6. But see N.Y. Times, Jan. 4, I970, at 78, col. 3 (87.6%o of black students in five southern states still attend schools with enrollment which is 95% or more from minority groups). 22 42 U.S.C. ? 200oa-h (i964). 23 42 U.S.C. ? 2000C-2 (i964). 24 42 U.S.C. ? 2000d-I (i964). 25 42 U.S.C. ? 2000d-5 (Supp. IV, I969). 26 See, for example, Judge Wisdom's warning that "district courts should make few exceptions to the Guidelines and should carefully tailor those so as not to defeat the policies of HEW . . . ."

Even in its heyday, this delegation was never complete. The fifth circuit declined to incorporate the HEW guidelines bodily into its model decree,30 and Judge Wisdom was quick to assert that "[t]he Guidelines, of course, cannot bind the courts; we are not abdicating any judicial responsibilities." 31 Other circuits showed a reluctance to follow the fifth circuit approach, even when modified by Judge Wisdom's caveat. While agreeing that HEW guidelines should be given "considerable weight," 32 Judge Gibson of the eighth circuit argued that [i]t is for the courts, and the courts alone, to determine when the operation of a school system violates rights guaranteed by the Constitution. [The courts] are not bound [by HEW] . . . and when cir- cumstances dictate, the courts may require something more, less or different from the H.E.W. guidelines.33 But despite some isolated district court decisions requiring a school board to do more than obey the guidelines,34 the courts have generally contented themselves with verbal assertions of their independence while in fact following HEW's lead.35 Thus, the lower court in Alexander, although clearly unhappy with HEW's request for delay,36 apparently could see no choice but accession to that request. [Judicial desegregation] inescapably puts the Federal Judge in the middle of school administrative problems for which he was not equipped and tended to dilute local responsibility for the highly local governmental function of running a community's schools under law and in keeping with the Consti- tution. 28 See, e.g., Singleton v.

While itself providing no specific standards for the pace of desegregation, Alexander makes clear that HEW's specifics should not be adopted automatically. The Court's decision may be premised on the fear that the executive has become a less reliable partner in the battle against dual school systems.37 It suggests an unwillingness to make the constitutional rights of southern blacks dependent upon the po- litical vicissitudes of the executive branch,38 and serves as a belated vindication of Judge Gibson's criticism of the delegation strategy.39 If Alexander signals a reassertion of the judiciary in the area of school desegregation, then it has profound implications not only for the timing of future integration, but for its substance as well. Alexander grappled with the question of when the school boards must act, but it left temporarily open the question of what they must do. It has now become obvious that vague talk about "unitary school systems" will not suffice as a constitutional standard, and that the Supreme Court must soon deal explicitly with the question of how much integration is constitutionally required.40 3 The decision was no doubt made easier by the apparently disingenuous con- duct of HEW. A scant eight days before the Secretary sent his letter requesting more time, see note 5 supra, the Office of Education had told the district court that the proposed plan was "educationally and administratively sound, both in terms of substance and in terms of timing."

See also id., Jan. 30, i969, at i, CoI. 7. The President has more recently affirmed his support of the principles enunciated in Brown, although he coupled this affirmation with a warning that "in a free society there are limits to the amount of government coercion that can reasonably be used; . . . in achieving desegregation we must proceed with the least possible disruption of the education of the nation's children ...."

Elliott: "The Constitution . . . does not require integration. It merely forbids discrimination." 42 But the Brown decision had said more than that, and just how much more became increasingly apparent once the battle for the minimal rule was won. Brown was based not only on the stigma attached to official segregation, but on a denial of equal educational opportunity as well.43 The notion that separate edu- cation must be "inherently unequal" derived, in turn, from a much older idea about the role of public education in this country: [T]he public school ... fails in its mission if it teaches the races separately. That mission, since it cannot be discharged by segregated schools, must be an equalizing, socializing, national- izing -assimilationist and secular -mission.44 Although recent studies have thrown doubt on the proposi- tion that integrated education always produces higher achieve- ment levels than segregated education,45 the broader notion that part of one's schooling should involve learning how to associate with different kinds of people 46 remains unimpaired.47 This assimilationist mission takes on constitutional dimensions if one accepts the argument that in a country which is overwhelmingly white, blacks will be able to gain equality only if they are inte- grated - at least to some minimal degree - into white society.48 41 The phrase is Professor Bickel's.

See Sweatt v. Painter, 339 U.S. 629 (1950). 47 There is, of course, a countertradition emphasizing freedom of association and private decisionmaking. See Pierce v. Society of Sisters, 268 U.S. 5IO (I925). But the courts seem to be moving away from this tradition-at least when it appears in the context of sustained public resistance to desegregation. Cf.

In I968, the Court rejected "freedom of choice" as an end in itself, and held in three cases that school boards had an affirmative obligation to take whatever measures may be necessary to achieve real integration and a unitary school system.49 While it is pos- sible to view these decisions as no more than a demand for hard evidence that recalcitrant school districts are dismantling their state-imposed dual school systems (the minimal Brown require- ment),50 their implication seems to be broader.5" If this is in fact the direction in which the Court is moving, significant difficulties lie ahead. The minimal Brown rule is an all-or-nothing proposition, but the requirements of true integra- tion are not so easily articulated. It must be decided just how many blacks must go to school with whites to achieve the Court's assimilationist goals and just what means the local boards are obligated to use to see that the goals are met. Obviously, these questions must be answered differently in different communities. Housing patterns, the availability of private schools, and the racial composition of the population vary from area to area, and these factors will inevitably affect the degree of integration which is possible. It will not be easy to derive standards which are universally applicable. Moreover, once the Court moves significantly beyond the minimal Brown rule, it becomes difficult to confine the application of the new rule to the South. The lower courts are badly split on the question of northern integration,52 and in the face of vociferous objections to the application of different rules for the South and North,53 it seems unlikely that the Supreme Court will be able be avoid the question much longer. There are steps which can be taken to alleviate racial imbalance in big city schools,"4 but it is a difficult business involving hard educational 49 Monroe v.

The costs of real integration must be determined as well as the costs a state is constitutionally obligated to incur. The benefits of in- creased integration must be weighed against competing values and alternative possibilities (for example, community control and remedial education), and ultimately compromises will have to be made and halfway measures taken. In theory, there seems little reason why Alexander should affect the ability or willingness of the courts to tackle these prob- lems. Although HEW undoubtedly provided important assistance to the judiciary by using the fund cut-off device to enforce its desegregation guidelines, its institutional competence vis-a-vis the courts has probably been exaggerated.56 It is by no means self- evident that the "administration [of desegregating schools] is largely where it ought to be -in the hands of the executive." 57 In fact, throughout the five years of HEW involvement, its Office of Education has been chronically understaffed. Indeed, the guidelines were issued in the first place only because HEW was unable to devote individualized attention to each desegre- gating school district.58 By contrast, the federal court system is much more decentralized and better able to appreciate and deal with local problems. The local residents are consequently more likely to accept a district court's judgment and less likely to resist the "nationalization" of their school system.59 Moreover, the courts are better able to deal with whatever political opposition to integration does develop. HEW is par- ticularly vulnerable to the intervention of a meddling congress- man or the political strategy of an incumbent president,60 and zones, and large-scale busing. See Fiss, Racial Imbalance in the Public Schools: The Constitutional Concepts, 78 HARV. L. REV. 564, 571-74 (I965). 55The Court will necessarily face similar problems in the South, if as seems likely, de jure segregation is replaced by de facto segregation in big city southern schools. 56 Moreover, even without the falling out between the executive and judicial branches which Alexander signals, HEW may be statutorily barred from helping in the implementation of the maximal Brown rule.

In contrast, the courts have demonstrated a will- ingness to resist considerable political pressure. Nor is it clear that HEW is better equipped institutionally to deal with delaying tactics of recalcitrant school boards.3 While the HEW review procedure is extremely cumbersome,64 the courts have at their disposal 6' flexible remedies which they can utilize under their broad equity jurisdiction. They can, for example, issue imme- diate temporary restraining orders and support them, if neces- sary, with contempt citations. It will still be true, no doubt, that judges will feel uncomfort- able making technical educational decisions without expert assist- ance. But if, as HEW's supporters contend,66 the Department's role is analogous to that of a special master, then there seems no reason why the courts cannot appoint independent special masters who will be able to resist political pressure while aiding the courts in making the hard choices.67 But although far-reaching judicial desegregation remains a theoretical possibility after Alexander, it seems unlikely as a practical matter that much new ground will be broken. Court decisions following passage of the I964 Act have been described as an "attempted transfer of power from one institution to an- other." 68 Now that the Court is no longer willing to accept without question the advice of HEW, it begins to appear that the attempt might have been all too successful and that the power, once transferred, may not easily be recouped. In their rush to build up HEW as a worthy recipient of the mantle of desegrega- tor, the courts began to describe their own competence with ex- treme humility. For example, in recounting the twelve year effort to bring about desegregation, Judge Wisdom stated without qual- 61 See note 37 supra. 62See, e.g., Cooper v. Aaron, 358 U.S. i (1958). While there is undoubtedly a limit beyond which no organ of a democratic government will or can go in resisting the majority will, it seems clear that the breaking point comes earlier for the executive branch than for the courts. 63 But cf. Davis v. Board of School Comm'rs, 364 F.2d 896, 898 (5th Cir. I966). 64 See Note, supra note 58, at 353-54. 65 It is ironic that Judge Wisdom, while making a detailed argument for judicial incompetence, undercut his own position by providing a flexible and effective rem- edy which could serve as a model for future judicial desegregation.

Of course the dicta of Judge Wisdom and others might be dismissed as implicitly overruled by Alexander. But the continued viability of lower court desegregation rulings rests peculiarly on the confidence which a reluctant or resisting citizenry maintains in its courts. Now that tho courts themselves have gone out of their way to undermine that confidence, it will not be easily restored. Obviously, the minimal Brown rule remains firmly entrenched. There now seems little doubt that the task of ending officially imposed segregation will be carried through to its successful con- clusion, at least in the South. Some judges may even go further and begin to grapple on their own with the difficult problems of big city racial imbalance.75 But they must be prepared to have Judge Wisdom's words thrown back at them.

'" Professor Bickel has put it more bluntly: A court is not qualified to order large-scale bussing to distant areas; it is not qualified to decide that the neighborhood school system should be abandoned, or that the so-called Princeton plan of consolidating several grades from a number of neighborhoods in one school can be suitably applied; it is not qualified to esti- mate the tipping point at which a desegregated school will re- segregate -and such judgments will not, and ought not, be accepted from a court.78 Criticisms such as these, seemingly supported by the past attitude of the federal judiciary itself, are likely to make a fed- eral judge think long and hard before he orders the reorganization of a big city school system - an order which, according to Pro- fessor Bickel, would not and should not be obeyed. Moreover, the courts would have to develop a whole new body of law to deal with the problems that would almost surely arise. The Su- preme Court's rigid standards for recalcitrant southern school districts have no place in the remedying of de facto segregation. The Court has made clear, for example, that the flight of whites from the school system does not change the obligation of south- ern school districts to desegregate immediately and totally.79 While this position suggests a propensity for tilting at windmills, it makes some sense when the Court is still fighting to establish an absolute legal principle in the face of sustained resistance. But in big cities, delicate social engineering is a prerequisite to keeping whites in the public school system, and such heavy- handed absolutism promises only disaster. Yet a more flexible rule opens the Court to charges of unequal treatment and re- gional discrimination, thus increasing enforcement problems in both rural and urban areas. Such enforcement problems -both external and self-created are likely to make the courts extremely reluctant to embark on a new and uncharted battle for integration without the aid of the executive branch. Moreover, the defection of HEW comes at a time when the very goal of integrated education is increas- ingly subject to question. It is argued that the real problems with big city education are sluggishness and ineptitude, that de- "Note, Hobson v. Hansen: Judicial Supervision of the Color-Blind School Board, 8i HARV. L. REV.

Polls continue to show the vast majority of blacks in favor of integrated education and desirous of becoming part of the American mainstream.81 While a few black leaders have recently espoused separatist doctrine, even some "militants" remain dedicated to the notion that blacks and whites may still be able to work together.82 The two cases frequently cited 83 as dramatic evidence of the new black resist- ance to integration - Norwalk CORE v. Norwalk Board of Edu- cation 84 and Coppedge v. Franklin County Board of Education 85 - in fact illustrate a quite different proposition: blacks are in- creasingly unwilling to accept "one way busing" or bear the full cost of desegregation alone. But even if it were true that black parents no longer want integration, it is hard to see why this fact should be controlling. There is a state interest in at least a minimal degree of assimila- tion - an interest which cannot be satisfied by community con- trol or decentralization unaccompanied by desegregation. No doubt, the original Brown opinion was at least partially grounded on the concept of associational freedom,86 and this ground is undercut if neither side wishes to associate with the other. But if one also assumes that there is harm to the entire society in having within its borders hostile and separate racial groupings which have no contact with one another,87 then the Brown hold- ing endures even after the associational argument falls. It might still be argued that there is a countervailing indi- vidual interest opposing coerced association -a freedom not to 80 See A. BICKEL, supra note 4I, at I38-39. 81 See, e.g., N.Y.

The Supreme Court may yet come to agree with Dr. Seuss that "a person's a person, no matter how small," 90 but so long as parents are legally permitted to make choices for their children, it is not meaningful to talk of freedom of associa- tion in the context of school integration.9' It is the parents, after all, who have the freedom and the children who do the associating. The right of an individual to choose his personal associates may well be fundamental, but the right of a parent to impose a so- cially harmful isolation on his children is not nearly so crucial.92 Compulsory attendance laws are premised on the notion that there are some choices which are so undesirable that a parent may not force his child to adopt them. If an integrated society is really an essential element in the fight for black equality, then the decision to impose a racially isolated education on a child would seem to be such a choice. But whether integration remains an important objective or not, it is clear that at least some influential people now think it 88 See Wechsler, supra note 86, at 34. 89 The right of the government to compel personal association, as by forbid- ding racial discrimination in schools, housing, public facilities, clubs and the like . . . is surely not subject to resolution in terms of a blanket right of association or non-association.

Incarceration of Indigents Unable to Pay Criminal Fines. - In Williams v. Illinois 1 the Supreme Court carried the equal protection banner into a new area of criminal justice, ruling for the first time on the practice of imposing time in jail as an alter- native to payment of criminal fines.2 Chief Justice Burger, writ- ing for a seven-man majority, limited but did not abolish a nation- wide practice 3 which, according to several studies, provides about one-half of the current county jail population.4 The majority held that a state could no longer incarcerate an indigent for failing to pay his fine or court costs in a lump sum if the consequent aggre- gate time in jail would exceed the maximum prison term set by statute for the crime of which he was found guilty.5 In lieu of lump sum payment the defendant must be offered some alterna- tive method, such as an installment plan,6 to pay his fine.

While the indigent prisoner who remains in jail for the additional iOi days is thereby absolved of the fine which his affluent coun- terpart must pay, the Court apparently concluded that his aggre- gate punishment was qualitatively harsher than the mix of jail and fine imposed on the wealthy defendant, and it could find no difference in culpability to support such a distinction.'7 The Court assumed that the purpose of default imprisonment was to provide a means for collecting money from the defendant 18 rather than a form of alternative punishment 19 and it found this purpose too insubstantial to support a distinction between rich and poor.20 generally 399 U.s. at 246-59 (Appendix). The Court's approach leaves open the possibility that at different exchange rates -perhaps one day in jail for one hundred dollars -the sharpness of the distinction between rich and poor might fade, and the equal protection rationale would lose its force. 16 399 U.s. at 242. 17 Although explicitly relying on the equal protection clause, the Court did not purport to decide whether the facts of the case called for strict scrutiny of the statute, or whether a rational relationship 6f means to a permissible purpose would suffice to uphold the legislative scheme. Cf. Developments in the Law- Equal Protection, 82 HARV. L. REV. io65, I077-78, II20-23 (ig6g). Compare Griffin v. Illinois, 35I U.S. I2 (Ig56), with McGowan v. Maryland, 366 U.S. 420 (I96I). It does seem clear, however, that the Court was using a standard more rigorous than the restrained review generally employed in economic equal pro- tection cases. In McGowan, for example, the Court was willing to uphold the statute provided it could find any conceivable purpose to support it. 366 U.S. at 425-26. By contrast, the state had asserted in Williams a very definite purpose the need to collect fines- yet its scheme was invalidated. Without suggesting that the purpose was irrational or impermissible, the Court seemed to weigh it against the defendant's interests and to find it too trivial to support the infringe- ment of defendant's liberty. Cf. Williams v. Rhodes, 393 U.S. 23, 30 (i968). A further inference that the Court was employing a rigorous standard of review arises from the opinion's frequent citation of, and quotation from, Griffin v. Illinois, a strict scrutiny case. See also In re Antazo, Crim. No. 13857 (Calif., Sept. 3, 1970) at i9 (state must show compelling interest to justify default imprisonment practice). In view of the Court's apparent conclusion that the infringement of defendant's liberty mandated a careful standard of review, it might have phrased its result in the language of less restrictive means analysis. Cf. Shapiro v. Thompson, 394 U.S. 6i8, 637 (I969). Thus, permitting payment of fines on the installment method would satisfy the state's interest in enforcing the judgment against de- fendant while minimizing the restriction of his liberty.

It should be made clear, however, that methods other than installment payment are still available.22 Furthermore, the installment payment plans now in operation seem to have achieved high compliance rates,23 and the Court apparently concluded that the state should carry the burden of demonstrating that an installment plan would not be successful.24 Chief Justice Burger's majority opinion emphatically limits the Court's holding to cases in which default imprisonment would extend the defendant's prison term beyond the statutory maxi- mum.

He argued that the state had infringed Williams's constitutionally protected interest in liberty without dem- onstrating the default imprisonment scheme's rational relationship to any permis- sible legislative purpose. As one possible justification for the statute he considered the administrative convenience to the state of jailing prisoners rather than trying to collect fines from them in installments, but he rejected this purpose as in- sufficient to justify the infringement of a defendant's liberty. He also considered the possibility that "the jail alternative serves a penological purpose that cannot be served by collection of a fine over time." Id. at 264. But finding nothing in the record to indicate that the state legislature had grounded the default imprison- ment scheme on any such determination, id. at 265, he deemed it constitutionally infirm. He did suggest, however, that even an "alternative punishment" rationale might fail the rationality test, calling it a "highly doubtful proposition" that an installment fine would have less deterrent force than a lump sum fine, because "the deterrent effect of a fine is apt to derive more from its pinch on the purse than the time of payment."

In view of its prior reluctance to intervene in punishment cases,26 the Court's cautious approach in Williams is hardly surprising. Nevertheless, the boundaries of the Court's holding cannot be conceptually limited to the facts in Williams and, consequently, are unlikely to persevere. Where default imprisonment results in incarceration beyond the statutory maximum term the discrimination between rich and poor seems sharpest. In establishing a maximum jail term for a particular crime the state has presumably considered the peno- logical purposes of incarceration, as opposed to a fine, and drawn a line that satisfies its interests in deterrence, retribution, and rehabilitation.27 Extension of an indigent's term beyond this line subjects him to a penalty which an affluent defendant need never endure and which the state has expressly disclaimed any need to impose.2' But essentially the same problem of arbitrary exten- sion of imprisonment exists even when imprisonment does not ex- tend beyond the statutory maximum.9 While the state-through its statute - may have defined the maximum jail term ever re- quired by its penological interests, it has delegated to its trial judges the responsibility of deciding the maximum term of incar- ceration required in each particular case. As the state's sentencing 26 Trial courts have traditionally been afforded an almost unassailable discretion to choose criminal penalties for convicted defendants. See Williams v. New York, 337 U.S. 24I, 247 (i949). 27 Cf. 399 U.S. at 24I-42, 264; ABA PROJECT, supra note 6, at I2I; A. SUTHER- LAND &amp; D. CRESSEY, PRINCIPLES OF CRIMINOLOGY 330 (7th ed. I966). 28 A state could argue, of course, that it must impose an additional jail term because payment of a fine in a lump sum has penological value which cannot be obtained from payment in installments. But under the Court's strict standard of review, see notes I7, 20 supra, the state apparently failed to carry its burden of demonstrating that installment payment would not satisfy its penological interests. Cf. 399 U.S. at 264-65 (Harlan, J., concurring). While the Court did not de- scribe the precise burden on the state, its apparent conclusion that the state did not demonstrate the inefficacy of installment payment seems justified by the state's failure even to make the argument or offer evidence undercutting appellant's evi- dence and assertions. Compare Brief for Appellant at I9-2I, Williams v. Illinois, 399 U.S. 235 (1970), with Brief for Appellee at I3-15, Williams v. Illinois, 399 U.S. 235 (1970). 29 The Court was offered an opportunity to reach this question in Morris v. Schoonfield, 399 U.S. 508 (1970), a class habeas corpus action brought by Mary- land prisoners, which squarely raised the issue. The case was remanded, however, in light of the companion decision in Williams and a new Maryland statute which permits, but does not require, that a judge provide for installment payment of fines when sentencing a convicted indigent.</page><page sequence="50">I970] THE SUPREME COURT, I969 TERM 51 agent, the trial judge prescribes an amount of imprisonment which reflects his view of the defendant, the crime, and the state's in- terests.30 Consequently, it is just as needlessly discriminatory to hold the defendant in jail beyond this line as it is to incarcerate him beyond the less particularized statutory line.3' The infringe- ment of the defendant's liberty is no less substantial when the default imprisonment does not extend beyond the statutory maxi- mum term. The burden of spending an extra day in jail is, after all, equally onerous whether it is appended before or after de- fendant has served the maximum term. Still, in those cases in which the statutory maximum is not exceeded by adding default imprisonment time to the original jail term, the trial judge could have imposed the aggregate jail term directly. It might be argued, therefore, that a prisoner should not be heard to complain about a sentence which does not exceed what he could have received in the original proceeding. Nonetheless, it is surely significant that the trial court, despite its undoubted power to impose the aggregate jail term originally and directly, selected instead a shorter term of imprisonment. The maximum sentence might have been imposed directly with- out violating the defendant's rights, but once a shorter sentence has been announced the state cannot then extend it up to the maximum term in an arbitrary or irrational manner.32 Five members of the Court have already announced in con- curring opinions their conclusion that the statutory maximum will not serve as a logically defensible limit on judicial interven- tion.33 It seems likely, therefore, that the lower courts will use the Williams rationale to require an installment payment option 30Cf. Williams v. New York, 337 U.S. 24I, 247 (I949). 31 In his concurring opinion based on due process analysis, see note 20 supra, Justice Harlan concluded that the relevant line was the sentencing court's determin- ation of how much incarceration was required. He would bar any default im- prisonment that extends a defendant's jail term over this line. See 399 U.S. at 265 &amp; n.* (Harlan, J., concurring). 32 Cf. Douglas v. California, 372 U.S. 353 (I963) (state must provide indigents with counsel for first appeal even though state not constitutionally required to grant an appeal); Van Alstyne, The Demise of the Right-Privilege Distinction in Constitutional Law, 8i HARV. L. REV. I439, I45I-54 (I968). 3 Justice Harlan announced this conclusion in his Williams concurrence, see note 3I supra. In the companion case of Morris v. Schoonfield, 399 U.S. 508 (I970), Mr. Justice White, joined by Justices Douglas, Brennan, and Marshall, pointed out in a concurring opinion that "the same constitutional defect con- demned in Williams also inheres in jailing an indigent for failing to make im- mediate payment of any fine, whether or not the fine is accompanied by a jail term and whether or not the jail term of the indigent extends beyond the maxi- mum term that may be imposed on a person willing and able to pay a fine." 399 U.S. at 509 (emphasis added).</page><page sequence="51">52 HARVARD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 84:I even where the aggregate sentence falls short of the statutory maximum.34 The second variation, seemingly furthest from the confines of the Williams decision,35 comprises sentences which offer the alter- native of a fine or a jail term, for example "$30 or 30 days," 36 instead of requiring both thirty days and thirty dollars. It might be argued that the days-or-dollars alternative is not designed to collect the fine, but instead reflects the state's determination that the fine and the jail term are options which the state considers penologically fungible. Thus, imprisonment is not caused by the failure to pay a fine, since payment was never required. It is instead an alternative criminal sanction deliberately formulated by the state to insure that its penological interests are satisfied.37 But a thirty dollars or thirty days sentence unaccompanied by an installment option effectively offers an indigent - just as Williams's sentence offered him - an illusory choice.38 Like Wil- liams, the indigent defendant in this context is told that the state would be satisfied with money. But instead of accepting his offer to pay the money in installments, the state requires him to serve time in jail.39 The state may, to be sure, believe that installment "Prior to Williams several courts had invalidated default imprisonment where it kept the defendant in jail longer than the maximum term authorized by statute. See, e.g., Sawyer v. District of Columbia, 238 A.2d 314 (D.C. Ct. App. i968); Strattman v. Studt, 20 Ohio St. 2d 95, 253 N.E.2d 749 (i969); cf. United States ex rel. Privitera v. Kross, 239 F. Supp. ii8, I2I (S.D.N.Y.), aff'd, 345 F.2d 533 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 382 U.S. 9II (i965) (approving default imprisonment where maximum term not exceeded). 35 The Court's opinion and the concurring opinion of Mr. Justice Harlan both specifically reserved judgment on this variation. See 399 U.S. at 243, 265. 36 399 U.S. at 265 (Harlan, J., concurring). 37 Chief Justice Burger appeared to acknowledge this argument in limiting the holding of the Court. See 399 U.S. at 245: "Nothing we hold today limits the power of the sentencing judge to impose alternative sanctions permitted by Illinois law; the definition of such alternatives, if any, lies with the Illinois courts." Some states may be reluctant, however, to assert the alternative punishment rationale in defense of days-or-dollars sentencing. The courts which impose these sentences frequently lack jurisdiction as a matter of state law to impose jail terms directly. They are able to circumvent the jurisdictional problem only by characterizing the jail term as a means of enforcing the properly imposed fine. See generally Note, supra note 4, at 793. Furthermore, adoption of the alternative punishment rationale may compel states to expand the right to jury trial. Under Duncan v. Louisiana, 39I U.S. I45 (I968), and Baldwin v. New York, 399 U.S. 66 (0970), jail terms longer than six months cannot be imposed without a jury trial. By explaining a jail term longer than six months as a means of collecting a fine, a state can attempt to distinguish Duncan by analogizing the enforcement method to civil contempt. 38 Cf. 399 U.S. at 242, citing Goldberg, Equality and Governmental Action, 39 N.Y.U.L. REV. 205, 22I (I964). 3 Days-or-dollars sentences can always be recharacterized to bring them</page><page sequence="52">1970] THE SUPREME COURT, 1969 TERM 53 payment does not satisfy its penological goals. But the Supreme Court indicated in Williams that it would use a strict standard of review and therefore applied its own balancing test to the inter- ests at stake.40 Under this standard, the state should have the same burden it had in Williams of proving that allowing an indi- gent to pay his fine in installments would so jeopardize its peno- logical interests as to require jailing the man. As Justice Harlan pointed out in his concurring opinion, it is "a highly doubtful proposition" that installment payment cannot satisfy the state's penological interests, since the impact of a fine is controlled more by the amount than the time of payment.4' Nevertheless, the state might deny the application of the equal protection clause in the days-or-dollars context by arguing that the judge, pursuant to his discretionary sentencing power, takes into account the defendant's means in establishing penological equivalents. If an indigent defendant who received a sentence of thirty days or thirty dollars were to suggest that an affluent de- fendant could easily pay the fine, the state might reply that an affluent defendant would not have received the same sentence. If the impact on the defendant of jail or fine were equalized in every case, the poor could not complain of consistently harsher treatment. It should be noted, however, that judges cannot take the time to particularize sentences to such a degree.49 The very cliche "thirty dollars or thirty days" suggests how mechanical the proc- ess becomes.43 And even if the judge were to hold an indigency within the conceptual framework of days-and-dollars sentences. A sentence of thirty days or thirty dollars, for example, is indistinguishable from a sentence of zero days and thirty dollars, with the thirty dollar fine convertible into a jail term at the exchange rate of one dollar per day. In other words, the state has de- clared that its penological interests require no time in jail, and "having declared itself satisfied by a fine, the alternative of jail to a fine serves neither a rehabili- tative nor a retributive interest." 399 U.S. at 264 (Harlan, J., concurring). See In re Antazo, Crim. No. I3857 (Calif. Sept. 3, I970) at 28 (default imprisonment provisions "may not be applied in such a way as to foreclose to the indigent of- fender the opportunity to obtain his freedom which is implicit in a sentence or probation order providing for payment of a fine"). 40 See note I7 supra. The Court has demonstrated its willingness in this con- text to look behind the statute's putative purpose and to balance that purpose against the individual's interests. 41399 U.S. at 264. 42 See generally Morris v. Schoonfield, 30I F. Supp. I58, I63-64 (D. Md. i969). 43 See Note, supra note 4, at 792 &amp; n.iio, citing 98 JIUSTICE OF THE PEACE AND LOCAL GOV'T REV. 520 (1934).

This value judgment should apply with the same force whether the days-for-dollars exchange rate is formulated by stat- ute or sentencing judge. While the judge should have discretion to adjust his sentence to the particular defendant, the choice between jail and fine -both satisfactory to the judge -should not be controlled by the fortuity of whether the defendant is a man of means. There is thus no basis for concluding that a sen- tence of thirty days or thirty dollars requires one constitutional rule, while thirty days and thirty dollars requires another.46 3. Reversion of Racially Discriminatory Trusts. -In I9II, United States Senator Augustus Bacon bequeathed to the city of Macon, Georgia, a ioo-acre tract of land to be held in trust as a park for the exclusive use of the city's white citizens. More than fifty years later, the Supreme Court held in Evans v. New- ton (Evans I)1 that the park could not be operated as a seg- regated facility. While the city of Macon had taken steps to eliminate its ties with the park and hence to vitiate the park's "public" character, the Court concluded that "where the tra- dition of municipal control had become firmly established, we cannot take judicial notice that the mere substitution of trustees instantly transferred this park from the public to the private sector." 2 Thus, even under private management, the park re- for the means of the particular defendant. In United States ex tel. Privitera v. Kross, 239 F. Supp. iI8 (S.D.N.Y. I965), for example, the state sentencing judge formulated a jail-fine alternative that computed to an exchange rate of about eight dollars per day, whereas the statutory minimum was two dollars. Neverthe- less, the eight dollar rate is within the range encompassed by state statutes, see note I5 supra, and it falls far short of a rate that would effectively mitigate the discriminatory burdens imposed on the poor. 44See Morris v. Schoonfield, 30I F. Supp. I58, I63-64 (D. Md. I969) (default imprisonment unconstitutional as applied unless the defendant is given an op- portunity to demonstrate to the sentencing judge his inability to pay a fine).

Last Term in Evans v. Abney (Evans II)' the Supreme Court upheld a state supreme court ruling 5 which returned the property to the heirs. As a matter of state trust law, the Georgia court's decision was not inevitable. A well established canon of testamentary con- struction provides that where a charitable trust would fail because of impossible or illegal conditions, a court can save the trust by applying the doctrine of cy pres.6 This doctrine, adopted in Georgia, permits a court to authorize a derogation from the strict terms of a trust that provides no specific reverter for breach of a condition, provided that the donor's general charitable intent is still effectuated.7 But because the desire to exclude blacks was found to be an inseparable part of the Senator's testamentary intent,8 the state supreme court refused to excise the "whites only" condition. Mr. Justice Black, speaking for five Justices, concluded that the Georgia court had made a constitutionally permissible use of its discretion in interpreting wills. He found the decision unmotivated by any racial animus.' The Court's decision to uphold the reverter seems harsh. First, the heirs have now received a valuable piece of property -improved by the city at taxpayer expense 10 on which they have paid no taxes and expended no capital. Their windfall came at the expense of the citizens of Macon, white as well as black, 'See also Pennsylvania v. Brown, 392 F.2d I20 (3d Cir. i968), cert. denied, 39I U.S. 92I (i968) (state court substitution of private trustees for public trustees of trust with racially restrictive condition held unconstitutional). 4 396 U.S. 435 (I970).

He also pointed out that conveying the prop- erty to the Senator's heirs would not necessarily preserve his segregationist purpose since many "private" uses of the land -for example, establishing a theater or restaurant -would require the owners to admit blacks as well as whites. In a separate dissent, Mr. Justice Brennan argued that the closing of the park was infected with discriminatory state action. "0See 396 U.S. at 45I-52 (Brennan, J., dissenting).</page><page sequence="55">56 HARVARD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 84: I who have been denied the park's benefits. Moreover, the black citizens of Macon might pay a separate and heavy price as po- tential scapegoats for the closing of the park. At the same time, they may see but one interpretation of the episode: the state has preferred the closing of the park to its integration. Thus, the blacks must simultaneously bear the wrath of the white commu- nity and the stigma of seeming state discrimination.1" Further- more, the decision seems to deprive the plaintiffs in Evans I, and indeed all the black citizens of Macon, of the victory they had achieved in that case. And finally, the Court's decision is un- supported by any significant policy consideration. It might be argued that the untrammeled right to dispose of private property in even a discriminatory manner enhances the diversity of soci- ety and encourages private philanthropy.12 But unlike a case of purely private action, the discrimination in Evans substantially implicated the state. Since the city of Macon had been the trustee of the park and had maintained it at public expense, a different result in Evans II need not have jeopardized the putative benefits of private discrimination.13 Yet it is not at all clear that any other result could have been reached. While there are, to be sure, a number of doctrines which point toward the opposite result, each of these apparently falls short of providing a defensible basis for reversing the state court decision. The state court's refusal to preserve the trust by applying cy pres arguably amounted to discriminatory enforcement of a 11 Cf. Brown v. Board of Educ., 347 U.S. 483, 494 (I954). The state action requirement is thought to reflect, in part, a recognition that discrimination by the state has greater impact than discrimination by private persons. See Adickes v. S.H. Kress &amp; Co., 398 U.S. I44, I90-9I (I970) (Brennan, J., concurring and dissenting). 12 Cf. Bell v. Maryland, 378 U.S. 226, 3I3 (I964) (Goldberg, J., concurring); A. Cox, THE WARREN COURT 37 (I968). 13 While the state may have an interest in encouraging the establishment of even discriminatory charitable trusts, it is unclear whether this interest is better protected by requiring application of cy pres in every case, or barring it entirely. If potential donors assumed that the cy pres doctrine would be invoked to pre- vent reversion, they might be discouraged from establishing trusts. On the other hand, the mandatory application of cy pres would prevent the destruction by re- version of the discriminatory trusts already in existence. It is therefore impossible to predict the impact of Evans II on the state's interests in encouraging and pre- serving charitable trusts. For this reason, expanding the scope of 42 U.S.C. ? I982 (I964) ("All citizens . . .shall have the same right . . . to inherit . . . real and personal property") to prohibit racially restrictive trusts would not necessarily serve the state's interest in charitable trusts, and might introduce unwelcome restraints on other types of private testamentary disposition.</page><page sequence="56">1970] THE SUPREME COURT, I969 TERM 57 neutral state rule.'4 Nevertheless, while Georgia courts have al- most invariably used cy pres to preserve charitable trusts that lack specific reverters and whose conditions can no longer be fulfilled,'" it does not follow that the failure to invoke the doc- trine in this case was discriminatory. The application of cy pres turns, after all, on the intent of the testator,'1 and Senator Ba- con's will can plausibly be read to say that he would have found an integrated park less desirable than no park at all.'7 Another method by which the Court might have invalidated the reversion is suggested by cases finding discriminatory state action in state encouragement of private acts of discrimination.'8 Six years before Senator Bacon drafted his will the Georgia leg- islature enacted a statute explicitly authorizing the establish- ment of charitable trusts with racially restrictive conditions.' Since there had been considerable doubt whether, as a matter of state law, such conditions were valid absent the legislation,20 the state had arguably encouraged Senator Bacon's act and was therefore implicated in it. Thus, as Mr. Justice White contended in Evans IJ21 the city should not be permitted to hide behind the state action requirement and blame Senator Bacon's "private" act for its own refusal to admit blacks to the park. Nonetheless, this argument runs exclusively to Evans I. There, the city was attempting to implement the Senator's discriminatory act, an act for which the state was in part responsible. In Evans II, by contrast, the private act to which the state offered its support was not the drafting of the will by Senator Bacon, but rather the decision by his heirs to secure a reversion once the condition had 14 Cf. Yick Wo v. Hopkins, ii8 U.S. 356, 373-74 (i886).

Kraemer, 334 U.S. I (948); see Ex parte Virginia, IOO U.S. 339, 347 (i88o). Nevertheless, it will always be very difficult to prove dis- criminatory judicial action because of the wide discretion customarily left to the judiciary. Cf.

Moreover, the Georgia courts have demonstrated some reluctance to invoke cy pres where it would produce a major change in the class of persons who benefit from the trust. See Ford v.

Second, it would be necessary to conclude that the state had so far insinuated itself into the ostensibly private decision to seek reversion as to make that decision tantamount to state action. Both of these conclu- sions seem highly dubious. In attempting to enforce the reverter, the action of Senator Bacon's heirs was not obviously discrimina- tory. They were presumably motivated by the desire to obtain valuable land to which they seemed entitled, and the result of their suit was to deny the use of the park to whites as well as blacks. Since the act of seeking reversion was not discriminatory, it could not give rise to a violation of the equal protection clause even if the state had been involved. In any case, it is difficult to posit state involvement on these facts since nothing in the record indicates that the state encouraged the heirs to bring their suit.23 It might also be argued that the reversion should not have been permitted on these facts because its effect was to deny the black citizens of Macon the fruits of their victory in Evans I. In other situations the Court has invalidated state practices, not in themselves unconstitutional, which undermine the integrity of the Court's constitutional decisions. Thus, the "fruit of the poisonous tree" doctrine 24 bars a state from using inadmissible evidence so as to accomplish by indirection a result that the Constitution precludes it from reaching directly. Nevertheless, a "fruits of victory" rationale - speculative in any context - is especially hard to maintain on the facts of Evans, for it was the private decision to enforce the reverter, not any state act, that deprived the blacks of their victory. Moreover, it is essential to consider the precise definition of the "victory" in Evans I. The Court did not impose on the city 22 It could be argued, to be sure, that the encouragement of Senator Bacon's original decision had invalidated the racially restrictive condition as of the moment the will was drafted. But even this argument would not affect the result in Evans II. It would surely remain the role of the state court to interpret the will in light of the invalidity of one of its major clauses. 23 An argument based on Robinson v. Florida, 378 U.S. I53 (I964), and the other civil rights sit-in cases, would also presumably fail. In those cases the Court found that the state had encouraged private discriminatory actions, and it was therefore estopped from denying its own role in the discrimination. Since the state was not a party in Evans II, the estoppel approach has no application. 24See Silverthorne Lumber Co. v. United States, 25I U.S. 385, 392 (I920) ("The essence of a provision forbidding the acquisition of evidence in a certain way is that not merely evidence so acquired shall not be used before the Court but that it shall not be used at all"); cf.

It merely held that the park could not be operated as a segregated facility either by the city or the private persons who were the city's successor trustees. Thus defined, the victory in Evans I was not jeopardized by the decision in Evans II. On the con- trary, the Court could have used the "fruits of victory" rationale only by reading Evans I as mandating a degree of affirmative integration not clearly required even in the context of public schools.25 Nor could reversal have been predicated on Griffin v. County School Board,26 in which the Supreme Court invalidated an effort to avoid integration by shutting down the public schools. What- ever the force of the punitive closing argument,27 it is clear that the park was closed because of a private civil law suit to enforce the terms of a will, and not because of any voluntary action of the city. Indeed, the state attorney general intervened in the action, arguing for the application of cy pres.28 To defeat the punitive closing argument, the city could thus assert its reluctance to give up the park and its willingness to operate it as an integrated facility. But if it were to assume this posture, the city would lend force to the argument that Shelley v. Kraemer 29 should bar the use of state courts to enforce Sen- ator Bacon's private discrimination. The applEcation of Shelley is arguably confined to cases of state interference in transactions between willing parties.30 Thus, in a suit brought to enforce a racially restrictive covenant the judicial decision to intervene be- tween the willing buyer and willing seller is deemed unconsti- tutional state action. By analogy, it might be argued that Shelley applied here because the city of Macon was willing to admit blacks to the park and they were willing to use it. Yet in reality the facts of Evans must be stretched to fit within the Shelley framework.3' It was the state attorney general, not a representa- 25 See PP. 38-39 supra. 26377 U.S. 2I8 (I964). 27 The Griffin rationale rested in large part on the special role of public schools and on the geographic discrimination inherent in providing public schools in some counties but not in others. See Developments in the Law- Equal Protection, 82 HARV. L. REV. IO65, IO95-96 (I969). The rationale may, therefore, be wholly inapplicable in this context. 28 %96 U.S. at 439. 29334 U.S. I (948).

Since the city was the trustee of the park, its willingness to integrate is presumably more relevant than the state's. Yet the city never provided an unequivocal indication of its desire to integrate the park. On the contrary, while the city had opened the park to blacks during its trusteeship, it later took steps to obviate the need for inte- gration by turning the park over to private trustees. At the time of Evans II the park was controlled by these private trustees, and there is no indication that they were willing to admit blacks except pursuant to a Court order. In other words, the best read- ing of the facts may well be that the city, the state, and the pri- vate trustees were sufficiently willing to integrate as to undercut the punitive closing argument, but not so willing as to bring the doctrine of Shelley v. Kraemer into play. Nevertheless, the Court's decision in Evans II need not deter trustees of charitable trusts from ignoring racially restrictive conditions. A small change in the Evans facts might well have produced a different result. Specifically, if the trustees had as- serted unequivocally their willingness to admit blacks, the anal- ogy to Shelley v. Kraemer would have been more persuasive. But a trustee willing to violate a racial condition and thereby risk reversion of the trust must be prepared to argue that the policy against discrimination warrants extension of the "willing parties" rationale. He will have to argue, for example, that trustees should be free to adjust their trusts to changing social conditions, and that it would be undesirable to enrich private heirs at the expense of the charitable trust's beneficiaries.32 Still, in view of the un- certainty of Shelley v. Kraemer's application and the consequent danger of forfeiting the entire trust, it will be a courageous trustee who disregards a discriminatory condition in reliance on a narrow reading of Evans II. 4. State Maximum Grant Regulations Under Federal Welfare Laws. - Dandridge v. Williams,' more strongly than any other case this Term, suggests that the Court is moving toward a nar- rower conception of its judicial role. The Court no longer seems willing to extend the scope of meaningful equal protection re- view beyond racial classifications and constitutionally guaran- teed rights. Applying this narrower view of equal protection, Dandridge upheld the validity of Maryland's maximum welfare grant regulation.2 The regulation limited to $250 per month racially restrictive condition. The court held that the state could not enforce the condition. 32 See RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF TRUSTS ? 399, comment i (I959). 1397 U.S. 47I (1970). 2 Maryland Manual of Dep't of Social Services, Rule 200, ?

Plaintiffs, whose grants had been limited by the maximum,4 brought an action under federal statute 5 to declare the regulation invalid and to enjoin its enforcement. A three- judge district court held that the regulation violated the equal protection clause.6 On direct appeal, the Supreme Court reversed, 5-3, holding that the Maryland maximum grant regulation did not con- flict with the Social Security Act and that it did not violate the equal protection clause. In an opinion by Mr. Justice Stewart, the Court 7 held that the Maryland practice was compatible with 342 U.S.C. ?? 6oi-io (I964), as amended, (Supp. IV, I969).

Mr. Justice Harlan also joined the Court's opinion, but with the reservation that all equal protection cases not involving racial classifications, including those involving constitutional rights, see, e.g., Shapiro v. Thompson, 394 U.S. 6i8 (I969), should be decided under a standard of review testing only the rationality of the classification. There were two dissenting opinions. Mr. Justice Douglas objected to the Court's statutory analysis on the ground that the regulation conflicted with the Social Security Act by denying assistance to certain eligible individuals and by encouraging disintegration of large families. By basing his dissent on the statutory ground, Mr. Justice Douglas tacitly rejected the proposition that he himself had stated in his concurring opinion in King v. Smith, 392 U.S. 309, 334-35 (I968), that the Secretary of HEW's approval of the state scheme constitutes a binding administrative determination that the scheme was consistent with the federal statute. He justified his analysis by observing that the Secretary had never had an opportunity to consider this precise question. Mr. Justice Marshall, joined by Justice Brennan, agreed with Justice Douglas' statutory reasoning, but went further to attack the "Court's emasculation of the Equal Protection Clause as a constitutional principle applicable to the area of social welfare administration." 397 U.S. at 508. According to Justice Marshall, the Court should not apply different standards of review simply because an interest is classified as either fundamental or economic. Rather, it should in each case balance the state's interest in the challenged regulation against the individual's need for the benefit. Since welfare assistance is necessary to sustain the lives of its recipients, important state reasons must be advanced to justify inequalities in its distribution. Since his review of the regulation convinced him that it bore no rational relation to any legitimate governmental objective, Justice Marshall would have declared it unconstitutional under either his own balancing test or under the Court's restrained review.</page><page sequence="61">62 HARVARD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 84:1 the statutory requirement that aid be furnished "to all eligible individuals," 8 reasoning that the states have "undisputed power to set the level of benefits and the standard of need." 9 More im- portantly, the Court concluded that since the maximum grant regulation was of a "social and economic nature," it could be reviewed only under the traditional standards of restrained equal protection review: "A statutory discrimination will not be set aside if any state of facts reasonably may be conceived to justify it." 10 Mr. Justice Stewart acknowledged a "dramatically real factual difference" between regulation of business and welfare assistance, which "involves the most basic economic needs of impoverished human beings." But he denied that the difference justifies applying a different constitutional standard of review.1" Accordingly, he thought it clear that the Maryland maximum was constitutionally valid, since there were legitimate state interests to which it conceivably could be related. More specif- ically, he thought the regulation was valid as a means of elim- inating the disincentive to work created by a situation in which welfare families receive benefits disproportionate to the wages of the working poor. That the regulation was not perfectly designed to achieve that objective was thought insufficient to invalidate it under the traditional standard of review. In Dandridge, the Supreme Court once again faced the diffi- cult task of reconciling the fourteenth amendment's command of equal protection with the notion that in a democratic society the political rather than the judicial branch is responsible for allo- cating the burdens and benefits deriving from the govern- ment. The tools of reconciliation available to the Court were the two quite different standards of equal protection review which it had fashioned in its earlier encounters with the task.12 Under the traditional standard, a court will overturn the legislature's classificatory scheme only when the scheme is so palpably arbi- trary that the court cannot conceive of any constitutionally per- missible objective to which it might be rationally related.13 In 842 U.S.C. ? 602(a) (Io) (I964). 9 King v.

At the first level, the court will inquire whether the importance of the personal interests involved is so great as to outweigh the state's interest in being free to accomplish its objectives through rough accom- modations, rather than with scientific precision.2' But even if the state classifies precisely, the court will inquire further whether the state interests advanced by the classification are sufficient to 14 See Developments io87. 15 See, e.g., Kramer v.

Dandridge assumes the existence of these two different stand- ards of review,22 but it circumscribes severely the number of occasions on which strict scrutiny is proper. Disregarding an entire line of cases,23 Mr. Justice Stewart limited strict review to cases involving a classification "infected with a racially discrim- inatory purpose or effect," 24 or one which interferes with a "con- stitutionally protected freedom." 25 All other cases fall in "the area of economics and social welfare" 26 and are, therefore, to be accorded only restrained review. Justice Stewart's approach 27 derives from the Court's desire for standards for defining the "inner circle" 28 of interests protected by active review in a way that eliminates the necessity for judges to engage in a sub- jective "value-sculpting" 29 in reaching that decision.30 This approach overlooks the existence of a substantial body 22 Although Justice Marshall, in his dissent, seemed to eschew the bipartite equal protection approach, 397 U.S. at 520-2I, he nonetheless urged that the closeness of the judicial scrutiny should be a function of the importance of the personal interests infringed. See id. The difficulty with his approach, as opposed to a bipartite analysis, is that it does not clearly define the circumstances under which the Court will require of the legislature precision in its classifications. It thus creates too great a hazard of the Court's overturning the presumption in favor of the legislature and imposing on the other branches its own choice of values.

In those cases, the Court re- jected the suggestion, made by Justice Stewart in dissent, that the definition of fundamental rights was somehow inferable from the written text of the Constitution.33 The Court presumably did not intend to repudiate the cases extending special protec- tion to voting and criminal appeals. In fact, during the same Term, the Court further extended those two lines of cases.34 Thus, Dandridge can be read consistently with the Supreme Court's other equal protection decisions only as resting on one of two propositions. The first explanation may be that the Court, though it did not undertake the task explicitly, found voting and criminal appeals distinguishable from welfare so that the exten- sion of strict scrutiny to cases involving those interests did not require its extension to welfare. Alternatively, Dandridge may rest on the view that the Court erred initially in extending strict review beyond the Constitution because of the impossibility of limiting such an extension and that, therefore, the Court may arbitrarily refuse to expand any further the circle of fundamental interests. The choice of which interests are to be accorded special pro- tection is principally a function of the Court's own views on the importance of the interest.35 But the Court has, in its past de- cisions, elaborated certain determinants to help identify non-con- stitutional interests entitled to the protection of strict review: whether the deprivation will cause irreparable injury; 36 whether 31 See, e.g., Levy v.

Dawson, 350 U.S. 877, aff'g mem. 220 F.2d 386 (4th Cir. I955). 42 For example, the Court has made it perfectly clear that people cannot be deprived of certain important interests simply because they are indigent - the importance of the interest and the "suspectness" of the de facto wealth classifica- tion interact to require of the state great precision. See, e.g., Williams v. Illinois, 399 U.S. 235 (1970); McDonald v. Board of Election Comm'rs, 394 U.S. 802, 807 (i969) (dicta); Harper v. Board of Elections, 383 U.S. 663, 666-68 (i966); Douglas v.

Since he lacks independent resources, his situation becomes immediately desperate.... From its founding the Nation's basic commitment has been to foster the dignity and well-being of all persons within its borders. We have come to recognize that forces not within the control of the poor contribute to their poverty. . Welfare, by meeting the basic demands of subsistence, can help bring within the reach of the poor the same opportunities that are available to others to participate meaningfully in the life of the community. In Goldberg, the Court relied on the importance of welfare to justify extending to it special due process protection not ex- tended to other economic interests. The importance of welfare would seem equally to point to the conclusion that welfare is entitled to special protection under the equal protection clause. Goldberg seems to caution that since welfare is so important it is especially imperative that the political and administrative proc- esses operate justly with regard to it. Without active review, there is little check on a legislature bent on circumventing the political process in order to appropriate fewer funds for welfare than would otherwise be politically feasible by visiting the con- sequences of that action on a small minority of the poor.49 Active equal protection review, like the due process requirement of greater procedural safeguards, does not raise welfare to the sta- tus of a substantive constitutional right; it simply requires the state to use greater precision in the allocation of welfare.5" Moreover, the classification implicit in the maximum grant regulation resembles those classifications declared suspect in prior cases. The regulation operates to the disadvantage of a politi- cally weak minority; it divides that minority further by allocating funds so as to meet the subsistence needs of all but a few of the poor. Thus, the state makes it even less likely that the in- jured minority will have any meaningful political redress. Since 49 See note 43 supra. 50 Some commentators have argued that there is a constitutional right to wel- fare. See Bendich, Privacy, Poverty, &amp; The Constitution, 54 CALIF. L.

The basis of their argument seems to be some combination of the view that the Constitution presupposes subsistence and the view that the government, with partial control over the economy, is somehow implicated in the remaining indigency. Despite the visceral appeal of such a view, there are in- superable obstacles to a court's initiating such a radical change in the perceived responsibilities of the government. See Developments II9I-92.</page><page sequence="68">I970] THE SUPREME COURT, I969 TERM 69 political review is unlikely, the only review available to those suffering from the regulation is in the courts.5" In addition to resembling a presumptively invalid suspect classification, the distinction between large and small families drawn by the maximum grant regulation lacks the precise factual relationship to the asserted state interests necessary to sustain it under a standard of active review. With regard to the state's asserted interest in encouraging the poor to seek employment, the regulation is fatally imprecise: it is underinclusive because there are welfare recipients in small, as well as in large, families who are employable but do not seek work; it is overinclusive because it operates on all welfare recipients in large families regardless of whether any member of the family is employable; and there are less invidious means, already incorporated in the AFDC pro- gram,52 for encouraging employment. Nor is the maximum grant regulation well-tailored to the goal of encouraging family plan- ning. The regulation encourages family planning only among the poor. It thus seems to draw a de facto wealth line-indigent families are deterred from having large families because their welfare payments will not increase beyond a fixed maximum; the affluent, on the other hand, continue to receive an additional tax deduction for each additional child.53 Furthermore, even assum- ing that population control is a legitimate state objective, there is considerable question whether the state's interest outweighs the damage that may be done to an individual deprived of a subsistence level of welfare benefits. Thus, active review would have required holding the maximum grant regulation uncon- stitutional.54 The Court's decision to restrict active review to cases in- volving constitutional freedoms or race must, then, have been 5' As Mr. Justice Marshall noted in his dissent, 397 U.S. at 523, the classification also resembles the classification between legitimate and illegitimate children which the court condemned as a violation of the equal protection clause in Levy v. Louisiana, 39I U.S. 68 (I968), and Glona v. American Guarantee &amp; Liability Ins. Co., 39I U.S. 73 (I968). The classifications share two characteristics: the classifying trait in both instances is one over which the children have no control; both discriminations may impair the intimate familial relationship to which the Court has shown special sympathy. Cf. Loving v. Virginia, 388 U.S. i (I967) ; Griswold v. Connecticut, 38I U.S. 479 (I965). 52 For example, employable AFDC recipients are required to seek employment through the congressionally established Work Incentive Program.

The first was its apprehension that once strict scrutiny was extended to welfare there would be no way to limit its further extension beyond welfare to other important interests.55 The Court must, of course, resist the temptation to become a superlegislature reviewing every state statute, but Justice Stewart over-emphasized the difficulty of defining limiting principles circumscribing active review. The judgment called for in Dandridge -whether welfare is so im- portant an interest as to merit special protection -is the type of decision the Court has often made, most recently in Goldberg v. Kelly. So long as the Court extends special protection only to those interests which the community 56 perceives to be of clearly greater magnitude and identifies the determinants of the magnitude of a personal interest, it has satisfied, as well as it can, the need for principles by which to distinguish fundamental interests (such as welfare) from all others. The second fear was that since there are no easy standards for defining equality for purposes of welfare, strict scrutiny might require declaring all inequalities in its distribution invalid. This fear misapprehends the nature of active review. Active review does not invalidate every departure from a strictly equal distribution of burdens and benefits; a classification will be upheld provided it is precisely drawn to achieve a state objective that outweighs the personal interests involved.57 Holding that a maximum grant regulation is invalid does not mean that a state is barred from all classifica- tions of welfare recipients that attempt to achieve the aims al- legedly underlying the maximum grant regulation; 58 it simply means that in view of the importance of the personal interests at stake, the connection between those aims and the regulation is not sufficiently close to justify the resulting inequality. The Court, by acknowledging the "dramatically real factual differ- ence" between welfare and other economic interests and then refusing to extend active review to it because of unjustified "One of the other interests to which it has most frequently been urged that active review should be extended is education.

B. Civil Rights I. "Color of Law" Requirement of Section 1983. -On August I4, I964, Sandra Adickes, a white New York City school teacher who had volunteered to teach for the summer at a Missis- sippi Freedom School, took six black students to lunch at an S. H. Kress store in Hattiesburg. The waitress took the orders of Miss Adickes' students, but refused to serve her, allegedly stating "[w]e have to serve the colored, but we're not serving white people who come in with them." ' Unable to eat together, the group left the store.2 Subsequently, Miss Adickes brought suit against Kress in the Southern District of New York under 42 U.S.C. ? I983,3 alleging Kress had abridged her right under the equal protection clause of the fourteenth -amendment not to be discriminated against on account of race, and seeking damages for the wrongful refusal of service.4 Section I983 prohibits any person acting "under color of any ' Deposition of Sandra Adickes, quoted in Achtenberg v. Mississippi, 393 F.2d 468, 473 (5th Cir. i968) (on removal to federal court of Miss Adickes' subsequent vagrancy prosecution). 2 Miss Adickes was arrested immediately following this episode on a charge of vagrancy, a charge subsequently held, on removal of her prosecution to federal court, to have been "baseless and an unsophisticated subterfuge." Id. at 475 (Godbold, J., concurring and dissenting). This arrest formed the basis of a second theory of recovery advanced by Miss Adickes in her suit against Kress. She alleged that her arrest had been effected pursuant to a conspiracy between Kress personnel and Hattiesburg police which provided the requisite "state action" and action "under color" of law. See, e.g., United States v. Price, 383 U.S. 787, 794 n.7 (i966). Prior to trial, District Judge Bonsal entered summary judgment for Kress on this count, Adickes v. S. H. Kress &amp; Co., 252 F. Supp. I40 (S.D.N.Y. i966), and the Second Circuit affirmed, Adickes v. S. H. Kress &amp; Co., 4o9 F.2d I2I (2d Cir. i968). On certiorari, the Supreme Court reversed on grounds Kress had failed to show the absence of any disputed material fact concerning the existence of the conspiracy. 398 U.S. at I53-6i. 342 U.S.C. ? I983 (I964) provides: Every person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State or Territory, subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or im- munities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress.

Since Miss Adickes was seeking recovery for the violation of a fourteenth amendment right, it was neces- sary that she allege facts sufficient to satisfy the "state action" requirement that the fourteenth amendment imposes. It was her position that the customs of the people of the state, in addition to the customs of state officials, amounted to state action for four- teenth amendment purposes. Similarly she argued that "customs of the people" were "customs" within the meaning of section I983. It is a matter of common knowledge that there is and has been for centuries a "custom" of the people of Mississippi to segregate the races,5 so Miss Adickes sought to recover under her custom theory merely by showing the racially motivated refusal of service and introducing perfunctory evidence as to the custom.6 Miss Adickes made a second argument to establish grounds for recovery under section I983. She alleged Kress had acted "under color" of a Mississippi criminal trespass statute.7 This statute, passed in the wake of Brown v. Board of Education,8 for judicial revival of the I875 statute. See also United States v. Guest, 383 U.S. 745, 76I-62, 774-86 (I966) (opinions of Clark, J., joined by Black and Fortas, JJ., and Brennan, J., joined by Warren, C.J., and Douglas, J.); Katzenbach v. Morgan, 384 U.S. 641 (I966); Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co., 392 U.S. 409 (I968). But the judge denied leave to amend on the theory that the Kress lunch counter at which Miss Adickes had been denied service was not an "inn" within the meaning of the I875 statute. Miss Adickes challenged this ruling in her petition for certiorari to the Supreme Court, but the Court refused to hear the claim on grounds that it had not been raised in the court of appeals. 398 U.S. at I47 n.2. 5 See, e.g., J. SILVER, Mississippi: THE CLOSED SOCIETY (I964). 6 Miss Adickes herself testified to the existence of the custom although she had admittedly been in Mississippi but a short period. Two expert witnesses called by her to testify as to the custom were excluded by the trial judge on grounds plaintiff had provided opposing counsel with inadequate notice of her intention to call them.

Miss Adickes argued that such a statute necessarily encouraged private discrimination and that this was sufficient state involvement to satisfy the fourteenth amendment state action requirement.9 In a pretrial ruling 10 District Judge Bonsal held that, in order to recover under the "color of custom" theory, plaintiff would have to show that refusing to serve whites in the company of blacks was a specific custom which had been given the "force of law" by virtue of its enforcement under the Mississippi criminal trespass statute. This ruling had the effect of blurring the dis- tinction between the "color of statute" and "color of custom" theories, for it required the plaintiff to prove that the "custom" was enforced through the statute. Indeed, given Judge Bonsal's understanding of "custom having the force of law," the "custom" 'Miss Adickes' argument on this theory was somewhat involved. She relied on three sit-in cases, Peterson v. Greenville, 373 U.S. 244 (I963); Lombard v. Louisiana, 373 U.S. 267 (I963); and Robinson v. Florida, 378 U.S. I53 (I964); for the essence of her argument that legislative and executive encouragement of private discrimination sufficiently implicates the state for fourteenth amendment purposes. These cases had proceeded on the theory that purely private refusals of service that followed either the discouragement of integration (in Robinson, the state required separate toilet facilities for white and black persons) or the encour- agement of segregation by state officials (in Lombard, the mayor had made a speech which the Court interpreted as having the effect of encouraging the town's white citizens to continue to discriminate against Negroes) could not serve as the factual predicates for state trespass convictions. She then argued that though section 2046.5 was facially neutral, its passage would encourage private discrimination. Miss Adickes relied on the statute's history to prove that it would be used in a dis- criminatory manner. As noted, the section was passed contemporaneously with Brown v. Board of Education. Numerous other statutes passed at the same time reaffirmed the state policy of segregation. All of these statutes were initially indexed in the Mississippi session laws under "Segregation." Given this state intention to promote segregation of the races, Miss Adickes relied on Peterson to show that the state action must have influenced the private conduct. In that decision, the state had argued that the private decisions to discriminate, on the basis of which the criminal laws had been invoked, might not have been motivated by state encouragement of that discrimination. The private decision to discriminate might have been motivated wholly by the private party's personal opinions. The Court rejected this argument partially because it seemed inappropriate to permit the very party that had encouraged the segrega- tion to deny the natural effect of its actions, and partially because a contrary holding would have established a requirement that the plaintiff prove the "mental urges of the discriminators." 373 U.S. at 248. Apparently relying on the second rationale offered by the Court in Peterson, Miss Adickes argued that she was not required to show any causal connection between the state's encourage- ment of segregation and the private decision of Kress to discriminate. On this reasoning, so long as the state had manifested a desire to encourage segregation by means of a statute, every private act of discrimination would be "under color" of that statute, and hence actionable under section I983. 10 Adickes v. S. H. Kress &amp; Co., 252 F. Supp. I40 (S.D.N.Y. I966).</page><page sequence="73">74 HARVARD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 84:I language of section I983 would add nothing to its coverage. Upon conclusion of plaintiff's evidence, the judge directed a verdict for Kress, holding that Miss Adickes had failed adequately to es- tablish that Kress had acted with knowledge of and pursuant to a state-enforced custom. The Second Circuit, one judge dis- senting, affirmed.1' Last term, in Adickes v. S. H. Kress &amp; Co."2 the Supreme Court reversed, 5-2. In an opinion by Mr. Justice Harlan,13 the Court affirmed the lower courts' primary ruling, holding that Miss Adickes could recover under section I983 only by proving individual discrimination with knowledge of and pursuant to a custom having the force of law by virtue of persistent official prac- tices. But, the Court reasoned, the lower courts had erred in hold- ing that "state enforcement" of the custom could be proven only by presenting evidence related to the criminal trespass statute. On the record in Adickes the Court suggested two other factual bases which, if proved, would show discriminatory state enforce- ment of a custom. A "custom" of segregation might also have been "enforced" through intentional police toleration of violence or threats of violence against sit-in demonstrators, or through direct police harassment involving groundless arrests on any charges."4 The majority's conclusion that section I983 requires a "cus- tom having the force of law" is supported by arguments from history and precedent quite adequate to refute the position, urged by Miss Adickes and adopted by Justices Brennan and Douglas in dissent, that "custom" includes "customs of the people." But the majority make no attempt to define the phrase, "customs having the force of law." The examples selected by "l Adickes v. S. H. Kress &amp; Co., 409 F.2d I2I (2d Cir. i968). The court also held that to establish a "custom" for purposes of section I983, a practice "having the force of law" must be shown to exist not only in the locality, but also throughout the state in which the discrimination is alleged to have occurred. The Supreme Court reversed this holding on grounds that if a town ordinance could constitute state action, so could a local custom. Adickes v. S. H.

Justices Brennan and Douglas filed separate dissent- ing opinions, and Justice Black concurred in the judgment on grounds that even assuming the trial court had been right in its interpretation of section I983, the "evidence . . . was sufficient . . . to let the case go to the jury and secure petitioner's constitutionally guaranteed right to a trial by that jury." 398 U.S. at I78.

The Court also held that the lower court had erred in requir- ing a statewide custom, see note ii, supra, and in designating the relevant custom as refusing to serve whites accompanied by blacks rather than merely as segregating the races.</page><page sequence="74">I970] THE SUPREME COURT, 1969 TERM 75 the Court pertain only to customs of officers of the executive branch, and may thus carry the implication that other customs are to be excluded.'5 In any event, the arguments used by the majority to exclude "customs of the people" from the scope of section I983 give no hint of which customs are included. For example, in support of its reading of section I983 the majority first cites "an unbroken line of decisions, extending back many years," in which the Court had declared that action "under color of law" was a prerequisite to liability under the section.16 This phrase would certainly be misleading if purely private ac- tions could be reached under the custom language of the statute as the dissent contended. On the other hand, mere reference to "color of law" cannot suggest what sorts of state involvement might give a custom the force of law as required by the statute.'7 Precisely the same is true of the majority's reference to the remarks of the House and Senate floor managers of the Ku Klux Act of i871,18 predecessor of section I983. Both of these refer- ences involve undefined use of the shorthand phrase, "color of law." 19 While this phrase may be read to eliminate mere customs of the people, it provides no additional content for the phrase, "custom having the force of law." The one senator who is quoted as indicating his understanding that "custom" meant "custom or usage which has become common law" did not define his use of the latter phrase,20 and, moreover, made clear that there was no agreement concerning the meaning of the section.21 Indeed, if the debates establish anything conclusively, it is that there was no consensus as to the meaning of "custom." Four or five possible interpretations of the language were put forward during the debates.22 Contemporary legal definitions 15 The choice of examples carries this implication not only because it fails to include examples of legislative or judicial action, but also because one of the examples of police action was "suggested" far less clearly by the record in Adickes than was an example of legislative action. It was at most barely suggested by the record in Adickes that the police had tolerated threats of violence or violence against the plaintiff. On the other hand, plaintiff did argue that various Mississippi statutes could be judicially noticed as showing a statewide custom of segregation. See Brief for Petitioner at 35, Adickes v. S. H. Kress &amp; Co., 398 U.S. I44 (1970). The Court never deals with this claim on the merits. See p. 8o-8i, infra. 16 398 U.S. at I67. 17 The Court cites Pierson v.

In short, it is no doubt true of section I983, as Mr. Justice Frankfurter once remarked of related legislation, that "[s]trong post-war feeling caused inadequate deliberation and led to loose and careless phrasing." 25 An accurate interpretation of the word "custom" as it is used in section I983 is aided by reference to history, but not to the legislative history of the section. Rather, it is illuminating to return to Justice Bradley's opinion in the Civil Rights Cases.26 The Civil Rights Cases involved the constitutionality of sec- tions i and 2 of the Civil Rights Act of i875,27 which provided for the civil and criminal liability of any person who denied to any other person "the full and equal enjoyment" of various public accommodations. The Court was troubled by this legis- lation because it cast Congress in the role of legislating "a code of municipal law for the regulation of private rights," 28 a role traditionally left to the states. Erecting what has since become known as the "state action" doctrine, Justice Bradley concluded that the fourteenth amendment did not "invest Congress with power to legislate upon subjects which are within the domain of State legislation; but to provide modes of relief against State legislation or State action . . .. 29 By way of contrast to the i875 statute, which the Court found unconstitutional, Justice Bradley discussed the Civil Rights Act of i866, which contained the original "color" of law lan- guage. This statute was constitutional, he thought, precisely be- cause it was intended to "furnish redress against State laws and procedings, and customs having the force of law, which sanction the section reached only state legislation, (2) that the section reached only an undefined range of actions "under color of law," (3) that the section reached actions, including those taken under color of statute or custom having the force of common law, (4) that the section reached the purely private actions of private individuals, and (5) that the principal effect of the section was to remove the defense that the defendant had acted under the pretense of authority of a state law. 398 U.S. I44, 215-I7 n.25. 23 See, e.g., I S.

Going on to explain why the law was appropriate under the fourteenth amendment, Justice Bradley likened it to legislation under the contracts clause: 31 The Civil Rights Bill here referred to is analagous in its char- acter to what a law would have been under the original Constitu- tion, declaring that the validity of contracts should not be im- paired, and that if any person bound by a contract should refuse to comply with it, under color or pretence that it had been ren- dered void or invalid by a State law, he should be liable to an action upon it in the courts of the United States, with the addi- tion of a penalty for setting up such an unjust and unconstitu- tional defence.32 Justice Bradley then goes on to say that the reason some action of the state is required for there to exist a constitutional violation is that so long as the wrongful act of an individual citizen is not "sanctioned in some way by the State," the rights of the wronged party "remain in full force, and may presumably be vindicated by resort to the laws of the State for redress." 33 Three central ideas emerge from the preceeding review. The first is that action "under color" of state law by definition in- volves state action for Justice Bradley. In his view it was the "color" of law requirement which saved the i866 statute from unconstitutional overreaching into situations in which there was no "state action." Bradley's analysis provides a telling histori- cal argument against Justice Brennan's position that "color of custom" includes purely private action. Second, the contracts clause analogy he uses makes clear that in Justice Bradley's view it is the existence of a state law eliminating state remedies for the redress of certain grievances which furnishes "state action." The logic of this view is that a "custom having the force of law" would provide "state action" when it effectively eliminated such a remedy. No other view is consistent with Bradley's argument and such a custom might certainly be said to carry "the force of law." 34 The third point of importance also requires reference to the contracts clause analogy. The point of analogy Justice Bradley 30Id. at i6. 3 U.S. CONST. art. i, ? 10. 32 IO9 U.S. at 17. 33 Id. 34 See the definitions set out in notes 23 &amp; 24, supra.</page><page sequence="77">78 HARVARD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 84:I sees between the fourteenth amendment and the contracts clause is that in terms, both speak only to the actions of states.35 Yet as the analogy, and indeed the whole opinion make clear, Justice Bradley never thought this meant only state officials could act "under color" of state law; in fact a private party's assertion of a state statute as a defense would be unconstitutional under the contracts clause. This same view clearly emerges from much of the congressional debate of the section.36 The original statute reached "any person" 37 who "shall subject or cause to be sub- jected" any person to the deprivation of a right secured by the Constitution. The most important reason for studying the Civil Rights Cases in the context of section I983 is that the contracts clause analogy produces a coherent content for the phrase "custom having the force of law." The contracts clause, forbidding any state to impair the validity of contracts, presupposes a general common law remedy by which the promisee might sue the promi- sor for nonperformance. For the fourteenth amendment analogy to hold, the amendment must presuppose a common law right of action by the black man for relief against discriminatory private action. So long as this common law remedy exists in practice, there is no need for the federal remedy, and considerations of comity between federal and state governments may suggest that it be withheld. But if by "statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage," this right of action is, in practice, eliminated, then the federal remedy comes into play. Thus, for example, when a general remedy exists, but a minor- ity are denied the benefit of it by the inaction of the police or of the courts in failing uniformly to enforce the law, the equal pro- tection clause and section I983 have been violated. A "custom" has been given the "force of law" by what may be termed "discriminatory inaction," and this inaction constitutes a denial of equal protection. As Professor Black has written, "[i]nac- tion, rather obviously, is the classic and often the most efficient way of 'denying protection.' "Y 38 Indeed, the entire predicate for passage of section I983 was that, by failing to protect Southern 35 The contracts clause provides: "No State shall . . . pass any . . . Law impairing the Obligation of Contracts." The Fourteenth Amendment provides: "No State shall . . . deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal pro- tection of the laws." 36 See, e.g., CONG.

This is perhaps the case in Mississippi with respect to refusals of service.40 In this situation, those seeking a remedy under section I983 must face two distinct problems. First, it can be argued that there has been no state action, merely state inaction. But it must be kept in mind that the fourteenth amend- ment speaks not in terms of "action" but rather "denials" of "protection." Further, as the Civil Rights Cases reveal, the orig- inal rationale of the "color of law" and "state action" doctrines was thought to be comity between state and federal governments in the protection of interests secured by the fourteenth amend- ment. If we assume with Justice Bradley that the policy ex- pressed in the enactment of section I983 is precisely that feder- alism cannot justify the total absence of a remedy to protect those interests, then the absence of a remedy becomes the focal point, and the reason for its absence fades into insignificance. The second problem presented in the "nondiscriminatory in- action" situation is that there is no apparent discrimination against the minority group. Thus it would be argued that Missis- sippi does not discriminate against blacks by failing to provide a remedy for wrongful refusals of service because it does not provide such a remedy for whites either. The difficulty with this reasoning is that whites would have no use for the remedy, or at best very little use. The reason is simple. When associational interests are involved, as they are with respect to attempts to use privately owned facilities open to the public, the gravamen of racial, or any other form of minority discrimination, is that the minority perceives it as an injury. Were a white person denied service on account of race, he would likely regard the situation as something of an amusing curiosity. A black man would almost surely regard the incident in a more serious light. So the answer 39 See, e.g., CONG. GLOBE, 42d Cong., ist Sess., App. 85-86 (I871) (remarks of Rep. Bingham); id. at 501-02 (remarks of Sen. Frelinghuysen); id. at App. ii5-i6 (colloquy between Rep. Shellabarger and Rep. Farnsworth). 40 Dissenting in the court of appeals, Judge Waterman concluded that Miss. Code section 2046.5 altered the Mississippi common law which previously had not permitted an innkeeper, and, by analogy, a restauranteur, to discriminate on the basis of race. Adickes v. S. H. Kress &amp; Co., 409 F.2d 121, 132-33 (2d Cir. i968) (dissenting opinion). Justice Brennan, dissenting, was not so certain the common law obligation of the innkeeper had ever been enforced in Mississippi, however. He concluded, nevertheless, that in enacting section 2046.5, Mississippi had "clarified the state law, and in doing so elected to place the full authority of the State behind private acts of discrimination." 398 U.S. at 202.</page><page sequence="79">8o HARVARD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 84:1 to the "nondiscriminatory inaction" argument is, true, the four- teenth amendment does not reach nondiscriminatory inaction, but the total failure to provide a remedy for the denial of the black man's associational interests is not nondiscriminatory.4' The majority devotes only a footnote to Miss Adickes' "color of statute" claim. This is particularly disturbing because the "state action" arguably evidenced by the statute had the effect of eliminating any remedy which had ever existed for refusals of service. As previously argued, this was precisely the sort of "state action" which most troubled Justice Bradley. In failing to pass on the "color of statute" argument, the Court first noted that the statute does not in terms compel segregation. While such a statute may have invalid application if used to compel segre- gation through criminal prosecution of sit-in demonstrators, said the Court, it had not been so used against Miss Adickes.42 In any event, whatever else the plaintiff must also show to establish action under "color of statute," the majority held, as it had done with respect to "color of custom," that he must show the defend- ant has acted "with knowledge of and pursuant to that sta- tute." "4 Since Miss Adickes had not demonstrated that Kress knew of the statute, she had not yet established a "factual predi- cate for statutory relief," and the Court had no need to reach the merits of the "color of statute" theory. The majority's treatment of this point is open to a major ob- jection. If Miss Adickes failed to demonstrate knowledge of the statute, she also failed to show knowledge that the custom was en- forced by the state. Though a custom of the people might be assumed to be more widely known than a statute, a custom "hav- 4' Whether this form of "discriminatory inaction" makes out a constitutional violation will depend in each case on an assessment of whether the particular interest for the protection of which there is no remedy is secured by the four- teenth amendment. See Bell v. Maryland, 378 U.S. 226, 309-II (i964) (Goldberg, J., concurring). It is, of course, open to argue that the "state action" doctrine has become a manifestation of our desire not to protect associational interests of the minority as against the "purely private" actions of individuals. Recent extensions of the state action doctrine do not support this argument, however, at least not without a substantial redefinition of the term, "purely private actions." See, e.g., Food Employees Local 590 v. Logan Valley Plaza, Inc., 391 U.S. 308 (i968); Evans v. Newton, 382 U.S. 296 (I966); Marsh v. Alabama, 326 U.S. 50I (1946). Indeed, it is precisely the strength of the argument in text that it makes some sense of a "state action" requirement, even if in so doing it redefines the require- ment somewhat. This has been the thrust of most recent literature on the topic. See, e.g., Henkin, Shelley v. Kraemer: Notes for a Revised Opinion, IIO U. PA. L. REV. 473 (I962); VanAlstyn &amp; Karst, State Action, I4 STAN. L. REV. 3 (I96I); Williams, The Twilight of State Action, 4i TEXAS L.

Therefore, if the majority properly reached the "color of custom" claim, it should properly have reached the "statute" claim as well. Adickes leaves unanswered the question whether state action may be found in the statutory elimination of a remedy, thus ren- dering the discrimination encouraged by the absence of the remedy actionable under section I983. However, as argued above, once it has been decided, as a matter of federal constitutional law, that a certain interest is to be protected by the Constitution, the failure of a state ever to have provided a remedy for the vindication of that interest should itself be held to constitute the sort of "state action" required to call into play the federal remedy. A fortiori, repeal of a statutory remedy by a state legislature will provide sufficient discriminatory state action to enable an individual dis- criminated against in such a state to state a claim under the "color of statute" clause of section I983. Unfortunately, its unelaborated holding as to "custom" is not the most troubling aspect of Adickes. Justice Harlan read Peter- son v. Greenville,44 Lombard v. Louisiana 45 and Robinson v. Florida 46 for the proposition that a "State is responsible for the discriminatory acts of a private party when the State, by its law, has compelled the act." 47 He characterizes the question pre- sented in Adickes as whether an individual who discriminates "under the compulsion of state law" 48 violates the fourteenth amendment. But in recent years, the Court has not merely asked whether the statute compelled segregation, but whether it en- couraged it.49 Justice Harlan's reference to compulsion, though perhaps fortuitous, may be an attempt to reestablish a distinc- tion between laws which in terms establish segregation and laws, facially neutral, which are enforced to promote segregation. This distinction has been repeatedly rejected by the Court.50 But potentially far more damaging, particularly in light of the "compulsion" language, are the two disclaimers contained in the final footnote to the majority opinion.51 First, citing Judge Bazelon's dissenting opinion in Williams v. Hot Shoppes, Inc., 52 44373 U.S. 244 (I963). 45373 U.S. 267 (I963). 46378 U.S. I53 (I964). 47 398 U.S. at I70. (Emphasis added). 48 Id (Emphasis added). 49 See, e.g., Robinson v.

The citation to Williams can only be read as a suggestion that a suit for dam- ages may not be a "proper proceeding" under section I983 when the private discriminator is compelled" by state law to discrimi- nate. Importation of this defense into the I983 action would al- most completely exempt private individuals, particularly if the "compulsion" of state law is conceived as a prerequisite to state action. Yet the true irony of the defense is not so much that it might make it impossible to recover damages under section I983 as a matter of law, but that the defense is based on an unconstitu- tional statute or custom, and this is precisely the sort of defense the "color of law" language was intended to eliminate.53 Finally the majority states that it does not decide what, if any defenses might be available to an action under section I983, citing Pierson v. Ray.54 Pierson held, among other things, that a reasonable belief in the constitutionality of a statute under which they make arrests absolves police officers of liability for damages under section I983. If the citation to Pierson is in- tended to suggest a similar defense for private individuals under Section I983, a plaintiff under section I983 may have to face the formidable task of proving that the individual acted with knowl- edge of and pursuant to a statute or custom while having reason to know the statute or custom was unconstitutional. To be sure, the Court has reserved decision on these ques- tions. But lower federal courts will be called upon to decide them, and will no doubt be guided in their decisions by Supreme Court dicta. If these dicta become holdings, it may well be another century before a private individual is called upon to pay for his discrimination in federal court. 2.

In addition, the Court concluded that injured parties could obtain damages as well as injunctive relief,4 and that third parties injured as a result of the discriminatory acts, but not themselves direct victims of dis- crimination, had standing to sue. The petitioner Sullivan owned two houses in a residential com- munity in Fairfax County, Virginia, and two membership shares in Little Hunting Park, Inc., a Virginia nonstock corporation organized to operate a park and swimming pool for residents of the community. Sullivan lived in one house and leased the other to T.R. Freeman,5 co-plaintiff in the suit. Sullivan also assigned one of his membership shares to Freeman, but the board of di- rectors of the association refused to approve the assignment because Freeman was a Negro.

Sullivan v. Little Hunting Park, Inc., 209 Va. 279, i63 S.E.2d 588 (I968). 'A finding that the state court's refusal to hear the case was in some sense discretionary was necessary if the Supreme Court was to grant certiorari. When the lower court's refusal to hear a case is based on jurisdictional grounds, Supreme Court review normally is precluded unless the Court finds that the jurisdictional rule does not provide an adequate state ground for refusing to hear the case. See e.g., Hammerstein v. Superior Ct., 34I U.S. 49I, 492 (i95i); Ward v. Board of County Comm'rs, 253 U.S. I7, 22-23 (I920). The Virginia court plainly saw its refusal as jurisdictional. As Justice Harlan pointed out in dissent, for the Court to call it discretionary could mean that any time a state court exercised judgment on whether a case complied with its procedural rules, the Supreme Court could hold that decision to be discretionary and not a bar to review. This would be a radical expansion of the Court's certiorari power. Justice Harlan suggested that the Court could simply have held that the stand- ard of reasonableness used by the Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals was incon- sistent with its own precedents and therefore inadequate as a bar to certiorari review. See NAACP v. Alabama, 357 U.S. 449, 457-58 (1958). Had the Court rested jurisdiction on such a finding, it would better have preserved the finality of state court judgments, while simultaneously requiring those courts to apply their procedural rules in a consistent, even-handed manner. '0 In Jones, the Court said: At the very least, the freedom that Congress is empowered to secure under the Thirteenth Amendment includes the freedom to buy whatever a white man can buy, the right to live wherever a white man can live. If Congress cannot say that being a free man means at least this much, then the Thir- teenth Amendment made a promise the Nation cannot keep. Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co., 392 U.S. 409, 443 (i968). 11 Since the Civil Rights Cases, I09 U.S. 3, 20 (i883), Congress' power to pass legislation eliminating all "badges and incidents" of slavery has gone unques- tioned. Jones, however, was the first case to consider private discrimination a badge or incident of slavery. 12 See, e.g., Kinoy, The Constitutional Right of Negro Freedom Revisited: Some First Thoughts on Jones v.

Together Jones and Sullivan have created a "common law of forbidden racial discriminations" 13 under section I982, but have left the boundaries of the section unclear. The majority, in expanding section I982 to include member- ship shares in community recreation facilities which accompany property being transferred, reasoned that the membership share was property,'4 that as such it was integral to the lease,'5 and that the board, as a third party, had no right to interfere with this lease in any way on racial grounds.'6 The Court could easily have rested its decision on the first two points alone.'7 The majority chose to go further, however, and to hold that any interference by a third party with a Negro's right to lease gave rise to a cause of action under section i982 .' Such interference would seem to be closer to conduct proscribed in section I98I, which prohibits any interference with a Negro's right to make contracts, than to the prohibitions of section I982. The majority, however, was apparently unwilling to base its hold- ing on section i98I, perhaps fearing that to do so would open the courts to antidiscrimination suits whenever there was a con- tractual relationship involved.'

Yet even if the shares were not property, Freeman and Sullivan would have had a cause of action because their transaction was clearly a contract, protected from interference by section I98I.

For example, a third-party in- terference with racially mixed marriages could fall within the prohibitions of the statute. The Court's reluctance to employ section I98I is perhaps explained by a desire to avoid such a sudden expansion of the law.</page><page sequence="85">86 HARVARD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 84: I defendants in section I982 suits, especially since the Court also held that plaintiffs could seek damages as well as injunctive re- lief.20 Thus, for instance, a Negro seeking to buy a house could now sue a bank or finance company under section I982 for re- fusing to issue him a mortgage on account of his race,2' arguing that his inability to secure a mortgage interfered with his right to purchase or lease property. Similarly, since section I982 ex- pressly covers personal as well as real property,22 a Negro who felt he had been denied credit by a store or finance agency be- cause of his color could sue on the ground of interference with his right to buy personal property, such as furniture or appli- ances.23 Sullivan, then, potentially broadens section I982 from a vehicle simply for defeating racially restricted housing covenants to a weapon against discrimination in most commercial dealings. The ramifications of the Court's decision that Sullivan, a white man not himself the victim of discrimination, had standing to sue under section i982 are uncertain. Sullivan was an aggrieved party - he had been expelled from the association - and was connected to Freeman in a lessor-lessee relationship. But the Court did not indicate whether both factors were necessary for standing. At one point the majority said that Sullivan's ex- pulsion constituted an intolerable punishment for "trying to vin- dicate the rights of minorities protected by ? i982,,' 24 opening the possibility that any outsider injured while supporting a Negro's attempt to purchase property could sue under that statute.25 At the same time, however, the majority relied on the narrower precedent of Barrows v. Jackson,26 which treated even an appeal by a third-party vendor as an exception to the normal rules of standing.27 Use of this precedent in Sullivan suggests 20396 U.S. at 238-40. 21 Such discrimination is also forbidden under the Fair Housing Act of I968, 42 U.S.C. ? 3605 (Supp. IV, I969). The importance of inclusion here is the more open-ended nature of the relief under section I982. 22 See note 2 supra. 23 More speculative, perhaps, but still within the potential ambit of section I982 as defined in Sullivan, would be an action against a private social club on the ground that a significant amount of trade in securities or real estate (both prop- erty under section I982) was dependent on club contracts and use. 24396 U.S. at 237. 25 Of course, under article III of the Constitution any plaintiff would have to show sufficient injury to claim an adversary role. Any other member of Little Hunting Park who supported Sullivan and Freeman and who was subsequently ejected from the association could fulfill the constitutional requirement, however. Yet it is unlikely that section I982 was meant to offer such a person a federal right of action. 26346 U.S. 249 (I953). 27 Id. at 257.

McGrath, 34I U.S. I23 (I95I),</page><page sequence="86">1970] THE SUPREME COURT, I969 TERM 87 that the third party must at least have a direct role in the con- veyance or acquisition of the property at issue before he can sue under section I982. Moreover, the facts of Barrows suggest that it was not just that Mrs. Jackson was a vendor which allowed her to challenge the covenant, but also that she was the only person in the trans- action with a motive and an opportunity to raise the issue in court. Mrs. Jackson was a defendant being sued for her failure to abide by a restrictive covenant. Denying her the right to de- fend her suit on the ground that the covenant was discriminatory would have resulted in both pecuniary loss to her and perpetua- tion of the restrictive covenant. In addition, the Barrows Court noted that "it would be difficult if not impossible for the [Negro] persons whose rights are asserted to present their grievance be- fore any court." 28 In Sullivan, on the other hand, the immediate victim of the discrimination, Freeman, was quite able to assert his own rights; indeed, he was a party before the Court. Future reliance on either the holding or facts of Barrows in interpreting Sullivan could therefore mean a more restrictive rule of standing than the Sullivan Court's language or its cita- tion of Barrows might suggest: A likely compromise, one that would allow those naturally involved to protect their interests without multiplying lawsuits, would be to extend section I982 protection to all those having a legal interest in the transaction (e.g., lessors or vendors) who had been injured as a result of the discriminatory actions.29 This would extend Barrows to allow a willing lessor like Sullivan to sue even if the Negro lessee had a separate cause of action, but would not force the discriminating defendants to face a welter of suits.30 saying: "Ordinarily, one may not claim standing in this Court to vindicate the constitutional rights of some third party." 346 U.S. at 255.

He said that Sullivan's claims against the board could be based on several factors: the board's interference with his statutory duty to Freeman under section I982; the board's action vis-ta- vis Freeman; or injuries resulting from Sullivan's protest against the board's action. He said further that even if the board's conduct were clearly violative of section I982, Sullivan's remedies were not clear. Sullivan sought both reinstatement in the association and monetary damages, but none of the possible violations mentioned above would necessarily require that he be reinstated in the association. While the majority was silent as to Sullivan's rights and remedies, one pos- sible response to Justice Harlan's criticisms would be that section I98 2 implicitly</page><page sequence="87">88 HARVARD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 84: I The Court's decision in Sullivan to allow damages as well as injunctive relief was necessary if section I982 was to become a viable means of combatting discrimination. Too often, as in this case, a plea for injunction alone becomes moot because the ag- grieved party has to move before the injunction can be granted. A prayer for damages, however, survives the move, thus en- couraging suits to break up racial discrimination. Relying on Bell v. Hood 31 and Texas &amp; N.O.R.R. v. Brotherhood of Ry. &amp; S.S. Clerks,32 the majority said that here "[t]he existence of a statutory right implies the existence of all necessary and appropriate remedies." 33 The implication of rem- edies is not novel,34 and is often necessary since a right without appropriate remedies would be meaningless. But such an open- ended implication of remedies can lead to widely varying and inconsistent application among the states.35 To avoid the prob- grants Sullivan a right, independent of Freeman's, to be free from third party interference with the lease transaction. Since Freeman clearly has a right under section I982 both to lease property and to be free from third party interference, the statute implicitly requires that Sullivan as the lessor, the other necessary party, also be protected from a willful interference with his right to lease to Freeman. This would suggest that Sullivan's relief extends at least to any loss he took as a result of the delay caused by the board's refusal to approve Freeman. In addition he should be able to obtain damages for expulsion from, and a mandated re- admission to, the association upon a showing that his ejection resulted primarily as a result of his attempt to exercise his right to lease his home to a Negro. The question of reinstatement then becomes merely a question of who has the burden of proof as to why Sullivan was ejected. 31327 U.S. 678 (1946). In Bell, the Court stated: And it is also well settled that where legal rights have been invaded, and a federal statute provides for a general right to sue for such invasion, federal courts may use any available remedy to make good the wrong done.

REV. 289 (I969). 35 For example, the question of whether exemplary damages are available for violations of section I982 was not answered by the Court and was presumably left to the states. The Fair Housing Act of I968, 42 U.S.C. ? 36I2(C) (Supp. IV, I969), on the other hand, is quite specific about punitive damages, permitting a successful plaintiff to recover up to $i,ooo. The Court recognized the need to find some standard for awarding damages once it had declared their availability. It purported to find such a standard under 42 U.S.C. ? I988 (I964): The jurisdiction in civil . . . matters conferred on the district courts by the provisions of this chapter and Title i8, for the protection of all per- sons in the United States in their civil rights, and for their vindication, shall be exercised and enforced in conformity with the laws of the United States, so far as such laws are suitable to carry the same into effect; but in all cases where they are not adapted to the object, or are deficient in the pro- visions necessary to furnish suitable remedies and punish offenses against law, the common law, as modified and changed by the constitution and</page><page sequence="88">1970] THE SUPREME COURT, I969 TERM 89 lem of geographical inequities in the enforcement of federal law, the Court will have to define more clearly the standards for awarding damages. The very specific remedies provided under the Fair Housing Act of I968 offer one guide which the Court could follow.36 These provisions could be implemented by the Court through its supervisory power over the federal courts.37 Most state courts would probably follow to avoid divergent rem- edies in a single jurisdiction. Alternatively, the Court could simply treat the remedy as a federal question on the ground that it was appurtenant to a federal right.38 Under the supremacy clause, its choice of remedies would then be binding on all courts.3 Mr. Justice Harlan dissented in both Jones and Sullivan, feel- ing it inappropriate to revive a ioo-year-old statute when current congressional intent concerning housing discrimination was clearly articulated in the Fair Housing Act of I968. He also maintained that the Court had misread the intention of the i866 Congress in drafting section I982, and that the open-ended nature of that provision would cause continuing difficulties for the Court.40 But Justice Harlan failed to sway his brethren, and both the I968 Act and section I982 remain viable. The question for the future, then, is how they will coexist. Certainly the reach and remedies of the tw) statutes are dif- ferent. Section I982 is broad and open-ended. It covers housing transactions, such as sales of single family dwellings without a realtor, currently exempted from the I968 Act.4' Moreover, it statutes of the State wherein the court having jurisdiction of such civil or criminal cause is held, so far as the same is not inconsistent with the Con- stitution and laws of the United States, shall be extended to and govern the said courts in the trial and disposition of the cause .... The provision, however, in no sense provides a "standard" for state courts in fashioning remedies; rather, it merely directs federal courts to use either federal or state remedies if the statute is silent as to remedies.

On the other hand, remedies are much more precisely specified under the I968 Act, which provides in detail for administrative action by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), " private suits in the courts,45 and public court actions brought by the Attorney Gen- eral.46 Prospective plaintiffs will have to balance administrative convenience and clarity under the new act against the broader scope of section I982, a choice which will undoubtedly be in- fluenced by the guidelines for damages and third party standing developed in the wake of Sullivan. If damage awards are gen- erous or if third party standing requirements are interpreted liberally, section I982 could become the more potent and popular means of fighting housing discrimination, despite the machinery so carefully prescribed under the I968 Act. The two statutes need not operate competitively, however. On the contrary, the complementary use of section I982 could actually strengthen the I968 Act. Anyone trying to use the HUD administrative remedies provided under the I968 Act must wait before commencing a law suit under that act's provisions.47 But nothing would appear to bar those seeking administrative relief from also filing a section I982 suit for damages at once.48 De- fendants fearing large damage claims under the open-ended relief provisions of section I982, especially in cases in which there are third-party plaintiffs,49 will then have a real incentive to comply with the HUD mediator in return for a voluntary dismissal of the section I982 actions. Consequently, rather than weakening the I968 Act, section I982 as developed by Sullivan may actually reinforce it. C. Due Process i. Maintenance of Courtroom Decorum. -Last Term, in Illinois v.

Allen, accused of robbing $200 at gunpoint, came to trial in I957. Initially allowed to conduct his own defense,2 he soon "started to argue with the judge in a most abusive and disrespectful manner."' The judge warned Allen that persis- tence would result in removal from the courtroom. Finally the judge requested Allen's appointed counsel to proceed; but Allen continued to talk boisterously, threatened the judge that "you're going to be a corpse here," 4 tore his attorney's file and threw the papers to the floor. After a second warning went unheeded,5 the judge ordered removal for the duration of the prosecution's case.6 When the defense began, Allen was readmitted on the con- dition of proper behavior and remained present for the rest of the trial. The jury found him guilty as charged. Following an unsuccessful appeal,7 Allen sought federal habeas corpus, alleging the violation of his constitutional right to be present at trial. The district court dismissed the petition as "patently frivolous," 8 but the Seventh Circuit reversed.9 On certiorari, Mr. Justice Black, writing for a virtually unanimous Court,10 approved the original denial of habeas and ruled that 2 Among those whom Allen requested for counsel were Adlai Stevenson and Erle Stanley Gardner.

" As framed by the trial judge's action, the issue before the Court was whether any level of deliberately disruptive conduct in the courtroom can effect a "waiver" 12 of the right to be present at trial. This right is of ancient lineage, having evolved in Anglo- Saxon law simultaneously with the right to trial itself.13 It is embodied in the sixth amendment, which, despite its narrow word- ing of confronting witnesses,'4 is widely thought to express the broader common law right to be present at every stage of trial.15 The federal courts have consistently upheld this "leading principle that pervades the entire law of criminal procedure" against in- voluntary deprivation.'6 Despite some early dicta that the right to be present could not even be voluntarily and expressly waived by a defendant,'7 the Court later adopted the more sensible view 18 11 397 U.S. at 347. 12 See note 26 infra. 13 Goldin, Presence of the Defendant at Rendition of Verdict in Felony Cases, i6 COLUM. L. REV. i8, I8-20 (I9I6). The right also has ancient roots and wide present-day acceptance in the civil law countries. See Murray, The Power to Expel a Criminal Defendant from His Own Trial: A Comparative View, 36 U. COLO. L. REV. I7I (I964). 14 "&lt;In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right . . . to be con- fronted with the witnesses against him . . .." This clause has been made applic- able to the states through the fourteenth amendment. Pointer v. Texas, 380 U.S. 400, 403 (I965). 15See 397 U.S. at 338; Diaz v.

However, the sixth amend- ment right of confrontation and the common law right of presence at trial have not always received identical judicial treatment. E.g., Snyder v.

Davis 23 did a federal court rule on the issue of forced absence. Because of defendant's loud interrup- tions, the district court approved his removal for part of the prosecution's case. However, the brief opinion cited neither case nor constitution in concluding: "The right of a prisoner to be present at his trial does not include the right to prevent a trial by unseemly disturbance." 24 19 See Snyder v.

However, Diaz, 223 U.S. at 455, and Rule 43 draw a distinction in capital cases, where attendance is said to be mandatory; and Lewis and Hopt, cited in note I7 supra as the source of the contrary dicta, were both capital cases. This distinction is tenuous at best, seemingly based on exacting special precaution in favorem vitae. State v. Kelly, 97 N.C. 404, 406, 2 S.E., i85, i86 (1887); Goldin, supra note I3, at 27-28. Many state courts reject the distinction. E.g., Davidson v. State, io8 Ark. I9I, 202, I58 S.W. II03, II07 (9I3); People v. De Simone, 9 Ill. 2d 522, 522-33, I38 N.E.2d 556, 562 (1956) (dictum). Diaz also suggested that waiver was not possible where defendant was in custody, since the choice of attending was not his. This distinction has been virtually unechoed elsewhere. 20 United States v.

Allen, the Court showed an unrelenting concern for ensuring that modicum of decorum suf- ficient to maintain the integrity of the trial process - even at the expense of abandoning some constitutional right. Such a concern is certainly understandable; any other constitutional construc- tion would by definition be functionally self-defeating. But, unfortunately, the Court failed to spell out what degrees of dis- order and disrespect - elements of indecorum that the Court refused to treat separately despite their differing effects - should be deemed destructive of the criminal process. While such a de- termination must ultimately be made by the trial judge, there is no reason that his discretion must be uninstructed.25 Another equally broad, but less necessary, grant of discretion by the Court involved the choice of means for controlling the defendant. It is by no means obvious which constitutional right is to be considered "waived" by misconduct.20 For example, a judge could remedy disorder by declaring a forfeiture of the right to a speedy trial,27 then imprisoning the defendant until he promises to behave.28 Or the sixth amendment rights of public No case prior to the Seventh Circuit's decision in Allen held that an unruly defendant could not be expelled. Moreover, there exists an impressive array of American and English commentators on criminal procedure who recognize this doctrine of "waiver by misconduct" with regard to the right to be present. Their works are compiled in Brief for Petitioner at i5 &amp; nn.22 &amp; 23. Lastly, the Supreme Court itself had previously indicated acceptance of this doctrine by citing Davis with evident approval, Diaz v.

Massachusetts, 29I U.S. 97, io6 (i934) ("No doubt the privilege may be lost by consent or at times even by mis- conduct."). 25 For example, the Court could have cautioned against treating a defendant's occasional insults or disrespect in the same fashion as a planned attempt at ob- struction like Allen's. 26 All of the Allen courts insisted on a conclusory formulation of the problem in terms of waiver. "By such conduct, he waived any constitutional rights to be present . . ." 37 Ill. 2d at I72, 226 N.E.2d at 3. "The relator's conduct ... constituted a waiver of relator's right to be present." Appendix 57 (district court's order). The disruption "does not amount to a waiver." 413 F.2d at 235. "Allen lost his right . . . to be present throughout his trial." 397 U.S. at 346. The use of waiver terminology here tends to obscure the issue. American jurisprudence ordinarily conceives of waiver as "an intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right or privilege."

Another right that could be eliminated is the due process right to appear free of shackles,29 particularly since there exists considerable authority for overriding the right where restraint is necessary for a safe and orderly proceeding 30 and since the right is not specifically mentioned in the Constitution. And there is little reason to stop theorizing here; more draconian measures would absolutely guarantee decorum. Disorder could be inter- preted as waiver of trial itself or even of the prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment; 31 sending only one defendant to the rack would provide excellent deterrence for many others. Forced in Allen to infringe some constitutional protection in order to maintain decorum, the state courts and the federal dis- trict court blithely selected for sacrifice the right to be present. On review, the Seventh Circuit held the right to be present an "abso- lute" 32 which was to be maintained even at the price of binding and gagging or issuing contempt citations. These lower courts re- fused explicitly to weigh the relative costs of the various possible methods of preserving decorum. Going one step further, the Supreme Court refused to choose any particular right for sacrifice. After approving removal of the defendant, the opinion proceeded -in an almost conspiratorial tone -to suggest to trial judges a sm6rgasbord of other means of control, including contempt and shackling. This dual grant of unfettered discretion, allowing trial judges both to define indecorum and to choose methods of combatting it, is inappropriate in this situation. First, although trial judges faced by unruly defendants assuredly should not be handcuffed by the Constitution, neither should the Court blind itself to the danger that the integrity and dignity of the judicial process can be degraded from the bench as well as from the defendant's box.33 Judge Murtagh in the Black Panthers' pre-trial hearing.

Id.</page><page sequence="95">96 HARVARD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 84:I For its permissive tone the Court should have substituted a note of restraint, not only of defendants but of judges too. Second, while Mr. Justice Black was properly concerned with balancing -even in the face of express constitutional wording -the state interest in a trial free of disorderly interruption and spectacle against the constitutional privileges of the defendant, he forgot- perhaps because of lack of practice 3 - the obvious principle that constitutional rights should be balanced away only to the degree necessary. If there is a less restrictive means for satisfying the state interest in controlling the defendant, then this course should be required.35 In lieu of the carte blanche it gave the lower courts, the Supreme Court should have established a hierarchy of remedies, graduated in severity, to guide judges' choice of means for con- trolling courtroom disruption. Moreover, assuming the trial judge had selected the least restrictive means for insuring decorum, the Court should have imposed on him the further duty to mitigate the effects of any lost rights.36 A conceivable hierarchy of means, to be followed except upon a showing of special circumstances, would begin with a stern warning to defendant out of the presence of the jury. The court might resort next to guards and minor restraints such as hand- cuffs in order to enhance the credibility of the threat of more serious action; their effectiveness would increase once Allen and similar cases make it widely understood that more serious rem- edies are indeed available to trial judges. If minor restraints are ineffective, the trial court should con- sider recessing the trial until the imprisoned defendant agrees to behave reasonably.37 This approach preserves an apparent legiti- "Cf. Black, The Bill of Rights, 35 N.Y.U.L. REV. 865 (i960). 35 See Note, Less Drastic Means and the First Amendment, 78 YALE L.J. 464, 464 &amp; n.4 (I969). 36 For example, removal of a defendant might be mitigated by allowing fre- quent communication between defendant and his counsel or by providing defendant with a daily transcript. Conceivably, the Court could also demand modern means of mitigation such as a closed circuit television broadcast to a separate chamber and telephone communication between defendant and counsel. See Nizer, supra note 28, at I26. Or a court could use an Eichmann booth, see TIME, Mar. 9, I970, at 3I, col. 2, possibly with a one-way mirror to allow defendant to view the proceedings without permitting him to cause visual disruption. Although the Court should carefully weigh the costs to society against the anticipated bene- fits before ordering the use of these devices, the Allen Court showed an unfor- tunate blindness in refusing even to consider them. But cf. 397 U.S. at 351I (Brennan, J., concurring). 37 See note 28 supra. If the defendant was free on bail, the court could invoke its civil contempt powers to imprison the defendant during the indefinite recess.</page><page sequence="96">I970] THE SUPREME COURT, I969 TERM 97 macy by conforming to society's conception of a fair trial in defendant's presence and by avoiding prejudice to him in the ultimate determination of guilt; in the meantime, the de- fendant "has the key to his cell." 38 Yet, recess of trial has signif- icant disadvantages. The trial court would have to guard against the defendant's use of recess for tactical purposes. The defen- dant might, for example, wish to wait for witnesses to become unavailable 39 or wish to take advantage of a suspected reluctance of the authorities to renew prosecution. Also, recess would neces- sitate empanelling a new jury and beginning the trial afresh. The trial court would have to counter the danger of an expensive series of recesses by refusing to recess more than once; if the defendant reneges on his promise to behave once the trial is resumed, the court should move on to more severe means of control. Similarly, the trial court should not allow a disruption late in trial to nullify the work of months. These disadvantages, singly or in combi- nation, may prove overwhelming in particular circumstances; ad- mittedly, trial judges must have the discretion to weigh these disadvantages. If recess fails or is found impractical in the circumstances, the court could resort to the harsher remedy of removing the defendant from the courtroom. Even then removal should come only after special warning,40 and readmission should be permitted at any time the defendant agrees to behave.4' In condoning trial in absentia, the Court implied that there are no longer any substantial, direct societal interests un- derlying the defendant's ancient right to be present. When the right arose in Anglo-Saxon times, it is true that presence was a requirement, not a privilege.42 Jurisdiction was as dependent on presence in criminal trials as in civil,43 for originally both were 38If an objection to the denial of some right underlies the defendant's dis- ruption, he might seek vindication by immediate review. If the judge has merely recessed the trial, the defendant would presumably utilize habeas corpus to challenge the legality of his confinement. If civil contempt were invoked, defendant would probably have the right to direct appeal. See In re Merchants' Stock &amp; Grain Co., 223 U.S. 639 (I9I2). Nevertheless, there is serious doubt whether on either type of review the appellate court would reach the disruptor's underlying objection or should in any other way encourage this disruptively-induced short cut to collateral attack. Cf. Walker v. City of Birmingham, 388 U.S. 307 (I967). 39See 397 U.S. at 345. 40 An effective form of warning, that could be given in addition to verbal fore- warning, would be to recess briefly after ordering removal, at least for the re- mainder of that day; this would allow a defendant to consider the reality of his removal and possibly to repent before anything has transpired in his absence. 41 See 397 U.S. at 343. 42See generally Goldin, supra note I3. 4 This jurisdictional logic persists in some states. See, e.g., Noell v. Common- wealth, I35 Va. 6oo, 609, II5 S.E. 679, 68i, 30 A.L.R.

Also, the early mode of trial, by ordeal or by battle, and the general practice of rendering judgment immediately upon return of verdict, both argued for presence. Lastly, since defendants could not have counsel in ancient times,44 maintenance of any pretense to an adversary system necessitated presence. But the evolution of criminal pro- cedure has undermined these justifications and the privilege of presence is now retained primarily for defendant's benefit and for the indirect societal interest in providing for his protection. Presence allows the defendant to help conduct the defense and confront witnesses, possibly exerting a moral force to inhibit them from lying. The defendant also has the advantage of pre- senting himself, and his demeanor, to the jury; he can even personally poll the jury at verdict time.45 His presence enables him to make sure that his lawyer presents a vigorous defense and to gather personal knowledge for a later appeal. While any one of these benefits may be insubstantial for a particular defen- dant, their availability promotes the legitimacy of the trial proc- ess and contributes to the acceptability of imposing criminal sanctions. Frequent resort to trial in absentia, with its totalitar- ian imagery, undercuts not only the defendant's interests, but also this state interest in preserving the moral force of the criminal law. These interests are real enough that a court should ordinarily be more willing to recess than to remove. It does not follow, how- ever, that these sometimes ephemeral interests 46 justify any means of controlling the defendant which permits his presence at trial. The use of both shackling and criminal contempt was explicitly condoned by the Court, yet these methods are more restrictive than removal and no more effective in achieving an immediate end to the disruption. Shackling has only its adherence to the abstract principle of defendant's presence to commend it, while in practice it works to the detriment of both defendant and society. Only a slavish reading of the sixth amendment would command maintenance of the right of confrontation for the benefit of a man who can neither move nor speak during the "confrontation." And besides proving to be an occasionally ineffective control of disorder,47 binding and gagging 44 See 3 W. BLACKSTONE, COMMENTARIES *25, 45See Goldin, supra note I3, at 22-23. 46 In particular, society's indirect interest in legitimacy becomes substantial only where there is frequent resort to removal. The deterrent effect of this remedy's availability argues that its invocation need not become the norm. 4 Notably, "Bobby Seale still managed to squeal and squirm enough to disrupt the Chicago proceedings" even though bound and gagged.

Criminal contempt offers apparent advantages as a means for handling an unruly defendant, and in fact the Allen Court seem- ingly suggests it as a possible first step toward control.5' How- ever, its use would usually be ineffective and always be dangerous. Contempt will not effectively deter the defendant who faces the likelihood of severe punishment for the substantive criminal offense, or who is motivated by deeply-held political or philosoph- ical views to mock a judicial system which he distrusts. Similarly, a defendant may seek nothing but notoriety or martyrdom, or may be convinced that the judge is "railroading" him, and thus will not be influenced by the threat of contempt. Furthermore, while Mr. Justice Black treats the use of crim- inal contempt rather lightly,52 upon analysis this means appears just as unnecessarily exorbitant as the similar suggestion made above 53 that misconduct could be viewed as waiver of the right to trial. Contempt permits lengthy incarceration of the defendant without the most elemental due process rights, including indict- ment, hearing, proof, and trial by jury, substituting for these the 3I, COl.

Finally, criminal contempt - unlike recess or removal - rises above a primarily corrective measure used to remedy disorder and becomes a power to punish, whose use might turn not only on de- fendant's courtroom behavior but also on his motives for disrup- tion.55 Contempt should, therefore, have been stricken from the list of permissible methods of maintaining courtroom decorum. 2.

REV. 283 (I962). " Mr. Justice Douglas in a separate opinion dwelt on the question of de- fendant's motivation. 397 U.S. at 35I. He first focused on the indications that Allen was mentally unstable. Since this issue was not raised in the federal courts, the record was unclear, and Justice Douglas argued that the difficult question of "how to proceed . . . against . . . a mental case . . . should be resolved only on a full and adequate record," and that therefore the Court should use its "in- formed discretion" to reverse for staleness of record. Id. at 352. But the latter part of his opinion abundantly demonstrates that his real concern here is that Allen decides in advance any political trial cases, in which, he believes, defend- ants' "purer" motives might cause the balance of interests to be weighted dif- ferently. Justice Douglas would have preferred to wait until such a case came to the Court before deciding the decorum issue. However, the Court quite properly seized on Allen for speaking out as soon as possible, considering that several courts were currently faced with widely-publi- cized decorum problems. TIME, Feb. 23, 1970, at 39, col. I; id., Mar. 9, 1970, at 3I, col. I; id., Apr. I3, I970, at 5I, col. i. Even if Justice Douglas is right that political cases present unique issues, then Allen -where the motives were unclear but certainly not political -would not necessarily dictate the result nor bar the Court's review. Moreover, the majority may well have been convinced that the Allen case provided as good a vehicle as any for deciding the constitutional issue. As long as the trial court does not seek to punish disruption, it is good policy for a court to treat in the same fashion all disruptors, whether prompted by anger, eccentric- ity, trial tactics or political persuasion. Besides the dangers of allowing a judge to adjust the rigor of corrective rules according to his view of the defendant's politics, any such system in practice would simply be too unworkable and un- certain. In short, the moral issue of the righteousness of defendant's motives is severable from the legal issue of the propriety of a court's non-punitive efforts to maintain order. Thus, the fault of the Court is not in answering but rather, as has been argued, in its answer. ' Dandridge v.

Justice Black also charged that the logic of the Court's opinion could not be contained: the hardship to a hypothetical recipient unjustly deprived of benefits will always outweigh the government's interest in conserving fiscal resources.

Although it has often been stated that due process re- quires a hearing before the government acts,23 there are numer- ous cases allowing the government to act before a hearing where strong governmental interests - for example, protection of gov- ernment revenues 24 or the public health, safety, or welfare 25 - might be endangered by delay. In Kelly the Court concluded that the consequences to the recipient of a wrongful termination of his welfare payments outweighed the governmental interest in conserving fiscal resources through summary action. While the cost to the individual affected by administrative error is certainly great, the weakness of the Court's opinion is its failure to con- sider adequately the costs that pretermination hearings may impose upon state agencies. The Court simply remarks that efficient procedures and "skillful use of personnel and facilities" will "minimize the increased cost." 26 Nevertheless, as long as welfare budgets remain relatively fixed,27 decisions increasing 21 See Morris, Welfare Benefits as Property: Requiring a Prior Hearing, 20 AD.

Although the present "fair hearing" procedures have been used infrequently by re- cipients,30 more may take advantage of the pretermination pro- cedures, since they can thereby postpone the termination of their benefits. Despite the costs of providing pretermination hearings, it is clear that the present procedures are ill-suited to the protection of recipients' interests. Welfare recipients are often ignorant of their rights to a "fair hearing." 31 In addition, post-termination hearings are often not held until several months after the can- cellation of benefits. During this period the former recipient may have been evicted or forced to leave the state, or he may have been unwilling or otherwise unable 32 to pursue this rela- 28Justice Black argues that if he is correct in asserting that the logic of the Court's decision will lead to even greater procedural protection, then the recipients may be able to delay termination for "years." He suggests that the consequence of this will be to make states much more careful, and accordingly much slower, in adding new applicants to the welfare roles. Thus, he charges that the poor will not benefit from the Court's decision. 397 U.S. at 279. 29See Kelly v. Wyman, 294 F.

Appendix at 30ga, Goldberg v. Kelly, 397 U.S. 254 (I970). The increase has been due in part to a campaign by welfare-action groups to encourage the use of "fair hearings" to promote clients' rights. See Handler, Justice for the Recipient: Fair Hearings in AFDC-the Wisconsin Experience, 43 Soc. SERVICES REV. I2, 33-34 (I969). The New York statistics are not exceptional: a Wisconsin study over the ten year period from I955-65 noted that only .4% of the terminations were appealed. Id. at 20. 31 See Handler, supra note 3o, at 27. Even if a recipient is aware of his rights, the relationship of complete dependency of the recipient still receiving some benefits on the agency or caseworker will make a recipient very reluctant to challenge agency decisions for fear of displeasing his caseworker. It is only in extreme cases, such as severe reductions or complete terminations, that the recipient may decide to act. See Handler, Controlling Official Behavior in Welfare Administration, 54 CALIF.

By contrast, a pretermination hearing will provide recipients with a relatively easy method of challenging agency action. Furthermore, there are indications that agency termina- tions are erroneous in a significant number of cases.33 Both HEW and the New York State Department of Social Services appear to have determined prior to the Kelly decision that the increased costs of a pretermination hearing were man- ageable, or at least outweighed by the gain in fairness to the recipients. HEW had announced regulations that required aid to be continued pending a "fair hearing" where there was an issue of fact or of judgment related to the individual case.34 New York had allowed local welfare officials to adopt a procedure providing a pretermination hearing.35 While the Court held that the state must afford a hearing before it can reverse its decision to pay welfare benefits, it in- dicated that the hearing need not provide all the attributes of a judicial trial. Since a full "fair hearing" would be held later if requested,36 the Court did not require a complete record or a com- prehensive opinion at the pretermination stage. But it agreed with the district court that the recipient must be given an oppor- tunity to be heard orally, and, at least where a factual dispute exists, he must be given an opportunity to confront and cross- examine witnesses.37 The recipient also must be given adequate 33 Once recipients reach the "fair hearing" stage they win a large percentage of the cases. See Bell &amp; Norvell, Texas Welfare Appeals: The Hidden Right, 46 TEXAS L. REV. 223, 224 n.I3 (i967); Brief for Appellee at 38, Goldberg v. Kelly, 397 U.S. 254 (ig7o). This might merely indicate that only clear cases of depart- ment error reach the hearing stage, but an HEW quality control review based on an examination of the written case records only indicated that terminations were erroneous in over 6% of AFDC cases across the country. See Brief for Ap- pellee at 38, Goldberg v. Kelly, 397 U.S. 254 (3970). 3434 Fed. Reg. II44 (i969). This same limitation on continued aid is present in the new proposed regulations. See note 36 infra. 35 i8 N.Y.C.R.R. ? 35I.26(a) (i968); see note 9 supra. 36 The Court noted that due process does not require two hearings, and that a state might simply wish to continue benefits until after a "fair hearing." 397 U.S. at 267 n.I4. In an effort to implement the Kelly decision HEW has proposed regulations which would do away with the duplication of hearings by requiring the continuation of assistance until a "fair hearing" where the decision to terminate or reduce assistance involved an issue of fact or of judgment relating to the individual case. 35 Fed. Reg. 8448 (ig7o). 3 The Court noted that the present New York procedure did not give the recipient an adequate opportunity to defend his eligibility.

Even the California procedure, which allows the recipient an informal con-</page><page sequence="106">I9701 THE SUPREME COURT, 1969 TERM I07 notice of his right to a hearing, and the hearing must be held before an impartial decisionmaker.8 The decisionmaker must base his conclusion solely on the law and the evidence adduced at the hearing, and must state the reasons for his determination, indicating the evidence he relied on. Kelly left open the question whether counsel must be pro- vided at state expense.39 The Court did decide that the recipient must be allowed to retain counsel, but Justice Black charged that this right is "meaningless" for people too poor to hire their own advocates.40 In the case of challenges to regulations and pro- cedures, legal service organizations may provide representation, but the recipient's need for counsel is not limited to legal ques- tions. Even with regard to factual matters, a certain sophistica- tion is needed to know what facts to gather in defense and to know how to present these facts persuasively.4' The Court spe- ference with his caseworker, falls short of due process standards. Though the recipient is afforded the flexibility of an oral presentation, the caseworker will usually have investigated the eligibility of the recipient himself; the recipient is thus deprived of a chance to challenge the caseworker's judgment. Quoting ex- tensively from Greene v. McElroy, 360 U.S. 474, 496-97 (i959), the Court also emphasized the requirement that an individual be given a chance to confront and cross-examine witnesses, whose memories may be "faulty" or who may be "moti- vated by malice." 397 U.S. at 269-70. " The Court held that prior involvement with some aspects of the case would not necessarily bar a welfare official from acting as a decisionmaker as long as he had not participated in the decision under review. 397 U.S. at 27I. " Although the due process clause has been held to require counsel in juvenile proceedings, see In re Gault, 387 U.S. I (i967), courts have refused to supply counsel in other cases where important interests are at stake, such as deportation, see Ah Chiu Pang v. Immigration &amp; Naturalization Service, 368 F.2d 637 (3d Cir. i966), cert. denied, 386 U.S. I037 (i967), and revocation of parole, see Hyser v. Reed, 3i8 F.2d 225 (D.C. Cir.), cert. denied, 375 U.S. 957 (i963). Actually at one point HEW adopted regulations requiring that states provide lawyers for claimants at "fair hearings." This was to be done through legal serv- ices, private attorneys, or supervised law students. 34 Fed. Reg. II44 (I969). These regulations were to go into effect October i, I969, but there was strong op- position from the states. See H. HERSHFANG, LEGAL SERVICES AND THE POOR IN MASSACHUSETTS: A REPORT ON THE WELFARE COUNSEL PROJECT 50-57 (1970). HEW decided to delay the effective date of these regulations until July i, 1970. 34 Fed. Reg. x13595 (I969). The proposals were finally revoked and HEW an- nounced that new regulations to implement Kelly were being formulated. 35 Fed. Reg. I0591 (1970). Significantly, the new proposed regulations do not require states to provide counsel at "fair hearings." 35 Fed. Reg. 8448 (ig70). If a state wishes to provide claimants with counsel HEW will share such costs. See 35 Fed. Reg. 8450 (1970). 40397 U.S. at 278-79. Though not able to hire counsel, a recipient might wish to bring a friend or an interpreter who might be somewhat helpful in presenting the recipient's case. 41See In re Gault, 387 U.S. I, 36 (i967).</page><page sequence="107">io8 HARVARD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 84:I cifically noted the lack of education of most recipients.42 Thus it may be that providing counsel is the only method of guaran- teeing a meaningful hearing. On the other hand the provision of counsel would place a tremendous financial burden on the agencies, for welfare recipients are barely at a subsistence level of income and would almost always require provision of counsel.43 There would also be increased costs if, as seems likely, the pres- ence of counsel protracted the pretermination hearings. In short, it seems unlikely that the Court will take this step unless con- vinced that the hearing system it has required is producing a substantial number of erroneous outcomes, and that the provision of counsel would measurably reduce this number.44 D. Evidence Right of Confrontation: Substantive Use at Trial of Prior Statements. - In I967, John Green was tried and convicted of furnishing marijuana to a minor, Melvin Porter, in violation of California law. At Green's trial Porter had been called to testify concerning his alleged receipt of marijuana from the de- fendant. Porter, however, claimed that he was unable to recall the facts of his acquisition of the marijuana, because he was under the influence of LSD at that time. The prosecution was allowed to introduce for substantive purposes testimony, incriminating the defendant as Porter's supplier, which Porter had given at a pre- liminary hearing.' The trial judge later admitted a similar state- 42 397 U.S. at 269. The lower court cited a study showing that barely half of the welfare mothers in New York City had attended high school and one out of six mothers had not gone beyond the fourth grade. See 294 F. Supp. at 904 n.30. 43 Besides providing recipients with counsel the agency will probably need to increase its own legal staff to make sure that agency decisions are adequately defended. And if both sides are represented by counsel, perhaps the hearing exam- iners should also be lawyers. See generally Hunt, Social Welfare Hearings "Re- visited," I968 AD. LAW BULL. 3 (Sept.-Oct. I968). 4'There are indications that lawyers function poorly in the administration of juvenile justice. See Platt &amp; Friedman, The Limits of Advocacy: Occupational Hazards in Juvenile Court, ii6 U. PA. L. REV. II56, II84 (I968). Also there is some statistical evidence that the presence of counsel does not increase the success rate in welfare "fair hearings."

Although Porter asserted at trial that these earlier statements represented the truth as he believed it at the time they were made, "he insisted that he was also telling the truth now in claiming inability to remember the actual events." 2 The California Supreme Court reversed Green's conviction,3 concluding that the substantive use of Porter's prior statements violated the sixth amendment confrontation clause 4 as applied to the states through the fourteenth amendment.5 The court interpreted the Constitution as requiring adherence to the ortho- dox hearsay rule which bars substantive use at trial of prior statements of available witnesses.6 2 California v.

In Johnson, the prosecution had introduced incriminating statements made at a grand jury proceeding by a witness who later at trial told a different story of the events. The California Supreme Court reversed the conviction, feeling impelled to conclude from decisions of the United States Supreme Court that a conviction based upon the prior declarations of a witness violated the right of confrontation. The court said that only timely cross-examination could satisfy that right. See note 6 infra. In Green, the California Supreme Court vacated the appellate court's decision and issued its own reversal of the conviction, perhaps feeling that a simple reliance on Johnson was insufficient to deal with the issues raised by the admission of prior preliminary hearing testimony that had been subjected to cross-examination when made. 4 "In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right . to be confronted with the witnesses against him . . .."

The extrajudicial declaration is not thought to be suffi- ciently reliable evidence for several reasons: the declaration was probably not made under oath and therefore not subject to prosecution for perjury; the de- clarant's demeanor could not be observed by the trial factfinder; and, most im- portantly, there was no opportunity for cross-examination. Consequently, it is feared that the declarant will be more willing to tell a falsehood or will make a mistake, and that an untruth will more likely be perpetuated in the absence of an opportunity for the adversary to challenge the perception, memory, and veracity of the declarant.

The orthodox hearsay rule generally prohibits the substantive use of a witness' prior statements which were not subject to cross-examination when made and were not essentially adopted by the witness at trial so that they could be said to constitute his testimony there. Only contemporaneous cross-examination is thought to provide the defendant with an effective opportunity to test the truthful- ness of the evidence. See Bridges v.

Green ' last Term ended speculation over the constitutional status of the traditional hearsay rule of evi- dence.8 The Court, speaking through Mr. Justice White, held that Porter's preliminary hearing testimony was admissible at trial consistent with the requirement of the sixth amendment, since the testimony had been subjected to cross-examination at the hearing. Moreover, the Court said that the use of Porter's prior statement to the police did not offend the confrontation clause if there was an opportunity for effective cross-examination of Porter at trial.9 The Supreme Court, however, remanded the case for further proceedings in the California courts to determine whether Green had been able to cross-examine Porter adequately at trial, and if not, whether Green's case had been prejudiced by the admission of Porter's prior statement to the police.10 The common law hearsay rule is generally recognized as an effort to assure the reliability of evidence introduced at trial.

The Chief Justice stressed the importance of leaving to the states the opportunity to "experiment and innovate, especially in the area of criminal justice." 399 U.S. at 171. Mr. Justice Harlan argued that recent de- cisions had misconceived the scope of the confrontation clause in equating "con- frontation" with "cross-examination"; the sixth amendment simply requires the prosecution "to produce any available witness whose declarations it seeks to use in a criminal trial." 399 U.S. at 174; see note I4 infra. Mr. justice Brennan, the lone dissenter, argued that Porter's claimed inability to remember the actual events made effective cross-examination at trial impossible. See pp. II5-I6 infra. In addition, he argued that preliminary hearing testimony should not be admitted at trial, since cross-examination could not be expected to satisfy the defendant's rights unless the character of the preliminary hearings were drastically altered to transform the hearings into trial-like proceedings. See pp. II4-I5 infra. "?The California Supreme Court had not focused on the adequacy of Green's cross-examination of Porter at trial, since that issue was irrelevant in light of its determination that any out-of-court statement is inadmissible for substantive pur- poses. And the Supreme Court could not simply reverse the California Supreme Court and affirm the conviction on the basis of the acceptable preliminary hearing testimony, since any error in the admission of Porter's statement to the police would raise an issue of whether the error was constitutionally harmless.

I434 (i966). 14 See cases cited in note I5 infra. Mr. Justice Harlan, concurring in the Court's result in Green, rejected the notion that the right of confrontation guarantees an opportunity for cross-examination. Instead, he would limit the confrontation clause to a requirement that, when pos- sible, the prosecution produce at trial any declarants of prior statements which it seeks to use against the defendant. See note 9 supra. He did acknowledge, how- ever, that the language of the confrontation clause could support a broad spectrum of interpretations, which includes the Court's as well as his own. 399 U.S. at I75. See also 5 WIGMORE ? I365, at 27; id. ? I397, at I27-30. In arriving at his inter- pretation of the confrontation clause, Mr. Justice Harlan focused upon a number of the Court's early sixth amendment decisions which were concerned simply with the presentation of available witnesses at trial and the use of ex parte testimony. 399 U.S. at I79-83. Yet, these cases are inconclusive as to the issue of a constitu- tional guarantee of the right of cross-examination, since that question did not arise in any of them. Seeking support for his view in the history of the drafting of the amendment, he relied upon a brief portion of early congressional debate over the compulsory process clause of the sixth amendment. Id. at I77. But the relevance of this colloquy to the confrontation clause is most questionable, since it is focused on an entirely different sixth amendment right. Indeed, the technique of attrib- uting importance to the comments of individual legislators is normally neither helpful nor appropriate in determining the meaning of a statute or the Constitu- tion. See H.M. HART &amp; A. SACKS, THE LEGAL PROCESS I267 (tent. ed. I958). While one may agree with Mr. Justice Harlan that the history of the con- frontation clause itself is ambiguous, see Note, Confrontation, Cross-examination and the Right to Prepare a Defense, 56 GEO.

REV. 74I, 742-44 (I965), it is nevertheless in- structive to consider the context in which the clause was adopted. By the time of the Bill of Rights, the reliability of statements that could not be tested by cross- examination had been impugned, and common-law courts were generally refusing to admit such statements. See The King v. Paine, 5 Mod. i63, i65 (I696); Mc- CORMICK at 483; 9 W. HOLDSWORTH, A HISTORY OF ENGLISH LAW 2 I5-I9 (3d ed. I944); 5 WIGMORE ? I364, at i8; Morgan, supra note I, at i8i-83.

[his prior] statement." 15 Thus, the confrontation clause, like the hearsay rule, is concerned with the reliability of evidence intro- duced at trial; both seek to ensure that the defendant can probe effectively at some point the evidence against him. But, as the Court recognized in Green, it does not follow that the confronta- tion clause is equivalent to the hearsay rule with its myriad of exceptions.'6 First, the confrontation clause protects other interests 17 be- sides the defendant's right to test the evidence against him. Furthermore, in terms of evidentiary reliability the confrontation clause merely establishes a constitutional minimum as to the character of the criminal process; the constitutional requirement focuses solely upon the right of the accused to confront and probe ity.

EVID. CODE ? I235 (West I966); cf. UNIFORM RULE OF EVIDENCE 63(I); MCCORMICK at 73-82; 3 WIGMORE ? ioi8, at 687-88, it may still go further and proscribe the substantive use of any prior statements on the ground that they are hearsay, see, e.g., Bridges v. Wixon, 326 U.S. I35, I53-54 (i945); Young v. United States, 214 F.2d 232, 239 (D.C. Cir. I954); State v. Saporen, 205 Minn. 358, 36I-63, 285 N.W. 898, 900-OI I939). 20 The Court's earlier decisions which had focused on cross-examination were compatible with the orthodox hearsay rule, although they had often emphasized cross-examination as a necessary incident to providing the accused with a fair opportunity to defend himself at trial, see, e.g., Pointer v. Texas, 380 U.S. 400, 405 (i965): [T]here are few subjects, perhaps, upon which this Court has been more nearly unanimous than in their expressions of belief that the right of con- frontation and cross-examination is an essential and fundamental require- ment for the kind of fair trial which is this country's constitutional goal .... See also In re Oliver, 333 U.S. 257, 273 (1948). 21 399 U.S. at I56. 22 Id. at I58. The standard of cross-examination required under the confronta- tion clause by the Green Court ultimately seeks to assure the reliability at trial of statements previously made by witnesses. Since that reliability depends on the perception, memory, and veracity of a witness whose credibility may be wholly unknown, effective cross-examination of the witness assures that the evidence may be sufficiently probed. Exceptions to the hearsay rule, however, have been adopted where the reliability of the evidence depends on external factors which may be independently challenged. For example, the learned treatise exception allows the introduction of evidence from an authoritative work in a field of scholarship be- cause the eminence accorded it by experts is thought to assure reliability. See UNI- FORM RULE OF EViDENCE 63(31); MCCORMICK at 620-2I. Still, the veracity and accuracy of such evidence may be challenged by presenting experts who disagree with tne alleged authoritativeness. Similarly, under the business records exception,</page><page sequence="113">II4 HARVARD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 84:I Yet, in terms of securing effective cross-examination for a defendant, the Court's use of Porter's preliminary hearing testi- mony, because it had been subject to cross-examination there, is troubling. For although preliminary hearings in California are adversary in nature, they exist solely to determine probable cause. They are intended to be threshold proceedings to avoid wasting judicial resources when there is clearly no case for trial.23 Gen- erally, there is little motivation for comprehensive cross-examina- tion at a preliminary hearing; to the contrary, unless there are no grounds at all for prosecution, the defense would probably pre- fer not to show its entire case at the hearing but rather to save it for trial. Consequently, Green may not have attacked Porter's testi- mony at the preliminary hearing as thoroughly as he might have if he had known that the opportunity for cross-examination there would ultimately be deemed sufficient to satisfy his right of con- frontation.24 But whatever the injustice to Green, future defend- ants will certainly learn from his experience. Thus, the Court's holding will not vitiate future defendants' opportunity to probe a witness' perception and memory and to test the veracity of his statements. Instead, pretrial proceedings may evolve into quasi- trials, with delays for preparation, lengthy cross-examination to avoid being saddled with prior testimony that cannot be effec- tively attacked later, and considerable expenditure of the parties' time and resources -all to be followed by a full trial.25 There certain records may be admitted when production of the maker of the records would cause undue inconvenience, because the standards by which such records are normally kept are presumed to assure reliability. Here too, the standards, such as regularity, promptness, and direct derivation from firsthand knowledge, which are considered to assure the reliability of the evidence, can be independently chal- lenged by a defendant without cross-examining the actual maker of the records. See UNIFORM RULE OF EVIDENcE 63(I3); MCCORMICK at 596-608. Thus, there seems to be adequate opportunity for a defendant to exercise the right embodied in the sixth amendment to probe the evidence against him in these exceptions to the hearsay rule. Ultimately, it may be necessary to scrutinize each exception to determine whether it is consistent with the right of confrontation. 23See People v. Green, 70 Cal. 2d 654, 663, 451 P.2d 422, 428, 75 Cal. Rptr. 782, 788 (i969); cf. Barber v. Page, 390 U.S. 7I9, 725 (i968). 24 Cf. Note, Confrontation, Cross-examination and the Right to Prepare a Defense, 56 GEO. L.J. 939, 948-49 (i968). 25 Nor does it appear that states which seek to use preliminary hearing testi- mony at trial will be allowed to preserve by force of law or judicial practice a cursory pretrial process. While the Court did not investigate whether Green had actually exercised at the preliminary hearing his opportunity to cross-examine to the limits necessary to challenge fully the case against him, it did make a more funda- mental determination that the circumstances of the hearing "closely approximat[ed] those that surround the typical trial." 399 U.S. at I65. Thus, the Court will ensure that a defendant has an adequate opportunity to attack through cross-examination</page><page sequence="114">I970] THE SUPREME COURT, I969 TERM II5 may also be a significant drain on the scarce judicial resources which preliminary hearings were designed to save. At the same time, the Court's holding denies the factfinder the opportunity to observe the demeanor of the preliminary hearing witness testifying at trial. Thus, the Court has apparently adopted the view of many commentators that the factfinder's observation of the witness' confrontation with the defendant is not constitutionally required.26 Although demeanor may be an important consideration in enabling the trier of fact to reach a correct judgment as to the value of a particular piece of evidence, cross-examination outside the view of the factfinder does not in- terfere with the defendant's opportunity to search out the truth from his accuser -the right protected by the sixth amend- ment.27 In focusing upon the admissibility of Porter's preliminary hearing testimony, the Green Court left unanswered the question whether the cross-examination of Porter at trial was adequate in light of Porter's asserted inability to remember. Nevertheless, in dictum the Court indicated that a prosecution witness whose prior declarations are introduced when he recants on the stand is subject to effective cross-examination when he tells a different story of the facts at trial. In that situation, Mr. Justice White said, the defense can probe the witness as to the conflicting stories, and the resulting attempt of the witness to explain will enable the factfinder to determine the truth. Labeling the search for an "explanation" as cross-examination, however, seems something of a misnomer. The once hostile witness for the prosecution has become in effect a defense witness; regardless of how the cross- examiner probes the witness, he finds himself in the difficult, if the evidence against him; it is up to the defendant, however, to avail himself of that opportunity. Moreover, in scrutinizing the adequacy of the pre-trial proceed- ing provided by the state, the Court leaves the state maximum flexibility in dealing with evidentiary matters, but still protects individual interests. If a state provides a full-scale proceeding that assures adequate confrontation, then arguably any testimony given at the hearing would be admissible at a later trial. If, however, a state forgoes such a process, the defendant's rights will not be sacrificed because of the state's unilateral decision. Unless a preliminary hearing affords the defendant essentially the same adversary right to confront a witness as he would have at trial, the Court will bar the use of preliminary hearing testimony. See Pointer v. Texas, 380 U.S. 400, 407 (I965) (right of confrontation denied defendant when prior statement introduced which was not subject to complete opportunity to cross-examine at "full-fledged hearing"); cf. Barber v. Page, 390 U.S. 7I9, 725 (i968) ("right to confrontation is basically a trial right"). 26See Virgin Islands v.

The Court unfortunately did not fully evaluate what for constitutional purposes would constitute an adequate explanation by a witness of his prior statement. In Green, for instance, Porter would only say that he did not remember the actual situation and that the LSD he had taken prevented his separating fact from fantasy. He could not shed light on the facts behind the conflicting stories, but could only relate why he in fact did not know the truth. Green was thus in little better position than a defendant faced with a witness who refuses to testify 29 or to take the stand.30 As Mr. Justice Brennan argued in dissent, even for constitutional purposes Porter's unassailable stance does not seem to offer an adequate opportunity for effective cross-examination. At some point, the defendant must be able to test the accuracy and veracity of a witness in order to satisfy the adversary right of confrontation. This requirement would seem to necessitate that at the least a declarant now testifying at trial either acknowledge the truth of the prior statements and discuss their substance or, in a case of renunciation, be able to discuss presently the substantive issues with which the conflicting state- ments deal.31 Finally, the Court's dual holding in Green raises the spectre of convictions based solely on prior incriminating statements which were not subject to timely cross-examination at trial.32 The Court noted that the "issue of the sufficiency of the evidence" in Green was not insubstantial, since the conviction "rests almost entirely on the evidence in Porter's two prior statements which were themselves inconsistent." 33 Moreover, neither of these prior statements had been attacked during a full trial at the time they were made. There is, then, a larger question concerning the re- liability of the trial court decision, rather than merely that of certain evidence, for the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment may require a minimal standard of evidentiary sup- 28 Cf. 5 WIGMORE ? 1368, at 34-35. 29 Douglas v.

United States Post Office Depart- ment 2 upheld the constitutionality of Title III of the Postal Revenue and Federal Salary Act of I967.3 The Act permits a person who receives in the mail a "pandering advertisement which offers for sale matter which the addressee in his sole discretion believes to be erotically arousing or sexually provocative" 4 to "[W]e may agree that considerations of due process, wholly apart from the Confrontation Clause, might prevent convictions where a reliable evidentiary basis is totally lacking ...." 399 U.S. at i63-64 n.I5; see Thompson v.

See Bridges v. Wixon, 326 U.S. I35, I53-54 (0945) (dictum). And due process is an available tool with which to prevent serious abuses of fair- ness resulting from the admission of unreliable evidence. See Note, Confrontation and the Hearsay Rule, 75 YALE L.J.

In pre- Constitution days, before the presence of any problems regarding hearsay and constitutionalization, the doctrine developed at common law that a hearsay state- ment could only be used as corroboratory or confirmatory of other evidence; "a hearsay statement, by itself . .

The order directs the sender to cease further mailings to the complaining addressee.5 Several mail-order houses and mailing-list brokers, alleging that the statute violated their first amendment rights to com- municate through the mail, sought a declaratory judgment that the statute was unconstitutional. In deciding to the contrary, the Supreme Court, speaking through Mr. Chief Justice Burger, ruled that a prohibitory order issued under Title III bars not merely future mailings similar to the material which motivated the com- plaint, but all future mailings to the complainant by anyone sub- ject to the order. The Court determined that the householder's privacy interest in being free of objectionable mail outweighed plaintiffs' interest in unlimited communication through the mail. The Court held that the addressee was to make the decision, unreviewable by a court, as to whether an advertisement was pandering or the material offered arousing; the provision of a full hearing in the district court on the issues of whether the first mailing was an advertisement within the meaning of Title III and whether the mailer violated the order satisfied the require- ments of due process.6 'Id. ? 4009(b). The order further directs the sender to delete the addressee's name from all his mailing lists and refrain from trading in lists which contain the addressee's name. Id. ? 4009(c). If the mailer violates the order, the Postmaster may, after a hearing on whether a violation has occurred (if such a hearing is re- quested by the mailer), request the Attorney General to seek an order in a federal district court directing compliance with the prohibitory order. Id. ? 4009(d). Upon issuance of the order after a district court hearing, the mailer risks contempt if he further violates it. Id. ? 4009(e).

It was this last provision, not directly involved in the case at bar, that sparked a concurring opinion by justices Brennan and Douglas. See note I5 infra. 6 The Court found no merit in plaintiffs' further allegations that the statute violated the fifth amendment due process clause on grounds of unlawful dele- gation, vagueness, and confiscation of property. While the delegation to private persons of policy making power over others may in some cases offend due pro- cess, see Carter v. Carter Coal Co., 298 U.S. 238, 31I (I936), the problem does not arise in Rowan, since the addressee's delegated power only extends to making "(policy" for himself. Moreover, vagueness is not a vice of this statute; the mailer is under no burden of choosing the correct statutory interpretation at his peril in the first mailing which may or may not be termed "pandering" by an addressee. After an order issues, the mailer's duty is specifically defined in terms of an impermissible audience, a concept which gives more warning and deters less expression than definitions which go to the substance of the expression. See Ginsberg v. New York, 390 U.S. 629, 643-44 (I968). Finally, the Court held that the financial burdens imposed on the mailer by the operation of Title III were not sufficient to be unconstitutionally confiscatory in violation of the fifth amendment. The mailing lists do not become valueless, since mailers can still trade in them provided the complainants' names are deleted.

Georgia,7 in which the Court -focus- ing on a man's liberty to read and think what he pleases in the privacy of his home 8I held that the first amendment prohibited criminal punishment for mere private possession of obscene ma- terials.9 In Rowan, Mr. Chief Justice Burger extracted the con- verse proposition from the Constitution: Congress may protect people from being forced to confront undesired reading material in their home.'0 Under the Court's reading of Title III, the ad- dressee's power to refuse mail is not limited to those categories in which the Court previously has recognized a legitimate state in- terest in obscenity control; 11 the addressee may also exclude material which is clearly protected 12 by the first amendment from state interference.'3 Thus, Rowan is more than simply a con- sistent extension of earlier doctrinal development in obscen- may actually aid some mailers by removing the names of those most reluctant to purchase, thereby improving the mailer's ratio of sales to selling costs.

New York, 390 U.S. 629 (i968), and material which exploits sexual desires for commercial purposes, see Ginzburg v. United States, 383 U.S. 463 (i966). 12 Indeed, the statute has previously been used to obtain prohibitory orders covering a variety of innocuous items.

The main elements of the test for material which is "obscene," and thus unprotected, are whether the dominant theme of the ma- terial taken as a whole appeals to a prurient interest in sex, is patently offensive in affronting community standards relating to portrayal of sexual matters, and is utterly without redeeming social value.

The Constitution has never been thought to impose on private citizens a duty to listen to speech.'4 Consequently, barring com- munication with the unwilling addressee does not appear to be a significant burden upon any established right of the mailer to convey his message. Despite the householder's power to fore- close communication with other members of his family by striking his name from a mailing list, interference with free communica- tion remains an insubstantial matter.'5 It is well-established constitutional doctrine that parents have broad discretion and responsibility in the raising of their children, particularly with respect to matters wholly within the confines of the home." While children are not outside the purview of the first amend- ment,'7 legislative effort to aid parental control in this narrow context does not interfere unreasonably with their right of free speech.'8 Thus, as to the sphere within the addressee's legitimate control, the mailer's first amendment interests seem so insub- stantial as to offer no justification for overriding the addressee's interest in protecting his privacy from this unwanted intrusion. Nevertheless, in some contexts, satisfying the desire of par- ticular individuals to cut off unwanted communication will inter- fere with other persons' consensual speech relationships, thus 14 397 U.S. at 737: "Nothing in the Constitution compels us to listen to or view any unwanted communication, whatever its merit ...." 15 The statute gives the householder power to have not only his own name but also the names of his children removed from the lists of any mailer of what he deems to be offensive material. 39 U.S.C. ? 4009(g)(Supp. IV, i969): Upon request of any addressee the order shall include the names of any of his minor children who have not attained their nineteenth birthday, and who reside with the addressee.

While the Justice expresses an important con- cern for youth's interest in receiving expressive material, his view totally ignores the recognized right of the parent to direct the rearing of his child.

In contrast, absolute or community-wide prohibitions on speech have been struck down under the first amendment,22 since these blanket restraints focus totally upon the maintenance of social order to the exclusion of free speech interests. But when the control of the unwanted intrusion has been placed in the hands of each individual, rather than the commun- ity, the Court has not found a violation of the first amendment.23 Unlike community-wide prohibitions, individual control has lit- tle, if any, effect on other consensual speech relationships. Rowan seems consistent with this view, since it is apparently premised upon the difference between the mail and all other mass media for communication.24 19 See, e.g., Cantwell v. Connecticut, 3I0 U.S. 296 (1940). 20 See, e.g., Kovacs v. Cooper, 336 U.S. 77 (1949) (sound trucks can be reg- ulated within reasonable limits); Saia v. New York, 334 U.S. 558 (1948) (public sound systems cannot be absolutely prohibited). See also Public Utilities Comm'n v. Pollak, 343 U.S. 45I (I952). 21 See, e.g., Kovacs v. Cooper, 336 U.S. 77 (I949). 22 See, e.g., Saia v. New York, 334 U.S. 558 (1948). 23 In Martin v. City of Struthers, 3I9 U.S. I4I (I943), the Court invalidated an ordinance prohibiting all door-to-door solicitation, on two grounds: first, many willing recipients would be deprived of their first amendment "right to receive" literature of all types; and second, the ordinance was too great a restraint on the freedom to disseminate information. The problems caused by such solicitation, the Court felt, could best be handled by allowing individual homeowners to erect their own prohibitions by means of signs aimed at keeping solicitors away. The thrust of Martin was blunted, however, in Breard v. Alexandria, 34I U.S. 622 (I95I), in which the Court upheld against a first amendment challenge an ordinance prohibiting door-to-door commercial solicitation without the prior consent of the homeowner, "[a]s the exigencies of trade are not ordinarily ex- pected to have a higher rating constitutionally than the tranquillity of the fireside," id. at 627. One rationale for the holding was, however, that "the usual methods of solicitation-radio, periodicals, mail, local agencies -are open." Id. at 63I-32 (emphasis added). There are two kinds of schemes for individual control over intrusions. One, exemplified in Breard, is a statute that presumptively bars the speech until the recipient allows it. The second, seen in Rowan, places the burden of halting the expression on the individual who chooses not to hear.

Other media -for instance, the sound truck,25 the billboard, the television,26 or the radio program piped into a public place 27 rely on a single mes- sage wave which is aimed at large numbers of eyes and ears. State regulation of these media would cut off communication to the willing, as well as the unwilling, recipient. But suppression of one particular copy of a message conveyed by the mails has no direct effect on transmittal of the message to any willing re- cipient.28 And at the same time, the mailer has no substantial first amendment interest which would warrant forcing a message on the unwilling addressee.29 Thus, the state's delegation of power to the private citizen in Rowan is similar to the recognized power of the state to broadly authorize individual citizens to prohibit physical intrusion upon their property by door-to-door solicitors.30 Both reflect the Court's notion of "the right of every person 'to be let alone.' " 31 It might be argued, however, that the burden of disposing of unwanted mail is too trivial to warrant disregarding the mailer's interest in communication, no matter how insubstantial.32 Yet, for some persons the unwanted mail may have a subtle and power- ful effect. Discarding unopened a piece of mail which, although unwanted, practically begs the recipient to peer inside for titilla- tion may impose significant psychological burdens on some in- dividuals.

And even if it is arguably not the responsibility of the state to assume an in loco parentis role on behalf of such perplexed adults, there remains nonetheless the established state interest in the well-being of youth who may be sexually curious but emotionally immature.35 Thus, at a minimum, Title III can be justified as an appropriate governmental effort to support a parent's decision that his children not have ready access to certain materials. Although the predominance of the privacy interest over the free speech interest in Rowan justifies the conclusion that Title III's basic purpose - to permit an addressee to bar undesired mailings - is constitutionally permissible, additional constitu- tional questions arise from the Court's construction of the statute. Superficially troubling is the Court's willingness to leave the determination of whether a particular advertisement is "pander- ing" 36 in the hands of the addressee despite a recent series of first amendment cases which have demanded that courts make determinations of whether material is protected exy)ression.37 While the ambiguous statutory language leaves unanswered the question of who shall decide if the advertisement is a pandering one,38 the Court's view is nevertheless persuasive when it is rec- 33See A Book Named "John Cleland's Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure" v.

In cases in which only un- willing recipients are involved, the issue of whether the speech is protected should be irrelevant,39 and the presumption of judicial review defeated.40 Once the conclusion is reached that in the narrow context of the mails the privacy of the addressee warrants greater consideration than the mailer's interest in communication to an unwilling recipient, a requirement of a judicial determina- tion of the pandering issue would merely embroil courts in the treacherous business of trying to formulate objective standards for a thoroughly subjective decision.41 The Court was willing to read Title III as requiring an evi- dentiary hearing only on two questions: first, was the material mailed an "advertisement;" and second, has the mailer violated the Post Office order? 42 On its face, there is a curious incon- sistency between the Court's devotion to the householder's seem- ingly absolute power to determine what materials are so offensive that he wishes to keep them from his mailbox, and this judicially construed qualification of that power under the statute. But in requiring objective determination of the commercial nature of the mailing, the Court apparently attempted to achieve the fullest 39 But see Rowan v. United States Post Office Dep't, 3oo F.

Cal. i969), (Hufstedler, J., concurring), rev'd, 397 U.S. 728 (1970). 40 For a recent and powerful statement of the principle of the presumption of judicial review, see Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 136 (i967). In the Rowan context, the presumption is defeated by 39 U.S.C. ? 4009(h) (Supp. IV, i969), which provides that the judicial review provisions of the Administra- tive Procedure Act shall not be applicable to the statute; by legislative history, see 113 CONG. REC. 28660 (I967) (remarks of Congressman Waldie, who proposed the language that became ? 4009(a)); and by the realization that the central func- tion of judicial review -insuring that power is exercised only in accordance with law -is inapplicable to a statute which allows each addressee to make his own "law." 41 The Court's attempts thus far to create an adequate definition have not been particularly persuasive. See note 36 supra. Creation of an objective standard for pandering may be an onerous task indeed, particularly since the addressee's discretion as to whether the matter offered for sale is erotic seems clearly unre- viewable. What if the householder is aroused by an advertisement for a new automobile which contains a picture of the car being driven by a voluptuous female model? Does that advertisement "pander" to his erotic desire for a power- ful vehicle? Surely a great deal of advertising is permeated by "the leer of the sensualist," see Ginzburg v. United States, 383 U.S. 463, 468 (i966), presenting a wide range of stimuli for an infinite variety of psyches. Thus, the Court's holding in Rowan seems the only way out of a dilemma the subjectivities of any doc- trine of pandering would best be handled by avoidance. Cf.

The issue of whether a particular mailing constitutes an advertisement is much more suitable for objective resolution than that of pandering. In addition, requiring a hearing on the adver- tisement issue avoids making initial dissemination of noncom- mercial social, political, or religious literature subject to the act.44 Nevertheless, the thrust of the Court's holding seems to leave it open to Congress to amend Title III to give addressees the power to exclude any and all mailings, regardless of their subject matter or social value.45 Notable as well was the breadth of the Court's interpretation of what materials are prohibited from being mailed to a com- plaining addressee once an order issues. This question was ob- scured by inconsistent wording within the statute itself. Section 4009 (a) 46 proscribes the further mailings of "such materials," referring to the material about which the addressee has com- plained. But section 4009(b) 47 directs the Postmaster to issue an order containing a blanket prohibition on "further mailings to the named addressees." In Rowan, the district court, looking to section 4009(a), had ruled that the materials prohibited in the future were "to be measured by the objectionable material [of the mailing that motivated the complaint]; "1 48 overruling the lower court, Chief Justice Burger concluded that all further mail- ings are prohibited. As a practical matter, the "first mailing" standard suggested 43See, e.g., H.R. REP. No. 722, goth Cong., ist Sess. (I967).

Beyond the initial burden of making a complaint, it requires the addressee to weigh the later mailing against the first and decide if it is close enough to warrant a further complaint. If he so finds, he must explain to the postal official or the court precisely what it was about the first mailing that he found objectionable. This latter requirement would dilute substantially the sole discretion allegedly committed to the addressee; indeed, it would necessitate censorial evaluation by postal officials, thus defeating one of Congress' primary purposes in creating this scheme.49 The "first mailing" test would also create a large administrative burden of holding hearings each time the mailer contested the application of the test to a later mailing. On the other hand, the Supreme Court's decision that all future mailings are prohibited 5 raises the spectre of an uncon- stitutionally overbroad scheme.5' While clearly the congressional target of this statute was intrusive smut, the Court's construc- tion will burden speech well outside that legislatively perceived "evil." Yet even the district court's "first mailing" test fails to cure this overbreadth, if a court upholds the addressee's sole discretion concerning what mailings are objectionable. An over- breadth analysis would thus have forced the Court either to in- validate what is actually a narrowly drawn scheme for obscenity control or to mangle legislative intent on the issues of judicial review and the scope of the prohibitory order. But the Court sidestepped the horns of this dilemma. The Court's fundamental solicitude in the context of Rowan for individual privacy indi- cates that the overbreadth doctrine, like other doctrines that serve to limit community power to interfere with individual speakers and potentially receptive listeners, is irrelevant when "See 397 U.S. at 733. Such evaluations of mail by postal officials have been held in the past to violate the first amendment. See, e.g., Lamont v. Postmaster General, 38i U.S. 301 (I965). 50 In most circumstances government may not restrain publication prior to distribution; absent a showing of irreparable harm, the Court has generally in- sisted upon criminal sanctions invoked after the expressive behavior, rather than prior suppression of speech that may turn out to be constitutionally protected. See Donaldson v. Read Magazine, 333 U.S. 178, i82 (1948); Near v. Minnesota, 283 U.S. 697 (i93i); Summerfield v. Sunshine Book Co., 22i F.2d 42 (D.C. Cir.

The Rowan scheme is not an impermissible prior restraint since the individual's decision does not prevent transmittal of the message to anyone else. 51 See generally Note, The First Amendment Overbreadth Doctrine, 83 HARV.

Tax Commission ' the Court upheld a New York statute grant- ing property tax exemption to real property owned by religious organizations and used solely for religious worship. At stake in Walz were exemptions for such property dating to colonial times and existing, with various modifications, in every state and the District of Columbia.2 Walz, as an owner of real property, sought to enjoin the New York City Tax Commission from granting the statutory property tax exemption to religious property. Statutory and constitutional provisions granted exemption to property owned by religious, educational or charitable organizations and used exclusively for such purposes.3 The Tax Commission was granted summary judg- ment and the New York Court of Appeals affirmed.4 On appeal of the order granting summary judgment, held, 7-I, the tax exemption provisions of the New York statute and constitution do not violate the establishment clause as applied to the states by the fourteenth amendment. The court reasoned that the "pur- pose of the property tax exemption is neither the advancement nor the inhibition of religion." 5 Church property is exempted from taxation only as part of a general scheme of exemptions granted to nonprofit organizations which the state finds to be "beneficial and stabilizing influences in community life." 6 More- over, exemption is granted because the taxation of church prop- erty would result in increased involvement of government with religion. As the purpose of the tax exemption is neutral, the effect also avoids "excessive government entanglement with religion." 7 Concurring opinions were written by Justices Bren- nan and Harlan; Justice Douglas dissented. The majority opinion marks a significant departure from previous establishment clause decisions which allowed religious organizations to receive government aid only as an incident of aid given to a program with secular objectives.

He finds no reasoned basis on which a court could deter- mine that exempting churches from property taxation allows them to escape their "fair share" of the burdens of government.9 Chief Justice Burger, however, accepted the proposition that a grant of tax exemptions to churches is a grant of "an indirect economic benefit." 10 He was thus forced to abandon the "no-aid" dogma of earlier decisions " for a more flexible prohibition against state "sponsorship" of religion.'2 The "no-aid" formula was first stated by the Court in Everson v. Board of Education: 13 The establishment of religion clause of the First Amendment means at least this: Neither a state nor the Federal Government . . . .can pass laws which aid one religion, aid all religions, or prefer one religion over another. Purporting to apply the "no-aid" formula, the Court in Everson and in Board of Education v. Allen 14 approved state programs which benefited religion by explaining the religious benefit as incidental to a secular state objective. Bussing parochial school students with state funds could be conceptualized in Everson as primarily a program for insuring the safe transportation of stu- dents attending all schools, public and private; state aid for purchasing school books could be viewed in Allen as primarily a program for raising educational standards in all private schools. In Walz the benefit received by churches is a tax exemption for religious property used solely for religious purposes; any secular purpose which may exist is qualitatively different from the secular purpose in Everson and Allen. The Chief Justice nevertheless attributes a secular purpose to the New York statute; it exempts church property as part of exemptions granted to a "broad class of property" owned by 8 See Bittker, Churches, Taxes and the Constitution, 78 YALE L.J.

'" The school districts in Abington School District v. Schempp "' advanced a similar argument. They alleged that their prayer exercises were held for secular purposes: the promotion of moral values, the perpetuation of our institu- tions, and the teaching of literature. The Schempp Court rejected moral benefits and moral stabilization as secular justifications for state aid to religion. If moral stabilization is a valid secular pur- pose, then all sorts of aid to religion can be justified as secular in purpose, at least so long as non-religious agencies are also sub- sidized for their morally stabilizing effects. When secular purpose is defined so broadly, it can no longer be used effectively to distinguish permissible from impermissible programs. The focus of analysis must then shift to effect, and the primary significance of the Walz case lies in its approach to answering the question whether the effect of the statute is to further an impermissible establishment of religion. The Chief Justice's approach rests heavily on the definition he gives to es- tablishment; the gist of establishment for him is state sponsorship of religion.'7 "Sponsorship" seems to mean something significantly different from the "no-aid" formula, which is dismissed with a one sentence warning of "[t] he hazards of placing too much weight on a few words or phrases of the Court." 18 "Sponsorship," as the Chief Justice uses the word, has something of the connota- tion that it has when we say a local merchant "sponsors" a little league baseball team; the boys not only use the bats which the merchant bought for them but wear his name on their backs. The Chief Justice's view of establishment is superior in sev- eral respects to the "no-aid" ?iiew. First, the "no-aid" view was a substantial departure from the historical purposes of the estab- lishment clause, which appears to have been limited to prohibiting an established religion in the narrow sense of an officially pre- ferred church.'9 The Chief Justice's concept of "sponsorship" is much closer to the historical purpose of the establishment clause. Second, the Court's interpretation of "no-aid" had left it with unmanageable and undefinable standards. Unable to carry "no- aid" to its logical conclusion because too many desirable pro- grams would be blocked, the Court had turned to the purpose 15397 U.S. at 673. 16 374 U.S. 203, 223 (i963). 17 397 U.S. at 668, 669, 672. 18397 U.S. at 670. 19 See Corwin, The Supreme Court as National School Board, I4 LAW &amp; CONTEMP.

Schempp,20 which provided a method of escaping the absolute implications of "no-aid" without departing from its rhetoric. If a statute could be classified as secular in purpose and primary effect, its impact on religion could be dismissed as an insignificant side effect. Canons for identifying purpose and primary effect were never well developed, however, because the task at bottom was mean- ingless. It is difficult enough for a court to determine the purpose of a given group of legislators in enacting a particular statute. In the Sunday Closing Cases,2' however, the Court said that the analysis of purpose must be carried further; the crucial issue is the purpose which a particular statute, such as the Sunday closing law, has acquired at the present time. Since analysis of the ques- tion of contemporary purpose is unguided by legislative history concerning the evil which the statute was designed to correct, analysis of purpose tends to become simply a means of justifying whatever result one wants to reach. The question which of several effects of a statute is "primary" can only be answered if we specify the reason for which primacy is being determined, i.e., if we ask: primary as to what? A statute which provides aid to parochial schools may have the effect of improving educational standards as well as the effect of saving Catholic schools from extinction and thereby preserving them as instruments for inculcating Catholic values. Which effect is pri- mary depends solely on the values against which these effects are judged. The Chief Justice abandons the attempt to identify primary effect in favor of an empirical assessment of the degree to which a statute "entangles" the state with the church. Inquiry under Walz is thus focused on the establishment clause policies of eliminating religious strife as a divisive political force and pre- venting the state from imposing particular religious views. The "no-aid" view was further defective in that it thrust the establishment clause into recurring conflict with the free exercise clause. When a government program of general applicability, such as the draft,22 or the requirement of jury duty,23 or a prop- erty tax, interferes in a substantial way with individuals pursuing their religions, it may be argued either that the free exercise clause mandates an exemption or that the establishment clause prohibits one.24 The conflict can be resolved by balancing the 20374 U.S. at 222. 21366 U.S. 420, 582, 599, 6I7 (I960). 22 See United States v.

Giving too free a rein to the legislative imagination is an invitation to introduce religious strife into politics, with the Supreme Court placed in the role of a fire brigade, trying to extinguish fires of religious controversy after they have been kindled.27 An empirical assessment of the degree of entanglement is surely not necessary in every instance. Confusion might have been avoided if the majority had joined Justice Harlan in reiterating a proscription against statutes which coerce or encourage religious practices or which are non-neutral in application in that they single out religious institutions for aid rather than aiding them through a program directed toward a class of institutions of which churches are members.28 But if "excessive entanglement" is a sufficiently vague concept that it can be read as permitting a wide range of state aid to religion, it can also be read very restrictively. A three-judge district court recently relied on Walz in invalidating a statute which provided salary aid for teachers of secular subjects in religious schools.29 Instead of deciding the case by identifying a single effect as "primary," the court analyzed the "entanglement" of government with religion which the statute entailed and found that "entangle- ment" excessive. The impact of the Walz case will depend on the content that the Supreme Court gives to the concept of "excessive entangle- from a generally imposed burden as an accommodation to religious exercise. See Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U.S. 398 (I963) (Seventh Day Adventist must be exempted from a requirement of state unemployment compensation law which conflicted with her religious scruples against Saturday work); Zorach v. Clauson, 343 U.S. 306 (I952) (statute upheld exempting students from requirements of public school attendance to attend religious instruction). 25 For a good discussion of the possible means of resolving the conflict between the establishment clause and the free exercise clause, see Comment, The Consci- entious Objector and the First Amendment: There But for the Grace of God . . . ., 34 U.

Some knowledge of what that content is likely to be can be gained from analysis of the "entanglement" that existed in Walz. As the Chief Justice noted, the property tax exemption did not single out churches for aid; to have excluded churches from the class of nonprofit, benevolent institutions that were exempted might be viewed as discrimination against religion. Abstaining from taxing church property involves little or no con- tinuing administrative relationship between churches and the state, particularly under a statute like that of New York where the breadth of the class of exempt institutions is such as to obviate a requirement for making fine analyses of whether an institution is "religious" so as to qualify for the exemption.30 To remove the exemption would, as the Chief Justice argues, involve state and church in disputes over tax assessments and tax fore- closures. Many churches might be forced to move out of the inner city where property values are high and wealthy parishion- ers sparse. Important consequences flow from the fact that re- ligious exemptions from property tax are so widespread and of such long standing. Where churches have acquired property and constructed buildings in reliance on exemption, religious tensions in politics would be exacerbated, rather than calmed, by an effort to eliminate exemptions. Because tax exemptions for religious property are in many respects unique, the Walz holding is a narrow one. When the issue is a broad program of subsidy for religious and other pri- vate schools, most of the factors discussed above are reversed. An exemption is a one-time decision, but subsidies must be re- newed with periodic appropriations, so that issues of more or less can continue to divide the polity along religious lines.3' It is ex- tremely difficult, if not impossible, to prevent state funds from being used for the direct support of religious instruction without imposing administrative controls which threaten to secularize religious schools.32 Thus, the Court's "entanglement" analysis in Walz should lead it to condemn broad state programs of aid for instructional activities in religious schools. When the question of subsidies for religious schools comes before the Supreme Court, as it is likely to do in the near future,33 we may at least hope for more precise guidelines to the meaning of "excessive entangle- 30397 U.S. at 697 n.i.

Until then the Walz case leaves one thing clear: the "wall of separation between church and state" has been replaced by a filter. G. State and Federal Criminal Procedure i. Double Jeopardy: Right of Federal Government to Appeal Adverse Criminal Decisions. -In United States v. Sisson' the Court confronted a perplexing entanglement of the prohibitions of the double jeopardy clause 2 and the statutory right of the Gov- ernment to appeal in certain criminal cases.3 Indicted for resist- ing induction into the Armed Forces, Sisson sought to prove at trial that his refusal was not "willful" within the meaning of the Selective Service Act 4 because he reasonably believed the Vietnam War illegal under domestic and international law. Under instruc- tions that did not present the constitutional issues raised by Sisson before trial, the jury returned a verdict of guilty. Nevertheless, the trial judge, purporting to act under the arrest of judgment provision of Criminal Rule 34,5 set aside the jury's verdict be- cause he found that the indictment " [did] not charge an offense." 6 In reaching this conclusion, the trial judge, relying on evidence of Sisson's beliefs adduced at the trial, ruled that as applied to Sisson the Selective Service Act violated the right to free exercise of religion.7 The court found that as a "sincere conscientious objector," 8 Sisson's interest in not fighting in Vietnam out- weighed the Government's interest in sending him there.9 The Government appealed the decision directly to the Supreme Court under the Criminal Appeals Act of I907,10 the exclusive source of 1399 U.S. 267 (1970). 2 U.S. CONST. amend.

But in a 5-3 decision announced by Mr. Justice Harlan, the Court dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction, finding it not only outside the scope of the Appeals Act but also prohibited by the double jeopardy clause.1" The double jeopardy clause operates as a constitutional barrier to appeals by the government 12 from verdicts or judgments of acquittal no matter how erroneous their foundation in fact or law.13 This interpretation of the double jeopardy clause derives from the clause's origins in the common law plea of prior acquit- tal,14 which barred a second prosecution for the same offense, and from the equation of appeal with reprosecution.15 Under this rule, mistakes in factfinding, application of law, and trial rulings - all of which carry no greater impact than the erroneous acquit- tal of a particular defendant - may not be appealed. At the same time, there is no appeal from incorrect findings of law and jury instructions even though these errors may, through stare decisis, " Mr. Justice Black concurred only in the double jeopardy holding. The Chief Justice and Justices White and Douglas dissented in opinions by the Chief Justice and Mr. Justice White. See p. I39 infra. 12 The double jeopardy clause applies not only to the federal government, but also to the states through the fourteenth amendment. Benton v. Maryland, 395 U.S. 784 (I969). 13 United States v. Ball, I63 U.S. 662, 67I (I896). The term "acquittal" is some- times used simply to identify those decisions to which double jeopardy attaches, rather than to describe the nature of the decision. Used in the former, conclusory sense, the term would apply to orders discharging a jury without the defendant's consent and without the justification of "imperious necessity." See, e.g., Downum v. United States, 372 U.S. 734 (I963). The rule foreclosing government appeal from an acquittal has frequently been criticized. See, e.g., Miller, Appeals by the State in Criminal Cases, 36 YALE L.J. 486 (I927); Note, Statutory Implementation of Double Jeopardy Clauses: New Life for a Moribund Constitutional Guarantee, 65 YALE L.J. 339 (I956); Cf.

BLACKSTONE, COMMENTARIES *335-36. 15 See Kepner v. United States, I95 U.S. I00 (1904). The doctrinal basis of the equation is not clear. Appeal by the government may be treated as a second jeopardy on the grounds that it subjects the defendant to the possibility of a reprosecution on reversal, or the appeal itself may be viewed as the equivalent of a reprosecution in that it subjects the defendant to further proceedings in which his liberty is threatened. Mr. Justice White, implicitly taking the former view, argued that the appeal did not put Sisson twice in jeopardy because he would not have to be retried if the Court reversed the trial judge; the jury's verdict would simply be reinstated. 399 U.S. at 329. But if the Court constructed a free exercise test different from that of the trial judge, Sisson could have faced a remand to the district court for further factual findings, a proceeding which might be just as burdensome for him as a complete retrial.</page><page sequence="134">I970J THE SUPREME COURT, I969 TERM I35 impair the state's ability to prosecute successfully other defend- ants. In Sisson, the Court concluded that the Government's appeal was foreclosed by the double jeopardy clause, reasoning that the trial judge's decision to set aside the jury's guilty verdict on the basis of an affirmative defense supported by facts developed at trial was the equivalent of a directed acquittal.16 The decision was an acquittal, the majority held, because it was a "disposition . . .bottomed on factual conclusions . . . made on the basis of evidence adduced at the trial." 17 But Mr. Justice Harlan made no effort to discuss the reason why the double jeopardy clause should insulate a decision based on such facts. Underlying the double jeopardy protection is a determination that the state, with its vast resources, should not be permitted to harass a defendant with the burdens of renewed prosecution - "embarrassment, expense and ordeal . . . compelling him to live in a continuing state of anxiety and insecurity, as well as enhanc- ing the possibility that even though innocent he may be found guilty." 18 When proceedings culminating in a decision favorable to the defendant have already subjected him to extensive burdens, the policy of the double jeopardy prohibition denies the prosecu- tion a further opportunity for conviction, irrespective of the rea- son for that decision.19 Double jeopardy law has evolved, however, into a series of rigid, definitional rules, which are frequently obtuse and occasion- ally inconsistent.20 In Sisson, the Court assumed the existence of 16 FED.

See generally Note, Twice in Jeopardy, 75 YALE L.J. 262 (I965); Note, supra note I3. Double jeopardy also operates to protect the jury's exculpatory powers. Since the jury provides insulation against government oppression, see Duncan v. Louisiana, 39I U.S. 145, I55 (I968), this protection would be undermined if the government were able to have the jury's verdict overturned. See 399 U.S. at 329 (White, J., dissenting) (appeal should not override "a factfinder's decision that, whatever the law, Sisson should go free"). In Sisson, the jury did not pass on his affirmative defense, so that defense could be held invalid without Sisson's losing the benefit of a jury verdict in his favor. '9 Much of current double jeopardy law fails to reflect an analysis of burdens on the defendant. For example, double jeopardy does not preclude retrial if de- fendant is successful in reversing his conviction on appeal. See, e.g., United States v. Ball, I63 U.S. 662, 672 (I896). This result has been justified on the grounds that the defendant waived his objection to further prosecution by challenging the original conviction. In view of the alternative to bringing an appeal, it is difficult to argue that the waiver is voluntary. See Mayers &amp; Yarbrough, Bis Vexari: New Trials and Successive Prosecutions, 74 HARV. L.

Yet it made no effort to ground its rule in the policies be- hind the double jeopardy clause. The use of definitional rules as touchstones for the application of the clause may, in some in- stances, produce easily administered tests. But at the same time, a slavish reliance on all of these rules may inadequately safe- guard,2' or needlessly overprotect,22 the defendant. Thus, the Court should scrutinize the conventional formulae to determine whether they take into account the burdens the defendant has undergone, those he would shoulder during the appeal, and those he would face at a second trial. While application of the clause must turn on an inquiry into the burdens of the particular case, the Court should formulate new standards which reflect the policies of fairness that underlie the double jeopardy protection. Indeed, the very factor emphasized by Mr. Justice Harlan - the trial court's reliance on facts adduced at trial - can be taken to protect an important policy interest, although the Court's analysis did not approach it in these terms. Given the difficulty of gathering and preserving evidence and of convincing a factfinder of one's good character and credibility, a decision based on trial- generated facts should always be protected. If the defendant was once successful in demonstrating exculpatory facts at trial, he should not be required to face the risk of failing at a second attempt. By contrast, the burdens of presenting for a second time a legal argument based on facts alleged in the indictment or on facts which could be introduced before trial should not be as great as the burden of reproducing facts proving that the defend- ant did not commit the offense or supporting a legal argument that may be raised only after the trial has begun. The Court could well conclude, therefore, that the double jeopardy clause need not protect all legal judgments in the defendant's favor. Having concluded that the double jeopardy clause prevented government appeal in Sisson's case, the Court did not need to elaborate on the types of decisions for the defendant which would be appealable under the Criminal Appeals Act, since the Act neces- sarily operates within the boundaries of the double jeopardy prohibition. Nevertheless, the Court undertook a comprehensive interpretation of the statute.

LANDIS, THE BUSINESS OF THE SUPREME COURT I09-20 (1927).</page><page sequence="136">I970] THE SUPREME COURT, 1969 TERM 137 Supreme Court had held that the common law barred govern- ment appeals in criminal cases.24 In I906, President Theodore Roosevelt, incensed by the unappealable action of a federal trial judge in defeating an important trustbusting case,25 urged Con- gress to authorize appeals by the Government.26 In response, Congress established a government right of appeal directly to the Supreme Court from three types of decisions for the defendant: (I) a dismissal of the indictment where the trial court has found the statute on which the indictment was based to be constitu- tionally invalid, or construed it as inapplicable to the particular defendant; (2) a decision sustaining a "motion in bar" when the defendant has not been "put in jeopardy;" (3) a decision ar- resting a judgment of conviction where the court has found the indictment insufficient because the statute on which it was based was invalid or inapplicable to the defendant.27 The Court held in Sisson that the motion in bar 28 and dismissal provisions applied only to rulings on pretrial defenses,29 which, under Criminal Rule I2(b) ('),30 must be "capable of determination without the trial of the general issue." 31 In short, the Court held that as soon as the jury is empaneled, two of the Act's three categories became entirely inapplicable. With regard to the third category, the Court relied on the common law and present practice under 24 United States v. Sanges, 144 U.S. 310 (I892). 25 See United States v. Armour &amp; Co., I42 F. 8o8 (N.D. Ill. I906). See FRANKFURTER &amp; LANDIS, supra note 23, at II5-I8. 27 34 Stat. 1246 (i907), codified at i8 U.S.C. ? 3731 (i964).

See United States v. Mersky, 36I U.S. 431 (I960). 29 See 399 U.S. at 305 n.6o. The Court concluded that motions in bar must be raised before trial because the defendant is "put in jeopardy" when the jury is empaneled. Mr. Justice White contended that the phrase permitted appeal when- ever the defendant would not be "put in jeopardy" in the sense of constitutional double jeopardy. See 399 U.S. at 335-46. 30FED R. CRIM. P. I2(b) (I). 31 The Court has interpreted this rule restrictively, so as to allow decision before trial only "if trial of the facts surrounding the commission of the alleged offense would be of no assistance in determining the validity of the defense." United States v. Covington, 395 U.S. 57, 6o (i969). A district court will defer a constitu- tional question to trial "if it will be clarified by the production of evidence." i C. WRIGHT, FEDERAL PRACTICE &amp; PROCEDURE - CRIMINAL ? 194 (I969).

Since the "record" means essentially the indictment,33 an arrest of judgment within the meaning of the statute cannot be based on any facts developed before or during the trial.34 Thus, since the Court's construction of the entire statutory scheme permits appeal only from certain pretrial de- cisions under rule I2(b) (i) and certain posttrial decisions not dependent on facts outside the indictment,35 appeal can never lie from a legal finding for the defendant grounded on the facts surrounding the commission of the offense, unless those facts are alleged in the indictment. Given the Court's statutory construction, Sisson's constitu- tional "as applied" defense presented a situation outside the limits of the Government's right to appeal. As applied defenses raise the contention that "the [constitutionally] allowable scope of what Congress has written excludes a particular situation" 36 - the defendant's. Since Sisson's "situation" was not adequately elucidated in the indictment,37 he could establish his as applied defense only by introducing evidence of his position and arguing that the statute could not constitutionally be applied to him. Since this evidence was intertwined with the facts concerning his commission of the statutory offense,38 rule I2(b) (i) would bar its development prior to the trial.39 Thus, the case could not 32 See, e.g., Bond v. Dustin, II2 U.S. 604, 6o8 (i884); United States v. Zisblatt, I72 F.2d 740, 742 (2d Cir.), appeal dismissed on Government's motion, 336 U.S. 934 (i949). 33See United States v. Bradford, I94 F.2d I97, 20I (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 343 U.S. 979 (2952) (record includes indictment, plea, verdict and sentence). 34 The Court left undecided as to all three grounds whether a trial court's reliance upon facts developed only to prove standing would oust the Government's power to appeal. 399 U.S. at 284 n.i6. " It may be difficult to be sure that a postverdict decision does not depend on evidence adduced at trial. See United States v. Green, 350 U.S. 4I5 (2956). 36 Fleming v.

REv. 844, 844-52 (2970). 37 Occasionally the facts alleged in the indictment are sufficient to lay the founda- tion for an as applied defense without further development of the facts. See, e.g., United States v. Knox, 396 U.S. 77, 79 n.2 (i969) ; cf. United States v. Green, 350 U.S. 425 (2956). On the other hand, it may be clear that the defense must rely on facts outside the indictment. See, e.g., United States v. Wiesenfeld Ware- house Co., 376 U.S. 86, 9I-92 (i964). The permissibility of indictments merely tracking the language of the statute, see I C. WRIGHT, supra note 3i, at ?

The majority apparently would allow appeal</page><page sequence="138">I970] THE SUPREME COURT, 1969 TERM I39 have been appealed even in the absence of the double jeopardy clause holding. In separate dissenting opinions, Chief Justice Burger and Mr. Justice White asserted that the Court had read the statute too narrowly. Looking to the purpose of the statute, they argued that Congress had intended to give the Government an opportunity to vindicate its interest in protecting laws from all successful consti- tutional attacks.40 If read to effectuate this purpose, the statute would allow appeal from any decision holding a statute unconstitu- tional as applied, as well as from the clearly appealable decision holding a statute invalid on its face. But in their concentration on one of the statute's purposes, the dissenters slighted the equally pervasive congressional concern for the defendant's interests in avoiding further, protracted litiga- tion. Restrained by their solicitude for the defendant, the Senate sponsors of the bill apparently intended the statute to reach only trial decisions holding criminal statutes "null and void" as un- constitutional,41 decisions more far-reaching and injurious to the Government's interests than those which merely excise a par- ticular application from the statute's scope. Thus, despite the trial court's decision in Sisson, the Selective Service Act remained fully applicable to persons unable to seek shelter under Sisson's defense, and hence that decision did not nullify the Act's effective- ness. The case did not, consequently, fall within the range of cases from which Congress intended to provide an appeal. In contrast to the dissenters, the Court made no explicit in- quiry into the purposes behind the statute, but looked instead to the technical meaning of the statute's terms.42 Recognizing that the Act was essentially a compromise between the Government's interest in appealing significant inroads against its laws and the defendant's interest in avoiding continued prosecution, the Court's approach purported to offer the fullest possible respect for the legislature's resolution of the interests.43 The difficulty with this approach, however, is that the technical terms and precise cate- gories used by the statute do not appear to reflect accurately the balance of interests that Congress sought to achieve. For example, the Act explicitly authorizes direct appeals from decisions which construe a statute as inapplicable to a particular defendant, even from the successful assertion of as applied defenses that may be proved at pretrial hearings under rule 12(b)(I).

Since the categories of decisions appealable under the Appeals Act do not reflect any meaningful balancing of the conflicting interests, much less the balance Congress apparently intended in I907, new legislation is plainly required.44 Given the difficulty of articulating a rule that would produce a satisfactory balance of the interests in every case, the optimal solution is, perhaps, to give the Supreme Court power to review by certiorari running directly to the district courts every federal criminal case to which the double jeopardy prohibition does not attach. In exercising its certiorari discretion " the Court can properly consider the "gener- ality of the impact" 46 of the trial court's decision on the Govern- ment's ability to enforce its laws. By weighing this impact against the burdens the defendant has undergone to obtain his favorable trial decision, the Supreme Court can protect the interests of both parties while avoiding the technical complexity of the I907 Crim- inal Appeals Act.47 2. Double Jeopardy: Separate Sovereigns and "Same Of- fence." - Two cases decided by the Court during the October I969 Term dealt with difficult questions growing out of the Court's decision last year in Benton v. Maryland' which held that the fourteenth amendment makes the fifth amendment double jeopardy bar applicable to the states.2 In Waller v. "A bill pending in Congress would allow government appeal to the courts of appeals in all cases where appeal is not constitutionally foreclosed, except that decisions holding statutes invalid would be appealable directly to the Supreme Court. See H.R. I4588, gist Cong., ist Sess. (I969). This scheme is objectionable because it would subject the defendant to appeal even in cases where the Govern- ment's interest in review is slight, while the defendant's burdens have been more substantial. The present Appeals Act incorporates the same approach, making dismissals and arrests of judgment not based on statutory construction or constitu- tional invalidity appealable as of right to the courts of appeals. 45 See H. HART &amp; H. WECHSLER, THE FEDERAL COURTS AND THE FEDERAL SYSTEM I394-1405 (1953). 46United States v. Knox, 396 U.S. 77, 79 n.2 (i969) (Harlan, J.). Curiously, the Knox decision permitting appeal from the pretrial success of an as applied defense was ignored by the majority and minority Justices. Knox is not in- consistent with Sisson because Knox was decided without reference to facts outside the indictment. The Knox opinion does indicate, however, that the Court has on at least one occasion approached the question of appealability in terms of the balancing of interests. 47 See 399 U.S. at 308: [T]he Solicitor General, at oral argument in this case, forthrightly stated that "there are few problems which occur so frequently or present such extreme technical difficulty in the Solicitor General's office [as] the proper construction of the Criminal Appeals Act." 1395 U.S. 784 (i969). 2 Prior to Benton the view, as expressed in Palko v. Connecticut, 302 U.S.</page><page sequence="140">1970] THE SUPREME COURT, I969 TERM I4I Florida,3 a unanimous Court held that the double jeopardy clause prohibits a state from prosecuting an individual for the same offense for which he was prosecuted in a municipal court. And in deciding the scope of the "same offence" requirement,4 in Ashe v. Swenson the Court concluded that collateral estoppel is a requirement of the fifth amendment double jeopardy protec- tion which the states now must observe. In Waller, a municipal court had convicted petitioner and sentenced him to a six-month jail term for violating city ordi- nances against destruction of city property and breach of the peace. Shortly thereafter, a state court tried, convicted, and sentenced him to six years for grand larceny, a charge concededly based on the same evidence as was involved 6 in the municipal conviction.7 The supposed rationale behind allowing these successive prosecutions is that states and municipalities, like the state and federal governments, are "separate sovereigns," and each separate sovereign should retain the right to prosecute for violations of its respective laws.8 The support for this contention is drawn largely from several Supreme Court cases 9 holding that succes- sive prosecutions by state and federal authorities do not violate the fifth amendment. The cases assert that the Constitution gives each the power to try a single defendant separately, and the fifth amendment double jeopardy bar does not apply to thwart 3I9 (I937), had been that the concept of ordered liberty embodied in the due process clause did not require adherence to the federal double jeopardy standards arising from the fifth amendment. 3397 U.S. 387 (1970). 4 "[N]or shall any person be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb."

While state and federal authorities draw separate independent powers from the United States Constitution, the powers of a municipality are merely a delegated portion of those of the state.-3 For the purposes of the double jeopardy clause, then, the state and its municipalities are but one entity.14 Consequently, when the double jeopardy clause prevents a state from trying a defendant more than once, the state cannot subvert this bar by creating lower levels of government each with an independent power to try and convict for state crimes.15 Municipal and state trials, 10 See United States v.

" See Abbate v. United States, 359 U.S. I87, I95 (I959) (three-month state sentence; federal prosecution could result in five-year term); Screws v. United States, 325 U.S. 9I, I38-39 (I945) (Roberts, J., dissenting) (federal statute pro- vided one-year maximum sentence, while state could try defendant for murder). See generally I968 DUKE L.J. 362. 12While Mr. Justice Black joined the opinion of the Court in Waller, he re- affirmed the position taken in his dissents in Bartkus and Abbate where he expressed doubt that state and nation could be considered two wholly separate sovereigns. He also noted that even nations often accept a foreign conviction as a bar, and argued that the double jeopardy safeguard is more crucial than the concept of sep- arate sovereignties. Abbate v. United States, 359 U.S. i87, 202-04 (I959) (Black, J., dissenting). The federal-state separate sovereignty doctrine has been criticized elsewhere. See, e.g., Grant, The Lanza Rule of Successive Prosecutions, 32 COLUM. L. REV. I309 (1932). After Abbate, the United States Attorney General ordered that after a state prosecution no federal prosecution could be brought without his personal approval.

Many states similarly bar prosecutions after the federal courts have acted. See, e.g., CAL. PENAL CODE ? 656 (West 1954); N.Y. CODE CRIM. PROC. ? I39 (McKinney 1958).

United States, 206 U.S. 333, 354 (I907). 14 Mr. Chief Justice Burger quoted portions of the Florida constitution to demonstrate that the municipal court's power "springs from the same organic law that created the state court" and thus is not a power of a separate sovereign. 397 U.S. at 393. As discussed in text, however, examination of the state constitu- tion was unnecessary, because Florida does not have the power to make such a delegation, no matter how it words its grant. 15 In a different context the Court used very broad language in refuting the state-municipality separate sovereignty argument:</page><page sequence="142">I970] THE SUPREME COURT, I969 TERM I43 therefore, are more analogous to successive prosecutions by dif- ferent arms of the federal government, and such prosecutions have been held constitutionally barred.16 Mr. Justice Brennan, in a separate concurring opinion, would have gone further to hold that the double jeopardy clause "barred a second trial since all the charges grew out of the same criminal episode" 17 regardless of the number of sovereigns involved. This problem of defining the "same offence" language of the fifth amendment was more directly before the Court in Ashe v. Swenson."8 Ashe had been acquitted of the robbery of one of six participants in a poker game, but was subsequently tried, con- victed, and sentenced to a 35-year prison term for the robbery of another of the poker players. The result was affirmed on appeal 19 and upon collateral attack 20 in state courts. The Su- preme Court, per Mr. Justice Stewart,21 held that collateral estop- pel is incorporated in the fifth amendment prohibition against double jeopardy and therefore an issue which has been determined in defendant's favor at one trial can not be relitigated.22 Since Political subdivisions of States - counties, cities, or whatever - never were and never have been considered as sovereign entities. Rather, they have been traditionally regarded as subordinate governmental instrumentalities created by the State to assist in the carrying out of state governmental functions. Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. 533, 575 (I964) (state reapportionment plan based on equal representation for each existing county rejected). Similarly, in Hunter v. City of Pittsburgh, 207 U.S. i6i, I78 (I907) (petitioner could not prevent the state-approved consolidation of a small city into Pittsburgh), the Court stated: Municipal corporations are political subdivisions of the State, created as convenient agencies for exercising such of the governmental powers of the State as may be entrusted to them. . . . The number, nature, and duration of the powers conferred upon these corporations . . . rests in the absolute discretion of the State.

Concurring in Ashe, Justice Harlan reiterated his</page><page sequence="143">I44 HARVARD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 84:I the only controverted issue in Ashe's first trial was his participa- tion in the mass robbery, the Court held that collateral estoppel bars the subsequent trial because it required relitigation of this issue. Collateral estoppel as used by the Court is an attempt to help define the limits of the "same offence" language of the Con- stitution. It differs significantly from the traditional same evi- dence test,23 which bars multiple trials only when one of the charges represents a lesser offense of the other - that is, convic- tion on one charge requires proof of at least all the elements of the other charge.24 The same evidence test provides no protec- tion when each charge "requires proof of an additional fact which the other does not," 25 even when these additional facts may be only minor and unchallenged elements of a statutory definition.26 Because of the proliferation of modern statutory offenses,27 this test rarely hinders a state desirous of bringing multiple prosecu- tions.28 The collateral estoppel test, on the other hand, will bar subsequent prosecutions whenever any crucial element of the second offense was necessarily decided by the first verdict of ac- quittal. The Court noted that collateral estoppel, while originally developed in civil litigation, had been an established rule of fed- eral criminal law at least since i9I6 when the Court decided United States v. Oppenheimer.29 Subsequent cases developed the doctrine into a requirement that the prior trial "be set in a practi- belief in the correctness of Hoag under fourteenth amendment standards, but, having acceded in North Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U.S. 7II, 744 (i969), to the Benton result, agreed that the federal collateral estoppel doctrine required the result now reached by the Court. 23 The case in which this test was constructed was King v. Vandercomb, 2 Leach 708, 720, i68 Eng. Rep. 455, 46i (Ex. I796). The test has also been used by the Supreme Court in delimiting the "same offence" language of the Constitu- tion. Blockburger v.

However, the fifth amendment, by its very terms, protects defendants, not the state or complaining witnesses, from double jeopardy.34 Notions of "mutuality" cannot play any role in this aspect of criminal prose- cutions given the comparatively unlimited resources of the state. Thus, while the double jeopardy provision shares many features with civil rules of finality- enabling the defendant to consider the matter closed and plan his future accordingly,35 protecting him from continued distress,36 and saving both sides the cost of 30 Sealfon v.

It can help to equalize the adversary capabilities of two grossly mis- matched litigants and to prevent the state from reducing its burden of proof by obtaining a conviction although winning be- fore only one of a number of juries. The Chief Justice also sought to prove that collateral estoppel, if applicable, would not bar a second trial here. Thus, he hypothe- sized a state of facts whereby a jury could have acquitted Ashe at the first trial for reasons which were not determinative of his guilt on the second charge.38 However, his theory is either ex- ceedingly imaginative or requires the assumption that the first jury acted irrationally and contrary to the trial court's instruc- tions.39 To allow the use of farfetched conjecture or assumptions of jury irrationality would inevitably nullify the value of the collateral estoppel test in implementing the double jeopardy clause. Mr. Justice Brennan, in a concurring opinion joined by justices Marshall and Douglas, expanded on his Waller concur- rence and argued for incorporation of a same transaction test into the double jeopardy "same offence" clause.40 This test would require joinder at one trial of all charges against a defendant which grew out of a single criminal "occurrence," "episode," or "transaction" 41 except in a few extraordinary instances.42 Justice Brennan noted that the same evidence interpretation was not con- serves to prevent the state from wearing out the accused with a multiplicity of trials). 37 See Note, Twice in Jeopardy, 75 YALE L.J. 262, 277-78 (I965). 3 Reading the facts most favorably to this theory, Ashe was elsewhere in the house, purely by coincidence (possibly robbing a woman who was upstairs), when Knight was robbed, saw that there was a robbery in progress and joined in robbing Roberts. 39 The instructions made it clear that if Ashe were involved with the other robbers it would not matter whether he personally robbed Knight. 397 U.S. at 439 n.3. Thus, to have acquitted Ashe, a rational jury must have found he was neither present at that moment nor a cohort of the others. 40 The test prescribes analysis of defendant's actions, rather than the evi- dence or statutory provisions involved. Obviously, this test too could be so nar- rowed as to defeat protection, since almost any activity can be split up into a huge number of isolated "acts." While the scope of "same transaction" may be incapable of precise definition, Mr. Justice Brennan made it clear that he intended a very broad protection by his use of the words "occurrence," "episode," and "act" in the alternative to help define what he meant by "same transaction." 41 For a discussion of compulsory joinder, see Note, supra note 37, at 292-96. 42 For example, if a crime is not discovered - despite police diligence - until after commencement of a prosecution arising from the same transaction, or if no single court had jurisdiction of all the crimes, multiple prosecutions would be appropriate. See 397 U.S. at 453 n.7 (Brennan, J., concurring). If not for this latter exception (which is also part of the "same evidence" test), the decisions in Abbate and Bartkus could not stand.</page><page sequence="146">I970] THE SUPREME COURT, I969 TERM 147 stitutionally or historically required" and has in fact led to "vexatious multiple prosecutions." 4 The Court failed to embrace the same transaction test, limiting itself to the less far-reaching and more familiar collateral estoppel grounds for reversal. Since collateral estoppel was sufficient to re- verse the conviction in the present case, the Court's approach may have been influenced by the fact that it previously had avoided adoption of the same transaction test.45 However, collateral estoppel may be a very difficult concept for lower courts to apply. In many cases multiple defenses or conflicting testimony will effectively conceal the findings on which the jury based its general verdict of acquittal. Thus, the acquittal will not serve as a double jeopardy bar. Even in a case as straightforward as Aske, where the only asserted defense was of nonpresence at the scene of the crime, Mr. Chief Justice Burger felt justified in construing the jury's verdict to avoid the prohibition of the collateral estoppel rule.46 The collateral estoppel rule ultimately leaves a great deal to the unguided discretion of the individual judge.47 A same transaction test would avoid these problems, since any difficult questions of definition and application could be resolved by re- quiring the state to provide joinder of offenses. Beside this pragmatic advantage, a same transaction test also seems much more consistent with the purposes underlying the double jeopardy protection. By requiring joinder it would elimi- nate multiple trials brought to harass the defendant or to clarify 43397 U.S. at 452-53 (Brennan, J., concurring). 441 d. at 454. Mr. Chief Justice Burger's fear, id. at 469 (Burger, C.J., dissenting), that a defendant could avoid prosecution for all but one of multiple crimes com- mitted during a "single transaction" under this test merely by successfully arguing for a separation of counts (as defendants often do), and then pleading double jeopardy at any subsequent trial, is unwarranted. Any defendant who succeeded in having the trials separated could be estopped from asserting "same transaction double jeopardy" as a defense to a later charge. See generally Note, supra note 37, at 295. The Chief Justice's related fear that all additional crimes would be "free," 397 U.S. at 469, is also groundless. A same transaction test need not forbid multiple consecutive sentences for these multiple crimes. Although for double jeopardy purposes only one "offence" has been committed, the "offence" may be a combination or multiple crime for which legislatures reasonably pro- vide longer overall sentences. The purpose of a same transaction test is to insure that the defendant bears the burden of trying to convince only one jury of the truth of his defense. 4 See Hoag v. New Jersey, 356 U.S. 464, 473 (1958) (Warren, C.J., dissent- ing; id. at 477 (Douglas, J., dissenting). 46397 U.S. at 468 (Burger, C.

Whenever the first trial results in a guilty verdict, collateral estoppel will not bar further trials, while a same transaction test, having re- quired joinder, will.48 Thus, the same transaction test would save the defendant the heavy burdens of multiple trials, while imping- ing upon no valid interests of the state.49 3. Plea Bargaining. - Recent Supreme Court decisions had cast some doubts on the constitutionality of plea bargaining.' In Brady v. United States 2 and Parker v. North Carolina,3 the Court last Term dispelled those doubts. In I959, Robert Brady and a codefendant were accused of kidnaping in violation of the Federal Kidnaping Act.4 Brady, through counsel, pleaded not guilty. Upon learning that his codefendant had confessed and would testify against him at trial, however, he changed his plea to guilty. In so doing, he limited the statutory maximum sen- tence that could be imposed to life imprisonment, whereas if he had been tried by a jury he could have, on jury recommendation, been sentenced to death. In I964, Charles Parker was arrested and interrogated in connection with a recent burglary and rape. After several hours of questioning and a night in jail, he con- fessed. Parker could have been convicted at trial of first-degree burglary, a capital crime. Instead he pleaded guilty, thereby ensuring himself a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment. Four years thereafter, the Supreme Court in United States v. Jackson ' held the death penalty scheme of the Kidnaping Act 48See 397 U.S. at 459 n.I3 (Brennan, J., concurring). 49 Since all of the legal issues can be adequately resolved in one consolidated trial, the only advantage to the state in multiple trials is to increase the chance of finding a sympathetic jury to provide at least one conviction. ' E.g., United States v. Jackson, 390 U.S. 570 (i968), noted in The Supreme Court, I967 Term, 82 HARV. L. REV. 63, I56 (I968); Garrity v. New Jersey, 385 U.S. 493 (i967); Griffin v. California, 380 U.S. 609 (i965); Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U.S. i (i964). In these cases the Court found unjustifiable the state's actions which made the exercise of a constitutional right so burdensome that an individual would hesitate to assert the right. The chance to get a reduced sentence after a guilty plea (and the concomitant prospect of a higher sentence if convicted at trial) makes persons accused of crimes hesitant to assert their constitutional rights not to plead guilty and to have a jury trial. Arguments against the constitution- ality of plea bargaining may be found in Note, The Unconstitutionality of Plea Bargaining, 83 HARV. L. REV. 1387 (I970), and Comment, Another Look at Un- constitutional Conditions, II7 U. PA. L. REV. I44 (i968). The best judicial analysis of the problem has been by Chief Judge Bazelon in Scott v. United States, 4I9 F.2d 264 (D.C. Cir. i969), and Pettyjohn v. United States, 4I9 F.2d 65I, 66o (D.C. Cir. i969) (dissenting opinion). 2397 U.S. 742 (1970). 3397 U.S. 790 (1970). I8 U.S.C. ?

The state's legitimate interest in having the death penalty imposed only by a jury could be furthered in a way that did not needlessly encourage guilty pleas and jury waivers. Brady and Parker, relying on Jackson, attacked their convic- tions in collateral proceedings. Brady asserted that his plea was involuntary because it was a product of the statutory scheme invalidated in Jackson; Parker made a similar contention as to the effect of the North Carolina statute. The lower courts denied their petitions. In Brady's case the court of appeals, in affirming the denial of relief, found that the plea had been a tactical de- cision reached after deliberation with counsel and made to avoid a perfunctory trial at which testimony by Brady's codefendant would have been sure to convict him.6 In Parker's case, the North Carolina courts held simply that a plea tendered to receive sentencing benefits was constitutionally acceptable.7 The Supreme Court, Mr. Justice White for the majorities,8 affirmed each decision. The majority reasoned that since the motivation behind Brady's guilty plea - the availability of his codefendant's incriminating testimony - was independent of the statute, the effect of the statutory scheme was at most marginal and not relevant to a determination of the voluntariness of his plea. Moreover, even if Brady's plea had been given to avoid the possibility of the death sentence, as was true in Parker, this factor was not in itself enough to invalidate the plea as involun- tary. Jackson had never held that all guilty pleas tendered under Federal Kidnaping Act indictments were involuntary. The Court noted that guilty pleas are encouraged at all points in the crim- inal process and the circumstances of Parker's and Brady's pleas were hardly distinguishable from those situations where the de- fendant pleads guilty to get sentencing leniency from the judge, or the prosecutor drops some counts in return for a guilty plea on one count. A system which allows a defendant to avoid. the risk of a more severe penalty by tendering a guilty plea and, 6 Brady v. United States, 404 F.2d 6oi (ioth Cir. i968). 7Parker v. State, 2 N.C.

They agreed that the penalty scheme of the Federal Kidnapping Act had had no effect on Brady's plea, but felt that Parker had been motivated to plead guilty by the possibility of a death sentence if he had been convicted at trial. 397 U.S. at 799, 8 2-i6.</page><page sequence="149">I50 HARVARD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 84:I at the same time, to extend a substantial benefit to the state- allowing the conservation of scarce prosecutorial and judicial re- sources - is constitutional. A guilty plea offered by a defendant who understands correctly the consequences of the plea is volun- tary unless coerced or obtained under false pretenses.9 Any potentially coercive effect of the bargaining process itself can be cured by the effective assistance of counsel, which both Brady and Parker had. The decisions in Brady and Parker are crucial to the present administration of the criminal justice system. Almost any de- fendant who offers to plead guilty can avoid the risk of receiving a more severe sentence if he were to be convicted at trial.10 The overwhelming caseloads confronting prosecutors and judges make them willing to reduce or drop charges or to recommend and give lenient sentences in return for guilty pleas.1' Given the present amount of resources available to handle criminal trials, if approximately seventy percent of the dispositions and ninety percent of the convictions did not end in guilty pleas,'2 the criminal justice system would shift from its present low gear to a halt. Brady and Parker so plainly accept the practice as to stim- ulate a collective sigh of relief throughout the country from prosecutors and trials judges 13 who had been troubled by Jack- See 397 U.S. at 755, quoting with approval, Shelton v.

CHI. L. REV. 50, 52-58 (I968); Note, Guilty Plea Bargaining: Compromises by Prosecutors to Secure Guilty Pleas, II2 U. PA. L. REV. 865, 90I (i964). Alschuler reports that the factor most likely to influence the prosecutor to plea bargain is his estimate of the probability that he will convict the defendant on the original charge at trial. Alschuler, supra, at 58-85. Nevertheless, without the pressures generated by the large number of defendants that must be processed to a final determination of guilt or innocence, it seems unlikely that plea bargaining would be as prevalent as it now is. 12 E.g., ANNUAL REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICE OF THE UNITED STATES COURTS I969 at 273, in REPORTS OF THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE JUDICIAL CONFERENCE OF TIE UNITED STATES (1970). 13 For example, the Court characterized Brady's argument as asserting that "it violates the Fifth Amendment to influence or encourage a guilty plea by op-</page><page sequence="150">I9701 THE SUPREME COURT, 1969 TERM I5I son's invalidation of a sentence differential between those persons who went to trial and those persons who pleaded guilty.'4 There is a surface logic to refusing to permit a defendant to attack his bargained-for plea. A defendant hardly suffers be- cause he is the victim of a lower sentence than might have been imposed if the case went to trial. Such "logic," however, marks a major theoretical shift in the nature of the guilt-determining process. The criminal trial has traditionally been thought the crucible from which the truth as to the defendant's guilt emerges. But when trials become relatively infrequent, guilt-determina- tions are in large part administrative. Thus, the Court implicitly relied on the accuracy of these administrative determinations to justify the pressures placed on a defendant to plead guilty. Prob- ably the Court is correct that most defendants who voluntarily plead guilty have in fact committed the crimes with which they are charged.'5 Nevertheless, there are few safeguards that assure this result with the same compelling force as a jury's verdict of guilty.'6 The prosecutor's job does not require him to be assured of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. And regardless of his inno- cence, the accused may feel that he is likely to be convicted and portunity or promise of leniency and that a guilty plea is coerced and invalid if influenced by the fear of a possibly higher penalty for the crime charged if a conviction is obtained after the State is put to its proof." 397 U.S. at 750-5I. In rejecting this contention, the Court said: We decline to hold, however, that a guilty plea is compelled and invalid under the Fifth Amendment wherever motivated by the defendant's desire to accept the certainty or probability of a lesser penalty rather than face a wider range of possibilities extending from acquittal to conviction and a higher penalty authorized by law for the crime charged. 397 U.S. at 75I. In his concurring and dissenting opinion, Mr. Justice Brennan faulted the Court for writing its opinion so as to reach the plea bargaining question. He argued that Brady and Parker were distinguishable from most plea bargaining situations on three grounds: first, the death penalty was involved in these cases whereas in most cases the bargain only involves a variation on a term of years; second, the statute set the differential whereas usually the differential is set ad- ministratively with the defendant taking part in the bargain; third, the legislative differential affected all defendants, whereas plea bargaining should only take place with defendants who are guilty. 397 U.S. at 8o8-io. 1See Note, supra note i, at I395-I407. 15But cf.

Arguably, defense counsel has an obligation to put the state on its proof in doubt- ful cases. But frequently counsel, particularly assigned counsel, work on only a flat fee basis and it is in their interest to get the defendant to plead guilty so they can get their fee and move on to the next case. Consequently, if the Court is to surround the guilty plea process with the same degree of safeguards as are present at trial, it will have to rely on the guilty plea judge. Yet, although some steps have been taken in this area,17 the judge lacks the resources-in terms of both time and investigatory powers- and the necessary directions from the Court to do an effective job of protecting the defendant from what is often an otherwise coercive system.'8 The opinions in Brady and Parker make no attempt to deal with the Court's earlier decisions in cases like Malloy v. Hogan,19 Griffin v. California,20 and Garrity v. New Jersey,2' which held that the state might not put an individual to certain unhappy choices like the one differential sentencing presents. In these cases the Court sought to protect the constitutional right not to incriminate oneself against the state's conditioning a receipt of a benefit (or avoidance of a burden) on a forfeiture of the right. The pressures that the individual faced in these cases were not more severe than those faced by the individual in the usual plea bargaining case and almost certainly less severe than those faced by Brady and Parker. The Court seems unlikely to be able to 17 See Boykin v. Alabama, 395 U.S. 238 (I969) (judge required to "canvas" the entry of the guilty plea with the defendant). 18 The nature of the constitutional examination of the defendant by the trial judge is hardly clear from the Court's one opinion on the subject. See Boykin v. Alabama, 395 U.S. 238 (I969). The judge might be constitutionally required to determine that there is a factual basis for the defendant's plea. Presently federal trial judges are required to make this determination. FED. R. CRIM. P. I I; see McCarthy v. United States, 394 U.S. 459 (I969). But while judicial inquiry may prevent blatant pleading errors by uncounseled defendants, it is unlikely to do much more. The defendant will not desire to rebut the prosecution's prima facie case because to do so will lose him the benefit of his bargain. Without in- vestigatory resources, the judge can hardly attempt to build up the case of an unwilling defendant. Indeed the judge may be reluctant to do so since any such attempt may well cost the defendant some time in jail if he is ultimately convicted. 19378 U.S. i (I964) (fifth amendment privilege against self-incrimination held applicable to the states; petitioner could not constitutionally be held in contempt of gambling probe referee for refusing to answer questions whose answers might incriminate him). 20380 U.S. 609 (I965) (trial judge cannot, consistently with the fifth amend- ment, comment on a defendant's failure to testify). 21 385 U.S. 493 (I967) (conviction invalid when based on self-incriminating testimony given on threat of loss of job as policeman); accord, Spevack v.

Brady and Parker can be reconciled with these earlier self- incrimination holdings only by candid recognition that the Court is willing to honor administrative needs to the detriment of con- stitutional rights if those needs seem compelling enough. In each of the earlier cases, the Court seemed convinced that the admin- istration of criminal justice would not suffer appreciably as a result of the holding. The fact that this cannot be said of a holding invalidating plea bargaining may well be the only ra- tional grounds for distinguishing the cases. Still, the Court might have distinguished Brady and Parker from the usual plea bargaining situation.22 When the death pen- alty is involved, the individual interest is far more crucial than when the differential is a matter of several years. The added burden to the judicial machinery would have been small if con- victions had been vacated in capital cases where the presence of the death penalty probably operated to reduce substantially the number of trials.23 Such a holding could have been harmonized with Jackson as standing for special treatment of thoje cases in which the death penalty is involved.24 The convict with perhaps the strongest argument against plea bargaining is the one who, because he was convicted at trial, has been given a longer sentence than he would have received if he had pleaded guilty. He would appear to stand in the position of the successful petitioner in United States v. Jackson, who found his potential sentences different depending on whether or not he asserted his trial rights. But close analysis of Jackson, as interpreted in Brady and Parker, reveals that even the jury- convicted defendant who can prove that he received a longer sentence because of his mode of trial will not be able to overturn his sentence. The Jackson Court declared the death penalty unconstitutional as imposed by the Federal Kidnaping Act, not because it burdened the trial right per se, but because the goal of having a jury determine whether to impose the death penalty could have been reached in a less restrictive manner.25 In con- trast, the goal of conserving scarce prosecutorial and judicial resources cannot, without major reform of the system, be reached in any less drastic manner than encouraging the flow of guilty 22 See note I3 supra. 23 Discussion of special treatment for capital cases may, of course, be mooted in the near future by a Supreme Court holding that the death penalty is uncon- stitutional.

Ultimately, the Court's reliance in Brady and Parker on the practical, administrative needs of the system calls into question the continuing validity of Jackson. If avoidance of administra- tive overload is a legitimate state interest,27 then the Government misargued Jackson. Instead of arguing that the reason for the differential was the desire to allow the jury to decide when the death penalty would be invoked, the argument should have been that the overloading of the courts required a sentencing structure that encouraged defendants to forgo their right to jury trial. Only differential sentencing could produce this result. Thus, the decisions in Brady and Parker raise the question whether a state may have a pattern for all crimes of differential sentences that would induce defendants to forgo criminal trials.28 The Court did not face directly the question of what sorts of coercive pressures the state could legitimately impose on the defendant, because the majority assumed that defense counsel's presence effectively dissipated whatever pressures the grinding of the wheels of justice might generate. The Court relied on an analogy to the confession cases to support its claims of the effec- tiveness of counsel in relieving pressure on an accused involved in plea bargaining.- Yet the effectiveness of counsel in the cus- todial interrogation situation results from the unique pressures of interrogation that do not affect the defendant during the greater part of the criminal process. Custodial interrogation is inherently coercive because the defendant is placed in an unsettling context 26 Of course, the system could be redesigned. Fewer persons could be prose- cuted, some crimes eliminated, and much more money could be devoted to the provision of trial resources. 27 But cf. Bruton v. United States, 39I U.S. I23, I35 (i968) (to "secure greater speed, economy and convenience in the administration of the law at the price of fundamental principles of constitutional law" is to pay too high a price); Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 479-8I (I966): A recurrent argument . . . is that society's need for interrogation outweighs the privilege. . . . The whole thrust of our foregoing discussion demonstrates that the Constitution has prescribed the rights of the individual when con- fronted with the power of government when it provided in the Fifth Amend- ment that an individual cannot be compelled to be a witness against himself. That right cannot be abridged. See also Fay v. Noia, 372 U.S. 39I, 424 (i963). 28 For instance, could a state require that a judge impose a sentence on a con- victed defendant, not knowing whether he had been convicted at trial or through a guilty plea, and then add six months or six years to the sentences of all defendants who went to trial? See Marder v. Massachusetts, 377 U.S. 407 (i964), aff'g per curiam, 346 Mass. 408, I93 N.E.2d 695 (i963) (drivers accused of traffic violations face stiffer penalties if they contest their guilt). 29 397 U.S. at 754.</page><page sequence="154">I970] THE SUPREME COURT, 1969 TERM I55 and is isolated from persons who provide him support to resist interrogation pressures.30 Because a lawyer provides the defend- ant with a touchstone in a hostile environment, his presence can overcome a great deal of the coercive impact of custodial inter- rogation. He can assert, for example, the rights of the defendant that the defendant is unlikely to know or assert to a hostile interrogator.3' The pressures to plead guilty that result from a trade of benefits, however, do not depend upon the isolation of a defend- ant in a hostile environment. Though a lawyer can explain to the defendant the consequences of his choice in each instance, he cannot remove the coercion inherent in the choice. And unlike the interrogation situation where it is almost always in the de- fendant's interest not to confess, in situations like Brady's reason- able men may differ on the better choice. Thus, the presence of a lawyer in the Brady situation is much less significant for the defendant than it is in the confession situation. Honest appraisal of the plea bargaining process in the future will demand that the Court not rely on the presence of counsel as a crucial factor in the determination of the voluntariness of a plea of guilty. It should be clear that the Court's decision rests on a deter- mination that the country will on balance gain more from the elimination of jury trials through plea bargaining than it would gain from the trial of those who give bargained-for guilty pleas. Yet the values sacrificed as a result of plea bargaining are sig- nificant. The Court has said the value of jury trial rests in its ability to prevent oppression by the Government.... 'Providing an accused with the right to be tried by a jury of his peers gave him an inestimable safeguard against the corrupt or overzealous prosecutor and against the compliant, biased, or eccentric judge.' . . . Given this purpose, the essential feature of a jury obviously lies in the interposition between the accused and his accuser of the commonsense judgment of a group of laymen and in the community participation and shared responsibility that results from that group's determination of guilt or innocence.32 It may be that the judiciary perceives itself as lacking the institutional capacity to make a decision that requires the legis- lature to appropriate much more money to the system or that 30 See Driver, Confession and the Social Psychology of Coercion, 82 HARV. L. REV. 42 (I968). 31 There are other justifications for the lawyer's presence, including deterrence of police excesses. See United States v. Wade, 388 U.S. 2I8 (I967). 32 Williams v.

But judicial abstention should not lessen the legislative obligation to maintain constitutional values.33 The legislatures have the power to structure the present system so as to eliminate, or at least limit, plea bargaining. For example, the sentencing authority might be required to sentence the defendant without knowing whether he had been convicted at a trial or after a plea. Unlike the courts, the legislatures have the power to assure that the requisite additional resources are spent to provide jury trials. If the jury trial is to maintain a fundamental place in the crim- inal justice system, it will be incumbent on the legislatures, after Brady and Parker, to ensure this occurrence. 4. Proof Beyond a Reasonable Doubt in Juvenile Proceedings. - Twelve-year old Samuel Winship was found guilty of juvenile delinquency I in New York Family Court for stealing $I I2 from a woman's pocketbook, an act which, if done by an adult, would have constituted the crime of larceny. While the judge acknowl- edged that the alleged facts might not have been proven beyond a reasonable doubt, he concluded that they were established by a preponderance of the evidence - all that the New York statute required.2 At the subsequent dispositional hearing, Winship was ordered placed in a training school for an initial period of eight- een months, subject to annual extensions until his eighteenth birthday - a possible six-year commitment. Unsuccessful in overturning the judgment in the New York courts,3 he appealed to the Supreme Court. In a 5-3 decision, In re Winship,4 the Court reversed. In an opinion by Mr. Justice Brennan the Court held, first, that "the Due Process Clause protects the accused against conviction except upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt of every fact necessary to constitute the crime with which he is charged;" and second, that the reasonable doubt standard is also "required during the adjudicatory stage of a delinquency proceeding ...

The precise "reasonable doubt" formulation did not appear before the late eighteenth century,7 and even then only in capital cases. But there has been a widespread belief, with ven- erable lineage,8 that a trier of fact in a criminal case must be as fully convinced of his conclusion as possible short of an absolute, unattainable certainty.9 While the Court had never before specif- ically held the standard to be constitutionally required, it was frequently assumed to be 10 and has been adopted throughout the country." In Winship the Court found that the standard reduces that fundamental fairness in juvenile cases requires the criminal standard of proof since it more adequately protects a youth without jeopardizing the special advan- tages of such proceedings. Chief Justice Burger, joined by Mr. Justice Stewart, dissented from the Court's second holding, and thus from its result, without com- menting on the first. He argued that the majority's decision rested "entirely on the assumption that all juvenile proceedings are 'criminal prosecutions,' hence subject to constitutional limitations," and insisted that the decision would "further [strait- jacket] an already overly-restricted system." Id. at 375-76. In a separate opinion, Mr. Justice Black dissented from the Court's first holding and thus from its decision. He reiterated his belief that fourteenth amendment due process embodies no general subjective notion of "fairness," but only incor- porates against the states those protections afforded by the Bill of Rights. But see Turner v. United States, 396 U.S. 398, 427 (I970) (Black, J., dissenting) (there is a "fundamental constitutional principle . . . that the Government . . . must demonstrate . . . beyond a reasonable doubt each essential element of the alleged offense"). While Mr. Justice Harlan dismissed the "incorporation" argu- ment in a footnote, 397 U.S. at 372-73 n.5, the majority ignored it, implicitly assuming that the due process clause is not so limited but rather includes a man- date for judicial scrutiny of the "fairness" of state proceedings, which can be considered procedural, rather than substantive, due process.

For these reasons, and be- cause of the defendant's strong interests in liberty and reputation, the factfinder must reach "a subjective state of certitude of the facts in issue." 12 Further, the reasonable doubt standard pre- serves respect and confidence in the criminal law by insuring that citizens are not "in doubt whether innocent men are being con- demned," and it protects the general security of the community by assuring each individual "that his government cannot adjudge him guilty . . . without convincing a proper factfinder of his guilt with utmost certainty." 13 12 397 U.S. at 364, quoting Dorsen &amp; Rezneck, In re Gault and the Future of Juvenile Law, I FAMILY L.Q. I, 26 (Dec. I967). 13397 U.S. at 364. Rather than taking this subjective approach, Mr. Justice Harlan explained the reasonable doubt standard in probabilistic terms. Since "unassailably accurate knowledge of what happened" is impossible, and some error inevitable, the standard of proof is a way to influence "the relative frequency of . . erroneous outcomes." 397 U.S. at 370-7I. If an incorrect decision is made by a civil factfinder, Justice Harlan reasoned, the state's interests are neutral between a decision in favor of one party or the other, and hence a standard of "more likely than not," which advantages neither party, is satisfactory to the state. If the state does have a special interest in whether a factfinder errs on behalf of the civil plaintiff or defendant -as it may have, for example, in a land title case -it may stack the deck for the benefit of the favored party by shifting the burden of proof, or increasing the requisite de- gree of persuasion. Cf. Woodby v. Immigration &amp; Naturalization Service, 385 U.S. 276, 285 &amp; n.i8 (i966). In every criminal case, however, society recognizes that it is far worse to convict an innocent man than to let a guilty man go free, and the reasonable doubt standard seeks to assure that erroneous acquittals of the guilty will be far more common than erroneous convictions of the innocent. See generally Kaplan, Decision Theory and the Factfinding Process, 20 STAN. L. REV. IO65, IO69-77 (I968). The difficulty with this rationale is that it proves too little. It shows only that the state must prove its case more convincingly than a civil plaintiff; it does not demonstrate how much more convincingly. Mr. Justice Harlan's purposes could be achieved as well by placing the lesser standard of "clear and convincing evi- dence" upon the state as by demanding that it produce a "subjective state of certi- tude." See In re Agler, i9 Ohio St. 2d 70, 80-83, 249 N.E.2d 8o8, 8I4-i6 (I969) (adopting a "clear and convincing evidence" test in a juvenile proceeding because such a proceeding falls somewhere between a civil and criminal proceeding); cf. Woodby v. Immigration &amp; Naturalization Service, 385 U.S. 276, 284-86 (i966) (deportation proceeding). See generally McBaine, Burden of Proof: Degrees of Belief, 32 CALIF. L. REV. 242 (I 944). Under Mr. Justice Harlan's reasoning, the choice of a standard of proof for varying types of adjudications reflects an assessment of the comparative social costs of erroneous outcomes. 397 U.S. at 370. It could be argued that concentration upon a comparison of outcomes ignores the impact on society of the very process for imposing criminal sanctions.

If</page><page sequence="158">I970] THE SUPREME COURT, 1969 TERM I59 The Court's requirement that the state prove beyond a reasonable doubt all facts necessary to constitute the crime avoids any definition of the necessary "facts." Winship's even- tual impact may turn on the extent to which courts will insist that some specific fact, for example sanity, is a necessary ele- ment of a crime,14 and therefore will hold that the state cannot escape the reasonable doubt standard by calling the negative (insanity) an affirmative defense to be proven by the defendant.'5 While courts do exercise some control over the definition of crimes,'6 they may be reluctant to usurp the legislative function of defining the substantive elements of a criminal violation.'7 outcomes alone are balanced, society might be willing, in contexts analogous to the criminal law, to condemn individuals for the greater good, while doubt re- mained as to their guilt; but emphasis on the moral implications of such action has suggested a contrary result to at least one commentator. Compare Mitchell, Bail Reform and the Constitutionality of Pretrial Detention, 55 VA L. REV. I223, I232-35 (I969), with Tribe, supra, at 385-90. 14The argument would presumably be based on a court's notion of "fairness" or perhaps on the cruel and unusual punishment clause. Cf. Robinson v. California, 370 U.S. 66o (I962). See generally Fletcher, Two Kinds of Legal Rules: A Com- parative Study of Burden-of-Persuasion Practices in Criminal Cases, 77 YALE L.J. 88o (I968). 15 Many states presently place the burden of proving such a defense upon the defendant, see Comment, Insanity -The Burden of Proof, 30 LA. L. REV. II7, II7-I8 n.i (I969), and these laws have been held constitutional. See Leland v. Oregon, 343 U.S. 790 (I952). But cf. People ex rel. Juhan v. District Court, i65 CoIo. 253, 439 P.2d 74I (I968) (placing burden of proof for sanity on defendant violates state due process). 16Legislatures, for example, may not define a crime without any reference to action, see Robinson v. California, 370 U.S. 66o (I962), nor may the definition of a crime be so vague as to present no guidance for those seeking to comply, see generally Note, The Void-for-Vagueness Doctrine in the Supreme Court, IO9 U. PA. L. REV. 67 (I960). 17 Cf. Powell v. Texas, 392 U.S. 5I4, 53I-37 (I968) (Marshall, J., speaking for four Justices) (refusal to interfere with legislative determination making public drunkenness a crime even for chronic alcoholics). Some commentators have argued that affirmative defenses could be found in- valid on narrow, procedural grounds. Thus, it might be maintained that the state, by allowing the affirmative defense of insanity, had already defined the negative -sanity -as an essential element of the crime, and that having done so, it may not then adopt the procedure of allocating to the defendant the burden of proving that fact. See generally Ashford &amp; Risinger, Presumptions, Assumptions, and Due Process in Criminal Cases: A Theoretical Overview, 79 YALE L.J. I65, I86-93 (I969). The legislature may not have decided, however, that the negative was essential to the crime, but only that a defendant, though guilty, should be allowed to avoid criminal punishment for reasons considered extraneous to the elements deemed sufficient for the crime. Forced to choose between either defining the crime to include that element or eliminating the affirmative defense altogether, the legislature might decide to eliminate the defense. A court not prepared to deny the legislature that power can hardly deny it the intermediate alternative of placing upon the accused the risk of nonpersuasion with respect to the fact in question.</page><page sequence="159">i6o HARVARD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 84:I The Court applied the reasonable doubt standard to the adjudicatory stage of a juvenile proceeding,18 reasoning that the same interests which justified the criminal standard for adults also applied to youths,"9 and that there were no state interests outweighing the benefits a youth could derive from the criminal standard. In re Gault 20 had already disposed of the state's as- serted rationale that an adjudication of delinquency was bene- ficial rather than punitive, and that it lacked "criminal" consequences.2' The Court in Winship then seemed to place upon the state the burden of demonstrating that application of the crim- inal protection would harm particular beneficial aspects of the juvenile process, and the Court found no such harm. A higher standard of proof would have no impact on the allegedly beneficial aspects of the system such as the flexibility of the pre-judicial and post-adjudicative stages. Nor would it force New York to charac- terize a finding of juvenile delinquency as a "criminal" conviction, or to impose any civil disabilities. With respect to the factfinding hearing itself, a higher standard of proof would not affect its confidentiality, informality, flexibility, or speed. The decision was consequently an easier one than Gault, where the Court imposed restrictions upon the adjudicatory hearing - such as the right to counsel and confrontation, and the privilege against self-incrimination -which arguably did encumber the hearing with the inappropriate trappings of an adversary proceeding. In Winship the Court could have drawn a bold line, finding that the consequences of a determination of juvenile delinquency were sufficiently punitive to warrant imposing all criminal safe- guards at the adjudicatory hearing.22 But by using a due process 18 Though some states did require a criminal standard of proof in juvenile pro- ceedings, most states considered the proceedings civil and applied only a preponder- ance test. See cases cited at 397 U.S. at 36o-6i n.3; Cohen, supra note io, at 585; Note, Juvenile Delinquents: The Police, State Courts, and Individualized Justice, 79 HARV. L. REV. 775, 795 (i966). 19 By this reasoning courts could apply to juveniles any protection afforded an adult defendant which has been incorporated against the states by the four- teenth amendment, since the Court will have determined already that the safe- guard is "necessary to an Anglo-American regime of ordered liberty." See Duncan v. Louisiana, 39I U.S. I45, I49-50 n.I4 (I968). 20 387 U.S. i (I967), noted in The Supreme Court, I966 Term, 8i HARV. L.

United States, 280 F. Supp. 994, I003-05 (S.D.N.Y. i968); or, if fewer protections were to be imposed, what standards a</page><page sequence="160">I970] THE SUPREME COURT, I969 TERM I6I balancing analysis 23 it limited the decision to the single issue of the standard of proof and left open the possibility that it might not apply other protections which would hamper the informality, flexibility, or speed of the factfinding hearing.24 In an attempt to preserve these attributes of the juvenile proceeding, the Court might deny, for example, a right to jury trial for youths for fear of rigidifying the hearing.25 The presence of a jury arguably might transform the idealistically conceived fatherly juvenile court judge into a cold arbiter, aware that any favoritism in his rulings and attitude might unduly influence the jury and result in an erroneous factual determination.26 Nevertheless, procedural informality in the adjudicatory stage -the factor which the Court implied could be balanced against the benefit to the youth from a criminal safeguard -is an un- court should use in selecting the applicable rights. See Dorsen &amp; Rezneck, supra note I2, at io-ii. 23 The Court's decision in Winship, as well as in Gault, to use due process rather than equal protection analysis may have been based on a foreboding that an equal protection approach would obliterate all distinctions between juvenile and criminal proceedings. But, if there are indeed aspects of the juvenile system which are beneficial to the youth, the preservation of such benefits would provide a rational reason for the restriction of a criminal protection. Yet under strict scrutiny - a test which the Court might apply because of the nature of the youth's interests which are involved -such restrictions might not in fact be sustainable. 24 In a footnote the Court underscored the narrowness of its holding: (i) it dealt only with the adjudicatory stage of the juvenile proceeding and expressed no comment on either the pre-judicial or dispositional stages; (2) it expressed no view on New York's procedures governing children "in need of supervision," who are not stigmatized by classification as juvenile delinquents, but whose freedom is nevertheless restricted even though they have not been convicted of a criminal offense; see N.Y. FAMILY CT.

The purpose of the adjudicatory stage is, after all, to determine whether a youth is a proper object for what Gault acknowledged would be punitive rather than beneficial treatment. To the extent that informality, operat- ing through an absence of criminal safeguards, makes conviction of the youth less difficult, it can hardly be said that such in- formality is beneficial to him.27 The need to preserve these so-called benefits of informality should not be raised as a justifi- cation for refusing to apply criminal safeguards.28 In Winship, as well as Gault, the Court carefully isolated the adjudicatory stage from both the pretrial and dispositional stages, refusing to comment on the application of the relevant criminal safeguards in those areas. Flexibility and experimenta- tion in these areas, in contrast to the adjudicatory stage, may make possible the disposition most beneficial for the youth, and consequently best fulfill the purposes of the juvenile court system. In the pre-judicial stage, for example, such flexibility might allow the police or other government agencies, through consulta- tion and cooperation with the youth and his parents, to resolve the case without adjudging him a delinquent; and in the disposi- tional stage it could be used to provide individualized, non- punitive treatment.29 On the other hand, the Court may eventually find that flexibility in these non-adjudicatory stages is used not to resolve the case without trial to the youth's advantage, but rather to improve the chances for prosecutorial success or to impose penalties harsher than those which could be meted out to an adult.30 An unfulfilled promise of nonprosecu- tion or more humane treatment should not be allowed to provide 27 The questionable psychological gain to a child from experiencing an informal procedure cannot compensate for his increased risk of criminal punishment.

See In re D., 3i0 N.Y.S.2d 82, 89 (App. Div. 1970): We can find no constitutionally sufficient reason to deprive a juvenile of a jury trial when he is faced with a possibility of incarceration of more than one year because of his criminal acts.

Despite Gault's warning against use of the " 'civil' label-of-convenience," 33 courts have continued to use the term "civil" to avoid requiring the criminal standard of proof in commitment proceedings - for alcoholics, sexual psycopaths, the mentally ill, and narcotics addicts.34 Yet the effect of each of these proceedings may be no less detrimental than a finding of juvenile delinquency.35 They restrict an individual's freedom and permanently harm his reputation; and in return, what the "patient" receives is all too frequently treatment negligently administered in overcrowded facilities offering little chance of cure.36 Winship may imply that the state should impose such burdens on an individual only after the factfinder has reached a subjective certitude that the subject is one of a class whom the law has defined as in need of this "treatment." 37 31 See In re Gault, 387 U.S. I, 22 n.30 (I967). 32 See 397 U.S. at 363-64, 367. 33See In re Gault, 387 U.S. I, 50 (I967). 34 See, e.g., People v.

In mental commitment cases, for example, the state presumably does not intend moral condemnation. Nevertheless, if the state cannot condemn a criminal accused on less than a reasonable doubt standard, it ought not to use a lesser standard to place an individual in what in fact will be the equivalent situation.

The result in these proceedings turns on a determination of present status, such as "mental illness" or "in need of care and treatment," or a prediction of future conduct, such as "danger" to self or others.38 Such judgments seem less susceptible to certainty than decisions determining whether an individual has committed certain proscribed acts, which is the central issue in both juvenile delinquency proceedings and criminal trials. But the amorphous and subjective nature of the terms used in civil commitment statutes allows the factfinder to give enormous weight to his own personal judgments and those of the doctors who testify. "Dangerousness," for example, encompasses a risk of harm, but in no way specifies what type or degree of harm is intended, nor the probability which must be established.39 Thus, it would not be anomalous for a fact- finder to believe without any doubt that a person was "dangerous" while still in doubt whether he would commit any specific harm if released.40 If the legislature defined the specific type and degree of harm which would justify commitment, however, and the prediction of the patient's future conduct had to be made on the basis of the criminal standard of proof, the possible scope of commitment would indeed be reduced. The factfinder would be unable to impose his own conceptions of the unacceptable risks to society which make an individual dangerous.41 He would have to be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the person would commit acts, such as infliction of bodily injury, encompassed by the statute. Without a blanket concept such as "dangerous- ness," such certainty could be achieved only in those few cases where a patient's clearly identifiable medical disorders and un- guilty by reason of insanity and committed to mental institution, must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he is not a danger to the public before he can be released). 38 See generally Dershowitz, The Psychiatrist's Power in Civil Commitment, PSYCHOLOGY TODAY 43 (Feb.

Medical testimony that an individual is "dangerous" subsumes the doctor's views on the degree, kind, and probability of harm which society should bear. 41 Psychiatrists would also be unable to "overprotect" society as they presently do, see Dershowitz, supra note 38, at 47, by testifying that patients are "danger- ous" even though the conclusion may be based on simply a better than even chance of trivial harm.</page><page sequence="164">I970] THE SUPREME COURT, 1969 TERM I65 controllable impulses left no reasonable doubt as to his future conduct.42 5. Rigkt to Twelve-Man Jury; Constitutionality of Pretrial Prosecutorial Discovery. - In Williams v. Florida 1 the Supreme Court jettisoned the twelve-man jury requirement and may have removed a significant constitutional obstacle to expanded criminal discovery. Arrested for robbery, petitioner Johnny Williams filed a pretrial motion to impanel a twelve-man jury instead of the six-man jury provided by Florida in all but capital cases.2 He also moved for a protective order to excuse him from a Florida rule I which requires a defendant who plans to present an alibi defense to give the prosecuting attorney advance notice of the place where he claims to have been, and the names and addresses of the alibi witnesses he intends to call. Both motions were denied, and Williams was subsequently convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment. Following an unsuccessful state court appeal,4 the Supreme Court affirmed in an opinion announced by Mr. Justice White, upholding both the six-man jury and notice- of-alibi rules.5 Underlying the Court's six-man jury ruling was its I968 de- cision in Duncan v. Louisiana 6 that the fourteenth amendment incorporates the sixth amendment right to jury trial and applies it to the states. The validity of the Florida rule would therefore have to be measured against the requirements of the sixth amend- ment, which speaks of an "impartial jury" but provides no explicit rule on jury size. Nevertheless, the Court had previously relied on the supposed intent of the framers to hold that a jury of fewer than twelve would not satisfy the sixth amendment.7 The records 42 See Note, supra note 39, at II82. 1 399 U.S. 78 (I970). 2See FLA.

Utah, I70 U.S. 343, 349-50 (I898), the Court first announced that for the purposes of the sixth amendment a jury was one "constituted, as it was at common law, of twelve persons, neither more nor less." The Court has subsequently referred to the twelve-man requirement as one of the "essential ele- ments" of the jury right, the destruction of which would "abridg[e] the right in contravention of the Constitution." Patton v. United States, 28I U.S. 276, 288, 290 (I930).</page><page sequence="165">i66 HARVARD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 84:I of the constitutional convention 8 and the drafting of the Bill of Rights, admittedly sparse on the question of jury size,9 suggest that the framers intended no departure from the definition of a jury at common law,10 which, since the fourteenth century, had known no other jury than one of twelve." But refusing to rely on either history or precedent, the Court in Williams demanded a purpose or rationale for fixing the jury at precisely twelve. Find- ing none,"2 it held that a jury of six constituted under the Florida rule was indeed a "jury" within the meaning of the sixth amend- ment. Despite the absence of any apparent rationale for the number twelve, it does not follow that the size of the jury has no signifi- cance. The jury serves to protect the accused from oppression either by the prosecution or a biased judge,'3 and the size of the jury is relevant to the performance of that protective function."4 Thus, the possibility of jury bias against defendant is increased when he is a member of a minority group unrepresented in the jury room; 15 as the number of jurors increases, it becomes more likely that at least one representative of defendant's minority group will be on a given jury, at least in the absence of systematic discrimination in juror selection. Moreover, in view of the una- nimity requirement, the defendant can escape conviction if even one juror doubts his guilt, and he is more likely to find such a juror when the jury's size is large. While a twelve-man jury would afford the accused greater protection than a six-man jury and more fully accomplish the purpose behind the jury-trial right, it is also true that an even larger jury - with perhaps twenty-five or fifty jurors - would afford still greater protection. Yet the state has a substantial in- terest in minimizing the size of the jury since costs are likely to rise in direct proportion to the number of jurors. Furthermore, increasing the jury size would produce a concomitant increase in 8 The requirement of a jury trial for criminal cases is also expressed in Article III. See U.S. CONST. art.

And as the number of jurors in- creases, so does the likelihood that one juror will be irrationally biased in favor of defendant, or susceptible to jury tampering. In short, the number of jurors must reflect a compromise be- tween the interests of the defendant and of the state. Faced with a legislative decision to compromise at six, the Court was unwill- ing to say that twelve jurors was the lowest number which would satisfy the defendant's interests, perhaps concluding that such a line was too fine and arbitrary for judges to draw 17 and that the legislature should therefore be permitted to formulate the com- promise. Nevertheless, the Court in no way avoided the need to draw an arbitrary line, but merely postponed the unpleasant task.18 For as it explicitly recognized, there is some risk that a legislature would establish a compromise at so low a number that the right to jury trial would be effectively vitiated.'9 But it post- poned for a future case the decision whether six was as low as a state could go. What is troubling about the Court's opinion is not so much its result as its approach. The majority did not even suggest a reason for lowering the requirement from twelve down at least as far as six, but rested instead on a questionable critique of the reasons for holding the line at twelve. It thus seems clear that the Court had placed on the defendant the burden of going for- ward with evidence to justify the twelve-man rule, instead of allocating to the state the burden of demonstrating a need to depart from precedent and previous understanding. In contrast to the majority's approach, Mr. Justice Harlan argued that in view of the ancient compromise hammered out by the common law, the almost universal acceptance at the time the Constitu- tion was adopted, and continued widespread use throughout the country, the twelve-man requirement should not be discarded absent a showing that it was "either practically . . . or jurispru- dentially . . . unworkable, or no longer suited to contemporary life . . n 20 In its defense of the six-man rule, Florida had not even purported to make such a showing.2- "6Cf.

In applying this doctrine the Court has required the states to follow a federal rule, and has not considered any of the problems which may confront a particular state.23 Williams suggests that incorporation may be a two-edged sword, capable of slicing at federal practices just as it has in the past sliced at state practices. Recognizing, perhaps, that the states need flexibility to meet the jury trial requirement imposed by Duncan, the Court held that twelve-man juries were not constitutionally required in state trials. But because the incorporation doctrine has bound together the state and federal rules, the change in the state rule has apparently produced an automatic change in the federal right.24 There are, after all, substantial and obvious differences be- tween the state and federal governments in terms of their respec- tive abilities to provide juries of twelve. The federal courts are not confronted with the same volume of criminal trials as are state courts,25 and the federal government may have more re- 22 See generally Mapp v.

New York, 399 U.S. 66 (1970), holding that the states must grant jury trials in all cases where the maximum authorized punishment is imprisonment for more than six months. At the time of Baldwin, New York City was the only jurisdiction in the nation which did not afford a jury trial for such offenses. Nevertheless, it is arguable that New York City, with its high popula- tion concentration and high per capita frequency of misdemeanors, would be better served by a different rule. See 399 U.S. at 77 (Burger, C.J., dissenting) ; id. at I34-36 (Harlan, J., concurring and dissenting). 24 The twelve-man jury rule for federal trials is expressed in FED. R. CRIM. P. 23, enacted before the Williams decision. The Court did not explicitly hold that this federal rule is no longer constitutionally required, but that conclusion seems to follow from the Court's approach. Cf. 399 U.S. at I22 (Harlan, J., concurring and dissenting). First, the Court dismissed the argument that the framers intended the federal jury trial requirement to comprehend a requirement of twelve jurors. 399 U.S. at 99. Second, the precedents which the Court effectively overruled involved the federal jury right. See, e.g., Thompson v. Utah, 170 U.S. 343 (I898). Third, the doctrine of selective incorporation is commonly thought to apply to the states the precise federal right, and not a watered-down version of it. See, e.g., Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U.S. i, io-ii (i964). But see note 26 infra. 25See Friendly, supra note 22, at 936 n.40, pointing out that in i963 the Su- preme Court and County Courts of New York handled the cases of ig,888 crim- inal defendants, and the state's lowest courts handled an additional 452,27I felonies</page><page sequence="168">I970] THE SUPREME COURT, 1969 TERM I69 sources available to provide larger juries. Yet whatever the force of these distinctions, the Court need not have faced the question but for the doctrine of incorporation.26 The Court's decision in Williams calls into question another element of the jury right that had long been held essential.27 If a six-man jury is sufficient to convict a defendant, then it might be argued that a less than unanimous verdict, say seven to five, is permissible 28 because conviction would be deemed appropriate by more jurors than voted to condemn Williams. But although the unanimity requirement has been frequently criticized for giving undue weight to the stubborn juror 29 and facilitating jury tampering,30 it is nevertheless central to the effective preservation of the jury's primary function, and not an ornamental vestige of the common law. The requirement promotes full debate in the jury room,3' lending force to all minority viewpoints, and and misdemeanors. During approximately the same period, the federal district courts in New York disposed of i,8i6 criminal cases. 26 It might be possible, of course, to maintain the doctrine of selective incor- poration without applying every aspect of the federal right to the states. Thus, even though the jury right is considered fundamental and therefore applicable to the states, see Duncan v. Louisiana, 39I U.S. I45 (i968), it is not clear why all the "bag and baggage" of the federal right must also be considered essential. See Bloom v. Illinois, 391 U.S. I94, 213 (i968) (Fortas, J., concurring) ("the tail [should not] go with the hide"). 27 See, e.g., 'Patton v. United States 28i U.S. 276, 288 (1930). See also Hogan, Joseph Story on Juries, 37 ORE. L. REV. 234, 254 (I958). The requirement has been criticized by one former Supreme Court Justice, see Miller, The System of Trial by Jury, 2i AM. L. REV. 859 (I887), and numerous commentators, see, e.g., Comment, Less Than Unanimous Jury Verdicts in Criminal Trials, 58 J. CRIM. L.C. &amp; P.S. 2II (I967). The requirement does have many adherents, however. See, e.g., Hogan, supra, at 254; Comment, Should Jury Verdicts Be Unanimous in Criminal Cases?, 47 ORE. L. REV. 4I7 (I968). 28The constitutions of several states already provide for less than unanimous verdicts in certain felony cases. See LA. CONST. art. VII, ? 4I (three-fourths needed to convict); ORE. CONST. art. I, ? ii (five-sixths). The constitutions of four other states provide for a less than unanimous verdict in all misdemeanor cases. See IDAHO CONST. art. I, ? 7 (five-sixths); MONT. CONST. art. III, ? 23 (two-thirds); OKLA. CONST. art. II, ? i9 (three-fourths); TEX. CONST. art. V, ? 13 (three-fourths). In addition, one circuit has held that the due process clause does not require unanimity. See Fournier v. Gonzalez, 269 F.2d 26 (ist Cir. 1959). 29 One statistical study has suggested that the problem of hung juries is not very great. Only 5.6% of the cases studied in which a unanimous verdict was required resulted in a hung jury. A rule permitting a less than unanimous verdict would reduce this figure only to 3.1%. See H. KALVEN, JR. &amp; H. ZEISEL, THE AMERICAN JURY 46I (I966). In any case, the possibility of a hung jury and new trial affords defendant an important protection. Huffman v.

It also has an important role in insuring that conviction is predicated on proof beyond a reasonable doubt.32 Thus, the viability of the unanimity require- ment is in no sense controlled by either the Williams holding or approach.33 In upholding Florida's notice-of-alibi provision,34 which re- quires defendant to disclose his proposed alibi witnesses and permits the prosecution to depose them,35 the Court may have signalled the expansion of criminal discovery in federal as well as state trials. The application of the fifth amendment self- incrimination clause has been the primary issue in the controversy over the permissible scope of federal criminal discovery.36 At present, rule i6 (c) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure permits limited discovery by the prosecution, but the govern- ment's right is conditioned on defendant's decision to use dis- covery. The defendant's decision is seen as a waiver of his privi- lege against self-incrimination to the extent of permitting the government some limited reciprocal discovery.37 A proposed amendment to the rule 38 would grant the prosecution an inde- pendent, though limited, discovery right,39 including the right to obtain discovery of defense witnesses 40 and the results of certain minimum deliberation period. See, e.g., NEB. REV. STAT. ? 25-II25 (I964) (civil cases: six hours). 32See Hibdon v. United States, 204 F.2d 834, 838 (6th Cir. i953). But see Fournier v. Gonzalez, 269 F.2d 26 (Ist Cir. I959). 33In DeStefano v. Woods, 392 U.S. 63I (i968), the Court was asked to decide whether the unanimity requirement is an essential element of a state jury trial. But it failed to reach the question when it decided that Duncan was not retro- active. 34 Sixteen states, including Florida, have notice-of-alibi provisions. See 399 U.S. at 82 n.ii. 35 In turn, the prosecution must supply a list of the witnesses it plans to use to rebut the alibi. 36 See, e.g., 2 L.

Since the Florida alibi rule requires a similar disclosure of witnesses, and since this disclosure is not conditioned on any corresponding defense discovery, Williams would seem to indi- cate the Court's readiness to accept at least part of the proposed amendment. The Florida rule is, of course, much narrower in scope than the proposed federal rule. It requires the defendant to disclose only his alibi witnesses, and in view of the special characteristics of an alibi defense -it can be easily manufac- tured, sprung as a surprise, and verified or disproved more easily than most defenses 41 - the Florida rule may produce greater savings of time and effort than most discovery procedures.42 Nevertheless, the Court's rationale in Williams cannot easily be limited. The Court implicitly rejected Justice Black's con- ception of the self-incrimination clause as a bar to the state's use of the coerced assistance of defendant,43 a conception which would have precluded any independent discovery of the defend- ant. Furthermore, the Court resolved the fifth amendment prob- lem by arguing that the notice-of-alibi rule merely "accelerate[s] the timing of [a defendant's] disclosure." 4 In some cases, to be sure, the time differential would seem crucial, since the de- fendant may have to reach a decision on disclosure without any knowledge of the prosecution's case and its weaknesses.45 But, as the Court specifically noted, the Florida rules permit ex- tensive pretrial discovery by the defendant.46 Since the defendant can thus obtain before trial considerable information about the prosecution's case, the significance of the timing differential is effectively mitigated. If the extent of defendant's right of dis- covery was, in fact, the key to the Court's discovery holding, then Williams does represent an important victory for the advo- cates of increased criminal discovery, and a sign that the present Court will probably uphold the proposed amendment to rule I6. reciprocity, however, as the names and addresses of government witnesses may be withheld if the prosecuting attorney certifies that disclosure "may subject the witness or others to physical or substantial economic harm or coercion."

Bernhard,' the Court extended the seventh amendment right to a jury trial to a substantial class of shareholder deriva- tive suits. Petitioners brought a derivative suit for money dam- ages and other relief against the directors of their closed-end investment company and the company's investment brokers. They demanded a jury trial on the corporation's claims against the defendants for conflicts of interest in connection with the payment of excessive commissions to the brokers. The district court denied defendants' motion to strike petitioners' jury trial demand,2 but was reversed by the court of appeals which held that since a derivative action is wholly equitable in nature, a jury is not constitutionally required to try any part of it.3 The Supreme Court reversed, 5-3, holding that the seventh amendment guaran- tees a jury trial of those issues in a derivative suit as to which the Constitution would have required a jury if the corporation had brought the action itself.4 Mr. Justice White, writing for the Court, based his opinion on the holding of Beacon Theatres, Inc. v. Westover 5 and Dairy Queen, Inc. v. Wood 6 that the right to a jury trial depends on the nature of the issue to be tried rather than on the procedural framework in which it is raised. In order to fit Ross into the factual context of Beacon Theatres and Dairy Queen, each of which involved two historically separable causes of action,7 he argued that a derivative suit should be viewed as having a dual '396 U.S. 53I (I970). 2 275 F.

Co., 323 F.2d 826 (gth Cir. i963), cert. denied, 376 U.S. 950 (i964), the Ninth Circuit held that a stockholder was entitled to a jury trial when his claims, "if asserted by the corporation, would be cognizable in a suit at common law." 323 F.2d at 836.

Fox brought an action seeking declaratory relief and an injunction barring Beacon from instituting any antitrust action against it. Beacon filed a counter-claim, alleging violation of the antitrust laws and asking for treble damages. The Supreme Court held that Beacon's counter-claim, which was legal in nature, had to be tried first. In Dairy Queen, the owners. of the trademark "DAIRY QUEEN" brought an action alleging that the defendant had breached its contract for exclusive use of the trademark. They sought several types of relief, including an injunction and</page><page sequence="172">I970] THE SUPREME COURT, 1969 TERM I73 nature.8 Only the first issue, whether the shareholder has stand- ing to sue on behalf of the corporation, is equitable; the nature of the second issue, the corporation's claim, depends on whether that claim is legal or equitable. Believing that the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure eliminated any procedural obstacles to trans- ferring jurisdiction to law once standing was establishing in equi- ty, Justice White could see no reason to preserve the pre-merger rule that equity should retain jurisdiction over the corporate claim. Mr. Justice Stewart, dissenting, objected that under the Court's analysis the seventh amendment and the federal rules "magically interact" 9 to enlarge the right to a jury trial in a way which neither intended. He disputed the Court's argument that a derivative action has historically been viewed as having a dual nature. He was thus able to distinguish the derivative suit, which he believed to be a unitary equitable form of action, from the suits in Beacon Theatres and Dairy Queen. Viewing this distinc- tion as decisive, he concluded that Ross was a much more radical departure from the "historical test" of the right to a jury trial "' than any of the Court's previous decisions, and that the departure had no justification other than an "overpowering bias in favor of jury trials." " While the language of Beacon Theatres and Dairy Queen spoke uncompromisingly of the jury trial right depending on the nature of the issue detached from its procedural context,'2 the an accounting for money damages. The Supreme Court held that, even though the claim for legal relief was incidental to the equitable relief sought, the seventh amendment required that the issues pertaining to that legal relief be tried to a jury, because the primary rights being adjudicated -breach of contract -were legal in character. ' The Court relied on Koster v. Lumbermen's Mut. Cas. Co., 330 U.S. 5I8, 522-23 (I947), where Justice Jackson stated, in a different connection: [The cause of action which the plaintiff brings in a derivative suit] is not his own but the corporation's. It is the real party in interest and he is allowed to act in protection of its interest . . . because it *is disabled from protecting itself. See generally Prunty, The Shareholders' Derivative Suit: Notes on Its Derivation, 32 N.Y.U.L. REV. 980 (I957). 9396 U.S. at 543. 10 For an example of the strictly historical approach to defining the right to jury trial, see Beacon Theatres, Inc. v. Westover, 359 U.S. 500, 5I1-I9 (1959) (Stewart, J., dissenting). 11396 U.S. at 55I. 12 "[O]nly under the most imperative circumstances, circumstances which in view of the flexible procedures of the Federal Rules we cannot now anticipate, can the right to a jury trial of legal issues be lost through prior determination of equi- table claims."

The Court</page><page sequence="173">I74 HARVARD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 84:I facts of the cases suggested that this broad language might be applicable only to cases which, before merger, a court of equity might have transferred to a law court had the I938 procedures then been in effect.'3 Both cases involved suits in which, even prior to merger, the issues concerning legal rights and relief were cognizable in a court of law, and could have been brought in such a court if certain procedural reforms had been implemented or if equity had been willing to surrender jurisdiction. The Federal Rules had eliminated for both cases the procedural obstacles responsible for the inadequacy of legal relief or the impracticabil- ity of transfer.14 Ross involved a quite different situation. The claim presented in a derivative suit, a shareholder seeking relief on the basis of the corporate claim, was not one which historically was cogniza- ble in a court of law.15 While the derivative suit displays a "dual nature," it does not involve separable claims. In contrast to Bea- con Theatres in which a distinct legal remedy became adequate after the case had been brought in equity, in a derivative suit legal relief could never become possible. Nor was law's refusal to hear derivative actions necessarily based on the procedural complexity of the issues as it was in Dairy Queen. Rather, it seems to have been based on law's traditional refusal to permit one person to enforce the legal rights of another.'6 This reluc- tance might have been grounded in a fear that the complexity and confusion inherent in permitting one person to litigate the rights of another made such litigation inappropriate for a jury. But it might also have been based on some notion of the limited substantive role of the common law. The Court's failure, then, to conduct the sort of extensive historical inquiry that would have been required to bring Ross in Dairy Queen further stated that a plaintiff seeking essentially legal relief for breach of a legal duty could not deprive the defendant of a jury trial by fitting the action into equitable forms. Id. at 470-7I.

Westover, ii6 U. PA. L. REV. I, I2-I7 (i967). '4 In Dairy Queen, for example, the Court found that money damages were a legal remedy even when they necessitated an accounting. This finding was based on the view that the reason law had originally refused to render an accounting was that it would have been beyond the capabilities of a jury to look into complicated business records and that this reason was obviated by FED.

This broad reading of Beacon Theatres considerably con- stricts the scope of equity jurisdiction and correspondingly broadens the constitutional right to a jury trial. As an abstract proposition, therefore, it may seem inconsistent with the ex- pressed intent of the seventh amendment 19 and the Federal Rules 20 to preserve in the merged system the two jurisdictions as they previously existed. Nevertheless, it is certainly under- standable that the Court has become impatient with having to continue to apply archaic rules of common law jurisdiction that no longer have any procedural justification,21 and which, even origi- 17 Although the Court referred at length to the history of derivative actions, a close examination of that historical analysis negatives the impression that the Court was carefully applying Beacon Theatres to the facts in Ross. The Court's analysis focuses entirely on the issue of whether the derivative suit may realistically be divided into two parts, one equitable and one legal; it makes no attempt to divine the reasons why equity retained jurisdiction over the legal issues after standing was established. See 396 U.S. at 534-40. Instead, the Court jumped directly from the dual nature of derivative actions to its conclusion that, "The historical rule preventing a court of law from entertaining a shareholder's suit on behalf of the corporation is obsolete." Id. at 540. 18 Justice White explicitly pointed to three other traditionally equitable actions to which a right to a jury trial will inhere when legal claims are being adjudicated. He cited approvingly, 396 U.S. at 540-4I, decisions of lower federal courts holding that there is a right to a jury trial on legal issues raised via such traditionally equitable devices as interpleader, see, e.g., Pan American Fire &amp; Cas. Co. v. Revere, i88 F. Supp. 474 (E.D. La. ig60), intervention, see, e.g., United States ex rel. Browne &amp; Bryan Lumber Co. v. Massachusetts Bonding &amp; Ins. Co., 303 F.2d 823 (2d Cir. i962), and class actions, see, e.g., Montgomery Ward &amp; Co. v. Langer, i68 F.2d I82 (8th Cir. I948). 19 "In Suits at common law, where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved ...." U.S. CONST. amend.

MOORE, FEDERAL PRACTICE ff 38.07(I) (2d ed.

The test itself suggests the limitation which Justice White specified: 25 when the remedy sought is equitable in nature, such as an injunction or specific performance, there is still no right to a jury trial. Thus, the traditional remedial perquisites of the equity jurisdic- tion are still intact after Ross.26 action. The Court's strong language clearly conveys the source of its impatience, 396 U.S. at 540: The historical rule preventing a court of law from entertaining a share- holder's suit on behalf of the corporation is obsolete; it is no longer tenable for a district court, administering both law and equity in the same action, to deny legal remedies to a corporation, merely because the corporation's spokesmen are its shareholders rather than its directors. Under the rules, law and equity are procedurally combined; nothing turns now upon the form of the action or the procedural devices by which the parties happen to come before the court. 22See I J. POMEROY, supra note I6, ?? I5-I7, at I9-24. 23 Having opted for an easily administrable rule, the Court was probably right to choose one likely to err on the side of expanding the right to a jury trial rather than one likely to narrowly circumscribe that right. It is the right to trial by jury, not to trial by the court, that is constitutionally protected. See Beacon Theatres, Inc. v. Westover, 359 U.S. 500, 5Io (1959); McCoid, supra note I3, at I4-I5. But cf. Henderson, The Background of the Seventh Amendment, 8o HARV. L. REV. 289, 289-9I (I966). The Court's pro-jury bias reflects a general systemic preference for jury trial based, perhaps, on the fundamental assumption that jury trial is a desirable form of fact-finding in a democratic society. Cf. McCoid, supra note I3, at I5. This systemic preference seems absent in England where only 2.27% of the total number of civil actions tried in London and only 0.I77% of those tried on Assize were tried to a jury. JUDICIAL STATSTICS, ENGLAND AND WALES, I969: CIVIL JUDICIAL STATISTCS I3 (1970). The bias may also lack any functional basis. See Note, supra note 4, at 737 n.32. 24 Justice Stewart wrote, 396 U.S. at 549-50: If history is to be so cavalierly dismissed, the derivative suit can, of course, be artificially broken down into separable elements. But so then can any traditionally equitable cause of action, and the logic of the Court's position would lead to the virtual elimination of all equity jurisdiction. An equitable suit for an injunction, for instance, often involves issues of fact which, if damages had been sought, would have been triable to a jury. 25396 U.S. at 538 n.io. 26 The Court mentioned two other limitations. One is "the pre-merger custom with reference to such questions." Id. In view of the Court's cavalier use of his- tory, it is rather difficult to comprehend the meaning of this term. The most ob- vious possibility is that the Court intended that equity should continue to exercise jurisdiction in cases adjudicating primary rights which are equitable in nature, such as a suit to enforce a trust relationship.

FEDERAL STATUTES AND GOVERNMENT REGULATION A. Administrative A ction Standing to Seek Judicial Review of Administrative Action. - In Association of Data Processing Service Organizations, Inc. v. Camp 1 and Barlow v. Collins 2 the Supreme Court relaxed the re- quirements for standing to seek judicial review of administrative action. In Data Processing, an organization composed of sellers of data processing services and one of its members 3 sought judi- cial review of a ruling of the Comptroller of the Currency that national banks could provide data processing services for other banks and bank customers.4 Plaintiffs alleged that the ruling was illegal because it authorized activities beyond the scope of the "incidental powers" clause of the National Bank Act.5 At issue in Barlow was a Department of Agriculture regula- tion allowing farmers to assign federal farm payments to their landlords to secure payment of their cash rent obligations.6 Plain- holders against the corporation's directors, rather than against outsiders, is closely analogous to a beneficiary's suit against his cestui qui trust, see Prunty, supra note 8, at 989, raises doubts as to how carefully the Court will observe even this last remnant of equitable jurisdiction. The Court also suggested that a consideration of "the practical abilities and limitations of juries" should be a factor in defining the scope of the right to jury trial. 396 U.S. at 538 n.io. Besides seeming to make the constitutional right to a jury more discretionary than the Court could possibly have intended, this standard would impose on the courts an impossible task. One commentator writes: "[Ilt is impossible to reach satisfactory conclusions from a functional analysis of the desir- ability of jury trial in civil actions generally or particularly in derivative litigation." Note, supra note 4, at 737 n.52. This being so, the Court's footnote invites visceral decisionmaking based on whether the judge believes that juries lack the sophistica- tion to judge corporate affairs adequately, or, conversely, that a jury's application of common sense notions of fairness is a valuable contribution to evaluating a fiduciary relationship. See generally F. JAMES, CIVIL PROCEDURE 378 (i965). The Court must have realized this, for nowhere in its opinion does the Court consider whether a jury is able to decide complex corporate litigation.

Since the Department of Agriculture limits the f arm- ers to one assignment in any crop year,7 and alternative sources of credit are usually unavailable, the alleged effect of the regula- lation was to require them to finance other farm needs from the landlord as well, at higher prices and less favorable terms than they could obtain elsewhere. Charging that the regulation was un- authorized by the statute permitting the assignment of agricul- tural payments "as security for cash or advances to finance mak- ing a crop," 8 plaintiffs sued on behalf of themselves and other farmers similarly situated for a declaration and injunction. In both cases the lower federal courts dismissed for lack of standing, ruling that plaintiffs had alleged no invasion of a "le- gally protected interest" nor any statutory ground for standing.9 The Supreme Court unanimously reversed. Writing for the ma- jority, Mr. Justice Douglas set forth a two-part test to determine when plaintiffs have standing to obtain judicial review of admin- istrative action. First, the Court held that article III of the Constitution, which restricts justiciable disputes to "Cases" and "Controversies," is satisfied by an allegation that "the challenged action has caused [the plaintiff] injury in fact, economic or other- wise." '" Second, the Court concluded that section io of the (b) To finance making a crop means (i) to finance the planting, cul- tivating, or harvesting of a crop, including . . . the payment of cash rent for land used therefor .... Plaintiffs were receiving payments under the Upland Cotton Program, which provides both for price support payments and for acreage diversion payments to qualified farmers. See Food and Agriculture Act of i965, ? 402(a), 7 U.S.C. ?

Camp, 397 U.S. 150, I52 (I970). The constitutional issues as to standing were not raised in either case. Both plaintiffs alleged distinctive economic injury and thus fell well within the require- ment of Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. i86, 204 (i962), quoted in Flast v. Cohen, 392 U.S. 83, 99 (i968), that plaintiffs must allege "such a personal stake in the out-</page><page sequence="178">I970] THE SUPREME COURT, 1969 TERM I79 Administrative Procedure Act (APA) 11 requires that the interest which the plaintiff seeks to protect be "arguably within the zone of interests to be protected or regulated by the statute . . . in question." 12 Thus the Court rejected the traditional "legally protected interest" test,'3 which required the plaintiff to assert an interest which it was the purpose of a statute, the common law, or the Constitution to protect. Whether such interest actually exists, the Court felt, is a question going to the merits,14 not to the issue of standing. come of the controversy as to assure that concrete adverseness which sharpens the presentation of issues ...." These cases thus provide no further guidance as to the limitations on standing imposed by article III. Since the problems of standing raised by so-called "public actions," in which plaintiffs sue as taxpayers or citizens to vindicate the interest of the general public, were not present in these cases, the Court's use of the test of "injury in fact" is probably to be limited to a holding that such injury is a sufficient rather than a necessary ground of standing under article III. Justice Brennan specifically recog- nized the distinction between the two types of suits and expressed no opinion on the constitutional requirement for standing in a public action. Association of Data Processing Service Organizations, Inc. v. Camp, 397 U.S. 150, I72 n.5 (1970). At least two members of the Court-Justices Douglas and Harlan -have ex- pressed the view that article III is not a barrier to the wider allowance in federal courts of public actions. Flast v. Cohen, 392 U.S. 83, I09, III-I2, I20 (I968). In Flast the Court granted standing to federal taxpayers to challenge federal expendi- tures, but only if they can demonstrate a sufficient link between their status as taxpayers and the expenditure attacked, and can invoke a specific constitutional limitation on the taxing and spending power. The Court has also recognized that persons granted standing by a federal statute as persons "adversely affected" have standing "only as representatives of the public interest." Scripps-Howard Radio, Inc. v. FCC, 3I6 U.S. 4, I4 (1942) (citations omitted). Finally, the Court has undertaken review of cases in which state courts have granted standing to tax- payers to challenge state action on federal constitutional grounds, but only where an increased expenditure of public funds is involved. Compare Everson v. Board of Educ., 330 U.S. I I947), with Doremus v. Board of Educ., 342 U.S. 429, 434 (I952). See generally L. JAFFE, JUDICIAL CONTROL OF ADMINISTRATIVE ACTION 459-500 (I965) [hereinafter cited as JAFFE]. 11 5 U.S.C. ? 702 (Supp. IV, i969). 12 Association of Data Processing Service Organizations, Inc. v. Camp, 397 U.S. I50, I53 (I970) (emphasis added). A third requirement for standing is that judicial review must not have been precluded by Congress. Provisions of the Administra- tive Procedure Act ? io(a), 5 U.S.C. ? 70I(a) (Supp. IV, I969), authorizing judicial review apply "except to the extent that- (i) statutes preclude judicial review; or (2) agency action is commited to agency discretion by law." In Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner, 387 U.S. I36, I40-4I (I967), the Supreme Court held that the APA embodied a "presumption of judicial review" which could be over- come "only upon a showing of 'clear and convincing evidence' of a contrary legis- lative intent . . . ." See also JAFFE 336-59. Applying this principle the Court found no evidence of an intent to preclude review in either Barlow or Data Processing. 13 Cf. Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Comm. v. McGrath, 34I U.S. I23, I40-4I ('95'). 4 Thus, whether the agency's action is in fact illegal and whether the plain-</page><page sequence="179">i8o HARVARD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 84:1 Concurring in the result but dissenting from the Court's treat- ment of the standing question, Mr. Justice Brennan, joined by Mr. Justice White, criticized the Court's test as confusing stand- ing, reviewability, and the merits. In his view, Flast v. Cohen 15 established the existence of a sufficient "personal stake in the outcome" 16 - the requirement of article III - as the sole test of standing for all cases. Yet in making this assertion Mr. Jus- tice Brennan seemingly ignored the fact that the right to judicial review of agency action is governed by a statute -the APA. Furthermore, the concurrence neglects the fact that, much like the majority's test here, the Court in Flast held that it was "nec- essary to look to the substantive issues . . . to determine whether there is a logical nexus between the status asserted and the claim sought to be adjudicated." 17 The second half of the Court's test is based on section io of the APA: 18 A person suffering legal wrong because of agency action, or ad- versely affected or aggrieved by agency action within the mean- ing of a relevant statute, is entitled to judicial review thereof. There has long been disagreement over the proper construction of this section of the Act. Professor Jaffe has argued,'9 and most courts have held,20 that the provision was intended to be merely declaratory of prior law and granted no new rights to judicial review. Thus, prior to Barlow and Data Processing, a plaintiff had to allege either invasion of a "legally protected interest" ("legal wrong") or status as a person "adversely affected" or "aggrieved" within the meaning of a federal statute using such a phrase to grant standing ("relevant statute")."

Nor does the common law or the Constitution protect a person from an increase in competition.23 Plaintiffs could have challenged governmental action inflicting competitive injury only by showing that a statute was intended to protect them from such injury, but the lower courts held that this was not a purpose of the statute cited by the plaintiffs.25 Professor Davis, on the other hand, has contended that the purpose of section io was to grant standing to any person in fact adversely affected by agency action.26 He reaches this con- clusion by reading the phrase "adversely affected" as a separate ground of standing, unmodified by the phrase "within the mean- ing of a relevant statute." 27 Although the legislative history is 28 of ambiguous, examination ofsuccessive drafts of the section,2 competitor of a newly licensed radio station) despite the absence of any intent to protect stations from competition.

S. Doc. No. 248, 79th Cong., 2d Sess. 2I2, 276 (1946).

Ignoring the legislative history, the court interpreted the "relevant statute" provision to refer not to a statute granting judicial review, but to one "relevant" in the sense that it "arguably" protects or regulates some interest of the plaintiff's.32 Unfortunately, the Court's test is vague and its critical terms are left undefined. Mr. Justice Brennan chides the majority for failing to explain how specific an interest must be asserted, when an interest is "arguably" protected, and whether a mere allega- tion will suffice.33 It is even unclear whether or to what extent the Court's test is intended to be a relaxation of the standing doctrine; the concurrence charges that the majority test "comes very close" to the "legally protected interest" standard.34 In- deed, the results in the instant cases might well have been reached without departing from prior law by construing the statutes in question to protect the plaintiffs' interests. Applying the tradi- tional test, the First Circuit found data processors entitled to such protection in a case decided after the lower court decisions in Data Processing,3" and one judge dissented from the Fifth 30Professor Davis recognizes this problem with the wording of the provision: "The statute provides three grounds for standing: legal wrong, aggrieved, and adversely affected. No matter how the last two are interpreted the first seems unnecessary." Davis, "Judicial Control of Administrative Action": A Review, 66 COLUM. L.

Norwalk Redevelopment Agency, 395 F.2d 920, 933 n.26 (2d Cir. i968); Parker v. United States, 307 F. Supp. 685 (D. Colo. 1969); Citizens Comm. for the Hudson Valley v. Volpe, 302 F.

First, the present cases grant standing to defend personal, competitive interests rather than interests shared by the public in general or by an association of citizens. Second, the Court's standard seems more relaxed: the "relevant statute" need only "arguably" protect the plaintiff's interest. 33 Association of Data Processing Service Organizations, Inc. v.

Collins.36 Yet, the very fact that the Court chose to adopt a new read- ing of section io, rather than to base its decision on traditional grounds, suggests that the decision is intended to have an ex- pansive effect on the standing doctrine. The Court itself noted that the trend of decisions is towards relaxation of the standing barrier,37 and thus a change in the law is perhaps best inter- preted as a further step in that direction.38 Furthermore, while the Court's formulation of its test, "arguably within the zone of interests . . . protected or regulated," is vague, it appears to be broader than the traditional requirement of establishing a specific interest which is entitled to legal protection. The Court's suggestion, that the interest need merely be "regulated" rather than "protected" by the statute in question is also a departure from prior law. The vagueness of the Court's test will make it difficult for the lower courts to apply.39 The recent decisions of at least two lower courts suggest that the result may be conflicts between courts and a tendency on the part of the lower courts to read the new test as simply consistent with their own prior approach. In Arnold Tours, Inc. v.

In Data Processing the Court held that both section 4 of the Bank Service Corporation Act of i962 and the "incidental powers" clause of the National Bank Act, I2 U.S.C. ? 24 (Seventh) (i964), were "relevant statutes" within the meaning of the Court's test. 397 U.S. at I57. 36398 F.2d 398, 402 (5th Cir. i968) (Tuttle, J., dissenting). 37 Association of Data Processing Service Organizations, Inc. v.

In Ballerina Pen Co. v.

Such varying inter- pretations are bound to continue until the Supreme Court clarifies the standard to be applied. Assuming the Court's decision is treated as a relaxation of the standing requirement, its consequence is not likely to be a drastic increase in the work of the courts.45 Prior to these de- cisions probably few situations existed in which plaintiffs suf- fering actual harm because of illegal agency action were unable to assert either a legally protected interest or a statutory right to review.46 In situations of doubt, the felt injustice of denying review47 and occasionally the importance of the questions in- volved 48 created great pressure to reach the merits of the case, and therefore to grant standing.

DAVIS, ADMINISTRATIVE LAW TREATISE ? 22.02, at 211 (1958): The reasons in favor of permitting a challenge of governmental action by one who is in fact adversely affected by that action are very powerful. The strongest reason is the principle of elementary justice that one who is in fact hurt by illegal action should have a remedy. 4 For example, five recent cases besides Data Processing have challenged rul- ings of the Comptroller of the Currency permitting the entrance of national banks into new fields: Wingate Corp. v. Industrial Nat'l Bank, 408 F.2d 1147 (ist Cir. i969) (data processing business); Arnold Tours, Inc. v.

Thus, the traditional rules probably achieved little economy of judicial resources.50 B. A ntitrust Application of the Bank Merger Act of I966 to "Small Bank" Mergers. - In United States v. Phillipsburg National Bank &amp; Trust Co.,' the first "small bank" merger case to be fully liti- gated 2 under the Bank Merger Act of i966,3 the Supreme Court continued to display hostility toward horizontal mergers.4 Per- sisting in its efforts "to simplify the test of illegality" 5 under section 7 of the Clayton Act,' the Court in reaching its decision relied exclusively on the market share figures associated with the merger. Defendants, Phillipsburg National Bank and Trust Co. and Second National Bank of Phillipsburg, ranked third and fifth respectively in overall banking business of seven small commer- cial banks in the twin cities of Phillipsburg-Easton. Pursuant to tiff seemed to be the only person likely to undertake the task. See Scanwell Laboratories, Inc. v. Shaffer, 424 F.2d 859, 866-67 (D.C. Cir. 1970). 49See National Ass'n of Securities Dealers v. SEC, 420 F.2d 83, io8 (D.C. Cir. i969) (per curiam), cert. granted, 397 U.S. 986 (5970) (Burger, J., concurring). 50 Should too many plaintiffs attempt to litigate any particular issue under relaxed rules of standing, the problem can be handled by the modern procedural devices of class suits, stays, consolidation of cases, and multi-district transfers. See FED. R. CIV. P. 23, 42; 28 U.S.C. ? I407 (Supp. IV, i969); Flast v. Gardner, 27i F. Supp. I, I7 (i967) (Frankel, J., dissenting), rev'd sub nom. Flast v. Cohen, 392 U.S. 83 (i968). Relaxed rules of standing may also cause unreasonable delay and increased costs in carrying out important government programs. Consequently, the courts and Congress in the future will have to attempt to find solutions which balance the individual's interest in preventing illegal action against the Government's interest in carrying out its programs promptly. Possibilities for dealing with the problem include expediting judicial review, cf. JAFFE 582-83, granting damages but not in- junctive relief, and allowing an element of judicial discretion in deciding whether to grant standing, see Scanwell Laboratories, Inc. v. Shaffer, 424 F.2d 859, 872 (D.C. Cir. I970); Cf. JAFFE 526-28. 1399 U.S. 350 (5970). 2 Appellant's Statement on Jurisdiction at 4, United States v.

This new bank would have been the second largest in the area, controlling I9.3 percent of the total assets and increasing the percentage of bank assets held by the two largest banks from 49 percent to 55 percent, and that of the three largest banks from 6o percent to 68 percent. In terms of the absolute amount of assets held by the defendant banks, the proposed merger was considerably smaller than any of the seven prior bank mergers attacked by the federal govern- ment under the antitrust laws.' Still, the Justice Department brought suit to enjoin the merger as a violation of section 7 of the Clayton Act.'0 The district court dismissed the Government's complaint," applying the two step process prescribed by the Bank Merger Act for judging the legality of a bank merger.'2 First, the court found that the merger would not violate the traditional standards of section 7.'3 Second, the court held that, regardless of its status under section 7, the merger was within the terms of the special proviso of the Bank Merger Act: whatever de minimis anticom- petitive effects the merger might have were outweighed by the resulting benefits to the "convenience and needs of the com- 8See I2 U.S.C. ?

But surely good ad- ministrative practice dictates that the Justice Department establish the boundaries of legality for the business world. Thus, although the Department does not have the resources to attack every small bank merger, Phillipsburg makes clear that such transactions are covered by the prohibitions of the antitrust laws.

The Court, in an opinion by Mr. Justice Brennan, held that the dis- trict court erred in its analysis of the anticompetitive effect of the merger 17 as well as of the "convenience and needs" proviso of the Bank Merger Act.'8 The Court relied on the operative test of anticompetitiveness stated in United States v. Philadelphia National Bank 19 to deter- mine the illegality of the merger under section 7. Philadelphia Bank dispensed with elaborate functional analysis 20 of the effects of a merger in favor of a test which would presumptively con- demn any merger controlling an "undue" percentage share of the relevant market and resulting in a "significant increase" in market concentration.2' Thus, solely on the basis of the merged 14Bank Merger Act of I966, 12 U.S.C. ? i828(c) (5) (B) (Supp. IV, I969). 15 A direct appeal from the district court was taken to the Supreme Court pursuant to the Expediting Act, I5 U.S.C. ? 29 (I964). 16 Mr. Justice Harlan, joined by Mr. Chief Justice Burger, dissented from the Court's "exercise in 'antitrust numerology'' in its analysis of anticompetitive effect, 399 U.S. at 374, but concurred in the Court's conclusion that the district court analyzed the convenience and needs in the wrong geographic market. Mr. Justice Stewart and Mr. Justice Blackmun took no part in the decision. 17 The Court held that the district court used the wrong geographic market to determine the anticompetitive effect of the merger, and that it was error to con- sider the competition from financial institutions other than commercial banks as part of the relevant product market. 18 The Court held that convenience and needs must be judged in the same geographic area used to determine anticompetitive effect, and not in a smaller area as the district court had done. The Court specifically reserved judgment on whether any weight would be given to benefits accruing outside the geographic market area, as was claimed by the defendants in United States v. Philadelphia Nat'l Bank, 374 U.S. 321, 370 (I963), as a justification for their merger. Moreover, even if the Court had not found that the district court erred in its application of the "convenience and needs" test, the case should still have been remanded, since the district court's. error in evaluating the merger's anticompetitive effects under sec- tion 7 tainted the balancing process required to determine whether the merger was saved by the "convenience and needs" proviso of the Bank Merger Act. 19 374 U.S. 321, 363 (I963): [A] merger which produces a firm controlling an undue percentage share of the relevant market, and results in a significant increase in the concen- tration of firms in that market, is so inherently likely to lessen competition substantially that it must be enjoined in the absence of evidence clearly showing that the merger is not likely to have such anticompetitive effects. 20 An example of a functional analysis was described in United States v. Brown Shoe Co., 370 U.S. 294, 322 n.38 (I962): [O]nly a further examination of the particular market -its structure, his- tory and probable future - can provide the appropriate setting for judging the probable anticompetitive effect of the merger. 21 While the Philadelphia Bank test stated that the "percentages raise an infer- ence that the effect of the contemplated merger may be substantially to lessen competition," 374 U.S. at 365, the test's application has in effect turned it into a per se rule of illegality.

Shifting the focus of the test of anticompetitiveness to the size of market shares resulting from a merger made definition of the relevant market of paramount importance. Indeed, the Court has itself previously recognized that a "prediction [of anticompeti- tiveness] is sound only if it is based upon a firm understanding of the structure of the relevant market .. ..7 22 And care in market definition is particularly important when a merger's size merely places it on the border of presumptive illegality, rather than making it clearly suspect. In Philadelphia Bank the proposed merger would have cre- ated a firm controlling 30 percent of the relevant market; the Philadelphia Bank Court specifically reserved the question of whether a merger involving less than 30 percent would be illegal.23 Subsequent section 7 cases have not presumptively condemned a merger solely on the basis of a market share of less than 25 percent.24 In contrast, the merger in Phillipsburg would have produced a bank occupying only I9.3 percent of the relevant market 25 - certainly not an instance of clear anticompetitiveness 44I (I964) ; United States v.

Third Nat'l Bank, 390 U.S. I7I (I968) (38.4%); United States v. Continental Can Co., 378 U.S. 44I (I964) (25%); United States v. Aluminum Co., 377 U.S. 27I (I964) (29.1%). In these cases, the Court also alluded to the increase in concentration resulting from the merger, but the main focus remained on the size of the market share held by the merged firms. In one case, United States v. Von's Grocery Co., 384 U.S. 270 (I966), the market share involved was only 7.5 percent, but the Court's condemnation of the merger was based more on the fact that the number of competitors in the market had declined, than on a presumption drawn from the size of the merging firms alone. A similar analysis was used to determine the illegality of the merger attacked in United States v. Pabst Brewing Co., 384 U.S. 546 (I966), where a small percentage figure was also involved-4.49 percent of the national market. 25 Although the merger would have produced a bank with I9.3 percent of total assets, 27.3 percent of total loans, I9.2 percent of total demand deposits, and 23.4</page><page sequence="188">I970] THE SUPREME COURT, 1969 TERM I89 on the basis of the Court's prior decisions. In so marginal a case, small errors in defining relevant market may readily affect the Court's result. But in light of the Court's past gerrymandering of product market to obtain market share figures most hostile to proposed mergers,26 the Court's failure in Phillipsburg to engage in a re- fined analysis of the relevant line of commerce was not surprising. Thus, the Court did not view commercial banking as a series of submarkets in which competition from other types of financial institutions exists.27 Instead, citing Philadelphia Bank, the Court stated that the cluster of products and services denoted by the term commercial banking composes a distinct line of commerce. In originally reaching this conclusion in Philadelphia Bank, the Court focused upon the fact that certain commercial banking activities, such as the management of demand deposits and the furnishing of short term business loans, are not carried on by other types of financial organizations.28 Thus, in theory, the unique services of a commercial bank give it leverage with which to attract customers for its other services that face competition; the allure of convenient one-stop banking insulates a commercial bank from competition with other segments of the financial market.29 A particular commercial bank's leverage will vary, however, according to the proportion of its business which is in those areas percent of total deposits, the total asset figure, for the sake of convenience, is generally used for the bank's market share.

A larger commercial bank, like the Philadelphia National Bank, which has a high proportion of its assets in demand deposits and has made a high proportion of its loans to commercial and industrial firms enjoys substantially more insulation from noncommercial banking competition than the defendants' bank which would have had a much smaller pro- portion of both demand deposits and commercial loans.30 A very large part of the business of the defendants in Phillipsburg was in areas in which there was competition from other types of financial institutions,31 suggesting the inappropriateness of con- cluding simply on the basis of Philadelphia Bank that commer- cial banking was the relevant product market here. Thus, in Phillipsburg -a questionable case on the basis of the numbers - the Court's blanket market figures overstated the actual amount of defendants' competitive power. Without under- mining efforts to simplify the test of illegality in section 7 actions, the Court could have achieved substantially greater accuracy by analyzing competition in the various submarkets, such as real estate loans, commercial and industrial loans, and individual loans, rather than looking simply at commercial banking. In Phillipsburg the defendants would still have controlled I9.2 per- cent of the demand deposit market, which alone might be suffi- cent to warrant the conclusion that the merger would be anti- competitive under section 7. But, at least in borderline instances, the Court should seek the most precise market data available "The merged banks in Phillipsburg would have had $ii million in demand de- posits constituting 28.9 percent of its total deposits, while the banks in the Philadel- phia Bank case would have had $I,4II million in demand deposits making up 82.5 percent of its total deposits.

Moreover, with respect to the special proviso of the Bank Merger Act, the benefits to the 'convenience and needs" of the community should more easily justify a merger which has anticompetitive effects only in one submarket rather than in the overall market. The Bank Merger Act's "convenience and needs" proviso - a congressional response to the Court's rejection 32 of the notion that redeeming economic or social values would save an other- wise anticompetitive bank merger - established that competition among commercial banks is not the sole criterion for judging a merger, as it is in other lines of commerce.33 It tempers a judg- ment based solely on section 7 considerations by forcing a court ultimately to take into account factors which are not as suscep- tible to quantification as is the notion of market share. Yet to date the Court has treated claims of justification under the "convenience and needs" proviso with such stringency as to raise doubts whether it will have any practical substantive effect. Consistent with the first case to consider the effect of the test, United States v. Third National Bank,34 the Court in Phillips- burg imposed a heavy burden on the defendants to show on re- mand the specific consequences to the whole community of the claimed benefits of the merger and to show that these desired benefits could not be achieved by nonmerger alternatives. The Court's reluctance to deal with the generalities of the balancing process required by the "convenience and needs" test is consistent with its rejection of a functional analysis under section 7 in favor of a test based solely on market shares. Nevertheless, in cases in which the evil is not entirely clear, the Court should be more amenable to allowing evidence of benefits which cannot be pre- cisely measured to justify the merger. Indeed, as a practical matter, it is questionable whether on remand the district court in Phillipsburg can realistically make findings more specific than in its initial opinion.35 Yet, in construing the "convenience and 32See United States v.

In one of the first cases litigated under the Bank Merger Act of I966, United States v. Crocker-Anglo Nat'l Bank, 277 F. Supp. I33 (N.D. Cal. I967), the Justice Depart- ment maintained that the "convenience and needs" test did no more than codify the failing company defense long recognized under section 7 of the Clayton Act, id. at I4I. But the district court rejected this argument. Moreover, the Supreme Court has itself recognized that the intent of the "convenience and needs" proviso is to allow some mergers -although anticompetitive in the traditional section 7 sense -because they serve a broader public interest.

Labor Law i. Federal Court Jurisdiction to Enjoin Violations of "No Strike" Agreements. - Eight years ago, in Sinclair Refining Co. v. Atkinson,1 the Supreme Court held that section 4 of the Norris- LaGuardia Act 2 barred federal courts from enjoining a strike even though it violated a no-strike clause of a collective bargain- ing agreement. Management brought suit under section 30I of the Labor-Management Relations Act which had established a general federal jurisdiction - theretofore undefined in breadth- to hear labor contract disputes. Thus, Sinclair appeared to es- tablish an authoritative exception to the sweeping language of section 30I. Yet grave problems underlay the I962 decision. Prior to Sinclair, the Court had declared that section 30I jurisdiction was to supplement, not preempt, the existing state jurisdictions.4 The 36 II2 CONG. REC. 2444 (I966) (remarks of Congressman Reuss). 1 370 U.S. I95 (I962). Mr. Justice Black reviewed the legislative history of the Norris-LaGuardia Act and concluded that the Court could not ignore "the plain import of a congressional enactment . . . deliberately drafted in the broadest of terms in order to avoid the danger that it would be narrowed by judicial con- struction." Id. at 203. Justice Black acknowledged that granting injunctive relief might better implement the Court's policy of reliance on the arbitral process, but stated that the Court could not undertake such policymaking in the face of so plain a congressional determination to the contrary. Mr. Justice Brennan, in an opinion joined by Justices Harlan and Douglas, dissented. That section 30I had not "repealed" section 4 of Norris-LaGuardia, argued Justice Brennan, did not excuse the Court from its responsibility to recog- nize and resolve in the most constructive manner possible the patent conflict be- tween the two statutes, a conflict which Congress had not resolved. The volleys and counter-volleys of the majority and the dissenters are elab- orated and discussed in The Supreme Court, 1961 Term, 76 HARV. L. REV. 54, 205-I0 (I962). 2 Section 4 of the Norris-LaGuardia Act, 29 U.S.C. ?

Courtney, 368 U.S. 502, 508-o9 (I962).</page><page sequence="192">I970] THE SUPREME COURT, 1969 TERM I93 Court had also articulated the need for uniform legal doctrines for state and federal courts with respect to the interpretation and enforcement of labor contracts.5 Sinclair brought these two dis- tinct federal labor policies into conflict. If the Court were to hold after Sinclair that injunctive relief would remain available in state courts, though not in federal, uniformity in the enforcement of agreements would have been destroyed. Alternatively, by con- cluding that injunctive relief was barred even in state courts, the Court would have maintained uniformity but at the price of thwarting the purpose of Congress in section 30I 6 to leave state jurisdiction intact. In Avco Corp. v. Aero Lodge 735,7 the Court in I968 effectively chose the second alternative. While A vco merely held that a state court suit to enjoin a strike in violation of a no-strike clause could be removed to federal court, the effect of the decision was to prevent state courts from enjoining strikes in violation of contractual agreements. This result directly con- tradicted the forum-expanding purpose of section 30I. Avco dramatized for the Court the conflict in federal policies created by Sinclair. But not until its decision this past Term in The Boys Mlarkets, Inc. v. Retail Clerk's Union, Local 770 8 did the Court directly consider Avco against the backdrop of Sinclair. The Court's conclusion was that the ramifications of Avco were doubly objectionable: not only did it run directly counter to the forum-expanding principle underlying section 3oi; but it also assigned to removal proceedings the "totally unintended func- tion" of effecting "a wholesale dislocation in the allocation of judicial business between the state and federal courts." 9 The Court concluded that it had but two choices: it could explicitly extend to the states Sinclair's prohibition on injunctive relief, or it could overrule Sinclair and thereby open the doors of the federal district courts to prayers for injunctive relief. Noting that Congress had plainly not attempted to extend the Norris- LaGuardia Act to the states, and that an extension of Sinclair to the states would have "devastating implications" for the en- forceability of collective bargaining agreements,10 the Court re- 'Teamsters Local I74 v. Lucas Flour Co., 369 U.S. 95, I02-03 (I962). 6The relevant legislative history of section 30I was recounted by Mr. Justice Stewart, speaking for a unanimous Court, in Dowd Box, 368 U.S. at 5II: The clear implication of the entire record of the congressional debates in both I946 and I947 is that the purpose of conferring jurisdiction upon the federal district courts was not to displace, but to supplement, the thoroughly considered jurisdiction of the courts of the various States over contracts made by labor organizations. 7390 U.S. 557 (I968). 8398 U.S. 235 (1970). 9Id. at 246-47.

Stressing the departure from the previously articulated na- tional labor policy which had been occasioned by Sinclair-Avco, the Court held that henceforth federal courts would be able to enjoin union violations of no-strike clauses in collective agree- ments.1" Speaking for the majority, Mr. Justice Brennan said that the Court was now convinced that section 30I and the Norris-LaGuardia Act could be accommodated since "the central purpose of the Norris-LaGuardia Act to foster the growth and viability of labor organizations is hardly retarded . . . by a re- medial device which merely enforces the obligation that the union freely undertook in a specifically enforceable agreement to submit disputes to arbitration." 12 As a threshold matter, it is impossible to ignore the short span of time - only eight years - within which the Court over- turned Sinclair. Mr. Justice Black, in dissent, raised a variety of objections to the Court's action. Fundamentally, he maintained that the Court lacks the "power" to reformulate a prior statutory interpretation.13 Apparently, Justice Black accepts the judicial 1' See note 39 infra. 12 398 U.S. at 252-53. The Boys Markets and the Clerk's Union were parties to a collective bargaining agreement which provided that all controversies involving its interpretation or application should be resolved by the adjustment and arbitra- tion provisions set forth. During the life of the contract, there was to be "no cessa- tion or stoppage of work, lock-out, picketing, or boycotts . . . ." Id. at 238-39 nn.3-4. In February, i969, a dispute arose in one of petitioner's stores over the stocking of certain frozen food cases by non-union personnel. When the employer refused to restock the same cases using union personnel, the retail clerks imme- diately struck the store and commenced picketing. Subsequently, the Union refused to honor the employer's request to halt the work stoppage and submit the dispute to the grievance and arbitration procedure provided by the contract. As a result, the employer sought injunctive relief in a California state court. The California Court issued a temporary restraining order forbidding continu- ation of the strike; before a preliminary injunction could be obtained, though, the Union removed the case to federal district court and moved to quash the state court's temporary restraining order. The company countered by filing a motion for an order compelling arbitration and by asking that continuation of the strike be enjoined. The district court ordered arbitration of the dispute and enjoined any further work stoppages or inducements of work stoppages by the Union. On appeal, however, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed, considering itself bound by the holding of the Sinclair decision. 4I6 F.2d 368 (gth Cir. i969). 13 Citing the constitutional grant of all legislative power to the Congress, Jus- tice Black concluded that in changing its prior statutory interpretation the Court had "take[n] upon itself the function of the legislature." 398 U.S. at 258 (Black, J., dissenting). Closely associated with this argument was the Justice's view that the Court should be particularly quick to defer to the legislature "when the laws in- volved are the focus of strongly held views of powerful but antagonistic political and economic elements." Id. at 256. But the only proper question for the Court to ask itself is whether the dispute is an adjudicable "case" or "controversy," re-</page><page sequence="194">I970] THE SUPREME COURT, I969 TERM I95 lawmaking associated with the first interpretation of a statutory ambiguity only because such ambiguities are inevitable and re- quire resort to what he considers the non-democratic judicial forum. After an initial interpretation, however, subsequent judi- cial tampering with a statute is "gratuitous" 14 and a usurpation of the congressional prerogative to correct the Court's decision if displeased with the initial interpretation. Mr. Justice Black's view would impose troubling limitations upon the Court's role as an interstitial lawmaker. In our trifur- cated legal system, the Court assumes substantial responsibilities for fitting any new statutory scheme into the existing legal con- text, settling as they arise the variety of open questions which Congress could not foresee or did not wish to predetermine. Ade- quate performance of this judicial task requires that the Court be able to remedy its own unavoidable errors of initial inter- pretation.'5 Beyond the notion that the Court lacks "power" to consider statutory questions twice, the senior Justice argued that recon- sideration of Sinclair was barred as well by stare decisis. The doc- trine of stare decisis is an attempt to ensure the stability of the judicial system by protecting important individual interests: predictability in the law, permitting citizens to order their affairs with assurance that their plans will not be casually disrupted; and consistency in the law, preserving the popular belief in the rationality, and thus the fairness, of the judicial process.'6 For Mr. Justice Black these interests have special force in the context of a statutory decision. By effecting a resolution of a statutory dilemma the Court engenders substantial reliance in the affected segments of society. And in Mr. Justice Black's view, the costs of upsetting the expectations of reliant parties will invariably exceed the practical benefits to be gained by judicial readjustment of a prior statutory interpretation.'7 gardless of the character of the interests involved. That a particular dispute might be resolved by the legislature does not relieve the Court of its judicial responsi- bility. See H.M. HART, JR. &amp; A. SACKS, THE LEGAL PROCESS 536-38 (tent. ed. 1958) [hereinafter cited as THE LEGAL PROCESS]. 14 398 U.S. at 257-58. 15 Were the Court bound to an initial interpretation of a statute, the very flexibility which commends the judiciary as an interstitial lawmaker would be largely negated. "6See A. Cox, THE WARREN COURT 2I (I968). 17 Justice Black quoted from Mr. Justice Brandeis' dissenting opinion in Burnet v. Coronado Oil &amp; Gas Co., 285 U.S. 393, 406 (1932): "Stare decisis is usually the wise policy, because in most matters it is more important that the applicable rule of law be settled than that it be settled right." 398 U.S. at 257 (Black, J., dissent- ing).</page><page sequence="195">I96 HARVARD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 84:I On its face, this rationale would preclude reconsideration of constitutional questions as well as questions of statutory inter- pretation. But the Justice offers a justification for limiting his rule to the statutory context: although reversal of a constitu- tional decision by nonjudicial means requires resort to an elab- orate, costly amending process, overturning a statutory decision without resort to the Court merely involves a vote of Congress.'8 Interests having become fixed, reversal of a statutory decision works dislocations which are never justified in light of the rela- tive accessibility of the legislative mechanism. Thus as a matter of stare decisis, Justice Black concludes that the Court abandoned its proper role in reconsidering Sinclair. Yet to suggest that the differences in the extra-judicial meth- ods of reversing statutory, as opposed to constitutional, decisions should alter the application of principles of stare decisis substan- tially misportrays the difficulty of amending legislation,19 even quite narrowly. The resources of Congress -at least those of time and money -are limited. To build a congressional con- sensus without expanding the focus of a particular legislative inquiry to a degree which will require a substantial commitment of those limited resources is difficult. Minor and technical amend- ments often raise collateral questions which may convince Con- gress not to act at all lest it unsettle larger questions of public policy.20 Consequently, to bar completely judicial reconsideration of prior statutory decisions would build into the legal process a crippling inability to render badly needed interstitial legal ad- justments. Moreover, it is for Congress - not the courts - to order the legislative priorities in dealing with the myriad of im- portant issues which seek congressional attention.2" 18 398 U.S. at 259. 19 See Note, Congressional Reversal of Supreme Court Decisions: I945-1957, 7I HARV.

When a concrete reason arises for doing so, the courts should reconsider prior statutory, as well as constitutional, decisions. In Boys Markets the Court was neither changing its Sinclair position without reason 23 nor upsetting the justifiable expecta- tions of citizens who relied upon the continuing viability of Sin- clair. The Court explained its departure from Sinclair by noting the disruption in national labor policy which Avco, in Sinclair's aftermath, brought to a head. And while the Court had been apprised of the potentially disruptive character of the Sinclair decision,24 it was only with the decision in A vco that these difficul- ties were made real for the Court. Avco, then, was an important catalyst which provided the Court with the necessary, reasoned basis for abandoning Sinclair. Equally important, reconsideration of Sinclair did not strain the policy of continuity encompassed by stare decisis. In its own narrow context, Boys Markets did not disrupt any valid interests or expectations of unions or management, since it effected a change only in remedies; the union's substantive rights remained unaffected, and prior contractual orderings were not altered. Thus, the decision dictated a change from existing expectations only insofar as a union violates a self-imposed duty not to strike over an arbitrable grievance. At the least, whatever surprise a union experiences in finding its contractual commitments effec- tively enforced must be discounted by the warning implicit in the division of the Sinclair Court and explicit in Mr. Justice Stewart's concurring opinion in Avco.25 As to the merits of the dispute over the relationship of section 30I and the Norris-LaGuardia Act, Mr. Justice Black again dis- agreed with the majority, for "[n]othing at all [had] changed [since Sinclair] except the membership of the Court and the per- 22 A.

Superficially, the events preceding Boys Markets provide a persuasive basis for reaching this conclusion. Specific legislation had been introduced in Con- gress to overrule Sinclair on not one but several occasions.27 Nevertheless, as Mr. Justice Brennan noted, it is " 'treacherous to find in congressional silence alone the adoption of a control- ling rule of law.' "1 28 There are any number of plausible explana- tions for the congressional response to Sinclair other than a desire to endorse full-fledged application of the Norris-LaGuardia Act to section 30I suits for injunctive relief. For instance, Congress may have hesitated to attempt an accommodation of the Norris- LaGuardia Act with section 30I because it felt that the Court might better perform that technical task. Or Congress may have decided that Sinclair was so unlikely to survive that it was un- necessary for the legislative branch to correct gratuitously a legal flaw which was sure to be eliminated by the Court.29 Thus, neither the principles of stare decisis nor the silence of Congress during the eight years following Sinclair precludes re- consideration of that decision. And as a matter of substantive federal labor policy, Boys Markets not only extracts the Court from the quagmire of adjusting state court remedies to those available - or not available - in federal court, but also is a far more constructive reconciliation than was Sinclair of the compet- ing policy considerations associated with the Norris-LaGuardia Act and with section 30I. In the seminal decision of Textile Workers Union of America 26 398 U.S. at 256 (Black, J., dissenting). Mr. Justice Stewart, who voted with the majority in Sinclair, concurred in the Court's decision in Boys Markets. In a half-page opinion, he confessed that "the temptation [was] strong to embark upon a lengthy personal apologia" for his change of mind within the relatively short span of eight years. Instead he chose to seek "refuge" in an aphorism of Mr. Justice Frankfurter: " 'Wisdom too often never comes, and so one ought not to reject it merely because it comes late.'

Lincoln Mills,"0 the Court had held that section 30I was not merely procedural but instead established federal substantive rights to secure enforcement of collective bargaining agree- ments.3" The substantive law to be applied, said the Court, was "federal law, which the courts must fashion from the policy of our national labor laws." 32 The body of federal labor contract law prescribed in Lincoln Mills was most notably articulated in the I960 Steelworkers' Trilogy 33 which established arbitration - "a kingpin of federal labor policy" 34 -as the preferred mech- anism for resolving peacefully industrial disputes. This strong federal policy in favor of non-disruptive resolu- tion of industrial disputes provides a solid foundation for the substantive result in Boys Markets. If employers are to promote and cooperate in the peaceful settlement of labor disputes, federal courts must have authority to issue injunctions against strikes which violate explicit contractual commitments. Awarding dam- ages still leaves employers vulnerable to serious economic harm because it is difficult to estimate the full extent of the injury which results from a substantial disruption of normal business operations.35 Moreover, it is unlikely that an employer will wish to inflame labor-management relations by suing a union of his employees after a strike has ended.36 If a collective regime of in- dustrial self-government does not provide the employer with firm assurance of business continuity, his incentive to expand or even live within that regime will be greatly diminished.37 30 353 U.S. 448 (I957). 31 Id. at 450-5I: ? 30I (a) is more than jurisdictional . . .

That Act was responsive to an era in which federal judges wheeled out doctrines of traditional tort law to evaluate the "unlawful ends" for which concerted activities were conducted and the "unlawful means" chosen to bring about those ends. They used the injunction to impose their views upon col- lective activities in a fashion which - by intention or not seriously undermined union organizational and bargaining ef- forts.38 Boys Markets, however, permits injunctive relief only when a union has made a specific contractual commitment to arbitrate the strike-causing dispute; the district court must make such a determination as a precondition to granting relief.39 Further, the Norris-LaGuardia Act embodied a "hands-off" conception of the role which the law is to play in labor relations. Barring fraud or violence, the parties were to settle disputes including those involving breaches of contract - through negotia- tion and economic combat.40 But collective agreements are now central to our system of industrial relations. In section 30I, Con- gress has specifically provided for the positive support of law to enforce those agreements by suits in the federal courts. Thus whatever force the Norris-LaGuardia Act may retain, it arguably New Orleans Steamship Ass'n v. General Longshore Workers, 389 F.2d 369 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 393 U.S. 828 (i968); Pacific Maritime Ass'n v. International Longshoremen's Union, 304 F. Supp. I3I5 (N.D. Cal. i969). Nevertheless, this roundabout procedure places heavy emphasis on form and, more importantly, compels the employer to resort to a cumbersome series of legal maneuvers too slug- gish to assure the continuation of business operations. 38 COX, The Role of the Law in Labor Disputes, 39 CORNELL L.Q. 592, 594-96 ('954) 3' The Court in Boys Markets adopted principles, previously suggested in Mr. Justice Brennan's Sinclair dissent, to guide the district courts in determining whether to grant injunctive relief under section 30I. 398 U.S. at 254, quoting from 370 U.S. at 228. Of central importance in future cases will be the suggestion there that "[w]hen a strike is sought to be enjoined because it is over a grievance which both parties are contractually bound to arbitrate, the District Court may issue no injunction until it first holds that the contract does have that effect ......" Id. (emphasis in original). Ordinarily, federal courts will await an arbi- trator's determination of the arbitrability of a contractual dispute. See, e.g., United Steelworkers of America v. Warrior &amp; Gulf Navigation Co., 363 U.S. 574, 584-85 (I960). This policy of deference to arbitration no doubt reflects the Supreme Court's own belief that arbitrators are more sensitive first-line interpreters of labor contracts than are judges. See 363 U.S. at 579-82. See also H. WELLINGTON, supra note 37, at I04-06 (I968). Yet the Court in Boys Markets now suggests that federal courts engage in the interpretation of arbitration clauses when an employer seeks injunctive relief against a strike alleged to violate a contract. In the strike situation, when urgency pervades all proceedings, the Court appears, then, to have compromised its hitherto strict rule of bowing to the jurisdiction of the arbitrator. "4 Cox, supra note 36, at 595-96.</page><page sequence="200">I970] THE SUPREME COURT, I969 TERM 201 ought to be qualified by the subsequent development of federal labor contract law which needs the support of a viable remedial arsenal apparently not thought to be required for peaceful labor relations forty years ago.4" Nevertheless, the I962 Sinclair Court rejected the suggestion that the Norris-LaGuardia Act might be modified indirectly through subsequent legislation of even the magnitude of section 30I. If Congress had intended to repeal any part of "such a long- standing carefully thought out and highly significant part of this country's labor legislation," 42 the Court stated, it would have done so explicitly. Since there had been no "repeal" of section 4 of the Norris-LaGuardia Act, the Court was convinced that the provision should stand. The Sinclair majority apparently rested its decision on a rule of clear statement.43 But clear statement is not a judicial device to thwart the will of Congress; in part, it is a means of ensuring that judges do not rewrite laws in violation of congressional will. It is the responsibility of the judiciary to respond to the indica- tions of Congress that a specific policy has been made controlling law. In applying the doctrine of clear statement, courts must look not only to the significance of the original policy expression which they are reluctant to controvert, but also to the significance of the later enactment which allegedly modifies the earlier one. The more far-reaching a second legislative policy statement ap- pears to be from a sound view of its historical context, the more justified is the Court in embracing the principle suggested by Mr. Justice Holmes on circuit: 44 The major premise of the conclusion expressed in a statute, the change of policy that induces the enactment, may not be set out in terms, but it is not an adequate discharge of duty for courts to say: We see what you are driving at, but you have not said it, and therefore we shall go on as before. It is upon this principle that the Court apparently relied in Boys Markets, having turned its back upon Sinclair's quest for express repeal. In the Taft-Hartley Act, Congress intentionally 41 See Loeb, Accommodation of the Norris-LaGuardia Act to Other Federal Statutes, ii LAB. L.J. 473 passim (I960). The Court had, in fact, previously rec- ognized the need to accommodate the Norris-LaGuardia Act to more recent statutes. Textile Workers Union of America v.

Atkinson, 370 U.S. I95, 203 (I962). 43 In the present context, the notion of a "rule of clear statement" is intended to embody a policy of judicial reluctance to declare a significant change in existing law in the absence of a readily apprehensible legislative mandate for doing so. 44Johnson v.

This evident redirection of labor policy argues persuasively that the courts had been given a mandate to reconcile preexisting law with the needs of the new policy. 2. NLRB Remedial Power to Impose Contract Terms. - In H.K. Porter Co. v. NLRB,1 the Supreme Court held that the National Labor Relations Board could not impose a substantive contractual term upon an employer as a remedy for even the fla- grant violation of its statutory duty to bargain in good faith with the union over that term of employment. The decision terminated an eight-year bargaining dispute between the United Steelwork- ers of America and the H. K. Porter Company, manufacturers of saws and other tools. Contract negotiations began soon after the Steelworkers were certified on October 5, I96I, as the exclu- sive bargaining agent for the production and maintenance em- ployees of the company's Danville, Virginia plant. Five years later, despite an NLRB decree ordering the company to bargain in good faith,2 no agreement had been reached. The chief stum- bling block was the union's insistence on either a dues checkoff 3 or some alternative provision which would facilitate the collec- tion of union dues.4 The company rejected each union proposal, not because the checkoff or any alternative would have contra- vened an established company policy 5 or would have resulted in administrative inconvenience,6 but because dues collection was "union business," in which the company was not "going to aid and comfort the union." 7 On the basis of these facts, the union again charged the com- pany with refusing to bargain in good faith, in violation of sec- tions 8(a) (5) and 8(a) (i) of the National Labor Relations 397 U.S. 99 (1970). 2 On September 20, i963, a trial examiner found that, in 28 bargaining ses- sions between October, I96I and November, I962, the company had failed to bargain in good faith by refusing to agree to a provision requiring the arbitration of grievances while insisting on a no-strike clause, see Textile Workers Union v. Lincoln Mills, 353 U.S. 448, 455 (i957), and by unilaterally implementing certain new working conditions proposed by the union during collective bargaining. The NLRB ordered the company to cease and desist from its illegal conduct and to bargain in good faith. The Fourth Circuit summarily enforced the Board's order in an unreported decision. 3 Checkoff is a procedure whereby union dues are deducted by the employer from employees' wages and paid directly to the union. ' As alternatives to a checkoff, the union proposed that its financial secretary be given access to the plant when dues were owing, or that union stewards be al- lowed to collect dues in the plant during non-working hours. ' The Company had granted a checkoff to unions at its other plants. 6 The Company regularly made payroll deductions for savings bonds, insur- ance, the United Givers Fund, and a "Good Neighbor" fund.

NLRB, 397 U.S. 99 (I970).</page><page sequence="202">I970] THE SUPREME COURT, 1969 TERM 203 Act.8 The trial examiner agreed, finding that the company took an ironclad position on the checkoff for the prohibited purpose of frustrating agreement with the union.9 The NLRB adopted the examiner's findings and ordered the company again to cease and desist from its unfair labor practices and to bargain collectively over the checkoff.'0 The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia enforced the Board's order,"1 and, in a clarifying opinion,12 held that in certain circumstances a "checkoff may be imposed as a remedy for bad faith bargaining .. . . 13 The Board then promulgated a supplemental order requiring the company to grant to the union a contract clause providing for the checkoff of union dues.'4 The court of appeals enforced the order per curiam.15 In a 4-2 decision, the Supreme Court reversed. Mr. Justice Black, in an opinion for the Court, conceded that a violation of the employer's duty to bargain in good faith might indeed have been proven, and that the Board had broad remedial powers under section io(c) of the National Labor Relations Act.'6 Neverthe- less, he concluded that "allowing the Board to compel agreement when the parties themselves are unable to agree would violate the fundamental premise on which the Act is based - private bargaining under governmental supervision of the procedure alone, without any official compulsion over the actual terms of the contract. '17 8 29 U.S.C. ?? I58(a) (5), I58(a) (i) (i964). 9 During the course of the negotiations, the union had made its position clear. It considered a checkoff provision or an acceptable substitute to be vital, because its closest office was 85 miles from Danville, and because the more than 300 mem- bers of the bargaining unit lived within a radius of some 35 to 40 miles from Danville. Appendix at 22, 23. In sustaining the unfair labor practice charge, the examiner based his decision on the clearly demonstrated anti-union animus of the company negotiator, the company's failure to present an acceptable explanation for refusal of the checkoff, and the company's willingness to grant the checkoff to other unions at its other plants.

When the Board has been confronted rectly described the "general design and main thrust of the Act," but argued that '[i]n those narrow and specialized circumstances" when there is prolonged bad- faith bargaining, designed to frustrate agreement, and the employer does not base his refusal to agree to a contractual term upon any business reason, the Board should have the power to provide an effective remedy under section io(c) of the National Labor Relations Act-inclusion of the contractual term.

Justices Marshall and White did not participate; Justice Blackmun had not yet joined the Court. 18 The duty to bargain in good faith has proven to be one of the more elusive concepts in a field permeated with subjectivity.

Indeed, Board procedures often work to the benefit of the recalcitrant employer. The Cox Report 23 noted that the average contested unfair labor practice charge required some 475 days from the date of filing until a Board decision was reached, and an additional 396 days until a court order enforcing the decree or setting it aside was handed down. Because the Board itself has no contempt powers, viola- tions of the order may only be punished through a lengthy court hearing, in which it is often difficult for the Board to win.24 Though these often-inadequate Board remedies had been noted with distress by Board members,25 Congress,26 and other observ- ers,27 Porter was the first attempt by the Board to develop a mean- ingful response to the bad-faith bargaining recidividist. The Board, as the Supreme Court recently reiterated, has broad remedial powers.28 Since there is often a close connection between remedy and policy, the question of remedies is peculiarly a matter for administrative discretion,29 and the Court will there- fore not lightly reverse the Board when the Board invokes its sec- 23 ADVISORY PANEL ON LABOR-MANAGEMENT RELATIONS LAW, ORGANIZATION AND PROCEDURE OF THE NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS BOARD, S.

Labor Board orders constitute in many situations no more than a "slap on the wrist." They are both too little and too late. They constitute, in the words of one witness, "a license fee for union busting." The subcommittee recommends that the Labor Board reconsider the problem of "remedies" with an eye to taking the profit out of unfair labor practices. SUBCOMMITTEE ON THE NLRB OF THE HOUSE COMM.

The role of the Government in labor relations has swung from a policy of frequent intervention, to one of laissez-faire treatment, to the present more balanced approach of employing the federal judiciary to secure the peaceful resolution of labor disputes within a framework of private ordering. 32 Yet, ever since its first direct intervention into labor relations, and especially during the past thirty-five years under the NLRA, Congress has consistently ex- pressed its conviction that the actual terms of a collective bar- gaining agreement under which labor and management are to live should be determined solely by the parties themselves, and not by any agency of the Government.33 This policy was reaffirmed 30See Virginia Electric &amp; Power Co. v. NLRB, 3I9 U.S. 533, 539-40 (I943). 31 H.K. Porter Co. v. NLRB, 397 U.S. 99, io8 (I970). 32 This historical evolution is briefly sketched in Cox, The Role of Law in Labor Disputes, 39 CORN.

What happens behind those doors is not inquired into, and the bill does not seek to inquire into it. It anticipates that the employer will deal reasonably with the employees, that he will be patient, but he is obliged to sign no agreement .... There is no effort in that respect to change the situation which exists today. All employers are left free in the future as in the past to accept whatever terms they choose. 79 CONG. REC. 7660 (1935), 2 LEGISLATIVE HISTORY OF THE NATIONAL LABOR RI- LATIONS ACT OF I935 at 2373-74 (I949) [hereinafter cited as I935 HISTORY].

In addition, in upholding the constitutionality of the basic NLRA scheme, the Supreme Court early pointed out: The Act does not compel agreements between employers and employees. It does not compel any agreement whatever. . . . The theory of the Act is that free opportunity for the negotiation with accredited representatives of employees is likely to promote industrial peace and may bring about the adjustments and agreements which the Act in itself does not attempt to compel.</page><page sequence="206">I970] THE SUPREME COURT, 1969 TERM 207 by Congress with the addition to the nation's labor laws of sec- tion 8(d) of the Taft-Hartley Act, which broadly defines the duty to bargain collectively, but includes the limitation that "such obligation does not compel either party to agree to a proposal or require the making of a concession." 34 Undeniably, then, freedom of contract -leaving the imposition of contractual terms to the regulated forces of the marketplace - has been a persistent theme of American labor policy. The remedial powers granted to the Board in section io(c) must be measured against the background of this historical policy of contractual freedom within procedural restraint. A factor which argues persuasively against making inroads upon contractual freedom through section io(c) is the lack of directness with which the provision supports so significant a judicial step. The language of section io(c) is quite general, and it has not been elaborated in any way relevant to the Porter dilemma since it was enacted as part of the original Wagner Act. There is no indication either that Congress has itself compromised the notion of contractual freedom since I935 or that it has subsequently suggested to the courts that they elevate section io (c) to paramount status among the provisions of the national labor law - a back door through which the Board may slip major policy revisions. Still, it would not have been logically inconsistent with the principle of contractual freedom if Congress had intended to confer upon the Board accordion-like remedial powers, expansive enough to achieve requisite industrial stability in the short-run regardless of collateral implications. Freedom of contract is in- deed an ideal which echoes frequently in congressional debates over the labor laws, but it is never espoused in the context of remedies for illegal refusals to bargain. As the court of appeals noted, on its face section 8(d) prohibits consideration of refusals to agree only in determning whether an 8 (a) (5) violation has oc- curred, not in determining the type of remedy which might be ap- propriate after a refusal to bargain has been established.35 In view of the broad delegation of remedial power to the Board in section io(c), it is at least arguable that the policy of freedom of contract, so highly valued, is limited in application to employ- ers not in violation of the NLRA - that it is, in effect, "waived" by recalcitrant bad faith employers. Yet the majority opinion in Porter reflects no such uncer- tainty. Instead, Justice Black focuses exclusively upon the no- NLRB v.

At the least, the questionable relevance of section 8(d) to remedial imposition of contract terms, coupled with the magnitude of the policy change which might flow from imposition of remedial terms, suggests that the Porter Court might more appropriately have couched its opinion in terms of the law's uncertainty. Rather than claiming a clear prohibition not necessarily justified by the labor laws themselves, the Court ought to have expressed its need for an indication of congressional sentiment far less ambiguous than that provided by the broad wording of section io(c) alone in order to justify departure from a recurrent -indeed, fundamental-theme of national labor policy.36 Justices Douglas and Stewart, in dissent, contended that the remedy sought in Porter would not signal a fundamental change in labor policy, and, by implication, would therefore not require plain congressional authorization. In their view, the remedy could be confined to those "narrow and specialized circumstances" when a union demand is denied for no business consideration, but rather for the purpose of preventing agreement.37 This view- point, however, is quite optimistic. Although the Porter dispute centered around a seemingly limited union proposal, the Board, if allowed to exercise the power it sought in this case, would likely be impelled toward application of the new remedy to refusals to bargain over wages, pension plans, fringe benefits, and a multi- tude of basic working conditions.38 Once a section 8(a) (s) vio- lation was discovered, every management refusal of a union re- quest would be subject to inspection in order to discover whether the refusal constituted an attempt to forestall or preclude agree- ment, and whether it was justified for business reasons. Nor can the dissenters' suggestion be made viable by differ- entiating wages and other crucial terms from the dues checkoff on the basis of the minimal costs of the checkoff to the employer. Few concessions, if any, involve no present monetary or admin- istrative costs. Additionally, the present out-of-pocket cost to the employer of a concession is no sure measure of the long-term worth to him of refusing a union proposal. Reluctance to grant any particular concession could be explained in every instance 36See Wellington &amp; Albert, Statutory Interpretation and the Political Process: A Comment on Sinclair v. Atkinson, 72 YALE L.J. I547, I562-66 (I963). 37See note I7, supra. 38 It is difficult to perceive how any distinction drawn by a court which treated cases differently based only upon the content of a union demand might be adequately principled. Discretionary distinctions are normally to be drawn by Congress and not by the courts. See H.M. HART &amp; A. SACKS, THE LEGAL PROCESS; BASIC PROBLEMS IN THE MAKING AND APPLICATION OF LAW I39 (tent. ed. 1958).</page><page sequence="208">I970] THE SUPREME COURT, 1969 TERM 209 by a desire on management's part to preserve its largesse for a contract bargaining session in future years, when it might be in- capable of offering more in the form of wages or fringe benefits. What a union might sacrifice to procure an employer's concession may therefore be a more accurate approximation of its "cost" to the employer than his cash expense in implementing the union demand here and now. Even if it might somehow be feasible for the Board to admin- ister a de minimis rule whereby minor present expense to the em- ployer would be overlooked, such a rule would not be advisable on prudential grounds. It hardly seems sensible to compromise the principle of contractual freedom - thereby generating unpredic- table future pressures for expansion of that compromise - for the insignificant purpose of remedying only those violations of section 8(a) (s) which save the employer a mere pittance and are of little value to the union. Other violations, like a refusal to bargain over the checkoff, may cost the union far more than the cash the employer saves through his recalcitrance: independent union implementation may be very expensive, or, as is likely in the case of the checkoff, there may be no substitute at all for em- ployer implementation. However, because they may represent potential savings to the employee in future bargaining sessions commensurate with their value to the union, concessions on such proposals no longer have de minimis costs at all. Given, then, the absence of an acceptable means of confining the Porter remedy, it would indeed have worked a far-reaching change in federal labor policy as it has evolved over the past several decades. Though Porter is a rare case, its implications will be severe. Some stifling of Board initiative and inventiveness is inevitable. This effect has already been felt in four cases recently decided by the Board. In Ex-Cell-O Corp.39 and three companion cases,40 the employers engaged in a complete refusal to bargain. To compensate the employees for benefits they might have gained had good faith bargaining taken place, the Board's General Coun- sel sought compensatory damages based upon statistics showing average wage and fringe benefit gains in the particular industry involved. Such remedies were granted by the trial examiners in the Ex-Cell-O and Zinke's Foods cases. The Board, however, concluded that it was powerless to grant the requested relief. 3 Ex-Cell-O Corp., No. 25-CA-2377 (NLRB Trial Examiner's Decision, March 2, I967). 40Zinke's Foods, Inc., No. 3o-CA-372 (NLRB Trial Examiner's Decision, Dec. i8, I967); Herman Wilson Lumber Co., No. 26-CA-2536 (NLRB Trial Examiner's Decision, Jan. 4, I967); Rasco Olympia, Inc., No. i9-CA-3i87 (NLRB Trial Examiner's Decision, Dec. 5, I966).</page><page sequence="209">2I0 HARVARD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 84:I While the Board's opinion mentions the administrative difficulty and extraordinary speculation which would be inherent in the award of such damages, Porter was decisive. The majority viewed the award of such damages as equivalent to the imposition of contract terms upon the employer: the employer is effectively made liable, because of his refusal to bargain in good faith, for contractual responsibilities to which he never acceded.4' To have sustained the Ex-Cell-O remedy in the face of Porter would have required skillful verbal gymnastics. To be sure, as the Ex-Cell-O dissent noted, certain differences between the two cases are obvious. In Porter, a contract term governing future conduct between the parties was in question, while in Ex-Cell-O the award sought by the union did not pur- port to govern future conduct. But the relevance of the distinc- tion seems at best tangential to the Court's objections in Porter. If the Board is without power to dictate to the parties the sub- stantive terms by which they are to guide their conduct, then it seems irrelevant that the terms are being constructively imposed upon past conduct rather than being actually imposed upon fu- ture conduct. The assertion appears untenable that a Board order on January i, I967 requiring an employer to remedy an 8 (a) (5) violation by granting a fifty cents an hour wage increase over the following three years would be illegal, while an order on January i, I970 requiring the payment of a similar amount as compensatory damages for a three-year-old refusal to bargain would be valid.42 If nothing else, such an order would have a 41 In comparing the two cases, the Board remarked: In either case the employer has not agreed to the contractual provision for which he must accept full responsibility as though he had agreed to it. Our colleagues contend that a compensatory remedy is not the "writing of a contract" because it does not "specify new or continuing terms of employ- ment and does not prohibit changes in existing terms and conditions." But there is no basis for such a remedy unless the Board finds, as a matter of fact, that a contract would have resulted from bargaining. The fact that the contract, so to speak, is "written in the air" does not diminish its finan- cial impact upon the recalcitrant employer who, willy-nilly, is forced to accede to terms never mutually established by the parties.

The union petitioned the court of appeals for further relief. The court agreed with the union that "some meaningful make-whole relief" was in order, along the lines suggested in Ex-Cell-O, and remanded the cases to the Board for further proceedings. The court distinguished Porter by noting that only past damages, "not [the] compulsion of a future contract term," were in- volved. In addition, the court maintained that no contract was being written or implied.

In fact, in many respects Porter is a stronger case for the Board's remedy, since only a single issue was involved, and checkoffs have been granted in ninety-two percent of all collective bargaining agreements.43 In Ex-Cell-O, the Board is being asked somehow to make an educated estimate of how a complex bar- gaining contract, involving a range of issues, would have been settled. Not only is it impossible to determine whether any agree- ment would ever have been reached in fact; but it seems equally improbable that approximate contract terms gleaned from "sim- ilar" industrial circumstances could ever account reliably for the unique relative strengths of the particular management and union in question. After Porter, it is more obvious than ever that the Board badly needs Congressional authorization for more biting sanctions with which to combat the persistent 8(a) (s) offender. Of course, allowing the Board to impose substantive terms need not be the only answer,44 but for the present it seems clear that the initiative rests with Congress to provide new tools. D. Securities Regulation Section I4(a): Causation and Attorneys' Fees. - In Mills v. Electric Auto-Lite Co.,' the Supreme Court defined the rule of causation for private actions under the proxy rules and offered additional incentives to the institution of such suits. Sharehold- ers of Auto-Lite sued to set aside the merger of their company into the Mergenthaler Linotype Company. They alleged that the management of Auto-Lite had violated section W4(a) of the Se- (and unlawful) labor practice." Id. at 1252. Judge MacKinnon dissented, be- lieving that Porter barred such a remedy. The argument that the Board would merely be calculating damages (raised also by the dissent in Ex-Cell-O) is super- ficially sound. Yet the payoff to the employees is exactly equal to what a retro- active imposition of terms would provide- and it is precisely that danger of highly conjectural non-marketplace calculations against which Porter inveighs. 43See United Steelworkers v.

Other alternatives would be to confer a right of action for damages upon unions unlawfully deprived of their bargaining rights, with a Board finding of an 8(a) (5) violation serving as prima facie evidence, or to allow the Board to grant cash payments to employees based upon constructively-imposed contract terms, but discounted by an amount corresponding to the probability that no contract would have resulted had the parties bargained in good faith. 1396 U.S. 375 (1970).</page><page sequence="211">2I2 HARVARD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 84:I curities Exchange Act of I934 2 and SEC Rule I4a-9 3 by means of material misrepresentations in their proxy solicitation state- ments. Plaintiffs claimed that the directors had purported to give a disinterested recommendation of the merger without disclosing that Mergenthaler already owned over fifty percent of Auto-Lite's stock and controlled its management. The district court held that this nondisclosure was a material misrepresentation. Also, since votes from minority shareholders obtained by proxy were necessary for approval of the merger, the court found a causal relationship between the proxy violation and the merger sufficient to support a private cause of action. It therefore granted inter- locutory judgment on the question of liability, referring the case to a master to determine the appropriate remedy.4 The Seventh Circuit reversed on the causation issue, ruling that once the merger had taken place, respondents would not be liable if they could prove that because the merger was fair to the minority shareholders it probably would have been approved even had there been no misstatement.5 The Supreme Court reversed. Mr. Justice Harlan, writing for the Court, took the view that to establish a causal relation- ship between a material misrepresentation and the private injury the plaintiff need only show that the proxy solicitation in which the material misrepresentation occurred was an essential link in the consummation of the transaction. The Court also held that the shareholders who had established a violation of section I4(a) by their corporation and its officials should be reimbursed by the corporation for the costs, including attorneys' fees, they incurred in establishing their cause of action. J.I. Case Co. v. Borak 6 recognized an implied private right of action for violations of section I4(a) of the Securities Exchange Act, entitling the successful plaintiff to any appropriate remedy for his injury, but did not define the causal relationship between 2 I5 U.S.C. ? 78n(a) (i964).

Since Borak, lower courts have speculated that relief is not authorized except where the misrepresentation had a "transactional function," 7 such that full disclosure would have produced a "substantial probability of a different result." 8 Their exegesis, however, has been too general to provide adequate guidance for specific factual situations. The Court in Mills, fol- lowing the same route with regard to causation that the lower courts had earlier taken with respect to materiality,9 provided this guidance: the test of causation is whether the proxy solicita- tion was necessary to the transaction, rather than whether the particular proxies influences were controlling.19 The Court chose the objective over the subjective test primarily because it re- solves "doubts in favor of those the statute is designed to pro- tect . . . ...11 The Court, however, cast doubt on whether its causation rule will, in practice, protect shareholder suffrage by noting that even when the violation is proved, a completed merger should be set aside "only if a court of equity concludes . . . that it would be equitable to do so," 12 and that "damages should be recoverable I Laurenzano v.

Under the court of appeals' test, two prerequisites must be satisfied before a court may set aside a completed corporate transaction: the transaction itself must damage the economic interests of the stockholders; and a decree rescinding the transaction must not be either im- practicable or unfair to the stockholders or to third parties who relied on the validity of the corporate action in dealing with the weigh the interests of subsequent purchasers of shares and creditors of the merged corporation.

Id. at 388-89. 14 The question of relief was not before the Court in Mills and its dicta con- cerning it were designed only to furnish rough guidelines for the fashioning of appropriate relief. The Court noted that the question of relief was for the district court on remand, and that its "singling out of some of the possibilities is not intended to exclude others." Id. at 389. One possible type of relief, short of setting aside the merger, would be for the district court to order a resolicitation. 15 Cf. Note, supra note I2, at 346. Discussion of how the courts will apply the new Mills causation test and its practical remedial effects is necessarily specu- lative. Due to the lack of actual authority on this aspect of securities regulation, "we still know very little about the circumstances under which the court's discre- tion to set aside consummated corporate action -or even to declare the proxies void-will be exercised." 5 Loss at 293I. One is left only with reference to general principles, for example, "balancing of the equities . . . will presumably lead in appropriate cases to the setting aside of consummated action." Id. at 2939. 16 There is, however, the possibility that the holding of liability, without any remedial action, will provide indirect protection to corporate suffrage. As a result of a court ruling, the shareholders may purge the management of the wrongdoers. Similarly, managers may be deterred from violations of the Act simply by fear of the damage to their reputations that might result from a court ruling that they have violated the law. The likelihood of such indirect protection is, of course, impossible to assess.</page><page sequence="214">I9701 THE SUPREME COURT, 1969 TERM 2I5 corporation. The first requirement bases the outcome of the liti- gation on a court's judgment as to the objective fairness of the transaction. It ignores the shareholders' independent interest in fair corporate suffrage and the intent of the securities laws to leave to the stockholders thle task of defining their own economic interests. The Mills test of causation eliminates the requirement that a transaction must be economically unfair in order to be upset, thereby narrowing the impact of the fairness notion to those cases in which it would be unfair to set aside the trans- action.'7 Thus, Mills increases the protection accorded share- holders' non-economic interests by authorizing courts to set aside any transaction tainted by a proxy violation, regardless of whether it injures the investors economically, provided setting it aside would not be inequitable. Had the court of appeals' rule not been modified by the Court, lack of causation might have barred the courts from setting aside the vote, even if it were practical to do so. The Court's finding of causation and liability paved the way for its additional holding that shareholders who have established a violation of section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act should be reimbursed by the corporation for their costs of liti- gation.18 The basis for the award of attorneys' fees in a deriva- tive action is the equitable notion that the action benefits the shareholders as a group and that it is unfair to allow the entire cost of prosecuting the action to fall solely on the shareholders who enforced the corporate claim. Prior to Mills, however, it had been well settled that reimbursement was not allowed unless the suit produced a substantial and direct benefit to the corporation or its shareholders as a group.'9 This requirement of a substan- 17 The new causation rule will thus save courts and litigants from many costly and time-consuming problems of proof at trial by rendering unnecessary an inquiry into the operative effect of the misrepresentation or into the objective fairness of the transaction. 18 There is no statutory provision expressly authorizing the award of attorneys' fees in ? I4(a) cases, but the Court reasoned that the allowance of such costs in appropriate situations is part of the historic equity jurisdiction of the federal courts. See Sprague v. Ticonic Nat'l Bank, 307 U.S. i6i, 064, i66 (i939). '9See I3 W. FLETCHER, PRIVATE CORPORATIONS ? 6045 (rev. ed. I96I). While "[t]here can be considerable difference of opinion as to whether a benefit resulted," 2 G. HORNSTEIN, CORPORATION LAW AND PRACTICE ? 732 n.94 (i959), no case cited by Mills had gone so far as to award costs when the derivative action achieved no substantial benefit for the corporation. The term "substantial benefit" seems to comprehend a benefit resulting from a court decree ordering a substantial change in the status quo, as it existed after the violation, and benefiting specially the corporation and its shareholders. The Minnesota Supreme Court case on which Mills relies heavily, Bosch v. Meeker Cooperative Light &amp; Power Ass'n, 257 Minn. 362, 365-66, ioi N.W.2d 423, 426- 27 (ig60), warned that no award should be made unless the result of the suit</page><page sequence="215">2 I 6 HARVARD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 84: I tial direct benefit was imposed by the courts in order to place some check on derivative actions that were only "strike suits of great nuisance and no affirmative good." 20 The Mills decision redefines the requirement. Although the Court spoke of the "substantial service to the corporation and its shareholders" rendered by the petitioners,2' when it detailed the nature of that service it spoke only of benefits accruing to the corporate system generally.22 A determination that the peti- tioners have established a cause of action but are not entitled to any remedial decree 23 may vindicate the statutory policy by detecting violations of the securities laws 24 and by deterring future violations.25 But these benefits accrue to shareholders throughout the system, not merely to shareholders of the cor- poration involved in the litigation.2" Consequently, when the Court cited "overriding considerations" as justifying an award of attorneys' fees in Mills, it was apparently referring to its own "corrects or prevents an abuse," or "straightens out" corporate affairs. Attorneys' fees have been awarded when, for example, derivative suits have succeeded in nullifying an amendment to articles of incorporation, Berger v. Amana Soc'y, 253 Iowa 378, iiI N.W.2d 753 (i96i), or invalidating a bylaw amendment, Bosch v.

This was left initially to the discretion of the trial court, id. at 390 n.I3, but the Court did comment that whether petitioners could show a need for "significant relief" upon remand would be a factor in determining whether a further award would be made. Id. at 396. 24 Once petitioners have established that a violation has occurred and that respondents are liable, even if they are awarded no substantial remedy, the gov- ernment may complete the initial prosecutorial work of the petitioners and, in cases of more serious violations, seek the imposition of penalties under the Se- curities Act. See Hornstein, Legal Therapeutics: The "Salvage" Factor in Counsel Fee Awards, 69 HARV. L. REV. 658, 663 (I956). See also Schechtman v. Wolfson, 244 F.2d 537, 539 (2d Cir. I957). Because the SEC must examine several thousand proxy statements annually and cannot do a complete job of finding violations, private enforcement is an important supplement to Commission action. See J.1. Case Co. v. Borak, 377 U.S. 426, 432 (i964). 25 See note i6 supra. 26 While it may be argued that the shareholders of the particular corporation secure some special benefit since they can purge the managers identified as wrong- doers, this is so speculative as to not qualify as a "substantial benefit." Sce note i6 supra.</page><page sequence="216">I970] THE SUPREME COURT, 1969 TERM 217 judgment that private suits under section I4(a) are essential to the enforcement of fair corporate suffrage,27 and that attorneys' fees are a necessary incentive to such litigation because of the unlikelihood of substantial personal benefit for the plaintiffs. The Court is accurate in its perception that the petitioners are not the only ones who benefit from the litigation and that, therefore, they should not bear the entire costs alone. But Justice Harlan elides the difficult question of who should share the costs. He ignores the fact that those who share the benefit of such "cor- porate therapeutics" are not the same people who would share the benefit of a direct judicial remedy. When the derivative action benefits the public and the shareholders of all corporations equally rather than the particular corporation specially, assessing the stockholders of the particular corporation is not necessarily the optimal solution. Given that all corporate investors share the benefit and that it is impracticable for a court to allocate the costs throughout the economic system, the Court should select the group that will bear the costs in a manner consistent with the purposes of the statute and congenial to considerations of fair- ness. Allocating the costs to the wrongdoers would further the deterrent aims of the federal securities laws 28 and at the same time avoid the inequity of charging the stockholders of a single corporation disproportionately to the benefit they receive. The Court's opinion is most troubling in its failure to define the limits of the doctrine that a substantial direct benefit to the corporation is not essential to award attorneys' fees to a plaintiff. Any derivative action to enforce any fiduciary duty, whether under federal or state law, has some therapeutic effect on the corporate system. By failing to articulate the considerations, other than the externalities of such suits, which justified the re- allocation of costs in Mills, the Court invited lower courts to award attorneys' fees in every derivative action terminating in a finding of liability. This result would encourage trivial strike suits in cases in which, unlike Mills, their cost outweighs their value as a mearns of enforcing an important statutory policy.29 27 See J.I. Case Co. v. Borak, 37 U.S. at 432. 28 If the corporation were to indemnify the directors for whatever monetary sums they were required to pay, the effect of charging the defendants with the costs of the litigation would be no different from charging them to the corporation in the first place. However, to the extent such indemnity would defeat the policy behind the allocation of costs to the wrongdoers, the indemnification agreement might be held invalid. Cf. Globus v. Law Research Service, Inc., 287 F. Supp. i88 (S.D.N.Y. i968), modified, 4i8 F.2d I276 (2d Cir. i969), cert. denied, 397 U.S. 9I3 (1970). See generally 3 Loss i83I; Note, Indemnification of Directors: The Problems Posed by Federal Securities and Antitrust Legislation, 76 HARV. L. REV. I403, I4I3 (I963). 29 The possibility that Mills may encourage strike suits is particularly disturb-</page><page sequence="217">2I8 HARVARD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 84:I The Court could have minimized this risk by specifying that courts should not award attorneys' fees except on the basis of an equitable determination that the case serves the cause of "corpo- rate therapeutics" sufficiently to justify a departure from the gen- eral rule against the award of such fees. In Mills, for instance, several factors suggested the desirability of reallocating attorneys' fees: the importance to shareholder decisionmaking of knowing all the reasons behind the directors' recommendation of the merger; the need for private actions to enforce the policy of full disclosure contained in section 14(a); and the danger, because of the improbability of a substantial direct benefit, that few private actions would be brought if the individual plaintiffs had to bear the costs. By not articulating these considerations, the Court failed to provide a rationale for excluding strike suits from the Mills rule. E. Selective Service System i. Failure to Register Not a Continuing Offense.- Upon reaching his eighteenth birthday, Robert Toussie failed to regis- ter for induction into the armed forces,' but was not indicted for this failure until two months before his twenty-sixth birthday in I967. Relying on a selective service regulation 2 and well-estab- lished precedent,3 the lower courts concluded that a failure to register was a "continuing offense" 4 and that the five year fed- eral statute of limitations ' would not begin to run until Toussie's ing in light of the Court's allocation of the costs of litigation to the corporation. If these costs had been charged to the corporate wrongdoers, the cost of trivial litigation would add to the desired deterrent effect. However, to the extent that these expenses are paid by the corporation, the award of attorneys' fees simply transfers funds from the corporate treasury to the plaintiffs' attorneys. The Court should have made it clear that such a transfer is not to be the general rule.

United States 7 reversed. In a 5-3 decision the Court held that the statute of limitations began to run when Toussie initially failed to register and that the prosecution was barred five years later after he became twen- ty-three. Writing for the Court, Mr. Justice Black argued that since the continuing offense doctrine undermines the policies of the statute of limitations, the Court should find a continuing offense only when "the explicit language of the substantive crim- inal statute," or the nature of the crime itself "comDels such a conclusion." 8 In his dissenting opinion, Mr. Justice White argued that congressional intent was sufficiently clear to override the Court's presumption against finding a continuing offense, while the presumption raised by the Court amounted to "an absolute bar to finding a continuing offense in the absence of express sta- tutory language." 9 Toussie required the Court to decide whether Congress in- tended the statutory period of limitations to run, in effect, for five years or for thirteen years from the initial failure to register at the age of eighteen.10 Contrary to the Court's conclusion in Toussie, the purposes underlying the Selective Service System suggest that Congress intended the longer period. One purpose of the selective service law is to insure that mili- tary obligations are "shared generally, in accordance with a sys- tem of selection which is fair and just." " Under Toussie, the running of the statute of limitations eliminates an individual's liability not only to registration, but also to military service. The selective service law provides that an individual "shall be liable for training and service in the Armed Forces" until the age of twenty-six,"2 but that he shall not be inducted unless he is regis- 6 4Io F.2d II56, II58 (2d Cir. i969); 280 F.

Voluntary registration frees the Selective Service authorities from what otherwise might be extensive infor- mation gathering activities.15 By reducing the likelihood that each nonregistrant will be discovered and by increasing the in- centive to evade the draft by not registering, the shorter period of limitations may compel the Selective Service, if it is to find non- registrants, to engage in the kind of data gathering activity that self-registration was intended to avoid. The Court justified its choice of the shorter period of limita- tions by stressing the purposes underlying the general federal statute of limitations.16 But the policies of repose which may support a short period of limitations for certain types of crimes have little applicability in the context of a failure to register. In criminal cases involving many factual issues, these policies suggest that potential defendants should be relieved of the need to main- tain records over a long period, muster evidence about incidents in the distant past, and locate witnesses who have disappeared or whose memories have faded. But these considerations are largely irrelevant for most defendants in Toussie's position. Since the law already requires each Selective Service registrant to keep proof of his registration "in his personal possession at all times," 17 13 50 U.S.C. App. ? 454(a) (Supp. IV, I969). 14 The Selective Service System may have the power to correct this result by establishing alternate registration procedures for individuals who fail to register voluntarily. Under its statutory authority to prescribe the "manner" in which an individual must submit to induction, 50 U.S.C. App. ? 453 (Supp. IV, i969), the system might register nonregistrants without their cooperation. Care would have to be taken, however, to avoid any implication that the alternate procedure is punitive. See Gutknecht v. United States, 396 U.S. 295 (1970), noted at p. 222 infra. Congress may of course alter the result when the Military Selective Service Act of i967 comes up for reconsideration in I97I. See 50 U.S.C. App. ? 467(c) (Supp. IV, I969) (Act expires July 3I, I97I). 15 Prior to Toussie the Selective Service System engaged in no information gathering activities of its own. Nonregistrants were typically discovered through letters written by acquaintances of the nonregistrant, or through reports from other government agencies, such as police departments or immigration authorities, which had detained individuals for reasons unrelated to registration.

For many criminal offenses a short period of limitations may also have the salutary effect of encouraging law enforcement officials to investigate and enforce the law promptly. But the Selective Service System by design is illsuited to the task of locat- ing nonregistrants.'8 Unlike most crimes, particularly violent crimes, the crime of failing to register is not likely to be noticed when it is committed. A failure to register not only establishes a violation but also conceals its existence from prosecuting author- ities. For several criminal offenses that are difficult to detect, con- cealment is a recognized basis for postponing the running of the statute of limitations until the offense is discovered.'9 In resolving the limitations question, the Court gave no weight to a Selective Service regulation providing that the obligation to register was a continuing duty.20 Thus Toussie suggests that the authority to fix the date when the statute of limitations begins to run must remain with the legislature and may not be delegated to an administrative agency. Yet the selective service law clearly delegates to the executive the authority to prescribe the time, place and manner of registration,21 and the Court expressly de- clined to hold the regulation invalid under the statutory delega- tion.22 If, as it appears, the regulation is valid, then the failure to register may still be a continuing offense for purposes such as venue,23 though it is not a continuing offense for statute of lim- itations purposes. Under Toussie, a failure to perform other Selective Service obligations which appear to be continuing may not constitute a continuing offense. Regulations require a registrant to keep a draft card and a notice of classification in his possession at all times,24 to keep his local board informed of his current status,25 18 See note I 5 supra. 19 See, e.g., MODEL PENAL CODE ?

Delinquency Status and Punitive Reclassification. - Since World War II, the Selective Service has reclassified and inducted ahead of all other registrants those whom it has declared "delin- quent" in performing their duties under the system. In Gutknecht v. United States 1 the Court found the Selective Service delin- quency regulations 2 to be unauthorized by statute and reversed the conviction of a registrant who had refused to submit to an ac- celerated induction. David Gutknecht, who was already classified I-A,3 surrendered his draft card as a gesture of opposition to the war in Vietnam. His local board declared him delinquent for failure to comply with the regulations requiring registrants to have the card in their possession at all times.4 As a result of his delinquency, Gutknecht was given, in accordance with the regu- lation,5 first priority in the order of call. Five days after notifica- tion of his delinquency, Gutknecht was ordered to report for induction.6 Upon his refusal to submit to induction he was tried and convicted 7 under the Military Selective Service Act of i967.8 The Eighth Circuit affirmed,9 but the Supreme Court, per Mr. Justice Douglas, reversed. Gutknecht is the second in a trio of cases striking down use of the delinquency regulations against registrants who had turned in their draft cards. The previous Term, Oestereich v. Selective Service System Local Board No. ii '0 held that the Selective Service was without statutory authority to use the delinquency procedure to deprive a registrant of a statutory exemption.

In none of the three cases did the Court reach the constitu- tional questions presented,'2 preferring instead to rely on statu- tory interpretation to invalidate the delinquency procedures. In Oestereich the relevant section of the Act provided that "students preparing for the ministry . . . shall be exempt from training and service." 13 This language so clearly precluded an adminis- trative denial of the exemption that the Solicitor General con- ceded the point.'4 The Government made no such concession, however, in Breen where the statute read: "[T] he President shall, under such rules and regulations as he may prescribe, pro- vide for the deferment [of full time college students]." 15 But the Court held that the President's discretion under the statute extended only to the establishment of "additional administrative procedures . . . to insure that all qualified students are given the deferment." '6 Since there were no "relevant practical or legal differences between exemptions and deferments," the Court found Oestereich controlling.'7 In both Oestereich and Breen the Court was able to point to specific statutory language which could be interpreted as inconsistent with the authorization of reclassifica- tions unrelated to the merits of registrants' claims for exemption or deferment. Gutknecht, however, was not reclassified and thus was not denied any status granted by statute. He was merely given priority in the order of call established by the regulations.'8 Of 12 See pp. 2 26-27 infra. 13Act ? 456(g). 14 Brief for Respondents at 57-58, Oestereich v.

Breen rested alternatively on the illegality of the delinquency regulations as established by Gutknecht. 396 U.S. at 465-66. If this legal error were sufficient to justify pre-induction review, without the statutory conflict, the Court may eventually adopt Mr. Justice Harlan's con- curring opinion in Oestereich wherein he argued that pre-induction review would be allowed in any case where the plaintiff alleges purely legal error in his class- ification. See 393 U.S. at 240-43. 18 At the time of Gutknecht's trial registrants were selected for induction in the following order: i) Delinquents over I9; 2) Volunteers; 3) Nonvolunteers in an order based on age and marital status. 32 Fed.

The delinquency regulations, promulgated pursuant to a gen- eral grant of rulemaking power to the President,'9 have survived two major revisions of the Act.20 While this alone may not be convincing evidence of congressional ratification of the adminis- trative construction, the delinquency regulations were explicitly noted in the legislative history of the Act,2' and in I967 a specific reference to "delinquents" found its way into the Act.22 Although a "casual mention," 23 this reference certainly indicates a famil- iarity with the regulations wholly consistent with congressional ratification.24 Indeed, the Court has often inferred ratification from far less probative evidence.25 Even disregarding the question of ratification, the Court is utterly unsuccessful in its attempt to demonstrate an affirmative conflict between a manifest congressional intent and the delin- quency regulations. The only statutory language to which Mr. Justice Douglas can point to show a congressional intent con- trary to authorization of the regulations is a general expression that selection for service be nondiscriminatory.26 Thus, the ma- jority's reading of the statute and its legislative history seem to provide a weak base for its decision.

In this light, the doctrine of clear statement may be viewed as an attempt to require Congress to take full political responsibility for decisions which approach constitutional limits.32 Yet it is hard to see how the legislative history of these provisions can shed light on the intent of the previous Congresses which reenacted the statute. 27 See generally H. M. HART &amp; A. SACKS, THE LEGAL PROCESS: BASIC PROli- LEMS IN THE MAKING AND APPLICATION OF LAW, I4I2-I3 (tent. ed. 1958). 28 An analagous doctrine of clear statement comes into play when Congress has established a fundamental legislative policy and there is a doubt concerning whether subsequent legislation is intended to alter that policy. See the discussion of Boys Markets, Inc. v. Retail Clerk's Union, Local 770, 398 U.S. 235 (I970), p. I92, supra. 29 Greene v. McElroy, 360 U.S. 474, 507 (959). 301d. at 506; Ex parte Endo, 323 U.S. 283, 299-304 (I944). 31 Green v. McElroy, 360 U.S. 474, 507 (959). 32The doctrine of clear statement may also be explained in terms of several other policies. First, it may be considered no more than a corollary of the rule that the courts will not decide the constitutional issues when a case presenting them may be disposed of on nonconstitutional grounds. Cf., e.g., Watkins v. United States, 354 U.S. I78, I98 (I957). The difficulty with this rationale is that it would support even the most disingenuous attempts to avoid constitutional ad- judication. It has nothing whatever to say concerning whether the requirement of clear statement is a legitimate nonconstitutional basis of decision. Second, the clear statement doctrine may be viewed as a natural consequence of the presumption that Congress intends to act within the limits of the Con-</page><page sequence="225">2 2 6 HARVARD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 84: I The doctrine of clear statement requires an explicit statement by Congress that its intention is to accomplish the challenged result. It is therefore not fatal to the Court's decision in Gut- kneclt that it cannot point to a specific congressional intent contrary to authorization of the delinquency regulations. But application of the doctrine in this context does require that the agency action be of questionable constitutionality.33 Although the majority fails clearly to identify the underlying constitutional issues, a number of difficult questions were presented in Gut- knecht. First, the use of the delinquency regulations against those for whom violation of a selective service duty is a protest against United States policy may infringe their first amendment rights. But the Court has already struck a constitutional balance which allows Congress to punish such "expressive conduct" as draft card burning,34 and unless the mere "turning in" of a draft card could be distinguished from the burning of it, the first amend- ment claim would have to fail. Second, the majority was troubled because the delinquency power exercised by the Service under the regulations was subject to "no statutory standard or even guidelines." 35 This language seems to echo the delegation doctrine, dormant since the Court's 1935 decision in Sckecter Poultry Corp. v. United States,36 which imposes constitutional standards for the specificity required when Congress delegates power. The delegation and clear statement doctrines are closely related; both proceed from the democratic recognition that important policy decisions should be grounded in the consent of the governed as manifested through the actions of their duly elected representatives.37 But while "a few well chosen words to serve as a standard" will now suffice to uphold stitution. See, e.g., Greene v. McElroy, 360 U.S. 474, 507 (I959). If Congress intends to act constitutionally, it would be argued, it could not intend to delegate the power to act unconstitutionally. The difficulty with this rationale is that it would only jusify application of the doctrine when the agency action was in fact unconstitutional. But the clear statement requirement does not purport to rest on a finding of unconstitutional action. Therefore it must assume a category of cases in which the challenged practice is not, in fact, unconstitutional. It is the strength of the rationale advanced in text that it explains the existence of a category of actions which Congress may take under the Constitution, but which it may take only if it makes clear its intention to do so.

But there are other difficulties. For instance, a constitutional objec- tion can be made to the procedures whereby a registrant may be declared delinquent and inducted. The place in the order of call conferred upon him by the regulations may be a great benefit to the registrant.40 Generally, due process imposes procedural re- quirements when the government moves to take away such a benefit.4' It is therefore relevant to ask what due process requires in the context of induction into the armed forces. This in turn will depend upon whether or not induction is characterized as "pun- ishment." If induction under the delinquency regulations is con- sidered "punishment" the full panoply of procedural safeguards would attach.42 On the other hand, lesser safeguards would attach if delinquency induction were held to be merely "regulatory." 43 The problem of distinguishing "punitive" from "regulatory" provisions has long plagued the Court.44 In the past, the inquiry has been conducted in terms of legislative intent.45 In the ab- sence of clear evidence as to intent, the Court has suggested, but never applied, a complex analysis which, even if applied, would yield no clear answers.46 Indeed, the difficulty of adjudicating whether or not a particular sanction is punitive by resort to ob- jective criteria may well serve as an additional justification for the Court's resort in Gutknecht to the policy of clear statement.

Still, it is an open question whether reenactment by Congress of the delinquency regulations without any additional procedural safeguards would satisfy the Court; the majority opinion does not make any suggestions as to how an acceptable, non-punitive sanction might be framed. But in a concurring opinion, Mr. Jus- tice Harlan, who also joined the Court's opinion, does attempt to do this. Indeed, in his view, reenactment would not be necessary. He indicates "that consistently with our opinion today the Presi- dent might promulgate new regulations . . . that provide for accelerated induction under the existing statute." 47 In the same vein Mr. Justice Stewart, in a separate concurrence, discusses the remedial nature of the delinquency regulations. Both Justices imply agreement with the oft-suggested argument that, appro- priately used, the delinquency procedure would be analogous to civil contempt: 48 its purpose would be to coerce compliance with selective service duties rather than to punish for past transgres- sions. Mr. Justice Stewart thought this "remedial model" to be satisfied by the regulations under review. He concurred in the Gutknecht reversal because the local board had denied the peti- tioner time for appearance or appeal, a right Mr. Justice Stewart thought to be essential to his remedial model. In Mr. Justice Harlan's view, on the other hand, a set of regulations, to satisfy the remedial model, would have "to avoid those punitive features now found to be unauthorized" by giving registrants "the right . . . to avoid any sanction by future com- pliance." 4 In light of the government's concession in Gutknecht that it would be an abuse of discretion for a local board to refuse to purge a registrant who, after having been declared delinquent, later performed his duties under the Act,50 it is hard to see why Justice Harlan believes new regulations are required, however. In any event, the civil contempt analogy raises more ques- tions than it answers. While it suggests that delinquency induc- tion may not be punitive and hence may not require full pro- cedural safeguards, it does not suggest that all safeguards may be eliminated. For example, the civil contempt sanction requires a hearing and permits representation by counsel. A delinquency procedure, such as that advocated by Justices Harlan and Stew- art, which deviates from the civil contempt procedure, cannot be justified by the analogy taken alone.

While the remedy in civil contempt imprisonment - may be considered more drastic than acceler- ated induction into the armed forces, and hence may be thought to require greater procedural safeguards, civil contempt is con- sidered necessary to expedite the judicial process. On the other hand, delinquency induction may be justified as necessary to the classification and induction of men for the armed forces. But the essence of civil contempt is that the offender is freed upon compliance.5' Do Justices Harlan and Stewart mean to suggest that in order for delinquency induction to escape classification as a "punitive" sanction, Congress must provide for the discharge of the inductee from the armed forces upon compliance with his selective service obligations? This is what the analogy suggests. An even weaker aspect of the analogy lies in the fact that contempt is a judicial proceeding whereas delinquency induction is not. There has long been in our system a "distaste for con- ferring punitive or direct enforcing powers on executive agen- cies." 52 This is expressed in the notion that judicial process may be due process when the same power vested in an agency may not be. It does not thus follow that the ability to purge oneself is a consideration determinative of whether a procedure is or is not punitive. Considering the plethora of unanswered questions raised by the civil contempt analogy, the majority may well have been prudent in avoiding an advisory opinion on congressional power under the due process clause. Congress is a more appropriate forum than is the Court for the initial consideration and formu- lation of those procedures which are really essential to raising armies. The likely result of Gutknecht is that congressional in- ertia will prevent the "vast rewriting of the Act" 5 which Mr. Justice Douglas thought necessary to the authorization of delin- quency induction. The criminal penalities which are available to enforce the Act are apt to prove adequate in time of peace. In time of war Congress may be moved to authorize a more sum- mary scheme of enforcement. Indeed, by failing to reach the constitutional issues, the Court in Gutknecht may have elected to leave open the option for Congress to accomplish under the war power a result which would have been more questionable under the power to raise armies.54 51 See Shillitani v.

Right to Conscientious Objection Classification for Ethical Opposition to War. - For the second time in a five year period,' the Supreme Court last Term in Welsh v. United States 2 ex- panded the scope of the statutory exemption from military serv- ice for conscientious objectors. In his application for exemption and in communication with selective service authorities, Welsh made it clear that his views were not traditionally religious; 3 rather his beliefs derived from a "sense of conscience," 4 aroused by discussions with friends and informed by readings in the fields of history and sociology.5 The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed his conviction for refusing to submit to induc- tion,6 finding "no religious basis" for Welsh's objection to par- ticipation in war.' In a 5--3 decision the Supreme Court reversed. Elaborating on its holding in United States v. Seeger,8 the Court concluded that deeply and sincerely held moral and ethical be- liefs may qualify a man for exemption from the draft, even though the beliefs are not considered to be "religious" by the applicant and are "founded to a substantial extent on considera- tions of public policy." 9 The four-man plurality opinion, written by Mr. Justice Black, based the decision squarely on the authority of Seeger, adopting the holding as a matter of statutory construction without reach- ing any constitutional issues. While concurring in the Court's decision, Mr. Justice Harlan argued that the result was required by the establishment of religion clause of the first amendment. Joined by two Justices in dissent, Mr. Justice White argued that Welsh was not entitled to an exemption as a conscientious ob- jector either by the terms of the statute or by the first amendment.

By expanding the statutory definition of "religious beliefs" to include moral, ethical and, to a substantial extent, political judgments,'7 Welsh forecloses several practices that developed in some lower courts as a result of the inconsistencies in the Seeger holding. Under Welsh a reviewing court may not balance the "religious" against the "secular" content of an applicant's beliefs in order to characterize them as either substantially "religious" or "essentially political, sociological, or philosophical." 18 Sim- ilarly, Welsh prohibits the practice, common in several lower courts applying Seeger,"9 of relying on an applicant's failure to use religious terminology 20 or on his express statement that his views are not religious.2' 17 Welsh has thus partially read the exclusion of "essentially political, socio- logical or philosophical views, or a merely personal moral code" out of the statute. The Court noted that the exclusions are definitional and do not therefore restrict the category of persons who are conscientious objectors . . . . Once the Selective Service System has taken the first step and determined under the standards set out here and in Seeger that the registrant is a "religious" conscientious objector, it follows that his views cannot be "essentially political, sociological, or philosophical." Nor can they be a "merely personal moral code." 398 U.S. at 343. 18 Several federal courts have disqualified applicants either on the express ground that their beliefs were "essentially" political, e.g., United States v. Morico, 4I5 F.2d I38, I4I-42 (2d Cir. i969), remanded in light of Welsh, 399 U.S. 526 (I970), or without explicitly identifying the test employed, on a comparison of the "re- ligious" and "political, sociological and philosophical" elements of the applicant's beliefs, see, e.g., Vaughn v. United States, 404 F.2d 586, 592 (8th Cir. i968), remanded in light of Welsh, 399 U.S. 526 (1970). Other federal courts, however, have read the exclusion of "essentially political, sociological, or philosophical views" to disqualify only those applicants whose "political, sociological, or philosophical" judgments were the "sole basis" for their objection to participation in war. See, e.g., Pitcher v. Laird, 42i F.2d I272, I28i (5th Cir. I970); United States v. White, 42i F.2d 487, 490-9I (5th Cir. i969); United States ex rel. Brooks v.

'" In Seeger the Court noted that Seeger had characterized his views as "re- ligious" albeit not in a traditionally theistic sense, 380 U.S. at i86-87, and stated that the self-characterization should "be given great weight." Id. at i84. In Welsh Mr. Justice Black noted that a person's characterization of his own beliefs as religious may be considered in judging the sincerity of an applicant's convictions, but an applicant's statement that his beliefs were nonreligious, made without knowledge of the Court's broad interpretation of "religious beliefs," should be disregarded. 398 U.S. at 34I. 20 Compare Vaughn v.

But at least the Welsh distinction, unlike the distinction between religious belief and political, philosophical and moral beliefs drawn in the statute, is more consistent with the basic concern of Seeger that the exemption be conditioned on beliefs that are deeply held and central to the life of the conscientious objector. Moreover, the distinction drawn in Welsh, because it explicitly states what Seeger only plausibly implied, may be more effective than Seeger in changing the administration of the selec- tive service law at the local board level.23 Although urged to do so, the Court did not base its decision on constitutional grounds. Nevertheless, the tortured construc- tion of the statute adopted by four of the Justices - a construc- tion at variance with the language and legislative history of the statute 24 - strongly suggests that the holding was dictated by a desire to avoid the establishment and free exercise difficulties that inhere in denying exemptions to men like Welsh.25 If the Welsh Bible was not written with the Universal Military Training and Service Act in mind . . . ."). 22 398 U.S. at 342-43. 23 Seeger apparently had little influence on local boards.

If the establishment and free exercise clauses of the first amend- ment prohibit the government from distinguishing between tra- ditionally religious objectors and objectors whose moral or ethical beliefs are substantially based "on considerations of public pol- icy," then government may also be prohibited from distinguishing between objectors to one war and objectors to all wars.

But when both the history of the legislation and the statutory language make the legis- lative purpose fairly clear, the doctrine should probably not be invoked. Clear tests defining when saving constructions are not appropriate, however, have not been set out by the Court. Saving constructions are impermissible, for example, when they would produce "disingenuous evasion," George Moore Ice Cream Co. v.

On the other hand, a constitutional holding in Welsh might have interfered with the executive power to conduct foreign policy and to command the armed forces, matters in which the Court has traditionally shown great deference to the executive branch.

In United States v. Davis 5 the Supreme Court resolved one dispute surrounding section 302 (b) ( i ), holding that the presence of a legitimate busi- ness purpose, as opposed to a tax avoidance motive, is irrelevant in determining dividend equivalence. Taxpayer and his wife each originally owned a one-fourth interest in a closely-held corporation. He also acquired one thousand shares of preferred stock, $25 par value, in order to increase the corporation's working capital and thereby qualify it for a Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC) loan. The taxpayer and the corporation agreed that upon repayment of the RFC loan the taxpayer's preferred shares would be redeemed. The taxpayer subsequently purchased the other half of the out- standing common shares and divided them equally between his son and daughter. Following repayment of the RFC loan in I963, the preferred shares were redeemed for $2 5,000, but the taxpayer did not report that amount as income, since he considered the redemption to be an exchange without gain within section 302 (b) (i). The Commissioner, applying the family attribution rules of section 3i8(a),6 treated the taxpayer as the sole owner of the corporation's common stock, making the redemption a pro rata distribution to the taxpayer. Since the Commissioner gen- erally considers a pro rata distribution equivalent to a dividend,7 the $25,000 received by the taxpayer was deemed subject to ordinary income tax.8 But the lower courts, finding that the transaction had a legitimate business purpose, rather than a tax avoidance motive, agreed with the taxpayer and held that the redemption qualified under section 302 (b) (i) .9 Reversing, the Supreme Court rejected the business purpose test and affirmed the Commissioner's determination. Prior to reaching the question of business purpose, however, the Court had to consider the taxpayer's threshold argument that 2 If a distribution does not qualify, it is treated as a dividend and thus taxed as ordinary income to the extent of earnings and profits, and as a reduction in basis thereafter.

If this argu- ment were accepted, the redemption would not have constituted a pro rata distribution to the taxpayer and would have qualified under section 302(b)(i) regardless of the relevance of a legiti- mate business purpose. Despite the express provision in section 302(c) 10 that the attribution rules of section 318 apply "in determining the ownership of stock for purposes of [section 302 ] ," the taxpayer argued that section 302 (c) intended sec- tion 318 to apply only to those subsections of section 302(b) which contain explicit reference to stock ownership: " that is, section 302(b)(2), which qualifies common stock redemptions that substantially reduce the shareholder's voting power, and sec- tion 302(b)(3), which qualifies redemptions that completely terminate the shareholder's interest. The Court concluded that the attribution rules should apply to questions of stock owner- ship under all provisions of section 302(b), including (b)(i).12 Indeed, as the Court recognized, to rule otherwise would nullify sections 302 (b) (2 ) and 302 (b) (3), since "if a transaction failed to qualify under [section 302(b)(2) or section 302(b)(3)] solely because of the attribution rules, it would according to the taxpayer's argument nonetheless qualify under ? 302 (b) (i) )" 13 Having carefully coupled the family attribution rules with detailed tests 14 of disproportionate redemption and termination of inter- est to limit those "safe harbors," Congress could not have in- tended to render meaningless that statutory interplay by enacting section 302 (b) (I).15 "CODE ? 302 (C).

While in such cases the lower courts had previously taken a variety of approaches 16 to evidence of business purpose in determining dividend equivalence, two basic tests had emerged. Under the strict net effect test the only relevant consideration was whether the taxpayer had received via the redemption a sub- stantially pro rata distribution.'7 By contrast, the flexible net effect test had been invoked by some courts to scrutinize the facts of a particular redemption and the motives of the taxpayer in entering into the transaction,18 and thus ascertain that the re- demption was not a tax avoidance scheme.'9 In determining the relevance of business purpose, the Court was faced with a long line of decisions 20 under the I939 Code 21 which had considered business purpose relevant in the context of have appropriately recognized that application of the attribution rules in rela- tion to section 302(b) (i) need not end the inquiry if the taxpayer can prove that the redemption brought about a change in control or a new balance of power in the corporation because of family estrangement or hostility.

The taxpayer argued that section 302 (b) (i)'s aim was to perpetuate the prior law, since it incorporated the "essentially equivalent" language of the I939 Code provi- sion.22 The Government contended that "even under the old law it would have been improper . . . to rely on 'a business purpose for the redemption' ... . 23 and that only the degree of reduc- tion in the shareholder's interest would be relevant. But the Court found it unnecessary to reach the Government's argument. Looking instead to the legislative history,24 the Court concluded that in passing section 302(b) (i) Congress intended pro rata distributions to be treated as dividends under sections 30I and 3I6 "and nothing suggests that there should be a different result if there were a 'business purpose' for the redemption." 25 The lower courts' emphasis on business purpose undoubtedly reflects a reluctance to treat even pro rata redemptions as divi- dends when such treatment would be highly unfair. While Davis appropriately disposed of the subjective inquiry into business purpose, the Court need not have sacrificed the lower courts' con- cern for fairness by limiting the inquiry in section 302(b) (i) cases to the single question of pro rata distribution. The flexible net effect test, with its emphasis on business purpose, had led the lower courts to make subjective judgments concerning the tax- payer's motives.26 By directing an inquiry into the effects of a redemption - without regard to the taxpayer's motive- to determine whether the transaction was analogous to a dividend rather than to some other sort of transaction, the Court could have avoided this difficulty without ignoring fairness. M\oreover, Congress' enactment of the "not essentially equivalent to a div- idend" test in section 302(b)(i) suggests it intended the courts to engage in just this sort of judgment by analogy under section 302(b) (i). In Davis, the creditor RFC demanded more capitalization to strengthen the corporation's financial structure. Although Davis' co-owner was unable or unwilling to provide further capital, the partners wanted to maintain their equal shares without using a subordinated debt instrument to weaken the corporation's balance sheet. The only solution was the issuance of preferred shares 22 Brief for Respondents at 9-I3. 23 397 U.S. at 3Io. 24 The Senate added subparagraph (b) (i) to the House version of the bill.

Against this background, the debt analogy appears to be much more persuasive than the dividend analogy. At the same time, the significance of the distribution's pro rata character seems insubstantial here in demonstrating dividend equivalence, since the distribution would not have been pro rata had the redemption occurred before the taxpayer purchased the other half of the outstanding common stock. Indeed, the facts of Davis are simply a variation on the com- mon practice of closely-held corporations, wishing to improve their balance sheets, which issue preferred stock to cancel debt held by a common stockholder. Since normally there is no market for the preferred shares of a closely-held corporation, the Court's decision to bar a section 302 redemption prevents the tax-free collection of what was intended to be a repayable loan. The Court could have avoided this inflexible result by investigating the effect of the particular redemption to see whether it was ana- logous to a dividend or to some other type of transaction.27 The apparent adoption of a test that focuses exclusively on the question of pro rata distribution has made it effectively impossible for a sole shareholder to qualify under section 302 (b) ( I ).28 The Court did expressly indicate, however, that sec- tion 302(b) (i) treatment would still be available to taxpayers who could show that the redemption had produced a "meaning- ful reduction [in their] proportionate interest" in the corpora- tion's stock.29 While this language was unnecessary to the deci- sion in Davis -it was clear the taxpayer had received a pro rata distribution - it has considerable importance for cases in- volving non-pro rata redemptions by closely-held corporations with multiple shareholders and multiple classes of stock.30 To 27Preferred stock redemptions have also been used by major shareholders to satisfy debts which they owe to a corporation. See, e.g., Heman v. Commissioner, 283 F.2d 227 (8th Cir. ig60); United States v. Fewell, 255 F.2d 496 (5th Cir. 1958). Here the process of analogy clearly would suggest that the redemption is equivalent to a dividend under section 302(b) (i). Provided that the taxpayer either is the sole shareholder of the corporation or in a multi-shareholder corpora- tion is not the only shareholder participating in the redemption, a transfer of shares to a corporation in return for cancellation of a debt is equivalent to pay- ment of a dividend by the corporation and repayment of the debt to the corpora- tion by the shareholder with the dividend income. And, unless the taxpayer can qualify under one of the "safe harbor" provisions of section 302(b), the transaction should be subject to ordinary income tax. 28See 397 U.S. at 314 (Douglas, J., dissenting). 29397 US. at 3I3. 3 See generally Note, Redemptions and Partial Liquidations under the I954 Internal Revenue Code: The Dividend Equivalence Test, IO3 U.

The stringent requirements imposed on common stock redemp- tions under section 302(b) (2) should not be applied to preferred stock redemptions under section 302 (b) ( i ) .3 In closely-held another context as well.

BITTKER &amp; J. EUSTICE, FEDERAL INCOME TAXATION OF CORPORATIONS AND SHAREHOLDERS 291 (2d ed. i966) (emphasis added), will surely encourage the Commissioner to challenge the series of cases and rulings which have allowed large, as well as small, share- holders to invoke section 302(b)(i). See, e.g., Commissioner v. Estate of Antrim, 395 F.2d 430 (4th Cir. i968); Himmel v. Commissioner, 338 F.2d 8I5 (2d Cir. I964); Rev. Rul. 55-462, I955-2 CUM. BULL. 22I; Rev. Rul. 56-485, I956-2 CUM.

But clearly the Court has not so limited the availability of section 302(b)(i). 31 See Commissioner v. Estate of Antrim, 395 F.2d 430 (4th Cir. i968); Him- mel v. Commissioner, 338 F.2d 8I5 (2d Cir. i964). 32 Himmel v. Commissioner, 338 F.2d 8I5 (2d Cir. i964). 3 Under the comparative dividend test, the taxpayer, according to some courts, received capital gains treatment if his redemption share is either more or less than his normal dividend share. A shareholder who disposes in a redemption of less than his proportionate share would receive less than his dividend share. Therefore, he could qualify under the comparative dividend test. See Commissioner v. Estate of Antrim, 395 F.2d 430 (4th Cir. i968); Cobb v. Callan Court Co., 274 F.2d 532 (5th Cir. I960). But see Levin v. Commissioner, 385 F.2d 52I, 527 (2d Cir. i967). But he could not qualify under the "meaningful reduction" test, since he will be left with a larger interest in the company. 3 See Himmel v. Commissioner, 338 F.2d 8I5, 820 (2d Cir. I964). 3' Computing the reduction in the taxpayer's proportionate interest in the corporation, by comparing the value of his combined stock with the value of the</page><page sequence="240">I970] THE SUPREME COURT, 1969 TERM 24I corporations preferred stock is usually a non-convertible claim for a fixed amount, and, consequently, it does not present the same opportunity for extracting regular income at capital gains rates as does common stock, whose value would, to a much greater degree, tend to reflect the corporation's retained income. More- over, a flexible "meaningful reduction" standard in section 302 (b) ( i ), in contrast to the specific standards of section 302(b) (2), provides an important vehicle for distinguishing common stock redemptions under section 302(b) (i) from preferred stock re- demptions under that same section. The test is likely to prevent abuse of section 302(b) (2) by permitting lower courts to deny section 302 (b) (i) treatment to common stock redemptions which are admittedly non-pro rata distributions, but do not in- volve a sufficient reduction in interest to qualify under section 302(b)(2). Section 302 (b) (5) 3 does, to be sure, provide that in determining dividend equivalence under section 302 (b) (i) the failure to meet the requirements of any other paragraph of section 302(b) shall not be relevant. Yet this provision surely does not prevent courts from adjusting the test under section 302(b) (i) to take account of the greater potential for tax abuse in redeeming common stock than in redeeming preferred. 2. Treatment of Bad Debt Reserves in Nonrecognition Trans- actions. -In Nash v. United States 1 the Supreme Court ad- dressed itself to the problem of the tax treatment of bad debt reserves when accounts receivable are transferred to a controlled corporation as a part of a section 35I 2 nonrecognition trans- action. Nash and his partners incorporated their financing busi- ness which, under its accrual basis system of accounting, had accounts receivable of approximately $487,000 with a bad debt reserve of approximately $73,000.3 The petitioners, relying on section 35I, considered the transaction to be without tax effect and reported no income. The Commissioner assessed a deficiency in the amount of the bad debt reserve, $73,ooo. He viewed the sale as a two-part transaction: I first, the termination of the exist- combined stock of the corporation before and after the redemption, it is obvious that many previously successful multi-class redemptions would not meet the 20% reduction required under section 302(b) (2).

In a 6-2 decision, announced by Mr. Justice Douglas, the Supreme Court rejected the Commissioner's view.6 Apparently accepting .the parties' stipulation that the reserve was reasonable 7-in other words, an accurate estimate of anticipated default on loans - the Court concluded that pe- titioners had received stock worth no more than the net value (face value less bad debt reserve) of the accounts receivable, and hence had received no taxable income. The Commissioner had argued for restoration of the reserve into income to prevent the possibility of "double deduction" 8 that is, the partnership deducting the anticipated bad debts once and the new corporation then deducting the same bad debts a second time. To avoid this result, the taxpayer proposed alterna- tive requirements. The Court either could direct the taxpayer to carry over the existing reserve to the new corporation, or could require the partnership to reduce its basis in the accounts re- ceivable and transfer them with that basis.9 While acknowledg- ing that either approach would preclude double deduction, the Commissioner contended that neither was authorized by the Code.10 The Court bypassed the question of carryover "- al- 5 The reserve represents a deduction from income for anticipated bad debt losses which have not yet occurred. Because of the termination of the business, the losses can never be realized by the partnership. Therefore, the Commissioner as- serted, the partnership must restore the reserve to income. 6 The Commissioner's view was accepted by the Tax Court in Max Schuster, 50 T.C. 98 (i968), and then by the Fifth Circuit in its consideration of Nash, 4I4 F.2d 627 (5th Cir. i969).

This conclusion, however, represents a tacit rejection of the historic tax accounting assumption 15 that a bad debt reserve does not reduce basis, since it represents only anticipated, not actual, worthlessness. Yet the Nash Court pro- vided no insight into its reasoning."6 Nash seems wholly con- sistent with "the purpose of section 35I which is to allow the incorporation of businesses without tax consequences.', 17 The Commissioner's position, by contrast, would have frustrated this purpose. Nevertheless, the Court's failure to articulate its ration- ale in Nash leaves unclear the decision's relevance for other non- recognition sections of the Code and for cases in which the con- sideration received exceeds net book value.'8 Presumably, these questions must be analyzed in terms of the desire to prevent double deduction and to accurately apportion income to the 12 See, e.g., United States v.

Of course, even if the Court has adopted under section ioi6 (a) (i) a reduced-basis approach to the transfer of reserves, Nash might be read -in light of the Court's focus upon the fact that the sale was at net value - as limited to its facts and con- sequently, as distinguishable from the section 35I transactions in which the amount received exceeds the net value.19 Still, the Court's treatment of the transaction as a sale of assets with a re- duced basis seems to render that distinction meaningless. Re- gardless of the amount received for the transfer of the accounts, the new corporation's basis under Nash would seem to be the net value -the reduced basis. And any income to the transferor in excess of the net value should not be recognizable if the intent of section 351 is to be honored. The effect, then, would be to permit taxpayers who receive consideration in excess of the net value in a section 351 trans- action to defer recognition of gain, and often to avoid individual ordinary income tax altogether.20 But any return in excess of the carry-over basis would have to be reported by the corpor- ation at ordinary tax rates. Thus, there is merely a shifting of the tax burden to the corporation, which is the normal effect of section 35I with any ordinary income item.2" The possibility of the application of Nash to other nonrecog- nition transactions such as section 337 22 liquidations raises ad- ditional questions.23 In section 337 transactions, the transferee 19 Compare Estate of Schmidt v. Commissioner, 355 F.2d iii (gth Cir. I966), with West Seattle Nat'l Bank v. Commissioner, 288 F.2d 47 (gth Cir. I96I). 20 The taxpayer's basis in the stock acquired would be the net value of the receivables transferred. See CODE ? 358. Thus, while income in excess of net value may escape ordinary taxation at the time of the tax-free exchange under section 35I, the taxpayers will have to pay capital gains tax -assuming the stock has been held for more than six months -on the gain from any sale of the stock. 21 For example, if the corporation transfers stock worth $95 for accounts re- ceivable with a net value of $90, the transferor's gain of $5 would go unrecog- nized, but the corporation would pay tax on any return (either through sale of the accounts or the collection of the debts) above $90. Thus, the tax is shifted to the corporation, which makes no gain, instead of being paid by the transferor, who received the benefit. Yet, since the transferors must own 8o% of the corporation to qualify for section 351 treatment, the tax burden is ultimately borne by essen- tially the same people, and any inequity should therefore be minor. 22 CODE ? 337 provides for tax-free sale of assets by a corporation in a plan of complete liquidation. 23 The bad debt reserve problem has been litigated most frequently in section 337 liquidations. See, e.g., J.E. Hawes Corp., 44 T.C. 705 (I965); West Seattle Nat'l Bank, 33 T.C. 341 (I959), aff'd, 288 F.2d 47 (gth Cir. I961); Rev. Rul. 57-482, I957-2 CUM. BULL. 49.</page><page sequence="244">I970] THE SUPREME COURT, I969 TERM 245 has a cost basis - rather than a carryover basis as under section 351 -in the transferred property.24 When the accounts receiv- able are transferred for net value in a section 337 liquidation, there is, to be sure, no danger of double deduction of the same bad debt, since the transferee's basis is still the net value of the receiv- ables.25 Indeed, application of the logic of Nash in this context is even more appealing than in Nash itself. In section 35i and section 337 transactions prior to Nash the transferors were re- quired to pay tax upon the amount of unused bad debt reserve yet were denied a deduction for the "loss" which resulted from the subsequent transfer.26 In section 351 transactions, though, the transferors at least benefited from their new corporation's receipt of receivables at a basis equivalent to face value; no such ultimate tax relief can ever be secured by sellers in section 337 liquidations since all interest in the transferred property is sur- rendered. Thus, the Nash approach should mean relief for what has previously been the most troubling area in the treatment of bad debt reserves in nonrecognition transactions. When the receivables are transferred for a sum in excess of net value, however, strict application of the Nash rule would create a danger of double deduction. The relevance of Nash in this context should turn on the purposes underlying sections 351 and 337. The former is intended to permit tax-free incorporation of an on-going business without a change in ownership. Section 337, on the other hand, is concerned only with preventing taxa- tion of both the corporation and the shareholder in the transfer of a business in liquidation to new owners. Yet, prior to Nash, the Commissioner always invoked the same logic to support restora- tion in the liquidation provisions as in the context of section 351, suggesting that the two were logically indistinguishable.27 But the a"CODE ? 101 2. Other liquidation sections in which Nash's impact might be felt and which also do not have carryover basis provisions are sections 331-336, and section 332 liquidations when the basis of the transferred assets is determined under section 334(b)(2). See Argus, Inc., 45 T.C. 63 (I965). Nash could also conceivably have an impact on the treatment of bad debt reserves in section 368 reorganizations where restoration has been required because of a change in accounting methods. See Treas. Reg. ? I.38i(c)(4)-I(d)(I)(iii) (I964). This case would be much like the section 351 transaction, since there is nonrecognition under section 36I and a carryover basis under section 362. See also Stoffel, Treatment of Reserve Accounts on Incorporation and Liquidation, N.Y.U. 26th ANN. INST. ON FED. TAXATION 773, 773-8I (I968). 25 For example, if the transferee corporation paid $90 for receivables with a face value of $ioo but a $90 basis ($io already having been deducted by the transferor), it could not deduct the $io again and would have to report any return above $go. 2"See cases cited notes I2 &amp; 23 supra. 27 Compare Max Schuster, 5o T.C. 98 (i968), with J.E.

At the same time, requiring restoration would not be inconsistent with the application of Nash to all transactions under section 351 (since the carryover basis rule precludes any possibility of double deduction there) and to section 337 liquidations in which the sale of receivables is at net value (since no income would escape tax- ation in such a case). 705 (I965). In one case the Tax Court has indicated that section 337 and section 35i are in fact logically indistinguishable. Max Schuster, 50 T.C. 98, IOI (i968). 28One usual line of attack by the Commissioner under section 446(b) is that the taxpayer's accounting method does not accurately reflect his income. See Family Record Plan, Inc. v. Commissioner, 3og F.2d 208 (gth Cir. i962), cert. denied, 373 U.S. 9Io (i963); Commissioner v. Kuckenberg, 3og F.2d 202 (gth Cir. i962), cert. denied, 373 U.S. 909 (i963). But this attack would not seem to be available to the Commissioner in cases like Nash, since the reserve has already been adjusted and accepted as reasonable. Nevertheless, the Commissioner might argue that accounts receivable are not the type of property covered by section 337, since the statute was intended to apply to appreciated capital assets, not to prop- erty which produces regular income. See Note, Tax-Free Sales in Liquidation Under Section 337, 76 HARV. L. REV. 780, 790 (I963). And while the Commissioner has always insisted that accounts receivable were within section 337 in loss situa- tions, see J.E. Hawes Corp., 44 T.C. 705 (i965), the Court's rejection of his two- part analysis of the treatment of bad debt reserves in nonrecognition transactions should leave him free to abandon that position. 29There have been prior judicially-created exceptions to nonrecognition under section 337. See Commissioner v. Anders, 4I4 F.2d I283 (ioth Cir.), cert. denied, 396 U.S. 958 (i969). " The gain the shareholder recognizes in the liquidation, if any, depends on his basis for the stock he exchanges in liquidation, and the nature of the gain depends on whether the stock is a capital asset in his hands. 31 For example, if the purchaser paid $95 for receivables with a face value of $ioo and a net value of $90, his basis would be $95. Thus, if the purchaser received less than $95 for the receivables, he could deduct his losses, even though the decline in value from $95 to $90 had been deducted once before. On the other hand, any recovery between $90 and $95 would not be reported since it is merely a return of investment to the purchaser, even though these debts have been de- ducted as losses by the seller.</page><page sequence="246">I970] THE SUPREME COURT, I969 TERM 247 V.

Mr. Justice Blackmun did not participate in the consideration or the decision during the Term of any cases decided by the Court on full opinion. He did, however, take part in the decision of a few memorandum orders. In fact, in Hoyt v. Minnesota, 399 U.S. 524 (I970), joined by Mr. Justice Harlan and Mr. Chief Justice Burger, he wrote his first opinion as a member of the Court, dissenting from the Court's summary per curiam reversal of the Supreme Court of Minnesota's decision that certain materials were obscene as a matter of law. 2See Table II n.a; Table III n.a infra. 3 United States v.

"T" represents the total agreements in "O" and "S."

"P" represents the percentage of time that one Justice has agreed with another Justice, as calculated by dividing "T" by "N." Some distortion is present in the table, however, because of the method used in recording agreements in separate opinions. When the same Justices join in more than one concurrence or dissent, and when two or more Justices concur in the same separate opinion and join the opinion of the Court, each separate agreement is noted but only one decision is counted. Thus it is theoretically possible for two Justices to agree more times than the number of decisions in which they participated together. Two Jus- tices are considered to have voted together whenever they join in the same opinion, as indicated either by the reporter or by the explicit statement of a Justice in the body of his own opinion. hA decision is considered unanimous only when all Justices hearing the case voted to concur in the Court's opinion as well as its judgment. Where one or more Justices concurred in the result but not in the opinion, the case is not considered unanimous. 253</page><page sequence="253">2 54 HARVARD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 84: I and occasionally intense debate over many of last Term's seven- teen jurisdictional decisions.7 In addition to deciding approximately the same number of cases by full opinion as in the previous Term, the Court also heard oral argument in four more cases than the year before.8 And in spite of a considerable increase in the number of applica- tions for review ' coupled with the absence of a ninth Justice, the Court managed to close the Term with only a marginal in- crease over the previous Term in the number of cases left on the docket undecided.10 Table III(B), which records the number of instances in which one Justice agrees with another, is of particular interest this year in view of recent changes in the Court's personnel. In his first year on the Court, Chief Justice Burger agreed with Mr. Justice Douglas on fewer occasions than any other two Justices agreed. At the same time, the Chief Justice agreed most often with Justices Harlan and Stewart. The highest frequency of agreement was achieved by Justices Brennan and Marshall. (In- deed, Mr. Justice Marshall agreed with his colleagues a larger percentage of the time than any other Justice.") In general, the Tables were compiled this year in much the same fashion as previous years.'2 The only major change con- two dissenting votes were registered, suggesting the degree of controversy stirred by the four cases. 7 See, e.g., United States v. Sisson, 399 U.S. 267 (1970) (three separate opinions covering 82 pages of the United States Reports); Chandler v. Judicial Council of the Tenth Circuit, 398 U.S. 74 (I970) (four separate opinions covering 69 pages of the United States Reports); Taggart v. Weinacker's, Inc., 397 U.S. 223 (I970) (four separate opinions covering I2 pages of the United States Reports). The I7 cases covered a total of 244 pages in the United States Reports, for an average of I4 pages per case. By comparison, the four cases in the previous Term covered only I2 pages in the United States Reports for an average of three pages per case. 8 "In the I968-69 Term, I40 cases were argued orally; in the I969-70 Term, just ended, the Court heard oral arguments in I44 cases." Supreme Court of the United States Press Release 2 (July 20, I970). ' The number of applications rose from 3,9I8 in the October, I968 Term, to 4,202 last Term. Id. at i. 10There were 793 cases remaining on the original, appellate, and miscellaneous dockets at the end of the I969 Term in comparison to 767 cases at the end of the I968 Term and 6I3 cases at the end of the I967 Term. " Mr. Justice Marshall's average percentage agreement with each other Justice was 74.3%. The lowest average percentage agreement was scored by Mr. Justice Black, who agreed with each other Justice an average of only 58.6% of the time. Following Mr. Justice Marshall, the average percentage agreements with each other Justice were, in descending order, 70.2% for Mr. Justice White, 68.i% for Mr. Justice Brennan, 67.5% for Mr. Justice Stewart, 66.2% for Mr. Justice Harlan, 62.4% for Chief Justice Burger, and 6I.5% for Mr. Justice Douglas. 12 For a detailed explanation of how the various tables are compiled, see The Supreme Court, I967 Term, 82 HARV.

In I964 this Table was re- designed to permit its preparation from statistics compiled an- nually by the Administrative Office of the United States Courts,13 but that office has during the past year redesigned its own compi- lations and altered its categorization of the Court's work. Rather than changing Table I once again to harmonize it with the Administrative Office's method of compilation, the Review has chosen to continue Table I in its previous form and supply cer- tain entries independently. As a result, the compilation of much of Table I, as in the case of Tables II and III, now requires a careful examination of the published reports of all of the Supreme Court's work. The only significant structural change in the Tables is the addition of percentage figures in Table III(B), to show more readily the number of times any two Justices agreed as a per- centage of the total number of occasions on which they might have agreed. 13 The Supreme Court, 1963 Term, 78 HARV.
