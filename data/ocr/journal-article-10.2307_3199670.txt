<plain_text><page sequence="1">Elizabeth Bishop and The Act of Seeing MARY J. ELKINS M ANY CRITICS writing about the poetry of Elizabeth Bishop find themselves, even today, obliged to make a case for her importance, her status as a major poet, to argue, implicitly if not explicitly, that she is more than an "exquisite miniaturist"' with a remarkable eye for detail, that she is, in fact, concerned with much larger issues, issues of great human and spiritual significance. The criterion of "significance" is, of course, applied to all artists, but it becomes somewhat more problematic in the case of such poets as Bishop who seem to steer determinedly away from explicit state- ments of cosmic concerns. Compounding the problem in Bishop's case are the relative smallness (for a major poet) of her total literary output and possibly even the absence of biographical drama. Bishop's strengths and weaknesses begin to seem as two sides of a coin. Everyone credits her with mastery and exactitude in her depiction of minute descriptive detail, but those who would con- sider her a major poet sometimes find themselves arguing that certain important lines or images do not constitute "mere descrip- tion," or that "on the surface" a given poem "seems no more than the work of the famous eye," but below the surface contains so much more.2 An occasional critic will suggest that Bishop be judged differently, that she is no "visionary," that her expectations are lower, quieter, but that these qualifications do not invalidate her claim to reputation and status.3 Whatever the position, the critic seems to be on the defensive from the start. As others have pointed out, the notion of significance in poetry is tied to the expectation on the reader's part of internal cohesion</page><page sequence="2">Mary J. Elkins and unity.4 We ask that the poem hold together and be organized around some greater shaping principle; our understanding of what the poem says, what grasp of the universe it offers us, grows out of our apprehension of this unity. Readers find this unity in Bishop's work, particularly her later work, generally in what they see as a dialectic between the world evoked through her everyday imagery and a world whose signifi- cance is more pronounced. Helen Vendler, for example, speaks of the "continuing vibration of her work between two frequencies- the domestic and the strange."5 Vendler suggests that the strange and the domestic are inseparable; the strange seems to exist within the apparently harmless domestic. And the power of the poetry rests ultimately on Bishop's "equal apprehension of the reserves of mystery which give in their own way a joy more strange than the familiar blessings of the world made human."6 Vendler does not see a total antithesis between domestic and strange, but her essay suggests the necessity of some definitive resolution of their con- flict, apparently in favor of the strange. She says in her conclusion, Beyond or behind the familiar, whether the visual or the human familiar, lies the perpetually strange and myste- rious. It is that mystery which causes those whispered exclamations alternating with the pained "Yes" pro- voked by human vicissitude. It guarantees the poet more to do. On it depends all the impulse to domestica- tion. Though the human effort is bent to the elimination of the wild, nothing is more restorative than to know that earthly being is larger than our human enclosures.7 Convincing though this is, ultimately it relies, however subtly, on a devaluation of the domestic imagery and concerns which are at the heart of Bishop's poetry, subsuming them in the more signifi- cant "strange." Perhaps there may be other approaches to the unity of the poetry of Elizabeth Bishop, approaches which would not force the reader into this sort of position. We might take a clue from Kenneth Burke and look at his analysis of Keats' "Ode on a Grecian Urn." Keats' poem would seem to invite an analysis based on the binary opposition between truth and beauty which is transcended and apparently resolved at the poem's conclusion. However, Burke treats the poem as embodying not so much an opposition as a 44</page><page sequence="3">South Atlantic Review series, a series of internal transformations. Moreover, these trans- formations lead somewhere. The poem is not static. As Burke explains, "For a poem is an act, the symbolic act of the poet who made it-an act of such a nature that, in surviving as a structure or object, it enables us as readers to re-enact it."8 Such a "dramatistic" analysis might be of great use for Bishop's poetry, for the critical tendency is to see her as a static observer of life around her, one who records and puzzles over but makes no moves, the delicate observant map-maker who "drifts rather than divides, gazes rather than chooses."9 Bishop uses the word "gaze" herself and with quite different connotations. In the light of these remarks, it is worth considering some comments of Bishop's on Darwin: I can't believe we are wholly irrational-and I do admire Darwin-. But reading Darwin one admires the beauti- ful solid case being built up out of his endless heroic observations, almost unconscious or automatic-and then comes a sudden relaxation, a forgetful phrase, and one feels that strangeness of his undertaking, sees the lonely man, his eyes fixed on facts and minute details, sinking or sliding giddily off into the unknown. What one seems to want in art, in experiencing it, is the same thing that is necessary for its creation, a self-forgetful, perfectly useless concentration.'0 (Italics mine) Bishop's vision of Darwin here is easy to identify with our impres- sion of Bishop herself, her eyes "fixed on facts and minute details." Here this behavior is characterized as "heroic observation"-noth- ing minor or mere about it. And in this context, "gazing off" into space, what we would usually consider daydreaming or wool- gathering, is the pre-condition for insight. The idea of "seeing" in all its forms is central to Bishop's poetry; seeing is an act, beginning somewhere, moving forward and ending somewhere. It is this act of seeing that is dramatized throughout her work. This idea has been recognized and discussed by many if not most critics, but as a rule, these critics are uncom- fortable with the mere seeing and claim for her a "distinctive imaginative vision," something other than literal vision." It is this critical devaluation of the everyday realities and the 45</page><page sequence="4">Mary J. Elkins movement (as rapid as possible) past the objective and into the "imaginative" that I am questioning here. Just as seeing in Bishop's poetry is an act, not stasis, so too the seer is not a passive recipient; he or she is an active participant, a quester. Paradoxically, however, the act of seeing appears to require a motionlessness and sometimes an arresting of time. To see actively and intensely involves, as the remarks on Darwin would indicate, stillness and the appearance of no activity at all. Suspension and motionlessness are common threads in her poetry. The fish, in its famous poem, is suspended, half in and "half out of water,"12 while the speaker contemplates it. In "At the Fishhouses," we find these lines, ... The water seems suspended above the rounded gray and blue-gray stones. I have seen it over and over, the same sea, the same, slightly, indifferently swinging above the stones, icily free above the stones, above the stones and then the world. (The Complete Poems, p. 74) The state of suspension is the necessary condition for the act of seeing; creating this state is the role played by the imagination. Once the condition is realized, as at the beginning of "The Fish," then the poet can begin to "look" and to "stare.' In "Questions of Travel," the poet speaks of "mile-long shiny tearstains" changing into waterfalls "in a quick age or so," (The Complete Poems, p. 107), denying the importance of time's passing and preparing us to "stare at some inexplicable old stonework,/inexplicable and impen- etrable,/at any view." Gradually, under the pressure of all this staring, the impenetra- ble begins to yield a bit. The detail for which Bishop is so justly praised is a consequence of the act of seeing, the more than ordinary attention she pays to her object. Holding the fish, motion- less, frozen in time, she begins, like Darwin, her heroic observa- tions, recording the details: "his brown skin," the presence of barnacles, of "tiny white sea lice," the seaweed hanging from him. The detail is ordinary. It can be seen with ordinary eyes. What is extraordinary is the concentration, the will to see. The poet moves almost immediately from the recording of detail to the recording of the analogies her perceptions suggest to her. 46</page><page sequence="5">South Atlantic Review The brown skin of the fish, . . hung in strips like ancient wallpaper, and its pattern of darker brown was like wallpaper: shapes like full-blown roses stained and lost through age. It is important to note that this does not represent a movement away from the object described and into another sphere. As David Kalstone says, "It should be clear that when Miss Bishop writes about nature, about objects, about experiences, it is with a very strong sense of their intractability and challenge.""3 Rather, the seeing takes on a life of its own, and the poet moves to what Jerome Mazzaro called "relational awareness."14 Another early poem, "The Map," contains a well-noted analogy of a similar sort. The poet, looking at the map, says, These peninsulas take the water between thumb and finger like women feeling for the smoothness of yard-goods. (The Complete Poems, p. 3) In one of Bishop's last poems, "In the Waiting Room," the child in the poem "studied the photographs" in National Geographic and saw, black, naked women with necks wound round and round with wire like the necks of light bulbs.15 Through the use of similes, the poet is able to remain in the area of everyday realities, moving to a second level while carrying the first level along. These are transformations rather than substitutions, and it is this form of movement which allows Bishop to return in the end with no sense, on the reader's part, of having been separated from the starting point. The object is not an objective correlative; it remains itself throughout. What these similes quoted above have in common is that, like so much of the other imagery in Bishop's poetry, they have a notice- able domestic cast. The next step in the seeing process would seem 47</page><page sequence="6">Mary J. Elkins to be domestication: seeing requires motionlessness or suspension; with this condition met, seeing produces "heroic observation" and recording of details; the details become transformed into similes and analogies whose domestic nature facilitates "relational aware- ness," or, more simply put, another level of understanding. The domestic imagery functions by and large to establish a bond between the perceived object and the perceiver. It is no wonder then that certain favorite, familiarizing words recur throughout Bishop's poetry. "Homely" is an important one. The fish is "bat- tered and venerable/and homely . ." The monument in the poem of the same name has also been battered by the elements: -The strong sunlight, the wind from the sea, all the conditions of its existence, may have flaked off the paint, if ever it was painted, and made it homelier than it was. (The Complete Poems, p. 27. Italics mine) The moose who appears to a busload of travelers in Geography III is described as Towering, antlerless, high as a church, homely as a house (or, safe as houses). (Geography III, p. 29) "Homely" becomes associated with safe, "harmless" as one passenger assures another. It is worth noting that this safe, homely moose has emerged from "the impenetrable wood" and appears to the speaker as "otherworldly" beyond the limitations of time and space. The fish too, in addition to being homely is, as noted, "battered and venerable." Throughout Bishop's poetry, these characteristic qualities recur, and they occur in tandem. For the most part, aging and decay carry positive, not negative, connota- tions. Whatever is worth watching has been around for some time. The fish whose skin is like "ancient wallpaper" is carrying with him "five old pieces of fish-line," hanging from his mouth, Like medals with their ribbons frayed and wavering, 48</page><page sequence="7">South Atlantic Review a five-haired beard of wisdom trailing from his aching jaw. The monument, as we have seen, is "cracked and unpainted," and of it the poet says, An ancient promontory, an ancient principality whose artist-prince might have wanted to build a monument to mark a tomb or boundary, or make a melancholy or romantic scene of it ... The speaker in "At the Fishhouses," describes an "ancient wooden capstan," cracked, with two long bleached handles and some melancholy stains, like dried blood, where the ironwork has rusted and the "black old knife" of the old fisherman, "the blade of which is almost worn away." The positive associations of "weathering" grow out of the close connections established between "weath- ering" and familiarity; "weathering" seems to indicate, to be associated with, the idea of communion between man and object, a relationship. The importance of this relationship is stunningly shown in "Crusoe in England." In this poem, Robinson Crusoe is looking at his old knife, so important to him in his shipwrecked days: The knife there on the shelf- it reeked of meaning, like a crucifix. It lived. How many years did I beg it, implore it, not to break? I knew each nick and scratch by heart, the bluish blade, the broken tip, the lines of wood-grain on the handle ... Now it won't look at me at all. The living soul has dribbled away. My eyes rest on it and pass on. (Geography III, p. 17) 49</page><page sequence="8">Mary J. Elkins The contact that Crusoe seeks here is quite similar to that sought by the poet in "The Fish" when she says that she "looked into his eyes" and "They shifted a little, but not/to return my stare." Her attempt to make contact with the fish, her version of begging and imploring it, is a gradual process dramatized through the poem. Her analogies of wallpaper and roses mentioned before lead her, through their suggestion of familiarity, to look even more closely. When she does, she records these details: While his gills were breathing in the terrible oxygen -the frightening gills, fresh and crisp with blood, that can cut so badly. Here she has moved from description to empathy. The oxygen is "terrible" to him, the gills are "frightening" to her. The juxtaposi- tion of these adjectives, the blending of suggestion of suffering for the fish whose gills are "crisp with blood," the same gills that can "cut so badly," with the potential suffering of the speaker high- lights the sympathetic identification here. The identification con- tinues as she, through imagination, moves inside the fish to his "coarse white flesh," his bones, and finally "the pink swim-blad- der/like a big peony." From here it is a small step to looking into his eyes and perhaps expecting a recognition which, like Crusoe, she does not get. The resistance of the fish is central; it remains itself, and the poet, regardless of degree of sympathetic identification, remains aware of the otherness of the fish. She continues to anthropomor- phize, speaking of the fish's "sullen face" and "lower lip," but then immediately reminds herself of the gap between them, add- ing, "-if you could call it a lip." The fish is itself unchanged, but movement is taking place within the poet. Her attitude has shifted from "scientific" disinterested observation to admiration ("I ad- mired his sullen face"), and her images and analogies for the fish, while not abandoning the domestic, take on aspects of the heroic: Like medals with their ribbons frayed and wavering, a five-haired beard of wisdom trailing from his aching jaw. 50</page><page sequence="9">South Atlantic Review In these four lines, Bishop brings together all the earlier threads or motifs, including the weathered ("frayed") and the sympathetic identification ("his aching jaw") and imbues the everyday with its appropriate heroism and significance. There is no doubt that what she is looking at is worth the effort. Bishop's letting the fish go at the end of the poem is often taken as anthropomorphism, environmental politics, or sentimentality. But the conclusion makes clear the weaknesses of such readings. As the poem comes to its conclusion, her looking at the fish becomes more intense. Now she says, "I stared and stared," just as Darwin before her kept his eyes "fixed on fact." And like Darwin, she finds that this steady "self-forgetful, perfectly useless concen- tration" allows her to slide "giddily off into the unknown." The inside of her rented boat with its bilge and oil slick, rusted engine and parts, all are transformed into "rainbow, rainbow, rainbow!" Her concentration has allowed her to take a step beyond, a step which would have been impossible without that apparently unre- lated attention to detail. Keeping one's eyes fixed on facts is the equivalent of a religious person's preparing himself, through fast- ing and discipline, to receive an infusion of the Spirit. The fasting does not necessarily call forth the spirit; it ensures that the seed will fall on fertile ground. The poet says, significantly, "And I let the fish go," not "So I let the fish go." It is not a sentimental gesture; the fish has served its turn, elicited respect for itself and attention to detail and retained its integrity. It can be let go but not of necessity. To summarize: the movement of the poem is as follows. In a state of suspended time and motion, the poet observes and records her observations; relationships begin to suggest themselves through simile and analogy, and the poet moves from disinterestedness to involve- ment; the greater involvement produces a more intense observa- tion ("I stared and stared"); the rewards of such prodigious looking can be a transformation of the ordinary into the other- worldly, and the poet rises through and above the immediate experience. The road to the extraordinary absolutely requires im- mersion in the ordinary. In "At the Fishhouses," the speaker describes a seal, a frequenter of the place, as quite curious and "like me, a believer in total immersion." What the vision is remains mysterious; in "The Fish," its wonder is only suggested through repetition and punctuation and not spelled out. In other poems, Bishop seems to suggest a tantalizing 51</page><page sequence="10">Mary J. Elkins and elusive vision reminiscent of the visions in such poems of Robert Frost's as "The Most of It" and "For Once, Then, Some- thing." "At the Fishhouses" is one of those poems. It is worth considering since its internal movement is in a slightly different direction from that of "The Fish." The poem begins with a description of the atmosphere and appearance "down by one of the fishhouses"; the night is cold, and "The air smells so strong of codfish/it makes one's nose run and one's eyes water." Approximately the first twelve lines are given over to the recording of these sensual details. But then Bishop quickly introduces images of beauty and significance. "All is silver," she tells us: All is silver: the heavy surface of the sea, swelling slowly as if considering spilling over, is opaque, but the silver of the benches, the lobster pots, and masts, scattered among the wild jagged rocks, is of an apparent translucence. She introduces the idea of seeing in an oblique way here, telling us that the surface of the sea is "opaque" while the coloring of smaller, more easily defined objects is "of an apparent translu- cence." "Apparent" may be a loaded word here, but the opacity of the sea will eventually lead her to take a closer look. The beauty of the sea and land clothed in silver is enhanced further by such images as "the small old buildings with an emerald moss/growing on their shoreward walls." The "beautiful herring scales" line the inside of the fishing tubs and wheelbarrows, an effect Bishop describes as "iridescent coats of mail." Even the flies are "iridescent" and the herring scales will later become "sequins" on the old man's vest and thumb. All this shimmering beauty exists necessarily side by side with the cracked capstan and the rusted ironwork. The speaker moves to the water's edge for closer observation and finds the water not opaque but "Cold dark deep and abso- lutely clear,/Element bearable to no mortal,/to fish and seals .. ." The fish and seals become, then, distinguished from mortals and identified with the element. The speaker recalls the seal she used to meet there, the believer in total immersion, who "stood up in the water and regarded me." Unlike the fish, this representative of 52</page><page sequence="11">South Atlantic Review the "other" does look back at her, if only for a moment, before disappearing and re-emerging. Returning to her consideration of the water, she repeats her description: "Cold dark deep and absolutely clear." The repetition signals a deepening of concentration, and only now does the suspension in time and space begin ("The water seems suspended/ above the rounded gray and blue-gray stones."). In this state the element takes on the qualities of other elements. She tells us that its coldness would burn your hand "as if the water were a transmutation of fire" and If you tasted it, it would first taste bitter, then briny, then surely burn your tongue. Finally, though, this is as far as she can go; the water is both "dark" and "clear," withholding as well as revealing. Bishop's conclusion is quite specific here, and again reminiscent of these lines of Frost's: Water came to rebuke the too clear water. One drop fell from a fern, and lo, a ripple Shook whatever it was lay there at bottom, Blurred it, blotted it out. What was that whiteness? Truth? A pebble of quartz? For once, then, something.'6 Bishop too notes the rebuking of water by water and says, It is like what we imagine knowledge to be: dark, salt, clear, moving, utterly free, drawn from the cold hard mouth of the world, derived from the rocky breasts forever, flowing and drawn, and since our knowledge is historical, flowing, and flown. The movement of the poem ends with this recognition of knowl- edge's elusiveness but also with an assertion of its origin in the observation of the everyday ("drawn from the cold hard mouth/of the world. . ."). Whatever possibilities exist for understanding, they depend on looking, as Frost says, "beyond the picture/ through the picture."'7 One way or another, all of Bishop's poems dramatize this act of 53</page><page sequence="12">Mary J. Elkins seeing. The late poems, particularly those in Geography III, have an added distancing on the details provided by personas such as Robinson Crusoe and by memory. In the opening poem of the volume, "In the Waiting Room," the poet remembers herself as a child in a dentist's waiting room. The child's studying of National Geographic's exotica and close observation of and recording of the sensations of the waiting room push her against her will, with her "eyes glued to the cover" of the magazine, into the unknown where, she says, "I knew that nothing stranger/had ever hap- pened,..." She and her aunt blend together, and she does whatever she can to resist the loss of self: I said to myself: three days and you'll be seven years old. I was saying it to stop the sensation of falling off the round, turning world. The waiting room seems to be "sliding/beneath a big black wave,/ another, and another." Then suddenly, since knowledge is "flow- ing and flown," she is "back in it" as she says, and the poem ends with a recitation of the "facts," a concentration on which made possible the unsettling and frightening trip into the unknown: The War was on. Outside, in Worcester, Massachusetts, were night and slush and cold, and it was still the fifth of February, 1918. In this case, the "child I was" grows into the poet whose most distinctive characteristic is "heroic observation" prefigured in this child's experience. For Bishop, then, seeing is not just a metaphor; it is the poet's work; it is the only strategy possible in a search for some larger truth. It is equally clear that, for Bishop, this is the artist's role. In a late poem, entitled simply "Poem," the speaker describes a small painting, "a minor family relic" (Geography III, p. 36). In this painting, as in all artifacts, time and motion are suspended, and the viewer can look and look at leisure. Art provides the necessary suspension, the precondition for insight. The longer the speaker 54</page><page sequence="13">South Atlantic Review looks, the more relationships she perceives. "It must be Nova Scotia," she says as she begins to recognize certain details of architecture and environment; and, then, this: Heavens, I recognize the place, I know it! The houses and barns take on names and significance: . . The hint of steeple, filaments of brush hairs, barely there, must be the Presbyterian church. Would that be Miss Gillespie's house? She moves on, having considered carefully each detail and specu- lates on the human experience common to both the artist (whom she did not know) and herself. She says, Our visions coincided-"visions" is too serious a word-our looks, two looks: art "copying from life" and life itself, life and the memory of it so compressed they've turned into each other. Which is which? Again, we find the emphasis on looking, or the more portentous word, "visions," as it leads to some grasp of "life and the memory of it." Again the road is paved with attention to detail; she says of the painting: Life and the memory of it cramped, dim, on a piece of Bristol board, dim, but how live, how touching in detail -the little that we get for free, the little of our earthly trust.... Fittingly, the poem ends with a return to the detail and to a Keatsian image of suspended and incipient act: "the yet-to-be-dis- mantled elms, the geese." Art, then, is seeing at its most intense and intentional. The artist's role is of great importance in holding the moment sus- pending the object, allowing for the all-important observation. As she says in "The Monument," 55</page><page sequence="14">Mary J. Elkins . .. .Wood holds together better than sea or cloud or sand could by itself, much better than real sea or sand or cloud. The monument in this poem is shabby, weatherbeaten and not immediately accessible; it requires some study before it gives up its message. But like the jar in Tennessee, it commands attention. The poem begins with a question: "Now can you see the monument?" and ends with a directive: But roughly but adequately it can shelter what is within (which after all cannot have been intended to be seen) It is the beginning of a painting, a piece of sculpture, or poem, or monument, and all of wood. Watch it closely. Florida International University NOTES 1See M.L. Rosenthal's discussion of Bishop and Richard Wilbur in The Modern Poets (New York: Oxford University Press, 1960), pp. 252-55.
