<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE SPIRITUAL ELEMENT IN HISTORY. By Robert W. McLaughlin. New York: The Abingdon Press, 1926. 312. pp. $2.5o. This is one of the most important books of late years devoted to the question of the interrelation of history and religion. The present President of the American Historical Association, Henry Osborn Taylor, in his Freedom of the Mind in History presented the effort of an historian to evaluate the spiritual element, while Dr. McLaughlin, as an enlightened stu- dent of religious phenomena, has executed an equally significant attempt to indicate the value of his studies in this field for the understanding of some of the most vital issues and problems of historical science. The spiritual is defined by Dr. McLaughlin in the following terms: "The spiritual is the perception of the idea lifted to the level of the ideal by the power of emotion and applied to the things of life." Taking this as his starting-point, the author logically and lucidly states the assumptions underlying the spiritual interpretation of history, and the difficulties and limitations im- posed upon this point of view by the well established facts of physical and human nature and by the nature and processes of human history in the past. He then brings together the evidence which he believes to be adequate to establish the validity of the spiritual interpretation of historical development. It will prob- 480</page><page sequence="2">LIBRARY AND WORKSHOP 48I ably be best to let the author state his own position, something which he has done in admirable fashion in several illuminat- ing summaries throughout the book: Enough has been said to indicate the trend of tlhought in the chapters of this book. To gatlher this up in a few sentcnces, the statement is as follows: The gencral thought is suggested by the question, Is it possible for the historian to reach a conclusion regarding the final meaning of history? This ques- tion is considered under the influence of two modcrn ideas: one is the democratic idea of maii as the cen- tral fact in history; the other is the evolutionary idea of all crcation including history as the expression of energy. The first of these ideas leads at once to the fascinating question of a goal toward which man in history is moving. The second of these ideas inevit- ably raises the question of a Vast Mind Energy behind and working through history. One more fact which justifies the discussion un- dertaken in this book is the connection between the question of the final meaning of history and a funda- mental belief of religion. The fundamental belief, stated in its simplest terms, is that God cares about man. If God cares, then human nature no less than physical nature is the tak- ing shape in time and space of a glorious purpose that exists in the mind of God. In other words, the ques- tion of history and its final meaning is but the histori- cal statement of a problem, which in theology is the problem of Divine Providence. History we have thought of as the varied aspects of three forms of energy-physical, mental, and spirit- ual. According to the answers given by Marx, Hegel, and Augustine to the question Why? some one of these forms of energy is the determining factor in history to the exclusion of the two other forms of energy which exist as conditioning influences. These forms of energy, regardless of the question as to which one of them is the determining factor, have meaning in history only as found in the person. For the person (individual or collective) is central in history, and tthe task of the historian is to recapture the processes of the past, in order to find the person. This is the answer to the qulestion, How? While these two questions, Why? anid How? indicate our desire to un- derstand history, we have not allowed this desire to interfere with the attempt to know what history is. So in the third chapter we turned to the actual page of history to find there an answer to the What? This answer shows that evidence exists to support the claim that each of tlhese forms of energy in a consider- ablc nunmbcr of outstanding events is a determining factor; that is, no single form of energy, to the exclu- sion of the other forms, as Marx, Hegel, and Augus- tine believed, is dominant in history. Then, it was pointed out, that in the study of history to-day cer- tain assumptions are accepted as reasonable. These are: a sequence of events, a unity pervading all events, and a progress traceable through events. These assumptions lead to a fourth assumption-God. Although accepted as reasonable by the poet, philoso- pher, and scientist, the historian finds it difficult to accept this assumption. The historian, then, unlike the poet, philosopher, and scientist, does not accept this fourth assumption of God in history. Compared with the scientist the work of the historian as regards this assumption is much less favorable. Strange as it may seem, this is because the historian deals with the person, whereas the scientist deals with nature below the level of the person. In dealing with the recorded acts of the person on certain landscapes of history-long-range sequences of events-the historian finds much that is either baffling, disheartening, or not suggestive of God. Among such landscapes are the following: The juxtapositions in history making for and against righteousness; the periods that seem adequately ex- plained by the play of physical and mental forms of energy, apart from the spiritual as a form of energy; the appearance of stupenduous movements the origins of which are found in the lowering of spiritual stand- ards; and the failure for long stretches of time of beneficent ideals that have resulted in untold suffer- ing. Such, then, are the facts in the two groups. In the first group are facts reminding us of the limitations under which the historian necessarily does his work: the defective medium through thich the person who is central in history expresses himself, the inherent warp of the human mind which is intensified in the mind of the historian because he seeks the meaning of persons like himself; the vast extension of the time element due to the genetic conception, also the find- ings in other fields of knowledge; and the meagerness of the material at the disposal of the historian. In the second group are facts giving added significance to history: The adaptability of the earth to the needs of man; the evidence of law in history, no less than in nature; the presence of a mysterious timeless element in history; the persons in history as a religious being; and the value of the catastrophic as evidence of progress. These two groups of facts thus brought together do not give conclusive proof of this fourth assumption -God in history. The difficulties remain and indi- cate that from the events of history this proof cannot be adduced. But the first group of facts justified our</page><page sequence="3">482. SOCIAL FORCES caution in accepting as final the historian's negative conclusion regarding this great assumption. The second group of facts as placed over against the difficul- ties found by the historian lead us to believe that a denial of the assumption seems less reasonable than its affirmation. Now bring together these two facts about Christ- the perfect character and the perfect teaching, which constitute the two supreme events of historv. The question arises, What havc these two facts to do with the fourth assumption-God? .... We accept the assumption of God in history as an act of faith-faith in Christ. This seems to me rea- sonable. To take any other position would be utterly unreasonable. For in history the two astouniding events are the absolute perfection of his character and the absolute perfection of his teaching. These two unparalleled facts in history give to anything Christ may say about history an authority beyond any passing authority possessed by the scribes either in the first or the twentieth centuries. The reviewer entertains only the highest admiration for the lofty sentiments, the nobility of outlook and the intellectual integrity which pervade all parts of the work. Yet there are several vital issues which must be raised. Perhaps the most far-reaching challenge which can be offered to the thesis of the book is the problem of the validity of the funda- mentally geocentric and anthropomorphic conceptions upon which the book and all similar works are of necessity based. The most deadly critique which can be levelled against the work is that derived from such a work as Shapley's "Man and the Stars" rather than from Marx, Freud, Wellhausen, or Conybeare. The very facts of the infinity, the complexity and scope of the cosmos, which serve to enlarge God and make the assumption of God in the universe much more reasonable than ever before, do at the same time make all the basic assumptions of the Christian Epic just that much more untenable and improbable. This is a problem with which the modern religionists have not adequately wrestled. The case for God can be made more reasonable and credible than ever before, but the orthodox view of the divinity and uniqueness of Christ is, in the view of many earnest thinkers, fatally undermined by the demonstrable facts of modern astrophysics and of the history of religion and ethics. It is hard to sustain the view of the unique divine solicitude for homo sapiens implied in the vicarious sacrifice of the only begotten Son of God in the light of our present cosmic per- spective. And the results of the present- day history of religious and ethical thought are equally disconcerting to the conception of the absolute originality, uniqueness and perfection of the teachings of Jesus. Then we have further, the whole issue of the pathetic incompleteness of Christ's recorded teachings, the un- certainties as to the correct interpretation of his doctrines which remain, and the grave differences in culture and. outlook as between his day and ours. The cosmic egotism of man is hard to put down, but it would appear that, from now on, cosmic humility must be the beginning of theo- logical as well as astrophysical wisdom. The other major issue relates to the tendency in the book to separate the spiritual from the psychological and to represent the ideal as a somewhat mystical entity. As the author says, "There is no necessary connection between mentality and spirituality." What the author really means to say, as is clear from the context, is that many a person may be endowed with a superior intellectual equipment and may possess a vast amount of information and still be a scoundrel or develop incurable insanity. But this can- not be scientifically or logically made to mean that intelligent character-building can rest securely upon anything other than adequate and valid information and sound intelligence. Further, there is always the grave danger of failing to dis-</page><page sequence="4">LIBRARY AND WORKSHOP 483 tinguish between true character and what is merely unthinking social docility and unreasoning subservience to convention. To the orthodox Jewish theologian and business man of his day, Christ could scarcely have seemed a person of "good character." And, while it would be folly to suggest this as a complete ex- planation, surely no one can fathom the psychogenesis of ideals without a candid recognition of the problem of individual and group interests, the mechanism of rationalization, and the whole processof social conditioning. The general field of thought raised by the book is one in which dogmatizing in an absolutistic vein is both futile and undesirable, but it may be suggested that the whole problem of God in history must be reconsidered very frankly. (i) in the light of the new perspective forced upon us by contemporary astrophysics; (.) in the light of the mental mechanisms established by analytical, behavioristic and social psychology; and (3) in the light of comparative ethics and the history of religious belief. The categories of a generation ago are about equally obsolete for the theologian, the scientist and the historian alike. HARRY E. BARNES. Smith College.</page></plain_text>
