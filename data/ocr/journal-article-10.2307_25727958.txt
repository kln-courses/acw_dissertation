<plain_text><page sequence="1">Anthropomorphism and Interpretation of the Qur'an in the Theology of al-Qasim ibn Ibrahim, Kitdb al-Mustarshid. By Binyamin Abrahamov. (Islamic Theology, Philosophy and Science, vol. XXVI). Pp. xviii, 152. Leiden, E. J. Brill, 1996. A distinguo is encountered in Christian thought between 'revealed' and 'natural' theology. While this distinction is also useful in categorising Islamic thinkers (for instance Ashcari could be placed in the former category, Ibn Sina in the latter), there is a strong case to be made that the two kinds of theology properly converge in Islam. The theology of the Qur'an and the one arrived at through the independent operation of the intellect are in many respects mutually confirmatory. This is perhaps most clearly witnessed in the case of Muctazilite, and Muctazilite-style kalam. The subject of this book is an early representative of Muctazilite-style kalam, and a major figure in the tradition of Zayd! Shfism, al-Qasim ibn Ibrahim (169/785-246/ 860). An important inference which Abrahamov's book allows us to make is that the great fulcrum in the history of Shfite - and especially Ithna cAshari - theology, namely the absorption of Muctazilism under the Buyids,1 was prefigured by the remarkably thoroughgoing Muctazilism encountered in Zaydism, primarily represented by al-Qasim ibn Ibrahim. But we must be careful how we put this. While throughout his introduc tion Abrahamov tends to speak of al-Qasim as 'following the Muctazila', it has been pointed out that agreement with the Muctazila and following or adhering to them are not the same thing.2 For instance, a linguistic method of exegesis (which makes full use of Arabic polysemy to get away from anthropomorphism in Qur'anic descriptions of God) is not necessarily indicative of formal Muctazilism. This is in view of the fact that the method in question was quite normal even amongst the earliest Qur'an exegetes, and was later employed by figures who were known to be outside the school (e.g., Abu TJbayda and al-Farrac). What we appear to have in al-Qasim, then, is evidence, not of the assimilation of Muctazilism by the Zaydiyya, but of the substantial doctrinal and methodological agreement of Muctazilism and the independent kalam tradition of the Zaydiyya. The Kitdb al-mustarshid - the work by al-Qasim presented here in a critical edition with accompanying translation (evidently via the Hebrew of Abrahamov's Ph.D.</page><page sequence="2">190 Journal of Qur'anic Studies thesis3) - is overwhelmingly concerned with one particular problem of kalam. Namely, the proper hermeneutic of Qur'anic descriptions of God which purport to circumscribe Him. These could only loosely be termed 'anthropomorphic' descriptions, as in the title of Abrahamov's book, since the circumscription in question (i.e., tashbih, 'liken ing') does not necessarily involve human attributes. Only two out of the seven refuta tions of tashbih, prove to be specifically directed against human circumscriptions, namely the second, against the claim that God has a soul 'like a human soul' (ka-nafs al-insan), and the sixth, against the claim that God has a face Tike a man's face' (ka-wajh al-insan). The other circumscriptions refuted are: that God is in heaven but not elsewhere; that God is a light analogous to physical light; that God is a 'thing'; that God has parts (abcad) and that God is visible. The last of these introduces the tangen tial issue of how exactly to affirm the eschatological doctrine of the beatific vision, based inter alia on the proof-text 'On that day faces will be luminous looking at their Lord' (Qur'an 75: 22-3). In the treatment of all such problems, al-Qasim avails himself of a fascinating panoply of hermeneutic expedients, which broadly speaking align him with Muctazilism. Three examples may be given. Firstly, the Qur'an itself is used in interpreting such circum scriptive verses (tafsir al-Qur'an bi'l-Qur'an). For instance, al-Qasim prefaces the whole discussion of whether and how the believers will see God (on the basis of Qur'an 75: 22) with the text 'There is nothing like unto Him, and He is the All-Hearing and the All-Seeing' (Qur'an 42: 11). Thus, while al-Qasim affirms that God's friends (awliya') will somehow look on Him in Paradise, this will be 'without His being limited and encompassed'.4 Secondly, there is a lexically based hermeneutic in which there is extensive reference to poetry and usage. From this we discover (in the same discus sion) that 'looking' (nazar) might mean perceiving something via its effects / acts (bi-afalihi), and need not mean encompassing it with one's eyes. In Arabic one might say for instance 'Look at how excellent the laws of religion are.'5 Thirdly, reason is used - either independently or in conjunction with proof-texts. In the former category (again within the same discussion) there is an intriguing argument6 that the perception of X is harder to realize than the imagination of X (al-idrak akthar min al-takhayyul). We can, for instance, imagine things that we cannot perceive, and if we can perceive something; a priori we can imagine it. But if this is so, then if something cannot be imagined, a fdhiori it cannot be perceived. Therefore, we may not claim that God was 'seen' - by the Prophet or anyone else. Again on pp. 130-1 there is a reductio ad absur dum argument against the doctrine of Abu T-Hudhayl al-cAllaf and others that the vision of God will occur by a special sixth sense which He will create for the blessed. Al-Qasim asks, is it then the case that via a seventh sense it will become possible to touch, or taste, or smell God? Next, in the latter category (= reason in close association with scripture), al-Qasim points out that when Moses is said to have asked God to show Himself to him (Qur'an 7: 143), this cannot mean Moses requested God to present</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews 191 Himself to his eyes 'through encompassment and limitation'. We can know this by reasoning on the basis of another story about Moses related in the Qur'an, namely, that when some people bade him to show them his God openly, they were destroyed by a thunderbolt (Qur'an 4: 153). Al-Qasim reasons from this7 that their asking to see God in that way amounted to the major sin of 'associationism' (shirk), and it was necessary for God to make an example of them. Now, al-Qasim says that a minor misdeed (hadath) is remotely conceivable for a prophet, but not a major sin (kabira). How then is it possible that Moses' request to God was the same as theirs? Thus his request cannot be used in self-justification by the circumscriptive theologians (mushabbihun). In the introductory part of the book (pp. 1-43), Abrahamov makes reference not only to the Mustarshid but also other works by al-Qasim, as well as the broader kalam context, to reach general conclusions on his style of hermeneutics. There is much of utility in these pages, and we note some interesting details in passing. For example, Abrahamov reveals that al-Qasim was not averse to using the Gospels as evidence in his thinking. For instance he cites Jesus' statement that no verse of the Torah will be eliminated,8 in defense of his idea that abrogation (naskh) should not be taken to mean the actual elimination (ifna" I ibtal) of a revelation, but rather its modification by way of explanation (tasrif bil-tabyin wa'l-ldah). We are also told that al-Qasim makes frequent reference to the didactic precedent of a mysterious pre-Islamic grouping known as the 'ancient sages' (al-hukama al-awwalln). Abrahamov's critical edition of the text (pp. 48-145) is probably the most important part of this volume. This uses five manuscripts of which the most significant is (h) - a Berlin ms. bearing the date of 544/1149. Aside from being the oldest of the mss. used, it also proves to be the clearest, completest and most accurate. Notwithstanding the value of having an early Zaydi theological text of this kind made available in a critical edition, the translation which accompanies Abrahamov's edition is very far from satis factory, and unfortunately not merely for superficial reasons such as typographical errors.9 When the English is not simply wrong (which it is often) it is badly clumsy. For example, there is an ignorance of the use of the preposition 'for' which Abrahamov routinely uses in translating the Arabic construction li-anna (which we often must translate 'in that', 'because', 'since'): e.g., 'That is for you say this is one man and the other is one and so forth' (sic, p. 87); 'That is for everything except God has six sides and is more than two...' (sic, p. 91). There is much in the same vein, and the translation is Virtually incoherent in many places, doing less than justice to al-Qasim's thought which is sometimes remarkably subtle. Aside from problems with English, one is sometimes not even sure that the Arabic has been understood correctly. For example, on pp. 106-9 there is an important argument against taking wajh Allah ('God's face')to mean a literal 'located' face, but rather it simply means 'God' or 'God's Self. On the basis of the proof-text 'Wheresoever</page><page sequence="4">192 Journal of Qur'anic Studies you turn, there is the face of God' (Qur'an 2:115) al-Qasim reasons that since opposite spatial directions are thus known to be towards wajh Allah, if this meant a located face, we would violate the law of non-contradiction: 'since His face, to which [the direc tions] stand opposite, is not what is other than it' (li-anna wajhahu alladhi hum muqabilun duna ma siwdhu). Compare this with Abrahamov's translation: 'for they stand opposite His face and not opposite His other parts.' In general, it is surprising that Brill released the translation in this state.
