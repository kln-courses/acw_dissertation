<plain_text><page sequence="1">Jewish History ?Vol. 6, Nos. 1-2 1992 Strategies of Interpretation in Maimonides' Guide of the Perplexed Alfred L. Ivry I In his rabbinic writings, Moses Maimonides (1138-1204) had a long-standing hermeneutical tradition on which to draw, and against which to propose his own approach to the Law. In Jewish philosophy, however, Maimonides had many fewer antecedents to start with, and none whom he respected philosophically. This was not as serious a problem as might seem, however, since Maimonides, as every philosopher worth his salt, did not view his coreligionists as his only predecessors in this area. We have the letter he wrote to the Hebrew translator of the Guide, Samuel ibn Tibbon, praising certain philosophers and not others, so we know at least which thinkers he was prepared to recommend to one wishing to prepare himself for philosophy.1 The Greek Aristotle and the Muslim philosopher Al-Farabi come out at the head of this list, and Jewish philosophers at the bottom. Actually, Maimonides does not recommend reading any of his Jewish predecessors, as for him the ostensibly Peripatetic school of Greek and Islamic thought is sufficient, mostly, to acquaint anyone with the basic teachings of philosophy. Thus, even Plato and Avicenna are not particularly recommended, though their influence and that of Plotinus is not at all insignificant in the Guide.2 Moreover, Plato's political philosophy, as represented in the Republic, may be regarded as the primary source for Maimonides' own views, underlying much of the Guide's teachings. Plato's opinion of the relationship of philosophy and religion and the uses of religion as a political and social instrument had been communicated to Maimonides through Al-Farabi's writings, however, and Maimonides' praise for the "Second Master," as Al-Farabi was known, may be thought to include his presentation of Platonic political philosophy. Judging from the Guide itself as well as from Maimonides' letter to his translator, the main (non-political) philosophical teachings to which Maimonides is committed</page><page sequence="2">114 Alfred L. Ivry are essentially Aristotelian logic, physics and metaphysics. This commitment obviates the need to study almost all of Maimonides' Jewish predecessors, be they Neoplatonists like Isaac Israeli and Solomon Ibn Gabirol, or quasi-philosophers like Saadiah Gaon and Judah Halevi. Saadiah (d. 942), one of the first generation of medieval Jewish thinkers, practices a form of theology, kalam, which was more popular in Islam than it was in Judaism, particularly in rabbinic circles.3 Kalam precedes philosophy in the Islamic world, and is itself preceded and influenced by the thought of the Church Fathers and their Syriac speaking and writing epigones in the Middle East. Unlike the sages, who conceptualized God through parable and midrash, kalam followed Christian theology in attempting a systematic rational articulation of its views. However, neither Christian nor Muslim theologians were much aware of or particularly concerned with distinguishing between demonstrative and non-demonstrative reasoning, and both preferred dialectical and rhetorical forms of argument. As might be expected from this, the Muslim theologians, like the Church Fathers, did not subscribe essentially to Aristotelian logic or science, and focused their attention on topics which are generally regarded as purely theological. Both groups pursued such issues as the nature of God and what may be attributed to that nature without violating His oneness; and notions of justice, providence, reward and punishment and the hereafter. For many of the theologians of Islam, moreover, an atomistic physics served to provide a physical justification for a radical anti-scientific Occasionalism.4 Maimonides is dead-set against the kalam and its practitioners, the mutakallimiln, and devotes a central part of the Guide to an exposition and refutation of their tenets.5 He can abide neither their non-necessary, since non-demonstrative argumentation, nor their anti-Aristotelian science. Saadiah, though not necessarily the target of Maimonides' censure, and too eclectic a thinker to be simply labeled as a mutakallim, is yet too close to the kalam style and methodology to avoid being dismissed together with them. The same fate, of being judged by the company he kept, or seems to have kept, befell Judah Halevi in Maimonides' eyes, which can be inferred from Maimonides' omission of his famous predecessor's name in his writings. In the Kuzari, Halevi (d. ca. 1141) uses logical argument to attack the premises of Aristotelian physics and metaphysics.6 In their stead he offers a fairly simple schematic voluntarism, in which the divine will is the determining mechanism of all events. For Halevi, causal efficacy and philosophical explanations are accepted in practice but relegated to a secondary role, Halevi having no scientific explanations of his own to suggest as alternatives to the philosophers. He is content simply to pull the rug of cognitive certainty out from under the philosophers, in order to be able to use the Bible instead of Aristotle as the main institution of philosophical interpretation. The sacred text is brought as proof of God's omniscience and omnipotence, and as proof too of God's special concern for the people and land of Israel. The</page><page sequence="3">Strategies of Interpretation 115 particularistic aspects of Halevi's creed are buttressed with biological and geographical theories, lending a pseudo-scientific coloration to dogma.7 In claiming a special natural dimension for the people and land of Israel, Halevi is standing close to hallowed traditional Jewish ground, even if some of his ethnocentric specific formulations are now known to have been borrowed from Shi'ite ideologies originally intended for a Muslim audience.8 Traditional Judaism, however, does not owe its doctrine of chosenness, with all that it implies in terms of special providence, to Islam. The Bible assures the patriarchs' descendents of a glorious collective destiny, framed within a specific political structure. History may not have provided much support for this belief, but the believer has his own way of reading history. History, as Halevi reads it, following traditional Jewish historiography, is a powerful criterion with which to evaluate the special character of the Jewish people. For Halevi, history paradoxically confirms the physical and metaphysical arguments which he adduces to assert Jewish superiority. These arguments revolve around the supposedly natural disposition of Jews and the land of Israel to receive more of a certain undefined "Divine Command" (al~amr al-ildhi), translated in Hebrew as ha- 'inyan ha- 'elohi) than is granted other people and places.9 Of course, this "natural" fact of disposition and divine command is itself the product of the Divine Will, the final cause and explanation for everything. This inscrutable Will has chosen to enter into an irrevocable covenant with one people, and by extension with its country; the rejoining of the one with the other a necessary condition for turning God's face towards His people once again. For better or for worse, Halevi's Zionism has endeared him to many today. It does not seem, however, to have particularly impressed his contemporaries, who did not emulate him either in a personal or literary way. Maimonides gives him the silent treatment, i.e., a cold shoulder, both in the letter to Samuel ibn Tibbon and in the Guide itself. Actually, the latter work is at the opposite extreme from the Kuzari, in its basic approach to philosophy as well as in its choice of specific assertions. Where Halevi is anti-philosophical in practice, Maimonides is pro-philosophy, and where Halevi is in favor of using history in support of a philosophical argument, Maimonides is opposed.10 So too is Maimonides opposed to the use of the notion of the Will of God as an all-purpose explanation for the particularities of the Jewish faith. For him, the Will of God is indistinguishable from His Wisdom in that both are to be understood only in the most general and universal of terms. As treated by Halevi, the amr ildhf, the instrument of Divine Will, is an immaterial substance. It is akin to the hypostases posited by Neoplatonic thought in its ability to affect people and places on earth. It functions as if it were all the souls of the spheres rolled into one, coordinating celestial influences which otherwise can conflict. As such it is an inspired variant of Avicennian teachings on the souls of the spheres, teachings themselves similar to those which were widespread in astrological circles as well.</page><page sequence="4">116 Alfred L. Ivry Now, Maimonides is opposed both to Neoplatonic structures and to astrology, the former supposedly on philosophical, the latter on religious grounds. Really, Maimonides opposes both for the same reason, the different audiences addressed by the philosopher and the astrologer accounting for Maimonides' different response to each. Essentially, both Neoplatonism and astrology are wrong, in his view, because they multiply realities unnecessarily, positing the existence of substances and causes beyond those testified to by logic and sensory experience. Maimonides, as a good Aristotelian and would-be nominalist, would like to "save the phenomena," and not add to them immaterial entities of a conjectural and ultimately redundant sort.11 For him, believing in false propositions about the world is tantamount to believing in false gods, when influence and power are granted to non-existent entities.12 The world of natural science and hylomorphic equilibrium is threatened by these doctrines, and as this world is thought to have been ordered by God, the threat to science is also deemed a threat to theology. Halevi's philosophy is implicitly rejected by Maimonides, then, both for its unscientific as well as its anti-philosophical thrust. To Maimonides, it is unscientific ultimately because it is unphilosophical, which means it rejects both Aristotelian structures and explanations of being. Much the same reason accounts for Maimonides' tacit rejection of Saadiah, who is less of a philosophical adversary than is Halevi for Maimonides, but no more of a friend.13 However, both men are theologically closer to the teachings of rabbinic Judaism than is Maimonides in his philosophical persona, a fact which must give one pause when thinking of the title of Maimonides' composition, the Guide of the Perplexed, Moreh nevukhim. The addressee of the Guide is a person who is supposedly confused over the apparently conflicting claims and methodologies of philosophy and theology,14 and Maimonides' purpose in writing the work is to resolve these conflicts in such a way as to reaffirm the addressee's commitment to Judaism without relinquishing the claims of philosophy. Accordingly, the Judaism which Maimonides presents in the Guide is one which is philosophically respectable, if not paradigmatic of all religious philosophies. To offer such a picture of Judaism, Maimonides strips it initially of its historic dimension as well as of its dogmatic coloration, depriving it of its simple assuredness of being special. The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob is replaced, for the purpose of philosophical argument, by the one God, a universal being no more Jewish than Muslim. Having established the existence of such a deity, Maimonides then attempts to relate it to the Jewish tradition, without surrendering totally to the premises of that tradition. Towards that end, he uses the Bible philosophically even while arguing for parochial purposes.15 n The confusion which Maimonides sets out to resolve in the Guide is not, however, just between science and faith, or philosophy and theology. It is also between</page><page sequence="5">Strategies of Interpretation 1 17 science and science, and between faith and faith, the various expressions of science and religion which we have mentioned. Maimonides begins the Guide already having chosen his scientific and religious exemplars, but then he proceeds in effect to challenge his choices, even while using them in arguments against their counterparts. Maimonides is thereby engaged in an internal hermeneutical argument, which he attempts to shield from the reader behind an elaborate edifice of deliberate contradictions. In this manner, the perplexed addressee of the Guide is as much the author of the work as is the reader, and this book may be read, as all great literature, as the author's voyage of self-discovery. Maimonides introduces the reader to the difficulty facing him in reading the Guide in the very introduction to the first part of the book. Maimonides elaborates there on the linguistic distinctions he will make in interpreting prophetic utterances. Some scriptural terms will be taken to have equivocal meaning, others will be regarded as having essentially derivative meaning, while still other terms will be seen as amphibolous, having non-essential referents. The reader need be attuned to these lexical dimensions, the one common denominator in these terms being their non-univocal nature. The "second purpose" of his composition, Maimonides tells the reader in this introduction, is to explain the "very obscure" parables of the prophets, to interpret their "internal" or esoteric sense. This may be seen as an extension of the lessons learned in applying multiple meanings to single terms. Parables, however, being self-contained stories, do not yield correspondences for their every word, but have some terms and images which may defy interpretation, or complete interpretation. Maimonides insists on the difficulty of interpretation, and on the inevitable residue of unexplained meaning in the parables and their ontological referents, taken to be physics and metaphysics. These subjects have a mysterious dimension, he believes, a secret core which is only occasionally and briefly apprehended and which cannot be communicated except through parabolic speech. Though Maimonides makes it clear that part of the reason for such indirect discourse on scientific matters, particularly in their scriptural presentation, is political, to conceal the truth from the "vulgar" who would misunderstand and oppose it, part is also substantive. As he says, "The situation is such that the exposition of one who wishes to teach without recourse to parables and riddles is so obscure and brief as to make obscurity and brevity serve in place of parables and riddles."16 His own interpretive path, Maimonides says, is to drop hints "that approach a clear exposition" of terms and parables, without inventing new ones or attempting an exhaustive analysis of the scriptural text. The reader of the Guide can both agree and disagree with Maimonides' description of his approach to Scripture, which is both explicit and enigmatic. Maimonides is quite explicit in the ensuing interpretation of scriptural terms, even as his interpretation of fundamental religious narratives, such as creation and revelation, is rather enigmatic. He treats these biblical accounts as parables, conveying the truth</page><page sequence="6">118 Alfred L.Ivry of physics and metaphysics in story form, stories which contain an inner truth which cannot be revealed fully. His approach to philosophy is thus quite unphilosophical, at least unphilosophical in Aristotelian terms, the terms he himself recommends. Where Aristotle courageously laid out his views on all subjects as fully and systematically as possible, with a minimum of parable and artifice, Maimonides adopts the opposite approach, confining himself, as he says, just to "mentioning briefly the foundations of belief and general truths."17 Of course, Maimonides is separated from Aristotle by a vast divide, at once chronological and cultural, and, in the Islamic and Jewish milieu in which he lived, the parabolic style of philosophizing, as the use of discreet and guarded language, was not uncommon. Moreover, the exigencies of scriptural interpretation were frequently known to require the application of parable and allegory. These were techniques employed since the time of Philo, and they were not limited to philosophical circles only. Notwithstanding these facts, it is yet true that, in his endorsement of a parabolic hermeneutic, Maimonides is adopting the Platonic style of philosophizing rather than the Aristotelian. His introduction even contains a parable reminiscent of Plato's allegory of the cave,18 and it is Plato's Republic, or its medieval expression in Al-Farabi's Views of the Inhabitants of the Virtuous State more than any Aristotelian work which influences Maimonides' style.19 Maimonides may also be seen as a Platonist in the substantive sense of believing in the ultimate unknowability of the nature of God and of being, the one tied to the other conceptually. Here, though, the conflict between Maimonides' Aristotelian and Platonic leanings is more than methodological, and that which he professes not to know must be balanced against that which he believes he does know, which is not inconsiderable. In its stated purposes, then, the Guide is a work of biblical exegesis with a clearly stated hermeneutic, though one which cannot be applied automatically to every scriptural term or passage and must be learned example by example. Here too Maimonides adopts a non-philosophical, or at least non-Aristotelian approach, as evinced immediately in the opening section of the Guide. He examines various anthropomorphic terms separately, without first stating the principles guiding his interpretation. His demonstration for the unity and incorporeality of God comes later in the treatise, after his piecemeal approach is concluded. Such an approach, however, is more than non-Aristotelian, it is non-philosophical in general, presenting neither an inductive nor a deductive argument, but simply assuming that which ought to be proved, and interpreting scriptural terms with what amounts to an arbitrary choice of meanings. These choices are arbitrary in that in themselves they do not entail the meanings assigned them. Moreover, they do not have to bear the weight of Maimonides' specific interpretations even according to his own hermeneutical principle, since interpretations of a similar but specifically different sort can be conceived. Maimonides himself offers a number of possible meanings for many of the terms</page><page sequence="7">Strategies of Interpretation 119 he discusses. Still, Maimonides' exegesis of Scripture does exhibit a clear and consistent pattern, with an impressive internal coherence. This has induced many to overlook the radical nature of Maimonides' teachings, and of philosophical exegesis of Scripture in general. The least problematic of Maimonides' interpretations concern terms which describe God as descending or ascending, and coming or going.20 For Maimonides, these terms are indicative of the prophets' awareness of the presence of God, and are taken as expressions of His manifestation or revelation. The unchanging and stable nature of the divine presence is seen as conveyed by terms which have God either sitting or standing, rising or resting;21 while the divine will is understood to be intended in terms which speak of the heart, soul and spirit of the Lord.22 "Saying" and "speaking" are also seen as denoting God's will,23 as well as denoting the notions which are apprehended as having been communicated by that will. Many other terms also express the apprehension of God's intentions, and the action of cognition or intellection itself. Seeing, hearing and even eating are all taken as standing for intellectual apprehension,24 that action which for Maimonides is at the heart of the religious experience. This, because God Himself is best described as the paradigm of immaterial, intelligent being, His being consisting of pure intellect, or thought. This concept, obviously derived from Aristotle and his successors, is presented immediately in the first chapter of Part One of the Guide, where it is found conveyed by such terms as "image" and "likeness." Created in the image of God, man shares with the deity a defining characteristic, rationality. Of course, the resemblance is only partial, terms such as "throne" and "high" indicating God's exalted and essentially incomparable status.25 It is a sign of the historic victory which the philosophical understanding of Scripture has achieved that many of the terms which Maimonides designates as anthropomorphisms are seen today, as for centuries past, as just that - non-literal expressions denoting various attributes of the deity. Yet from a philosophical point of view, Maimonides has waged a poor campaign against anthropomorphisms, begging the question of God's corporeality repeatedly. It is not until seventy(!) chapters have passed that Maimonides begins a more philosophical discussion which will lead to a demonstration of the existence, unity, and incorporeality of God, that which has been assumed all along in the preceding chapters. m I do not wish to contend that Maimonides does not offer some elaboration of his viewpoint before chapter 70, but it is scarcely less dogmatic in its approach. In a number of chapters scattered through the first part of the Guide, Maimonides discusses the reasons why people take scriptural anthropomorphisms literally, why it is difficult to disabuse them of the notion, and why he cannot begin teaching the</page><page sequence="8">120 Alfred L. Ivry subject systematically, i.e., logically, in philosophical terms.26 Maimonides' explanations are very plausible, showing keen insight into human nature, but they do not thereby prove that anthropomorphisms are wrong in themselves. It is simply man's nature, Maimonides acknowledges, to conceive of the deity in human terms first, projecting his own virtues and characteristic behavior upon God. Most people, moreover, initially cannot conceive of anything existing which is not corporeal, and once having this opinion, resist changing it, people being psychologically resistant to new ideas. Furthermore, the truth regarding God's nature is hard to come by, since in Maimonides' opinion it can only begin to be understood after much else has been learned: logic, the mathematical and natural sciences, and metaphysics, the "divine science." As Maimonides concedes, many people are not intellectually up to such a demanding curriculum, and of those who are capable of it, some die before completing their course work. Yet others, who may be intellectually capable of such an arduous study, are deflected from it by their temperaments, or by their need or desire for material well-being. Maimonides concludes that with all these obstacles in their path, practically all people would die without knowing of God's existence or of the nature of His attributes, were they not simply told the truth rather than taught it.27 Inculcating the truth by appealing to traditional authority, as well as by the use of parables, is therefore, in Maimonides' eyes, an expedient justified by the human condition - as well as an oblique apology for his own approach. Maimonides, of course, has nothing to apologize for in helping give the masses truths they cannot or will not acquire themselves. He is convinced of the utility of believing in these truths, even if they are not really understood. He presumably believes, and not unwisely, that ideas held on authority, which is to say on faith, affect a person's conduct. For him, the observance of the Law ultimately depends upon having the right belief about God, even as the Law leads one back to that belief. He certainly believes in the converse of this, that holding false beliefs about God has a pernicious effect upon one's character, meriting death.28 Yet the Guide is not written for the masses, as Maimonides says repeatedly, and he has, by his own confession, deliberately made it difficult for them to follow it. It is the solitary one, the rare intellectual and student of philosophy, for whom he has composed this work. Joseph ben Judah ibn Sham'On, to whom the Guide is dedicated and for whom it is ostensibly written, was this kind of person, and Maimonides therefore started him on mathematics, astronomy, and logic when first they met.29 Joseph and the few like him did not need to be treated condescendingly in writing, one would have thought. Of course, the written nature of Maimonides' teaching had to have a different flavor from his oral communications, and this may account for the non-philosophical approach of trie opening section of the Guide. However much Maimonides may have wanted to write a philosophical treatise meant for a select and sophisticated</page><page sequence="9">Strategies of Interpretation 121 audience, he knew that once it left his pen it could be read by anyone. He was well aware that many of his rabbinical colleagues, whom he openly derides in the Guide for their lack of philosophical training,30 would be reading the book, ready to pounce on its author for the first expression of unorthodox belief. Maimonides was a leading member of his community, and he wished to maintain his position in it and in the rabbinical world. He therefore chose to begin the Guide in a traditional style, that of biblical exegesis, replete with its own non-philosophically compelling hermeneutic. Moreover, he knew that the thrust of this hermeneutic, or at least the initial thrust, was not unfamiliar or unacceptable to would-be critics, since rabbinic Judaism had long professed a strict monotheism, one which denied any multiplicity or corporeality in God. Maimonides therefore begins the Guide on a disarmingly popular low key, disappointing only to those who had been prepared by his introduction for something else. The book, however, is public property, and philosophers must be content to share it with others. If they have paid full attention to the introduction, they will be able to swallow their disappointment and contain their impatience. It is also possible that Maimonides may be doing Joseph and his dozen-odd brothers a service after all, alongside that meant to enlighten - and placate - all readers of the Guide. While he has not proved his case, nor even attempted to, Maimonides has nevertheless built up a formidably coherent theory to explain biblical anthropomorphisms. As he notes, quoting the sages, "The Torah speaks as the language of man,"31 i.e., in a conventional language, but one which Maimonides has shown to be capable of radical transformation. Every scriptural term and figure of speech can be interpreted philosophically to express a non-corporeal attribute of God, and the philosopher, being shown this, can accept the Bible as compatible with philosophy, as, in fact, a philosophical text. Maimonides sums up his view thus: God, may He be exalted above every deficiency, has had bodily organs figuratively ascribed to Him in order that His acts should be indicated by this means. And those particular acts are figuratively ascribed to him in order to indicate a certain perfection, which is not identical with the particular act mentioned.... Action and speech are ascribed to God so that an overflow proceeding from Him should thereby.be indicated.... All bodily organs that you can find mentioned in all of the books of prophecy are either organs of local motion mentioned with a view to indicating life, or organs of sensation mentioned with a view to indicating apprehension, or organs of prehension mentioned with a view to indicating action, or organs of speech mentioned with a view to indicating the overflow of the intellects toward the prophets, as will be made clear. The guidance contained in all these figurative senses is intended to establish in us the belief that there is an existent who is living, is the agent who produces everything other than He, and in addition apprehends His own act.32 Now, while all this is still an opinion, and not a demonstrated proof, it is still a plausible thesis, made persuasive by the detailed treatment Maimonides has given</page><page sequence="10">122 Alfred L. Ivry so many specific terms in the preceding chapters. He has methodically established an alternative way to read the Bible, and taught Joseph that this reading is its primary teaching, even if this is not grasped fully by most believers. While the Josephs of this world do not have to worry that the philosophical teachings of the Bible are beyond their grasp, they do need to realize that the Bible is a sophisticated philosophical text. At the risk of appearing philosophically na?ve, or, what is worse for him, a mutakallim, Maimonides has driven home his point term by term, image by image: the Bible is philosophically respectable, philosophically profound. IV Maimonides is in the mainstream in his attack on a literal understanding of biblical anthropomorphisms, and he has little to fear in denouncing those who conceive of God in corporeal terms. But then Maimonides makes a more daring move, spelling out fully what most people were - and are - reluctant to acknowledge in terms of the entailments of this critique for the notion of divine attributes. The entailments, however, do not follow necessarily from the denial of corporeality or anthropomorphic language in itself, and hence Maimonides abandons the exegetical mode in his discussion of this subject. It is his construal of the notion of divine unity that compels Maimonides, on logical grounds, towards the next step, one that separates him from his popular audience and from many of his rabbinic colleagues - a step, furthermore, that begins to redeem the philosophical pledge made in the introduction of the book. As Maimonides explains it, "there is no oneness at all except in believing that there is one simple essence in which there is no complexity or multiplication of notions, but one notion only; so that from whatever angle you regard it and from whatever point of view you consider it, you will find that it is one, not divided in any way and by any cause into two notions; and you will not find therein any multiplicity either in the thing as it is outside of the mind or as it is in the mind, as shall be demonstrated in this Treatise."33 In this manner we learn that all the divine attributes, however abstractly they may be construed, do not in fact have an independent identity in God's being; that not only do they not express separate physical actions, but neither do they have a separate immaterial being. We learn, in short, that there are no divine attributes as such. Rather, they may be seen as subsumed within the very essence of God; which essence, however, is absolutely simple. Maimonides wishes to assert two contradictory sets of propositions, it would appear. He says that God has life, power, knowledge and will, with the actions towards others and awareness of them that these terms entail; and that He does not have these attributes, but rather that he "apprehends His own act" in the sense that</page><page sequence="11">Strategies of Interpretation 123 He is "aware" of Himself only, the attributes not separate from or other than His essence. It is difficult, from a traditional religious standpoint, to say that God does not have these attributes, but it is logically difficult, for Maimonides as for other philosophers, to say that He does. Hence the expedient of negative theology to which Maimonides will turn, a technique which presumes to say something almost positive by negating the privation of the desired attribute.34 Maimonides' position on the nature of God's oneness is not unique to him among the philosophers, and it was one of the major points of difference between them and the theologians, who were more tolerant of the notion of divine attributes, even while fully conscious of the logical dilemma it posed for believing, as they did, in the absolute unity of God. As Maimonides clearly understands, not only are all essential and of course all accidental attributes banned from use, but all relational attributes are as well. The attributes of action, which alone are considered permissible locutions, are just that - figures of speech which project human behavior and characteristics upon the deity.35 Presumably, it is not Maimonides' opinion that God does not act, or know, or will, and in doing so relate to the world; but it is also his opinion that we cannot understand how God can do these things, given His nature. Hence, we cannot predicate such attributes of God except indirectly, and by an unabashed projection of human qualities. It is at this point that science and philosophy come to Maimonides' rescue, and that he looks to them for a way out of his theological dilemma. For physics and metaphysics also introduce us to some knowledge of God's nature, and do so ostensibly by way of reasoned argument and demonstration. Yet to turn to philosophy Maimonides must first engage his kalam adversaries, this time with a full description of their beliefs, and particularly their view of a theoretically open-ended natural world, one in which whatever may be imagined can occur, if it is not logically self-contradictory, should God will it.36 Maimonides rightly feels such a view undermines science and all claims to certain knowledge, knowledge which must assume the permanence of natural species, and the validity, even necessity, of causal explanation. Yet the more Maimonides argues against kalam Voluntarism and Occasionalism, the more he seems to sense that he cannot refute its basic premise without doing severe damage to die traditional image of an omnipotent God.37 The premise is that God is not constrained by the natural order and that in theory He can change that order radically, and this expresses an image of God which Maimonides is reluctant to part with completely, and certainly not publicly. Yet Maimonides' stated commitment is to philosophy, and it is that discipline only which he believes allows one to speak with any certainty about the natural world; and it is only philosophy which offers one some hope of arriving at an intelligible and demonstrable understanding of God. Thus, after disposing of the mutakallim?n, or attempting to dispose of them, Maimonides lays down the</page><page sequence="12">124 Alfred L. Ivry philosopher's creed, in physics and metaphysics.38 This is a creed which leads from the observed phenomena of heaven and earth to the unobserved but necessary positing of separate forms, the intelligences of the spheres, and the first mover itself. This is God Himself, as we recognize, the first cause as well as intelligence known to us from Aristotle and his successors. This description of God is not quite the same as that which serves Maimonides as the linchpin of the discussion of divine attributes, in which God is described as the Necessary Existent (w?jib al-wuj?d), that being whose essence is being, or existence, pure and simple.39 Yet these Aristotelian and Avicennian descriptions merge, in that the knowledge or intellect which characterizes Aristotle's god is also equal to its essence and is the totality of its being, with no action or thought other than of itself. Aristotle's first mover and cause acts indirectly only, and has no volitional or conscious relation with anything else. The major stumbling block to the integration of Maimonides' doctrine of divine attributes with his natural science is this last point, how the ostensibly non-related and hence non-involved God of Aristotle does actually relate to this world. Here Plotinus, through the "Theology of Aristotle,"40 comes to Maimonides' rescue, the doctrine of emanation evoked to show that the many can come from the one, especially from such a One. Of course, Maimonides cannot explain this any more than his predecessors could, without admitting to the potentiality for multiplicity in the One; which admission introduces into the One that very complexity which is forbidden. All Maimonides can say is that the world "proceeds" from God, that emanation occurs, without affecting God's unity and without His "doing" anything to make it happen.41 It is as though the emanation of the first "created" being just happened, that, like Topsy, it just grew, or "overflew" - except that God knew about it all the same, and is its cause after all. We are clearly in a dilemma here which is only partially solved by assuming an eternal universe in which the first created being has always been present, and the dynamics of emanation in place forever, requiring no special or new action on God's part. This view, though, conflicts with the notion of creation from nothing, as well as with any variant of the creation thesis. Maimonides is at pains to assert some such view, though scholars are still divided over his belief in this area.42 The greatest difficulty facing him in accepting creation, if one takes him literally, is that he will be granting the kalam the victory it seeks. He will be accepting in principle the view that God is not circumscribed by the natural order, nor is he intelligible only through it. While Maimonides would like to make creation just the one exception to the otherwise eternal dictates of physics and metaphysics, there is no necessary reason why this exception should be unique, once creation is posited. Maimonides would then have to accept the consequences of a created world in which our knowledge is fundamentally uncertain, since it rests on an inherently non-necessary natural order, one which endures only as long as God chooses. This is a modified kalam position,</page><page sequence="13">Strategies of Interpretation 125 allowing one to proceed with science and causal reasoning, while making our knowledge, and nature, contingent upon God's will. This does not seem to be such a terrible position religiously or scientifically, and insofar as it views scientific truths as contingent, while treating them as though they are necessary, it even has a modern ring. Maimonides, however, cannot accept this kalam position in principle, because it plays havoc with the rest of his philosophy. He must feel that the One cannot be the God of Aristotle and Plotinus for scientific purposes, and an unpredictable and unknown God for religious purposes. The modified kalam position may allow the world to endure "on its own" for as long as God wills, but it is not therefore truly open to scientific understanding, having no independent and necessary basis for its being. The mutakallim?n remain within an arbitrary universe, with makeshift explanations papering over a radical, epistemological, and hence ontological uncertainty. This the rational and good God of Maimonides would not tolerate, and neither can Maimonides. He thus turns to philosophy after his joust with the kalam, bloodied but unbowed. We have, however, indicated the cul-de-sac to which philosophy leads him. Just as his theology has brought him to a God who is an impersonal non-person, so his philosophy has reached this same being, that which is (or who is) being per se. To attribute personal characteristics to this being, to make it powerful, wise, living and possessed of a will which relates it to the world, is more than his theology or philosophy allow, or should allow. Both traditions, however, do personalize the deity in their medieval formulations, if to different degrees. Maimonides does not make God quite as personal as Halevi and others do, but he does argue strenuously for notions of providence and revelation which contain traditional concepts. However, the critical reader of the Guide will observe in the treatment of these topics the same pattern found in the issues already discussed. Maimonides will be found alternating between theological and philosophical views and styles of argument, using a combination of Aristotelian and Neoplatonic themes to avoid succumbing to theological or kalam-style discourse, but falling back upon it repeatedly. His defense of Jewish Law in the third part of the Guide, and his interpretation of the reasons for the commandments (ta'amei ha-misvot),43 return us quite clearly to the hermeneutical style with which he opens the book. V Maimonides, then, is torn between interpretive modes, and unable to choose between them. He would sorely like to put the kalam behind him, but cannot. Nor can he do without the Neoplatonic teachings which he supposedly does not</page><page sequence="14">126 Alfred L. Ivry consider worth studying. He does not admit his debt to these two sources, and is probably embarrassed by the inability of Aristotelian teachings alone to satisfy the religious cravings of one with philosophical interest; and embarrassed too by his own inability to effect that synthesis of faith and reason which he sought to achieve in writing the Guide. Many people will object to this last statement, seeing Maimonides as having achieved his goals brilliantly, his success measured in good part by the position of eminence accorded the Guide in the field of Jewish philosophy, and in the popular imagination as well. Maimonides' success was less apparent, however, to his most brilliant successors, Gersonides and Crescas. Crescas was radically opposed to much of Maimonides' philosophy on religious as well as rational grounds, while Gersonides was more sympathetic to it. Yet, believing Maimonides to be a strict Aristotelian, as he fancied himself, Gersonides could not understand Maimonides' philosophical compromises with that tradition. He also had little appreciation for Maimonides' hybrid style and methodology, his blending of dialectical and demonstrative argument.44 Gersonides preferred keeping such approaches separate, and in his non-exegetical investigations he zealously and exhaustively pursued each thesis on strictly philosophical lines. Gersonides' Wars of the Lord thus has an entirely different flavor than the Guide of the Perplexed, and is much more akin to the main philosophical literary tradition of the Western world, being in many ways a work of Hebrew Scholasticism. Yet it is the Guide, and not the Wars, which captured the imagination of most late medieval Jewish philosophers, and it is Maimonides' composition which influenced their own work. The exegetical mode of discourse remained attractive to Jewish philosophers, even if much of it was now turned to interpreting Maimonides' exegesis. Like Maimonides too, his successors frequently mixed their genres, moving with no apparent discomfort between philosophical and theological styles of argument. Consensus also escapes these thinkers and commentators, bringing to grief Maimonides' plan of resolving the anxieties of such persons. It is as though Maimonides has failed twice to resolve the issues he tackled in the Guide: failed once in his own name, and once again in the name of his interpreters. It is, however, possible to read Maimonides' "failure" more charitably, indeed, to see it as not only inevitable but desirable, even as a victory of sorts. Recall the interpretation Maimonides gave biblical terms, the paradoxical meanings he assigned to sensations, motions, and emotions. Words were seen to mean themselves and their direct opposites, to contain their opposites. Speech could be thought, action repose, and activity passivity. All discrete terms were collapsed into one, the essence of God emerging in a single term that yet encompassed all terms. This single term is sometimes called simply "existence," or "necessary existence," more often called "intellect." In both cases a purity and autonomy of being is</page><page sequence="15">Strategies of Interpretation 127 intended, a simplicity that devours all the multiplicity supposedly contained within it. We recognize the concept, but cannot understand how it functions as it supposedly does. We thus know and do not know God in Himself, we know the meaning of the terms which describe His essential nature, and know that they are inadequate to convey it fully. We understand His attributes more fully, but understand that they are not really His attributes at all. That which relates God to the world, which makes Him personal and providential, in the usual sense of these words, is not really part of His essence, we realize. This is the sober truth for the philosopher, that his knowledge of God's nature is very limited after all. Enough is known to use certain terms, but they must be used equivocally. Science brings us only so far. With Maimonides, we can accept the necessity for positing a divine being, called first cause or mover, or even form of the world and "creator," in some sense of that word. Science does not help us beyond that, however. It cannot bring us to the image of a personal God of the sort to which Judaism, as all three monotheistic faiths, is committed. Maimonides does affirm such a God, but recognizes it is a necessary projection of human nature to so conceive the deity. This does not make it wrong, for as necessary it cannot be wrong in principle; it is only wrong when taken literally. All the attributes of God can be predicated of Him, when properly understood, and can then be used in their popular meaning in the requisite circumstances even by the philosopher. Daringly, Maimonides sees this as the very message of the Bible itself, to the philosophers. Moses, who for Maimonides is unique among the prophets and all men in the intimacy of his relationship with God, and in the depth of his knowledge of the Lord, is yet limited in his understanding of the divine essence. As we are told in the Bible, Moses sees God's back and not His face.45 Maimonides interprets this to mean that Moses understood God's presence in human, political terms, the divine essence - God's face - not comprehended, not "seen" in any sense of the term.46 And this of Moses, who is reported to have talked with God "face to face."47 That "talk," even as God's "face," are for Maimonides figures of speech denoting the apprehension of God's presence, i.e., an apprehension of an essentially unknown being. For Maimonides, then, God disguises his nature even while revealing it, putting man in the cleft of the rock and then withholding from him the full comprehension he seeks. God "passes by," concealing His own face, allowing man to interpret His presence only in terms of its traces in human society, in socio-political and moral terms primarily.48 Maimonides has imitated the Bible, as he reads it, in presenting and witholding disclosures of this subject. There are many things philosophy can teach us, but there are also limits to the rational approach. The words of Scripture conceal even as they reveal, and so does the language of the Guide. This very ambiguity in Maimonides' composition has kept it in the public and scholarly eye throughout the centuries. The Guide has become an institution of</page><page sequence="16">128 Alfred L. Wry interpretation in large part because of the inadequacy of the interpretive instruments on which Maimonides depended. This inadequacy, however, is their strength, yielding always to new constructions, leading us on to the seemingly infinite permutations of language, bringing us ever closer to the mystery of existence, to the ineffable being who is. One would like to believe Maimonides ultimately came to terms with this understanding which his investigations forced upon him, that he accepted the impossibility of resolving the complexities of life as Judaism has formulated them both through the study of the Law and philosophically. It is his very attempt to force the issues toward resolution, to guide the perplexed once and for all, which has illustrated the impossiblity of the task. NOTES This essay is dedicated to the cherished memory of Frank Talmage, whom I knew from student days at Brand?is University. Oral presentations of this material were given at a conference on "The Institutions of Interpretation" sponsored by the Center for Literary Studies of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Sanford Budick, Director, in 1989; and at the 1990 meeting in New Orleans of the Central Division of the American Philosophical Association, with Barry Kogan as respondent. My thanks to Professors Budick and Kogan for their encouragement and comments. 1.

As was common in his day, he subsumes as Aristotelian much which is borrowed from Neoplatonic sources. He remains hostile, however, to the hypostatic structures of Neoplatonic thought, and to its basically Platonic dualism. 3.
