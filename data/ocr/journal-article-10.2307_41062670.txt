Psalm 2:6 in Light of Egyptian Royal Ideology Gard Granerod MF Norwegian School of Theology, Oslo Abstract The author discusses whether or not MT Ps 2:6 (in particular the verb m[Vl) reflects Egyptian royal ideology as the one evident in "Ptah's Decree to Ramesses". He tentatively concludes that the verse historically reflects a concept where the god procreates the human king. Semantically, the verb "JD1 might originally have denoted the emission of semen, either after the model of or at least in a way comparable to "Ptah's Decree to Ramesses" (c. 1 3th- 1 lth centuries BCE). The common translation by means of a legal term "to install" etc. reflects the LXX. LXX Ps 2:6 might represent a theological correction of what the translators considered to be a case of an intolerable anthropomorphism in the Hebrew text. Keywords royal ideology, "Ptah's Decree to Ramesses", "son of God", Psalm 2:6, *]DJ I. Hie Background of the King's Divine Sonship in Psalm 2 In biblical scholarship, Psalm 2 is often considered as one of the indispens- able sources for the reconstruction of the idea of kingship - and perhaps divine kingship for that matter - in ancient Israel, and one to be linked with the other royal psalms, 2 Samuel 7, and other prophetic texts. Today, many scholars (but not all)1 date Psalm 2, or at least the motifs we find in the core x) For instance, F.-L. Hossfeld and E. Zenger understand Psalm 2 as a post-exilic psalm that is strongly influenced by Egyptian, Hellenistic royal ideology and Neo-Assyrian royal propaganda.

One issue often discussed is the question of the relation between the royal ideology found in Psalm 2 and the royal ideologies of the rest of the ancient Near East. The question is in what direction one should look in order to find relevant parallels. The ancient Near East is a broad term both geographically, culturally, religiously and historically. Ancient Israel/Judah found itself located between the Egyptian cultural sphere to the west and the Mesopota- mian culture to the east. As for the latter, H. Ringgren was among those who compared Psalm 2 with a Mesopotamian oracle from the seventh century. In the oracle in question, the goddess Bëlit is addressing the Assyrian king Ashurbanipal. Ringgren questioned whether or not this Assyrian oracle was taken over in Israel and subsequently set a pattern there.4 Moreover, E. Otto has argued that the motif of the king as a shepherd, found in Ps 2:9, has its background in Neo-Assyrian royal ideology.5 The shepherd motif is evident in this verse when the Hebrew text is punctuated according to the reading of 2) Here, I will not discuss the question when an editor made Psalms 1-2 together function as an introduction to the entire book of Psalms; see e.g. A. Grund, "'Aus Gott geboren'. Zu Geburt und Identität in der Bildsprache der Psalmen", in D. Dieckmann and D. Erbele-Küster (eds.), "Du hast mich aus meiner Mutter Leib gezogen": Beiträge zur Geburt im Alten Testament (Biblisch-theologische Studien, 75; Neukirchen- Vluyn, 2006), pp. 99-120 (109). 3) See Ps 2:1 WF' "to be restless" and 2:9 Dlñn "you shall break" [Pin]. A third possible Ara- maism is found in v. 12 "11'lpWJ "kiss [the] son". In the case of Díñn (v. 9), the LXX reads rcoiuoiVEÎç cnjxoùç (2nd sg. future indicative from Ttoiuaívco "to herd, tend, lead to pasture"), reflecting the punctuation Dinri (root: Hin). In the case of the Aramaic word "II, the LXX has another reading (ôpa^aaGe TtaiÔeiaç, "Accept correction!"). 4) H. Ringgren, "Psalm 2 and Bëlit's Oracle for Ashurbanipal", in C. L. Meyers, M. P.

Koch has attempted to associate the motif of the rebellion of the nations, which we find in Ps 2:1-3, in particular with a Syro- Canaanite myth of the battle of nations.7 In Ps 2:7, the title "son of God" is not explicitly used. It is, however, implied: Ps 2:7 (NRSV): I will tell of the decree of the LORD: He said to me, "You are my son; today I have begotten you". What is the religio-historical background of this special father-son relation- ship between Yahweh and the king, which is also found in other OT texts?8 According to Koch, this form of royal address applied to the king cannot be found anywhere else than in Egypt. He criticizes the idea that the title "son of God" was a royal title throughout the entire ancient Near East.9 In Akka- dian literature, Koch argues, anyone, including the king, could be called "son of his god" {mar ilìsu). In other words, it did not represent anything beyond the conventions of the everyday language when a king was called a "son of his god", like anyone else. In contrast, in Egypt the title was exclusively used by the pharaohs. Koch argues therefore that the son of god imagery in Ps 2:7-9 is directly dependent upon Egyptian royal ideology, and in particular on texts from the Ramesside period. To this I will return later. First, I will briefly out- line the Egyptian myth usually referred to as the Myth of the Procreation and Birth of the King. II.

The most condensed pre- sentation of the Egyptian royal ideology is perhaps the so-called Myth of the Procreation and Birth of the King. This myth is most explicitly presented as a pictorial cycle of 1 5 reliefs, each representing a scene and accompanied by a text. The relief cycle is found in two Egyptian temples, the first dating to the 15th century and the second to about the 14th century BCE.10 The relief cycle begins with a statement that Amon, the king of the gods, decides to procreate a new king, to whom he will give dominance over the entire world. He finds a particular attractive woman, who happens to be the queen. Then, in the guise of the queen's husband, the king, he sleeps with her. According to the accompanying text, the odour of Amon (probably a euphemism for semen) impregnates the queens limbs. After that, Amon commands the god Khnum to create the child in his (Amon's) likeliness. Khnum was the creator of infants' bodies. He made them at a potter s wheel and placed each one of them in the womb of its mother. After that follow scenes describing how Khnum actually made the child, how the pregnancy was proclaimed to the queen, and scenes from the birth, followed by speeches directed to the child itself. Among other things, Amon, addressing the child, acknowledges his fatherhood. Iconographically, the god Amon is presented with the newborn child sitting on his lap while embracing it.11 III. The Verb ipi in Psalm 2:6- in the MT and the LXX In the following I will focus on the "son of God" concept, asking whether or not Ps 2:6 contains a forgotten reference to divine procreation. Ps 2:6 is over- shadowed by Ps 2:7 in terms of how much scholarly interest it attracts. According to the NRSV, Ps 2:6 reads "I have set my king on Zion, my holy 10) See H.

Here, the Hebrew verb is "TOOl According to Masoretic vocalization, this is a 1st sg. qatal qal oí *|D1 This particular verb is used approximately 20 times in the Hebrew Bible. In addition, there are several nominal derivations of the root "|O1 The core meaning of the verb ~'01 is "to pour out" a fluid. In Biblical Hebrew there are primarily two contexts where we find the verb and its derivations.12 Firstly, in metallurgy "JDJ describes the "pouring out" of mol- ten metal, the process of casting. Correspondingly, the derived nouns ^01 and riDDQ denote a cast image of a god. Secondly, in the language of the cult, ""[03 denotes the "pouring out" of libations and drink offerings. The verb is also used metaphorically in Isa 29:10, where Yahweh is said to have "poured out a spirit of deep sleep" over Jerusalem. The LXX version of Ps 2:6 contrast strongly with the MT version of the same verse: èyci) Ôè Kaxeax(x0T|v ßaaitauc i&gt;n' amov eki Iicov opoç xò ayiov ai)io'). But I have been made king by him on Zion, his holy mountain. In the MT the speaker is Yahweh himself. There the verb in this clause is an active form (1st sg. qatal qaloi '"[Dl), but in the LXX there is a passive form of the verb Koc9icrcr|ui (1st sg. aorist): "I have been made". Moreover, the MT has a 1st sg. suffix attached to the phrase "holy hill" ("on Zion, my holy hill"), while the Greek has a 3rd mase. sg. possessive pronoun ("on Zion, his holy mountain"). In addition, the phrase vny ocùtoû "by him" (the agent in the Greek passive construction) has no counterpart in the Hebrew text. Whether or not the LXX reflects another vocalization than the one found in the MT will not be discussed here. Instead, the focus will be on the seman- tics of the Greek verb mGicrcriui. Elsewhere in the LXX this verb is used to 12) It has been proposed in dictionaries and commentaries that there is also a root II "[DJ "to weave, entwine, shape", a by-form of II *pO "to weave, shape" (thus e.g. HALOT, s.v. II *]DJ, p. 703). This particular meaning of the root "JOJ, however, is only assumed in Prov 8:23: oVlUQ f"l«"&lt;rD'7(pp ''flDDJ, "From everlasting I was woven, from the beginning, before the earth came into being". The nominal derivation HDDQ "covering" occurs in Isa 25:7; 28:20. Several modern bible translations render "fOJ in Prov 8:23 by phrases such as "to be firmly set" (NJB), "to be set up" (NRSV) or "eingesetzt zu sein" (Lutherbibel), following the LXX version of Prov 8:23: Tipo too aicovoç E0eueX,íü)oév [Beue^ióco] U£ év àpxfì, "He established me before time was in the beginning . . ." The meaning "to weave" for this particular root is poorly attested. According to HALOT, there is a nominal derivation N3ÇPJ in Jewish Aramaic, a root "JD1 denoting "to weave" attested in Egyptian Aramaic and a similar root with similar meaning in Arabic (nasaja, cf. op. cit., s.v. II*TDJ, p. 703).</page><page sequence="6">328 G Graneredl Vêtus Testamentum 60 (2010) 323-336 express the act of commissioning someone to a particular office. For instance, in LXX Gen 39:4 Potiphar is reported to have made Joseph overseer over his house (kœ! Kaxeaxriaev oròiòv etcì toû o'íkod orOTOö). Here, the MT has the verb 7p£D (hiphit). A little later in the Joseph novella (LXX Gen 41:33), the LXX uses the verb Ka0iaxr||Lii to render the Hebrew verb TV0 (qal). Joseph interprets Pharaohs dream, saying "Now therefore let Pharaoh select a man who is discerning and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt". The difference between the expected meaning of the verb "JDJ in MT Ps 2:6 and the LXX verb kocOîottuii is remarkable. In all other contexts, the Hebrew verb ""[DJ denotes the "pouring out" of some kind of fluid. In contrast, the LXX Ps 2:6 implies some sort of official appointment. It seems that most modern Bible translations and commentaries follow the meaning of LXX Ka9iaTTi|ii in their translations. They use phrases such as "to set", "to install", etc. as renditions of the Hebrew ^01 However, in terms of morphology and syntax, the majority follows the MT, translating the verb as active and not passive as in the LXX. In the secondary literature to Psalm 2, the special meaning constructed for the verb ^01 in v. 6 is usually not mentioned. There are, however, some who note that the verb *TDW is "confusing" in the context of Psalm 2.13 A few have suggested textual emendations of the MT: (1) H. Gunkel proposed the conjectural reading "TDD-?, i.e. 1st sg. qatal niphal of "[01, meaning "ich bin geforstet". This particular meaning he saw attested in the noun II ^ppJ "leader, chief of a tribe".14 HALOT follows Gunkels proposal and renders the verb by "to be consecrated, be made leader (with a libation)".15 (2) H. Gese, criticizing Gunkels proposal to relate the verb root "JOJ with the assumed noun II fp^, has instead proposed the punctuation "T13D1, i.e. 1st sg. qatal niphal of "pD "to weave (in a marvellous manner)", based on Psalm 139: 13) Koch: "rätselshaft", cf. idem, "Der König als Sohn Gottes", pp. 1-32 (esp. 14), cf. idem, "Israel im Orient", pp. 242-271 (esp. 255). 14) H.

Koch argues that Ps 2:6b should be translated "Ich habe meinen König mit Gußopfer geweiht/ gesalbt" }* 1 . Egyptian Royal Ideology In the following, I will proceed from the premise that the "son of God" motif evident in Psalm 2 is dependent upon Egyptian royal ideology (cf. Koch). Provided that this premise is correct, then the question arises: Is it possible that the background of the enigmatic verb ^VOÜÍ (Ps 2:6) is also found in Egyptian concepts about the king as god's son? As already mentioned, the cycle of 15 reliefs describing the mythical birth of pharaoh as the result of a sexual union between Amon and the queen dates to the 1 5th- 1 4th centuries BCE, several centuries before the rise of the Israelite monarchy. However, the Egyptian myth of the procreation and birth of the king is also found in an important text that is chronologically much closer to the Israelite monarchy. It comes from the Ramesside period (19th-20th dynasties, c. 13th- 11th centuries BCE) and is attested in five 16) H. Gese, Natus ex Virgine , in idem, Vom Sinai zum Zion: alttestamentliche Beiträge zur biblischen Theologie (Beiträge zur evangelischen Theologie, 64; München, 1974), pp. 130-146 (esp. 138-139) [originally published in FS von Rad, 1971]. 17) M. Dahood, Psalms 1-50 (AB, 16; Garden City, 1966), p. 10. 18) Koch, "Der König als Sohn Gottes", pp. 1-32 (12, 14). As to the assumed Egyptian origin of such a consecration/anointing Koch points to a certain iconographie motif in the cycle of paintings depicting the myth of the birth of the pharaoh. The scene is frequently referred to as the "baptism of Pharaoh", cf. op. cit., p. 14 and figs. 343, 345 in Keel, Die Welt der altorien- talischen Bildsymbolik und das Alte Testament. The interpretation of this scene which Koch builds upon is that Amon and another deity sprinkle the child (the king) with "Lebenswasser". This interpretation is contested according to Koch.</page><page sequence="8">330 G Granered/ Vêtus Testamentum 60 (2010) 323-336 different versions and usually referred to as the Decree or Blessing ofPtah upon Ramesess II and III In the Ramesside period, Ptah, who was originally worshipped as the god of craftsmen in Memphis, had been grouped with Amon and Re. Together, they represented a national and universal divine triad. In the text in question, Ptah addresses King Ramesses II (Pharaoh Ramesses III in later copies). It has been translated by Kenneth A. Kitchen: 263:5 I am your father who begot you among the gods, all of your body being from the gods.

Therefore, it seems pertinent to ask: Is it possible that the religio-historical background of Ps 2:6 in general and the verb *"[0J in particular should be sought in an Egyptian myth similar to the one reflected in Ptahs oracle to Ramesses? Is it possible that Ps 2:6 offers, at least to modern ears, an extreme anthropomorphism in which Yahweh is depicted in a procreative context, as one "pouring out" his life-giving semen? Several things indicate that the answer might be yes. 2. Comparative Linguistics When the verb "[OJ is used in North-West Semitic languages other than Bibli- cal Hebrew, it is apparently never used with the meaning "to install" as we read in modern Bible translations of Ps 2:6. Mostly, the verb is used in the context of metallurgy, meaning "to cast".23 The Sfire inscription from the mid-eighth century BCE oifers a construction in Aramaic, comparable to the one found in Ps 2:6 (""[DJ + bv + object, KAI 222 A 26-27). In the Aramaic text, the construction means "to pour out over, to shower upon": "...[Es möge ausgießen Ha] dad alles Böse auf der Erde und im Himmel und alles Übel; und er möge ausgießen über Arpad [Hagel- kör]ner'" As already mentioned, Gunkel argued that the meaning of the verb "JDJ in Psalm 2 can be derived from the noun "^pDl This noun, which is probably of Akkadian origin, is used with the meaning "prince" or "chieftain" a few times in North-West Semitic languages,24 including Biblical Hebrew. This is also one of the reasons for the textual emendations accepted by HALOT. Yet it still remains an open question whether this Akkadian loanword is etymologi- cally related to "[01, the verb in question. In any case, the verb never has the special meaning "to install" in any of the known occurrences in other North- West Semitic languages. The special meaning "to install" is only attested in the Greek translation of "[DJ found in LXX Ps 2:6 (Ka9iaTr|(j.i). 23) J. Hoftijzer and K. Jongeling, Dictionary of the North-West Semitic Inscriptions (2 vols.; Handbuch der Orientalistik, 1. Abteilung, Der Nahe und Mittlere Osten, 21; Leiden, 1995), s.v. nski, pp. 735-736. 24) Hoftijzer and Jongeling, Dictionary of the North-West Semitic Inscriptions, s.v. nsyk, p. 735.</page><page sequence="10">332 G. Granerodl Vêtus Testamentum 60 (2010) 323-336 So it seems clear that there are no strong arguments based on comparative linguistics necessitating the translation "to install", even though this transla- tion has become the usual one. 3. The Literary Context of Psalm 2:6 More importantly, in the immediate context in Psalm 2 there are clear exam- ples of procreative terminology. In Psalm 2:7, Yahweh is quoted as saying "I have begotten you [TÎH*??]"- In lignt of this lexical field the possibility exists that the verb "[01 refers specifically to the act of begetting, the emission of semen. 4. Chronological and Cultural Proximity between u Ptahs Decree" and the Early Israelite Monarchy Moreover, as mentioned, in "Ptahs decree to Ramesses", Ptah addresses Pha- raoh Ramesses II (1303-1213 BCE; in a later version it is Ramesses III, 1186-1155 BCE). During the Ramesside period Canaan continued to be under Egyptian influence. Egyptian influence was not only political but also cultural, affecting the local royal courts of Canaan.25 Keel, Koch, Otto and other scholars refer to the cycle of 15 wall reliefs dating to the 15th-l4th centuries in order to trace the background of Psalm 2. I do not oppose this. On the contrary, I would like to emphasize the fact that "Ptahs decree" stems from a time closer to the Israelite monarchy and its literature, including an assumed early version of Psalm 2, or at least the motifs the psalm contains. 5. Ancient Near Eastern Concepts about Human Conception and Prenatal Growth So far I have argued that there does not seem to be any linguistic reason to translate ~[V2 by "to install". On the contrary, there are reasons to consider the hypothesis that the background of the enigmatic verb "[03 in Psalm 2 is found in Egyptian concepts about the king as gods son. A side-glance at ancient Near Eastern concepts about human conception shows that the semen was thought to be the substance from which life was created. Today, we know that reproduction is accomplished by the fusion of a sperm cell and an egg. 25) See e.g. H. Kiengel (ed.), Kulturgeschichte des alten Vorderasien (Veröffentlichungen des Zen- tralinstituts fur Alte Geschichte und Archäologie der Akademie der Wissenschaft der DDR, 18; Berlin, 1989), pp. 271-276.</page><page sequence="11">G Granerodl Vêtus Testamentum 60 (2010) 323-336 333 In the history of reproductive medicine, however, this is a modern discovery. Before the discovery of the ovum and the ovary, and before it was discovered that a fusion of a sperm cell and an ovum is necessary for reproduction, peo- ple generally understood a child to be the product of its father's semen. Pro- creation was understood in agricultural terms: the male semen was the seed, the female uterus the soil.26 The importance of the semen in the conception and growth of the foetus is attested in the Hebrew Bible.27 Although poetical, the book of Job offers an embryology illustrating how people in an ancient Near Eastern setting conceived of procreation and the growth of the foetus: Job 10:8-12 (NRSV): Your hands fashioned and made me; and now you turn and destroy me. 9 Remember that you fashioned me like clay; and will you turn me to dust again? 10 Did you not pour me out ftp'Tiri &lt; *JI"U] like milk and curdle me like cheese? x x You clothed me with skin and flesh, and knit me together with bones and sinews. 12 You have granted me life and steadfast love, and your care has preserved my spirit, [my emphasis] Job compares the semen in utero with milk that has been poured out. The conception of a human child is compared to making cheese from coagulated milk. In addition, the passage in Job 10:8-12 uses two other images. In the first, the growth of the foetus is explained by means of a weaving metaphor in v. 11 (man as fruit of the loom). In the second, the conception and prena- tal growth is explained by means of a pottery metaphor in v. 9, echoing Khnum creating children on a potter's wheel, according to the Egyptian Myth of the Procreation and Birth of the King.

Nevertheless, the following question arises: Is it possible that "jnj, the verb in Job 10:10, functions synonymously with yol, the verb used in Psalm 2? IV. Concluding Remarks Did the ancient Israelites really believe that their God had physically procre- ated the king? In light of what has been argued above, one could perhaps assume that the answer is yes. However, one has to make several modifications. The primary aim of this study has been to criticize the usual translation of Ps 2:6 and the verb "]DJ there. Instead of constructing a special meaning of the verb that is solely attested in this particular psalm, and instead of emending the Hebrew text, I have proposed that the verb originally referred to the activity of procreation. This is a question concerning semantics, not pragmatics. If the inhabitants of, say, Jerusalem borrowed parts of their royal ideology from Egypt, e.g. in the Ramesside period, it may very well be that a procreative interpretation of the verb "[Dl in a context identical to or similar with Ps 2:6 existed for a period in Canaan and perhaps also in early Israel. Nevertheless, as for the pragmatics, the context in which we now find the verb "'OÌ in Psalm 2 - the book of Psalms and the Hebrew Bible - speaks against such a highly physical interpretation. Firstly, Psalm 2 does not men- tion any "mother" who could provide "the soil" in which the semen could grow in utero. On the contrary, according to Ps 2:6 the possible conception takes place "on Zion, my holy hill". Although it cannot be proved, the possibility exists that "Zion" herself in this context actually represents the female counterpart.28 Nevertheless, there is no explicit mention of a physical uterus. Secondly, the phrase Di*n "today" in Ps 2:7 functions as a hermeneuti- cal key to the received text: "I will tell of the decree of Yahweh. He said to me, 'You are my son, today I have begotten you'". These two observations indicate that we are dealing with a metaphorical usage of the possible procreative terminology in the received biblical text. Since von Rad published his essay "Das judäische Königsritual" shortly after the Second World War, the most usual interpretation has been that the father-son relationship in Psalm 2 refers to an adoption.29 Dl*n, the argument 28) See e.g. Ps 132:13 "For Yahweh has chosen Zion, he has desired her [P1ÌN] for his seat". 29) G. von Rad, "Das judäische Königsritual", in idem, Gesammelte Studien zum Alten Testament (TB, 8; Munich, 3rd edn, 1965), pp. 205-213 (209). For "adoption" in the Bible and its</page><page sequence="13">G. Gmnerodl Vêtus Testamentum 60 (2010) 323-336 335 goes, marks a difference between the royal ideology of Egypt and that of Israel. Regardless of whether or not the latter was dependent upon Egyp- tian traditions, the word "today" and the lack of any reference to a mother make a literal, physical interpretation of Yahweh's act of begetting Oprn^?) impossible. Concerning Ps 2:6 in the context of the entire Hebrew Bible, one can also add a third point. The other OT texts depicting the Israelite king as "son of God" all speak, more clearly than in the case of Psalm 2, of a sonship in terms of adoption. For instance, in the so-called Nathan prophecy (2 Samuel 7) Yah weh is said to choose David and make him his son. According to this text, David was originally not Yahweh's son. On the contrary, Yahweh "took" him while he was a shepherd. According to the Nathan prophecy, David receives royal dignity due to Yahweh's election, not because he was born as "son of God" in the first place. The Jews who translated the Hebrew Bible into Greek probably worked in Egypt, perhaps in Alexandria, and probably during the Ptolemaic period.30 According to K. Koch, no pharaonic births after the Ramesside period are explained by means of the myth evident in the cycle of 1 5 reliefs or by means of a decree like the one Ptah spoke to Ramesses. This brings us to the first millennium BCE, when the Egyptian birth myth underwent a development and was transferred from birth of kings to birth of deities, or more precisely, deities that were considered to be younger than the traditional and estab- lished ones. But according to Koch, the myth does reappear in a burlesque form as late as in the Hellenistic period in the so-called "Jewish Alexander legend". Yet, despite the historical developments, there was at the same time continuity in the Egyptian royal ideology.31 The LXX translators lived in a milieu where one can assume that there was still some sort of knowledge about Egypt's magnificent past. The Rosetta Stone, for example, was commissioned by Ptolemy V in c. 1 96 BCE. Its tri- lingual inscription is written in Greek, Demotic and also in hieroglyphs. Therefore, we must ask if the Jewish translators of the LXX also had some knowledge about the ancient Egyptian royal ideology. The possibility exists that the translators recognized a case of an unbearable anthropomorphism in the Hebrew text of Ps 2:6. When the Hebrew text of Psalm 2 was read in ancient Near Eastern context, see H. Donner, "Adoption oder Legitimation?", in idem, Aufsätze zum Alten Testament aus vier Jahrzehnten (BZAW, 224; Berlin, 1994), pp. 34-66. 30) J. M. Dines, The Septuagint (London, 2004), pp. 41-62. 31) See Koch, "Der König als Sohn Gottes", pp. 1-31 (10-1 1).</page><page sequence="14">336 G Granered/ Vêtus Testamentum 60 (2010) 323-336 light of the Egyptian royal ideology, they may have thought that the birth of the king was depicted in a far too physical way. If that is the case, it should not be surprising that the assumed Jewish translators changed the procreation terminology into a legal one - from the Hebrew "I [referring to Yah weh] have poured out my king on Zion, my holy mountain" to the Greek "I [refer- ring to the king] have been installed as king [éyo) 5e KaiecrcáGriv ßaoiAei)c] by him on Zion, his holy mountain". There are reasons to question why the translations of Ps 2:6 should be closer to the LXX than to the Hebrew text with respect to the question of the meaning of the verb 701 Above, I have attempted to use as a point of depar- ture the "Egyptological approach" to Psalm 2 argued for, among others, by K. Koch. Here, however, an alternative explanation to this verb has been pro- posed, nevertheless one that is still on the basis of the same Egyptian sources Koch refers to, particularly "Ptah's decree to Ramesses". Therefore, if it is cor- rect to look for the religio-historical background of Psalm 2 in Egypt, then Ps 2:6 portrays Yahweh as "the Procreator of kings".</page></plain_text>
