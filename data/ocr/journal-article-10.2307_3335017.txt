<plain_text><page sequence="1">Stylistic Analysis of African Art: A Reassessment of Olbrechts'"Belgian Method" DANIEL J. CROWLEY In 1946, Frans M. Olbrechts, the then-Director of the Musee Royal du Congo Belge in Tervuren near Brussels, published a monograph, Plastiek ian Kongo, which William Fagg has called "the classical work on Belgian Congo sculpture," and "the most systematic work yet produced for any large field of African art." Originally written as an extended catalogue for an exhibition entitled "The Arts of the Belgian Congo" held in the Festival Hall of Antwerp in 1937-38, the Flemish edition was delayed by the war until 1946, but since Flemish is read by so few scholars, far more devastating was the fact that the French translation by Gilles de Pelichy was not published until thirteen years later in 1959 after Olbrechts' death. As a result, his major contribution was little read and hence failed to have the impact on African art scholarship that it deserves. Although obviously badly needed, an English translation sponsored by the late Daryll Forde of the Inter- national African Institute in 1966 was effectively blocked by various political, linguistic, and nationalistic forces in Belgium, culminating in the "definitive loss" by the publisher of the negatives of the indispensable plates, mak- ing any future publication prohibitively expensive. Housed in a disused Exhibition Building at the end of a streetcar line outside Brussels, the Musee Royal du Congo Belge/Koninklijk Museum voor Belgische Kongo, in these post-colonial but still monarchist days euphemized to the Royal Museum of Central Africa, was planned as a show- case of Belgian policy in the Congo, now Zaire, whose flora, fauna, geology, geography, town planning, and in- dustrial development were featured in admirable displays. With the rise of interest in African art after World War I, Olbrechts was put in charge of developing exhibits of their incomparable collection of Central African art and material culture unequaled by any other museum on earth, least of all in Zaire itself. His independent and rational ap- proach was soon exemplified in outstanding displays com- bining the art with the pertinent ceramics, basketry, tools, and details of geographical and cultural context, well lighted and captioned, and with ethnographic facts and maps readily available. Under Olbrechts' successors and disciples, notably Maesen, van Geluwe, and Bastin, the Museum remains a major shrine of African art in Europe. This same strong anthropological approach provided the rationale behind the 1937 exhibition and its catalogue. The displays included historical materials of the Belgian presence in Africa, and European painting and sculpture inspired by the Congo as well as traditional African art. Olbrechts' stated goal was (1) to bring to light important African art objects previously known only to private col- lectors; (2) to demonstrate the full range of traditional styles in the Congo; and (3) to show the social as well as the esthetic functions of the art. Although he felt that he had largely achieved these goals, he regretted not being able to spend more research time on "stylistic analysis, the study and meticulous description of different style characteristics, the function of the work of art in its culture, [and] the personality and technique of the artists," topics most of which "are treated here for the first time," and which remain the major issues facing the discipline to- day. Characteristically, Olbrechts begins his discussion of African art with an enumeration of its general characteristics as exemplified in figures: (1) absence of realistic bodily proportions; (2) exaggeration of the size of the head; (3) frontality and vertical symmetry; (4) static poses; and (5) little use of color, and that only in areas of strong European contact. He points out that although masks can also be classified by regions of origin, their 3, GALLO R I0 ,IN.

He recognized the wide stylistic differences in a single region among objects made in wood, clay, and metal, as well as those serving dif- ferent institutions and/or functions, and pointed out the pernicious results of the introduction of foreign tools, techniques, materials, and concepts of use and beauty. Although outdated today, his clarification of the term "fetish" and rejection of "idol" were as important con- tributions as his recognition that the sculptures were not "obscene" in their cultural contexts. Olbrechts approached the study of style atomistically, and isolated the following basic aspects of sculpture wherein style characteristics are manifested: (1) posture of the figure; (2) proportions; (3) details of torso; (4) hairdress; (5) cicatrizations; (6) eyes; (7) ears; (8) mouth; (9) nose; (10) hands; (11) feet; and (12) costume. He then went on to divide Central Africa into five basic Stylistic Regions, each with several styles and substyles, and devoted a chapter of the monograph to each Region. The Lower Congo Stylistic Region. The Lower Congo Stylistic Region includes southern Congo Brazzaville, Cabinda, and Zaire west of a line from Mbandaka (Coquilhatville) to Feshi and down into northwestern Angola, and is subdivided into (1) the Coastal Style of the ancient Kingdom of Kongo around the mouth of the river; (2) the Kwango Style to the east; and (3) the Teke Style to the north. The Coastal Style, strongly influenced by Western con- tact over the last several centuries, is in a state of decline with few artists still working. Their art is relatively realistic, often polychromed, and features "Mother and Child" figures of wood and stone used in ancestor cults and as grave markers. True fetishes are also found here, and are thought to become the temporary abode of spirits through the insertion of magical ingredients in them, after which they may work good or evil, kill or cure, or protect villages and individuals against witches. The Kwango Style includes Yaka, Pende, and Mbala substyles, and is strong in standing figures, staffs of chiefs, and several types of initiation masks. Yaka masks and figures come in two styles, one with large, fleshy noses, and another with unique turned-up noses. Pende art includes large wooden death masks with lowered eyelids and raffia hair, as well as small ivory pectorals representing these large masks, but few figures. Mbala figures are subdivided into elongated face, enlarged face, and diamond-faced sub- styles. The Teke Style includes Fumu and Humbu sculpture and takes the form of figures containing apertures in which children's afterbirths are preserved. The faces of these figures are striated to represent cicatrization, and often have short, square, beard-like ornaments on their chins. Teke Style has affiliations with the Fang and other peoples to the north. The Kuba Stylistic Region. The Kuba Stylistic Region centers on that powerful federation of peoples of the former Kasai Province plus such related peoples as the Lele, Wongo, Dengese, Yaelima, Kutshu, Tetela, Kete, and Lulua. Two styles exist side by side, a Court Style and a Folk Style, the former used by the royal court and the many levels of courtiers and administrators. Olbrechts describes the eighteen statues of Kuba kings brought together for the first time 44</page><page sequence="3">for this exhibition, differentiating between the nine in presumably ancient royal Court Style and the remainder in a newer but similar style he terms the Revived Court Style. He describes how carved symbols on the bases of these statues have been used to identify eleven of the kings known also from the reports of traditional court genealogists, but questions whether the portraits were made while the kings they represent were living, which would make them the oldest known African art in wood. Since ancestor worship has given way to a state cult of veneration of dead rulers, Kuba sculptures in the Folk Style are relatively rare, and take the form of abstract animal divination figures, wooden and ceramic cups in abstract and human forms, and boxes, adzes, and other ob- jects decorated with carved human heads. The five types of masks he delineates are less easily assigned to particular areas or ethnic groups, and he does not even mention the famous Kuba "Kasai velvet" raffia pile-cloth mats, although he admits to the richness of Kuba crafts. His implication that all the objects in Folk Style are made for the general populace rather than for the court and its retainers has proven incorrect in the light of subsequent field research. The Lulua Style of this area is exemplified in slim, elegant standing figures with bulges between the joints of the arms and legs, many raised cicatrizations, and horn- shaped protruding navels, plus squatting figures with elbows on knees thought to be fetishes against dysentery. The Luba Stylistic Region. The Luba Stylistic Region extends south from a line between Mbandaka and Bujumbura, and east of the borders of the Kuba and Lower Congo Regions all the way into northeastern Angola and northwestern Zambia. This style is marked by round, smooth, plump forms, gracefully arranged arms and legs, domed foreheads, relatively realistic proportions but elongated hands and feet, and great care in the execution of details. The favorite subject of Luba artists is womankind, particularly female ancestresses represented as caryatids on stools, drums, and neckrests, or bowls, pipes, canes, bow-rests, and divination figures. He differentiates at least six styles, the most impor- tant of which is that of the Central Region or Luba proper, indicated by rounded forms, realistically detailed cicatriza- tions, cross-shaped hairdresses, female caryatids, and small figurines in boar's tooth ivory. On pages 69-71, Olbrechts describes his basic "Belgian" method of painstakingly analyzing each characteristic of a number of similar pieces to find which characteristics prove diagnostic for categorizing substyles. Then if one of the pieces is adequately documented as to provenience and/or function, others of its category can be provisionally documented as well. This method, laborious but simple, is essentially a museum technique, but how rarely it has been used! Even today, the provenience of most African art is decided by dealers, collectors, and museums on the basis of only one or two stereotypic characteristics chosen ar- bitrarily, with no attempt being made to "prove" the at- tribution. Historians of African art obviously need to do this kind of laborious museum research to put our sub- discipline on a footing comparable to that of other conti- nents. The first step would be an archive of photographs of all published specimens with their documentation, so that comparative studies may begin in earnest. The greatest tour-de-force Olbrechts achieved with his method was the isolation of the second Luba style, which he called the Long-Faced Buli Style, attributing some ten ":I a~ t.i" a ~: f, 1,9~"": / ?rr a :&amp;" i: ,' 6~ t i CHOICE OLD PAIR OF IBEJI FEMALE FIGURES * HEIGHT 21.59 CM.

A WIND IN AFRICA Bambara antelope headdresses (Mali) by Pascal James Imperato, M.D. The fascinating and moving account of the author's five years of dedicated work to control communicable diseases and deliver mobile health services in Mali. Traveling over 200,000 miles of bush tracks, the author came to know all of Mali's little known regions in an intimate way. This is a heartwarming narrative which unifies a comprehensive vivid description of contemporary Mali, the author's personal experiences and a richly detailed description of the country's traditional societies - the Bambara, Dogon, Peul, Tuareg, Bobo, Marka, Maure, Senufo and Sarakole and their art forms. Combining the skills of physician, anthropo- logist and African Art historian, the author presents a unique portrait of Mali, its peoples and their art traditions. 363 pages, 50 black and white photos, 6 maps, Price, $12.50 WARREN H.

These sculptures include "Kabila," the famous kneeling woman holding a bowl at Tervuren, eight single or double caryatid stools scattered in European museums, plus one male standing figure, and later Mme. Olbrechts found a pair of small gnomelike figures in a shop in Evian. The sensitive treatment of the elongated face with arched brows, half-closed eyes, and projecting lips gives the effect of "profound meditation, resignation, and humility" which makes these among the chefs d'oeuvres of African art. Their maker and place of origin will remain unknown, because only two are documented even to place of collection at Buli, a small market-town on the Lualaba River. Transitional between Kuba and Luba, the Songye Style shows great stylistic diversity and was still being produced in Olbrechts' time, even in Kananga (Luluabourg) where some Songye had settled outside their own area. He found their major characteristics to be a preponderance of standing figures and busts of "Cubist" conception, with distended abdomens, large hands and feet, diamond- shaped noses, horizontal figure-eight mouths, eyes made of inlaid cowrie shells, and the use of metal decorations. Horn fetishes are a form limited to the Songye and Luba. The Kanioka Style is marked by slimmer, more elongated treatment of the body, with pointed noses, hypertrophied upper eyelids, and protuberant upper lips, and occurs on cups, stools, neckrests, pipes, and some genre subjects such as the figure of a woman with pestle in hand pounding in a mortar, which looks suspiciously like early "airport art." The Chokwe and Lunda Styles, although classed together, are differentiable through stylistic analysis. Pure Chokwe Style can be identified through columnar torsos, monumental headdresses, masked subjects, hemispheric eyes with half-closed lids, large mouths, and horizontal jut- ting beards, and male subjects occur as frequently as female. Chairs of European inspiration with genre scenes on their backs and splats, neckrests, stools, canes, mortars, combs, whistles, and animal figures are made in this style, and many are decorated with brass nailheads. Lunda Style combines Luba roundness with Chokwe subjects and details, and often the figures have mitre-shaped hairdresses and incised furrows along their spines. The Chokwe and Lunda have served as transmitters of Luba art traditions in such forms as caryatid stools to the north and west, where the Yaka, Pende, and other peoples have adopted them into their own art. The Eastern Luba Style includes the Bembe, Buye, Guha (Holoholo), Tabwa, Bemba, and Aushi along the western shore of Lake Tanganyika down into Zambia, and is sub- divided into northern, central, and southern substyles. The forms are stylized, with the faces made of two planes which meet in a ridge through the eyes, and the bodies having zigzag profiles resulting from the planar treatment of their parts. The Northwestern Stylistic Region. Olbrechts considered the art of the Congo north of the three areas discussed above to be infinitely inferior, with the exception of the Luba-influenced Lega at the far southeastern corner of the northern area. He further divided the north vertically along the 24 parallel of east longitude, and postulated that so little study of its art had been made because fewer pieces exist and their styles are unattractive in European eyes. This situation is partially explained by the poverty of the country, the hunting and 46</page><page sequence="5">gathering economy of its inhabitants, and their lack of in- stitutions such as fetishism, initiation rites, and ancestor worship, which require sculpture. The Ndaka, Mituku, Nkundo, Togbo, Bwaka, Banda, Mongo, Banza, and Ngbandi all produce stiff, symmetrical standing figures with arms hanging down at their sides, spherical heads with incised hair, atrophied breasts, pierced ears, nostrils, and sometimes lips, and in some cases eyes made of inlaid European glass trade beads, and cicatrizations running down the forehead and nose. These standing figures without sex differentiation are used as tomb guardians, and their style characteristics are too variable and unstable to be isolated further. The Northeastern Stylistic Region. In the northeast, the Mangbetu and Azande, ancient in- vaders from the Sudan, are the leading sculptors, produc- ing musical instruments, daggers, and cylindrical boxes either in human form or decorated with carved forms representing women with heads elongated in childhood and exaggerated by coiffures. Ceramic jugs with similar female heads are made, but Olbrechts estimates that these are modern, and that even the tradition of making wooden and bark figures "only dates back a few decades." Although Biebuyck's recent monograph Lega Culture (Berkeley and Los Angeles, University of California Press, 1973) answers most of the questions Olbrechts had about the meaning and function of Lega art in wood and ivory, it should be noted that he recognized the importance of this then-virtually-unknown style and its connection with the Bwami Society. The Lega artists' "unparalleled in- geniousness in depicting human forms fantastically" struck him as "both logical and impressive," and he spawned two still-lively controversies by postulating a Muslim source for the point-circle design found on Lega ivories, and by pointing out the wide distribution of the concave or "heart- shaped" face in African art. The second half of Olbrechts' monograph is devoted to analyzing the relationship between art and culture in seven chapters. In "Sources of Inspiration" he points out the preference of Congolese sculptures for the human figure, and particularly the female form represented in a variety of poses, or even an assemblage of body parts as in some Kuba cups and Mangbetu musical instruments. Olbrechts explains this preference as resulting from ancestor worship plus widespread belief in anthropomorphic mythical beings and spirits, as against totemic belief which would have resulted in animal ancestor figures as among the Northwest Coast Indians. Furthermore, domesticated animals are un- important in Congo cultures, but slaves and servants representing status appear on sculpture to express the power and importance of political leaders, as in the famed statues of the Kuba kings. Human figures in many postures as well as busts and heads appear on virtually every kind of object carved in the Congo from the great caryatid stools of the Luba to the most ordinary tools and household uten- sils. When animal motifs do occur, as among the Chokwe, Olbrechts somewhat questionably traces their introduction to "Hamitic" nomads whom he believes also introduced cattle-keeping to the Herrero. A few animal figures are made, particularly the itwomba divination objects made by the Kuba representing quadrupeds combining the characteristics of dogs and crocodiles. They also derive decorative motifs from antelope heads and horns, lizards, chameleons, and insects called mutuchembe. Lower Congo nail fetishes are sometimes made in the form of dogs, and snake and frog motifs also occur there, while the Mangbetu JG E N. Z.

Plant motifs are so rare in the Congo that they can almost always be traced to foreign influence, but "skeuomorphic" motifs occur when artists transfer the form of one medium into another such as representing basketry in woodcarving or textile designs in ceramics. Besides redefining "fetish" and "idol" in his discussion of the relationship between religion and art, Olbrechts pointed out that the term "ancestor figure" is used to describe many figures which have no connection with ancestor worship, and that any given object may have more than one function. For instance, Luba female figures holding bowls are used to receive gifts on the occasion of the birth of a baby, to hold white clay (mpembe) used as facial and body paint during rituals, and as a means of in- directly requesting alms from one's friends. He makes somewhat farfetched comparisons between this very limited redistribution of wealth to that of Northwest Coast potlatches or to the functions of the Bwami Society among the Lega. The ancestor cult takes different forms in different stylistic areas, from the realistic funerary figures placed on graves in the Lower Congo through the tomb guardians of the northwest to the figurative canes and scepters of the Luba and royal Kuba statues. In these latter areas, the ancestor cult has become the cult of the state as in Benin and Ashanti. Magical figures also occur, such as Songye horn fetishes and Lower Congo nail fetishes, but "the Supreme Being recognized by virtually all the peoples of the Congo is never represented in their sculpture." Olbrechts called for more study of the symbolism of AS?4k4 PAINTINGS BY CHIEF Z.K . OLORUNTOBA r i gesture and pose in Congolese art, quoting Peeraer to the effect that Luba figures with heads turned sideways repre- sent Umba the Mad, an evil spirit, and that hermaphroditic figures are made when the sex of a spirit being placated is unknown. He reported Bittremieux' discovery that the Woyo represent proverbs in symbolic form on their carved pot lids, but how delighted he would be with Victor Turner's later work on the symbol systems of the Lunda Ndembu across the border in Zambia. Another important contribution of Olbrechts was his recognition that all African art is not religious in content, but that much is utterly secular and even political, in the service of chefferies which have some of the characteristics of Medieval courts, with vassals, courtiers, patronage, and court artists producing objects for the pleasure and glory of their ruler and his coterie. He also made a strong case for the superior sensitivity to beauty of the Congolese over the Europeans, pointing out the taste and skill with which everyday objects are made as contrasted with the ugliness and clumsiness of many Western objects we use daily without complaint. Boxes, cups, bowls, combs, powder horns, tobacco mortars, and musical instruments are made by and for individuals either for their own use or as gifts. African art was the first and is still the primary evidence of' the great worth of African cultures, and Olbrechts used it tellingly in this early Exposition and monograph to mitigate prejudice and colonial superciliousness. Another Olbrechts innovation was his recognition that "with them as with us, the true work of art bursts forth from a superior soul." He sadly documents the rapid decline of art skills and productivity with the advent of European penetration, chastizes the colonial authorities for not doing anything effective to stop it, and points out the destructive effect of European-oriented art teaching and the introduction of non-traditional styles, tools, and materials. The need for psychological and sociological data on the artists and their role in their societies before contact is noted, together with a few cases of known African ar- tists, the preponderance of male carvers and female modelers, and the tendency of artists to be physically han- dicapped and/or curers or magicians. Olbrechts expected to return to the Ivory Coast with his students to study the personality of Baule and Senufo sculptors, but to my knowledge no report of the research has ever appeared, although Maesen's later research is the source of the now- disputed term of "firespitter" for Senufo waniugo and kponiugo masks. Making no attempt to evaluate the influence of Western art on Congolese or vice versa, although such was done in the Exposition, Olbrechts equally eschews any prophecy on the future of Congolese art. But he does suggest the pos- sibility of developing cottage industries based on the ex- isting traditional arts as potentially more viable than revived or introduced crafts, and notes the relative success of some missionaries in adapting African designs to embroidery, church vestments, and Christian religious sub- jects. He scorns African copies of East Indian ornaments and Ancient Egyptian spoons, and even more the early pre- airport tourist carvings from Buta with their elephant caryatids and crocodiles standing on their tails supporting flower vases. He had the foresight to realize that "in due time, Africans themselves will take the initiative in adapting their ancient formulas to conceptions suitable to the new life." In the four decades since he wrote, Africa has become almost totally independent politically if not economically, 48</page><page sequence="7">the Belgian presence is long gone from the Congo, and many magnificent traditional art styles have indeed died. But a few have persisted, often in diminished or changed forms, and many new crafts, skills, materials, techniques, and forms have been created or successfully adapted both for the African and the foreign market. Whether anti- quarians like it or not, African art is alive and well, and even peoples who had no traditional arts before contact are developing them. All the arts are practiced, not only sculp- ture and dancing, but also easel and mural painting, poetry, theater, the novel, even opera. Olbrechts would ap- prove of this vitality, even if he would regret the passing of so much of the best in African tradition. A balanced assessment must admit that this monograph is slim, ponderous, and full of errors of all kinds, from questionable attributions to discredited migration theories to misinterpretations of his own data. Although his Stylistic Regions are so obvious as to be meaningless, his Styles turn out to be largely ethnic, a fact he seems not to have realized. The one supra-cultural style in Central Africa connected with mukanda initiation rites he seems to have overlooked, although it extends from the Kwango through Angola and Katanga into Zambia and Rhodesia (Zimbabwe). He consistently neglects masks because they do not fit his categories as neatly as do figures. Worst of all in a student of style, his prose is inexcusably prolix and pedantic, and he never loses an opportunity for an internal reference, a needless footnote, an elephantine compliment to another scholar, or a whole series of redundancies. The numbering systems of the figures, plates, and footnotes and their location in reference to the text and captions are models of obfuscation. Every statement is hedged, every evaluation is repeated at least twice in different words, but still he rarely manages to be clear, precise, or factual. For instance, he never makes a distinction between the three or four major styles within each of his five Stylistic Regions and the further subdivisions within them, but uses "sub- styles" for both levels. He apparently knew very little about the ethnography of the Congo, and that was second- hand, his field work having been in the Ivory Coast and among the North Carolina Cherokee. If nothing else, this book makes us realize how far we have come in the forty years since it was written and how much more we know about ethnography and its uses from the monographs of Maquet, Vansina, Biebuyck, Merriam, Wolfe, and Douglas, to name only a few who have published on the Congo in English, plus the many excellent reports in other languages since 1946. Olbrechts' contribu- tion is that he dared consider this vast and complex area as a unity, and worked out methods of studying its arts more adequately by analyzing the relationships between the myriad of ethnic styles. If his "Belgian method" were adopted and rigorously applied, most of the thousands of undocumented specimens of African art in world museums and private collections could be documented provisionally by a method that allows replication. His probing questions, stout defense of African cultures and artists, and irritating but nevertheless thought-provoking overgeneralizations are contributions whose value has never been realized. As Herskovits once remarked about Boas' Primitive Art, its impact on art historians was limited because none of them had ever been persuaded to read it from cover to cover. In effect, Olbrechts made a start toward the formulation of a comprehensive theory of African art, and developed a method to achieve it. He deserves more followers than he has had. o Ijo/Urhobo (?) 40" African Sculpture Unlimited 145 Spring Street (SoHo) New York City 10012 * (212) 925-0683 Basonge Fetish Figure Nails, Brass strip. 105 cm.
