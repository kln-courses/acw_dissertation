<plain_text><page sequence="1">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY collection in Mitla, Oaxaca, which are believed to have come from Santo Domingo near Etla, Oaxaca (Fig. 86, c). They have a single, rather carelessly drawn line of red paint on the interior of the rim. One of the sherds from the "comales with interior handles" in the Copan collection (Longyear 1952: 91) has a similar red line around the interior of the rim. If my theory is correct, the Copan specimens when properly reconstructed would resemble the type of ceremonial vessel known as rimhead vessels. These are closely related both in shape and function to the 3-pronged incense burner complex. The plain or effigy prongs of these vessels may also have supported deeply-scored covers, in which case the in- cised shallow bowls from Copan were probably used in connection with them rather than as comales or cook- ing utensils. Unfortuately there is no information on the date or period of the Oaxaca specimens but Late Classic rimhead vessels are common in Mesoamerica and their presence in plain or effigy-prong form at Copan would not be surprising (for their distribution see Borhegyi 1951c: 176; 1951a: 118). The anthropomorphic effigy incense burner illustrated by Longyear (Fig. 88, e) and believed to be of Full Classic date is similar in all respects to a type of incense burner characteristic of the Early Classic Esperanza phase of the Guatemalan highlands. These have been designated loop-nose incense burners because of the looplike protrusion on the upper half of the vessel wall (Borhegyi 1951b; 1951d Fig. 6). The Copan specimen, although from the Full Classic period, undoubtedly be- longs to this category of incense burner. From an analysis of the data presented above it might seem that Longyear's breakdown of the archaeological periods at Copan is open to some question. It may be that the Archaic period at Copan started unusually late but that possibility notwithstanding, the earlier part, at least, of his Full Classic should probably be equated with the later part of the Early Classic Esperanza phase of the Guatemalan highlands.

April, 1954 CHINESE FIGURINES IN MESOAMERICA In a recent article J. Alden Mason (1951) called at- tention to 2 small Chinese figurines found in local archaeological collections in Mesoamerica. One was from Azqueltan, Jalisco, Mexico and is now in the University Museum, Philadelphia (catalog number NA- 11808), and the other was in the Vitalino Robles collec- tion of Quezaltenango, Guatemala. Both are of a soft stone and were described as "crawling infants." While browsing through a collection of archaeological objects in an antique shop in Guatemala City I came across another small Chinese figurine similar in most respects to the ones described by Mason. The shop owner, unaware of the Oriental origin of this specimen, was sure that it must have come in with the other arti- facts from Kaminaljuyu, a large archaeological site on the outskirts of the city. The figurine has been presented to the University Museum (catalog number 54-4-1). Like the Quezaltenango specimen (Mason 1951 Fig. 1, a), the stone figurine from Guatemala City is an opaque yellowish-amber color with reddish veins and has a very soft, soapy texture (Mohr scale 2.8). It is made of agalmatolite, "the poor man's jade" in China. It also seems to represent a crawling infant. The head, which now is broken, is large and the limbs short and rudimentary. The wide nose, closed eyes, mouth, and ears are represented by light incisions. These, like the body features, are somewhat worn, probably from much handling. The arms and legs are stubby and the hands and feet are not shown but the female genitalia are distinctly marked (Fig. 87, a). The specimen has been perforated with a diameter of 3 mm., obliquely from front to back through the neck. This perforation gives the impression of recency and was undoubtedly made so that the figurine could be worn as a pendant (Fig. 87, b). The specimen from Guatemala City is slightly larger than the ones from Azqueltan and Quezaltenango, comparing with them as follows: Length Guatemala City .....................4.8 cm. Azqueltan .... ....................... 3.7 cm. Quezaltenango ...........................3.4 cm. Height 2.1 cm. 2.3 cm. 2.0 cm. Width 2.8 cm. 2.1 cm. 1.6 cm. 286 [ XX, 3, 1955</page><page sequence="2">FACTS AND COMMENTS It also differs from them in being perforated and in showing female rather than male genitals. (Dr. Mason interpreted the acute incised triangles on the specimen from Azqueltan as representative of male genital or- gans). According to Schuyler Camman, Associate Curator of the Oriental Section of the University Museum, similar "crawling infants" are common on the Ting-yao bowls and the Tz'u Chou vases, porcelain pillows, etc. which were made during the Sung dynasty (A.D. 960-1279), or even later during the Ming period (A.D. 1368-1644). He states that today these figurines are "considered merely as toys or as pocket trinkets to be touched or rubbed for the tactile pleasure which the Chinese so greatly appre- ciate. However, the fact that the male genitalia are often indicated and even emphasized, suggests that they were probably originally, at least, intended as fertility FIG. 87.

The context in which they are shown on the Sung porcelains, among many-seeded lotus pods, etc., suggests that in the Mediaeval period this motif was most certainly con- sidered as a 'symbol of fertility'" (Mason 1951: 273-4). In view of the fact that the specimen illustrated here from Guatemala City definitely shows female genitalia, I would question Mason's identification of the Azqueltan and Quezaltenango specimens as males. I re-examined the figurine in the Robles collection in Quezaltenango and, in my opinion, the triangular incision between the legs of the figurine is more indicative of the female than of the male sex. I would therefore suggest that, although they were probably used as symbols of fertility, they were not necessarily designed to insure the birth of "much-desired sons." In spite of the curious occurrence of these 3 speci- mens among archaeological collections in Mesoamerica, I would agree with Mason and Heizer that they were probably brought to the New World during Colonial times or later and are not necessarily indicative of pre- Columbian trans-Pacific contact. These figurines and the "soapstone vessels," like those from Bacalar (Yucatan), Isla de Sacrificios, and the Huaxteca (Heizer 1953; Cam- mann 1952), may very likely have been brought over on one of the Manila-Acapulco galleons for, as Cam- mann suggests (Mason 1951: 274), "Many Chinese fled China at the coming of the Manchus in 1664 and went down to Manila and other Philippine towns, later con- tinuing on to the New World to serve as artisans or servants." Although Chinese immigration to Mesoamerica has never been great, the Chinese colonies in Quezaltenango and Guatemala City have been quite sizable during the last 2 centuries. However, these people are most prob- ably descendants of much more recent immigrants than those who came to Acapulco in Colonial days. If the "crawling infant" figurines and the "soapstone vessels" have been brought to the New World by successive post-Columbian immigrations of Chinese, why then have they been reported only from Mexico, Guatemala, and British Honduras? Certainly other areas in this hemisphere have a Chinese population as great or even greater than these countries. The fact may be that, although similar ones do exist throughout North and South America, they have not been recognized as being Oriental in origin and have been put into collections of local archaeological material. If others are known it would be interesting to have their distribution and more data on them. It would also be worthwhile if more census data were available on Chinese immigration and settlement in Latin American countries so that we, as archaeologists, would know better where to expect to find objects of Chinese origin. 287</page><page sequence="3">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY CAMMANN, SCHUYLER V.

STEPHAN F. DE BORHEGYI University Museum University of Oklahoma Norman, Okla. January, 1954 ARCHAEOLOGY AND PROTEINS Increasingly, Americanist archaeologists are tackling problems relating not only to broad ecological adapta- tions of the peoples whose cultures they study but also to more specific considerations such as dietary patterns. The amount of light which archaeological data can shed is unknown, but the potential is increasingly probed for enlightening clues. Current ethnographic work in New Guinea prompts the following comments concerning 1) degree of exploitation of available protein sources; and 2) social restrictions influencing protein intake. Sources of concentrated protein available to the Aga- rabi are not large. However, they are exploited to such an extent that the diet is not as deficient in protein foods as a superficial view would suggest. Pigs, although highly valued, are not plentiful nor are they eaten in large quantities. Wild fowl and small mammals, again not abundant, are eagerly hunted and consumed. Finally, a wide variety of worms and insects are caught and eaten. Consumption of the latter is hard to check even ethnographically for it is so much a random matter. It is nonetheless common and, for example, a woman finding one cutworm in her garden during a day's work will take it home at night for the evening meal. All in all, with this intensive exploitation of available sources, the protein diet is richer than would be apparent from a count of pig bones found at an Agarabi village site. Secondly, there is more than chance individual vari- ation in protein intake. Bush rats, one of the more common small mammals, are hunted by individuals of both sexes and of various ages. Rat hunting is a favorite sport of young boys, and although they catch fairly large numbers of them, social regulations prevent them from eating their quarry. We could not assume, therefore, that an approximation of protein intake based on a count of animal bones at a site, divided by the esti- mated total population, would be valid. Admittedly, such data as the foregoing are not readily available to the archaeologist. Early travel accounts might give some clues for certain periods, although these aspects of primitive life often did not catch the atten- tion of the casual observer. Biological specialists might aid in determining the protein potential for different periods of the past in given areas. Further, a perusal of ethnographic literature might be rewarding in providing some indications of the relationship between availability of protein foods and the degree to which they are ex- ploited by primitive peoples with varying ecological adaptations. In any case, although these factors may remain ar- chaeological imponderables, we should not dismiss nor ignore them in our attempts to learn of past dietary practices.
