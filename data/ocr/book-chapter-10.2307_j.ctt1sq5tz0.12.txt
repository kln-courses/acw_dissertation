<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> 9. Active Role of Behaviour The ability of animals to respond differentially to one of several options  is an important part of adaptive behaviour. In colloquial terms they  make a choice. Charles Darwin suggested that members of one sex  choose to mate with individuals with a striking feature such as the  tail of the male peacock. Choice can take many different forms. One is  involved in predators’ choice of prey. When gazelle see a predator like  a cheetah they jump into the air, a behaviour pattern called ‘stotting’.  Cheetah seem to learn not to chase jumping gazelle.1 A similar case is  the small falcon, the merlin, which takes other small birds on the wing.2  When it hunts flying skylarks, its potential prey start singing. The more  the skylark sings, the more likely is the merlin to abandon the chase  and hunt for other skylarks that don’t sing so much. The merlin has  probably learned that the skylark singing a lot is more vigorous and  more difficult to catch and chooses to attack other individuals. Apparent design emerges, even when it is at the end of the long  and complicated process of development. Development depends on  the constancy of many genetic and environmental conditions. If any of  these conditions changes, as can happen to environmental conditions  when organisms move away from the natal area, the characteristics of  the organism can also change. High mobility by organisms would have  1  Fitzgibbon, C.D. &amp; Fanshawe, J.H. (1988), Stotting in Thomson’s gazelles: an  honest signal of condition. Behav. Ecol.

By their mobility, in the  case of animals, or facility to disperse their seeds in the case of plants,  organisms would have exposed themselves to new conditions that  might reveal heritable variability.  The environment does not simply set a problem to which the organism  has to find a solution. The organism can do a great deal to select or  create an environment to which it is best suited. For example beavers  dam rivers, flood valleys and create private lakes for themselves. The  concepts derived from such examples have been developed extensively  and they are now referred to collectively as ‘niche construction’.3 The  effects of behavioural control can be especially great when a major  component of the environmental conditions with which animals have  to cope is provided by their social environment. When individuals  compete with each other within a social group, the outcome of the  competition depends in part on each individual’s capacity to predict  what the other will do.

Active Role of Behaviour  93 Play behaviour, prominent in young mammals and some birds, is  spontaneous and rewarding to the individual; it is intrinsically motivated  and its performance serves as a goal in itself. The player is to some  extent protected from the normal consequences of serious behaviour.  The behaviour appears to have no immediate practical goal or benefit.  Playing with other individuals may be preceded or accompanied by  specific signals or facial expressions indicating that the behaviour is  not to be taken as a threat. Play is the antithesis of ‘work’ or ‘serious’  behaviour. The behaviour consists of actions and, in the case of humans,  thoughts, expressed in novel combinations. When playing with others,  a normally dominant individual may become temporarily subordinate.  Individual actions or thoughts are performed repeatedly; they may  also be incomplete or exaggerated relative to non-playful behaviour in  adults; play looks different. Play is sensitive to prevailing conditions  and occurs only when the player is free from illness or stress. Play is  an indicator of well-being. Playful play is accompanied by a particular  positive mood state in which the individual is more inclined to behave  in a spontaneous and flexible way.4  When young animals playfully practise the stereotyped movements  they will use in earnest later in life, they are likely to improve the  coordination and effectiveness of these behaviour patterns. The short  dashes and jumps of a young gazelle when it is playing bring benefits  that may be almost immediate, as it faces the threat of predation from  4  A full discussion of play is given in Bateson, P. &amp; Martin, P. (2013), Play, Playfulness,  Creativity and Innovation. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. ‘Playfulness’ is  a positive mood state that facilitates and accompanies ‘playful play’, a subset of  broadly defined play. A distinction is drawn between playful play and non-playful  play. Playfulness, the defining feature of playful play, is a positive mood state that  is not always detectable in observable behaviour. The behaviour of a playful human  is captured by numerous synonyms, including cheerful, frisky, frolicsome, good- natured, joyous, merry, rollicking, spirited, sprightly and vivacious. Some of these  terms relate to human emotions that could not be readily identified in animals  without much anthropomorphic projection. Some, though, are descriptive of  visible behaviour and can be defined ostensively, such as when two kittens engage  vigorously in social play. In animals, as in humans, playfulness may be inferred  from the context in which it occurs. What the animals do may vary — from playing  with objects at one moment to playing with another individual at the next — but the  playful state underlying their behaviour is the same. </page> <page sequence="4"> 94 Behaviour, Development and Evolution cheetah or other carnivores and needs considerable skill when escaping.5  Even though the benefits may be immediate in such cases, they may  also persist into adult life. Many theories of the functions of play have continued to focus on  its role in enabling the developing individual to acquire and practise  complex physical skills and, by so doing, fine tune neuromuscular  systems. Others theories, derived  from observing how much young  animals play with each other, have  emphasised how individuals also  develop social skills and cement  their social relationships; play  may also serve to improve the  individual’s capacity to compete  and cooperate with other members  of their own species. Play can make  an individual more resistant to  stress, and enlarge its repertoire.  Dog soliciting play with a bow.

Play may enhance its  ability to cooperate with others and to co-exist with older members of  its own species. Play may increase its knowledge of its home range. Play,  or at least some components of it, allows young animals to simulate, in  a relatively safe context, potentially dangerous situations that will arise  in their adult life. They learn from their mistakes, but do so in relative  safety. On this view, play exerts its most important developmental  effects on risky adult behaviour such as fighting, mating in the face of  serious competition, catching dangerous prey, and avoiding becoming  someone else’s prey. Indeed, the behaviour patterns of fighting and  prey-catching are especially obvious in the play of cats and other  predators, whereas safe activities such as grooming, defecating and  urinating have no playful counterparts. 5  Gomendio, M.

Active Role of Behaviour  95 When differences between the sexes arise in play, as they often do,  these are reflected in differences between the sexes in the activities  of adults. For instance young female chimpanzees seem to behave  maternally towards sticks,  doing so much more than  males and ceasing to do  so when they have real  offspring to care for.6  One study showed that  stick-carrying consisted  of holding or cradling  detached sticks pieces of  bark, small logs or woody  vine with their hand or  mouth, underarm or, Siberian tiger mum and daughter play-fighting.

Individuals sometimes carried sticks for periods of up to four  hours or more during which they rested, walked, climbed, slept and  fed as usual. The occurrence of stick-carrying peaked among juveniles  and was higher in females than males. This sex difference could not  be explained by a general propensity for females to play with objects  more than males, because several types of object such as weapons were  played with more by males. Males in many species, including humans,  perform more rough and tumble play than females and engage in more  violent activities when adult. Play has features that are likely to make it suitable for finding the best  way forward in a world of conflicting demands. In acquiring cognitive  skills, individuals are in danger of finding sub-optimal solutions to  the many problems that confront them. In deliberately moving away  from what might look like the final end state, each individual may  arrive somewhere that is better. Play may therefore fulfil an important  probing role that enables the individual to escape from false end-points  or ‘local optima’. An analogy is a mountain surrounded by lesser peaks.  6  Kahlenberg, S.M. &amp; Wrangham, R.W. (2010), Sex differences in chimpanzees’  use of sticks as play objects resemble those of children.

When the metaphorical  climber is on a lower peak, active ways of getting off it can be highly  beneficial. In practice what this could mean that the activities involved  in play discover possibilities that are better than those obtained without  play.  All short-term quantitative studies of play in animals find that some  individuals play more than others. In humans, five main dimensions  have been used to describe the variation in personalities. Many of  these are not usually regarded as attributes of cognitive ability, but the  dimension ‘Openness to Experience’ is one that could have developed  as the result of play. The descriptions of people on one dimension  range from Creativity to Analytical Ability. In a survey of humans, the  individuals who believed that they were playful also believed that they  were creative.7 Respondents were asked to offer ideas for the uses of  two items, a jam jar and a paperclip. In the literature on creativity, those  individuals who produce few answers are referred to as ‘convergers’  and those who produce many suggestions are known as ‘divergers’.  The typical sole response from a converger when asked for uses for a  paper clip was ‘Clip paper together’. The response from one diverger in  the survey was: ‘Clip papers, unfold to clean fingernails, general clothes  fixing in an emergency, put on a magnet for a science experiment for  children, make a mobile with lots of them, make a sculpture with one  or more of them, earrings, pick a lock’. If there had no been a cut-off  after ten answers, this person would probably have gone on. Most of the  respondents provided a relatively small number of uses for the objects  and only a few offered many uses. The respondents who regarded  themselves as playful and producers of new ideas were much more  likely to give lots of uses. The differences between individuals might reflect the variation in  almost every character of body and behaviour. It might instead (or  in addition) reflect the benefits of being different from others. In a  population that consists mostly of females it is advantageous to be a  male — and vice versa. In cooperative species, providing a particular set  of skills may complement a different set possessed by others. In humans  7  Bateson, P. &amp; Nettle, D. (2014), Playfulness, ideas, and creativity: a survey. Creativity  Research J. 26.2, 219–222, https://doi.org/10.1080/10400419.2014.901091  </page> <page sequence="7"> 9. Active Role of Behaviour  97 those who suggest new ways of looking at the world are complemented  by others who put such ideas to good use. Creativity and innovation are  mutually beneficial but not necessarily found in the same person.8 Environmental change The environment does not cease to be important even if it normally  remains constant. Change the environment and the outcome of an  individual’s development may be utterly different. Indeed, if an  individual does not inherit its parents’ environment along with their  genes and other transmittable factors, it may not be well adapted to the  conditions in which it now finds itself. Its behaviour may enable it to  cope.  A rule for learning, or for any other kind of developmental process,  is not simply a gene written large. A straightforward correspondence  between a gene and a rule for changing behaviour is no more likely  than a straightforward relationship between gene and behaviour (see  Chapter 8). The same point applies with equal force to all the other  epigenetic rules that bring order to development. Presumably, if the  rules have any universality in natural conditions, the experience that  affects them must be a common feature of all the animals having those  rules. Alternatively, they must be well buffered against change by the  particular conditions in which an individual finds itself.  When behaviour changes in response to alterations in the  environment, it seems likely that the specific ways in which animals  tune their behaviour to local conditions are themselves the products of  Darwinian evolution. If rules for learning fit the animal’s information- gathering equipment to particular problems and which may have been  subject to Darwinian evolution, then the conditions necessary for their  development must pass in some way from one generation to the next.  While the mode of transmission may commonly involve genes, the rules  for modifying behaviour are hardly likely to spring fully armed out of  the genome. Criticism of the assertion that genes code for behaviour  that is not learned applies just as forcibly to the rules that are involved  8  The distinction between creativity and innovation is emphasised in Bateson, P. &amp;  Martin, P. (2013), Play, Playfulness, Creativity and Innovation. </page> <page sequence="8"> 98 Behaviour, Development and Evolution in the development of behaviour. Such rules represent the workings of  an already functional nervous system and body. They themselves have  to develop and depend on structures that require for their development  a complex interplay between the products of many genes and many  conditions external to the genome.  Many features of the inferred rules for learning seem to be profoundly  modified by experience. For instance, whether or not initially neutral  cues are treated as potentially relevant or ignored is greatly affected by  the animal’s prior history. Such selectivity in responsiveness to external  conditions can be of great use to the animal. In many experiments on  associative learning monkeys are rewarded with food. The machines  that dispense the food are commonly designed to drop peanuts into a  cup when the monkey is to be rewarded. Many monkeys do not like  the peanuts at first. They have to be deprived of their regular food  and accustomed to the peanuts for weeks before they will take them  with any readiness, let alone treat the nuts as rewards for appropriate  behaviour. In such cases, which are not exceptional, experience expands  the range of what the monkeys regard as acceptable food. It might be argued that a spontaneously expressed rule could still  be detected at work behind the scenes, since the general category of  food, and its effectiveness as a reward, was in some sense built in. In  other cases, though, it becomes more difficult to pinpoint what might or  might not act as a reward without extensive knowledge of the animal’s  previous experience. For instance, the condition in which it becomes  possible for an animal to perform an act that would bring it food  becomes rewarding in itself. So the animal will work in order to provide  itself with those conditions. In this way, lengthy chains of behaviour can  be developed with one event providing the terminating condition for  one action and the enabling condition for the next. This is the basis for  many complex circus acts performed by animals. An adaptation of an animal’s behaviour to the environment in which  it lives gives the appearance of good design. The adaptations are often  the result of Darwinian evolution, but the adaptability of organisms will  mean that the adaptations may have developed during the lifetime of the  individual. An individual whose body has been damaged in an accident  or who is burdened with a mutation that renders its body radically  different from other individuals may be able to accommodate to such  </page> <page sequence="9"> 9. Active Role of Behaviour  99 abnormality. In doing so, the individual may develop novel structures  and behaviour not seen in other individuals of the same species. Such  accommodation can be particularly marked when it occurs early in  development. A goat born without forelimbs walked about on its hind  legs and developed a peculiar musculature and skeleton. A modern  instance is a bipedal domestic dog.9 The animals have coped with an  abnormality by accommodating to it, producing coordinated changes  in functionally related characters. Similarly, humans born with limb  abnormalities as a result of exposure to a teratogen such as thalidomide  develop strategies to cope, for example, by handling objects using their  feet or teeth in ways for which others might use their hands. The capacity of the individual to respond to neural damage is  remarkable, particularly when the damage occurs early in life. In such  cases described in humans, the brain reorganises and morphologically  can look markedly different from the brain of a normal individual. Even  so, the effects on behaviour may be scarcely detectable and the plasticity  at the neural level may be accompanied by robust development at the  behavioural level. Another form of ‘coping’, found especially during early development,  arises when the organism must make immediate responses to survive  a challenge but, in contrast to accommodation responses, the normal  developmental sequence is not necessarily disrupted. Although these  responses may involve either structural or temporal changes in the  course of development, they do not entail a fundamental change in the  normal pattern of development. Thus, the phenotypic consequences are  not as marked as those that involve accommodation, but they may have  a costs and become disadvantageous to the individual later in life. Conclusions Individuals differ for a variety of reasons, some genetic and some  stochastic. Undoubtedly their plasticity, which comes in many forms,  also contributes greatly to the variation commonly found in most  populations. The processes involved in plasticity can operate at many  9  The remarkable ability of Faith, the two-legged dog, can be viewed on YouTube  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QKG3CKZTYU </page> <page sequence="10"> 100 Behaviour, Development and Evolution different levels, ranging from the molecular to the behavioural, some  involving adaptability to what may be novel challenges and some  responding conditionally to local circumstances. Differences between  individuals can be triggered in a variety of ways, some mediated  through the parent’s characteristics. Sometimes phenotypic variation  arises because the environment triggers a developmental response that  is appropriate to those ecological conditions. Sometimes the organism  ‘makes the best of a bad job’ in suboptimal conditions. Sometimes  the buffering processes of development may not cope with what has  been thrown at the organism, and a bizarre phenotype is generated.  Whatever the appearance of a well-designed organism’s characteristics,  the various forms of plasticity illustrate why individuals of the same  species can differ so much. </page> </plain_text>
