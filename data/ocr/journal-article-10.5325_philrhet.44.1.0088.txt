<plain_text> <page sequence="1">  Creaturely Rhetorics   Diane Davis   In a 1917 essay entitled “A Diffi  culty in the Path of Psychoanalysis,” Freud  suggests that modern science has dealt three devastating blows to human  pride: the Copernican revelation that the earth revolves around the sun,  decentering man’s presumed cosmological place in the universe as “lord of  the world”; the Darwinian revelation that man shares a common  ancestor  with apes, which indicates that he is not inherently “a being diff erent from  animals or superior to them”; and the Freudian revelation that c onsciousness  is mostly ruled by the unconscious, which indicates that the ego is not   master of “its own house” (1957–74, 139–41). Of these narcissistic wounds,  each still gaping today, the second most interests us here, specifi cally inas- much as its panicked defl ection continues to ground contemporary theories  of rhetoric.   It’s true that the myth of the knowing and speaking subject who under- stands the world and communicates that understanding with eloquence  and grace has been massively and probably permanently interrupted by,  among other things, the fi rst and third of these revelations. However, even  the most sophisticated posthumanist theories of symbolic exchange, those  fully embracing the Copernican and Freudian revelations, tend (explicitly or  implicitly, consciously or unconsciously) to refuse the Darwinian  revelation,  along with its philosophical and—more to the point for us—rhetorical  implications. Heidegger, Lacan, and Levinas, for e xample, each articulate  a strictly human(ist) description of the language relation, presuming that  the gulf that separates “the human” from “the animal” is uncrossable, h aving  something to do with the former’s capacity for language and the latter’s  captivation by its environment, or by the imaginary, or by “its own being,”  respectively. 1   And rhetorical studies on the whole agrees: rhetoric, at the  very least, requires an engagement with the symbolic. Th is engagement,  while it defi nes the human (“the symbol-using animal”), is what nonhuman  animals purportedly lack.

Kennedy, of course, famously disagrees. In “A Hoot in the  Dark,” a seminal essay that should also have been pathbreaking, and the  follow-up book C omparative Rhetoric , Kennedy reframes the argument,  suggesting that rhetoric, “in its essence,” is not a specifi cally human art or  science but “a form of mental and emotional energy” that is “biologically  prior to speech and to conscious intentionality” (1998, 3–4, 26). Th is rhetori- cal energy expresses itself in emotional reactions (fear, anger, lust, etc.), and  its most probable source is “the instinct for self-preservation,” Kennedy sur- mises, “which in turn derives from nature’s impulse to preserve the genetic  line” (1998, 3–4). Citing Darwin and other evolutionary biologists, he argues  that this universal form of rhetoric is the condition both for various forms of  animal communication (via gesture, facial expression, song, and so on) and  for the development of a more complex and sophisticated human rhetoric.  “In fact,” Kennedy writes, “rhetoric is manifest in all a nimal life and existed  long before the evolution of human beings” (1992, 4). So according to him,  animals and humans “share a ‘deep’ natural rhetoric”—“deep” meaning that  we share it at the level of DNA (1998, 13). Rhetoric, from this evolutionary  perspective, “is a natural phenomenon: the potential for it exists in all life  forms that can give signals” (4); indeed, it “has to exist in the speaker before  speech can take place” (1992, 4). What Kennedy gleans from the sociobio- logical frame, in other words, is that rhetoric has a “natural” dimension to  which rhetorical studies has not attended, a dimension that he insists is  vividly exposed in evolutionary biology.   I applaud Kenney’s embrace of what I’ve been calling the Darwinian  revelation and wholeheartedly agree that rhetoric, at its most elemental,  takes place at the level of the creature. However, it is no more productive  to dismiss philosophical revelations than it is to dismiss scientifi c ones. Th e  appeal to nature or to a “natural rhetoric,” no matter how species-leveling  it may at fi rst seem, remains a recuperative, defl ective move that protects a  fairly standard anthropocentric approach to rhetorical theory. I would like  to argue instead that the “mental and emotional energy” that Kennedy calls  “rhetoric” is itself dependent on an always prior rhetoricity, an aff ectab ility  or persuada bility that is due not to any creature’s specifi c genetic makeup but  to corporality more generally, to the  exposedness of corporeal existence. To  be aff ectable, persuadable, is to be always already aff ected, persuaded, which  means: always already r esponsive.  Rhetoric is not fi rst of all an essence or  property “i n the speaker” (a natural function of biology) but an u nderivable  obligation to respond that issues from an irreducible relationality.  89 PR 44.1_07.indd   89 1/22/11   12:42 PM </page> <page sequence="3"> diane davis  Both good science and philosophy after Heidegger would have to  admit that “the body” is not a discrete phenomenological entity. It’s unclear  where it begins and ends, which means that it cannot become a mere object  of knowledge. Th e human genome project notwithstanding, where body  starts, knowledge desists; that is to say, body is where “knowing” encounters  its abysses. Your material incarnation is the site of a passivity more ancient  than the active/passive dichotomy. It’s the condition for your exposure, sus- ceptibility, vulnerability, and therefore for your  responsivity . Responsibility  (response-ability) begins not with a subject who recognizes itself but with  “proximity,” in Levinas’s terminology, immediate (as in nonmediated) con- tact and responsivity at the level of “a materiality more material than all  matter” (1998, 108).   Body is reducible neither to a biological entity nor to a container for  the “self ”—it is the site of proximity, where “you” are “reached or touched  without the mediation of the logos,” Levinas writes (1998, 121). Th ere is no  representational power that could catch up to this immediate “touch,” this  primordial persuasive appeal that both gives you to be—there is no y ou  prior to this “address”—and exposes in you “an unconditional Y es ... a Y es  older than naïve spontaneity” (1996, 93). In the beginning, your beginning,  each time, was the r esponse —prior to consciousness, desire, and will. Which  is to say: in the beginning was rhetoric, neither as genetic attribute nor as  art or science but as an underivable provocation, an imperative to respond.   Animals, human and nonhuman, are corporeal creatures, exposed— open to the other’s aff ection/alteration—and so obey this “rhetorical impera- tive,” as I have called it elsewhere. 2   However, according to H eidegger,  Lacan, and Levinas, for example, nonhuman animals merely  live this   obligation in an automatic way; they’re exposed, yes, but they cannot  experience their exposedness because they’re trapped at the level of  instinct,  preprogrammed to behave/react without refl ection or a capacity  for representation. Because animals are corporeal, they’re vulnerable, open  to wounding and outrage as well as to various forms of aff ective conta- gion—panic fear, for example. Due to their fundamental rhetoricity, they  experience the “emotional energy” Kennedy describes. However, accord- ing to these philosophers, while human Daseins exist, comporting them- selves (in Heidegger’s language) toward others and their environment in a  conscious and world-forming way, nonhuman animals merely live, play- ing out nature’s program. Th ey have no real relationships, as one would  have to have language to have world, and one would have to have world  to have  Mit-sein . Because they have no sense of themselves—the animal  90 PR 44.1_07.indd   90 1/22/11   12:42 PM </page> <page sequence="4"> addressing animals “in its brutish dumbness, is not yet in touch with itself,” Levinas writes  (1987, 55)—because they cannot dis-identify or extract themselves from this  aff ective identifi cation, this captivation, so the argument goes, they have no  capacity to respond a uthentically . Animals react, to put it bluntly, but they  do not respond. Th e fundamental presumption grounding this “insight”  is of course that the human  is capable of genuine responsiveness, even if  the Copernican and Freudian revelations indicate that nothing could be  less certain.   “Animals communicate by a complex code of signs,” as Kennedy  notes (1992, 6), but rhetorical studies has for the most part joined Western   philosophy from Plato to Levinas in presuming that these signs are limited  to a fi xed program and therefore foreign to what we properly call language.  Indeed, Lacan proposes that we understand the “full value” of the diversity of  human language only up against the discovery of its opposite: the rigid fi xity  of animal coding (1977, 84–85). At the very least, language requires the power  to make reference to oneself in autodeictic terms, to say “here I am” or “this  is I,” and animals are allegedly incapable of such self-reference. In Th  e Animal  Th at Th erefore I Am , Derrida notes that all human languages have this “I” at  their disposal, an “I” that is putatively in t hinking before being in language. So  without this self-referential “I,” without a representable sense of self, animals  are not only without language, but also without thinking, understanding,  reason, response (and so responsibility) (2008, 94). Which leaves rhetorical  studies free to continue ignoring animals— ignoring  all of them, since it is  this lack of language that defi nes what is called “the animal”  in general.  “Th e  animal,” a collective noun that parallels (and operates as the condition for)  “the human,” functions as a conceptual frame that presumes to encompass  every living nonhuman thing, from a blind protozoan to a great ape.   Now, it would be too easy simply to off er the counterargument that  there  are certain animals who demonstrate self-awareness. Th is is some- thing Heidegger skipped over in his critique of Darwin, who is vindicated  by recent studies in primatology and ethology that confi rm mirror self- recognition (MSR) not only in great apes but also in dolphins, elephants,  and magpies. 3   MSR has long been used to test self-awareness in human  children: researchers place a mark on the child’s face, and if the child spon- taneously uses the mirror to touch this otherwise imperceptible mark, she  is considered self-aware. But these nonhuman creatures passed the test,  too—as if such scientifi c evidence were necessary to confi rm that certain  animals represent themselves to themselves and others.  4  Indeed, Derrida,  as usual, pushes much further: “Who can deny,” he asks, “that phenomena  91 PR 44.1_07.indd   91 1/22/11   12:42 PM </page> <page sequence="5"> diane davis of narcissistic exhibition in seduction or sexual combat, the ‘follow me  who is (following) you’ deployed in colors, music, adornments, parades,  or e rections of all sorts derive from such an auto-deixis?” (2008, 95). Any   creature c apable of even minimal self-reference is already  in language,  already responding; that is to say, it is both defi ned by its irreducible rheto- ricity and, more importantly for our purposes, already p racticing rhetoric.    But again, it’s not just a matter of acknowledging that certain nonhu- man creatures display capacities that rhetoricians, along with philosophers  and scientists, tend to insist are specifi cally human. It’s at least as important  for rhetorical studies to ask whether it’s certain that  humans display these  capacities—or at least if we display them in all the purity that c ontemporary  theories of rhetoric presume. It’s precisely the  refusal to probe the suppos- edly indivisible line between response and reaction, between “the human”  and “the animal,” Derrida writes, that betrays “repressed human possibili- ties,” possibilities that include the development “of other powers of reason,  of a more comprehensive logic of argument, of a more demanding respon- sibility concerning the power of questioning and response” (2008, 105).  On the other hand, recent work in the diverse fi eld of animal  studies  could off er rhetorical studies another chance to embrace the far- reaching   philosophico-rhetorical implications of the Darwinian revelation: to reopen  the question of the language relation, to reconsider not only what it involves  but who or what engages in it.   Department of Rhetoric and Writing/Department of English  University of Texas-Austin notes   1. Quick sampling: “A dog does not exist,” Heidegger writes in Th  e Fundamental  C oncepts of Metaphysics , “but merely lives” (1995, 210). Animals do not have language (the  “as” structure) and so do not have “world”; they cannot therefore be said properly to “exist”  or to “die,” according to Heidegger. In “Th e Function and Field of Speech and Language  in Psychoanalysis,” Lacan situates human language “in sharp contrast to the fi xity of the  coding used by bees”—bees functioning here as a synecdoche for “the animal” in general  (1977, 84–85). Levinas’s misuse of Darwin is front and center in “Th e Paradox of Morality”:  “What I want to emphasize is that the human breaks with pure being, which is always a  persistence in being. Th is is my principal thesis. A being is something that is attached to  being, to its own being. Th at is Darwin’s idea. Th e being of animals is a struggle for life.  92 PR 44.1_07.indd   92 1/22/11   12:42 PM </page> <page sequence="6"> addressing animals A struggle for life without ethics. It is a question of might. ... However, with the appearance  of the human—and this is my entire philosophy—there is something more important than  my life, and that is the life of the other” (1988, 172). And so on.   2.

I understand that I’m leaving myself open to the charge of anthropomorphism  here, the ur-charge in scientifi c arenas. But what’s at stake in insisting that descriptions of   animal behavior be restricted to the machinic language of stimulus-response is precisely  the prior conviction that human beings are, as Freud put it, “diff erent from animals or  superior to them.” World renowned Dutch primatologist and ethologist Frans de Waal  reminds us that “while it is true that animals are not humans, it is equally true that humans  are animals.”   Resistance to this simple yet undeniable truth is what underlies the resistance  to anthropomorphism. I have characterized this resistance as a nthropodenial,   the  a priori rejection of shared characteristics between humans and animals.   Anthropodenial denotes willful blindness to the human-like characteristics of  animals or the animal-like characteristics of ourselves. It refl ects a  pre- Darwinian  antipathy to the profound similarities between human and animal behavior  (e.g., maternal care, sexual behavior, power seeking) noticed by everyone with  an open mind. (2006, 65)   Indeed, in an interview with Douglas Cruickshank, Robert Sapolsky, author of A   Primate’s  Memoir and professor of biological sciences,  neurology, and neurological sciences at   Stanford University, suggests that “part of the c hallenge in understanding the behavior of  a species is that they look like us for a reason. Th at’s not projecting human values. Th at’s  primatizing the generalities that we share with them” (Cruickshank 2001). It is of course  every bit as necessary to guard against the careless projection of human values onto nonhu- man animals as it is to guard against the projection of my own values onto other human  beings. However, what the still devastating charge of anthropomorphism ends up accom- plishing in the realms of, say, biology, psychology, ethology, and primatology—as well as  philosophy—is the foreclosure of any thinking through of the so-called animal question  at all; that is, any thinking through of it that does not begin with the presumption of an  uncrossable  gap between “the human” and “the animal.”   works cited   Cruickshank, Douglas. “Robert Sapolsky.” Interview.
