<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Complementarity and Coalescence:   Dante and the Sociology of Authentic Being S’io era corpo, e qui non si concepe com’ una dimensione altro patio, ch’esser convien se corpo in corpo repe,  accender ne dovria più il disio di veder quella essenza in che si vede come nostra natura e Dio s’unio. (Par. II.37-42)1 1.  Introduction: the social dimension of the Inferno and a moment of misgiving.  2. The  New Testament perspective: Pauline and Johannine collectivity.  3. The sociology of  estrangement: self-denial and social denial.  4. The sociology of emergence: co-presence,  co-immanence and the revised dimensionality of being. Kenelm Foster, not far into his preliminary meditation on the theology of  the Inferno, has this to say about its social aspect, its sense of sin as civic: In fact, there is generally a very human quality about the Inferno, not  unconnected, I think, with the strong social and political emphasis  that has often been remarked in it. Most of the damned have violated  human nature in some way, in themselves or in their fellow men;  and the deeper damnations are reserved for the sinners against their  fellows. In the circles of ‘frode’ – if one excepts Satan himself – all the  sins punished are sins against one’s neighbour. I fancy that Ezra Pound  said somewhere that the damned in the lower circles of Inferno were  all ‘damned for money’. This, if he said it, was an exaggeration, but  certainly the lower circles of Malebolge and Cocito are malevolently  anti-social, although this aspect is not everywhere stressed by the poet,  and in one case – Canto XIX – the society in question is ‘supernatural’  1 If I was body (and here we conceive not how one bulk could brook another, which  must be if body enters body), the more should longing enkindle us to see that essence  wherein we behold how our nature and God united themselves.  I am grateful to the  President and staff of the John Cabot American University in Rome where, by their kind  invitation, this paper was first delivered. </page> <page sequence="2"> 140 Conversations with Kenelm – the Church. The phrase Charles Williams applied to Geryon, the  symbol of Deceit, might indeed be applied to all that lower Hell into  which Geryon carried Dante (canto XVII): it is ‘the City infernalized’.2 This, as far as it goes, is unexceptionable, many and possibly most  of the sins punished in hell having about them the nature of injury, of  doing down the next man. But for all that, there is a sense in the Inferno  in which every dysfunctionality on the surface of things, including every  specifically social dysfunctionality, is reducible to dysfunctionality in  the depths, to the kind of dysfunctionality whereby, having established  himself at the centre of his own universe, the individual cannot but live  in a state of resentment with regard to the next man, with regard, that  is to say, to all those who have similarly established themselves at the  centre of their universe. Strictly speaking, therefore, the social emphases  of the Inferno, prominent as they are in the text and decisive for its overall  interpretation, stand to be referred to something both prior and more  profound than themselves, to the tragic substance of self as divided in the  forum of conscience. Short of this, of a referral of dividedness in the open  forum to dividedness in the innermost reaches of personality, the root  cause of every instance of antagonism on the surface remains hidden from  view, obscured by its mere phenomenology or showing forth. That said,  however, there is no denying the social character of Dante’s discourse  in the Inferno and thus the possibility of seeing and setting this up as an  object of enquiry in its own right, especially in that it is here, at the point  of being under the aspect of collectivity, that we discover some of his most  radiant emphases in the area of moral philosophy and theology. 2. In proposing the social aspect of the Commedia as an object of enquiry in  its own right, we need for a moment to look back to the New Testament as a  point of departure; for the New Testament, if not systematically then even so  unmistakably, commends two kinds of collectivity or social configuration,  the one Pauline and the other Johannine in origin. On the one hand, then,  there is Paul’s sense of the common life as a matter of complementarity, each  individual facilitating that life by bringing to it what he or she does best,  the substance of his or her genius or vocation; so, for example, as a classic  instance of his anthropomorphism, of his sense  of the indispensability of  each member of the body of Christ to the proper operation of the whole,  these lines from I Corinthians 12, an essay in functionality as a matter of  co-functionality, in collectivity as a matter of cooperation: 2 Kenelm Foster, O.P., God’s Tree. Essays on Dante and Other Matters (London: Blackfriars,  1957), pp. 54-55. </page> <page sequence="3"> Complementarity and Coalescence 141 Vos autem estis corpus Christi et membra de membro, et quosdam  quidem posuit Deus in ecclesia primum apostolos, secundo  prophetas, tertio doctores, deinde virtutes exin gratias curationum,  opitulationes, gubernationes, genera linguarum. Numquid omnes  apostoli, numquid omnes prophetae, numquid omnes doctores,  numquid omnes virtutes, numquid omnes gratiam habent curationum,  numquid omnes linguis loquuntur, numquid omnes interpretantur? (I Cor. 12:27-30)3 Uppermost in Paul’s mind as he considers the nature and the  mechanism of the common life are two things: first, the importance of  the individual’s seeking and living out his or her proper calling, as but  part of the body of Christ; and, following on from this, the possibility of  defining the relationship between one man and another in terms of the  kind of proximity whereby the one is present to the other as an extrinsic  principle of his well-being. Self, in other words, comes alongside and  engages with the other-than-self as part of what it means to be in Christ,  a notion which, though less than adequate to all this might mean for  Paul, nonetheless gives satisfactory expression to one aspect of it, to how  Christian neighbourliness might be usefully understood. But there is in the New Testament a further model of the collective life,  one which, while both acknowledging the Pauline model, deepens it in  favour of something closer to coalescence than to contiguity as a way of  developing this issue, to a sense of collectivity as involving the occupation  by the many of one and the same spiritual space. Each individual, in other  words, is present to his or her neighbour, not only nor even primarily as a  fellow labourer, but as an inward and abiding presence, as a principle of  being operative from out of the recesses of being. Fundamental here are  the farewell discourses of Christ prior to his passion as recorded in the  fourth gospel, discourses designed by way of a series of immanences to  confirm in circumstances of faith the co-inherence both of man and God  and of man and man as party to a common undertaking. First, then, and  as quickened by a sense of imminent catastrophe, there is Christ’s sense  of his being in the Father, of the Father’s being in him, and of this as the  3 Now you are Christ’s body, and each of you a limb or organ of it. Within our  community God has appointed, in the first place apostles, and in the second place  prophets, thirdly teachers; then miracle workers, then those who have gifts of healing, or  ability to help others or power to guide them, or the gift of ecstatic utterance of various  kinds. Are all apostles? all prophets? all teachers? Do all work miracles? Have all gifts  of healing? Do all speak in tongues of ecstasy? Can all interpret them? (REB). Eph.  4:11-12: ‘Et ipse dedit quosdam quidem apostolos, quosdam autem prophetas, alios vero  evangelistas, alios autem pastores et doctores ad consummationem sanctorum in opus  ministerii in aedificationem corporis Christi’, etc. </page> <page sequence="4"> 142 Conversations with Kenelm basis of his messianic status; so, for example, John 10:37-38 and 14:10-11:  ‘Si non facio opera Patris mei, nolite credere mihi; si autem facio, et si  mihi non vultis credere operibus, credite ut cognoscatis et credatis quia  in me est Pater et ego in Patris ... non credis quia ego in Patre et Pater in  me? Est verba quae ego loquor vobis a me ipso non loquor, Pater autem  in me manens, ipse facit opera. Non creditis quia ego in Patre et Pater in  me est.’ 4 To the fore, then, in this second moment of the gospel meditation  is an emphasis on the mutual indwellingness of the One who sends and  of the one who is sent, this in turn determining the relationship one with  another of those naming the name; for in the degree to which a man names  the name he not only indwells the Christ, in turn to be indwelt by him, but  he indwells all those professing the Christ, again to be indwelt by them: Non pro his autem rogo tantum, sed pro eis qui credituri sunt per  verbum eorum in me, ut omnes unum sint sicut tu, Pater, in me et  ego in te ut et ipsi in nobis unum sint, ut mundus credat quia tu me  misisti. Et ego claritatem quam dedisti mihi dedi eis ut sint unum  sicut nos sumus, ego in eis et tu in me ut sint consummati in unum ... (John 17:20-22)5 Here, therefore, in the Johannine phase of the argument, it is a question,  less of complimentarity, than of co-immanence as the form of collective  consciousness, of how one man might be said to enter into the humanity of  another there to shape and substantiate it from deep within itself. 3. Coming now to Dante, these models of collective being, the Pauline  model of contiguity and the Johannine model of co-inherence, bring us  to one of the most luminous aspects of his spirituality in the Commedia, to  his rejoicing in the rich configuration of man’s collective life in the Spirit.  Let us begin, however, if only because this is where Dante himself begins,  at the opposite end, with the kinds of tension and antagonism tending  to undermine and ultimately to destroy complementarity and mutual  4 If I am not acting as my Father would, do not believe me. But if I am, accept the  evidence of my deeds, even if you do not believe me, so that you may recognize and know  that the Father is in me, and I in the Father ... Do you not believe that I am in the Father  and the Father in me; I am not myself the source of the words I speak to you; it is the  Father who dwells in me doing his own  work. Believe me when I say that I am in the  Father and the Father in me. 5 But it is not for these alone that I pray, but for those also who through their words put their  faith in me; may they all be one: as you, Father, are in me, and I in you, so also may they be in  us, that the world may believe that you sent me. The glory which you gave me I have given to  them, that they may be one as we are one; I in them and you in me, may they be perfectly one. </page> <page sequence="5"> Complementarity and Coalescence 143 immanence thus understood as models of man’s being together as man.  Dante’s, then, with Aristotle’s, is a sense of the psychosomatic structure  of man’s presence in the world, the rational part of his nature constituting  the species intelligibilis or intelligible and operative principle of the whole.  But there is a difference, for happy as he is to talk with Aristotle and the  Aristotelians about human nature in terms of the specification of the whole  by way of the psyche rather than of the soma, he is happier, whenever the  opportunity presents itself, to proceed in affective categories, to discuss the  whole thing in terms of the complexity of properly human loving. Man as  man, then, loves variously: like the stones he cleaves to the ground, like the  plants he seeks out the goodness of the soil and the sunlight as conditions  of his proper well-being, like the animals he craves the pleasure of eating,  sleeping and procreating, and like the angels he yearns for an uncluttered  act of intellection, for an orderly understanding both of self and of the world  beyond self; so, for example, as testimony to a uniform pattern of thought in  Dante, and indeed to a uniform pattern of rejoicing, these lines from Book  III of the Convivio, a hymn to the openness of being in general and of human  being in particular to celebration under the aspect of its multiple affectivity: Onde è da sapere che ciascuna cosa, come detto è di sopra, per la  ragione di sopra mostrata ha ’l suo speziale amore. Come le corpora  simplici hanno amore naturato in sé a lo luogo proprio, e però la terra  sempre discende al centro; lo fuoco ha [amore a] la circunferenza  di sopra, lungo lo cielo de la luna, e però sempre sale a quello. Le  corpora composte prima, sì come sono le minere, hanno amore a  lo luogo dove la loro generazione è ordinata, e in quello crescono e  acquistano vigore e potenza; onde vedemo la calamita sempre da la  parte de la sua generazione ricevere vertù. Le piante, che sono prima  animate, hanno amore a certo luogo più manifestamente, secondo che  la complessione richiede; e però vedemo certe piante lungo l’acque  quasi c[ontent]arsi, e certe sopra li gioghi de le montagne, e certe ne  le piagge e dappiè monti: le quali se si transmutano, o muoiono del  tutto o vivono quasi triste, disgiunte dal loro amico. Li animali bruti  hanno più manifesto amore non solamente a li luoghi, ma l’uno l’altro  vedemo amare. Li uomini hanno loro proprio amore a le perfette  e oneste cose. E però che l’uomo, avvegna che una sola sustanza  sia, tuttavia [la] forma, per la sua nobilitade, ha in sé e la natura  [d’ognuna di] queste cose, tutti questi amori puote avere e tutti li ha. (Conv. III.iii.2-5)6 6 It should be explained here that, as was said above, for the reason given there, every  being has a love specific to it. Just as simple bodies have an inborn love for the place  proper to them – so that earth always descends to the centre, while fire has an inborn love  </page> <page sequence="6"> 144 Conversations with Kenelm But if man as man loves by way of the many impulses proper to his  complex nature, then how are these impulses to be organized, fitted in with  one another within the economy of the whole?  By way, Dante thinks, of  their bringing home to the kind of love given with the act itself of existence  and inclining the individual to seek out God as the beginning and end of all  seeking, herein alone lying the ground and legitimacy of his every affective  inflexion of the spirit. The key passages here, the first of them touching on  the species of human loving precisely as such and the second of them on the  gathering in of one kind of love to another, run as follows:  “Né creator né creatura mai” cominciò el, “figliuol, fu sanza amore, o naturale o d’animo; e tu ’l sai.  Lo naturale è sempre sanza errore, ma l’altro puote errar per malo obietto o per troppo o per poco di vigore.  Mentre ch’elli è nel primo ben diretto, e ne’ secondi sé stesso misura, esser non può cagion di mal diletto;  ma quando al mal si torce, o con più cura o con men che non dee corre nel bene, contra ’l fattore adovra sua fattura.  Quinci comprender puoi ch’esser convene amor sementa in voi d’ogne virtute e d’ogne operazion che merta pene” ...  Però, là onde vegna lo ’ntelletto de le prime notizie, omo non sape, e de’ primi appetibili l’affetto,  che sono in voi sì come studio in ape di far lo mele; e questa prima voglia for the circumference above us bordering the heaven of the Moon, and therefore always  rises upwards towards that – so primary compound bodies, such as minerals, have a  love for the place suited to their generation; in that place they grow, and from it they  derive their vigour and power. That is why, as we observe, the magnet always receives  power from the quarter in which it was generated. Plants, which are the primary form  of animate life, even more clearly have a love for certain places, in accordance with what  their constitution requires; so we see some deriving pleasure, as it were, when alongside  water, others when on the ridges of mountains, others when on slopes and on foothills; if  they are transplanted, they either die completely or live a sad life, as it were, like beings  separated from their friends. Human beings have their specific love for what is perfect  and just. And since the human being, despite the fact that his whole form constitutes a  single substance in virtue of its nobility, has a nature that embraces all these features, he  can have all these loves, and indeed does have them. </page> <page sequence="7"> Complementarity and Coalescence 145 merto di lode o di biasmo non cape.

The natural is always without error; but the other  may err either through an evil object, or through too much or too little vigour. While it is  directed on the primal good, and on secondary goods observes right measure, it cannot be  the cause of sinful pleasure. But when it turns awry to evil, or speeds to good with more  zeal, or with less, than it ought, against the creator works his creature. Hence you can  comprehend that love must needs be the seed in you of every virtue and of every action  deserving punishment ... Therefore, whence comes the intelligence of the first cognitions  man does not know, nor whence the affection for the first objects of desire, which exist in  you even as zeal in the bee for making honey; and this primal will admits no deserving of  praise or blame. Now in order that to this will every other will may be conformed, there is  innate in you the faculty that counsels and that ought to hold the threshold of consent. This  is the principle wherefrom is derived the reason of desert in you, according as it garners  and winnows good and evil loves. Those who in their reasoning went to the root of the  matter took note of this innate liberty, and accordingly bequeathed ethics to the world.”  Thomas on natural and elective love (dilectio naturalis and dilectio electiva), ST Ia.60.2 resp.:  ‘in Angelis est quaedam dilectio naturalis et quaedam electiva. Et naturalis dilectio in eis  est principium electivae, quia semper id quod pertinet ad prius, habet rationem principii;  unde, cum natura sit primum quod est in unoquoque, oportet quod id quod ad naturam  pertinet, sit principium in quolibet. Et hoc apparet in homine et quantum ad intellectum,  et quantum ad voluntatem. Intellectus enim cognoscit principia naturaliter, et ex hac  cognitione causatur in homine scientia conclusionum, quae non cognoscuntur naturaliter  ab homine, sed per inventionem vel doctrinam. Similiter in voluntate finis hoc modo se  habet, sicut principium in intellectu, ut dicitur in II Physic. Unde voluntas naturaliter  tendit in suum finem ultimum, omnis enim homo naturaliter vult beatitudinem. Et ex hac  naturali voluntate causantur omnes aliae voluntates, cum quidquid homo vult, velit propter  finem. Dilectio igitur boni quod homo naturaliter vult sicut finem, est dilectio naturalis,  dilectio autem ab hac derivata, quae est boni quod diligitur propter finem, est dilectio  electiva.’ O.

He knows himself in the kind of connatural loving given with the act itself  of existence and calling him from beforehand into the presence of God  as the first and final cause of all loving (‘amore naturale’), and he knows  himself in the kind of contingent loving generated by his encounter with  the world around him (‘amore d’animo’), his task as a creature of moral  accountability being to gather in the latter to the former as the principle  of his proper well-being, this gathering in of the one to the other being  the province of free will, of that faculty of the rational soul empowered to  decisive intervention. Only in the degree to which he is successful in this,  in bringing home occasional to essential loving, will he know himself  in the integrity and intelligibility of his presence in the world and in his  acceptability in the sight of God. Short of this, he knows himself, and  is known to his maker, only under the aspect of effrontery. But that is  not all, for in the moment of his disinclination to bring home one species  of loving to another, the next man, inasmuch as he is known to him at  all, is known to him by way only of intimidation, as forever looking to  see him off as a competitor and an intruder, at which point the social  aspect of it all – sin under the aspect of savagery – moves into view; so,  for example, the cases of the avaricious and of the prodigal in Canto VII  of the Inferno and of the counterfeiters in Canto XXX, each of whom,  divided against self in the recesses of self, lives at enmity with the world  beyond self, the crisis of collectivity being in this sense nothing but the  crisis of personality writ large:  Qui vid’ i’ gente più ch’altrove troppa, e d’una parte e d’altra, con grand’ urli, voltando pesi per forza di poppa.

VII.26-30 and XXX.100-108)8 Both psychologically and socially, then, it is a question of hostility.  Ranged over against self in the forum of conscience and forever living  out the fragility of this situation, the individual impressed by a sense of  his vulnerability in the world only ever knows his neighbour in a spirit  of resentment, of, at best, inconvenience and, at worst, menace, herein, in  the a-sociology of the Inferno, in its sense of being as but a matter of over- againstness, lying the twofold substance and sadness of it all. 4. What, then, of being in its authenticity, of being as gathered on the plane  of loving? In circumstances of inauthentic being communication gives way  as we have seen to communicationlessness. Established at the centre of  his universe, the individual neither knows nor is known by the next man,  preferring instead to subsist as a stranger to every kind of creative communion.  But in circumstances of authentic being, of being as transparent to its own  innermost reasons, a new species of collectivity emerges, repudiation giving  way to recognition as a habit of mind, to a sense of the next man as present  to self, less as an impediment, than as a means of affirmation. To take, then,  the Pauline model of contiguity, of being as a matter of being alongside, we  have first of all the Charles Martel passage of Paradiso VIII, a passage for  all its soaring substance alert to the notion of being and becoming in man as  a matter of civic being and becoming, of the individual’s bringing what he is  and what he has by way of the unprecedented and unparalleled properties  of personality to the collective enterprise:  Ond’ elli ancora: “Or dì: sarebbe il peggio per l’omo in terra, se non fosse cive?”. “Sì”, rispuos’ io; “e qui ragion non cheggio”.  “E puot’ elli esser, se giù non si vive diversamente per diversi offici? 8 Here I saw far more people than elsewhere, both on the one side and on the other,  howling loudly, rolling weights, which they pushed with their chest; they clashed  together, and then right there each wheeled round, rolling back his weight, shouting,  “Why do you hoard?” and “Why do you squander?” ... And one of them, who took offence  perhaps at being named so darkly, with his fist struck him on his stiff paunch; it sounded  like a drum; and Master Adam struck him in the face with his arm, which seemed no less  hard, saying to him, “Though I am kept from moving by the weight of my limbs, which  are heavy, I have a free arm for such a need”. </page> <page sequence="10"> 148 Conversations with Kenelm Non, se ’l maestro vostro ben vi scrive”.

Not if your master writes well of this for  you.” Thus he came deducing far as here, then he concluded, “Therefore the roots of your  works must be diverse, so that one is born of Solon and another Xerxes, one Melchizidek  and another he who flew through the air and lost his son.

Questi onde a me ritorna il tuo riguardo, è ’l lume d’uno spirto che ’n pensieri gravi a morir li parve venir tardo:  essa è la luce etterna di Sigieri, che, leggendo nel Vico de li Strami, silogizzò invidïosi veri. (Par. X.91-138)10 Here, then, patient demonstration (the ‘Sì venne deducendo infino a  quici’ of VIII.121) gives way to something closer to concelebration as a  10 You wish to know what plants these are that enflower this garland, which amorously  circles round the fair lady who strengthens you for heaven. I was of the lambs of the holy  flock which Dominic leads on the path where there is good fattening if they do not stray.  He that is next beside on the right was my brother and my master, and he is Albert of  Cologne, and I, Thomas of Aquino. If thus of all the rest you would be informed, come,  following my speech with your sight. The next flaming comes from the smile of Gratian,  who served the one and the other court so well that it pleases in  paradise. The other who  next adorns our choir was that Peter who, like the poor widow, offered his treasure to  Holy Church. The fifth light, which is the most beautiful among us, breathes with such  love that all the world there below thirsts to know tidings of it. Within it is the lofty mind  to which was given wisdom so deep that, if the truth be true, there never rose a second  of such full vision. At its side behold the light of that candle which, below in the flesh,  saw deepest into the angelic nature and its ministry. In the next little light smiles that  defender of the Christian times of whose discourse Augustine made use. If now you are  bringing your mind’s eye from light to light after my praises, you are already thirsting  for the eighth. Therewithin, through seeing every good, the sainted soul rejoices who  makes the fallacious world manifest to any who listen well to him. The body from which  it was driven lies down below in Cieldauro, and he came from martyrdom and exile to  this peace. See, flaming beyond, the glowing breath of Isidore, of Bede, and of Richard  who in contemplation was more than man. This one from whom your look returns to me  is the light of a spirit to whom, in his grave thoughts, it seemed that death came slow. It is  the eternal light of Siger who, lecturing in Straw Street, demonstrated invidious truths. </page> <page sequence="13"> Complementarity and Coalescence 151 mode of existence, Thomas’s, whatever else it is, being an ode to friendship  as the way of properly human affirmation. Fully and unambiguously  himself, in other words, and operating from out of a space wholly his own,  one individual comes alongside another to reassure him in respect both of  the distinctiveness and the decisiveness of his presence – of the presence  of each alike – in the world as party to the common undertaking and the  universal hymn of praise. But that is not all, for the argument stands now to be developed in  terms of the way in which, operating as it does from out of his own space,  each of those party to the universal proclamation may be said to operate  from out of the same space, from out of a consummate act of indwelling.  The model is Trinitarian, Dante’s Trinitarianism having about it both a  processional and a perichoretic aspect. First, then, on the processional  side, there is his sense of the Son’s issuing from the Father by way of  filiation or of begottenness, and of the Spirit’s issuing from the Father and  the Son together by way of spiration or of a species of breathing-forth; so,  for example, these two passages from Paradiso X (lines 1-6 and 49-51),  the former, in its attentiveness to the filioque (to the doctrine of the Spirit’s  proceeding from both the Father and the Son), recalling the Augustine  of the De trinitate, and the latter, more attuned to issues of filiation and  spiration, the Thomas of the Summa theologiae:  Guardando nel suo Figlio con l’Amore  che l’uno e l’altro etternalmente spira,  lo primo e ineffabile Valore   quanto per mente e per loco si gira  con tant’ ordine fé, ch’esser non puote  sanza gustar di lui chi ciò rimira.  ...  Tal era quivi la quarta famiglia  de l’alto Padre, che sempre la sazia,  mostrando come spira e come figlia.11 11 Looking upon his Son with the love which the one and the other eternally breathe  forth, the primal and ineffable power made everything that revolves through the mind  or through space with such order that he who contemplates it cannot but taste of him ...  Such was here the fourth family of the exalted Father who ever satisfies it, showing how  he breathes forth and how he begets. Most recently on the filioque (Augustine, De trin.

Thomas on filiation and  spiration, ST Ia.28.4 resp.: ‘Processio autem verbi dicitur generatio secundum propriam  rationem qua competit rebus viventibus. Relatio autem principii generationis in viventibus  perfectis dicitur paternitas; relatio vero procedentis a principio dicitur filiatio. Processio  vero amoris non habet nomen proprium ... Sed vocatur relatio principii hujus processionis  spiratio.’ On the procession of the Spirit from the Father by way of the Son, ST Ia.36.  2-3, and on the procession of the Spirit from the Son, ScG IV.xxiv-xxv. Notable among  the finer points of Dantean Trinitarianism are (a) its appropriation of creative power in  the Par. X.1-6 passage to the Father (the ‘con tant’ ordine fé’ of line 5; cf. Thomas, ST  Ia.45.6 ad 2: ‘patri attribuitur et appropriatur potentia, quae maxime manifestatur in  creatione; et ideo attribuitur patri creatorem esse. Filio autem appropriatur sapientia, per  quam agens per intellectum operatur, et ideo dicitur de Filio per quem omnia facta sunt.  Spiritui Sancto autem appropriatur bonitas, ad quam pertinet gubernatio, deducens res  in debitos fines, et vivificatio’); (b) its sense of the dispositive role of the Spirit in respect  of the Word as a principle of creation (the ‘Però se ’l caldo amor la chiara vista / de  la prima virtù dispone e segna, / tutta la perfezione quivi s’acquista’ of Par. XIII.79- 81); and (c) its linking of divine subsistence with the splendour of the Son in particular  (the Idea or λόγος) as the in-and-through-which of the creative initiative (the ‘Ciò che  non more e ciò che può morire / non è se non splendor di quella idea / che partorisce,  amando, il nostro Sire’ of Par. XIII.52-54, for which the ‘Qui cum sit splendor gloriae, et  figura substantiae ejus, portansque omnia verbo virtutis suae’ of Heb. 1:3). In respect of  the first and third of these emphases, Thomas, ST Ia.46.3 resp.: ‘Sicut enim principium  effectivum appropriatur patri, propter potentiam, ita principium exemplare appropriatur  filio, propter sapientiam, ut sicut dicitur, omnia in sapientia fecisti, ita intelligatur Deum  omnia fecisse in principio, idest in filio; secundum illud apostoli ad Coloss. I, in ipso,  scilicet filio, condita sunt universa.’ 12 For the terminology (περιχώρησις), Gregory Nazianzen, Epistula ci.6; xxii.4; Pseudo- Cyril, De sacro. trin. xxiv; John of Damascus De fide ortho. i.14, etc. On the notion of  perichoresis as dance (a pseudo-etymology), Hilary, De trin. ix.69.

O luce etterna che sola in te sidi, sola t’intendi, e da te intelletta e intendente te ami e arridi!13 Dante’s, then, to go by the rapt emphases of Paradiso XXXIII, is a  privileging of essence over economy as a way of seeing and celebrating the  three-in-oneness of the Godhead, this in turn encouraging him in the most  resplendent of his social formulations in the Commedia, in what amounts to  his last word on the nature of one man’s being with another at the point of  emergence; for to be with the next man at the point of emergence is to be, not  so much with him, as within him, as, somewhat after the manner of the Persons  themselves of the Godhead, indwelling and indwelt one by the other.

III.84 or the ‘D’i Serafin  che più s’india’ of IV.28), he speaks of the kind of ‘inhimming’, ‘inyouing’  and ‘inmeing’ whereby one instance of being in its blessedness may be said  to indwell another, a way of thinking and of speaking designed, not so much  to liquidate otherness as a property of historical selfhood, as to confirm  the radical nature of one man’s presence to another in the moment of self- actualization. In the moment of self-actualization, Dante maintains, one man  is present to another, not merely as a companion or fellow breaker of bread,  but as an immanently operative principle of being and becoming, at which  point diversity gives way to identity as a principle of social intelligence, as  a way of conceiving and articulating the dialectic in human experience of  being in self and being with another, of Selbstsein and Mitsein:  “Dio vede tutto, e tuo veder s’inluia”, diss’ io, “beato spirto, sì che nulla voglia di sé a te puot’ esser fuia.  Dunque la voce tua, che ’l ciel trastulla sempre col canto di quei fuochi pii che di sei ali facen la coculla,  perché non satisface a’ miei disii? Già non attendere’ io tua dimanda, s’io m’intuassi, come tu t’inmii”. (Par. IX.73-81)14 Thus Trinitarianism once again encourages and facilitates, as  Trinitarianism always, does a rethinking of the social issue in human  experience; for if on the one hand there is a sense in which to be as man is  to stand alone in respect of that which matters alone (this being the point  of Dante’s preference for the first-person singular in the Commedia), there  is also a sense in which that same being both knows and is known by way  of its brooking no dimensionality, no impediment to the mutual informing  of self and the other-than-self in the moment of affirmation. 14 “God sees all, and into him your vision sinks, blessed spirit”, I said, “so that no  wish may steal itself from you. Why then does your voice, which ever gladdens heaven  – together with the singing of those devout fires that make themselves a cowl with six  wings – not satisfy my longings? Surely I should not wait for your request, were I in  you, even as you are in me”. Cf. Par. XXII.124-29: ‘“Tu se’ sì presso a l’ultima salute”, /  cominciò Bëatrice, “che tu dei / aver le luci tue chiare e acute; / e però, prima che tu più  t’inlei, / rimira in giù, e vedi quanto mondo / sotto li piedi già esser ti fei”. </page> </plain_text>
