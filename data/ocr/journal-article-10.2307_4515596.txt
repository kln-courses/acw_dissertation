An excavation conducted in the potters' quarter at Kafir Kal'a, 5 kilometers south of Tali Barzu, yielded many Sasanian objects. The pottery was stamped with pomegranate designs and had flakes of mica on the surface. Human and animal figurines of terra cotta and a clay slab with an effigy of a human head in high relief were unearthed. Excavations were conducted also at five other sites. A fragment of a storage vessel bearing the image of Gopat-Shah (the bull with a human face) was discovered. This vessel is being de- scribed by C. V.

HENRY FIELD and EUGENE PROSTOV "PAGAN AND CHRISTIAN EGYPT." AN EXHIBITION The exhibition held at the Brooklyn Museum from the end of January until early in March, I94I, represented the first attempt at a compre- hensive showing of Coptic art in the United States, and the effort met with general praise and approval. While the material was very simply and hence most effectively displayed, because of the difficulty of assigning precise dates to many of the pieces included, no effort was made to fol- low a historical continuity in the arrangement of the works of art-executed in the period from the first to the eleventh centuries of the Christian era. An easy calculation demonstrates the impor- tance which the show had both to the scholarly specialist and to the casual visitor: of the 271 objects displayed, 2I8 had not received previous notice in print, and of this latter number some 7 "Gopat-Sah le Roi-berger," Travaux du Departe- ment Oriental, Musee de 'Ermitage (Leningrad, I940), II, 71-85 (in Russian), 86 (French resume). 127 pieces were illustrated in the catalogue of the exhibition. The largest category of the exhibits was that of the textiles. The amount of such material in large and small museums and in private hands is really astounding, and this sheer weight of num- bers suggests that a study of the woven pieces offers the soundest basis for clarifying the char- acteristics of Coptic art. Just as noteworthy were objects of less familiar character: basalt portrait heads, multicolored marble vases, and a variety of objects in bronze. Pieces from the great mu- seums did not always command the most at- tention, for most important material came from less accessible sources, such as Goucher College, Cooper Union Museum, Pratt Institute, Textile Museum of the District of Columbia, and the collections of Dr. W. R. Valentiner and Professor V. G. Simkhovitch-to name only a few. Since the close of the exhibition the Brooklyn Museum has been able to acquire a number of the fine privately owned pieces for its permanent collec- tion. The catalogue of the show was handsomely printed and contained excellent illustrations. It included two compact and valuable sections of text by John D. Cooney and Elizabeth Riefstahl, who were the motivating forces of the exhibition. The articles call attention to the problems of Coptic art and stress the fact that the Coptic period must be considered from a number of dif- ferent angles, and that the general political, eco- nomic, and religious manifestations of the time supply the clues needed in drawing up a compre- hensive account of the artistic activity of these centuries. The problems stressed have a familiar sound: what period and area should the term "Coptic" designate; what are the sources of Cop- tic style; how can Coptic style be characterized? The last point is most important, for it is strik- ingly true that only very limited efforts have been made to define Coptic style, i.e., to isolate the peculiar features of composition, drawing, posi- tion of figures in relation to the picture plane, use I50</page><page sequence="2">NOTES '5' of perspective, types of figure and facial drawing, technical means, and all other factors which re- sult in the distinctive appearance of these works. Since these problems concern everyone interested in the general field of Near Eastern art, they will be made the subject of the present review which attempts, in narrow compass, to summa- rize recent evidence relating to these questions and to suggest a specific field for further investi- gations. The objects on display were presumed to have been executed in Egypt and are assigned to both pagan and Christian sources. Normally, the works are referred to as Coptic. What connota- tion should the term Coptic carry? The word Copt stems from Aegyptios, the Greek geograph- ical term as corrupted to Guptios and then to modern Egyptian Gupti and hence Copt in Euro- pean tongues. The term might be applied to all artistic production from the first century A.D. until the years of the Arab invasions, for there is no valid way by which the artistic productions of these centuries can be separated into such groups as nonreligious, pagan religious, or Chris- tian, since only a very small fraction of objects which were undoubtedly produced by ardent Christian workmen illustrate Biblical or hagio- logical scenes. This rather curious situation is one which prevailed throughout the eastern Med- iterranean world at this time. The fact that fer- vent Christian communities may have produced little "Christian" art is witnessed by excavations at several sites in Syria, which have revealed a paucity of material decorated with purely Chris- tian subject matter. If it is advisable to assign inarrower limits to Coptic art, the third century can be chosen as the starting point, for by this time Christian motifs had made their appearance in all corners of the Roman world. The period should include all artistic production in the Nile Valley area to a century or so after the Islamic invasions, since it was a number of decades be- fore sufficient hostility to Christianity was fanned in the hearts of the invaders for them to carry out the destruction of churches. After the middle of the eighth century the term Coptic should be used to apply to works of Christian subject matter; particularly to the paintings of the obscure and long-lived monasteries in the upper valley. The sources from which this style of pagan and Christian Egypt emerges are commonly con- sidered to be numerous, elusive, and obscure. Coptic art is not ranked as a major monumental style, yet few substyles can display as marked a dependence upon multiple antecedents. Most speculation regarding the sources and character of the style have been distressingly vague. Thus, one can read that Coptic art "rose from the con- flict between indigenous art and invading Hellen- ism," was "a vital re-awakening of the ancient national spirit," appeared as "a fusion of Egyp- tian, Asiatic, Hellenistic, and Christian influ- ences," or finally, that "as Coptic Egypt was a provincial backwater, so was its art." Such state- ments have definite merit as attempts to reduce complexity to simple terms, but they are at the same time too general and too remote from a di- rect consideration of the objects themselves. It might appear that one way of isolating the distinctive elements of Coptic style would be to determine which of the artistic media seemed to be most characteristic of the period and then subject the objects of that medium to a detailed stylistic analysis. At first sight it might appear that the medium would be weaving, since textiles form the great bulk of the preserved material. Although the textiles come primarily from Lower Egypt, there is no assurance that they were woven in ateliers in the vicinity of the cemeteries in which they were found; indeed, the consensus of opinion is that a considerable percentage of them were loomed outside of the borders of Egypt, a fact which is mentioned in the exhibition cata- logue and which again draws attention both to the problem of defining "Coptic" art and to the title of the exhibition itself. Elements of archi- tectural construction and decoration of stone elaborately carved furnish useful indices as to</page><page sequence="3">I52 NOTES style since the very bulk and weight of the mate- rial may imply that it was used near its place of execution. Running counter to this assumption is the current theory of Kitzinger that the best of Coptic sculpture is of imported style, and, in- deed, the objects do support this assumption, notably a most distinctive piece of architectural carving for many years in the Cairo Museum, which is now matched by fragments excavated at Antioch. Wood carving mirrors the patterns and technique of work in stone, whereas the bronzes, as objects in the round, are more distinctive in appearance, but are not present in sufficient quantities to be considered as a group. The mural paintings of Upper Egypt offer a fairly homo- geneous group and should provide the attractive possibility of establishing the difference in style, assumed by nearly all scholars, between the pro- vincial work of these painters and the technically finer work of the artisans of Alexandria and the Delta. It should be noted, however, that the repertoire of the paintings is quite comparable to that of the textiles, wood and stone carvings, and ivories thought to be made in the Delta region. In fact, all media show such consistency in pat- tern forms and subject matter that no single group can be separated from the rest. Further, the distinction based on merit of execution be- tween the products of the Delta and Upper Egypt seems dubious, especially when actual compari- sons are made between pieces whose locale is fixed and others traditionally assigned to Upper or Lower Egypt. The fact is that as recent excavations and the assemblage of scattered objects in exhibitions such as the one under discussion bring to our attention great masses of material from Egypt and the fringes of the Mediterranean the possi- bility arises that Coptic art and style is not peculiarly distinctive of either Upper or Lower Egypt or even of Egypt as a unit. The art seems characteristically Egyptian only inasmuch as cer- tain media were developed at the expense of others. The excavations of late years in Syria and Palestine have so expanded the amount of comparative material available for a considera- tion of art in the late Roman world that we are now compelled to consider style in terms of the expressive production of wide areas and the ac- cepted concept of the growth of early Christian art has been greatly modified. It may now be possible to postulate a "littoral style," which was common to the eastern fringes of the Mediter- ranean from the third through the eighth cen- turies: a style characterized by a fixed repertoire of fairly limited range and in which-as far as extant objects witness-although the art was pro- duced in ardently Christian communities, pagan motifs predominate. Once the repertoire and technique of this style, the cohesive expression of an historical period, are established, attention can be concentrated upon the various centers in which it was practiced, and local idiosyncrasies of execution and subject matter will be easily de- tected. As an example of successful work in this direction may be cited the studies made by Pfister in which he established a number of textile sub- jects as being of obvious Egyptian and Nilotic origin. Such an example demonstrates the pro- gram of studies: the Nilotic scenes establish a provenance for certain pieces, these textiles are treated to technical analysis and the observations concerning distinctive features in looming com- mon to the groups are conclusive enough to place identical weavings which portray less distinctive subject matter in the same local group and hence in Egyptian ateliers. In more general terms the approach to textiles and other works of art should be as follows: first the art historians assign a dis- tinctive subject group to important urban areas, basing their findings upon local landscapes, long established regional types, the prominence of cer- tain local deities, etc., working as much with literary material of contemporary date as by direct comparison of objects. The textile experts point out the peculiarities of the regional weaves and, finally, pieces of similar weave are assigned to augment the original groupings.</page><page sequence="4">NOTES '53 It becomes increasingly clear that well- thumbed pattern books formed the backbone of this "littoral style." Actually, in one geograph- ical area mosaics might be the favorite medium and in another area textiles, but the repertoire remained common and constant. The scenes and patterns of the Antioch mosaics offer a splendid opportunity for establishing the repertoire of this style, and the intensive studies now undertaken at Princeton along these lines should bear early fruit. Mosaics of the third and later centuries as they come to light in the far flung sites of the ancient world reveal a distinct cleavage in style between the floors found in Italy and France and those of North Africa, Syria, and Palestine, al- though there are certain stylistic traits common to North Africa and Italy. For the most part ornamental patterns characteristic of the Syrian mosaics and the Egyptian textiles never were adopted on the Italian mainland. The patterns of the eastern Mediterranean mosaics are in a large part indigenous, with certain of them standard Hellenistic motifs which had been modified in a manner more in keeping with the tastes of the general period. Certain patterns, such as the common diagonal square or lattice pattern, were used in textiles, mosaics, and stone carving, and yet the pattern is one which logically results from the technique of the loom. A point to be empha- sized is that many of the patterns which must have made up the pattern book of this style owed their origin to the manner in which fabrics are woven. The missing fabrics are represented by occasional pieces such as the cut-pile woolen rug from Egypt in the Metropolitan Museum, as- signed to about 400 A.D., which displays a highly developed technique and suggests that certain patterns were prevalent in textiles at least as early as they are found in mosaics of the coastal regions. Mosaics and textiles show a comparable rec- tilinearity in the bounding lines of their forms and patterns. The use of square or rectangular stones and the right angle crossing of the threads in the loom establish a common denominator of appearance. The mosaics do reflect a conscious attempt to produce flowing and more naturalistic forms, and the presence of a similar technique in the frescoes at Bdwit illustrates that this same approach was common to Egypt. This possibility of a greater freedom of design and execution in murals and pavements may explain why certain subjects of the Syrian repertoire are not found in Coptic textiles. A typical subject is that of the large compositions in which many animals are freely scattered about the area; the animals may be pursued by hunters or they may represent a menagerie of unusual and exotic species. Often rectilinearity becomes the predominant feature of the compositions: Figure i, a hanging in the Textile Museum of the District of Columbia, and Figure 2, a mosaic floor from Antioch, provide good examples. Both may date from the fifth or sixth century, and both have the strong framework of the diagonal square pattern with zoomorphic, anthropomorphic, and vegetable forms within the square. The Antioch floor is a better illustration of the development of the pat- tern itself-strands of naturalistic flowers which through repetition were debased to bands of al- ternating colors. Beyond the scope of this report is the assumption that the origin of this design is the floral-strewn costumes of Sasanian Persia and that it becomes less recognizable the further it is transported from its point of origin. It seems perfectly logical that certain of the urban centers should have emphasized particular media, and yet another factor must be considered before one accepts the statement that the princi- pal art product of Syria was mosaics and that of Egypt was textiles. In Egypt the periodical in- undations and the difficulty of securing a good rock or gravel bed discouraged the use of mosaics, while, on the other hand, the burying grounds located above the flood level preserved the fab- rics in hot and dry sand. In Syria the damp cli- mate destroyed these materials except at such semiarid sites as Palmyra, so that a knowledge</page><page sequence="5">I54 NOTES of the textile art of Antioch and other related centers must be recreated from pieces exported to places where they have been preserved. How was the "littoral style" developed and how did it establish a predominance in this wide locale? In the opening years of the Christian era the economic power of the Roman Empire had begun to shift from Italy to the east and the universal state gradually became all-embracing to the extent that its citizens comprised racial, tribal, and national groups of endless variety and complexity; groups which had an "oriental" cast and in which Greek rather than Latin was the principal means of communication. The guiding policy during and after the long years of the im- perial peace was to push the bounds of the empire ever eastward, the more distant the outposts the greater the assurance of continued internal tran- quility. The great harbor cities held the key to both economic growth and prosperity and to mili- tary communications and in this category Antioch and Alexandria were predominant. Alexandria was not closely tied to the more remote interior, for the reaches of Africa were hostile and impen- etrable and offered no considerable access to com- mercially valuable regions, but Antioch was the emporium from which contacts of every kind were maintained with the limits of Hither Asia. The trade routes and military paths led inland from Syria, and along these roads passed the le- gionnaires bringing back their distorted interpre- tations of the manifold religious cults of the interior, along them came the fabulous products of the East and even the elements of artistic creation-subject matter, a fluid manner, and certain precise technical skills. Antioch and Alex- andria had a related interest and development in business and the arts and were bound together by the highway of the sea. Specific patterns and motifs could be cited in quantity to prove this connection in the arts, and these examples would also demonstrate the movements of forms and ideas from the east to the west. A very familiar and characteristic pattern is that illustrated in Figures 3 and 4, the former a section of a lime- stone frieze recently acquired by the Brooklyn Museum through an exchange with the Univer- sity Museum of Philadelphia and the latter the border of an Antiochian mosaic. The treatment of this general category of birds, animals, or hu- man figures within the compartments of foliage scrolls is subject to considerable variation. On one hand the scroll may send out numerous twist- ing tendrils and the figures may overlap the scroll so that the design expands into every part of the area. On the other hand emphasis is placed upon a tightly constructed scroll of uni- form thickness with the figures constricted with- in its compartments. In this type the shapes of the pattern areas and the pattern voids are set off in sharp contrast. The examples shown rep- resent moderate, not extreme, cases of this differ- ence in approach and naturally the freer one is considered to be the progenitor of the formal type and also closer to the source of inspiration in the East. These Christian centuries were a time of fund- amental change in art, when Hellenistic forms were to give way to Byzantine ones, with all the concomitant features of colorism replacing plas- ticity, linear expression triumphing over three- dimensional form, rhythm succeeding balanced composition and abstraction, and stylization plac- ing emphasis on spiritual content rather than on naturalistic representation. Hither Asia-whence came the nucleus of the littoral style-did not actually institute such changes, which were rather the result of an altered universal outlook toward the features and fancies of the visible and in- visible worlds, but that region did supply spe- cific motifs and the general artistic attitude that proved to be in perfect harmony with the spirit of the times. While the traditional aspects of re- ligion and culture were being drastically modi- fied by a relentless current of change, the great cities came to be the staunchest upholders of tra- dition in the arts and the familiar and tried in daily life. These areas represented the sturdy</page><page sequence="6">~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~A- COURTESY, COMMITTIEE FOR THE EXCAVATION oFr ANTIOCH AND ITS VICINIT FIG. 2-PART OF MOSAIC PAVEMENT FROm ANTIOCH.

If any variation between the reaction of the great cities can be detected, or even assumed, it may well be that Antioch was more prone than was Alexandria to foster the decorative attitude which would culminate in Byzantine style. In all the cities the break with the Hellenistic past was never the sudden and decisive event that it was in the smaller communities and the more isolated countryside. In the remote regions of Palestine, Mesopotamia, Asia Minor, and North Africa changes in mode of representation and the alteration of well-established patterns and motifs were much more immediate and very much more drastic. In these regions no strong cul- tural heritage supplied a focal point of re- sistance to the prevailing spirit of change. Thus, Coptic art, here and now defined as one expression of the littoral and city style in the media of weaving, painting, and carv- ing, is a reflection of the conservative branch of the art of the period, and in spite of the multiple indications of uneven, wavering execution and of the dissolution of composition into isolated units it was a vital factor in prolonging the life of Hel- lenistic style. Regardless of the fact that many paintings and carvings were executed or installed in obscure localities and in spite of a real lack of monumentality, the art did represent the enlight- ened and stable factors of the urban centers in contrast to the more primitive expression of the areas farther inland or more distant from the great Hellenistic cities. The elements which amalgamated into the common Alexandria-Antioch or littoral and city style can be assigned to three main currents: (i) the remnants of the Hellenistic heritage, (2) the newly developed and newly popular themes and pattern forms, and (3) the patterns and designs moving westward from the confines of Hither Asia. Such a postulate is not mere speculation, for in a longer study it would be possible to iso- late a number of specific themes, as for example that of the representations of personifications of abstract qualities or of many pattern forms, that are found in Syria and Egypt with increasing frequency from the third century onward, while they occur rarely or not at all in Italy. The ar- tistic influences of which such examples are the reflection passed from Antioch to Alexandria. The route led from Iran and Mesopotamia, with branches in Asia Minor, through Dura and Pal- myra to the Syrian littoral. Dated monuments support this movement. A typical example of both the direction of the movement and the breakdown of style in isolated areas is the fact that a mosaic found in Palestine dated only a few years later than one from Antioch has the same essential composition and pattern elements, but the style already has disintegrated in the hands of provincial workmen. The great cities naturally attracted the best craftsmen and had the most active ateliers. As the pattern books they were establishing and using passed to the hands of workmen in Diarash, Amman, and Baal- bek the style disintegrated into blocky and hasty renderings of plant and animal forms and to an extreme simplification of the geometrical motifs. The mere fact of this demonstrable disintegration is part of the evidence for strong artistic connec- tion between Syria and Egypt via the sea, for the art of Palestine in all these years is hesitant and backward, and if the land route down into Egypt had been important this would not have been the case. In a highly commercial and competitive era, one in which the surviving documents deal with banking, taxes, landed estates, and law suits, art itself was a commercial undertaking, and the large ateliers of Alexandria and Antioch were cer- tainly alert to specific demands and vogues and in a position to maintain a direct exchange of arti- sans to keep the output in either center at de- sired levels. Several qualifications must be made against the assumption that the best craftsmen worked only in these and other littoral cities; for example, the best stone cutters were still trained in Asia Minor and spread their craft from that</page><page sequence="9">I56 NOTES region. Also certain artistic products were pro- duced for export as well as for home consumption. Thus, textiles found in Egypt which experts con- sider were not woven in the country might equally well have been made in another region for local tastes or woven in another center specifically to meet Egyptian tastes and primarily for direct export. That the repertoire of Alexandria and of An- tioch was very similar, was restricted, and was one in which purely Christian subjects were few in number may be established more specifically by listing the traits of this repertoire as they ap- pear in textiles and mosaics. General groupings are: i. Geometrical or abstract ornament 2. Naturalistic ornament 3. Animals and humans in the compartments of vine scrolls 4. Repeat patterns embracing large areas 5. Personages used to represent abstract vir- tues and qualities 6. Scenes of Christian subject matter 7. Scenes of pagan heritage: scenes from myth- ology and pagan cults All these categories are well displayed in the objects shown at the Brooklyn Museum and few of the pieces included fail to fit into one of these groups. With relation to the paucity of Christian subject matter a final word of warning may be given. Many of the textiles have scenes or bear fragments of inscriptions which suggest a Christian character, but both scenes and texts may be associated with pagan cults, in particular those of Isis and Osiris, and it is well known that these survived in Egypt until the Arab in- vasion. Thus, a textile bearing the words "life" and "light" may be Christian or it may equally well be associated with the Isis legend, and two plaques identified in the catalogue as representa- tions of St. Sisinnios and St. Thekla may be either pagan in subject matter or Christianized versions of established pagan compositions. Certainly, scholars concerned with the late survivals of the pagan cults will find rich material in these tex- tiles and carvings. As the Coptic style blossomed into the Byzan- tine it carried over into early Islamic art. A num- ber of the fabrics in the exhibition are Islamic in date, and they were certainly executed in Egypt. This raises the interesting question as to what changes in style were introduced along with the Arab invasions. It cannot be said that the Islamic pieces are more sketchily rendered, less studied in design, or woven with less skill than fabrics of the fifth and sixth centuries. All during the Coptic period a clear distinction can be made be- tween the products of the best ateliers and the much more angular, crowded, and distorted fig- ures and patterns executed by the less skilled weavers. The Islamic pieces may be character- ized, aside from their inscriptions, by the use of figures in a seated position with legs crossed, by costumes in which interest is centered on an all- over pattern instead of on folds into which the garment falls, and by changes in the manner of representing growing forms. The problem of just why and how such features appear in early Mus- lim art remains to be considered as part of the neglected subject of Islamic iconography. DONALD N. WILBER THE DATING OF COPTIC TEXTILES IN THE LIGHT OF EXCAVATIONS AT DURA-EUROPOS* The majority of preconquest Egyptian tex- tiles date from the fifth and sixth centuries A.D. One seldom sees a dating previous to the fourth century. This applies to textiles in both Euro- pean and American museums. Recently, there have been found textiles in both tapestry and pile technique excavated at a site in extreme eastern Syria on the west bank of the Euphrates.
