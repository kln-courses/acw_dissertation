<plain_text><page sequence="1">KEVIN NEWMARK Editor's Preface The pyramids put before our eyes the very image of symbolical art itself; they are gigantic crystals which conceal within themselves an inner content.... But this realm of death and the invisible which constitutes the meaning here has only one side, and a merely formal one at that. -HEGEL The essays collected in this volume are meant to address the question of the relationship between linguistic and historical structures of meaning, or in slightly different terms, between the reading and the experience of literary texts. Among the concepts long-familiar within literary studies, "symbolism" would thus seem singularly privileged in making apparent the possible con- vergence of historical experience with linguistic structures, since it names simultaneously a specific period in French literary history and a more general rhetorical, tropological practice that can belong to texts independently of their dates and signatures. If the symbol, to take Baudelaire's famous example, is a poetic transport, transfer, or correspondence between the mind and the senses, 1 then it follows that the literary (symbolist) texts in which such a link between the intellect and the world is made most explicit should themselves admit of easy coordination with a discipline like history, the main tenet of whose own discourse is the wholly parallel link between thought and action. Theoretically speaking, there should be no difficulty in moving beyond the rhetorical model of the symbol to the historical period-concept of symbolism, since in principle there should be perfect complementarity between a rethoric uniting mind and matter and a history connecting literary forms and empirical events. Like the letters that come together to spell out their mutual rela- tionship, "symbol" should fit into "symbolism" as smoothly as the part of any symbolon fits into the whole. The suspicion that such a symbolic correspondence between symbolism and history may not be wholly unproblematic, however, is aroused by what is 1. The scents that "chantent les transports de l'esprit et des sens" in the last stanza of "Corres- pondances" can legitimately be considered a subset of the "forests of symbols" in the first stanza of the poem. Mallarm6's well-known statement, "Je dis: une fleur! et, hors de l'oubli oil ma voix relegue aucun contour ... musicalement se lve, idee meme et suave, l'absente de tous bouquets," would be equally suitable for illustrating the same symbolic structure-though in a negative mode-that connects world (fleur) and mind (idee) by way of the mediation of language (voix).

Jean-Aubry (Paris: Gallimard, 1945), 368. iii</page><page sequence="2">iv Yale French Studies itself an empirical fact: namely, it is precisely "symbolism" that history has tended always to accuse of being overly "literary" and, consequently, insuffi- ciently "historical." Like Hegel's monumental pyramids, symbolism seems to promise a crystalline symmetry of inside and outside, of the intelligible and the sensuous, and is then criticized for delivering only a onesided, colorless, and eventually lifeless formalism. It is a historical fact that symbolism is not historical, at least not in any sense that history would require of it: in fact, symbolism refuses history, it interrupts the narrative continuity of history through its particular linguistic, i.e., rhetorical practice of the symbol, and history responds, predictably enough, by attempting to efface this threat to its authority.2 This is confirmed, it would seem, by the difficulty historians recur- rently experience in even identifying symbolists worthy of the name, as the chief representatives-shadowy figures like Emile Verhaeren, Stuart Merrill, Albert Mockel and others-are regularly eclipsed in favor of historically more solid entities like Baudelaire, Mallarme, Rimbaud, and Valery. Which is cer- tainly not to suggest that Henri de Regnier and the other symbolists are the equals of their poetic predecessors and descendants-they are not-but rather that history has a very ahistorical, that is, structural stake in eliding precisely that element of symbolism that puts into question the possibility of ordinary history by contesting the mutual interpenetration of the mind and the world, reading and experience. History has to erase or forget symbolism "properly speaking" in order to construct a narrative of poetic development in which the linguistic symbol can be reduced to a merely genetic pattern of predecessors and descendants, that is, to the symmetrical margins of a "before" and an "after." Such a dismissive and ultimately specular gesture is readily apparent in the well-known title of Marcel Raymond's canonical study of modern poet- ry, De Baudelaire au surrealisme, where the potentially disruptive moment of symbolism is virtually forgotten by burying it within a movement that both precedes and succeeds it, that is, engenders it and more importantly, survives it. And at this point, since whatever symbolism is, it cannot be merely or simply historical in the current sense, it would be every bit as legitimate to consider symbolism as the rhetorical, figural moment within any given text- Kant's, Baudelaire's, Valery's, or James's for instance-as the literal constella- tion of second-rate French poets at the end of the nineteenth century. In the long run, moreover, such distinctions would hardly make a difference from the standpoint of a history of symbolism, since in either case the totalizing move- ment of the "from-to" structure of the narrative development would presum- ably allow for the same kind of historical reintegration of the symbol's disrup- tive elements within genetic patterns of ancestry and filiation. For it should be as easy to reduce a sonnet by Mallarme to the unfolding history of an in- 2. The precise element in the symbol that interferes with its assimilation to historical dis- course is not easy to state with succinctness, and it remains the major theoretical crux of the essays that follow.</page><page sequence="3">KEVIN NEWMARK V comprehensible figure as it is to reduce the challenge of modem poetry to the narrative unfolding of symbolic language in general. Taken as a group, in fact, one of the more important contributions of the essays collected here to the general study of symbolism is their suggestion by example that just such a reduction of the symbol and its complications to narrative histories that are genetic as well as sequential is not something that we can learn to avoid or control, but is rather a necessary feature of any attempt to understand, that is, to read (symbolist) texts. Documenting the effacement of the symbol by the discourses of history necessitates in its own turn a sequen- tial narrative of this erasure, and so performs a new effacement upon the old rather than restoring adequate access to something like the symbol "proper." Some of the ways in which this occurs here are to be noted in the remarkable regularity with which texts continue to be read within genetic patterns that are chronological (Baudelaire/Mallarme, Mallarme/Valery, Nietzsche/Apolli- naire), hermeneutic (Old Testament/New Testament), formal (re- cit/narration), and/or sexual. In each case, though in varying degrees, the actu- al object of the reading-the linguistic symbol-is displaced within a histor- ical narrative of origin and end that necessarily still leaves the most disruptive elements elusively absent. Of course, this does little to make the ensuing narrative very reliable from an epistemological point of view, though it does make the readings themselves "historical" in the sense that they actually do accomplish the displacements or erasures they set out to describe. History, then, is not the various stories these essays continue to narrate, but rather the one event they actually perform: the textual disposal of symbolism, the forget- ting of the symbol's threat to history by ultimately recalling only what pre- cedes and follows it, that is, the erection of a memorial to symbolism's blank, the monumental turning of the symbol into an empty pyramid or phantom proxy of itself in order to preserve history's own narrative integrity. But if such historicizing gestures of recuperation are truly inevitable, does this not also mean that there would be no essential difference between this collection of essays and other readings of symbolism, or even between indi- vidual essays in this volume? To try to state the possible differences in a bare paraphrase of the essays would be the least historical event imaginable, since it would immediately dispense with the act of reading (the symbol) that bestows on them whatever historical dimensions they may possess. But a genuine reading of these readings would reveal how the narrative histories that re- emerge on the far side of a reading of the symbol's effacement by history differ entirely from the kind of pseudo-history that merely effaces the symbol by not reading it. The difference would be something like that between an erasure that is an ahistorical non-event because it consists in a refusal to read, and "is" nothing more than a simulacrum (of reading), and an erasure that is historical through and through because it actually takes place and occurs as reading. An example may be helpful at this point. On the surface, few essays in this volume seem as monumentalizing and recuperative as Paul de Man's "The</page><page sequence="4">vi Yale French Studies Double Aspect of Symbolism," a text written in the midfifties and never pub- lished during its author's lifetime. A certain challenge addressed to the con- temporary authorities in the field, an existential vocabulary of death and an- guished failure coupled with an unmistakable apocalyptic tone that gains its momentum by piling up predominantly thematic examples taken from Baudelaire and Mallarme-all this contributes to the impression of an intel- ligent but after all traditional and even somewhat Oedipal essay that not only enhances our understanding of the historical moment of symbolism, but also allows for an added measure of self-definition by bringing this moment into contact with our own modernity. If Mallarme's process of "becoming" marks a falling off from Baudelaire's privileged moments of "being," it is a falling off toward authenticity and truth, and the unquestioned genetic movement here from Baudelaire to Mallarme also marks an advance toward what de Man himself finally calls "the road of our truth." Such would be the archtypical non-reading of symbolism: a narrative memorial to symbolism's past lack, failure, or death in order to point toward the future prospects of our own identity and self-understanding. However, the fact that such a reading would at the same time nudge a body of work as subtle and evasive as de Man's toward an equally linear progression from the thematic and phenomenological crit- icism of the nineteen fifties, to the close reading and deconstruction of the sixties and seventies, and finally on to the suggestive combination of rhetorical and political analyses promised in the last essays of the eighties should give us pause. For this thoroughly genetic narrative from theme to language to history is too "symbolic" and close to our own self-image and interests to be merely coincidental. Which also implies that there is no such thing as a reading or a non-reading tout court, but only readings of readings and non-readings; and reading de Man's essay as a non-reading of symbolism turns out to be one of the most effective defenses against reading at all. What such a non-historical non-event of non-reading would not consist in-were it actually to exist-is an account of the necessary interference and ultimate disjunction in the reading of historical conceptions of development (from Baudelaire to Mallarme to us) and tropological structures of meaning (the symbol as the linguistic mediation between the mind and the senses). In de Man's case, it would be easy enough to point to discrete complications of this order within the language of each of the authors considered (Baudelaire's being and not-being, Mallarme's development and repetition, Holderlin's expecta- tion and memory). But undoubtedly the most telling moment of reading occurs in the essay by way of the gesture at the end that clearly inscribes symbolism's "future" as a non-dialectical movement "beyond symbolism," and which has already taken place in the textual "past" of Holderlin.3 Such is the case, of 3. For de Man's own reading of this "beyond" within the text of symbolism, and of the way such a non-dialectical "beyond" disrupts all genetic schemes of development, see his return to Baudelaire's "Correspondances": "for does 'beyond' here mean a movement beyond some particu- lar place or does it mean a state that is beyond movement entirely? And how can 'beyond', which</page><page sequence="5">KEVIN NEWMARK Vii course, not only in the casually historical sense in which Holderlin predates both Baudelaire and Mallarme, but also in the much more essential sense in which our own modernity is something that, far from awaiting us, has already occurred in Holderlin's texts on modernity and remembrance, and thus re- mains only to be read rather than experienced. This goes entirely counter to a concept of reading based on genetic models of history-either of the relation Baudelaire/Mallarme, or early de Man/late de Man, or symbolism/history, or history/modernity-and for this reason blocks or interrupts its own historical narrative in a very literal way that cannot be simply reassimilated to a nar- rative sequence. And once this interference is textually inscribed in a reading, it becomes a potential disruption at every stage of the historical narrative it helps to articulate: it is therefore what de Man would call the irony of the symbol, what Jean Moreas actually did refer to in his 1886 Symbolist Man- ifesto as symbolism's "suspended anacoluthon."4 Such ironic disruptions of the reading's narrative turn bland historical statements like de Man's happy assurance that '[symbolism's] greatest period still lies ahead in the future," into far more difficult and unsettling propositions like "the future lies ahead in the past. " In more general and theoretical terms, this means that any history of symbolism that conceives its object solely on the basis of a narrative articula- tion of past, present, and future, without taking into account the disruptive potential of the linguistic structure of the symbol, could only be considered a flight from actual history because a flight from what actually occurs in the symbol. What does in fact "lie ahead" in a "future" that can now be termed textual-because it is already "past," that is, written out for us to read-are the readings that, like those of Baudelaire, Mallarme, Valery, and others, serve to bear this out. Without the patient assistance and benevolent prodding of Liliane Greene, this issue of Yale French Studies would have been historical in only the most anecdotal of senses-and I am happy to recognize my debt to her. I am also very grateful to Patricia de Man for making "The Double Aspect of Symbolism" available for publication here.
