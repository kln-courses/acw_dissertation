<plain_text><page sequence="1">PLUS CA CHANGE....F E A U R E Hostile Edges: A Thesis in Visual Design by Debra H. Kruse, Rhode Island School of Design [With this article, the editors would like to applaud the work of a fellow ARLIS/NA member who has recently received a Master of Pine Arts de gree in painting while working as an art library professional. It is hoped that we might publish similar works of other members in the future.] Abstract Hostile Edges explains my involvement in the painting pro cess. In four parts, this paper examines the physical site of paint ing, the implication of its boundaries, the cold war as it relates to domestic imagery, and some contradictory aspects of painting as it applies to my work. The eight paintings that comprise my visual thesis work are then discussed. These are illustrated on pages 34-37. Introduction Painting has obvious conventions and what separates it from more advanced means of depiction is exactly what makes paint ing still viable: painting maintains the boundaries of physical matter. Its very nature celebrates the fact that there is still a phys ical mass, designated by surfaces and defined by edges. A paint ing has physical limits because its edges are in real space; the edges are manifestly present and essential to the uniqueness of form. Even when pamting is at its most minimal, it defines a re lationship between a subject and an object, played out on the physical site of painting. This physical site is also an existential one?it is bound by the activity that is inherent in its creation. Painting is all boundaries, broken or maintained, existential and often metaphorical. Physical matter begins and ends at spe cific points on the surface. Painting defines itself during the ma nipulation of material. This is the basic convention of painting ?the hand moves the tool that moves the paint along the plane to form a surface. This process is limiting, and I use this limita tion as a visual device to emphasize the painted edges as they define form. This scaled relationship between the exaggerated ex panse of the surface and the tiny edge creates its own working boundary. Linear elements, color shifts, and stopping the strokes before they come to the end of the panel creates a visual and cor poreal awareness. Parti Rivers have natural boundaries that assert themselves over time. The older the river the greater the spread between its banks ?wide and slow vs. deep and fast. I find this could serve as a metaphor for my work. Having grown up on the Mississippi River, at one of its widest and slowest points where the river is actually traveling east to west, the image of the river appears comfortable and seemingly appropriate. Like the river, my paint ings are getting wider and slower but also more thoughtful and deliberate. The edges of my paintings are expanding but always present by defining the images contained. Physical and psychological boundaries are a device, the line in the sand that is drawn with each personal encounter. These de marcations are simultaneously self-defined and other-imposed, both internal and external, acknowledged and denied. My work is about these boundaries and the limits they set. My paintings represent the minute fissure between what I perceive and my subsequent response to that perception. This fissure is an irritant, it is all the stimuli affecting me as an artist giving form to some thing very small but with the meaningful potential of a pearl. My paintings are my skin, my field. The surfaces of my paint ings are necessarily hard, sometimes transparent, alternately coarse and polished. The paintings consist of many nourishing layers. These layers are what make life possible. They are my means to order and communicate feelings that I cannot express verbally. In this field, I develop a potential relationship with the viewer. The viewer has the responsibility of reinforcing the ex ternal limits that are essential for internal creation. The viewer is invited and seduced, and must declare or decline the interaction. Painting provides physical and intellectual pleasure for me: the act of painting serves as a conduit. Imagery collides, infor mation moves along tripping the breaker, jumping the narrative from panel to panel. A narrative is set up, using images that relay information in patterns that will either engage or dismiss. Paint ing is skin's surrogate, it is my surrogate. I can say without hes itation that painting is the most difficult thing that I do. The de ficiencies that I face, and the hardships that I choose, force me to confront myself in a different, more personal way. The process is never clear. Louise Bourgeois offers this caveat, justifying the creative act as having precedent over modifying text: An artist's words are always to be taken cautiously. The finished work is often a stranger to, and sometimes very much at odds with what the artist felt or wished to express when he began. At best the artist does what he can, rather than what he wants to do. After the battle is over and the damage faced up to, the result may be surprisingly dull?but sometimes it is surprisingly interesting. The mountain brought forth a 32 Art Documentation ?

Asked to enlighten us on their creative process, both would be embarrassed, and probably uninterested. The artist who dis cusses the so-called meaning of his work is usually describing a literary side issue. The core of his original impulse is to be found, if at all, in the work itself.1 Part II In subtle ways, the cold war was more of a defining influence on middle-class attitudes than either world war. It legislated a sys tem of propaganda that permeated the soul of every school-age kid in the 1960s. The code of ethics determined social worth, suc cessfully turning the United States into a Boy Scout camp for pre paredness training. Even more consequential than the self-mon itored exercises in survival was the assumption that every good citizen would answer the civil defense plea for dedicated in volvement, regardless of the fact it was based on deceit, myth making, and illusion.2 The cause was public; no personal doubt was tolerated. Like obedient sheep, every capable family built a bomb shelter or accepted the fact that it was taking a risk that it might be expended. It was understood that disregarding the di rectives was synonymous with treason and if you could not boast the safety of a family shelter, you could still adopt sanctioned ac tivities like hoarding food and other survival necessities. We were fighting a fictitious war in our homes that relied on gullibility, good intentions, and denial. Food was hoarded at our house with a vengeance and it served as a prop to galvanize our family. Reinforced by my parent's De pression generation proclivity for saving everything because it may be useful one day and because it was immoral to do otherwise, we hoarded foodstuffs and trash and all other wasted commodi ties out of habit and principle. Since replaced by the recycling fren zy, it was an activity and a tool, a means to function within a pre scribed structure. My midwestern German Catholic upbringing had a means to assert itself. All resulted in a smug greediness and the dismissal of those grasshoppers that had neither the gumption nor the wherewithal to do as we ants did. Simultaneously good for establishing my parents' self-esteem and their place in the com munity, it was sublimation for what we really craved, the love and approval from each other. It was pie-related. So, I use food pictures as my props to represent the physical and emotional trappings of an era that defined my childhood. I will never forget the horror I felt the day my parents moved and I found myself packing twenty-year old candy and Sanka coffee cans. We had been living a pop art nightmare. Like Andy Warhol, my parents believed in salvage and storage of the material ob jects that fall somewhere between commodity and trash. Andy Warhol did not want to leave leftovers.3 My paintings contain the psychological leftovers along with the anxiety and hostility of disillusionment. I visualize the effort that went for nothing pur poseful except an admiration for hardy self-organization. It is funny and sad because food, while basic, represents many dif ferent needs and desires beyond sustenance, and it brought my family right to the scary edge of domestic distraction. It was not what we consumed, but the act of saving that was vital. My paint ings allow nothing leftover either. I am painting the images between the objects, salvaging picto rial scrap and rearranging material fragments to create some thing purposeful in itself. The leftovers determine their own fate: they function like signals and buoys. Anthropomorphic objects have inherited the role of earlier menus. Mundane in their ori gins, these images are now occupying places on the surface of the painting. What was driven internally by emotionally condi tioned remnants from my past has migrated to recognizable form. These forms have connotations peculiar to themselves that be come relational when strung along in a narrative fashion. They have character. The figurative elements in my paintings are more complex, but props all the same. These elements represent my personal ob servations and interpretations of similar disillusionment as ex perienced in childhood, but now without the irrational distance. The images are slightly raw and like the river, leaking from the edges, slowly seeping out. No longer do I believe that painting needs a theme. It materializes as the images mature. Any object or element represented deserves the special treatment of a precious object until the novelty wears off. My paintings are meant to offer delight as well as consternation because they embrace the il lustrative, abandoning more high-minded and formal modernist painting issues. They are designed to be irritating in a stylish and satisfying way. Part III My paintings are large. The expanse of the surface is paramount. It must be vast and rigid with very hard edges, it must be resis tant. Multiple paneled surfaces offer the luxury of contiguous space and the repeating boundaries act like extremities to be ex plored. Built-up images, collaged layers and erased lines are the nervous system of the painting. The working of my tools both dis turbs and refines the surface. There is genuine value for me in using non-artistic materials like plywood and commercial paint: everyday materials depict everyday subjects, but in the process they transcend the usual properties and values associated with those materials. The material choices support my pictorial choic es. I use the unrefined edges of the panel to flaunt these choices, the same way I use line carelessly to counter my personal mark. Line is fundamental to how the scale of an image is perceived. This is reiterated in the proportion of line to the volume. Line functions as a subordinate edge that defines shapes and provides transitions; it is the smallest element with the greatest signifi cance, converse to the space that it occupies. Like the punctua tion in a paragraph, it has the potential to clarify or cloud the meaning of a phrase. My paintings tend to be conceived in groups of three. There is always a serial aspect to each individual piece, suggesting a lin ear narrative or story unfolding. I believe it true that the most chal lenging contemporary work is illustrative. Any narrative, how ever, is non-progressive. Signs point to possible meaning, but the connections are not discernible and contradictions are allowed to remain.4 Images are presented, but the logic is elusive. This dis parity creates tension that is disturbing because it challenges the conventional structures of modernism. Using domestic imagery and interior space as points of depar ture, each successive painting becomes more readable, simulta neously tender and dangerous. I suspect this is because the more recent paintings deal with living issues vs remembered states. Like anything still forming, it is not always clear where the im Volume 19, Number 1 ? 2000 ?

Indecision and hesitation is important to the creation of my work. My paintings are pro nouncements made, then retracted. I restrain myself from being too definite too soon, and from painting out the revisions them selves. All contribute to the layers and the ruptures of the surface, in keeping with the search for the right mark, the right line, or the right physical edge as each painting asserts itself. Part IV In the first group of paintings, From the Cold War Backyard, From the Cold War Bistro and From the Cold War Linen Collection (see Figs.1-3), I generated ornamental patterns that served as structures. This included a diamond motif that could be read as quilting, smocking, or a chain-link fence. The grid pattern was a useful device, reinforcing the two-dimensional quality of the surface and successful, I believe, because of its numerous connotations, all relative to the home. In In the Cold War Backyard, I layered the surface using collage in a way that forces the viewer to look more closely to see if the marks were painted or found. The whispery printed papers used were transparent and had physical properties that were sub stantial enough to hold the surface. These angular repetitions criss-cross the painting, substituting pattern for plasticity. This manipulation was the direct result of discovering that a putty knife is a great tool, and especially that I could use it with gesso, troweling the lumpy surface like a finishing-mason. Painting on a rigid surface also means that I can work verti cally, with my back to the world and at ease with the fact that I am not painting from observation. For the first time, I found I was manipulating the painting with my whole arm, finding my way intuitively across the surface and responding to the material in front of me. I felt both reckless and in control. It was possible to paint what I could not articulate, and what could not be painted successfully was edited out like graffiti in an overpass. The putty knives also solved brush-related problems because they left edges sharp as razors, edges that I could keep or obliterate. The first food picture painting, From the Cold War Bistro, is most ly done in black gesso with servings of various prepared dishes cut from cooking magazines, collaged and arranged spatially in somewhat traditional foreground, middleground, and background planes. The paint is both chalky and metallic, combined with graphite, steel and tacks. The hardware is physically driven into the panel, then redrawn to address real and implied illusion. Formally, the repetition of vertical lines has a scissored or slashed look, emphasizing the edges, creating a folded effect. Combined with a successive layer of plates, the illusion of space becomes more exaggerated than flat. It can be read symbolically as a metaphor of desire for over wrought/ wrought-over food, but it is also more literal than that. It is about transcending the subject and the pleasure of painting and drawing, asserting my hand to alter the food pictures. It en abled me to transcend a significant aspect of my childhood, a sig nificant part of my past. From the Cold War Linen Collection begins with the idea that there are few things more disappointing than an inviting bed wrapped with barbed wire. The painting was not about the sub version of fencing material wrapping a bed like a package, but about the illusion of security. The viewer is beckoned, only to find that things are not as safe or restful as they first appeared ? the suggestive comfort might even be impossible. Perceived se curity is false not only because it looks a certain convincing way, but because we are fooled by our own neediness, our desire to be lieve the lies we grew up with. The second group of paintings, consisting of Olympia, Ewe R Pathetic and Hawaiian Wedding Song (see Figs. 4-6), incorporates figures. Olympia is a response to studying art history from the perspective of a visual artist. The figure objectified in my work represents Manet's Olympia, upside down and under a table, ad miring her bracelet. She is disconnected, even oblivious to our watching and judging. Carved near the top are the words FUCK CT-a reference to Cy Twombly's interpretation of Manet's paint ing that includes a carefully scribbled FUCK OLYMPIA as a vi sual pun.5 My intention was to bring it full circle, to make a paint ing about Olympia's act of dismissal, her assertiveness being superior to any other assignation. Ewe R Pathetic has a large area of shredded newspaper repre senting the wool of a sheep whose gaze meets that of the viewer head on. The sheep is a cute but unglamorous creature made of common recycled material. The gravestone inscription on the right is a warning to the viewer. The words are taken from a 1990 essay written by Ralph Rugoff that explains how it is okay, even sublime, to be hostile, to devalue tradition and to deflate expec tations. Mastery is not everything, things are never as they seem, they are in fact pathetic. Robert Storr quotes the following by Rugoff in an article on the artist Richard Tuttle: Whenever failure to successfully conform can be attribut ed to a lack of mastery and self-control, to a laughable pow erlessness, that behavior is in danger of being labeled pa thetic. To be pathetic, in other words, to be a loser, haplessly falling short of the idealized norm. Art, which embraces the pathetic voluntarily, wallows in this embarrassing territory. While all art risks failing, pathetic art makes failure its medium.6 I am intrigued by the idea of making successful paintings about disappointment. I think this is what the avant-garde was about in its original Dada form. Art that in some fashion confounds or disappoints, the way the pathetic as a gesture potentially disap points modernist expectations. The contradiction in itself sup ports a sort of prickle in the garden of how a good painting should be and raises the question of how a painting achieves its end. The viewer often feels this is a hostile act. I see failure as feared bacteria and like bacteria, this fear re quires the precautions of a vaccine, which good painting hap pily provides. The act of vaccination enables antibodied resis tance, the failure builds an edge, albeit hostile, that almost superstitiously keeps us safe from becoming truly pathetic. Of course, this is fictive, the tone being light and sweetly rendered -but emotional management is never truly successful. The lies grow exponentially, beginning with our own inherited false hoods, but we feel safe from slipping lower than what we claim as deliberate. Hawaiian Wedding Song is about parts of the whole, about parts that do not work and how that can bring us to unwitting despair. I am again utilizing the diamond pattern, but as figurative back ground and not an abstracted object. The subject is a pair of legs 38 Art Documentotion ? Volume 19, Number 1 ? 2000</page><page sequence="8">representing a figure that is centered front and split down the middle. The painting is calling attention to the formal and con ventional taboo of orienting an image symmetrically, the last thing correct formal composition advocates. Instead, it empha sizes the awkwardness of tentative balance, asserting that a por tion of a torso is nearly as good as the whole. And there are only nine toes. It is as awkward as life and frigid with contradictory restraint because the edges are simultaneously separating the image while holding it in place. In the last two paintings, The Life You Save May Be Your Own and Peafowl (see Figs. 7-8), complexity has increased as di mensions have expanded. I believe this is a result of making the images do more than hold a shape in space. I continue to be concerned with the connections and the edges between ob jects organized in a structured and logical way. It is the break ing down of the logic, the irrationality of the picture that clues in the more suspicious. Once again, things are not exactly as they appear. The Life You Save May Be Your Own is a symmetrically con structed landscape that incorporates a figure and a series of ob jects. Like most of my paintings, it is very formal and planned: the idea was tangible before the images actually emerged in paint. This is evident in the structure that places the figure and the ob jects on what is a deliberately flat and uneventful picture plane. That the painting is not black and recessive as in the earlier work, but an interior space surrounding exterior space, is mostly irrel evant. Only the objects invested with anthropomorphic quali ties have a place in these paintings, lest the painting become more like an object study in a still life. To keep things unified, the entire surface is worked obses sively, which provides both structure and atmosphere. I think the paintings have an element of poise. There is a tension be tween the mundane imagery and the unstable physicality of the material. The gold (brass) leaf is a counterpoint to the panels that are warped, the edges that are exposed and the paint that is not very permanent. The solidity of the forms is waiting to dissolve into figure/ground, or disappear altogether. This painting is a testimony to the personal choices executed publicly, to the ges tures that by themselves are meaningless but lethal in a partic ular context. It is like lighting a single match that will blow up the town if the wind is right. It is the inversion, the subversion that compels me. Peafowl is about the articulation of minor, supporting elements. It depicts fancy bird figures, which have become living remnants on a gilded scullery perch. Again, the use of pattern in addition to metal leaf is necessary because it transforms the painted sur face into something else, something more elegant than the actu al birds. It is the negation of a romanticized image. It is a varia tion on the painted out toe. Conclusion My intentions have been to explore contradictory aspects of painting, as I believe they apply to my work. Homogenization in the art of painting is easier to assimilate, but as long as the ques tion of relevancy for painting continues to shuffle back and forth, I would rather take a closer look at the act of painting itself than sacrifice it entirely for the sake of some perceived progress. Paint ing needs an advocate that can see and work through the anachro nistic properties of a slow and impractical pace. Painting should be savored on the basis of its tactility and nonvirtuality.7 The whole idea of progress in painting is artificial because superfi cial modifications achieve nothing but call attention to the fact that something has been altered. Yet, painting must reflect its time and the artist's own reality. It is like changing the sell/use-by date on a milk carton: the milk has not been revitalized, but it means we do not have to throw it out, at least according to the new date. It is evidence of dys function. The very nature of painting has shifted only because our expectations have shifted. We are jaded and dysfunctional, lacking concrete evidence because there is too much virtual in formation to struggle with. This is why content and form can never again be separated like cream in a modernist dairy. My struggle is no longer a cold war without content. It is a person al struggle about painting's relevance and my mortality. The paintings are real, not artificial; they do have hostile edges. &lt;?&gt; Notes 1.
