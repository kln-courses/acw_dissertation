GEUTHNER, 1931. 36 plates; 206 pp. Compiled through a number of years, and limited to the phe- nomena of a particular locale, the typical central China city of Anking, this fresh investigation of China's temples and their re- lated cults possesses unusual value. The introduction and the succeeding chapter provide a general discussion of some funda- mental aspects of Chinese religions, for which the subsequent six chapters, each dealing with a special class of temples determined by the cult, adduce a wealth of detail. A comprehensive list of Chinese sources appears in the Index. The omission of the notable publications of RI. Maspero and M. Granet from the bibliography of Western authorities, is doubtless accounted for by the evident completion of the manuscript prior to the appearance in 1927 and 1929 of the definitive works of these sinologists. Dr. Shryock's monograph suggests a possible revaluation of the traditional attitude towards Chinese religious practices. Is it necessarily true, for example, that the Chinese reveal in the multi- tude of their canonized personages a clear-cut polytheism (p. 17) ? It has been customary to stigmatize the euhemeristic hierarchy of Chinese cults as "gods" and their iconographical representations as " idols ". But many of these, aside from the purely local tute- lary deities, such as the Hsieh Chi (She Chi, p. 129, " Spirits of the Land and Grain"), the Ho Shen (Huo Shen, p. 121, "Fire God"), and the T'u Ti (p. 129, "Earth Gods"), reflect fairly faithfully the r6les of the " saints " of the Western calendar. Apart from certain primitive and perhaps animistic concepts of earliest China, the divinities of popular worship as revealed in the temples of Anking, are the heroes of Chinese legend and more frequently frankly historical personages. These have been adopted as " patron saints " by special groups, whether gilds or larger con- gregations. Anthropomorphism has been no more characteristic of the Chinese than with ourselves (p. 11). The Chinese " Trinity ", the Three Holy Ones, San Shen (San Sheng, pp. 131 f.), Confucius (or Kuan-ti), Lao Tzui and Fo (Buddha), actually if not by official prescription, points to a popularly syncretized monotheism,</page><page sequence="2">Gale, The Temples of Anking and Their (CuIts 99 for the worship of Shang-ti was reserved as an Imperial ceremonial (p. 17). The rites associated with ancestor worship, a traditionally con- troversial question (p. 57), are especially well exemplified in the Anking temples (chap.: Ancestral Temples). Dr. Shryock is convinced that ancestor worship is a religious observance "because the same rite is used in the worship of unquestioned gods like Shang Ti". Yet it is conceivable that such rites differ only in elaboration rather than in principle from our own gestures of respect at the graves of our dead. The distinction throughout would appear to be that the Chinese have retained what the earlier Mediterranean world held, sharply rationalized concepts (cf. the conclamatio and chao hun). Dr. Shryock has added valuable material from the district Chih, " gazetteer ", which especially since the Ming era has provided local records for every region of the Empire. The Huailing (Iluai-ning) hsien chih, the latest edition published in 1915 (p. 26), has been drawn upon for historical data and statistical material, and for essays on temples and divinities. The variety of information con- tained in this work, which to be sure requires critical treatment,. is indicated in the table of contents (Appendix 2). The volume emphasizes the technical difficulties as yet en- countered in the publication of scientific sinological treatises in this country, when as a rule the author's text must be handled by a European press (cf. Ch'u Hou Chieh, p. 118, Shu Shih Chang, p. 18). Errors in transcription are not so readily explainable, al- though deviations from the accepted transliterations of many words may be accounted for by the local dialect of mandarin of Anhui (p. 23). But even so, there is a noticeable lack of uniformity in many cases, while obvious distinctions are not observed. For ex- ample, Shen (spirit) and sheng (saint) are uniformly rendered shen; t'an (altar) and tgang (hall) are both t'an; these are scarcely excusable. Chuang Yuen (literary optimus, p. 58 et al.) appears as Chuan Yuen, with another character of the same pho- nology, rendered as Chuang immediately following the former in the Index (p. 196). The reader conversant with Chinese, is how- ever, not dependent on such faulty romanization, for there is a generous insertion of the corresponding characters in the Ap- pendices and the excellent Index. Titles of reign eras (nien hao)</page><page sequence="3">100 Reviews of Books are occasionally given as the names of dynastic rulers (p. 132). Photographs enable the reader to visualize much of the textual material, while vivid and sympathetic eye-witness descriptions of the temples and principal festivals (pp. 69, 83, 105), as well as several translations from Chinese texts and monuments (pp. 48, 51), lend color to the narrative.
