DiCenso, Kant's Religion within the Boundaries of Mere Reason: A Commentary Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK, 2012, 269 pp., US$99.00 (hb) Pablo Muchnik Received: 27 January 2013 / Accepted: 30 January 2013 / Published online: 15 February 2013 © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2013 Immanuel Kant's Religion within the Boundaries of Mere Reason (1793) is a formi dably difficult book, which since its very inception was ripe for controversy. Part of the difficulty in understanding Kant's text is thematic: in the idea of God and the ques tions surrounding faith in God's existence, all interests of reason seem to converge— metaphysics, epistemology, morality, politics, the purposiveness of nature, and the destiny of the human species all unite in Kant's view of religion and give it a distinc tive polyphonic tone. Part of the difficulty is ideological: Kant's treatment of religious matters—relying on the assumption that a rational a priori core (identical to the prin ciples of his morality) underlies and shapes all historical revelations—distances itself from both dogmatism and atheism. Those who accept religious orthodoxy, no less than those who are committed to a purely secular view of human affairs, are doomed to be displeased with the ambiguities of Kant's approach, which preserves religion but subverts the meaning of this term so drastically as to make it unrecognizable in its traditional understanding. James DiCenso's Commentary, "the first complete English language commentary on the work" (according to the dust-jacket), is thus a daring philosophical undertaking: it required not only comprehensive knowledge of Kant's corpus, but also the intellectual versatility to appreciate Kant's innovative view. It may seem odd that, after more than two centuries of Kantian scholarship, only now does a full-length commentary appear of a book that, in DiCenso's words, "stands alongside Spinoza's Theological-Political Treatise (1670) and Hume's Natural His tory of Religion (1757) and Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion (1779) as a key work analyzing religious beliefs and institutions in terms of their impact on human affairs" (p. 1). The fact is that, until fairly recently, Kant's Religion was a virtually neglected work in the Anglophone world. The first signs of a change appeared in the P.

Since then, there have been a slew of publications on radical evil and the ethical community (the themes of the first and third parts of Religion), but few attempts, by a single author, to make sense of the book as a whole. DiCenso's Commentary redresses this situation: after a general historical introduction, it contains a chapter dealing with Kant's prefaces and each part of Religion, including Kant's polemical discussion of Jesus as a moral ideal (Urbild) (in part two) and of the counterfeit service to God (Afterdienst) (in part four), which are often overlooked in the secondary literature. The prevalent piecemeal approach to Religion is perhaps a remnant of the circum stances of its publication in 1793. After the appearance of the first essay on radical evil a year earlier in the Berlinische Monatsschrift, the conservative authorities at the time prohibited Kant from publishing its sequel, the essay entitled "Concerning the Struggle of the Good with the Evil Principle for the Dominion over the Human Being" (1793). This piece, which later became part two of Religion, contained Kant's con troversial interpretation of Jesus as a figure whose historical reality was relevant only to the extent that he instantiated "an idea that has complete reality within [reason] itself" (6:62). DiCenso tells the story of how Kant outmaneuvered his censors: after the ban, he withdrew the essay from the journal, and, along with the published piece on radical evil and two other essays (the extant parts one, three and four of Religion), joined them together into a single volume. This he successfully submitted for approval through the philosophical rather than the theological faculty, defying the ban of the minister of culture, the ultra-conservative Johann Christoph Wöllner. Kant dignified his sly strategy in the first introduction of the book by arguing for the independence of a strictly philosophical engagement with Scripture, to be kept separate from theological concerns (6:8-9). One of the strengths of the Commentary is to have shown how the theme of cen sorship plays itself out throughout Kant's text. DiCenso finds traces of it in numerous passages where Kant defends the non-coercive nature of faith and the contribution of religion towards eternal peace and the general goals of the Enlightenment. In this connection, DiCenso's discussion of the effects of the predisposition to the good in parts two and three of Religion is particularly lucid. Drawing from various sources in the Kantian corpus, he builds a systematic link between Kant's account of rational reli gion and the politico/ethical effects of freedom in the public use reason. Curiously, this progressive dimension of Kant's view escaped many of his contemporaries.2 Goethe, 1 Thanks to John Silber's influential essay. "The Ethical Significance of Kant's Religion" (1960), which, along with Allen Wood's pioneering book, Kant's Moral Religion ( 1970), became landmarks in the literature. 2 DiCenso's Commentary, unfortunately, does not deal with the immediate reception of Kant's book, nor does it discuss the influences and sources that helped shape it. A sense of this larger cultural context, mostly unknown to contemporary readers, would have been important to better understand Kant's view. £) Springer</page><page sequence="3">Int J Philos Relig (2013) 73:151-155 153 for instance, saw Kant's turn to religion as a "stain" in his critical philosophy, a back handed way to reintroduce talk of God after having banished it in the first Critique? We still feel the ripples of this rebuke. Contemporary scholarship falls, roughly, into two major camps: those who take Kant's religious references at face value and try to reconcile critical philosophy with traditional Christianity, and those who interpret Kant's references as metaphors and insist on reducing religion to morality.4 DiCenso's sympathies primarily lie with the second camp, but he refuses to consider Kantian religion as mere window-dressing, as a ladder to be thrown away once we have climbed into the realm of ends.5 For him, Kant's treatment of religious doctrines and images is not merely consonant with the basic principles of Kant's epistemology and morality, but indispensable in the process of applying those pure a priori principles to empirical conditions of human existence. Seen in this light, Religion is a major contribution to the field of Kant's impure ethics—that elusive second part of Kant's morality, which deals with the subjective anthropological conditions that hinder or help us in fulfilling the commands of the categorical imperative.6 There should be no surprise about DiCenso's sensitivity to the political underpin nings of the Kantian view: the Commentary comes in the wake of his recently published Kant, Religion and Politics (2011). This proximity, both thematic and temporal, is a mixed blessing. In the current piece, there is hardly any discussion of the relative merits of the non-secularist line of interpretation, and little attention is paid to those passages where Kant seems to embrace a transcendent/Augustinian understanding of grace and divine assistance. Most of the references in the Commentary are intramural, dependent on DiCenso's prior work, to which he frequently shifts the burden of argumentation. This insularity combines with the attempt to produce a commentary that mirrors the movements of Kant's text so exactly that at times it replicates the imperfections of the original. This is particularly evident in chapter 3, devoted to Kant's doctrine of radical evil. Here DiCenso's analysis reproduces Kant's own fragmentary treatment of this notion in part one of Religion. More importantly, the Commentary eschews the toughest problems of interpretation: the a priori pretentions of Kant's claim that the human being is evil by nature and the consequent need of a transcendental deduc tion; the relation between dispositions, propensities to evil, and predispositions to the good; the "evil" of giving primacy to self-love in one's moral outlook; and the relation between Kant's ethics and philosophy of history. DiCenso is committed to a "textually 3 See Goethe's letter to Herder (June 7, 1793), quoted by Emil Fackenheim, "Kant and Radical Evil" (1954). 4 Chris Firestone and Nathan Jacobs, In Defense of Kant's Religion (2008) is a good example of the first camp; Allen Wood, Kant's Rational Theology (2009) is illustrative of the second. 5 DiCenso considers the realm of ends in the Groundwork as interchangeable with the ethical community in Religion. I find this assimilation objectionable, not simply on a textual basis (there is no mention of God in the Groundwork's account), but, more importantly, because it leads one to downplay the public dimension that God acquires in Kant's doctrine of the highest good as a result of the social dynamics of radical evil. I develop this view in "Kant's Religious Constructivism," in The Critical Companion to Religion within the Boundaries of Mere Reason (forthcoming). 6 See MS 6:217. Robert Louden is perhaps the most articulate exponent of this part of Kant's thought. See Kant's Impure Ethics: From Rational Beings to Human Beings (2000) and his more recent Kant's Human Being: Essays on His Theory of Human Nature (2011). *0 Springer</page><page sequence="4">154 Int J Philos Relig (2013) 73:151-155 grounded analysis of Religion that will help clarify many of its obscure passages and correct many of the misinterpretations that have afflicted its reception for generations" (p. 23). But as much as I value this close-reading methodology, the commentary would have benefitted, at times, from a healthy distance from the text in order to avoid repro ducing Kant's often meandrous arguments, and offer a hermeneutical key to interpret how the four parts of Religion hang together—if not at the beginning, at least in a retrospective glance at the conclusion. Such a synthesis never comes: the Commentary ends as abruptly as Kant's General Remark in part four. This is disappointing. Here one would have expected DiCenso to cash out the holism that informed his reading throughout the text. Let me briefly reconstruct it. For DiCenso, the key to understanding the unity of Religion lies in Kant's biblical hermeneutics—itself a corollary of the simultaneously internal and external dimension of his ethics. According to this reading, the individual's acquisi tion of a good disposition (Gesinnung) must be accompanied by the transformation of social institutions "in the direction of greater justice, equality, and transparency" (p. 18). Social transformation is important, because institutions give sensual represen tation to abstract ideas like the moral law, and thus facilitate—or obstruct—our ethical self-understanding and reflection. In the case of religious institutions and images, the representations in question are analogical or symbolic, not direct or literal. In support of this view, DiCenso turns to the third Critique (written immediately prior to Reli gion), where Kant distinguishes between schemata and symbols—"the first of which contains direct, the second indirect presentations (Darstellungen) of the concept" (KU 5:352). While schemata require sensible intuition to which the understanding applies a concept, symbols give expression to ideas for which there is no intuition. For Kant, "all our cognition of God is merely symbolic" (KU 5:353), and hence cannot possibly yield any constitutive knowledge of God as a supersensible object. This conclusion, DiCenso notes, not only aligns with Kant's treatment of regulative ideas in Dialectic of the Critique of Pure Reason (1781 ), but also dovetails with Kant's distinction between a schematism of analogy and a schematism of object-determination in Religion (6:65 n.), and their correlatives, reflective and dogmatic faith. DiCenso's emphasis on schematism "recognizes that we are embodied, socially formed, and fallible beings, who, despite our inherent rational capacity, are often more attuned to tactile sense-experience and to imagination than to abstract prin ciples" (p. 105). This anthropological fact DiCenso puts to work in support of his secularist reading of Religion, according to which all legitimate talk of God is always als ob, without literal or ontological reference. So construed, religious symbols and institutions can serve an essential pedagogical purpose; yet, if interpreted literally, religious representations can lead to anthropomorphism and dogmatism. This danger is unavoidable: in the process of schematization, religious symbols are liable to lose their analogical character and become objectified and literalized. The problem is that such literalism has injurious ethical consequences, for it diverts our religious endeav ors from ethical to non-ethical goals: instead of leading a good life, which is what autonomy demands and the only way to became pleasing to God, we worry about winning divine favor through ritual compliance. When this happens, "the mere means (the representation or statutory practice) is taken as an end in itself, thereby diverting us from focusing on universalizable principles" (p. 20). Radical evil, with its inversion Springer</page><page sequence="5">Int J Philos Relig (2013) 73:151-155 155 of the ethical order of priority between the ethical incentives, thus appears intimately connected with a literalist understanding of religious images and the counterfeit ser vice to God, which confuse the contingent, socially constructed representation of God with its rational/symbolic dimension. Mere cultic observance thus illustrates the mutual reinforcement of self-love and religious dogmatism. In other word, in DiCenso's Commentary, what gives unity to Kant's book is the ethical duality implicit in religious representations, along with the theory of symbolism that counteracts their heteronomous effect. The four parts of Religion—the essays on radical evil, Jesus, the ethical community, and the spurious relation to God—are united by Kant's preoccupation with the cultural effects of religious symbols and their ethical implications. Since "we form our sense of identity and self-worth largely in relation with others and under the tutelage of shared institutions" (p. 132), Kant teaches us how to be on our guard against the negative influences of religious literalism, and how to use pure practical reason to advance in our struggle towards virtue. I find this line of thought provocative and insightful-—I just regret that DiCenso did not more forcefully return to it at the end of his Commentary. Be this as it may, in its pages one finds a new, comprehensive interpretation of Kant's difficult book—a fact that alone will raise the bar for future scholarly discussions, and for which we should all be grateful.
