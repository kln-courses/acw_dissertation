<plain_text><page sequence="1">Surgimiento del Esado en Egipto: cambios y continuidades en lo ideologico. By Marcelo Campagno. Buenos Aires: 1998 (= Coleccion Estudios, Nueva Serie 6 [Instituto de Historia Antigua Oriental Dr. Abra- ham Rosenwasser, Facultad de Filosofia y Letras] ) . Pp. 164. The author deals with a difficult subject due to the paucity of direct sources and the risk of anachronism. Nevertheless, he approaches it from a concrete per- spective, following in-depth reflection, in an attempt to respond to questions that had already been posed by many scholars. Despite the fact that many histori- ans may not agree with either the book's premises or its conclusions, the work is interesting to read. It has its own internal coherence and is quite salient in the literature of Egyptology. What follows is a summary of its contents. Campagno begins by seeking to explain the thought categories of the ancient Egyptians, distin- guishing them from those of the Western mentality. He claims a uniqueness in the Egyptian forms of</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 223 conceiving man and the universe, and underscores some essential aspects in their thought: a static, dual, cosmos eternal since creation, where order opposes chaos. He points to their idea of entities' consubstan- tiality and polysemia. The book delves into the realm of ideology, at- tempting to analyze the effects of the emergence of the State, although this does not always prove to be a simple task. From the start, the author acknowl- edges that the Egyptians did not even have a specific word to designate the State, because all of the mean- ingful aspects of that word revolved around the pharaoh himself, the source of authority and power. On this basis, the author focuses on what he terms "State practice," i.e., following Weber, "the legitimate monopoly of the means of force," with two opposing poles, namely, the one that dominates and another that subordinates the first. In its geographical scope, the book encompasses the Nile Valley and Delta, the Western Oases, the Red Sea, the wadis, the Syrian-Palestinian coast, and the Nubian region. Its chronological span begins in the fifth millennium and ends with the first third of the third millennium B.C., in other words, from the beginning of the Predynastic Period to the end of Dynasty II. The difficulty in finding State practice in Egypt's origins becomes more complicated when searching for evidence. The author recognizes this and turns to archaeology, mainly to cemeteries, focusing on burial practices and funerary furniture. From his analysis he deduces that from the pre-State period there was a belief in an afterlife that would be similar to life prior to death, and that there were deities who ruled the world. In what terms did the human community express itself in a pre-State period? Indications are that "king- ship" was the predominant practice, and that it ex- pressed criteria of belonging (family) or exclusion (non-family), of production units, of exchange, of models of activity, etc. In Egypt, cemeteries repre- sented the right of the community to control the surrounding land, a right legitimized by the fact of descending from common ancestors buried in the town cemetery. Badari, Armant, and Nagada all had cemeteries that were differentiated according to the funerary furniture, which may reflect the existence of clan groups. The similarity between tombs and houses may indicate that the dead received the same treatment as the living, thereby nullifying the differ- ences between them. State practice roughly emerges in Egypt in the fourth millennium B.C., and the author deals with this issue in the book's second chapter. Links between different communities are forged by means of wars of conquest. These are struggles where the victors took over the land of the defeated, a process which led to the creation of connections between hitherto unre- lated parties, with dominators and dominated. In Nagada there is evidence of wars waged in an attempt to control trading networks and gold mines. Never- theless there is nothing to prevent one from believing the State practice had emerged in different regions of the Nile more or less simultaneously. As a result, the expansion of State practice, beginning in Dynasty I, led to the formation of a single state from the First Cataract to the Mediterranean Sea. Soon the State, intimately linked to the figure of the pharaoh, took over the practice of war exclusively in order to impose its will. It also introduced taxa- tion as well as large scale construction projects which had been previously unknown. New urban centers were founded, a calendar was established, writing was used. Thus, the State monopolized, regulated, trans- formed and interfered with contacts with the outside world by exercising control of prestige goods and raw materials. The third chapter centers on kings and gods and the close links between them. Kings were divine from the moment of their accession, and were entrusted with the task of maintaining the established order. Pharaoh was legislator, judge, warrior, priest: Maat's guarantor, and, therefore, essential in Egypt. Gods were ascribed with attributes of royalty. They under- went anthropomorphism, a process that could only occur in a society within a State. The emerging State led to an overall religion and to State worship which could live side by side with local religions. But the deepest mark left by ritual practices in the State era was the funerary activity which was embodied in the construction of monumental tombs for the royals and members of the elite. In the ensuing pages, Campagno contends that in the State era communities still had a place for kin- ship, where the elders played a key role as town coun- selors and representatives before the State. There was a "community solidarity ... of mutual support," which proved to be entirely compatible with State practice. The latter, for its part, manifested itself in the realm of funerals through royal cemeteries, particularly in royal iconography through the use of military and hierarchical images as well as of monumental statues and the command of writing. In sum, the king-god appears as the highest expression of a State that had constituted itself as the absolute focal point of society, as the sine qua non for the continuity of life on the banks of the Nile. A society based on kingship gave way to one dominated by State practice, becoming an</page><page sequence="3">224 JARCE XXXVII (2000) unprecedented phenomenon.
