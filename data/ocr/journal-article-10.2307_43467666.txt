<plain_text><page sequence="1">Cultural Determination of Concepts JOHN STEWART CHAPMAN in A PREVIOUS ARTICLE, "Toward a Third Position," which appeared in these pages in Summer, 1964, I wrote: If this discussion is to make sense it will at some point have to consider ul- timates as though they exist. In fact there is nothing scientific that defines an ultimate. . . . Indeed, no ultimate can undergo definition, for definition sets limits and ultimates can have no other limits than those inherent in themselves, indescribable and therefore undefinable. For science these ulti- mates are asymptotic; for theologians they are divine. For the sake of con- ciseness these ultimates - if they exist and whether or not they are divine or of some other character - I shall summarize under the symbol 6. ... It will be understood that this symbol includes not only ultimates, but also all the concepts of deity or ultimates that men have known or supposed they knew. These ultimates as employed in metaphysics transcend human capa- cities and include concepts usually embodied under the terms "theis- tic," "First Cause," and "Prime Mover unmoved." Consideration of ultimates necessarily involves the question of purpose, for in human terms it would seem ridiculous or worse that anything should happen out of a primary cause without that event's having an ultimate and definable purpose. If a flood destroys village A, but spares village B, what purpose or force controlled the flood? Is the preservation of one place and the destruction of another a random accident? Is it part of a Plan? Is it a punishment of the wicked inhabitants? Or is it a natural phenomenon explicable in terms of hydraulics, meteorology, and geographical features? But if it is a result of hydraulics, what is the source of the rules of hydraulics, and what produced a rain of just the proportions to cause a flood? At a simpler level, three hunters band together to kill a mastodon, but one of them is killed before the survivors can dispatch the beast. 80 winter 19 6 S</page><page sequence="2">Was the dead man an evil man, had he broken a taboo, or was his "medicine" not strong enough? These are the kinds of questions that belong specifically in the domain of 0. But it is not germane to the discussion at this point to ask if 0 exists. It is enough that men have thought, and think, it does, and have ascribed certain characteristics and qualities to it. Men have also rather steadily altered their concepts of 0. What this means is that while the entity of 0 at this point does not come into consideration, the concepts are empirical and can be discussed as entities. It is our purpose here to look into these concepts as men have held them at different stages of culture. It deserves stress that what men have said or thought about 0 in no way constrains 0 to fit their description, because 0 if it exists is universal and unalterable. Cultures and societies change and concepts vary; but the ultimates, if they exist in the forms in which we think of them, do not. (I had almost written "cannot" vary, but that would put a limit on omnipotence.) Not only is the variation in con- cepts evident in a longitudinal fashion as one progresses from simpler to more complex cultures, but also it will become evident, I think, that there is horizontal variation which reflects the contemporaneous but quite different concepts held by different strata of the same cul- ture. Such a description of successive changes in ideas of 0 has limita- tions. These arise from a lack of information about the earliest cul- tures of man, but also from possible misinterpretations. In anthro- pology there are time, place, language, and cultural barriers. If the translation of a French or German treatise into its exact mental equiv- alent in English is difficult, the problem is far worse if one tries to understand and relay the mode of thought of a contemporary Pueblo Indian; and conclusions become still more inexact if the reconstruc- tion of abstract concepts begins from a few residual artifacts. Paleolithic thought and concept have to be extrapolated from such findings as the cave paintings at Lascaux, pictographs found in Spain and northern Africa, and from a projection backward of the con- cepts of surviving Mesolithic or Neolithic groups. Prevailing interpre- tation holds that in this context all things animate and inanimate consisted not only of the empirical object itself, but also of an essence southwest Review 81</page><page sequence="3">which could be separated from the material instance. Of these two aspects of a thing, the immanent was by all odds the more important. Hence if one went out to kill a deer he accomplished his purpose through a preceding placation of the immanent. In practical terms these early men accomplished practical and necessary ends by ap- pealing and apologizing to the spirits of the things they were about to destroy. Apparently they regarded themselves as being only other items in this double existence, the specific and the immanent. This concept of the double nature of all things leads as well to a profound regard for the environment and the ecology. Ultimately natural law may very well have its remote origin in this respect for a nature and an environment which man, at the time, lacked equipment and skills to alter. If one may venture a guess, in the course of time it must have appeared that some essences were stronger than others, perhaps ani- mate more powerful than inanimate, and that among animate essences that of the bear, or the wolf, or the bull was stronger than that of the squirrel, the mouse, or the flea. Fleas, moreover, were nuisances and perhaps didn't have enough essence to make it worthwhile not to kill them. Views like these probably sufficed for the ordinary prob- lems of men whose subsistence derived from hunting and gathering and whose toolkits consisted of little more than chipped stones and wood or bone clubs. Views like these may well have persisted for many thousands of years, with modifications here and there as one major animal or another represented for the particular group the most significant source of sustenance or threat. Ideas also were certain to change as a result of defects in oral transmission, conflicts with other bands, and preva- lence of different kinds of natural phenomena. Undoubtedly also as bands became better defined and rules with regard to exogamy de- veloped, first one extended family and then another came to be identified with the essence of a particular animal or bird. At this point there may well be the first development of that general idea of the "we" as opposed to the "they," "the people" as opposed to "strangers," for which the word in many primitive languages is almost identical with "enemy." 82 winter 1 965</page><page sequence="4">Then came the Neolithic revolution. Certain land afforded con- sistently better gathering, and if a band were strong enough to hold the area against others a settled life might follow, thanks to wild cereal grasses, wild fruits, and a plentiful source of water. From settled life agriculture apparently developed and along with it the discovery that clay could be shaped into utensils suitable for many uses. Other bands, in a more hostile environment or perhaps not strong or large enough to wrest away the most desirable sites from others, were left to continue their nomadic existence in search of food. The first Euro- peans encountered American Indians north of the Rio Grande sub- sisting according to these modes. The Neolithic remains in the East point to a similar grouping of men. It is unnecessary to suppose that the nomadic hunters and gather- ers were less intelligent or skilled than those who had adopted the sedentary life of agriculture. Some may have come into the region late and found choice areas pre-empted; others may have clung to the more primitive way out of conservatism or fear of change. At any rate, wanderers could use no ceramic vessels because of their fragility; no more could they learn techniques of agriculture in areas where water was inadequate and soil of poor quality. In place of ceramics the nomads developed ingenious uses of hides, paunches, and bladders of their large mammalian quarry. The Comanche, for ex- ample, derived from the buffalo almost every object in his entire economy - clothing, shelter, utensils, ornaments, tools, and weapons. In this division of the society of man into two groups which occupied overlapping areas, one sees the first schism of culture; and it is a little reassuring to observe that though it may date back as much as seven thousand years, it did not prevent later syntheses from developing. In a very limited form, the same schism has persisted even in the United States down to the present time: one part of the culture urban, deriving from the original sedentary farming and ceramic culture; the other, developing from nomadic roving to herd- ing and stock breeding, and then to ranching. For, of course, if the nomadic bands found domesticable large mammals, they discovered in the course of centuries that it was easier to drive their commissary around on the hoof than to hunt it down in the wild state. And consequently wherever large mammals existed southwest Review 8 3</page><page sequence="5">that were subject to domestication the nonfarming groups began to control and ultimately to breed them. Very late in the story, the Plains Indians took over the mustangs; earlier the Incas had domesti- cated the llama (interestingly enough, the only large animal available for domestication in the Americas) ; while much earlier in the East men first hunted, then drove, and finally raised sheep, goats, and cattle. It is a record of the conflict of herdsmen in search of good pasturage and ample water with a settled urban civilization that furnishes one theme of the Old Testament. The result is not only a struggle for subsistence and hence for survival, but equally a con- flict in culture and concept. For while to both herdsmen and farmers (and to an early urban civilization dependent on farming) climatological phenomena occupy positions of overriding importance, they do so in quite different ways. For the farmer soil, sun, rain, the cycle of planting, growth, matura- tion, and harvest set the cycle of his life. The recurrent cycle was as significant to the Aztec, the Inca, and the Hopi as to the Philistine, the Babylonian, or the Sumerian, however far apart in time and space these cultures flourished. Among all these peoples, subject to modifi- cation by the climatic features of their land and the peculiarities of their crops, the theme of birth, death, and resurrection recurs. For the herdsman, the year has a different cycle - that of breed- ing, and then of lambing or calving. Water holes and springs, much more than rains or rivers from which irrigation channels may be dug, are his concern. Pasturage is no less significant, but as long as he is free to roam he may drive his herd to promising sites, the only inhibition being the presence of some other band and their animals. Beasts of prey once cherished and admired for power, strength, or cunning now become enemies of the herd and hence of the herdsman. The rain that brings on corn, millet, or emmer is chiefly a nuisance for the man or band who lives largely out-of-doors and has to hold together sheep or cattle. A storm, by the same token, though it brings rain for the crops of the farmers, only results in stampede or drown- ing for the drove of a herdsman. The same rainstorm, then, which the farmer sees as a blessing, even something to be invoked (as among the Hopi) , to the herdsman is on the contrary an expression of wrath from on high. 84 winter 1 96 S</page><page sequence="6">Since man's fundamental requirements differ so much it should not be surprising to discover that concepts of 0 differ as drastically. I have already referred to the widespread theme of death and resurrec- tion to be found among farming groups. In primitive thought it is not clear if the concept precedes personification, the other way about, or the two functions develop simultaneously, each explaining and supplementing the other. In any case, development of ritual and rep- resentation (Hopi dances, katchinas, Eastern fertility figures) seem to belong to this stage of culture. Cult figures make their debut and gradually increase in size and massiveness. In full flower the same con- cepts produce Isis-Osiris and Tammuz- Adonis. The elaboration of ritual and the production of massive cult figures ("idols") are com- patible with a sedentary existence, with free time between harvest and the next planting, but impossible for herding bands whose droves re- quire continual change of pasture. Moreover, just as the herding bands find pottery impractical, they find it impossible to carry about with them images that may weigh several hundred pounds. Without such images their concepts of 0 remain diffuse or abstract and the Power at the peaks of mountains around which storm clouds collect remains invisible when weather is clear. When He is beneficent the sun shines and the springs at the foot of escarpments and slopes are abundant. When He is angry the peaks are concealed by cloud, lightning flashes, and herds stampede. Thus among herdsmen generally one finds far less well-defined ideas of 6 than among sedentary peoples. This is no less true of the Navajo, the Comanche, and the Cheyenne than of the Hebrew tribes. For all of these the sacred places were the summits. And if, in a far more advanced culture such as that of the Homeric Greeks, one finds their gods living on mountains, it is fairly safe to speculate that the ances- tors of the people originally were herdsmen. One final theme remains for comment as civilization begins to change from Neolithic to early Bronze cultures. That theme is order. One finds it expressed among the Pawnee as a moiety of the tribe who came down from the sky to teach their brothers on the earth the proper ways to live. The idea, in one form or another, recurs in all cul- tures: some one or some people taught the tribe what they should southwest Review 8 5</page><page sequence="7">avoid and what ceremonies they should perform; how they should organize the tribe, and what the limits of relationship in marriage were. Since even the earliest association of beings able to communi- cate with each other calls for an order, this theme of order is uni- versal, though it may be thoroughly entwined with other themes. (Indeed it is so much a part of our own thinking and culture that we recognize its pre-eminence only in its violation.) In the Americas only a Chalcolithic or very early Bronze culture developed. Yet by this stage it is possible to recognize a series of modifications on the old themes. The villages had become cities and a priestly class had developed, while in politics the old simple tribal arrangement had had to be supplanted by a stronger organization. In the formation and growth of cities, the homogeneity of the tribe had long since vanished. Cities were founded on fragments and com- ponents of many tribes, each of which contributed to the new cul- ture not only its genes and muscle, but also fragments of its original concepts - the themes of storm gods of the herdsmen and of death and resurrection of the farmers, all differing in detail as each tribal ingredient of the new city contributed its load of belief. The inevita- ble result was a multiplicity of gods, none of which the most recent conqueror was quite willing to throw away. But since the idea of order in all things is so basic and since there existed a priestly class whose duty it was to know about and hence manage the deities, this group had no recourse but to set the gods in order, too. The natural inclination in an aggregate of humans in which autocratic power was being concentrated in a ruler was to establish the gods in a similar order as well. Hence in all developed mythology, Aztec, Incan, Sum- erian, or whatever, one god stands out as ruler of the others - Tez- catlipoca, Marduk, Baal, or Zeus. The processes of 0 structure for the Bronze age can very well be summarized as syncretism, accretion, and stratification in some order. It was this kind of confusion of thought, concept, and tongue the Hebrew herdsmen encountered when they entered the land of Canaan, a confusion made all the more odious to the newcomers by the division of labor, rigid political systems, and massive cult figures to outlandish gods. Perhaps as revolting as any of it was the ziggurat, an attempt to build a high place. 86 winter 19 65</page><page sequence="8">The Jewish herdsmen brought with them, perhaps from Egypt, yet another concept not at all unfamiliar to peoples of the Near East in 1200 B.c., the idea of a single deity. A vague concept-drift toward monotheism had been developing for quite a time. Two hundred years earlier Akhenaton had attempted to make such a concept official but had been defeated by the conservative priestly class. Even in theocra- cies, it seems, it is difficult to destroy an idea. Withal, "Thou shalt have no other gods before Me" is not so strong a statement as "Allah il Allah - Allah is the one true God." But a millenium and a half intervened. One may summarize the Bronze and early Iron ages by stating that they saw the development of pantheons, then of stratification within pantheons, and finally the emergence of the concept of a single deity. But as M. Weinfeld observes in the Journal of Near Eastern Studies (July, 1964), politics went hand in glove with re- ligion and in a sense one might argue that the development of the concept of a single deity was almost a necessity as one group after another piled pantheon with supreme god on top of pantheon with supreme god, as one conquest after another rolled out of the Turkish hinterland and subdued the indigenous groups. Not even a huge class of priests could finally bring order out of such deific mess, and the irresistible requirement of order demanded the ultimate simplification. The Bronze age produced another innovation, one of vast im- portance to human thought. The introduction of writing produced invariable statements. During the period of verbal transmission, modi- fication of themes occurred with great readiness - through misunder- standing, omission, deletion, and substitution. With the introduction of writing the fluid flow of man's concepts became glacial. "The Book says ..." can thus become the answer to logic or empiric observation, whether the Book carries its message in hieroglyphic, cuneiform, or Linear A. In this respect the invention of writing served to fix con- cepts of 0. Obviously there is small appeal from the written faith, or a priest's rendition of it. In these circumstances changes in concepts are more likely to result from military conquest and changes in political hegemony than from extensive reinterpretation of "the word." In the age of god-kings, church and state constituted an in- southwest Review 87</page><page sequence="9">terwoven Establishment, to the extent that rulers and concepts went down - or up - together. But concept was never quite destroyed. For whatever was valid in concept endured in a kind of subcivilization, the warrior being no more successful in destroying an idea than a priest. I have already indicated that stratification of society within a culture may lead to horizontal as well as longitudinal diversity. W. K. C. Guthrie in T he Greeks and T heir Gods presents this other aspect of concepts of 0 . With increasing complexity of the social structure and the development of what approaches national culture, differences in temperament and intelligence begin to play a larger role in concepts. In the congeries of subcultures composed of Minoan, Achaean, and Near Eastern traits which fused into the classical age of Greece, primitive and foreign concepts persisted. Perhaps social and economic as well as intellectual and temperamental factors caused a part of the population to adhere to ancient gods of the underworld, the chthonian deities, whose worship was secret and whose rituals were embodied in mysteries similar to those of Eleusis. This was no more than the per- ennial and universal desire to return to the old-time religion - and in a sense it was subversive. Meanwhile the better classes, the citizens of the Republic, rather automatically and perfunctorily built temples to the sky gods - the family of Zeus. If they tolerated the chthonian worship of the lower classes - which, after all, was some sort of religion - they looked with much less favor on certain philosophers. These men constituted a third force in Greece, a force devoted to knowledge and investiga- tion rather than to belief. In terms of chthonian and sky gods this argument has no direct reference to the progression of culture as a whole. But these con- cepts in their abstract form are indubitably relevant. In the Greek concepts, one can detect the templates of religious attitudes that have persisted in Western culture: chthonian worship equates closely with the ecstatic, the worship of sky gods with a conformist Establishment, logic and mathematics with the third position we have undertaken to study. We have ignored heretofore a discussion of modes of approach 88 winter 19 6 S</page><page sequence="10">to the problems of 0. Often associated with the ecstatic mode of worship, mysticism may be independent of it. The induction of reve- lation through nonsensory channels perhaps has its roots in the paleolithic ideas of spirits or essences. Visions induced by various physical denials were in general use among Indians of the United States, and variations on this ancient practice have been employed until recent times in an effort to attain communication with 0ě Ob- viously the method is nonrational, and by virtue of its special char- acter has often met with opposition from established groups. Two other modes of approach, both rationalistic, became opera- tive in the trichotomy that is so clearly evident in Guthrie's treat- ment of the Greeks. The first starts with the postulate that what men believe and have believed must be true. From the basic datum the argument deals in a logical and rational manner with evidence tending to support the postulate and to explain empiric observation in terms of the postulate. The term "rationalization" carries too large a pejorative connotation; the process is essentially that of scholastic philosophers. The other mode of rationalism is to refuse any postulate and to proceed inductively from observation as far as data allow. As com- pared with the other two modes this one is relatively young, for it can only come into play when means of testing are at hand. It is probably reasonable to date this mode from the time of geometry and mechanics. The point of emphasis, however, is that certain modes of approach to concepts of 0 stem from the period in Greek culture that Guthrie described, and that these modes correspond to some degree to both stratification of society and of concept. The victory of Christianity over all other conceptual organiza- tions in Western Europe and currently in a great part of the world has had some important effects upon the relationships between culture and 0. A hierarchical organization Christendom-wide up till the six- teenth century, the church in its careful definition of dogma and exclusion of heresy produced an inelastic and inflexible conceptual structure. And though this conceptual organization largely shaped culture, other elements remained viable - to burst forth in the Ren- aissance and the Reformation and to create stresses that only a Counter-Reformation could accommodate. The violence of those up- SOUTHWEST Review 89</page><page sequence="11">heavals is only a reflection of the tension developed between the in- flexible conceptual structure and an energetic culture. Once again the most massive of the conceptual structures hardened after its Counter-Reformation, oblivious of the fact that in a certain sense each generation has to recreate its own concepts of 0. (It is not that 0 changes, but rather that from the beginning one has to pre- sume that it contains within itself the potentiality for every concept of it that man can formulate.) The stress of new information and discovery is not on 0 per se, but rather on the limited concepts which interested men attempt to perpetuate. This anthropological correlation of concepts of 6 stands incom- plete through its omission of the development of the great Eastern concepts. To one reared wholly in a Western culture, however, these views are incomprehensible in any real way. I have also avoided a description of contemporary concepts, partly because William James treated this subject fifty or more years ago, and partly because present-day concepts are so varied and numerous as to make indi- vidual discussion impossible. This much I think one might say, speaking purely from the an- thropological standpoint: each level of culture pretty well accepts the concept of 0 it can understand - as Goethe wrote, "Du gleichst den Geist den du begreifst." The simplest and earliest view was that each thing had an essence or a spirit and that this substance contained within itself capacity for both boon and bane. Succeeding cultures tended to remove these spirits each a step farther away, until one group of spirits aggregated in the sky and the other in the earth. The sky spirits in general acquired beneficient properties, while the earth spirits took on more sinister qualities. The next stage in organization led to impaction of the sky gods into a single being, anthropomorphic in structure and eminently so in temperament. Meanwhile the whole aggregate of evil gathered itself into the form of a supreme earth god, the devil. What is most important is that all of these concepts had the specific aim of inducing a man to lead what passed current as a good life and to avoid what his culture called an evil one. A good life is a good life as judged by one's own contemporaries, and hence these 90 winter 1 965</page><page sequence="12">concepts seem all to be aspects of the same 0 seen through different eyes at widely differing times and described by different terms. In this case it seems as if one who accepts one of these concepts as cor- rect must accept all as correct in the context in which they occur - since the ultimate effect of each concept is to lead the individual to- ward the good as it is understood by his culture. All of these, it seems to me, lay hold in a very limited and super- ficial fashion on the concepts that our contemporary knowledge re- quires. One seems little more credible than another, either in itself or in its consequences. Unquestioning belief can hardly lead to another position. On the contrary, if one adopts the attitude of disbelief, he regards these - and all concepts not described - as so much illusion. Selective belief leads only to the acceptance of one set of concepts at the cost of others and would seem to rest on no better footing than "I accept the belief of my tribe and reject the beliefs of all tribes other than my own." One may substitute "cultures" or "epochs" for "tribes" and come out with much the same position. This discussion, then, seems to leave us with some such summary statements as these: concepts exist and have a life of their own, even though they may be mistaken; they are facts as pragmatic as books, and much harder to destroy; cultures produce those concepts they can understand and in turn these concepts influence cultures; the general direction has been toward unification, depersonalization, and abstrac- tion; from many cultural levels of the past themes have persisted, intertwined, and expanded, while both organization and perpetuation in literary form have resulted in an inflexible structure that has suffered increasingly severe stresses from empirical facts. Parallel to this gradual evolution of concepts in regard to 0 , sometimes assisting, sometimes detracting, have lain the modes of logic and of mysticism. Finally all concepts, regardless of temporal or spatial identification, also have a horizontal distribution in more complex societies, with lower strata clinging to more primitive concepts and generally seeking the ecstatic, while higher strata adopt a kind of establishment, and a few forsake the mythic and ecstatic altogether for the rational. southwest Review 91</page></plain_text>
