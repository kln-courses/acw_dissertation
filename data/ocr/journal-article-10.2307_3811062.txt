<plain_text><page sequence="1">SYMPOSIUM Claudia Card's Atrocity Paradigm MARfA PIA LARA This paper deals with Claudia Card's important contributions to a theory of evil that steps out from traditional models of thinking about this problem (theodicies, meta- physical theories, etc.). Instead, our author seeks to explore important elements from other theorists (such as Kant and Nietzsche) in order to build up her ideas of what she calls the "atrocity paradigm." This critical essay focuses mainly in the spaces where Card's conclusions need to rethink the limits and constraints of her theory. With the publication of Claudia Card's book, The Atrocity Paradigm, the field of philosophy now has the important moral duty of rethinking and discussing the concept of evil in relation to contemporary problems. Card's book-the first to deal with this problem in strictly secular terms-was immediately fol- lowed by Richard Bernstein's Radical Evil: A Philosophical Interrogation (2002) and Susan Neiman's Evil: An Alternative in Modem Thought (2002). Outside of philosophy, these kinds of issues have been addressed in books by Samantha Power (2002), Martha Minow (1998), John Conroy (2002), James Waller (2002), Norman Naimark (2001), and many others. Because Card's aim is to conceptualize evil in light of our historical expe- riences, her work represents an important step in clarifying such a concept. Before The Atrocity Paradigm, philosophy-along with theological studies-was caught in a struggle to define the very concept of evil as an important moral paradigm that can describe a specific kind of human action. Throughout his- tory, most attempts to define evil have centered around justifying the existence of a benevolent deity in light of the horrendous human suffering the world has witnessed. Paradoxically, these efforts failed to shed light on the very concept Hypatia vol. 19, no. 4 (Fall 2004) ? by Maria Pia Lara</page><page sequence="2">Maria Pia Lara they were trying to define. Rather than solving the problem of how to define evil, these efforts struggled with metaphysical questions that seemed to have no possible answers. It seemed an impossible task to justify God's role in and responsibility for the dark episodes in which undeserved suffering served as the best example of what was considered evil. Even contemporary theodicies, like the one created by Hans Jonas's portrayal of God as anthropomorphic character stripped of his power over earthly matters, provide dubious justification (Jonas 1996). By basing their assumptions on false premises-namely that evil is related to something not of this world-philosophers had to place some kind of moral responsibility on God. In early Modernity, the task of defining evil was further complicated by the inability to discriminate evil from other causes of human suffering such as natural disasters. One example of such a view was Voltaire's reflections on the earthquake of Portugal (Neiman 2002). Again, as in theodicies, what was obscured was how to thematize evil because these attempts focused only on suffering alone. Thus, evil as a concept seems to be an elusive one. Both kinds of efforts were destined to fail, and, precisely because of our contemporary expe- riences, have forced us to rethink the role that philosophy can play in defining evil. Claudia Card's book forces us to define it in purely secular, nonmetaphysical ways. To do so, Card rescues agency and suffering as two necessary dimensions of such a concept. Card begins by defining her paradigm of evil as "foreseeable intolerable harms produced by culpable wrongdoing" (3). In this way she avoids earlier problems related to theodicies and their need to relate evil to the existence of God, as well as those attempts to define it in such a way that includes natural disasters. The concept of evil, Card claims, is worth preserving: it offers important insights into specific kinds of human actions, and the ways persons relate to one another. In her view, we cannot define evil in abstract terms. Rather, such a concept requires interpretation and concrete examples, for "neither wrongdoing nor suffering alone is sufficient" to conceptualize something as evil. Card, therefore, links the concept of evil to the experience of the victim. In this way, she attempts to avoid the earlier problems presented by theories that relied mainly on agency, which is based on psychology. We should recall that this same concern led Hannah Arendt to develop a very original connection between stories and judgment. She thought that evil could not be considered in terms of psychology and refused to grant diabolical agency to human beings. Arendt understood that evildo- ers were human beings and that their decisions could only be understood by a theory of moral judgment. Thus, her view focuses on the ways in which stories relate the agent to the victim, and with this inseparable link, provides us with enough evidence to show what makes such a relationship evil. In my view, it is important not to lose sight of the role that agency plays in defining evil, for only with the idea that someone is choosing to perform cruel 187</page><page sequence="3">Hypatia actions upon others can we properly define and identify an evil action. If Card is right, we also need to recover the sufferer's view. The danger of relying solely on such a perspective, however, is that suffering alone cannot be the measure of an evil action. Suffering can lead to great distortions. It is also connected to a type of psychological paradigm. Thus, Card suggests that in order to tighten a definition of evil in a more systematic way, we must connect both sides. Card recovers the role of the agent with the term "culpable wrongdoing." I much prefer the term cruelty, however, because it lacks the resonance of other fields. The phrase "culpable wrongdoing" might lead us to include anything that also involves feelings of guilt. Such a term seems to describe a stage of moral consciousness. Here again, it is beneficial to recall Hannah Arendt: one per- petrator could be cruel without feeling guilty or even without feeling any kind of remorse, as in the case of Adolf Eichmann. The term culpable can also relate to religious or legal issues, yet we desire to establish an autonomous definition of evil actions with a corresponding name or term. Thus, in my view, the word cruelty seems a better choice. In her search to clarify why she has chosen such a definition, Card needs to consider some of the attempts at dealing with evil in the philosophical tradi- tion. Card revisits various traditions in her search for philosophical tools. In these chapters, Card focuses mainly on utilitarian and stoic theories. While both types of theories have dealt with the problem of evil, they have done so by isolating culpable wrongdoing, by focusing on suffering alone, or, at best, by "collapsing the two [sides] into one" (4). To avoid the pitfalls of those traditions, Card insists that the concept of evil should be seen as what Wittgenstein called a "family resemblance" concept (4). According to Card, then, we can rescue the term evil if we understand that by designating some action as an evil one, we can relate it to certain kinds of human actions where wrongdoing means cruelty and intolerable harm. Evil deeds are never trivial, nor can they be seen merely as deviant behavior. Card chooses the word atrocities-in the plural-to clarify what makes an action evil. This word allows us to go beyond the perils of linking evil to a metaphysical force. As before, Card claims that we do not need to know the perpetrator's mind in order to recognize the suffering produced. Culpability is not avoided because "harm is what is most salient [in] describing atrocities" (9), Card tells us. Before discussing the concrete tools that she plans to take from the stoics and the utilitarian tradition, Card focuses on Nietzsche's theory of evil. This is because Nietzsche uses genealogy much in the same manner as Wittgenstein thought of concepts such as family resemblance: namely, as an approach that focuses on meanings of concepts that evolve historically. This is a very inter- esting link, and in my view, enforces the idea that evil cannot be defined in the abstract. Card clarifies that Nietzsche first focused on the question of guilt and showed us how the meaning evolved and underwent profound changes in 188</page><page sequence="4">Maria Pia Lara history. Indeed, if we have learned anything about the differences between cur- rent and past experiences of evil, it is that our notions have changed dramati- cally since we attempted to understand why evil is directly linked to specific kinds of human suffering. Card calls these actions atrocities. Consider rape, for example. If we go back and study Greek tragedies, we learn that for the Greeks an important part of victory in war involved the taking of women as trophies. Rape was, therefore, a natural consequence. Another example in history shows that Japanese soldiers raped the Chinese women from Nanking because they considered these women to be among the spoils of war. To this day, the Japanese still refuse to see their wrongdoing. Nonetheless, these examples have been transformed in our moral understanding. Only after much suffering, and after the struggle of many women, has a consensus emerged that rape is a crime. If men thought of rape simply as measure of their triumph, herein lay their error: they failed to consider the intolerable harm that they systematically perpetrated. It is only recently that we have understood the way cruelty has inspired men to use rape as a weapon of war. This understanding comes as the result of the work of feminists who have struggled within the legal system to change our concept of rape so that it is now considered a crime against humanity. A second interesting feature of Card's analysis of Nietzsche's work on evil is her criticism that he could not provide us with a paradigm of evil because he only focused on the "paradigm of the predator." Recall that Card rightly insists that we need a definition of evil in which we can regard examples of actions "both suffered and perpetrated" (48). A third section of Card's revision of the philosophical tradition goes back to the stoics. While revising the stoics' theories, Card argues that they fail to see the "evils of cruelty and oppression" (69) because they concentrate mainly on defining good character, good will, and benevolent agency. There is no room to thematize cruelty. When dealing with the idea that humans can be capable of harm, the stoics considered these to be attitudes that we can decide upon. They reduce human action to areas in which everything seems clear and agency is flattened. They leave no room to thematize evil in terms of interpersonal relationships and social interaction. Recall again that Card has insisted that interactions and relationships are a basic component of her definition of evil. Thus, her criticism of the stoics is coherent with her view. In her chapter on Kant and his theory of radical evil, Card finds that, while Kant was incapable of understanding the principles of immorality, his theory does allow room to thematize ways in which people can decide to perform an act of evil. Card is very critical of the reasons Kant gives for the existence of evil actions, and, along with Card, many other critics find that his psychological ideas were flat and obscure (Bernstein 2002). Taken as a whole, Kant's theory of radical evil is unsuitable for Card's "atrocity paradigm" because Kant thinks of evil as the way in which we subordinate the requirements of duty to those 189</page><page sequence="5">Hypatia of self-interest. Finally, he states that we can do evil only because we have an interest or an inclination. Instead, Card puts forth the possibility that evil can be done merely for evil's sake alone, out of pure cruelty. This is an interesting and original view. While I agree with the idea of stressing that cruelty can be done for its own sake, it is important to refrain from attaching diabolical forces to the idea of cruelty lest we are led again into a metaphysical paradigm. Kant's most interesting insight, however, is that he recognized that we humans have a propensity for evildoing. For Card, this insight remains unex- plained. Furthermore, Card argues, Kant proceeds to thematize evil in the abstract, without giving us any examples. She also notes that Kant's categorical imperative is unsuitable for a moral theory that aims at describing evil. Accord- ing to Card, Kant's idea of agency remains insufficiently developed. Agency cannot be conceived only in terms of "capacity for coherence and consistency in action" (81). These features of autonomy are not all the same in all persons. Many people do not even possess such a capacity, and others barely have it. Thus, Card concludes, Kant might be helpful in drawing distinctions between perpetrators of evil, but his theory does not give us an account of the recognition of harms, which is basic for an understanding of an evil action. Let me just say something very brief about Kant and his legacy on evil. While I agree with most of Card's critical arguments, I would like to insist on two very important elements that Kant first put forth for the purposes of giving a moral frame to the idea of evil. First, Kant was opposed to the idea that theodicies could be theories about evil. He took away the subject of evil out of a metaphysical paradigm and placed it, instead, in strictly moral territory. Furthermore, he suggested that agency was an important element related to the idea of evil and he immediately related his idea of agency to freedom. The connection of these two terms is essential to the idea of doing evil to others. We always possess the ability to choose not to do evil, and if we do, it is entirely because we have freedom. I know that Card thinks that some evils might be forced upon us, like the ones she describes in a chapter dedicated to the "gray zones" of Hitler's Germany. In considering Kant's ideas, particularly those concerning the "gray zones," we should remember some of Hannah Arendt's views on the subject. What Arendt saw as the greatest evil was the way in which the Germans stripped humanity from the Jews. When Jews entered the so-called gray zones, they had no real ability to make decisions. The idea was that freedom was erased from their lives. For Arendt, freedom was the most basic feature of humanity and that was the reason why these people were dehumanized. Their capacity for a moral decision in choosing or not to do evil did not exist. This much was accepted in Primo Levi's own original idea about the gray zones. For him, one cannot judge someone permanently forced to choose between two evils. Recall a different example. In the novel and later film Sophie's Choice, Sophie 190</page><page sequence="6">Maria Pia Lara is condemned to permanent torture because she was forced to choose which of her children should be kept alive. The evil here is magnified by the idea that she was forced to become like a God who would have to decide who could live and who must die. Yet any choice she made involved the death and survival of her own children. As we have briefly seen, Card's atrocity paradigm rearranges some elements of the stoic and utilitarian traditions. She takes from the stoics the idea that the perpetrator can have some control of his deeds. Meanwhile, she takes from the utilitarian views the idea that harms can often exceed the perpetrator's control. In the first half of her book, Card is able to arrive at a clear definition of the atrocity paradigm. In the second part of the book, Card offers her belief that evil should be discussed as part of the moral-political agenda. Card's concerns about this agenda are closely linked to the idea that evil should help us reframe many of our contemporary problems. Card claims that "feminists and other political activists working for social justice or liberation should give priority to address- ing evils over the goals of eliminating unjust inequalities" (96). This claim is provocative but might be misleading. When we deal with problems of oppression such as slavery, for example, we are dealing with questions related to justice. The important question is: what is the relationship between justice and evil? We need to develop this link further. We have to notice that without justice there would be no laws pertaining to crimes against humanity and other atrocities. We need both theories to work together for the sake of understanding what makes an evil institution and how to mend those institutions through our critical-historical understanding. How can we accomplish this without a clear concept of justice? In developing a theory of evil, we need to clarify that differences exist among evil actions because we need to be able to distinguish greater from lesser evils. Only by a critical examination of differences can we reach public agreements about what needs to be done and what should be a priority. A word like "atroc- ity" seems to be connected to genocides, mass murder, ethnic cleansing, and mass rape. In describing the events of the Armenian genocide, the mass rape of Nanking, the genocide and final solution during World War II, the genocide of Rwanda, and the ethnic cleansing in Srebrenica, we can also admit that those are atrocities that constitute great evils. Important evils are also embodied in institutions. Here, too, the possibility of recognizing greater and lesser evils should be an important part of a theory of evil. We can call slavery and apart- heid two major evil institutions. We can also say that what the Taliban made out of the seclusion of Afghan women was a form of apartheid. The institution of marriage, which Card discusses at length, has led to many injustices and even to evil actions. The question here is to focus on the pos- sibility of understanding institutions like marriage in a critical manner. Our 191</page><page sequence="7">Hypatia ideas about marriage have changed so profoundly that such an institution has been read in light of the radicalization of democratic principles. This is the reason both homosexual and heterosexual couples would like to participate in this institution. In my opinion, institutions such as marriage have a better chance to avoid wrongdoings if we stress the need to strengthen individual rights. Just as our historical understanding of rights of inclusion have led us to redefine better political, social, and civil rights, we must now consider how women as indi- viduals can meet their needs while protecting their rights. It is important to defend the institution of rights and to understand the ways they have become disaggregated in order to fight against some evils. The lives of individuals have improved as their concrete rights have become positive. Nowadays we are dealing with the idea of granting rights to children. Another important way to struggle against evil perpetrated by institutions, habits, and traditions is through culture. Culture plays a very important dimension in the way we embody our notions of evil. Cultural criticism allows us to resignify our values and beliefs. By transforming culture, we can also transform institutions. Finally, it is not a coincidence that feminists have played an important role in the thematization of evil. We should regard this convergence of concerns by many feminists as the most important step to reframe evil as a moral and legal paradigm. This step has opened up a new agenda for justice. For this reason we need to acknowledge the work of legal scholars such as Catharine MacKinnon and Martha Minow. Others feminists, like Robin May Schott, for example, are struggling to define rape as a very specific gender paradigm. Card's contribution to this new moral frame is a decisive step that will change our views in many important and significant ways. REFERENCES Bernstein, Richard, J. 2002.
