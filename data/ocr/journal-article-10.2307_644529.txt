<plain_text><page sequence="1">ritual hierarchy and secular equality in a Sepik River village SIMON J. HARRISON-University of Ulster introduction A recurring theme in the literature on Melanesian male cults is that these institutions are symptoms of "polarized" relations between the sexes and, in some cases, maintain the domi- nance of adult men and the subordination of women and juniors (Allen 1967; Herdt 1981, 1982; Langness 1967, 1974; Meggitt 1964; Read 1952-53; A. J. Strathern 1970). The aim of this article is to test this view against a particular ethnographic case: the male initiatory cult at Avatip, a community of some 1300 Manambu speakers (see Laycock 1965) situated on the Sepik River in the East Sepik Province of Papua New Guinea (see Harrison 1982a, 1982b, 1983, 1984, 1985). My starting point for the analysis of this cult is the observation that much of its lore and ac- tivity has the key characteristic of being kept, at least in theory, secret. By definition, the exist- ence of this "esoteric" sociocultural domain requires the parallel existence of a world of "pub- lic" social and cultural forms. This is also a practical requirement: if initiated men are to pre- serve their ritual secrets in everyday social interaction, there must exist a body of social and cultural conventions sufficient for the purposes of general social life. An irreducible feature of these systems and, I would argue, one from which any analysis of them must begin, is this: that they are based on a dichotomy between two sociocultural domains, one esoteric and the other exoteric, and that these two domains must in some sense differ. From the viewpoint of the initiates, I might add, the more they differ the more effectively is initiatory secrecy maintained. In a system such as this, what one would normally regard as the "cultural order" in fact consists, minimally, of two distinct orders: one available to the society at large and the other available only to cult initiates. In practice, most systems are more complex than this, the eso- teric order itself being differentiated into a further hierarchy of successively more secret levels. Characteristically, constructs belonging to one domain are revealed to be partly or wholly "fic- tional" on initiation into the next. At Avatip, for instance-as in many Melanesian male cults- spirits that supposedly "cry" within the men's cult-houses during rituals turn out, upon initia- tion, to be pairs of bamboo flutes played by men as a "trick" (rdk). Barth (1975) has given an At Avatip, a Middle Sepik society in Papua New Guinea, domesticity and male cult ritual are two alternative forms of social action, based respectively on "egal- itarian" and "hierarchical" models of the social order. Ritual does not "reflect" social reality but temporarily alters it, and the power of initiated men is the power to bring hierarchy periodically into existence within the circumscribed context of ritual.

What I wish to show is that "public" and "ritual" culture at Avatip differ in their ideological content and contain, in effect, two opposed formulations of the nature of social relations be- tween the sexes and between senior and junior males. The formulation governing the activities of the male cult I have elsewhere (Harrison 1985) called "ritual hierarchy." The alternative formulation, "secular equality" (Harrison 1985), prevails in nonritual contexts, preeminently in the sphere of kinship and domestic relations.' I argued there that these two ideologies, though antithetical in many respects, hinge upon and are reducible to ambiguities in the indig- enous concept of "person." Here, I would like to extend this analysis by arguing that the hi- erarchical and male "elitist" values expressed in the men's cult are not culturally "definitive." The cult does not affirm the community's "cultural" values but its ritual values, and these differ from those prevailing in secular life. If Avatip religion serves to reinforce everyday social values, it does so by antithesis. Second, the power and status men enjoy in ritual contexts are not in any sense an expression of, or pattern for, their role in the society in general. Male cult ritual is no more, or less, a "paradigm" for social action as a whole than is secular life. Like everyday life, it is a particular form of social action, but one employing specifically ritual structures of exclusion and hier- archy not employed in secular contexts. Avatip social structure has two alternative but con- ceptually coexistent dimensions, which manifest themselves in two contrasting forms of social action.2 everyday life and secular equality In one of the most incisive contributions to the anthropological study of gender, Ortner (1974) has argued that male dominance is a universal fact of human culture, and that a basic element of this is a symbolic relegation of women and domesticity in some degree to the realm of "nature." Much of the material on Melanesian male cults seems to accord fairly well with this thesis. Read (1952-53, 1954), for example, described the male cult of the Gahuku-Gama as an attempt by men to redress, by "artificial" means, the perceived superiority of women's "natural" powers of growth and fertility; and Bowden (1983) has recently cited Ortner's ar- gument with approval in his analysis of the art and ceremonial of the Kwoma men's cult. It does indeed appear that in many Melanesian societies men regard their religious activities as em- bodying something interpretable as the essence of "culture"; a fundamental antithesis exists, reinforced by innumerable regulations and taboos, between the ritual sphere of men and the female sphere of domesticity and child-rearing (see, for example, Herdt 1981; Newman 1965; Salisbury 1965). The business of ritual is, so to speak, to "create" men out of the products of women's "natural" fertility; and this requires removing boys at an early age from the debilitat- ing influence of the female domain and exposing them to the central mysteries of male "cul- ture." The men's cult at Avatip is quite amenable to an interpretation of this kind, as I shall show below. But there is a problem with applying Ortner's thesis to the interpretation of Melanesian male cults, and it can be revealed most clearly if one returns for the moment to the terms of her argument. It seems from her argument that the main factor responsible for the identification of men with "culture," and women with "nature," is this: their associations with the political and domestic domains, respectively. One question that this raises is how the domestic roles of men are viewed. The logic of her argument would seem to imply that when men act in their capacity as members of familial groups they experience themselves to some degree as contextually "marginal" to culture. Similarly, if women assent to the view that domesticity is peripheral to 414 american ethnologist</page><page sequence="3">culture, it would follow that women, in their domestic relations with men, view their menfolk situationally as to some extent "infracultural" like themselves. The argument seems to lead, in other words, to the conclusion that men, in the setting of their domestic lives, perceive them- selves and are perceived by women as less than fully "social" beings: a conclusion that would contradict the original terms of the hypothesis, according to which this "marginal" status was reserved exclusively for women. What is wrong here, I suggest, is that Ortner has implicitly identified "culture" with the po- litical domain, and in this way seems to have fallen victim to the same ideological forms that she has so elegantly analyzed. Even if, as she argues, men in their capacity as political office- holders universally consign women and domesticity to an "infracultural" status, it is still es- sential to recognize that the "locus" of this idea is the political domain. That is to say, there would still be a fundamental distinction to be made between constructs employed in the do- mestic domain, and constructs used in political contexts about domesticity. To assume that these political values are culturally definitive is to succumb to the ideological devaluation of domesticity which, M. Strathern (1980) has argued, characterizes our own cultural tradition but can distort our understanding of others. There is, I think, a widespread assumption in anthropology, of which Ortner's thesis is only one example, that significant formulations of the social order derive only from the public or political sphere. What this assumption ignores is the possibility of alternative symbolic or ide- ological forms through which both sexes put forward the claims and interests of the domestic sphere-quite possibly in opposition to those of the political domain-and express a distinc- tively familial vision of their social relations. I think this problem is particularly acute in the case of societies, such as Avatip, in which the central political institution is a male initiatory cult. At Avatip, at least, "exoteric" culture has its structural basis in the familial sphere, and it could most accurately be described as the cultural system of the domestic realm. To ignore this system would be to ignore the cultural regime under which everyday life is conducted and under which men and women lead most of their social existence. I would like now to describe some of the salient contrasts between the "mundane" and "rit- ual" domains of Avatip culture, and to show that the first has its institutional locus in "familial" principles of social organization and that the second has its locus in the men's cult. Borrowing a term from Schutz (1967), I will call the mundane sociocultural sphere "everyday life"; I wish to avoid the term "domestic domain" as it has misleading connotations in the Avatip context. Domesticity at Avatip, as I will try to show, is not so much a domain of social action as a form of social action; it is not so much "enclosed" within political structures as it is an alternative to them, and in the context of everyday life the men's cult has much the same "private" sig- nificance as domesticity has in the context of ritual. Although it is possible to distinguish other contexts of social action at Avatip besides everyday life and ritual, I would like to concentrate on these two here. For they form the opposed institutional and ideological "poles" of the so- ciocultural system, and from them derive the two ideological countercurrents that comprise Avatip "culture." The institutions around which everyday life at Avatip revolves are the household and con- jugal family, and the networks of kinship and affinity that link these units together in exchanges of food, wealth, and labor. The main concerns of the community in everyday life are with the essentially "domestic" activities of food production, child-rearing, and the creation and main- tenance of kinship relations. Because Avatip is largely endogamous most individuals can trace kin or affinal ties with each other, and in many cases these ties are multiple. In fact the "density" of kin ties within the community is such that, paradoxically, kinship has something of the char- acter of a free contract. All of an individual's effective kin ties are based on exchanges of gifts and services; and most of his or her other social relationships are simply "unactivated"-but always potentially "operable"-kin relations. As a result the individual has considerable free- dom to establish, maintain, or suspend effective kinship with others. An enterprising man or ritual hierarchy and secular equality 415</page><page sequence="4">woman can set up and operate a very large kinship network; and this, in fact, is virtually the villagers' definition of a "good" (viyakat) person. Interpersonal kinship is not, in a sense, a structurally "limited" social universe; its only limits are those of the individual's initiative and energy. It has sometimes been suggested (for example, Keesing 1982) that male cults in Melanesia serve in some sense to validate the exploitation of female labor by men. At Avatip this kind of expropriation occurs neither in everyday contexts nor, as I shall show later, in the performance of ritual. The main subsistence activities at Avatip are fishing and the production of sago-starch, with yam cultivation and hunting having secondary roles in the economy. Hunting is a male specialization, while fishing is almost exclusively a female task; yam gardening, on the other hand, is a collaborative activity involving no very rigid sexual division of labor except in the process of planting (see Harrison 1982b). In some neighboring Sepik River groups-the latmul (Bateson 1932, 1958; Hauser-Schaublin 1976) and Chambri (Gewertz 1983; Mead 1935) for example-women exchange surplus fish for the sago of inland groups. Avatip, however, is self- sufficient in sago and, while Avatip women do sometimes hold fish-for-sago markets with "bush" villages like their latmul and Chambri counterparts, this is not necessary for subsistence and much of the sago supply at Avatip is home-produced. Men and women contribute an ap- proximately equal amount of labor to the production of sago: the husband fells the palm, cuts open the cortex, and pounds the fibrous pith to break it up; the wife then separates the flour from the pith in a special leaching apparatus. An important point about the organization of production at Avatip is that it gives women a potential economic independence that it does not give to men. In order to support herself and her children, all a woman needs to do in principle is to fish and trade the surplus for sago. To have the economic collaboration of her husband saves her labor and provides her with a greater range of foods, but it is not actually essential. A man, on the other hand, cannot subsist ade- quately even in the short term without the assistance of a woman, for the only important food he can obtain solely through his own labor is game. Women consequently have a significant degree of power in the domestic economy and can force their husbands to meet their produc- tive obligations in a way that men cannot do with their wives. If a woman is dissatisfied with her husband's work effort, she can simply withdraw her labor by laying conditional curses upon collaborating with him in food production and upon providing him with food. These curses are legitimate and powerful sanctions of a woman's domestic rights and would bring affliction on the entire household if the husband failed to respect them. A shiftless or exploitative husband simply finds himself-until he makes amends-reduced to a kind of domestic pariah scaveng- ing for fallen coconuts and edible leaves, while his wife and children continue to subsist at more or less their usual level. I am not suggesting here that Avatip men are the economic dependents of their wives in the way, for example, that Mead (1935) portrayed the neighboring Chambri (cf. Gewertz 1983). It is a basic ideal of the domestic ethos, and by and large an actuality, for husbands and wives to have equally important roles in food production and joint control of the products of their labor. But my point is that women have, in their latent economic self-sufficiency, a much greater power than men to ensure that this equitable collaboration is maintained. It is largely for this reason that polygyny does not, as it does, for example, among the Tiwi of North Australia (Hart and Pilling 1960), enable a man to live off the labor of his domestic group and devote himself to ritual pursuits. A man with two wives does not, let us say, need to do only half the work of a man with one; his work is roughly doubled and as a result polygyny is an option which many Avatip men prefer not to take up. Polygynists are regarded with some- thing of that uneasy respect we accord in our society to workaholics; they are, and have to be, men of exceptional productive energy. Everyday life at Avatip is governed by values in which differences of power and status are minimally institutionalized; the aspect of social relations viewed as centrally significant is their 416 american ethnologist</page><page sequence="5">moral and affective content. According to this scheme of values, which I have elsewhere (Har- rison 1985) called "secular equality," the basis of sociality lies in the broadly conceived ca- pacity of persons to "hear" (wukana)-that is, to comprehend and empathize with-one an- other. The key values of secular equality have to do with marriage viewed as a cooperative partnership, with an ethos of parental nurture, and with an active sense of reciprocity between kin. From the perspective of secular equality the domestic sphere is the core of human culture; and people's commitment to their familial roles is the public measure of their "full" human- ness.3 The household sphere is the symbolic focus of "society," and all social relations take their ideal moral idiom from it. The antithesis of society, from this viewpoint, is a conceptually amalgamated "extrasocial" world consisting of ghosts, spirits, wild animals, and foreigners. All such beings are regarded, in varying degrees, as hostile, as outside the scope of morality, and in some broad sense as "powerful." Power-whether manifested in the form of a ghost's malice, the ferocity of a wild boar or crocodile, or the sorcery or physical aggression of enemy villages-is viewed as a phe- nomenon emanating from beyond the "social" universe. That is to say, it is treated as a defining attribute of nonsocial beings and as ideally absent from social relations. The men's cult is ac- cordingly a "marginal" institution in everyday life. For its primary activity is precisely that of contacting sources of "power"-spirit beings-and introducing them into human society. The morally ambiguous status of the cult gives it, in everyday affairs, a kind of structurally "private" significance, and domestic groupings are the focus around which public life is carried out. The organizational forms of everyday life reproduce themselves autonomously and are not in any sense functionally dependent on the men's cult. The cult does not, for example, regulate marriage in any way, or the developmental cycle or productive activities of domestic groups. The only way in which the cult does intervene in familial life is by disrupting it, as it does, for instance, when the performance of a ritual requires the segregation of men from their wives and children. The values of "secular equality" are invoked and reaffirmed, sometimes openly but more often tacitly, as a continuous and integral part of "practical" day-to-day social inter- action. They appear to be reproduced quite effectively in this way, and collective (Durkhei- mian) ritual affirmations of them would be superfluous; they certainly do not receive such re- inforcement in any case, as Avatip ritual has an entirely different ideological message. the men's cult and ritual hierarchy The male initiatory system at Avatip is similar in type to many others reported from Melanesia and its basic features will, I think, be quite familiar. It is what Allen (1967), in his definitive survey of Melanesian cult systems, calls a "compulsory" association, all males being expected to enter it. The cult has a series of initiatory stages, at each of which the novices undergo various ordeals and privations, and have secret ritual objects, techniques, and knowledge revealed to them. All the rituals of the cult involve the initiates in impersonating spirit beings in one way or another, as supposed "deceptions" practiced on women and juniors. The central concerns of the men's cult are with the maintenance of the cosmic order by men, and with their assertion of their individual and collective strength in warfare. In the cult ide- ology, which I have elsewhere (Harrison 1985) called "ritual hierarchy," society is concep- tualized as a series of ritual categories graded in status according to their supposed proximity to the sources of supernatural power. According to this formulation, the core of human culture is the male cult and the secret knowledge and practices associated with it, while women, chil- dren, and the domestic sphere are accorded-very much along the lines of Ortner's argu- ment-a virtually infracultural status. But I should point out that there is no simple nature/cul- ture dichotomy here. Human society, according to the ritual ideology, is a hierarchy set be- tween two "non-social" orders: the world of mystical powers "above" society, and the domesticity "beneath" it. ritual hierarchy and secular equality 417</page><page sequence="6">The decision to hold a ritual is made entirely by the ritually senior men. They sequester them- selves in their cult houses, pronouncing themselves in a "tabooed" state of ritual potency; they purportedly summon spirit agencies and assume the dangerous supernatural power of these beings. Staging the ritual is, in other words, an entirely unilateral act, and this asymmetry is a central feature of "ritual hierarchy." I will try to show that the hierarchical values celebrated in the men's cult have few reper- cussions on mundane social activities, and that it is primarily in the circumscribed setting of ritual itself that these values are publicly expressed. Although "ritual hierarchy" is an essen- tially "esoteric" doctrine, expressed in a body of ritual symbolism inaccessible to women and juniors, inequality is nevertheless manifested publicly in ritual at two distinguishable levels. First, it is represented, in a somewhat "disguised" form, as a value or ideal; and second, and more importantly, it is established temporarily as a fact. The initiatory grades are associated with particular sets of named spirit beings, graduated in supernatural "potency" according to the ritual status of each grade. When a ritual is performed, the men of the relevant grade "summon" their associated spirits into the village and "install" them in their cult house, and in fact much of what the men do in the ritual they publicly attribute to these beings. For instance, during first-stage initiation the initiators cicatrize the novices, an operation meant to foster the novices' growth by purging them of "maternal" blood (cf. Salis- bury 1965). But publicly the initiators claim that the novices are "gored" by spirits, whom they portray as anthropomorphic beings with tusks; and this device is, I think, a partial disavowal by the men of their own responsibility for the ordeal. It is a concession to the values prevailing outside the ritual sphere, made necessary because the ideology of ritual is at odds with the ethos of everyday life. The "public" symbolism of a ritual signifies hierarchy in a somewhat "weak- ened" form and is a kind of compromise-formation, to borrow a Freudian term, between two conflicting schemes of values. When men attribute their own acts to spirits, they are not as disingenuous as might seem on first sight. They by no means regard these beings as fictional, and to men, in fact, one of the central secret "mysteries" of Avatip religion is that in ritual they themselves in some sense in- carnate the spirits. This is not a "possession" cult in Lewis's (1971) definition of the term, and in ritual men retain their usual personalities. But men do, nevertheless, regard the spirits as in some loosely conceived sense "immanent" in themselves as a group. In a certain respect, this accurately reflects the sociological ambience of ritual: to the men, ritual is a highly "non-nor- mal" form of social experience involving, temporarily, a felt change in their social identities. The values of the male cult manifest themselves in "public" culture in the idea that men, in ritual, entertain spirit beings and while doing so take on something of the dangerous potency of spirits. The special status this gives to initiated men is viewed as consisting essentially in the privilege of contacting supernatural forces in ritual. The ritual status of initiates is conceived, accordingly, as "actualized" only in the performance of ritual itself; it has a largely nominal significance in mundane contexts, and the system of initiatory grades remains by and large a merely potential organizational principle. I said earlier that Avatip ritual not only "communicates" inequality as an idea but also tem- porarily establishes it as a fact. By this, I mean that although women and uninitiated males are excluded from cult rituals, they nevertheless play an essential role in these events. Their role, of course, is the vital one of being excluded. During a ritual, the women and noninitiates cannot have direct contact with the performers and must avoid the cult building in which the ritual is taking place. At certain points in the ritual they may have to remain in their houses in silence or even leave the village altogether for a few hours. From a sociological perspective, this be- havior is of course an absolutely integral part of the ritual; and the crucial point here is that it is enforced, ultimately, by the initiated men through their conjuring of spirits inimical to non- initiates. In effect men do indeed-and with perfect clarity-communicate to women and jun- iors the hierarchical values of the initiatory system: they do so by implementing these values. 418 american ethnologist</page><page sequence="7">In ritual, men suspend their "ordinary" social identities and arrogate to themselves, to some degree, the power of spirit beings. The implication here is that, while exercising power, men must temporarily become something "other" than themselves. This is, again, a compromise with the values of everyday life. Men assume in ritual a persona from which they dissociate themselves in everyday life; and one which makes them, from the perspective of "secular equality," contextually "marginal" to human society. This is in an important sense a basic weakness of the ritual ideology, for the ritual persona of men cannot by its very nature be maintained permanently. An elementary point here is that the performers of a ritual cannot fulfill their roles in the domestic economy, and Avatip rituals are limited in their frequency and duration ultimately by constraints inherent in the organization of production. Cult rituals tend to be mounted in the period between December and March, when the yam gardens are being harvested and there is little horticultural work to be done (see Harrison 1982b). Before any ritual of more than a few days' duration, the household must lay in a sufficient store of sago flour to last it until the end of the performance. While the ritual is taking place, each performer is supplied daily from this stock by his domestic group. His wife also provides him with fish each day, just as she does at other times. In addition, the men hold large-scale hunts during the longer rituals, and supply themselves (and also, supposedly, their spirit "guests") with considerable amounts of game. Ultimately, the time limits on ritual are set by the performers' need to resume, with their wives, their subsistence activities, particularly sago production and the cultivation of the swiddens. So, far from the men's cult being a means of disguising the expropriation of female labor, as Keesing (1982), for example, has suggested, it is precisely the impossibility of such exploitation that limits the activities of the cult. Ritual gives men no power over the sphere of domestic production; on the contrary, it is an attempt by men to periodically escape their implicitly inferior position within it. In ritual men impose a hierarchical structure on the community through their control of the means of large-scale public acts of signification, and this structure is essentially disarticulated with the organizational forms within which production and exchange take place. But the weak- ness of a system of political relations sustained by the power of signification is that it rapidly "dissolves" once it is no longer actually being signified. At the end of every ritual men carry out ceremonial acts publicly "detaching" themselves from their ritual personae and announc- ing their return to everyday life; at this point the social system "lapses" rapidly back into an egalitarian register. Because the values of secular equality are reaffirmed through practical everyday social activity-marriage negotiations, exchanges of agricultural labor, the produc- tive cooperation of spouses, and so forth-these values have a fundamental resilience and rap- idly reconstitute themselves once these activities are resumed. In the final analysis, the power of men simply is the power to constitute, occasionally and for limited periods, an altered social reality in which women and junior males are subordinate to them. Ritual is the social reality within which this domination exists; it does not reaffirm a power men hold in everyday life, for the power of men is in one sense far narrower and yet in another respect far more profound than this would imply. The cult simply does not give men any special coercive powers over women and juniors in secular life. What it does give them is the far more fundamental power to negate the mundane social order and replace it with a pol- itico-ritual hierarchy. It is impossible for men to exercise power without at the same time bring- ing into being a specifically "ritual" milieu, and in this way transforming the ground rules of social action. And when men cease, at the end of a ritual, to exercise and display this power, the community resumes secular and egalitarian forms of social organization; it is impossible for men to operate as social actors in everyday life without foregoing their ritual powers over women and juniors. While men do, sometimes, appear implicitly to claim that ritual is a defin- itive representation of the social order, this claim is at one level excessive and at another level too modest: modest, because their ritual acts do not simply represent but contextually create a structure of social relations; and excessive, because their rituals do not correspond to the every- ritual hierarchy and secular equality 419</page><page sequence="8">day social order but temporarily suspend it. Ritual, in effect, is men's power of veto over the egalitarian conventions of secular life. The structural and ideological "disjunction" between male ritual and everyday life indicates that the cult cannot be fully understood if one focuses only on its role within the social system. To understand the significance of the cult, one needs to adopt a regional perspective and look to the community's external relations. In the past, Avatip existed in a more or less chronic state of war with most of its neighbors, punctuated by short-term and separate truces for trade and military alliance. A good deal of mutual hostility and suspicion still exists between them, pri- marily regarding land, and these rivalries are played out in intervillage brawls, sports contests, sorcery feuds, and, sometimes, litigation. Here I would endorse a view put forward by a number of authors (for example, Langness 1967): that Melanesian male cults and their associated values of male elitism are responses to the real and perceived exigencies of warfare. But a point on which I would differ from Langness is that, at Avatip, these values do not, as it were, pervade the totality of social life but have to do specifically with the political rhetoric of intervillage rivalry. I would argue that the cult ideology in fact describes the way in which the villagers- at least adult men-want their society to be viewed by outsiders. It is a model of the social order not primarily intended for "home use" but for consumption by the outside world. It is a re- sponse to the perceived need, pertaining to the "political" field of intervillage relations, for men to delimit, as Ardener (1972) puts it, themselves-and-their-women from identically conceived neighboring groups. The important point here is that the ritual "model" is based on a principle of power and status ranking. To have a more elaborately or more rigidly ranked initiatory system is a bid for prestige in the intervillage political arena. Avatip men, for example, pride themselves (correctly or not, I am unable to say) on having one more initiatory grade in their cult than do their latmul neighbors. The values of the male cult are the values of the regional political system and not, in basis, those of the internal social field of the village.4 The cult has nevertheless quite real sociological effects within the village. One of the most important is that it provides the village with a political integration which the secular structures probably could not. Tuzin (1976) has argued that the complex ritual organization of another Middle Sepik society, the Ilahita Arapesh, is a response to the problems of integration faced by a large social system under pressure from warfare. I think a similar argument can be applied to Avatip, also a sizable community by Sepik standards though with a population a little less than llahita's 1500: that is, that the cult organization counterbalances the tendencies toward fission in this uncentralized social system and thereby maintains the military strength that lies in size. A point I would stress, however, is that these structures exist largely as ideas in secular contexts and are fully "actualized" only in the setting of ritual. On the one hand, Avatip is part of a wider political universe in which villages communicate with each other, through their adult men, primarily by means of ritual and (in the past) warfare. The ideological message of Avatip ritual is that "society" is this intervillage universe presided over by senior men, and that Avatip itself is a kind of huge domestic "cell" confining women and juniors to a structurally inferior status. On the other hand, Avatip is in demographic, polit- ical, and economic respects very largely an autonomous social system; and from its "internal" perspective, society is the universe of the village itself, its people socially (that is, morally) equal in relation to the enemy (mam) groups beyond it. This is the view governing everyday social practice. There is, then, a kind of relativity of perspectives within the social system, and it is this issue I would like to examine a little more fully in the next section. the problem of models All that I have said so far about the ideology of the men's cult would seem to mark it indelibly as what Ardener (1972, 1975) calls a "male" model. It pertains to an exclusively male institu- tion; its main relevance is to the male-controlled field of intersocietal relations; and, as I have 420 american ethnologist</page><page sequence="9">tried to show, it represents one "half" of cognized social reality. However, if one tries to derive the ritual and secular conceptions of the social order from the dichotomy of the sexes, a number of problems arise. Men are quite aware that social relations outside the setting of ritual are governed by an egalitarian ethic and are capable of subscribing situationally to these values. The same is true of women in regard to the cult ideology: they are quite conscious that they are ritually unequal to men and, in appropriate contexts, are by no means incapable of endorsing the values of the ritual system. The ritual and mundane "models" are not in any simple sense gender-linked but are rather, as Milton (1979:51) puts it in her critique of Ardener's argument, "models appropriate for expression in particular situations." "Ritual hierarchy" cannot be in- terpreted as a "male" model in Ardener's sense of the term, because it is certainly neither sub- scribed to exclusively by males nor is it the only model men employ. But there is a different and rather more significant sense in which it is a sociologically "male" model; and this, as I have explained, is that men alone have the power to bring about the "realization" of this model in social action. In other words, one needs to take a rather different approach from Ardener's to the nature of actors' constructs of their social world. The proposition that Ardener's argument is based on is undeniably true: as a result of their (no doubt always) different social experience, men and women must in some sense visualize their society differently. An assumption here is that the conceptions people hold of their society are subjective responses to their own social being, so that the locus of these models is, in short, the individual consciousness. Individuals whose social experience coincides to a significant extent (they have, for example, the same social status, or the same gender, or belong to the same class, and so forth) will tend to subscribe to significantly similar models of their society; while individuals with disparate positions in the social system will tend to construe their society in correspondingly different ways. But one of the problems with this approach is that there can never be an exact correspondence between the social experience of different individuals, no matter how similar their social positions or how homogeneous their society. As Ardener himself observes (1972:153), one can distinguish sociologically not only women from men, but also "inarticulate classes of men, young people and children." The difficulty here is precisely that the number of analytically significant categories distinguishable by the observer is in principle limitless. Indeed, the logic of Ardener's argument requires us to continue these discriminations down to the level from which his argument began: the level of the individual consciousness. We would be forced to recognize that there were in all truth as many "models" in a particular society as there were minds within it. This would certainly, as Ardener (1972:155) puts it, "split apart the very framework" of our discipline, but it would not put anything constructive in its place. If Ardener is arguing, as I think he is, for a revision of the way in which we interpret social reality (and I agree with the need for such a revision) then his approach will not, as it stands, take us very far. He cogently makes the case that sociocultural systems-viewed in the func- tionalist tradition as more or less integrated and self-consistent wholes-encompass contrasting models reflecting different and even opposed social interests. But the assumption vitiating his argument is that the locus of these models is the consciousness of the individual. The assump- tion I adopt in this paper is that these models are not phenomena of subjectivity but, to use Schutz's (1967) term, of intersubjectivity. That is to say, they are not simply a means whereby the individual makes sense of his or her social world; they are a means of communicating with others and belong to a shared communicative universe. If different social-structural models coexist in a given social system it is because they belong, not to different individuals or to dif- ferent categories of individuals, but to what Schutz (1967:1, 230) calls different provinces of meaning. Because my concerns are sociological rather than phenomenological in emphasis, I would rather speak of domains of social action or social experience. I have tried to show that at Avatip, ritual is one such domain and everyday life is another. This approach makes it pos- sible to recognize the coexistence of a variety of models in a given society, but without reducing ritual hierarchy and secular equality 421</page><page sequence="10">the analysis-as Ardener's assumptions logically commit one to doing-to a form of psychol- ogy or biography. Ardener criticizes an older anthropology for implicitly treating "male" conceptions of soci- ety as definitive and argues that the analysis of ritual and other symbolic forms can reveal per- spectives held by politically disadvantaged groups such as women. The assumption here, itself quite valid, is that consciousness experiences the social world as a kind of external reality (see Berger 1969). But Ardener's mistake is to treat ideology, ritual, belief-in short, the symbolic order-as simply this institutional reality reflected, from various perspectives within it, in the products of subjectivity. What this approach fails in the end to take account of is that the inter- subjective nature of these constructs makes them the means not only of rendering the social world intelligible but of constituting it in the first place. The division of Avatip society into politically subordinate and superordinate groups is not an "absolute" property of Avatip social structure. It is one of two alternative ways in which the villagers formulate their social order, and it is "actualized" in social action by senior men in the context of ritual. These two for- mulations involve different forms of social classification and contrasting principles of social organization; they cannot therefore be "explained" by positing a logically "prior" division of the society into groups and categories. The secular and ritual spheres of Avatip society are al- ternative configurations of one and the same social universe, and the basic structural dichot- omy in the social system is therefore not between initiates and noninitiates, men and women, seniors and juniors, or any other social categories. It is between those contexts in which these divisions are salient and those in which other organizational forms are employed. That is to say, it is not a dichotomy between social groups but between different conceptions of the nature of social relations. So far as Avatip is concerned, I agree with Ardener that an interpretation of the society based solely on the statements of adult men would be incomplete and distorted. But this is not be- cause men harbor models different from those of women. It is because men are likely to select, of the two formulations at their disposal, the one with which they tend to identify their political interests and which is meant for communication with outsiders: this is the formulation I have called "ritual hierarchy." If one treats actors' models as creations merely of their own individual subjectivity, it would indeed seem unlikely that each actor would develop several conflicting models of his or her society. It is for this reason, I think, that Ardener tends to regard such models as belonging, in the end, to different social groups rather than to different contexts of social action. But this stumbling block is removed once one recognizes the essentially intersubjective nature of these constructs. Adults at Avatip have no difficulty whatever in conceiving of men and women, for instance, as morally equal yet ritually unequal. The models that I call ritual hierarchy and sec- ular equality are two distinct, but simultaneously quite thinkable, dimensions of the villagers' cultural order. What they are not, however, is simultaneously livable. It is because of this that ritual and everyday life exist as two quite discrete fields of social action. And it is also because of this that the power of initiated men is both highly circumscribed yet radical: for it is the power, in effect, to periodically compel the community to "live" hierarchy within the delimited context of a ritual. All properly socialized individuals at Avatip acknowledge the mundane and ritual models are equally "real." But individuals do differ-and in fact the same individual can differ from one occasion to another-in the way they evaluate these constructs. Some initiated men tend to speak of everyday life, in ritual contexts at least, as a state of political disorganization per- vaded by a cloying and barely "social" domesticity. Some women, in everyday situations, tend to regard the rituals of the men's cult as an abrogation of many of the moral norms of kinship and potentially oppressive if continued for long. But these kinds of evaluations-and there are others-are labile and contextual, and are not "tied" rigidly to gender, age, or any other cri- terion. They are a most interesting subject, and statistical patterns would no doubt emerge from 422 american ethnologist</page><page sequence="11">an analysis of them. What I would emphasize, however, is that they cannot "explain" anything at all about Avatip culture or social structure. They are subjective responses to a particular social milieu and therefore presuppose its existence. What is important is that the nature of Avatip society is such as to present all individuals, to some degree or other, with a recurring dilemma of values in which their only guides are, ultimately, the ritual and secular ideologies themselves. This dilemma is a basic social fact; how individuals negotiate it is an important but analytically separate issue.5 conclusion I said at the beginning of this paper that in societies with male initiatory cults, the "cultural order" consists, minimally, of two distinct orders: one accessible to the society as a whole and the other accessible only to initiated males. One general suggestion I would like to put forward is that in cultural systems such as these, there will tend to be systematic differences in the way in which social relations between initiates and noninitiates are formulated symbolically at dif- ferent "levels" of the cultural corpus. Specifically, the "esoteric" levels will tend to emphasize social and cosmological polarities between the sexes and between seniors and juniors; moving "down" the hierarchy of representations toward those of a "public" nature, these polarities will tend progressively to diminish. The reason for this, I would argue, is that each symbolic domain expresses a particular social perspective specific to the category of persons with access to that domain. Men of a senior grade "perceive" a greater differential in ritual status between themselves and noninitiates than do men of a more junior grade, and it is this perspective that is crystallized in the religious representations exclusive to their initiatory level. Conversely, wholly "public" constructs-everyday "secular" folk models of kinship, descent, domestic roles, and so forth-will have a more egalitarian character, because they will tend to reflect what is common to the social experience of everyone, irrespective of their differences in ritual status. A second and related suggestion has to do with the social contexts in which mundane and ritual knowledge are used. To the extent that power is based on the control of ritual knowledge, it is likely, I suggest, to have a characteristic limitation. Social inequality will tend to manifest itself only in those contexts in which ritual knowledge is relevant, and in which the institution- alized exclusion of particular social categories from this knowledge is salient: that is, primarily in the setting of ritual itself. In contexts to which mundane knowledge applies-in situations calling for everyday, "practical" knowledge-social inequalities will tend contextually to "dis- solve" because these forms of knowledge are not subject to, and therefore do not "register," the structures of exclusion on which inequality is based. "Practical" and "ritual" discourse in these societies carry different metamessages about the nature of social relations: in one case an "egalitarian" metamessage, and in the other a "hierarchical" one (cf. Bloch 1977). If these suggestions are valid, a corollary is that in their everyday dealings with women and juniors, initiated men must perforce use relatively "egalitarian" forms of discourse. The hier- archy of ritual grades "exists" and everyone is aware of it, but the "language" of concepts the society uses (and must use) in mundane contexts is unable to "express" this in social action. The converse of this, I would argue, is also true. That is, that relations between the sexes, and between senior and junior males, actually are relatively relaxed, informal, and egalitarian in "secular" contexts; but that this fact is "muted," to borrow Ardener's (1975) term, in the sym- bolism of initiatory ritual, which is a language capable only of more or less extreme expressions of the idea of hierarchy. My third suggestion has to do with the role of ritual secrecy. One function of secrecy is, of course, to preserve the "scarcity value" of ritual knowledge. But secrecy may also be required in some cases because the ideological content of this knowledge is to some degree normatively ritual hierarchy and secular equality 423</page><page sequence="12">counter to the secular cultural ethos. Institutionalized secrecy is a prerequisite for the formu- lation and transmission, in specially "restricted" domains of the cultural order, of models con- trary to the public normative system; and wherever such secrecy exists it is, I think, worth ex- ploring the possibility that the ideology of ritual is in fact a counterideology. Avatip, like most Melanesian societies, is an uncentralized, small-scale polity without formal political office or hereditary rank; and, apart from the male cult itself, it is characterized by a generally "weak" development of structural inequality. My argument in this paper is that its male initiatory system is a political hierarchy existing in a permanent tension with, or antithesis to, an institutional and ideological bias toward egalitarianism in secular contexts. I have suggested that the symbolism of initiatory ritual is discordant with everyday social life. But there is one context in which social reality does correspond to the ritual "model": that is, when the ritual in question is actually being held. When men of the highest ritual grade perform a ritual at Avatip, for instance, the vision of "maximum hierarchy" contained in their shared ritual lore is "realized," temporarily, in social action. The society is polarized rigidly into ritual categories; an array of powerful taboos and prescriptions subordinate women and noninitiates to the performers and enforce a maximum of social distance between them. The spectrum of models-ranging from the mundane and "egalitarian," to the esoteric and "hierarchical"-are all equally "true": what they correspond to are different states of the social system along a processual cycle. What I want to entirely disavow here is a notion, encountered sometimes in anthropological interpretations of religion, that ritual simply "says" something about social or political rela- tions, as though ritual merely reflects or validates an independently existing institutional order. My approach is that an Avatip ritual brings into being a structure of social and political relations specific to that particular ritual; a structure altogether as "real" as the structure of everyday life, but simply different from it. The central privilege conferred by high ritual status is this: the priv- ilege of periodically taking part in ritually altering social reality into a form which "realizes" one's high status. From this point of view, ritual and everyday life are in one important respect entirely equiv- alent: they are both systems of collective action having a meaningful, communicative, or sym- bolic dimension. As a descriptive convenience, I have used the term "ritual" in this article to refer to the activities of the Avatip men's cult; but I nevertheless endorse the view of Leach (1954:12) that ritual, as an analytical category, is the communicative aspect of all or virtually all social behavior. Secular life at Avatip is a consensually maintained system of action and its symbolic dimension is "about" equality; rituals are systems of action imposed on the com- munity by men of a particular initiatory grade, and their symbolic dimension is "about" ine- quality. Everyday life at Avatip is just as much symbolic or expressive action as is ritual: it sim- ply has a different meaning. There is a tradition in anthropology according to which ritual and religion affirm axiomatic and collectively shared values. My argument is that these male initiatory cults call for quite a different paradigm. I suggest that the rituals of these cults are by their very nature dissonant, to some degree, with the social and cultural actualities of "normal" social life, and that this "skewing" increases as one considers successively more esoteric rituals within any given ini- tiatory system. The reason for this is that the performance of a ritual is not a manifestation of collective consensus, but of the coercive, yet highly circumscribed, power of a small group of men. The values displayed in ritual are distinctive to the cult itself; they are not, in any simple sense, subscribed to by the society as a whole or even by initiated men themselves outside the setting of ritual itself. Senior men may, in certain contexts, attribute an "ultimate" validity to their religious sacra (be these myths, cosmological notions, ritual techniques, and so forth) or speak of ritual as though it were an authoritative "model" of the social order. But it is important to treat these claims as simply part of the total range of sociocultural facts to be explained, and 424 american ethnologist</page><page sequence="13">not as a premise of one's own analysis. Otherwise, one misses their ideological significance and, indeed, succumbs to it. notes Acknowledgments. The fieldwork on which this article is based was carried out for 22 months between 1977 and 1979 under a Ph.D. scholarship in the Department of Prehistory and Anthropology of the Aus- tralian National University. I should like to express my gratitude to that institution for its financial support and many facilities. 1A social system with a number of striking parallels with Avatip has recently been described by Hill (1984) in an ethnoecological analysis of the Wakuenai of Venezuela. Hill argues that Wakuenai society alternates between two organizational modes, which he terms "social equality" and "ritual hierarchy," in response to severe seasonal fluctuations in environmental resources. I hope to discuss elsewhere the appl- icability of Hill's analysis to Avatip, with its similarly riverain adaptation. 2There are indications that comparable patterns may exist in some other Sepik societies. Tuzin (1982), for example, writing of the llahita Arapesh, speaks of domestic and cult life being governed by antithetical moral codes and of permanent ethical dilemmas this poses for initiated men; and Losche (1984) writes of Abelam husbands and wives sharing, in the privacy of their conjugal relations, utopian visions of a sexually egalitarian social order. 3M. Strathern (1980) makes a similar point concerning women's domestic roles in Mount Hagen in the New Guinea Highlands, in a discussion to which the present article owes much stimulus. 4For an account of the regional system of some of the societies downriver from Avatip, see Gewertz 1983. 5This dilemma is implicitly recognized as a primary datum of personal existence in the indigenous con- ception of personhood, a key construct of Avatip culture and one crucial to an understanding of Avatip social organization (see Harrison 1985). In effect, the conflict between "ritual hierarchy" and "secular equality" is represented as an opposition between two aspects or proclivities of the self; in other words, as an "inner" contradiction within human personhood and therefore as a part of an immutable "human na- ture." Society is simply apprehended as conforming to the unalterable constitution of the human person- ality. references cited Allen, Michael R. 1967 Male Cults and Secret Initiations in Melanesia.
