<plain_text><page sequence="1">122 NOTICES OF ROOKS Kingship. By A. M. Hocart. 9x6, pp. x, 250. Oxford University Press. London : Humphrey Milford, 1927. The author of this book begins his prologue by describing two parties of historians, " on the one hand those who deny that the same thing is ever invented twice, and therefore assert that if two customs in parts of the world ever so remote from one another show some resemblance, they must come from the same source " ; and, on the other, " the die-hards, mostly men of immaculate scholarship, who automatically turn down every attempt at tracing common origins with the equally confident assertion that similar ideas occur to men independently in different parts of the world." Mr. Hocart is a staunch adherent of the former party and gives to its principles an application so wide that the resemblances which he professes to find are not always apparent even to the careful student of his book. His theme is the system of ideas expressed by the term *' Divine Kingship ", an expression so vague as to include theories of kingship which are not only dissimilar but con flicting, but between which Mr. Hocart professes to trace resemblance. There is, for instance, the theory that a king is in some sense a god, as wrell as the theory that " there's a divinity doth hedge a king ", that a king is in a peculiar degree under diviue protection. Not only does Mr. Hocart appear to be unable to distinguish the contradiction betwreen these two theories ; he treats them as though they were identical. Even the fact that subjects have been known to pray for their kings is cited as evidence of the theory of the divinity of kings. It is not easy to understand how one who needs his subjects' prayers can be regarded as divine ; nor does the suggestion that the second verse of God Save the King is a relic of the days when kings were regarded as gods carry conviction with it. Mr. Hocart, in deciding to try the hypothesis of common origin deprecates the reluctance of some scholars and historians of high repute to go so far ; attributing it partly to a fear of losing caste by being confounded with " those wild men who</page><page sequence="2">KINGSHIP 123 seized upon the most superficial resemblances in every part of the world to prove that the Ten Lost Tribes of Israel had been there ". Let me hasten to disclaim any intention of confounding Mr. Hocart with the " wild men ". He has laboriously collected a mass of evidence, but he has manufactured none ; and he understands what evidence is, which is more than can be said of the " wild men ". But like all who set out to prove a theory he is prone to find evidence in facts the relevance of which is not easily perceptible to the open mind. The notions that a king is a god and that a king is the special object of divine protection, though cognate, are yet distinct, and it docs not follow that the second is derived from the first. In discussing the? King's Evil he is on firmer ground, but even here it is unsafe to assume the identity of the " divine kingship " theory with the view that the king is enabled by divine assistance to work a miracle. The most that can be said is that divine influence temporarily pervades the king's personality. The chapter on Ambrosia, containing a parallel between the Kucharist and ambrosia, kava, and soma will offend some, but the Christian mysteries cannot be exempted from inquiries into the history of religion. The analogy may be more rationally condemned for its imperfection. The question of ambrosia is obscure, but there can be little doubt that the virtues of kava and soma lay originally in their intoxicating properties. The same objection applies to the analysis of coronation ceremonies. It is inevitable that analogies should be traceable between initiation ceremonies among different peoples, but the suggestion that the coronation ceremonies of Christian monarchs have their origin in the initiation ceremonies of primitive peoples who believe that these symbolize the death of him who is called to be the king and his rebirth as a god is strained. It may be doubted, too, whether the Oriental is capable of abstracting a man from his office. At the darbar held at</page><page sequence="3">121 NOTICES OF ROOKS Delhi to commemorate King Edwards accession and coronation much wonder was expressed at the precedence of Lord Curzon, the Viceroy, over the King's brother. This attitude surely displayed an inability to identify the man with his office. The pedigree on p. 159 is not easily comprehensible. The ceremonies of Coronation, Ordination, and Initiation are exhibited as being derived from the ceremony of Installation, but the tree shows Coronation and Ordination as being more closely linked together than is either with Initiation ; yet all three are shown as the offspring of Installation, and are therefore sister ceremonies. The pedigree form is evidently intended to make the relationship clear. All that it does is to confound it. The attribution of the anthropomorphism of the Hindus to Creek influence will commend itself to few students. It should not be difficult to show that anthropomorphism is older than any recorded intercourse between Greece and India. The anthropomorphism of the Greeks is indeed gross and absurd, but its grossness and absurdity do not approach those of Hindu mythology, between which and that of the Greeks the difference is one of kind rather than of degree. .Mr. Hocart's argument that ceremonies in the course of time so lose their signification, and, consequently, essential details, as to become unrecognizable is certainly one explanation of the discrepancies which he either brushes aside as unimportant or attempts to reconcile, but most will seek the simpler explanation that the various ceremonies differ essentially. These remarks are not intended to suggest that Mr. Hocart has not written an interesting book containing valuable material, for he has. He defines his book as an attempt at applying to customs and beliefs the methods that have been so successful in the study of language. As a first attempt it is, as he admits, crude ; but as a first attempt it is also a very creditable performance, and it is to be hoped that the author will develop his theories more fully at a later date.
