<plain_text><page sequence="1">Arnold's Version of Transcendence-the Via Poetica Nathan A. Scott, Jr. / University of Virginia By the England over which Victoria presided we are bequeathed but three religious thinkers-John Henry Newman, Frederick Denison Maurice, and Matthew Arnold-who, by reason of the relevance of their legacies to contemporary discussions, appear to be genuinely living guides; and it is a considerable oddity of modern intellectual life that Arnold who is, of this great trio, the most truly prophetic figure should, from his own time unto ours, have been regularly responded to in a hostile and dismissive way. Paul Ricoeur suggests that the hermeneutics of culture in the modern period may be thought of as having had two great styles, the one being determined by an intention to demystify received traditions and the other being distinguished by an intention to rehabilitate and salvage a heritage of proclamation and kerygma: he speaks of the former as "the school of suspicion" and of the latter as "the school of restoration."' And we will have no difficulty in assigning Marx and Nietzsche and Freud, on the one hand, or Newman and Karl Barth and Reinhold Niebuhr, on the other, to their proper spheres. But Arnold's career, like that of Rudolf Bultmann or Paul Tillich, resists being situated wholly on either side of the divide between a hermeneutic of suspicion and a hermeneutic of restoration, since it was committed at once to a project of iconoclasm and a project of retrieval. On the one hand, as he considered the condition of the Christian faith in the nineteenth century, he found himself confront- ing a religion which had "materialized itself in the fact, in the supposed fact," which had "attached its emotion to the fact, and now," as he said, "the fact is failing it"2-which meant, he felt, that candor required the exposure of how vaporous and illusory indeed was the "fact" on which orthodoxy had for so long been wont to rest its case. But, then, he was equally convinced that the real genius of the witness made by the Chris- 'Paul Ricoeur, Freud and Philosophy, trans.

So, for all his concern to explode the old notions of literal inspiration in Scripture and to fashion a new version of the theologia perennis, it was with good reason that Arnold declared his to be "an attempt conservative, and an attempt religious."3 Indeed, it is just his way of uniting "suspicion" and "restoration" that nettled his contemporaries and that, as it would seem, is still felt to be his great offense. His radical friends on the Continent regarded his "at- tempt conservative . . . and .. . religious" as a timorous evasion of what was exigent in the religious situation of the time. And the champions of conventional orthodoxy were prepared to ask of Matthew Arnold as Newman had asked of Thomas Arnold, his father, "But is he a Chris- tian?" In short, as he himself might have said (with one of his favorite Germanisms), the Zeitgeist was against him. And so, in some ways, it has remained ever since. The religious despisers of culture, of course, oc- cupy pretty much the same ground today that they occupied a hundred years ago-though, to be sure, amongst the cultured despisers of reli- gion a certain shift of position is sometimes observable, for, now, their preference seems often to be for a religion which, in resting on some form of the credo quia absurdum, invites dismayed bemusement over its immolation of intelligence: whereas (as I have elsewhere remarked) "when they confront a religion which is affirmative of the vitalities of culture and which looks toward some reciprocity between itself and those vitalities, they indignantly declare it to be a fraud,"4 and there is much condescending talk about what a pity it is that the authentic sub- stance of religion is by way of being scuttled. So it is not altogether strange that, falling between these lines of force, the author of St. Paul and Protestantism (1870) and Literature and Dogma (1873) and God and the Bible (1875) should be in some degree a casualty of a climate which over the past hundred years, in matters related to the religious enterprise, has tended (in both its secular and traditionalist quarters) to be intolerant of the particular platform Arnold elected- namely, that of conservative reform. And the animus of F. H. Bradley and T. S. Eliot-that he was merely engaged in "phrase-making" and "literary clap-trap,"5 and that the phrase-making involved a deplorable 3Matthew Arnold, "Preface," God and the Bible (New York: Macmillan &amp; Co., 1913), p. xli. 4Nathan A.

Indeed, so much is this the case that one might be fairly confident in placing a large bet on his work having never been seriously consulted by that avant-garde within con- temporary theology whose program, nearly forty years after Bultmann's launching of his Entmythologisierung, is perforce, however much Bultmann's scheme may be deemed requiring of modification, essentially his: which is to say that it is also that of Matthew Arnold, who may rightly be claimed to be the first major specialist of the modern period in "demythologization." There were, of course, others before Arnold-most notably perhaps, the "left wing" Hegelians David Friedrich Strauss and Ludwig Feuer- bach, and those who followed in their line-who had undertaken in various ways to "naturalize" the Christian mythos, but it is Arnold's distinction to have attempted a reinterpretation of the Christian faith that aspired after a systematic consistency with those texts in which that faith finds its classical expression. True, his account of the animating intentionality of the biblical witness will now seem egregiously mistaken, but he did, nevertheless-unlike so many of the new radicals of his period-take it for granted that theological reconstruction, audacious as it needed to be, must be able to claim an essential continuity between its own forms and those of the original Christian witness, if, Christianly speaking, it is to carry any force. And it is his steadfast adherence to this fundamental assumption that, given the whole drift and aim of his theological program, makes him Bultmann's great progenitor in the nineteenth century. In, as he called it, an "iron time / Of doubts, disputes, distractions, fears,"7 Arnold found himself compelled to acknowledge that "There is not a creed which is not shaken, not an accredited dogma which is not shown to be questionable, not a received tradition which does not threaten to dissolve."8 Yet, though pilgriming "between two worlds, one dead, / The other powerless to be born,"9 this "foil'd circuitous wan- derer" was keen enough to know that, nigh unto the end of the modern age, "two things about the Christian religion must surely be clear to anybody with eyes in his head"-the one being "that men cannot do without it; the other, that they cannot do with it as it is."10 But, as he listened to the buzz and hum of all the new gospels and 6T.

The extraordinary advances being realized by the new science and technology were-with the help of an H. T. Buckle, a T. H. Huxley, a Herbert Spencer-fast intimidating the people of the age into identifying "reality" with the public operables comprising the physical world and "truth" with those verifiable asser- tions purporting to describe that reality. In short, given the collapse of traditional systems of belief, his contemporaries were, he felt, at the point of finding in science itself a beeline to a new metaphysical orienta- tion, being prepared to regard the "certified" procedures of empirical inquiry as the one really valid way of escaping from the illusionism of outworn creeds. And Arnold knew that, were such a positivism to be- come triumphant in that part of our culture where assumption rules, it would have a blighting effect not only on religion but on that whole field of valuation which is in fact beyond the range of scientific judgment. So nothing more quickly stirred up his asperities than some precipitous and self-assured apologetic for modern scientism. In this regard, his witness was so frequently made from the standpoint of his concern for the conservation of literary values that we are often by way of assuming that his literary essays carry the main current of his work and that his theological authorship represents merely the musings of "a man of let- ters who occasionally forgot himself to the extent of writing books about religion."" But, as Basil Willey reminds us, this is quite seriously "to misconceive the true proportions of his work ... [and] to miss his centre of gravity,"'2 for in point of fact he was most centrally concerned to defend the life of the imagination, whether in its aesthetic or its religious phases, against the imperialistic claims of modern positivistic science. And thus his theological work is deeply of a piece with his entire critical effort. As one committed, however, to conservative reform, Arnold wanted in the 1870s to submit the received theological tradition to a very drastic surgery. He was convinced that, on the cardinal point, the conception of deity projected by traditional theistic supernaturalism-of "a great Per- sonal First Cause," a "moral and intelligent Governor of the Universe,"13 "a sort of magnified and non-natural man"'4-was like a currency which, though once negotiable, has lost its cash value: even, in the term that Basil Willey, Nineteenth Century Studies: Coleridge to Matthew Arnold (London: Chatto &amp; Windus, 1949), p. 252. 12Ibid.

"The masses, with their rude practical instinct, go straight to the heart of the matter. They are told there is a great Personal First Cause, who thinks and loves, the moral and intelligent Author and Governor of the universe; and that the Bible and Bible-righteousness come to us from him. Now ... they begin by asking what proof we have of him at all," for "they require to be able to ascertain that there is this Governor..."16 And, at least in this particular, Arnold was inclined to feel that the masses were far more clearheaded than a Wilberforce or a Pusey or even a Martineau would have allowed, since with him it was axiomatic that any theological account of the meaning of human existence must, if it is to have cogency, find its primal ground in the actualities of man's experi- ence. Religion begins as he insists over and over again, "with experi- ence," with experience of "the Eternal not ourselves"; and whatever offers itself in the way of a theological proposition, if lacking any expe- riential basis, will manifestly fail to prove itself. When the Psalmist, in dwelling on the joy and peace that come from righteousness, says: "Thou art my hiding-place, thou shalt preserve me from trouble; if my delight had not been in thy law, I should have perished in my trouble"-he is speaking not as a mystagogue, for his declarations spring "from experience." Or when St. Paul meditates on the mystery of ne- crosis, on how "to die with Christ to the law of the flesh ... [is] to live with Christ to the law of the mind," again, he is not spouting "mere theurgy,"17 since the renewing power of identification with Christ has, as Arnold sees it (and as Ignatius of Loyola had seen it long before), proved itself in the rhythms of Christian experience. But Arnold's estimate of modern sensibility told him that, increasingly, all the metaphysical pon- tifications of "learned religion" about the "great Personal First Cause" were, indeed-for Mr. Higginbottom and Mrs. Stiggins and Mr. Bugg-but so much "theurgy." The doctors of theological science, he says, ". . . employ the word God with such extraordinary confidence! as if 'a Great Personal First Cause, who thinks and loves, the moral and in- telligent Governor of the Universe,' were a verifiable fact beyond all question; and we had now only to discuss what such a being would naturally think about Church vestments and the use of the Athanasian Creed. But everything people say, under these conditions, is in truth quite in the air."18 '5Literature and Dogma, p. 282. 16Ibid., pp. 287-88. 'St. Paul and Protestantism, p. 62. 8Literature and Dogma, p. 296. 265</page><page sequence="6">The Journal of Religion In short, the first principle governing Arnold's reflections, on religion-and in this he is happily joined by virtually every major theolo- gian of our own period-is that it is utterly futile for a system of faith to employ modes of thought that contradict the fundamental experience of the people of our age. And since he knew that his contemporaries- living in the world of Charles Darwin and James Clerk Maxwell and Michael Faraday and Samuel Morse-were increasingly baffled by the notion of some sort of immutable, self-subsistent Being who, as the di- vine pantokrator, controls the universe from "up there," he felt certain that this was a piece of metaphysical lumber (or, as he called it, a "piece of science,"19 meaning pseudo-science) that must simply be relegated to the discard. Though he is frequently taxed with having done so, Arnold was by no means, however, proposing, in the manner of Feuerbach, to convert "theology" without remainder into "anthropology." Indeed, the most basic reason for his impatience with traditional theism was that its doc- trine of the ens realissimum, of the deus faber, did, as he felt, inevitably promote a kind of anthropomorphism that, at the level of theos, has the effect of nullifying what is radically transcendent in the ultimate other- ness we descry (in Gerard Manley Hopkins's phrase) "deep down things"-so that we end up talking about "the Eternal not ourselves" as if it were "a man in the next street"20 or "a sort of elder Lord Shaftesbury ... infinitely magnified."21 And thus to trust the anthropomorphic image for the handling of the question of transcendence is, as Arnold believed, very radically to misconceive that inexhaustible depth and ground of reality with which the religious imagination is actually engaged. For God-and "God," as he reminds us, is but a name22-is not "an infinite and eternal substance" or "the great first cause"23 but "the Eternal not ourselves that makes for righteousness": which is to say that, for Arnold, the referent of the monosyllable "God" is that prevenient reality (what- ever it may be)-transcendentally other than ourselves-which faith dis- cerns as assembling and holding together our world in such a way as permits us to feel that it is basicallyfor us rather than against us. And he wants very much to insist on the "not ourselves," for, with him, again, it is a first principle that, ultimately, the religious enterprise concerns noth- ing that is a part of our own human equipment but has to do, rather, with something that is totaliter aliter-and which is to be spoken about (as it would be put in the ugly jargon of our own period) in a "non- objectifying" way. 19Ibid., p. 295. 20St. Paul and Protestantism, p. 7. 21Literature and Dogma, p. 283. 22Ibid., pp. 9-11. 23Ibid., p. 12. 266</page><page sequence="7">Arnold's Version of Transcendence But the surgery to which Arnold was proposing to submit the theologia perennis was by no means limited to the cardinal premise of traditional theism. For his project also involved, in one of its most essential ele- ments, a liberation of the Christian message from the mythological forms in which the biblical testimony embeds it. Given his dedication to "an attempt conservative and an attempt religious," he did not, of course, suppose that reconstruction could simply dispense with the bibli- cal witness, for, in his own peculiar way, he wanted to give his suffrage to something like the traditional view of theology as ministerium verbi divini. He seems always to have felt, in other words, that any theological pro- gram claiming to set forth an authentic account of the Christian faith must seek not to cast aside the mythological forms of the biblical kerygma but, rather, to reinterpret them. And, indeed, his impatience with critical work in the mode of Bishop John Colenso24 was, at bottom, due to his sense of its being merely negative and of its being calculated therefore to do little more, finally, than raise "a titter from educated Europe."25 Yet, though he could not find in Colenso's The Pentateuch and Book of Joshua Critically Examined the requisite "tact" and "delicacy of perception," he was in no doubt at all about the necessity of a radical critique, for he was convinced that, unless the Christian Scriptures could be rescued from the clutches of Protestant bibliolatry, "a spirit of sober piety" stood no chance of surviving the corrosions of a secular age. And, here, we are brought back to Arnold's word about the spiritual crisis of the age being consequent upon religion having "materialized itself in the fact, in the supposed fact," which "is [now] failing it." For this is the crucial formula on which he grounds his diagnosis of what is problematic in the modern situation. He is saying that the great mistake made by nineteenth-century Christianity, and indeed by the whole pre- cedent tradition, has been that of taking the Christian message to be a system of objective truths about the universe, and this a system being supposed to have the status of fact as "fact" is conceived by empirical science. But now, says Arnold, this system is "failing," as modern scien- tific inquiry increasingly exposes the speciousness of its "factuality"-and the result is that "There is not a creed which is not shaken, not an accredited dogma which is not shown to be questionable, not a received tradition which does not threaten to dissolve." So, as he concluded, since something in us still vibrates to the essential story that Christianity tells about humankind, what is required is a bold new hermeneutical stratagem that, by cutting beneath the rigidified integuments of archaic myth, will reach the irrefragable truth in the Christian vision and render it invulnerable before any further meddling of scientific criticism. 24Matthew Arnold, "The Bishop and the Philosopher," Macmillan's Magazine, vol. 7, no. 39 (January 1863). 25Ibid., p. 241. 267</page><page sequence="8">The Journal of Religion Though Arnold in none of his writings is to be found to be a genuinely systematic thinker, it is in Literature and Dogma that he gives us the largest account of his program. Yet already, three years earlier, in his book of 1870, St. Paul and Protestantism, he is disclosing the kind of tack that he was consistently to take. For, here, it becomes apparent that he considers a hermeneutic of religion relevant to the modern scene necessarily to be one centrally focused on the problem of language. Which is not to say that Arnold is to be found advancing anything that, in these post- Wittgensteinian days of our misery, stands a chance of being regarded as a genuinely rigorous theory of language. But at least he saw with great clarity what must surely be the starting point of any such theory: namely, the recognition that, in its most fundamental semantic aspect, language has two main uses-which are (in the formulation of the late Philip Wheelwright) "to designate clearly as a means to efficient communica- tion, and to express with maximum fullness."26 Or, as Arnold would phrase it more simply, language may be used in a "scientific" way and in a "literary" way, and, as he began to argue in St. Paul and Protestantism, what has chiefly bedevilled Christian theological discourse in the modern period has been its persistence in attributing a "scientific" character to the "literary" language of religion. The distinguished French Orientalist Ernest Renan was contending in his book of 1869 on St. Paul that, though, thanks to the efforts of Protes- tantism, he had long reigned as "the Christian doctor par excellence," his reign was at last coming to an end. But, no, says Arnold: though the Protestantism which has advanced its own interests by exploiting Paul may be coming to an end, "... the reign of the real St. Paul is only beginning; his fundamental ideas, disengaged from the elaborate mis- conceptions with which Protestantism has overlaid them, will have an influence in the future greater than any which they have yet had,-an influence proportioned to their correspondence with a number of the deepest and most permanent facts of human nature itself."27 And thus "the needful thing is ... to rescue St. Paul" from Protestantism, or, as Arnold normally prefers to say, from "Puritanism," since he takes Puritanism, particularly in its Calvinist and Arminian forms, to be in the English-speaking world "the strong and special representative of Protes- tantism."28 The Puritan scheme-with its covenants of works and redemption, and its elaborate protocols of original sin and justification through im- puted righteousness and predestination-is, as Arnold views it, distin- guished above all else by the assurance with which it sets forth the many '2Philip Wheelwright, The Burning Fountain: A Study in the Language of Symbolism (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1954), p. 25. 27St. Paul and Protestantism, p. 2. 28Ibid. 268</page><page sequence="9">Arnold's Version of Transcendence complicated arrangements contrived by God for the settlement of human destiny. Indeed, its way of rendering Heilsgeschichte in terms of an exceedingly intricate "machinery of covenants, conditions, bargains, and parties-contractors . .. could have proceeded from no one but the born Anglo-Saxon man of business, British or American."29 Nor is it content with its own doctrinal ingeniousness: on the contrary, it wants very much to insist that its protocols are supported by the authority of St. Paul. And it is just here that a certain mischief is made, for what in St. Paul is trope and dramatic gesture the doctors of Protestantism convert into "scientific" propositions. The ancient Hebraic community, Arnold suggests, had "a much juster sense of the true scope and limits of diction in religious deliverances than we have,"30 had indeed in its religious statements a veritable genius for a powerfully evocative poetic language: "so, to describe the vivid and figured way in which St. Paul ... uses words," he speaks of him as "Orientalising."31 When the biblical people, for example, say, "God is jealous, and the Lord revengeth" (Nahum 1:2), they are not aiming at a "scientific theology," no more than is Aeschylus in one of his great choric passages on guilt and destiny: no, they are "Orientalising." Or, similarly, when St. Paul tells us that "as by the of- fense of one judgment came upon all... even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life" (Romans 5:18), he, too, is "Orientalising," using as a vivid figure of rhetoric what the authors of the Westminster Confession use as a formal scientific proposition. And so it is, Arnold contends, with the language of the Bible in gen- eral, as it also is with the entire range of what is today spoken of as the "first order" discourse of the religious imagination: it is a mythopoeic language characteristically lyrical and dramatic, and thus (in a word of Wilbur Marshall Urban's of which Arnold would have approved) "to lose the vis poetica is at the same time to lose the vis religiosa. "32 "The language of the Bible, then," says Arnold, "is literary, not scien- tific language"-and so it is generally, as he would lay it down, with the "first order" language minted by the religious imagination: it is "lan- guage thrown out at an object of consciousness not fully grasped, which inspired emotion."33 Indeed, as he urges, "the [very] word 'God' is used in most cases as by no means a term of science or exact knowledge, but a term of poetry and eloquence, a term thrown out, so to speak, at a not fully grasped object of the speaker's consciousness, a literary term, in 29Ibid., p. 14. 30Ibid., p. 24. 31Ibid., pp. 25-26. 32Wilbur Marshall Urban, Language and Reality (London: George Allen &amp; Unwin, 1939), p. 575. 33Literature and Dogma, p. 36. 269</page><page sequence="10">The Journal of Religion short; and mankind mean different things by it as their consciousness differs."34 True, the metaphysicians and theologians convert the literary term into a scientific term when they begin to speak of God as "an infinite and eternal substance, and [as] at the same time a person, the great first cause, the moral and intelligent governor of the universe."35 But what Arnold calls "religion given"-this is, religion in its "first order" mode-finds its most essential medium, he insists, not in the con- structions of metaphysics and "scientific theology" but in the vaulting movement of the poetic imagination toward what Rudolf Otto was later to speak of as the mysterium tremendum et fascinans36 (and what Arnold himself speaks of as "the Eternal not ourselves"). Indeed, man's tendency is "always to represent everything under his own figure,"37 and thus the biblical people, as they meditated on that "dearest freshness deep down things," spoke of the Eternal as a Father, as the high and holy One who formed the earth and the world, as the Rock of our salvation who hears our cries and attends unto our prayers and whose mercy is from everlasting to everlasting. The Psalmist, for example, says: "The Lord is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? the Lord is the strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid? .... The Lord is my strength and my shield; my heart trusted in him, and I am helped . . ." And all this, says Arnold (in the term he appropriates from Goethe), is Aberglaube, or "extra-belief." The immediate fact of experience is "the Eternal not ourselves," the mysterium tremendum et fascinans-or, as he likes to put it, "the stream of tendency by which all things fulfill the law of their being."38 But this not ourselves, this stream of tendency-which, as conceived by Arnold, may not be too far distant from the neoclassical theism of such thinkers as Alfred North Whitehead and Charles Hartshorne-does not become what Coleridge called a "living educt of the Imagination"39 until it takes on that special kind of translu- cence which is bestowed upon it in some great Aberglaube through the agency of theo-poiesis.40 "Extra-belief, that which we hope, augur, imagine, is the poetry of life, and has the rights of poetry. But it is not science; and yet it tends always to imagine itself science, to substitute itself for science,"41 and thus it 34Ibid., pp. 10-11. 35Ibid., p. 12. 36Rudolf Otto, The Idea of the Holy, trans.

Most especially does Arnold consider it to be necessary to submit the Christian Scriptures to interpretation, since he takes it for granted that the primitive apostolic testimony is but a witness to the true Word-which is none other than the event of Jesus Christ. Protestant bibliolatry, to be sure, absolutizes the original preaching of this Word which is recorded in the New Testament canon, but the real object of this preaching, as Arnold supposes, was incarnate in Jesus of Nazareth. So he assumes that cutting to the bone of Aberglaube, of the "extra-belief" in which the apostolic testimony is embedded, is something that is implicitly warranted by the very logic of the Christian kerygma itself. Now it is onjust this point that Arnold is very severely reprehended by one of his recent interpreters, Stephen Prickett, who argues that Ar- nold's basic hermeneutical position is riddled with incoherence and self- contradiction. For, says Mr. Prickett, Arnold's accordance of priority in the religious enterprise to the poetic imagination must necessarily com- mit him to a view of the poetic process as yielding insights that can be come by in no other way and that are indeed inseparable from their poetic form: "poetry" and the "truth" it apprehends must be held to be indivisible. But Arnold is in fact, as he insists, finally to be found electing quite a different view of the matter, since he is in effect by way of supposing that that which "lies behind poetry ... can be distilled from it; the kernel can be broken from out of the shell."42 And thus, as Mr. Prickett contends, "What Arnold calls the 'concrete' world of poetry and of religious language finally becomes a mere visible manifestation of an abstract 'reality,' encompassed by scientific laws and non-figurative philosophic language."43 Such an objection to Arnold's procedure does itself, however, surely rest on a profound misconstruction of how it is that the "primal think- ing" of the poetic imagination is properly to be appropriated in an age (as Arnold would have said) of "criticism." Mr. Prickett's assumption seems to be that it is rightly esteemed only when it is left uninterpreted and, as it were, unbroken. And, in this, he is no doubt joined by what occasionally appears in our own period to be a very considerable adver- sary movement harboring a great animus toward the whole enterprise of "interpretation." Interpretation, as Susan Sontag was saying some years ago (in a book significantly entitled Against Interpretation), tends in- evitably to "deplete" the poetic universe and to set up what is merely "a shadow world of 'meanings.' "44 It is, she contended, "the revenge of the intellect" on the world of the imagination: so her whole testimony lined 42Stephen Prickett, Romanticism and Religion: The Tradition of Coleridge and Wordsworth in the Victorian Church (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1976), p. 221. 43Ibid., p. 222. 44Susan Sontag, Against Interpretation (New York: Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, 1966), p. 7. 271</page><page sequence="12">The Journal of Religion itself up behind a manifesto which said, "In place of a hermeneutics we need an erotics of art."45 And, weary as we may often now feel in this "post-critical" time of all the philology and exegesis that are a part of the weight of our modern inheritance, Miss Sontag's animadversions doubt- less touch with some poignance one fiber of contemporary sensibility. Yet, finally, there is no escaping the fact that the deliverances of the poetic imagination do give rise to thought:46 language-itself already drenched, by reason of its own nature, in the Idea-is, after all, the agency whereby they are set forth, and their most essential matiere is nothing other than the stuff of human experience: so they "push toward speculative expression."47 And most especially is this so with respect to the kind of material Arnold is handling in his theological essays- namely, those poetic representations that constitute a "language of avowal"48 consequent upon an immediate encounter of a "pre-critical" people with the Sacred. For it is a part of "the distress of modernity,"49 a part of its deep pathos, that we, having lived through the adventure of the Enlightenment and all that has followed in its wake, cannot stand (if unendowed with what is a most rare genius now for the naked encounter with religious reality) where the ancient doxologist who stuttered forth the 90th Psalm stood- Lord, thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations. Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hadst formed the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting, thou art God. This primitive naivete of the religious imagination is simply not any longer available to those whose consciousness has been scored by the legacies of Descartes and Hume and Kant and Nietzsche and Freud and Wittgenstein. Which is not, though, to say anything like what the young Dionysiacs of American "radical theology" in the 1960s were saying, that we live in a "secular city" that belongs to a time post mortem dei: it is, rather, to say, as Paul Ricoeur has so constantly insisted in these past years, that we are in a situation that requires us to aim not (by dint of some sacrificium intellectus) at the primitive naivete of archaic man but at the "second naivete . . . [which is] the postcritical equivalent of the pre- critical hierophany,"50 and this of course being an achievement of inter- pretation, of "restoration," of hermeneutics-since "we are in every way 45Ibid., p. 14. 46I am here, of course, rephrasing the old maxim in Kant's Critique of Judgment that Paul Ricoeur has lately given currency in many of his writings: "The symbol gives rise to thought." 47Ricoeur, Freud and Philosophy, p. 39. 48The phrase is Paul Ricoeur's, and it is used recurrently in The Symbolism of Evil (trans.

[must, therefore] seek to go beyond criti- cism by means of criticism, by a criticism that is no longer reductive but restorative."51 Now it is this "distress of modernity" that Arnold deeply understood. But, good hermeneut that he was, he never supposed that the interpreter posits the really decisive meanings and that the "language of avowal" is at last simply to be eliminated. On the contrary: he expects "the total man" never to allow his "Hellenism" to overmaster his "Hebraism," since, in our own late time, Glaube must necessarily be a refinement of Aberglaube. The reconstruction of the Christian message, for all the pertinence we may desire it to have to modern experience, must, in other words, begin with the testimony of the biblical people: as he says in a significant passage in Literature and Dogma, we must "take their fact of experience, ... keep it steadily for our basis in using their language, and . . . see whether from using their language with the ground of this real and firm sense to it, as they themselves did, somewhat of their feeling, too, may not grow upon us."52 In short, Arnold takes it for granted (pace Mr. Prickett) that the Aberglaube of the mythopoeic imagination constitutes "the unsubstitutable language of... [that] domain of experience that we . . call the experience of 'avowal.' "53 True, he refused to accord it any sort of talismanic status, for, as he protested, "after all, the Bible is not a talisman, to be taken and used literally."54 But, nevertheless, he wanted to live within the aura of the biblical witness, steeped in Aberglaube as it may be, and his whole effort as an interpreter was calculated (whether successfully so being another question) to keep a strict continuity be- tween his own reformulations and the original testimony, for, as he felt, the great thing which is never to be forgotten is that "Poetry gives the idea, and it gives it touched with beauty, heightened by emotion."55 It is, then, by no means quite the case, as Stephen Prickett argues, that Arnold "constantly finds himself in the position of ... attributing to poetry an importance ... that his theory demands should be attached to the abstract concepts"56 that may be extrapolated from poetry. Far from it: on the contrary, so paramount is the role that he accords the poetic imagination in the religious enterprise that it may, indeed, be said to be for him the very means of transcendence, the vital agent whereby men first "hail" the numinous, the mysterium tremendum, the not ourselves. And he is thus a major figure in that modern tradition reaching from Vico to 51Ibid., p. 350. 52Literature and Dogma, p. 52. 53Paul Ricoeur, The Conflict of Interpretations: Essays in Hermeneutics, ed.

Moreover, it is just in that aspect of his thought being reviewed here that we are to locate Arnold's immense relevance to the theological fer- ment of our own period. For ours is, of course, a time in which much of the most creative intelligence is, in one way or another, seeking to take what the avant-garde in German theology calls ein Schritt ziiruck ("a step backward") behind the hardened protocols of theological tradition, in order newly to experience that primitive enthrallment by "the Eternal not ourselves" which originally gave birth to theological reflection. And, in its effort once again to become a truly "foundational" discipline, it is not surprising that recent theology should be rediscovering, as it fre- quently is, the peculiar talent of the poetic imagination for being an agency of primary truth. In this, it is doubtless the late Martin Heidegger who has been the most influential guide, but, long before this great sage began to issue such texts as Erliiuterungen zu Hblderlins Dichtung and Uber den Humanismus and Holzwege from the fastnesses of his little mountain village of Todtnauberg in West Germany's Black Forest, Matthew Ar- nold in the 1870s was undertaking-with, as it would seem when he is thought of in the context of his own period, even greater audacity-to suggest how inevitably and inseverably religion is grounded in the poetic imagination; and his theological essays surely deserve a far more sym- pathetic reading than they have generally received. Nor will a really close reading of Arnold sustain the frequently iter- ated charge that his is a poetic that, in its tendency to promote a religio poetae, looks toward thefin-de-siecle aestheticism of the nineties. Among recent commentators, it is William Madden who perhaps most forcefully brings forward this stricture, though he is but one of many others who have voiced a similar judgment.58 And, admittedly, many of Arnold's aper(us lend themselves to such an interpretation-as, for example, the famous opening line of the essay on "The Study of Poetry" which says: "The future of poetry is immense, because in poetry, where it is worthy of its high destinies, our race, as time goes on, will find an ever surer and 57The term is Philip Wheelwright's, The Burning Fountain, pp. 27-28. 58See William A.

[of] fortifying, and elevating, and quickening"60 us. But, though one may assemble a sizable number of passages in this mode, his intention surely is never to endorse such a religion of poetry as was later to be promoted by such figures as Walter Pater and Oscar Wilde and the young Yeats. The Wordsworthian strain in Arnold's thought is, of course, one of its most persistent ele- ments, and he keeps always a strong sense of the healing and consolatory power of poetry. But, finally, he is not proposing to sponsor a new religion-of "the best that has been thought and said in the world" by its great poets; nor is he intending to offer poetry as a surrogate for the old religion of the prophets and the apostles. He wants, rather, to assign the poetic imagination merely a Virgilian function, as that which brings us into the precincts of the not ourselves-by (if the neologism may be per- mitted) deconcealing it, in the way that anything is made manifest when it is addressed by a language appropriate to its nature; and he assumes-as in varying ways Coleridge and Keble and Newman had done before him-that it is, indeed, in the language of the poetic imagination that the religious consciousness finds its primary vehicle. But, then, beyond their various other strictures, Arnold's numerous hostile critics add the charge that, yes, with him religion is an affair of mere poeticizing and that he disallows any genuinely veridical claim in behalf of what it says. T. S. Eliot, for example, who was incorrigibly resistant to his testimony, laid it down that his books about Christianity "aim ... to affirm that the emotions of Christianity can and must be preserved without the belief"; that he wants "to get all the emotional kick out of Christianity one can, without the bother of believing it"; and that "the effect of Arnold's religious campaign is to divorce Religion from thought."61 Or, again, the late Lionel Trilling, in his handsomely de- signed book on Arnold, having convinced himself that the author of Literature and Dogma is by way of regarding religious discourse as a mat- ter of mere poeticizing, says, in a particularly stringent passage: "That Christianity is true: that is, after all, the one thing that Arnold cannot really say. That Christianity contains the highest moral law, that Chris- tianity is natural, that Christianity is lovely, that Christianity provides a poetry serving the highest good, that Christianity contains the truth- anything but that Christianity is true."62 So Trilling suggests in effect that we think of Arnold as a type of that modernist whom Santayana (think- 5g"The Study of Poetry" (n. 2 above), p. 1. 60Matthew Arnold, Discourses in America (New York: Macmillan &amp; Co., 1902), p. 123. 61T.

A. Richards was advancing in his famous early book, Science and Poetry.66 Now in Richards's scheme-which was, of course, an arrantly positivist scheme-the "pseudo-statement" is one for which, in contrast to the "certified statements" of scientific discourse, no veridical claim can be made, since (in his definition of it) it is "a form of words which is justified entirely by its effect in releasing or organizing our impulses and at- titudes."67 But nothing could be further from Arnold's understanding of religious discourse (or, more particularly, of Christian theological dis- course) than Richards's notion of the pseudo-statement. "That Chris- tianity is true: that is, after all, the one thing," Trilling maintains, "that Arnold cannot really say." Yet this, as one needs to insist, is precisely what he wants most to assert-namely, what he speaks of over and again in the Last Essays on Church and Religion as "the natural truth of Chris- tianity." Liberalism was, he felt, increasingly tending to think of Chris- tianity as untenable. "And therefore is it so all-important," he says, "to insist on what I call the natural truth of Christianity, and to bring this out all we can."68 "I believe," he asserts in a characteristic sentence, "that Christianity will survive because of its natural truth."69 And, in this, he was greatly enheartened by the tradition reaching from Hooker and the Cambridge Platonists through Bishop Butler to Coleridge.70 For it was in this line of thought that he found support for his own view, that the truth of Christianity proves itself in experience, by the way it comports with "'our natural sense of things.' "71 When Arnold spoke of "the natural truth of Christianity," he did not, in other words, have in mind the "natural religion" of any sort of deism, 63George Santayana, Winds of Doctrine (New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1926), p. 49. 64Willey (n. 11 above), chap. 10. 65Basil Willey, "Arnold and Religious Thought," in Matthew Arnold, ed.

When "they ask: 'How are we to verify that there rules an enduring Power, not ourselves, which makes for righteousness?'-we may answer at once: 'How? why as you verify that fire burns,-by experience! It is so; try it! you can try it. ...' "73 We hear the word 'verifiable' from Mr. Arnold pretty often," said F. H. Bradley with much disdain; but, as he declared, "such a tyro's question" as to what verification really entails it never occurred to him to raise.74 Yet Arnold's position is by no means so naive as Bradley (and Trilling after him) would make it out to be, and, as Professor Robbins rightly suggests, it may in fact, for all the informality of its exposition, be seen as anticipating the "radical empiricism" of William James,75 as it may also be felt to look toward the kind of empiri- cal theology which on the American scene is associated with such think- ers as Henry Nelson Wieman and Bernard Meland, Charles Hartshorne and Schubert Ogden. But, certain though he was of the "natural truth" of Christianity, Ar- nold was never for a moment by way of confusing this "natural truth" with scientific truth. Always, his contention is in effect that the mythopoeic language of religion is to be taken, as Reinhold Niebuhr was proposing in his Gifford Lectures-"seriously but not literally."76 It is language "thrown out" at a vast object not fully grasped, at the Eternal not ourselves-and, as such, it wants (as he might have said had he been a contemporary of Kenneth Burke) to "dance out" our sense of the transcendent Mystery that lowers upon us. So the fashionable line amongst commentators on Arnold over the past generation, that, in reducing religious discourse to an affair of mere poeticizing, he strips it of any ontological claim-this is, as any thorough and unbiased reading of his work ought to indicate, quite without sub- stantial warrant. And it is equally mistaken, as Professor Livingston properly insists, to try in the manner of certain recent interpreters to assimilate Arnold to the views of a post-Wittgensteinian thinker like 72William Robbins, The Ethical Idealism of Matthew Arnold (Toronto: University of To- ronto Press, 1959), p. 95. 73Literature and Dogma, pp. 292-93. 74Bradley (n. 5 above). 75Robbins, pp. 87-88. 76Reinhold Niebuhr, The Nature and Destiny of Man (New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1943), 2:50. 277</page><page sequence="18">The Journal of Religion R. B. Braithwaite.77 True, Professor Braithwaite himself records his sym- pathy for Arnold's general outlook in his Eddington Lecture, An Empiri- cist's View of the Nature of Religious Belief, but his own position-that reli- gious assertions are merely assertions of "an intention to carry out a certain behaviour policy"78-would seem to stand at a very great distance indeed from that of the author of Literature and Dogma for whom the language of the religious imagination, poetic though it must necessarily be, carries genuine truth-claims, and claims that are experientially veri- fiable. The total theory of interpretation, then, which emerges from Arnold's writings of the 1870s-from St. Paul and Protestantism and Literature and Dogma and God and the Bible and the Last Essays on Church and Religion- represents a structure of thought which, once it is rescued from the scholiasts, may be seen to be a very considerable achievement, and one that touches with great suggestiveness much that is currently at issue in the intellectual forums of our own period. Yet there is a striking pathos that appears in Arnold's career as a religious thinker, when one remarks, on the one hand, the extraordinary subtlety of his hermeneutical pro- gram and, on the other, the thinness of what it actually yielded in the way of restatement of the Christian faith. His concern to set forth "the natural truth of Christianity" prompts him to embrace the view that "the object of religion is conduct,"79 and he considers the difference between morality and religion to be but "a dif- ference of degree." As he says, in one of his most frequently quoted passages, "Religion ... is ethics heightened, enkindled, lit up by feeling; the passage from morality to religion is made when to morality is applied emotion. And the true meaning of religion is thus, not simply morality, but morality touched by emotion. "80 So it is not surprising that he conceives "'righteousness' ... [to have been] in a special manner the object of Bible-religion,"81 one of the great "master-words" indeed of both Tes- taments: for "the Hebrew people," he declares, "conduct ... [was] three-fourths of our life and its largest concern,"82 and the not ourselves which weighed so heavily upon them was "the Eternal not ourselves which makes for righteousness." Israel's most fundamental conviction was that "righteousness tendeth to life" (Proverbs 11:19) that "the righ- teous shall be recompensed in the earth" (Proverbs 11:31), and that "he that pursueth evil pursueth it to his own death" (Proverbs 11:19).

So, most especially as a result of all the humiliation brought by the Babylonic exile, Israel began to look toward the coming of a redeemer-the Son of Man, the Messiah-who would at last usher in "the kingdom of righteousness." "Now," says Arnold, "it is clear that righteousness, the central object of Israel's concern, was the central object of Jesus Christ's concern also."83 But, whereas "the kingdom of righteousness" had been for Israel a pre- eminently social-political reality which she herself was to administer, Jesus interiorized and spiritualized this whole conception. "Self- examination, self-renouncement, and mildness ... were ... the great means by which Jesus Christ renewed righteousness and religion,"84 and, in his dispensation, finding one's own soul became the paramount issue. Moreover, whereas the Messiah had traditionally been expected to be a political strategist and a social revolutionist, he took "the humble, inward, and suffering 'servant of God' of the prophets ... and ... [elevated] this as the Messiah."85 He "found Israel all astray, with an endless talk about God, the law, righteousness, the kingdom, everlasting life,-and no real hold upon any one of them."86 So he "set going a great process of searching and sifting; but this process had for its direct object the idea of righteousness"87-most especially in regard to "faults of self- assertion, graspingness, and violence ... which we may call faults of temper ... and ... [in regard to] faults of sensuality."88 "To have the heart and thoughts in order as to certain matters, was conduct"-and "faults of conduct were what Jesus said the real commandments of God are con- cerned with."89 This, says Arnold, was "the 'method' of Jesus": it was a method adjusted to the fact that man is defiled by the things that come from within his heart. So metanoia was his watchword, for he was aiming at a change of the inner man. Then, as Arnold suggests, in addition to his method Jesus had also "a rule of action" which was his secret, and it was simply this: "He that loveth his life shall lose it; and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal" (John 12:25). In other words, his "method" directed the disciple's eye inward, and "after putting him by his method in the way to find what doing righteousness was, by his secret Jesus put the disciple in the way of doing it."90 And Arnold insists that this "method of 83Ibid., p. 76. 84Ibid., pp. 80-81. 5Ibid., p. 82. 86Ibid., p. 172. 87Ibid., p. 174. 88Ibid., p. 176. 89Ibid. 90Ibid., p. 184. 279</page><page sequence="20">The Journal of Religion inwardness" and this "secret of self-renouncement" find their verifica- tion in the universal experience of the race, since in no other way can we come by grace and truth and peace and all the felicities which the New Testament speaks of as "fruits of the Spirit." Now "Jesus could not but use the dominant phrases of the Jewish religion, if he was to talk to the Jewish people about religion at all."91 So he subsumed the old conception of "the Anointed Prince conquering the earth in the cause of righteousness" under his own preferred conception of "the mild and suffering servant of God"92-and then said: "He that believeth on me, believeth not on me, but on him that sent me" (John 12:44). True, his word that "I came forth from the Father" (John 16:28) has been pounced on, says Arnold, by the doctors of theological science and made the basis for elaborate Trinitarian schemes that speak of per- sons being co-equal and co-eternal, the Son being of one substance with the Father and the Spirit proceeding from the Father and the Son. But all this is Aberglaube, for the only "Paraclete that Jesus promised ... was the Muse of righteousness; the Muse of the work-day, care-crossed, toil- stained millions of men,-the Muse of humanity."93 Or, again, says Arnold, ... the whole centre of gravity of the Christian religion, in the popular as well as in the so-called orthodox notion of it, is placed in Christ's having, by his death in satisfaction for man's sins, performed the contract originally passed in the Coun- cil of the Trinity, and having thus enabled the magnified and non-natural Man in heaven, who is the God of theology and of the multitude alike, to consider his justice satisfied, and to allow his mercy to go forth on all who heartily believe that Jesus Christ has paid their debt for them.94 But, as he urges, the real "centre of gravity of the Christian religion is in the method and the secret of Jesus."95 His method did, to be sure, lead up to his secret, and his secret was dying to "the life in this world" and living to "the eternal life." And, since he was constantly "above the heads of his reporters," it is not surprising that their minds came to be ruled by "the miracle of the corporeal resurrection" which they declared him to have foretold. Yet, in Arnold's formulation, the simple truth of the matter is that, long before his crucifixion atop Mt. Calvary, "Jesus had died, by taking up daily that cross which his disciples, after his daily example, were to take up also"-just as he "had risen to life long before his crown- ing Resurrection, risen to life in what he calls 'my joy,' which he desired to see fulfilled in his disciples also."96 91Ibid., pp. 200-201. 92Ibid., p. 204. 93Ibid., p. 217. 94Ibid., p. 218. 95Ibid. 96Ibid., p. 221. 280</page><page sequence="21">Arnold's Version of Transcendence So Arnold finds the master-idea of the Gospels, of the Pauline Epistles, of the Epistle attributed to St. James, of the Epistle to the Hebrews- indeed, he finds the real "ground-thought" of the entire New Testament to be nothing other than righteousness, and this seen in the perspective of the method and the secret that form the center of Jesus's testimony. "As time went on, and Christianity spread wider and wider among the multitudes, and with less and less of control from the personal influence of Jesus, Christianity developed more and more its side of miracle and legend; until to believe Jesus to be the Son of God meant to believe the points of the legend,-his preternatural conception and birth, his mira- cles, his descent into hell, his bodily resurrection, his ascent into heaven, and his future triumphant return to judgment."97 All this, of course, is Aberglaube, "the popular science of Christianity"-with which, however, Arnold wants not at all to be sharp, since, as he tells us, "for the popular science of religion one ... ought to have ... an infinite tenderness. It is the spontaneous work of nature," "the travail of the human mind to adapt to its grasp"98 vast realities which are beyond its grasp. But, then, for all his impatience with bibliolatry, Arnold in his theological thinking was at least something of a Biblicist: which is to say that, being un- prepared to embrace anything comparable to Newman's doctrine of "development," he was eager to be sharp with "the learned science of Christianity,"99 and all the incrustations that (by way of the Fathers and the Schoolmen and the doctors of the Reformation) this had added unto the Aberglaube of the apostolic people he conceived to be an unmitigated disaster. For the final effect of the learned science of the tradition is simply that of obscuring "the real 'essence of Holy Scripture' "-which, for the Old Testament, is "To him that ordereth his conversation right shall be shown the salvation of God!" and, for the New Testament, is "Follow Jesus!"100 In short, what he calls "the true greatness of Christianity" is for him wholly resident in the method and the secret of Jesus. And all else is "extra-belief." Now this, as one is bound to conclude, is an account of the Christian witness that skips with a vengeance. In Arnold's handling of biblical thought, his "demythologizing" intentions are, of course, admirable. But, for all his desire to produce a true rendering of the essential spirit and tenor of the Old Testament, so intent is he on finding it to be nothing more than a manual of"righteousness" that he manages to gloss it in such a way as completely to extrude its central and overriding conception-namely, that Yahweh is a God of the Covenant, that the People of God are a People of the Covenant, and that their relationship 97Ibid., pp. 249-50. 98Ibid., p. 275. 99Ibid., p. 251. 'O?Ibid., pp. 262-63. 281</page><page sequence="22">The Journal of Religion with him is covenantally grounded. Nor, in sweeping aside Old Testa- ment messianism as a bit ofAberglaube inessential to the basic structure of Hebraic thought, does he even begin to reckon with what is interesting and genuinely profound in the interpretation of history projected by biblical prophetism. And nowhere in his account of the Hebraic sources of Christian theology does he attempt any serious estimate of how the Old Testament envisages what Professor Eichrodt speaks of as "the cos- mic powers of God."'10 Similarly, in his version of the New Testament, of "religion new- given," one marvels at what he contrives to elide. In this connection, given his concern that everything, as it were, be hung on the teaching of Jesus, it is quite extraordinary, for example, that his account of it should, again, completely pass over its most vital and primary theme-namely, that concerning the Kingdom of God (which "is not a place or commu- nity ruled by God" but "the power of God [which is] expressed in [his] deeds").102 And this fatal remissness is not unrelated to his failure in any way to address himself to the eschatological dimension of the Gospels and of the other pivotal texts in the New Testament canon. Nor can his rendering of Pauline thought (in St. Paul and Protestantism), for all its occasional brilliance, be considered even minimally adequate, given its well-nigh total neglect of what is so much of the essence of Paul's theology-as it involves his analysis of sin, his very high Christology, his doctrine of grace, and his doctrine of the Church. Moreover, the offhandedness with which Arnold was inclined to ap- proach the great masters of Christian theology made it perhaps inevit- able that his own theological work should prove to be something that, as we feel, Irenaeus and Augustine and Anselm and Aquinas and Luther and Calvin and Pascal and Schleiermacher would not even have barely recognized as belonging to the universe of Christian valuation. The Catholic modernist George Tyrrell, looking back on Arnold's legacy from a remove of scarcely a generation, found something repugnantly frigid in "Matthew Arnold's 'righteousness' as the characteristic of the Divinity," a "sort of university God, a personification of the Nicomachaean ethics,"'03 which struck him as being of a piece with a whole theological style uncalculated to render an adequate justice to the distinctive genius of Christian theology. And one knows full well that, had they ever troubled to notice his theological writings, the judgments of Arnold that would have come, after Tyrrell, from Jacques Maritain ?'OWalther Eichrodt, Theology of the Old Testament, vol. 2, trans.

The English philosopher Renford Bambrough, in his interesting book of a decade ago, Reason, Truth and God, suggested that Arnold ought to have said, " 'I do not and cannot accept Christianity, but I offer you what remains when its essential falsehood has been exposed and excised.' "104 And the snappishness of tone in this dictum expresses the kind of con- descension that nearly everybody permits himself when Arnold's reli- gious thought is in view; but it hardly represents, as any close and sym- pathetic reading of his work should indicate, the appropriate attitude toward his whole undertaking. True, he kept a great concern to appease what he called "the hard-headed modern multitudes," but he did not count himself amongst those who supposed that by ". .. public meetings, Church-disestablishment, marrying one's deceased wife's sister, secular schools, industrial development, man can very well live; and that if he studies the writings, say, of Mr. Herbert Spencer into the bargain, he will be perfect, [and that] . . . the Bible is become quite old-fashioned and superfluous. ..."105 Indeed, his was an altogether different spiritual universe from that of such conventional Victorian agnostics as George Henry Lewes and John Morley and Henry Sidgwick and Leslie Stephen. For him, Christianity and its Bible were, as Basil Willey rightly says, "the pre-eminent sources of regeneration, the supreme inspiration to live the life of the spirit."106 And his deep attachment to the English Church would have made him feel it inconceivable that its services should be replaced "by ethical lectures and readings from Confucius or the Upa- nishads or J. S. Mill"107 or Auguste Comte. But, profound as his devo- tion to the Christian faith was and for all the sincerity of his desire to produce a restatement of it for "the hard-headed modern multitudes" that would be a true rendering of its essential message, his theological effort did suffer a sad miscarriage-through what was finally, one feels, some failure of patience that kept him from listening to the tradition with the requisite tenacity and intentness. Yet, unsatisfactory as his constructive efforts may be, they were con- sequent upon the definition of a hermeneutical program which itself represents one of the truly brilliant feats of the intellectual imagination in the nineteenth century; and it is that program, however miscarried it may have been in its execution, that certifies Arnold's high claim as a systematic thinker (to say nothing of the poet of "Empedocles on Etna" and "Stanzas from the Grande Chartreuse," of "The Scholar Gypsy" and '04Renford Bambrough,Reason, Truth and God (London: Methuen &amp; Co., 1969), p. 84.

And most espe- cially should this be thought to be so in the context of the present time, when, experiencing "the crisis of secularization" even more acutely than did the major Victorians (whose distinction it is in the English-speaking world to have been the first to have been traumatized by its impact), we feel with a special poignance the need to renovate the religious imagina- tion by making it step once again (in Stevens's phrase) "barefoot into reality,"108 but doing so in a manner plotted (at least in part) by the via poetica-which is precisely the project of which Matthew Arnold is one of our great modern masters. 108Wallace Stevens, "Large Red Man Reading," The Collected Poems of Wallace Stevens (New York: Alfred A.
