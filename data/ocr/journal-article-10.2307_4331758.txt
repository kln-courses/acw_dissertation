From Haeckelian Monist to Anti-Haeckelian Vitalist: The Transformation of the Icelandic Naturalist Thorvaldur Thoroddsen (1855-1921) STEINDOR J.

Iceland has not been known as a contributor to the history of science. This small nation in the North-Atlantic has only in recent decades made its mark on international science. But the Icelandic naturalist Thorvaldur Thoroddsen (1855-1921) is an exception to this generalisation, for he was well known at the turn of the 20th century in Europe and America for his research on the geography and geology of Iceland. Though Thoroddsen's contribution to these sciences is of great interest there is another very interesting side to his career. This is his transformation from "mechanist" to "vitalist," which is the main focus of this paper. Thoroddsen, who began his career as a follower of Darwinism and Haeckelian monism, started to express his worries about materialism in society in 1902 culminating in a full-fledged denial of materialism in politics and science in 1910. Thoroddsen's transformation is in its nature a very complex process, but overall it can be traced to his view that materialism was destroying the Danish and Icelandic societies. In the years before 1902 Thoroddsen was a monistic atheist, relatively liberal in his politics, a firm believer in the power of the natural sciences, and considered the laws of physics the key to human progress. His views were strikingly similar to the ones Haeckel expounded in The Riddle of the Universe (1899), whose reception in Germany is explored in this paper in order to contextualise Thoroddsen's transformation. Between 1902 and 1910, however, Thoroddsen rejected this worldview in favour of conservative politics and ontological dualism, becoming a staunch believer in a higher, godly, authority. The theories of Darwin and Haeckel were now obsolete and needed to be replaced by the idea of purpose, direction and the final goal of life (Teleology). In order to understand Thoroddsen's transformation, I focus on the interaction of scien- tific knowledge, politics and other cultural issues in his writings. This is done by looking at Thoroddsen's views on biology, on the natural sciences in general, and on politics as published in Icelandic articles, manuscripts and letters in the period 1872 to 1910. I show that the transformation was due to influences from the German holistic movement, Thoroddsen's engagement with the Royal elite in Denmark and its political concerns, new developments</page><page sequence="2">444 STEINDOR J. ERLINGSSON in physics, and from personal traumas and professional disappointments. I also show that Thoroddsen's transformation seems to be a good example of the social shaping of scientific knowledge. Keywords: evolution, Ernst Haeckel, Iceland, mechanism, monism, politics, sociology of knowledge, Thorvaldur Thoroddsen, 20th century physics, vitalism Introduction In The Wonders of Life (1904) Ernst Haeckel expressed his amazement "that in the course of the last twenty years the old vitalism that everybody had thought dead has lifted up its head once more ..." Haeckel should not perhaps have been surprised since his monistic philosophy was one of the prime targets of the holistic movement that sprang up in Germany at the turn of the twentieth century,2 as can be seen in the strong criticism its adher- ents expressed towards Haeckel's The Riddle of the Universe (1899). The holistic movement fought against materialism, Darwinian mechanism and the atheistic and socialistic implications of Darwin and Haeckel's works. So far, however, there is little agreement among historians as to the reasons for this re-emergence of "mechanist-vitalist" controversy, either in Germany or elsewhere.3 One way to get at the causes of this historical shift is to look in detail at individual scientists whose views changed from "mechanism" to "'vitalism,"' as Jonathan Harwood has done concerning the German biologist Richard Woltereck (1877-1944).4 The Icelandic naturalist Thorvaldur Thoroddsen is such a figure. Thoroddsen, who began his career as a follower of Darwinism and Haeckelian monism, started to express his worries about materialism in society in 1902, and produced a full-fledged denial of materialism in politics and science in 1910. The question might be raised why an obscure individual like Thoroddsen was chosen as a subject for an international publication. As an Icelander I am obviously interested in the history of science in my own country, but Thoroddsen seems to me to have a relevance that goes far beyond the confines of Iceland and Denmark. He was known in Europe and America for his research on the geology and geography of Iceland, but what is more, his transformation seems to throw light on the social shaping of scientific knowledge. 1 Haeckel, 1905, p. 50. 2 Harfington, 1996; Hein, 1972; Ringard, 1981; Freyhofer, 1982; Harwood, 1998; Hamburger, 1999. 3 Lawrence and Weiz, 1998. 4 Harwood, 1996.</page><page sequence="3">FROM HAECKELIAN MONIST TO ANTI-HAECKELIAN VITALIST 445 : B W i$ i $ * Sx &lt; r jS -. | X X | j b S:s S .r&lt;ik:4 1 __ g 3 | i a -M Si B . .R.t - - l l l .

Thoroddsen and the Natural Sciences 1872-ca.1906 Thoroddsen was born in Flatey, an island to the west of Iceland, in 1855. He finished his secondary education in 1875 and went the same year to Denmark to study zoology, geology and geography at the University in Copenhagen. This was the fate of every Icelander who wanted to pursue a university education until 1911 when the University of Iceland was founded (Iceland was at that time a Danish dependency with a population of roughly 100,000). Thoroddsen studied in Copenhagen until 1880 but did not finish a formal degree (he received an honorary doctorate from The University of Copenhagen in 1894). From 1880 to 1895 he worked as a secondary school teacher, most of the time at the Reykjavik Junior College, apart from the period 1884-1885 when he studied in Germany. From 1881 to 1898 he went every summer on research trips around Iceland, which formed the basis of his scientific publications. In 1895 Thoroddsen realised that he could no longer pursue his scientific interests isolated in Iceland, so he moved with his family to Copenhagen, joining a large number of Icelanders who lived there. In 1899 he was given a handsome pension by the Icelandic parliament, which in addi- tion to grants he acquired in Denmark, enabled him to work as an independent scientist in Denmark until he died in 192 1. Thoroddsen devoted his life to the geography and geology of Iceland and wrote "many monographs of great value"6 that were published in Danish, German, Icelandic and English (in order of frequency). His publica- tions include "Explorations in Iceland during the years 1881-1898" (1899), S In 1909 he was offered a chair in geography at the University of Copenhagen, which he declined in order to maintain his independence. 6 NN, 1898, p. 568.</page><page sequence="5">FROM HAECKELIAN MONIST TO ANTI-HAECKELIAN VITALIST 447 where he summarised his findings on the physical geography and geology of Iceland, and Geological Map of Iceland: Surveyed in the years 1881- 1898 (1901).7 The American geographer William Morris Davis (1850-1934) described Thoroddsen's "Explorations" monograph as a "most interesting summary."8 In his Presidential Address to the Geological Society in Wash- ington in 1899, the American geologist Arnold Hague (1840-1918) also spoke very favourably about Thoroddsen's research into the nature of Icelandic volcanoes. He claimed that Thoroddsen "has published in European journals the most interesting accounts of his explorations over the less-known regions of Iceland."9 Thoroddsen's international reputation, at the turn of the 20th century, is very well reflected by the fact that he became a corre- sponding member and honorary member of geological and geographical societies in Denmark, Sweden, Belgium and Germany. In England he was made honorary corresponding member of the Royal Geographical Society in 1898 (the Society awarded him the Cuthbert Peek grant in 1897) and corresponding member of the Royal Geological Society in 1902. He was also awarded the gold medallions of the geographical societies in Paris (1895), Denmark (1899) and the United States (1907). Iceland was at that time a Danish dependency, but with the constitution of 1874 the Icelandic Parliament obtained legislative power over its own matters. The Danish king, however, could veto the legislation. But Icelanders continued to fight for more political independence. It resulted in a new consti- tution in 1904 and with it sovereignty was achieved. Parliamentary rule was now installed in Iceland and Icelanders got a Minister who was a member of the Danish cabinet.'0 Iceland's small population and its subordinate status with respect to Denmark were reflected in various ways, including very limited financial and no institutional support for scientists in Iceland."' This is reflected in a review by Thoroddsen's friend, the British geologist Archibald Geikie, of his Geological Map of Iceland. Geikie, who had done research in Iceland, was very pleased with the map and argued that such a map had been much wanted. But he was amazed that this had been done by an individual for "the work on which [Thoroddsen] has been engaged was rather the duty of a Government ... But he has stuck to it with courage until his materials have grown ample enough to permit him to embody them in a general map of the whole of the island." In his concluding remarks Geikie expressed his hope that the Danish Government would support Thoroddsen's future work, 7 Thoroddsen, 1899; 1901 a. 8 Davis, 1900. 9 Hauge, 1899, p. 439. 10 Iceland got its sovereignty in 1918 and gained independence from Denmark in 1944. 1 X See Erlingsson, 2000.</page><page sequence="6">448 STEINDOR J. ERLINGSSON which was of "much general scientific interest," for he had "accumulated a large amount of material, only a small part of which has been published."'2 But as we will see this did not become a reality. Following the publication of the Geological Map, Thoroddsen started to work on his biggest project, Description of Iceland that was published in four volumes between 1908- 1922.'3 It had a very different character from his earlier work for in addition to his earlier focus on the physical geography of Iceland, the work dealt to an equal degree with social geography. When dealing with Thoroddsen's move away from monism to vitalism it is important to note that the vitalism to which scientists adhered did not necessarily affect the methods they used in their scientific work. Rather, it limited the range of questions they deemed scientifically relevant. A case in point is the British physiologist J.S. Haldane (1860-1936). As a physiologist he used the methods of physics and chemistry in his work, but he argued that mechanistic theories could not explain the nature of living beings, due to the holistic nature of life.'4 The same was the case in physiological research in Germany in the latter part of the 19th century, for German physiologists simply ignored questions dealing with the nature of the mind or developmental biology.'5 Hans Driesch (1867-1941), the main protagonist of vitalistic biology at the turn of the 20th century, argued along these lines in a letter to Nature in 1913: The "problem of method remains unaffected by the controversies between vitalism and mechanism."'6 But since vitalism was mostly relevant in the biological sciences the ques- tion arises whether Thoroddsen's vitalism affected his work in geology and geography. It seems to have done so, for during the transformation period Thoroddsen moved away from specific questions dealing with the physical geography and geology of Iceland towards more inclusive and holistic ques- tions relating to the geography of Iceland, as can be seen in Description of Iceland. But how Thoroddsen applied his ideology in his scientific work is not of great importance in this paper. I am only looking at how, and why, Thoroddsen's ontology and epistemology changed. Thoroddsen's first acquaintance with Darwin's theory of evolution was in 1872 when he read an article on the subject by the Icelandic naturalist and poet Benedikt Gr6ndal (1826-1907), who taught him natural history in secondary school. In his Memoirs Thoroddsen noted that through this article "I was first introduced to Darwin's evolutionary theory ... and needless to 12 Geike, 1901, pp. 368-369. 13 Thoroddsen, 1908-1922. 4 Haldane, 1916.

Emphasis in original.</page><page sequence="7">FROM HAECKELIAN MONIST TO ANTI-HAECKELIAN VITALIST 449 say this book had a huge influence on me like most others who dealt with the natural sciences."'7 In this article Grondal was very enthusiastic about Darwin's theory and Thoroddsen caught his mentor's interest. In secondary school Thoroddsen read The Origin (1859) as well as Darwin's Expressions of Emotions in Man and Animals (1872), which was then recently published.'8 He even wrote an essay in secondary school entitled "On Emotions," which he based on Darwin's book.'9 Thoroddsen's interest in biology continued as he started his studies at the University of Copenhagen. He devoted the first two years to zoology, which then gave way to his interest in geology and geography. Thoroddsen came to know Haeckel's work intimately when he was studying at the University of Copenhagen,20 and after finishing his studies he continued to expound Haeckel's views as a secondary school teacher in Iceland and in his publications, where he emphasised the importance of Haeckel's biogenetic law.21 But Thoroddsen's biggest contribution to the evolutionary discussion in Iceland were his essays "On the Origin of Animal Species and Plants" (1887-1889), which are a detailed excerpt from the 6th edition of Darwin's Origin.22 In his concluding words Thoroddsen empha- sised that "to-date no other opinion about the connection between animals and plants and the origin of species has been put forward, which is as simple and logical" as Darwin's theory of evolution. This theory was, according to Thoroddsen, the best known path to the truth for it "proves many issues that were previously a mystery, and shows normal causes and effects, where before had been chaos." Thoroddsen concluded by observing that the theory 7 Thoroddsen, 1922-1923, 1: p. 103. 18 Darwin, [18591 1964, [18721 1965. 9 Lbs 2101, 4to. "Lbs" refers to the National Library in Iceland. 20 Bibliographies by Thoroddsen can be found in Lbs 2101, 4to, which show that he became acquainted with Haeckel's published works during his university studies. 21 In one of these publications he claims that living animals "all hold hands and form a single chain from the uppermost to the lowermost, which can also be seen in Earth's history; phvlogeni." While it has also been seen that "each animal goes in its development through the main species that are below them in the animal sequence and rises from the inferior to the superior (ontogeni)." Thoroddsen 1882, p. 97. 22 1 edited the republication of these essays in 1998 (Thoroddsen, 1998). This is the closest Icelanders have to a translation of The Origin. On Darwin and Haeckel see e.g. Peter J. Bowler's The Non-Darwinian Revolution (1988). In his book The Meaning of Evolution Robert J. Richards accuses Bowler, Stephen J. Gould and Ernst Mayr of presentism when they claim that Darwin rejected recapitulation and its implicit idea of teleological progress. Richards points out that in recent Darwinian historiography Darwin is "gradually becoming a neo-Darwinian, a modern biologist who scorns notions of progress and rejects German transcendental theories" (Richards, 1992, p. 114; see also pp. 174-179). Bowler answered this criticism in Life's Splendid Drama (Bowler, 1996, pp. 75-83). Richards reiterates his criticism in "The Epistemology of Historical Interpretation" (Richards, 2000).</page><page sequence="8">450 STEINDOR J. ERLINGSSON of evolution had influenced all the sciences to such an extent that none of them "can evolve without it, all aspects of human knowledge have received a creative force from it, which they will always cherish."23 Thoroddsen did not focus only on Haeckel and Darwin for from this period there exists a manuscript which is a detailed analysis of George Romanes' (1848-1894) recently published article "Physiological Selection: An Addi- tional Suggestion of the Origin of Species" (I 886).24 Thoroddsen argued there that Romanes' findings indicate that "the theory of natural selection is not sufficient on its own" and that its proper name "should be the theory of the cumulative development of adaptations."25 So in 1890 Thoroddsen was well aware of some of the most important developments in evolutionary theorising. But from then on until 1909 he did not publish anything directly relating to evolution. Importantly, though, there exists a manuscript from 1900 where he discussed evolution and geology. Part of the manuscript is likely based on the final chapter of Haeckel's Riddle. After discussing how the Earth will in the end turn into an ice-cold rock, he observed "that then all life on earth will be extinct, but life in the universe is not gone. Countless stars come and go but life is always somewhere on planets. Matter is eternal, changes forms but is never lost. A new seed of life awakens on planets, which are so equipped that life can evolve there. Gradually the lowest life forms come into existence which ascent to more and more perfection, the nervous system of the lowest animals becomes better and better, unconscious movements gradually give rise to consciousness. Nature creates itself and in its own glory through its own handiwork."26 Darwin and Haeckel also influenced Thoroddsen's views on the nature of the mind and consciousness. In the above-mentioned secondary school essay that Thoroddsen based on Darwin's Emotions, he talked about how animals and men express their emotions in a similar way. And following an extensive discussion of how various movements and behaviours in animals and men can become a habit, he concluded that biologists "think the cause of this is that the neurons, which move the muscles, are gradually transformed as to better accommodate the flow of the neural force (electricity?). As a consequence the cells in the brain that control this become more movable in a certain direction and more accommodating to the habit. It has often been observed that such qualities can be inherited in animals and man."27 Thoroddsen spoke 23 Thoroddsen, 1998, pp. 319-322. 24 Romanes, 1886. On Romanes see Richards, 1987, pp. 334-381; 407-408. 25 Lbs 2058, 4to. Thoroddsen based these quotes on Romanes, 1886, p. 15. 26 Lbs 2057, 4to.

Notice the neo-Lamarckian nature of these thoughts.</page><page sequence="9">FROM HAECKELIAN MONIST TO ANTI-HAECKELIAN VITALIST 451 on similar lines in a lecture he delivered in Reykjavik between 1890 and 1895. There he emphasised also that experience is the basis of all knowledge and that without it our thoughts are "empty and worthless." He stressed that, as a result, innate ideas do not exist: "every scientific opinion and all our ideas about the universe are created through nature's external influences on our senses." But, according to Thoroddsen, all our knowledge is bound within three basic premises: space, the law of causation and time. He considered time and the law of causation eternal and without a beginning, for "cause is unthinkable without an antecedent cause; as a result it is equally unthinkable for the human spirit to think of the beginning of causation and time." From all this followed that nature was "neither built according to our reason nor any superior reason; our reason was created by nature,"28 which seems to indicate a denial of Christian theism. Thoroddsen delivered this lecture in a revised form at a meeting of The Icelandic Society in Copenhagen around 1905. There he reiterated the above mentioned views but also included a discussion about the soul. He believed that human consciousness was based on the workings of the brain and on "how much blood flowed into the brain; both reason and the so-called psychic qualities have their origin in the cerebrum, the more developed it is the higher the animal reason becomes." In his conclusion Thoroddsen emphasised that all over the animal kingdom we can see a continuous "progress in the perfec- tion of the organs, the same being the case with psychic qualities, which are based on the perfection of the nervous system." Thoroddsen also pointed out that "matter and force are eternal, they change forms but are never lost.",29 Thoroddsen's confidence in the physical sciences can also be seen in an article from 1901, where he claimed that the laws of the conservation of matter and energy "are the pillars of nineteenth century science" and that they, with education, "are the best tools the human spirit has to raise society to perfection and progress."30 Thoroddsen was a firm believer in Haeckel's monistic philosophy, whose themes will be outlined in a later section. Thoroddsen and Natural Science 1906-1910 In a span of a few years, however, Thoroddsen lost confidence in this progres- sionistic naturalism and adopted a scientific worldview based on mystical vitalism. The first indication of his scientific reversal can be found in a letter from 27 February 1906, to Ogmundur Sigurdsson, his best friend in Iceland. 28 Lbs 2057, 4to. 29 Ibid. 30 Thoroddsen, 1901 b, p. 5 1.</page><page sequence="10">452 STEINDOR J. ERLINGSSON After talking in a disparaging tone about the Spiritualist movement in Iceland, he emphasised that researches dealing with "psychic complexities and the limits of human knowledge are essential, as they are conducted at psycho- logical institutions at all major universities ... [e.g.] at Wundt's institution in Leipzig."-31 Thoroddsen's reference to the German psychologist Wilhelm Wundt (1832-1920) is a very important indication of Thoroddsen's trans- formation. As will be discussed later he was at that time very concerned about the dominance of materialism in society, which seems to have crept into his ideas about the explanatory power of the natural sciences; Wundt went through an analogous transformation, as Haeckel discussed in The Riddle. In the earlier part of his career Wundt had adhered to monism and used it for example in his explanations of the nature of the mind as can be seen in his "Lectures of Human and Animal Psychology" from 1863; but, as Haeckel observed, Wundt had reversed his course twenty-nine years later when a revised edition of the "Lectures" was published. In its introduction he claimed to have "emancipated himself from the fundamental errors of the first, and that he 'learned many years ago to consider the work a sin of his youth'." Haeckel also pointed out that similar transformations could be found in Kant, Karl Ernst von Baer, Du Bois-Reymond and others, which he found "inter- esting:" "In their youth these able and talented scientists embrace the whole field of biological research in a broad survey, and made strenuous efforts to find a unifying natural basis for their knowledge; in their later years they have found that this is not completely attainable, and so they entirely abandon the idea."32 Du Bois-Reymond (1818-1896), who was one of the most famous physiologists in the nineteenth century, also surfaces in a manuscript Thoroddsen wrote in the autumn of 1908.33 In a famous lecture Du Bois- Reymond delivered in 1872, entitled "The Limits of our Knowledge of Nature," he came to the conclusion that "our knowledge of Nature is thus shut up between two limits. The one forevermore determining our incapacity to comprehend matter and force, the other determining our inability to under- stand mental facts from their material conditions ... Beyond these limits [the scientist] cannot now, nor can he ever, go."34 Thoroddsen's reflections in this manuscript were mainly based on this lecture and on William Lecky's (1838-1903) History of the Rise and Influence of the Spirit of Rationalism 31 Lbs 2669, 8vo. 32 Haeckel, [1900] 1992, pp. 100-102.

Thoroddsen cited approvingly Du Bois-Reymond's claim that sensation is tied to the organs hence "light did not exist until an eye could make a distinction between light and dark, without the eyes and ears of living beings nature is dark and deaf." Significantly this is exactly one of the points that Haeckel (and Thoroddsen prior to his transformation) had criticised most forcefully in his attack on vitalistic dualism. Thoroddsen also pointed out, with reference to Du Bois-Reymond, that "atoms are unfathomable" and that "cconsciousness is an endless riddle."35 In light of these "facts" Thoroddsen now claimed that most people have such low intelligence that they ignore them, and think that the visible world is the only thing there is. Then there are those who had "just scratched the surface of science;" they claimed that "they know and understand everything, which is because they haven't gone deep enough." These people viewed the world as "one big mechanism that goes on from eternity to eternity [as Thoroddsen did prior to the transformation], while they do not contemplate what lies behind nature for they think that only nature exists." Thoroddsen now argued that such people did not realise that nature is "unfathomable for the human spirit, as a result they lost sight of Christianity, say it does not exist. These men do not understand the limits of their own spirit because they are themselves too limited and narrow-minded." Thoroddsen continued along these lines when he cited the following from Lecky: "Scientists cannot find the first origin, nature of force or the nature of life ... We know nothing or nearly nothing about the connection between body and soul, neither in the universe or ourselves. The one who claims that the progress of the natural sciences will ever make the first cause or the origin of existence understandable does not have the slightest idea about the role and limits of science and misinterprets it."36 The same views were evident few months later, in January 1909, when Thoroddsen started to write an article entitled "A Few Observations on Sensa- tion and the Senses."37 He based this article on the lecture he had delivered at The Icelandic Society in Copenhagen few years earlier. The main narrative in the article bears similarity to the lecture, but Thoroddsen took out the strong materialistic claims he made there. Thoroddsen claimed to take a neutral stand in the mechanist-vitalist debate,38 but a closer look reveals he sympathised with the vitalistic cause. When Thoroddsen asked: "what is the soul, where does it come from and where does it go," he answered that "scientific logic cannot answer that; it is beyond the limits of science and 35 Lbs 2057, 4to; the quotations refer to Du Bois-Reymond, 1903, pp. 21-22, 25, 33. 36 Ibid., the quote is from Lecky, 1900, 1: p. 292. 37 NKS 3011,40,#5. 38 On the mechanist-vitalist debate see Lillie, 1914; Woodger, 1929, pp. 229-272; Hein, 1972.</page><page sequence="12">454 STEINDOR J. ERLINGSSON human knowledge." "The interaction between body and soul" will according to Thoroddsen "probably forever be beyond human comprehension."39 These thoughts were again expressed in Thoroddsen's article "Scientific Novelties and Modem Viewpoint Changes I-III" (1910). In it Thoroddsen denied everything he had held sacred up to around the turn of the twentieth century and now he made Darwin one of his main targets. He claimed, obviously citing Adolf Wagner's (1869-1940) Geschichte des Lamarckismus (1908),40 that "Darwin's theory won a great victory in the period 1880-1890," but "ever more scientists started in the period 1890-1900 to rise against many of its principles." This culminated, according to Thoroddsen "in the first nine years of the twentieth century," for now "it can be truthfully said that a vast majority of scientists (at least in Germany) have abandoned Darwin's theory." Darwin's main ideas that "seemed at first so obvious and easy, have now after 50 years of research become complicated and dark, its pillars rotten and collapsed."41 Thoroddsen also rejected Haeckel's monism and his biogenetic law, in favour of von Baerian criticism of recapitulation.42 He observed that the underlying force behind these developments was that "the idea of purpose, direction and the final goal of life (Teleology) are now more and more coming to life again."43 As a result the law of substance, which was so influential in the last decades of the nineteenth century, had been exposed as a "very shallow theory that cannot stand up to scientific logic." Thoroddsen had now absolutely rejected materialism whose central tenets were according to him: "No God exists except matter itself; the universe has existed eternally and everything that happens in it is contingent and meaningless coincidence. The soul, which is nothing else than atom movements in the brain, dies with the body.'"44 He was now a religious individual, who considered the kernel of "all religions that man tries with his mind to get into contact with what is superior to the world, which the senses can comprehend. When science reaches its peak men become un-wise, think they can sense everything and that nothing is 39 Thoroddsen, 1909, pp. 97-99, 100. 40 Wagner, 1908, p. 63.

Lenoir, 1982, pp. 246-275 discusses in detail von Baer's criticism of Darwinian evolution. See also Richards, 1992. 43 Thoroddsen, 1910, II: p. 100. 44 Ibid., III: p. 200. Thoroddsen based his criticism of materialism on the German philos- ophers Erich Adickes (Adickes, 1901 a), Eduard V. Hartman (1 842-1906; Hartman, 1882) and Rudolf C. Eucken (1846-1926; Eucken, [19061 1907, pp. 19-33) who likened materialism to socialism.

To contextualise the reversal of Thoroddsen's views it is informative to look at the reception of Haeckel's Riddle in Germany. Ernst Haeckel and the Riddle of the Universe Haeckel's book was very broad in scope. He dealt with evolution and the development of the embryo; the embryology and phylogeny of the soul; consciousness and the immortality of the soul; the law of substance; the evolution of the world; and various questions relating to the relationship between science and religion. Among the main points he raised in his book were that neither matter nor force could disappear; they only change form. The universe and life were the result of a mechanical evolution, and the soul has a physico-chemical basis. Because of this, Haeckel denied dualism in favour of his monism that was a mixture of materialism, romanticism and pantheism.46 Haeckel claimed that "the monism of the cosmos ... proclaims the absolute dominion of the 'great eternal iron laws' throughout the universe." At the same time monism shattered "the three central dogmas of the dualistic philosophy - the personality of God, the immortality of the soul, and the freedom of the will." According to Haeckel, this resulted in the disintegration of idealistic dualism "with all its mystic and [anthropo- morphic] dogmas; but upon the vast field of ruins rises, majestic and brilliant, the new sun of our realistic monism, which reveals to us the wonderful temple of nature in all its beauty. In the sincere cult of 'the true, the good, and the beautiful', which is the heart of our new monistic religion, we find ample compensation for the [anthropomorphic] ideals of 'God, freedom and immortality', which we have lost."47 Haeckel thus viewed his monism as scientifically based religion.48 45 Lbs 2057, 4to. 46 Kelly, 1981, pp. 27-28. Lenoir (1982) discusses the connection between romanticism and biology in Germany in the first half of the nineteenth century. See also Richards (1992) where he ties Darwin's and Haeckel's use of recapitulation to Johann Friedich Meckel's (1781-1833) use of it in his transcendental anatomy. 47 Haeckel, 119001 1992, pp. 381-382. 48 Monism is a "connecting-link between religion and science, and thus does away with the antithesis which has been needlessly maintained between these two branches of the highest activity of the human mind. The ethical craving of our emotion is satisfied by monism no less than the logical demand for causality on the part of reason" (Haeckel, [ 1900] 1992, p. 332).</page><page sequence="14">456 STEINDOR J. ERLINGSSON Ever since the early days of evolutionism the evolutionary ideology has, to some extent, served a political purpose, e.g. to argue for a more democratic and fluid society.49 As a result, evolutionism was viewed with suspicion by conservative academics, the church and the ruling class in many European countries. In Germany this was certainly the case, as can be seen in the critical reaction, by these factions, to Haeckel's book. In this context it is important to note that the rapid pace of industrialisation in Germany between 1871-1890 stimulated an enormously rapid process of urbanisation, which gave rise to the claim for increased democracy. But this was counteracted in the late 1870s when, faced with an economic depression and the call for protectionist trading measures, Bismarck pursued a new set of alliances with the conservatives. This resulted in numerous de-liberalising measures,50 which included banning the socialist party and the teaching of evolutionism in secondary schools.5' The political nature of evolutionism can be seen in many members of the German socialist party taking inspiration from Darwin and Haeckel.52 Many German biologists viewed this connection between socialism and evolutionism with suspicion and as a result tried consciously to sever the ties between it and radical materialism as did Haeckel himself.53 He explicitly rejected the alleged link between socialism and Darwinism.54 Haeckel's Riddle became very popular in Germany, and roughly 180,000 copies of the book had been sold there by 1909,55 but in certain quarters of German society the book was heavily criticised. From around 1890 a very influential movement arose in Germany, the so-called holistic movement that fought against positivism and materialism, liberal politics, and a blind belief in cultural and scientific progress. Anne Harrington associates its inception ".with the birth pains of the emerging technological modern age."56 It was from these quarters that Haeckel received the fiercest criticism, which was mainly threefold. He was accused of adhering to naYve realism, since he claimed that the real world had existed "before the human mind came into existence." He was criticised for claiming that he had "thrown light on the evolution of consciousness" and hence rejecting all researches on the human mind that were not based on the methodology of evolution.57 As a result 49 Desmond, 1989. 50 Mommsen, 1995, pp. 101-140. 51 Kelly, 1981, pp. 57-74. 52 Ibid., pp. 123-141. 53 Weindling, 1981, p. 312. 54 Kelly, 1981, pp. 112-1 14. 55 McCabe, 1909, p. 120. 56 Hamrngton, 1996, p. 24. 57 McCabe, 1909, p. 118.</page><page sequence="15">FROM HAECKELIAN MONIST TO ANTI-HAECKELIAN VITALIST 457 Haeckel's presentation of monism as a secular religion was viewed as a direct threat to Christianity. One of Haeckel's harshest critics was the German metaphysician Erich Adickes (1866-1928) who in 1901 published Kant Challenging Haeckel. Adickes used neo-Kantian dualism to undermine Haeckel's worldview. He claimed that "it is as impossible as it is absurd to expect that matter and its motion can explain the living spirit, for Spirit is primary. The whole physical world is hence only the visible part of the world and matter does not, on its own, create our Spirit. The natural sciences and science in general have nothing to say about what lies beyond the visible world; nothing certain is known about the transcendental, it has to be based on belief." As a result Adickes argued that Haeckel did not base his worldview on "monism, but materialism.-58 Adickes reiterated his views in an article entitled "The Philo- sophical Literature of Germany in the Years 1899 and 1900". To emphasise his distaste for Haeckel's views Adickes likened the 67 years old man to "a youth who rashly rushes into life and believes the world is his; but, in order to conquer it, he lacks the all-important thing: he does not see the difficulties and the abysses about him; he does not see the enemies standing ready to confront him, and because he does not see them, he thinks they do not exist.'59 Edmund Husserl (1859-1938), who "pulled philosophy down from the heaven of neo-Kantian abstractions, . . ." aligned with the neo-Kantians in his criticism of Haeckel's alleged materialism. This can be seen in his essay "Philosophy as an Exact Science" (1911) where Husserl criticised Haeckel's positivism, which he thought to be the "true cause of the spiritual 'distress' of his time."60 Conservative scholars viewed materialism as a direct threat to Christianity. This can be seen, for example, in a book by the German church historian Friedrich Loofs (1858-1928) entitled Anti-Haeckel: An Exposure of Haeckel's Views on Christianity (1900). Loofs accused Haeckel of having used his monism to draw so many wrong conclusions concerning Chris- tian faith that qualified judges have deemed Haeckel unfit to write about science.61 Hence, the huge popularity of Haeckel's book, especially within the socialist movement, was viewed with suspicion not only by the German educational authorities but also by conservative religious and academic writers. According to Joseph McCabe (1867-1955), Haeckel's biggest 58 Adickes, 1901 a, pp. 4-5.

These three titles are just a small part of the numerous books that were published in Germany as a reaction to Haeckel's Riddle.</page><page sequence="16">458 STEINDOR J. ERLINGSSON supporter in England,62 Haeckel disliked the criticism he received from the conservatives, but the same applied also to the support he got from the social- ists; he was not pleased with massive public meetings they organised in Germany to support him.63 As McCabe observed, he was a liberal of the old school, but such liberals fought for limited democracy, freedom of press, busi- ness, conscience and opinion. In Germany at the turn of the twentieth century, however, this ideology was being confronted both from left and right. This resulted from the increased following the socialist were acquiring, after the party became legal again in 1890. Then there was the conservative reaction to this, which produced a previously unknown alliance between the Catholic Church and conservative followers of the Emperor.64 Haeckel trusted neither democracy nor the co-operation with the Vatican, which he saw as a potential return to the Middle Ages. Haeckel thought that the freedom of research and teaching, which he had fought so vehemently for,65 was also in danger due to this "new alliance" while culture in general faced a great danger from the victories of the socialists.66 62 As Peter J. Bowler points out in Reconciling Science and Religion: The Debate in Earl'y- Twentieth Century Britain (2001), Haeckel was also controversial in Britain, but of Haeckel's early critics in Britain he only mentions Oliver Lodge's 1905 Life and Matter (Bowler 2001, pp. 49, 96). My preliminary study of the reception of Haeckel's Riddles (1900) in Britain shows that there is much more to this story than Bowler indicates. Haeckel's book, which was "purchasable for six-pence at any bookstall" (Lodge, 1912, p. 3) became very popular in Britain, and had in 1909 been sold in more than 100,000 copies (McCabe, 1909, p. 119). As McCabe, the translator of the Riddles, pointed out in 1909 "little need be said of the Haeckel controversy in this country. I remember well the day when the German work was submitted to me with a view to publication. I hazarded a guess that it would sell a thousand copies, and thought that it contained so valuable a description of the evolution of mind that it should be published. It has sold, with rather less than the usual advertising, with no special machinery for pressing it such as is at the command of religious works ... The success of the work astounded us. While we were being accused of 'thrusting it down peoples throats' we could not have arrested its circulation, had we wished, without positively refusing to republish it" (McCabe, 1909, p. 119). Haeckel's book was immediately attacked in reviews, newspaper and journal articles, and book chapters prompting McCabe to answer in 1903 in Haeckel's Critics Answered (McCabe, 1903; a revised edition of the book was published in 1910). Following the publication of McCabe's book at least 14 books and booklets that dealt with Haeckel's Riddles, in one way or another, were published in Britain by 1910. All this indicates that there was a profound interest in Haeckel's philosophy in Britain in the first decade of the 20th-century. In light of this Haeckel's reception in Britain certainly deserves a detailed study, maybe something like James Secord's massive study of the reception of Robert Chamber's Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation (Secord, 2000), for both books were "Evolution for the People." 63 McCabe, 1909, p. 115. 64 McCabe, 1909, P. 117. 65 Haeckel, 1879. 66 McCabe, 1909, P. 117.</page><page sequence="17">FROM HAECKELIAN MONIST TO ANTI-HAECKELIAN VITALIST 459 We have already seen that, after his transformation, Thoroddsen had moved into the anti-Haeckelian camp. He was undoubtedly aware of the fierce criticism directed at Haeckel for he had close ties to Germany; he went there frequently to attend conferences or to visit friends, with whom he corresponded extensively. Through these means he was almost certainly exposed to both the holistic ideology that was influential in Germany at the turn of the twentieth century and the political use of Haeckel, which, in any case, he would know through the books that were critical of Haeckel. This included Adickes' previously mentioned book and one by the German philos- opher Rudolf Eucken (1 846-1926), who likened naturalism to socialism.67 To better appreciate why Thoroddsen joined Haeckel's critics we need to look at the development of his political views. Thoroddsen Changing Political Views, 1890-1910 From the start Thoroddsen was a moderate liberal, who did not believe in general suffrage. This can possibly be explained with reference to his family background; his father, who was a key official in Iceland, and his brother were both lawyers, and he married into the family of the bishop of Iceland. Thoroddsen expressed his worries about the "voting mob" in politics, as Haeckel did. The limited scope of his liberalism can be seen in letters to Sigurdsson where he asserted that Icelanders in general were "politically speaking very underdeveloped," which made the general public unable to participate in democratic elections, "because the voting mob is so stupid."68 In a letter to Sigurdsson from 26 September 1892 Thoroddsen was also very critical of the conservative forces in Danish politics. He claimed that "the conservatives have hindered the nation in all its efforts to progress" and that people were experiencing great "reactionary times, priests and lawyers control everything while liberals and scientists hide in dark corners."69 Thoroddsen had a very successful year in 1899, which appears to have increased his optimism concerning politics in Iceland. The year before he had finished his summer research trips around Iceland that brought him the gold medallion of the Royal Danish Geographical Society and a knighthood from the Danish King. Icelanders rewarded him also in 1899 by giving him a handsome pension. Thoroddsen could now devote all his time to research and writing. It seems that this success, along with other awards and scientific society memberships he had acquired, increased his optimism. This can 67 Eucken, [ 19061 1907, pp. 19-33. 68 Lbs 2669, 8vo; 1s. d. 12 Jan. 1898; 27 Feb. 1896. 69 Lbs 2669, 8vo.</page><page sequence="18">460 STEINDOR J. ERLINGSSON clearly be seen in his article "Meditations at a Century's End" (1901) that was based on two lectures he delivered in 1900. In it Thoroddsen discussed the advance that Icelanders made during the nineteenth century, and he made clear that he was very pleased with the political situation in Iceland at the turn of the twentieth century. "Contrary to the past the [Icelandic] public engages now actively in public discourse and it seems to me that the [Icelandic public] does it as handsomely as the general public in other countries." In spite of this increased social awareness, Thoroddsen noted that he had not seen much interest in the constitutional issue in Iceland except maybe during "the last two years, if a notice can be taken of the commotion that was stirred up during last [parliamentary] elections" (general suffrage did not exist in Iceland at that time). The Icelandic Parliament (Althing) held a special place in his heart for if everything is taken into account, Thoroddsen claimed, "the parliament has with honour and respect stood its ground, which is a sign of maturity and hope for the society's future."70 As has already been noted, Iceland acquired sovereignty in 1904. One of the key factors leading to this was the election of a liberal government in Denmark in 1901, where the moderate liberals (Venstre) governed with the support of socialists after decades of conservative rule.7' Thoroddsen was pleased with the new Danish government. In a letter to his brother from 5 October 1901 he noted that "even though I am not an active politician I am very fond of the new cabinet, especially because I know more or less all the Ministers," but he expressed a concern because the moderate liberals had to "promise the socialists greater suffrage, which can later prove to be dangerous."72 The optimism Thoroddsen expressed concerning the new Danish govern- ment soon dwindled. A year after it resumed power he noted in a letter to Sigurdsson that since the moderate liberals were elected "what was considered a conservative tyranny has been re-categorised as the right of the individual."73 This is a sign of what was to come in Thoroddsen's political belief. In the next eight years his pessimism concerning the political situ- ation in Iceland and Denmark increased rapidly, i.e. as the Social Democrats became more powerful in Denmark, Thoroddsen became more sensitive to the danger of "materialism." This was expressed in a nutshell in a letter to his former mentor Benedikt Grondal from 12 November 1903: "You speak about the materialism in Iceland, but here it is no less. Since I was a student here 26 years ago everything spiritual has degenerated, everything is now only valued 70 Thoroddsen, 1901b, pp. 41-42. 71 Asmundsson, 1981, p. 305. 72 Lbs 5020, 4to, IL. 73 Lbs 2669, 8vo; 1. d. 27 Feb. 1902.</page><page sequence="19">FROM HAECKELIAN MONIST TO ANTI-HAECKELIAN VITALIST 461 by its monetary value especially since the new democratic government was elected [in Denmark]. The educated people are trodden down by the mob and all sorts of uneducated people are now awarded with titles and medallions only if they have money or control votes."74 Thoroddsen returned to this issue three years later in a letter to Sigurdsson where he criticised harshly a movement among Icelandic students in Copenhagen that was fighting for the independence of Iceland. "In my opinion everyone is now convinced that the latest constitutional movement will not be long lasting. The only way to calm Icelanders is to get an Earl or a British colonial government, but the young generation does not like that; they only want an ideological republic." Thoroddsen claimed that the reason for these developments was that the young generation in Denmark and Iceland, as well as the older one, only thought "about the animalistic, to eat, drink and procreate" and they "consider everything meaningless except politics, Christianity is nonsense, science is useless and they say that everyone can live by his urges." Thoroddsen accredited this to the bad influence of the Danish literary critic George Brandes (1842-1927), who was instrumental in bringing Nietzsche, Ibsen and others to a wider audience.75 He argued that Brandes could be likened to "Attila the king of the Huns: where he has been, nothing grows. The youths he has fostered all end up in materi- alism."76 Thoroddsen saw this situation clearly in Iceland in 1906, when he visited it as a member of the King's entourage. He pointed out that the Brandesian ideology is "now flowering in Reykjavik, since every young offi- cial and politician, with the Icelandic Minister in the front, are descended from it.'77 Thoroddsen was well aware that his dislike of democracy and his "other political opinions" did not have a wide following, but he still saw a chance in influencing people in Iceland. In 1910 he and Sigurdsson agreed that "the Icelandic general public is still mostly healthy,"78 but Thoroddsen thought that the politicians were continuously trying to stir it up 6"with various extremes and stupidities, when the general public needs to work calmly on its progress; I think that starting a new constitutional debate is a crime against the nation." To add insult to injury Thoroddsen claimed that educated Icelanders had "imported the Danish radicalism to Iceland."79 74 Lbs 2395, 4to, II. 75 Asmundsson, 1981. 76 Lbs 2669, 8vo; 1. d. 27.

ERLINGSSON To counteract this he decided to write the previously mentioned article "New Scientific Developments and Modem Viewpoint Changes" (1910). Thoroddsen "assumed that many people will find this essay strange,"80 which proved to be the case. In the article Thoroddsen observed that "in many coun- tries" the democratic governments " have become a scandal," but in spite of this "it is a fact that democracy, with all its disadvantage and few advan- tages, will dominate the distant future." He claimed that noteworthy men had become afraid that "parliamentary rule will lead to big problems in the future with its endless spending and corrupted power, which will be difficult for the educated class to tolerate." The reason for this was that it is against the laws of nature "to make everyone equal; it is impractical and stupid to build future hopes on this."8' Sigurdsson did not swallow Thoroddsen's denunciation of democracy easily, even though they had in the past often agreed on political matters. In a letter to Thoroddsen dated 29 August 1910 Sigurdsson claimed that he and other lay people in Iceland liked the article, while the ruling elite criticised it harshly, but he noted that it contained a certain pessimism: "If democracy does not work it is an uncomfortable thought if we have to move back to the monarchy, either to a single king or to a few aristocrats and clergy men."82 Thoroddsen answered Sigurdsson promptly claiming that he had misunderstood the essays. "Even though I find faults I would not dare to go back to the monarchy, aristocratic and clergy ruling ... I only wanted to point out that it is of vital importance for human kind to find new ways to govern itself," i.e. something better than democracy.83 Why Did Thoroddsen Reverse His Course? As we have seen, in the early years of the twentieth century Thoroddsen's ontology and epistemology went through a radical transformation and he substituted monistic evolutionism with vitalistic anti-evolutionism. He also rejected moderate liberalism for conservatism. In 1901 he considered the discovery of the conservation of matter and energy as the greatest achieve- ment of nineteenth century science, but nine years later it had become a shallow theory that did not stand up to scientific logic. Haeckel and Darwin, who were his greatest champions before the transformation, were now biology's worst enemies. So why did Thoroddsen change his mind? Vitalism received an unexpected boost at the turn of the twentieth century with the discovery of x-rays and radioactivity, which created a crisis in 80 Ibid., 1. d. 18 May 1910. 81 Thoroddsen, 1910, III: pp. 204-205, 207. 82 NKS 3006, 40, #14; 1. d. 29.

In a span of a few years Lord Kelvin's previous claim that nothing remained in physics than filling in the next decimal place, was overthrown. Matter and motion, the cornerstones of Haeckel's monism, did not explain everything in the physical world. The dream of a complete theory of physics was over.84 The mystical element in the vitalism that Thoroddsen and others adhered to even gained momentum by these developments in physics.85 Thoroddsen was well aware of the implications of the "new physics." In "New Scientific Developments and Modern Viewpoint Changes," from 1910, Thoroddsen observed that at the end of the nineteenth century scientists thought that they had created a coherent explanation of the natural world that would not be altered. But at the turn of the twentieth century, a series of observations and experiments shook these assumptions, and, as Thoroddsen pointed out, these developments forced scientists to re-evaluate many of their basic premises and caused the disintegration of older ideas. "Physicists are now contemplating whether it is really true that nothing else exists in nature than matter and motion, and whether it is only due to habit that we explain everything by referring to matter and motion ... but even though scientists are always expanding the limits of knowledge, the world-riddle is still as unsolvable as before."86 These developments in physics, combined with the current vitalist criti- cism that Thoroddsen absorbed, seem to have been necessary for convincing him that fundamental problems surrounded nineteenth century materialism and monism and the Darwinian worldview, but they were not sufficient. Thoroddsen might have realised before the transformation, or in its early phase, that the new developments in physics created problems for nineteenth century mechanism, but I doubt it very much that it was the sole cause for his transformation, for other mechanists, who became aware of the "new physics," adapted their viewpoint to the "new physics" instead of reverting to vitalism.87 Hence, in order to fully understand Thoroddsen's transformation we have to take into account series of traumas and misfortunes, both personal and professional, that Thoroddsen experienced just before and during the transformation period, which are likely to have contributed to his changed views on religion and society. This seems to indicate that personal as well as social factors played a significant role in the shaping of Thoroddsen's scientific worldviews; a claim that is reinforced when we recognise that his political belief seems to have shifted before his scientific views. In order to throw light on why Thoroddsen's political belief underwent such 84 Badash, 1973. 85 Smuts, 1931, pp. 9-10; Miller, 2001. 86 Thoroddsen, 1910, pp. 12-13. 87 Hogben, 1930; Abir-Am, 1987.</page><page sequence="22">464 STEIND6R J. ERLINGSSON drastic transformation I will now look at these traumas and misfortunes that Thoroddsen experienced between 1902-1911. I have shown that the German Holistic movement seems to have influenced Thoroddsen, as well as Haeckel's other critics, and that he was aware of the political ramifications of materialism, and its ties to socialism in Germany. I have also shown that Thoroddsen saw the same happening in Denmark and Iceland after the Social Democrats rose to power in Denmark in 1901. This might have been reinforced by Thoroddsen's links with the Danish aristo- cracy, to which he gained access first through his father in law, the bishop of Iceland, and later through his own fame. He attended Royal funerals; he was knighted in 1899 and could show it in parties in Copenhagen, where he encountered "many of its most important citizens."88 Thoroddsen received a royal professorship and the gold medallion of the Royal Danish Scientific Society in 1902; he was in the King's entourage when he visited Iceland in 1906; and he was on occasions summoned to the King to give advice. It seems also likely that Thoroddsen's early Haeckelian views would not have met with sympathy in these circles. But there is more to Thoroddsen's story. When Thoroddsen had originally settled in Denmark in 1895 he was very optimistic that he would be able to carry on his research and writings unhindered. This optimism was increased when his moderate liberal friends came to power in 1901 for he thought they would be more willing to further scientific researches than previous governments. But Thoroddsen's hopes soon crumbled. Less than a year after the government was appointed he told Sigurdsson that the moderate liberals "refuse to fund science whenever they can, democracy, as it is expressed here, has no intellectual interests."89 Three years later Thoroddsen underscored his professional misfortune in another letter to Sigurdsson: "When I came here I hoped to be able to continue my research in Iceland, especially in those areas I have barely covered, I also hoped to be able to publish a big volume on Iceland, where various scientists would contribute by researching what I have collected. But everything has failed. I have received many awards, more than I deserve, but that in itself does not count for much."90 Around the same time a movement started among Icelandic students at the University of Copenhagen who wanted to close down the Danish branch of The Icelandic Literary Society, which was established in 1816 and had since 1826 published the scholarly journal Skirnir. Thoroddsen, who had worked a lot for the Society, which had published his Icelandic scientific works, was voted the President of the Danish branch in 1905, a position 88 Lbs 5020, 4to, II; 1. d. 22 Apr. 1899. 89 Lbs 2669, 8vo; 1. d. 10 Jan. 1902. 90 Lbs 2669, 8vo, 1. d. 1 I Nov. 1905.</page><page sequence="23">FROM HAECKELIAN MONIST TO ANTI-HAECKELIAN VITALIST 465 that he was reluctant to accept for he had to fight "the voting mob so they will not destroy the Society."9' The main claim of the dissidents was that it was un-Icelandic to maintain a branch in Denmark and they eventually got the support of the Icelandic politicians, since this was viewed as a part of the Icelandic independence struggle. As the president of the Danish branch Thoroddsen tried to prevent the closing of the Society. He was successful until 1910 when he was finally defeated by the "voting mob." The Danish branch was formally closed in 191 1. In a letter to Sigurdsson from 2 May 1911 Thoroddsen claimed that he accepted this result for there would never be "peace with the Reykjavik branch, because the home rule leaders want to get our money ... and kick me away." He told Sigurdsson that this would upset all his plans, "which is a reiteration of previous disappointments." "Icelanders are obviously not interested in my scientific work, slander and obvious lies have been told about me in the newspapers ... It is best that they get a break from me. It also discourages one to write in Icelandic when one thinks about the dreadful situation in public matters in Iceland and the moral degeneration that politics has created ... I used to be a great optimist but I have now started despairing about the future of the nation."92 Thus, in the period 1902 to 1910 Thoroddsen's major professional dis- appointments intensified his disillusionment with those political develop- ments that had championed materialism. Thoroddsen's personal life was also in great turmoil during this period. In early 1903 his only daughter became seriously ill, which resulted in her death 7 April. This had a very negative impact on Thoroddsen and his wife, an issue he mentioned repeatedly in letters the following years. In a letter to Sigurdsson from late 1903 he observed that "one feels life is not worth living."93 Thoroddsen underscored his unhappiness two years later in another letter to Sigurdsson. There he claimed that the ten years he had lived in Copenhagen had been very difficult, "I have hardly ever had a healthy home, even though I have had good health ... ."94 Another blow came in 1906 when his adopted daughter was diagnosed with tuberculosis which led to her death on 17 January 1907. "I have lost both my daughters ... Life becomes harder as you get older, but the loss of loved ones is most painful." These traumas might have undermined his faith in monistic atheism since we know that he bought and read works like The Agreement Between Science and Religion (1906) and Proofs of Life After 9' Lbs 2185b, 4to, 1. d. 14 Nov. 1905. 92 Lbs 2669, 8vo.

But such a conclusion would not only be whiggish, but would also ignore the intellectual pluralism that existed within biology at the turn of the twentieth century. Vitalism was a serious intellectual position at that time and the mech- anists were well aware of this fact.96 This is well illustrated in letter that James Gray (1891-1975) sent to Julian Huxley in 1919. Gray, who "was generally acclaimed as the outstanding personality of British experimental zoology" in the 1920s,97 detailed in this letter a course he planned to give on experimental embryology, which was designed around mechanistic reduc- tionism. But he did not ignore the texts of those zoologists, which adhered to vitalism, and he even dealt specially with vitalism in one of his lectures.98 The opponents of mechanism were thus not brushed aside by its champions, as we would do today. One of the reasons for this was most likely the crisis that the theories of quantum mechanics and relativity created in the scientific world in the first decades of the twentieth century. The mechanists had to admit that their simple Newtonian view of cause and effects was no longer applicable. Thus, the British experimental zoologist Lancelot Hogben (I1895- 1975) argued in 1930 that one of the consequences of these advances in physics was that nineteenth century's materialism had been shown to be an insufficient explanation of reality. Hence, the new biological mechanism that Hogben proposed, to replace the traditional one, "owes its sanction to the same test as that by which the relativistic [and quantum] theories must in the last resort be assayed."99 Hogben expressed these views in his book The Nature of Living Matter where he criticised J.S Haldane and other vitalists harshly. One of these was J.C. Smuts (1870-1950) who in his Presidential 95 Smith, 1906; Thompson, 1902. In a manuscript Thoroddsen quoted the Russian chemist D. I. Mendelieff, who claimed that "just as we can not think about matter and force as being anything else than eternal, we have to think of the soul as eternal" (Lbs 2057, 4to; Thompson, 1902, pp. 88-89). 96 See e.g. D'Arcy Thompson, 191 1; Minchin, 1915; Hogben, 1930 97 Lissman, 1978, p. 61. 98 Gray to Huxley, September 9, 1919, Julian Huxley Papers, MS 50, Woodson Research Center, Fondren Library, Rice University. 99 Hogben, 1930, p. 26.</page><page sequence="25">FROM HAECKELIAN MONIST TO ANTI-HAECKELIAN VITALIST 467 Address to the British Association in 1931, entitled "The Scientific World- Picture of To-Day," used the new physics, as Thoroddsen had done 21 years earlier, to validate his vitalistic outlook. Smuts pointed out, as Hogben did, that nineteenth century mechanism was obsolete and that "the quantum and space-time have brought physics closer to biology" by showing the organic or holistic nature of the organic and inorganic world.'00 Thus in order to better appreciate the "mechanist-vitalist" controversy at the turn of the twentieth century it may well be important to consider the impact of the revolutionary and often confusing messages that came form physics after 1895. But Thoroddsen's case suggests that these alone will not suffice to account for the general shift towards vitalism at that time and that it will be important to look in detail for evidence of social shaping of scientific knowledge in those individuals that took part in the controversy, as Thoroddsen's story demonstrates so vividly.
