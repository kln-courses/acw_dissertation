      <p>This article brings together two themes of central interest to feminist scholars in recent years: violence and the body. As the feminist philosopher Bat‐Ami Bar On notes, “violent bodies” have often been the focus of feminist theory and activism, but these bodies have normally been defined as male (Bar On 2002, 152). My work has been inspired by and contributes to the growing number of feminist studies on political violence and warfare. But by focusing on the narratives of women who have participated in and supported political violence, specifically in the radical Basque nationalist organization Euskadi Ta Askatasuna (ETA; Basque Homeland and Freedom), I depart from the trend in much of this broader literature of defining female bodies as vulnerable (D’Cruze and Rao 2005). I am interested instead in female activists’ descriptions of their relationship to political violence.</p>
      <p>The discussion below is based on interviews I conducted in the mid‐1990s with women who had been activists in or supporters of ETA from the mid‐1960s to the early 1980s.3 The interviews were one of many sources I gathered while writing a history of women and ETA (Hamilton 2007). Given the lack of documentary evidence on women’s participation in this armed, illegal nationalist movement, the interviews provide important information on the patterns of women’s recruitment into ETA, as well as on their roles and experiences inside the organization. Equally important, however, the interviews reveal the constructions of gender, ethnic, and class identities, as well as the functions of memory in the formation of these identities.</p>
      <p>The original group of narrators comprised some twenty‐five women born between 1936 and 1961. In selecting the interviewees, I chose a sample that represented a range of backgrounds (age, region, class, and ethnic group) and experiences of activism, and I made contact with potential narrators through references from four sources: (1) Basque women’s organizations; (2) radical nationalist organizations; (3) academics, activists, and other acquaintances in the Basque country; and (4) the narrators themselves. Following recommendations in recent works on oral history (Passerini 1987; Thompson 1988), I approached the interviews as life stories, allowing each narrator to recite her story as far as possible according to her own memories. Each interview was conducted in Castilian Spanish, lasted between one and two‐and‐a half hours, and was tape‐recorded with prior agreement from the narrator.4 I subsequently transcribed the tapes and analyzed the interviews in detail, highlighting common themes in each interview and across the sample. In order to preserve as much as possible the “orality” of the original interviews (Portelli 1981, 97) I transcribed all of them literally, indicating pauses, gaps, repetitions, partial words, and filler words. Although the analysis was conducted on the original Spanish transcripts, the excerpts examined below are my own translations into English. Because of the controversial nature of the topic (i.e., the defense of political violence) and the excerpts studied here I have chosen to keep the narrators cited in this article anonymous, withholding their names and other personal details (date and place of birth, profession, time spent in or supporting ETA, etc.); instead I identify them by number in the text.5</p>
      <p>When I first worked with the interviews, I noted, like others who have interviewed female activists in armed organizations (MacDonald 1991; Passerini 1992), what seemed to be a resounding silence around one very specific theme: participation in and support of political violence. Initially I attributed this to calculated choice on the part of my narrators, one consistent with wider representations of the Basque conflict. Interviews, reports, and images of the conflict show that willingness to acknowledge the violence committed by one’s own community is in inverse proportion to the emphasis placed on the violence committed against that community. But, as I read and reread the interview transcripts, I began to see that in spite of my reluctance in many cases to ask direct questions about ETA violence the interviews did contain references to that violence, even if rarely to actual armed actions. What I first interpreted as silence turned out to be a kind of muted language of violence, one often expressed in the interviews in the form of metaphor.</p>
      <p>The most recurrent metaphors of violence occur in relation to the body. To date this language of the body has remained stubbornly on the margins of my writing on women in ETA because it never seemed quite to fit within the wider historical narrative in my work about gender, nationalism, memory, and political violence. I struggled, in other words, to find a language with which to address these interview passages. Yet they have continued to both attract and unsettle me and as such seem to demand further consideration. The bodily metaphors of violence in these interviews with female Basque nationalist activists are different from those I have found in other oral histories of conflict. Unlike Gilda Zwerman’s (1994) examples of female activists in U.S. armed organizations, who seem to have distanced themselves from the violence of their organizations, these Basque narrators present violence as integral to struggle and to life itself. As distinct from Gyanendra Pandey’s (1999) subjects, who situate violence outside themselves and their community, my interviewees locate the origins of violence within their bodies. And in contrast to Luisa Passerini’s (1992, 161) metaphor of the “lacerations in the memory,” which also suggests a somatic relationship between the subject and the violence she committed, in my interviews with former members and supporters of ETA violence is associated not with wounds but with health and healing.6</p>
      <p>The association of violence with the body appears in a series of passages in different interviews in which narrators describe ETA violence as a creative force that gives and sustains life. As I show below, there is a lengthy tradition in Western thought associating politics with the body, on the one hand, and violence with life and in particular with reproduction, on the other hand. While scholars have noted the historical importance of organic metaphors of violence, the gendered dimensions of such metaphors have received less attention. In the main section of this article, then, I focus on metaphors relating to reproductive organs and birth. In particular, the image of birth in one interview with a woman formerly active in ETA introduces a novel perspective on the gender politics of political violence in contexts where such violence is typically defined as masculine. I argue that by dissociating political violence from both male and female reproductive organs, or by reworking the military metaphor of male warriors giving birth, the female narrators cited below challenge the common association of violence with masculinity and male sexuality. In so doing they assert what they see as their sexual difference from their male comrades while simultaneously claiming women’s capacity to commit violence.</p>
      <p>I recognize the political and ethical risks involved in highlighting the accounts of violence of female ETA activists, and it is important to be clear about what this article does and does not set out to do. I do not claim that these interviews tell us anything definitive about female ETA activists’ motivations for joining an insurgence movement and committing violence or their feelings about their actions, let alone about the historical roles of women in armed organizations.7 I am aware that without this wider historical context there is a danger that these interviews will be seen as proof that women have participated as actively as men in ETA violence and that women may indeed have an additional investment in that violence because of their subordinate gender status.8 The empirical evidence of ETA membership and activism from the late 1960s to 2003 shows otherwise: the significant majority of armed ETA activists have been men (as have ETA’s victims and the members of the Spanish and Basque security forces). In the period when the narrators discussed here were active (late 1960s to early 1980s), women constituted 10–15 percent of ETA’s membership, and the majority of female activists were involved in supportive or collaborative roles rather than direct armed activism (Hamilton 2007). In exploring expressions of violence that challenge its popular association with certain forms of masculinity, therefore, I do not argue that ETA and Spanish state violence have no relationship to dominant forms of masculinity or male power. I have detailed elsewhere the material effects of these gender power relations, including the sexual torture of some women arrested for ETA membership (see Hamilton 2007). While I agree with many contemporary feminist studies that war and conflict tend to reinforce male dominance and target women in specifically gendered ways (e.g., Enloe 1988), I stress here that women’s resistances to these structures of dominance are not necessarily congruent with that stream of feminism that privileges women’s relationship to peace.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, there is the danger that my attention to the language of the perpetrators and supporters of ETA violence will obscure the devastation experienced by the victims of that violence. In advocating an analysis of these interviews in the context of traditions of bodily metaphors of war and conflict, I do not intend to reduce violence to discourse. I argue that language is important precisely because intellectual traditions that glorify violence and associate it with creativity and life have played a role in sustaining participation in and support for ETA and that they can tell us something about the gender politics of political violence. By tracing these traditions in the interviews, I take a different tack from that of many oral history studies where interviews are used to highlight the ways in which individuals and subordinate groups challenge dominant discourses. Instead, I hope to show how certain ideas circulate in and across ideological boundaries and shape the identities of participants in political violence and to suggest how this process is gendered.</p>
      <p>The bodily metaphors of violence in these interviews highlight the need to listen carefully for signs of those topics that we as interviewers may at first believe to be taboo. Their very idiosyncrasy indicates that they may have something to say about the complexity of the relationship between gender and political violence and about the ways in which difficult themes such as violence may be expressed in oral history interviews. The fact that references to violence appear in the form of metaphor, rather than through direct rationalization of ETA’s actions, does not make the violence they describe any less real or disturbing. To the contrary, through their use of metaphors of life and creativity the passages suggest an affirmation of violence more challenging to the listener than rational justifications of violence as a form of collective national self‐defense.</p>

               <p>In “Women’s Time” Julia Kristeva ([1979] 1997, 362) argues that “the large number of women in terrorist groups like the Palestinian commandos, the Baader‐Meinhoff Gang, and the Red Brigades” may be explained as a kind of paranoid “counterinvestment” in the violence women have encountered. As compelling as her argument is, it is based on an exaggerated claim about women’s participation in left‐wing and national liberation movements in the 1970s. Kristeva remains, however, one of the few feminist theorists to address directly the issue of women’s possible attraction to terrorism, and as such her argument deserves further attention from feminist scholars. The majority of references to “Women’s Time” focus on its argument about different generations of feminists. For an exception that engages with Kristeva’s theory of women and violence, see Rose (1993).</p>

         <p>The reproductive metaphors I examine in the second half of this article are part of a wider set of organic metaphors in the interviews. I open the current section with examples of such metaphors from three different interviews. The first is taken from an exchange with a woman, Narrator 1, who had been active in ETA in the 1960s and 1970s and remained a supporter of radical nationalism when I spoke with her in the mid‐1990s. This excerpt from Narrator 1 is from the opening of her interview, which began with “I was born …” and continued into a lengthy reflection on her own personal and political history and that of ETA: <disp-quote>
               <p>My human condition, the condition of this people, the freedom of the human being, and the freedom of peoples. It’s an important struggle, a good struggle, that gives you hope, that structures your psychology. Because everyone comes from somewhere, and on top of eating and sleeping you have to have something inside, something that makes you get up, live, dream, love, and that means, unfortunately, unfortunately, shooting. I say unfortunately. I wasn’t born to shoot, I don’t like it, but while the others are shooting, I’m not going to put my head down. … The only one the forces of power use, understand, the <italic>only</italic> one, the only kind of struggle, unfortunately, I say it again, that the forces of power don’t assimilate, is the armed struggle. Unfortunately … human beings, we weren’t born to live so others could get fat. Human beings get sick. … Human beings were not born to live for others, were not born to be crushed. No … we were born to be free, to love, to do things we like. To live. And while they don’t let us live, well girl, I—and the struggle doesn’t destroy. The struggle is absolutely creative. What destroys is being slow, keeping quiet, backing down, that <italic>does</italic> make you sick. Struggling, having ideals, is <italic>healthy</italic>. It feels good.9</p>
            </disp-quote>
         </p>
         <p>In the first part of this passage the struggle is presented as an internal force, but through its contrast to sleeping and eating, it is implied as something belonging to the soul or spirit as opposed to the body. Further along, however, struggle is associated with food, sustenance, and movement, as that which keeps one healthy and feeling good, physically as well as psychologically. It is worth comparing this passage to the words near the end of a different interview in which similar themes emerge. This second narrator (Narrator 2) had also been active in radical nationalism since the 1960s, largely as an ETA collaborator and supporter. When I asked her if she was optimistic about the future and attaining the goal of national self‐determination she replied: “It’s a minimum. … It’s like oxygen … if you don’t have it. … Obviously, if I don’t live, I’m not going to let others live. No, no, no. Self‐determination is like bread. It’s like bread. And if we don’t have that bread. No. It can’t be.”10</p>
         <p>The land as body, requiring oxygen and bread to live: this excerpt captures the merging of the body and the body politic, the self and the nation implicit in the radical nationalist demand for self‐determination. The original Spanish word, <italic>autodeterminación</italic>, makes the link even clearer—<italic>auto</italic> means self but is also the juridical term for edict or writ (hence the title of one book on Basque nationalism and violence, <italic>Auto de terminación</italic> [which literally means termination edict but is a pun on <italic>autodeterminación</italic>, or self‐determination; Aranzadi, Juaristi, and Unzueta 1994]). Envisioning national self‐determination as oxygen and bread that allow the body to live represents the collapse of the nation and the people. The declaration, repeated almost word for word in the above two excerpts—“if they don’t let us live, we won’t let them live”—implies that the enemy, that is, the state, is also conceived as a human body.</p>
         <p>This image of the state as body appears again in an interview with a third narrator, still active at the time of the interview (1996) in radical nationalist politics, when I asked her what role the armed struggle played in the movement: “The importance of the armed struggle? Well I have thought about this. The armed struggle is necessary—why? Because in the end they’re the only actions that can harm them. Because democracy has so many throats, the same as the dictatorship, well maybe not so many. … But now in the period of what they call democracy, it has so many throats, so many opportunities to take over, that in the end the only thing it can’t swallow is the armed struggle.”11</p>
         <p>Both of these metaphors—violent struggle as a life force and the state as a body—have lengthy traditions in Western thought. In her critique of the “glorification of violence” in New Left writings of the 1960s, Hannah Arendt traces the “old combination of violence, life, and creativity” in philosophical writing to Karl Marx, Friedrich Nietzsche, and Georges Sorel (Arendt 1969, 171).12 The metaphor of the body politic, the state imagined as a body with different organs representing different functions and constituencies, goes back to ancient Greece (Sontag 1991; Bordo 1993). In the last excerpts above, the enemy/state is imagined as a human body that “swallows” political resistance and denies the Basque people the bread and water they need to live. This image makes literal the contention, dating from ETA’s early days, that at stake is the survival of the Basque people, and thus that violence is an act of physical as well as cultural self‐defense.13 This anthropomorphic vision of the state is the necessary reverse of the identification of the bodies of ETA’s victims, metonymically, with the state itself, helping justify their deaths in so‐called objective terms, as seen in an excerpt from a fourth interview:14</p>

               <p>I think armed actions are hard for everyone. I’m personally not glad because there’s a lieutenant‐colonel who’s been assassinated.

               <p>It means a step, in overcoming the conflict. By overcoming, I mean the tension that we have with the state. I think the <italic>losses</italic> of human life are painful for everyone. But I think we know that more than anyone.16</p>
            </speech>
         </p>
         <p>In addition to the equation of the individual victim with his part in the conflict, the language of this excerpt works in other ways to excuse killing for political aims. The metaphor of the struggle as a forward journey in which necessary steps must be taken expresses the idea that the end justifies the means. The claim that ETA and its supporters are more familiar than anyone with the pain of death allows the speaker to shift from the position of perpetrator to victim.</p>
         <p>Of the interviews I conducted, the one above (that of Narrator 4) is most expressive both of the justification of ETA violence and of women’s participation in that violence. The narrator in question was younger than the others cited in this article, and she joined ETA in the late 1970s, a time when there was a small but significant number of female activists in the organization. I will examine here a passage from her interview that incorporates examples of the violence‐is‐life metaphors outlined above alongside other metaphors of struggle. The excerpt is worth quoting at length because it contains intriguing reflections on the relationship between gender and political violence:</p>

               <p>I think lots of women think that they are more emotional, more sensitive. And the logical question in this context is whether women react to death in a different way.</p>

               <p>I, for example, am very opposed to women in mourning. Or to women for peace. Because it seems to me that’s taking women back to the role we’ve always been given. Because we create life we’re more sensitive. Because we can be mothers. And I think that’s absurd. If not there wouldn’t be women who kill. And we all know that isn’t true. And I can tell you what I’ve told you before. I have male comrades who I’ve talked to, and who’re in prison. For whom there’s no fun, nor joy, in going to kill someone. But they kill because they believe in the struggle, for liberation. I think Jean Genet said it very clearly: brutality is one thing, violence is another.</p>

               <p>First things first. It’s something integral. Men and women, we’re a house. And outside the house is a garden, and it’s very easy to keep the house tidy and the garden nice and tidy. But inside the house no one sees you. So for me the struggle is the garden and inside the house. And you can’t be fighting theoretically or politically for something and inside be very conservative. … I think the struggle is something integral. We’re a cupboard with lots of drawers. But the cupboard is made from all the drawers, not just the drawer on the top or the drawer on the bottom. That’s one thing. The issue of the difference between brutality and violence; for me, brutality is a negation. Genet, the French writer, made it very clear. He said the architecture on the outskirts of many cities is a brutal act. Torture is a brutal act. Identity cards and roadblocks are brutal and negating. In contrast, violence, with all the harshness and cruelty that it can also entail, I think it’s an act of affirmation. And violence can be a volcano starting up, a chick breaking an egg and exploding. The birth of a child is a violent act. Or the bud of wheat when it explodes, too. Life has many facts, many violent acts, but which serve to affirm it. And I think that’s the difference between brutality and violence. One is a negation and the other is an affirmation. And I think the struggle we have in this nation, violence is hard. I don’t think <italic>anyone</italic> likes it. And I know many activists who have been in prison for <italic>many</italic> years, and I don’t think anyone likes living the way they live, nor taking someone’s life. But we <italic>understand</italic> this violence as a fact that will lead to freedom, to the freedom of this nation, and the <italic>rest</italic> of the people who are in this nation. That’s why we fight. … The issue isn’t arms yes, arms no. Violence, armed struggle, yes or no. No. That’s an instrument. Let’s say <italic>why</italic> we act like that, what we want. And in that sense being a woman or a man, I don’t think it changes anything. I don’t consider myself more sensitive than my male comrade, for example.17</p>
            </speech>
         </p>
         <p>Between the first and second references to Genet (to which I return below) the narrator describes the struggle with a pair of domestic metaphors. She compares the activist’s commitment to keeping one’s house in order, making the interior (house) consistent with the exterior (garden). Later she shifts to the image of a cupboard or chest of drawers. I want to consider these domestic metaphors of house, garden, and cupboard with reference to Doreen Massey’s (1994) work on space, place, and gender. Massey advocates a mode of thinking in “space‐time” (1994, 2), one that conceives of space as “constructed out of social relations” (2) and resists conceiving of place as static. This tendency to envision places as fixed can be found in the “exclusivist claims to places” (4) associated with nationalism, regionalism, and localism. These movements “have been attempts to fix the meaning of particular spaces, to enclose them, endow them with fixed identities and to claim them for one’s own” (Massey 1994, 4). In light of this framework for thinking in terms of space‐time, I suggest that the term <italic>house</italic> functions in the above excerpt in different ways, producing seemingly paradoxical political meanings that nevertheless encompass the changing position of the narrator herself, in both space and time and geographically and historically. My understanding of the use of <italic>house</italic> here assumes, following contemporary studies of spatial metaphors, a dialectical relationship between metaphor and materiality (Aiken et al. 1998; Brown 2000).</p>
         <p>In nationalist discourse generally, the term <italic>house</italic> is related to the common metaphor of the nation as family. This connection is even clearer in the original Spanish in which the same word—<italic>casa</italic>—is used to denote both house and home. The sentence “men and women, we’re a house/home” reflects a sentiment akin to “men and women, we’re a family/nation,” a statement reminiscent of nationalist tributes to a timeless homeland and identity. Feminist scholars of nationalism have argued that the trope of the family functions in nationalist discourses to naturalize hierarchies of gender, class, and race (McClintock 1995, 357). But the reference above to housework, to keeping the “house tidy and the garden nice and tidy,” also historicizes the concept <italic>house/home</italic> by evoking a gender division of labor. Elsewhere I have argued that in ETA’s early years the organization was defined in opposition to the family and the home, an ideological division that simultaneously reflected and reinforced the exclusion of women from military activism (Hamilton 2007). The activist above, however, was from a younger generation, one whose political activism was conditioned by wider social and political changes in Basque and Spanish society that saw increasing numbers of women enter the labor force and public political activity. By the time the above narrator joined the organization in the 1970s, 10–15 percent of its membership was female (Hamilton 2007). Members were still represented, however—in visual images, songs, and written documents, for example—as overwhelmingly male. Moreover, women’s nationalist activism was associated predominantly with family and home through the iconic figure of the mother of the male ETA member. In the excerpt above the narrator’s description of activism collapses this popularly perceived gender binary between male activists and female supporters by merging men and women into a single activist, “we.” By rhetorically moving the struggle inside the house/home, the narrator feminizes the armed struggle, claiming the military organization as a place for women as well as men. Because of its multiple rhetorical and historical associations, therefore, the trope <italic>house/home</italic> works to claim a static place (the nation) and timeless national identity while it simultaneously locates the narrator within a history of changing gender relations inside ETA.</p>

               <p>For Arendt this tradition is particularly clear in what she calls the “irresponsible grandiose statements” (1969, 122) in Frantz Fanon’s <italic>The Wretched of the Earth</italic> and especially Jean‐Paul Sartre’s preface to that book. Although it is not possible to locate the source of the above metaphors of violence in any one intellectual or political tradition, there is evidence from my own interviews and the work of other scholars that ETA activists in the 1960s read works by New Left and especially anticolonial thinkers, including Fanon and Sartre (see Zulaika 1988, 285; Letamendia Belzunce 1994, 293). This is the decade when Francoist censorship laws were relaxed somewhat, making previously forbidden texts, including New Left and anticolonial writings, available to a new generation of anti‐Francoist youth. Additionally, from the mid‐1960s onward increasing numbers of ETA members lived in exile in the French Basque country, where they had contact with nonnationalist leftist movements, including Trotskyist and Maoist organizations. Some ETA activists and supporters traveled to or lived in Paris, where they were involved in the youth movements associated with May 1968. Even though Spain, still under a dictatorship, did not experience a 1960s workers’ and student movement in the same form as in its liberal democratic neighbors, anti‐Francoist activists, including ETA members, did engage with some of the same political ideas.</p>

               <p>An early expression of this idea can be found in the 1963 book <italic>Vasconia</italic> by Federico Krutwig ([1963] 1973), which was made part of ETA’s official strategy in the document “Insurección en Euskadi” (republished in Editorial Txalaparta [1993], 272–89).</p>

               <p>The narrator is not referring here to an actual ETA victim but an imaginary example. The use of a typically Castilian forename and surname adds to the sense of the victim as a representative of the Spanish enemy rather than an individual and can be compared with xenophobic portrayals of Civil Guards as stupid Andalusians with mustaches, which sometimes appeared in radical nationalist cartoons in the 1970s and 1980s.</p>

         <title>Reproducing violence</title>
         <p>Following the house/garden metaphor, Narrator 4 quotes almost verbatim an article by the French playwright and novelist Jean Genet titled “Violence and Brutality” ([1977] 2004). The piece was originally written as a preface to a collection of writings by members of the German Red Army Faction and was published in the French newspaper <italic>Le Monde</italic> in September 1977 (see White 1993, 683–89). A few years later a Spanish translation appeared in a special issue on political violence of the leftist Spanish magazine <italic>El Viejo Topo</italic> (Genet n.d.). The article sets up a binary opposition between violence and brutality and a series of related categories: revolution, freedom, life, and the violence of the Red Army Faction versus the system, bureaucracy, technology, and the brutality of the West German government. In the first paragraph of his article, Genet writes: “If we reflect on any vital phenomenon, even in its narrowest, biological sense, we understand that violence and life are virtually synonymous” ([1977] 2004, 171). Following Genet, the above narrator claims that the budding of a seed, the hatching of an egg, and the birth of a child are all acts of violence. As Genet’s biographer Edmund White notes, the argument rests on a “pseudo‐biological” contrast between brutality and violence (White 1993, 688).18</p>
         <p>Through her reference to Genet, Narrator 4 introduces the theme of violence and its relation to reproduction, one that also appears in the interview with an older narrator (Narrator 1). The two women are from different generations, but both were active in ETA for a number of years. Their proximity to ETA violence may help explain both the intensity and the contradictions that characterize their discussions of women’s relationship to political violence. Although both narrators emphatically deny any personal element to political violence, the language of their interviews is most intimate, most rooted in the body, when they refer to violence. The passages I discuss below come in the context of ongoing discussion throughout each interview, between the narrator and me, about the roles of women and men in the military organization. For example, when I asked the older narrator if ETA activism had different meanings for women and men, she declared:</p>

               <p>ETA violence is absolutely political. It has nothing to do with a person’s violent character. That’s something you have to be clear about. ETA violence is absolutely political. It’s not about testicles. It’s not about ovaries. It’s not aggression. It’s a front of struggle. You take up arms not because you’re violent, and because you like violence. No. It’s a way of fighting because unfortunately there are moments when the enemy doesn’t understand any other. … Violence has nothing to do, absolutely nothing to do, with the feminine sex, or with the masculine.</p>

         </p>
         <p>The final statement—“It’s not maternity”—echoes the younger narrator’s objection to the assumption that women are peaceful because they can give birth. Yet the very recurrence of references to motherhood in these and other interviews underlines the difficulty for female activists of constructing a political identity without reference to the mother, the archetypal Basque nationalist female figure. In most of the interviews—not only those cited here—narrators’ attitudes toward motherhood and toward the traditionally celebrated role of mothers in Basque nationalism are marked by ambivalence. More generally there is a tension in the interviews between the frequent motif of the female rebel, which represents a rejection of traditional and restrictive gender roles, including motherhood (Hamilton 2000a), and claims that women and men are different but complementary. In the two interviews cited below the theme of complementary roles surfaces as a caveat to claims of gender equality within ETA:</p>

         </p>
         <p>The joke about Margaret Thatcher conjures the fantasy of the powerful woman who literally becomes a man.21 Moreover, it implies, against the narrator’s previous emphatic claim, that political activism associated with violence is, on some level, “about testicles.” If Thatcher’s balls represent the imagined dangers of excessive female power, testicles function more widely (in Basque and Spanish as in English) as a metaphor for bravery. In her interviews with men formerly active in ETA, for example, Miren Alcedo Moneo records one male narrator’s reference to the <italic>cojonímetro</italic> (ballometer) that ETA militants supposedly used to measure an activist’s commitment and valor (Alcedo Moneo 1996, 217–18). The idea that violence is a naturally virile activity is also evidenced in popular representations of female ETA activists. These representations can be classified in what Karrin Anderson and Kristina Sheeler, following the work of Robert L. Ivie, call “metaphoric clusters” (Anderson and Sheeler 2005, 4). Representations of women in ETA have habitually fallen into the following clusters: the masculinized woman, the girlfriend, and the femme fatale (see Calleja 2001, 269; Antolín 2002, 20).22 Although these metaphoric clusters have changed historically, with the girlfriend model popular in the 1960s and 1970s giving way to the femme fatale by the 1980s, for example (Hamilton 2007), in all three instances women’s participation in political violence has been linked to their sexuality.</p>
         <p>In their study of gender and metaphor in relation to female politicians in the United States, Anderson and Sheeler argue that “metaphors function both as constraints and rhetorical resources for political figures” (2005, 2). Although stereotypical media portrayals contain and constrain female politicians, the women themselves use metaphors in the construction of their own political identities. A similar dual process can be traced in the interviews with female ETA members. As an example, Narrator 4, by citing Genet’s likening of violence to giving birth, has provided an image of women as the privileged agents of violence. Later in her interview she elaborates on this metaphor. Responding to my question about whether activist life was more difficult for women in light of a traditional gender division of roles she states: “I think we did have to demonstrate that we were activists. But activism is not a fact; it’s not a rational fact. I think it’s an impulse and later it’s rational. So it’s a conjunction of both. But at the beginning there’s something that comes from inside you, that you have to let out. And to let out that feeling, that impulse, that reason as well, because it’s not something entirely spontaneous. I think it’s born like that, like it can be born equally in a man, in a male activist.”23 The passage begins with a reference to the experience of women having to prove themselves as armed activists, a popular refrain both among my narrators and in published interviews with female ETA members (del Valle et al. 1985, 246; Alcedo Moneo 1996, 353–66). But almost immediately, as if to preempt any assumption that women had to prove themselves by becoming like men, the passage changes direction, suggesting that it is men who are feminized through violence and specifically through the image of men giving birth. If we read the passage above backward we can trace an image of the activist releasing (letting out) the irrational impulse that has sprouted (literally being born) inside her or his body. The activist—male or female—gives birth to violence.</p>
         <p>As do the female politicians studied by Anderson and Sheeler, this narrator uses metaphor creatively in the construction of her own political identity. But whereas Anderson and Sheeler (2005, 2) interpret their subjects’ use of metaphors as deliberate strategies for attaining “pragmatic goals,” I do not necessarily read the above narrator’s metaphor of male birth as strategic. George Lakoff and Mark Johnson (2003, 272), in their work on metaphor, argue that “metaphorical thought is unavoidable, ubiquitous, and mostly unconscious.” In this light, I would suggest that the metaphor of male birth is an unconscious cultural reconfiguration of the identity of the armed activist that nevertheless has an explicitly political meaning: that violence is not the natural domain of men.</p>
         <p>For Lakoff and Johnson the metaphors that shape all conceptual thought are “grounded in everyday experience” (2003, 272). One of the experiences they discuss is birth, which they claim provides a common metaphor for processes of change. For Lakoff and Johnson metaphors of change that incorporate the ideas of <italic>into</italic> or <italic>out of</italic> “emerge naturally from as fundamental a human experience as there is, namely, birth. … The experience of birth (and also agricultural growth) provides a grounding for the general concept of <sc>creation</sc>, which has at its core the concept of <sc>making</sc> a physical object but which extends to abstract entities as well” (74).</p>
         <p>While this argument is suggestive for the importance of the birth metaphor in Western thinking, I depart from the assessment that birth provides a grounding or natural reference for more abstract concepts. As decades of feminist scholarship have shown, the experiences of birth and motherhood are not natural but are historically contingent and socially and culturally constructed. Rather than considering natural or everyday experience as the basis for metaphors of violence and reproduction in the interviews with female ETA activists, I suggest that the context for the consideration of these reproductive metaphors is the wider set of gendered discourses of war and violence.</p>
         <p>A number of scholars have noted the common motif in Western and non‐Western mythology and literature of men giving birth, especially in relation to war, interpreting this as an example of men’s desire to usurp female power by appropriating women’s most revered—and feared—function: reproduction (Huston 1986; Cohn 1987; Condren 1995). In a recent article Vaheed Ramazani (2003, 26) argues that “the patriarchal appropriation of birthing metaphors serves to naturalize belligerent national ideologies.” Following Ramazani I suggest that birth functions in nationalist military discourses as family does in nationalist discourses more generally. In both cases the metaphor works by replacing a political movement (nationalism or militarism) with a supposedly natural phenomenon (family or birth). This rhetorical move operates simultaneously to justify the political claims of nationalism or militarism as natural—and therefore indisputable in political terms—and to obscure the fundamentally political construction and meanings of family and birth. Both metaphors (nation = family, war = birth) depend, moreover, on a wider conceptual binary: masculine = political, feminine = natural.</p>
         <p>The metaphor of male birth in the example of the interview with Narrator 4 also depends on a process of naturalization, in this case of violence. As in the examples in the first half of this article, where violence is associated with life, the metaphor of violence as birth serves to justify a political cause as natural or inevitable. According to Nancy Huston (1986), Mary Condren (1995), and others, the birth metaphor in male war narratives has functioned historically to appropriate female reproductive power. But what, we may ask, happens to the metaphor of male birth in war when the speaker is a woman and a female combatant at that? I argue that the metaphor also works as an act of appropriation, but in this case by a woman, of a form of power—military power—habitually associated with men.</p>
         <p>As female activists in a nationalist military organization, the two narrators (Narrator 1 and Narrator 4) discussed here were doubly exceptional. On the one hand, in Basque nationalism, as in other nationalist movements, women have been defined historically as mothers, their political roles specified as the reproduction of Basque culture and language as well as giving birth to and rearing new generations of Basque nationalists. On the other hand, in the context of war and conflict women have historically been associated with what Jean Bethke Elshtain has called “history’s Beautiful Soul, a collective being embodying values and virtues at odds with war’s destructiveness, representing home and hearth and the humble verities of everyday life” (Elshtain 1987, xiii). These female ETA activists form part of the group of women Elshtain (1987, 163) has named the “ferocious few” in contrast to the “noncombatant many.” In the context of Basque nationalism the women studied here were also exceptional: like most women active in ETA from the 1960s to 1980s they were not mothers (Hamilton 2007). Their position as exceptional women reflects a paradox noted by Huston (1986, 129) in many Western traditions: childbirth and war are both analogous and mutually exclusive. In other words, male soldiers symbolically “give birth” even while mothers are excluded from the battlefield.</p>
         <p>Historical and contemporary discourses of war and conflict in the Basque country and elsewhere are replete with biological and reproductive metaphors: violence as creativity, the state as body, the political activist’s bravery as balls, and war as birth. In the interviews with women formerly active in ETA references to maternity and birth, like those to male reproductive organs, are overdetermined. While the older narrator cited above insists that political violence is “not about testicles … not about ovaries” (Narrator 1), the repeated references in her and the younger narrator’s interviews to reproductive organs and bodies indicates the impossibility for these female activists of constructing an identity as armed activists outside the language of the body, gender, and sexuality. Nonetheless, the interviews demonstrate the fluidity of language and identity through metaphors that denaturalize the relationship between female and male reproduction and sexuality.</p>

         <title>Violent bodies</title>
         <p>In a chapter titled “Violent Bodies” feminist philosopher Bar On (2002) analyzes the challenges posed for feminism by the production of female violent bodies through women’s self‐defense classes that train women to defend themselves against male violence. Drawing on the work of Arendt, Bar On argues that since the growth of second‐wave feminism in the 1970s in the United States and elsewhere, women’s self‐defense classes have been justified in “ethicopolitical terms” as part of the feminist struggle to eradicate rape and violence against women (158–59). But, she stresses, the appeal of such classes to women cannot be understood strictly in terms of physical self‐defense: “the production of violent women bodies is only in one respect a production of women bodies that are able to defend themselves. In another, it is a production of bodies that break a taboo and are as a result disobedient and transgressive because as implements of violence, they are skilled and competent in ways that are normally reserved for men” (159). To summarize Bar On’s argument, for feminism there is an uncomfortable tension between the transgressive character of women’s violent bodies, on one the hand, and the evidence that women are not immune to the attractions of violence, on the other hand (164–65). The female ETA members and supporters cited above also defend violence in terms of self‐defense, not against rape or male violence but against what they define as the brutality of the Spanish state. Yet the repeated associations in the interviews of violence with creativity, health, life, birth, and the body point to an identification with violence beyond strictly political justifications.</p>
         <p>To paraphrase a question Bar On (2002, 152) asks of her own body as she trains it in women’s self‐defense classes: Are women’s violent bodies different from men’s violent bodies? The interviews above reject—as does most contemporary feminist theory—any biological differences between women and men as an explanation for the differing levels of participation in violence. But historically in the Basque country, as elsewhere, women’s roles in violence and conflict have differed substantially from those of men. If the female narrators cited in this article use a series of bodily metaphors of violence to describe their own relationship to political violence, it is in part because women’s bodies are already constructed in wider discourses in particular ways relating to that violence. The interviews are located in a wider cultural context in which women are associated with being naturally nonviolent and peaceful or being more violent and dangerous than men. As childless activists who took on traditionally male roles in an armed organization, the narrators cited here reject both of these stereotypes, by dissociating violence from the activist’s personality (Narrator 1) or by imagining men giving birth to violence (Narrator 4). In both cases there is an emphatic rejection of the association of maternity with peace. At the same time, the repeated references to reproductive organs as well as the use of domestic metaphors underscore the extent to which the narrators' constructions of their own relationship to violence are implicated in wider cultural associations of violence with gender and sexuality.</p>
         <p>Feminist activism and scholarship (e.g., Enloe 1988) has provided important challenges to discourses and practices of political violence that target and affect women in particular ways. Although such work has not ignored women’s capacity for violence, women nonetheless continue to feature more as victims or vulnerable bodies in feminist scholarship on war and conflict. This imbalance is justified to some extent by the extensive historical evidence of the unequal participation of women and men in political violence. But as Bar On (2002, 164–65) insists, feminists cannot afford to treat as marginal the evidence that “women have acted violently not merely because they are not in control but also because, like men of the same socioculture, they also can find something attractive about violence.” Interviews with women active or formerly active in armed movements do not explain this attraction in any straightforward way. But they do offer, within the context of a feminist critique of the gender politics of conflict, evidence of the ways in which political violence is gendered through narratives of the body and reproduction and evidence of the multiple challenges of constructing a radical discourse and practice of nonviolence.</p>
