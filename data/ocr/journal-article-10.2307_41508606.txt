<plain_text><page sequence="1">Agency and Information Content in Eighteenth- and Early Nineteenth-Century String-Quartet Expositions Ben Duane Abstract This article examines the phenomenon in which musical lines establish what Edward T. Cone calls virtual agents, making the argument that listeners are more likely to ascribe such agency to lines that have high information content (in the formal, information-theoretic sense). I use a computational model, which I have proposed elsewhere, to estimate the information content a listener would perceive when listening to a piece of music. I then compare this model's output to traditional musical analyses of several string-quartet exposi- tions, demonstrating a qualitative correlation between the information content of these expositions and the virtual agents therein. Additionally, I assemble a larger corpus of expositions, many of which deploy virtual agents in a similar manner. Using formal statistical analysis, I show that these similarities can be traced back to the expositions' information content. Thus, both qualitative and quantitative evidence suggest a connection between information and agency in music. people often ascribe agency to nonliving things. Appliances that malfunc- tion in strange ways are said to have "minds of their own." Internet chess players can feel "outsmarted" by virtual opponents, and a mere notched cir- cle, moving after a series of disappearing dots, can become the creature Pac- Man. Even something as abstract as a run of bad luck can be anthropomor- phized (as if "the universe was plotting against you"). The human mind, it seems, is naturally inclined to interpret certain events as the work of living, intelligent agents, even when they clearly are not. This perceptual phenomenon has been demonstrated by numerous sci- entific studies. In one experiment, participants watched an animation (see Figure 1) and reported what they saw (Heider and Simmel 1944). Despite the simplicity of the drawings - and the lack of any humanlike forms - the ani- mation was almost always described in anthropomorphic terms. According to I am grateful to Robert Gjerdingen and Ian Quinn for their helpful comments on earlier drafts of this article.

Naturally, not everyone told exactly the same story. Yet there was some remarkable agreement: thirty-five of thirty-six participants, for example, char- acterized the large triangle as a "bully," and all but one participant provided descriptions that granted some degree of agency and intention to the three shapes. This same perceptual phenomenon - in which humans ascribe agency,</page><page sequence="3">Ben Duane ~ Agency and Information Content 89 Example 1. Berlioz, Symphonie Fantastique , mvt. Ill, mm. 1-4, which contains an obvious dialogue between two virtual agents intention, animacy, interaction, and causality to stimuli that lack them - has since been observed in several other studies.1 The ascription of agency also seems to be important in music percep- tion. Musicians often talk of consequent phrases answering antecedent phrases, or consonances resolving dissonances. And Heinrich Schenker, in a similar vein, titled a collection of analyses Der Tonwille {The Will of Tones [1921-24]). Indeed, Edward T. Cone devoted much of The Composers Voice (1974) to a special case of musically simulated agency: the phenomenon in which listen- ers experience the lines in a texture as what he calls virtual agents. Cone cited the opening of the third movement of Berlioz's Symphonie Fantastique as an example, proposing that this passage be heard as a dialogue between two virtual agents (see Example 1). He had ample reason to advocate this hear- ing, not least of which is Berlioz's program, which explains that the duet represents a conversation between two shepherds (Cone 1974, 87-89). But even without this extramusical association, Cone's hearing seems most natu- ral. The structure of this passage mimics the structure of human dialogue, as if the instruments are taking turns "speaking." It is perhaps obvious that I am concerned with virtual agency as a prod- uct of the listener's perception - as something the listener imagines and ascribes to a musical line rather than as something contained in the music itself.2 But this raises the question of whether this ascription is imminent. Does every listener, on every hearing, ascribe a separate agency to each line from Example 1? This seems doubtful, for each listener approaches a piece with a unique background and perceptual orientation. And in all likelihood, some people are just not inclined to hear music in this anthropomorphic manner (much as one of Heider and Simmel's thirty-six subjects described Figure l's animations without granting intention to the shapes). But this does not mean that musical structure plays no role in prompting some listeners to 1 Michotte 1963, Bassili 1976, Stewart 1982, Tremoulet and Feldman 2000. 2 Naturally, the question of whom exactly listeners ascribe agency to - the composer, the performers, an imaginary persona that embodies the music's overall intelligence, or virtual characters that, metaphorically speaking, people the musical story - is highly complex. These issues, how- ever, lie outside the scope of this article and have already been discussed in depth by several authors (e.g., Cone 1974, Maus 1988, Newcomb 1997).</page><page sequence="4">90 JOURNAL of MUSIC THEORY ascribe agency. It is possible, for example, that lines with certain structural features are more likely than others to be heard as virtual. agents, and in this article I attempt to determine what some of these features might be. I focus not only on the process by which such virtual agents are estab- lished but also on the characteristics that might allow one to distinguish these agents, in Cone's terms, as either leading or subordinate. Some agents, Cone argued, play more prominent roles than others. Melodic lines, for example, tend to occupy the musical foreground, and their virtual agents thereby assume a leading status. On the other hand, accompanying lines typ- ically recede into the background, in which case their virtual agents are sub- ordinate. Cone expands on this distinction: Many instrumental components, although identifiable as [virtual] agents, are relegated to positions in the background of the musical texture, where they function as accompaniment. Under such conditions it would obviously be inap- propriate for them to express their instrumental personalities obtrusively, but that does not mean they must lack character. Indeed, one test of well-written music is the extent to which accompanying agents, while clearly subordinate, are individualized. (1974, 96) According to Cone, virtual agents can be found anywhere in a musical tex- ture, but the effect of agency tends to be more palpable and obvious in the case of nonaccompanying lines - that is, lines that establish leading agents. These two musical phenomena - the simulation of agency and the estab- lishment of leading status - together comprise a central component of tex- ture, one whose musical ramifications are often extensive. Take, for example, the passage in Example 2, which includes the transition and the start of the second theme from the exposition of Beethoven's string quartet in С minor, op. 18/4, mvt. I. Even without invoking the notion of leading virtual agents, this excerpt is complex. Measure 25 contains a half cadence in the first key (C minor), followed by a distinct pause, which in itself forms a textbook medial caesura, as James Hepokoski and Warren Darcy call it (2006). Unex- pectedly, however, this half cadence is followed not by the second theme in the second key (El» major) but by a passage in At major (mm. 26-29) and then F minor (mm. 30-33). Hepokoski and Darcy characterize this passage as "a shift to a new module, non sequitur, [followed by] a sequential seeking of a preferable" medial caesura - one that is paired with a half cadence in the exposition's second key (Et major; Hepokoski and Darcy 2006, 46). This sec- ond half cadence occurs at m. 33, after which the second theme finally begins. But this is not the whole story. While Hepokoski and Darcy (2006) describe mm. 26-33 as a surprising and inessential harmonic interpolation, these bars play a more critical role with respect to texture. Here, for the first time in the exposition, a second leading agent is continuously and unambigu- ously present, which means this is also the listener's first chance to become fully aware of this agent (indeed, the only chance before the subordinate theme). This awareness is crucial, for the start of the subordinate theme not</page><page sequence="5">Ben Duane ~ Agency and Information Content 91 Example 2. Beethoven's string quartet, op. 18/4, mvt.

Important formal events are marked by labels enclosed in rectangles. only continues to employ these two leading agents but also changes their relationship. At the end of the transition, the two agents are equals, part of an even-handed contrapuntal dialogue. Beginning in the second theme, how- ever, one agent becomes markedly subordinate, serving merely to punctuate the second violin's subphrases. The second theme thus brings with it a major change in the status of this second agent, and such a change is only as clear and audible as this agent's presence in the passage beforehand. Thus, mm. 26-33 are not just an incidental detour. They can be heard, at least in retro- spect, as a crucial stage in the unfolding of the exposition - a sort of textural foil to the beginning of the second theme. Despite the influence of leading virtual agents on the perceived shape of this and countless other excerpts, relatively little is known about them. Cone, of course, provided a powerful and elegant theoretical framework with which to explain the place of leading virtual agents in instrumental music. What he did not address, at least not formally, is the question of how such</page><page sequence="7">Ben Duane ~ Agency and Information Content 93 agents are established in the first place. How does a musical line - a mere series of notes - become a vehicle of agency? And what distinguishes a lead- ing agent from a subordinate one? Other authors have taken up the question of how agency is simulated. Fred Maus, for example, suggests that human listeners ascribe agency to musi- cal events by way of a "scheme of explanation or interpretation [that] works by identifying events as actions and offering a distinctive kind of explanation for those events. The explanations ascribe sets of psychological states to an agent, states that make the action appear reasonable to the agent and that cause the action" (1988, 66). Anthony Newcomb (1997) has proposed a similar theory. Although neither author directly addresses the question of how musical lines establish virtual agents, their theories could certainly be applied to this issue. For example, when listening to the Berlioz excerpt in Example 1, one might, in Maus's terms, explain the oboe's line as the action of a virtual agent whose psychological state prompted the agent to respond to the English horn's line. Therefore, Maus's and Newcomb 's work might represent important fac- tors in the creation of virtual agents. This article, however, argues for the effect of rather different factors - ones that, while perhaps coextensive with those outlined by Maus and Newcomb, derive less from high-level cognitive processes like the analysis of psychological states and more from a listener's natural sensitivity to the probabilistic structure of musical lines (both the line currently being heard and lines heard in the past that contributed to the lis- tener's implicit knowledge of musical style). I quantify these other factors using information content (in the formal, information-theoretic sense). As discussed below, a small number of authors have already employed concepts from information theory in examining the difference between accompanying and nonaccompanying lines - in other words, between lines that create subordinate and leading virtual agents. This article builds upon these studies by arguing that information content plays a role in establishing not just leading status but virtual agency itself. With the aid of a computational model, I first show that the distribution of leading agents in the Beethoven exposition analyzed above closely resembles the dis- tribution of information content. I then perform statistical analyses on a cor- pus of string-quartet expositions, many of which deploy leading agents in a similar manner. These analyses reveal trends consistent with the hypothesis that information helps to generate leading virtual agency. Before proceed- ing, however, I provide a brief introduction to information theory and explain why this hypothesis is a plausible one. Agency and Information Content Information content is a quantity derived from, and inversely proportional to, probability: I(x) = -log2p(x), (1)</page><page sequence="8">94 JOURNAL of MUSIC THEORY Figure 2. Relationship between probability and information content where I(x) and p(x) are the information content and probability of some event X (see Figure 2; Shannon 1948). In the computational model tested below, each event a; is a note. The information contents of all notes in a line, when taken together, reflect the line's overall predictability. Notes with high probability (and low information content) yield predictable lines. Notes with low probability (and high information content) yield unpredictable lines.3 The predictability of lines might play an important role in determining whether any virtual agents they create are leading or subordinate. While leading agents are established by such lines as melodies and countermelo- dies, subordinate agents are created by accompaniments, and the former seem generally to be less repetitive and predictable than the latter (at least in eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century string quartets). Consider the excerpt in Example 3. The first violin's melody is far less repetitive, with respect to both rhythm and pitch, than any line in the accompaniment. And the countermelody, though brief, also contains more rhythmic variety than most of the accompaniment. These differences are evident in this excerpt's information content, which is plotted in Figure 3. Not only does the melody create the highest information content, but the countermelody causes a brief increase of information in the second violin and viola. I have also found some empirical evidence that information content is higher in melodies, countermelodies, and the like than it is in accompanying 3 Over the last several decades, numerous music theorists have applied tools and concepts from information theory to the study of musical structure. Although this research is not directly pertinent here, it is worth citing some rep- resentative examples: Youngblood 1958; Meyer 1967a, 1967b; Hiller and Fuller 1967; Knopoff and Hutchinson 1981, 1983; Snyder 1990; Pearce and Wiggins 2004; Huron 2006; Temperley 2007; and Margulis and Beatty 2008.</page><page sequence="9">Ben Duane ~ Agency and Information Content 95 Example 3.

Information content of each string part in Example 3, as computed by the model described below lines.4 Figure 4 shows the average information content of approximately 35,000 notes drawn from a corpus of twenty-eight string-quartet expositions, the lines of which I categorized as establishing either leading or subordinate agents based on my own musical judgment.5 (The contents of this corpus are described in more detail below.) Information content tends to be higher in leading lines than in subordinate lines, with this difference being statistically significant (¿(34,890) = 7.86, p&lt; 0.001 by a two-sample ¿-test).6 Additionally, two other studies have reported evidence that information entropy, which is closely related to information content, tends to be higher in melodic than in accompanying lines (Duane 2010, Madsen and Widmer 2006). But perhaps there are deeper theoretical grounds for asserting that information content is a factor in the creation of leading virtual agents. It is plausible, I would suggest, that lines with higher information content create a stronger effect of virtual agency ipso facto. To my knowledge, this conjecture has not been tested empirically, but it does seem reasonable. One of the hall- 4 I have also reported on this data elsewhere (Duane, 2011, forthcoming). 5 In cases where a line could plausibly be heard in two ways - as either an accompanying line or a doubling of the melody, for example - both possible analyses were recorded. In the statistical analysis, one of these possibili- ties was chosen at random. 6 The two-sample f-test, like most statistical tests, is based on a p-value, which is an estimate of the probability that any difference between the means of two groups is the sole result of random chance. If this p-value is suffi- ciently low - with the usual cutoff being 0.05 - then the difference is said to be statistically significant, meaning that it is reasonable to conclude that there is some bona fide difference between the two groups. All i-tests in this article are reported with not only a p-value but also the ř-statistic and degrees of freedom (the parenthesized value beside t) from which this p-value is computed.</page><page sequence="11">Ben Duane ~ Agency and Information Content 97 Figure 4. Mean information content of 34,892 notes, taken from lines in the exposition corpus that would establish either leading or subordinate agents. Information content was computed using the model described below. Error bars show standard error. marks of sounds governed by intelligent agents is surely their lack of simple predictability. While waves crash against a shore at fairly regular intervals, an agitated dog will often bark in a much less isochronous pattern. Emergency sirens repeat unvaried, whereas humans in distress usually cry out with much less monotonous series of screams and exclamations. The human mind might thus pay attention to the regularity of acoustic stimuli and be more likely to ascribe agency to less predictable ones. If so, then a line s information con- tent might reflect not just its status as leading or subordinate but also the strength of its virtual agency. Information Tracking Model In what follows, I employ a computational model that I designed to simulate a listener's perception of the information content of musical lines.7 The model calculates a single value for each note in a line, and, as shown in Fig- ure 5, this value is computed in four stages. In the first stage, nine informa- tion values (based on three musical parameters crossed with three sources of 7 I have presented this model elsewhere as well (Duane, 2011, forthcoming). Marcus Pearce and Geraint Wiggins (e.g., 2006) have also proposed a perceptual model of information content in musical lines. However, while their model was designed primarily to study melodic expecta- tion, mine is intended to examine the difference between melodies and other types of lines. Our models thus differ on several counts: (1) their model does not, like mine, simu- late the accrual of information in memory; (2) their model computes information content at higher probabilistic orders than mine does; (3) their model does not, like mine, com- pute probabilities from just the current phrase; (4) their model averages across probabilistic orders, while my model selects one order for each note; and (5) their model, unlike mine, weights certain musical parameters more highly than others. These differences are further discussed below.</page><page sequence="12">98 JOURNAL of MUSIC THEORY Figure 5. Overall structure of the information-tracking model probability estimates) are computed for the note being analyzed. Example 4 illustrates the three musical parameters - a contour interval, a normal melodic interval, and a rhythmic duration - that are associated with each note in a line. The melodic interval is the number of diatonic steps by which the note is approached, and the contour interval is the direction of this melodic inter- val, irrespective of size. As a mathematical convenience, the rhythmic dura- tion is transformed by the logarithm and rounded to the nearest integer. These three musical parameters, of course, do not reflect harmony or meter, meaning that the model does not directly account for these two impor- tant aspects of musical structure. While harmony and meter certainly might influence the creation of musical information, their inclusion did not seem necessary or appropriate in the present study. The goal here was to investi- gate a more general connection between information content and leading virtual agency, with particular focus on the basic structural features that likely shape the musical experiences of listeners in general. While the readers of this journal are presumably well attuned to harmony and meter as listen- ers, this is unlikely to be true of all listeners, especially those with little or no</page><page sequence="13">Ben Duane ~ Agency and Information Content 99 Example 4. Violin I line from Beethoven's op. 18/1, mvt. I, mm. 1-8, annotated with the melodic intervals and rhythmic durations associated with each note musical training. The experience of such novices might be governed more by simple features such as contour and relative temporal durations than by more complex structures such as harmonic progressions and hierarchies of metric accents. The investigation of these structures' relationships to information content and leading virtual agency is therefore left to future research. Thus, the nine information values computed in stage 1 of the model are based on each note's rhythmic duration and melodic and contour intervals, and these information values are derived from the probabilities of these durations and intervals. These probabilities are computed from three sources: all preceding notes in the line under analysis, all preceding notes in the cur- rent phrase of this line (phrase boundaries are determined automatically using an algorithm proposed in Cambouropoulos 1997), and all string parts from a second corpus, containing 242 movements taken from eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century string quartets. To construct this larger corpus, I retrieved all string-quartet movements by Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, and Mendelssohn available in the Classical Archives, an online repository of MIDI files (www.classicalarchives.com/index.html). These movements totaled 261, of which nineteen were excluded due to technical problems with the files. These three sources of probability estimates - the current line, the current phrase, and the large corpus - are meant to simulate different types of knowledge on the part of listeners. The current line reflects their evolv- ing apprehension of the entire string part as it unfolds. The current phrase represents their immediate experience of recent musical events. And the corpus models their larger familiarity with the style of eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century string quartets. All three types of knowledge presumably figure into a listener's experience.</page><page sequence="14">100 JOURNAL of MUSIC THEORY Example 5. Beethoven op. 18/1, mvt. I, mm. 49-55, violin II part, which contains an obvious repetition of a short motive. The statements of this interval are bracketed, each note's contour interval (ascending, descending, or unison) is indicated, and the computation of one note's information content, at the first four probabilistic orders, is illustrated. The nine information values are computed at four probabilistic orders, each of which analyzes the note of concern in the context of different num- bers of preceding notes. Such contexts of analysis reflect an important factor in musical structure. The line in Example 5, for instance, contains an obvious repetition of a four-note motive. But first-order information content would not capture this repetition, since at this order notes are analyzed in isolation. Only when computed at higher orders, where notes are analyzed in the con- text of one or more of their predecessors, would information content say something of this important aspect of the line's structure. Example 5 illustrates the computation of information content with respect to contour for the final note of the final statement of the repeated motive. This note is approached by a descending interval, and first-order information is derived from p(l), the probability of a descending interval during the preceding notes. Since these preceding notes comprise nineteen intervals, five of which are descending, p(i) = 5/19. This same note's second- order information content is based on p{ï | (Î)), the probability of a descend- ing interval, given that it is directly preceded by an ascending interval. This probability is computed from the eighteen two-interval sequences contained in the preceding notes. Of these eighteen sequences, six begin with an ascending interval, and four of these six are followed by a descending inter- val, which means that p(i | (Î)) = 4/6. The note's third- and fourth-order information contents are computed similarly, just with the preceding one-</page><page sequence="15">Ben Duane ~ Agency and Information Content 101 interval sequence, (T), substituted with the preceding two- and three-interval sequences, (u, Î) and (и, u, Î).8 Each probabilistic order simulates a different processing strategy on the part of the listener. At the first order, intervals and durations are pro- cessed one at a time. At the second order, each interval and duration is pro- cessed in the context of its immediate predecessor; in other words, intervals and durations are processed in chunks of two. And at the third and fourth orders, intervals and durations are processed in chunks of three and four. These different processing strategies are appropriate to different musical situations. For instance, it makes sense to process the D5 circled in Example 5 at the third order, since it comes at the end of a repeating chunk of four notes (creating three intervals). But the final note of this excerpt is not part of such a repetition and is perhaps best processed at the first order. While human listeners might, on some cognitive level, employ some or all of these processing strategies simultaneously, the model makes the simpli- fying assumption that each note is primarily interpreted through one strat- egy alone. Therefore, stage 2 of the model selects the order (separately for each note and each of the nine information values) that assigns the highest probability to the note under analysis - in other words, the order that best explains this note. In the case of the final note of the final statement of the repeating motive in Example 5, the third order would be chosen. Stage 3 of the model simulates the accrual of information in a listener's memory, which is modeled using a weighted sum of the form ^mem (Current note) = /raw (Current note) + ^ S n;mem (Preceding note) /raw( Preceding note), Preceding notes where /mem represents the information in memory once the current note is heard, /raw is one of the nine values produced in stage 2 of the model, zvmem is a weighting function that simulates the decay of memory over time, and the sum X is computed across all preceding notes in the line under Preceding notes analysis. To my knowledge, there exists no empirical psychological evidence about what form the function wmem should take. I therefore opted for an inverse exponential function, which previous authors have used to model memory in music perception (e.g., Huron and Parncutt 1993). This function, graphed in Figure 6, equals 1 when the current note begins immediately after the preceding note ends. In this case, the preceding note's information, which has had no time to decay in memory, would be multiplied by 1 and thus con- tribute fully to the sum in Equation 2. But as the time between the preceding 8 It would be possible, of course, to compute information content at even higher orders, but for the purpose of dis- tinguishing leading and subordinate agents, the first four proved adequate. This fact is encouraging, since it sug- gests that lines can establish themselves as leading or subordinate in the span of only four or five notes.</page><page sequence="16">102 JOURNAL of MUSIC THEORY Figure 6.

(The Appendix contains more detail about how this sum is calculated.) At least two similarities are evident between this curve and my analysis of the excerpt. Information content increases starting in the transition section, which, unlike the first theme, often contains a second leading agent. And information tends to be higher in the second half of the transition than it is in the first, perhaps because the second leading agent is more continuously and convincingly present in the latter. Both differences are even more obvious in Figure 7b, which contains a smoothed version of the curve in Figure 7a. (The algorithm used to perform this smoothing is detailed in the Appendix.) Yet the consistency between Beethoven's exposition and the curves in Figure 7 involves just one piece of music and does little to establish a more general connection between information content and leading virtual agency. It would be preferable to evaluate this connection using a larger sample of pieces and more rigorous methods of quantitative analysis. To that end, I have assembled a corpus of twenty-eight first-movement expositions from eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century string quartets, including the one from Example 2 (see Table 2). Many of these expositions deploy leading virtual agents in much the same way as the Beethoven exposition analyzed above. In fact, I would sug- gest that that exposition is actually an instance of a more general archetypal layout employed in numerous first-movement expositions from eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century quartets. This layout, which I shall refer to below as the emerging second persona , is as follows: • The first theme (and the introduction, if present) employs only tex- tures with one leading virtual agent. • A second leading virtual agent then emerges, usually during the tran- sition section. Sometimes, however, this second agent appears shortly before the transition, in what I will refer to as an extension of the first theme - a passage that is rhetorically connected to the first theme but occurs after it has come to a melodic and harmonic close. • This second leading virtual agent remains present until the begin- ning of the second theme. • During the second theme and codetta (if present), textures with two leading virtual agents are used freely, though perhaps not constantly. The exposition from Example 2 follows this layout, as detailed in Table 3. And so does the exposition from the first movement of Beethoven's op. 18/1 (see Table 4 and Example 6). The first theme proper vacillates between two textures (see Example 6, a and b), both of which contain only one leading agent. Then, during an extension of the first theme and the subsequent tran-</page><page sequence="18">104 JOURNAL of MUSIC THEORY Figure 7.

If leading agency is a function of information content, then the total information curves of expositions with such emerging second personae ought to exhibit certain similarities - ones consistent with the structure of this archetypal layout. Moreover, at least some of these similarities should not be shared by other expositions. The statistical analyses reported below test for the existence of such similarities. To conduct these analyses, I first categorized the expositions in the corpus according to whether they did (n = 22) or did not ( n = 6) contain emerging second personae. I then analyzed each exposition's form, record- ing the locations of four sections: first theme, transition, second theme, and codetta. One exposition contained no transition section, and another lacked a codetta. Both of these expositions were omitted from all plots and statistical tests below.

As one would expect, the expositions with emerging second personae feature a clear increase in information content starting around the transi- tion. Moreover, the other expositions tend to increase in information content more quickly during the first theme and transition, a difference that one could expect for two reasons. First, since expositions with emerging second personae employ only one leading agent for most of the first theme, their information content should be limited during this section. The same limita- tion, however, would not necessarily apply to other expositions. Second, while the former expositions are limited to textures with either one or two leading agents, the latter expositions are free to use textures with three or four. Expo- sitions of this second type might thus reach higher peaks of information con- tent, as they appear to do. In order to evaluate these statistical trends more formally, a two-factor analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was performed. This ANCOVA tested 9 These smoothed information values were used for all statistical tests reported below. As Figure 7a illustrates, unsmoothed total information curves usually contain a great deal of random, moment-to-moment variation. When testing for larger trends, such as an overall difference in information content between sections, this random varia- tion seemed to add so much statistical noise that these trends could not be observed with sufficient confidence. The smoothing algorithm proved an effective method of filtering out this statistical noise.</page><page sequence="21">Ben Duane ~ Agency and Information Content 107 Example 6.

This ANCOVA also controlled for a property of the information track- ing model that could otherwise confound the results.

These curves are described in more detail in the Appendix. and this function's output is used as a covariate in the ANCOVA, thereby removing this biasing trend from the statistical analysis.10 10 More about how ANCOVA controls for the effect of covariates can be found in Kutner et al. 2004. The ANCOVA model assumes a linear relationship between the covariate and the statistical trend being controlled for, without which one cannot trust that the bias was fully eliminated (Kutner et al. 2004). But, as explained in the Appendix, such a rela- tionship can be expected to hold in this case.</page><page sequence="23">Ben Duane ~ Agency and Information Content 109 Figure 9. Estimated marginal means of the smoothed total information content in the four sections of expositions with and without emerging second personae. Error bars show standard errors. The ANCOVA showed a significant main effect of exposition type (F(l, 511) = 35.68, p &lt; 0.001), indicating that expositions which contained an emerging second persona had significantly lower information content than those that did not (see Figure 9).11 These results are consistent with the hypothesis that, in expositions with an emerging second persona, informa- tion content is limited by the presence of just one leading agent in the first theme and just two leading agents thereafter. The ANCOVA also revealed a significant main effect of section (F( 3, 511) = 23.70, p&lt; 0.001). Follow-up contrasts, which compared first themes to each subsequent section individually, showed that transitions, second themes, and codettas all had significantly higher information content than did first themes (p&lt; 0.001 in all three cases) (see Figure 9). However, since this finding reflects both types of expositions, it cannot be interpreted in terms of the presence or absence of an emerging second persona. To address this issue, we must examine the interaction between exposi- tion type and section, which also proved significant (F( 3, 511) = 3.75, p = 0.01). To investigate this interaction, two one-factor ANCOVAs, with section as the grouping variable, were performed: one for expositions with emerging second personae, and another for those without. (The ^-values for these ANCOVAs 11 For each main effect and interaction, the ANCOVA returns a p-value, much as the two-sample f-test does (see note 6). In this article, all p-values from ANCOVAs are reported alongside an F-statistic and two degrees of free- dom (parenthesized next to the F) from which the p-values are calculated.</page><page sequence="24">110 JOURNAL of MUSIC THEORY were doubled in order to correct for the two tests.)12 In expositions that con- tained an emerging second persona, there was a significant main effect of section (F(3, 415) = 47.02, p&lt; 0.001), and contrasts showed that transitions, second themes, and codettas all had significantly higher information content than did first themes (p&lt; 0.001 in all three cases) (see Figure 9). In the other expositions, this effect was not significant (F(3, 95) = 2.35, p = 0.15). More- over, the contrasts indicated that only transitions and codettas had signifi- cantly higher information than did first themes (transitions, p = 0.02; second themes, p = 0.29; codettas, p = 0.03). And if these /^-values were tripled to correct for the three tests, as they arguably should be, especially in the absence of a main effect, none of the differences would be statistically sig- nificant.13 These results, then, suggest that information content tends to increase after first themes in the presence of an emerging second persona, perhaps because the introduction of a second leading agent is so consistently located at or near the beginning of the transition. This trend is far weaker and perhaps nonexistent in expositions without emerging second personae. To further investigate the interaction found in the original ANCOVA, four two-sample i-tests were performed, one for each section.14 (Again, the jb-values were corrected, in this case quadrupled since four tests were per- formed.) These ¿-tests revealed that, during first themes and transitions, infor- mation content was significantly lower in expositions with emerging second personae (first themes, ¿(128) = 4.15, p&lt; 0.001; transitions, ¿(128) = 4.97, p&lt; 0.001) (see Figure 9). These differences, however, were not significant for the other two sections (second themes, ¿(128) = 0.79, p = 1; codettas, ¿(128) = 2.36, p = 0.08). Why there should be a stronger difference between the two types of expositions during first themes is obvious: expositions with emerging second personae, unlike the others, limit themselves to one leading agent during this section. The reason for this strong difference during transitions is less obvi- ous but is perhaps due to the contrapuntal textures often used in these sec- tions. After all, transitions tend to be the texturally most active sections of expositions - and the most likely to involve two, three, or even four leading agents. This increase in textural complexity might have created more infor- mation content in the transitions of expositions without emerging second personae. And while expositions with emerging second personae also become 12 The performance of two tests in tandem doubles the likelihood of obtaining a p-value &lt; 0.05 merely by random chance. It is appropriate, therefore, to double the p-values in order to compensate. This procedure is known as the Bonferroni correction and is discussed more extensively in Kutner et al. 2004. 13 Such a correction is not always made, since contrasts are designed to investigate a specifically hypothesized dif- ference. However, contrasts are typically not analyzed at all if the main effect is not significant. More on this issue can be found in Kutner et al. 2004. 14 These t- tests, of course, do not control for the covariate used in the ANCOVA, but since this covariate is unlikely to be correlated with the exposition-type variable, such con- trol did not seem necessary.</page><page sequence="25">Ben Duane ~ Agency and Information Content 111 more contrapuntal during the transition, they limit themselves to textures with just two leading agents. To summarize, then, the statistical tests above revealed two trends con- sistent with the hypothesis that information content helps to create emerging second personae (and leading virtual agency more generally). First, informa- tion content was lower overall in expositions with emerging second personae, with this difference being especially strong during first themes and transi- tions. This discrepancy might result from these expositions, unlike others, limiting themselves to one leading agent during the first theme and to two leading agents thereafter. Second, in expositions with emerging second per- sonae, information content tended to be lower in first themes than in subse- quent sections. This trend was far less apparent in the other expositions and reached statistical significance only in part and only after questionable meth- odological liberties were taken. Conclusion Strangely little is known about the phenomenon of leading virtual agency in instrumental music. While several authors since Cone have written about agency in music, they have tended not to concern themselves with virtual agents per se. When agency is discussed, it is usually an agency embodied not in individual lines but in all components of a phrase, a section, or some inter- action thereof - an agency more akin to what Cone calls the complete musical persona (1974, 1-19). This research, valuable as it is, does not directly address the creation of virtual agents, much less the establishment of leading status. Yet leading virtual agency is hardly inconsequential to the musical experience, for to anthropomorphize lines, their interaction, and their rela- tive prominence is a natural - even inescapable - urge for many listeners. (Indeed, in the case of novice listeners, who might be minimally attuned to pitch, rhythm, phrasing, and harmony, leading virtual agency could be even more central to their engagements with music.) That this topic has been sel- dom researched has perhaps been due to an absence of sufficient method- ological tools. After all, such research requires some assessment of the struc- tural features of lines, and these features are considerable in number. Most lines consist of a dozen or more notes, each characterized by several features, such as duration, metric strength, and various types of pitch intervals. To assess all, or even an adequate subset, of these features simultaneously might require a type of mathematical apparatus not commonplace in the field. And the implementation of this apparatus might only be feasible with the aid of software that has not always been widely available or widely used by music theorists. We must also consider the fact that musical lines - or at least melodic lines - are usually designed to be unique, and any study of the com- monalities among lines must contend with these considerable differences</page><page sequence="26">112 JOURNAL of MUSIC THEORY between them. Perhaps this high amount of variance calls for the sort of sta- tistical, corpus-based methods that are just now finding their way into music- theoretic research.15 This article used several of these methodological tools to examine the connection between leading virtual agency and information content. The theoretical reasons to expect such a connection were outlined, and this the- ory was tested in two ways. First, an excerpt from a Beethoven string quartet was analyzed, and its leading virtual agents were compared qualitatively to the information content likely to be perceived in this excerpt (estimated using a computational model). Second, a corpus of string-quartet expositions was assembled, their use of leading virtual agents analyzed, and these analyses compared statistically to the expositions' information content. Both the qual- itative and quantitative analyses yielded results consistent with the article's overall hypothesis: lines with higher information content are more likely both to create the effect of virtual agency and to. assume leading status.16 In evaluating this hypothesis, I exploited a stylistic regularity shared by most expositions in the corpus: an archetypal layout wherein the first theme employs just one leading agent and a second leading agent is introduced in the transition section or just before. The addition of a second agent in these expositions was mirrored by an increase in information content between their first themes and subsequent sections (a trend that was far weaker and arguably nonexistent in the rest of the corpus). So much is also evident in Figure 10, which serves as a final illustration of this article's primary argu- ment. This graph contains the information content of two expositions (both discussed above) that follow the archetypal layout, along with one exposition that does not. In this third exposition, outlined in Table 5, the second leading agent appears soon after the first theme begins, not after it has ended (see Example 7). Similarly, as illustrated in Figure 10, the information content of this first theme increases notably sooner than that of the other two, which, like the evidence presented above, supports the hypothesis that leading vir- tual agency is partly a function of information content. Assuming that this hypothesis is correct, it raises two reciprocally related questions. First, is information content the only factor at play - is high infor- mation the one necessary and sufficient condition in establishing leading 15 Numerous recent studies of musical structure have employed statistical analysis of corpora, especially in the last decade. Such corpora have been used to test and refine theories of harmony (Tymoczko 2003, Temperley 2009, de Clercq and Temperley 2011), melody (Huron 1996, Von Hippel and Huron 2000), motivic association (Huron 2001), voice-leading schemata (Gjerdingen 1988, 2007, Byros 2009), and rhythm and meter (Huron and Ommen 2006, VanHandel 2009). 16 In the interest of stimulating further research on this topic, I have posted a number of items on the Web at benduane .org/research.html. These include the data set analyzed above, the Matlab functions with which the information- tracking model was implemented, and a user-friendly stand- alone application that produces plots like those in Figure 7 from any MIDI file and can write these data to a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet. Hopefully, this will allow other music theorists not only to continue this research but also to use the computational tools I have developed in their own musi- cal analyses.</page><page sequence="27">Ben Duane ~ Agency and Information Content 113 Figure 10.

Probably not. The creation of such agents is likely more com- plex, involving the cooperation of numerous aspects of musical structure and performance, which are left to future research. Second, does information content reflect anything besides the pres- ence or absence of leading virtual agents? The work of Leonard B. Meyer, one of the first music theorists to appropriate concepts from information theory, suggests the answer is yes. More than forty years ago, Meyer devoted two essays to arguing that the information content of musical entities is a deter-</page><page sequence="28">114 JOURNAL of MUSIC THEORY Example 7.

I, mm. 1-8, comprising the movement's opening phrase and a counterstatement to it, in which a second leading agent is introduced minant, or at least a correlate, of both musical meaning and aesthetic value (Meyer 1967a, 1967b). Music is high in information when it contains many events with low probability. Under Meyer's theories, such events contain the most meaning, since they effect the strongest violations of a listener's expec- tations. And, Meyer contends, it is the improbable - that which does not take the most obvious path from point A to point В - that has the most aesthetic value. Taken with the results above, Meyer's arguments suggest that the musi- cal processes that give rise to information are the same that give rise not only to leading virtual agency but also to meaning and value. Put differently, music is designed, with the help of some grand structural coincidences, such that the lines in the foreground are also the most meaningful, the most valu- able, and the most mistakable for intelligent utterances.</page><page sequence="29">Ben Duane ~ Agency and Information Content 115 Appendix In what follows, three quantities referred to in the text are defined formally: total infor- mation content (graphed in Figure 7a), smoothed total information content (graphed in Figures 7b, 8, and 10), and the covariate used in the ANCOVAs. I also describe what I call textural strands, since they figured into the computation of total information con- tent. Whenever a variable is defined, this definition holds for the rest of the Appendix. Textural Strands When annotating the corpus, I recorded the textural strands present in each exposition. In some textures, of course, the four string parts move indepen- dently and thereby comprise four separate strands, which would likely be heard as what psychologists would call four auditory streams (see Bregman 1990). In other textures, one or more subsets of the four parts cooperate, forming one or more larger strands. The annotations indicate the textural strands in each measure of each exposition. For measures that could plausibly be heard in more than one way - or in which different parts of the measure contain different textural strands - all possible sets of strands were recorded. Total Information Content Let /(/, t) be the output of the information tracking model for line I at time t. If a note is sounding in line I at time t , then 1(1 , t ) is the mean information value computed for this note in stage 4 of the model. If line I contains a rest at time t , then /(/, t ) is the mean information value for the note that directly precedes this rest, weighted by the memory decay function. To compute the total information content, the excerpt under analysis is divided into a set, S, of contiguous segments, with a new segment begin- ning at every time point where at least one instrument starts or ends a note. For each segment s g S, let Start(s) be the time point at which s begins, and let Strands(s) be the set of textural strands present in s, according to the cor- pus annotations. In cases where more than one analysis is indicated, one of these analyses is chosen at random. For each strand G g Strands(s), let /(a) be the mean of /(/, Start(s)) for the lines, /, of all string parts that are part of strand a.17 The total information content is computed for each segment s g S and is defined as the sum of the mean information contents for all the textural strands present: I /(o) (3) seStrands(s) 17 Since the information-tracking model accepts only monophonie lines as input, certain notes needed to be dropped when string parts contained multistops. In these cases, only the highest note of the string part was included in the input to the model.</page><page sequence="30">116 JOURNAL of MUSIC THEORY Figure 11. Illustration of the smoothing algorithm using the unsmoothed total information content plotted in Figure 7a. Each arc below the graph shows the boundaries of one time bin. Smoothed Total Information Content As Figure 11 illustrates, each section of the exposition under analysis - first theme, transition, second theme, codetta - is divided into five evenly spaced, overlapping time bins. The overlap between these bins is half the length of the bins themselves. An exposition's smoothed total information content is defined as the median total information content in each of its time bins. Once smoothed, the information content in Figure 11 (which is the same as that plotted in Figure 7a) is transformed into the twenty data points plotted in Figure 7b. Covariate Employed in the ANCOVAs Equation 2, reprinted below as Equation 4, will tend to increase as a piece unfolds, since the longer a piece goes on, the more notes there are to include in this equation's sum: ^rnem (Current note) = /raw (Current note) + ^ S и/щеп, (Preceding note) /raw( Preceding note), Preceding notes Let / be the number of seconds from the beginning of the piece under analysis to the onset of the current note. Assuming that /raw (Preceding note) is statistically independent from the times at which preceding notes</page><page sequence="31">Ben Duane ~ Agency and Information Content 117 occur, the expected increase of /mem is proportional to that of the following expression:18 S aWm (Preceding note) (5) Preceding notes The value of this sum depends on the number of preceding notes, and assum- ing that the temporal placement of notes follows a uniform distribution, the expected number of preceding notes is proportional to L But t alone is insufficient to estimate the expected increase, since it is also affected by the weighting function, wmem. This function is defined as X t¿;mem (Preceding note) = 1 - eXn0 5/6, (6) Preceding notes where 8 is the number of seconds between the offset of the preceding note and the onset of the current note. To account for wmem, it is helpful to realize that t is equivalent to the area of a rectangle with horizontal endpoints 0 and ¿and vertical endpoints 0 and 1 (see Figure 12a). The top border of this rect- angle, then, can be thought of as the output of a hypothetical weighting func- tion that always equals 1. To compensate for the actual weighting function, ttWm, the rectangle's top border may be replaced with this function's curve, and the area underneath this curve may be calculated (see Figure 12b). Thus, the expected increase of /mem is proportional to the integral Jl - eia0-5/,-''dť. (7) 0 Given this relationship, the integral above is a suitable covariate with which to control for the expected increase of /mem. Unfortunately, this integral has no real solution for positive values of t , so its value was estimated using the midpoint rule (with a hop size of 0.001 seconds; see Stewart 2001). This esti- mate was the covariate used in the ANCOVAs reported above. 18 I use the word proportional in the strict mathematical sense. That is, two functions, x and y, are proportional if and only if there exists some constant с such that y(t) = cx(t) for all t. I also use the term statistical independence in the formal sense, meaning that two random variables, A and B, are statistically independent if and only if p(A = а л B= b) = p(A = a)p(B = b) for all a and b.</page><page sequence="32">118 JOURNAL of MUSIC THEORY Figure 12.
