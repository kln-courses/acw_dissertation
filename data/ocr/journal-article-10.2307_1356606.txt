<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Enthroned King Ahasuerus at Dura in Light of the Iconography of Kingship in Iran DALIA LEVIT-TAWIL Columbia University, New York, NY Introduction The excavation of the Dura synagogue, con- ducted in 1932 by Yale University and the Academy of Inscriptions and Letters (Rostovtzeff 1936), marked the beginning of a provocative study that raised the question of what role, if any, Jewish art and iconography played in the forma- tion of the cycles of illumination of the Old Testament in early Christian art (Gutmann 1971). Noteworthy is the theory adduced by Kurt Weitz- mann (1971a, b; 1975), who persuasively argues that the Dura synagogue cycle, compared with illuminations of the Septuagint, is itself proof that Jewish influence on Christian art was indeed extensive. In view of his methodological analysis, the synagogue frescoes can be seen as the epitome of a much broader miniature cycle of lost Jewish illumination. Moreover, the bulk of the icono- graphic material of these illuminations seems to be derived from the midrashim of the post- biblical periods, rather than directly from the Hebrew Bible. Thus the origin of Old Testament miniatures in early Christian art may belong in the domain of a lost Jewish art (Weitzmann 1975: 54). This fundamental idea of the relationship be- tween the Dura synagogue paintings and later Christian book illuminations does not preclude concern with the problem of the visual sources and iconographic influences on these paintings in the objective context of their temporal and cultural background, i.e., the Parthian and Sasanian worlds. A proper investigation of this intricate problem, however, cannot be conducted without scrutinizing the dominant theory of the origins of the so-called pre-Christian, lost Jewish art. On the assumption that such a pictorial Jewish expression could only have been a manifestation of Hellenistic Jewish thought, common critical opinion seeks the origin of the Dura frescoes in the pictorial tradition of the great centers of the Greco-Roman Hellenistic culture, including both the eastern Mediterranean basin and Alexandria (Weitzmann 1975: 54). However, the extent to which Babylonian Jewry in Mesopotamia and Persia could have influenced the formation of Jewish visual expression has never been raised. Despite the conformity of style to the cyclical method of Hellenistic art where, for example, the life of a hero occupies a dominant role (i.e., Moses or Elijah; Weitzmann 1970: 17- 33), these paintings also bear the hint of a different cultural history. The nature of the paintings shows historical events, often under the guise of heroes and kings, in the pattern of the monumental pictorial annals of ancient Near Eastern art. In that same tradition the capitulation 57</page><page sequence="2">58 DALIA LEVIT-TAWIL BASOR 250 of the Israelite King Jehu to Shalmaneser III (859-824 B.C.) was represented generations earlier on the "Black Obelisk" (Pritchard 1954: figs. 351, 355). Thus when defining a model of the syna- gogue's cycle, it is logical to assume that the pictorial iconography could belong to an older dormant tradition of wall reliefs and wall paintings that aimed to record the historical annals of the exiled nation. Its fashion followed the art of the ancient Near East throughout the Parthian and Sasanian periods. Furthermore, this tradition may have influenced a parallel inclination for visual expression in Jewish illuminated texts. It is significant at this point to note that the Jews of the first centuries of the common era were so far removed from any clearcut idolatry that the Talmud does not even mention a struggle with paganism (Lieberman 1962: 120-21. It is our opinion that such an intensive cultural life as that enjoyed by the Babylonian Jews before the start of the common era ought to have created a visual iconographic vocabulary, one that would have emerged independently of the direct influence of Hellenistic culture and without regard for the normative prohibition against a "graven image." Although this must remain a hypothesis due to a lack of excavated material, it does suggest that the Dura synagogue's paintings should be sub- jected to a closer examination for possible influ- ence of the artistic principles and iconographic formulas of ancient Near Eastern art. To establish the degree to which the formal and iconographic units of ancient Near Eastern art coincide in these paintings, it is proposed that each panel be subjected to two levels of examina- tion: first, a formal analysis of each isolated unit/episode in relationship to the panel as a whole, providing the physical connection imposed on the narrative elements by the Jewish concept of its formation (D. Tawil 1979: 93); and second, a stylistic analysis of the iconographic formula demonstrating the relationship to monumental ancient Near Eastern art of the period. Together these components of such an analysis will bring forth the elements embedded in each motif that are the continuation of an older non-Jewish pictorial tradition. This essay on the "enthronement" scene of the Purim panel at Dura follows the suggested course, and thereby offers a diverse approach in the basic tenet of the methodological discussion so far presented on this subject. I The Purim panel is the most important painting in the synagogue (fig. 1), as is apparent from its location immediately to the right of the Torah shrine (D. Tawil 1979: 106). The panel is divided into two scenes. One depicts Mordechai riding on a horse led by a man who represents Haman. A group of witnesses to the decree is standing at his right. The other scene, on the opposite side of the panel, depicts the enthroned King Ahasuerus and Queen Esther (fig. 2; Goodenough 1953-69: vol. 11, pl. 6). Ahasuerus and Esther are identified in the scene by the Aramaic tituli inscribed on the dais of the King's throne and under the footstool of the Queen's seat. Surrounding the royal couple are four figures. Three of these figures seem to form the royal entourage; the fourth, approaching the King from the left, is the carrier of a document. The figures of Mordechai, Haman, and the four other persons in the first scene are all on the same picture plane and are of equal height. In contrast, the participants in the "enthronement" scene, which occupies only a third of the entire painting and is on a different picture plane, are reduced in scale. Such a pictorial arrangement, in which figures differ in scale and are placed on different picture planes, indicates a Near Eastern pictorial formula in which a gradation of size signifies the relative importance of the figure (Porada 1965: 203). Thus the significance of the "enthronement" scene must be secondary from the didactic Jewish point of view of the panel's programming (D. Tawil 1979: 3). Furthermore, it can be argued that the enthrone- ment scene as such, with the enthroned queen and the "messenger" handing over a document to the king, does not relate to the biblical lore nor to any of the megilla translations. In the texts a letter was dispatched from the king, but none was ever brought to him. It is in the light of these two observations that the analysis of the "enthrone- ment" scene of the Purim panel should be conducted. King Ahasuerus, in a frontal pose, sits on a throne with an elaborate dais consisting of five steps, each with a confronted pair of lions and eagles on the end. This throne is similar to that upon which King Solomon sits in another "audi- ence" scene in the synagogue (Goodenough 1953- 69, vol. I1: pl. 10). Unlike Ahasuerus' throne, Solomon's throne has eagles and lions alternating</page><page sequence="3">WW .... . .... e r "~~C"., . ...........az ws,: ............s.. vu ? I~gi Fig. 1.

Solomon's throne is depicted according to midrashic tradition. Associating Ahasuerus' throne with Solomon's also follows a midrashic tradition, in which Solomon's throne was brought by Cyrus from Babylon to Iran.' Ahasuerus, who could not sit on that throne, modeled his own after it but with variations (Midrash Rabba 1:12). The only animals mentioned in the Bible in connection with the Solomonic throne are lions (1 Kgs 10:20). The combination of lions and eagles in the midrash and at Dura, however, corresponds to a conventional formula of the iconography of the royal furniture of the period.2 For example, the feet of the throne-couch in Tang-i Sarvak are shaped as eagles, with two outer eagles looking toward each other (Ghirsh- man 1962: fig. 67). Thrones supported by pairs of lions appear on a group of sculptures from Mesopotamia and Kushan that illustrate enthroned persons in pos- tures identical to that of Ahasuerus (figs. 3-6).3 The actual iconographic combination of eagles and lions appears on the throne of Zeus Ormades in Nimrud Dagh (Humann and Puchstein 1890: pl. 31). Thus the iconography of the throne of Ahasuerus follows the conventional formula of iconography of royal furniture of the period. The pose of the most important figure in this panel, Ahasuerus, is not only identical to those of a group of sculptures of the Parthian period representing enthroned persons, but it is also identical to the pose used in the representations in the synagogue, of Pharaoh (fig. 7; Goodenough 1953-69, vol. 11: pl. 9) and of David (fig. 8; Goodenough 1964: pl. 4). Ahasuerus' clothing is similar in style and color combination to that of</page><page sequence="5">1983 ENTHRONED KING AHASUERUS AT DURA 61 Mordechai (D. Tawil 1979: 101-2), and his head- gear consists of a pointed hat with diadem and ribbons. A comparison of the above group of sculptures with the three kings represented in the synagogues is instructive. All the figures are represented fully frontal, seated on thrones supported by pairs of lions. Their costumes are the Parthian tunic and trousers decorated with running bands of stringed pearls; each has an outer coat (figs. 5, 6). They all wear narrow belts made of plaques, and one also has a sword belt (fig. 4). These belts of plaques differ from the schematic plain belts worn by the three kings in the synagogues. There are other distinctions as well. The trousers of Ahasuerus are very wide, indicating their floppy style, as are the trousers in figs. 3 and 4; all have the single band decoration. On the other hand, the trousers in fig. 5 are much narrower, suggesting the fashion of tied trousers, and these have two bands of decoration. Similar tied trousers are worn by Pharaoh (fig. 7). The tunic of Ahasuerus has, once again, the same plastic effect revealed in the curving lines of fig. 4, and like the latter has a single band of decoration running up the middle. A commdn element in the rendering of the costumes of fig. 5 and Ahasuerus are the hori- zontal folds of the coat-sleeves. As a whole, the sculptures and the kings in the paintings are depicted in the costume used by Parthian kings during scenes of investiture and sacrifice: the long coat and the shorter tunic (D. Tawil 1979: 103). Homes-Fredericq (1960: 325) designated fig. 4 and fig. 5 to different workshops in Iraq operating toward the end of the Parthian Empire, ca. the end of the 2nd century A.D. The appearance of the two styles together in the synagogue supports this theory. Homes-Fredericq, however, believed that the statues from Iraq represented one and the same deity, whereas in our opinion they may represent royal persons. The related Kushan sculpture, identified as the statue of the King Vima Kadphises (fig. 6), further supports this theory (Bachhofer 1929: 52). Thus it is evident that the figure of Ahasuerus, and the other kings in the synagogue follow a prototype common around the end of the 2nd century A.D. and still in existence in the first quarter of the 3rd century A.D. at sites where Parthian art continued to linger under Sasanian rule. More significant, however, are the gestures of Ahasuerus' hands, which differ from those of the . ... ....... . r? .. . .......

Their hands are present, but those of the other two sculptures (figs. 3-4) are missing. Ahasuerus' left hand is drawn close to the chest, as are the left hands of Pharaoh (fig. 7) and David (fig. 8). Similar gestures are applied to the right hands of the Hatrean and the Kushan figures. In contrast, the second hand on each of these sculptures is not outstretched like the right hands of Ahasuerus and the other biblical kings, but rather rest on each figure's knees as if to hold an object. Thus the outstretched hands of Ahasuerus and the other kings in the synagogue seem to follow another prototype. The outstretched hand is characteristic of Arsacid coins portraying the enthroned king and this hand supports either a bird or a small Nike (Newell 1938: pl. 141). All the Arsacid coins repre- sent the king in profile. The Kushan coin of Vima Kadphises, like the sculpture itself, shows the king in a frontal position seated on a curule, a sword at his left side and his right hand outstretched</page><page sequence="6">62 DALIA LEVIT-TAWIL BASOR 250 A w wr j. : "' -' L _V_ .. ... .21. ............... . ..

(Rosenfield 1967: pl. 3; fig. 39). Since the two portrait idioms of this period--numismatic and monumental-are closely related, the iconography of one helps to understand that of the other. Hence the image of Ahasuerus may present the same royal symbolism utilized in the coinage of the monarchy. Moreover, similar outstretched arm gestures appear on the Parthian rock relief from Kuh-i Taraz (vanden Berghe 1968: 19) and on one of the reliefs from Tang-i Sarwak, where the king, reclining on a throne-couch, is accom- panied by his three protector gods (Ghirshman 1962: fig. 67). The outstretched arm of Ahasuerus may be identified as a heraldic symbol related to the investiture portraiture of the Parthian kings. This heraldic gesture may complement another iconographic image of Parthian coinage, which finds its expression in the "court assembly" scene of Dura: the depiction of Esther as a Tyche, protectress of the ruling house, who is shown on coins standing next to the king (Newell 1938: pl. 142F.J.L.O.S.; Herzfeld 1941: 289). The numismatic association and the appearance of Ahasuerus' outstretched arm as an investiture gesture are most significant in relation to the figure advancing toward him from his right. This figure is identified by both Kraeling (1956: 161) and Goodenough (1953-69, vol. 9: 179) as a "messenger" presenting a document to the king. The figure is dressed in a belted red tunic, white trousers, and high soft white boots. The tunic is cut at the sides, and the edge folds over exposing the white lining beneath (cf. Ghirshman 1962: figs. 90, 350). This treatment of an opened slit further accentuates the sweeping movement of the figure, whose left leg is far advanced and sharply bent at the knee. In his right hand the messenger holds a papyrus document. His left hand grasps the hilt of a dagger, in a posture of deference seen on many Parthian and Sasanian monuments. The most outstanding detail of the messenger is his youth, which is suggested by his beardless appearance, in contrast to all the other, bearded, male figures in the Purim panel. Other interesting elements are the royal color combination of red and white of his costume, and the pearl band on his arm, which is a mark of high rank. Such a band also appears on the sleeve of Ahasuerus' coat. Unlike the common Parthian aureole hair- style, the messenger's hair is gathered at the back of the head, in a fashion associated with the profile representation of early Sasanian art (Bivar 1969: pl. 1, figs. 3-4). The relationship between the king and the messenger is rather peculiar. Although they are on different picture planes, there is a feeling of intimate dialogue between them. It is formed first by placing the King on a level higher than the messenger, and second by enlarging Ahasuerus' positional scale. The gradation in height and in scale creates a movement of hands that forms an action directed from one person to another. Most interesting is the fact that in late Parthian art there is no communication between the repre- sented parties. There is also no feeling of intimate dialogue between the giver and the recipient of the emblem. For example, on the relief of Artabanus V (A.D. 215), both the king and the satrap of Susa face the spectator (Ghirshman 1962: fig. 70). However, scenes of intimate gestures of benevo- lence between a king and his protector god do appear sporadically in Parthian art. One such example is a Parthian coin reverse that depicts the enthroned king receiving the homage of a kneeling</page><page sequence="7">1983 ENTHRONED KING AHASUERUS AT DURA 63 " I ~\~L? _x??"": *-~?~jk~?L '' *r ;,a~c~ ~?

Iraq Mu- seum, Baghdad. Tyche figure (fig. 9a; Newell 1938: pl. 142, fig. D; Le Rider 1965: pl. 72, fig. 1). The hand gestures of the king and the kneeling Tyche are very similar to those of the messenger and Ahasuerus. Another unique example is the investiture scene of King Worod on the Parthian rock relief from Tang-i Sarvak. It shows the reclining king embraced by the god seated to his left (Seyrig 1970: 114). An earlier example, from the far borders of the Parthian world, is the scene in which Antiochus I of Commagene (69-31 B.c.) depicts himself in a handclasp (dexiosis) with each of his divine pro- tectors, Zeus, Mithras, and Hercales (Humann and Puchstein 1890: pls. 38-39). Significantly, corresponding to the above is an alternate scene of Antiochus I being invested with the Iranian "ring of office."

There are, indeed, two unique elements in the compositional formula of the messenger. First and most important is the representation of the figure in profile, while all the other figures in the painting are represented in complete frontal view.</page><page sequence="8">64 DALIA LEVIT-TAWIL BASOR 250 ............. ...... . .

Significant is the fact that the only other figure represented in a true profile in the Dura synagogue is the Nike in the resurrection vision of Ezekiel (fig. 10; Goodenough 1964: pl. 21). Remarkably, the Nike too is reduced in scale in relation to the figure of the prophet standing next to her. A figure in a related posture appears on a rhyton from Nisa, which may indicate an earlier proto- type for this imagery (fig. 11; Schlumberger 1970: pl. 8). Scholars identified the iconography of the victorious Nike in Parthian art as based on a Hellenistic prototype and signifying the Iranian manifestation of Khavaranah, the symbol of royal glory (Rostovtzeff 1935: 206; Herzfeld 1941: 289). It is also related to the funerary iconography of the period (Haerinck 1975). The appearance of the Nike in the Ezekiel scene, in a fashion that differentiates it from the representation of the rest "' Fig. 9. (a) Coin of the Parthian King Ordose II (57-38 B.c.).

It is significant that the combination of these two unique elements in the compositional treat- ment of the messenger and the Nike-that is, the smaller scale and the profile stance-appear on another work of late Parthian art.

Schlumberger, L'orient hellenise. L'art grec et ses heritiers dans I'Asie non mediter- raniene, 1970, pl. 8. 1963) represents a group of four figures in frontal posture doing homage to a rider rendered in profile and smaller scale.5 Hence the relief has a twofold relationship with the Purim panel. First, the spatial arrangement between the "rider" and the three standing figures is similar to the com- positional formula of the mounted Mordechai and the four standing witnesses to the decree (D. Tawil 1979: 95, 104). Second, the typological choice of placing the rider in profile and in smaller scale next to a group of large frontal figures corresponds to the painting's depiction of the messenger and the four figures with whom he shares the picture plane. It is apparent that the smaller scale of the figure implies a conventional relationship with the larger figures sharing the same picture plane. This fact further implies that the profile element in both cases, i.e. the relief and the painting, is deliberately chosen to express a specific iconographical idea. On the Hung-i Nauruzi relief the iconography of the rider seems to follow representations of cavalier gods (D. Tawil 1979: 95) on monuments where the mounted god is accompanied by a flying eagle with a wreath (Seyrig and Starky 1949; Rostovtzeff 1935: 175) and stands next to another divinity (Rostovtzeff et al. 1936: pl. 30, figs. 1-3). The deliberate attempt in Hung-i Nauruzi to portray an identifiable personality6 indicates that the rider image must have been a major object of veneration. As such, it supports the theory that the rider represents a divinized ancestor with the protectoral characteristics of the victorious rider.7 Accordingly, the rider imagery in the relief corresponds in its primary icono- graphic symbolism to the victorious Nike in the Ezekiel painting at Dura. The same minute relative scale is found on yet another investiture scene, that from Naqsh-i Rajab, one of the earliest dated Sasanian reliefs.8</page><page sequence="11">1983 ENTHRONED KING AHASUERUS AT DURA 67 Heracles-Verthragna, both "protective" and "vic- torious" god, stands at the feet of the larger figures of Ahura Mazda and Ardashir I (fig. 13; Hinz 1969: figs. 57, 59). A similar gradation of scale between a secondary god and a synnaos theos of a greater god appears on a late Parthian sculpture from shrine V at Hatra. In front of the god and at his feet there is a crouching Tyche-like figure (fig. 14; Ghirshman 1962: fig. 1). Based on these comparisons, the figure who approaches Ahasuerus in profile and who is represented in a scale smaller than the group of the four persons sharing its picture plane must have a unique symbolic meaning. It seems to convey a pictorial formula signifying, like the other examples, a specific iconography pertaining to the benevolent relationship between the ruler and his ancestral apotropaic gods or divinized ancestors, who function as the protectors of his legitimate claim for the kingship.9 The deliberate choice to depict an act not recorded in the biblical story further enhances the supposition that this messenger figure has a specific iconographic connotation, fundamentally related to the reper- toire of the pagan Iranian pantheon and Iranian regalia, as is most definitely the case in the borrowed imagery of the Nike. The role of protector goddesses and gods is attested in Tang-i Sarvak (Seyrig 1970), Simbar (Bivar and Shaked 1964), and possibly also at Bard-e Nechande (Ghirshman 1975). Inasmuch as the iconography of Ahasuerus is similar to that of the Parthian monarch on coins and monuments, the approaching figure with the bent knee in an abrupt gesture should be inte- grated into the scene as another symbol of the investitural insignia. Indeed, on the coins of Artabanus II a male figure kneels before the monarch and hands him the royal diadem (A.D. 10-ca. 38; fig. 9b; Herzfeld 1941, fig. 388; Le Rider 1965: 421-26, pl. 19, figs. 224: 2-7, 225: 1; pl. 72; figs. 2-3; Newell 1938: 488, pl. 143G). The rela- tionship between this coinage iconography and the Purim enthronement scene is suggestive.o0 Finally, the reception of the beardless, younger messenger who approaches Ahasuerus recalls one of the Sasanian N5 R&amp;z customs, in which a handsome young man approaches the king at dawn as the latter awakens. The young man tells the king that his name is "blessed" and that he comes with the New Year on behalf of the god to wish the king prosperity and peace (Dimasqi 1874: 404; Carter 1974: 189, n. 78).

Iranian victory symbols were usually male. A middle Iranian form of Khavaranah named Farrah appears on Kushan coins, set under different representations of a male figure (Rosenfield 1967: 96, 198). The figure has the same attributes as the Kushan kings themselves. It is diademed and nimbate (Boyce 1975: 68). Significantly, in one case he holds a sword, as does the figure approaching Ahasuerus (Rosenfield 1967: 96). In his outstretched hand he holds a purse. As suggested, these different representations have as a common factor the Khavaranah link with royalty and the ruler (Boyce 1975: 68). It may be assumed that this Kushan anthropomorphic por- trayal of Khavaranah holding symbolic objects could have a certain archtype in early Iranian iconography." On the ground of the stylistically unique profile comparison and the relative scale of these two images in the Dura synagogue-the messenger and the Nike-as well as on the basis of Arsacid coinage iconography showing the king as the recipient of a royal emblem from a kneeling female or male figure, it is proposed that the messenger who approached Ahasuerus may be the Iranian male equivalent of the Hellenistic imagery of the Nike.12 Thus it may correspond to the anthropomorphic image of Khavaranah as it exists in the Kushan pantheon. As such, it is a figure with a particular iconographic significance that is related, like the imagery of Ahasuerus' hand gesture, to the repertory of the heraldic insignia of Iran. Therefore this scene could not be identified with the biblical text itself (above). The association of the messenger with the Iranian symbol of Khavaranah further explains the emblem of the written document that this figure is handing to the king. The document, which resembles a demotic papyrus contract, must be a consciously selected symbol indicating that the iconography in the synagogue deviates from the more conventional Parthian motif of the presentation of the royal diadem. It may actually pertain to specific lore, symbolizing the stabili- zation of state affairs (Olmstead 1948: 92), which would fit well into the historical setting conveyed by the Purim story, i.e., the political dangers to Ahasuerus' reign. It is in light of this unique and diversified iconographic element, i.e., the "docu- mentary papyrus" contract, that one must examine the factual association of the Khavaranah motif with the megilla story as it is suggested to have been recorded in the Dura Synagogue. i Ji OP? .. .. ....... f:~:' a.:i'ilii' ?

It is possible that, although the various transformations of Khavaranah in the invisible world forced it in the course of develop- ment of Iranian religion to be a gender rather than a human personification, at an earlier stage it was still personified and deified as the Aramaean gadia (Bailey 1943: 41). It is possible that, although the various transformations of Khavaranah in the we know it to exist in the Kushan pantheon. Likewise, the megilla story is also attributed to the Achaemenid period (Moore 1971: 57-60). Therefore one may assume that this pictorial stress on the messenger iconographic formula could have been based on a long-dormant tradi- tion of other pictorial representations of the Purim episode. To this effect the historical events linking the history of the Jews with the Persian Empire (2 Chr 37: 22-23; Isa 44: 28; 45: 1-3; Ghirshman 1954: 131-33), in particular, and the later sociopolitical correlation and dependency of the Jewish community on the ruling house of Iran, in general (D. Tawil 1979: 107), must be stressed as a" priori. In other words, Khavaranah signifies the Kingly Fortune, by which legitimate rule is maintained among the Iranians. Its divine grace is descended on those favored by the gods, endowing them with exceptional power and pros- perity (Boyce 1975: 42, 68). The great and mighty kings have their fame and splendor through Khavaranah, and if it leaves them their glory departs. It is within this scope of understanding that the Iranian Khavaranah, the protector of the well being of the legitimate dynasties of Iran, would have been preserved in the pictorial Jewish tradition of the megilla. It is of great significance to note that a similar theme of intimate communication between a king and a figure standing before him occurs on the Treasury reliefs from Persepolis (fig. 15; Ghirsh- man 1964: fig. 255). These reliefs represent Darius I (522-486 B.c.) enthroned with the crown prince standing behind him. The king is seated before two fire altars, separating him from a person who, unlike the rest of the figures in the scene, is represented in an abrupt movement. As he faces Darius in a forward gesture, this figure's hand touches his lips so as not to defile the monarch by his breath while delivering his message (Walser 1965: 12). Once again, this figure is smaller than the elevated throne and the larger seated figure of the king. This relationship is further accentuated by the use of a diagonal line formed by the ruler's staff, in contrast to the smaller staff running parallel and reaching only to the elbow of the messenger's projected hand. This arrangement conveys, in a different fashion, the same idea presented by the relationship between the King and the messenger in the Purim panel. Moreover, recent archaeological discoveries at Persepolis have furnished incontrovertible evi- dence that the reliefs had been brought to the Treasury from the Apadana, where they had been an integral part of the stairway facade (Tilia 1972: 175-208). The scene is interpreted as intimately related to the ceremonial rite of the New Year festival as celebrated in Persepolis (Ghirshman 1957: 265-78; Farkas 1974: 55). This association with the celebration at Persepolis enhances the formal typological correlation between it and the pictorial tradition of the megilla, which likewise is attributed to an episode that may have evolved during the course of the Persian New Year cele- bration (Gaster 1950: 18). The audience scene at Persepolis captures atten- tion by the expressive and individualized attitude and gesture of the messenger. This greater expres- siveness of gesticulation cannot be attributed to the artistic vocabulary of ancient Near Eastern art. Rather, it must be ascribed to a strong influ- ence from the world of "Greek drama," which influenced 5th century B.c. Greek painting (Weitz- mann 1970: 14-16) and which must have reached Persepolis via the many Greek artists, including painters, who were employed there. Significantly, this newly dramatic style, which illustrates precise moments within the unity of time, is utilized exactly in the Purim panel at Dura. This concentration upon such a dramatic mo- ment, iconographically so much of a unit in itself, suggests that the monoscenicl4 Treasury reliefs are charged with a specific symbolic idea focusing on the enthroned King and his heir perse, viewing the other participants as complementary'5 elements only. The Treasury reliefs must be regarded as monuments of a symbolic political intent, similar to Darius' tomb relief,'" rather than as a mere illusionistic display of ceremonial processions at Persepolis. Indeed, that Darius sought the help of</page><page sequence="16">72 DALIA LEVIT-TAWIL BASOR 250 symbolic iconography to consolidate his rule is also attested in these reliefs and seals, which display him in conquests of supernatural monsters (Porada 1961: 68). It is difficult to determine the precise icono- graphic identity of the messenger in Persepolis, although many interesting theories have been presented." It is noteworthy, however, that the conceptual idea of the messenger motif as the nucleus of the scene must be a Persian one. Cyrus the Great had instituted the principle of organi- zation of the state, based on control exercised by, among others, the messenger whose epithet may have been "the king's eye" or "the king's ear"'" (Olmstead 1948: 59). Every year the messenger made a careful inspection of the provinces and reported personally to the great king. This revolu- tionary political concept of governing the empire may have been the inspiration for the Greek artist who designed the scene. Whatever the final interpretation of the relief, it can be deduced that the iconographic formula depicting the messenger in relationship to the enthroned king in the imperial iconography of Iran as seen in Dura may have stemmed from this Achaemenid pictorial tradition. The conceptual idea of the documentary papy- rus symbol may also go back to the 5th century B.C., since it was during the life of Darius that the reform of a new law, the "Ordinance of Good Revelation," was enforced upon the entire empire (Olmstead 1948: 120, 130, n. 39). The sanctity of contracts played a major role in this reform (Frye 1963: 131). The demotic papyrus contract was introduced at that period, to be differentiated from the more elaborate hieratic priestly docu- ment (Olmstead 1948: 92). As stated by Farkas (1974: 3), the Persian Empire was in many ways Darius' personal creation, and the effective con- solidation of the central government his major achievement. His second most significant contri- bution was the position of the law in his govern- mental system, concern for which is evident in several passages in his inscriptions (Frye 1963: 130). Based on the hypothesis that the nucleus of the messenger imagery in the Treasury reliefs alludes to the "central power" of the ruler, it is further suggested that a complementary image may well be the representation of the enthroned king as lawgiver and chief judge of the state, which he actually was. Such an interpretation fits the symbol of the "scepter of justice" held by the king'9 (H. Tawil 1974: 46) and may also explain the enigmatic feature of his crown, which lacks the characteristic crenelations of the crown of Darius.20 It may be a special turban-like hat for the lawgiver and chief judge. The dominant iconography, which represents the king as chief judge for crimes against the state and the messen- ger as the embodiment of his control over the central organization of the state, is complemented by the depiction of the representative of the different satrapies. The satrapal system is indeed the ultimate result of a well functioning central government. The subject of the Treasury relief corresponds in its thematic idea to the Purim's enthroned scene where the victorious and protec- tor messenger offers the king the documentary papyrus as a symbol of law and order and governmental supremacy. This iconographic interpretation offers further validity to Porada's ultimate argument (1979: 41) that the Treasury reliefs at Persepolis represent none other than King Darius I and were carved probably ca. 490 B.C. Darius, who is known to have supervised the construction of Persepolis, must also have been the one who initiated the special program of the Treasury reliefs. Thus by depicting himself as the controller of the Empire, as well as the originator and propagator of the new law reform, he declared his legitimate right to the throne. Such an iconographic representation on the central stairway of the Apadana has an important implication, since of all the Achaemenid kings it was Darius I who, although of royal blood, was a usurper to the throne21 (Olmstead 1948: 108-10). Thus the typological and thematic relationship between the Achaemenid Treasury reliefs and the Parthian enthroned scene from the Purim story alludes to the fact that the Treasury reliefs may symbolize legitimacy, which in Iran becomes paramount and bound up with Khavaranah-the symbol of legitimate supreme authority (Frye 1963: 121), later reflected in "the king's glory." In light of this interpretation, it is suggested that the Treasury reliefs, which actually declare the divine beneficial radiance, the Khavaranah of the Achaemenid, must have been regarded as sacred ritualistic monuments. As such, shortly before or immediately after Darius' death, they were trans- ferred to the courtyard of the Treasury22 to be kept for posterity as talismanic and votive artifacts.</page><page sequence="17">1983 ENTHRONED KING AHASUERUS AT DURA 73 Conclusion The attempt has been made to explain the enthroned iconography of kingship in Iran, as revealed in Persepolis, and its derivative Parthian paintings from Dura. The impact of its meaning in the symbolic usage of the synagogue still needs to be traced. The intrinsic use of the documentary papyrus motif, in the specific context of royal Parthian imagery of the "enthroned" king as a symbol of legitimate power, suggests that thematically it must pertain to Parthian tradition. The evidence presented here supports this assumption. Histori- cally, the compilation of the canonical Anti- demotic Law took place during the reign of Mithradates I (ca. 171-138/7 B.c.), the great Par- thian king who began his exposition of the civil law with contracts (Olmstead 1948: 132). Taking into consideration that the Parthian empire struc- tured its political orientation on the economic power of the caravan system, the iconography of the divine protector messenger or the carrier of the papyrus contract, as a symbol of the "proper government," befits the iconographical expression of the period. Its occurrence in the caravanseri synagogue, as the apparent choice of the Jewish merchant class of Dura, further underlines the possibility of the propagation of such an icono- graphical orientation. Moreover, recognizing the Achaemenid elements embedded in the Purim painting, one ought to consider the question of the painting's date in relationship to the problem of early Sasanian art. The dedication of the synagogue in A.D. 245 coincides with the period in which Sasanian art, under the rule of Shapur I (A.D. 240-272), asserted itself. Artistic expression, aimed at a greater stress on links with Achaemenid tradition, is one of the principle characteristics of the art of that period (Porada 1965: 192). Following the criteria we have established, the choice of the Achaemenid iconography of legitimacy and kingship, as it continued to linger in the Jewish lore of the megilla, was bound to gain in its popularity during the kingship of the first Sasanian kings. p??~f T's~ 77-:i . . .. . ... ..... ..... ma s"Os . ....... i- ~ ilk .. . ... ....... . ... .......-~ii B ~ ~ - ?''F6-~ MR. .. ....... ...'~ ljz; ~'' ~ ~ 15.

Indeed, the theme seems to reassert itself, although in a different format, in the Sasanian N6 R&amp;z custom of the young man named "blessed," as mentioned above. In conclusion, it is proposed that the "en- throned" scene of Ahasuerus symbolizes the legiti- mate divine right of kingship of the Iranian monarch, as it was propagated through his role as the promoter of law and justice. The use of this iconography in the synagogue is deliberate and therefore indicative of the grave political atmos- phere in which the Jewish community of Dura lived. The Jews of Dura, like the Jews of Babylon, probably identified Shapur I, the ruler of the East, as the protector of the Jews against Rome (D. Tawil 1979: 107). Hence their allegiance to the royal house of Iran must have had serious implications in that caravan city on the fringes of the Iranian empire, controlled by a Roman gar- rison, and which 14 years later (in A.D. 256) was to be destroyed by Shapur I himself. Finally, the typological and iconographical motif of Khavaranah/the messenger/the youth named "blessed" and the king, the promoter of the law, may be the archetype for those scenes in late antiquity and early medieval art that depict the theme of the Traditio Legis, i.e., Christ giving the scroll of the law to St. Peter (figs. 16, 17), and the derivative scene of the three Magi-kings of the East approaching Christ (Volbach 1962: figs. 153, 174-78). This pictorial borrowing may be either direct or indirect. A direct source could at all times be transferred to the Greco-Roman world from the Parthian empire.2 Yet if one supposes an indirect Judeo-ecumenical influence on early Christian art, then the biblical pictorial tradition of the megilla may have transmitted this specific Iranian iconog- raphy of cosmic law and of kingship to the west. While this hypothesis cannot be proven, it pro- vides an interesting, if cumbersome, picture of one way in which early Christian art might have obtained some of its iconographic formulae and pictorial sources. In all events, the "enthroned" scene of the Purim panel in Dura demonstrates the vast artistic vocabulary that Jewish iconog- raphy, and hence Jewish iconology, of the post- biblical periods was bound to absorb during the many centuries of intimate contact with the cul- tural heritage of Mesopotamia and Iran.24 Most of all, the usage of the Iranian iconog- raphy in the context of the megilla reflects an idea that cannot be attributed to ancient Iran alone. The conceptual idea of the relationship between kingship, ethics, and morality actually predated Darius' law in the ancient code of Hammurabi, as well as in the codes of earlier Sumerian kings (Saggs 1966: 196-210). It is therefore not sur- prising to assume that Darius derived the central composition of the two main figures vis-a-vis each other in the Treasury reliefs from the pictorial tradition of the compositional formula of the stele of Hammurabi." At least three such stelae were in existence, as fragments excavated in Susa show (Oppenheim 1964: 287), brought there as spoil by victorious Elamite kings. A pictorial tradition</page><page sequence="19">1983 ENTHRONED KING AHASUERUS AT DURA 75 must have existed following the scheme of the most famous stele, which was discovered in the Temple of the Elamite god Inshushinak and which was brought to Elam by the King Shutruk- Nakhuntea (1170 B.c.; Porada 1965: 45). The stele represents the enthroned sun god-the god of justice, in front of whom stands the king, the law- giver26 (fig. 18; Frankfort 1958: 59). It may be concluded that the Dura motifs of the enthroned Persian king and the messenger who carries the documentary papyrus as a symbol of edicts, moratoria, and law codes, underscores one of the ancient Near East's supreme contributions to the ethos and culture of civilized life. -grl= ;Ywr o-):gi ~ ~,,,~P~i~ wo .a pup'!i~ W ". . .. .. .. ggv~?I? r?I 4. him R k?~4 wB~~ ~ BiJ Ng-~ MR;;;'if'"" -i ??. ? ? ?;..?: ?MIN e "N V, iDw ~::~ii:~ix~~: ~~: ~ I.-Mv~ Ifi::i-':~?~N. gpI ~,::i? ? ~?i:T- ??.. .,.fz ONki, L '?:'?'

For grouping of figures in a single composition in classical art, as opposed to isolated figures in ancient Near Eastern art, see Seyrig 1950: 4. 'Study of the relief by T. Kawami gives no indication that it was not carved at the same period. Any assumption that we have of reliefs carved at different times is therefore not substantiated. 6Vanden Berghe identifies the portrait of the cavalier as Mithradates 1 (171-138 B.c.; 1963: 165-67). Colledge (1977: 92) suggests that it is one of the local Elamite rulers, titled Kamnaskires (50 B.C.-A.D. 50). On the basis of our suggestion that the relief represents a divinized ancestor and is related in style and chronology to the Purim panel, i.e., the last phase of the Parthian period, the image of the ruler may well be Mith- radates I, as the powerful "philhellene" ancestor of the Arsacid race. It may follow numismatic iconography, showing Mithradates I in the guise of Heracles, which in turn may support the theory that already in his lifetime he claimed divinity (Downey 1969: 4; Gardner 1968: 6, 3, pl. 2). 7Cf. the cavaliers in the Parthian relief at Tanq-i Sarvak and in the late Sasanian relief at Tang-i Bustam, possibly tutelary gods representing ancestors (Kellens 1973). 8The pictorial device using gradation in scale of various divine figures may have been the result of the religious conflict regarding Ahura Mazda's supremacy in relationship to the other Yazatas in the early Sasanian period. The supremacy of Ahura Mazda may have been declared by using a smaller scale for the other gods (for the problem see: Boyce 1969: 10-31). 9For the concern of legitimacy of kingship in Parthia, see Azarpy 1972: 11. 'OFor the problem of the identification of the coins of Artabanus II, see Le Rider (1965: 422, n. 6). Compare also Newell (1938: 488-90), also Petrowitz (1968: pl. 18, fig. 1). One wonders whether the iconography of the coins may be related to the political situation at Susa at the time of his reign (compare Le Rider 1965: 421, n. 3). "Cf. the borrowed iconography of Verthragna (Downey 1969: 113-17). 121n this regard most suggestive is the image of a young man behind a reclining man on the wall, in back of the sarcophagus of Maqqai. The figure stretches his right hand, which holds a wreath near the head of the man on the couch. Inghold (1935: 72) suggests that, since in Palmyra the crowning of a man is always done either by the goddess of victory or the eagle, the figure is certainly a male victory (1935: 74). "3The male/female element embodied in the pictorial depic- tion of Khavaranah is perhaps related to the ilanu, lamassu, and simtu in Mesopotamia (cf. Oppenheim 1964: 198-206). '4This is a term denoting a single scene within a unit of time, in which the stress is on the iconographic connotation rather than the formal one (Weitzmann 1970: 15). '5This term is used to distinguish figures that are additional to those required by the text (Weitzmann 1970: 15). '6The depiction on the tomb relief was probably meant to enumerate the countries under Darius' sway (Farkas 1974: 1). "'The person received in audience has been identified as a Mede on the basis of his costume. As to his function, there are various theories, i.e., the highest official announcing the delegation (Walser 1965: 13; Porada 1979: 39). '8For the theory that "the king's eye" may be the Aramaic term gwshky (listener), hence an official who represents the central government in legal cases, perhaps a kind of state's attorney, see Frye 1963: 126. '9For reference concerning the New Year's ritual, in which the god Nabui presented Cambyses with the scepter of justice, see Olmstead 1948: 86. 20For the complicated problem of the crown, see Porada 1979: 41. 21It is significant to note that in the Bisitun inscription Darius' branch of the family was made to appear directly descended from Achaemenes, the eponymous ancestor of the clan, while Cyrus was scarcely mentioned and his lineage overlooked (Farkas 1974: 3). 22Such dating supports Farkas' proposed chronology (1974: 118) in which the replacing reliefs of the Apadana were carved at the very end of Darius' reign with all probability as directed by Darius himself prior to his death. 23Perhaps even already during Achaemenid period (ca. 4th century B.C.); cf. the "Darius Vase" (Olmstead 1948: pl. 62). 240n the whole, it may be noted that the usage of the documentary papyrus symbol in Jewish lore reflects concern with the social and economic condition of the people that was expressed in the Rabbinic literature of the period, i.e., the Talmudic Law. 25Scholars studying the numerous texts left by Darius at various sites have recognized a number of parallels between his writings and the ancient code of Hammurabi (Olmstead 1948: 120-28). 26Posing in the posture of the Babylonian god appears to reflect the same trend toward assuming divinity seen in other reliefs at Persepolis, where Darius is the conqueror of supernatural beasts (Porada 1965: 159). It suggests that Darius regarded himself as the divine custodian of justice of his kingdom, parallel to the god Shamash (Marcus 1978: 55).</page><page sequence="21">1983 ENTHRONED KING AHASUERUS AT DURA 77 BIBLIOGRAPHY Azarpy, G. 1972 Crowns and Some Royal Insignia in Early Iran.
