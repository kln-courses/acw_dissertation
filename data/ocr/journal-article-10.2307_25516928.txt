JEWISH MEDICINERS.1 Early Hebrew medicine was no growth; whatever may have been bor rowed from the Egyptians before the Exodus, the embodiment of the law in the Mosaic books represents a fundamental conception which must never be lost sight of, which ruled conduct with absolute control down to the period at which I close my remarks?the belief that whatever happens comes direct from the hand of the Lord. The Jews were the chosen people, under the direct supervision of the Lord; the regulations presented to them in the Law of Moses had for their object the preservation of the people in the most perfect physical condition and the purest moral state possible, and the maintenance of the closest relations with their God. Hence the exclusiveness, which was not a national character, but had its seat in religious conviction and obligations. If the Sadducees had a belief in the utility of worldly means for dealing with worldly emergencies, they were an offence to the Pharisees, whose trust in the Lord was implicit. Time modified slightly the rigidity of this exclusiveness, but did not remove the conviction that diseases were sent by God as chastisements. I do not speak of ordinary ailments, such as those of the priests due to the pre scribed clothing to be worn in the service of the Temple?for these ailments physicians were appointed at an early date; I refer to such affections as leprosy and pestilence, which we find in the Bible as direct evidences of Divine displeasure. There were in fact among the early Hebrews two sub jects of Medicine?(a) diseases sent by God, to be dealt with by the Levites as intercessors for the people; (b) injuries for which medical aid might be sought. In a periodical of last century, Der Jude, there is a full account of and 1 The Hunterian Library contains MS. copies of works by Isaac ben Salomon, Actuarius, Platearius, Trotula, Constantinus Africanus, Mesue, and portions of treatises by other mediaeval writers on Medicine. In making the Catalogue of the Library I had to attempt the identification of these works. The result of this work was summed up in an address to the Jewish Literary Society of Glasgow, and of this address the above is the substance. VOL. XIII.?NO. LU. K</page><page sequence="2">146 The Scottish Antiquary; rules for the visitation of the sick. It is laid down that the sick man must have a physician lest he be counted a suicide. It is also laid down that the doctor must be conscious of and convinced of his own skill, and sat isfied that no better physician, no more experienced person, is available, else he will be held as a murderer. But even then (1770) it is candidly declared that in grave internal disorders the sick man should have no physician, but trust in God. How far this is founded on the censure of Asa is not declared, but it is a curious commentary on this faith that already in Sirach it is said, ' Him that breaketh the Law, let him fall into the hands of a physician,' for him there was no help from God. There was not then, be it remembered, the same ground for sarcasm that has made in more recent times the doctor a subject of not always good-natured jest: Isaac the Jew has left record, in the 10th century, of the singleness of mind in the profession; and it is told of another who wished his son to study, being moved to this advice by the honours accorded to a successful student, that his evil thought was punished and his son came not to honour. It has been objected that the precautions ordained by Moses in the case of leprosy have no counterpart in the case of pestilence. I do not see any force in the criticism : the pestilence is a disease still occurring in the East, and the history of that, or rather those epidemics at Aleppo 1760, '61, '62, shows that precautions were not of any avail, that the beginning and progress were under no apparent rule. Moreover, as the stroke of the Lord, the pestilence was not one of the diseases of the people. ' It is better to fall into the hands of the Lord than into the hands of man.' After the Dispersion the Jews enjoyed a singular immunity from pestilences which visited Europe?sometimes a fatal immunity for some persons; for in 1161 no fewer than 86 Jewish physicians were burnt in Prague in ac knowledgment of their inability to cope with an epidemic which ran its brief course of destruction but spared their race. The malicious puerilities of alleged poisonings of wells are mere excuses for acts which were as rational as if we were now to burn negroes in South America because they do not suffer from the yellow fever, which is fatal to white races. As the Mosaic Law was not a scientific treatise, as its instructions were for the guidance of the priests, the only intermediaries between man and God, we need not complain of omissions which would have been irrele vancies had they been inserted. The general health regulations were of remarkable completeness, extending as they do to details of moral as well as of physical conduct. Even bodily imperfection was considered ; the service of the Temple was forbidden to anyone who was imperfect or mu tilated, and Hyrcanus was deprived of his high office after the intentional cropping of his ears by Antipater, who well knew the degradation that must follow the savage act, It is easy to recall the instances when the priest intervened, when Moses interceded for Miriam, or that sub lime picture, when Aaron with his censer stood between the living and the dead, and the plague was stayed. Such being the key-note of Hebrew Medicine, the growth of the profession is of extreme interest, both in respect of any actual gains to knowledge and of the opinions which overlaid the practice. At first their God was the sender of disease, and the healer when the punishment sufficed. But the Captivity brought the people into contact with other modes of thought, and thus came the added notion, held only</page><page sequence="3">or, Northern Notes and Queries. 147 for a short time, that evil spirits too had a share in the infliction of suffering. It is difficult to unravel the history of Mysticism. It seems fair to credit Zoroasterism with some share in that foreign growth, while Greece contri buted Pythagorean doctrines. Certain it is that a sect of mysterious history, the Essenes, appeared in the troublous times when some Chasidim (the pious), later known as Pharisees, respected the oral as well as Ezra's written law, while others, the Sadducees, deemed the written law sufficient. The Essenes, among whom John the Baptist is counted, carried the regard for purity to extreme lengths, and to guard themselves against defilement practised a habit of life to which monasticism is the nearest equivalent. Philo is the first great name among Alexandrine Jews who formed a flourishing colony, and whose descendants justly complained that Christians revenged the death of Jesus on those whose ancestors had quitted Palestine long before that event, and who were therefore in no way responsible for it. The Egyptian monarchs had favoured the colony, and to them, especially to Ptolemy Philopator, is due the devotion of the Alexandrine Jews to the translation of their books into Greek, a task round which a miraculous legend was woven in aftertimes. Philo was well versed in Greek philo sophy, which it was his object to reconcile with the Hebrew religion. This he sought to accomplish by mystic interpretations and symbolical readings of the old books, the result of which was that the ancient faith lost its simplicity, and therewith its hold on men's minds. Those who clung to the Law were branded by the Gentiles as atheists because they refused to accept the gods of the western world, and hated as exclusive because the old proud boast of the ' peculiar people " was no longer understood, because they who cherished it did not see how concession might have helped them. * The old agriculturists and flock-keepers had come into times when they were not allowed to hold lands, and when handicrafts were forbidden them, when political reasons gave some semblance of an excuse for selfish restric tions now pursued in other directions from personal motives. Commerce, to which they were not naturally prone, was the only resource left to the mass of the people, philosophy to the more cultivated. There was a general impairment of the taste of the race consequent on the Dispersion, and this decadence extended to the language of the common people. An external stimulus was needed to rekindle the fire of Hebrew poetry: this was afforded by their contact with the Arabs. Even the Koran owes more to the sacred books than distorted reminiscences. The warrior spirit of this branch of the Semitic stock was in full energy; its ambition was called into full play by Mohammed. Something more was needed. A general of the Caliph Omar is credited with the destruction of the library of Alexandria : it is a doubtful charge, even if it were not a positive benefit that so much of moth-eaten tradition had been swept out of the way of civilisation. Let the general have blame or praise, the Caliph himself certainly was a friend to knowledge. Less than a century after the opening of the Mohammedan era, a great activity of thought was at work under the Ommiade dynasty. The first Caliph gave the Jews privileges which were enjoyed under his successors, and Damascus and Bagdad were-seats of learning wherein were studied all that could be gathered from Greek, from Jewish, from Chaldean sources. Medicine had a prominent place among the studies, and the Alexandrine influence was infused through Abdel Malik ben Abh?r</page><page sequence="4">148 The Scottish Antiquary ; Alkinani, a Christian, afterwards a Mussulman. The activity was pro digious : Greek MSS. were imported and translated, Nestorian Christians being the chief physicians and those who enriched Arabian literature with the treasures of other tongues. It is from this time not easy to disentangle Arab and Jewish contribu tions to medicine: still more difficult to find Jewish physicians who were contented to limit their contributions within the bounds of their own pro fession. The physicians were then indeed learned, skilled in all depart ments of human knowledge, philosophy, linguistics, and theology, the Jewish devotion to wide culture being especially noted and noteworthy. This combination of doctrinal lore and medical knowledge had its drawbacks; skill in the unravelling of textual difficulties, mastery of con troversial dialectic, gave to medical treatises a peculiar character. There was subtilty in discussions regarding imponderable agencies; heat and cold, dryness and moisture were assumed as the chief properties of man as an organism, and symptoms were considered in reference to these rather than to diseases. One toils through pages which have a tincture of the moral law in the hope of finding facts regarding definite diseases, sometimes only to find that the whole depends on the evil adjustment of warmth and moisture conferred on the patient prior to his birth. The case is even worse in early Christian medicine, for to the controversial skill of the churchman was added that of the astrologer, and conjunction of planets shared with Aristotelian logic in establishing the diagnosis and guiding the treatment of what we now study in and for itself. Vast as was early know ledge, just as were early opinions regarding plants and their medicinal properties, even these were overlaid, sometimes misdirected, by fanciful preconceptions as to their relations to the four properties already men tioned. There was more skill on paper than in actual observation of ailments : that is the first impression. But in reading the works of Isaac one sees that, after all, there was a sound body of accurate observations underlying all this; and one hopes that the practice was more in conson ance with common sense than the descriptive language, and was as useful as that of modern medicine. The surgery, if rough, even coarse, was in the main sound: in ophthalmic surgery the practice was better than the small amount of anatomy then known leads us to expect. In Spain, under the Ommiade dynasty, the Arab found a more stimu lating climate and underwent invigorating contact with western races, giving and receiving influences which served to modify the knightly standard and to raise that of culture in Europe. Their mild treatment of the Jews whom they found resident in Spain (where they had formed an important part of the population for several centuries) had a complex origin. Descended from a kindred stock, and animated with an equally strong antagonism to Christianity, the Jews saw in the Arabs deliverers from the cruel yoke of the Visigoths. Under the new rule the academy at Cordova came into existence, and schools were fostered under the control of teachers of recog nised ability. Under Abdar Rahman, a Jew, Chasdai ben Schaprout, a native of Spain who had studied medicine at Cordova, became finance minister, and enjoyed the Caliph's confidence to such an extent that he was employed on important diplomatic missions. To him is due, in conjunc tion with a Greek priest Nicolaus, a large amount of Arabic translations from Greek authors. The Spanish schools became a centre of attraction for all lands; the libraries were numerous and well stocked, the scribes</page><page sequence="5">or, Northern Notes and Queries. 149 many and busy. From the Peninsula spread through Europe a copious stream of literature, introducing knowledge not previously accessible, not previously known to exist. It must be owned that, judging it from the modern standpoint, much of this literature was of little worth : it was empirical knowledge, the pro duct of observation?for the most part uninstructed observation; it was guided by no inductive reason, lacked the basis even of correct anatomy; nevertheless, gleams of the direct common sense of the true physician occur. From this time on our knowledge is almost nil of the actual practice of the profession: systematical theoretical works abound. The remedies, balsams, electuaries, oils, are chiefly European, little of Eastern origin sur vived. The history of Medicine is thus chiefly of literary medicine. The ordinary practitioner, Jew or Christian, does not bulk largely?has left little record, save occasional references to men who, otherwise unknown, had tried certain remedies and found them useful. The writers, literary physi cians, were in touch with the practitioners, but of the ordinary life of these latter we know nothing. Even the Thesaurus Pauperum?the poor man's treasure?even this popular treatise is an unsafe guide for the uninstructed. The most popular ascription of this work is to Honein, though it is pro bable that the uncertainty on this point is due to the preparation of more than one such treatise at different times, by various authors. Isaac the Jew, in the tenth century, wrote a Guide to Physicians, which will bear perusal now. Hear some of his precepts: ' Let your first visit fall at the exacerbation of his illness,' 'Think well about simple remedies of which you have had no experience.' ' Most patients recover by the help of nature without the physician's aid.' (This is a modification of the Hippocratic maxim, 'To help or not to hurt.') 'If you have a choice between nutritive means and drugs, use the former.' 'Use only one remedy at a time.' ' Think of your fee while the patient is ill: when he is better he forgets.' ' Make your fee as high as possible : you get no thanks for gratuitous work.' There is great shrewdness throughout, and the worldly advice bluntly set down in the foregoing extracts is, after all, the common faith and practice of Christian, Arab, and Jew; not all are so honest in their admissions. Isaac ben Soleiman had a high standard, and his influence must have been for good. It seems strange that Chasdai, notwithstanding his eminence and experience in affairs, in spite of the place which he saw his co-religionists take, should have shared the common belief that a people and a religion without a country had neither firmness nor vitality. Every name one finds on the roll of distinction, every Jew who won position as a physician, was a scholar, and that meant theologian for the most part. The race strove towards the light at a time when Chris tians were content to tread the narrow circle to which the intellectual dark ness of scholasticism condemned and familiarised them. Johali Marinus, 995_io5?j was a scholar; so was Shishet Benvenuto, in Aragon. The Tibbon family held high rank among the Jews of the south of France. Judah ben Saul was a distinguished physician, and with his son, also a physician, translated important works. But the country which records them witnessed the rise of the greatest Jew prior to Spinosa. Moses, the son of Maimun, was born in Cordova in 1135, and educated by his father, who, during the tyranny of Abd-el-moumen, accepted in turn both of the alternatives presented by the Caliph, first professing Islamism, afterwards</page><page sequence="6">150 The Scottish Antiquary ; leaving Spain for Africa. At last in Egypt the refugees got peace. Maimonides and his brother earned a livelihood by dealing in precious stones, until the death of the elder brother at once broke up the partner ship and the business. But meanwhile Maimonides had won a patron powerful and wise in Al Fadhel, Kadi under Saladin. Recognising the utility of the Jew, he made him one of the attendants at court, and assured him of the means of devoting himself to science. But this security did not assure him of ease : others besides the Kadi knew when they had a wise friend. Samuel ibn Tibbon, who afterwards translated his writings, wished to place himself under Maimonides' instruction. The sage wrote, dis couraging him on the ground that he could not promise him the attention which would make his sojourn in Egypt worth his while. The picture of his daily life, if it is exaggerated, as became one who did not desire a friend to undertake a serious step without knowledge of the risks, still tells of much labour as well as untiring assiduity in discharging duties. The day was spent between the daily visit to Cairo, and interviews with patients at his own home, besides consultations on points of the law, of which his enormous knowledge made him in some measure an arbiter. Little time for study, yet the works of this busy man rank only after?if indeed they are after, save in time?those of Ibn Gebirol. It is a familiar epigram that from Moses to Moses there was no one like Moses; but Spinosa did not come between them: fact is a little sacrificed to phrase, for neither Ibn Gebirol nor Spinosa deserve to be omitted from any comparison between Jewish thinkers. Avicebron, or Avicembron, a more familiar name than Solomon Ibn Gebirol, was not a physician; but it is necessary to consider his work if we wish to understand the place of Maimonides in the history of philosophy and religion. The materials are to be found in the Mklanges philosophiques of Munk, who, besides being the discoverer of Gebirol under the supposed Arab designation of Avicebron, has given sketches of several Arab and Jewish philosophers. May I remark that the respective merits of Arab and Jew, as contributors to the progress of thought, have their partisans ? Perhaps it is more correct to say that partisanship is more copiously and emphatically asserted on behalf of the Arabs, as if anti Semitic feeling were more tolerant of those who follow the Koran than of those who take as their guide the books of Moses. It is said that the Arabs were specially gifted in philosophy, for which the Jews were slightly endowed. There are certain names which stand out in the history of the Jews?Philo, Ibn Gebirol, Maimonides, Spinosa, Mendelssohn : you may call them the crests of the wave, but there was continuity of thought between their epochs, Jewish philosophical tradition was uninterrupted. Alexandria was the home of Neo-Platonism: Karaism, a development of the eighth century, had more than religious significance?it was a motive for a closer study of philosophy, it determined a more exact knowledge of the Hebrew language. No nation has an exclusive claim to any science: the wave of knowledge passes over the earth not always in the same direc tion ; its crest falls now here, now there. The real truth is that in the third chapter of Genesis we find the explanation of the absence of philosophic studies among the race. The Hebrew had not his notions of the existence of God, of morality, of knowledge of good and evil, as the fruit of syllogism; they were not won by wrestling with thought, but inherited as part, integral part, of the divine relation at Sinai. It was his religion that he did not philosophise, not his reluctance, still less his incapacity.</page><page sequence="7">or, Northern Notes and Queries. 151 By circumstances, as of the Captivity and residence in Egypt and else where after the Dispersion, the Jews were led to add to their knowledge opinions formed by other nations, in schools remote from their own in motive and purpose. Perhaps their most kindly adoption was from the Persian school, which equally with the Jewish was hostile to idols. Certain it is that there are traces of this influence in some of the later Hebrew poetry. But contact with the civilisation of Greece and Rome could not fail of effect. The philosophy of Aristotle and Plato had much to do with future progress. I cannot enter into even a brief r'esume of the stages of thought prior to the eleventh century; suffice it that the Peripatetic philo sophy dominated in the long run, notwithstanding the strenuous efforts even of some Jews in south France?reactionaries who not merely opposed one school of thought, but wished to suppress all, and sought to forbid study of profane matters until a certain age, 25?nay, even 30 was pro posed. The attack on philosophy was not to arrest knowledge, but to confine the search for it within the limits of the Bible and the Talmud. It was led by Jehuda Halevi, who early in the twelfth century wrote the book Kozari as an embodiment of his antagonism. This was not the effort of a fanatic from ignorance. Halevi was a physician?a man of social position, high culture, and a poetic gift which has left valued poems. Nor was he narrow from isolation; he had travelled even to Palestine. We must look carefully for the explanation of the paradox that the enemies of progress were those who ought to have been its most assiduous helpers. In all times of great excitement we become aware of the two antagonistic forces which never require to declare them selves under ordinary conditions. Progress and reaction merely represent the extremes of opinions which scarcely made themselves felt so long as the current ran slow. Time would have brought the desired changes with out doing violence to any latent prejudice. But there are men who cannot wait; there are circumstances which render delay well nigh impossible. If the roots of religion are or seem to be in danger, the fanaticism of the learned is even more dangerous, even perhaps less controlled, than that of the mob ; it certainly has more skilful weapons at command. The struggle was not quite new. Saadi'a had in the ninth century deemed it worth while to show that in philosophy was a firm basis for religion?that reason and faith were not at variance. The history of the book Zohar is curious ; it was a fraud in harmony with the spirit of the times. No one thought his words of such weight as to command respect, or at any rate it was thought they might fare better if imputed to some one else. In the case of the Jews this led to a confusing uncertainty as to the nationality of an author ; one has often to ask, is the name a nom de plume? Moses da Leon went further; he perpetrated the fraud in the hope that the supposed author would better command the sympathy he could only hope to slowly win in his own name. The book was supposed to have been written in the second century by Simon ben Yochai, and to have lain hid till Moses da Leon found it. The fraud was successful in so far as that it was not detected in time to deprive it of all use, though Moses da Leon's widow is said to have admitted, evidently innocently, that the book had been written by her husband. But otherwise failure?deserved failure?followed; all the power of the Kabbala was let loose. ' Allegorical resurrection' is Martineau's happy phrase for the interpreta</page><page sequence="8">152 The Scottish Antiquary ; tion of the Bible which held sway after the temple had disappeared. With that went the central symbol?the personal idea of religion, a loss not to the common people merely, but even to some of the learned, who had the strange notion that the stability of religion had been shaken when its greatest symbol on earth had been destroyed. There was preparation for the ' alle gorical resurrection,' and energy was given to the mysticism whose unholy fruit appeared in medicine under the guise of charms and astrological speculations. The chief service rendered by the book was the reaction it created in favour of reason?a fit preparation for the work of Maimonides. Solomon Ibn Gebirol, a Spanish Jew born in Malaga, was a Mystic instructed in the doctrines of Plotinus and other Alexandrines. He com bined the teaching of Aristotle and Plato in a way which neither would have recognised. His views led directly to pantheism?to the identifica tion of the supreme intelligence with every part of the sensible world; but he parts with his own scheme at this point, and places the Word as the inter mediary between the world and the essential Unity?the agent by whom all things are brought about. Thus he saves to his conception of the Supreme Being the liberty of action which his system seemed to sacrifice. Man's freedom of action he maintains, for man is but an epitome of creation. Thus he seeks to reconcile the Oriental doctrine of emanation with the biblical teaching of a personal Creator or supreme, omnipotent will. Whether due to their creed or to some other influence, the Arab students confined themselves to their speciality so exclusively that Ibn Roshd, the more familiar Averrhoes, stands out as a student remark able for the width of his studies and the catholicity of his tastes. He was more after the fashion of his Jewish contemporaries. Trained in theology and jurisprudence?really facets of the same knowledge?he was meant to follow the steps of his grandfather, the most eminent of Cordovan jurists. But poetry competed for his attention with philosophy, mathe matics, and medicine. He lived in troubled times?the triumph of the Almohades coincided with his youth, and he was favoured by Abd-el moumen, the first ruler of the dynasty in Morocco, an enlightened prince who sought to establish colleges in his new domain. His successor and son, Yacoub Yousouf, continued the favour, and a few years later (1169) Ibn Roshd was Kadi at Seville; in 1182 physician at the court of Yousouf in Morocco, and, still later, Kadi at Cordova under Almanzour, third ruler of the dynasty. He now got into trouble by the utterance of opinions at variance with the narrow views of his contemporaries, and was banished to Lucena, a village near Cordova inhabited by Jews, who, as a nation, were then under the ban of Almanzour. The Jews of Lucena were converts to Islamism, and as such distrusted by both creeds. It is probable, therefore, that this disgrace indicates belief in the story that he was of Jewish, not of Arab extraction. Be that as it may, he was restored to favour, but only partially; for an eastern Mussulman found him in compulsory seclusion, free, but not at liberty to leave his house. He died in 1198. Under a ruler who denounced philosophy and destroyed works on that subject, Ibn Roshd was a commentator on Aristotle, whom, however, he read by Neo Platonic light. There is much in common with Ibn Gebirol, but he seeks to conform his views with the Koran, with great subtilty, but not with convincing effect. As a medical writer he says himself that his writings are unintelligible to those who are not conversant with philosophy. Under</page><page sequence="9">or, Northern Notes and Queries. 153 such guidance nature would have as much scope for her benevolence as Isaac the Jew specifically enjoins.1 Musa ben Maimon or Rabbi Moses ben Maimon was not a pupil of Ibn Roshd, but, as a near contemporary, shared in the general spirit of the time. His medical writings, so far as they are published, are Hippo cratic, and most interesting for their discussion of tubercle and lung affec tions ; and the scanty morbid anatomy, chiefly comparative, acquired under Arab inspiration, is applied to the distinction of those diseases which cause and those which do not cause uncleanness. His popular treatise on poisons is full of practical instructions, rich in remedies, and based on knowledge of the various kinds of poisons, the natural history being very full. Abridg ments of Galen, whose formal classifications appealed to the Arabs and especially to the Aristotelians, but checked research by rendering anatomy unnecessary; extracts from Avicenna and commentaries on the aphorisms of Hippocrates are among the many works which testify to his wide reading; while a treatise on the preservation of health combines physical with moral precepts, a union much lauded by Albertus Magnus. His remarkable familiarity with the Talmud gave him great influence, and originated treatises of large size and of much importance. His system of Psychology, founded on that of Aristotle, differs from it in some respects. He maintains man's freedom, for while other faculties are inseparable from the body, imagina tion as a function of intellect is the form of the soul itself as the soul is of the body. There are two conditions of intellect, the one material, of the body : the other a direct emanation of the universal intellect. Thus he is brought to face the problem of immortality, and does so with em barrassment, admitting a corporeal return, as the Bible teaches, but regarding it as a future miracle of limited duration, whereas the real end of man is the spiritual immortality when the soul, purged of its impurities, will devote itself to the contemplation of the supreme truth. The knowledge of God can only be attained by aid of all the knowledge open to man, who to use them rightly must be of perfect health. It is a splendid repetition of the Mosaic theme, and such as only a physician could frame. His ladder of the sciences is admirable. Logic and mathematics bring us to the gate of the temple; Physics open to us the vestibule; Metaphysics bring us into the sanctuary. Amid the allegorical interpretations of the Mosaic books, he combats anthropomorphism by denying the possibility of com parison between the created and the Creator. If, he says, God has positive attributes, and if these are essential to His nature, we lose sight, like the Christian Unitarian, of His unity. This argument practically leads to the extreme conclusion that we cannot attribute to God existence and unity, for these are accidental attributes. But what this mystic conception denies he restores under the negatives. God is conscious of Himself, is pure intellect; the object and the act of thought are identical. The existence of God, His unity and immateriality, are compatible with the eternity of the world. Nevertheless he accepts the creation as an article of faith, and affirms that this is more acceptable to reason than its denial. His doctrine of spheres has the earth as the centre, and the stars, as the Psalmist says, ' declare the glory of God.' Prescience he admits, but declares we know nothing of the way in which God sees things; preordination and free will 1 Guy de Chauhac had a different view. Philosophy to him is ' Pelagus quern non licet medicum navigare'; to-day he might almost say, ' quern non potest medicus navigate.'</page><page sequence="10">154 The Scottish Antiquary ; are not therefore incompatible. His reconciliation of Scripture with reason is based on all available knowledge, and though hampered, if one may venture to say so without being misunderstood, by his religious convictions, his writings gave the impulse to thought which culminated in Spinosa and Mendelssohn. It is worth note that Maimonides belongs to the time when, in Christian Europe, the Albingensian revolt against extreme clericalism shook the religious world. It was a time of unrest, when authority struggled with the yearning, ultimately the irresistible demand for individual freedom of judgment. Such were the leaders of thought in the Middle Ages. Is it to be won dered at that, in defect of the experimental methods of anatomy and physi ology and other more recent sciences, Medicine remained as Isaac saw it ?a waiter on nature; well versed in symptoms, but lacking a scientific guide to their meaning, shrewd in the use of certain drugs, but thus striving by multiplying them in their prescriptions to reconcile incompatible symp toms, the key to which had not yet been found ? Animated by the love of knowledge, the Jews at this time were far in advance of their Christian contemporaries in many respects. Their devotion to observation was supreme, and, to this extent pupils of the Arabs, they adopted all that the infant Chemistry could teach. We find them in attendance on the great, not always openly as they had been on Basilius and Justin?as they were on Giovanni de Medici, as Maimonides was on Saladin, as Jehuda bar Joseph on Ferdinand III. Charles the Bold was the son of a Jewess, and Zedekiah was his physician. Don Pedro had Abraham ibn Zazal, Henri IV. had Manuel Pomentel as his friend. In the sixteenth century De Pomis got leave to attend Christians, but before that, in the thirteenth century, Moses of the Tibbon family was forbidden to practise, in the interests of the Christian doctors ; yet the Jews had masters in the art, and were not content with the cramping system of apprenticeship. Louis IX. had need of an oculist, but curious diplomacy was needed before Abraham of Aragon could be fetched to tend him. At that very time Jews were examiners in the school of Montpellier, for none else were fit for the duty. It is uncertain whether Jews were the founders of the school of Salerno, which, in 1160, Benjamin of Tudela visited and declared ' the best of the schools of the sons of Edom.' This does not disprove its Jewish origin?only shows that it had fallen into Christian hands, though Jews attended it. There is less doubt that the founder of Salerno, as he is called, took without acknowledgment receipts from a Jewish author. The picture would be incomplete without the shadows, and these are unhappily conspicuous. Conversion to Islamism took place most usually under compulsion, and some were thereafter bitter enemies of the faith they had forsaken; let us charitably suppose that this was only a means of assuring their own safety. The policy of Alphonso XI. of Spain was troubled by the competition of two Jews?Benevista Halevi, financier and physician, who sought to favour imports from Grenada, while Abenhuacar desired to establish pro tection. Jealousy on the part of the latter was the motive of this economic absurdity, foreign to the spirit of his race. A Christianised Jew of Bagdad, Jahia ben Aschesla, became Mohammedan, and wrote against Jews and Christians with impartial zeal. Montpellier, the glory of Jewish culture, was not uniformly wise. Simon</page><page sequence="11">or, Northern Notes and Queries. 155 there strove to stifle science and to end the heresies of Maimonides. Astruc, the better known name of Abba Mair ben Moses, of Montpellier, was a determined enemy of science, and had a powerful associate in Asher ben Yekiel, a great Talmudist, who fled in 1294 from the persecutions in Germany. Beside the conversions from Judaism, there are few of note'to Judaism from Christianity, a surprising fact, since the Unitarians seem to be on the balance between two opinions. I do not say they ought, but it surprises me they have not gone over to the elder faith. An old Jewish writer de clares that the ceremonial law is not the sole feature of Judaism: the obstacle is thus slight. I close my remarks at the thirteenth century, because it is not easy to trace the Jew element in our profession at a later date. Last century Jewish doctors accepted inoculation and pressed its adoption, while mountains of literature accumulated in which Christians found store of argumentative weapons in distorted readings of the Old Testament. This was not a question of race?it was the judgment of competent practitioners, more clear-sighted than the mass of their contemporaries, But it is certain that the race has had?still has?important share in the progress of knowledge, and it is from no remote authority that I learn the success of younger Jews counts for something in the anti-Semitic feeling abroad. In this country that feeling does not manifest itself; it may exist socially, but it is not, on the surface, aggressive. I might point to men holding high positions in science whose nationality is admitted, even avowed; and it may be that the future historian will have to enlarge from our own time the bead-roll of famous men of which I have given here a mere hint. John Young, M.D.</page></plain_text>
