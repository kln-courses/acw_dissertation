Frank3, David Pizarro4, Jolie Baumann1, Leah Dickens1, and Jin Joo Lee2 Department of Psychology, Northeastern University; Media Lab, Massachusetts Institute of Technology; 3Johnson Graduate School of Management, Cornell University; and 4Department of Psychology, Cornell University Abstract Because trusting strangers can entail high risk, an ability to infer a potential partner's trustworthiness would be highly advantageous. To date, however, little evidence indicates that humans are able to accurately assess the cooperative intentions of novel partners by using nonverbal signals. In two studies involving human-human and human-robot interactions, we found that accuracy in judging the trustworthiness of novel partners is heightened through exposure to nonverbal cues and identified a specific set of cues that are predictive of economic behavior. Employing the precision offered by robotics technology to model and control humanlike movements, we demonstrated not only that experimental manipulation of the identified cues directly affects perceptions of trustworthiness and subsequent exchange behavior, but also that the human mind will utilize such cues to ascribe social intentions to technological entities. Keywords decision making, cooperation, social cognition Received I 111 12; Revision accepted 4/1 1/12 People must often decide whether to trust new potential part ners in the absence of reliable information about their past behavior (Axelrod, 1984; Delton, Krasnow, Cosmides, &amp; Tooby, 2011; Frank, 1988). Although forming an entirely new exchange relationship can be extremely advantageous, a deci sion to trust also entails the risk of substantial loss if one's partner acts in an untrustworthy manner. Consequently, any capacity that enhances accuracy in detecting the trustworthi ness of other people would offer a significant competitive advantage. In the absence of reliable information about an individual's reputation, nonverbal cues may serve as one possible source of information about his or her likely actions. Indeed, ample evi dence indicates that humans regularly use specific cues, often without conscious awareness, to infer the motivations of oth ers with some level of accuracy (Ambady &amp; Weisbuch, 2010; Knapp &amp; Hall, 2010). To date, however, the nature of the cues that might predict trustworthy or untrustworthy behavior, or even whether such cues exist, remains unclear. Yet, for coop eration to occur to the degree it does in humans, it appears theoretically necessary that people have access to information related to reliable, albeit imperfect, signals of trustworthy intent of potential partners or to the likelihood of subsequent encounters with them (Delton et al., 2011; Frank, 1988).1 If people lack access to trust-relevant signals in situations in which reputational information is absent (e.g., interactions with strangers) and in which the likelihood of repeated interac tions is low, it is likely that the advantages of acting opportu nistically would reduce cooperation substantially. Given the theoretical import and adaptive advantages of an ability to assess trustworthiness, the search for trust-relevant signals has long occupied the attention of scholars from many fields (e.g., psychology, behavioral economics, evolutionary biology). Researchers have looked in vain for a single dynamic "golden cue" that predicts whether a person can actually be trusted (Ambady &amp; Weisbuch, 2010; Knapp &amp; Hall, 2010). In a similar vein, researchers have also looked for and identified certain markers that affect judgments of trustworthiness of static faces (Todorov, Baron, &amp; Oosterhof, 2008); however, there is little reliable evidence linking such markers to peo ple's actual behaviors (Todorov, 2008).2 Corresponding Author: David DeSteno, Department of Psychology, Northeastern University, Boston, MA 021 15 E-mail: d.desteno@gmail.com</page><page sequence="2">1550 DeSteno et al. We believe that past difficulties in identifying trust-relevant signals may stem from attempts to look at cues individually or in isolation from social interaction. We suspect that if reliable trust-related signals are to be found, they will likely emerge dynamically and be processed intuitively within the context of interpersonal situations between individuals who are unfamil iar with one another. Given that each member of such a dyad is attempting to assess the intentions of an unfamiliar other, signals will likely be subtle and unfold over time as each per son evaluates his or her potential partner. As Frank (1988) noted, interpreting signals of cooperation must either be costly or entail some level of uncertainty, because a costless and per fectly reliable signal would have long since relegated opportu nistic individuals to extinction. Given the increasing volume of work suggesting that the interpretation of nonverbal cues is highly context dependent (Ambady &amp; Weisbuch, 2010; Barrett, Mesquita, &amp; Gendron, 2011), we expect that no single cue will possess substantial trust-related predictive power on its own. As Keltner and his colleagues have shown, nonverbal signals of complex social states, such as embarrassment, are often composed of a set of cues (e.g., Keltner &amp; Buswell, 1997). Indeed, sets, by their nature, can be more informative than any of their individual components because of their ability to resolve ambiguities inherent in the interpretation of single cues (cf. Hall, Coats, &amp; Smith Lebeau, 2005). Accordingly, we expect any trust relevant signal to be composed of a set of cues that are emitted in close temporal proximity and that, when taken together, convey reliable information about an individual's intentions. To examine if and how individuals can assess the likeli hood that a novel partner will cooperate, we designed a two phase strategy. The goal of the first phase was to demonstrate that exposure to nonverbal cues increases accuracy in assess ing trustworthiness and to identify a set of cues that are reli ably predictive of trust-relevant behavior. The goal of the second phase was to manipulate the expression of the candi date cues with exacting precision in order to assess their causal impact on subsequent decisions to trust a partner. Experiment I Experiment 1 constituted the exploratory phase of this project. The primary goal was to identify a set of nonverbal cues that constitute a signal related to the trustworthiness of a novel part ner. To accomplish this goal, we constructed a paradigm in which individuals would interact with a previously unknown other in a "get to know you" conversation (either face-to-face or over a Web-based chat) and then play an economic game with this individual that pitted self-interest against joint interest. Our strategy in this phase was quite straightforward. First, if information about the trustworthiness of another person is conveyed through nonverbal cues, then accuracy in judging the cooperative intent of a partner should be greater when an interaction occurs face-to-face, as opposed to over a Web based chat in which only semantic information is available. Second, if such nonverbal information exists, one should be able to identify a candidate cue set by linking expressions of specific cues to actual economic behavior. Identification of such a signal would, of course, be an initial step, with final confirmation of a cue set requiring validation through experi mental manipulation (which we undertook in Experiment 2). Method Participants. Eighty-six individuals (34 male, 52 female) from the undergraduate participant pool at Northeastern Uni versity agreed to take part in the experiment. They were assigned randomly to 43 dyads, with the only requirement for assignment being unfamiliarity with the assigned partner. Procedure. Dyads were randomly assigned to one of two con ditions: face-to-face interaction or Web-based chat. In the face-to-face condition, the members of each pair were brought into a single lab and seated at a table. In the Web-based condi tion, the 2 participants were instead brought individually into two separate rooms. Participants in both conditions were told that the purpose of the study was to explore how people form impressions of one another, but were not told any details about the economic-exchange game that they would play following their initial interaction. In this first part of the experiment, participants were asked to have a conversation for 5 min. Participants in the face-to face condition spoke face-to-face, whereas participants in the Web-based condition spoke over the Internet using AOL instant messenger (AIM). Participants using AIM were asked to refrain from using emoticons. In both conditions, partici pants were encouraged to speak about whatever they liked, with the exception that they should not discuss what tasks might be coming next. They were given several conversation probes (e.g., "What are your plans for spring/summer break?" "What do you like about living in Boston?") but were told that they should not feel limited to these topics. The reason for prohibiting any discussion of the upcoming economic game was to remove any possibility for strategic deception. Given that partners could not discuss the game, and did not even know its rules or form, active deception was unlikely. Rather, it was our goal to determine if a partner's general level of cooperative intent could be discerned prior to engaging in any type of negotiation with him or her. After providing the instructions, the experimenter left the participants alone to have their conversation for 5 min. Partici pants in the face-to-face condition were recorded digitally for the duration of their conversation by three different cameras: two that captured a head-on view of each participant and one that captured a side view of the dyad as a whole. In the Web based condition, participants' AIM dialogue was recorded as text. Following the initial interaction, participants played a single round of the Give-Some Game (cf. DeSteno, Bartlett, Baumann, Williams, &amp; Dickens, 2010; van Lange &amp; Kuhlman,</page><page sequence="3">Trust Detection 155 I 1994). Participants in the face-to-face condition were removed to separate rooms to complete the game; those in the Web-based condition remained in their separate rooms to complete it. The Give-Some Game is an analogue of a typical prisoner's dilemma but allows for a greater range of behaviors. Each participant is given four tokens, each worth $1 to the participant if he or she keeps it, but $2 if given to the partner. Maximal cooperation and communal gain occur if each individual gives all four tokens to his or her partner (i.e., an $8 payoff for each person). Maximal individual (i.e., selfish) gain accrues to someone who gives no tokens and whose partner gives all four (i.e., a payoff of $12 for the receiver and $0 for the giver). The game thus provides an incremental measure of cooperative intent, with intermediate levels of giving corresponding to degrees of cooperative (i.e., trustworthy) or selfish (i.e., untrustworthy) behavior. In addition to reporting how many tokens they would offer, participants estimated the number of tokens they believed their partner would offer. Once offers were complete, partici pants received their respective payoffs. There was no expecta tion that partners would see each other again; therefore, individuals had no reason to feel pressure to reciprocate. Coding of nonverbal cues. The digitally recorded interac tions from the face-to-face condition were coded by a set of independent coders; each interaction was coded by two sepa rate individuals (interrater agreement: p = .87). Using all three camera angles and Noldus Observer XT software (Noldus Corp., Leesburg, VA), coders marked the start and stop times for each of 12 types of cues throughout each interaction. The cues to be coded were selected on the basis of their frequencies of appearance; a cue had to be expressed by at least 5 partici pants in the data set (although in practice, most cues were expressed by many more individuals) to be coded. The final coding provided a time-synchronized stream of nonverbal cues that were emitted by each participant in each dyad. The 12 nonverbal cues in the coding scheme were the following: smile, laugh, lean forward, lean back, arms crossed, arms open, face touch, hand touch, body touch, head shake, head nod, and look away.3 Results A mixed-model analysis of variance treating dyad as a random factor to control for nested dependencies among participants confirmed that, in accord with our primary hypothesis, accu racy in predicting trustworthy behavior was greater when indi viduals had access to the nonverbal cues of their partners, F(l, 41) = 3.99, p = .05. As depicted in Figure 1, the average pre diction error (i.e., average absolute value of the discrepancy between the predicted and received number of tokens) was smaller in the face-to-face condition than in the Web-based condition. However, general levels of giving were equivalent in the two groups (see Fig. 1). Thus, access to nonverbal cues enhanced accuracy in assessing subsequent trustworthy Face-to-Face Web-Based Chat Condition Face-to-Face Web-Based Chat Condition Fig. I. Results from Experiment I. The graph in (a) shows mean prediction error (i.e., absolute value of the difference between the number of tokens participants expected they would receive and the number they actually received) as a function of condition.

In order to identify a candidate signal that was predictive of trustworthy or untrustworthy behavior, we constructed candi date sets of cues based on both existing knowledge relating cues to affiliative or avoidant behavior (Ambady &amp; Weisbuch, 2010; Knapp &amp; Hall, 2010) and examination of zero-order correlations between frequencies of the 12 cues and the actual economic behaviors of participants. We examined the ability of combinations of cues to predict cooperative behavior using multilevel models that allowed for the control of dyadic dependencies within the data. The general model used to assess the signal value of cue sets with respect to self- and partner-expressed cues, respectively, took the following form:</page><page sequence="4">1552 DeSteno et al. Y.. = Ãn. + Q,.X + r.., y KQ/ j' where Ãoy = ^00 + IV and Ãâ = &lt;Pio Y.j refers to the number of tokens offered for exchange by (depending on the analysis) participants or partners (;) nested in dyads (j); X refers to the mean frequency of the cues (expressed either by participants or by partners, depending on the analy sis) in the set; r.. refers to participant-level error; (p00 and (p1() refer, respectively, to population-value estimates for the inter cepts and slopes linking frequencies of the cues to the num ber of tokens given; and fi()/ refers to dyad-level variability in intercept values of the dependent variable (i.e., tokens given by participants or partners, depending on the analysis). The final candidate set for a trust-relevant signal, determined on the basis of power to predict cooperative behavior and estab lished knowledge relating cues to affiliation- and avoidant relevant intentions, consisted of four cues: hand touch, face touch, arms crossed, and lean away. As expected, none of these cues offered significant predic tive ability when examined in isolation. However, when the cues were taken together in a unit-weighted manner (i.e., the mean value of occurrence across the set of four cues), the resulting signal was predictive of trust-relevant behavior. The more frequently an individual expressed these cues, the less trustworthy was his or her behavior (i.e., the fewer tokens the individual offered to his or her partner), (p|(| = -0.15,/; = .03. Similarly, the more frequently an individual's partner expressed these cues, the fewer tokens the individual decided to offer the partner, (p = -0.13, p = .03. Discussion In Experiment 1, exposure to nonverbal information increased accuracy in assessing the trustworthiness of another person by approximately 37%. Thus, the results of this experiment sup port the existence of a trust-relevant signal. In addition, we were able to identify a specific candidate cue set that was directly associated with trust-related economic behavior. It is important to note, however, that although the identified cue set received empirical validation in this sample, the study was clearly exploratory. The findings could have stemmed from random sample variations or from spurious correlations between specific cues. For example, given that most people unconsciously generate a multitude of potential cues, certain cues might covary with others (e.g., nodding the head while leaning away), which would make spurious correlations between some subsets of cues nearly inevitable. In order to validate the cue set, we therefore needed to achieve exacting control over all potentially relevant cues so that we could manipulate and isolate them experimentally. This strategy would be truly confirmatory and would allow for a clean test of the cue set's causality. Experiment 2 Experiment 2 constituted the confirmatory phase of this proj ect. Specifically, its goals were to allow for experimental vali dation of the causal efficacy of the target cue set identified in Experiment 1. Accomplishing this goal required the ability to manipulate target cues orthogonally to nontarget ones with high precision. However, a fundamental challenge inherent in this research design is that individuals regularly emit cues out side of their own awareness, which makes it difficult even for trained confederates to express individual cues in a reliable and orthogonal fashion. Our strategy for meeting this chal lenge was to employ a social robotics platform that allowed the specific cues emitted by one member of each dyad (the robot) to be controlled to a degree not possible with humans. The procedure for Experiment 2 thus closely mirrored that of Experiment 1, with the principal exception being that one of the members of each dyad was replaced with the robot Nexi (see Fig. 2). The primary manipulation centered on whether Fig. 2. Nexi,the humanoid robot tele-operated in Experiment 2.</page><page sequence="5">Trust Detection 1553 Nexi expressed the target cue set identified in Experiment 1. The causal power of the cue set would be confirmed to the extent that Nexi's expression of the target cues resulted in reduced perceptions of her trustworthiness and subsequent reductions in the number of tokens expected from and offered to her. Method Participants. Sixty-four individuals from the greater Boston community agreed to take part in the experiment (22 male, 42 female; mean age = 21 years, SD = 2.06 years). These indi viduals were randomly assigned to one of two conditions: target cues versus control. Procedure. The procedure for the second experiment was based on that of the first, but with several noteworthy excep tions. The primary difference was that we employed a Wizard of-Oz paradigm, so called because Nexi was controlled by two operators in a separate room. Participants completed the experiment individually rather than in dyads (i.e., Nexi was the partner for each participant). They were brought into a lab where the humanoid robot was already positioned. Partici pants were seated across from Nexi, with a small, low table separating them. Nexi welcomed each participant with a wave, saying, "Hello. It's nice to meet you." Participants were then told that for the first part of the experiment, they would have a conversation with Nexi for 10 min. As before, they were not given any specific details about the second half of the experi ment, which again involved playing the Give-Some Game. The duration of the conversation was extended from the previ ous study's 5 min so that participants would have time to adjust to interacting with a robot. At the start of the conversa tional segment, Nexi provided a few details about herself (e.g., where she was built) to allow participants to become comfort able with conversing with a robot. As in Experiment 1, participants were given a set of con versation probes (e.g., "What do you like about living in Bos ton?"), but in this experiment, they were asked to stick to these topics during their interaction. Participants were not told that Nexi was being tele-operated by experimenters in an adjacent room. The experimenter left participants in the room with Nexi for the duration of their interaction. Three different cam eras were again used to record all interactions. Thirty-one of the 64 participants were assigned to the target cues condition; the remaining 33 were assigned to the control condition. In the control condition, Nexi made several conver sational gestures throughout the interaction, but did not engage in any of the target cues that were found to be predictive of untrustworthy behavior in Experiment 1. In the target-cues con dition, some of the conversational gestures from the control condition were replaced with the target cues (i.e., hand touch, face touch, arms crossed, and lean away); each target cue occurred one to three times (i.e., frequencies similar to those observed in Experiment 1). The robot's expression of all cues was based on prototypical human motions. That is, the gestures were created by an animator who distilled them from examples of human motions.4 Care was taken to keep the robot's overall amount of movement consistent across conditions. Prior to beginning the experiment, we prepared scripted responses to each of the conversation probes. A single female experimenter served as the voice of Nexi and interacted with all participants. Her speech and head movements were tracked and mapped to the robot's head and mouth movements in real time. Cameras and microphones embedded in the robot allowed the experimenters who tele-operated Nexi to see and hear participants conversing with the robot, and face-tracking software was utilized to keep Nexi's gaze centered on partici pants' faces. A different experimenter operated Nexi's torso and arms throughout the conversation, using a graphical user interface (GUI) to do so. In this way, the experimenter who spoke with the participants could remain blind to each partici pant's experimental condition (i.e., target cues vs. control). For detailed specifications of the technology underlying Nexi's animation and control, see Robot System Design in the Supplemental Material; Video SI in the Supplemental Mate rial provides a video example of Nexi's interaction with participants. Following the "get to know you" period, participants were moved to a separate room, where they played the Give-Some Game assuming Nexi was their partner. They also completed several questionnaires that probed their views of and familiar ity with Nexi; the questionnaires included items assessing how much they trusted Nexi and how much they liked the robot (7-point scales). Results The causal efficacy of the signal in question would be con firmed to the extent that Nexi's expression of the cues in the set caused participants to judge her to be less trustworthy and correspondingly led them to expect and offer fewer tokens in the economic game. We used the structural equation model depicted in Figure 3 to examine whether this was the case. Results confirmed the cues' signal value; Nexi's expression of the target cues was associated with a significant decrement in her perceived trustworthiness. This decrement directly pre dicted lower expectations for the number of tokens Nexi would give and also directly predicted a reduction in the number of tokens that participants offered to her. The cues, however, had no effect on economic decisions other than via their impact on perceived trustworthiness. Trimming the direct paths linking condition to the number of tokens expected to be received and the number of tokens given did not diminish the model's good ness of fit, x2(2) = 3.76, p = .15.5 Finally, the effects of the cues appear to have been quite narrowly focused on trust, as their presence or absence did not influence the degree to which participants liked Nexi (t &lt; 1). This finding suggests that the presence of the cues did not pro duce a general "antihalo" effect such that evaluations of the</page><page sequence="6">1554 DeSteno et al. Fig. 3.

Standardized parameters are presented (raw coefficients are inside parentheses). Asterisks indicate significant parameters, p &lt; .05. robot on any social dimension became more negative. In many ways, this finding mirrors a familiar experience for many peo ple in that most can point to individuals whom they like but with whom they would not trust their money. Discussion These findings are noteworthy for two primary reasons. First, they provide a stringent confirmatory test for the validity of the nonverbal signal identified in Experiment 1. The robotic system allowed us to gain precise control over the cues in order to manipulate them in an experimental manner (i.e., as orthogonal from any other cues) and, thereby, test their causal impact. As predicted on the basis of the correlational data from Experiment 1, presence of the cue signal caused individuals to perceive Nexi to be less trustworthy, which directly affected their economic behavior toward her. Second, these findings also offer the first evidence that the human mind will respond to trust-relevant signals emitted by humanoid robots in the same manner as they respond to simi lar signals emitted by humans. It remains to be explored whether the impact of these cues stemmed from the ascription of moral intentions to Nexi's "mind" (cf. Gray, Young, &amp; Waytz, in press; Waytz, Epley, &amp; Cacioppo, 2010; Waytz, Gray, Epley, &amp; Wegner, 2010), or simply from nonconscious utilization of the cues as predictors of Nexi's subsequent moral behavior. Irrespective of mechanism, however, these findings clearly indicate the readiness of the human mind to respond in the expected manner to humanlike biological motion emitted by robotic entities. General Discussion Taken together, these findings are among the first to identify a human capacity to assess whether an unfamiliar individual is likely to behave cooperatively in a given situation.6 They offer empirical support for a phenomenon that has long been theo rized to allow for the existence of cooperation, especially in one-shot dilemmas. Yet it is also important to note that the cues we have identified are almost surely not the only ones that affect judgments of trustworthiness. In the circumstances we examined, cooperation was fairly common, but the default expectation in many contexts may be that cheating will occur. In such situations, a different set of cues, such as those typi cally associated with motivations for affiliation (e.g., leaning forward, affirmative head nods), might hold greater predictive power to detect fair and cooperative, as opposed to selfish and opportunistic, tendencies. Indeed, the informational value of any set of cues is likely to depend on context-based expecta tions about partners' intentions. As noted, these findings also offer initial evidence that the human mind will use nonverbal cues to predict the trustworthi ness of humanoid robots, thereby opening many avenues for increasing the capacity of robots to function as interaction partners capable of building trust and social bonds with humans through either the presence or the absence of specific gestures. In so doing, our findings support the view that robot ics technology has now reached a level where its mirroring of human social cues, though imperfect, is nonetheless sufficient to embody the basic components necessary to engage the social mind's interpretive machinery. We readily acknowledge the view that robotics might not constitute a valid method to study human behavior, as robots clearly do not look or move exactly like their human counter parts. Such imperfections might bias the human mind's responses to nonverbal cues. Although this is certainly a valid concern, it is one that, to our minds, can be addressed empiri cally as opposed to being based on subjective impressions of the "humanness" of any robot. Indeed, within the paradigm of "computers as social actors," a wide range of technological embodiments capable of expressing social cues (e.g., from com puters that interact via text or speech, to animated avatars, to</page><page sequence="7">Trust Detection 1555 physical robots) has been shown to evoke natural human social responses and social judgments, depending on how the cues and embodiments are technologically implemented (Blascovich &amp; Bailenson, 2011; Kidd &amp; Breazeal, 2008; Sidner, Lee, Kidd, Lesh, &amp; Rich, 2005; Siegel, Breazeal, &amp; Norton, 2009). In the present case, the data clearly suggest that partici pants' minds responded to Nexi's nonverbal cues as they would to those of a human. Had Experiment 2 failed to con firm the findings of Experiment 1, any number of reasons could have been posited. For example, the findings from the human-human interactions could have been incorrect, or the technology of the robot might not have been capable of ade quately mirroring human movement. However, when the find ings of the two experiments are viewed as a whole (i.e., the expression of the cues by the robot confirmed the cues' pre dicted impact based on human-human interactions), we believe that the most parsimonious explanation is the prof fered one. Any alternative explanation would require one to accept the view that a biasing agent (e.g., timing of move ments) inserted itself such that it not only produced the pre dicted behavioral effects (i.e., effects matching those from the human-human interactions), but also did so via the predicted mediator. We maintain that interdisciplinary techniques, such as those used here, hold great promise for the study of human social dynamics. Although it is true that the use of interdisciplinary techniques can often be accompanied by increased ambigui ties in the interpretation of any single experiment, as the sim ple act of combining different technologies and paradigms can similarly combine the methodological shortcomings of each, the potential risks that result can be offset through the use of multiple approaches. When findings converge across method ologies, confidence in their robustness is greatly increased, as the number of ways in which replication can erroneously emerge becomes vanishingly small.

Supplemental Material Additional supporting information may be found at http://pss.sagepub .com/content/by/supplemental-data Notes 1. Delton et al. have presented a model simulation showing that cooperation in one-off interactions can occur regularly if expecta tions for future interaction are nonzero. However, their model also suggests that an adaptive advantage in deciding to cooperate may stem from an ability to gain insight into the trustworthy intent of a partner. 2. One exception has been evidence suggesting that individual dif ferences in facial width are associated with differences in selfish behavior (Stirrat &amp; Perrett, 2010). Such a marker, however, is static, and thus unable to account for differences in interactions across situations. 3. Supplementary Methods and Analyses, in the Supplemental Material available online, provides additional information on cue selection and cue frequencies. 4. Prototypical examples of target cues were derived from the video recordings of Experiment 1. 5. Note that the initial model was saturated, and thus fit perfectly. Therefore, the nonsignificant chi-square test for the reduced model indicates not only a lack of substantive change in fit for the reduced model, but also an acceptable fit for the reduced model overall. 6. Frank, Gilovich, and Regan ( 1993) presented initial findings dem onstrating that trustworthiness (operationalized within the context of a prisoner's dilemma) could be assessed with greater-than-chance accuracy; however, this seminal work did not address the mecha nisms by which such judgments might occur.
