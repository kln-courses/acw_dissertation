<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Chapter 8 Bridging the Gap: From Intuitive to Scientific  Reasoning — The Case of Evolution E. Margaret Evans Abstract This chapter notes that the use of intuitions to jump-start more sophisticated  reasoning has been proposed for mathematics. The question addressed is  whether core intuitions can also jump-start biological reasoning. Intuitive  ideas can offer an immediate action plan that facilitates a rapid appraisal of  the human mind or the natural world. Yet, there is a downside, such as a  reliance on what may be inaccurate scientific judgments based on cognitive  predispositions such as anthropomorphic or essentialist reasoning. Studies  conducted with museum visitors are used to support the argument that  specific cognitive predispositions can both help and hinder understand- ing. Further, this chapter claims that core intuitions can provide a series of  stepping-stones, which, if navigated with care, may promote science learning. The use of embodied intuitions to jump-start more sophisticated reasoning has  been proposed for mathematics (Lakoff and Nunez). Can core intuitions also  jump-start biological reasoning, in particular evolutionary reasoning? That is  the question addressed in this chapter. Intuitive ideas can offer an immediate  action plan (Kahneman), allowing us to make a rapid appraisal of the human  mind or the natural world (e.g., a folk psychology or a folk biology: Wellman and  Gelman). Yet, there is a downside, such as a reliance on what may be inaccurate  131 </page> <page sequence="2"> 132 Part 2 • Chapter 8 scientific judgments (Stanovich et al.) based on cognitive predispositions such  as teleological or essentialist biases (E. Evans, “Emergence” and “Cognitive”).  Studies conducted with museum visitors will be used to support the argument  that cognitive predispositions can both help and hinder biological reasoning,  with a focus on evolutionary concepts. From the perspective of the science  learner, it is important to identify when and how this happens. Museum visitors provide an ideal population for such studies, as they are  less likely than the general US population to reject evolution on ideological or  religious grounds (E. Evans et al., “Conceptual Guide”). Further, it is possible  to carry out a fairly rapid assessment of visitors’ reasoning before and after vis- its to exhibits on evolution; as well, the inclusion of different age groups makes  it relatively easy to compare age- and experience-related changes in reasoning,  simultaneously. Results from such studies can provide the basis for developmen- tal learning trajectories. The main argument to be developed in this chapter  is that to the extent that intuitive concepts provide a foundation for scientific  reasoning (Duschl et al.), they should be incorporated into learning trajectories  rather than treated as unwanted intrusions (e.g., Bishop and Anderson). Further,  a developmental approach facilitates studies of the role that intuitive theories  play in early science learning as well as their role as a default reasoning mode  throughout the life span. A more nuanced understanding of intuitive reasoning  modes would improve science learning more generally by providing a framework  for closing the gap between intuitive and more reflective scientific reasoning (E.  Evans et al., “Encountering”) The focus of this chapter is on evolutionary concepts because they provide  a compelling test case. While the historical (e.g., Quammen) and contempo- rary (e.g., Miller et al.) evidence suggests that evolutionary ideas are rejected  on ideological and religious grounds, many have argued that specific cognitive  predispositions play a key role in this rejection. As demonstrated in historical  (Blancke et al.) and contemporary populations, such biases render the human  mind resistant to ideas of evolutionary change while also making it easier to  accept the idea that the origin of life on earth was miraculous (see E. Evans,  “Conceptual Change” for a summary). Before describing those teleological  (Kelemen; Shtulman and Calabi) and essentialist (Coley and Muratore; Gelman  and Rhodes) biases theorized to make evolutionary ideas untenable (Mayr), I  briefly review the extant literature on intuitive and reflective (scientific) reason- ing and consider how the two might compete or cooperate when students study  counterintuitive topics, such as evolution. </page> <page sequence="3"> From Intuitive to Scientific Reasoning 133 In Two Minds: Intuitive and Reflective Reasoning The claim that there are “two minds in one brain” (J. Evans, Thinking Twice),  the one intuitive and the other reflective, has been advanced by Jonathan Evans  and Keith Stanovich, among others, with convergent evidence drawn from a  variety of fields including neuroimaging, to support the basic concept (J. Evans  and Stanovich). Following Jonathan Evans’s Thinking Twice, in this chapter the  terms intuitive and reflective will refer to what has been variously called system 1/ system 2, type 1/type 2, and implicit/explicit processing. Linking this variety of  proposals is a common thread. The intuitive brain is thought to be evolutionarily  old while the reflective mind is more recent and may (arguably) be exclusively  human; the former is a rapid parallel processor of implicit belief-based informa- tion often at a preconscious level (sensations and feelings), while the latter is a  low capacity, effortful serial information processor of explicit information, often  (but not always) at a conscious or meta-reflective level (J. Evans, Thinking Twice;  J. Evans and Stanovich). Importantly, unlike type 2/reflective processing, type  1/intuitive processing is thought to be associative, operating independently of  working memory and cognitive ability, while type 2 processing is rule based (J.  Evans, “Dual-Process”; Stanovich et al., “Complexity”). Anyone familiar with the work on the emergence of children’s theory of  mind and executive function will recognize that according to any of these defi- nitions the reflective mind is later developing, if assessed by children’s increasing  ability to exercise effortful control over their thought processes and to read the  minds of others (e.g., Wellman; Zelazo). Thus, a clear developmental prediction  is that intuitive processes, particularly intuitive theories, are most likely to influ- ence the very young science learner. However, intuitive theories also provide a  default for any age group under circumstances when they have to process infor- mation rapidly or are not explicitly instructed that they should be mindful of the  problem (J. Evans and Stanovich). Do intuitive and reflective reasoning processes compete with intuitions  impeding an understanding of the issue at hand? The classic demonstration of  such competition has been the case of the three-premise logical argument or syl- logism (e.g., no A are B; some C are B; therefore, some A are not C) where the  outcome is either logical but unbelievable or illogical and believable (J. Evans,  Thinking Twice 114). In such studies, believable or unbelievable premises are  substituted for A, B, or C. What tends to happen is that, with little reflection,  participants will exhibit a belief bias and select the intuitively plausible but  </page> <page sequence="4"> 134 Part 2 • Chapter 8 logically incorrect solution (J. Evans, Thinking Twice). In this case the intuitive  and reflective minds appear to compete, delivering different solutions depend- ing on the wording of the problem and whether or not the participant exercises  effortful control over his or her intuitive response. These kinds of studies also  demonstrate, however, that the reflective mind can suppress the output of the  intuitive mind, providing it is given the time to do so and the motivation (J.  Evans, Thinking Twice). How might they cooperate? With the development of expertise in any field,  it is the reflective mind that appears to oversee the initially effortful acquisition  of novel skills; as the skills become routinized they are gradually subsumed under  the direction of the intuitive mind. The classic example of this transfer of skill  is driving. What is at first a long slow and mindful process gradually becomes a  skilled activity that is performed speedily and intuitively with little access to the  reflective mind (J. Evans, Thinking Twice). If, however, a novel problem arises, an  icy road or an unexpected hazard, then the reflective mind swings into action  and analyzes the problem, providing a new plan of action. What is important  to note here is that in general the intuitive mind delivers a fast, effective, and  accurate performance, particularly for routine tasks, even though it might pro- vide an incorrect predetermined response to a novel hazard. In decision making  the intuitive mind draws on past experience, a lifetime of repeated associations  between diverse activities, behaviors, and outcomes. In contrast, the reflective  mind analyzes the immediate present or the possible future, running explicit  simulations (what-ifs) of possible outcomes and planning actions based on these  simulations (J. Evans and Stanovich). This necessarily brief description of the two-mind theory raises a host  of questions regarding the way in which an understanding of the joint actions of  intuitive and reflective processes might be used to help improve the delivery  and understanding of scientific knowledge. In terms of skill development, Sun  et al. (“Interaction”) have suggested that implicit (procedural knowledge) and  explicit (declarative) processes interact to produce learning; moreover, there  are synergy effects. Although in the driving example just described the inter- action would appear to be top-down, with the reflective mind jump-starting  the process, Sun et al. present evidence supporting the argument that there are  likely to be a variety of ways in which the two kinds of learning might inter- act. Sometimes making the learning process explicit hampers learning; in other  cases, implicit and explicit learning appear to be independent processes with  different time courses. To model the possibilities, Sun et al. present a neural  </page> <page sequence="5"> From Intuitive to Scientific Reasoning 135 network model with bottom-up intuitive processes as the driver, which accounts  for different kinds of data, including cases in which learning occurs without  conscious awareness. Two broad conclusions emphasized by these authors are  the importance of modeling both implicit and explicit processes when studying  learning and that bottom-up processes may be as important if not more so than  top-down processes. Much of this research has focused on the learning of arti- ficial grammars or similar problem sets where the influence of prior knowledge  is not necessarily an issue, but what about problem sets where belief biases are  viewed as a key concern, as is often the case for science understanding (Bloom  and Weisberg)? Initially, it would seem, the acquisition of scientific knowledge is likely to be  effortful and slow as it is overseen by the reflective mind, particularly if it involves  the suppression of intuitions that are at odds with scientific ideas. But once sci- entific reasoning becomes routinized and effortless, what happens to these core  intuitions? Are they supplanted? As the evidence indicates that the belief biases  of the intuitive mind never disappear, even if they are temporarily suppressed  (J. Evans and Stanovich), perhaps a better approach would be to investigate how  they are implicated in the learning process. For evolutionary reasoning, the basic claim advanced by many researchers  is that belief biases or cognitive predispositions compete with and impede scien- tific understanding (e.g., Kelemen; Gelman and Rhodes). If this is the case, one  would predict that measures of belief bias would be negatively correlated with  evolutionary reasoning. In the following sections, I demonstrate that this is not  always the case, first for natural selection, and second, for common descent. In  fact, I go further and argue that often such cognitive predispositions may jump- start scientific reasoning in a bottom-up process. The Role of a “Restricted Teleology” in an  Understanding of Natural Selection Even if a particular intuition appears early and is then supplanted by scientific  concepts, this does not mean that the intuition impedes scientific understanding.  All this suggests is that it is a default reasoning mode brought to bear on a partic- ular topic when more reflective reasoning modes cannot be exercised for lack of  knowledge, time, access, or processing capacity. Essentially, this is the argument  that I pursue in my discussion of the effects of teleological and essentialist rea- soning (see Jarnefelt et al., and Jarnefelt, this volume, for a different perspective).  </page> <page sequence="6"> 136 Part 2 • Chapter 8 Of course, this does not mean that the same intuition may be helpful rather than  a hindrance; such a claim requires a more nuanced argument. One of the problems with research on intuitive reasoning is that the target  intuitions are often underanalyzed or blended in such a way that it makes it dif- ficult to decipher the precise roles they actually play in student learning. This is  particularly a problem with the extensive research on the role of teleological rea- soning in students’ understanding of natural selection (E. Evans, “Conceptual  Change”). Teleological reasoning is problematic because it implies purpose,  progression, and intentional design, whereas natural selection exhibits none of  these features — in fact the inverse is true. However, in studies investigating these  effects, purpose and intention are routinely conflated. Students often reason that  out of necessity an organism needs a particular trait in order to survive, in which  case the trait satisfies an intrinsic purpose, called need-based reasoning. But, even  if students lack knowledge of the mechanism by which traits evolve, it does not  necessarily follow that they believe the trait is acquired through the intentional  efforts of the organism, called desire- or want-based reasoning (E. Evans et al.,  “Encountering”). Or, even that an external agent such as God or mother nature  designs the organism for a purpose (E. Evans, “Conceptual Change”). Fine- grained analyses of these reasoning modes suggest the existence of a “restricted  teleology,” whereby students may grasp the idea that an adaptation improves  the survival of an organism without falling prey to anthropomorphic beliefs in  which the organism or an external agent is able, like humans, to intentionally  change the trait (E. Evans et al., “Encountering”). In investigations of this line of reasoning, study participants should be given  the opportunity to endorse or reject each of these reasoning modes in separate  closed-ended questions. Ideally, to gain further insight into their underlying  reasoning, they should also be asked open-ended questions. Using this range of  measures, Evans and her colleagues have conducted a number of studies among  museum visitors of different ages and found that with age and expertise visi- tors increasingly distinguish between want- and need-based reasoning. Typically,  younger school children conflate want- and need-based reasoning, endorsing  both; thus, for this age-group, these modes are often significantly correlated  (Legare et al.), as might be predicted from the research on young children’s tele- ological reasoning (e.g., Kelemen). In contrast, older school children and adults  often adopt a restricted teleological pattern, endorsing need-based reasoning  while rejecting want-based reasoning (E. Evans et al., “Conceptual”; Spiegel et  al.). For example, in a recent museum study (Horn et al.), 8- to 15-year-olds were  presented with three diverse scenarios and asked to explain the adaptive changes  </page> <page sequence="7"> From Intuitive to Scientific Reasoning 137 that occurred over time in the target species. Unlike their younger counterparts,  the 11- to 15-year-olds rejected anthropomorphic explanations (e.g., the lizards  changed over time because “they don’t like to get eaten”) and endorsed need- based reasoning (e.g., “because the different kinds [of anoles] need to adapt to  their different environments”). Critically, it is the latter pattern that is positively  correlated with natural selection reasoning (Horn et al.; Spiegel et al.). This overall pattern of results suggests that a restricted teleology could jump- start natural selection understanding by drawing attention to the necessity of  the adaptation for survival while increasing visitors’ sensitivity to natural mecha- nisms that do not involve the intentional actions of the organism. However, such  studies do not provide evidence of a causal effect. Under what contexts might a  restricted teleology be useful to the learner? As the research team for a multicomponent exhibit on evolution, Evans  and her colleagues investigated this phenomenon in more detail by incorporat- ing these types of scaffolds into the development of a narrative-based exhibition  called “Charlie and Kiwi’s Evolutionary Adventure” (E. Evans et al., “Spiral”).  This exhibit focused on the adventures of a young boy, Charlie, as he traveled  back in time to discover why kiwis (including his stuffed kiwi) lacked the abil- ity to fly and to find out what was so special about the ancestors of birds. In  addition to a video theater experience, which conveyed the story of Charlie and  Kiwi, the exhibition consisted of multiple components providing evidence of  dinosaur-to-bird evolution. One of the challenges of an exhibition targeting  school children was that the design team was inclined to use anthropomorphic  language in the text, because it elicits interest and engages the young visitor. To  assess how such language might affect understanding, the research team con- ducted several studies indicating that a restricted teleology might be a more  effective cognitive tool. In an initial qualitative assessment of children’s understanding of natural  selection, children were asked to recall the story of the Galapagos finches’ sur- vival, after viewing an exhibit on that topic. The following examples of children’s  language in their retelling provided converging evidence for the earlier findings  (E. Evans et al., “Spiral” 49). Interviewer: “Tell the story back to me.” Six-year-old: “The finch wanted a bigger beak” [example of want-based  reasoning] Nine-year-old: “You don’t evolve because you want to . . . you evolve because  you need to” [example of a restricted teleology] </page> <page sequence="8"> 138 Part 2 • Chapter 8 As a follow-up to these qualitative studies, the research team ran an experiment  in which children were randomly assigned to three conditions, in each of which  children were told a story about bird evolution and then asked to recall the story.  In one condition the story was presented using the language of natural selec- tion, in a second condition, want-based reasoning, and in the third, need-based  reasoning (Legare et al., “Anthropomorphizing”). On a variety of measures, the  5- to 7-year-olds were the most likely to use anthropomorphic reasoning and,  overall, the anthropomorphic stories elicited the fewest scientific explanations.  However, all children were more likely to use natural selection reasoning in their  story recall if they had heard either the natural selection or the need-based sto- ries, and this was especially true for the 9- to 12-year-olds. This kind of evidence prompted the exhibit development team to ensure that  the distinctions between want and need, in the form of a restricted teleology,  were called out in the exhibit text and particularly in the video experience. For  example, in Charlie’s time travels he met up with his great-great-great-grandfather  (who looked remarkably like Charles Darwin), and in one scene, while the two  time-travelers viewed a nest of baby dinosaurs, some of which had feathers, the  great-great-great-grandfather said: “Animals can’t just grow feathers when they  want to. They have to inherit them from their parents.” Later, in another scene,  when the old man was explaining why kiwis could not fly, he said: “No, but you  must understand, Charlie: every bird has what it needs for where and how it lives.  It’s adapted to its environment” (E. Evans et al., “Spiral” figure 3.3). Note that  in these examples, both intuitive and scientific explanations were incorporated  into the text, thus merging top-down and bottom-up approaches into a single  cognitive tool. When the exhibition was complete, the research team ran a randomly  assigned controlled study and found that the 5- to 7-year-olds who visited the  target exhibit were much less likely than their peers who visited the control  exhibit to endorse or use anthropomorphic language; additionally, the older  children were more likely to use need-based reasoning and grasp the basics of  natural selection than their peers who visited the control exhibit (E. Evans et al.,  “Spiral”). Such studies provide some evidence that when intuitive concepts are  embedded in the narrative, be it in a curriculum or an exhibit, learners can tran- scend the intuitive and integrate more scientific modes of reasoning into their  explanations. First, however, it is necessary for learners to distinguish between  a restricted teleology, in which adaptive traits serve the intrinsic purpose of the  organism, and a teleology that is intertwined with intentional reasoning. </page> <page sequence="9"> From Intuitive to Scientific Reasoning 139 The Role of an “Expanded Essentialism” in an  Understanding of Common Descent From the early days of research on cognitive biases that inhibit the understand- ing of biological concepts, essentialism has occupied a special niche in the minds  of psychological and biological researchers alike (see E. Evans, “Conceptual  Change”). Ernst Mayr, the foremost evolutionary biologist, noted that prior  to Darwin “[Platonic] essentialism dominated the thinking of the western  world to a degree that is still not fully appreciated by the historians of ideas”  (38). What should replace it? According to Mayr it should be population think- ing. Instead of the Platonic system of a natural world made up of types or kinds,  each with their own fixed eidos or essence, Darwin ushered in population think- ing with its emphasis on individuals, each one of which differed from its neighbor.  Such variation is a key component of natural selection. While research indicates  that an understanding of within-species variation is an important transitional  concept paving the way to a deeper understanding of natural selection (Emmons  and Kelemen; E. Evans et al., “Conceptual”), a focus on morphologically diverse  species highlights a deeper problem. Students who might grasp the concept of  within-species variation and, indeed, of natural selection, still essentialize kinds,  failing to understand that all living kinds are related, with one individual dif- fering to a greater or lesser degree from another in terms of molecular structure  (Olson). Nowhere is this disconnect clearer than among creationists who, while  believing that God placed each living kind on earth separately, may accept the  concept of natural selection providing it is used to explain variation within a  kind, such as dogs or fruit flies (E. Evans, “Conceptual Change”; E. Evans et al.,  “Conceptual”). Even members of the population who accept the idea of evolution agree that  the more taxonomically diverse the species, the less likely they are to share an  ancestor (Phillips et al.; Poling and Evans). In a study of undergraduates, some  of whom strongly endorsed creationism and others of whom accepted evolution,  all were more likely to agree that the more similar the species (e.g., rats, mice)  the more likely it was they had an ancestor in common. The judgment for dis- similar species (e.g., sunflowers, bears) was that they were very unlikely to share  an ancestor. Overall, though, the creationist and more evolutionist students did  diverge, with the latter endorsing common ancestry at a significantly higher  level (Poling and Evans). However, if they had embraced the logic of their belief  systems, creationist students would have rejected any idea of common ancestry,  </page> <page sequence="10"> 140 Part 2 • Chapter 8 while evolutionist students would have endorsed it strongly, regardless of the  dissimilarity of the species depicted. These findings suggest that at an intuitive  level, the idea that taxonomically diverse species are essentially different from  one another is so ingrained in everyday reasoning that it can only be overcome at  a reflective level. This psychological essentialism (Gelman and Rhodes) contrasts  with philosophical or Platonic essentialism in that it is thought to be primar- ily an intuitive bias rather than one derived from cultural input. However, such  essentialist biases are often reinforced by cultural input, not only as seen in cre- ationist beliefs, which are reinforced by biblical texts, but also, paradoxically, by  museums of natural history. Many if not most museum exhibits of prehistoric  life display single iconic exemplars to represent a species or taxon, reinforcing  typological reasoning (E. Evans et al., “Conceptual”) Modern cladistics may also reinforce these intuitions. As described by sev- eral researchers (e.g., Catley et al.; Shtulman, this volume), students and museum  visitors alike are very likely to misinterpret biologists’ trees of life, which display  the evolutionary relationships of diverse species based on molecular or fossil evi- dence (or both). Static diagrams are necessarily limited in the number of taxa  they can portray in a single graphic and they cannot convey the dynamic qual- ity of the relationships. Moreover, visual groupings of limited numbers of taxa  linked by a common ancestor reinforce the idea that taxonomically similar spe- cies share a common essence, which differs markedly from that of taxonomically  dissimilar species. Even more egregiously, often there is a single image of an indi- vidual of the represented species, which again reinforces typological essentialist  concepts. Overall, this line of research indicates that psychological essentialism  is not only almost impossible to eliminate, but can also be inadvertently rein- forced. If that is the case, perhaps a more radical approach is needed: embrace  essentialism but expand it to include all living things. Recently, an interdisci- plinary team of researchers have succeeded in doing just that, with a large digital  touch table exhibiting a dynamic interactive tree of life (Block et al.) One particular focus of this exhibit was the concept of relatedness, from  the familiar notion of family relationships to the less familiar idea of evolution- ary relationships. The dynamic visualization of 70,000 species in the interactive  tree of life exhibit portrayed the idea that all living things on earth are related  (Block et al.). Such a visualization extended the essentialist notion that each liv- ing kind has a unique, immutable essence by providing evidence of the common  ancestry and shared traits of all living kinds, especially that of DNA. Visitors  were encouraged to zoom through the entire tree of life or select images from  a subset of 200 species representing key evolutionary groups and zoom to that  </page> <page sequence="11"> From Intuitive to Scientific Reasoning 141 species’ location in the tree. For pairs of species, the visitor could also activate the  “relate” function, to which the system responded by fl ying through the tree to the  common ancestor of the two species. A key question was “how are humans and  bananas related?” At the shared node, images and text could be activated, which  depicted further information about the species, their ancestors, and their major  shared traits, particularly that of DNA; the latter was represented throughout  the exhibit by a glowing double helix. In an experimental study carried out at two large museum sites, 250 8- to  15-year-olds were randomly assigned in pairs to one of four conditions consisting  of two diff erent versions of the tree of life interactive, a video on a similar topic,  and a control condition, where there was no intervention; all the interventions  were 10 minutes in length (Horn et al.). In the follow-up interviews, youth and  their parents were asked about common ancestry, their interpretation of a tree- of-life graphic, their understanding and acceptance of evolutionary concepts, and  related issues. Th e intuitions of participants in the control condition in response  to questions about common ancestry can be seen in fi gure 8.1 (Phillips et al.). All  Figure 8.1 Common ancestry: percentage of museum visitors in each age group who agreed  that the depicted groups of species share a common ancestor. </page> <page sequence="12"> 142 Part 2 • Chapter 8 participants were asked whether particular groups of species shared an ancestor  (five-point scale: 1 = disagree, 5 = agree); included in the final group of “all living  things” were a beetle, a human, a flower, a bear, a reptile, and a kangaroo. Adults  were significantly more likely than the youth to agree with common ancestry, but  they, like the youth, were significantly more likely to agree that closely related  species such as mice and rats had an ancestor in common (indicating that the  question wording was easily understood). These findings are compatible with the observation that the folk biological  concept of living kinds, in which each kind possesses a unique and unchanging  essence (E. Evans, “Emergence”; Gelman and Rhodes; Mayr; Samarapungavan  and Wiers), emerges early and is widely held, even by educated museum visi- tors — the average adult in this study had a college degree. Overall, those visitors  who agreed that diverse species, including humans, share a common ancestor  were better informed regarding evolution in general and were more likely to feel  that they were related to “all life on Earth” (Phillips et al.). The key question for the study was whether the interventions themselves  would have an effect. The answer was yes (Horn et al.). Youth who interacted  with the touch table in either of the two interactive conditions were significantly  more likely than their counterparts in the control or video conditions to endorse  common ancestry, correctly interpret tree-of-life graphics, and use tree concepts  in their responses to open-ended questions. Analyses of the dyads’ interaction  patterns indicated that the quality of their conversations and of their physical  interaction with the exhibit was positively related to their endorsement of com- mon ancestry, independently of demographic variables such as the youth’s age  and prior knowledge, parent educational level, and parent support for evolu- tion. More specifically, youth who more often used genealogical terms in their  conversation, such as “relate,” and who referenced a greater number of diverse  species were more likely to endorse common ancestry and reference shared traits  such as DNA. Additionally, the more often the dyads activated key table func- tions, such as the relate function, the more likely they were to have these positive  learning outcomes. Although the quality of the conversation and of the tabletop  activations were related factors, they operated independently of each other in  predicting the learning outcomes (Horn et al.). In sum, an informal learning experience that encouraged pairs of youth  to interact with a dynamic tree of life elicited genealogical concepts during the  experience both in their conversation and in the exhibit activation, which, in  turn, predicted a deeper understanding of Darwin’s theory of common descent.  This strongly suggests that these repeated interactions, leading inexorably to the  </page> <page sequence="13"> From Intuitive to Scientific Reasoning 143 observation that all living kinds have an ancestor in common, shifts the empha- sis from the essence of morphologically similar species to the heretofore hidden  essence of diverse living kinds, all life on earth — as indicated by shared DNA. Practical Implications: Informal and Formal  Learning Experiences in Science Based on these two sets of findings, one on a restricted teleology and the other on  an expanded essentialism, I argue that core intuitions can provide a series of step- ping-stones (E. Evans, “Conceptual Change”; E. Evans et al., “Encountering”),  which, if navigated with care, may scaffold science learning (see also Blancke,  Tanghe, and Braeckman, this volume, for a similar argument). First, as demon- strated in these studies, what is required is a molecular approach to these intuitive  patterns, dissecting out the differing concepts that have been subsumed under  the broad categories of teleology and essentialism. Then, effective measures are  needed to assess these concepts and embed them in new learning paradigms.  Finally, it is necessary to devise pedagogical techniques that recruit the reflective  mind, in this case children’s emerging metacognitive skills (Wellman; Zelazo),  to help achieve the transition from intuitive to scientific reasoning. These cogni- tive tools could be made accessible to purveyors of learning experiences from the  classroom teacher to exhibit developers and, indeed, we were able to utilize them  to a limited extent in effective museum exhibits (E. Evans et al., “Spiral”; Horn  et al.). Nonetheless, currently this approach offers only a little more than a prom- issory note; what is needed is a deeper understanding of how these two minds,  intuitive and reflective, can be integrated into a developmental learning program Theoretical Implications: Dual Process Theory “I shall argue that it is essential for the relatively neglected developmental story  of dual processing to be worked out in any complete cognitive theory” (J. Evans,  “Dual-Process” 87). The clear (and obvious) predictions for the development of type 2 processing  are supported by this research; the older the child or student, the more likely he or  she is to use reflective learning processes and adopt scientific concepts, despite the  impact of fairly powerful default reasoning modes provided by omnipresent cog- nitive biases. Importantly, as is clear from the responses of adults (see figure 8.1),  such cognitive biases do not disappear. Type 2 processing does not supplant type  1 processing, moreover, they both coexist. In fact, there is substantive evidence to  </page> <page sequence="14"> 144 Part 2 • Chapter 8 suggest that the use of both reasoning modes simultaneously is a typical feature  of human cognition (E. Evans and Lane; E. Evans et al., “Engaging”; Legare et  al., “Coexistence”). As discussed by both Jonathan Evans (“Dual-Process”) and  Stanovich the predictions for type 1 processing are less clear because essentially  there is no such thing as a uniformly developing type 1 process (Stanovich et al.,  “Complexity”). Type 1 processes are manifest in a variety of forms, from early  emerging cognitive biases, which may or may not be modular in origin (Wellman  and Gelman), to automatized type 2 processes (Stanovich et al., “Complexity”). The examples described in this chapter are of particular cognitive biases or  predispositions that are thought to be impediments to the acquisition of science  concepts. There is a strong tendency in research communities to consider them  biases that should be suppressed in order to acquire a veridical account of the  world (e.g., Gelman and Rhodes; Kelemen; Shtulman and Calabi). Stanovich et  al. (“Complexity”) argue that the capacity to reason hypothetically, a reflective  type 2 process, implies that it is not only necessary to clearly decouple the imag- ined and the veridical worlds, but also to override or inhibit type 1 processing.  This is undoubtedly the case for many instances of controlled processing such as  the execution of skilled behaviors. In contrast, however, what I am suggesting here is that the acquisition of  complex counterintuitive scientific material involves both type 1 and type 2 pro- cessing. The research described in this chapter indicates that with development,  children are increasingly able to integrate the two types of reasoning processes,  using type 2 processing to both modify intuitive biases, as in the case of teleo- logical reasoning, and to amplify them, as in the case of essentialist reasoning.  For this kind of learning to be effective, the reflective and intuitive systems must  cooperate. These studies provide evidence of both top-down and bottom-up acti- vations of implicit and explicit reasoning processes. Further, it seems obvious  that a child or student cannot leapfrog directly from an intuition derived from  a cognitive bias, such as anthropomorphic reasoning, to a scientifically accept- able grasp of a particular topic. What is needed instead is a series of stepping  stones that guide the learner from an inaccurate to a more accurate scientific  model — a developmental trajectory (E. Evans et al., “Encountering”). For this  to be achieved, suppression of the intuitive concept is not sufficient; in fact, it  might be counterproductive, as intuitive predispositions could well provide the  student with an initial entrée into difficult scientific topics. In conclusion, this  line of research indicates that the research community should rethink the role  of intuitions in the acquisition of science concepts. As in mathematics, they may  well jump-start the whole process. </page> <page sequence="15"> From Intuitive to Scientific Reasoning 145 Works Cited Bishop, Beth A., and Charles W.
