<plain_text><page sequence="1">"SOME INFERNAL ALLOY IN HIS METAL": (Auto) Biographical Explanations of Anomalous Behavior Allen R. Dunn T would like to begin with two familiar narratives. In the first narrative a young servant, Jean-Jacques, steals a "little pink and silver ribbon." When the ribbon is discovered to be missing and then later found in his possession, he claims that he did not steal the ribbon but that it was given to him by a young woman named Marion who is one of his fellow servants. The head of the house- hold, Comte de la Roche, interrogates both of the servants but cannot decide who is guilty, and so he decides to dismiss them both, declaring that the guilty party's conscience will avenge the harm suffered by the innocent one. This proves to be true, since Jean-Jacques grows into manhood tortured by the knowledge that he has ruined an innocent girl's reputation and perhaps condemned her to a life of prostitution, since in this world that is one of the few ways in which a young woman without good refer- ences is able to support herself. In the second story, an idealistic young man named Jim is trained as an officer in the British merchant marine. When his training is complete, he ships aboard a British vessel, but is soon injured by a falling spar and left in an Eastern port to recover. When his recovery is complete, he joins the crew of the Patna, a "local steamer" carrying pilgrims on a pilgrimage. One night, the boat strikes a submerged object and seems to be about to sink. In a moment of thoughtlessness or panic, he jumps into a life boat that has been launched by his fellow officers. The steamer does not sink, however, and later the officers are tried and convicted Allen R. Dunn is Professor of English at the University of Tennessee.

Jim spends the rest of his life attempting to come to terms with his dishonorable action. While most biographical and autobiographical narratives are primarily concerned with showing how the actions and events that comprise a person's life fit into a coherent pattern, these narratives present events which their authors claim are atypical, events which cannot be taken to be representative of the life be- ing described without undermining or destroying its coherence. The task of the narrator is to show why the actions in question do not reveal the characters of those who have performed them. In each of these stories, the coherence and moral worth of an indi- vidual's life is at stake. If the narratives are successful, the reader will understand why in the first instance it is fairer to describe Jean Jacques as a benevolent person who has performed a vicious act than simply as a vicious person and why, in the second in- stance, that it is more accurate to describe Jim as a sometimes courageous person who has committed a cowardly act rather than to simply classify him as a coward. These narratives of disavowal are interesting because they raise fundamental questions about the notion of character and its use- fulness as an explanation of human behavior. These stories force us to ask how we can hold on to a credible notion of character while acknowledging that some of a person's actions may be out of character. What criteria allow us to determine which actions do or do not express a person's true character? In these particu- lar instances, these questions are further complicated by the fact that the actions in question were performed against the actors' best judgments. Both Jim and Jean-Jacques knew that the kinds of acts which they committed were wrong, but performed them anyway. Philosophers call this kind of action performed against one's better judgment akrasia, or "weakness of the will." The very possibility of akrasia might be thought to undermine a robust no- tion of character, since it implies that in at least some instances, our best judgments do not determine our actions. Furthermore, some philosophers and psychologists have supposed that akrasia is best explained by assuming that we have multiple identities or at least multiple subsystems of consciousness not all of which are accessible to one another, and this also calls conventional no- tions of character into question. I will suggest some ways in which we might account for apparently anomalous actions and in par-</page><page sequence="3">"Some Infernal Alloy in His Metal" 671 ticular akratic actions without abandoning a strong notion of character. First, I will provide a rudimentary account of what I think a strong theory of character should entail, and then I will consider how it is that we can assert a strong notion of character in the face of anomalous action. The first and most fundamental issue raised by anomalous be- havior is whether human beings in fact have characters which are stable over time or whether character is merely a convenient fic- tion of folk psychology. The answer to this question is often as- sumed to depend upon whether human beings have distinctive behavioral traits which are stable enough over time to allow us to predict certain patterns of human action. Those who believe in the existence of such traits are opposed by those who believe that human behavior is best predicted on the basis of the situation to which it responds. Because it has proved to be very difficult to measure either traits or situations, the evidence marshaled by both sides of the debate has sometimes been difficult to evaluate. In trait psychol- ogy there is an ongoing debate about how a trait can be isolated as a unitary measurable item and whether it is best measured sin- gly or in aggregation with other similar items. For example, is Jim's courage a single trait, or is it composed of parts of impul- siveness and judgment? Measuring the impact of situations proves to be no less difficult. As we know, one person's frank exchange turns out to be another person's hostile confrontation. Fortunately, there is a middle position in this debate, one which acknowledges the force of both traits and situations in de- termining human behavior. A strong notion of character needs only to assert that some human behaviors are the manifestations of traits. Not all or even most human behaviors need be trait spe- cific for character to be a useful tool for understanding human behavior. Even when we have affirmed the existence of durable traits, however, we have not necessarily affirmed any strong notion of character. Durable traits can be the result of any number of fac- tors including biology, early childhood environment, and pat- terns of socialization. Such extrinsic factors as these can and do produce durable patterns of behavior in human beings, but to the extent that we hold one another responsible for the charac- ters which we possess, these extrinsic factors cannot be the whole</page><page sequence="4">672 SOUNDINGS Allen K Dunn story. As Aristotle points out, to the extent that character is the basis of moral judgment, it must reflect an individual's free choice (40-41). The relationship between those aspects of charac- ter which we choose for ourselves and those aspects which we have thrust upon us is very complex. The structure of narrative itself seems to be designed in part to help us negotiate some of this complexity. Some contemporary moral philosophers such as Martha Nuss- baum have suggested that in Western culture at least we have persistently overrated the importance of free choice in shaping our moral identities and underrated the importance of the moral luck which either provides or witholds the moral resources that allow us to live good lives. Despite these difficulties in assessing the relative importance of the intrinsic and extrinsic determi- nants of character traits, the importance of some notion of choice as a determinate of character remains undeniable. People who have enjoyed similar amounts of moral luck do use their resources in strikingly different ways, and these differences are precisely what is usually presumed to reflect character. We may admit that human behavior is determined by situations as well as traits, and that some traits reflect not the conscious choices of individuals but patterns of behavior which are more or less forced upon them, yet these admissions leave us with ample room to develop an account of character which is both explana- tory and the proper subject of moral evaluation. This then puts me in the position to offer a minimalist definition of a strong theory of character. Such a theory will affirm the existence of (1) durable traits (2) which are revealed in actions that are freely chosen. Furthermore, such a theory will presume that (3) in the case of character revealing traits it is the traits themselves and not simply individual actions that are freely chosen. This means that in order to have a character in the fullest sense, an individual's freely chosen actions should reflect some commitment to values, projects, or ways of life that extend beyond the moment. How much self conscious reflection and future planning must one do in order to have character? Children can have very distinctive characters without much future planning. Thus, I would set rather low requirements, but I would insist that some awareness of the way in which character is used to explain behavior is the prerequisite to having character, at least in accordance with the</page><page sequence="5">"Some Infernal Alloy in His Metal" 673 strong theory which I have just outlined. One further stipulation: some durable traits may be too common to confer distinction and thus character in the most common sense. Aristotle stipu- lates that the decisions that define character must not be the kind of decisions that everyone makes. Typically the kinds of choices which define character are those which require a person to choose between various different kinds of goods, goods which may be valued differently by different people. Given the fact that character is composed of durable disposi- tions, which are distinctive and which are revealed in choices that reflect various degrees of freedom and self-awareness, how can we distinguish those anomalous actions which are not represen- tative of a person's identity from those actions which are truly revelatory? The most obvious answer is that we should look for patterns of behavior and disregard those actions which do not fit the pattern. If an otherwise mild-mannered person loses his tem- per only once in the ten years that we have known him, and then with very good reason, I am justified in claiming that he is, in fact, mild-mannered despite his single action to the contrary. However, this averaging out of types of behavior is tricky. Being honest on the average of four out of five times that the truth is at issue, or even nine out of ten times, is not enough to qualify someone as an honest person. If we know that a person deliber- ately lies every once in while, we doubt his commitment to hon- esty, since, as I have argued, character is a pattern of actions that reveal patterns of intention. The issue is further complicated by the fact that the importance of certain types of behavior is heavily situation dependent. It is a far different thing to send an inno- cent person to jail because you have committed perjury than it is to lie to someone by telling him that you like his new suit or haircut when, in fact, you do not. Certain situations and certain types of acts have an automatic life-defining importance. No one is going to be presumed to be peace loving because they have committed murder only once. This returns me to my examples: Both Jean-Jacques and Jim present compelling evidence that the guilty acts which they have committed are not typical of their behavior. For all of his lazi- ness, self-indulgence, and general kinkiness, Jean-Jacques is not usually a vicious person, and for all of his dreamy idealism, Jim is not usually incapable of taking risky action. Yet, each of their</page><page sequence="6">674 SOUNDINGS Allen R. Dunn wrongs is so great that both characters spend considerable effort and energy trying to demonstrate that the actions in question are not typical. They do this, in part, by demonstrating that their good actions far outweigh their bad actions, but, despite this, both seem to be bewildered by their episodes of akrasia. In attempting to exonerate themselves, neither character has recourse to what might be called the standard defenses. Neither can claim that he was ignorant of what was right or coerced into doing what was wrong. Of course, both characters were under considerable duress when they disgraced themselves, but both re- main painfully aware that they could have acted otherwise. Para- doxically, although Rousseau pleads youthful inexperience, confusion, and terror as extenuating circumstances, he cannot bring himself to believe that he is at all exonerated by these cir- cumstances. Similarly, Jim takes great pains to describe the ab- surd series of accidents which led him to abandon ship, but he cannot bring himself to claim that what he did was excusable. Likewise, neither character can distance himself from his ac- tion by claiming that while he may have been a disreputable per- son in the past, he has since reformed and taken on a new character. Neither Jean-Jacques nor Jim acknowledges a dramatic break between his new and his old self; both are more or less committed to claiming that they were of good character before they committed the actions in question. However, it is clear that their guilty actions changed their lives by making each of them determined to demonstrate what he believes to be his true iden- tity. Rousseau claims that he has derived "some benefit" from the "terrible impression" left with him by the crime he has commit- ted. One example of this benefit has been his "loathing of un- truth," and another has been his heightened diligence in guarding "against any act that might prove criminal in its results" (89). Likewise Jim, whose primary character flaw before he ac- cepted the job on the steamer the Patna may have been his pas- sivity, is thrown into a life of hyperactivity as he attempts to prove that his leap into the lifeboat was a freak accident and not a self- defining moment. Yet, these changes in behavior are intended to vindicate the integrity of an old self, not to declare a new one. Ironically, it is the stubborn faith that both Jim and Jean-Jac- ques have in their own basic decency that is the source of the dilemmas which they face when they attempt to explain them-</page><page sequence="7">"Some Infernal Alloy in His Metal" 675 selves. How can they have known what was right, been able to do what was right, and wanted to do what was right, and yet not have performed the right action? This is the conundrum at the heart of akratic action; it has engaged philosophers for ages, and so it is not surprising that it baffles Jim and Jean-Jacques. Socrates, like several more recent philosophers, simply denied that akratic action is possible; he insisted that if one really knows what is right one must inevitably do what is right. This makes knowledge and character the absolute determinants of human action which, while it may have simplified moral judgment for Socrates, seems highly counter-intuitive to many others who have thought about the problem. In the contemporary literature there are two main competing accounts of how it is possible for an individual to know what it is best to do in a given situation but fail to act upon that knowl- edge. One approach to the problem, advocated by Donald David- son and David Pears, is based on the assumption that akratic action is made possible by a form of mental partitioning: Accord- ing to this approach, akrasia occurs because one mental subsys- tem, the subsystem containing an agent's best judgment, is disengaged from another mental subsystem, the subsystem con- taining the desire to perform the wrong action. This mental partitioning theory is challenged by Alfred Mele, who argues that most instances of akratic action can be explained otherwise. His model of akrasia is based upon studies of impulse control in humans and in animals, and he contends that typically incontinent action occurs when an agent is exposed to the temp- tation to act akratically without having first been able to con- struct and practice a strategy of self-control. This means, for instance, that if an individual is torn between two types of satis- factions, the short term satisfaction of eating the Tiramisu in the refrigerator, and the long term satisfaction of losing weight, he is likely to choose the short term satisfaction even against his better judgment if the short term satisfaction is close at hand and if he has not had time to formulate a strategy of self-control. Both the partitioning and the non-partitioning descriptions of incontinent actions provide plausible explanations for akrasia. In this instance, I think Mele's theory best fits the accounts of incon- tinent action given by Jean-Jacques and Jim. Both are prompted to act akratically by the promise of very strong immediate satisfac-</page><page sequence="8">676 SOUNDINGS Allen R Dunn tions, avoiding humiliation and punishment in Rousseau's case and self-preservation in Jim's case, and both are caught off guard by the need to make a dramatic and instantaneous decision. Neither has time to muster strategies of self control, but after the traumatic events, each character devotes a major part of his life to developing such strategies. As Mele points out, this type of ex- planation provides a much more economical and less anthropo- morphic account of akrasia than the partitioning account does. It also gives a much more realistic picture of desire than do many philosophical accounts; it admits, that is, that the intensity of a desire is not necessarily determined by our judgments about what is desirable. The proximity of various satisfactions and the reinforcement or interference of other desires play crucial roles in determining the duration and intensity of a desire. There may be cases, however, as reports of multiple personality most dra- matically illustrate, in which mental partitioning provides the only plausible explanation for self-contradictory behavior. Multi- ple personality disorder does not function well, however, as a model for akrasia, since it entails a partitioning so complete that it eliminates the mental conflict that attends the akratic act. The big problem with partitioning theories, besides paradoxically splitting rational agency against itself, is that they work too well and do not allow for partitions of various heights and permeabil- ity. Do theories of mental partitioning undermine strong notions of character? In so far as they deny the consistency of traits over time or limit the province of choice, they do, but usually only by degrees by restricting the relevance of character to an increas- ingly smaller portion of human behavior. I suspect that for purposes of moral self-understanding, both partitioning and non-partitioning explanations have similar im- plications. Whether the best self is battling a evil twin self or, less dramatically, developing new technologies of impulse control, it faces the same challenge; it must show that its lack of control was truly anomalous and not itself an indication of an akratic charac- ter, a character which is habitually or characteristically incapable of putting its own best impulses into action. Here, perhaps, the non-partitioning theory risks something by not conceptualizing things in anthropomorphic terms. If a man who beats his wife were to describe his violence purely in terms of the proximity of stimulation and failed strategies of self-control, we would rightly</page><page sequence="9">"Some Infernal Alloy in His Metal" 677 suspect that he was shirking moral responsibility for his crimes by not fully identifying with the effects of his actions. Thus, the fig- ure of personification which supports the partitioning theory re- flects an important truth: if we persist in akratic action, our worst rather than our best judgment will be the determinant of who we are. When our flawed judgment regularly prevails over our better judgment, it is inevitable that this flawed judgment will be an- thropomorphized; it will become our character. WORKS CITED Aristotle.
