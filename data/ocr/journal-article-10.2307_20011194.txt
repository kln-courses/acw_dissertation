Peter Gilgen and Conrad Scott-Curtis. Stanford University Press, 1996. 114 pages including notes and bibliography. Introduction: The Debate Over Identity Politics Eric Savoy, in a thought-provoking essay on identity politics (1994), high? lights a tension that has emerged in the 90's between gay studies and the newly popular queer theory. The development of gay studies, according to Savoy, has been self-consciously set within the context of the politics of identity. For example, gay and lesbian historians have attempted to reclaim a presence in the past which they believe has not been identified by straight historians. This return is only possible if you are able to claim a coherent and continuous identity which links the past experiences with the present. Yet, social-constructionist historiographies have, in the last decade, questioned this claim to a coherent identity mainly because of its purported recourse to essentialism. How can we claim a coherent identity that cuts across time, when we see the variety, plurality and fragmentedness of sexual practices, both across cultures and across time. This has fed the project of deconstruction which seeks to destabilize and disrupt all categories of coherence, especially through the use of irony and parody. The development of queer theory is much indebted to the work of Foucault, and, in particular, the tendency to turn the inside out. This means taking an identity such as homosexuality which is presumed to be the source of the subject's actions, and highlight the ways in which that identity is an effect or representation so that the gay subject is able to engage in an ironic self presentation where the emphasis now lies on performance and theatre. There is a shift, here, according to Savoy, "from the gay subject to the deconstruction</page><page sequence="2">208 BOOK REVIEWS of the queer subject, from 'identity' to its fragmentation_" (p. 133). Savoy goes on to identify the troubling aspects of this movement: "If the project of locating the sites of queerness and defining its transgressive maneuvers is completely dissociated and bracketed off from gay and lesbian identity politics, then it seems inevitable that self-identified gays and lesbians will lose what we may currently have, that is, the definitional power over our own sexualities and cultural productions" (p. 134). The problem here in queer theory is that play and irony are divorced from an analysis of the material social context, where some identifiable groups, such as gays and lesbians, have been denied power in relation to other groups, such as straight men and women, who have power. Thus, arguing that anyone can be queer is in keeping with this situation of injustice, and in fact perpetuates it: straight men and women are given privileges to define queer culture, just like they always have done. An important question that emerges from Savoy's reflections is the fol? lowing: what are the consequences for a politically committed activism that strives to overcome injustice of theoretical positions which critically question any attachment to identity politics? More directly, does a deconstruction of sexual identity, and in particular, homosexual identity, pose any dangers for an activist community which is trying to effect actual material change in conditions of inequality? The questioning of identity politics has found a powerful voice in a recent work by Alexander Garcia D?ttmann, At Odds With AIDS: Thinking and Talking About a Virus. Along with William Haver's recent, The Body of This Death: Historicity and Sociality in the Time of AIDS, D?ttmann's book marks a new threshold in the critical exploration of the interconnections between AIDS and sexual identity. It is to D?ttmann's credit that he is able to marshall the power of theory, and, in particular, the depth of analysis provided by Nietzsche, Kierkegaard, Heidegger and Derrida, to critically address these interconnections. However, as with queer theory, we need to be fully cognizant of the implications of such a questioning, especially for those of us who are concerned about material conditions of inequality and injustice and the overcoming of those conditions. The following is an exploration of these implications. 1. D?ttmann's Identity Politics in the Time of AIDS D?ttmann begins his analysis by claiming that in order to be "at odds" with AIDS, "not-one" with AIDS, we need to be "at odds" or "not-one" with time. The questioning that the infected person engages in is one that reveals a fundamental split, a splitting wherein is revealed "the Being-not-one of time,</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 209 the Being-not-one with AIDS that foils the constitution of a coherent time and the coherence of life" (p. 2). The experience of the infected person of Being-not-one with respect to both time and AIDS "represents the collapse of the subject, through and for which the unity of life exists" (p. 3). This means, for D?ttmann, that any response to AIDS which tries "to anchor existence in the unity of time, to tie it back to the unity of time" leads to a position which "justifies AIDS ... playing down the consequences of immune deficiency" (p. 4). We should court the anxiety that comes in the wake of the destruction of a coherent, meaningful existence. Yet, D?ttmann believes that the response to AIDS has not taken full cognizance of this anxiety, but, rather, is dominated by a "restituting intention" which attempts to re-unify time (p. 4). According to D?ttmann, the response by the gay activist community to AIDS has been to find some essential meaning in what has happened, both at the general level of the community, but, more significantly, also at the per? sonal level of an individual "life history" (p. 7). The attempt to re-establish meaning takes place through a process of "mourning the loss of a life charac? terized by promiscuity" (p. 8). D?ttmann contends that this brings into play a therapeutic discourse where the infected person is led to believe that his for? mer promiscuous practices were marked by "narcissism." This in turn leads to the invocation of a guilty conscience and a "confessional mode" where the individual "confesses himself to himself (p. 9). The anxiety that comes in the time of AIDS is not then accepted as an originary condition of being, but is directed instead toward confession and self-punishment (p. 11). For D?ttmann, this project of the restitution of meaning in the time of AIDS is bound to fail because the need to experience a pure loss cannot be satisfied. He claims that, "[t]here is no loss without contamination" (p. 12). Purity is thwarted by "contagion," and even though the infected person might seek to avoid the experience of contagion, this is an "impossible experience" where "time ... is not at your disposal" (p. 16). We are left, then, not with the restitution of meaning, but an impossible experience that speaks to a condition of Being-not-one, an "experience of the uncertainty of all bounds and limits" (p. 16). AIDS has been perceived as a rupture that leads to testimony and confession. But a rupture in what sense? D?ttmann refers to the work of Renaud Camus who has claimed that the emergence and spread of AIDS brings to an end an "epoch of tricks" (p. 29). The term "trick" refers to an "experience of homosexuality" and the term "epoch" refers to "a more or less unique period within a more or less universal history" (p. 29). After the epoch of "innocence" comes a period marked by "confession" and the "loss of innocence" (p. 29). In Camus' historical account, the epoch of tricks witnessed a liberalization of sexuality, especially with respect to homosexuality, a freedom obtained</page><page sequence="4">210 BOOK REVIEWS through historical identity. The subject, the homosexual, was therefore granted a definable identity in this epoch, through what D?ttmann calls a "sacralization of sexuality" (p. 37). However, in D?ttmann's reading, once the historical rupture occurs, brought about by the emergence and spread of AIDS, there arises a fundamental anxiety. This anxiety does not lead, as D?ttmann might hope, to an awareness of an originary Being-not-one, but through confession, leads instead to a "responsible subject," one that has been "converted" to new types of sexual practice, the "[hjygenic care and self-control" of safer sex (p. 37). Thus, the much celebrated "coming out" in the epoch of tricks now leads to a second "coming out" where the homosexual subject is integrated into a new community of those directly or indirectly affected by AIDS. In this context, according to D?ttmann, it becomes impossible to claim an existence that is "impertinent," one that "does not let itself be determined and therefore claims no right to existence," one that "resist[s] all attempts to circumscribe and delimit it" (p. 37). D?ttmann wishes to highlight the problematic position that the AIDS activist community arrives at in the discourse of "safer sex," problematic because, in the face of a fundamental anxiety brought about by historical rupture, it re-weaves a new totality around "coming out" into the full light of responsible sexuality that is now part of a newly conceived homosexual community. D?ttmann believes that, once this reweaving has occurred, we are no longer able to situate ourselves productively in relation to the "heteroge? neous." For D?ttmann, "heterogeneity is heterogeneous only if it interrupts, if something in it remains without connection, without indicating function, without relation" (p. 33). The possibility in historical rupture is that we are given over to a language that fundamentally threatens the unity of reason. With respect to AIDS, it is not a question of whether, through the experience of the rupture, we can create a responsible identity. Instead, it is a matter "of thinking what AIDS might mean for an existence that testifies to nothing and has nothing to confess" (p. 38). The idea of historical rupture that is common in the discourse on AIDS misses out on the realization that "AIDS renders ... boundaries permeable and tears down the limits that have been established" (p. 40). On the basis of this realization, D?ttmann asserts that only the idea of a "primordially im-pertinent existence," an "originary Being-not-one" is able to measure up to the "destructive force of the virus" (p. 41). The crucial insight we are to obtain, according to D?ttmann, one that has not been grasped by the AIDS activist community in North America, is that human existence, if grasped critically, is "infected before all contagion" (p. 41). Thus, the anxiety that comes in the wake of an historical rupture like the one brought on by the emergence and spread of AIDS, is not to be overcome through a reconstitution</page><page sequence="5">BOOK REVIEWS 211 of meaningful identity, but, for D?ttmann, needs to be understood through the idea of an "existence as exposure, as Being-exposure prior to all positing" (p. 34). D?ttmann contends that there is a lack of toleration in the North American gay activist community for the fundamental "undecidability" of Being-not one (p. 48). He believes that the problem for this community lies in the promotion of an "ideal" of sexuality which "distinguishes homosexuals and is supposed to grant them an identity" (p. 53). The gay community then understands this ideal sexuality to be non-sublimated. However, D?ttmann asks whether the creation of an ideal "already demands a sublimation" where the ideal is always already lost. If our originary condition is Being-not-one, then the creation of an ideal must be an impossible attempt to cover over the effects of this condition. This can only lead, according to D?ttmann, to an "impossible, endless mourning" for the loss of the ideal (p. 53). On the basis of the above reflections, D?ttmann makes a distinction between an activism he defends, calling this an "active activism", and an activism dominant in the North American gay community he opposes, calling this a "reactive activism" (p. 76). For D?ttmann, active activism "sees its task as marking and giving testimony of Being-not-one, as a preparation for a life that depends only on the possibility of exhibiting Being-not-one as such." In contrast, reactive activism "gives testimony of the epidemic by subscribing to the telling of its fateful story and by acting in the service of a (collective) subject" (p. 76). 2. A Critique of D?ttmann's Being-Not-One D?ttmann wishes to pose the question as to what the act of testimony in the time of AIDS would look like if it was one forged in full awareness of Being-not-one. He gives the following preliminary answer: "That the under? standing of the historical can never be reduced to a registering, constructing, determining, and defining knowledge ... something that cannot be overtaken by and remain incompatible with knowledge" (p. 69). D?ttmann turns to Kierkegaard for help in formulating a conception of testimony that will relate to the historical in a non-determinate manner. In D?ttmann's reading of Kierkegaard, it is "precisely in the certainty of the having-occurred [that] one must notice the uncertainty that constantly hinders us from comprehending the historical" (p. 69). It is only when we begin to define and identify that we "transform the identified and defined into necessity" (p. 70). History then becomes simply the "occasion for necessity" (p. 70). D?ttmann contrasts this attachment to historical evolution, which Kierkegaard associates with Hegel, with a conception of the "non-historical"</page><page sequence="6">212 BOOK REVIEWS where we have a "pure sequence of contingent occurrences" that is "without sublation" (p. 68). For D?ttmann, the Kierkegaardian imperative is that we find a way to relate to history that is not defined by the workings of the abstract concept which attempts to wash over the radicality of historical contingency with its determinations. The certainty of historical occurrence, according to D?ttmann, needs to be understood as "split by an indefinable and incomprehensible uncertainty." This is what Kierkegaard calls "belief or "faith" (p. 70). Some object that Kierkegaard, despite his criticisms of Hegel, still works within the framework of dialectics. Does not the incommensurable in history concentrate in the "now" moment of the decision of faith, thus giving stability to faith? D?ttmann does not read Kierkegaard this way, or, rather, he wishes to interpret Kierkegaard in such a way as to radicalize his thinking. He believes that in Kierkegaard's thought "faith affords no security against the undoing of understanding, no hold to which the individual can cling" (p. 74). D?ttmann claims that the decision of faith is not the "decisionist act of a subject" (p. 73) where the focus would be on consistency of belief. Instead, we have a "non decisionist, non-subjective act of decision" which is "the act of testifying" (p. 73). The act of testifying is "performative," a performative that does not award us any definite knowledge. Testimony will now create space for actions which do not bring about order and stability. Giving testimony should, then, be distinguished from a "belief in" which attempts to "usurp" testimony. It is the "duty and responsibility" of testimony to overcome this attempt to usurp. Thus, according to D?ttmann, testimony in the time of AIDS "communicates nothing and erases itself (p. 75). In order to begin to develop a critique of D?ttmann's position on AIDS, it may be helpful to draw at this point on Adorno 's critique of Kierkegaard (Buck-Morss 1977, pp. 114?121) and apply that to a critique of D?ttmann. Adorno's critique of Kierkegaard is designed to avoid the pitfalls of relying on a perspective that does away with the material, objective element. Doesn't D?ttmann, in his reliance of Kierkegaard, and in his critique of the condition of false consciousness in the time of AIDS, remove consideration of the objective material world altogether? Are we not witnessing a transcendental solution that discards any hope of transforming material circumstances and moving towards a more just social order? And does D?ttmann not ultimately depend on the inner world of religious experience as the site for overcoming alienation? There is a number of difficulties here. One is D?ttmann's understanding of history. D?ttmann, like Kierkegaard, reduces the object of material history to that of historicity, raising it to an ontological level, one that no longer bears any relationship to actual material conditions, to the actual material condi</page><page sequence="7">BOOK REVIEWS 213 tions of injustice and suffering that persons living with AIDS encounter. There are serious implications for such a move. Once history has been stripped of its specificity, the subject's relationship to an abstract historical dimension becomes one not of mutual transformation but instead of indifference. Mate? rial reality then is simply the occasion for the action of an ethical, spiritual subject, however deconstructed; the object history, as a real material force, has no inherent meaning which could influence the subject. This denial of the specificity and influence of the object leads to a subse? quent difficulty. D?ttmann's subject, like Kierkegaard's, falls back on itself, characterized by an extreme innerness which is without an object, and in turn, a subjectivism that is lacking a subject. Now, D?ttmann might claim that, in the age of deconstruction, we no longer need to cling to the idea of a subject. However, Adomo's attempt to salvage the subject from the mystifi? cations of bourgeoise thought, is based on the idea that, if freedom is going to remain something more than a mystical abstraction, we need the mediation of subject and object. We need a subject who has a concrete relationship with other embodied subjects, an inter-subjectivity, and one that has a mutu? ally transformative relationship to material historical conditions. Without a relationship to outside objects where transcendence occurs through material change, D?ttmann's (deconstructed) subject, again, like the Kierkegaardian subject, can only achieve transcendence through a blind leap into a spiritual world that is decidedly abstract and mystical. At issue here is the preservation of the concept of the subject and the concept of mediation. Adorno believes we need to hang on to both, despite their history within Western metaphysics. In Adorno 's view, without the idea of mediation for the subject we are left, not with freedom and the overcoming of alienation, but a regression into premodern solutions of spiritual escape. D?ttmann develops a position of the Being-not-one of time which is heavily influenced by his reading of Heidegger. For this, the question of death is important, because death is characterized by a certainty, a certainty that "can arrive at any moment" (p. 20). However, in D?ttmann's reading, although death is certain, it is also characterized by an "indefiniteness." Humans, in the state of "everyday concern" flee the certainty of death by highlighting its indefiniteness. By holding on to the idea that you could die at any moment, "death dissolves and disappears in its own indefiniteness" (p. 20). By contrast, in being-towards-death, there is a "tendency of certainty and definiteness to coincide" (p. 20). This experience and the courting of this experience will leave us helpless and totally exposed. According to D?ttmann, this definiteness of certainty demands a "Being not-at-one in Being-not-one" (p. 25). Being-not-at-one does not oppose Being-not-one to Being-one, not-belonging to belonging, lack of identity</page><page sequence="8">214 BOOK REVIEWS to identity, for that would assume an originary totality from which dispersion occurs. Instead Being-not-at-one leads to an awareness of "an exposure with? out a whole ... originary im-pertinence" (p. 25). The only attitude which will "measure up" to the certainty and definiteness of Being-not-one is a Being not-at-one that affirms this originary im-pertinence, this exposure without a whole. This will guard against the "impotence of the reactive," which flees from this realization and finds consolation in the love of a community, a com? munity which thinks that it can, through this-worldly efforts, overcome this originary condition that is inherently split. In the face of the fact that a loved one will die of AIDS, D?ttmann maintains that, "all words of consolation, of appeasement of explanation cannot and must not be endured" because they "regularly lull one into a false sense of security" (p. 26). This analysis of death, according to D?ttmann, relates directly to Heideg? ger's analysis of sickness. In D?ttmann's reading of Heidegger, sickness is "something that affects Dasein itself, Dasein in its entirety or as a whole" (p. 92). We therefore need to look at the boundaries that make up "Being-a-whole ... [f]or as soon as the boundaries draw the outlines of this shape, they open it up to a shapeless outside or a shapeless incompleteness" (p. 93). Dasein's "Being-at-an-end in death" is important because it brings an awareness of the something that is always outstanding in being. Sickness is then an originary condition of being that is always already there but is recognized a such by actual existing historical sickness. Actual existing historical sickness is the occasion for this realization. In order to understand some of the problems associated with D?ttmann's reliance on Heidegger, we need to understand more fully the danger of Hei? degger's conception of being as it is tied to uncritical, antimodernist solutions. Ferry and Renaut argue, contra the French Heideggerians, that Heidegger's support of the Nazi project was not due to an early, lingering attachment to humanism found in Being and Time, where Nazism and humanism are linked through the idea of a metaphysical anthropomorphism, but rather that Heidegger shares with Nazism a hostility toward modernity and its emphasis on human rights and democracy (Ferry and Renaut, 1990). The problem with the anti-humanism that is so evident in thinkers like D?ttmann who have been influenced by Heidegger lies in the sweeping indictment of moderni? ty, where modernity is viewed as a homogenous totality. D?ttmann, in his analysis of existence in the time of AIDS, fails to appreciate the differentiated character of modernity, the fact that in material development there are some developments that are progressive and some that are regressive. The question for Heideggerians like D?ttmann is: are all appeals to individual subjectivity doomed to a fateful connection of reason and domination? For Adorno, espe? cially, this is a crucial consideration, because failure to appreciate the gains</page><page sequence="9">BOOK REVIEWS 215 made by bourgeoise autonomy can easily lead to a flirtation with forms of premodern regression which eclipse any ability to critically reflect on social conditions. D?ttmann's reliance on Heidegger for an analysis of AIDS has an even more troubling side to it. According to Richard Wolin, the issue in the "Hei? degger Controversy" is not whether Heidegger's thinking is through and through fascist; the issue is rather whether or not key aspects of his anti modernist positions predisposed him to supporting Nazi ideology (Wolin, 1993). Although Heidegger distanced himself early on from the way in which the fascist project was unfolding, he believed to the end that this was a per? version of an original truth. The key to understanding Heidegger's life-long attachment to Nazi ideology, according to Wolin, lies in an understanding of how Heidegger's thinking shared certain assumptions about modern soci? ety with other German conservatives of his era. Heidegger, in both his early and later thinking, has a critical stand towards modernity that corresponds to the German conservative Kulturkritik that extends back to the 19th century. D?ttmann's critique seems to share in this conservative agenda. Especially as influenced by the thought of Nietzsche, modern culture and, more relevantly, for the issue of AIDS, modern political activism, are viewed by D?ttmann, as they were by Heidegger, as a form of decadence which can only be overcome through a new heroic ethics. Modern society suffers form a fixation on subjectivity, a subjectivity ruled by epistemological concerns surrounding abstract concepts. This leads to a self-enclosed identity which cuts the individual off from experiences of transcendence and liberation which would come from immersion in the flux of experience. What is prized in opposition to identity thinking is a turn to aesthetics where heroic individuals who have the strength to go against the herd are able to immerse themselves in fragments of experience and capture that experience in the poetic image. Although D?ttmann criticizes Heidegger on various points he shares with Heidegger a fundamental position: the decline of modernity into subjectivity has progressed to such an extent that it is no longer possible to overcome the problems associated with this development through the kind of "immanent criticism" advocated by 19th century thinkers such as Hegel and Marx, where modern society is capable of redemption from within through a development of the progressive forces which could sub?ate the negative. What is lost in D?ttmann's position is any ability to differentiate between positive and negative aspects of modern society, and in particular, between positive aspects of the activist struggle against AIDS, and negative aspects of that activist project that are worthy of criticism. Would it not be more enlightening for us to view the positive and the negative in dialectical tension with each other? To use Benjaminian language, we might serve the cause of</page><page sequence="10">216 BOOK REVIEWS justice more if we are able to view the positive as exiting in an ever-present state of ruin which must be released from its bondage through a constantly vigilant materialist practice, a practice which is, moreover, on guard against its own slide into complicity. Instead, with D?ttmann we have a totalistic critique which seeks to sweep into the garbage heap the complete package of modernity in its attachment to material progress. In D?ttmann's discourse, no worthwhile progress has been made by a committed activist community against AIDS. All the efforts are condemned because they fall under the banner of an appeal to subjectivity. For all his criticisms of abstract thinking in modernity, does not D?ttmann here reveal the most abstract of thought? Similar difficulties arise in D?ttmann's analysis when we turn to his use of Derrida, and Derrida's reflections on AIDS. According to D?ttmann, Derrida claims that we can call the emergence and spread of AIDS an historical event only if we still cling to the notions of "historicality," "epochality," and "subjectivity" (Derrida's terms quoted in D?ttmann, p. 89). In D?ttmann's reading of Derrida, what we are really witnessing is the way in which "the virus weakens the subjective recuperation of the event" (p. 90). We need to direct our attention to the way in which the event "loosens and unhinges the 'stabilizing arrest' which one calls 'the subject' " (p. 90). This is because the virus, according to Derrida, "may have always already afflicted and broken into any 'intersubjective' trajectory" (Derrida quoted in D?ttmann, p. 90). For D?ttmann, what the virus reveals to those with the willingness to see, is an originary condition of being, one that is now recognized through the occasion of the virus. This is an originary condition that is "installed at the heart of the social bond as intersubjectivity" (p. 91). Notice the re-working of the Hegelian notion of the third as mediating element in the dialectic: we have the "indelible trace of the third party?not the third term as the condition of the symbolic and the law, but the third as the destructuring structuration of the social bond" (p. 91). I want at this point to highlight the contrast implicit in D?ttmann's position between an Hegelian inspired analysis dependent on the notions of mediation and intersubjectivity and a Derridian-inspired deconstruction which critiques any use of these notions. Deconstruction critiques the idea of subjectivity, where subjectivity assumes a mode of reflection in which experience is fil? tered through representations, or synthesizing concepts. In this the original fluidity of experience is lost. The protest here is against the coercive form of unification that takes place in self-consciousness (Dews, 1995, p. 21). Before deconstruction, it was Hegel who was most identified with the critique of this form of reflection. For Hegel, any concept that is abstracted from experience enters into a contradiction, because the attempt at fullness is belied by the lack of objective mediation. The solution is to expose the way</page><page sequence="11">BOOK REVIEWS 217 in which subject and object are reciprocally determined, while at the same time showing how their opposition can only be resolved within the notion of the Absolute. Deconstruction has criticized the Hegelian solution, as another form of coercion where each moment cannot be enjoyed in its particularity but must be joined to other moments in an over-arching system. Rather than Hegel, deconstruction turns to Nietzsche, where there is an emphasis on becoming as opposed to the rigid systems of thought designed to contain this becoming. For Nietzsche, all meaning is projected on to a world that is fundamentally meaningless, without inherent purpose (Dews, 1995, pp. 22, 23). According to Peter Dews (1995), it is revealing to examine the contrast between the deconstructionist critique of modern consciousness followed by D?ttmann and the critique provided by Adorno. Even though there are some very important similarities between the project of deconstruction and Adorno, especially the critique of compulsory identity in both, Adorno's critique dif? fers form that of deconstruction in general, and D?ttmann in particular, in its defense of subjectivity. Adorno shares with Derrida and D?ttmann a critique of the way in which the abstract concept, in its quest to establish similarities, moves quickly away from the understanding of differences, which Adorno calls "identity-thinking." However, Adorno maintains that we cannot solve the problem inherent in the use of universal concepts by awarding ultimate status, as D?ttmann does, to the contingent and the particular, where the contingent and the particular are inaccessible and undefinable to thinking, because the idea of pure singularity is itself an abstraction, a product of identity-thinking. As Dews (1995, p. 29) explains: "But, if every moment is prized purely for its uniqueness, without reference to a purpose or a meaning, to a before or an after, without reference to anything which goes beyond itself, then what is enjoyed in each moment becomes paradoxically and monotonously the same." Instead of the two poles of identity-thinking, conceptual abstraction versus particular abstraction, Adorno advocates an orientation to the non-identical in which the particular is viewed in a pattern with other particulars, forming a constellation. This constellation does not impose an ordering of the relations between particulars, but allows the particulars to stand in tension with each other so that thinking can open itself up to new insights generated by that tension, as well as an openness to non-identity, the inability of the particulars to be subsumed in a system. Notice, that in contrast to the Derridean-inspired thinking of D?ttmann, this maintains a central role to subjective thinking, one that avoids the pitfalls of identity, but yet counts on the principles of mediation and the working of the dialectic. It is important to emphasize the extent to which Adorno's attachment to a dialectics of non-identity maintains a strong materialist element. The</page><page sequence="12">218 BOOK REVIEWS quest of consciousness to transcend its interdependence with the material must be countered with a perspective that demonstrates thought's immer? sion in material life without at the same time accounting for that immersion in emprircist, naturalistic terms. Hence, Adorno's attempt to examine both historical nature and natural history. It is revealing to contrast this material? ist emphasis of Adorno with D?ttmann's Derridean-inspired deconstruction. D?ttmann's thinking, like Derrida's, still works within a transcendental per? spective. For D?ttmann, as for Derrida, the concept of self-presence, is not the primary transcendental concept, but is itself the effect, along with the objects under its sway, of a higher principle of non-identity, which D?ttmann calls Being-not-one and Derrida calls differance. Although the attempt by D?ttmann and Derrida to overcome the problems in identity-thinking seems similar to Adorno's, the key difference, is the way in which, for both of them, thought avoids the materialist moment. Much like Heidegger's notion of Being, D?ttmann's Being-not-one and Derrida's differance attempt to tran? scend the subject-object distinction and thereby tend to lose the dialectical tension that exists between them. For Adorno, subject and object mediate each other, and because of this we can best understand them when we rely on the constellation where the tension between subject and object is always in full view. Thus, unlike D?ttmann and Derrida, we do not attempt to liquidate the notion of subjectivity or identity but establish its tension with material condi? tions, a dialectical, mediated relation. Here, subjectivity or identity becomes non-identical because of its inability to dominate the material moment, just as the material dimension becomes non-identical because of its inability to dominate the subjective moment. Conclusion: A Community-Based Activism Based on Dialectics In conclusion I want to address the possibility of a politics of identity and a community-based activism that is informed by Adorno's concern for both a critically informed notion of subjectivity and a strong materialist analysis. I will do so by returning to the reflections of Eric Savoy (1994) who wishes to defend a gay and lesbian identity politics. Savoy wants to intervene in the debate over the politics of identity in defense of a queer politics that has its roots in an identifiable community. Despite the critical reflections of thinkers like D?ttmann, Savoy believes that it is possible to employ irony successfully within the context of identity politics in order to effect change and overcome injustice. The appeal is to an activist politics where tools of irony are employed in the fight against oppressive conditions.

Queer Nation has registered anger in the context of anti-homophobic theatrical demonstrations which have attempted to reclaim public spaces for gay and lesbians, spaces where previously they have either been denied access as identifiably gay and lesbian, or where they have been abused (p. 141). The most visible of these demonstrations have been "Queer Nights Out", where gays and lesbians take over a straight bar and parody straight rituals of courtship in order to highlight the contradiction between straight culture's formal and abstract affirmation of individual freedom and human rights and their uncomfortableness and, many times, hostility toward the extension of those freedoms and rights to gays and lesbians. As I argue elsewhere (Nonnekes 1992), with reference to a particular exam? ple, the direct action of Queer Nation has strong parallels with Walter Ben? jamin's call for the use of "dialectical images". By forcing the dreams of freedom to be set up against the practice of exclusion you create a powerful image which can only be ignored by those in power by giving up on the dream and resorting to premodern forms of arbitrary rule: the straights at the bar, in order to continue their exclusionary practices, must deny that they believe in freedom for all. The appeal to Benjamin is important here, given Benjamin's enormous influence on the thinking of Adorno, and their common linking of freedom and enlightenment with material change. But, as I have argued throughout this essay, and can be seen with the example above, the dialectical analy? sis proposed by both Adorno and Benjamin is not one that subsumes the contingent and the particular under abstract, universal concepts, but rather, mobilizes the resources available in the contingent and the particular to effect specific violations experienced by a community under duress. This is the context in which to understand the appeal to identity in community-based activism. Contrary to D?ttmann, these bonds of identity do not represent an illusory covering up of an originary condition of Being-not-one, but are the very ground which allows us to recognize the state of ruin for what it is. These bonds of communal identity also give us intimations of a materially grounded paradise, which is the true promise of critique.
