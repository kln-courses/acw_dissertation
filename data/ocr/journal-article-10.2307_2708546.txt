<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE PROBLEM OF ANIMATE MOTION IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY BY JULIAN JAYNES Motion is now so much the domain of physics that it is difficult for us to appreciate that this was not always so. Before the seventeenth century, motion was a far more awesome mystery. Shared by all ob- jects, stars, ships, animals, and men, and since Copernicus, the very earth itself, it seemed to hide the answer to everything. The Aristo- telian writings had made motion or activity the distinctive property of living things, an idea that occurs naturally to children and primitive peoples of all centuries. Because they moved, the stars were thought by no less a scientist than Kepler to be animated. Motion perplexed Gilbert who became convinced that magnets had souls because of their ability to move and be moved. And Campanella in his Neapolitan prison, when he understood what Copernicus was saying, that the earth really moved, exclaimed, "Mundum esse animal, totum sentiens!"1 In a world so sentient and alive, motion is everywhere. And one of the major intellectual developments of the seventeenth century gathered itself to this theme. I shall try to show in this essay that when this idea of animate motion is clarified, one result is the sorting out of the sciences by their subject matter as we know them today. The background of this concern with motion is complex. In the Aristotelian heritage, motion was of three kinds: change in quantity, change in quality, and change in spatial locality. While the sixteenth century was beginning to use the word only in its third sense as we do today, the mysterious aura of its other two meanings hung about it like ghosts into the next century. There was a practical background as well. The sixteenth century, with its political upheavals and religious wars, had seen the beginning of engineering as a political, military, and mercantile necessity. The tricks of the trade were called machines, from the Latin machina meaning a trick or device, ways of making physical objects animate to do work that otherwise men or beasts would have to do . There had, of course, been a long history of such tricks. In the earliest times, machines had been mostly for enjoyment, such as the "automata," originally some kind of dancing dolls moved externally by an elabo- rate, hidden mechanism of strings, weights, and rollers. Such automata are used to illustrate the principles of animate motion in both the Aris- totelian writings on the subject, particularly 701 B of De Motu Animal- 'Thomas Campanella, De Sensu Rerum, Bk. 1, Ch. 9. 219</page><page sequence="2">220 JULIAN JAYNES ium, and then in Galen who was copying him. Machines later came to be used for practical purposes, and instead of making dolls dance, were made to lift weights or pump water. Particularly in the Roman period, mechanical devices of all sorts were brought to bear on many practical problems. And a usually neglected part of the Renaissance was the reawakening of that Roman fascinationwith the possibilities of mechanical engineering. Its first text appeared at the end of the six- teenth century in Jacques Besson's Theatre des Instruments (Paris, 1594). And Galileo himself, at about the same time, spoke of the kind of problems which were arising in the shipbuilding yards at Venice, or in handling artillery, or in the pumping of water in mines, all problems which Leonardo da Vinci had brushed with his vision a century earlier. This tremendous increase in the number of different devices to ob- tain motion induced a curiosity about the ingenuity of God or nature which could make animals or stars move. One of the great turning points in science was when man-made machines became the hypothe- ses or models of natural phenomena. As early as the fourteenth cen- tury, when clocks worked by wheels were still new, it was suggested that the stars were actually a piece of clockwork. While the Greeks had made the analogy that the automaton was like animal movement, some scientists in the seventeenth century, as we shall see, e.g., Des- cartes, were to insist that the two were identical. Motion, therefore, haunted by ancient meanings that made it seem more than it was, and pushed into central focus by the practical necessity of harnessing it to man's use, was a central problem of the century in a unique way. The story begins when Fabricius ab Aquapendente (1537-1619) and Galileo (1564-1642) were rivals for the intellectual attention of Venice a few miles from Padua.2 In 1610 Galileo emulated the older man Vesalian in fame-getting ways by holding his own public demon- stration, not of anatomical dissections, but of his new thirty-power telescope with which he was soon to discover the moons of Jupiter, the rings of Saturn, and the cause of the shine of the Milky Way. But even at this time, Galileo was retreating from this data-collecting into reasoning about motion. The ensuing arguments between Galileans and Aristotelians created an atmosphere of discussion about motion under the overhanging pillared galleries of Padua that involved the whole university. And the aging Fabricius just before he was poisoned3 was swept up into this youthful intellectual melee, writing his last work on animate motion in 1618, De Motu locali animalium. 'One student wrote home in 1549 that Padua was "an infinite resorte of all nations where all kynds of vertue maie there be learned."

Biographie Universelle.</page><page sequence="3">ANIMATE MOTION IN THE 17TH CENTURY 221 This work should be compared to its similarly titled inspirations, the two brief Aristotelian treatises on the same subject.4 The latter are exciting patchwork, remarkable for discovering the problems rather than for solving anything. Coming from them to Fabricius' work is like emerging from a teeming, disorderly, and exciting town into a neat meadow, a more coherent panorama of observations. Because species of the same class often exhibit different modes of motion or combinations of them, he organized his material according to the type of motion: creeping, flying, swimming, walking in bipeds, and finally, walking in quadrupeds and multipeds. These modes of locomo- tion are correlated with the nature of a particular ground, whether the habitat is level or hilly, wet, sandy, or grassy. Moreover, the variabil- ity of a particular terrain or habitat finds itself mirrored in the vari- ability of the locomotions of the particular animals living there. Not having the advantage of Galileo's Della Scienza Mecanica which did not appear until 1634, Fabricius' mechanics of these motions only began what Borelli was to complete at the end of the century. But the work also contains much that is new: the first real description of the peristaltic movement, an attempt to derive all locomotions from two archetypes, walking with diagonal limbs in unison and leaping with opposite limbs in unison-an idea begun in the Aristotelian works,5 and a fascinating section relating wing structure in birds and insects to their flight behavior. Whereas the Aristotelian writings everywhere assume that everything in nature has a function, Fabricius turns this into a principle of economy, that there is nothing extra in behavior. And instead of the Aristotelian principle that nature does what is best, Fabricius states that nature perpetuates what is best.6 This change of verb is a giant step between ancient and modern biology. But in spite of these huge ideas that squeeze in among the detail of Fabricius' ob- servation, the work as a whole is a failure and merely reopens the problem. William Harvey (1578-1647) was Fabricius' best student, and most of his work can be considered an extension of Fabricius'. Recently, a new manuscript of Harvey's has been discovered.7 Somewhere around 4The Peri Zoon Kineseos and the Peri Zoon Poreias of the Aristotelian works. I re- frain from ascribing them to Aristotle since they are obviously multi-authored and are collections of scraps from various sources from the 4th-2nd centuries B.C. 5Peri Zoon Poreias, 705A. 6A relevant passage remarkably prescient of nineteenth-century biology is the fol- lowing (my translation): "In truth, nature fulfills her aim by so bestowing behavioral movements.and functions among animals that they preserve themselves through them; this consists in a preservation of the ablest in obtaining food, in continuing the species, and in avoiding injury."

Whit- teridge (Cambridge, 1959).</page><page sequence="4">222 JULIAN JAYNES 1627, while putting the final touches on his work on the motion of the blood, he began a notebook for his own work on the problem of ani- mate motion, with Aristotle as "my General" and Fabricius "my Guide." But either because of the ravages of the English civil war, or more probably because of Harvey's despair with the problem, only the notes have survived. They are a fascinating failure, altered and crossed out as Harvey's restless and unsatisfied thought frustrated and teased itself further and further into the unresponsive mysteries of behavior. He tried to refine Fabricius' classification of animal move- ment in terms of the means of propulsion, the kinds of movements in- volved, whether sequent, simultaneous or alternating, or the particular organs used. He pushes Fabricius' ecological determinism into gen- eralizations that merely return us to Aristotelian loose ends that, for example, classify human gaits as to whether they resembled "a duck, a crane, a crow, Jew of Malta, ambling Turk,8 servile trot, etc.' The physiology is essentially Galenic in its resort to animal spirits but breaks off into exasperated splurges of metaphor. The brain in partic- ular is compared to a choirmaster, who performs behavior with an exquisite sense of rhythm and harmony. When the brain was removed -and here he cut off the head of a chicken and watched its behavior to prove it-behavior is disorderly, for muscles are like separate living creatures which have to be directed in harmony by the choirmaster of the brain. And from this metaphor, too, comes his emphasis on rhythm in muscular coordination, how each muscular system has a subrhythm of tension and relaxation just as the beat of the heart has its systole and diastole. Such rhythms range from the very short period of the heart to such seasonal rhythms as when "frogs and swallows hide in winter and give forth no movements," showing that he had read the erroneous statement of Olaus Magnus in 1555 on the hibernation of swallows as an explanation of their seasonal appearance in Britain. The emphasis on rhythms is a huge thought, but with Cromwell bat- tering the king's armies outside his windows (Harvey was a loyalist), it was scarcely a propitious time for a naturalistic investigation. In fact, his very emphasis on order and harmony reflects the civil commotion all about him. Political struggles of his day become a model of learning. The muscles of the organism are compared to a commonwealth of persons9 that must be governed by a set of laws, where no citizen is useless and where once order is established, there is no more need of a separate monarch to preside over each several task. Cromwell had Charles I beheaded just at this time. Harvey meant that in learning we are conscious of each part of a total action, 8Perhaps indicating something about the flamboyance of acting style of the time, since these are obviously references to two characters from Marlowe's plays. 9An analogy made also in the Aristotelian Peri Zoon Kineseos, 703A30.</page><page sequence="5">ANIMATE MOTION IN THE 17TH CENTURY 223 but that once the action is learned, "one thing follows another in its accustomed order," and no monarch of conscious control is necessary. Harvey's interest in learning was something new to science, though the subject had become fashionable in educational discussions at Padua when Harvey was there around 1600. He is an elementarist on one page, saying that learning proceeds from parts to wholes, from par- ticular movements that "connect up and are commanded as one whole."'0 While on another, he astonishes us with a Gestalt pro- nouncement that "nature thinks of the works to be performed and not of the movement of the muscles."" But the book as a whole is a fail- ure and the deletions and lacunae in the manuscript demonstrate that these were Harvey's feelings as well. The notebook ends with lists of metaphors which might generate some kind of truth. The choirmaster model is reiterated. Or the heart is compared to a general or king, the brain to a judge or sergeant- major, the nerves to leaders or magistrates, and the muscles to soldiers -all, be it noted, enclosed within the animal without relating to its environment. A new metaphor through which to "see" behavior was indeed needed before any further progress could be made. But it was not to be found in Harvey's beautiful and grand similes to music or architecture or government, so complimentary to the reader, but in something much less inspiring, an hydraulic statue, and by someone far more insensitive: Rene Descartes. In 1614, Descartes,'2 a maternally deprived eighteen-year old stu- dent, suffered the first of several breakdowns and hid himself away in Saint-Germain for two years. The only recreation available at that then rural village near Paris was a visit to the royal gardens. They had recently been designed for the new Queen by her fountaineers, the Francini brothers, and consisted of a cascade of six enormous ter- races cut into the steep bank of the Seine. Each terrace ended in a row of dark subterranean grottoes connected by stone vaneted corridors, and in these high gloomy echoing chambers; flickering with torch light on their sculptured ceilings and walls and often filled with eerie music from an hydraulic mechanical organ or mechanical singing birds, were the Francinis' masterpieces: complicated hydraulic statues that moved, danced, or even spoke.'3 Descartes had been a student at '?Harvey, 122. "lbid., 123. 12I am here advancing a theory about Descartes. I have not been able to find more pertinent evidence than I have here cited, and I realize I am being more inferential than scholarly. Descartes nowhere (that I know of) refers to the Francini statues by name or actual place or as to when in his life they so probably impressed him. '3For further descriptions of these grottoes, see Paul Gruyer, Saint Germain (Paris, 1922) and Georges Houdard, Les Chateaux Royaux de Saint Germain-en-Laye (Saint Germain, 1911-12). John Evelyn, the diarist, visited them in 1644 and described them as already beginning to decay.</page><page sequence="6">224 JULIAN JAYNES the King's Jesuit school at La Fleche and so, I presume, would have been allowed in. I am suggesting that these glistening, fizzing statues in their eerie torch-lit world became the surrogate friends of a brilliant intellect unable to cope with people. Descartes tells us himself'4 how he made them move without knowing it; how, on entering, he trod on hidden plates that, for example, when he approached a bathing Diana, caused her to hide her bronze allurements in bronze rose bushes, and when he tried to follow her, caused a stern Neptune to clank and hiss forward to intercept him, creaking his dripping trident puritanically over the delighted philosopher's head. These images, perhaps aiding his recuperation with their paradigms of behavioral control, perhaps stayed at the very depth of Descartes' thinking. He seems to view the entire physical world as though it were modeled on the Francinis' work. It was nothing but a vast machine. Just as in the Queen's gardens, there was no spontaneity at any point. He loathed animism. He loved the statues. Later he named his only child, an illegitimate daughter, Francine, perhaps after their creator. All moved by fixed principles of extension and motion. He was even contemptuous of action at a distance, for this was nothing but animism, and of course found Kepler unreasonable when the latter took the world for a single animal, a leviathan that roared in caverns and breathed in ocean tides. Except for human consciousness, there is only matter, dead matter, measurable and orderly matter, matter that acts on other matter by pushing or pulling matter next to it. And all goes on with the regularity, precision, and inevitability of a smoothly running machine made of nothing but matter. Sometime between the period of his breakdown and 1633, he wrote his L'Homme, and then in the winter of 1645-46, his Passions de l'ame. Both may have been haunted by these early experiences in his late teens. Particularly in the former, he asks what is the difference be- tween the hydraulic statues and the people from whom he has fled, or between the bronze animals in the Orpheus grotto and real animals? As for animals, the answer seemed self-evident. There was no dif- ference whatever. Animals were mere water statues, not conscious, not really living-machines without will or purpose or any feeling whatever. He dissected them alive (anesthetics were far off in the nine- teenth century), amused at their cries and yelps since these were nothing but the hydraulic hisses and vibrations of machines. Every- thing was the same. The hollow nerves and cavities of the brain were the Francinis' pipes, full of animal liquids. He called them spir- its, and in some places referred to them as a subtle air, but it is more correct to think he meant the cerebro-spinal fluids that were filtered '4Descartes, L'homme, ed. Cousin (Paris, 1824), IV, 348.</page><page sequence="7">ANIMATE MOTION IN THE 17TH CENTURY 225 from the blood of the cerebral arteries. The muscles and tendons are merely like the "various engines and springs" which moved the statues. The nerve pipe fed into the muscle, and when the fluid came down, it billowed the muscle out like a balloon, and so made the limb move. Now the important thing about this conception is not its hydraulic neurophysiology (though the hydraulic model is to return again and again in modern psychology) but the treadle side of the business. Un- like Harvey's metaphors, the model of the statue demands that animate behavior be thought of in an environment that triggers these limb movements. The objects affecting the sense organs themselves were the treadles which the visitors stepped on, thus making the statues work. Descartes seems to have two ideas of how this came about. In some passages, he has what I will call with more correctness than taste the flush-toilet model. He thought he had found in his dis- sections that there was a thread running through the center of a nerve. So he considered that the sense organs contracted when stimulated, pulling this thread which ran through the nervepipe all the way up to the brain, which there pulled out a little valve allowing the animal fluids to gush back down and billow out the muscle.'5 But this couldn't explain very much and certainly not variations in the intensity of muscular movement. So in other passages, he speaks of the trans- mission of sensation to the brain being hydraulic as well, perhaps as a wave of pressure rising to the brain and there-and this is extremely important-reflecting back,16 just as the water pressures were re- flected in the joints of the Francinis' pipes, a reflection of the fluids that returned them down other pipes to billow out appropriate muscles. This is the beginning of the idea of the reflex.'7 The Francini brothers from Florence had built more than they knew; they had created the es- sential image behind modern psychology. But Descartes' rapier-like attack on animism in animals stopped short of himself and his own species. He couldn't quite say that he himself and other non-bronze men are merely machines-as La Mettrie was to say later. In fact, the big feature of his philosophical method in his Discours was its new starting point in self-consciousness. And for Descartes to conceive of one of these bronze spurting statues to introspect, perhaps to suddenly spout bronzily at him "Cogito, ergo '5lbid. '6Article 38 of Passions de l'ame.

Never bothering to appre- ciate the problem he had initiated by beginning with a mechanical model as his premise, he backed out of it by calling his self-conscious- ness a thing, in the same sense that the statue was a thing. There were two such things, mind and body. Instead of harmonizing the discrep- ancy of viewpoint by analyzing in a skeptical fashion his own thought- processes as he should, he simply asserted the discrepancy was in nature rather than in his own thinking. Without a quiver of the plume in his hat, he reified his own consciousness into a substance, perhaps even like the mists that hung glistening in the air over the beautiful hydraulic automatons in their irresponsible grottoes, an airy sub- stance uncontrolled by the pipes, springs, and water pressure; in fact, the soul; the sbul that has its own laws, is not dependent on the brain, and has innate structuring and innate ideas prior to experience; the soul that is the misty origin of volition and unbounded place of thought, that at least could be imagined at death to rise, either steamy with sin or misty with innocence, to a heaven situated somewhere above the engaging motions of Saint-Germain. But even this mind, in Descartes' compulsively mechanical and ma- terialistic thinking, had to be joined to the body, though there was no rational necessity to do so. Recent Paduan anatomists had mentioned the pineal gland whose function is just becoming known today.'8 Since it is in the center of the head, is single rather than double as most other parts of bilaterally symmetrical animals, here was the great tiny bridge between the two worlds where the whole mystery of creation was concentrated, where thought meets extension and mastered it, and where extension moves toward thought and is perceived. The soul or mind squeezed the pineal gland this way and that, nudging the animal fluids in the human brain into the pores or valves, and according as they enter or even only as they tend to enter more or less into this or that nerve, they have the power of changing the form of the muscle into which the nerve is inserted, and by this means making the limbs move.'9 Animals, according to Descartes, had no pineal gland (even though it '8The pineal gland was so named by Galen because in the ox brain he was studying, it was shaped like a pine cone (Latin: pinare = pine cone). Vesalius in 1540, caught up in the Renaissance love of metaphor, called the pineal gland the cerebral penis, a notion which may have at least stressed its importance to Descartes and given him the absurd supposition of its motility. See Vesalius' First Public Anatomy at Bologna 1540, An Eyewitness Report by Baldasar Heseler, ed. R. Eriksson (Uppsala and Stockholm, 1959). Its true function is still obscure but it is believed to be an evolutionary vestige of an ancestral light-sensitive organ still present in some lizards. It probably is involved in regulating biological functions related to the amount of light. Its very high concen- tration of serotonin suggests some important new discoveries may soon be made here, particularly in regard to insanity. 'Descartes, L'homme, 347.</page><page sequence="9">ANIMATE MOTION IN THE 17TH CENTURY 227 had been first discovered in animals!), and thus no bridge to the other realm, no thoughts. If they had any thoughts, they would say so and tell us about them. Their silence condemns them into mere automa- tion. It was all so clear and simple that anyone could remember it and everyone did. Thought so novel, so attractive in its bold, clear images amidst the remaining murk of scholasticism, and so flattering to the human species (everything immortal this side of the pineal gland) could not but lift up the attention of a century already impatient with ancient philosophy and longing for a new one. Like magic, a pre- varicating magic I might add, it swept all the old insolubles and scho- lastic confusions out of sight and effort, and into the mists of conscious- ness, leaving the visible world merely a catching clockwork like the flickering grottoes hissing with hydraulic life at Saint-Germain. It is important to appreciate the enormity of the reaction to Des- cartes so that we realize the importance even of his mistakes. Brilliant and arrogant, he was just that bit beside the point on most of the psy- chological problems he tackled as to stir calm reflection into heated discussion. As to the problem of animate motion, the reaction to Des- cartes is in three phases: (1) the refutation of the localization of soul action in the pineal gland; (2) the refutation of his theory of nerve- muscle action and with it the long history of the doctrine of animal spirits; and (3) the continuation of his emphasis on animal motion being caused by stimuli. Archaic for its own day, the errors of Descartes' physiology were pointed out one by one as they appeared. The year following the pub- lication of Traite de l'Homme, N. Steno (1638-86), the young Danish theologian and physiologist, found himself "obliged to point out . . . the vast difference between Descartes' imaginary machine, and the real machine of the human body,"20 and showed that the pineal gland existed in animals as well as in man (as had been known before), and in no case had the rich nerve supply which the Cartesian theory demanded. The drivewheel of Descartes' animal machine had been the brain with its ventricles full of valves, but as had long been known, the brain was unnecessary to many animal move- ments. Redi noticed the movements of decapitated snakes. So did Boyle, who also went searching for the seat of the soul in snakes by removing one internal organ after another until his specimens even . . . 20Nicolaus Steno, Lecture on the Anatomy of the Brain (1669), ed. G. Scherz (Co- penhagen, 1965). The great Bishop of Titopolis did not tackle the problem of animal mo- tion himself, but he came to understand the nature of muscle better than anyone else of his century. He knew that if a muscle is cut up lengthwise by scissors in three or four bits, each bit may be made to contract proving that the power of contraction lies in the muscular substance rather than in the whole muscle as a machine.</page><page sequence="10">228 JULIAN JAYNES two or three days after the skin, the heart, and the entrails are separated from it are seen to move in a twining or wriggling manner, may appear to be mani- festly sensible of punctures, being put into a fresh and vivid motion when it lay still before, upon the being pricked especially on the spine or marrow, with a pin or needle.2' And the chance finding that a decapitated tortoise moved three days afterward, provoked an anonymous writer for the recently begun Phil- osophical Transactions of the Royal Society to exclaim that this was a "sore blow" to the Cartesians, "so the Disciples thereof are here endeavoring to heal the wound." But if the Cartesian soul was not in these locations, perhaps it might be in the blood. Blood transfusions, following the technique of blood infusion developed by the architect Sir Christopher Wren, were begun by Richard Lower. Lower replaced the blood of a sheep with the blood of a calf, after which the sheep bounded away and reacted to a dog in typical sheep-like fashion, proving that habits and instincts are not situated in the blood.22 Descartes' idea that the soul had a particular location or isthmus in the body and Steno's im- mediate disproof had thus begun a quandary that was both futile and regressive, and would last well into the next century. The second aspect of Descartes' physiology to be refuted was his concept of muscle action and with it a part of the long tradition of animal spirits. The importance of this refutation must be understood against the larger background of the rivalry between the two great medical theories of the seventeenth century, the Physiatric and the Chemiatric. The former, stressing physical therapies, surgery, and anatomy was the chief trend of the century, and became even more prominent after the exciting success of Galileo's mechanics, Harvey's theory of circulation, and the many mechanical inventions of the time. But the older Chemiatric School, with its chemical and alchemical therapies and theories, was nevertheless still flourishing in the haunted heritage of that wondered, wandering Cabalistic drunk, Paracelsus, particularly in Germany and Holland where he had established it. Early in the seventeenth century, a new offshoot of the Chemiatrics appeared, calling themselves Rosicrucians, still a going concern today. From this time to our own, the Rosicrucians have kept alive the older mystiques about motion, referring to vital forces that pass through one body to another. Like Paracelsus, they wallowed in undulant metaphors, using them as explanations, as in the analogy of animate motion with magnetism that later grows into Mesmer's "animal magnetism" and thence into hypnosis. 2'Philosophical Trans. of the Royal Society (1665-67), 387. 22Ibid., 353-58.</page><page sequence="11">ANIMATE MOTION IN THE 17TH CENTURY 229 In general, the Chemiatrics saw the thickening of muscle tissue in contraction as a swelling of the animal spirits similar to the swelling up of a liquid during fermentation. Van Helmont (1557-1644), their most respectable member, did so, although he buried the causative part of the problem of animate motion in spiritual occult agencies called "blasses," interacting with the body through the pylorus, which were little else than the archei of Paracelsus revived for a more critical age. The influence of this idea of muscle action went quite beyond the Chemiatric school itself. John Mayow (1645-79), for example, perhaps because of Lower's experiment, thought the air rather than the blood was impregnated with a "certain, universal salt, of a nitro-saline na- ture, that is to say, with a vital, fiery and in the highest degree fermen- tative spirit"23 whose particles are breathed in and become the animal spirits that account for animate motion. This idea, like Rosicrucian doctrine, has also lasted into our own time, its most recent manifesta- tion being the orgone theory of Wilhelm Reich.24 Descartes had simply taken over this idea of muscle action and crystallized the problem beautifully and wrongly with the simplicity of his vision. The animal spirits that had begun as a confused doctrine over a thousand years before in Alexandrian physiology had indeed come to this. If this could be disproved, if it could be shown that the muscle was not swelled up by liquid or airy animal spirits, the Chem- iatrics had lost their most promising solution to the problem of ani- mate motion and therefore much of their hold on seventeenth-century thought. And this is precisely what happened. The famous experiment of Jan Swammerdam (1637-80) was one of the most important of the century. What a brilliant simplicity it was! Dissecting out the gastronemius muscle of a frog with its attached nerve, he immersed it in water, pinched the nerve, showed that there was no displacement of the water as the muscle contracted.25 Nothing could therefore have been added to the muscle. Even the very demon- stration of such an artificial irritation of the nerve-muscle preparation ruled out all notions of animal spirits being flushed down from the ventricles of the brain, as Descartes had arrogantly insisted. The ex- periment was definitive. The Chemiatric theory of animate motion was never a serious scientific trend again. 23Mayow, De Sal Nitro (London, 1668), cited by Michael Foster, Lectures on the History of Physiology (Cambridge, 1924), 184. 24Wilhelm Reich, The Discovery of the Orgone: the Function of the Orgasm, trans.

It is in the idea that animate mo- tion is to be understood by correlating it with physical stimuli which occasion it. Even Descartes' critics could not escape the power and fascination of seeing behavior in this new way. Swammerdam in particular, a thorough physiatric, carefully related the behavior he observed to stimuli. He noted the contraction of the pupil of the eye when irritated by a "particle of light," the peristalsis of the intestines in proportion to their contents, and how trains of images, just like trains of muscular contractions, can follow each other "urged by one cause of motion to another." And this emphasis is repeated by Francis Glisson (1597-1677) in England, who, I venture, could not escape knowing Swammerdam's widely discussed work. Referring to the Chemiatric theories in his posthumous De Ventriculo, Glisson explained how "this explosion and inflation of spirits has now for some time past been silent, convicted by the following experiment."26 And then went on to perform the same sort of experiment as Swammerdam to show that muscles did not in- crease in bulk during contraction. His experiment with somewhat less elegance used the intact human arm submerged under water. He also stressed certain aspects of Swammerdam's terminology that brought into general biology that unfortunate concept of "irritability." In a different way, the stimulus-response paradigm is continued in the sometimes fantastic work of Thomas Willis (1621-66), a celebrated physician at Oxford.27 His work is an astonishing combination of worth and worthlessness, so that even contemporaries dubbed him "a lucky dissector" who "too soon fell in love with his first thoughts." And those first thoughts were indeed his inspiration from Descartes. Willis was little better than Descartes on the nerves, conceiving them not as tubes, but as "cords lightly strung," the animal fluids slithering down the outside of them into the muscles. His conception of the brain was even more baroque than Descartes', complete with ventricles like halls of mirrors and windows, with actual images projected on the white wall of the corpus callosum by the corpora striata. Images un- dulate about the brain, pushed hither and thither by hydraulics more fantastical than Descartes, and were stored in the folds of the cortex.

First, he carries through all his work the Cartesian idea of behavior as a reply or response to stimuli. He even used the metaphor of an echo, and differs from Descartes in making the periphery as well as the brain the seat of what Marshall Hall in 1833 called the reflex.28 Second, is his emphasis on the hierarchy in the nervous system. The cerebrum presides over voluntary motion and is higher than the cerebellum presiding over involuntary motion. Each has its own memory. This is the first and proper solution to a problem that perplexed many of the writers I have dealt with. Van Helmont had ascribed voluntary and involuntary motion to two occult "blasses." Descartes had hidden the problem of voluntary motion in the depths of his nonphysiological human soul, all other behavior being automatic. And Swammerdam, appalled at this mixture of science and metaphysics, had gone too far the other way in refusing to admit the distinction. Willis put the matter in the right direction, which led to considerable experimental work on the effects of destroying parts of the nervous system in the next century. The important result was to solve the problem of animate motion by classifying it according to the parts of the nervous system necessary to it. What was happening was now becoming clear. The problem of animate motion when separated from physics has two solutions: cor- relating it with stimuli or with parts of the nervous system. But there is another solution. And it is the morose and quarrelsome Giovanni Borelli (1608-79), a troubled and swaggering thinker, who is the very summing up of this seventeenth-century obsession with the problem of motion.29 In one of his early works, he had spoken of the attraction between bodies that we have come to call gravity, explaining the movements of the moons of Jupiter as a resultant between such an attraction and inertia-and this twenty years before Newton. But he lacked the calculus that Leibniz and Newton were inventing even at that very time, and the definitive statement had to wait for Newton's great Principia in 1687. And after a stormy life studying astronomy, fever, kidney function with Bellini, and geometry, and scrapping with the Accademia del Cimento, the scientific society to which he belonged (they met in semisecrecy and were supposed to publish anonymously, which was too much for his ego), Borelli retired to a monastery and spent his last years finishing the work for which he expected fame, and received posthumously, his De Motu Animalium. It was published 2"Hall, "On the reflex function of the medulla oblongata and medulla spinalis," Phil. Trans. Roy. Soc. (1833), 123, 635-65. 29Borelli, De Motu Animalium (Rome, 1680-81).</page><page sequence="14">232 JULIAN JAYNES in two parts, in the two successive years after his death, and is con- cerned with the problem that had persisted since the century had begun. The first part solves much of the problem Fabricius and the Aristotelian writings had opened. Following Galileo's mechanics and Steno's ideas on the structure of muscle, with diagrams and equa- tions meant "to ornament and enrich" his subject, Borelli showed the bones to be true levers, that the length of the limb, the distance to the muscle, or differences in the center of articulation all influence the force necessary to make the movement. When he examined the flight of birds and the swimming of fish, he first looked for the center of gravity, even as Aristotelian writings had done, but with the new Galilean emphasis. One of his sections is entitled: "The Quantity of Air Acted Upon by the Wing of a Bird in Flight Is in Shape a Solid Sector Swept out by a Radius Equal to the Span of the Wing." He demonstrated that "the power of the muscles that beat the wings is ten thousand times greater than the weight of the bird." And from this, he deduced that the story of Icarus is impossible since our pec- toral muscles could never reach this ratio. It is to be noted that he is never concerned with the initiation of animate motion, only its mechanics. In the second part, Borelli went on to apply mechanics to internal motions. He calculated the forces necessary for Harveian circulation, the heartbeat, and respiration, and attempted to apply mechanics to liver and kidney functions with less successful results, biochemistry being unknown. This is, of course, the exciting beginning of physio- logical biophysics. And thus the seventeenth-century's fascination with motion produced major discoveries in physiology as well as in physics and psychology. My underlying purpose in this essay has been to suggest that much of modern science has structured itself out of these seventeenth-cen- tury divisions of the problem of motion. During the Renaissance many thinkers kept and nourished a mystique about motion that confused it with both life and change. Partly because this mystique was so in- tellectually haunting, and partly because motion by machines was becoming more and more important in the European economies, it became the central intellectual concern as the century begins. Even before Galileo disengaged the physical problems of mechanics from this mystical confusion, Fabricius separated out the biological problems of animal motion. He failed to find a solution, but succeeded in correlating animal motion with environment in a remarkably prescient way. Harvey also struggled with the problem but made no advance in it whatever. What was needed was a new metaphor or paradigm for animal motion, one that would differentiate it from the motion of physics. And this, as I have shown, was supplied by</page><page sequence="15">ANIMATE MOTION IN THE 17TH CENTURY 233 Descartes' analogy of organisms with hydraulic sculpture. How ironic that this materialistic idea, by considering animate motion as a re- sponse to stimuli, distinguished it forever from the motion of in- animate objects! Even by 1680, it was somewhat trite to point out, as did Perrault, that, for example, the flowing of a river which "seems to seek the valley,"30 indicating choice and desire, is in reality a wholly different kind of thing than the sense-caused movements of animals. Three solutions followed. First, the paradigm that animate motion is a response to stimuli led directly to the notion of "irritability" and of the reflex, and thence to the stimulus-response psychology of more recent times. Secondly, the explanation of animate motion was felt to be in the nervous system just as a machine is explained by its parts. This led immediately to the study of the localization of function. Willis' idea of the independence and separate functions of parts of the brain was pursued by Boyle, Perrault, Bohn, Chirac, Du Vernez, Preston and others and led to the development of neurology in the next centuries. Thirdly, another kind of explanation was found in the descriptive mechanics of the organism treated as a physical system. After Borelli, there was so little more to say of a fundamental sort that the subject, except for a brief flurry of interest in the late nineteenth century in Marey and others, did not receive further attention until modern biophysics. The seventeenth century, then, sorted out the mystical and con- fused problem of motion into our several modern sciences. Perhaps the most important lesson from all this is to realize the tremendous generative power of metaphor and analogy in the beginnings of science. This is particularly evident with respect to the two kinds of motion. Physics in the seventeenth century is anthropomorphic about matter, applying animate terms like attraction, force (originally mus- cular strength), inertia (originally referring to an idle and unemploy- able person), and acceleration (to hasten one's steps) to get started. The reverse occurred with Descartes when he applied the inanimate statue analogy to animal motion. Newton's Principia in 1687, coming after this history, is of course the major answer to the seventeenth-century concern with the problem of motion. Newton's laws of motion make it all the more clear that physical behavior is a quite distinct thing from animate behavior. Hardly any physicist would ever again think of the world as living because it moved, as Kepler and Campanella had done, and even as Newton was tempted to do at one time. Animate behavior is different. 3?As cited by Fearing, 35. Claude and P. Perrault, Oeuvres Diverses de Physique et de Mechanique (Paris, 1761).
