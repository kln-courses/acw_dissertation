<plain_text><page sequence="1">199 Frans Hemsterhuis's memorial for Herman Boerhaave: a monument of wisdom and simplicity* Frits Schölten The Leiden professor Herman Boerhaave (1668-1738) was one of the most famous men in the Netherlands in the eighteenth century, if not in Europe. His renown as a scientist—doctor, anatomist, botanist and chem ist—spread far beyond the country's borders, and soon after his death he became the subject of several biog raphies that boosted his international reputation even further and gave him an iconic status. On 4 November 1738, shortly after his death, his friend Albert Schultens delivered a funeral oration, the Oratio académica in me moria Hermanni Boerhaavii, which was published in Latin, French and Dutch.1 He characterized Boerhaave not only as a brilliant scientist but also as an extremely pious and honorable man, emphasizing his frugal and simple lifestyle, which was also reflected in his motto: Sigillum veri simplex (Simplicity is the hallmark [liter ally: seal] of truth). Boerhaave's courage on his death bed and his death agonies were also dwelt on at length, providing a fitting end to this hagiography. Schultens's eulogy was soon followed by several foreign publications on Boerhaave's life and work. Samuel Johnson's Life of Dr. Boerhaave was published in 1739,2 followed five years later by William Burton's An account of the life and writings of Boerhaave. Burton could draw on his own observations, for he had been a student of Boerhaave's.3 The French were also quick off the mark, producing no fewer than four biographies between 1740 and 1765 that were partly based on Schultens's Oratio and Bur ton's Account.4 Further evidence of Boerhaave's lasting fame is the fact that as late as 1823 his sculpted por trait was included in Leo von Klenze's Walhalla, the German pantheon near Regensburg (fig. i).s Given all this international fame and recognition it is surprising that Boerhaave was not honored with a fitting sepulchral monument immediately after his death. It was not until more than 20 years later, probably around 1760, that his daughter Johanna Maria took steps to have a memorial erected to his memory.6 On 4 September 1762 it was installed in St Peter's in Leiden—a church that had developed over 150 years into a small academic pantheon where several prominent local scholars had their last resting place.7 The event was reported in De Maandelyksche Nederlandsche Mer curius in October of that year, accompanied by a de * The translation from the Dutch is by Michael Hoyle. 1 By Johannes Luzac in Leiden.

The pedestal is decorated with a profile portrait of the deceased in a wreathed medallion set against a palm frond and laurel branch, a drapery suspended from a scalloped Rococo ornament, and a burning torch crossed with a staff of Asklepios. Hanging below the portrait is the physician's personal seal with the Latin motto men tioned above. In large letters below is the inscription "salvtifero BOERHAAVii genio sacrvm" (Dedicated to Boerhaave's health-bringing talents). Boerhaave's dates are carved on the sides of the pedestal. The urn, finally, is adorned with the curious motif of six heads linked together by an undulating piece of drapery. ANTONI wapperom The maker of this unusual mon ument is identified in De Maandelyksche Nederlandsche Mercurius and in the Nederlandsche Jaerboeken, both of which appeared at around the same time. The Mercurius told its readers about "the monument or tomb of the late learned and widely renowned H. Boerhaave, in his honorable life professor etc. of this university, made by the celebrated Antoni Wapperom, master mason in The Hague, who has the two most distinguished sculptors, Ludovicus de Grave and Anthoni Lannoy in his em ploy," while the contribution in the Jaerboeken, which was clearly written by someone with more knowledge of the subject, merely mentions "the skilled artist An thony Wapperon, mason in The Hague."9 Wapperom (or Wapperon) (1729-81) was a Hague sculptor who had made something of a name for himself around 1760 as a maker of tombs and decorative sculpture. The scanty data about him show that he was a contractor and de signer of masonry and sculpture who collaborated with colleagues to carry out his commissions or had them executed by his assistants. He even entered into a part nership with Johannes Franciscus Maes (1707-59), a sculptor active in both Antwerp and The Hague, with whom he set up a short-lived company, as evidenced by an announcement in the 's Gravenhaagsche Courant of 13 April 17 59.10 Wapperom worked with Maes on the tomb de vier onderscheide standen des mensche, als De Kindsheid.

Boerhaave's memorial is also mentioned in Frans van Mieris's Beschryving der stad Leyden, 3 vols., Leiden 1762, vol. 1, p. 62, vol. 3, pp. 919-20. It was evidently still unfinished when van Mieris started on his description of St Peter's in vol. 1, p. 62: "Omtrent het eere graf van den alom vermaarden Hoogleeraar Hermannus Boerhave, dat eerlang in deeze Kerk by de Zuider deur Staat geplaatst te worden" ("Concerning the tomb of the widely renowned Professor Hermannus Boerhaave that will soon be installed by the south door in this church"), but in vol. 3 (pp. 919—20) he was able to give a detailed description, although it was taken entirely from the reports in De Maandelyksche Neder landsche Mercurius and the Nederlandsche Jaerboeken and so also mentions the names of Wapperom and his two assistants. 10 B.A. Heezen-Stoll, "Nieuwe gegevens over het grafmonu ment van Pieter Mogge te Dreischor," Bulletin Stichting Oude Zeeume Kerken 38 (April 1997), pp. 3—9, esp. note 13.</page><page sequence="4">FRITS SCHÖLTEN and burial vault of Willem Maurits van Nassau-Lalecq in Ouderkerk aan den IJssel (1753-57). He also started on the tomb of the Zeeland regent Pieter Mogge in the Dutch Reformed church in Dreischor (1758-66) with Maes, but later called in the assistance of the local sculp tor Mattijs van Nooyen (1718-79) to complete it, prob ably after Maes's death.11 It is clear from the report in the Mercurius that he did not work alone on Boerhaave's monument either, but involved two employees of his, the otherwise unknown sculptors Ludovicus de Grave and Anthoni Lannoy. After Maes's death Wapperom became the leading supplier of stonemasons' work to the stadholder's court, and that position made him the obvious candidate to execute Boerhaave's memorial.12 Its style alone makes it very unlikely that he also de signed it, for both he and Maes employed an austere, slightly regressive Baroque style that combined late Louis xiv forms with traditional funerary motifs derived from the Baroque sculpture of the southern Netherlands and Italy. A more modern touch was provided by the Rococo decorations, such as rocailles, which gave his tombs a more lighthearted look and which may have been inspired by designs for silver objects.13 Compared to this, the subtle, restrained and slender little memorial for Boerhaave speaks a totally different, Classicist lan guage, despite being made in the same period. It is only the rocaille ornament below the cornice of the pedestal that has anything in common with Wapperom's other tombs. A passage in the Mercurius account alludes to the designer in guarded tones as 'a connoisseur and dis tinguished amateur of classical antiquity.' However, his name is known from the travel journal of J.J. Björnstähl, a Swede who was staying in the Netherlands in the sec ond half of 1774 and the beginning of 1775, and who saw Boerhaave's memorial in St Peter's. "In the aforesaid church I saw the epitaphs for Coccejus, Erpenius and Boerhaave. The latter's memorial is the finest. It was designed by Mr Hemsterhuis, the son, and consists of a white marble vase adorned with garlands upon which one sees a small medallion displaying Boerhaave's like ness with the legend Salutiferio Boerhavii Genio Sa crum and the motto Simplex veri imago [sic]."14 FRANCOIS HEMSTERHUIS (1721-90) The reason why Björnstähl was so well-informed was that he knew "Hemsterhuis, the son" personally. After his very first visit to The Hague, in September 1774, he wrote that "first we visited Mr Hemsterhuis, son of the famous philologist, as did Mr Diderot."'5 That was followed by a second meeting shortly afterwards when Björnstähl visited the stadholders' cabinet of antiquities and med als, of which Hemsterhuis was the curator,'6 and three days later he was invited to come and see the latter's own art collection: "This learned man has a collection of carved antiques and superb modern statues of ivory that is as extensive as it is fine," he wrote. After a detailed description of several ivory statuettes by Michelangelo, Duquesnoy and Girardon and a collection of vases in the Etruscan style, Björnstähl continues: "This man is a true polyhistor. He is a mathematician and astronomer; as an opticist he has invented telescopes of a new kind. In addition, he is well-versed in Greek, a great connois seur of antiquities, a sound philosopher, most notably of psychology. He has written various pieces in a new taste: among other things he has published views about man and has discovered a sixth sense in the latter's heart. He honored us with his printed works, which are very rare, since he had only a very few copies printed at his own expense. One should add that he is also a painter, en graver and sculptor, of which we saw diverse fine proofs. 11 Most of the information about Wapperom will be found in ibid., esp. pp. 5, 6. 12 Unfortunately, neither the wooden model for the Boer haave memorial (Leiden, Museum de Lakenhai) nor any other sculpture is mentioned in Wapperom's will (The Hague City Archives, Notarial Archive, nr. 3995, fols. 366-78 (microfiche).

His artistic preference was for sculpture, which he considered to be the most perfect of all the arts because it was better than painting and drawing at fully representing a body. He said that sculpture could imitate all the contours of a body and give a more accurate representation of nature.20 He set down his ideas on the subject in a brief treatise, Lettre sur la sculpture, which was published in 1769 but was written in 1765.21 He had previously issued a treatise about an antique cameo titled Lettre sur une fierre antique (1762). 4 Petrus Camper, Self-portrait, 1777, plaster in original frame.

In order to observe an object or work of art properly the viewer has to allow his gaze to glide along the contour of the object so that an idea of it can be formed in the mind (for which Hemsterhuis used 6 Vase B, engraving from Frans Hemsterhuis, Lettre sur la sculpture, Amsterdam 1769 the word "soul"). He considered that the speed with which the observer perceives an object is a measure of its beauty. Because the speed of perception depends on the suppleness and simplicity of the contour lines, the sim plicity of an object's contour was thus elevated to an aes thetic norm.23 Similar views were also being expressed elsewhere in Europe at the time. In his Gedanken über die Nachahmung der griechischen Werke in der Malerei und Bildhauerkunst, for instance, Winckelmann wrote en pas sant about the importance of the contour.24 The second 22 Sonderen, op. cit. (note 18), p. 73, goes so far as to say that Hemsterhuis's is the only theory that formulates the artistic endeavor of the second half of the century, Neo-Classicism, so succinctly and forcefully. 23 Early instances of the appreciation of supple contours as the hallmark of classical art will be found in Daniele Barbara's commentary on Vitruvius, I died libri dell'architettura di M. Vi truvio, Venice 1556, and Dolce's Aretino, Venice 1557. Orfeo Bo selli, in his manuscript Osservazioni delta scultura antica, which was written in the 1650s, calls the "subtle contour" the hallmark of true Greek art, possibly inspired by Pliny's description of the sculptor Parrhasios. See E. Lingo, "The Greek manner and a Christian canon: Fran$ois Duquesnoy's Saint Susanna," The Art Bulletin 84 (2002), pp. 65-93, esP- PP- 68, 69. 24 J.J.

A truly beautiful object gives the observer's soul the greatest possible number of emotions and associa tions of ideas in the shortest possible time. In essence, this aesthetic states that "what the soul considers the most beautiful is that which gives us the greatest num ber of ideas in the shortest space of time."25 In fact, the two components of Hemsterhuis's theory of beauty seem to be opposites. It is only where an optimum is achieved between sober contour and the potential for emotions and affects that true beauty is created. Among other things, Hemsterhuis saw that in the art of the ancient Greeks. He illustrated his aesthetic by comparing two vases—an elegant classical form (which he labeled A) with a composite, angular version (B) (figs. 5, 6). This approach was not uncommon in the eighteenth century. De Caylus, Hogarth and Winckelmann also compared vase forms, but Hemsterhuis's deep-rooted fascination with vases played a greater role than it did with those contemporaries.26 Hemsterhuis also put his ideas about sculpture into practice. Björnstähl specifically mentioned his skills as an artist: "One should add that he is also a painter, en graver and sculptor, of which we saw diverse fine proofs. He has all the delicacy of taste that is required of a true artist." Hemsterhuis took sculpture lessons from the German Lorenz Natter (1705-63), who spent several years in The Hague in the service of Stadholder Willem IV,27 and around 1780 he and his friend Petrus Cam per also attended modeling lessons given by the famous French sculptor Etienne-Maurice Falconet (1716-91), who lived in The Hague for two years as the protégé of ■VA/t, 7 Title page vignette, engraving from Frans Hemsterhuis, Lettre sur la sculpture, Amsterdam 1769 the Russian ambassador, Prince Dimitri Gallitzin. The fruits of these artistic activities included the vignettes and illustrations in his treatises (fig. 7), as well as several medals struck in close collaboration with the collector Pieter van Damme, Petrus Camper and the medalist Jo hann Heinrich Schepp.28 They are among the earliest examples of Neo-Classicism in Dutch numismatic art.2' It is against this theoretical and practical background that the Boerhaave memorial should be viewed. Five years before writing his Lettre sur la sculpture he put the lessons of his aesthetic into practice in this memorial, and various passages in the treatise consequently appear to be directly related or applicable to it. In addition, the vase shape of the urn closely matches the original vase that Hemsterhuis drew to illustrate his aesthetic ideas.30 Those similarities show that the philosopher had already unites and circumscribes every part of the most perfect Nature, and the ideal beauties in the figures of the Greeks; or rather, contains them both"). 25 Hemsterhuis 2001, op. cit.

The vase in the printed Lettre is more ornately decorated and has a spout.</page><page sequence="8">FRITS SCHÖLTEN developed the nucleus of his ideas about form, contour and ornament by around 1760. the design: the vase as an early neo-classical theme Hemsterhuis was commissioned by Johanna Maria de Thoms-Boerhaave (1712-91) to design the me morial for her father around 1760. They must have known each other well, for Fran£ois's father, Tiberius Hem sterhuis, was a friend of the family. In 1746, moreover, Tiberius became one of the guardians of Johanna Maria's children after the death of her husband, the German ad venturer Frederic, Count de Thorns (1696-1746).31 The younger Hemsterhuis, with his interest in carved gem stones and other antiquities, would undoubtedly have been familiar with the collection of Greek and Roman ar tefacts that de Thorns had amassed on his travels, which were kept in his house on Rapenburg in Leiden and at his country estate Oud-Poelgeest in Oegstgeest until they were bought for the art cabinet of Stadholder Willem iv for 30,000 guilders in 1750-51.32 Fran?ois Hemsterhuis was appointed curator of that cabinet a few years later. Among the finest pieces in de Thoms's varied collection, which included sculpture, vases, bronzes, coins, medals and carved stones, were a large Hellenic amphora, which became known as the Stadholder Vase, and a Neo-Attic relief of Asklepios, the Greek demi-god of medicine, and his daughter Hygieia. It would have been only natural for Hemsterhuis, with his classical background, to have taken that Greek relief with its very apt medical scene as his source of inspiration for the Boerhaave memorial, but he did not do so.33 Instead he designed a strikingly restrained monu ment with little decoration. In fact, his design was noth ing more than a classical vase on a pedestal. The choice of such a plain memorial was prompted by Boerhaave's simple character and especially by his motto, "Simplic ity is the hallmark of truth," of which the sober memo rial appears to be the physical expression. This is what also struck the anonymous author in the Nederlandsche Jaerboeken when it was unveiled: "It is a marble urn or funerary vase standing on a pedestal or base of black stone matching the deceased professor's nature, whose motto was 'Simplicity is the hallmark of truth,' which is made with very great precision but without ostenta tious adornments."34 The last phrase is interesting. The fact that the lack of showy ornamentation was evidently considered unusual and innovative is hardly surprising, for Rococo, the ornamental style par excellence, was still flourishing around 1760. The Dutch Republic was still completely in thrall to a cosmopolitan, late Rococo in the 1760s and 70s, as shown by a silver coffee urn made in Amsterdam one year before the Boerhaave memorial (fig. 8).35 But in the light of Hemsterhuis's aesthetic ideas, which were still being formed at the time, the absence of such ornamentation that would disturb the simple con tour, is not surprising either. "The soul naturally wishes to have the greatest number of ideas in the shortest time possible, and we owe decoration to that, for if that was not the case every decoration would be a useless adjunct, offensive to custom, common sense and nature."36 How ever, ornamentation was not taboo to Hemsterhuis.

Amsterdam, Rijksmuseum decoration of the vase is treated as a fully fledged part of his aesthetic in the Lettre, and that made him extreme ly important for the emancipation of the ornament.37 Provided it is applied judiciously and harmoniously, ornamentation can reinforce the experience of beauty, because it helps to concentrate the eye on the form. It was in that measured way that Hemsterhuis applied the ornamentation on the Boerhaave memorial. Elsewhere he formulated this idea as follows, not in relation to an object but to a figure. "If the unity and simplicity of the subject and the effortless and delicate quality of the entire contour are thus the basic principles of sculpture, the sculptor will have to represent just a single figure if he wishes to achieve the greatest perfec tion in his art in the simplest way possible. It will have to be beautiful, almost at rest and in a natural pose, it will have to be rendered elegantly, and erected in such a way that I see as many different parts of the body as is possible at the same time.... And in order to make the contrast even more striking the artist must add part of a column, or a vase, or a pedestal, the regularity of which will bring out the beautiful irregularity of the fig ure even better."38 Put briefly, if the sculptor wishes to achieve the greatest perfection in his art he must remain faithful to the basic principles of sculpture and aim for unity and simplicity of subject and flowing contours. It is true that Hemsterhuis did not opt for a human figure for the Boerhaave memorial but for the vase as the abstraction of a figure and as the most fundamental form of beauty and truth.19 Vases had been metaphors of the human figure or form since classical times. Cic ero, for example, likened the vase to the human body, and women's bodies are compared to vases in Agnolo Firenzuola's Dialogo delle bellezze delle donne of 1548.40 In addition, the terms used for the various parts of a vase—foot, belly, shoulders, neck—are derived from human anatomy. Hemsterhuis also placed the desired emphasis on the main form by combining the flowing, round shape of a white marble vase with the sharpness of a rectangular, black marble pedestal. As well as perceptual and aesthetic considerations of this kind, Hemsterhuis's idea of an autonomous vase on a pedestal was also inspired by examples from classical antiquity, the Roman tomb altar and the classical funer ary urn or tomb vase—objects which did not yet exist 37 Sonderen, op. cit. (note 18), pp. 77-81. 38 Hemsterhuis, op. cit. (note 18), pp. 520, 522: "Si done l'unité ou la simplicité du sujet, et la qualité facile et déliée du contour total sont des principes fondamentales en sculpture, il faudra que le sculpteur, lorsqu'il veut parvenir le plus facile ment á la plus grande perfection dans son art, représente une seule figure. II faudra qu'elle soit belle, presqu'en repos, dans une attitude naturelle; qu'elle se présente avec grace; qu'elle soit tournée de fafon que je voie partout autant de différentes parties de son corps qu'il est possible en méme temps.... et pour rendre le contraste plus frappant encore, que Partiste y joigne quelque piece de colonne, ou de vase, ou de piédestal, dont la régularité fasse encore plus paraitre la belle irrégularité de la figure" (from Hemsterhuis 2001, op. cit. (note 18), pp. 521, 523). 39 On the vase as an abstract entity see H. Ottomeyer, "The metamorphosis of the Neo-Classical vase," in H.J. McCormick and H. Ottomeyer, Vasemania: Neoclassical form and ornament in Europe, New York, New Haven &amp; London 2004, pp. 15-29, esp. p. 15. Cicero had likened the vase to the human body in his Tusculanae disputationes, 22:50: "Nam corpus quidem quasi vas est, aut aliquod animi receptaculum" ("For the body is like a vase and like the vessel of the soul"). Hemsterhuis spoke of the vase as the essence of beauty and truth in a letter to Diotima in 1783; see Sonderen, op. cit. (note 18), p. 41. 40 Van den Akker, op. cit.

Cav. Giorgio Grenville, etching, 1769 or later. Amsterdam, Rijksmuseum in combination as a funerary monument. That combina tion was a Renaissance invention and was actually based on a misunderstanding.41 There was a revival of this type of tomb in the eighteenth century, partly due to the prints from the series Vasi candelabri cippi of 1768-78 by Giovanni Battista Piranesi (1720-78), in which vases are regularly depicted on funerary altars, which did not originally belong with them (fig. 9).42 Hemsterhuis, though, was well ahead of Piranesi with his Boerhaave design, which made him one of the first and certainly the most radical individuals in the eighteenth century to make a vase an autonomous part of a funerary monu ment, breathing new life into this old visual form.43 Sim ilar types are only found in England, for example in a group of neo-Roman memorials from the 1730s and 40s by sculptors like Henry Cheere, Michael Rysbrack and Peter Scheemakers. Although strictly speaking they can be regarded as forerunners of the Boerhaave memorial, one wonders whether Hemsterhuis, who never visited England, was even aware of them. It is true that those sculptors made the tomb vase the central element, but it was never as isolated as it is in the Boerhaave memo rial.44 The elegiac poet William Shenstone had a similar preference for the tomb vase. He turned his garden, the Leasowes, literally and poetically into a new Arcadia in which classical urns were installed to commemorate dead friends. A vignette accompanying "Elegy I" in the posthumous edition of Shenstone's poems shows a vase on a pedestal in a wood (fig. 10).45 However, his elegiac landscape with tomb vases only became a widespread 41 P.A. Mennesheimer, Das klassizistische Grabmal: eine Ty pologie, Bonn 1969, pp. 104, 105, refers to Pierre Bontemps's urn for the heart of Francois 1 in the abbey church of St Denis (c. 1550) as an early example of a combined vase and tomb altar. Another early source is the Hypnerotomachia Poliphili (Venice 1499), which contains several examples of all'antica vases on altars; see Francesco Colonna, Hypnerotomachia Poliphili, ed. and trans. J. Godwin, London 1999, figs, on pp. 253, 259. It is worth noting in passing that the Leiden art collector Pieter de la Court, in his Byzondere aenmerkingen wegens het aanleggen van pragtige en gemeene landhuizen, lusthoven, plantagien en aen klevende cieraden, Leiden 1737 (2nd ed. Amsterdam 1763), pp. 13, 14, came up with the odd idea that garden vases originated in classical cinerary urns or funerary caskets, and Hemsterhuis may well have known about his idea. See C.W.

Although the etchings were not published in book form until 1778, they were available as indi vidual prints in the preceding decade. 43 See, for example, W. Altmann, Die römischen Grabaltäre der Kaiserzeit, Berlin 1905; Mennesheimer, op. cit. (note 41), pp. 104-13. The earliest examples of such Neo-Classicist tomb altars mentioned by Mannesheimer date from the late 1760s. One forerunner is Grinling Gibbons's monument for Admiral George Churchill (c. 1710) on the wall of the south choir aisle in Westminster Abbey, which has an urn as its central motif; see G.

In this "mood landscape" Husly built a small island in a long winding lake where, among the weeping willows, spruces and poplars, he planned to install "a vase, urn or tomb," or a "small pyramid on a pedestal" with an inscription along the lines of "to laura, to Phyllis, or something similar."48 In the end the choice fell on a vase, which still survives, and which with its ovoid shape, sober decoration and funerary as sociations recalls Hemsterhuis's Boerhaave monument. With his radical and early vase memorial, Hemster huis was in the vanguard of the "goüt grec" in 1760-62, a new stylistic movement that arose in Rome and above all Paris in the 1750s and flourished in France in the following decade.49 The classical vase, in all sorts of vari ants, became a central motif of the new fashion.50 From around 1770, when the "Greek taste" made way for the Etruscan variety, the vase actually became a cultural icon, one of the most important and popular motifs of Neo-Classicism.51 It is only logical to assume that Hemsterhuis, with his position at the stadholder's court and contacts with lead ing diplomats in The Hague, soon became aware of this new taste in Paris, which was so closely related to his own fascination with classical antiquity in general and vase forms in particular. The modern and innovative nature of his design is well illustrated by the fact that the earliest known Neo-Classicist vase from the Sévres factory, which was one of the main disseminators of the Greek taste, was made in 1761, only one year before the completion of the Boerhaave memorial.52 One of the driving forces behind the stylistic reform at Sevres was the sculptor Etienne-Maurice Falconet, who was direc tor of the modeling department at the factory between 1757 and 1766.53 He and Hemsterhuis got to know each other well around 1779-81, when the sculptor spent several years in the Republic.54 The "funerary vase" that Hemsterhuis designed for 46 Ibid., pp. 199-209; E.

On the one hand it reflects his knowledge of international trends in taste, while on the other hand it is an expression of a highly personal fascination with the vase form which, as already noted, was to play a key role several years later in his Lettre sur la sculp ture to illustrate the principles of his theories of percep tion and aesthetics. This also emerges from a passage in Björnstähl's travel journal of a decade later. "In ad dition to this rare collection of ivory works of art we saw at Mr Hemsterhuis's house various excellent vases that resemble the Etruscan. They were made in Eng land in a factory where antiques are actually made and which is under the protection of milord Besbury and the Duke of Grafton. Judging by their outward appearance one would take them for Etruscan vases, but they are heavier. Mr Hemsterhuis observed that he had never seen vases with really attractive feet, not even among the antiques, but that the Etruscan were the best in this re spect."55 Those vases came from the pottery founded by Josiah Wedgwood, whose ceramics were widely available in the Netherlands from the early 1760s and were also bought in Hemsterhuis's circle.56 His approval of the Wedgwood bases is understandable, because they were inspired by a philosophy that he shared: restraint, utility and above all no unnecessary decoration.57 Conversely, Hemsterhuis's ideas about the ideal vase form did not pass unremarked in England, for in 1786 he was actually asked to supply Wedgwood with vase designs "suivant ma théorie."58 "Antique vases of black porcelain or arti ficial basalts" and "Painted Etruscan vases, pateras &amp;c." are listed as separate categories in a Dutch Wedgwood product catalogue of 1778. They were copies after old Etruscan vessels, many of them from the collection of William Hamilton, the British ambassador in Naples, which was housed in the British Museum. The cata logue description stresses the "precision of their con tours and the simplicity of their antique models," which is strikingly similar to the description of the Boerhaave memorial in the 1762 JaerboekenP Six faces The oddest feature of the Boerhaave monu ment is undoubtedly the six heads encircling the vase in high relief and linked together by a drapery. Seen from the front, facing the inscription, and moving clockwise 55 Björnstuhls Reize, cit.

Leiden, Museum de Lakenhai they are of a middle-aged man, a child, a youth, an old man, and a young and an old woman. Although the faces are undeniably individualized and portrait-like, that does not necessarily mean that Hemsterhuis deliberately based them on specific individuals or intended to de pict patients of Boerhaave, as has been assumed.60 The faces should be seen far more as due to an interest in physiognomy, which he shared with Petrus Camper (fig. 4), whose comparative studies on the evolution of the human face were very influential. Camper was particu larly interested in art theory, which he approached from his medical background through anatomy, the theory of proportions and physiognomy. His main interest was in drawing and sculpture, and like Hemsterhuis he sculpt ed himself, and the pair of them designed medals.61 It can be seen from a self-portrait and several undated clay studies of faces that Camper was a creditable modeler.62 The facial expression on the head of an old man recalls several of the faces on the Boerhaave memorial (fig. n), and the outstretched pose gives it a similar emphasis on the profile. Camper's influence is also evident in the heavily furrowed brows of the faces on the vase, which give them almost ideal proportions according to his classification of human profiles. The same applies, for that matter, to the profile portrait of Boerhaave on the pedestal. Evidence that Hemsterhuis was familiar with Camper's theory of facial proportions, which he first wrote about in 1767 but had formulated well before then, is provided by the foreword to Camper's posthu mous publication on the subject.63 Formally speaking, Hemsterhuis's addition of the faces to the vase was part of a long decorative tradi tion, for heads, masks and animal heads very regularly feature on vases. They are particularly common in the many print series with vase designs published from the sixteenth century on.64 Such engraved designs would have served Hemsterhuis as direct models or sources of inspiration. Reference has previously been made in this respect to the designs that James Gibbs published in 1728 in his influential Book of architecture containing de signs of buildings and ornaments.65 Gibbs's design of a vase adorned with faces linked by garlands is certainly closely related to the way Hemsterhuis employed the motif in Leiden, but there are enough other examples to suggest that there was not just one single source of inspiration. For example, the series of vase designs published in 1746 by the sculptor Jacques-Fran5ois Saly (1717-76), one of the trailblazers for the Greek taste, includes one that is very close to Hemsterhuis's in both form and type and also has a frieze of faces on the belly (fig. 12).66 Closer to home, ironically enough in Boerhaave's own herbarium, Hemsterhuis could have seen an engraved vase after a design by Filips van der Mij that is decorated with a frieze of satyrs' heads surrounded by garlands of foliage. Although the form of that vase and its decoration would 60 Lunsingh Scheurleer, op. cit. (note 6), p. 114. 61 Staring, op. cit. (note 28); Scharloo, op. cit. (note 18), pp. 99-10.

According to the Nederlandsche jfaerboeken, the six faces represent the ages of man. "Below the edge of the funerary vase one sees six heads linked with draperies or pleated cloths that depict the four stages of human life: Childhood, Youth in both male and female forms, Maturity and Old Age, once again in male and female forms, to dem onstrate that he in whose honor this memorial has been erected devoted his art to both sexes and brought men and women his health-giving assistance."69 If the six stand for the cycle of human life, and death is implicitly 67 T.H.

All in all, though, there is no question of a traditional, contiguous allegory of the ages of man, because not only did Hemsterhuis mix up men and women of different ages but there is also no clear chronological sequence to the heads. Lunsingh Scheurleer suggested, partly on the evidence of the individualized features and the descrip tion in the Nederlandsche Jaerboeken, that they repre sented patients of Boerhaave's and that between them they symbolized their thanks for his work as a doctor, but there is insufficient evidence to support that reading.71 The suggestion that some of them were portraits of Boer haave himself was rightly dismissed.72 Nor, though, did Hemsterhuis intend them purely as decoration, because that would have been completely at odds with his ideas about beauty, simplicity of contour and ornamentation. So given their prominent and striking positions on the vase, the six heads must make an essential contribution to the import of the memorial, an import that may extend beyond the iconography of man's ages. The fantastic and unnatural idea of linking human faces of different ages or sexes was part of a long and varied tradition that had nothing to do with vase decora tion but which in several cases is charged with vanitas symbolism and alludes to the different stages of human life. For example, there are late medieval trinkets, main ly from Flanders, of double and triple heads of ivory or wood that were attached to a rosary, worn as pendants or formed the finial of a staff. Some combine the head of a man and a woman, while others depict a half-rotted face or were combined with a skull, and were thus ex plicitly intended to be memento mori.11 The concept of polycephaly, sometimes in the guise of Janus but cer tainly in other iconographic formulae as well, was not uncommon in sculptures, medals and carved stones in antiquity and the Renaissance.74 The main form is the triple-headed allegory of Prudentia and her deriva tives, such as Hecate.7S The triad of the stages of human 71 Lunsingh Scheurleer, op. cit.

New York, Metropolitan Museum of Art, Lehman Collection life—the old, mature and young face—was expanded in the middle ages.76 In the case of Prudentia they corre spond to memoria, intelligentia and Providentia. The fu sion of the tradition of the main stages in a person's life with the iconography of Prudentia took place under the influence of scholastic moral theology, as Panofsky dem onstrated in such detail.77 One of the earliest examples occurs in a Neapolitan miniature of c. 1340 of Robert the Wise of Anjou surrounded by eight virtues, among them the triple-headed Prudentia.78 The first depictions of that figure in Italian sculpture date from the same pe riod, such as a relief on the campanile of the cathedral in Florence, in a marble fragment of a tomb or pulpit (fig. 18),79 and in the floor of the Duomo in Siena.80 These are elaborations of the triple-headed caryatids by Nicola Pisano and Arnolfo di Cambio for Pistoia and Bologna.81 The vase of the Boerhaave memorial has a similar distribution of the faces over present, past and future, or intelligentia, memoria and Providentia respectively.82 On the front, naturally, is the face of a middle-aged man de noting the present. He establishes a direct link with the viewer, who inhabits the present. Here Hemsterhuis did not depart from the visual tradition of the triple-headed stages of life, which usually accorded a central position to middle age, as in Titian's famous Allegory of Pru dence, for example. Time shifts three times as one moves around the memorial: from the future (represented by both a small boy and an adolescent) to the past (the old man), then to the future again (the young woman) and 75 For Hecate see H.

The past and the future thus flank the present, as it were.83 That in itself is a clear indication that when he designed the me morial Hemsterhuis must also have been thinking of the association with the Prudentia iconography of present, past and future (intelligentia, memoria and Providentia), although that is not confirmed by the sources.84 An im plicit connotation of the six heads as a symbol of the virtue of Prudentia would of course have been a very fitting iconography for the tomb of one of the nation's most important scholars. And there is more that argues for such an interpretation. According to Pierio Valeriano in his Hieroglyphica (ed. princ. Basel 1556, reprint Frankfurt 1678), Hip pocrates, the classical physician and an important pre decessor of Boerhaave, argued that a doctor united the three aspects of wisdom in himself—memoria, intelligen tia and Providentia — because he "knows all that is, that was and that will be."85 In the same breath Valeriano also mentions the snake as the symbol of Prudentia, and that is the very animal that Hemsterhuis incorporated in the memorial, coiled around the medallion portrait or Boerhaave on the pedestal (fig. 19). There, of course, it is primarily an allusion to the snake on the staff of Asklepios, the classical symbol of the medical profes sion, but at the same time it bolsters the vase's asso ciation with Prudentia. Given Hemsterhuis's interest in and study of old and often cryptic iconographies, it is very likely that he was familiar with Valeriano's "Bible of the new hieroglyphic science of images."86 conclusion The influence of Hemsterhuis's design was limited. Apart from a few engravings and a drawing there is only one case of direct imitation,87 and that is the memorial that was erected in or shortly after 1771 for Cornelis van Heemskerck (1724-83), a lawyer at the Court of Holland, in the Dutch Reformed Church in Scheveningen (fig. 20).88 Given its close resemblance to 83 It is not clear why the future features three times and the past only twice, but it is probably due to the (seemingly super fluous) insertion of the child's face to the left of "the present." It suggests that Hemsterhuis was trying to achieve a balanced distribution over the belly of the vase and needed six heads in order to do so. The addition of the child's face made that pos sible without disturbing the thematic balance too much. It did result in "the present" on the front being flanked by an old woman and a young boy. 84 It is not so surprising that the Mercurius and the Jaer boeken only mention the obvious meaning of the heads as being the ages of man in their accounts of the memorial, for neither one seems to have got in touch with Hemsterhuis, whom they even fail to mention as the inventor and designer of the monu ment. 85 Quoted in Panofsky, Hercules, cit. (note 77), p. 25, and in Panofsky, "Titian's Allegory" cit. (note 77), p. 197. 86 It was Panofsky, in Hercules, cit. (note 77), p. 25, who spoke of "die Bibel der neuen hieroglyphischen Bilderlehre." See I. Wardropper, European sculpture, 1400-1 goo in the Met ropolitan Museum of Art, New York, New Haven &amp; London 2011, pp. 31-33 and fig. 11, for two majolica tondi by Luca and Andrea della Robbia of a double-headed Prudentia with an Asklepios-like snake (third quarter fifteenth century). 87 In 1762 an engraving by A. Delfos was included in vol. i of G. van Swieten's Aphorismen van Boerhaave, Leiden 1762, and in 1772 J.H. Müntz made a drawing of the memorial using a special measuring system; see Lunsingh Scheurleer, op. cit. (note 6), pp. 107, 108, figs. 38, 39. There is also an undated en graving of "Boerhaave's tomb" by P.H. Jonxis. 88 On 22 March 1769 Cornelis van Heemskerck bought three graves in the church on which a tomb was to be erected (The Hague City Archives, Notarial Archive, nr. 3767, deed nr. 262, notary Boudewijn de Wit).

Scheveningen, Dutch Reformed Church the one for Boerhaave it can be assumed that it, too, was supplied by Wapperom. The main difference from Hemsterhuis's design is the reduction of the number of faces from six to four. Some of them also differ from those on Boerhaave's memorial, and the detailing of the vase is a little more refined. It is not known why van Heemskerck ordered a copy of the Boerhaave memo rial. It is true that he lived in The Hague, in Lange Voorhout, but there are no indications that he belonged to Hemsterhuis's circle. The latter designed two further memorials, for the Münster philosopher Johann Georg Hamann and for Anna Maria Boreel, the widow of his good friend Franfois Fagel. Hemsterhuis visited Prin cess Gallitzin in Münster soon after Hamann was buried in her garden there in 1788, and designed a memorial at her request. It took the form of a wreathed vase on two cube-shaped blocks of stone. In 1851 it was transferred to the Ueberwasserfriedhof, and since it was evidently in poor condition it was replaced by an identical copy.89 Anna Maria Boreel died in Pyrmont in 1781, and the de sign for her memorial is said to have been commissioned by the Fürst zu Waldeck-Pyrmont. Unfortunately, it can no longer be traced.90 Hemsterhuis was also asked to design the memorial for the lawyer and bibliophile Gerard Meerman (1722-71) in St Peter's in Leiden, but he turned the request down, as did the antiquary Jo hann Friedrich Reiffenstein, whom Meerman's son ap proached in Rome. The memorial that was ultimately erected was designed by the lawyer, sinologist, antiquar ian and collector Jean Theodore Royer (1737-1807) and took the form of an obelisk on a pedestal adorned with a portrait medallion and topped with a small urn.91 In its austerity and choice of motifs it was fully in accord with the prevailing Neo-Classicist taste, but it had little in common with the innovative, radical nature of the Boerhaave memorial erected in the same church more than 20 years previously. RIJKSMUSEUM AMSTERDAM Magdalena de Brueys (1707-71) of The Hague was interred in the grave, followed in 1790 by her widower Jean Francois Fabre (1708-90). Both may have been servants of van Heemskerck, for Antonio Lopez Diaz Suasso de Fonseca states in his La Haye par un habitant, 2 vols., The Hague 1857, vol. 1, p. 75, that "in his true spirit of equality this great individual, who was ahead of his time, had himself buried with his domestic servant, and some actually say two of them; a broad-minded occurrence that is mentioned in the epitaph" ("Dans son veritable esprit d'égalité, ce grand personnage qui devan9ait son siécle s'y enterrer avec son domestique, quelgues uns prétendent méme avec deux; évé nement liberal, dont l'epitaphe fait mention"). Van Heemskerck made a will on 8 June 1777 in which he reserved two of the three graves for his nephews Jean Henry van Heemskerck and Jean Henry de Villates (The Hague City Archives, Notarial Archive, nr. 4029, deed nr. 371). 89 On this see K.
