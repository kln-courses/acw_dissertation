Stein 552 With the ending of the school year, adults will be encouraging children to join various book clubs at libraries and com- munity centers. Do we want youngsters to keep busy, to learn, or just to have a good time? In his Fragments, Epicurus writes: ". . . pleasure goes hand in hand with knowledge; for enjoyment does not follow comprehension, but comprehension and enjoyment are simultaneous." What do you think? A plus (+) marks superior books, while a minus (-) designates titles which do not meet literary or artistic criteria. Happy summer and happy reading! Language Arts • Vol. 57, No. 5 • May 1980</page><page sequence="2">Picture Story Books Charlotte &amp; Charles by Ann Tompert, ill. by John Wallner. Crown, 1979. 32 pp. Reinforced binding, $8.95. Two people-loving giants decide to give human beings a second chance at being friends after one disastrous experience. An unusual story of suspicion and trust voices the sentiment that ". . . people would be different, and . . . things could be different too." Text may be difficult to read on the blue pages which alternate with the white. The lesson in prejudice takes a twist, as giants are threatened by the smaller humans. ч-Diana and Her Rhinoceros by Edward Ardizzone. Oxford, 1979. 32 pp. $8.95. Sensible Diana nurses an escaped rhinoceros back to health, then keeps it. Young readers follow the aging of both child and animal in a delightful reissue of an out-of-print book. Watercolor full-page pictures and crosshatched black/white drawings create a middle-class family in Richmond, Surrey, England. Fly Home, McDoo by Gillian McClure. Deutsch, 1980. 32 pp. $6.95. A racing pigeon decides home is best after experiencing some hair-raising events in the jungle. Blues and greens dominate in doublespreads of the cold and hot lands from the bird's perspective. Color separations really convey the indus- trial landscape of Glasgow. To be read to or by the primary grades. + Monty by James Stevenson. Green- willow, 1979. 32 pp. $7.95. Again, using a brilliant-colored format, Stevenson tells a simple story full of ac- tion and fun. A rabbit, duck, and frog learn to appreciate Monty the Alligator after he goes on "vacation" from ferrying the com- plaining animals across the river. Pastel colors suit the cartoons. Appropriate for the youngest child. + One-Eyed Jake by Pat Hutchins. Greenwillow, 1979. 32 pp. $7.95. Another of Hutchins' wacky stories in words and pictures. This time a greedy pi- rate plunders one ship too many, bringing about his own demise, and thereby satis- fying his mistreated crew's ambitions. Gaudy colors in doublespread illustra- tions match an extravagant tale. +The Spider Makes a Web by Joan M. Lexau, ill. byArabelle Wheatley. Hastings, 1979. 40 pp. $5.95. In cadenced prose matching the spi- der's rhythm, the author describes how a young Shamrock spider spins her web, and waits for mate, eggs, and young spi- ders to make a life of their own. Concepts are explained so that inexperienced readers can understand the life-support system and the ending and beginning of a spider's life. Delicately colored, fine- drawn illustrations match the precise writ- ing. A good introductory book on nature. The Spider Makes a Web- photo courtesy of Hastings Complete Version of Ye Three Blind Mice by John W. Ivimey, ill. by Walton Corbould. Warne, 1979. 34 pp. $6.95. A brightly decorated reissue of a 1904 publication brings to modern children the before and after of a traditional verse in which the three blind mice meet the Farmer's Wife's carving knife. A well- designed book contains repetitions to please youngsters and to drive adult Book reMarks: A Personal View of Current Juvenile Literature 553</page><page sequence="3">readers wild. The mice dress in turn-of- the-century clothes, making for them- selves a happy ending. The 329th Friend by Marjorie Weinman Sharmat, ill. by Cyndy Szekeres. Four Winds, 1979. 46 pp. Reinforced binding, $8.95. Bored with his own company, Emery Raccoon invites 328 guests to lunch, but finds that none of them has time to listen to him. Lists of guests, tasks, and arithmet- ical computations lead the reader into guessing the identity of the last guest in an amusing story of self-identity for the primary grades. Full-page colored draw- ings are from the small animals' perspec- tive. -Hans Christian Andersen's Thum- belina, retold by Amy Ehrlich, ill. by Susan Jeffers. Dial, 1979. 32 pp. $9.95. Hans Christian Andersen has to be "re- told"? And if so, is it Hans Christian An- dersen any longer? Jeffers' stunning close-up look at Thumbelina's world stresses color, line, and arrangement. The beautiful illustrations are necessary, but cannot compensate for lack of details and missing literary descriptions. This over- sized attractive volume will sell. A good waste of art. Tilly's House, written and ill. by Faith Jaques. A Margaret K. McElderry Book. Atheneum, 1979. 32 pp. Reinforced bind- ing, $9.95. In a look at the normal world from a doll-size point of view, Tilly leaves the dollhouse where she works as a kitchen maid to find a home of her own. Lovely framed full-color pictures retain the effect of the original watercolor paintings. De- tails in text and illustration provide satis- faction in a Borrower- type story. -i-The Wild Washerwomen by John Yeoman, ill. by Quentin Blake. Green- willow, 1979. 32 pp. $8.95. 554 Two British contemporaries provide a farcical new "folk-tale" about seven washerwomen. Sick of their work, they go on an uncontrollable rampage, only to meet their match in seven very dirty woodcutters. The action-filled romp is as funny in word as it is in line drawings on wash. Primary graders will take to these seven liberated brides. -i-The Wounded Duck by Peter Barnhart, ill. by Adrienne Adams. Scribner's, 1979. 32 pp. Reinforced binding, $9.95. Adams' wonderful full-color portrayal of the natural world in cold and dark un- derscores a moving story of love and loy- alty between an old woman and the duck she rescues. Earthy expressive conversa- tion transmits the emotion that begins be- fore the incidents related here. Compare the theme with the more stylized The Happy Prince. Realistic Fiction ... for the middle grades +The Battle of Bubble and Squeak by Philippa Pearce, ill. by Alan Baker. Deutsch, 1979. 88 pp. $5.95. Bubble and Squeak are two gerbils the Parker children sneak into the house and hope to keep, despite opposition from their mother. A renowned British author manages to invest even the most normal incident with the high emotions children bring to them. The suspenseful chapter in which the cat stalks the pets will keep adults on the edge of their seats, even if they are not animal lovers. Black/white il- lustrations flesh out characters. The Day the Sea Rolled Back by Mickey Spillane. Windmill/Dutton, 1979. 138 pp. $7.95. Spillane's first novel for young readers is similar to his adult books - long on plot Language Arts</page><page sequence="4">and short on much else. Still, children will keep turning the pages of this one, as twelve-year-old Larry Damar and his friend uncover a sunken treasure in the Caribbean area when unusual tidal condi- tions bare the sea bed. Despite two- dimensional characters and a contrived ending, the story moves and the tropics come alive through attention to back- ground. + Dvora 's Journey by Marge Blaine, ill. by Gabriel Lisowski. Holt, Rinehart and Winston, 1979. 126 pp. $6.95. Twelve-year-old Dvora recounts the un- expected problems her family faces as it leaves Russia for America in 1904. While other books have shown the reasons for the emigration, this one concentrates on the flight itself, portraying the difficulties in stealing the border, vulnerability to thieves, and kindness shown by others so that nine and ten-year-olds can read and understand. They will identify with Dvora, her friend Naomi, and the other members of the family on each step of the journey, until the boat is reached that will take some of them to the Golden Land. A sequel is clearly called for. Felita, ill. by Ray Cruz. Dial, 1979. 112 pp. $6.95. In a first-person narration, 81/2-year-old Felita shares happy and unhappy experi- ences in and out of her Puerto Rican community. Some are universal, while others are special to her. The understand- ing and loving grandmother, Abuelita, is the book's outstanding character. Use of lines makes for expressive pen-and-ink il- lustrations. Not as strong as Mohr's books for older readers, but closeness of family and community provides the link for em- pathy. The Lucky Stone by Lucille Clifton, ill. by Dale Payson. Delacorte, 1979. 64 pp. $6.95. Tee recalls the stories her great grand- mother told her, especially about a stone that brought good luck to the different generations. It's a story-within-a-story going back to slavery and concluding with Tee's acquiring the good-luck token. Under Clifton's mastery with dialect and language, each voice retains its individu- ality. Pencil drawings catch the spirit of the story. +Yours Till Niagara Falls, Abby by Jane O'Connor, ill. by Margot Apple. Hastings, 1979. 128 pp. $6.95. Spunky, wise-cracking Abby Kimmel, at Camp Pinecrest for the wrong reasons, learns about persistence and friendship from the unlikeliest person in the most un- expected manner. Bunk mates, coun- selors, and Aunt Tilly, the camp director, are human beings, not caricatures. Humor comes from believeable personalities and situations. A hilarious first novel reveals characters through Abby's letters back home and the third-person narration. A funny and honest look at camp life for all girls - campers and non-campers alike. Don't let the black-white illustrations put you off. Yours Till Niagara Falls, Abby- photo courtesy of Hastings Book reMarks: A Personal View of Current Juvenile Literature 555</page><page sequence="5">... for the upper grades + Cave of the Moving Shadows by Thomas Millstead. Dial, 1979. 218 pp. $7.95. Kimba's training to be a sorcerer con- flicts with his desire to hunt in a story for mature readers entranced by the Ice Age and the people who lived four hundred centuries ago. Rivalry, cave paintings, and extinct animals form part of the back- ground of the Cro-Magnon story of a twelve-year-old orphan. An illustrious first novel for young readers that features people not so very different from our- selves. Lacy Makes a Match by Patricia Beatty. Morrow, 1979. 223 pp. $7.95. As a matter of fact, Lacy marries off both of her adopted brothers, trying to find out her true heritage at the same time. While the convoluted and laugh-provoking plot will engross, it is Beatty's usual attention to historical details that authenticates a delightful period-piece. The thirteen- year-old heroine is in her element in the 1893 mining town where she lives, and in San Francisco where she visits the den- tist - an unforgettable vignette. Path of the Orange Peels: Adventures in the Early Days of Tel Aviv by Nahum Gutman, trans, by Nelly Segal, ill. by Nahum Gutman. Dodd, Mead, 1979. 140 pp. $7.95. During World War I as the British and the Turks fight for control of Palestine, a fifteen-year-old Jewish youth becomes unwittingly involved in a dangerous and important spying mission, in which orange peels are a clue. Never mind the tortuous aspects of the plot. The strength of this first-person narrative lies in the characters the hero encounters and describes, and the love with which he brings alive the city that grew out of sand dunes, Old Tel Aviv. A too-literal translation increases the read- ing difficulties of a rambling story that di- gresses every other page. Readers who persevere will be rewarded, as they slowly find themselves absorbed in Nahum's story. Grey photographs and naive black/white drawings are just right for a story set in the past. Path of the Orange Peels: Adventures in the Early Days of Tel Aviv- photo courtesy of Dodd, Mead + Presto or the Adventures of a Turnspit Dog, written and ill. by Marilyn- nek K. Roach. Houghton-Mifflin, 1979. 148 pp. $7.95. A small dog's fictional adventures with the street performers and dog gangs of eighteenth-century London just skim the melodramatic in a close and factual look at England in 1760 from the Twelve Days of Christmas to the May Day ceremonies. As Presto meets pickpockets, ratcatchers, an educated pig, and a ghost cat, the reader acquires an understanding of the times. Narrated in the third person from the talking animal's point of view, the story is a realistic one, despite the gimmick of quasi-anthropomorphic beasts. Chapter headings and the very meat of the book reflect the style and times of the period depicted. Satirization of seamier aspects makes this more suitable for students than for adults. 556 Language Arts</page><page sequence="6">Sandy and the Rock Star by Walt Morey. Dutton, 1979. 171 pp. $7.95. While written as a treatise against some aspects of hunting, the theme never gets in the way of a young singing star's at- tempts to control his life. When fifteen- year-old Paul Winters tries to free himself from his overly protective parents, he finds himself on a remote island where he be- friends a tame but frightened cougar that Paul decides to protect from a vicious hunter. Morey makes things happen on every page, so that the reader is too caught up to question the credibility of events. The author's first book in years is a survival story with a twist, one whose end- ing is sure to disappoint readers involved with the amiable cat. Toby Alone by Robbie Branscum. Doubleday, 1979. 118 pp. $7.95. In the second of a trilogy based on the author's own life in the Arkansas hills, adolescent Toby tries to keep her beloved Granny from dying, almost losing the af- fections of both her dog and her promised love, Johnny Joe. The first-person narra- tion in hill-country dialect accents Toby's grief and earthy humor. As in the first book, it is Granny, who ". . . always looked spry and her face was the color of an apple left hanging on the tree till after the frost," who will stick in the mind after the book is closed. Toby's marriage during World War II concludes the series. Fanciful Literature ... for the middle grades +The Birthday of the Infanta by Oscar Wilde, ill. by Leonard Lubin. Viking, 1979. 55 pp. $7.95. Like the others of Wilde's literary fairy tales, this, too, can be appreciated by fourth graders, even as it appeals to all. The icy story of a grotesque dwarf who falls in love with the beautiful Infanta on her birthday will move readers and listen- ers alike, especially in the scene of the dwarf's encounter with a mirror. Youngsters exposed to modern purple prose can benefit from the subtly depicted inhumanity of the Spanish court. The dwarf's agony moves to tears. Sharply contrasting pen-and-ink drawings heighten the mood, with the Infanta seem- ingly patterned after Velasquez paintings. The Birthday of the Infanta- photo courtesy of Viking Castles in the Air and Other Tales by Stephen Krensky, ill. by Warren Lieber- man. Atheneum, 1979. 66 pp. $6.95. The title introduces some frothy fairy tales and indicates that the five stories interpret literally five clichés. "A Fine Ket- tle of Fish" isn't so fine by the time various classes of people stop fighting over it. The youngest brother outwits his siblings in "The Last Straw." "Too Clever for Words" demonstrates that silence is golden. "A Barrel of Fun" teaches some fuzzy morals, including the value of leisure time, while the title story finds a witch trying to get a king down to earth in more than one way. Cross-hatched pen-and-ink drawings ex- tend the characterizations. Book reMarks: A Personal View of Current Juvenile Literature 557</page><page sequence="7">Inside My Feet: The Story of a Giant by Richard Kennedy, ill. by Ronald Himler. Harper &amp; Row, 1979. 71 pp. $7.95. This is the kind of fantasy that appeals to adults, and is one that elders would like children to read. A young man recalls two nights of childhood terror when a giant uses magic boots to carry away his par- ents and himself. Using "plain business" against the enchantment, the boy suc- ceeds in saving them all, after figuring out where the giant's childhood went. A pecu- liar mixture of philosophy and blood- and-gore. Black and white pictures accen- tuate the fantastic. Soonie and the Dragon by Shirley Rous- seau Murphy, ill. by Susan Vaeth. Atheneum, 1979. 84 pp. $7.95. Left on her own, sixteen-year-old Soonie sets out to seek her fortune by singing, dancing, and telling stories. Her common sense aids her in rescuing three princesses stolen by a dragon. It's all an intricately developed game, with stories- within-stories, dialect, and a sad griffin and enchanted young man thrown in for good measure. Soonie's saga is similar to Agotha's in Baker's Save Sirrushany. Both heroines are determined, with one a little more practical and the other more star- struck. The black and white drawings al- most destroy a romantic mood. Pre- adolescents, especially the girls, will love this. The Talking Rock by Ruth Ainsworth, ill. by Joanna Stubbs. Deutsch, 1979. 154 pp. $6.95. Because he has been exposed to measles, young Jakes must stay with eld- erly friends of his parents until out of quarantine, when his family goes to Africa. His relationship with the older Splinters deepens, as does his involvement with the sandboy he has made out of pebbles, shells, and seaweed. Descriptive pas- sages of the sea accompany a literary exploration of the child's fantasy world, always from the child's point-of-view. Line drawings emphasize the duality of Jakes' world. This quiet book draws the reader into it, slowly but surely. ... for older readers Blood &amp; Roses by Bernice Grohskopf. Atheneum, 1979. 256 pp. $8.95. Upset by his mother's plans to remarry, fifteen-year-old Robinson meets the ghost of William Caxton and helps him find in Westminster Abbey a manuscript lost for centuries. It is as much a family tale as it is one of ghosts and time lapses, with not much coherent connection between them. For history buffs, Caxton's era is fascinat- ing, thanks to the author's knowledge of fifteenth-century England. Caxton's many explanatory speeches, though, are as dull as Rob claims them to be. Clever-Lazy: The Girl Who Invented Herself by Joan Bodger. An Argo Book. Atheneum, 1979. 201 pp. $8.95. "Far away, and on the other side of time ..." the author glues together a string of folk-like fairy tales, using the title charac- ter as the link. As she explores what could be China, her extraordinary adventures along the way put her in Pi ppi Longstock- ing's class. She invents fireworks, gun- powder and other "magical" articles. Mythical creatures, allegorical allusions, and mystic settings slow down the action. You read, put the book down, pick it up, and find it difficult to re-enter. An odd book, with certain segments reading well aloud. The Forever Formula by Frank Bon ham. Dutton, 1979. 181 pp. $8.50. Seventeen-year-old Evan Clark, a twentieth-century boy reawakened in the twenty-second century, not only has to ad- 558 Language Arts</page><page sequence="8">just to startling surroundings, he has to fight off a group's attempt to get at a longevity formula locked into his mind. Bonham's vision of the future intrigues, especially the implications of the en- visioned hyper-longevity. For Bonhan, the boy ". . . becomes a symbol of mankind trying to adapt to changes coming too fast for him." Amid the action, you will retain memories of the "happy Seniors" and of the nurse, Eliza, with whom Evan falls in love, despite her being a clone. A Woody Allenish look at the future. Time Piper by Delia Huddy. Greenwillow, 1979. 247 pp. $7.95. A beautiful and remotely fey village girl follows eighteen-year-old Luke when he leaves for London to work with the inventor of a revolutionary time machine. The nub of the story is the mystery of the girl's na- ture, and others like her. The last section of the book comes up with the answer, the clue to which is in the title. The supposi- tion on which the plot is based is falla- cious, and none of the scientific mumbo- jumbo can disguise it. Material for a good short story, but overextended in the novel form. Sci-fi fans will be interested, but disappointed. It takes a long time to see where the book, a British import, is head- ing.
