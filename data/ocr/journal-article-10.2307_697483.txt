As object of fateri, it = (I); as object of distulit, it = (2); cf. Livy 5, 8, 2, ' neglectum Anxuri prae- sidium vacationibus militum . . . pro- ditis repente portarum custodibus oppressum est ' (the defence having been neglected, the defendtzg force was over- whelmed); so perhaps Livy 4, 58, IO, ' duo praesidia occidione occisa et cum periculo retineri' (two defending forces had been slain, and the defended places were with difficulty retained. Moles occurs with a similar double signiEca- tion in Livy 5, I2, 7, ' Hoc statu mili- tarium rerum seditio intestina maiore mole coorta, quam bella tractabantur.' On this passage Weissenborn remarks, ' da moles sowohl einen grossen Gegen- stand, der bedeutende Kraftanstrengung erfordert wenn er bewaltigt werden soll (objektiv), als auch diese Kraftanstren- gung selbst (subjektiv) bezeichnen kann, so ist es in der ersten Bedeutung zu coorta' (vgl. 6s I4, I: ' maior domi exorta moles '), ' in der zweiten zu tractabantur zu nehmen' (S. I, 38, 5: ' maiore inde animo pacis opera incho- ata, quam quanta mole gesserat bella'). It is worth remarking that the mean- ing (I) of piacula is objective, while (Z) is subjective. There is a certain pictorial quality in the construction by which the crimes themselves have actually become the atonements in ' late death.' The change in meaning in ' commissa naturally follows that in ' piacula. E. W. CORNWALL. Zhe University of MeZbourne. ' PER,' DEN OTIN G TH E MAN N ER IN WHICH TIME IS SPENT.

PROFESSOR DRERUP is well known as the author of Omero, perhaps the best handbook to ' Homer,' in the widest sense of that term, that has been written. He now gives us a special study which, it may be said deliberately, makes most other monographs on individual parts of the Homeric epics seem surface- scratchings by comparison. The Efth Iliad has been chosen because it has been well battered and abused by the Higher Criticism. Refer- ence may be made it should be made before reading this work to Dr. Leaf's Introduction and notes or to Ameis- Hentze, or to Erhardt (Krtstallisations- process), or Naber (nzltae eaaque adtnodurn longae interpolationes).

It might contain some old poetry, but that had been altered, expanded and overlaid, and, in Mr. Andrew Lang's phrase, ' generally bedevilled.' The lay is there- fore an excellent corpus vile for a fresh experiment with the fapHafta eha of a more wholesome criticism. An introductory section, which gives a summary but pointedly discriminating review of recent phases and tendencies of Homeric criticism, is followed by a most searching and capable analysis of the lay. Here Dr. Drerup is as 'one strong man in a blatant land.' He goes steadily on his way, hardly glancing to right or left at the Missdextuxtgen of his many predecessors; but in an inferno of copious notes below the text he deals out castigation, impartial and unsparing, to all vvho have, as he expresses it, ' heard the fleas cough' in the Lay of Diomede. He does not disguise his contempt for the critical fads so popular in his own country. The old system of ' Interpolation-nosing ' combined with a ' leathern philology ' and ' paltry com positional suspicions '; the Ertgleisungen of the newer ' mythical - historical ' method (Sagenverschiebungen) which ' applies subjective beliefs and conjec- tures, and before which science is help- less ' (an aphorism about the gods and Dummheit being evidently in the writer's mind); and the newest resource of all, the free resort to old epics (even primitive Handbuchet and Htlfsbucher !) of which nothing is positively known and little can be surmised these are the objects of his special attention. For his own procedure he adopts the golden maxim of Belzner-der Dtchter gibt uns die Regelq? fisr sein Schaffen, nicht wir ihm. Treating Homer ' simply as a poet,' he makes it his object to trace out a pervading purpose, as incidents make scenes, scenes acts, and acts the finished rhapsody, and to ascertain the Technik or artistic means by which the poet accomplishes it. The result of this ' reasoned aesthetic ' is as start- ling as it well could be. The Diomedeia has absolute unity and perfect harmony of structure. Not a scene can be spared, nay, not a line, except one about which the tradition is shaky. About one other Dr. Drerup himself seems to be doubtful. The poet's object, pursued and realised 'with sovereign art,' is to glorify Diomede in an artsteia, which, beginning with an easy victory over a pair of priestlings and a 'blood-bath' among the Trojan Nebenfiguren, goes ors with Steigerung to the overthrow of Aeneas and Pandaros, the vrounding of Aphrodite and the hybris towards Apollo, and culminates in a Enal triumph, the discomISture of the God of War him- self. This organic whole is found to be worthy of a great poet, and in scheme and detail the veriest antithesis of the maimed and weather-beaten hulk which the Higher Criticism has left us. The analysis is followed by a Ruck blick und Ausblick, the Erst section of which is devoted to the setting of the lay in the l liad. The fifth book is prepared for in the fourth, and pre- supposes and is continued in the sixth. Another section deals with ' Homer's poetical technique,' which is also classi- Eed in the most complete detail in one of the Eve Indexes with which the volume is generously provided in addi- tion to a full summary of contents. The exposition of the Technik is the finest part of the work. Here are the Grund- lagen of a genuine criticism, which dis- covers for us much that has been over- looked or underrated, and emphasises for our beneISt the scholiast's sensible Gnd quite trochaic) remark, 7ro\XA eyag ^ t oc ^ 76t)&gt; XPq1ffffja6tl' ?qrevoov7es 7rapop#er.

Acknow- ledgment is freely made in this depart- ment of hints from Braun and Vossler, Kiene and Finsler, and Rothe and Belzner; but their contributions to the elucidation of the Homeric modus operandi are greatly extended and im- proved upon, with eminently satisfactory effect on the reader, who ts 'glad to</page><page sequence="3">THE CLASSICAL REVIEW 232 know the large air again,' after years of Calypsoid delusion. A concluding section has for its subject ' Homer and the Greek Religion.' Several old heresies are fought, and the new view strongly insisted upon that the Gotterszenen of the IZiad are conceived as a set-off, in a lighter vein of exhilarating burlesque, to the heroics of the battlefield. An appendix repeats the suggestion, already published by the author, that the limits of the original rhapsodies of both epics, as they were composed to be recited and as they were recited, can be recovered and precisely stated. On this subject a separate volume is promised. Criticism of individual arguments will be for future editors of the Iliad, but common sense and critical ability are writ so large on every page that oppo- nents will be hard put to it to refute. There are here 7roB\' a\?yea sverMeveevSe, %ap,maTa 8' ev,every^ffv. The book will be a joy to Unitarians. Yet even they may End points on which concurrence is not easy. The very completeness of the proof is staggering. ' Can any Homeric lay be so absolutely flawless ?' is a reflection that will occur to some, but should not really trouble them. Mr. Gladstone himself, if alive now, would probably be astonished at the truth of his saying that ' it takes time to sound the depths of Homer- -' the wondrous deeps of him who has recently been spoken of, not merely as the father of the epic, but even as 4 the only epic poet.' Others again will think the burlesque element is some- what overvalued. The view that the poems were not completed till some- where about the eighth century, can hardly be said to be one on which ' criticism is essentially agreed '; it is one over which Mr. Andrew Lang would have loved to risli the splintering of a lance. One is surprised to learn, after the researches of Messrs. Allen, Thompson and Leaf, that the Catalogue cannot b e put so far back as the tenth century. And it is a question if avaKe?taXa$tbs is to be disposed of as summarily as Dr. Drerup, following Roemer and Rothe, is inclined to -think. Disagreement of course there must be, but taken as a whole, the book is a strong one, as strong a one, the reviewer makes bold to think, as has ever been avritten on Homer; it is just such a book as Colonel Mure would have written had he been living now. It is specially strong, where so many Homeric treatises are weak, in its command of the relevant literature. But we miss from the crowd the names of Monro, Allen and Leaf; and of Croiset; and, to go nearer home, of L. Friedlander, Kayser and Usener. Even Ludwich, the hero of a hundred ISt,hts, is mentioned but once. Well, their name is Legion and space is limited. Per contra, it is a pleasure to see good old Bougot, Oskar Jager, always bright and sensible, Albracht and W. Jordan, and others whose work has been but faintly appreciated, coming to their own. The scholia have seldom been drawn on to better purpose. One rejoices to see that the life's work of Roemer in extracting essential principles from the Alexandrian remains is ade- quately esteemed. The book is one which should be widely read in this country, for its service to Homer and as shouring the keen repugnance felt by one of Ger- many's leading scholars to what has been till lately the dominant belief about Homer. In that country it will excite more than mere interest. Rothe's Ilias brought the 7rpoZua%ol to grips. Cauer set his back to the wall, taunted its author with the old parrot cry of %nwissenschaftlich, and uttered the stern defiance, Soll die Honterkritik abdankex ? -Cauer, who did as much as anv man to define, in his Gr?wndfragen, the lines of Homeric enquiry and much to stem the current of exuberant hypercriticism, but who cannot bring himself to break away from the tradition of the nineteenth century. He will hardly have been prepared for such a whole-souled reply as is given in these Grxndlagex. Another distinguished Homerist 1 has recently made a puzzle for friends and foes alike in the statement that ' Uni- tarian' is no longer a suitable word, 1 Professor Murray on Andrew Lang's Homeric work, in the QuarferZy Reviemv for April.</page><page sequence="4">THE CLASSICAL REVIEW 233 'since the controversy is arranging it- self on different lines.'

The jar-burials alone represent a later variation of custom: some of them were empty, others contained the bones of infants; the main cemetery of M. M. III. and L. M. I., to which they belong, clearly lay elsewhere; and these children were buried apart intentionally. It is not so clear whether those who buried them knew any longer that this plot of ,round contained older tombs. Some of the latter were, however, discovered and broken up by M. M.

A curious feature of the Mochlos tombs is a ' ISlling of sticky white clay, differing widely from the natural brown earth of the hillside' (p. I6), and closely resembling both the natural soil of the cemetery in Pseira, and a mainland clay which is used now for house roofs. Was it originally the roof of the graves, carried perhaps on wooden beams, which have faded away ? The pottery, which as usual gives the chief clues to date and sequence of style, does not offer much of exceptional interest, though in a number of points it ampliEes our knowledge of Early WIinoan ceramic, which (as is well known) is less well represented than later styles in some of the standard Cretan series. An anthropomorphic vase (fig. 34) carries back both the headgear and also, less obviously, the costume of the ladies of Petsofa into E. M. III. More impor- tant is the Early Minoan jewellery, of very light material usually, but charm- ing effect; solid beads of simple form, and varied colour and material, inter- changed with bracteal gold - work of leaves, sprays, and sometimes well- formed flowers.

THIS is the deSnitive report of excava- tions undertaken in I908, in continua- tion of work already noted briefly in the America? JournaZ of Archaeology, xiii., I909, pp. 273-303. Mr. Seager's earlier work at Pseira, and other sites in the neighbourhood of GourniA, is sufficient guarantee for skilful digging and minute accuracy of description, and this ac- count of Mochlos is an important addi- tion to our knowledt,e of early Crete. Mochlos is an islet separated now from the north coast of Crete by a few yards of shallow sea, and occupied in Minoan times by a small town and its ceme- tery. The town was excavated lSrst, and does not come into this volume; a brief resume of the plan and contents of the houses would have been a con- venient addition here. The tombs, twenty-four in number, if we include one late Minoan interment, are of several types; ossuaries or chamber tombs, cist graves lined with slabs, like those of the Cyclades, built graves differing only from the cist graves in the use of rubble walling instead of slabs; burials in holes and a rock cave, without any lining at all; and pithos-burials. The diversity of type is less than appears at Erst sight. Ossuaries and cist graves have already been found at Palai- kastro, to be associated as primary and secondary stages of the same rite of interment. Slab- lined graves give place to rubble graves at the transition from Early to Middle Minoan. The unlined holes clearly contain the poorer contemporaries of the cist-grave people; and it may be suggested with some con- Edence that the small cave full of bones NO. CCXXXVII. VOL.
