Charles Mauron' The Darwinian theory of evolution contained many inconsistencies in the pre-Mendelian period. Faced with a lack of any clear conception of the hereditary system on which selection operated, the early theorists assumed the truth of the common-sensical notion that the constitution of an offspring somehow resulted from the blending of the constitu- tions of its parents. But this simplistic view contained numerous weak- nessess: it did not account for the so-called sports of nature familiar to breeders; it was not sufficient to explain phenomena of depletion and increase in a species' store of variations; it provided no way of distin- guishing between the hereditary and the environmental. As long as such weaknesses were left unresolved, evolution theorists were doomed to be plagued by countless anomalies. The problems of hereditary transmis- sion remained unresolved and poorly formulated until the Mendelian revolution. In a review of the contemporary state of evolutionary theory, C. H. Waddington has offered this naive picture of Mendelism's in- ception: The idea that Mendelian heredity provided just what was required to make Dar- winian evolution work was tairly generally adopted in most parts of the world at the beginning of the century. In Britain, however, there was an unfortunate controversy exceedingly stupid it looks now - wlich has influenced a good deal of subsequenit thinking about evolution. There was a violent battle between two groups of prominent characters, Bateson on one side defending Mendelism, and people like Pearsion and Wheldon isicl on the other, opposing Mendelism and arguing for some othcr system of heredity which did not involve discrete lheredi- tary units which segregate from one another.2 1.

What will interest us here are the motivations of the combatants, especially the ill-starred biometrical faction. These motiva- tions can be brought to the surface most easily by focusing on the origins and influence of the thinking of one man: Sir Francis Galton. When we consider that the correlational statistics of the biometri- cians had its origins in the researches of Galton, we sense immediately that his role in the controversy must be important. And when we discover that Galton's book Natural Inheritance was claimed as a source of inspiration by both parties to the debate, we begin to see that his influence was as complicated as it was seminal. Galton was claimed as a father by both Mendelians (for his stress on discontinuous variation) and biometricians (for his introduction of statistics to biological studies), and his relations to both sides of the turn-of-the-century con- troversy hold a unique significance. Since an understanding of the double-edged effectiveness of Galton's thought is tantamount to a comprehension of the 1900 controversy itself, an approach to the latter's complexities through the study of Galton's simplifies the historian's problems immensely. But any such simplification is bound to bring in its train some difficulties of its own. Our case is no exception, because Galton's thought is very difficult to situate unambiguously. Like most revolutionary thinkers, he had one foot in the ideas of the period he transcended, and another in the viewpoint of the age he foresaw - and because of the interconnected- ness of his conceptual scheme, it often becomes a problem to tell which foot is which. To understand him one must assess his achievement from a number of perspectives, alternately standing atop and below his own frame of reference. It is this necessity which will determine the shape of the argument: a sequence of four scanning movements. First, the view from below: before we can understand the conflicting influences of Galton's work on his warring followers, we need to stake out the common ground they battled upon, and Galton's role in surveying it. This means looking into the origins of the concept of "heredity"itself - a concept primarily due to Galton, and primarily formulated in reaction to the inadequacy and J.R. Smythies, eds., Beyond Reductionism: New Perspectives in the Life Sciences (New York: MacMillan, 1970), p. 358. 3. See especially William B. Provine, The Origins of Theoretical Population Genetics (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1971). 142</page><page sequence="3">The Double-Edged Effect of Sir Francis Galton of a number of earlier categories of thought. We will see that Galton did not so much abolish these prior categories as reconstellate them. He showed that these categories in fact dealt with different aspects of the same general problem of "heredity," and indicated the nature of their interrelationships in his exegesis of this new omnibus notion. In the second movement of the argument, we will change our stance to gauge the distance between the Mendelian and Galtonian positions after rather than before the fact. We will begin by focusing on a pecu- liar 1875 letter to Darwin, in which Galton proffers a mathematical formulation of hereditary mechanics which is virtually identical - on the surface - to Mendel's. By expanding our view to embrace a cluster of researches contemporary with the letter, we will discover a powerful ideological undertow that tends to pull the Galtonian line of theoretical development away from the Mendelian path. This undertow is gener- ated by what can only seem, when viewed from above, an atavistic epistemology, linked to Galton's usage and understanding of the normal curve. Our results in these inquiries will lead us to seek a knowledge of the factors conditioning this constraining of Galton's thought to a posi- tion on the hither side of Mendelism, and will thereby bring about, in the third movement of the essay, a return to our earlier investigation of Galton's relations to his antecedents. When we have dredged the backwaters of Galton's prenotions and determined which were able to survive the radical change of climate induced by his own innovations, we will move ahead in time once more, tracing the survivals - conscious or unconscious - of these notions in the thinkers who built on Galton's backward-looking epistemology: the biometricians. Equally interesting will be the inability of Galton's own central motif of "structural stability" to survive transplanting into the fields of thought of his biometrical successors. In the fourth and final movement of this essay, we will consider the problems raised by the stability concept, and show their links both to the conservative force of the normal curve signification and to the enigmatic complexity of the stability metaphor itself - a complexity that went quite beyond the understanding of Mendelian adlherents and biometrical opponents alike. STAKING THE COMMON GROUND I thought it safer to proceed like the surveyor of new country, and en- deavor to fix in the first instance as truly as I could the position of several cardinal points. Sir Francis Galton4 4.

In a recent article, Ruth Schwartz Cowan answered the question this way: "What they found in his book was simply this: an operational definition for a word which has long been poorly defined - the word was 'heredity.' "5 Galton's use of the word incorporated the fields of action of two previously seminal antinomies - inheritance versus reversion, and inheritance versus variation - and introduced a third and crucial one to the ongoing debate: that of nature versus nurture. Positively, "nature" referred to all the traits resulting from the passage of the germ plasm; negatively, it was everything not induced environmentally by adaptive response. As for the second antinomy, concerning the question of how varia- tions became hereditary, Galton repudiated the belief in inheritance of acquired characters in a famous blood transfusion experiment on rab- bits, conducted to test the transmission of 'gemmules," or hereditary particles, from body cells into the blood and ultimately to the off- spring. This experimental test of Darwin's "pangenesis" theory of inheri- tance effectively closed the door to belief in acquired characters for Galton. In its place, he introduced a new way of viewing the relation between variations and inheritance: the statistical way. Galton tells us in his memoirs that his interest in the Gaussian Error Law was first aroused by one William Spottiswoode, "who had used it long ago in a Geographical memoir for discussing the probability of elevation of certain mountain chains being due to a common cause." Further, he informs us, he "had also the pleasure of making the ac- quaintance of Quetelet, who was the first to apply it to human mea- surement, in the elementary binomial form, which I used in my Heredi- tary Genius. "6 By describing individual variations in a population by bell curves, he disavowed as fruitless the quest for such variations' specific causes. He even went further and labeled futile the attempt to see small variations as the source of evolutionary change. His reasons for this, as Ms. Cowan explains, are the following: Labors of Francis Galton (London: Cambridge University Press, 1914-1930), p.xii. 5.

Individual variability acts to preserve the species rather than destroy it, reproducing, generation after generation, precisely the same distribu- tion of physical features ... organisms are analogous to polyhedra, Galton said, they can be tipped back and forth (fluctuating variations) but there are only a few positions in which they are stable (discontinuous variation). Stability of the variation means that it can be inherited.7 This last image, Galton's "polyhedron of stability," appears in a num- ber of forms in his researches, hereditary and otherwise, and its precise elucidation will concern us later on. For now, however, we need under- stand only two things: first, that while the idea of heredity proved sufficient cause for Galton to espouse the stability concept, the suffi- ciency was not sensed by his biometrical followers. Second, in Galton's own thinking, stability served, in the process of assimilating the earlier notions of inheritance into the framework of heredity, as the necessary link to the first antinomy mentioned above: the opposition of inheri- tance to reversion. Prepotent characters were those which were once displayed by a distant ancestor and have a tendency to suddenly reappear in some later generation. The problem of reversion was the problem of understanding the role of, and reason for, these prepotent characters. The great issue for theoretical interpretation was the determination of the relative ef- fectiveness of direct inheritance and distant reversion. Prior to Galton's work, these two conceptions often were treated as contradictory hy- potheses. For until Galton began to conceive of heredity in terms of statistical relationships, it was generally understood as the direct result of the interplay of quasi-physical "forces," analogous to those of New- tonian mechanics. This point is of great importance, and will be elab- orated later, but now it is time to sum up the aspects of Galton's significance we have seen so far. A final passage from Ms. Cowan's essay will do nicely: If reversion was thought to be a special form of inheritance, inheritence had to cover many generations and reversion had to refer only to resemblances which occasionally skip generations. Galton's researclhes tipped the balance toward the latter definition. His Ancestral Law of Heredity (each parent contributes 1/4 of the heritage of an individual, each grandparent 1/16 and so on) implied that infinitely distant ancestors contribute to inheritance, and his discovery of regres- sion to the population mean implied that many cases of apparent reversion are really nothing more than a probabilistic result of the process of generation. 7. Cowan, "Francis Galton's Contribution to Genetics," pp. 405-406. 145</page><page sequence="6">ROBERT DE MARRAIS Galton did not entirely solve the problem of reversion, but he did at least demon- strate that in many cases the phenomena of reversion need not be interpreted as the opposite of the phenomena of inheritance. In this sense one might say that Galton cleared the way for acceptance of Mendel's more conclusive proof that all reversionary phenomena were nothing more nor less than hereditary.8 Now that we have a rather clear notion of just which of Galton's ideas were common to all the combatants in the 1900-1906 melee, we are in a position to inquire about the conceptual 'distance" of this common layer of assumptions from the two ridges of opinion on either side of the fault-line generated by the Mendelian rediscovery. We are told that "Galton cleared the way for acceptance" of Mendelism - but not everyone followed his lead, and if we intend to find out why, we must first find ou' how close to the edge Galton was himself. Now comes the hard part: what question do we ask? Suppose we start with the obvious one: why did Galton not appre- ciate Mendel's work after it was rediscovered? We know that he did not by the conservative estimate he gave of Mendel's importance in his memoirs of 1908. Mendel, he says, clearly showed that there were such things as alternative atomic characters of equal potency in descent. How far characters generally may be due to simple, or to molecular characters morc or less correlated together. has yet to be dis- covered.9 That is, Galton himself, eight years after the rediscovery, would not let himself be convinced that the existence of equipotent characters neces- sitates their being the foundation of all characters: but it is just this extension to all characters that is the essential core of the Mendelian mentality. But - - is this demonstration of Galton's conservatism in 1908 relevant to our problem? What if, as L. C. Dunn would have it, Galton's negative estimation was due to nothing more profound than advanced age and set ways, what if "Galton, born the same year as Mendel (1822) ... [was] perhaps too old when the big break came"? 10 Since we have no way of resolving such"what if?"questions, we must ask: why did Galton not appreciate Mendel's work in the 1870's and 1880's, when as far as his biological work was concerned, he was at his creative peak? Here, the obvious answer is: since hardly anyone had even read Mendel's paper then, the question is empty. 8. Ibid., pp. 403-404. 9. Galt on, Menmories, p. 308. 10. L.C.

But now we are back to"what if?"questions. The only option left in the standard bag of historiographical tricks is to look for evidence of premonitions or portents of Mendelism in Galton's thought. But this is worse yet. Consider: if Galton cannot be made into a precursor, we find ourselves in need of some other yardstick with which to measure his stature. But, if he can be, this proves nothing either: he may have come close to Mendelian views for reasons that would not have led him actually to adopt them; the route to Mendelism might be far less direct through the area of his own thought than through some other region of contemporary speculations, thereby telling us nothing of the most logical "logical path" to rediscovery; be- sides which, the converting of scattered or quite incidental remarks into adumbrations of the desired "correct" doctrine is dangerously liable to spawn misinterpretations. We still need some other yardstick. Where can one be found? We are faced with a methodological dilemma: on the one hand, there is definitely a sense of what has been called an "epistemological break" between the biometrical viewpoint holding in the 1890's and the Mendelian stand of the next decade. Thus, we must speak of a discon- tinuous development. On the other hand, there is definitely a sense of continuity in Galton's legacy on both sides of the "break," and the mapping of continuous developments implies the existence of under- lying identities. Can we speak of such identities without invoking the tired tactic of sifting for portents, while at the same time paying our respects to the undeniably jagged edges of the"break"? Clearly we must find a way if we wish to see the whole picture - and the way can be found by looking to another field where just this sort of problem has arisen and been solved: the study, not of scientific, but of mythological thought, as conducted by the French anthropologist Claude Levi- Strauss. The hunting for precursors in the study of mythological evolu- tion led to many great difficulties and absurdities, and finally the prac- tice was largely abandoned - as it has been by most historians of science. As in history, so in anthropology, attention shifted to minute, specialized studies, leaving the larger and more important questions of comparative analysis largely to the side. The structuralist approach espoused by M. Levi-Strauss led to a renewed interest in the eking out of similitudes, not by reviving the old questions, but by transforming them. As he himself explains it, 147</page><page sequence="8">ROBERT DE MARRAIS If, as has been said, we have rendered comparative studies respectable once again, it is because we have understood that resemblance does not exist in itself: it is only a particular case of difference, that case where the difference tends toward zero. II How does this relate to the problem of measuring the conceptual "dis- tance" mentioned earlier? We can get a rough but workable idea by means of a brief allusion to another sort of distance-measuring. Imagine you have made an appointment with your optometrist to get your eyes checked, and upon arriving at his office, he has you sit down in a chiair facing a wall with two pulleys and two ropes strung through them. Moving in a horizontal plane, along either of the ropes, are two wooden blocks. You take up the near ends of the ropes in your hands. The optometrist directs you to pull back and forth on the ropes until the two blocks seem to be next to each other. As soon as you say you have them lined up, he stands astride them and sees just how well aligned they really are. The discrepancy between your impression of their ad- jacency and their actual distance, compared with your distance from the wall, tells the optometrist just how good or bad your depth per- ception is, and thus, perhaps, whether you need new glasses. To return to our problem: we find ourselves seated some seventy years' distance from the Mendelian rediscovery, and want to be able to discern how far apart the different ideas competing for allegiance at the time are from each other. We may or may not need corrective lenses to see things in their proper perspective: to find out how good our eyes are, we pull the strings attached to the two"wooden blocks' that define the upper and lower bounds of the relevant epoch in biological thouight - Galton's ideas in the one hand, the Mendelian revivalists' in the other - until "the difference tends toward zero." When we think we have them as closely aligned as possible, we then step back and look for the difference beneath the similarity, knowing that this is the most efficient means known to optical science for detemining how chronically near- sighted we really are. So: first we line up the ideas, and then we gauge 'the difference." With our old glasses, we have been able to line them within a standard deviation or two of the commonly held concept of 'heredity." But we can put them even closer than this; and here, ironically enouglh, is where the portent chasers can be of value in spite of themselves! I1.

This simple definition assumes that language not be confused with the diverse physic and somatic functions which serve it in the individual speaker. 12 Jacques Lacan In his Origins ofMendelism, Robert C. Olby claims that a letter Galton wrote to Darwin in 1875 formulates a theory of heredity in which "we find all the elements of the Mendelian explanation save the independent segregation of different pairs of characters." 13 The Mendelism of the letter is to be found in Galton's reference to "Pascal's triangle" while discussing the possible molecular basis of genetic characters. Such a reference is considered Mendelian because the lines of numbers in Pascal's triangle do, in fact, generate the fabled 'Mendelian ratios."As Olby explains it, Mendel could have arrived at the 1: 2: 1 ratio as Pascal did in the seventeenth century from working out the probable relative frequencies of the various com- binations of two entities. They are given by the coefficients of the binomial (a + )2 = a2 + 2ab + b2. Pascal fitted the coefficients of successively higher binomials into the triangle which Galton referred to in his letter. '4 Let us now see Galton's own words. Speaking of a case of black and white skin color inheritance, he says in the letter: It has been an old idea of mine, not yet discarded and not yet worked out, that the number of units in each molecule may admit of being discovered by noting the relative number of cases of each grade of deviation from the mean greyness. If there were two gemmules only, each of which might be either white or black, then in a large number of cases one-quarter would always be quite white, one- quarter quite black, and one-half would be grey. If there were 3 molecules, we should have 4 grades of colour (1 quite white, 3 light grey. 3 dark grey, 1 quite black and so on according to the successive lines of "Pascal's triangle")" Here we have Gaiton and Mendel making use of the same mathematical 12.

Although "Mendel could have arrived at the 1: 2 : I ratio" by way of purely statistical considerations, recent research would indicate that, un- like Galton, Mendel may have found the mathematical inspiration for his law not in statistics, but in combinational analysis or Boolean algebra.

Before we conduct a close examination of the Pascal's triangle motif, we not only should be aware that the "difference" beneath the mathematical congruence is the independent segregation of different pairs of characters that Olby mentions; but should also recognize that this difference is the same one we will find beneath any other congru- ences we could point to. To demonstrate this, we need only consider what other motifs are common to Galtonian and Mendelian thinking. A. H. Sturtevant, in an old-fashioned, portent-pointing speculation, summed them up when he nominated Galton as his "own candidate for the most likely person to have understood" Mendelism "because of his interest in discontinuous variation, his mathematical turn of mind, and his acceptance oi Weismann's view that the hereditary potentialities of an individual must be halved in each germ cell." 16 We must wait until the last two sections of this essay to deal with the first matter adequate- ly, but can say now that the notion of structural stability that did William Bateson and Hugo De Vries such splendid service in the cause of Mendelism, showed itself of insufficient strength to push its formu- lator into their camp - and ultimately because, in Galton's mind, stabil- ity theory was too tightly bound to a mode of thought that allowed no concept of independent segregation as a viable hypothesis. The second similarity is, of course, to be the main concern of this section. As for the third, Galton in fact used Weismann's discovery as an argument for a view antithetical to segregation, when he claimed that his Ancestral Law of Inheritance was strictly consonant with the observed binary subdivisions of the germ cells, and the concomitant extrusion and loss of one-half of the several contributions from each ot the two parents to the germ cell of the offspring. The apparent artificiality of the law ceases on those grounds to afford cause for doubt; its close agreement with physiological phenomena ought to give a prejudice in favour of its truth rather than the contrary. Again, the occupier of each ancestral place may con- tribute something of his own personal peculiarity, apart from all others, to the heritage of the oftspring. Therefore there is such a thing as an average contribution appropriate to each ancestral place, which admits of statistical valuation, however minute it might be.'7 16. A.ll. Sturtevant,A History of Genetics (New York: Harper&amp; Row, 1965), p. 22. 17. Cited in Pearson, Ga/ton, IIIA, 41. Pearson notes: "Modern research shows that the binary subdivisions of the germ cells, and the concomitant extrusion and loss of one-half of the several contributions from each of the two parents to the germ cell of the offspring may have other interpretations than that put upon it by Galton." 150</page><page sequence="11">The Double-Edged Effect of Sir Francis Galton According to the biology we all learned in high school, the connection between bifurcation of the germ plasm and Mendelian theory lies in the latter's simple binary scheme of gene choice. For each trait, there are two genetic units in each parent. The bifurcation of the germ plasm therefore implies, to a Mendelian, that only one of two altemate traits reaches the offspring from each parent. But the number of alternate traits made available by each parent to an offspring in the Ancestral Law is theoretically limitless: it is the central tenet of the theory that the peculiarities of each ancestor may be preserved, in potentia, in each successive generation. The number of alternatives provided by each pa- rent to an offspring in the Ancestral Law is thus precisely that law's as- pect that stands in direct opposition to the Mendelian mentality. No mat- ter what our angle of approach - Pascal's triangle, structural stability, Weismann's view - the 'difference' is the same. To see what condi- tioned and maintained this difference, let us return to its richest em- bodiment: the ambivalence of Pascal's triangle. Did the Pascal's triangle formula have any broader significance for Galton than that pointed to by Olby? A quick scanning of his output within a few months of the 1875 letter leads us to a very important paper, "Statistics by Intercomparison." Written just prior to the letter, it is the most thorough exposition by Galton of the nature and uses of the object that later became his trademark - the normal curve. A point Olby never seems to have noticed is that the astronomer Que- telet, whose extention of the bell curve usage to social phenomena serv- ed as Galton's inspiration, had shown the curve to be almost perfectly ap- proximated by plotting out the coefficients of the binomial expansion of (a + b) 999 . That is, if we divide the abscissa of a graph into a thousand equal intervals, and map to each of these points an ordinate value corresponding to the appropriate coefficient from the 1000th line of Pascal's triangle, we will have plotted what amounts to a normal curve. It is possible to go further than this, though, as Galton demon- strated in his essay. He showed, in fact, how the normal curve could be approximated fairly accurately by the expansion coefficients of (a +b)I7 .8 18. Galton, "Statistics by Intercomparison," Philosophical Magazine, 49 (June 1875), 41. "In the one case the magnitudes are supposed to be wholly due to the various combinations of seventeen alternatives, and the elements of the drawing are obtained from the several terms of the expansion of the following series, reckoning to the nearest integer; and their sum, of course, =1000:-0, 0, 1, 5, 18, 47, 95, 148, 186, 186, 158, 95, 47, 18, 5, 1, 0, O." 151</page><page sequence="12">ROBERT DE MARRAIS What is important here is not just that Galton's use of the triangle was linked with his work on the Frequency of Error Law: the major issue is, what was Galton's reason for making, and examining, this link? His motives can be comprehended once it is pointed out that in the same paper in which he considered these matters, he referred to llis statistical approach as "the practice of sorting objects into classes," and maintained the usefulness of his method for "gaining an insight into the absolute efficacies of qualities." 9 But he established classes, and mea- sured qualities, according to a single predilection: his lhabitual wont to investigate highly composite characters, like human stature. The advantage in studying traits like stature, says Galton, stems from the fact that human stature is not a single element, but a sum of the accumulated lengtls or thicknesses of more than a hundred bodily parts, cach as distinct from the rest as to have carried a name by which it can be specified. . . The larger the number of these elements, the more nearly does the variability of their sums assumc a 'Normal" character. 20 Such traits served, either overtly or indirectly, as the model for all of Galton's hereditary researches. There is, for instance, his sweet pea experiment. While discussing it in Natural Inheritance, Galton says, "the last of the data that I need specify were the very first that I used; they refer to the size of the seeds, which are equivalent to the Statures of the seeds." 21 The experiment was performed in 1875, the year of the letter to Darwin and the article under discussion, and so we may assume a similarity in the logic and motivation beneath all three. Re- turning to the question guiding this discussion, we can see, in detail, Galton's reason for making and examining the link between Pascal's triangle and the error curve by examining in like detail his method of studying composite traits. This is the method developed in the "Inter- comparison" paper, which I will now outline. Suppose we are dealing witlh Galton's favorite illustration of a prop- er trait: we are collecting data on the heighlts of some representative quantity of savages, say, in some tribe whose trait distributions we wislh to analyze. On procuring the necessary measurements --- tallest, shlort- est, and man in the middle if we were in a lhurry and resorted to Galton's short-cut "ogive" method --- we would arrange them in a table 19.

The middle term would correspond, to a very high degree of accuracy, to the theoretical mean of statistical theory; then, taking the degree of deviation from this mean of our readings at successively greater distances from this middle position in our table, we would be able to obtain a number that would signify the "standard deviation' of the typical savage in our sample from the "aver- age type." But as no real group is thoroughly homogenous with respect to any given character, there are likely to be several different strains, each with its own mean. The real distribution for the total population would then be amenable to signification not by a single normal curve, but only by a more wiggly curve which would be, in effect, the linear combination of some specified number of independent normal curves. For instance, with respect to stature there are two major centers of stability, or means being deviated from, in the French population, as Durkheim 22 relates at one point: in the northern region, there is a tall stock of Cymrian origin; in the southem region, a short Celtic stock dominates; in intermediate areas, some specifiable degrees of their mixture prevail. How would Galton tell us to analyze such a mixed population? Just as an elementary mathematics student learns to factor a complicated algebraic expression in order to solve for the unknown, Galton, by the method he names "intercomparison," sorts a complicated genotypic expression into its mutually independent phases. To cite an example from his paper, Any objects (say, fruit) which are liable to an influence so large as to make it necessary to divide it into three phases, really consists of three series generically different which are entangled together, and ought theoretically to be separat- ed .... In short, the fruits of which we may be considering some hundred or a few thousand specimens ought to be looked upon as a multitude of different sorts mixed together. 23 But Galton ran into a large epistemological dilemma in the midst of carrying out his sorting operation.

Suppose we have resolved our fruits into three phases. The only way "to bring these phases to a common measure" is "by the process of fictitious grouping with appropriate doses of minute influences." 24 This is because the Law of Frequency of Error, according to which the normal curve signification is generated, is a "highly artificial hypoth- esis," for at least four reasons. Says Galton, it assumes that individual errors of observation, or individual differences in objects belonging to the same generic group, are entirely due to the aggregate notion of variable influences in different combinations, and that these influences must be (1) all independent in their effect, (2) all equal, (3) all admitting of being treated as simple alternatives "above average" or 'below average"; and, (4) the usual Tables are calculated on the further supposition that the variable influences are infinitely numerous. 2S But of course the sources of deviation from ideal curve-fit, in any real-life, finite set of samples, can never fit any of these criteria; and so any procedure which assumes the opposite must always leave some measurable percentage of error to explain. Hence, by its very nature the Frequency Law prohibits the discovery of the real (i.e., finite number of) causal agencies determining a trait's distribution pattern or "type." The overriding issue in Galton's paper was the determination of some sleight-of-hand means whereby this difficulty could be evaded. Galton attacked this difficulty by a three-step method. First, he assumed that "all miscellaneous influences of a few small and very minute kinds, may be treated for a first approximation exactly as if they consisted of a moderate number of small and equal alternatives." Next, he took the probable error of fit of the"ogive" - his name for the curve based on a finite number of influences - to the ideal normal curve peculiar to the distribution at hand, and determined this error as a function of the number of 'influences" - the exponent of (a + b)n - involved. Finally, he performed second-level approximations, when necessary, until he obtained an appropriate value for the exponent "n." This procedure, lhowever, was doomed to failure. A "number of influ- ences" was obtained, which was at least as large as the actual number of influences -- but not necessarily equal to it: "On considering, however. it will appear that in certain cases the number may be less, even con- siderably less, than the tabular value, though it can never exceed it." 24.

Ibid., p. 38. 154</page><page sequence="15">The Double-Edged Effect of Sir Francis Galton The more complex and interrelated the influences, the less accurate the approximation of their mutual independence and equality, and there- fore the greater the divergence between the theoretical "influence number" and the smaller, actual value. As an illustration, we may consider what the values of mlq-m would be in the case of a wall built of 17 courses of stone, each stone being 3" thick, and subject to a mean error in excess with deficiency of one fifth of an inch. Obviously, the mean height m of the wall would be 3x17", and its probable error q-m would be very small, being derived from a binomial ogive of 17 elements, each of the value of only one-fifth of an inch.26 By an arithemetical blunder, Galton computed the 'theoretical"number of courses of stone to be 321; however, m/q-m = 51/1.6 = 31.9. This number, substantially less than Galton's, is nonetheless sufficiently larger than 17 to clinch the argument. Now, to see how vital this point truly is for understanding Galton's predicament, recall his reasons for considering stature an ideal object for statistical study: it "is not a single element, but a sum of the accumulated lengths or thicknesses of more than a hundred bodily parts." That is to say, if we wish to isolate the number (and thereby discover the separate identities and behaviors) of the genetic "bricks" that together make up the morphological"wall" that is a Galtonian trait, we find ourselves forbidden by the minimal set of preconceptions and procedures that even allow us to formulate the desire in the first place - to do so. For a Galtonian, then, it would be impossible to derive the actual number of the real influences - which need not be unique for any trait, anyway -- and thus highly untenable to try correlating specific influences with specific sets of genetic material. There is, however, one very simple sort of trait that could be seen as an exception to the general rule. Take the converse of the above argu- ment: the less complex and interrelated the influences, the more ac- curate the approximation of their mutual independence and equality, and therefore the closer the fit between the theoretical and real values for the "influence numbef." Obviously, the limit situation - in which the influence number derived theoretically would equal the real value, and correlate with the number of gemmule types involved in making traits - is the case of equipotence. For, by definition, equipotent traits are those which take values between two equally "potent" extreme types. Being equally "potent' means the competing types are equally "gregarious,"fertile," and so on, in which case manifestations of eitlher 26. Ibid., p. 43. 155</page><page sequence="16">ROBERT DE MARRAIS extreme would, on statistical grounds, be directly related to the quota of gemmules allowed to form the trait, and the relative proportions of the two types in the hereditary material. We then - only then - have a congruence with the general Mendelian case, where the exponent of (a + b)n exactly denotes the numberof "characters,"or hereditary units, involved. The letter of 1875 has now been explained, for the only type of trait which Galton refers to in it is specified as being equipotent. Thus he says of its formation, It would have been due to the development, not of one gemmule but ot a group) of gemmules, in which the black and white species would, on statistical grounds, be equally numerous (as by hypothesis they were equipotent). 27 The argument just concluded does not prove that Galton's fixation on "types"would have been incapable of leading him to accept Mendel's categories as fixed, but different, ideal groups, if he had encountered Mendel's papers at an opportune time. Instead, it shows the obstacles he would have needed to circumvent - obstacles bound closely to his own mathematical metlhodology and linked specifically to his inter- pretation of Pascal's triangle. But not only did this latter matlhematical object support the potential obstacle to Mendelism in Galton's picture; it was the same object that generated Mendel's ratios. This is telling proof that mathematical "signs," like linguistic ones, are essentially ambivalent. In the biological sciences, mathematical formulations are sufficiently rare for their basic indeterminacy to pass unnoticed. In the debate over Mendelism, though, we have a case where this ambivalence was underscored. But neither side of the debate saw the situLation this way. Not until the 1902 paper of statistician Udny Yule was it demonstrated that the two sides' mathematical formalisms were not in theoretical conflict. And not until a number of years after this did anyone involved in the debate come to the same realization. This points out the natural corollary to the ambivalence of mathiematical signs: the tendency of these neutral symbols to become loaded withl ideological significance through thie nonmathematical conditioning of the environments they are placed in. But this points to the leading quLestion of the next part of our story: what factors conditioned Galton's mlatlhenmatical ideolo- gy'? We have seen lhints - for wlhen we imentioned sLuchi attributes of the carriers of Galtonian traits as "gregariousness," 'fertility," and the like. 27.

If we wish to follow up such hints, though, we will have to take another look at the thought-world of the pre-Galtonian period. SURVIVORS OF THE PARADIGM SHIFT ... each piece of the new structure is derived from a corresponding piece of some older one Sir Francis Galton28 In the last few pages, 1 have been at great pains to pinpoint the "differ- ence" between the biometrical and Mendelian viewpoints, as seen in the light of contemporary categories relevant to their debate. But categories which seem crucial to our understanding of the controversy, such as segregation, were not necessarily the ones the combatants employed: indeed, many of the concepts that played crucial roles in tiheir own scientific educations no longer exist for us. Yet if we hope to understand the attitudes of the combatants, we must understand the concepts around which they formed. To do this we must resurrect the mental sets of the pre-Mendelian - and the pre-Galtonian - outlooks. To situate the controversy in the categories of its own time, we must move backward in time from the period of our previous analyses. In the language of our earlier investigations, we must look for a second'difference,"situated between the innovations of Galton and the points of view preceding them. This'difference" cannot be considered well defined, though -- that is, it cannot be of use to us - unless it can be related, in its turn, to the "difference" underlying our previous discussion. Our overall task, then, is not unlike that of the ancient Greek engineer commissioned by the tyrant of Syracuse to put a tunnel through a mountain: we must dig from both sides at once, and try to make the two lines of our excavating meet somehow in the middle. For us, the two sides are the realms of thought prior and succedent to Galton's contributions; the middle, then, must be situated in the heart of Galton's own development. To conserve the continuity of the total argument, the procedure will be to get a composite "feel" for the second difference rather than a rigorous definition just enough of an idea to take us through the tunnel and back to our previous analysis. We will be looking at the three interrelated matters that must be the constituent units of any 28. Galton, Natural Inheritance, p. 8. 157</page><page sequence="18">ROBERT DE MARRAIS "difference" we could hope to evoke here: the nature of the hereditary material, the nature of the characters it signifies, and the way in which the characters become"fixed" through the activities of the material. We can begin by running our normal procedure in reverse. Instead of looking for the similitude beneath the difference, let us start with an apparent difference, and look for a perspective in which it disappears. In the introductory pages of this paper, we noted that, prior to Galton, heredity was seen as the direct result of quasi-physical forces. Accord- ing to Ms. Cowan, Romanes seems to have envisioned an inertial law of heredity; Spencer speculat- ed that there might be polarized "physiological units" which could carry the hered- itary force in much the same way that glass balls carry electric charge; Darwin analogized inheritance to powers which can neutralize or counterbalance each other. Whether the force model was explicit or implied it was there; in light ofthe success of nineteenth-century physical sciences it would have been remarkable if such a model had not presented itself. 29 Here is the difference, and here, too, is where it disappears: for, con- trary to Ms. Cowan's opinion, Galton's transcendence of the Newtonian model was not complete. His model was as similar to the physical picture of Clausius and Maxwell as the earlier theories were to the strictly mechanical picture; Maxwell, in fact, used a number of the same images and sources as Galton. 30 But just as statistical thermodynamics did not so much challenge the Newtonian framework as incorporate it, intact, in its foundations, so Galton's particles had "force"- and were 29. Cowan, "Francis Galton's Contribution to Genetics," pp. 400-401. 30. Elizabeth Garber, "Aspects of the Introduction of Probability into Phys- ics," Centaurus, 17 (1972), discusses Maxwell's indebtedness to Quetelet, and cites (p. 27) this passage from Campbell and Garrett's Life of Maxwell (London: Macmillan, 1884): "Maxwell later built a graphical model to illustrate the velocity distribution. The graph was of the diagram of the distribution of bullet marks around a target. The probability of error decreases rapidly as the distance from the target increases. If the distance from the centre represents the velocity of the molecules then the diagram represents the distribution of velocities of the mole- cules in a gas" (pp. 562-563). Exactly the same image of bullets and targets occurs in a number ot Galton's works, but with one crucial difference: Maxwell speaks of time (velocity); Galton's types are static. The importance of the link becomes clearer when we find out that structural stability was central in Maxwell's thought as well; here I refer to his study of the stability of Saturn's rings. As Campbell and Garrett point out, "it is probable that the investigations connected with Saturn's Rings, which led Maxwell to contemplate the condition of the air in the midst of a 'flight of brickbats,' first led him to take up the subject of the Kinetic theory of gases" (p. 562). The analogy between statistical physics and statistical biology - up to and perhaps including the Quantum Mechanical and Mendelian Revolutions of 1900 - is profound and revealing but it is far beyond the scope of this paper. 158</page><page sequence="19">The Double-Edged Effect of Sir Francis Galton even modeled on Spencer's "physiological units"3 - even though his analysis concerned itself with their statistical ensembles. All of this is spelled out in Galton's "Theory of Heredity" paper, written in the crucial year 1875. Speaking of the hereditary material, or "stirp," he tells us The contents of the stirp must segregate themselves into divisions or septs, and that these septs must subdivide again and again, under the influence of the mutual attractions and repulsions of their units, just as a large political party may repeat- edly subdivide itself into different factions. 32 Galton, then, did not see his work as a means of making the force model obsolete. Instead, his theoretical ambition and accomplishment was to find a methodological route that would lead him, without any compromise of his 'Newtonian" first principles, from the chaotic micro- cosm of individual atoms of hereditary force to the analysis of their statistical herding patterns. He mediated between these two extremes by way of a very sophisticated (and to many, very confusing) meta- phor: this is his key conception of structural stability, which managed to be at once mechanical and sociological in its allusions. Many of the earliest, and most informative, versions of the stability model are found in Galton's 1869 study of Hereditary Genius. The most cordial to our needs is his analogy to the congested crowd strug- gling to push and shove its way through a narrow passage. If by a great effort, a man drives those in front of him but a few inches forwards, a recoil is pretty sure to follow, and there is no ultimate advance. At length, by some accidental unison of effort, the dead lock yields, a forward movement is made, the elements of the crowd fall into slightly varied combinations, but in a few seconds there is another dead lock, which is relieved, after a while, through just the same processes as before. Each of these formations of the crowd, in which they have found themselves in a dead lock, is a position of stable equilibrium, and represents a typical attitude. 3 This complex version of the stability motif is clearly the sort Galton has in mind when he thinks of the role of hereditary particles in the forma- tion of traits. Compare the "struggling crowd" and its"typical attitudes," 31. Galton, "A Theory of Heredity," Anthropological Institute Journal, 5 (1876), 3 36.

Ms. Cowan has suggested that "Galton ignored development more out of neglect than out of con- scious intent" 35 - but once we understand stability, we can see that Galton's neglect was essential. Just as his analysis of the composite trait led him to disavow the search for specific links between hereditary particles and the traits they fixed, so his running image of the jostling crowd and flying swarm led him to see traits as fixed during develop- ment by a long competitive struggle, involving an intermix of "primary and subordinate stability in organic structure" whose conditions "must be far more complex than anything we have wits to imagine."36 As he wrote in Natural Inheritance, It would seem that while the embryo is developing itself, the particles more or less qualified for each post wait as it were in competition, to obtain it. Also, that the particle that succeeds, must owe its success partly to accident of position and partly to being better qualified than any equally well placed competitor to gain a lodgment. Thus the step by step development of the embryo cannot fail to be influenced by an incalculable number of small and mostly unknown circum- stances. 37 Although Galton's biometrical followers rejected the stability motif, its basic content - the surrender to complexity - they maintained intact. They, like their mentor, were unable to separate the problems of devel- opment, heredity, and the hereditary mechanism, either confusing their proper spheres or else eliminating one or the other from serious consideration. As L. C. Dunn has noted, the problems of inheritance and development which could be examined separately after the clues to the transmission mechanism were discovered and exploited had not been subjected to this cleaving influence. 38 34.

Dunn, Short History of Genetics, p. 50. 160</page><page sequence="21">The Double-Edged Effect of Sir Francis Galton And all of this was naturally confounded with the felt necessity to model the germs on the organism whose traits they helped to fix. Galton's hereditary particles reproduce, compete, and do almost every- thing real organisms do in the evolutionary struggle, and this macro- cosm-microcosm model remains intact in the biometrical view: the fol- lowing words, after all, come not from a mid-Victorian biologist, but from Karl Pearson, in the third decade of this century: I must confess to feeling it extremely difficult to accept the view that the popula- tion of germ cells belonging to an individual organism are like atoms, identical in character, and have a germinal capacity defined by absolutely the same formula. Such a population of germ cells is, if parasitical, still an organic population, and one continually in a state of reproduction and change. No other organic popula- tion that we know of is without variation among its members, and I find it extraordinarily hard to believe that it is a matter of complete indifference which individual spermatogonium of an organism is the ultimate source for fertilisation of an individual ovum of a second organism. 3 It is of course very significant that the antiquated motif of the ani- mated self-reproducing particle can survive the successive revolutions of Galton's innovation of heredity and the biometricians' rejection of Galto- nian stability. The problematic survival is, naturally, this second one: but it is a false problem. In Galton's general depiction of traits, human char- acters had first priority for models; Galton's metaphors for the pro- cesses involved in fixing and propagating characters in the offspring were flagrantly anthropomorphic: crowds, elections, societal catastro- phes, and so on, are the images with which he thinks of these problems, as well as the sources of many of the problems in his thinking. But this is a knack Galton shares with the biometricians: if we accept Kenneth Boulding's dictum that "the meaning of a message is the change which it produces in the image," 40 then the differences between Galton and biometricians over stability had no meaning in the present context; for the sociological imagery is an invariant feature of both views. Karl Pearson's particles still bred and struggled, and all the biometricians seem to have preached Galton's creed of eugenics. We might say that the "message" was transmitted without damage from the one place to the other, even though Galton's packaging was destroyed in the process. These last considerations show us something quite interesting: the animate, even anthropomorphic imagery that plays such an important 39. Pearson, Galton, lIA, 84n. 40.

But this brings us to shift focus from the fixing and material base of the traits to the epistemology of the inherited character itself. Such a shift will help to fill in many of the thoughts just sketched, as well as provide us with another way of approaching our second "difference." And the best place to look for such a new variation on this"difference"is in the moment that Galton's heredity notion was first put forth. Galton him- self tells us what the differences of opinion were at that time: as he reports in his memoirs, The current views on heredity were at that time so vague and contradictory that it is difficult to summarize them both justly and briefly. Speaking generally, most authors agreel that all bodily and some mental qualities were inherited by brutes, but they refused to believe the same of man. Moreover, theologians made a sharp distinction between the body and the mind of man, on purely dogmatic grounds ... It seer-s hardly credible now that even the word heredity was then considered fanciful and unusual. I was chaffed by a cultured friend for adopting it from the French. 41 What is worth nothing is that the views prior to Galton's, although "vague and contradictory," yet managed to be virtually unanimous on one point: that while "all bodily and some mental qualities were in- herited by bruits," the same must not be thought of man. There is the "difference," quite precisely: as is the typical pattem in the history of ideas, the reaction to one sort of extremism is embodied in another. Galton's predecessors found the heredity of man's most human qual- ities a point for debate. But Galton modeled his notion of hereditary traits on just such human characters. Theologians distinguished between mind and body on purely dogmatic grounds, whereas Galton, on grounds that seem equally dogmatic to us today, posited a sharp corre- lation between physiological traits and mental and moral characters. But here we would go astray if we assumed this second reversal was a sign of sheer contrariety on Galton's part. For while this reversal in- volved an innovation in hereditary thought, it was a logical continu- ation of a very nonhereditary mode of thinking that was quite wide- spread at the time: here I have in mind none other than that noble pseudo-science, phrenology. To see this clearly, we must be cognizant of these facts: that Galton saw his idea of a trait fully embodied in the pictorial equivalent of his 41. Galton, Memories, p. 288. 162</page><page sequence="23">The Double-Edged Effect of Sir Francis Galton statistical analyses, the composite photograph;42 that composite por- traiture was an idea that seems to have occurred jointly to Galton and Herbert Spencer, although the technique was Galton's own; 43 and finally, that this second fact is of no small significance, as Galton's friend Spencer was an avid devotee of phrenology in his youth, and in fact published a few theoretical papers in phrenological journals. And while he eventually repudiated these early interests sometime after 1846, he never escaped the mental set they forged in him. Indeed, as Robert Young has said of his Social Statics (to cite but one instance of a general pattern), "his argument is based on a distinctly phrenological view of man". 44 Considering all this, we ought to take a moment to see what Galton's and Spencer's common brainchild was all about. In Galton's words, Having obtained drawings or photographs of several persons alike in most re- spects, but differing in minor details, what sure method is there of extracting the typical characters from them? . . My own idea was to throw faint images of the several portraits in succession, upon the same sensitized photographic plate. 4 Galton's inspiration was due to a letter from a Mr. Du Cane, crimi- nologist, asking for Galton's assistance in devising some sort of taxo- 42. "Composite portraits are, therefore, much more than averages, because they include the features of every individual of whom they are composed. They are pictorial equivalents of those elaborate statistical tables out of which averages are deduced. There cannot be a more perfect example than they afford, of what the metaphysicians mean by generalisations, when the objects generalised are objects of vision, and when they belong to the same typical group, one important characteristic of which is that medium characteristics should be far more frequent than divergent ones. It is strange to notice how commonly this conception has been overlooked by metaphysicians, and how positive are their statements that generaLisations are impossible, and that the very idea of them is absurd." Galton, "Generic Images," The Nineteenth Century, 6 (1879), 162. 43, "I may mention a plan which had occurred both to Mr. Herbert Spencer and myself, the principle of which is to superimpose optically the various draw- ings and to accept the aggregate result. Mr. Spencer suggested to me in conversa- tion that the drawings reduced to the same scale might be traced on separate pieces of transparent paper and secured one upon another, and then held between the eye and the light. I have attempted this with some success." I:rom Galton's "Address to the Anthropological Department of the British Association" at Ply- mouth, 1877; cited in Pearson, Galton, II, 229-230.

From this first attempt to his last, Galton remained true to form. As Karl Pearson explains it, Galton belonged to a generation in which the influence of Lavater and the belief in some form of phrenology were still appreciable. He accordingly sought to isolate types and to measure deviations from facial type, in order to determine whether facial variations were correlated with mental variations. He was really attempting to make a true science out of the study of physiognomy. The anthropologist up to Galton's date had employed portraiture to distinguish, if possible between mental types. He may have been pursuing a will-o'-the-wisp, but this psychical investiga- tion was really at the basis of all his photographic work.46 Now that we've unveiled a rather deep analogy between the phreno- logical and Galtonian characters, it is time, once again, to seek "the difference." Phrenology, in its pure form, proposed a distinct corre- lation between the bumps on the head and the powers of the various mental faculties, which just happened to be localized in the regions of the brain subtending the cranial bumps. The strength or weakness of a faculty in a person's psychic make-up was revealed by the elevation or depression, respectively, of the area of the skull that covered its locus. But Galton by no means restricted himself to the head, or to any normal notion of localization. This fact and its implications are most fully visible in an area of research that in some senses lies at the op- posite end of the pole from his criminal composites, even though it concerns the same problem of criminal identification. This area is his analysis of fingerprints. It is opposite, for one thing, because it was successful. It was successful because the groupings - unlike the "Mur- der, Manslaughter, and Burglary" types of the criminal photographs - were not externally forced on the data, but were determined naturally, and somewhat surprisingly, by the objects of investigation themselves. His fingerprint analysis was different, too, because the catalogue of types it generated was immune to the effects of "promiscuity in mar- riage, or, as it is now called, Panmixia"47 - that is, fingerprints, for obvious reasons, are unaffected by natural selection. Fingerprints are, in fact, "apparently the only peculiarity of which Panmixia . . . admits of being studied on a large scale" - a fact that Galton lumps together with the observation that "no sensible amount of correlation exists between any of the patterns on the one hand, and any of the bodily faculties or characteristics on the other." 48 46.

Ibid., p. 197. 164</page><page sequence="25">The Double-Edged Effect of Sir Francis Galton This last citation clearly indicates that there is a sense in which Galton transcended the phrenological view. Before making this sense precise, though, we should first test the limits of this transcendence. For, the last passage to the contrary, it would be a mistake to assume that Galton overcame, in the study of prints, his urge to seek correlations between the physiological and psychical realms - that he was interested solely in creating a system to facilitate individual identification. Finger- prints, as their relationship to Panmixia proves, stand toward the zero end of the scale that measures the semantic load of characters. But just because they are as low as one can go does not mean Galton assumed they were empty marks. Not at all! Even with the prints, he had hopes for "their use in indicating Race and Temperament", and had thought at first that any hereditary peculiarities would almost necessarily vary in different races, and that so fundamental and enduring a feature as the finger markings must in some way be correlated with temperament. 49 Lest one feel Galton could be easily dissuaded from his faith in the existence of such far-fetched correlations, consider that, whereas Galton admitted he could find "no indication of temperament, char- acter, or ability" in finger marks, his faith in the existence of such links was so strong that he qualified his failure in terms that could put a glow on any fortune-teller's face: Of course these conclusions must not be applied to the general shape of the hand, which as yet I have not studied, but which seems to offer a very interesting field for exact inquiry. 50 Thus, there are certainly reactionary features in Galton's attitude. But the mere fact that his method of seeking correlations could yield, with fingerprints, an unwanted zero result, shows that his method, as distinct from that of the phrenologists, attributed to the biological characters or "signs" no semantic load in themselves. Only through context could more than an identificatory value be assigned to them. Galton's char- acters, then, are the biological equivalents - in at least this one very important respect - of Saussure's linguistic signs. Of the latter, Levi- Strauss has said, 49. Ibid., p. 17. 50. Ibid., p. 197. 165</page><page sequence="26">ROBERT DE MARRAIS Whatever emendations the original formulation may now call for, everybody will agree that the Saussurean principle of the arbitrary character of linguistic signs was a prerequisite for the accession of linguistics to the scientific level. 51 In a like manner, we can say that, whatever emendations the original formulation of Galton may now call for, no one can deny that his breaking with phrenology to the extent of considering arbitrary signs was the prerequisite for the accession of heredity to a scientific level. Here, then, is the "difference" we have been looking for. But this difference from the prior phrenological view acts simultaneously as a structural support for all later developments. If Galtonian "signs" are arbitrary, biological meaning is only found in the relations between them: but this is exactly what is implied by shifting one's focus from the framework of Ms. Cowan's "force" model to the frame of reference that sees heredity as a statistical relationship. And it is exactly this shift of focus that constituted the "staking of the common ground" of the controversy between Mendelians and biometricians - and that propped up, thereby, the congruences that defined the field of our first "differ- ence." To use the words of Kenneth Boulding, the Galtonian sign repre- sents a "break boundary at which the system suddenly changes into another or passes some point of no return in its dynamic processes." 52 Demarcating at once a terminus of the pre-Galtonian period and the point of inception for the controversy's field of discourse, it serves as a mediator between the conceptual categories and analyses of these last two movements of our argument. To return to the imagery with which we began this portion of the essay, the Galtonian sign serves as a point of merger for the two lines of our digging. The ends of the tunnel have been met in the middle at last. INERTIA, STABILITY, AND MATHEMATICAL SIGNS Signs are a necessary support of thought. For socialized thought (stage of communication) and for the thought which is being socialized (stage of formulation), the most usual system of signs is language properly cal- led; but internal thought, especially when creative, willingly uses other systems of signs which are more flexible, less standardized than language and leave more liberty, more dynamism to creative thought.

But, on deeper levels, we can see things of greater significance in all this. We see, for instance, something of the way these 'stumbling blocks" managed to display such inertia when found in the biometri- cians' path. For the analysis we have conducted indicates the strong conservative force of the normal curve symbolism over their hereditary speculation. Thus, for reasons that should now be quite familiar, the old "force" model of particles and all the other atavistic baggage it carried along with it were able to remain hidden in the depths of the theoretical superstructure of biometrical thought. In the second part of this study, we saw the link between the epistemology of the normal curve and the necessity to avoid the segregation concept; and in the third part, we have seen how closely linked the avoidance of segregation was to a definitely antiquated view of the hereditary material, which in turn was very closely correlated with an anthropomorphic notion of hereditary characters. Our first 'difference" - on the question of in- dependently segregated traits - has turned out to signify, on at least the biometrical side, not a single view, but an amalgam of left-overs and unexamined conclusions. To papaphrase a dictum of LAvi-Strauss's con- ceming myths, the true constituents of the scientific beliefs we have dealt with "are not the isolated relations but bundles of such relations, and it is only as bundles that these relations can be put to use and combined so as to produce a meaning." 55 If we return to the crucial year 1875, we observe that after the brief venture into speculation on the constituents of the genetic material embodied in the Darwin letter and the two key papers, Galton's interest soon retreated from the edge of the epistemological precipice and, after the fashion of his polygonal slabs, regressed more and more over the 54.

The result was that Galton and his biometrical followers found themselves less and less interested in questions concerning the nature of the genetic material: these be- came, in fact, nonquestions. As late as the 1904 correspondence with Bateson, Galton could still maintain, as Pearson points out, that "the exact mechanism of heredity, even if we could find it out, was not of the highest importance." 56 But how could Galton, Pearson, and company be so blind to the significance of the cytological breakthroughs that were contemporary with their own researches? We find the first part of the answer in this second result of the "Intercomparison" paper: its implications led to the relics of older thought alluded to above, becoming encysted in the bottom-most layers of their thinking. To use Arthur Koestler's apt phrase, they became "the ghost in the machine," unconsciously govern- ing the most basic and axiomatic aspects of the biometricians' standard thought processes, and thereby making it impossible for the Pearsons and Weldons to "think" cytology well enough to sense its value and relevance. Indeed, the Galtonian interpretation of Weismann's discovery of germ plasm bifurcation mentioned earlier, would, if anything, rein- force the faith in the unspoken assumptions of the biometricians, making it even more difficult to see in cytological evidence a source for valid rebuttals of their own opinions. To cite a keen observation made by Agnes Arber in The Mind and the Eye, Every grade can be traced between remote analogies, and analogies which are so close that they pass into identities, and - paradoxically enough - it is often the remote analogies which have the greatest value, while it is the close analogies of which we have to beware. The misuse of an analogy by pressing it to the point at which it is confused with an identity, is one to which biological thought is peculiarly liable. 5 Further support for these arguments is obtained by resorting to the device Levi-Strauss is fond of referring to as the "a contrario proof." In the case at hand, we should expect that if the mathematical symbolism of the normal curve had the conservative force over speculation I have claimed, then the absence of its sway over one's thinking should have a significantly positive correlation with the radical, Mendelian, attitude. Earlier, I cited Sturtevant's allegation that Galton's "mathematical 5 6. Pearson, Galton, IIIA, 22 1. 57.

It must be noted that Bateson and numerous other early Mendelians were not impressed by cytological evidence either. The problem of the historical role of cytology is clearly a complicated one. 168</page><page sequence="29">The Double-Edged Effect of Sir Francis Galton turn"should have made him amenable to Mendelism. I think it should be clear by now that the opposite is the case: the mathematics of Mendel's ratios is so simplistic compared to the reified apparatus of the biometricians, that we should not be shocked to find that Mendel's greatest advocate, William Bateson, was a consummate anti-mathemati- cian. We have it on good authority (Bateson's wife) that this was the case. In her biography of her husband, she cites a letter of his of Februa- ry 1905 in which he confesses that Mathematics were my difficulty. Being destined for Cambridge I was specially coached in mathematics at school. Arrived here, I was again coached, but failed. Coached once more, I passed, having wasted not one, but several hundred hours on that study. Needless to say, my knowledge of mathematics is nil. '" The nonmathematical basis of William Bateson's (and all the early Mendelians') thought represented not so much a cause of his Mendelism as an absence of the mainstay holding together the bundle of inhibitory relations that held back the biometricians. This absence served, then, to allow some other 'bundle of relations' to be insinuated in Bateson's mind - relations that could act as occasions for a persuasion opposite to that of the 'biometricians': cytological analogies, for instance, or the evidence from plant hybridizations - or Galton's polygonal slab of stability. We now have a preliminary solution to the problem of stability: Bateson, being no mathematician, could make good use of the"remote analogy" (Arber's term) it provided; Pearson, the profound statistical theorist, tells us that the pages on "Stability of Sports" in his personal copy of Natural Inheritance were "defaced by many marginal notes expressing anger at Galton's analogies." 59 This preliminary explanation, though, while providing a good enough solution, as far as this paper is concemed, to the question of the metaphor's appeal to the Mendelians, is too superficial a formula to explain the biometricians' disdain. Certainly, the stability motif was not mathematical; but both it and the mathematics proceeded from Gatton. To understand why Galton's immediate followers embraced one half of his conception and discarded the other, we need to see just what func- tion stability served for Galton. As a start, we can return to the work where it received its most thorough elaboration and justification: not Natural Inheritance, but Finger-Prints. 5 8.

There was another driving force behind his researches, related to the first motive, but ultimately more important: the vindication of his concept of stability. Hence, he writes that The distinction between a mere variety and a sport is real and fundamental. I argued this point in Natural Inheritance, but had then to draw my illustrations from non-physiological experiences, no appropriate physiological ones being then at hand: this want is now excellently supplied by observations of the patterns on the digits. 60 Now we see one of the central reasons for his choosing to study a trait immune to the effects of Panmixia: since fingerprints are almost the only characters formed without the aid of selection, we might consequently have expected them to be hybridized. But that is not the case; they refuse to blend. Their classes are as clearly separated as those of any of the genera of plants and animals. They keep pure and distinct as if they had severally descended from a thorough-bred ancestry, each in respect to its own peculiar character. 61 This refusal of whorls, loops, and arches to blend, could only mean one thing to Galton. Since the forms of distribution of the three types of prints were caused "by internal conditions, and in no way by natural selection in the ordinary sense of that term", 62 their origin - and by extension, the origin of all traits - could only be through sporting: Mere varieties from a common typical centre blend freely in the offspring, and the offspring of every race whose statistical characters are constant, necessarily tend, as I have often shown, to regress towards their common typical centre. Sports, on the other hand, do not blend freely; they are fresh typical centres of sub-species, which suddenly arise we do not yet know precisely through what uncommon concurrence of circumstances, and which observations show to be strongly trans- missible by inheritance. 63 How could the biometricians refute this argument from their mas- ter? Here is the explanation of that most constant disciple, Karl Pear- son: 60. Galton, Finger-Prints, p. 212. 61. Ibid., pp. 209-210. 62. Ibid., p. 209. 63. Ibid., p. 211. 170</page><page sequence="31">The Double-Edged Effect of Sir Francis Galton The misfortune arose from Galton not having reached the formulae for multiple regression. Had he done so, he would have seen the contradiction between his 'Law of Ancestral Heredity" and his interpretation of "Regression." Whether con- tinuous evolution, or partly one and partly the other, expresses the truth, it is quite certain that Galton in 1892 supported evolution by mutations owing to an error of interpretation. " From the frame of reference of Galton's followers, then, it was this "error of interpretation' which "forced on him the conception of posi- tions of stable equilibrium, each with its own centre of regression, and led him to [the] view that evolution must generally proceed by sports." 65 Of course the modem biologist, familiar with W. Johannsen's classic paper "Heredity in Populations and Pure Lines" of 1903, sees this all quite differently. The biometricians, their minds muscle-bound from too much mathematical exercise, were not flexible enough to conceive the distinction between the mean or average character, and what we now call the genotype. In Johannsen's words, The variation curve of individuals representing a racially pure population in the ordinary sense, frequently, indeed perhaps in most instances, can be shown to be the result of numerous genotypes representing the various pure lines of the popu- lation. The average value thus does not always have the significance of a true genotype. A great deficiency of a purely statistical approach is obvious in this regard. 66 The situation, then, can be summed like this: in Galton's mind, both stability and correlation were personal innovations, and thus the balanc- ing act necessitated by holding both concepts at once involved, for him, no epistemological conflict of the sort experienced by the biometricians - who developed the one without being able to use its implications to develop or justify the other. The cult of continuity that emanated from Darwin's monumental work provided the first principle for both Galton and the biometricians. To cope with the anomalies it raised, Galton introduced stability; the biometricians, instead, extended Galton's cor- relation law to cover the same phenomena - but in a not altogether fortuitous fashion, as we have seen. We have in the biometrician's rela- tions to Galton, then, a case of "plus royalist que le roi": for, oddly 64. Pearson, Galton, iIIA, 80. 65. Ibid., p. 61. 66. W.

In his Hereditary Genius, he frames the problem thusly: Yet the changes are not by insensible gradations, there are many but not an infinite number of intermediate links; how is the law of continuity to be satisfied by a series of changes in jerks? 67 In his answer, Galton introduces the well-known polygon of stability, also to be found in the later Natural Inheritance. "The mechanical conception would be that of a rough stone, having in consequence of its roughness, a vast number of natural facets, on any one of which it might rest in 'stable' equilibrium." 68 When the stone is pushed, it will totter on an edge, but will regress to its first position when pressure is withdrawn. However, if a very strong push is given, the stone will be for- ced. to overpass the limits of the facet on which it has hitherto found rest, it will tumble over into a new position of stability, whence just the same proceedings must be gone through as before, before it can be dislodged and rolled another step onwards. The various positions of stable equilibrium may be looked upon as so many typical attitudes of the stone, the type being morc durable as the limits of its stability are wide. We also see clearly that tihere is no violation of the law of continuity in the movements of the stone, though it can only repose in certain widely separated positions. 69 The primacy of the continuity principle - in Galton's original stance, at least - is at the bottom of the Ancestral Law itself. It was in this law that Johannsen, for one, found the true source of the "continuity of the germ plasm" idea, usually associated with Weismann's name. Galton, who could not follow the mathematical developments of his correlation law that his biometrical followers were making, proved, like Bateson, an "anti-mathematician" in regard to stability. The continuity of the germ plasm had, by the time of Natural Inheritance, meta- morphosed into something more akin to a "mosaic" law of inheritance. But at this point, Pearson and his cohorts no longer followed their mentor's lead. Having noted all these differences, we can discern yet another source of stability's significance. It takes no great insight to recognize that Galton's analysis in Finger-Prints, for all its references to "pure breeds," is far from being identical to Johannsen's. One cannot credit Galton with a true premonition of the statistical type versus genotype distinc- 67. Galton, Hereditary Genius, p. 421. 68. Ibid. 69.

Segregation of breeds must not be confused with segregation of hereditary material. Only a Mendelian could see these two notions as intrinsically identical; and, as long as one started one's hereditary speculations from the top down (displayed char- acter), rather than the bottom up (determining mechanisms), one can- not see things as a Mendelian. What we can and must credit Galton with, however, is the concoc- tion of a notion of stability so subtle and complex that it could do without the prop of Mendelian segregation to support itself. Galton's stability was, in fact, so deceptively profound an idea that it is impos- sible to sense its scope and meaning without studying its behavior in the many fields where it was applied and elaborated by its creator. The coupling of typology and stability was the generatrix of Galton's many fertile contributions to associational and experimental psychology: thus, he analogized his composite photographs to the realm of mental imagery, claiming that "a generic mental image be considered to be nothing more than a generic portrait stamped on the brain by successive impressions made by its component images"; 70 and he demarcated the boundaries between the different"phases" of imagery correlated with a single idea or source of impressions by remolding stability into the idea of "least-perceptible differences," or quanta of perceptual gradation, which he found to be "applicable to shades, colours, sounds, tastes, and to sense-indications generally." 71 To conduct our analysis any further, we would be obliged to expand its scope immensely. We would be compelled, that is, to begin new 70. Cited in Pearson, Galton, II, 296, from "Generic Images," Proceedings of the Royal Institution, 9 (1879).

Wilkie takes arguments out of context, neglects all of Galton's many journal articles, and seems not even aware of Galton's extensions of stability to psychology. Wilkie has also no notion of what a statistical concept is: see my comments in note 30. 1 believe that, to be understood, Galton's stability must be compared and contrasted with the recent topological theory of structural stability in biology and psychology, due to the French mathematician Rene Thorm.

For to understand Galton's stability and compositive analysis better, we would have to look at the entirety of his theoretical output: its inner logic cannot be discemed through study of his biologi- cal work in isolation. To understand the biometricians' obsession with continuity better, we would be forced to examine the same obsession in the thought of Darwin, and in the fields so closely involved in the Darwinian debate: geology, theology, and - when we recall the effect of Lord Kelvin's assertion that the Second Law implied the age of the sun, and thereby the time-table of evolution would have to be greatly revised even thermodynamics. All things told, our analysis has probed to the deepest levels of the Controversy that we can hope to reach, as long as we remain without the aid of corollary investigations into many collateral, and com- plicated, questions. We have spelled out the lexicon of the points of opposition around which the debate and the conceptual development that constituted the Mendelian revolution oscillated. Our urge to make and weigh distinctions beyond those captured in such vague contrasts as continuity/discontinuity, segregation of breeds/segregation of material, and so on, has no hope of achieving satiety within the confines of the present problematic. And so, the analysis has wound down of its own accord, and must be allowed at last to die a natural death. In the words of Levi-Strauss: When the classificatory intention ascends, as it were, toward the greatest gener- ality and most extreme abstraction, no diversity prevents it from applying a scheme through the operation of which reality undergoes a series of progressive purifications, whose final term will be provided, as intended, in the form of a simple binary opposition (high and low, right and left, peace and war, etc.), and beyond which it is, for intrinsic reasons, useless as well as impossible to go. 72 72.
