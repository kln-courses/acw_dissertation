<plain_text><page sequence="1">LEVINAS, FACKENHEIM, AND A POST-HOLOCAUST TIKKUN DAVID PATTERSON Tikkun is a term that applies to making something once again hale, whole, and holy. Whether it is the mending of the soul, of the word, or of the world, tikkun generally entails the recification of barriers that prevent us from hearing God's Voice. In the twentieth century, however, there occurs a breach in thought and tradition that fundamentally occludes our hearing and alters the notion of tikkun. Prior to that breach known as the Shoah, the mending of the world fell within categories of meaning in which relationships among human beings were linked to a higher relation between the human and the divine. But with the Shoah an antiworld inserts itself into the world to launch an attack against every form of the meaning, truth, and sanctity that distinguishes human and divine being. Emil Fackenheim notes, "Throughout the ages pious Jews have died saying the Shema Yisrael -- 'Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is One' (Deut. 6:4). The Nazi murder machine was systematically designed to stifle this Shema Yisrael on Jewish lips before it murdered Jews themselves."1 Stifling the "Hear, O Israel," the antiworld threatens the hearing most essential to tikkun. The post Holocaust tikkun, then, seeks the mending not of a word or prayer or soul or world gone wrong; what is sought, rather, is a restoration of the very Origin of word, prayer, soul, and world. The post-Holocaust tikkun thus seeks a tikkun of tikkun itself, a mending of the very notion of mending. Two modem Jewish thinkers stand out in their efforts to address the implications of this problem. One we have already cited: Emil Fackenheim. The other is Emmanuel Levinas. Combining their insights, we may arrive at a deeper level of understanding this issue that is essential to the life of Judaism. 'To act for far-off things at the moment in which Hitlerism triumphed," says Levinas, for instance, "is, no doubt, the summit of nobility."2 Fackenheim, however, helps us to see that among the things most far off was the very being of those who acted. He argues, "The German resistance, such as it was, had to discover a true self to be respected The Jewish resistance had to recreate Jewish selfhood and self-respect."3 This struggle with being, Fackenheim explains, bears larger implications for our understanding of the Event: "Resistance in that 1E.

For our thought now, it is an ontological category."* The recreation of selfhood becomes not only an ontological category for our thought but also a moral and existential necessity for our lives as Jews. Says Fackenheim, "The Tikkun which for the post-Holocaust Jew is a moral necessity is a possibility because during the Holocaust itself a Jewish Tikkun was already actual. This simple but enormous, nay, world-historical truth is the rock on which rests any authentic Jewish future, and any authentic future Jewish identity."5 Both because and in spite of the Shoah, Jewish identity rests on a link between past and future, and tikkun is just the mending of that link. Levinas recognizes this point when, in agreement with Fackenheim, he declares, "To renounce after Auschwitz this God absent from Auschwitz-no longer to assume the continuation of Israel-would amount to finishing the criminal enterprise of National Socialism."6 What is at stake in a post-Holocaust tikkun, then, is the question of whether the Jews are to become the accomplices of those who set out to annihilate them. In that question we meet the task of determining the nature of tikkun after the Holocaust According to Fackenheim, it is composed of three elements: "(a) a recovery of Jewish tradition-a 'going back into possibilities of [Jewish] Dasein that was once there'; (b) a recovery in the quite different sense of recuperation from illness; and (c) a fragmentariness attaching to these two recoveries that makes them both ever-incomplete and ever laden with risk."7 The discussion that follows will be organized according to these elements of a new tikkun that Fackenheim has identified. With his insight before us, let us now explore the notion of a post-Holocaust tikkun. The 614th Commandment From a Jewish standpoint, tradition consists of far more than the chronicle of a past and runs much deeper than the accumulation of ethnic customs; beyond all this, tradition is a sacred history in which the Holy One Himself is taken to be the origin of all that is sacred. The memory that constitutes the substance of tradition is a memory of God that has God both as its subject and as its object. As a vehicle of revelation, tradition is a means of redemption. It takes hold of the past that has slipped behind us and places it before us. Thus tradition makes us contemporary, for example, with the events of the first Passover, which is the paradigm of Jewish redemption, so that the Talmud teaches us, "In every generation a person is duty-bound to regard himself as if he has personally gone forth from Egypt, since it is said, 'And you shall tell your son in that day, saying, It is because of that which the Lord did for me when I came forth out of Egypt' (Exodus 13:8)" (Pesachim 10:5). From this passage we see that tradition is the memory of God, inasmuch as it harbors God's calling forth our memory of His remembrance of us. 4Ibid., p. 248. 5Ibid., p. 300. 6Levinas, "Useless Suffering," tr.

"A Jew today," Fackenheim asserts, "feels at one with Israel if he is not himself Israeli. He also feels at one with Holocaust survivors if he is not himself a survivor. He too thinks of the blood of the children [slaughtered in Egypt]~and all talk about meaning in those grim four centuries [in Egypt] is wiped from his lips. Instead, as he reads the Tenach itself, he has nothing but that bold, powerful, magnificently anthropomorphic phrase: 'And God remembered' [Exodus 2:24]."8 On this phrase rests every prospect of any tikkun of tradition. For in God's memory of His creature lies the key to His entry into His creation. And the entry of the Holy One into the world is not only the foundation of Jewish tradition but is a definitive aspect of what might be called "the Jewish idea." As a history of the sacred, tradition is the tale of God's presence within history; without this Presence there is no tradition and nothing to be recovered in the tikkun of tradition. In this approach to God, we have a contradiction, as Fackenheim is well aware: "The 'sole Power' present at the Red Sea and Mount Sinai manifests a transcendent God, for involvement would limit His Power; it manifests an involved God as well if only because it is a Presence."9 The tikkun that is a recovery of tradition is not a tikkun that resolves contradiction. A post-Holocaust tikkun does not eliminate the contradiction but restores a link between its terms. It restores that link by restoring the commandment that arises in revelation, so that the human observance of the commandment is an expression of a relation to the divine. The human freedom thus restored by the commanding Presence draws the divine into the midst of human relation. This linkage, moreover, makes tradition the tale of tikkun and the recovery of tradition a tikkun of tikkun, whereby the mending of the world begins with the mending of what transpires between one human being and another. This between space is the portal for the entry of the divine into the human realm. Here one recalls Levinas's assertion that "'Going towards God' is meaningless unless seen in terms of my primary going towards the other person. I can only go towards God by being ethically concerned by and for the other person."10 The ethical, of course, is steeped in commandment; says Levin as, "What you perceive of God is a divine verbal message (devar elohim) which is, more often than not, an order. It is commandment rather than narration which marks the first step towards human understanding."11 The recovery of tradition after the Holocaust must begin not with the retelling of tradition (even though it may struggle to approach that) but with the commandment Says Fackenheim, "Most assuredly no redeeming Voice is heard from Auschwitz, or ever will be heard. However, a commanding Voice is being heard, and has, however faintly, been heard from the start."12 Both immanent and transcendent, the ^Fackenheim, What Is Judaism?

Perhaps the underlying cause of that alienation, however, lies not only in the profound sense of God's absence from Auschwitz but also in the human attempt to escape the commanding Voice. How all of this is tied to the recovery of tradition Levinas indicates when he writes, "The past signifies starting from an irrecusable responsibility, which devolves on the ego and precisely is significant to it as a commandment."14 The commandment that announces our "irrecusable responsibility" is what establishes the past as tradition. If we take tikkun to be a mending of the relation between the holy and the human, thentikkun happens upon the transformation of the past into tradition through commandment. Thus Fackenheim insists, "A Jew cannot take upon himself the age-old task of testifying to the divine image without believing his own testimony. In our time, however, he cannot authentically believe in this testimony without exposing himself both to the fact that the image of God was destroyed, and to the fact that the unsurpassable attempt to destroy it was successfully resisted, supremely so, by the survivor. Hence the wish to bear witness turns into a commandment, the commandment to restore the divine image to the limits of his power."15 This, of course, is Fackenheim's famous 614th Commandment. He deems it the 614th Commandment for two reasons. First, the breach in tradition creates a distance between the post-Holocaust Jew and the 613 Commandments of tradition, if only by virtue of the recovery of tradition necessitated by the dimensions of the Shoah. Second, the commanding Voice of Auschwitz issues a 614th Commandment because it opens up an ontological realm that implicates the human in its relation to the Divine. The coupling of the then and there with the here and now signifies the combination of immanence and transcendence that the commandment itself represents. What are we commanded to do? To restore the divine image to the human being and thus to draw the transcendent back into the immanent That the divine image was indeed destroyed Fackenheim reminds us when he writes, "In manufacturing the Muselmaenner-- walking crapses—the Auschwitz criminals destroyed the divine image in their victims.... In consequence a new necessity has arisen for the ethics of Judaism in our time. What has been broken must be mended. Even for a Jew who cannot believe in God it is necessary to act as though man were made in His image."16 From a Jewish perspective, the image begins with action, so that this as though is eclipsed by the deed. And the action by which I act as though I were created in His image is the embrace of the other through gemilut chasidim, deeds of lovingkindness. To be created in the divine image is to be imprinted with the trace of an immemorial past that both precedes and permeates tradition.

The post-Holocaust tikkun of tradition is a recovery of tins condition of having been created, in such a way that the Creator is returned to the midst of His creation. And the avenue of that return of the divine is the return of the human to a responsibility to and for one's neighbor. Here lies the connection between the recovery of tradition and the recovery from an illness. For the illness is the illness of indifference. The Sickness unto Indifference If the tikkun of the relation to the divine is a tikkun of the relation to the human, it is an overcoming of the distance from the one so that we may hear the voice of the other. Indifference is deafness. After the Shoah the tikkun of indifference entails a tikkun of the words with which all things begin: bereshiyt bara elohiym, "in the beginning God created," where bereshiyt signifies not the first tiling in a sequence but the first principle, the fundamental truth, of all things. All that we understand about human being returns us to the idea that God created, and that He created a single human being, from whom all others derive. The Nazi assault on the Jews was launched not only against God's Chosen but against the first man and therefore against all of humanity; it was launched against the notion and the act of Creation, of the bereshiyt, itself, which, contrary to a first cause, implies a relation of covenant between Creator and creature. "What is the criminality of the rabbinic Amalek?" asks Fackenheim. The answer: "He singles out Israel for attack because Israel is singled out by God for a covenant, his aim being to destroy the covenant as he destroys Israel."17 Covenant derives from Creation, briyt from bara, as Nachmanides points out.18 Israel is chosen for the Covenant not as a blessing for itself alone but so that "all the nations" (Genesis 18:18) may be blessed as human beings who bear the likeness of divine being. According to Jewish tradition, the Covenant that defines the relation of the human to the divine also defines the relation of the human to the human. The former is known as adam I'Makom, or "man to the Place" (since God is the Place of the world), and the latter is adam I'adam, or "man to man." And the two of them are of a piece: in both we have an instance of being-for-the-other that opposes itself to indifference. Levin as raises the question of how to preserve oneself from such evil. And he replies, "By taking upon himself the responsibility of others. . . . Israel would teach that the greatest intimacy of me to myself consists in being at every moment responsible for the others."19 This is the substance of the Covenant that Israel signifies. Just as the responsibility that issues from the commanding Voice of Auschwitz has ontological dimensions, so does the sickness unto indifference; here too tikkun is a tikkun of being. Levinas helps us to see the transcendent nature of the sickness when he invokes the idea of the "there is," or the "impersonal, anonymous, yet inextinguishable 'consummation' of being, which murmurs in the depths of nothingness itself....

It is not the dialectical counterpart of absence, and we do not grasp it through thought. It is immediately there. There is no discourse. Nothing responds to us, but this silence."20 If the "there is" can be embodied, it finds its embodiment in the SS; if it can have a "place" in the world, it installs itself in Auschwitz. This evil that threatens being without participating in it does not lie "out there" in some cosmic beyond but creeps into the intimate space between me and my neighbor. The task of a post-Holocaust tikkun is to negate this negation that begins with the distance of difference and transform it into the proximity of non-indifference. Says Levinas, "The difference in proximity between the one and the other, between me and a neighbor, turns into non-indifference, precisely into my responsibility. Non-indifference, humanity, the one-for-the-other is the very signifyingness of signification."21 It is tikkun that establishes the "signifyingness of signification." Tikkun, then, is not a sign of something but is the giving of signs. As such, it transcends the sign. In the midst of the human signification of one-for-the-other tikkun opens up a path of interaction with the divine. TTius tikkun is my one link with the I Am who determines all that I am. According to the tale of Geation, the first three questions put to humanity are: Where are you? (Genesis 3:9), Where is your brother? (Genesis 4:9), and What have you done? (Genesis 4:10). These three questions, however, are actually one question that comes to us from the God who is One. The oneness of the questions lies in the one response they call for: Hinehni! Here I am! Here I am before Thee, O Lord; here I am for you, my brother; here I am, ready to act and to answer, to bear witness and to bear the burden. With the appearance, this epiphany, of the Infinite in the midst of the relation to the other human being, difference is made into non-indifference, and the portal to tikkun opens up. This brings us to the third aspect of recovery in the post-Holocaust tikkun. The Perpetual Motion of Being-for-the-Other Thus far we have examined two facets of a post-Holocaust tikkun: the recovery of sacred tradition and the recovery from the illness of indifference toward our fellow human beings. The term that ties these two together is responsibility. To the extent that being-for-the-other opens up a portal for the insertion of the Infinite into life, it opens up an infinite aspect of responsibility. Through the approach to the neighbor the human being draws nigh unto the Holy One to realize the greatness and the glory of God; with that realization, his eyes are opened to the infinite difference and distance between the human and the divine. Hence the realization of the demand for a never-ending drawing nigh in an eternal movement toward the Infinite, a movement, which, again, consists of an approach unto the neighbor. Here, as always, this approach is rooted in a hearing, where the Voice is heard ever more deeply with every act of response. Levinas explains, "The I in relationship with the infinite is an impossibility of stopping its forward march, the impossibility of deserting its post; it is, literally, not to have time to turn back. It is to be not able to escape responsibility, to not have a hiding place of inwardness where one comes back into oneself: the more I face my responsibilities the 20Levinas, Existence and Existents, tr. A. Lingis (The Hague: Nijhoff, 1978), pp. 57-58. 21Levinas, Otherwise, p. 166. 90</page><page sequence="7">LEVINAS, FACKENHEIM, AND A POST-HOLOCAUST TIKKUN more I am responsible."22 Each movement of responsibility adds depth to the capacity for response, so that as soon as I answer, I have held something back, something more with which I may answer. For with each response I have already heard more. "Thus," Levinas asserts, "proximity is never close enough; as responsible, I am never finished with emptying myself of myself."23 This exhausting of oneself comes with the ongoing movement of oneself more and more radically into a position of ever-increasing vulnerability, where the self might break out of itself in its being-for-the-other. This breaking out of the shell of the ego's identity is just what is essential to a mending of the world. Thus the principle of identity is broken in the tikkun that draws us nigh unto the other, broken by die insertion of the holy into the human that heals the relation to both. Here, instead of having the I equal to itself, the I becomes what it is not yet; it is defined not by a fixed position but by its movement in a direction, which in turn is shaped by its mission as the one who bears one responsibility more. The post Holocaust tikkun does not set right a past but posits a future in the form of a yet-to-be that overflows the present. Thus the post-Holocaust tikkun re-introduces a messianic yet-to-be that is a mending of time itself. "The awaiting for the Messiah," says Levinas, "is the duration of time itself-waiting for God... [in] a relationship with that which is not able to enter the present, since the present is too small to contain the Infinite."24 The Good that we seek in the yet-to-be of tikkun is not our invention, not something we choose. Rather, the eternal incompleteness of tikkun and the consequent incongruity of the I that is not-I arise from the fact that the Good sought in the yet-to-be has already laid claim to us. My responsibility, therefore, consists of "this pre-original hold of the Good," to cite Levinas once more, "always older than any present, any beginning. This diachrony prevents the one from joining up with itself and identifying itself as a substance, contemporary with itself, like a transcendental ego."25 The "transcendental ego" is the One who alone can say I, or anochi, the One who reveals Himself as I at Sinai. The incompleteness of the self in relation to the other derives from this completeness of this I who summons the relation both from within and from beyond. Levinas says it very well when he writes, "The invisible in the Bible is the idea of the Good beyond being. To be obliged to responsibility overflowing freedom, that is, responsibility for the others. It is the perpetuity, or a perpetuity that would claim to be eternity.... It is the trace of a past which declines the present and representation, the trace of an immemorial past."26 The Good is neither something that suits me nor something that pleases the other. It chooses and commands, and we are forever contemporary with its commandment. The commanding Voice never leaves off, and in this eternal aspect of the Voice we have the continual movement of the tikkun that is a being-for-the-other. The problem of a post-Holocaust tikkun may be post-Holocaust, but die tikkun as such precedes itself-or rather precedes the problem, making the problem a problem. Like the commanding Voice of Auschwitz, it speaks now because it 22Levinas, Collected, p. 98. 23Ibid., p. 169. 24Levinas, "Revelation," p. 203. 25Levinas, Otherwise, p. 57. 26Levinas, Collected, p. 136. 91</page><page sequence="8">DAVID PATTERSON was heard then, spoken in a then that precedes our beginnings and determines our horizons. This realization has vital implications for the mending of a world defined by our relation to one another and by our relation to God. It implies, for example, in the words of Levinas, that "time is the most profound relationship that man can have with God, precisely as a going towards God."27 It implies further, as Levinas says, that "the other is the future. The very relationship with the other is the relationship with the future."28 Humanity—Jewish and otherwise—has no future without the movement towards the other that is a going towards God. Tikkun lies in this towards, which is to say, it lies in the ancient watchword of Jewish life: teshuvah, meaning "return," "response," and "redemption." It is the turning back that is a going towards. And it returns us from the 614th Commandment to the very first commandment: have children. Indeed, the children were the first to be targeted for extermination by the overseers of the antiworld. And they must be the first to be embraced in the mending of the world summoned by a post-Holocaust tikkun. The children were among those first marked for death not only to annihilate a Jewish future but to destroy Jewish tradition. To be sure, many texts from the tradition attest to the importance of the child both to the life of the tradition and to the Holy One whose presence is revealed through the tradition. In the Midrash Rabbah, for example, it is written, "The Sanhédrin were exiled but the Shechinah did not go into exile with them. When, however, the children were exiled, the Shechinah went into exile with them."29 And in the En Jacob it is written, "Resh Lakish in the name of R. Juda the Nasi said: 'The world would not be sustained if it were not for the breath of [praise coming forth from] the school children."30 In the Jewish tradition, therefore, die memory of the child is central to the memory of God. And in the death of the child we see Him in the throes of death. Not only is the life of humanity at stake in a post-Holocaust tikkun but the life of God as well; here too-here above ali-lies the infinite aspect of tikkun's open-endedness. Thus, "for us to cease to be Jews (and to cease to bring up Jewish children)," says Fackenheim, "would be to abandon our millennial post as witnesses to the God of history."31 Being Jews by bringing up Jewish children: can the post-Holocaust tikkun be as simple as that? Well, yes: as simple and as profound. For this bearing of Jewish children in the capacity of Jewish witnesses is just what returns us to our ancestors and their tradition. It is the key to the recovery of tradition, the recovery from an illness, and the open-ended future. 27Levinas, "Dialogue," p. 23. 28Levinas, Time, p. 77. 29Midrash Rabbah, ed. and tr. H.
