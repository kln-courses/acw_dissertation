<plain_text><page sequence="1">EXCAVATIONS IN IRAQ I975 The reports given below cover excavation work in Iraq during I975, together with a few which could not be included in the last collection of reports for 1973-4 in Iraq 37 (I975), 57-67. The information on each site has been kindly provided by the director of the excavations, unless otherwise specified, and the final version checked by him wherever possible. The sites are arranged in alphabetical order, according to their best known name. The material for this report has been assembled by Mr. J. N. Postgate, Director of the British Archaeological Expedition to Iraq, and the Editors are glad to acknowledge his efforts. They join with him in expressing their gratitude to all those colleagues who have so willingly contributed information on their work, and especially to Dr. Isa Salman, the Director-General of Antiquities in Iraq, for his generous co-operation which alone has made this compilation possible. Abu Salabikh Excavations were restarted at this Early Dynastic site to the north-west of Nippur by the British Archaeological Expedition to Iraq under the direction of J. N. Postgate, and lasted from September to December, I975. Work was confined to the main north-eastern mound, in Areas A and E investigated by the Oriental Institute expedition in I963 and I965. In Area A three IO m squares were opened in the space between the earlier trial trenches, revealing several rooms of a well-built structure immediately below the surface. The main room measures some 8o50 x 4.25 m, and was entered from the south-east corner, but as yet the layout of the building is too unclear for any specula- tion on the structure's purpose. A secure dating within ED III is afforded by pottery found in situ on the floors, and confirmed by graves dug into the building at a later date, which also contain characteristic ED III pottery, and the combination of evidence favours assigning this phase to the second half of ED III a. In Area E our chief objective was to complete the excavation of the " southern unit ". Total recovery of the plan of this building was not achieved, for two reasons: in the first place it extends further to the south and east than might have been anticipated, and secondly, the south side of the unit had been completely destroyed by a pit some IO m in diameter dug from a higher level. However, it was possible to define a corridor running along the south side of this unit, and a deep sounding at its south-east corner indicates that the complex ended here with a steep drop over which successive layers of rubbish were thrown. Within the building itself the main feature of interest was in Room 39, where at least three graves had been sunk into the floor, in two cases at least, during the I C phase. Only one of these graves was preserved intact, but it contained a single inhumation accompanied by a huge assemblage of pottery, principally i I 2 conical bowls. Other finds were a small group of tablets, presumably from the same original archive as the earlier finds, a pot with much stone and other jewellery, and various IR S</page><page sequence="2">66 EXCAVATIONS IN IRAQ 1975 A. ii' n , ......... i-',! alCHYf@*.S YARIM TEfPE n ira q , t~~~~~NIMRtID '1 g- Hatra\ 0 / {s TELL A13L HAIDAL-A A I~~AISn w t~~aghi1d ',.

Two squares opened later in the season at the eastern edge of the mound may have encountered part of a thick enclosure wall. A more detailed report will appear in Iraq 38, part 2. Babylon At Babylon among other work the Directorate General of Antiquities continued to clear out the rooms of the Southern Palace, under the direction of Sd. Ahmed al-Beyati. At the close of work the rooms south and west of the Main Court and Throne-Room had been cleared: these include the range south of the Throne- Room, numbered Rooms 34 to 36, the rooms between the Main Court and the West Court, and Rooms 37 and 38 to the north, and the entire range of rooms south of the West Court, including Rooms 40-43 and the reception suite or Saalbau. Since these rooms had all been previously cleared by Koldewey finds were scarce. In Room 40, at a height of about 2 m from the floor and above the brickwork of the south-west corner, a curious find was a terracotta " Papsukkal " figurine, whose blue paint remained in an excellent state of preservation because it had been completely encased in a bitumen lump. A cuneiform tablet was also found in the fill of this room and another in the small room between the north ends of Rooms 35 and 36; one of these was a letter addressed to the king's son. A third cuneiform tablet was found loose in rubbish during the clearance of the Greek Temple. Baghdad Construction work for the new Bab el-Muadhdham bridge across the Tigris exposed massive brickwork of the Neo-Babylonian period in the area to the north of the Khidhr Elias shrine. It had been known from the days of C. J. Rich and H. C. Rawlinson that there was in this vicinity a quay-wall built of stamped Nebuchadnezzar bricks, but it was only after the clearance of modern housing above the site that it was seen that the structures extend back away from the river bank. Within the limits imposed by the building operations the Directorate General of Antiquities was able to investigate the area, and work continued during June to August I975 under the direction of Dr. Behnam Abu As-Soof. After the removal of as much as 4 m of Islamic, Sassanian, and Parthian layers, there were revealed massive walls of baked brick laid in bitumen over an area approximately go x 6o m. There are two main units of masonry: to the south a stretch of wall 7-8 m high and 5 50 m wide runs south-west to north-east for some 24 m, with an arm projecting north-west for about I3 -50 m and pierced by a narrow passageway with steps descending towards the river. No doubt originally connected with this was the northern block, a double wall on the same alignment and about 37 m distant, but any connection is now lost. This unit consisted of an outer wall 4 - 6o m wide, separated by a relatively narrow passageway with steps leading down towards the river from the south-eastern wall which is in places 7 * 65 m and in places 6 * 8o m. in width. In all a stretch of 41 m has been uncovered, standing some 3-5 m high, and although the north-east end of the walls is lost in the river, resistance to the engineers' pile-driving suggests that they continued in this direction. Each of the two walls is pierced transversely by a well-built narrow passage, vaulted in</page><page sequence="4">68 EXCAVATIONS IN IRAQ 1975 typical Neo-Babylonian style (cf. e.g. R. Koldewey, The Excavations at Babylon (London, 1914), fig. 45); the south-eastern passageway is only I * 35 m wide but as much as 4 IO m high. The reconstruction of these remains and their purpose is hindered by the in- completeness of the plan. Stratification and the architectural techniques combine with the evidence of the inscribed bricks of Nebuchadnezzar to date the entire complex to the Neo-Babylonian period. At present we can only speculate on the purpose. The location, combined with various architectural details suggest that it is connected with the Tigris. Various possibilities present themselves: a weir to raise the water level for irrigation, or a barrage to control the river in times of flood. A third possibility worth mentioning is that this could be the eastern end of the Median wall built by Nebuchadnezzar, which ran from the bank of the Tigris above Opis to the Euphrates at Sippar. The relevant inscription specifies that the river banks were protected by masonry quays of bitumen and baked brick (see S. Langdon and R. Zehnpfund, Die N'eubabylonischen Konigsinschriften, pp. I66-7; Sumer 3 (I 947), 4 ff.) . Hatra Work at Hatra was continued by the Directorate General of Antiquities from June I974 into 1975, under the direction of Sd. Hazim en-Nejefi. Excavation was concentrated on Building B, which abuts on the north-east side of the courtyard of the Great Temple (for its position cf. F. Safar and M. A. Mustafa, Hatra, the City of the Sun God (Baghdad, I974), plan on pp. 328-9). The building, which inscribed stones from the voussoirs date to Sanatruq I, consists of three parallel iwans facing east, with a row of rooms behind them to the west. The building has now been almost entirely cleared, together with the steps leading up to the fasade. A detailed report on the results of work in the central and southern iwans is to be found in Sumer 30 (I974), pp. d-g, with Plates 2-7 (in the Arabic section). The most unusual discoveries were made in the southern iwan: there were camels carved in relief on the walls each side of the arch, the north side being the better preserved, with a mother camel suckling her young, and below them a single sitting camel with its harness. Inside the iwan on all three walls is a triple band of decoration, consisting of two registers of ornament framing a frieze of dancers and musicians, who play cymbals, tambourines, two kinds of pipes, etc. At the centre of the back wall is a relief with a goddess sitting on a chair fastened to the hump of a camel, and next to her is a figure of Fortune lying with the scales held behind her head; an eagle, a cupid, and a small tambourine player complete the scene. Below this, against the back wall, was probably a stone altar with relief decoration including ionic columns, and elsewhere was a slab showing another figure seated on a camel, and a row of camels on a lintel block. Against the temple front, just north of the large central iwan, stood a pair of statues with inscribed plinths. One is identified as " Phraates, steward of the Arab, erected by the steward of the goddess Martan ", and the second, equally well preserved, is " Abi-jud, son of Shamash-yahab, erected to him by Aqab-Shamash in A.D. i62 ". In the wall behind their heads is a relief showing a mermaid-or more accurately, a woman with a dragon's tail-blowing a pipe; this, and similar</page><page sequence="5">EXCAVATIONS IN IRAQ 1975 69 reliefs on the northern iwan, are comparable to a male figure in the Maran (Hellenistic) Temple. Against the back wall of the main iwan was an altar, but in the northern iwan there was one in the middle of the floor. Aso of interest were more than 2,000 gold pieces in the shape of hearts and flowers, presumably dress ornaments. Isin (Ishan al-Bahriyat) The fourth season of excavation under Prof. Dr. B. Hrouda took place from October 1975 to January I976 (note that our last Isin report covers the second and third seasons together), and began with further work on the Old Babylonian building discovered in 1974. The extension of the excavations for a total of some 20 m eastwards revealed in the upper levels at least five rooms of a large structure, probably dating to the early first millennium B.C., which had been cut by later graves, both double jar burials and Persian(?) period sarcophagi with rope decora- tion and handles. The structure is well built, with two building periods, and to judge from the thickness of the walls it must have been a public building of some kind. In the north-eastern corner, in a store-room, was a mass of pottery vessels of different types, which were presumably deposited here when the room was dug out at a later date. Below this the Old Babylonian layers could now be cleared further. On the other side of the street bordering the north-east wall of the main house excavated in 1974, part of another house was cleared at a relatively high level, and to the north-west of this were four rooms of an earlier phase with a threshold and associated drain leading to the street. Further to the south a baked brick, bitumen-lined drain runs along the south-east side of the original house, and receives two smaller drains on the other side, which must belong to unexcavated houses further to the south-east. Finds in this area were a cylinder seal of the third Kassite group, a haematite duck-weight, and notably a female frit mask of the second millennium B.C. Some 120 tablets from various parts of the Old Babylonian houses were mostly administra- tive or school texts, but did include letters, legal documents, and a small number of literary and lexical texts. Except for a tablet from Hammurapi 39, found in a grave, these tablets date from the first to the twenty-sixth years of Samsu-iluna. Of particular interest is the head of a cone of Enlil-bani recording his construction of a temple for the goddess dsd, otherwise unknown at Isin. Finds from the later graves include frit and stone beads and a bronze arm-ring, a gold pendant in the form of a dog sitting on a pedestal, and two knuckle bones with incised decoration. In the southern area, excavation started with a small sounding which reached third millennium levels, as in I974, and also encountered a fine group of Akkadian pottery in a grave. The major effort of this season was however devoted to the highest point of the site where walls of good quality brickwork and as much as 3 m thick indicated a building of some importance. This can now be identified with certainty as the Gula Temple, E-gal-mah, from large bricks of Kurigalzu I or II (48 x 48 x 6 cm), which were used for a courtyard pavement. Two courts and ten rooms have now been defined, with a stretch of buttressed exterior wall on the north-west. The cella itself is regrettably destroyed, but access to it was had through a gateway flanked by towers with a baked brick niched</page><page sequence="6">70 EXCAVATIONS IN IRAQ I 975 fa?ade. In front of this gateway was an isolated stretch of wall which blocked the direct line of vision through into the cella. The building was in use for a considerable length of time. From the Kassite to the Neo-Babylonian periods we have documentary evidence for building operations by Kurigalzu I(?), Melisihu, Adad-apla-iddina I, and Nebuchadnezzar II; other inscriptions not found in situ mention a Kadasman-Enlil and Adad-suma-usur, and below the Kurigalzu pavement were two stamped bricks of Enlil-bani, in front of the entrance. That the building dates back at least to the Old Babylonian period is probably indicated also by the small bricks (25 X I5 x 5 cm) of most of the walls, and in addition bricks of Amar-Suena were found re-used in a foundation box at a higher level (which contained only two small beads of gold and lapis lazuli). A yet earlier phase is suggested in Room 8, where a sounding showed that the earliest of three second-millennium levels, dated by associated pottery to Isin- Larsa, lay immediately on a wall of plano-convex bricks, presumably of Early Dynastic date. Finds in this area included terracotta plaques, two Kassite cylinder seals (one in "Kerkuk " style), a second female frit mask (with eye inlay preserved), clay and bronze figurines of dogs, and a fragment of glass with thread-decoration. Larsa (Tell es-Sinkara) The Mission Archeologique FranSaise en Iraq carried out a sixtlh season of excavations at Larsa in the autumn of I974, from October to December, under the direction of M. J.-L. Huot. Efforts were devoted exclusively to the E-Babbar mound, at the centre of the city ruins, where the clearance of a large courtyard had been begun in I968 and continued in I970. Our knowledge of this building has increased considerably as a result of this last season's work. Before its final abandon- ment at the end of the eleventh century B.C. when it was sacked and burnt, it underwent several rebuildings and repairs. The parts which can be securely dated belong to the period of Burnaburias II (I375-I347 B.C.), but these are only subsequent additions to a building of which the construction is earlier. We may reasonably surmise that this took place during the Ist Dynasty of Babylon, since it is known from surface finds that Hammurapi was responsible for building work at Larsa. Moreover, the north-west faqade of the temple was designed to take account of a variety of extant architectural features which were carefully preserved, and may well belong to the Isin-Larsa period. In this case the life-span of the E-Babbar temple would have covered virtually the whole of the second millennium B.C. At present our knowledge of the building is confined to the vestibules, the doors and staircases giving access, and the main courtyard, whose long axis measures 45 m approximately. Parallel to this courtyard another was found. Apart from the good state of preservation of the walls-which stand in places as much as 4*50 m above courtyard level-we should mention the use of spiral half-columns, placed for decorative purposes in the wall-recesses, an architectural technique found on the facades of the main gateway and the two courtyards, and strongly reminiscent of the decoration of the great temple at Tell al-Rimah. Apart from terracotta plaques and fragments of blue glass plaques (whose chemical composition turns out to be very close to the Babylonian glass already known), the</page><page sequence="7">EXCAVATIONS IN IRAQ I975 7I main finds consist of I83 tablets or inscribed objects. These are predominantly texts of the eighteenth century B.C. reflecting the administration of the sanctuary. We should also mention two tablets, dated to Marduk-4apik-zeri and Adad-apla- iddina. The catalogue of these archives has been prepared by D. Arnaud, the Mission's epigraphist. Preliminary reports, archaeological and epigraphical, will appear in Sumer and Syria, and a seventh season is planned for I976. Nimrud (I) The re-excavation and restoration of the North-West Palace at Nimrud continued during I975 under the direction of Sd. Myesser Said. The clearance and restoration of Rooms S, T, and X, on the south side of the inner courtyard continued, but unquestionably the main result of the season came from the excavation of the Assyrian well in AJ. This well had been cleared to a depth of over i6 m (from the rim) by the British expedition (see M. E. L. Mallowan, Nimrud and Its Remains I, I49-I51 with figs. 87-88), but its dangerous condition led to its abandonment at this point. This last year a winch and other tackle were used, and it proved possible to reach the base of the well, at bedrock, at a depth of some 26 m from the floor. The waterlogged condition of the soil, which made the work difficult, had also prevented the decay of the objects. Besides remarkably well preserved lengths of rope and bitumen-coated baskets, the well contained near the bottom a single fine palace-ware jar and a variety of coarser pottery. However the major find was a magnificent group of ivories: these include ajoure plaques, pyxides with lids, hemispherical bowls (sometimes called oliphants), horse trappings (including one fragment which physically joins a piece from the NN well), and a number of less usual items, such as the components of a composite ivory statue of a eunuch, natural tusks carved in low relief with animal motifs or worked into the likeness of a woman, and a remarkable shallow oval dish, possibly intended for suspension since its base is entirely covered with animal designs in low relief. Also worthy of mention is a small wooden figure with inscription of A'surnasirpal, and, from the floor beside the well, a fine shell (? tridachna sp.) with engraved decoration. Nimrud (II) The Polish Center for Mediterranean Archaeology in Cairo (Director Prof. Dr. K. Michalowski) undertook a second season of excavation at the site of Nimrud from October to December I975, under the direction of Dr. Janusz Meuszynski, and worked as before in the central part of the Kalhu citadel, in a northern and a western area (for a report of earlier work see pp. 37-43). N'orthern Area. Our activity was concentrated on the so-called Central Building of Aggurnasirpal II, the fa?ade and some rooms of which were found last season. We discovered more of the plan (Rooms 4, 5, and 6) and had some interesting finds. So for example in Room 5 were about 300 specimens of pottery vessels, placed along the walls of the chamber and grouped according to their shapes. The pottery is of the type known as Late Assyrian. Western Area. To the east of the relief found last season showing a genie between</page><page sequence="8">72 EXCAVATIONS IN IRAQ I 975 two lions, we located two bull lamassus of Shalmaneser III, forming an entrance to the building which lay further to the west, most of whose walls are no longer extant. In our opinion the above-mentioned relief formed part of this building's decoration. South-west and north-west of the relief were brick pavements and mud-brick walls, probably belonging to the building of Shalmaneser. Over this building a new monumental edifice was constructed, without regard for the existing structures: the foundations of the new walls were placed directly on the mud-brick platform of the Kalhu citadel, so that the earlier pavements were partly destroyed, monumental stone colossi partly sawn off or moved away to make space for these foundations. In our opinion the new building may provisionally be identified with the so-called Central Palace of Tiglath-pileser III. It seems that this king had no respect for his predecessors' constructions in planning his own palace. Since similar walls were found in the Northern Area, with similar treatment of the stone slabs and colossi, the new building probably extended to this area as well. On the brick pavement of the earlier building, north-west of the relief with genic and lions, were found about eighty reliefs and fragments. They all belong to the time of Tiglath-pileser III, and had already been moved from their original setting in antiquity to be re-used by Esarhaddon. The representations are of great interest, and include Assyrian soldiers carrying away statues of gods, sieges of cities, rows of tribute-bearers, courtiers, and officials, etc. While excavating we found traces of the activities of Layard, who dug some trenches in the area: known to him were the lamassu colossi of Shalmaneser III, and some of the reliefs found by our expedition (three of which are shown in the original drawings published in R. D. Barnett and M. Falkner, The Sculptures of... Tiglath pileser III...). Nippur The thirteenth season of excavations at Nippur by the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago was carried out under the direction of Prof. McGuire Gibson from September to December I975. Excavation continued in areas WA and WB, on the high part of the west mound, and a new area, WC, was opened on the low part of the site to the south-west. In WA, where several superimposed public buildings have been partially exposed in past seasons, work was extended north-west and south-east. From previous excavation, it was known that the Isin-Larsa and Old Babylonian versions of the buildings were larger than the later structures. This season, we defined the outer, north-western, wall of these levels. The rooms along it are utilitarian in character, having drains, storage jars, and so forth. In debris of the Old Babylonian period was found a very fine Sargonic cylinder seal with an inscription indicating that it was used by a scribe in the service of Sarkalisarri, " son of the king ". We may conclude that the seal was cut during the reign of Naram-Sin. On the south-east side of the area uncovered in previous seasons, a large dump deposited by Pennsylvania in the I890's was partially removed and the north-east outer wall of the Neo-Babylonian building was exposed for a further 20 m. The niching and buttressing of this part of the wall is more elaborate than that previously found, leading us to think that we are close to a corner or doorway. Future seasons will be needed to determine the full extent of the building, and those below it, but</page><page sequence="9">EXCAVATIONS IN IRAQ I 975 73 it can be stated now that we are dealing with temples, and that they are probably as large as the Inanna Temple or larger. The identification of the deity connected with the temples is still unknown. Several tablets found in the Isin-Larsa level help confirm the nature of the buildings, but do not allow a definite identification. In WB, where Old Babylonian houses and a Kassite administrative building were uncovered previously, 2 m of Seleucid, Achaemenid, and post-Kassite debris were removed over an area about 30 x 30 m, to the south and east. This revealed more rooms of the Kassite building and about IOO fragments of administrative and school tablets. The building virtually duplicates part of the plan of the palace at Aqar Quf, but is at about half the scale of that building. Among the school tablets were some of unusual type, with a few signs or an exercise running vertically on one face, and on the other face a Sumerian proverb or other literary line, running horizontally. Below the Kassite level were found the remains of another Old Babylonian house, mostly destroyed to build the Kassite palace. In the new area, WC, relatively small trenches have yielded important results. This area lies near the modern canal, south-west of the expedition house, and consists of a series of low mounds. An air photograph taken by the R.A.F. in 1952 shows a dark line in this area, which forms an angle. By comparison with the ancient Kassite plan of Nippur, it seemed that this angle marked the corner of the city wall. Two trenches laid out across the dark line confirmed the existence of a city wall I 7 s 5m thick, with baked brick foundations and mud-brick superstructure, datable probably to the Old Babylonian period. Inside the wall was found a large house of the Kassite period. The upper phase of this house seems to date to the thirteenth century B.C., since there is one tablet from the reign of Kudur-Enlil. The lower phase of the building is earlier, and the pottery, although surely Kassite, is much finer, somewhat smaller than the pottery from the Kassite building in WB which also dates from the reign of Kudur-Enlil. The finding of Kassite material from an earlier time is very important, since we know virtually nothing of the early Kassite Period archaeologically. In the fill of the lower level, there was a Mitannian seal and an Indus Valley stamp seal with a bearded humped-bull. Near WC, outside the wall, Stephen Lintner, a geomorphologist, sank pits to water-level to determine whether the ancient Euphrates flowed to the west of Nippur, as the orientation of the Kassite plan would suggest. Evidence was found of water-laid deposits, but further laboratory tests are needed to specify whether these resulted from a river or a canal. Tell Aswad (Baghdad) The fifth season, from December 1974 tO March 1975, was directed for the College of Arts, Baghdad University, by Dr. Abdul Jalil Jawad, assisted in the field by Sd. Zuhair Rajib. Work was concentrated on the area of the large house discovered last season in the north-west part of the mound, and dating to Level III. The principal feature of this building is the large courtyard (Room 5) divided by buttresses. On the east side of this courtyard was a doorway leading into Room 2, which was blocked in the second phase, leaving access to this room only through the corner room in the north-east (Room 3), which was also reached via a doorway in the eastern wall of the courtyard. In its first phase Room 5 had extended further</page><page sequence="10">74 EXCAVATIONS IN IRAQ 1975 north, but subsequently it was partitioned off by an unbonded cross wall which now forms the south wall of Room 4, a single room stretching the full width of the courtyard and reached through a doorway leading off the corridor to the west. This corridor, which had at some stage been crossed by four separate partitions, had, as observed last season, two superimposed drains running down it to the south, and it extends the full length of the building as it is at present exposed. To the west of the corridor Level II walls were cleared, revealing the Level III plan. To the north, opposite the entrance to Room 4, is the doorway of a room with four square blocks of mud-brick of uncertain purpose in its north-west, south-west, and south- east corners, and against the south wall. Under the threshold of the door, which was later blocked, there ran a drain out into the corridor. Another room of similar size further north could be reached either from this room or directly from the corridor; this latter doorway was also blocked in the later phase. To the south there is a long room little smaller than the courtyard itself; its southern end is lost, but it seems to have had no direct communication with the rest of the building, since no doors were found in either the north or the east wall of the room; below this in Level IV are interesting features to be described in the report on the sixth season. Earlier layers were investigated by a shaft dug in the north half of Room 5. Beginning from the Level II pavement, it went down more than 9 m to below plain level, but virgin soil was not reached. The levels are numbered from III to XIV; of these we can say that Levels III-XII belong to the Seleucid and Parthian ages, and that Levels XIII and XIV have yielded Neo-Babylonian sherds. Achaemenid levels we have been unable to fix with any certainty. The rooms were predominantly clean, and finds came chiefly from graves, in particular those dug from Level V into Level VI. There were two simple brick-built tombs, which contained as well as the remnants of more than one burial large two-handled glazed jars and glazed bowls. In the same level was a child's grave, formed of a single unglazed large oval jar which had been broken across the middle and then rejoined: it lay on its side in the ground with gypsum plaster over the top, and below the mouth of the jar was a model terracotta boat, with a small pottery bowl inside the jar. Another burial dug from Level VI consisted of a large oval dish (I 15 X O 75 m, o0 12 m deep) in which were bones, covered by a brick paving of rough construction, which extended as much as I .95 m in length. Tell ed-Der Excavations continued under the direction of Prof. L. de Meyer in autumn 1974 and autumn 1975, and were concentrated on the stratigraphic sounding A and on a new site (E) opened between the two main mounds of the site. The purpose of the new area was to define the relationship between the archaeological remains and the river system. Sounding A. After the work in 1973 below the central house, the five occupation layers of Level I could be cleared from around it. The artefacts recovered here will enable us to reconstruct a fairly detailed ceramic sequence for the nineteenth and eighteenth centuries B.c., and we may already state that Old Babylonian painted decoration appears only in the upper phases of the sounding, an observation</page><page sequence="11">EXCAVATIONS IN IRAQ I1975 75 which could be repeated in Area E. At certain points in this area we were able to reach Level II: the buildings encountered still belong to the class of private houses, and in this way we are able to prolong the stratigraphic sequence within a single architectural context, the phases following on from one another without a break. One interesting find was a " Humbaba " mask of terracotta, modelled at approxi- mately life size. Sounding E. The trench opened between the two mounds in I974 allowed us to identify a water-course which penetrated the site at the end of the Neo-Babylonian period or later. The sediment from this system cut into earlier river deposits. At its north end the trench touched a building, in the small courtyard of which were found sixty scholastic tablets, preserved in a little depression filled with clay. On resuming work in 1975, a larger part of this building was uncovered, after the removal of some Kassite foundations and a layer of abandonment some 20-40 cm thick. At the east of the courtyard there appeared rooms filled with debris and beams carbonized by a conflagration. Further down, on the floors and relatively well protected by the collapse of the roof, there lay more than 2,000 tablets grouped in baskets or wooden chests. Preliminary study allows us to say that these are the archives of Ur_dUtu, chief lamentation-priest of the temple of the goddess Annunitum. The contents of the texts, which are essentially economic and administrative, show that we are probably dealing with the priest's private residence. It seems to have been destroyed by fire in Ammi-saduqa's twelfth year-at least there are no later documents present. Geological investigations were continued in the ed-Der region with the aim of mapping the ancient water-courses and studying their relationship with the tells of the region. (H. Gasche) Tell Haydar The mound of Tell Haydar lies in the eastern outskirts of modern Baghdad, some 2 km to the south-east of Tell Harmal. Standing some 3 m high, it measures c. 85 x 70 m, with the long axis lying north-west-south-east. Since the eastern half of the tell is scheduled to be destroyed by building operations, the Directorate General of Antiquities undertook an excavation here from October I973 to the end of February 1974, under the direction of Sd. Mutasim Rashid Abd-ar-Rahman. At least five levels could be distinguished, but the lowest of these, Level 5, was virtually inaccessible because of the water-table. Throughout the excavated levels the overall plan of the settlement remained much the same. The main feature is a rectangular building round a courtyard; it is 24 m wide, more than 24 m in length (the south end is still unexcavated), and the courtyard measure 8*20 m across. In the northern angle of the building is a small entrance chamber, with doorways leading out to the north-east, and through the north-west wall on to a narrow street. Other rooms are ranged in a single row round the sides of the courtyard and are served by a baked brick surround. Next to the entrance chamber on the north-east side is a doorway giving directly on to a flight of steps i - 6o m wide and each one brick deep (the bricks measure 33 x 33 x 8 cm); the staircase rises to a height of 2 m against the back wall, from where it gave on to a flat landing further to the north-west from which another flight of steps probably led upwards again.</page><page sequence="12">76 EXCAVATIONS IN IRAQ 1975 The walls visible in Level 5 show that this building complex did originally extend further to the north and east, but by Level 3 although a range of rooms projecting from the south-east side of the block still stood, the remainder had been pulled down and replaced by a new, less regular, layout some 26 m in length. The street which ran along the north-west side of the main block now turns to the left and then right again, following the outer wall of this new house. Finds date the buildings to the Parthian age: horse-and-rider and ordinary human figurines, glass vessels and stone perfume flasks, and coins-mainly copper but some in silver. Three main types of pottery are distinguishable: light blue glazed wares, oval jars with straw-coloured fabric and very thin walls, and coarser vessels with light red or light green clay bodies. Graves, as elsewhere at this date, come in a variety of types: a large inverted bowl with central hole plugged with bitumen, double jar burials with the mouth of a smaller vessel inserted in the mouth of a larger one, boat-shaped clay coffins (on two occasions with lids), and a simple covering formed by two rows of baked bricks leaning inwards and capped by another row of bricks stacked vertically on their sides. Uruk- Warka Another season of excavation at Warka took place in the first months of I975, under the direction of Prof. Dr. J. Schmidt, and was concentrated this year prin- cipally on the Eanna-precinct. It was not possible to work in two major areas as usual, because of the small number of available workmen, and furthermore with the beginning of winter there had come greatly increased activity in road-building, irrigation work, and oil exploration, which forced the expedition to turn its attention to other ancient sites in the Warka region which are threatened by tllis work. In Eanna the excavations were in a relatively high area north-west of the Zikkurrat, in first millennium B.C. levels. This is an extension of the areas excavated in the north-west sector of the Sacred Enclosure in I965-66. In I970, 1972, and 1973 restricted test pits had revealed that the early Sumerian periods are here preserved relatively coherently, especially Uruk IVb, IVc, and earlier levels. There is a much lesser degree of disturbance than observable for instance in the Uruk IVa and Jemdet Nasr buildings in the same area. In addition, part of a columned building which had originally been decorated with cone mosaics had been found in Level IVc, and this may be supposed to continue into the as yet unexcavated squares to the north-west and north. This area was our objective last season, and it was investigated down to the Early Dynastic levels, giving essentially the following results. The dwelling houses which overlay Eanna in the first millennium B.C. are in a very good state of preservation, with their walls still standing very high, so that it was possible to recognize not only the individual dwelling units, but also their position within the overall layout of the city. This section of the city showed not only the organization of the separate houses but also public installations such as streets of varying importance and open spaces. A further result emerged from the typology of the houses, since the occupation of Eanna in the post-Babylonian era is accompanied by a new, non-Babylonian, house type. Finally, new data were recovered for the stratigraphy and problems of dating: these are satisfactorily</page><page sequence="13">EXCAVATIONS IN IRAQ 1975 77 elucidated by the pottery, building methods, and in one case by a kudurru fragment found in a secondary context. Of the three building levels represented in the excavated area the middle one is attested over the widest area. It can be attributed to the Achaemenid period, while the building remains a little further down, lying on the Early Dynastic levels, are to be considered Neo-Babylonian. The most recent phase, found only on the highest peak of the Eanna mound, could only be recovered to a relatively slight degree as yet, so that for the time being no dating can be proposed. The excavations also had the additional result of clarifying further the overall setting of Eanna during the first millennium B.C., in particular with regard to the enclosure walls built round the Zikkurrat in the historical period. A subsidiary task was the investigation of Temple F in Uruk IVb levels. Here once more it emerged that the three-aisled buildings, which more or less follow the classical Uruk type, are grouped round courtyards on different axes but always at right angles to one another. The walls delimiting these courtyards almost in- variably take up the niche and column motif of the temple fasades, so yielding a coherent and self-contained architectural unit. A pit in the same area resulting from disturbance in Neo-Babylonian times, reaches deep into the archaic levels, and was taken as an opportunity to follow the stratigraphy down into Uruk V levels by removing its fill. rarim Tepe The Soviet Archaeological Mission had its seventh season of excavation at Yarim Tepe from April to June I975, under Prof. Raouf Munchaev and Dr. Nicolai Merpert, and once more Dr. Nicolai Bader undertook the excavation of Tell Sotto nearby. rarim Tepe L Apart from a small area of Level V investigated at the south end of the excavated area against the east end of Building XII, work this season was in two main areas. In a strip of three Io m squares along the east side of the main excavated sector structures of Level VI were uncovered. This revealed an interesting open space which had been bounded on the west by the large complex of rooms known as Building XV, but was enclosed to the east by a semicircular wall with buttresses at regular intervals on the inner face. Against the outer side of the wall were various rooms belonging to buildings as yet not fully investigated, but clearly accommodated to the shape of the wall. The oval area which resulted had been carefully plastered and included at least one fire-place and scatters of broken pottery. Other finds which seemed to add to its individuality were part of a tortoise- shell, much burnt, and a necklace composed of no less than I75 red, black, and white beads of stone and shell. Subsequently the area had been filled with rubble from the walls, and among this rubble was a human skeleton. An interesting anthropomorphic seal came from one of the rooms north of the semicircular wall. In the southern part of the excavation work continued through Levels IO-12 to bed-rock. This encountered part of another curving buttressed wall similar to that in Level VI, and also a square platform in the lowest level, of uncertain use. An unusual globular jar from this area was painted with a red band round the neck and four large red spots evenly spaced round the body.</page><page sequence="14">78 EXCAVATIONS IN IRAQ 1975 rarim Tepe I. This season's objective was to complete the excavation of the central part of the tell to virgin soil, and this was achieved in two squares, passing through Levels 7-9. The walls of Level 9 lay almost directly on the virgin soil, at a depth of roughly 6X 8o m below the summit of the tell. That there had been earlier settlement in the vicinity is however shown by the presence of scattered Standard Hassuna sherds throughout these levels, and by a collection of Archaic Hassuna sherds which had been used in Level 8 for a paving. The architecture of these lowest levels differs little from that in the later phases. Three tholoi were identified lying immediately above virgin soil, and the largest of these measured 5 o9 m in diameter; outside it were lumps of clay with reed impressions, which no doubt came from its roofing. There were the usual rectangular structures for storage, etc., and also about six small tholos-like constructions with diameters as little as I 50 m, in Levels 8 and 9, in one of which were the white carbonized remains of a thick layer of grain, demonstrating that they served for storage. Throughout the area were pits of various kinds, in particular large conical storage pits with a well-prepared clay floor and lining. One pit over 4 m in depth may in fact have been a well. Of particular interest was the discovery this season of four more cremations, mostly consisting of a shallow pit filled with a mixture of earth and ash, on which were laid the fragmentary burnt remains. One of the cremations from this year had been placed within an oval clay-walled " oven ", but had evidently not been burnt inside it. These cremations were not as richly equipped as those in higher levels, and had with them no more than three clay vessels, also burnt. A new feature is the discovery of two separate adult skulls, which had been placed outside the buildings in small depressions, and the bones of a small child in a similar disposition. The pottery of the earliest levels of Yarim Tepe II is still within the same phase of Halaf as the rest of the mound. One new feature in Levels 8-9 is the abundance of a motif apparently showing conical domed constructions (i.e. tholoi?) separated by stylized trees; this is found on fine quality bowls, and does not con- tinue in later levels, although the motif is already attested, e.g. at Tepe Gawra. Apart from some fine stone spindle whorls and a copper stamp seal-interesting because of the surprising rarity of copper in Yarim Tepe II-the most interesting finds of this season were the human figurines. One of these is naturalistic, but the remaining four are heavily stylized, decorated with parallel lines forming a charac- teristic inverted triangle which indicates waist and groin. One figurine of this type was found at Tepe Gawra, but the new instances allow us to establish this as a definite Halaf type. Tell Sotto. The area exposed was extended this season especially on the eastern slope of the mound, where Level IV remains were not covered by much later layers, and at the end of the season an area of 400 sq m had been exposed in total. The main feature of this area was the long rectangular room of c. 8 X 2 *50 m excavated in earlier seasons. Connected to its north-east corner was a group of small rectangular storage chambers and abutting against them an oven and a gypsum-lined basin presumably for water. Also, directly to the north, but separated by an open space,</page><page sequence="15">EXCAVATIONS IN IRAQ I975 79 was a well-constructed rectangular room with interior buttresses against the long eastern and western walls, and a good gypsum plaster floor with a kiln in its northern part. From the south-east corner of the long room a wall led southwards for 5 m, and against its eastern side were three large storage jars. South of these was a construction with parallel walls with interstices some 3 x o * 50 m, and in one instance this space was plastered with gypsum and evidently a water installation. West of this wall and in other areas of Level IV not actually occupied with buildings were pits, which from their shape were clearly made while the buildings were still in use. There were also smaller oval pits with signs of heavy burning, evidently fire-places. The material from this season was almost exclusively from Level IV, and com- pletely bears out the comparison with Umm Dabaghiyah. The pottery displays virtually identical features and shapes, as well as applique decoration of the same kind and red ochre paint, and a fine jar of veined stone found this season has exact parallels at Umm Dabaghiyah. A large pottery jar contained a child burial with a necklace composed of beads in stone, shell, and, in two cases, copper. Also of interest was a miniature clay female figurine, and three clay legs from larger female figurines of a similar type.</page></plain_text>
