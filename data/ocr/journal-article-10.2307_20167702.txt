Volumetric-sectional study for a focal point of sound: superimposed increments of a wave front acoustically reflected off the concave belly of a 20-ft. sound mirror.</page><page sequence="2">An improbable dimension RAVIV GANCHROW Commentary by REMO GIUIDIERI This text will focus on a particular moment in imaging technology developments where apprehension of an object shifts from the optic model of the telescope (mobilization of a viewing point through an extension of the eye into the landscape) to the radiant model of interferometry (where the viewing point is assigned the only stable position within a fluctuating field of interacting wave fronts).1 The outcome is a shift in the relationship between sound, temporality, and perception that signals a reorientation of the site of experience. Prior to the Second World War, Britain conducted research toward the development of a national acoustic defense system. The years between 1927 and 1930 yielded the design and construction of several large scale "sound mirrors" mounted in strategic positions along the coastline of southern England. These listening structures consisted of sections of spheres, mostly made of cast concrete, ranging in size from 20-ft. vertical dishes to a 200-ft.-long curving wall, all of which were aimed at acoustic apprehension of incoming hostile aircraft. This endeavor sits at the brink of the development of radar, at the point where the glass lens is about to diffuse into electromagnetic radiation. In this case of the sound mirrors, the transformation from optics to electromagnetic echo intersects in the acoustic domain, where oscillating matter still presents itself at a scale compatible with the body. In other words, the acoustic experience of sound occurs within the audible realm, maintaining an unmediated tuning with the sensorium. I propose to cast the example of the sound mirrors as a critical threshold within the evolution of a specialized attentive practice. My intent is to highlight an alteration in the grasp of presence when a viewer becomes a listener and through it suggest the emergence of a skewed conception of space that is based on an oscillatory, temporal, and what might be broadly termed "tactile" understanding of perception. This notion replaces the linear geometry of Cartesian coordinates with a realm of concentric fluctuating patterns of interference, opening a parallel domain where what was seen before in terms of "remote" or "distant" resurfaces astonishingly close to the observer. The present survey will isolate a short period of military history at the risk of obscuring the political underpinnings that led up to those particular events; it will also avoid drawing any suggestive links (although such links may exist) to other transformations taking shape at that time within the predominant European visual cultures. This is done in order to reveal a "mechanism" that despite its apparent isolation has subsequently resurfaced in a multitude of contemporary cultural, political, and medical applications. This position by no means suggests equating a form of surveillance with more contemplative forms of observation. The example here simply hopes to locate and evaluate a threshold condition within a specialized attentive practice where all the components are still relatively reduced and therefore remain accessible to descriptive analysis. The term "attentive" is used here to emphasize a concentrated condition of anticipation, where a subject is purposefully positioned toward an expected state of comprehension. It is also a term that stresses the process of perceiving without favoring a particular sense organ. The aim is to avoid attributing I would like to thank Richard N. Scarth for sharing his expertise concerning the development of acoustic early warning systems in Britain, and Owen Layshon for his assistance in the complex coordination leading up to my visit to the sound mirrors. Additional thanks to Remo Guidieri for his critical elucidations, not only with respect to the current endeavor, but also for his seminars at the Cooper Union in New York, which I attended some time ago. I am particularly indebted to Roy Tzohar and Michaela Fruhwirth for their pointed feedback throughout the development of the various ideas presented here and to my family for their encouragement. This research was made possible with the support of The Netherlands Foundation for Visual Arts, Design, and Architecture. All of the unattributed drawings and photographs accompanying this text are my own and stem from on-site surveys at Denge and Abbots Cliff. Photographs have been incorporated into the article primarily to give a sense of place and scale. However, it is with some uneasiness that I have decided to include the drawings relating to sound itself, particularly figure 1, because they are as crucial as they may be misleading. 1. The term "radiant" is applied here to describe phenomena such as heat. It should be thought of as an expanding cloud that diminishes in intensity the farther away it gets from the source of emission. In other words, one may think of radiance as a three dimensional wave pattern, rather than clusters of straight-line rays. This should not be confused with ideas of luminosity or other forms of radiant energy that employ the analogy of straight line trajectories or spokes on a wheel, as these belong to optic analogies that stand in contradistinction to the ideas presented here.</page><page sequence="3">206 RES 49/50 SPRING/AUTUMN 2006 greater preeminence to the ear over the eye within the ongoing prosthesis of the senses.2 The military's interest in locating the limits of visibility results in an ongoing process of innovation that eventually seeps down into common use. Once within the broader social consciousness, these devices take on denser, more oblique meanings whose range of implications is yet to be explored. In this respect, a "turning point" might be more difficult to locate as a distinct moment, once these techniques have been absorbed into the public domain. That said, this example is not meant merely as an historic reiteration, but also is intended to provide insight into the broader discussion of perception within the context of a modern disrupted experience. Britain's sound mirrors Britain's acoustic defense project was primarily focused on the development of sound mirrors. These structures were conceived to operate as long-range listening devices aimed at intercepting sounds of approaching aircraft outside of the visual range. The problem the project sought to overcome was that of amplification: By the time the sound of an aircraft had reached the coast, the propeller rumble had faded to such an extent that it could no longer be detected by the naked ear. The solution was to collect the incoming vibrations, refocus their energy, and by doing so amplify the sound back into the audible range. This was accomplished by applying reflective properties of curved surfaces to large-scale construction methods.3 The early 1930s marked a peak of activity in sound mirror development. After the completion of six large-scale concrete mirrors, a proposal was drafted for an early warning network, with mirrors placed in consecutive increments every sixteen miles. The plan was to construct a "listening shield" extending from East Anglia in the north to Dorset in the south (figs. 2a and 2b). The remaining cluster of mirrors to be seen today on the shingle coast of Denge presents the most advanced stage reached in the project. The site includes three mirrors: a 20-ft. and a 30-ft. spherical dish, and a 200-ft. strip mirror wall. The latter two mirrors were to be the prototypes for the acoustic coastal network that consequently was never realized. After the mirror was erected at Denge, only one other 200-ft. mirror was built at Maghtab, Malta, late in the mid-1930s. In fact, sound mirrors never developed beyond the experimental stage of design due to the discovery of a more powerful means of aircraft detection. In 1936, successful apprehension of a remote flying aircraft by means of Radio Detection Finding (RDF) sealed the fate of the project and effectively announced the birth of radar. The end of the acoustic defense story overlaps with the early days of radar when individuals working on the mirror research were relocated to posts in the radar endeavor. It is important to stress here a kinship between the two techniques. Both radar and sound mirrors employ principles of radiation and reflection. Both establish knowledge of a remote object by intercepting an incoming signal. The difference is that sound mirrors maintain coherence in relation to the physical body. They remain aligned with the human sensorium. Sound mirrors are for the most part purely mechanical instruments, employing only the inherent properties of airborne acoustic vibration, solid surfaces, and human aural capacities.4 In contrast, radar relies on obtaining information from remote objects by means of registering the rebounding echoes emitted by a pulse of electromagnetic waves. Therefore, radar is already the point at which technology is extended beyond the spectral tuning of the senses, demanding an interface of decoding that translates the actual occurrence of an event via an electronic mediator. Only when the 2. Within the very mechanism of observation at work in the mirrors, there exists already an overlap of the acoustic and the optic, since the idea of a final "apprehending" of airplanes involves a geo optic transcription. A series of charts accompanying test reports of the sound mirrors show meticulous plotting of the flight patterns inferred from the unfolding acoustic registration that is projected by means of draftsmanship onto a bird's-eye map of the Dover straits. 3. Two main types of listening dishes were developed: one deeper, with parabolic properties, and the other shallow, of spherical curvature. The parabolic type was direction-sensitive and therefore primarily developed for use in mobile-listening units; spherical mirrors were capable of detecting sounds traveling at oblique angles to the surface of curvature, deeming them appropriate for use as fixed position sound locators. Almost all the structures built along the narrow stretch of eastern coastline were of the spherical type. The initial mirror designs were carved directly into the chalk cliffs at Joss Gap, Kent, and were already operational during the First World War. Experiments with various other methods of sound detection including listening wells and various disc configurations were also conducted at several locations along the eastern coast of the United Kingdom. 4. It is necessary to mention in this context that specialized "hot wire" microphones were employed in the largest of the mirrors at Denge because of the relative insensitivity of the human ear to the low frequencies set to be detected. The microphones, consisting of a heated wire attached to an electrical resistance register mounted within the chamber of tuned Helmhlotz resonators, provided a cross reference for the ear-witness reports of patrolling listeners.</page><page sequence="4">Ganchrow: An improbable dimension 207 Figure 2a.

All the examples of radiant technologies after this brief historic interlude rely on one form or another of an electronic interface for the processing and depiction of transmitted signals.5 It is important to note that within the configuration of the mirrors, there is already a pronounced reorientation of the listener toward a surrounding that, once having taken hold, is not fundamentally altered through the introduction of electronic or digital interfacing methods. For this reason, the actual anatomy of acoustic mirrors is of interest here. This reorientation will be described as occurring on two levels: first and foremost, in the physical positioning of the body in relation to an anticipated sound event (a position which is inscribed tectonically into the design of the mirrors); and secondly, a resultant adjustment in the listener's grasp of the wider perceptual field. These two criteria were embedded within the various stages of the sound mirror designs and became more pronounced as the project evolved. Reorientation Early in mirror testing, a single listener was often positioned, perched on a small platform facing the curvature of the disc. This configuration can be clearly seen in the Abbots Cliff mirror completed in 1928 on the coast of Kent (fig. 3), as well as in the later construction of a vertical mirror at Denge. Both mirrors measure twenty feet in diameter and are among the smallest of the fixed-version sound locators. In these designs, a concrete tongue protrudes from the base of the dish to support a listener's platform. When in operation, the mirror is manned by a single observer positioned on the platform with his back to the nautical landscape. Rising from the center of the platform is a mast-like structure that supports a swinging trumpet arm. The trumpet-shaped collector channels the sounds via flexible tubing to a stethoscope located at the end of the tubing. The detection of airplanes was established by Figure 3.

In this way, when the sound was located at its point of maximum intensity, the horizontal funnel arm, outstretched and pointing skyward, would indicate the angular bearing of the yet-to-be-seen source of the sound. The departure from those paradigms that orient the eye under similar circumstances was clearly established in this early phase of the sound mirror project. With reference to telescopic modes of observation, two complementary optical principles may be denoted: the watchtower (pushing the limits of the horizon by increasing the elevation of the gaze) and the telescope 5. Electromagnetic spectrum technologies include radio, television, cellular-phone communication, radar, and global positioning systems. Examples of ultrasonic spectrum technique are sonar, echocardiography, and ultrasound.

Two-hundred-foot mirror at Denge, 2005. (extending the gaze into the landscape).6 Both cases create a privileged form of ocular navigation. But already in the early designs of sound locators the most basic rules that govern the scanning eye undergo a crucial reconfiguration. An attentiveness that was previously oriented toward extending visual gaze outward now finds its focus in the point of contact between an incoming signal and the listener's ear. Upon discovering an airplane, the position of the body is restricted to the same location as the occurrence of the sound. Instead of extending attention outward with a mobile gaze, the listener is oriented to finding a local phenomenal occurrence. In the sound mirror, this point is articulated within the mechanism of apprehension: the confrontation (between a listener and a sound) happens at a localized zone that is sought out by physically moving the ear (by way of a stethoscope) along a pivoted trajectory until the sound is discovered.7 As the funnel aligns with a corresponding acoustic event, the ear embraces the sound at a particular point, suspended, as it were, in mid-air in front of the concrete dish (fig. 3).8 Two simple acoustic principles guided the design of the 200-ft. mirror off the coast of Kent at Denge (fig. 4): the focal properties of curved surfaces and an assessment of the acoustic fingerprint deemed critical for airplane detection.9 In other words, the concrete wall acted so as to enhance airborne sounds and was literally tuned to the size of the airplane's fundamental frequencies. Of particular interest for the design were the lower frequencies, that is to say, the rumble pitch of the 6. In the example of the telescope and the watchtower, an observer is situated in a privileged visual position in command of an expanse while maintaining a strictly frontal orientation to the objects of apprehension. Angle of view and magnification only serve to enhance the topographic comprehension of spatial relations. This frontal visual gaze remains focused on the physiognomic skin of things, finding its orientation in coordinate positions firmly anchored in the landscape. 7. "Apprehension" is used here to describe a quality of perception that is seen to emerge from a "seizing" or "capturing" of an encounter. The emphasis is to highlight perception as an active and transformative process. 8. The funnel fastened to the end of the pivoting arm in the sound mirror swings along a designated arc where, according to the acoustic principles of reflection, the sounds are to be amplified back into the audible realm. 9. The form of the 200-ft. mirror at Denge was based on conclusions drawn from experience with the mirrors that were 20 and 30 feet in diameter. The resulting strip mirror has a radius of curvature of 150 feet, a height of 26 feet, and a span of 200 feet. Its concave surface has a double curvature that is flanked at its base with an attached sloping forecourt. One document concerning the mirrors at Denge includes a chart indicating a series of aircraft models analyzed and calibrated for their specific acoustic fingerprint, denoted in terms of cycles per second. The attempt was to gauge the size of the vibrations produced by the propeller's friction with air, combined with the noise from the exhaust pipes of the aircraft engine. What is important to stress here is a thinking of an acoustic vibration in terms of the physical sizes of frequencies.

Thirty-foot hemispherical sound mirror, Denge, 2005. aircraft. These pitches were thought to have superior transmission properties over great distances, since it was believed that atmospheric absorption dampened the high-frequency components of airborne vibrations. The lowest target frequencies chosen for the 200-ft. mirror design correspond to wavelengths of 15 to 18 feet in size, which roughly bridge 60-70 Hz.10 Once the lower frequency limit was determined, the physical dimension of the wave was multiplied by a factor of ten in order to achieve the desired focal properties within the curved surface of the mirror (fig. 6). Due to the sheer size of the wall at Denge, the swinging trumpet with attached stethoscope was replaced by a mobile patrol of listeners. The listeners were organized in teams participating in an orchestrated search for sounds. The forecourt was divided into triangular patrol sectors that corresponded to a certain range of azimuths, extending out over the open sea. On either side of the structure, large canvas curtains were erected, attempting to minimize lateral wind noise. In addition, patrollers were supplied with rubber shoes and nonabrasive clothing to cut down as much as possible on the local sounds produced while walking the zones. Each triangular sector was assigned to a single listener, trained to seek out the invisible focal points of sound that were deemed to occur somewhere along a designated arc in the forecourt of the mirror. To locate an airplane meant to literally coincide with a location in which the focused acoustic activity was taking place (fig. 7). The radiant model Within this curious theater of appearance, the transition is completed from a model based on magnification and point of view to the model of radiation and interception. If the eye in a mode of telescopic vision ascertains a grasp of things by comprehending the distance between the body and a remote point of reference, then in the case of the mirrors, a grasp emerges by eliminating the distance between the observer and an occurrence. In other words, an explicitly localized event produces knowledge of a remote and still-invisible object. It is precisely in that moment that the peculiarities begin to emerge. When in operation, the mirror produces a double evocation?it reveals the airplane (as the object of apprehension) while at the 10. The estimate of critical frequencies varies in the military documents dating from the early 1930s. For example, one such document from 1932 cites a figure ranging from 30-100 Hz, whereas the frequency chart for R.A.F. single-engine aircraft indicates a 27.8-165 Hz range. Incidentally, in the case of the early single engined aircrafts produced by the German Messerschmitt company incorporated British-made Rolls Royce engines. The particular figures mentioned here are based on a quote by Dr. W. S. Tucker cited in Richard N. Scarth, Echoes from the Sky?A story of acoustic defense (Hyth Civic Society, Kent, 1999), p. 93.

Sectional diagram. same time it draws attention to the occurrence of sound in itself by placing it in a discrete location in space. When standing in the appropriate position in the mirror, the airplane emerges as simultaneously "here" and "out there." The apprehension of this sound involves a tactile interaction,11 taking place on the surface of the body where the ear meets the sound and that then gets re projected, cognizantly, back across the horizon to form the listener's knowledge of a yet-to-be-seen object. A radiant principle is at work here as an elastic property of sound extending in space and time to physically bridge the gap between observer and observed through an undulating current of connectivity. This radiant extension inherent to sound normally remains hidden beneath the instinctive capacity to localize the identified vibration back at its imagined source. When in operation, the Figure 7.

Each triangular sector, radiating off an azimuth converging point, charts a five-degree shift in the listener's horizontal orientation toward an anticipated sound. The National Archive, ref.

Acoustical Report No. 77, October 1932," in Long distance listening with sound mirrors: employment of servicemen 1932. mirror emphasizes an acoustic event (an occurrence close at hand) rather than an instance of hearing (cognizant recognition). Here, the idea of sound in its raw, still pre-cognized state as "traveling matter" and not as "appearance"12 is embedded within the structure of the mirror by considering frequencies in terms of substances and by translating vibrations into physical sizes (this is demonstrated in the scale of the mirrors whose enormous proportions are derived from the crest to-crest distances of critical frequencies, imagined to be traveling at 1107 feet per second). The angle that 11. The term "tactile" refers to a connection with the sense of touch in order to emphasize the acoustic experience as arising from direct contact with an occurrence of sound. It is also used to evoke the sense of "affecting" or "slightly modifying" by way of an interaction. Within common English usage, tactility has been limited to the sense of touch alone, therefore strengthening the idea of a separation of an onlooker from the world. For the present discussion, I propose to broaden the term to mean a multi-sensorial idea of interaction. 12. My use of the word "appearance" is intended to evoke sensation as it takes hold within any region of the sensorium as a whole. The preference is for a broader definition than the ocular connotation.</page><page sequence="9">212 RES 49/50 SPRING/AUTUMN 2006 emerges from a point of observation located within the focal zone of the sound mirror subverts the assertion of a geo-spatial realm of objects by superimposing it with the curious field of pulsating wave interaction. Interestingly enough, this frame of thought can also be found in the internal documents distributed during the period of research. In an introduction to a 400-page dossier from 1932, the author explicitly instructs the reader to abandon the dictionary definition of sound as an auditory event: Sound may be defined as a vibratory motion of matter of the type to which the auditory organ of hearing responds. It has been defined as the effect produced upon the auditory nerve by a certain vibratory motion; but this is not a convenient definition for the purpose of this book, because it will be necessary to consider the propagation of sound without reference to its ultimate detection by the ear. ... It is more convenient for the discussion of the physical properties of sounds to consider them as having an independent existence apart from the means by which they are recognized.13 Here the challenge is no longer to apprehend by means of magnification (by recognizing a distance that needs to be overcome), but rather is a matter of tuning, through a matching of characteristics. To think "sound," as opposed to hearing it, evokes the knowledge of a fluid-fluctuating counterpart to seemingly empty space. It reveals a kind of concrete abstractness that coincides with the visible, yet remains opaque to the illuminating rays of vision. This territory of acoustic interaction presents a stark contrast to the morphology we associate with our surroundings. It consists of concentric expanding shells of compression and contraction, developing radially from multiple sources. Its geometry is that of complex curves and morphing ellipses that are modified through every collision with a solid body or any intersection with other propagating waves. As these shells collide, they may cancel each other, combine to form an even greater agitation, or simply pass through one another, unaffected and indifferent. What emerges is a continuous enfolded cloud of undulating interactions. Thereby, the very idea of "stasis" remains foreign within this realm. The sonic dimension occupies the same expanse within which the body is immersed, yet it does not obey the rules of gravity. Sound's evolution is symmetric and concentric when examined from a single emitting point, but when broadened to a wider field of interactions it results in a seemingly chaotic domain of extraordinary complexity. Not surprisingly, the most pronounced geometry employed in the construction of the mirror takes the form of the radial sweep. A dossier published at the time of the research incorporates a plan view drawing of the mirror in which divisions in the sloping forecourt designate nineteen adjacent "zones," all radiating off an imaginary convergence point located seventy-five feet in front of the forecourt wall (fig. 7).14 This intersection is not the focal point of converging wave fronts, but rather a crucial hinge in the design of the mirror. It serves as the origin of measure from which the various arcs and diagonal lines composing the geometry of the structure have been derived. The "vanishing point" depicted in the diagram of the mirror constitutes a coordinate reference from which the intended azimuth readings are to be inferred. However, this vanishing point has been pulled from the horizon and assigned a tangible position within the site, namely on axis and exactly seventy-five feet in front of the mirror (fig. 8). Instead of fulfilling a task of magnification by extending toward an imagined horizon, the mirror begins to operate as a device of mediation, displacing the vanishing point to a pre-appearance idea of the world. This deviation from the rules governing optic projection, under these circumstances, derives from a redefinition of "horizon." The azimuth vanishing point depicted in figure 7 designates an un-affective pivot, forming a hinge between a device and an acoustic material. Within the physical context of sound itself, all sources are multiple, limits and thresholds lose their edges, diffusing into a continuum of exponential multiplicity. In the airwaves, there is no horizon; all activity is mutually dispersed. The sound mirror constructs a metaphoric point of convergence at the moment it anchors into the flux of sounds. It forms an intermediate projection between an expanse and the possibility of grasping. In stark contrast, the visual vanishing point operates as the cognitive pull through which various surfaces and objects get strung together in a stabilizing net of perceptions. The lines traced through 14. Each zone covers a five-degree shift in horizontal orientation toward the anticipated signal and is marked in the drawing as a series of radial lines emanating from the imaginary point beyond the forecourt wall. These lines do not manifest in the 200-ft. mirror but rather describe the rate of accuracy in localization strategies that would be determined within the nearest five degrees of horizontal orientation. The azimuth convergence point is also the center of an imaginary 300-ft. sphere from which the strip mirror derives its indentation (figs. 7 and 8). 13.

The very recognition of a visual vanishing point already indicates a re-presentation, a perceptive re-projection. It appears after parallax interpolation has had its way with the "things of the world." If the visual vanishing point and its emanating perspective can be seen as indicating a subjectively anchored point of view, then in contrast, the azimuth vanishing point does not require an observer as a referent. The 200-ft. mirror becomes its own orientation mechanism by demarcating a territory where the "distant" gets played out in a theater of local appearances. In these terms, the azimuth vanishing point of the 200-ft. mirror represents the synchronizing hinge between a particular fragment and the abstract expanse to which it relates. This idea is clearly expressed in a map indicating a proposal for a network of strip mirrors along the eastern coastline of Britain (figs. 2a and 2b). Figure 2a displays the estimated cumulative listening coverage of the entire network of mirrors by describing the geographic extents of the field opened up into the expanse of acoustic interaction. In architectural terms, the 200-ft. wall extends beyond its own tectonic form, plumbing a malleable space between the wall and a remote resonating object. The result is a structure that relates very precisely to an expanse that extends 84 degrees in width and is approximately 128 seconds long. By positioning the physical body precisely within this device of appearances, an unmistakable sequencing of apprehension is exposed, as occurrence gives way to hearing. Even though the double evocation of a sound and its corresponding referent seems to occur simultaneously, the localized collision with acoustic matter can only be read as the initial condition. The result effectively highlights the delay inherent within the process of recognition by exposing the line strung between an event and an appearance. The evident dislocation in this condition is not in the relation formed between the body and a prosthetic device, but rather, in exposing the disjunctive relation between "stimulus" and "semblance" in the process of appearance itself. The airplane is indeed as much "here" as it is "out there." In terms of a tool, the mirror establishes a stage upon which the theater of perception gets played out in minute detail. One of the paradoxes of the revealed acoustic expanse is that for the listener, the "view" never extends beyond the surface of tactile contact. This apparent .-#** vX \ \ S\ ? Figure 8.

The moment space becomes "full," it is immediately rendered opaque. In ocular terms it can only be viewed as a section, just as the interference pattern in water only reveals its form on the surface of a lake. Any window into this space inevitably fogs over, rendering the depth of this fluid flip side to appearance as fundamentally problematic when broached with optic metaphors. Nonetheless, depth? volumetric space?in this condition remains intact, enfolded within a peculiar interior-ness; a seemingly contradictory position where the imprint of volumetric relationships somehow unfold from within the surface articulations (of the vibration), from within the spacing of micro-agitations. At the moment of contact, as the notion of depth congeals, space begins to take shape, thereby separating itself from the fluid state of interactions. Space emerges from the haptic registration of discontinuities within a medium brushing up against the body.15 Radiant technologies The story of acoustic defense sits moments before an immense proliferation in techniques of communication and visualization. In 1937, just two years after radar replaced the function of the sound mirrors, the first radio telescope (a parabolic-shaped antenna) was constructed to "observe" astronomical phenomena "seen" only in the radio-frequency sector of the electromagnetic spectrum. Already here, the radiant principle exceeds an aural phenomenon, as received signals are synthesized into graphic depictions. Since the 1950s, expanding telecommunication networks and corresponding developments in visualization methods have given rise to practical techniques by which the radiant model is brought to the foreground. Today's normative modes of communication (for example radio, satellite television, and cellular telephone networks) are, for the most part, based on translations of mediums that ease back and forth between electromagnetic frequencies (hinging into fields inaccessible to the senses) and aural/visual intelligibility. The abundance of such methods is deemed transparent, judging by the extent to which we have grown accustomed to their pragmatic usefulness. Similarly, the most pervasive methods employed in scientific visualization (in many accounts providing access to previously "unseen" facets of materiality) incorporate principles of transmission and reception by which various wave phenomena are employed to construct images of remote "realities."16 What is important to stress here is an acceptance of a truthfulness, a "visualized realism" that relies not on a mimetic copy but rather on radically non-geometric modes of transcription. A preference for words such as "imaging" and "visualizing" seems to mirror this condition by suggesting pictorial methods that have ceased to mimic their subjects. When trying to define the extents of a contemporary "factual accuracy," the term would seem to answer to the characteristics of an aggregate?an amalgamation whose properties are part sonic and part optic. The translation from received or derived data into a pictorial format implies an acceptance of the authority of translative mediums dramatically different from the emulative capacities of the lens. The threshold that may have been more recently crossed is the pragmatic superimposition of the non-tangible onto the tangible through an applied knowledge of reception. Radiant perception The above-mentioned examples aim to highlight certain prevalent modalities lining social and visual communication in order to discern particular systems of restraints within which the perceiving subject may be said to operate. Admittedly, perception is assumed to possess a certain malleability where the technological is seen as one factor within a multitude of forces shaping a momentary context of perceptual conditioning. It is never the sense organ that is modified through history; instead it is the cognizant posture that is continually restructured in relation to established codes and habits. 15. My use here of the term "haptic" is not in the sense of "close proximity" as this would still assume (by posing a duality) the existence of an apprehension of "the far." Rather, I'm trying to highlight a condition that only operates through connectivity?where entities are linked. Any idea of "far" should be seen as an outcome of this initial tactile engagement. My emphasis here is on a radiant perspective by which perception is understood to be unfolding within a broader tactile field of interactions. This relationship assumes a doubly active position: the active potentiality of a stratum coupled with an active process of discovery and recovery from traversed surfaces. 16. Tomographie techniques, such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging, are able to construct a sectional image through solid bodies by way of interpreted resonant vibration of hydrogen atoms. What the imaging component of the device receives is the emitted signal from hydrogen molecules that get "decoded" by way of a Fourier transform and then are plotted onto a two-dimensional image.</page><page sequence="12">Ganchrow: An improbable dimension 215 sss??^r --.-?^if.'-'.s't' -.'.

Any attempt at mapping the influences shaping the current site of perception reveals a multitude of communication practices and representational methods within which the perceiving subject is enmeshed. I am proposing here an ambivalent approach that attempts to avoid the binary polarization of progress versus decline through an attentiveness to the glitches and transparencies arising from a technological confrontation. This view speculates that "ways of doing" are still partially accountable to "ways of seeing," though, needless to say, in an oblique manner that no longer holds tools to be self-evident derivatives of anything but themselves. In the example at hand, the plurality of adjusting circumstances may expose "ways of doing" that begin to clash with, and potentially amend, predominant ideas of perceiving?a complex intertwining that exceeds an analysis of a mutating visuality. One limitation that arises from visual accounts of perception is the assumption that the ocular is somehow symmetric with the sensorium as a whole. The problem is that visibility relies on the same optic plane of appearances?be it microscopic, fragmented, or even as understood to occur dislodged from the perceiving body. It is, namely, the geometric realm of spatiality appearing through various lenses of deformation. I would like to suggest that there is something more peculiar than a "distortion" that begins to take shape through the radiant model. Distortion relies on an implicit space "as it should be," an implicated intact physiognomy of place from which to derive a current state of decline. Radiance is, for the most part, an inevitable blind spot in the semblance of visual appearance; by way of analogy, the ocular remains trapped in the optical illusion of a mirage by recognizing only a disfigured landscape and never grasping the emanating heat. Returning to the initial example, if the "flip" presented through the condition of the sound mirrors is a reorientation in the thinking of "grasping," it could be understood as a shift within a mechanism of appearance itself, and therefore does not necessarily remain restricted to an aural phenomenon.17 What is at stake 17. The tactile position is more easily exposed in sound, as, for example, in the phenomenon of echo. In echo, the time elapsed between a repeated utterance indicates the path navigated by a sound traveling to touch a distant surface and return. The relative slowness of sound, approximately one million times slower than that of light, in this case draws attention to its own movements.</page><page sequence="13">216 RES 49/50 SPRING/AUTUMN 2006 with the radiant position is a potential amendment to an epistemology of cognition that could uncover a more subtle and, it should be emphasized, preexisting level of experience that is subsequently replicated in the anatomy of widespread techniques. If we were to extend the idea of tactil ity to a wider "haptic" field of interaction, then vision too takes on a different articulation. A haptic dimension in vision might be revealed by taking up the obsolete model of the camera obscura, and shifting the emphasis from the picture plane of projection to the puncture of the pinhole. In this respect, the pinhole or aperture presents the most radical proposition in the mystery of dimensions as the point at which the sky meets the ground in a vortex of interaction. Within the opening of an infinitesimally small hole separating the inside from the outside of the camera obscura, all of the exterior world is momentarily compressed into a tapestry of undulating light fields, thrust through the pinhole as a bundle of a yet-to-emerge landscape. This "moment beforeness" from which all that will become familiar remains momentarily inaccessible, foreign, and indifferent to our notion of "thing-ness" is the very knot from which our visual field eventually unfolds. Any ideas of "near," "far," "shape," or "distance" in this position are still encrypted possibilities yet to be unlocked through a complex pattern of interactions. Such a condition inevitably draws attention to that which was always present yet remained hidden beneath a shroud of coherent "thing-ness."18 It is under these terms that the perceived materializing of distances into depth-of-field emphasizes the unfolding of "experience" as an inborn assembly of comprehension where spatial clarity is deemed an elementary meaning-reflex, able to unite the vast knotting of multiple projections. To this end, the appearance of color upon which the creasing of perspective lines gets enfolded presents a reconciliation with micro-fluctuations: a reminder that even the most still and solitary glance at a seemingly stable surface is inextricably infused with an underlying temporality. It then follows that the eye that was thought before to operate through a complex gauging of distances between points of view and a relatively stable geo spatial expanse, now is itself in a constant state of apprehension from each registered moment to the next. The outcome is an adjustment to the notion of "expanse." Space, previously conceived of as an outcome of the network of relations between dispersed objects within a visual field, is foreshadowed by the space of the interval itself?in other words, a registration of the micro-spacing between successive fluctuations that constitute an ongoing pulsation of appearances. Within this particular joint, the separation between near and far is eradicated, opening up a continuum where stasis and movement begin to fuse one into the other. The transition is toward a dynamic understanding of radiant form in which any differentiated shape inevitably emerges entangled within the grips of time. The notion of the haptic field, in its explicit bond with time, provides the potential to reevaluate the constituents of dimensions and temporal relations. It suggests certain sensorial parallels within an individual's unfolding experience as emerging from an interaction occurring within a contact with materials that are oscillatory in nature. The apparent dissimilarity between properties of sound and light can suddenly be reconciled from within this vantage point as events that inherently possess a kinship through their precise spacing in time. When confronted with the knowledge of continuously adjusting relations, the fixing of the field of sensations into perceived distances, colors, and tones occurs as a secondary effect that somehow gets instinctively re-projected outward to appear as an external attribute. Consequently, the experience of expanse and form appears as a collapsed and reconstructed phantom of tactilely traversed intervals and durations. The very nature of appearance begins to emerge as an enigmatic ability of projective translation. Within every moment of apprehending, there seems to exist an undisclosed motor of creative construction at work. This position signals a profound attentiveness to discontinuities, the spacing between successive pressure zones in air, the micro-fluctuations between crests of electromagnetic waves and the distance separating one obstruction from the next on a gravitational surface; these all form the critical inconsistencies from which the realm of perceived spaces emerges.19 18. I would like to emphasize here the very rapid nature of the constructed experience, a condition that effortlessly delivers the assertive physiognomic qualities of things. What is relevant to the radiant point of view is an exposure of the foundations upon which the thing-ness of experience takes hold. 19. With respect to music and perception, I am stressing the fact that even the recognition of a single tone is already bound to an inescapable temporality. Here, I am focusing on a much smaller scale of interval lie fluctuation than that of a melody: for example, the relationship of a numeric frequency (the measure of fluctuations per second) to a perceived pitch. Tones, colors, and distances appear as curious forms shaped within perception?that vital spacing that lets 440 nm (of electromagnetic activity) emerge as "indigo," 440 cycles per second (of acoustic activity) to emerge as the note "A." Within</page><page sequence="14">Ganchrow: An improbable dimension 217 The haptic position and the implicit interference expanse emphasize the dense fog of activity within which the apprehending body is submerged. It presents a hinge where both occurrence and semblance are played off one another, on the one hand expressing a distinct interconnection and on the other a curious contradiction. "Grasping" is exposed here as a peculiar mending agent able to reconcile the seemingly opposed notions of motion and stasis. Thus, space appears less as a set of relations that results from a shifting point of view through time and more as an enigmatic collision with time. Under these terms, a grasp of surroundings seems instinctively to emerge from tracings left on the perceiver by the very nature of time itself, where the sediment of experience is accumulated from a contact with the emissive echo of things. Yet despite the implied intimacy, one of the strangest ideas to emerge from the haptic position is that it reveals direct experience as being located in a realm at least twice removed from the possibility of ever knowing the actual nature of things. Appearance as the semblance of activated potentialities knows its subject only by way of projections. Implicit in the radiant model, as mentioned before, is a juxtaposing of appearance with its fluid flip side. Superimposing the sharp contours of geometric intelligibility with a realm of gradient fog results in a weakening of the authority previously vested in a presupposed physiognomic coherence. This superimposition opens a view that exceeds the apparent "naturalness" of appearance. Within the backdrop of those cultures that are deeply rooted in figurative representation, the chaotic oscillation of matter might appear as a virus invading the anthropomorphic body of meanings. In other words, the radiant model and its haptic view could be creating ripples through our culturally accepted assumptions of "form" by recasting the idea of "limits" and short-circuiting the dichotomy of stasis versus movement: a situation with potentially important implications for a cultural capacity to construct significant forms. In this respect, problems expressed in discussions of perception and modernization?the disembodied gaze, rifts and disruptions within the perceptual field, and the inconsistencies of space created through implementation of non-localized communication networks?may be seen as stemming from a reluctance to abandon a model of space that still clings to the analogies of the lens, a position securely anchored within the certainty of axial geometry and coordinate relations. If there is a disjunction or rift to be discerned, it is not so much in the dislocation of perception from the perceiving body as it is in the predisposition we have vested in the thing ness of the world. To this end, the current condition may highlight an inevitable clash between an emerging understanding of form and previously established modes of descriptive comprehension. Commentary by Remo Guidieri To a conspicuous extent, late modernity dating from the Great Transformation (or Great Butchery) converges toward a perceptual jumble of complementary fields, each phenomenally distinct, that experimentation would undertake in order to range and compile them. Such a process of amalgamation brings with it repercussions in techno-economical development and, fatally, in the way we live with them "domestically." Mind and the entire spectrum of messages brought by pathways for the most part incontrollable and efficient ("unconscious") are compelled, contradictorily, to recognize and grant admittance to the incongruous. Surrealism considered this realm if not familiar, then at least plausible, attesting to the domain of the phantasmagorical, revindicated as liberation in times still "utopianly humanist" (or optimistic if only by virtue of ingenuousness).20 What took place was the opposite of such "Utopian humanism." Modernity, at all times on the brink of being "mature," while allowing nothing to become complete any longer, keeps rediscovering archaic modes of submission toward that which embodies plausibility and certitude and yet is deprived of the support of belief. We undergo a credulous primitivity that carries us into the condition of voyeurs of phantoms, more de Chirico esque than pagan or monotheist. Ancient or merely these parameters there is a potentially useful broadening of the definition of space as an emergent property tuned to various scales of discontinuity. An exploration of this view demands a more rigorous evaluation of the constituents of space that remains beyond the scope of the current investigation. 20. What's at stake in this case is the capacity of wonder, the state of grace proper to childhood. It is impossible to overstate the extent to which this source in itself is not aesthetic but pragmatic. The same thing goes for the commodity as for the archaic fetish: They are forms, but only insofar as they are means, utensils. A separate discourse could be made on Futurism's testimony of enthusiasm for technology, which Surrealism, with the exception of perhaps Bataille (a latecomer to Surrealism) seems to generally ignore. Apart from the political implications that had an outlet in Fascism (but not only there, vide Russia), Futurism evinces the transformations occurring in perception (above all visual) due to technical development. All of which is far from being simply anti-traditionalist as Marinetti's manifesto purported. The supreme example is Boccioni.</page><page sequence="15">218 RES 49/50 SPRING/AUTUMN 2006 exhumed, syncretic, the in-saturated image amplifies the stage. We gather all sorts of presences dislodging them with instruments that relentlessly place them under scrutiny. The eclipse of the divine comes to project shadows upon the murky bottom. We gulp deep draughts from this font, despite the profound skepticism of our times: we are skeptical and credulous in a socius drenched through and through with presences. This eidetic duplicity through which the archaic penetrates into the modern is much more remote and primordial than the fascist experimentation of the first half of the last century, which was linked ideologically through various leitmotifs to the era of the First World War. Their terrible collapse forever condemned the recourse to myth and had made Europe into an epilogue. Thrown into an archaic without myths, we are cut off from any form of epic. We are archaic in the midst of modernity. From the former, we derive our common gregariousness?the "organique," but without any myths?from the latter, we inherit our lives that overflow with apparitions forged by technology. Maitre d'oeuvre, the avant-garde, or (as Raymond Aron called it) the "imperial republic," could well repeat after Prospero: Now my charms are all o'erthrown, And what strength I have's mine own, Which is most faint.21 Modernity is victim and artifice of peculiarly monstrous Montages bred under the aegis of thought that promotes the rhizomatic growth of mediation and, thus, of alienation.22 An anamorphosis of the pharmakon, at once remedy and poison, has gigantically expanded. The interminable taking advantage of this circumstance is probative, insofar as its effect accentuates what for some is de-naturalization and for others is a positive increment of the real: The self prolonging of development whose vitality is attested by the cleaved overcome or on the verge of so being. Spiraling stages Their increment testifies to the dynamis, or rather, to the never-dwindling force that is, at least, tributary of the techne to which man has succumbed. Denaturalization endowed with the same principles of the "human nature of man": the occupying of historical time with those faculties necessary for remaining there. Since one is the flip side of the other, we can picture the process as a single enormous Moebius strip. With a simple twist, the bundle obtains two faces, each separate yet continuous: development and de-naturalization. It would be reductive to consider it a chiasm of insurmountable and collusive polarity on the order of eros and thanatos. The process no longer corresponds, even metaphorically, neither with the ontological duality of progress and decline, nor with representations (whether current or modern) of history, presented in evolutionary or catastrophic terms. It is thus impossibility, which delineates the decline of the messianic in late modernity.23 An unfolding knowing-no-end and sundering (thus also refuting) the ring of the eternal return-of-the-same in terms that were presented under diverse guises by Junger and Heidegger (and later Lowith) during an era over a half-century ago when the already mature process was still restrained by the conservative break-pulling and the totalitarian experiments with the "hope principle" between the two wars. This phase is concluded. The technique of modernity is a-theological (as well as a-teleological by reason of its being indefinite: Each initial attempt today is forward oriented; the present in and of itself is nothing if not 21. William Shakespeare, TheTempest, epilogue, lines 1-3. 22. Understood in Hegelian terms, this basically says: "The sphere of spirit at this stage breaks up into two regions. The one is the actual world, that of self-estrangement, the other is that which spirit constructs for itself in the ether of pure consciousness raising itself above the first. This second world, being constructed in opposition and contrast to that estrangement, is just on that account not free from it; on the contrary, it is only the other form of that very estrangement, which consists precisely in having a conscious existence in two sorts of worlds, and embraces both. Hence it is not self-consciousness of Absolute Being in and for itself, not Religion, which is here dealt with: it is Belief, Faith, insofar as faith is a flight from the actual world, and thus is not a self-complete experience (an und f?r sich). Such flight from the realm of the present is, therefore, directly in its very nature a dual state of mind. Pure consciousness is the sphere into which spirit rises: but it is not only the element of faith, but of the notion as well. Consequently both appear on the scene together at the same time, and the former comes before us only in antithesis to the latter." G. W. F Hegel, The Phenomenology of Mind, trans. J. B.

It opposes itself to ancient and pagan figures, taken in an anti monotheistic chord by Nietzsche. The enormous energy of violent forms throughout the century shows the extent to which nihilism contains the anticipation of an overcoming of the very figure by which it is represented. New accoutrements?and telos?serve to declare the circle shattered. Such is la passion du r?el of the century upon which the sun has so recently gone down, to use the formula of Alain Badiou, overlooking how much of the tautological such passion contains and has already more than adequately manifested.24 Mediation breaks down and overcomes dissidences, thetic as well as phenomenic: It invests the incompatibilities of the most banal experiences, gaining force in the modification of the human ens and its faculty for considering itself unique (finite) and multiple (infinite). The same holds true for perception of sound as well as that of sight, and not merely for those who observe the pan-esthetic in which to wallow willy-nilly while taking up the chorus of Gottfried Benn: "Looking around I see only sociology and the void."25 Foreshadowing of such an orientation exists in the scenic, this is to say, ludic, sphere, which is also the realm of the equivocal (the true and false having only persuasive necessities: to implicate participants in a play whose place is that of the computed Einf?hlung or groupe en fusion, ossified in a hall where a pseudo-rite is consumed). These qualities are already spectacularly identified in the Wagnerian Gesamtkunstwerk, the working qualification of which has been, in its intentions and its results, overcome (even if, musically speaking, this overcoming remains ineffective as much as that of the metaphysic announced by Nietzsche). We remain on the brink, awaiting a watershed to be forded, rootless and on unsure footing. We fall back upon instincts more ethological than eidetic. It was to this idea that Heidegger referred, declaring the metaphysical word and conversion from categorical entity, revealing the process that causes its upheaval?the process, unsuitable to the restitution of that which, in the ontic sense, no longer exists. The detachment of entity, at this point almost entirely artificialis and "muffled" by artificiality regarding the category to which it would correspond, is no longer to be located at the noetic base of signs but in the fatal push to the enforced nomadism of language and of things. In a similar historical instance, our perceptions could call forth an echo, amplifying an alchemical (and far from mystical) project-in-effectuation, exoteric by reason of its being flaunted on a scale both micro and macro, "a-gravitational" (if one wishes to lend an ear to how much Peter Sloterdijk pursues it with involuntarily Dalinesque philosophical countenance) in this frenetic time of Lenten spectacularity. There is no question of harmonizing these perceptions?they are already alive in various ways?but rather one of enlisting them in a project of exploitation where, between reciprocal collusions and contaminations, one is called to serve the other. Vast aberrant couplings are rendered "judged" to the extent to which they are usable: The result must produce new paradigms, new possibilities of initiative. The example Raviv Ganchrow provides is summarized already in the title, "The Improbable Dimension." An adjective prone to contradictory intentions and demonstrating the fertile ambiguity of grand doubts; a quest that disembogues in the imposing ascertainment of the unsurpassability and of the arbitrary nature of fundamentals,26 which otherwise increase the number of rhizomatic possibilities of trouvailles having instead pragmatic and, ? la lettre, unqual?fiable pragmatic consequences. Enough can never be said regarding the extent to which the ultra-metaphysic already bears a name and prolegomena whose effects are those of the pataphysic.27 The unusual is but "functions." It experiences "concrete irreality" of the object conceived and produced not by human hands but by machines. But irreality is also id?e en conserve: if not a thing, a presence.28 Expanded projection jostles, deforms our factual relation with the entity (to the same extent as we 24.

On a more ample and totalizing scale, it is a question for relativizing noetic fundamentals: space and time. 26. When doubt goes in pursuit of questions without pragmatic solutions, they are failed messianisms like the cargo-cults of Melanesia (my view also of Kafka). 27.

The source is not only remote but increasingly separate. Thus, the variations of robotics that make up for pragmatic human faculties capable of implicating themselves in causes that have rendered these faculties possible in the first place are oriented toward the invasion of real space in order to saturate it with tangible "schemes." Both the source and effect of this occurrence is ready-mades. The ready-mades forge a style, albeit the style of their circumstance. An eidos of pure virtually, an "idea," recognizable merely as object presence, "ou moins ambitieusement d?crit... un univers que l'on peut voir et que peut-?tre l'on doit voir ? la place du traditionnel ?tant de correlations d'exceptions aussi, quoique plus fr?quentes, en tout cas de faits accidentels qui, se r?duisant ? des exceptions peu traditionnelles n'ont m?me pas l'attrait de la singularit?."29 An eidos that would overcome factuality and imposed obstacles. Thus, it also happens, in a space exemplarily defined (that is to say closed) for bodies in pictorial representation that with the avant-gardes of the last century were supposed to capture movement (which is to say duration), taking turns at the insuperable hub of space and time. From problematical objects the bodies represented became objects of paradox.30 The internal and the external, the full and the empty are the basics here. The presence passes through reflexes. Sound does so as well. It does not flee projection. De Chirico set forth, prophetically, the oppressive character of these fundamentals or at least their relativization. To call them "dimensions" is metaphorical. They are poles of an inexhaustible symmetry.31 The exposition of Ganchrow, in some way, demonstrates a third, attainable and highly fertile pole, in keeping with the formula "three is more than the succession of one and two." A sum (1 + 2)? That, too, but first and foremost, a leap: This notion [of radiance] replaces the linear geometry of Cartesian coordinates with concentric, fluctuating patterns of interference; a parallel realm where what was seen before in terms of "remote" or "distant" resurfaces astonishingly close to the observer. Radiance has to do with movement from which is distinguished near and far (rendered audible/non-audible) reflection in the instrument that mirrors it. "Beyond the limits of the visible" the realm of the virtual is entered. These realms must, however, have effect, or, in other words, usefulness. The (optical) illusion re-enters the history of mimesis in particular with conversion from volume to bi-dimensionality. In what manner are we then to understand the "concentric, fluctuating patterns of interference"? Ganchrow writes: "A radiant perspective where the perception is understood to be unfolding within a broader tactile field of interactions: an active potentiality of a stratum coupled with an active process of discovery and recovery from traversed surfaces." It travels on the surface and operates by means of connections between presences, that is, volumes. The proximity rendered by the instrument does not explore the near and the distant.32 A sort of zero-set in the gathering of measurable distance with the poles close-at-hand/far-off. A passage from "the linear geometry of Cartesian coordinates" to an "oscillatory, temporal, and tactile view of perception" implies that Cartesian space consists in orthogonal disposition and in complexity.33 But is such a distinction appropriate? The geometric configuration before and after Descartes excludes basing itself on the separation between the sense of sight and that of hearing. The essay speaks precisely about such fertile inbreeding. If not ideality (id?alit?), then geometry projects as much as it subordinates itself to visual perception. This is true, even if in astronomy, before and after Newton, the non-perceptive included perception through a lens (which takes advantage of the glass which-corrects). It is deduced with a medium that is neither visual nor auditory, but rather mathematical, that is, calculable. 29. It was the case when this "idea" was artifice of that, which belonged to heroes. Prior to this, it belonged to the effigy of the god: the ubiquitous god. It possessed specific ontic presence. (Jarry [see note 8], pp. 31-332.) 30. Long before ludic tendencies of Dada and Surrealism, in part represented in the project of the Large Glass that features "l'objet abstrait, invisible . . ." Duchamp thinks four-dimensionally: "[L]ieu de l'accouplement erotique [ou] vagin et penis perdent ? l'instar d'une illusion anamorphique tout caract?re distinctif." To this description, I would add what Marx called phantasmagoria, insisting on the phantom. 31. It would seem that only mania, divination, and death can ' eradicate them. 32.

Such aspects include the non-geometrical reception by means of sound in construction of the instruments herein described. From a source-origin there issue forth vibrations ("waves"). Prior, the role of source belonged to the eye. Prior, there were light and shadow; now, there are vibrations. Visual perception established itself esoterically from perspective. For architecture that precedes, whether ancient or gothic, cannot be considered ignorant of such theoretical or technical problems. It arises in the architectonic edification of volumes, in methods remaining as arcane as geometry (in the initiatic sense), geometry that exists in the ambit of the Pythagorean selective vision that privileges one eye rather than two. Such "incompetence" merits a comment on the holism of perspective representation in the Florentine matrix and reveals the place for whatsoever is thereby rendered representative: It is not to be accomplished, except at the price of omitting the duplicity of source. Concavity instead of linearity. Visual perception is far more complex than this: It is "a vortex of pulsating radiance," writes Ganchrow. Retracing technological innovation in preamble to a reform of perception, Svetlana Alpers described another specularity in nuce as it arises with the undertaking of the lens in the times of Descartes. This seems to echo Roberto Longhi's comment on the figures of Titian "who leaves the breath of a moveable essay of a life in flux and in increase," that is, always before.34 The Venetians were fully conscious of exploring precisely this light, dissolving fatally the Apollonian fable of Tuscan Umbrian painting that reached its peak in all probability with Piero (the sfumato of Leonardo and the reiterated incompleteness of his works would indicate the gradual skepticism that contemporary exponents of mannerism in his time rekindled to the bitter end). Space as discontinued, intermittent, spouting from multiple sources: "magnetic fields." It would be welcome, as Ganchrow suggests, to take into consideration the expansion of multiple focality as the impulse behind the perceptual heterogeneity where all is reducible, but where also, except in pragmatic use, the phantoms are admitted as virtuality to be activated. It is an enormous question. A question concerning the current situation, the "historical block" of modern perception can be posed as follows: melted or liquified? To what model does this question harken back? Does this choice present us with a victorious recourse to a rising fluidity? Does it unhinge confines by placing trust in the "radiant model" of reconstructing the issue perceived from field-to-field boundless universe? The question would be once again posed on the bellicose industrial scale, tangibly resuming the meaning of prelest' o? Pavel Florenski: the "blunder," that "error fiction," that "vision emerging from the confines of the visible world and from the invisible world, the Master says, an absence of terrestrial reference" to which these "husks" would correspond; that klippoth of the Cabala; those voids that deceive by demonstrating themselves as fraudulent; the Latin corpus astral is, the insubstantial imprint left by death?in fine, the Suprematist objects that are no longer "art objects" but tracks. The question can be posed as follows: visibility and/or legibility, or "comprehensibility." The way of perceiving or receiving (that is, to gather in what is perceived) is intended as "making sense." Geometrically, the sense is visual and immediately recognized as such. The figures are "natural." The magmatic has no basis in geometry. Every figure is a projection of another; shadows are not only included, but also become dominant. "Radiance" (but to be also intended as "brightness") in some way possesses kinship with the "effulgence" of Rothko. A question of color is that of light, the spatial perception given by geometry (and, therefore, also by perspective) make it an original architectural procedure to the degree that color has a subaltern role in construction: lines, volumes are considered as homogeneous spaces possessing pre-emptive coherence. In the non-geometrical space, the perceived mass is deduced by means of instruments, through elements that possess non-visual origins. Through these means we visualize the remote, the invisible. It is possible to derive from these visualizing methods a menacing invisible, captured by rendering the mirror a captor. The acoustic reflex copies visual presence. In such a way, the reflex regards bodies, masses in motion.
