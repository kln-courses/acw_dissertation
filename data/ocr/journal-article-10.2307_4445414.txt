<plain_text><page sequence="1">Botany INTRODUCTION TO PLANT SCI- ENCE: A HUMANISTIC AND ECO- LOGICAL APPROACH, by Norman H. Russell. 1975. West Publishing Co. (50 W. Kellogg Blvd., St. Paul 55172). 302 p. Softback; price not given. This is a textbook written for an introductory course in botany for nonmajors. Its format is basically the same as most traditional botany textbooks and many of the chapters would be interchangeable with such a book. Yet there is a freshness per- meating the book that should be em- phasized. Each chapter and many of the top- ics within the chapters are intro- duced by poems written by the author. For example, "Fall Coloration of Leaves" is introduced by the follow- ing poem: they are going to the pow wow how beautifully they dress the trees below the mountain red yellow all the colors they are going to the pow wow they are dressed up for the dawning after the pow wow they will take off their clothes they will sleep The chapter on evolution is also interesting in that an epilogue is in- cluded in which the author presents twelve objections to Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection. These should provide fuel for much debate among biologists and students. Three chapters are outstanding: "The Green Revolution," "Plants Used by Man," and "The Future of Plants." The last is unusual in that it deals with weeds and the problems encountered in trying to determine what is called a weed and what isn't. Throughout the book there is a great deal of anthropomorphism but much of it seems to enhance the flow of the text and makes the book more readable. One gets the feeling of being involved with plants and plant science. The book is not without some draw- backs, however; the illustrations are black-and-white and very small, so they are hard to interpret in many cases. Also topics that one would expect to find in an introductory text- book are missing or greatly reduced. Respiration, for example, is dealt with in one paragraph which basically defines the respiratory equation. This book would be especially good for an introductory, nonmajors course in botany, as was intended. It is highly readable and one of the most unusual textbooks available. Dean A.
