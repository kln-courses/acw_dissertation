ABSTRACT This paper discusses the development and prototype construction of a powered hand exoskeleton that is designed to fit over the gloved hand of an astronaut. The exoskeleton is designed to offset the stiffness of the pressurized space suit and keep the productive time spent in the space suit from being constrained by hand fatigue. The exoskeleton has a three-finger design. The motions of the hand are monitored by an array of pressure sensors mounted between the exoskeleton and the hand, and the resultant controller commands are determined by a state of the art programmable controller. These commands are then applied to a DC motor array which power the device. INTRODUCTION The development of machines which can assist people in overcoming the physical limitations of the human body is of great interest in many different areas. One area where exoskeleton development could prove useful is in assisting astronauts in performing extravehicular activities (EVA). The current NASA EVA gloves must perform a number of critical functions, including environmental containment and protecting astronauts from the harsh space environment. The EVA gloves must satisfy these criteria while remaining flexible enough so that astronauts can perform useful work. To date safety and durability considerations have been given the most attention, resulting in gloves with less than desirable flexibility. The stiffness of the glove has even been cited as one of the limiting factors in EVA productivity.10 The purpose of this investigation was to develop a hand exoskeleton to assist astronauts in performing tasks which would normally fatigue their hands due to the stiffness of their gloves. While the problem of space suit stiffness has been around since the early days of pressure suit development, the consideration of exoskeletons as solutions has come about only recently. Senior design students from Louisiana State University constructed a powered wrist for the EVA glove in 1989. The joint was designed to provide powered assistance in one degree of freedom and was successfully demonstrated to operate at suit inflation pressures below 4.0 psi.13 Unfortunately, the LSU study is the only exoskeleton work that was directly intended for use with the pressurized space suits. It is the purpose of this paper to review some of the non- EVA exoskeleton work and apply the results to our particular problem. Research conducted by W. Milliken and G. Eiken at Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory in Buffalo, New York in the mid- 1950s was concerned with augmenting muscular strength and endurance.9 Their goal was to develop a machine that would amplify strength. They began by studying motions found in nature and tried to determine if these motions could be mimicked by machines. They identified four aspects of the problem: 1246</page><page sequence="2">1.)Type of structure practical for the amplifier. 2.)Type of actuation system required. 3.)Method of sensing the wearer's movements. 4.)Type of feedback to be used at each joint so that the wearer can control the forces of the amplifier. A prototype of an unpowered, full body exoskeleton was built to determine if such a device could be worn without significantly restricting the natural movements of the body. The prototype also allowed the researchers to determine the minimum number of joints needed to perform the required tasks. The final version had a total of 36 joints and the authors concluded that it allowed for a reasonable facsimile of human motion. Research conducted by GE in the 1960's was also concerned with developing a full body exoskeleton, subsequently known as Hardiman. The goal of the project was to retain the operator's natural movements and amplify his strength by a factor of 25.9 The legs of the exoskeleton each provided three degrees of freedom. The project ultimately was ended due to the difficulty in reducing the number of degrees of freedom required to simulate the motion of the body and because of the high power requirement of the exoskeleton." Of more serious interest to this present study is evidence in the literature of the development of devices that are more specific to the problem we are addressing, namely strength augmentation of the gloved hand. A lightweight, pneumatically powered hand exoskeleton was built by researchers at Tokushima University in Japan which provided finger power for people with hand paralysis.5 The device fit on top of the hand, followed the motion of the human hand, but provided only a light grasping force of 0.5 kilograms (1.1 pounds). It did not incorporate any kind of sensing capability, so the control problems encountered with the other exoskeletons were not an issue. The major problem noted in all the early exoskeleton developments was having the 1247 exoskeleton follow the intended movements of the wearer. Researchers attribute this instability to the fundamental problem of sensory feedback. Human locomotion systems are complex systems with a great number of degrees of freedom. A mechanism which synthesizes this motion leads to complex systems, particularly from the control standpoint. Therefore, researchers in this area have tried to reduce the number of degrees of freedom. The hand exoskeleton described herein borrowed freely from the exoskeletons that were described in the literature review. The goal of previous exoskeleton designs has been to assist the human operator in overcoming physical limitations. This work has an identical goal with the limitation being the astronauts' lack of strength and endurance in performing EVA missions. By augmenting the strength of the human hand the exoskeleton provides a unique way of assisting astronauts in overcoming the stiffness of the EVA glove. GENERAL DESIGN CRITERIA As previously discussed, the purpose of an exoskeleton is to assist the human operator in overcoming physical limitations. The limitation for this application is the astronauts lack of strength and endurance in overcoming the stiffness of the EVA glove. To alleviate this problem, the hand exoskeleton should assist the operator in performing a power grasp with the hand and a precision grasp with the index finger. A power grasp is one in which there are large areas of contact between the fingers and the palm, with little ability to impart motion to the fingers.3 This type of grasp is performed when security and stability are primary concerns. An example is grasping the handle of a tool. A precision grasp involves a pinching motion between the respective fingers and the thumb. This type of grasp is performed when dexterity and sensitivity are the desired characteristics.3 Picking up a small object such as a pencil requires this grasp. Another design criterion is that the kinematics of the exoskeleton follow that of the human hand as closely as possible. Before the</page><page sequence="3">exoskeleton joints were designed, a basic understanding of the kinematics of the human fingers was necessary. A critical fact that must be accounted for in the development of a hand exoskeleton is that the phalanges of a finger rotate about a point located inside their respective joints. For the exoskeleton joints to mimic the motion of the fingers, their centers of rotation should coincide with the centers of rotation of the actual fingers. EXOSKELETON KINEMATICS To allow the user to perform the required grasps, a three-fingered structure was developed. Figures 1, 2, and 3 show the prototype of the exoskeleton that was built. The design allows independent movement of the index finger, the middle finger, and the combined ring and little finger. Each finger mimics the kinematics of the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) and proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints. A separate drive system is used for each finger so that they may move independently. Brackets are mounted to the exoskeleton fingers, surrounding the human fingers. The brackets protect the fingers from physical harm and provide a location for sensor placement. As previously mentioned, the kinematics of the exoskeleton fingers mimic the kinematics of the human fingers. The finger joint mechanism shown in Figure 4 accomplishes this goal. Figure 5 shows the mechanism in its closed position. Also shown is the four bar linkage which connects the MCP and PIP joints. Each joint mechanism rotates about a point in space. This point is an instant center, which is a point where the relative velocity between two links is zero at that instant.1 The points of concern are the instant center of the proximal phalanx with respect to ground and the instant center of the middle phalanx with respect to the proximal phalanx. The instant centers were found using the Kennedy theorem.1 Because of the parallelogram configuration of the linkage mechanism, the instant center of the proximal phalanx with respect to ground remains fixed as the finger rotates through its range of motion. Figures 4 and 5 show this point in the open and closed positions respectively. The instant center of the middle phalanx with respect to the proximal phalanx is also shown. Again, due to the parallelogram structure of the joints, this point remains constant relative to the positions of the base link. The design of the joint mechanisms was governed by having the appropriate instant centers coincide with the centers of rotation of the human fingers. This was the guiding factor in determining the length of each link and the initial angles between the links. This also means that an exoskeleton is a custom-made device due to the large amount of human variation in hand size. A computer model of the exoskeleton finger system was developed to study its kinematic characteristics. The calculations were simplified by modeling each of the exoskeleton joints shown in Figure 4 as an equivalent four bar linkage. Due to the parallelogram configuration of the joint mechanism, this simplified model possesses the same kinematic characteristics as the actual mechanism used. The model is shown in Figure 6. The loop-closure method was used to perform the displacement analysis.7 In this method, each link of the mechanism is represented by a vector. The sum of the vectors around any loop in the mechanism is zero. The three vector loops formed are +Ř4 -Ř3 -R2 = О r5+R6-Rq-R, = 0 (1) ^^12-^1-^10=0 The vector equations shown in equation (1) can be written in Cartesian form as COS (0i) +Ä4COfl (04) -Ä3COB (0,) -ÄjCOB (0,) -0 (2) Rx sin (0J +Ä4sin (04) -J?3sin (03) -.RaSin (02) = 0 R5COB (05) +J?gCOS (06) -J^COS (0e) -RjCOB (07) »0 (3) J?5sin (05) +l^ein (06) -'Resin (0e) -RjBin (07) « 0 RgCOB (Од) J-RļļCOB (017) "йцСОб (0ц) -Я10сов (0¿q) -0&lt;4) 12ļBin(6ļ) ^128111(612) ~ЛцВ1п(0ц) ~i?1g8Ín(01Q) ■ 0 where R¡ represents the length of each vector and 0¡ are the angles measured from the positive x- axis counterclockwise to the direction of the vector.

The position of this point is controlled by the length of the links, 0,, and 02. 0, remains fixed as the joints move. 02 is the input angle of the mechanism since it is driven by the motor. 05 is a function of 03, 07 and 09 are functions 04, and 01O is a function of 0g, and can be expressed as the following. 05 = 03+ф5 07 = 04+Ф7 (5) 09 = 04+ФЭ 010 = 08+Фю ф5, ф7, ф9, and ф,0 are constants (ф5 = 0o , ф7 = - 65°, ф9 = 230°, ф10 = -95°). For a given value of the input angle 02, equations 2 through 4 can be solved numerically. A computer program incorporating a numerical routine was used to solve the kinematic equations over the range of the input link. These solutions were used to construct plots of each finger mechanism. Velocity analysis of the linkage was performed using the method of kinematic coefficients. Kinematic coefficients are the derivatives of motion variables with respect to the input variable, and are functions of position only.2 Letting S, be the input variable, and Sk be the output variable. By the chain rule &lt;e&gt; If Sk is an output angle 0k, and S¡ is the input angle 0¡, then equation 6 is represented by &lt;-&gt;* = (7) where wk is the angular velocity of the output variable, to¡ is the angular velocity of the input variable, and hk represents the kinematic coefficient. For the mechanism under consideration, the equations for computing the kinematic coefficients can be determined by differentiating equations 2 through 4 with respect to the input variable 02.

Because of the relationship given by equation 5, h5 equals h3, h7 and h9 equal h4, and h,0 equals hg. All of the angles were determined from the displacement analysis of the mechanism, and the vector lengths are custom lengths known from the initial design. The system of linear equations were solved for each position of the mechanism. The kinematic coefficients are used to determine the force transmission characteristics of the mechanism. Assuming that the mechanism behaves as a conservative system, equation 1 1 summarizes the power relationship of the mechanism.

The force transfer characteristics of each finger can be found by taking the dot product of equations 16 and 17 with equation 18, respectively, for each mechanism at it travels its range of motion. Substituting these values into equation 13 yields an expression for the mechanical advantage. This expression gives the ratio of the output forces that act against the proximal and middle phalanges to the input torque. EXOSKELETON ACTUATION SYSTEM The actuation system for the exoskeleton has to satisfy a number of design objectives. On&lt; important characteristic is the amount of power supplied by the actuators. Power is a combinatior of the work done by the actuators and the amount of time required to perform this work. The amount of power supplied must be large enough so that the exoskeleton can overcome the stiffness of the EVA glove in a reasonable amount of time. Research conducted by the Space Suit Glove Research Group at Vanderbilt University measured the average maximum pressure between the fingers and the glove in a 57.2 kPa glove box. The finger pressure was measured between the PCP and MCP joint of the fingers. The measurements can be used to get an estimate of the torque required to bend a glove finger at the MCP joint. The torque resisting the movement of the MCP joint was determined to be in the range of 1.0 - 2.0 N-m. The force acting against the MCP joint was represented previously as F4. Knowing the resisting torque and the location of the force sensors, the necessary value for F4 was found to range from 40 - 80 N. The actuation system needs to provide a force to each finger with at least the same order of magnitude as the resisting force. By using the results of the kinematic analysis an actuation system can be chosen which satisfies this requirement. Selection of the actuation system is a critical consideration because of the need to keep the entire exoskeleton as small as possible. The actuators must be small and light enough to be worn by the operator, but must also provide the necessary power. One of the compromises that was made in choosing the actuation system was balancing power and size. To have better control of the exoskeleton and to reduce power consumption, the actuation system should allow the operator to maintain a stationary grip. To accomplish this, the actuation system should either be self-locking or incorporate a brake system. Other considerations for the actuation system include commercial availability and high maintainability. The goal of this project was to build and test a prototype of the exoskeleton 1256</page><page sequence="12">within a short time frame. The actuators needed to be readily available so that they could be used to test the prototype. This criterion mandated the use of commercially available, off-the-shelf actuators which could be quickly incorporated into the design. High maintainability is another important characteristic for this application. The device will be run in an environment where the consequences of down time might be fatal. The actuation system should be simple enough to maintain so that problems can be easily prevented and repaired. A number of different types of actuation systems were considered for the exoskeleton. Those considered were pneumatic, hydraulic, and DC motors. Pneumatic actuators have been used in a number of robotic applications. They are used when a light weight, relatively inexpensive means of actuation is required. Their drawbacks include inaccurate speed and position control due to the compressibility of the fluid, not to mention the need for a remote compressor. As the load encountered by the actuator increases, the volume of the gas in the pneumatic cylinder is reduced.15 This causes a change in the position of the piston rod. Therefore, pneumatics are primarily used in applications where end conditions are of primary importance. The piston will be either in the fully extended or fully retracted positions.15 For the exoskeleton application, the operator will encounter varying loads, and needs better position control than pneumatics can provide. Hydraulic systems are another common type of actuation system used in robotics. Their primary advantage lies in their high output power per unit weight. This is an important characteristic since one of the objectives of the exoskeleton is to augment the hand's strength. Since an incompressible fluid is used, hydraulics do not have the same position and velocity control problems as pneumatics. The primary problem with hydraulics is one of maintainability. Leaking fluid at the servo valves has been noted in many applications where hydraulic actuators have been used.11 Another problem includes contamination of the fluid by dust and other particles, which can reduce efficiency.5 Finally, hydraulics require large, expensive power supplies.15 DC motors were the principle type of actuation system studied. Problems with this mode of actuation include the need of a system to convert rotary motion to linear motion, and a marginal torque-to-weight ratio, requiring a mechanical transmission to increase torque. Motors with rare earth magnets have better torque- to-weight ratios, but their availability is limited and their cost was prohibitive for this project. The use of a linear electric motor would negate the need for the conversion of rotary to linear motion, but the size of commercially available motors did not make them a viable option. This essentially left DC motors as the remaining choice. A simple, inexpensive control system can be built for a DC motor which satisfies the performance goals. Power supplies are compact and inexpensive. Transmission lines can be easily routed from motors to the power supply, which allows it to be located at a remote location. Based upon this information, it was decided to power the exoskeleton with DC motors. DC motors are basically torque transducers that convert electrical energy into mechanical energy. A magnet is used to provide the uniform, radially oriented field flux, and a current-carrying conductor is established a distance r from the center of rotation. The torque developed at the motor is proportional to the armature current, and is given by the following equation. I' motor ~ ia i") where K¡ is the torque constant and ia is the armature current. A back emf is also developed which opposes the flow of the current, and is given by e* = (2°) where Kb is the back-emf constant and tDm is the angular velocity of the motor shaft. The particular motors chosen to power this exoskeleton are constant magnetic flux DC motors, or more commonly known as a permanent magnet motors (PM). Permanent magnet motors have relatively linear torque-speed characteristics. The motors used in this design have an AINiCo magnet. The torque-to-weight ratio of a motor with this type of magnet is greater than one with a 1257</page><page sequence="13">ferrite based magnet. In order to determine what specific motor should be used, it is necessary to know the mechanical power required by the application. The mechanical power developed in the armature of the motor is given by P = T( t) &lt;o ( t) (21) Equation 21 shows that power is a function of torque and speed. These are the two factors which determine the required power of the actuators and govern their size. The more power that is required, the larger the physical size of the motor. Enough power must be provided to overcome glove stiffness in a minimum amount of time. The minimum amount of torque that the actuation system must provide to accomplish this goal was discussed at the beginning of this chapter. The motors also had to be small enough so that all three of them (one for each finger of the exoskeleton) could be worn by the human operator. In order to power the exoskeleton joints, the rotary motion of the motors had to be converted to linear motion. Possibilities to accomplish this include a worm gear, a ball screw, or a lead screw. Worm gearing was ruled out because its size would be too big for the exoskeleton. Ball screws were also considered. Because of their high efficiency, smaller motors could be used to produce a given amount of torque. However, because of their high efficiency, ball screws are not self locking, which means that a braking system would have to be incorporated. This was ruled out because of the increased size and complexity. The size of the ball screw itself was also too large for this application. The use of lead screws was another option. Lead screws have lower efficiencies than ball screws. This means that a larger actuator would be required to produce the same amount of output torque. However, lead screws are self locking because they have higher friction values. Therefore, a braking system would not be required, reducing its overall size and complexity. Lead screws are also commercially available in small sizes. Based upon this comparison, it was decided to use lead screws for the rotary to linear motion conversion. The desired linear motion is provided by a nut translating along the axis of each screw. The linear force supplied by the screw is a function of the torque provided by the actuator, and is given by P ш 2T (ndf„-|łJeece) (22) 1 * [d„(J+ii|łd^9C0) +|1„&lt;1(.(ясГя-ц1ввс«) ] where Та is the torque supplied by the actuator and Fl is the resisting linear force.14 Equation 22 accounts for frictional losses in the screw, as well as frictional losses due to the collar bearing. The collar bearing is necessary in order to handle the thrust load along the axis of the screw. The linear force provided by the lead screws powers a cable/cam system which closes the joints of the exoskeleton. Two small diameter steel cables are attached to cams mounted on each MCP joint on the exoskeleton. As the cables are pulled back by the actuation system, the cams push on the MCP joint mechanisms, causing the proximal phalanx to rotate. A four bar linkage connects the two joint mechanisms. The purpose of this linkage is to couple the motion of the PIP joint to the MCP joint. This configuration allows one actuation system to close both joints. Extension springs mounted between the joint mechanisms of the exoskeleton are used to return the fingers to their extended position. This occurs when the actuation system releases the tension in the cables. The cam is designed such that the moment arm R is constant over the range of motion of the exoskeleton joints, or approximately 90 degrees. The input torque to each exoskeleton joint mechanism, represented by T2, equals the cable force times the moment arm of the cam. T2 = FlR (23) Substituting equation 23 into equation 22 gives the input torque to the finger linkage mechanism as a 1258</page><page sequence="14">function of the torque supplied by the actuation system, or T„. (ксГд-цГве сд) (24) 2 ' [d„( J+itļicĻ вес«) +|1с&lt;Гс(п&lt;1я-цГвеса) ] Equation 24 determines the amount of torque that the actuator must produce. T2, the input torque to the finger mechanism, must be at least the same order of magnitude as the torque required to bend a glove finger (1-2 N-M). The next step was to find motors which could supply the desired torque, yet meet the size requirements. To help accomplish this, a gearhead is connected to each motor. Without a gearhead, a high torque motor would have to be used to satisfy the performance goals. However, these motors would be too large for the application. Motors that produce less torque but run at faster speeds have sufficient power and satisfy the size requirements. Combinations of motors and gearheads were examined until one was found which best satisfied the power and size requirements. Figure 8 shows a photograph of the entire actuation system. The motors and gears are not small enough to be mounted on the hand, so they are mounted on the forearm. The lead screws are mounted on the hand and telescopic universal joints are used to couple the motors to the lead screws. This allows the motors to power the lead screws without severely restricting wrist movement. A single constant voltage (18 volts/3.3 amps) power supply is used to power the three motors. The current to each motor is limited to 1 amp to prevent the motor from overheating. The gearhead connected to the motor is a 2 stage planetary gearhead with a reduction ratio of 25:1 and an efficiency of 75%. Using the previous information, the maximum amount of torque supplied to the exoskeleton was determined. Substituting the value of the maximum current drawn by each motor (1 amp) into equation 19 gives the maximum torque of the motor. This torque value is multiplied by the gear reduction ratio and efficiency to get the maximum torque supplied by the actuator, which is 0.289 N-m. Substituting this value into equation 24 produces a value for T2 of 3.875 N-m. As previously discussed, the torque required to overcome glove stiffness at the MCP joint ranges from 1 N-m to 2 N-m. As can be seen, the input torque supplied to each exoskeleton finger is the same order of magnitude as the resistance torque. This shows that the actuators can overcome glove stiffness without exceeding their operating limit. The distance that the cams must move to completely close the exoskeleton fingers is IM (25) 4 A value for R of 0.01 meter gives a distance of approximately 0.0159 meter that the cables must move to completely close the exoskeleton fingers. The speed of the gearhead output shaft and the lead screw is n/25. Knowing the lead of the screw, it was found that the exoskeleton moved from its fully open position to its fully closed position in approximately 2 seconds if no load is encountered. The device will close in approximately 3.5 seconds if the motor operates at its maximum allowable torque for the total travel distance. CONTROL SYSTEM/SENSORS The purpose of the control system is to allow the exoskeleton to mimic the movements of the human wearer. The exoskeleton acts as a man amplifier. Force exerted by the user is sensed by the controller, which controls the actuators.6 Figure 9 illustrates the control scheme. In the scheme, the actuators provide power while the movements of the human control the device. This provides a very natural way of controlling the exoskeleton, as opposed to learning how to use a keyboard, joystick, or other type of external controller. Being in contact with the exoskeleton also provides a means of force reflection without the need for a separate set of actuators. This allows the operator to react quickly to provide an input to 1259</page><page sequence="15">Figure 8. Photograph of the actuation system for the exoskeleton.

In order to control the exoskeleton, it was necessary to detect the magnitude of the contact force between the hand and the exoskeleton. The force sensors that were developed fit between the operator's fingers and the brackets mounted to the exoskeleton fingers. Each sensor incorporates a strain gage rosette. The rosette consists of two gages which are right angles to each other. A half bridge configuration was used to provide temperature compensation. Each rosette was bonded to a strip of brass which was bent into a shape that fits inside the brackets. Clearance is provided between the bracket and sensor to accommodate the sensor displacement. As the finger makes contact with the sensor, the strain is detected and converted to a change in voltage by means of a Wheatstone Bridge. The output voltage increases proportionally with increasing contact force. An instrumentation amplifier (Analogue Devices AD624) is used to amplify the voltage difference detected by the bridge circuit. Since the motion of the proximal and middle phalanges is coupled, only one force sensor per finger was necessary. Therefore, only the brackets attached to the middle phalanges of the exoskeleton contain force sensors. Figure 10 shows the palm of the hand and the contact between the fingers and the force sensors. A digital control system was developed which incorporates a programmable microcontroller based on the Intel 83C51FB microprocessor (Blue Earth Research Inc., Mankato, MN). Digital control allows more flexibility than an analog control system since different control schemes can be invoked by simply modifying the software. The microcontroller was chosen for a number of reasons. It has an on-board analogue to digital converter that can read up to 7 input channels. It is commonly used to control DC motors using Pulse Width Modulation (PWM), a technique which will be discussed shortly. The microcontroller is also very compact, making it ideal for a system that needs to be as small as possible. A computer program is used by the microcontroller to control the exoskeleton. This particular microcontroller can be programmed in one of two languages, BASIC or Assembly. The program for this application was written in Assembly Language for a number of reasons. Assembly programs can be stored in the microprocessor memory in a form that does not require additional translating or interpreting. This makes assembly programs forty times faster than BASIC programs. The Assembly program also facilitated the use of interrupt routines to perform the analog to digital conversions. Interrupt routines provide an efficient means for accomplishing this task and cannot be easily implemented in BASIC. As discussed, the program uses an interrupt routine to sample the analog signals from all three force sensors. Figure 1 1 shows the control logic performed by the program. If the input voltage from a sensor is lower than a certain threshold voltage (Vpl), the output voltage to the motor is positive, causing the motor to open the appropriate finger. As the amount of contact force increases above Vp„ the voltage to the motor is zero, causing the motion of the exoskeleton finger to stop. As the contact force increases further, another voltage threshold is crossed (Vp2). The output voltage to the motor is negative, which will close the finger. The analog-to-digital converter provided by the microcontroller digitizes the signals from the strain gage sensors. Sixteen consecutive readings for each sensor are stored by the computer. The average of these values is taken to filter the signal. The filtered value is compared against the threshold values set in the program. Twenty nine milliseconds are required by the interrupt routine to sample all three sensors and produce the filtered signals. To control the output of the motor, the controller uses Pulse Width Modulation (PWM). PWM is a technique of controlling voltage applied to a load so that amplifier power transistors always operate in a full on or full off state.12 Power dissipation in the transistors is minimized by this method, resulting in efficient, cool operation. 1262</page><page sequence="18">Figure 10.

The amplifiers are well suited for bidirectional speed control from a single supply, allowing the motors to rim from full scale clockwise to full scale counter clockwise. Figure 12 shows the amplifiers in the bidirectional control configuration. The noninverting input of amplifier A receives a PWM wave from the microcontroller. The amplitude of this wave ranges from 0 volts to 5 volts. The noninverting input of amplifier В receives a constant voltage signal of 0 volts or 5 volts from the microcontroller. A reference voltage of 2.5 Volts is applied to the inverting inputs of both amplifiers. The reference voltage equals half of the maximum output voltage of the microcontroller (5 Volts). The output of amplifiers A and В are either low or high, depending upon if the noninverting inputs are less than or greater than the reference voltage. If the noninverting inputs are lower than the reference voltage, the outputs will be low. If the inputs are greater than the reference voltage, the outputs will be high. Figure 13 shows the outputs from amplifiers A and В for each state of the control scheme. For the first state, the voltage across the motor is positive, causing it to rotate clockwise. At the second state, the voltage across the motor is zero, causing it to stop. The output of the third state is the complement of the first state, meaning the sign of the voltage across the motor is opposite of the first state, or negative. This causes to motor to rotate in the opposite direction, or counter clockwise. The speed at which the motors turn is controlled by the duty cycle. VI. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS An exoskeleton is a device worn by a human operator which assists in overcoming the wearer's physical limitations. Actuators provide the necessary power, while the human controls the movement of the device. The goal of this project was to develop a hand exoskeleton to overcome the stiffness of the EVA glove. The resultant exoskeleton is a three- fingered structure that fits on the human hand. Each finger mimics the kinematics of the MCP and PIP joints. This was accomplished by having the centers of rotation of each exoskeleton joint coincide with those of the human fingers. The device has an index, middle, and combined ring and little finger. The design allows the user to perform a power grasp with the hand or a precision grasp with the index finger. DC motors are used as actuators for the exoskeleton. Each actuator is connected to a lead screw which converts the rotary motion of the motor to linear motion. The linear motion of each screw powers a cable/cam system that closes the exoskeleton fingers. Extension springs mounted to the joint mechanisms open the fingers as the cable tension is released. DC motors were chosen as the actuation system and represent a compromise between power and size. A cursory analysis based on previous data in the literature shows that the motors provide more than enough power to overcome the stiffness of the EVA glove, yet they are small enough to be comfortably worn by the operator. The control system for the exoskeleton was designed to allow the device to follow the movements of the user. Because the operator is in physical contact with the device, a very natural means of control is provided. The force exerted by the user is detected by sensors placed between the hand and the exoskeleton. These signals are used by the controller to control the actuators. A digital control system was developed that allows the operator to open, stop, or close the exoskeleton based upon the input signals from the sensors. The previous comments highlight the overall design of the exoskeleton, showing how it works. After the prototype was built, it was tested on a human operator. The device fit on the hand with little discomfort. The joint mechanisms successfully mimicked the kinematics of the human joints. The sensing and control system accomplished the goal of allowing the exoskeleton to follow the motions of the operator. The DC motor actuators successfully closed the exoskeleton fingers when sufficient contact force was applied to the sensors. When the contact force decreased, the actuators stopped, causing the fingers to stop, allowing the operator to control grip position. As the contact force was released, 1265</page><page sequence="21">O V о г _J~LTir&gt;^ X- v ^&lt;]5 V A ( m j &lt;^B 2,5V ^ ^'J 2 5 V Figure 12.

The extension springs then opened the fingers. The testing phase indicates that the exoskeleton met its desired performance characteristics. It can be worn by a human operator and the user can control its movements. The tests also indicate areas that can be further developed to meet more challenging performance goals. The development of an opposable thumb would be beneficial in making the exoskeleton more anthropomorphic. With a thumb, the number of grasps that could be performed by the exoskeleton would be greatly increased. The first prototype was built to determine its feasibility in overcoming EVA glove stiffness by strength augmentation. This did not require the development of a thumb. A more complex mechanism would have to be developed to mimic the kinematics of the thumb. The planar linkages used for the finger joints would not work. To further increase the degrees of freedom of the exoskeleton, the development of a separate actuation system for each finger joint should also be considered. The prototype developed couples the motion of the PIP joint to the MCP joint. This was done because there was not a commercially available actuator small enough to power each joint and provide the desired force. Another area that would increase the performance characteristics of the exoskeleton is decreasing the amount of time required to close it. The motors are presently connected to gearheads with a fixed reduction ratio of 25:1. The purpose of these gearheads is to increase the amount of output torque from each actuator. In addition, the rotational speed of each actuator is reduced by this ratio. As previously discussed, the time required by the exoskeleton to fully close ranges from 2 seconds to 3.5 seconds, depending upon the resistance load encountered by the device. Ideally, the response time should be faster so that the exoskeleton could move with the same speed as the human hand. If a gearhead with a lower reduction ratio is used with the same motors, this could be accomplished. However, the amount of output torque would be reduced to the point where the exoskeleton could not provide sufficient force. A motor with more power could also be used, but ¡the increased size would soon become prohibitive. One idea for providing faster response times, yet maintaining sufficient force, is connecting each motor to a variable transmission. A variable transmission would allow the power provided by the motor to be shifted to optimize the performance of the exoskeleton. If an application requiring more force is encountered by the exoskeleton, the transmission would shift to a high reduction ratio. This would increase the torque provided by thé actuators. If an application is encountered where response time is more important, the transmission would shift to a low reduction ratio. This would increase the speed of the actuators, causing the exoskeleton to close faster. If a variable transmission could be made small enough to be used with the present motors, it would be a convenient solution to this problem. The development of smaller linear motors is another area which would make the exoskeleton more feasible. At present, linear motors that provide sufficient power for this application are too large to incorporate into the design. If these motors can be made smaller, they would become a good option for powering the exoskeleton. They would eliminate the need for the lead screws. Linear motors could be mounted on the hand, as opposed to the forearm where the DC servomotors are now mounted. This would reduce the overall size of the exoskeleton. The development of a more sophisticated control system would also increase the performance of the exoskeleton. The present control system accomplishes the basic goal of allowing the device to follow the motion of the human. The operator can open, stop, or close the device as desired. However, each exoskeleton finger is treated as an independent system. The actual hand has over 25 degrees of freedom, many of which are coupled by the ligamentous structure and location of tendon insertions.4 This effect was noticed when the exoskeleton was tested. If the desired motion was to move only one finger, the other fingers would also move to a certain degree. At times, this additional motion was detected by the sensing and control system, which caused the actuators to respond in an undesirable manner. One idea to prevent this undesired motion is to 1268</page><page sequence="24">incorporate fuzzy logic into the control scheme. Fuzzy logic would examine a number of criteria before the control signals would be sent to the actuator. The present control system makes a decision based only upon one criteria, whether the force sensor signal is less than or greater than set threshold values. It does not account for the interconnected nature of the human hand. This more sophisticated control system would also work better as more degrees of freedom are added to the exoskeleton.
