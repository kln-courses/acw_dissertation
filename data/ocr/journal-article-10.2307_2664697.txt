<plain_text><page sequence="1">SPECIES OF MIND: THE PHILOSOPHY AND BIOLOGY OF COGNITIVE ETHOLOGY. By Colin Allen and Marc Bekoff. A Bradford Book. Cambridge (Massachusetts): MIT Press. $35.00. xxi + 209 p; ill.; index. ISBN: 0-262-01163-8. 1997. The field of cognitive ethology, though foreshad- owed in the work of classical ethologists, is of rela- tively recent date: the publication of Donald R Grif- fin's 1976 book, The Question of Animal Awareness: Evolutionary Continuity of Mental Experience (New York: Rockefeller University Press), marked the wa- tershed event. Griffin's book and his subsequent works raised the important questions of whether an- imals have mental states, what the evolutionary basis for such states might be, and how a student of ani- 367 SEPTEMBER 1999</page><page sequence="2">368 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY VOLUME 74 mal behavior might approach these questions ex- perimentally. Griffin's approach has been criticized by both behaviorists and philosophers who write about consciousness, but his championing of the field allowed ethologists to consider a new category of explanations for complex behaviors, and in fact encouraged the study of complexity in behavior. Al- len and Bekoff's book is a response to the criticism that cognitive ethology is a mix of anecdote and anthropomorphism without a theoretical frame- work. The explicit goal of the volume is to provide an account of the premises of cognitive ethology in terms of philosophical approaches to conscious- ness, and to derive from this account some indica- tions of how ethologists might productively study behavior that is related to mental states in animals. Although philosophers may not be entirely con- vinced by the authors' arguments, the account Al- len and Bekoff give, particularly in Chapters 4 and 5, is very useful reading for biologists interested in how philosophers approach questions of conscious- ness; these chapters go a long way toward meeting the goal of providing ethologists with a theoretical framework for thinking about mental states in ani- mals. The sixth chapter uses social play, in particu- lar Bekoff's work on the canid "invitation to play posture" or "play bow" as a case study for applying the theoretical framework erected in the previous chapters. Play bows immediately precede the behav- iors that, outside the context of play, would be con- sidered most aggressive by conspecifics. Hence play bows can be seen as a means for communicating that the aggression inherent in snarling, pouncing, and biting is not intended-not what the animal "has in mind." Behaviorist interpretations are of course possible, but to many the idea that a play bow expresses intentionality-in both the ordinary and the philosophical sense of the word-will seem a more parsimonious explanation. The book postpones any attempt to consider a definition of consciousness until the eighth chap- ter. In fact, Allen and Bekoff make the point in the first chapter that an operational definition of a phe- nomenon is the outcome of empirical study, not the starting point: "Before gold's atomic structure was understood, overt properties such as density, hardness, color, and reactivity were used to deter- mine whether a given specimen was indeed gold. It would have been premature to define gold in terms of those properties, since, like carbon, gold could have turned out to occur in more than one form" (pp 16-17). The other key points in the authors' method are their commitment to a comparative ap- proach (they reject the "primatocentricism" that is common in considerations of cognitive ethology, but consider primate studies where appropriate, as, for example, Cheney and Seyfarth's work), and to field studies of behavior, pointing out that the con- trolled laboratory environment is also impover- ished, and so may not be conducive to observing the complex and nuanced behavior that would provide evidence of mental states. The ninth and final chap- ter is disappointing, as it is primarily a response to Heyes and Dickinson in the latest round of an ongo- ing dialogue. This fails to provide the broader syn- thesis advertised in the chapter heading, Toward an Interdisciplinary Science of Cognitive Ethology: Synthesizing Field, Laboratory, and Armchair Ap- proaches. The authors declare in the preface that they will not consider some major areas that are included in Griffin's work; most prominent among these is the neural basis of mental states. This choice is based on justifiable skepticism about whether the rate of progress of research in this area will allow it to ad- dress issues of mental states any time soon. It is cer- tainly true that neuroscientific research does not yet bear directly upon the questions the book con- siders, but work in that field necessarily informs our interpretations of animal behavior, and just as it is difficult to consider comparative approaches to cognition without including studies on primates, a consideration of mental states without any refer- ence to what we know about comparative neurosci- ence seems incomplete. Another area that seems central to the questions raised in the book is that of language or communi- cation. Allen and Bekoff point out that both social behavior and behavior that results in or is triggered by a misrepresentation of information may provide good models for studying the mental states of ani- mals. Communication is a class of behavior that is potentially useful for inferring mental states; the failure to consider animal communication systems explicitly seems somewhat odd, given that one of the hurdles that arguments about animal minds must overcome is the contention that mental states are private and, unless reported by the individual that experiences them, cannot be known. Humans (at least human philosophers) do report exten- sively on their mental states, and this is taken by many philosophers to be the only convincing evi- dence for mental states such as consciousness. Yet many species do have communication signals and systems with sufficient complexity to make them useful as models for human speech. Some etholo- gists, and even some students of language, might argue that an animal's failure to report its mental state may be the result of human failure to compre- hend the content of the animal's utterances. Would a nonhuman observer of human behavior who is unable to decode our linguistic system find un- equivocal evidence for mental states and for con- sciousness? That many philosophers find Allen and Bekoff's arguments too ambitious, while some ethologists</page><page sequence="3">SEPTEMBER 1999 NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 369 may find them too conservative, is a sign that the book is, on the whole, well balanced. It should prove particularly useful for ethologists who are seeking a theoretical framework for thinking about alternatives to behaviorist explanations of complex, nuanced behaviors.
