The Web of Progress: Private Values and Public Styles in Boston and Charleston, 1828-1843. New York: Oxford University Press, 1985. xiv + 334 pp. Appendixes, notes, and index. $29.95. Given certain similarities in time and space, what factors differentiate cities and what paths to the future are opened and chosen by their inhabitants? William and Jane Pease, two enterprising historians from the University of Maine, have addressed these questions in a rich and impressive book. They have sliced out the same chronological segment from each of two cities, Boston and Charleston, placed each segment under a powerful analytical microscope, and recreated a complex pattern of city building. Though the chronological boundaries are not quite as sharp as the subtitle specifies, the Peases focus on an important fifteen-year period of antebellum history, be- ginning with hard times and tariff controversy of the late 1820s, proceeding through a cycle of boom and bust in the 1830s, and ending with attempts at recovery in the early 1840s. Erecting a sturdy structure of economic and political history on a solid social historical base, the authors spent a decade and a half compiling and analyzing their materials. Not only did they study voluminous newspaper articles, government reports, and other traditional sources, they also collected extensive biographical data on a total of nearly 7,000 elites from both cities plus countless other quantitative items. Yet they do not overwhelm the reader with numbers; they unassumingly integrate their quantitative analysis into the text and confine tables to a fascinating ap- pendix. The book begins with an identification of the two cities and of their economic aspirations during the late 1820s and early 1830s. Commerce pro- vided the lifeblood to both, and merchants in Boston and Charleston con- stantly feared they were falling behind commercial competitors, especially those in New York City. In Charleston, however, mercantile success served as a stepping-stone to acquisition of land and a planter's life, while in Boston entrepreneurship, including capital investment in corporations and industry, predominated. Boston's boom of the early 1830s was fueled by its industrial- izing hinterland, solid banking system, relatively quiet labor relations, and 246</page><page sequence="2">CHUDACOFF / Hinge and Hub 247 energetic elites, who forsook social and political activism for business. When Boston entrepreneurs sought economic expansion, according to the Peases, they usually depended on private investment rather than on government aid. During the same period, Charleston's efforts toward economic growth were impeded by planter ideology, a distaste for industry, and a greater propensity to depend on government assistance and to toss economic decisionmaking into the public arena. The contrasting economic and political styles manifested themselves most starkly in the development of transportation systems. To characterize Charleston's role as a transshipper between western goods brought by rail to the city on their way to foreign export and foreign imports arriving by sea, the Peases use the metaphor of "hinged tollgate." But, as they explain, the hinge never functioned smoothly. Port facilities were never made advan- tageous enough to compete with importing rivals. Moreover, dependence on publicly-subsidized railroads resulted in a clumsy, undercapitalized system that had trouble competing with river and coastal shipping. Boston business- men, the Peases assert, were preoccupied with railroads and, through mostly private investment, strung lines to communities in all directions through New England. These connections, along with port functions, made Boston a "hub" and fed the growth of the city's hinterland in ways that were precluded in South Carolina. Thus Boston's commitment to private investment, support of industrialization, and broad economic activity proved more profitable than Charleston's emphasis on public subsidy, exaltation of cotton and planter culture, and unrealizable dream of serving as a commercial hinge to the South Atlantic region. The book's middle chapters focus on political and institutional developments. Charleston politics, buffeted by controversy over nullification and the bank crisis in the early 1830s, settled on the more unifying issue of slavery. Institutions, such as the police, the schools, and philanthropy, reflected not only the strong commitment to public order but also the protec- tion of an order with planter-elites at the top and blacks at the bottom. Historic principles also guided Boston politics, but, according to the Peases, in more pragmatic ways. The bank crisis helped congeal party politics, and institutions such as the schools inculcated values of work rather than com- munity cohesion. These contrasting social values - Boston's emphasis on in- dividual effort and Charleston's on community - were especially manifest in stances toward charity taken in the two cities. Intent on insuring that people could rise from poverty by their own efforts, Bostonians concentrated on sep- arating worthy from unworthy poor, using relief to reinforce the values of work and sacrifice. The rationalization of charity did not take root in Charleston, however. There, notions of benevolence, which endowed the</page><page sequence="3">248 REVIEWS IN AMERICAN HISTORY / June 1987 wealthy with the honorable responsibility for attending to the poor, plus the priority of leisure over work, militated against applying the work ethic to dis- tinguish between worthy and unworthy. Political, economic, and cultural choices made in the late 1820s and early 1830s also determined both cities' responses and fortunes during the depres- sion that followed the Panic of 1837. The decline especially bared the obstacles that had hindered economic progress in Charleston. Disadvantaged by a weak transportation network and banking system, by diversion of potential nonagricultural investment into the plantation economy, and by underdeveloped industry and an unskilled, uneducated labor force, the South Carolina city floundered. Local boosters clung to the goal of creating a com- mercial hinge, a vision that became increasingly clouded. At the same time, several local disasters exacerbated economic misfortune. A catastrophic fire, two steamboat sinkings, and two yellow fever epidemics not only wreaked extensive damage to property and life but also destroyed the city's three in- surance companies, which collapsed under heavy claims, and exposed the in- competence of the fire department. Ultimately, say the Peases, the result of mounting problems was that "Charleston's aspirations for economic growth were doomed to disappointment" (p. 188). In contrast, Boston bent but did not break under the adversities of the era. With a more rationalized fire department and water system than Charles- ton's, it was better able to ward off threats of fire and disease. Moreover, Bostonians' work ethic and pragmatism buoyed the local economy through the hard times. The failures of weak banks strengthened those that survived. The local government tightened its belt, but through the salutary strategy of amortizing the city's long-term debt and abandoning construction of a costly new city hall. Declines in individual wealth were not severe, and both rail and coastal trade improved. Though still far behind New York in its export and import business, the port received a vital boost when the Cunard line established itself in Boston. Moreover, expanding textile manufacturing in the nearby hinterland provided growing substance for trade. Thus Boston recovered more quickly from the depression than did Charleston; in fact, the Peases leave the impression that the hard times barely fazed the Yankee city. By 1843, according to the authors, the mix of politics, economics, and cultural values invigorated Boston and doomed Charleston. They extol the resourcefulness and work ethic that allowed all levels of Boston's population to weather economic and political storms, and they scorn Charleston's citizens for their obsession with slavery and their priority of gentlemanly honor over productive labor. Though the Peases do not say so, their analysis of Charleston's economic frustrations and dependence on northern cities, par- ticularly New York, offers pithy explanation for the leading role South</page><page sequence="4">CHUDACOFF / Hinge and Hub 249 Carolina merchants took in the secession movement of the late 1840s and 1850s; many believed that Charleston could escape its stagnation only by becoming the New York of a separate southern confederacy. Just as studies such as those by Carl Bridenbaugh and Gary Nash have shown that economic hardship and frustration in Boston in the 1740s help explain that city's special contribution to the coming of the Revolutionary War,1 the Peases' informa- tion on Charleston in the 1840s suggests why the first shots of the Civil War were fired in that city's harbor. In sum, then, this is a very solid book, meticulously researched and con- vincingly articulated. Yet it does provoke several questions of interpretation. Throughout the book, the authors make a strong case for considering cities in anthropomorphic terms. Boston and Charleston are referred to, in effect, as historical actors with goals, personalities, and actions that reflect their char- acters. Often the authors use female pronouns when referring to one city or the other, a convention meant to prevent stylistic stiffness but also one that strongly personifies the subjects. Though they are careful to point out internal divisions within Boston and Charleston - natives and foreigners, blacks and whites, employers and workers, Whigs and Democrats - they tend to empha- size unifying aspects that in turn bolster the personification of the two places. Thus Boston is characterized as a place (entity) which valued progress fueled by the work ethic, while Charleston was a place (entity) which sought per- manence based on communal order. For the most part, this anthropo- morphism is not obtrusive; it facilitates generalization. But whether or not it pertains as broadly as the Peases imply may be a matter of debate. The personification of a place implies consensus and tends to emphasize winners in various debates and controversies while omitting losers. Both cities, as the Peases do recognize, were rent by conflict: racial, ethnic, political, religious. But they tend to downplay class antagonisms, and some social and labor historians would want to challenge them on that account. Moreover, the generalized characterization of each city is subject to dispute. What appears as pragmatism and flexibility in Boston could also be identified as confusion. The 'stasis" of Charleston can be seen with the historian's hind- sight as facilitating eventual controlled growth rather than dooming the city. The book's comparative context prompts further value judgments that de- pend on a reader's or researcher's perspective. Did the "doomed" city of Charleston provide its citizens with a living environment that was far inferior to that of Boston, as the Peases imply? Their evidence is less conclusive than their language indicates. Certainly the southern city was as rich in entertain- ment institutions and associational life as the northern city; both had similar amusements and large numbers of varied social organizations. In the provi- sion of education, Charleston may have been less progressive. Boston offered</page><page sequence="5">250 REVIEWS IN AMERICAN HISTORY / June 1987 more primary and grammar schools to inculcate the value of productive labor in children, while Charleston slighted elementary education for the many in favor of secondary and higher education to prepare elite youths for business and professional careers. Thus, while Bostonians funded elementary schools as a public duty, Charlestonians preferred to subsidize high schools and the nation's first municipally-funded college because to them public responsibility meant assisting the talented. On the issue of aid to the needy, however, Charleston made no moral distinctions among those seeking relief like Boston did. In fact, most of Charleston's social institutions were characterized by in- clusiveness, while Boston's charitable institutions and social organizations were distinguished by exclusiveness. To be sure, codes of racial order and pa- ternalistic benevolence underlay Charleston's social ethic, but did the individ- ualistic, competitive compulsiveness of Boston's public style make it a place more conducive to human welfare? One way to appraise judgmental generalizations is to test them against con- clusions reached by other scholars. Though to do so extensively would have loaded their book with too much material, the Peases can be faulted for their lack of relevant secondary sources. Indeed, their footnotes contain very few references to complementary studies, and their analysis suffers from the omis- sion. For example, Julius Rubin's classic study of railroad construction in Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Boston in the 1820s and 1830s shows that Boston's commercial leaders, instead of acting decisively and rationally in sponsoring private construction of a multidirectional rail network, as the Peases claim, actually were tentative, dilatory, and overly cautious, turning to private investment only when, after a long campaign, state subsidy proved unattainable.2 Moreover, when Boston merchants first promoted railroads, they meant horse-powered vehicles on tracks, not the mechanized transporta- tion that Baltimore promoters chose. In hindsight, Boston's plodding railroad construction strategy may seem calculated and correct, but compared to what was happening elsewhere at the time it appears weak and timid. There were numerous other opportunities to link topics of this book to im- portant finding of other scholars. For example, discussions of the role - or lack of it - of local government in economic and social welfare policies, especially in Boston, could have provoked enlightening comparison with the factors of municipal transformation identified by Jon Teaford in his study of urban government in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.3 Even more productively, the Peases could have matched their conclusions about the urban community and its ethos in Boston and Charleston against the ideas developed by Michael Frisch, Stuart Blumin, and Paul Johnson in their com- plex institutional and ideological analyses of community and urbanization in the nineteenth century.4 Some discussion of the relationship of women to the</page><page sequence="6">CHUDACOFF / Hinge and Hub 251 various community developments of Boston and Charleston also would have been useful. Scholars of women's history have identified many ways in which the domestic, philanthropic, and religious activities of women affected private values and public styles, but the only nod the Peases give to women is in a paragraph on female education. This is a finely crafted, praiseworthy book that could have been even more rewarding if it were not so historiographically isolated, neglecting pertinent work by others. Howard P.
