<plain_text><page sequence="1">282 Reviews of Books The Gods of Asia. Image, Text and Meaning. By T. S. Maxwell, pp. xviii, 260, 71 pi., 7 figs. Delhi etc., O.U.P., 1997, (cloth) ?17.99. The tide of the book is rather misleading. In it the author concentrates exclusively on a selection of "gods" and other spiritual personages of India. For him "gods" include buddhas and bodhisattvas of Buddhism and even Vardhamana Mahavira, the founder of Jainism, while the indigenous religions of Tibet, China and Japan are not dealt with. His book, as he himself describes it in the Preface, is therefore "Indocentric", and he justifies this stance by asserting that "an understanding of Asian art as a whole ... depends in large degree upon a working knowledge of the Indian prototypes". His aim is to provide a framework for such an understanding to the public who encounter Asian art in museums or at temple sites, and he does so by focusing on the interpretation of the meaning of those prototypes as it can be worked out from the mainstream or "classical" textual sources of the respective religious traditions. The reader, when viewing actual objects, would thus have a background against which he should be able not only to understand their mainstream religious significance, but to notice and appreciate also the historically and regionally produced variations which still continue to be developed on several levels in a never ceasing process within living religious traditions. This should correct the perception of Indian art as dead or irrelevant to the viewer's religious sensibilities which happens when the Indian images are presented to him only as objets d'art and treated "in quasi aesthetic and art historical terms by the writers of most popular publications on Asian art". The author's approach to this problem may indeed be a useful one, and it is well expressed by the subtide of his book, but it hardly justifies references to Asian art as a whole. It is of course tme that many religious icons of Indian origin penetrated into virtually the whole of Asia with the spread of Buddhism and Hindu, mainly epic, mythology. But Taoism and Shintoism and even Confucianism also significandy contributed to the art of Asia as a whole and certainly they have, besides incorporating divine figures borrowed from India, produced important gods or spiritual personages of their own. The selected material is presented in five parts. The first one, "Art in the Cults of Hinduism", identifies, in its first chapter on the "Instruments of Worship", the long route from worship in the open to the development of the idea of the house of god (devagrha) realised in a variety of temple structures, both simple and complex, and from the identification of gods by their names, epithets, actions and attributes to representing them as images and through symbols. All that came to be in time regulated by strict rules laid down in canons of iconographic symbolism. Underlying the enormous diversity of divine figures of Hinduism is the essential Hindu experience of deity as basically a unity which is testified to already by certain verses of the Rg Veda. Similarly, the "self perception of Indian civilisation" is characterised by a cultural unity which overshadows political and social diversity. The tension resulting from the tendency to unity amidst diversity translates itself into the themes of Hindu art and literature "in a resdess search for finality" which is represented by the ideal ofmoksa (salvation or liberation - which the author translates as "escape"). The subsequent four chapters deal, respectively, with Brahma, Siva, Visnu and the Goddess as the main Hindu prototypes of manifested divinity. The author traces their emergence and development in texts, pays attention to their relation to other deities, explains their function and significance in the cult and shows how some of these elements are as natural, spontaneous and as old as culture. They already appear as sexual metaphors in the Rg Veda and the Upanisads and are inevitable in bhakti cults. The profusion of united lovers on the temple friezes of Khajuraho and Konarak represent the eternal flow ofsamsara as well as the freedom from it in the final unity of the infinite Void. The book is obviously aimed at the general reader with a deeper interest in Indian art and religion</page><page sequence="2">Reviews of Books 283 than an average tourist or visitor to a museum or an art gallery might have. It would certainly serve that reader as an excellent introduction to the subject. The style is easy, the stories summarised from texts which supplement the instructive passages are well told, the 71 black and white plates are of acceptable quality, and even basic information on the individual Indian religions is given in case the reader is a total newcomer to the field. This means, of course, that the specialist will not learn anything new from the book, although students of comparative religion will gain a lot. While Brahma's images remained simple because of his role as creator with not much to do in the intermediary time between periods of creation, the iconography of Siva and Visnu became ever more complicated, especially through the development of the doctrine of divine incarnations which accelerated a process of absorption of tribal and regional cults. The emergence of the Goddess as a synthesis of a plethora of disparate regional and prehistoric goddess cults became inevitable. The resulting conception of the Great Goddess overshadowed the Vedic gods already in the Kena Upanisad and foreshadowed the "tannic revolution" which placed her, in imitation of the concept of brahman, "beyond the realm of tangible manifestation". Yet it also found its own peculiar forms of iconographic depiction, e.g. in the horrific forms of Kali. In advanced tantric practice, however, anthropomorphic images became irrelevant and were replaced by abstract diagrams (yantras and mandalas). In Part Two the author first summarises the familiar story of the Buddha's life, his teachings and the process of fragmentation of his order into sects after his death. The subsequent two chapters entided "Presence in Absence - The Foundations of Buddhist Art" and "A Shadow cast upon Cloth - The Buddha Image" explain the process of the evolution of Buddhist symbolism and imagery from simple beginnings (the Buddha's presence indicated only by an empty seat, his footprints etc.) to the elaborate figural representations of the three-body (tri-kaya) doctrine. In Part Three, "The Advanced Forms of Buddhism", the author deals with the imagery of Buddhist tantrism - the "Tathagata Pentad" and the iconography of the Bodhisattvas emanating from it. These often bear resemblance to Hindu deities with their many arms holding symbolic objects. Part Four is dedicated to Jainism which produced the Gujarati school of painting preserved in manuscript illuminations whose fluency contrasts with large-scale mural paintings which are more rigidly formal. The author explains the indebtedness of Jain mythology and iconography to Brahmanic-Hindu sources and of its cosmology to "the conventional wisdom and science of the late pre-Christian centuries". The "presence-in-absence" stage of referring to the departed founder, known from Buddhism, existed in the Jain context also, but was expressed in symbols indicative of abstract concepts pertaining to the doctrine. The image of the Jina emerged simultaneously with that of the Buddha, with his predecessors (ttrthahkaras) soon to follow, sometimes arranged in groups of four. Later more elaborate imagery encompassing the whole universe with attending Hindu deities, "knowledge-goddesses" (vidyadevis) and yogints was developed as expressed particularly in the temples of Mount Abu. Part Five called "Themes" concludes the work in four short chapters. "The Religious Functions of Myth" points out the unity of myth and cult and the predominant themes which are often depicted on sculptured relief compositions in temples; "Polarisation and the Dynamics of Myth" shows how incompatible aspects of reality are defined and sometimes resolved in symbolic terms which point beyond the mundane reality; "Sectarian Mythography", which is the author's term for the Indian phenomenon of elevating sectarian deities to the position of All-God within their own cult, shows how their separate cult icons nevertheless remain within the general mythological continuum; and in "Sexuality and Eroticism" the illustrated object can be seen (unless, of course, it is obvious that it is in situ). Naturally some views of the author could be challenged e.g. his dating of the Buddha, or his portrayal of the tantric sadhaka as "a psycho-sexual coward with a distinct tendency toward the</page><page sequence="3">284 Reviews of Books sadistic". There is one technical mistake in an illustration in the text: the Sri-cakra yantra on p. 109 is printed upside down (detectable only by carefully counting its triangles). A great disadvantage to students and even general readers who may be using dictionaries and encyclopedias is the method of transliteration of Sanskrit words adopted by the author: it is mosdy phonetic so that it does not discriminate different sibilants and omits diacritical marks, except the macron over long vowels (which, too, is missing on some occasions). This is disappointing in a book by an academic. The reason is not given; is it for the convenience of the printers or the author, or does he underestimate the need or the intelligence of the reader to cope with a method of transliteration which respects all letters of the Sanskrit alphabet?
