<plain_text><page sequence="1">GLENNA.ODOM South African Truth and Tragedy: Yael Farber's Motora and Reconciliation Aesthetics HIS REVIEW OF the Barbican theater's 2008 staging of Yael Farber's Molora, a South African re-envisioning of The Oresteia, London Times reviewer Sam Mar- lowe commented that the "extraordinary relocation of Greek myth to a Truth and Reconciliation Commission hearing in South Africa was among the most difficult experiences I have ever had in the theatre."1 Indeed, most of the reviews of this performance note feelings of dislocation, horror, and discomfort. Farber's skillful, but never easy, combination of Aristotelian tragic form and a contemporary South African aesthetic, springing from the TRC, creates this strong affective dimen- sion. In her discussion of the TRC as a narrative form, Claire Moon argues that "reconciliation is constructed and not inherent" and that this construction takes place through the narration of past events within a larger narrative of restorative rather than retributive justice (7-8). Molora, however, suggests that the recounting of past deeds may lead to either violence or reconciliation and that a cessation of violence is not synonymous with reconciliation. Tragedy and reconciliation con- tain contradictory impulses: tragedy requires a universal space, whereas recon- ciliation tends to emphasize a specific, monumentalized space; tragedy removes individuals from community, whereas reconciliation subsumes the individual story within the communal; tragedy involves the expiation of emotion by means of catharsis, whereas reconciliation requires both the expiation of emotion and the creation of new emotion; tragedy requires closure, whereas reconciliation is explicitly continuous. Molora sanctions neither alternative: it averts the immedi- ate tragic fate of its characters in a space at once general and specific, and it con- cludes without completing either the narrative of reconciliation or the telos of 1 The Barbican performance was the British premiere of the play, and the stage directions with the published version of the text reflect this production more closely than the opening productions in South Africa, where it premiered at the Grahamstown National Festival of the Arts in 2003. After its South African premier, Färber continued to develop the script at the Market Theater in Johannes- burg. Future references to specific staging of the play refer to the Barbican production as docu- mented in the Barbican's photo archive and the text itself.

A great deal of criticism has been generated about African adaptations of Greek tragedy, but, at the time I write this, no critical piece has yet been published on Yael Farber's Molora, nor, indeed, has the rest of Farber's work drawn academic attention. As regards adaptations of Greek tragedy in Africa more generally, Kevin Wetmore argues that the plays do not appropriate this highly valued form of West- ern theater in order to challenge colonial power. Instead, Wetmore argues that "African tragedy is more compatible with Aristotle's definition than most Western neoclassical tragedies" because hamartia is figured as "a rooting of tragic action in the choice of the protagonist, which ... is more congruent with the African belief system" (49). While Wetmore briefly acknowledges indigenous theories of trag- edy, he reads these in terms of their relationship to Western tragedy - a relation- ship that Wetmore insists is extremely close. Wetmore's reading focuses on "exploi- tations of similarities of cultures . . . the affinity that the target culture or individual artist feels for the original culture enables the transcultural process" (39-40). These cultural similarities between Africa and Greece - anthropomorphic gods, colonial relations, a focus on orality, notions of self that "differ significantly from the modern European notion of identity" - overshadow Wetmore's analysis of the distinctly African contexts of these adapted works (40). Analyses of South African adaptations and performances of Shakespearean tragedy are both more numerous and varied in focus. Natasha Diller, for example, highlights a "carefully worked-through humanism [which] can accommodate dif- ference" (4), thus displaying a strong universalizing impulse that mirrors Wet- more's. Indeed, for Diller, Shakespeare, in his distinct South African manifesta- tions, marks South Africa's move into a postcolonial modernity that is, despite her occasional acknowledgments of "the presences of the hegemony of West- ern power," relatively indistinguishable from Western modernity. At the opposite end of the spectrum, Martin Orkin argues vehemently against the conservative hegemonic impulse to read adaptations and performances of Shakespeare in this manner. Orkin analyzes specific performances of Shakespeare and suggests re-readings, new editorial choices, and new modes of criticism that emerge from an engagement with Shakespeare in local contexts - an engagement that in his view differs markedly from academic performances of Shakespeare as a represen- tation of "culture." Yet Orkin's focus on the politics of critical responses to readings of Shakespeare ironically reflects an academic concern altogether separate from that of the specific blendings of multiple aesthetic traditions that I explore below. One would think that critics who focus on a particular adaptation rather than trying to outline a methodology for understanding adaptations generally would be more attentive to the specific questions raised by the texts they examine, but that has not been the case. In fact, the existing examinations of this sort tend to frame arguments in terms of syncretism (Zabus), transculturation (Wetmore), marginality (Raji), or canonical counter-discourse (Weyenberg, Budelmann). In other words, they are more invested in the relationship between a particular play and its Greek counterpart than in the relationship between that play and its indig- enous context. In what follows, I leave the more general discussions of the place of adaptation in postcolonial theory to the other critics and focus instead on the</page><page sequence="3">SOUTH AFRICAN TRUTH 8c TRAGEDY / 49 effects of Farber 's combination of two goals that are largely incompatible: the retributive justice of Greek tragedy and the restorative justice of the TRC. Molora is, of course, also concerned with the power structures of colonialism, but it is the sublimation of these concerns into the incomplete patterns of retributive and restorative justice that are distinct to this play.2 Farber's work is one of a long line of plays that treat the TRC in one way or another - attempting to come to grips with the magnitude of the crimes commit- ted, questioning the efficacy of reconciliation, or demonstrating the complicity of most citizens in the atrocities that led to the formation of the TRC in the first place. As Stephanie Marlin-Curiel points out, "the discord underlying the terms truth and reconciliation, which cannot coexist easily in a consensual national nar- rative . . . bore repetitions in performance outside of the hearings themselves" (13). 3 The continual replaying of the TRC's mission in theatrical settings implies that the process of reconciliation remains incomplete for at least some portions of the South African Nation. The early theatrical productions involving the TRC dealt primarily with sorting out or identifying the immediate issues raised by the commission. For instance, Khulumani Support Group's The Story Fm About to Tell provides a direct, raw presentation of testimonies by torture victims that, in Mar- lin-Curiers phrase, attempts to "salvage meaning" (14) from the many questions raised by the TRC. Jane Taylor's and William Kentridge's Ubu and the Truth Commis- sion, on the other hand, blends puppetry, projection, and live actors in a perfor- mance that highlights the impossibility of salvaging the entire truth, although its fragmentary nature does allow for momentary glimpses of something that might be considered truth. In Ubu justice is separate from reconciliation, a concept that the play questions more by its absence than by its presence. Molora also focuses on the ongoing process of reconciliation implied by the TRC's structure. To this end, Färber presents testimony from both victims and perpetrators and, in doing so, blurs the line between them. The constant choric interventions emphasize questions of reconciliation and guilt. As with the Orestia, Molora's Klytemnestra has killed Agamemnon and exiled Orestes. Klytemnestra has also tortured Elektra, who is working as a slave in Ayesthus's house.4 Orestes kills Ayesthus, but here the similarities to the Orestia end. Elektra and Orestes do not kill Klytemnestra and, instead, break down in tears. The chorus of Xhosa women praises the communal ancestors, and Klytemnestra speaks the final lines of the text as ash falls on the stage. In Molora, reconciliation is presented not as 2 Molora can also be placed within the broader context of theater as a means of political statement in South Africa, Africa, and the non-Western world more generally. In this regard, I find Christo- pher Balme's insistence on finding the indigenous context of every performance particularly com- pelling as a methodological precept (see Decolonizing the Stage). In the South African context, see Robert Kavanagh's Theatre and Cultural Struggle in South Africa, a careful reading of the development of theater in South Africa, which culminates in specific situated explanations of the cultural, polit- ical, aesthetic, and philosophical contexts of a number of plays. 3 Marlin-Curiel's work also provides a situated reading of the actor/ audience relationship to the actual victims and perpetrators in theatrical responses to the TRC. Although Molora establishes a different relationship, Marlin-Curiel's analysis of the TRC's revisions of the perennial theoretical question regarding the "truth" of a representation onstage is extremely useful. 4 Hereafter, in keeping with Molora's text, the spellings "Klytemnestra," "Elektra," and "Ayesthus" will refer to the characters in Molora while "Clytemnestra," "Electra," and "Aegisthus" will refer to those in the Orestia. "Orestes" remains the same in both contexts.</page><page sequence="4">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE / 50 something that has happened, or even as something that will happen, but as some- thing that could happen. This temporary cessation of violence is not a reconcilia- tion or a cathartic resolution to a tragedy: indeed, the mix of Greek tragic form and reconciliation aesthetics prevents either of these forms from reaching closure within the play. Space: Monument, Ritual, and Spectacle The spatial logics of reconciliation are different from those of tragedy, and performances of Molora treat space in a manner that borrows characteristics from both. As Heidi Grunebaum-Ralph has argued, both the TRC's work and the preservation of Robben Island allow "the reciprocal relationship between narrative, memory, and place" to make visible "processes by which the individual life story becomes metonymy for the collective" (199). This transmutation of personal tragedy into public memorial is also, for Grunebaum-Ralph, location specific. National stories, reconciliatory or otherwise, are inextricably linked to the specific spatial arrangement of the nation. While the spatial arrangement of Molora references the past, it does not per- form the monumentalizing function required to convert this past into a collec- tive narrative. The actors' manipulation of the stage clearly subordinates the environment to the story: "The chorus moves to the table . . . upon which Klytem- nestra sits. They lift the table and move it stage center with Klytemnestra borne aloft. A sacrificial lamb? A Drunken Queen in her chariot?" (66). This move- ment shifts the scene from Klytemnestra's bed-chamber to the dining area of the house, but neither setting has distinct characteristics beyond the events that take place in it. It is the transition between the two spaces that is meaningful, because this progress is part of the narrative constructed for the characters. Insofar as the past exists within a space in Molora, that space is not transformed into a physical location that functions as a monument or memorial; rather, it is all too easy to forget.5 The key exception to this fluidity is that testimonials in Molora take place in a physical arrangement "much like the drab, simple venues in which most of the testimonies were heard during the course of South Africa's Truth and Reconcilia- tion Commission: Two large, old tables - each with a chair - face one another on the opposite ends of the playing space . . . upon each table is a microphone" (19). In such moments Färber is not monumentalizing a particular space but referenc- ing a spatial arrangement made familiar by its repeated recreation. The strongly ritualized nature of the TRC hearings - lighting a "solitary peace candle," wear- ing ecclesiastical robes, swearing secular or religious oaths, rising when witnesses entered - was an attempt to give the space and the hearings a symbolic impor- tance, even though many were held in "civic halls and churches" built by white settlers (Goodman 126). The lighting of the candle in particular marks the cre- ation of a "sacred" space designated for a specific purpose. Like monumentaliza- tion, ritual is a method of ascribing meaning to spaces. But, although it evokes the TRC hearings, Molora involves neither ritualizing nor monumentalizing. 5 Molora thus differs markedly from Athol Fugard's The Island, a play about a South African per- formance of Antigone in which the physicality of prison is omnipresent.</page><page sequence="5">SOUTH AFRICAN TRUTH 8c TRAGEDY / 51 Molorďs use of space is also different from that implied in Aristotle's poetics. Aristotle says that "spectacle [opsis - something seen, physical appearance], though an attraction, is the least artistic of all the parts" of a tragedy (1450B): spectacle exists only inasmuch as it is useful for conveying the actions of the char- acters; it does not endure as a ritual marker or monument. Once the action has passed through it, the space of the tragedy is without meaning of its own. Spatially, Molava tends towards the generalizability of tragedy rather than the monumental- izing implied by a narrative of national reconciliation, but, as noted, the actors manipulate the space, implying that the spectacle itself is part of the action and not simply a static backdrop for it. Molorďs use of space is at once too specifically referential to provide the universal empty canvas of tragedy, too fluid to provide merely a necessary element of the action, and too general to provide the sort of spatial memorialization of events required by the TRC hearings. It is an in-between space, a space tied to memory but not wholly contained within a specific time. On the Teleology of Tragedy and the Process of Reconciliation Just as Molora exists uneasily between several potential deployments of space, it also evokes several temporal possibilities. The explicit purpose of the TRC was to allow South Africa to move forward from its past, and thus reconciliation explic- itly involves change and progress. The tragic aesthetic is linked to the principle of repetition, at least on a metaphysical level. We must be able to identify with the suffering of the tragic figures on stage, and this identification assumes that the human condition has not changed. This is the tragedy of tragedy: it cannot move forward. Molora takes the tragic teleology, the certainty of a beginning and an end, but also the certainty of repetition, and uses the TRC's narrative to restruc- ture both beginning and end through repetition to create a new future. The play is, for a brief moment, reconciliatory. The final moments in Molora, however, take place not in relationship to the future, but outside of time entirely, a location which unseats the temporalities of both tragedy and reconciliation. In The Burden of Memory, the Burden of Forgiveness Wole Soyinka argues that the chronology of the narrative of reconciliation has important barriers to overcome: "And then - to argue for the equitable stricture of law - since we deplore the application of retroactive law, a law that today punishes acts that were committed when such acts did not constitute crimes, do we tend to sense a moral distortion in a proceeding that pursues the opposite - pardons a crime through retroactive dis- pensation?" (14). The TRC requires a linear narrative: the past must remain the past and is only brought into the present by testimony so that the future can be made clear. As Soyinka points out, this linearity requires not just a re-speaking of the past, but a rewriting of it. Furthermore, while Soyinka is insistent that "the Truth must be set free" - that documents, archives, stories, and state secrets be brought to light - he questions whether Truth can be "the justification, as the sole exaction or condition for Reconciliation" (13). For Soyinka, this justification is also a question of temporality. Although he notes that most African societies have struc- tures for dealing with severe infractions of moral codes (usually exile), he also recognizes that "a singularly atrocious act appeared to be denied closure until the perpetrator returned to expiate on the scene of the crime," and asks: "are we then perhaps moving too far ahead of our violators in adopting a structure of response</page><page sequence="6">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE / 52 that tasks us with a collective generosity of spirit, especially in the face of ongoing violations of body and spirit?" (14). The idea of reconciliation must preexist the truth upon which it is supposed to be dependent: the victim must personally adopt a structure of reconciliation, available at a collective level, in order to create / hear the Truth that is supposed to bring about this reconciliation. As Lars Burr and oth- ers have pointed out, the TRC was popularly referred to as the Truth Commission, not the Reconciliation Commission (66), because, whereas the truth was present and apparent, albeit in a form modulated by the structures of the TRC, reconcilia- tion was less immediately measurable. The existence of reconciliation in the future relies on the ability of the present to transform the past into an already existing possibility of reconciliation through the exposure of truth. According to Soyinka's logic, reconciliation must always already exist, both before Truth and after it. This pre-existence requires a simultaneous remembrance and forgetting. As Grunebaum-Ralph argues, the specific narrative structure of the TRC not only memorializes, it also contains (202). By reconstituting and repeating the past, this narrative at once makes that past into a part of the future of the country and "forgets" it, except insofar as reconciliation requires one to move beyond a particu- lar transgression. Just as reconciliation must have always already existed, so the TRC treated truth as "a body of common knowledge that just had to be 'acknowl- edged'" (Buur 66) in order to become a monument to reconciliation. Anything that was not "found" by the TRC was excluded from this truth and erased from the narrative of the nation's past. Molora, then, must negotiate between the tragic and reconciliatory modes of time and their implied connections to individual and community. First and most obviously, the text blurs the line between past and present by having the actors move fluidly from testimony to the embodiment of events. The narration of past events catches up with the present upon the arrival of Orestes, after which none of the characters explicitly speaks in "testimony" form, although within the con- text of the play's present, Klytemnestra reminisces about her lighting of signal fires and murder of Agamemnon. Where then does Molora begin? The first line of the play, as the chorus set up the stage, is sung in Xhosa: "Ho laphalal'igazi [Blood has been spilt here]."6 Far- ber then notes "the hearings have begun" (20-21). The beginning of the hear- ing, which is itself a recollection of events, is preceded by a marker of the past. The hearings cannot begin, in fact, until the stage has been set in the most literal sense. The women create the physical arrangement of the space, and the chorus speaks their opening line as they are performing this act. There is doubling of beginnings here, a lack of clarity. There is always an event that has come before. Blood has been spilt, which allows or necessitates the beginning of the testimony that will, in turn, lead to the arrival of Orestes and the eventual culmination of the attempted revenge/potential reconciliation. Aristotle says that a tragedy must have a clear beginning and a clear ending. Not surprisingly, given the temporal conflations of its opening, Molora's ending is also more ambiguous than the tragic telos would suggest: 6 While Färber translates all the Xhosa in the text of the play, the character of the translator only translates a few lines for the audience during a performance. All translations appearing in this article are taken from Farber's printed text of the play.</page><page sequence="7">SOUTH AFRICAN TRUTH 8c TRAGEDY / 53 It falls softly the residue of revenge . . . like rain. And we who made the sons and daughters of this land, servants in the halls of their forefathers . . . We know. We are still only here by grace alone. Look now - dawn is coming. Great chains on the home are falling off. This house rises up. For too long it has lain in ash on the ground. (87; emphasis added) Klytemnestra speaks these lines as ash falls on the stage. The lines that I have italicized are a direct translation from The Libation Bearers, where they occur just before Orestes sees the Furies, who come to punish him for killing his mother.7 However, inasmuch as Klytemnestra lives at the end of Farber's work, there can be no Furies, and thus no tragic resolution. It would be easy, then, to say that Farber's work mirrors the narrative structure of the TRC - that through testimony recon- ciliation has been achieved. This reading, however, does not account for the audi- ence response - a long, uncomfortable silence - or the specific Xhosa context of these lines. The ash that falls on the stage as Klytemnestra speaks - presumably the "residue" of "revenge" - bears a special place in Xhosa culture. First, "people who are neither of the royal line nor diviners are characterized as abantwana bo thuthu . . . (children of the ash-heap) " (Mabona 192). Traditionally, Xhosa people stacked ash in a specific location, and the ash heap came to be a marker of the community, a marker specifically connected "in a special way with the ancestors" (196). The phrase "children of the ash-heap" thus gestures toward the past, pres- ent, and future of the community. Ash falling across the whole stage, then, could be read as an attempt by the ancestors to broaden the notion of community. Rather than comprising a localized ash-heap that marks a particular settlement, thé ash is spread equally among all the participants on stage. This reading, however, cannot exist in isolation from the obvious negative asso- ciations of the falling ash - associations that permeate Klytemnestra's lines and that would, presumably, have been more immediately apparent to the Barbican audience of the tour. There is also a Xhosa proverb that says, roughly, "when two fires meet, only ash will be left." Ash in its proper place might mark community, but here the house has "lain in ash" too long. The fires have neither destroyed the house nor reinforced the community. The chains "are falling off," but have not yet done so entirely. This ending presents neither the total uncertainty that characterizes the conclusion of The Libation Bearers, nor the resolution that is finally achieved at the end of The Eumenides. The story is "complete," but - for the main characters - nothing has really changed. Molora's past, then, is subject neither to the processes of reconciliation nor to the requirements of tragedy. By placing vivid moments of testimony within both a context that blurs the lines between past, present, and future and a narrative that ends ambiguously, Molora suggests that, if reconciliation is to be achieved, it will have to be achieved repeatedly - and only partially. 7 Since portions of Molora are set as testimonials of past events, the direct or adapted quotations from Aeschylus are not presented in chronological order. That being said, however, these final lines are found later in the trilogy than any others Färber employs. Färber does quote twice from Iphegenia at Aulis, but these quotations describe events that precede The Orestia.</page><page sequence="8">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE / 54 Testimony and Bearing Witness: Audience, Catharsis, and the Question of Community While the ash-heap is a symbol of temporality, it also signifies community. Indeed, the relationship between individual and community is one of the primary concerns of both tragic form and the narrative of the TRC. If the audience of a tragedy is to experience catharsis, they must be at once separate from the action of the individual characters and emotionally connected to it. Likewise, the testi- monial structure of the TRC requires four positions - witnesses, victims, perpe- trators, and judges - that imply different degrees of connection to individual action. As preexisting forms that seek communal response to individual action in a prescribed way, both tragedy and reconciliation also sublimate individual lived experience into communal narrative. In the case of Molora, the individual story is at once marked as unique and folded into a larger narrative, both for the charac- ters who are part of the testimonial structure within the play and for the members of its audience, who participate in the potential reconciliation or tragedy of the play. In Theatre as Witness, Färber developed her earlier plays through interviews with the people who would become the central characters. By explicitly focusing on the witness who "gives voice to that which the objective narrative of history tends to overlook and even suppress" (10), they immediately call into question the place of the individual story within the collective narrative of the TRC. The TRC testimony doesn't "give voice" to something outside of history; on the contrary, it incorporates that voice into history. Thus, if the potential for reconciliation in Molora resides in the testimony of individual actions, these individual actions only signify in light of the collective narrative's struggle to exist. In other words, although the individuals in Molora do not reconcile as a community, the absence of this communal reconciliation does suggest the narratives to which the actions could belong. The tension between community and individual - along with the multiplicity of temporalities and spatial arrangements - situates the audience in a place where neither catharsis nor reconciliation is possible. Giving voice to history does not create a change in the characters' situations, even though an emotional journey is bound up in the testimonial structure of the play. Given Molora's combination of testimony and tragedy, one would expect one of two things to be true: either the play becomes a focal point for audience identification, through which we expe- rience the same catharsis or reconciliation as the characters, or the play creates enough narrative distance to allow spectators to judge its events and thereby expe- rience catharsis or reconciliation independently of the characters. Molora, how- ever, steadfastly resists both options. We are placed at once inside and outside the community - witnesses to the testimony, but not actors in the narrative. The ambiguous place of the audience accentuates the tension between individ- ual experience and collective narrative that is at the core of the TRC's project. When testimony is considered in the context of reconciliation, "the teleology of the individual social mind is often at war with the collective" (Soyinka 14). Gov- ernment officials told the South African community to affirm a mode of restor- ative justice that was central to the TRC's narrative, but, as Mahmood Mamdani points out, this particular definition of restorative justice limited "social debate on how to go beyond the political reconciliation between state agents (perpetrators)</page><page sequence="9">SOUTH AFRICAN TRUTH 8c TRAGEDY / 55 and political activists (victims as a minority) to a social reconciliation between beneficiaries [of the colonial situation] and victims" (60). While Mamdani focuses on the colonial implications that were glossed over in the TRC narrative, Mark Sanders argues, similarly, that the initial structure of the TRC limited the place of women within the narrative, since the TRC did not give much attention to the "forced removals and detentions" that were almost daily interruptions in women's lives (60). Since "the South African community" as a monolithic entity was a cre- ation of the newly elected government, its interpellation into the narrative was a fait accompli. The individual or particular subsections of the community (for example, women), however, may have a very different relationship to the TRC nar- rative as it attempts to subsume this difference. This potential tension (or condi- tion) has been one of the questions with which theatrical reworkings of the TRC have grappled, and it continues to loom as an insoluble question many years after the formation of the TRC. As Paul Ricoeur points out, testimony involves not only a retelling of events, but also the creation of a connection between those events and a transcendent prin- ciple: "an idea at the heart of experience and history which nonetheless transcends experience and history" (119-20). Ricouer emphasizes the fact that testimony is only quasi-empirical because it "is not perception itself but the report" (123). Yet, seeing and reporting are incomplete actions in themselves: even the repetition of the events onstage does not complete the testimony. The testimony only becomes complete when, through judgment, it "transcends experience and history." This transcendence, here the always already status of reconciliation, must also displace the individual within his or her community, for whereas the testimony transcends history and experience, the individual does not. The possible narrative structures preexist and presuppose the role of the testifier and the possibility of judgment. Individual experiences gain meaning through their interpellation into the tes- timony structure, even as the uniqueness or specificity of those experiences is decreased by positioning them within a preset narrative. This explains why, as Buur points out, the TRC refused to hear cases that did not fit within its narrative structure - specifically, acts of violence with no immediate political motivation - and in doing so denied these other victims and perpetrators their place in the narrative of reconciliation (70). Molora further blurs Ricouer's line between report and experience: for instance, in one case, Färber specifies that an act of "suffocation should be performed for longer than the audience would be comfortable with" (48). She also insists that the torture be a "direct visual reference to the 'Wet Bag Method' - graphically demonstrated at the Truth Commission" (19). As members of the play's audience, we are thus bearing witness to a recreation of an actual act of torture, while at the same time also bearing witness to a prior witnessing of a prior recreation. In The- atre as Witness Färber remarks that the "audience needs to be transported from indifference to empathy, from their own limited perspective to deep inside the interior landscape of another person's world" (20). In setting up the stage in a manner that directly references the TRC, Färber invokes this well-documented tension between actor and audience. As much as the audience may wish to draw a distinction between our lived experience and what we see onstage, Färber com- ments that her work "should never be played . . . behind a proscenium arch . . . contact with the audience must be immediate and dynamic, with the audience</page><page sequence="10">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE / 56 complicit - experiencing the story as witnesses or participants in the room, rather than as voyeurs" (19). As a result, Farber's predominately female cast implicitly speaks to daily lived experience as well as to the more dramatic instances of vio- lence, and, in doing so, ensures that any judgment that might emerge will emerge from the relationship among victims, witnesses, the accused, and perpetrators. Curiously, although the violence within the testimony is presented directly to the audience, the violence occurring in the play's "present" - the murder of Ayesthus - is metonymically presented by filling boots, which Elektra has earlier used to recreate Agamemnon's last steps, with blood. Molora thus subjects its audience most vividly to the effects of a violence that has already been made into narrative. Why would the past (testimony) be staged more vividly than the present (Ayesthus's murder)? Because the reconciliation of the TRC required at least the appearance of unfiltered truth, the graphic violence of the past must be placed within the structure of testimony by formal witnesses if it is to be reconciliatory. Why is this not also the case with Ayesthus's murder? This too is an act of violence, and its status as revenge does not exclude it from the logic of the TRC. Shouldn't it also be portrayed graphically, witnessed, and thereby interpellated, into the structure of reconciliation? The answer to this question lies in the difference between catharsis and recon- ciliation. The relationship of pity and fear to catharsis in Aristotle's Politics and Poetics is of course notoriously ambiguous. Fear and pity may be the emotions that are purged from the mind, they may be the mechanism by which the mind is purged, or they may be a corollary phenomenon with no direct causal relation- ship to catharsis. Furthermore, The Poetics does not clarify whether fear, pity, and catharsis occur at the level of the spectator, within the play itself, or in both at once. But, in any case, the tragic cycle ends with the representation of a moment beyond catharsis. The representation of the violence of the present by means of metonymy would allow for a limited sort of catharsis were it then contained within a tragic teleology. However, the continuation into the future implied by the recon- ciliatory moves at the end of Molora prevents this from occurring at the same time that the tragic impulse to create an ending by containing violence prevents the full movement into reconciliation. Even if catharsis did occur, bearing witness within the context of the TRC pushes beyond it.8 Not only must negative emotions of some sort be purged, but they must also be replaced by reconciliation. Furthermore, because for Aristotle virtue requires individual action, it differs markedly from reconciliation, which is a communal state of mind. One cannot perform the actions of reconciliation, and yet the TRC's version of reconciliation was performative inasmuch as it was spoken into being. In addition, whereas Aristotle is careful to identify the quali- ties in a play that make it worthy of teaching virtue, the TRC specified only viola- tions "of a sufficient magnitude." There was no formal requirement, no ritual to enact beyond the speaking of truth. Ultimately, however, it is the division between victim and perpetrator in the TRC that separates its process most clearly from that of tragedy. In tragedy the concept hamartia implies that the hero has committed an offense, the consequences of which make that hero the central, if 8 My thanks to Zyme Burris for the hours of debates we had about the precise relationship between catharsis and testimony.</page><page sequence="11">SOUTH AFRICAN TRUTH &amp; TRAGEDY / 57 not sole, victim. Although the TRC perpetrators were certainly required to achieve a tragic recognition of their faults, the penalty for their crime was explic- itly not part of the staging of the TRC. Motora, however, leaves us with violence that is too graphic to allow for cathar- tic closure and too mediated to provide the truth necessary for reconciliation. Indeed, the uncertainty in the ending of the text accentuates the need for cathar- sis and/or reconciliation without providing either. Just before Elektra can kill Klytemnestra, the "women of the Chorus move swiftly as one and grab Elektra and overpower her. Elektra screams in rage . . . they cradle her like a child. She rages against them and finally breaks down, weeping for every injustice of the past" (85). Elektra's anger is purged, but not through her experience of witnessing or narrating the truth of the events that have occurred. It is the intervention of the community that allows Elektra to release her anger - or at least to commute the anger into sorrow. She experiences the beginning of a cathartic moment, but there is no suggestion of any future actions by which we might gauge Elektra's progress toward virtue. Klytemnestra, too, experiences catharsis: she is "a broken woman . . . humbled" (85), purged of her pride and potentially her anger. The chorus sings a song of praise, which, through its connection both to the past (ancestors) and to the future, again suggests that the testimony we have heard has served its purpose and transcended the historical moment. This transcendence is marked as incom- plete, however, inasmuch as the song does not represent an act of judgment and is therefore an interruption in the mechanism of testimony. Judgment is absent from the end of Molora in a way that it is not absent from either the TRC hearings or from the Orestia. Most obviously, judgment is absent because the judge is absent - no gods appear on stage, the chorus is part of the testimony, and the audience is also a witness. Färber notes that, curiously, "at the most brutal and savage moments of a story - they [South African audience members] laugh! .... It's a laughter of recognition, of survival - a laughter of somebody tapping into the secrets of the community. It is an extended shattered kind of cry" (Witness 28). This laughter is not catharsis, because the process is ongoing, an "extended cry"; it is both com- munal and individual, distant from the events and immediately implicated in them. It is a laughter that acknowledges the possibility of catharsis and/or recon- ciliation, while simultaneously recognizing the distance yet to travel. Reconciliation requires proximity and catharsis requires distance, and the testi- monial structure of Farber's play simultaneously presents and precludes these options. The present time of the play, with its self-conscious staging of symbols and control over the stage, is too close to us for the characters' catharsis to substi- tute for ours and too distant for the potential reconciliation to reach us. The break in temporality that creates this divide signals that, even if we were to identify with the characters' emotional trajectory, this trajectory is not universal. It does not exist outside of time in the manner necessary to universalize the individual, con- vey a tragic moral lesson, or create a reconciled country. Moreover, the fact that the "present" is difficult to locate within the text, while functioning on a different set of theatrical principles from the rest of the play, suggests that reconciliation is performed in a way that memory is not. The past is real, but the play prevents the conflation of past, present, and future into a tidy dramatic or narrative structure.</page><page sequence="12">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE / 58 Ubuntu and Retributive Justice Although Molorďs lack of a judge - whether in the form of a god or higher power - seems to signal a lack of transcendence within a tragic Western under- standing of testimony, when reread through Xhosa ideas of community and audi- ence, this transcendence may be achieved precisely because all parties participate in the judgment. Likewise, the division between community and individual is fig- ured differently in Xhosa culture than in Western tragedy. Given the TRC's explicit evocation of ubuntu and the prevalence of this concept in Xhosa philosophy, it is worth considering this notion of community apart from either tragic or reconcilia- tory forms of narrative. While the various communities within Molora do not inter- act in a manner that indicates an experience/practice of ubuntu, Molorďs adher- ence to the distinctively Xhosa idea of the morality of the individual in relationship to the community does prevent the execution of retributive justice. According to Nomonde Masina, ubuntu is "the embodiment of the political, cultural, economic, and social dynamics of African society," and the word itself is shared by both Xhosa and Zulu (169). Roughly translated, ubuntu means "collec- tive personhood" (170). Desmond Tutu's definition of ubuntu is perhaps the most relevant, but is also problematic inasmuch as Tutu shaped ubuntu to fit the goals of the TRC even as he formed the TRC around the concept of ubuntu. Having ubuntu means that "you are generous, you are hospitable, you are friendly and caring and compassionate .... It is to say 'My humanity is caught up, is inextricably bound up, in yours'" (31). Tutu insists that this community is not a loss of individu- ality, because without each individual voice the whole would be diminished. On the subject of individual and community, Masina says the following: " Ubuntu as an orientation of life is opposed to individualism and insensitive competitiveness. Neither is it comfortable with collectivism where collectivism stresses the impor- tance of the social unit to the point of depersonalizing the individual. At the same time it places great importance on working for the common good" (170). Balance is a key aspect of this philosophy, which values the union of oppo- sites: individual and community, memory and forgetting. Thus, ubuntu yields "'both/and' conclusions, contrasted with the Christian idea of good or evil with its 'either/or' conclusions" (Masina 170). Within the logic of ubuntu, "what dehu- manizes you inexorably dehumanizes me" (Tutu 31). Masina and Tutu both treat this potential mixing of individual and communal values as a positive thing: Ubuntu, therefore, "seeks to find a balance between self and other, the destructive and the creative, good and bad. It moves away from thinking of social relations in dualistic oppositions, that is, an either/or situation, good versus bad, black versus white, self versus other, in seeking to resolve conflict" (Masina 180-81). However, as Claire Moon and others argue, any such mixing can create a ten- sion between the individual and the national/communal. While this binary dis- tinction is precisely one of the things ubuntu seeks to erase, this erasure must be generated by all those involved, or it runs the risk of subjugating individuals to a particularly well-meaning ideology.9 As Richard Wilson notes, ubuntu also short- circuited the constitutional right of citizens to due process when amnesty was 9 I am indebted to Eric Ritter for his willingness to share his research and his intuitions on the subject of ubuntu - and for his willingness to discuss early drafts of this project.</page><page sequence="13">SOUTH AFRICAN TRUTH &amp; TRAGEDY / 59 required: "ubuntu redefined human rights such that human rights became sub- ordinated to national political imperatives that favored national unity" (13). As if in opposition to Masina's and Tutu's conceptions of ubuntu, Molora accen- tuates the differences between its various groups; whatever reconciliation hap- pens in the play happens within groups, not among them. The chorus sings and speaks primarily in Xhosa.10 Klytemnestra speaks exclusively in English while Electra moves between both languages. A translator appears onstage only for sec- tion I and translates a small portion of Klytemnestra's speech into Xhosa. This accentuates the linguistic difference between Klytemnestra and the chorus. At the TRC hearings, the "chorus" was the community. Klytemnestra is thus marked as outside the community, and Elektra is marked as inside it. This linguistic sepa- ration is significant, because Elektra, in moving between the two groups, could provide a space for reconciliation, whereas Klytemnestra lacks a communal iden- tification through which reconciliation could occur. In the final moments of the play, the chorus of Xhosa women huddle around Elektra and Orestes, while the only white character onstage, Klytemnestra, delivers the final lines. Any poten- tial catharsis or reconciliation offered by Elektra is immediately called into ques- tion by this separation. While the community in Molora does not exhibit ubuntu, the text also does not affirm a Western notion of retributive justice. Indeed, when read in relation to its Greek source material, this distance becomes clear. Tutu used ubuntu to pit black "African" values against "Western" values, remarking that "retributive jus- tice is largely Western" and that the ubuntu understanding of justice is "far more restorative - not so much to punish as to redress or restore a balance that has been knocked askew" (Moon 36). This restorative justice, with or without the idea of restitution, is predicated on the Xhosa beliefs that the intlizyo or urnoya - both loosely translated as "emotions" - may be misguided or evil and that this evil is a pathology that can be cured: "intlizyo embi [bad emotion] . . . does not directly imply an intrinsic personal or collective responsibility. Such states are . . . amena- ble to treatment through medication [by a diviner]" (Mabona 344). Thus, while the perpetrators of "isolated moral or legal trespasses" can be held individually responsible, larger-scale or repeated trespasses are traditionally thought to have come from a treatable condition, not from an inherent flaw in character. In order for ubuntu to function, one must have a conception of humanity both as individu- ally and collectively "good" and as amenable to correcting the problems that pre- vent this inherent goodness from emerging. Molora is ambiguous in its affirmation of this principle as well. The final lines of Molora are a citation of The Libation Bearers, which in their original context are immediately followed by these words: Time, which brings all things to pass, will soon move through these doors, once purifying rites expel polluting evil. (1120) 10 While the title of the play is a Sesotho word, as Färber points out, the chorus was developed with the help of the Ngqoko Cultural group in an effort to ground the play in a rural Xhosa aesthetic. That, along with the TRC's focus on ubuntu, is why I explore the Xhosa cultural resonances of this play at the expense of relating it to other indigenous South African groups, although, given the rich- ness of Farber's text, a further contextualization would doubtless be fruitful.</page><page sequence="14">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE / 60 These lines are in keeping with the idea that moral transgressions are the result of a pollution or illness and can thus be cured by the removal of the evil. The literal removal that occurs, however, is that of Orestes from the community. The Greek text, then, explicitly asks whether individuals are evil or merely manifestations of a corruption within society. Molora prevents the audience from answering these questions. Traditional Xhosa values rely on the idea that a single society is func- tioning correctly most of the time, but we are never given this baseline in Molora. While both Klytemnestra and Elektra are broken at the end of the play, it is not clear that this will lead to an expiation of whatever forces caused the initial con- flict, and this in turn raises once again the question of beginnings and endings. If we do not know where we begin or where we end, we cannot gauge the health of the society; individual actions remain, but are protected from judgment. It is important to note that my analysis of Molora relies on constructed notions of tragedy, community, space, time, catharsis, and reconciliation: it is an explora- tion of issues raised by the TRC and by tragic form, not a total rejection of either. The TRC's narrative, Moon argues, assumes that "truth leads to reconciliation, that truth heals, that there can be no reconciliation without an account of past atrocity and that amnesty best furthers reconciliation because retributive justice disturbs rather than promotes it" (6). For this to occur requires a conception of past, present, and future, a separation of victims from perpetrators, the participa- tion of a community, and the construction of a category of events defined as "gross violations of human rights."11 Moon points out that the specificity of indi- vidual stories, even while recorded, is decreased by the insistence upon a national narrative of reconciliation. While Moon laments the loss of individuality, Heidi Grunebaum-Ralph suggests that the incorporation of individual stories into a public communal narrative is instrumental in "validating" these stories even as it "subsumes the individual into a homogenous and disembodied narrative of col- lectivity" (198). In Aristotle's view, spectators connect with the tragic performers through their empathetic experience of fear and pity. While this catharsis might have created communal cohesion, as argued by Paul Cartledge, Aristotle does not explicitly discuss the communal aspect of theater, nor, indeed, do many critics of the Western theatrical tradition until Bertolt Brecht. The performances of the TRC, on the other hand, have an explicit communal function, even while main- taining a distance between spectator and audience as required by the heuristics of a testimony system. Molora is equally communal, and Färber claims that its audi- 11 The TRC's function, as per the legislative act that brought it into existence, consisted of four principle duties: 1) "establishing a complete picture of . . . gross violations of human rights"; 2) "facil- itating the granting of amnesty"; 3) "recommending reparation measures"; 4) "compiling a report of [the above functions] . . . which contains recommendations of measures to prevent the future violations of human rights" (TRC website). Throughout its explanation of its own function, legisla- tive debate over this function, and public statements made about the TRC by its supporters, it was the formal bringing forth of hidden moments of the past that took precedence over the idea of amnesty and reparation. Indeed, in only a small handful of cases was amnesty granted, and these decisions were not based on the severity of the crime, but ostensibly on the degree to which the per- petrators made full disclosure of their actions. The record compiled by the TRC spans several thou- sand pages, and seven years elapsed from the first hearing in 1996 to the final emendations of the TRC documents.</page><page sequence="15">SOUTH AFRICAN TRUTH 8c TRAGEDY / 61 enee is actively involved in the staging of the play. The inclusion of testimony within a cathartic tragic structure - when combined with Xhosa notions of com- munity, the simultaneous shifting specificity and generalizability of space, and the tension between monumentalizing and reconciling - leaves Moloras audience at once unable to purge their emotions and aware that they are sharing in this dis- comfort with those around them. This creates the simultaneous need/desire for catharsis and reconciliation without allowing the audience to feel that this recon- ciliation has been accomplished. Ultimately, it is Moloras simultaneous insistence on the immediate possibility of reconciliation and the deferral of this reconciliation that is most characteristic of reconciliation aesthetics in South Africa in the years following the TRC. The struc- ture of reconciliation prohibits forgetting the past, and, in fact, relies on a repeated cycle of witnessing. This is particularly true in a society like that of the Xhosa, where the ancestors are immediately present as part of the community. Desmond Tutu memorably writes that "however painful the experience, the wounds of the past must not be allowed to fester. They must be opened. They must be cleansed. And balm must be poured on them so they can heal. This is not to be obsessed with the past. It is to take care that the past is properly dealt with for the sake of the future" (TRC report, Chapter 1). This medical vocabulary resonates with the Xhosa belief that severe moral or legal infractions are the result of some- thing broken within a person, not an inherent wickedness. This brokenness can be fixed with medicine, but, as Tutu points out, it must first be acknowledged. As those who witnessed Molora or the TRC hearings can attest, this acknowledge- ment is a painful process. Even those most critical of the TRC recognize that it provided both a goal or a philosophy and cathartic moments for individuals. At the same time, even the most optimistic reviewers of the TRC recognize that the fraught relationship between individual and nation, between justice and the com- munity, requires continual effort to translate these individual experiences into the national arena.12 The narrative structure of reconciliation generated by the TRC and the process of reconciliation are not coterminous. As Desmond Tutu writes, the TRC was "meant to promote national unity and reconciliation . . . not to achieve those worthwhile objectives" (165). With its interruption of the tragic telos and the narrative of reconciliation, Mol- ora serves as a graphic, visceral reminder that some events, either due to magni- tude or their very status as events, cannot be reduced to recognizable narrative forms. The irreducible nature of the events portrayed in Molora - beyond tragedy, beyond reconciliation - is experienced on an individual and a communal level as the unfulfilled desire to seek a satisfactory resolution. Rowan University 12 Aside from the writing of the TRC commissioners themselves, there have been innumerable editorials, reviews, international discussions, and analyses from many fields about the efficacy of the TRC. See, especially, Chapman and Van der Merwe for a survey of opinions, data, and analyses. While many of the nonacademic voices - particularly those from impoverished rural areas - are filtered through transcription, translation, and selective reporting, this text does attempt to be comprehensive, and thus, regardless of the specific conclusions drawn or biases uncovered, main- tains a multivocality important to understanding the array of responses to the TRC.</page><page sequence="16">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE / 62 Works Cited Balme, Christopher.
