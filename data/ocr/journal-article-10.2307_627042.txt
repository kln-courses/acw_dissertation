<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE CAUSES OF GREEK DECLINE' IN one of the most popular anthology passages in Latin, Servius Sulpicius, writing to console Cicero for his daughter's death, describes how, as he reached Greek waters, sailing from Asia, he began to look about him at the ruins of Greece. 'Behind me was Aegina, in front of me Megara, on the right the Piraeus, on the left Corinth, cities which had once been prosperous, but now lay shattered ruins before my sight.' Oppidum cadavera he goes on to call them- corpses of cities! The picture, it will probably be objected, is overdrawn; certainly the ruin of Greece was, by Cicero's time, already a rhetorical commonplace, to be echoed by Horace, Ovid and Seneca in turn.2 But it was based upon an essential truth. The Saronic Gulf, once the centre of the world, was now, for all that Greece meant, a dead lake lapping about the foundations of dead cities. In that tragic decay-which was not confined to mainland Greece- we are confronted with one of the most urgent problems of ancient history, and one with a special significance for our generation, who were already living in an age of economic, political and spiritual upheaval, even before the bombs began to turn our own cities into shattered ruins. This, then, is my reason for reopening a subject on which there is scope for such diverse opinion: adeo maxima quaeque ambigua sunt. If any further justification is required, then I will only add that the recent publication of Professor Michael Rostovtzeff's classic study of the social and economic life of the Hellenistic Age is at once an invitation and a challenge.3 With this work Rostovtzeff completes an historical survey reaching from Alexander to Constantine;4 and, throughout, he lays stress very emphatically upon the word 'history.' His four volumes are designed not simply as a compilation of factual material, but as an interpretation of the historical development of six hundred years of ancient civilisation. Both histories, the Hellenistic and the Roman, are pessimistic in outlook, for both recount a failure; in the one case that of Greek and Hellenistic civilisation, in the other the collapse of the ancient world itself. Yet there is a difference of tone. In 1926 the author had ended on a now famous query. ' Is it possible,' he asked, ' to extend a higher civilisation to the lower classes without debasing its standard and diluting its quality to the vanishing point? Is not every civilisation bound to decay as soon as it penetrates the mass?' These questions, with their echoes of Plato, go far beyond the scope of the particular problem of the decay of classical culture, and were undoubtedly prompted by the writer's own personal experience as an imigrd from Soviet Russia. And in the formulation of certain other problems-Why was the victorious advance of capitalism stopped ? Why was machinery not invented ? Why were the business systems not perfected ? Why were the primal forces of primitive economy not over- come ? (RE, 484)-and especially in his interpretation of the chaos of the third century A.D. as a proletarian revolution carried out through the army, his view of ancient history appears to have been influenced by his own vivid apprehension of certain contemporary events in Europe. The comparison between Bolshevik Russia and the ancient world in decay is constantly implicit in his narrative, and frequently he pauses to draw a direct analogy.5 Many of these questions are fundamental to the problem of the collapse of ancient civilisa- tion; yet, having raised them, Rostovtzeff left them unanswered. Meanwhile his links with Russia were broken, and in any case events there took a turn which falsified his earlier com- 1 This paper was read before the General Meeting of the Classical Association at St. Albans on Wednesday, April 12, 1944.

For in fact the Greek and the Roman failures are in essence one. No one can read through Rostovtzeff's work without being struck by the way in which the earlier forms of decay foreshadow the later, and how, mutatis mutandis, the end of Augustus's empire is in its general features an echo of the end of Alexander's. Both failures, in fact, sprang from something deep in the very character of classical civilisation. The problem of Greek decline may be approached from two sides. First, in the social- political sphere there is the failure of the Greeks to achieve the unity which alone might have enabled them to preserve their freedom from outside conquest. In this respect the conflicts between Alexander's successors are a repetition on a larger scale of the old wars of the city- states; there was the same fatal disunity, the same squandering of material and cultural capital, the same ultimate betrayal to the outside enemy. This failure was one of which many Greeks were themselves conscious. Persia, Macedon and Rome are three stages in a tragic descent, three notes which find a constant echo in the propaganda and ideology of the third and second centuries B.c.7 It is no coincidence that the last struggle of mainland Greece was constantly interpreted in terms of the fourth-century struggle against Macedon, that the Arcadian Polybius launched into a passionate defence of his pro-Macedonian countrymen whom Demosthenes had dubbed traitors, that Philip V of Mace- don sought to recall the deeds of Philip II and Alexander, claiming them as ancestors, that Flamininus, going back yet a century earlier, had himself hailed as the new Xerxes, come not to enslave, but to liberate. This sequence is no matter of chance; it is the measure of Greek concern for a superb triumph followed by failure and catastrophe. Secondly, there is the cultural failure of the Hellenistic age. At an early date the Greek intellect fiad gained unrivalled success in its clarity and breadth of thought. The observa- tional science of the Ionians (albeit still wedded to the remnants of pre-rational thinking), the splendid objectivity of Thucydides, the unity of theory and practice in the works of the Hippocratic school, had all pointed forward to further intellectual triumphs; while in the Attic tragedians the moral problems of man's relations with the forces inside himself and inside society had been cast into an artistic form which made its direct appeal to the whole population of Athens. Yet the dawn was false. At the highest moment of the Athenian achievement, in Plato himself, notwithstanding his many magnificent contributions to human thought, the gates were opened to the enemy. The Laws, Plato's last attempt to construct the just city, is concerned with the implanting of beliefs and attitudes convenient to authority through the medium of suggestion, and not with the stimulation of man's native curiosity to seek and enquire. A strict and ruthless censorship, the substitution of myths and emotional ceremonies for factual knowledge, the isolation of the citizen from contact with the outside world, the creation of types with standardised reactions, the invoking of the sanctions of a police-state against all kinds of nonconformity--this is Plato's final disastrous contribution to Greek political thought.8 Even so, it is as much a symptom as a cause. It represents Plato's reaction to the catas- trophe of Aegospotami and to his personal experience of democracy, as he saw it in action at Athens and Syracuse. And though the day was passing when the separate city-state could still be the vehicle of man's intellectual and political progress, he closed his eyes to history and sacri- ficed the substance of Greek achievement to preserve the husk. In this he was not alone. Aristotle too, for all his mastery in the sphere of scientific observational method, remained 6 Reviewing HW in Antiquity xv 1941 398. 7 I have developed this point in an article in Class.

Laws ii 656 C), and a general attitude of authoritarian paternalism.</page><page sequence="3">12 F. W. WALBANK politically identified with an obsolescent environment. His Politics pre-suppose the city-state throughout; and Dr. Ehrenberg 9 has recently emphasised the complete and astounding lack of contact between him and his great pupil, Alexander. In all the Hellenistic philosophies, likewise, though their field of contemplation had expanded beyond the walls of the city, there is nevertheless a common note of defeat, a drawing-in of the scope of human thought and endeavour. To the disintegration of society the Cynic reply was to ' deface the currency,' a sharp criticism of all ideals and all standards, the indulging of moral indignation, in short no constructive answer at all. The Stoics turned their thoughts inwards, and sought to proof the individual soul against the raging storms of Fortune; and the Epicureans, though drawing on the materialist speculations of Democritus, also laid their emphasis on the separate moral problem, and tried to live unnoticed in their Garden. No one, examining the evidence of Greek failure, cultural and social-political, can fail to perceive how closely the two aspects are interwoven. Yet neither is the cause of the other: both reflect something deeper and more fundamental, something which had begun to operate before the end of the fifth century. For the decline of the Greek world, though worked out to its bitter end under the Hellenistic kings and leagues, goes back to cultures already active within the body of the city-state. This more fundamental cause is rooted in the social relation of the classes. It reveals itself most clearly in the failure of the middle class inside the Greek cities to maintain and extend democracy. At Athens, of which we know most, the rise of the middle class followed the revolutionary changes of the sixth century, when the aristocracy finally capitulated before the successive blows of Solon, Peisistratus and Cleisthenes. The fruit of this victory was Athenian democracy and the defeat of the Persian armada. But success brought new ambitions and new opportunities; and very soon the Athenian fleet, the democratic instrument of Salamis, was being employed as the police force of the Athenian empire. Democracy had become imperialism, forms of society ultimately inconsistent. And though the Athenian defeat at Aegospotami meant the and of the empire, the vice of exclusiveness persisted. The democrats fought with courage and idealism to suppress the oligarchy of Plato's friend Critias, and the rest of the Thirty; but it was the restored democracy which rejected Thrasybulus' proposal to bestow citizenship on all who had fought for Athenian freedom at the Piraeus.s9 One could hardly find a more significant illustration of the limitations of Greek democracy, and of what Prof. Toynbee calls ' the poisonous ingredients with which it had been contaminated from the outset.' After 400 B.c., in one city after another, democracy gradually faded out. It had failed because it was inconsistent with the exclusiveness and parochialism of the middle- class citizen, who clung tightly to the privileges which his citizenship brought him, whether in money or prestige. Throughout the fifth century the Athenian middle class had concentrated its energies in agriculture, usury and the paid posts provided by the civil service and the empire. Citizenship was a door which was kept tightly barred against the stranger and the foreigner, who might settle and make money in banking, trade and manufacture, but could not aspire to the full fruits enjoyed by the citizen class. In this exclusiveness the middle class had the support of the workers, who saw in the various forms of state subsidy the one perquisite which divided the poor but free citizen from the slave. Thus, whether rich or poor, the citizen of fifth century Athens felt himself to be the member of a compact, brilliant, exclusive and highly conscious community, which was, in fact, living largely at the expense of the resident alien, the slave and the subject ally. Sooner or later, however, this exclusiveness was bound to break down. It was a struggle against the tide. And from the fourth century onwards there are clear signs that the division made by the possession of citizenship was growing less distinct. The wealthy on both sides of 1 V.

To Prof. Rostovtzeff we owe a fascinating description of its achievements during the Hellenistic Age.1o The bour- geoisie he defines as that section of the population which lived off the proceeds of capital invested in some branch of economic activity. It included landowners and tenant farmers; owners of industrial workshops; owners or tenants 'of shops, ships and warehouses; money- lenders; and slave-owners, who hired out their slaves for work in ships, mines and workshops, or who let them conduct business directly on their master's own behalf. It was this class that controlled the wealth and the culture of the Greek cities and the monarchies of the Hellenistic Age, having crystallised into a recognisable group in the course of the fourth century. Since city-state hegemonies no longer existed, it was easy now to treat on terms of friendly equality with the city that would formerly have seemed a potential subject or mistress. More- over, the new foundations in Asia were free from the old traditions of exclusiveness which had historical roots in the cities of Greece proper. Hence this form of particularism had to and did give way. But vertically the bourgeoisie remained as rigidly exclusive as ever their prede- cessors were. Indeed, certain new developments of the Hellenistic age tended to accentuate class differentiation. With the increase in the number of slaves throughout the Greek world as a result of the wars of Alexander's successors, society was drawn out towards greater extremes of wealth and poverty. Having annexed the older lands of the Nile and the Euphrates, the Greeks became acquainted with a more rigid, oriental, caste-system, which had all the authority of antiquity, and seemed more impervious to social change than the forms of society they had known at home. The old antinomy between the town-dweller and the peasant within the ancient agrarian empires of Asia,"1 was now inherited by the successor states of Alexander; and in Egypt, where a unique system of royal monopoly was adapted and perfected by the Ptolemies, a peasant population of legally free fellahin filled the role elsewhere assigned to slaves. Barring a few faint notes, which swelled loudest in Judaea,12 this subject class remained voiceless and unheard; the stream of history passed it by. Nevertheless the growing polarisation of society eventually made itself felt in a series of class struggles of a new type. Struggles to throw off an effete aristocracy or oligarchy the Greeks had known; the bitterness and resentment of the vanquished can still be read in the pages of Theognis. But now the Hellenistic Age saw fierce conflicts provoked by the basic classes of society, slave revolts like those of Sicily and Pergamum, the Carthaginian mercenary war, and such proletarian movements as that which gave its misguided support to the Spartan revolution of Cleomenes, and prompted the setting-up of the counter-revolutionary Symmachy of Antigonus Doson, an important function of which was to protect the Achaean bourgeoisie from the spread of Spartan 'communism' among the masses in their own cities. This increase of class-war coincided with a decline in the prosperity of the bourgeoisie themselves. ' The rapid growth of wealth in the hands of a few members of the class,' comments Rostovtzeff, ' did not compensate for its impoverishment as a whole' (HW, I204). This was especially true in Greece proper, where an acute problem of depopulation from the end of the third century onwards offers perhaps the clearest indication of general decay. Indeed, just as four centuries later the decline of Italy prefigures the decay and break-up of the Roman Empire, so now mainland Greece offers the first, warning sign of the decline of the Hellenistic World. 10 See HW II15 ff. With misgivings I have kept Rostovtzeff's terminology. It is important to bear in mind that the ' bourgeoisie' of the ancient world, as it existed from the time of Plato to the third century A.D., was in vital respects different from the 'bourgeoisie' which rose to power in Europe from the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries onwards. The sources of wealth and the methods of acquiring and investing it were both different, the industrial basis was never developed, and altogether the ancient class was much less cohesive and purposeful-a difference closely linked up with the use of slave labour power and the backward state of ancient technique. Nevertheless, an alternative expres- sion is hard to find; and provided that this radical difference is borne in mind, there are sufficient analogies to justify and even recommend the use of the same word for both periods. 11 This contrast existed, of course, in such states as Thessaly and Sparta, where a subject race tilled the earth; but the emphasis was on slave and free man, helot and Spartiate, rather than on the specific contrast of town and country. 12 On this topic see M. Braun, History and Romance in Greco-Oriental Literature, Oxford, 1938.</page><page sequence="5">14 F. W. WALBANK This failure of the Greek middle class to preserve and enlarge the democracy it had established, and the gradual accentuation of class-differences and class-conflicts, is an under- lying factor easily traceable beneath the general features of social-political and cultural decline. ' Greece and poverty,' wrote Herodotus, 'have always been foster-sisters'; and as a corollary to this Aristotle characterised poverty as the parent of revolution and crime.13 Continued exclusiveness in a world of poverty could only lead to an explosion and to the chronic stasis endemic in ancient Greece; its effects on the quality of social and cultural life had already been catalogued in the sombre pages of the third book of Thucydides. In a community based on the exploitation of slave and neighbour, where the distinction between the ' city-state of the sponge ' and the 'vast military empire of the shark' was to be measured solely by the lack or presence of power and opportunity, where the artistic achievement of the Athenian Acropolis was made possible only by a tyrannous imposition exacted from unwilling subjects, what hope was there of unity? And what meaning was there in freedom? The Persian and the Mace- donian could always find his allies in Greece itself; and later, in the Hellenistic period, the bourgeoisie, in fear of those classes from whose labours its wealth was drawn, would always make common cause with the kings under the slogan of Homonoia.14 In the long run they were prepared to surrender all. To save the Achaean bourgeoisie from Cleomenes, Aratus was ready to nullify his life's work, and readmit the Macedonians to the Acrocorinth; a gener- ation later his successors in the Achaean League obediently went over to Rome, still bent on safeguarding their own special interests. All over Greece the upper classes came to terms with the barbarian,15 and the Greek wars of the second century were all more or less wars of class against class-externa ac plerumque permixta; after the swift Roman victory of 146, Polybius informs us, there was a proverbial saying commonly heard on the lips of his defeated com- patriots: ' If we had not perished so quickly, we should never have been saved! ' 16 In the cultural life of Hellenic society the poison was also at work, and the havoc it wrought could not long be concealed. Here a single example must suffice. Discussing the collapse of the Roman Empire, Rostovtzeff points to the significance of the wave of superstitions and oriental cults which swept over the lower classes from the east, until ultimately the bourgeoisie and the cultured classes were also submerged and the light of Greek rationalism finally put out (RE, 479). A similar phenomenon accompanied the decline of the Hellenistic world in the third and second centuries; Professor G. Murray once summed it up as a ' failure of nerve.' What caused it ? Did it correspond to a spontaneous revulsion from rational thinking on the part of the masses? Or did the trustees of Greek culture deliberately 'Medise,' if we may borrow a metaphor from the parallel sphere of politics? There is no simple answer. Times of stress are always rich in superstition. But the question may also be answered in part, if we consider once more the tragic role of Plato, who, in the Laws, deliberately welcomes and incul- cates superstition as a mental pabulum not only for the lower classes, but even for the wardens of his ideal state. For the former the old Olympian cults, for the latter the new astral deities are to be an object of faith which may not be challenged.17 Whether Plato himself believed in either is extremely dubious; despite temperamental differences, his attitude here is funda- mentally, if less frankly, that of Polybius, who, two hundred years later, expressed his admiration for the use to which the Roman State put religion, keeping the lower classes in subjection by a judicious compound of terrors and pageantry.1s Yet to the impartial observer such a renun- 13 Herodotus, vii 102; Aristotle Politics ii 3. 7.

Cf. too the view of Critias (of the Thirty) who, in his Sisyphus (Diels, Fragment. d. Vorsokrat. (ed.

That motive was unquestionably the maintenance of privilege, the preservation of an oligarchic and paternal form of society with power and responsibility concentrated at the top. In the interest of such a social order and its perpetuation Plato is prepared to purge and censor most of the finest products of Greek genius. He had set out with the purest motives; he followed the light as he saw it. But what he did not see was that obscurantism cannot be confined to the lower orders; like a plague arising among city slums, it sweeps outwards and upwards until it has infected every rank of society. When that happens, society must either root it out or perish. Two issues the generations after Plato never faced: one was the unfettered application of the observational method to the problems of nature, the other the questioning of the basic organisation of society. It is not easy to over-estimate the importance of the teaching of the Academy in turning men's minds away from observation, and inspiring what Glanvill, many centuries later, described as 'thinking in the notional way,' deduction, that is to say, of the particular from the general, this having first been arrived at on a priori principles. Not even Aristotle could shake himself wholly free from this legacy. Correspondingly, in the social sphere, there was no serious challenge to slavery, or to such other concomitant abuses as the inferior position of women. As Rostovtzeff points out, the various utopias of Zeno, Hecataeus of Abdera, Euhemerus and Iambulus were ' mere products of theoretical speculation . . . and had no relation to or influence on practical politics' (HW, I132).19 The Stoics began by asserting the equality of slaves and free men; but they never drew the obvious conclusion that slavery should therefore be abolished, and later, in the Middle Stoa, they reverted to the Aristotelian view that slavery was a natural institution. In short, Hellenistic thought remained closely bound up with the patterns of behaviour of the Hellenistic bourgeoisie. The renuncia- tion which Plato was driven to make deliberately and consciously his successors made uncon- sciously and without an effort. It seems clear, then, that the increasing economic cleavage of Greek society into rich and poor, privileged and exploited, was a basic factor in both the social-political and the cultural decline which became apparent from the fifth and fourth centuries respectively. This cleavage necessarily raises the problems which were occupying Rostovtzeff's attention in 1926. Why, we must ask, did Greek middle-class democracy stop short? Why was the economic system never expanded to enable wealth, and with it culture, to spread downwards throughout society? Why was the accumulation of wealth in the Hellenistic world never used as a basis for capitalist and industrial expansion, instead of going (as it so often did) into unproductive channels, such as temples, festivals and public luxury? In fine, why did ancient society, having reached a certain point, stop short in its tracks, and then begin to decay instead of advancing towards a fuller democracy based on an increasing mastery over the forces of nature ? Stated in these terms, the problem identifies itself-as ultimately it must-with what is perhaps the question of ancient history, namely: What caused the decline and fall of the Roman Empire ? The more important contributions to the discussion of this topic have been reviewed in a recent paper by Prof. N. Baynes,20 and they need not detain us here. There is, however, one point I would make in connection with Rostovtzeff's approach to the problem in his Social and Economic History of the Roman Empire. Towards the end of this work the author deals with the theories of certain of his predecessors, dismissing some as untenable, and characterising others as only partial answers; and in the end his conclusion is non liquet, accompanied by a hint that all approaches have made a definite contribution to our understanding of the problem (RE, 486-7). In a sense this is true. But what he perhaps does not make clear is that many of these 19 For lambulus' influence on Aristonicus, which may form a partial exception, see HW 808. 20 N. H. Baynes, JRS xxxiii 1943 29-35: 'The Decline of the Roman Power in Western Europe. Some Modern Explanations.'</page><page sequence="7">16 F. W. WALBANK ' explanations' are, in fact, symptoms; and though symptoms are essential in a diagnosis, the cause of the disease is usually something quite independent of their sum total. In particular, Rostovtzeff's approach is handicapped by his unwillingness to admit the priority of any one field or category of human activity-social, political, economic or religious- over the rest. This view, which is implicit in all his work, is clearly stated in his introduction to the volumes on the Hellenistic Age. 'I have kept before me as a guiding principle,' he writes, ' in this as in the other historical works which I have written, the maxim that the com- plexity of life should never be forgotten and that no single feature should ever be regarded as basic or decisive' (HW, viii). This view (with its significant echoes from Tolstoy) postulates a series of parallel, partial causes for any historical event, sometimes linked together mechan- ically, but never organically; history becomes something amorphous, eclectic; and in view of the ' complexity of life ' the historian renounces the function which he has claimed from the days of Thucydides, that of explaining not only how, but also why things happen. Now admittedly one result of this principle has been that Prof. Rostovtzeff has admirably resisted the temptation which besets the ' economic historian' to see an economic cause for every incident, and so to over-simplify the process of history. Indeed, he will command general support in his rejection of Salvioli's theory that the ancient world failed because it never advanced beyond the stage of household economy, or the rival theory of Simkhovitch which puts the root of the trouble in soil-exhaustion. On the other hand, having made these points, he is inclined to assume that he has disposed of the mode of production as a basic factor in the situation. And this is far from being so. Rostovtzeff's own work makes it clear that classical civilisation was at all times based on a technique that was backward not merely relatively to that of modern times, but absolutely; that is to say, the exploitation of nature and the development of natural wealth was at so low a level that the leisure and culture of the few had to be balanced by the toil and want of the many, whether their status was that of poor workman or peasant, serf or slave. The difference between slave and free proletarian was important psychologically; but in Hellenistic times the 'hireling for life,' as Chrysippus called him, differed in terms of real welfare from the slave only in his 'personal freedom and more precarious situation as regards work and food' (HW, 1149) *21 Thus the intensive exploitation of man replaced, and indeed excluded its alternative -the intensive exploitation of nature. Once slavery has spread from the home to the mine and the workshop, it appears to rule out the development of an advanced industrial technique. For the kind of slaves employed in the big productive processes such as agriculture or mining are not capable of operating complicated machinery or advanced methods of natural exploita- tion, still less of improving them. Hence slavery militates against the development of mechanical power; and at the same time it brings few advantages in the concentration of industry, and therefore offers little opposition to the tendency of production to fly outwards to the periphery of the economic area. Furthermore, when slaves are there as an alternative, the producer has no incentive to economise labour; and the bargaining power of the poor, free, worker is automatically reduced where the two classes are in competition (as they frequently were in the Hellenistic Age), and consequently there arises what is today termed the problem of the ' poor white.' But equally important is the psychological effect of this social cleavage between those who possess the power and the wealth, and those who actually do the work. More than once Rostovtzeff mentions the 'conservative spirit of the Hellenistic period in regard to technical innovations in the field of industry' (HW, 1219). To speak of a 'conservative spirit' is, of course, to define, not to explain; and there can be little doubt that the search for an explanation brings one back immediately to the fact of a well-differentiated class system, which produced an atmosphere wholly unsympathetic to invention and teclhnical progress. Certainly it was the new spirit of the early Greek trading cities, where the power t1 Cf. also Aristotle Politics i 11. 3. I26ob: 'The meaner sort of mechanic has a special and separate slavery.'</page><page sequence="8">THE CAUSES OF GREEK DECLINE 17 of land was already broken, but wealth was not yet unduly concentrated, which transformed the scientific traditions of the east to create the amazing results of the Ionian Renaissance.22 Again, the general flux of the early Hellenistic Age, the new cities with their go-ahead ' middle- west ' outlook, the stimulus of new trade and new ideas, released a fresh burst of creative activity in the late fourth and early third centuries. But as the world settled down in its new shape, classes rigidified again, retardation once more set in: it forms a constant refrain in the work of Rostovtzeff, who indeed emphasises the slow rate of technical progress and the failure to achieve mass production. For this he offers a threefold reason: (I) the local production of manufactured goods, (2) the arrested development of large industrial centres, (3) the low buying capacity and restricted number of consumers (HW, 1230). It will be observed that none of these is a primary cause; but the last and most important raises the fundamental problem with which we are concerned here-the bourgeois monopoly of wealth, and so of purchasing power. If we attempt to analyse further the failure to make progress in technique, we shall find that it links up with the contempt felt by the Greek middle class for manual work of all kinds. That this attitude grew stronger during the Hellenistic Age seems indicated by an interesting fact to which Rostovtzeff draws attention, namely, the disappearance of representations of working craftsmen from the pottery of this period, and instead the depicting of mythological and abstract themes (HW, 1201). This pottery is, of course, produced by craftsmen; but the themes the craftsman introduces reflect the interests of his public. Hence it appears that the Hellenistic bourgeoisie, unlike their predecessors, found pictures of craftsmen working either vulgar or tedious. Moreover, there is plenty of other evidence for this widespread attitude. Hasebroek has assembled a number of instances from the fifth and fourth centuries; 23 and Rostovtzeff has himself stressed the significant fact that the Greek bourgeoisie never accepted the technites, or member of what we should today term the liberal professions (i.e., civil servants, professional soldiers, teachers, doctors, engineers, architects, sculptors, painters, artists and lawyers), as a social equal. Because these technitai earned their living, by practising a skill and for wages, they were regarded as being socially on the level of the artisan. Their incomes were low and they were frequently outside the citizen body, as metics or slaves; their absence from among the solid characters of the New Comedy supports the view that they were not considered respectable (HW, II17). This distinction, which clearly reflects the bisection of society into two classes with anti- thetical interests, had disastrous effects in every sphere of life. Prof. B. Farrington has described these effects, at a later stage, on the practice of medicine, perhaps the most realistic and pro- gressive of all the crafts ;24 and at an early date one result was the diversion of scientific thought away from practical observation and experiment, into notional and metaphysical channels,25 and the consequent check on technical progress. However, it would be misleading to suggest that there were no exceptions to this rule. In building and engineering the Hellenistic world, like the Roman Empire afterwards, made certain notable advances. Particularly inside the monarchies there was a considerable pro- gramme of building, including the construction of roads and aqueducts, and this in turn stimulated various allied crafts (HW, 1231-2). Even more, in the science of engineering, in its relation to warfare, there was constant technical innovation. Vitruvius' account (x. 16. 3ff.) of the rivalry during the siege of Rhodes between the two engineers Callias and Diognetus is an interesting example of the way in which ancient inventiveness could forge ahead where a pressing situation overrode any prejudice against linking up theory and tradition with experi- 22 V.

As a result, the architect and the engineer were exceptional, not only in the attitude with which they approached their tasks, but also in the prestige which their professions seem to have enjoyed (HW, 1234-5). Such figures as Ctesibius of Alexandria, Philo of Byzantium and Archimedes of Syracuse, theoretical writers and practical inventors alike, enjoyed a position in society well above that ordinarily accorded to the technites. Yet their exceptional status did not mean that such of their inventions as had no direct application to warfare-for instance, Ctesibius's pump or the many ingenious devices recorded in Hero of Alexandria-were rationally employed otherwise. Indeed, it is perhaps symbolic of the position of ancient applied science that Hero's inventions, far from being used for the benefit of mankind, were employed by the priests of Egypt to simulate miracles, and so, by facilitating a pious fraud on the faithful, to assist in the secular struggle of superstition against reason. Why were the architect and the engineer in a special category? Why in this case was it experience modified by scientific experiment, and in the other crafts experience alone that set its seal upon practice? Rostovtzeff points to the steady demand for the work of engineers and architects (HW, 1237). But one must go farther, and ask why that demand existed here and not elsewhere. The answer seems to be that the demand was created by the pressing needs of the Hellenistic monarchs to expand their realms and to defeat their rivals in warfare. The reason they sought expansion and military success, though knit up with such questions as prestige and personal power, lies fundamentally in the nature of ancient society, which equated expansion with greater revenues and a wider field of exploitation. The progress made in building and engineering is thus in part at least a by-product of a process which in the long run was inimical to the interests of society; the modern parallel is the stimulus given by warfare to the progress of the aeroplane, wireless telegraphy and atomic research. The other branches of technique were far from enjoying similar conditions. Here there was no growing demand because there was no large market for the products of industry; and there was no such market because the form of exploitation kept the masses at the level of poverty, and the price of labour cheap, whether free or slave. The modern world has solved a similar dilemma up to a point by exporting its surplus overseas; but this method was not open to a civilisation which was still geographically circumscribed, after absorbing as much territory as it could digest. Moreover, the structure of society outside the areas of Hellenism (and later of the Roman Empire) was not such as to provide markets for goods for mass consumption. Accordingly one is here driven to ask: Why then did antiquity never attempt a radical solution to this impasse ? In short, why was the bourgeoisie not superseded as the governing class in society by a revolt of the oppressed masses? From the Hellenistic Age onwards there were frequent proletarian and slave risings. The part played by social revolution and its threat in the wars of Sparta against the Achaean League has already been mentioned; and later on there are the revolts of Aristonicus at Pergamum, the Mithridatic War, the Sicilian slave revolts, slave risings in Attica, Macedonia and Delos, and the rising of Spartacus in Italy. But a significant feature of these movements is that 'in the few cases where social revolution was successful,' as Rostovtzeff observes,' this was the result of political conjunctures which prompted the leaders of the day to lend their support to the aspirations of the proletariat' (HW, I 128). Perhaps the most notable example of this is to be seen in the careers of the Roman populares and the use they made of the urban mass at Rome. This constant diversion of the revolutionary movement to serve the interests of someone outside it is only to be explained as a measure of weakness in the movement itself;, it is the mark of immaturity and inadequate internal organisa- tion and drive. Hence it never appeared likely that the proletariat would succeed not merely in overthrowing the middle classes, but also in setting up in the place of the existing state a wider social order, capable of conserving classical culture and extending it to a broader section of society. Indeed it is very questionable whether such a thing was economically possible, without a radical change in the level of production. Technique in the ancient world had never supported more than a minority culture; and though it can be argued, with justice, that this minority</page><page sequence="10">THE CAUSES OF GREEK DECLINE 19 culture had always been very wasteful, investing its resources in luxuries and non-productive forms of wealth, this is not to say that with the most careful planning and management the resources and technique actually available would have been sufficient to keep the whole community at a level bearing any relation to classical civilisation as we know it. In any case, if the purely economic problem is most safely left open, there are other factors which wholly rule out the possibility of such a revolution. Even the most effective of the slave-revolts, for instance the Sicilian risings of Eunus in 135 and Athenion in O04 26 (both of whom made some attempt to plan their resources with an eye on the future), did not reveal a sufficient unity of idea and purpose among the rebels to give any prospect of lasting success. For the general effect of slavery was to split the proletariat, not to strengthen it. There is every reason to think that a proletarian victory, if by some miracle it could have been achieved, would have meant nothing more than a change of masters. In fact, looking back from the vantage-point of the present, we can see that an organised proletariat capable of displacing the bourgeoisie, and both maintaining and expanding civilisation, first came into existence with the industrial revolution, which provided both the improved technique and increased wealth essential to mass civilisation, and also the concentration of the proletariat in factories and mines under conditions which enabled it to attain a community of purpose and a realisation of its own strength. These conditions never existed in the ancient world; and the Hellenistic bourgeoisie, conscious that it was a question of themselves or nothing, constantly set their faces aganst any movement designed to secure social readjustment. In this respect their propaganda was con- sistent with their practice. Plato had spoken of cities as divided as if between two armies watching each other; 27 and his contemporary, Aeneas Tacticus, awake to the dangers inherent in the use of mercenaries, urges the setting up of a citizen militia from among the 'reliable ' citizens, who have most to lose from social revolution.28 For the same reason the Hellenistic philosophers were united in ignoring the issues raised by the antagonism between rich and poor; realising that their own existence was bound up with the predominance of the wealthier class, they were, in Rostovtzeff's words, agreed in treating 'the problem of rrEvic and rho=iroS not as an important social and economic issue, but as a question of individual morals' (HW, 1129).29 It is unlikely that this interpretation was reached solely on philosophical grounds; more probably, as Rostovtzeff points out, in discussing the Stoics and Epicureans, ' the attitude of both schools towards wealth was in part dictated to them by their regard for their pupils and followers, who mostly belonged to the circle of intellectuals and the bourgeoisie' (HW, I 130). At the same time the city governments were mostly too timid or too poor to set up what Dr. Tarn has called' shock-absorbers in the social system,' 30 food doles and benefactions such as the Romans learnt to use with such effect. Thus the ancient world seems to have been caught in a dilemma. The economy both of the Hellenistic world and, later, of the Roman Empire, was based on a low level of technique and a form of exploitation which neither encouraged nor engendered technical progress. Moreover, the mental attitude inspired by this system was one which, among the bourgeoisie, turned men's interests away from the creation of wealth to its consumption, which accentuated exclusiveness and class hatred and fear, which on the one hand encouraged contempt for physical work and, ultimately, even for such intellectual work as rested upon it, and on the other hand set up an exaggerated respect for notional thinking-an attitude which led up to and beyond the intellectual treason of Plato; meanwhile, among the workers themselves it induced the slave mentality, the frame of mind which was satisfied perforce with little and fell back on a 26 See H.

Was there any available way out? In this question, as in others, speculation will always busy itself with ' ifs '; but the fact that history must face is that throughout the whole of classical civilisation no radical solution was devised for the problems outlined above. Of course the decline was not along a regular downward slope. The expansion of Alexander and his suc- cessors, and the consolidation effected by Augustus and Hadrian, each for a time put a brake upon the process of decay and even facilitated a partial recovery. But the real causes were never eradicated, and after a while the decline always set in again. Ultimately the supply of slaves dried up, and the western empire stabilised itself at a low level, its production in the hands of serfs and tied craftsmen, and its government a rigid bureaucracy. Yet all was not lost. As Prof. Baynes has recently reminded us, the eastern empire went on after the western half had foundered; and even in the west there was never a clear and complete break. Consequently, when the barbarian invasions were themselves events of the distant past, and new towns began to spring up in Europe, inhabited by neither serfs nor slaves, the techniques of the ancient world were there for men to build on. Unobtrusively the crafts- men grouped around manor or monastery had passed their knowledge down from father to son. And so once more, in an atmosphere free from the deadening effect of the ever more rigid class- system of late antiquity, men could go forward to the mastery of nature. With them they bore the full cultural legacy of the ancient world, adapted now to a task from which antiquity itself had necessarily drawn back, but which gave promise of easy accomplishment to the new and fruitful partnership between mind and hand.
