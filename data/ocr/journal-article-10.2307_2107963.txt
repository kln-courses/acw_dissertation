<plain_text><page sequence="1">Philosophy and Phenomenological Research Vol. L, No. z, December i989 Mortal Immortals: Lucretius on Death and the Voice of Nature MARTHA C. NUSSBAUM Brown University Mortals (are) immortal, immortals mortal, alive with respect to mortals' death, dead with respect to their life. - Heraclitus Divinity must live within herself: Passions of rain, or moods in falling snow; Grievings in loneliness, or unsubdued Elations when the forest blooms; gusty Emotions on wet roads on autumn nights; All pleasures and all pains, remembering The bough of summer and the winter branch. These are the measures destined for her soul. Wallace Stevens, "Sunday Morning" (II) I Epicurus writes: "The correct recognition that death is nothing to us makes the mortality of life enjoyable, not by adding on an infinite time, but by removing the longing for immortality" (LM I3z). But Nikidion might think incorrectly. For she might, as often happens, take a walk at dawn in the early spring. She might feel the knifelike beauty of the morning. Watch the light rise behind white blossoms, until they flash like brief stars. See leaves half unrolled, translucent, their sharp green still untouched by life; the sun striking sparkles on the moving sur- face of a stream. And she would listen, then, in the silence to the sweet and deadly music of time. Images summoned by the smell of new spring air might very well spin before her then, crowding and overlapping: images of faces loved and SYMPOSIUM ON DEATH 303</page><page sequence="2">mourned, of childhood and home, of play and hope and new desire. She would see that morning through the images then, until each tree looked not only like itself but like many things that are gone, and each of her steps was taken in company with the dead. The beauty of things would appear to her under the aspect of mourning, and become, for this reason, the more beautiful and lordly, the more human, the more terrible. She walks, in time, exile from a thousand times, transient on the way to no time at all. No animal could see so beautiful a morning. If Nikidion saw and felt all this, she might also wish to immobilize the present moment, to fix or devour it. Indeed, to hold and seize each thing and activity and beauty that she loves. For it occurs to her that no human being is ever really in possession of any joy at all, not even during a moment. A moment is itself the gathering place for a thousand other moments, not one of which can be inhabited again; it is also composed of projects that point beyond it to moments not known. Even as itself, each time is vanishing as one tries to grasp it. And any one of the projects that inhabit these moments can at any point be cut short, made vain and point- less, by the world, closing itself against her totally as it has closed already on so much that she has loved and will not do again. Death appears to her as the limiting constraint, the culmination of temporal losses. She sees that she will do the things she loves only a small and finite number of times more. Some she will not finish doing, even once. It is beauty itself, and the sense of joy, that make these thoughts so terrible to her; and the thought of the end flows terribly back upon the experience of beauty, making it keener and more astonishing. This condition does not seem to her acceptable. It is an illness that must, she thinks, have a cure. Perhaps some deeper grasp, some more pro- found reflection, would somehow or other protect her. Perhaps indeed there is some way to freeze all of life within life; to immobilize the most important things, and to rise above this condition of abject helplessness before time; to create, within mortal life, some analogue of a god's non-finite completeness. Above all, not to be at the mercy of the thought of death. It seems to her that philosophy ought to contain the answer to this problem. The first humans, as Lucretius describes them, found life sweet. They left the "sweet shores" of life with sadness and looked to that departure with fear (V.988-93). The love of life, Lucretius claims, is natural in all sentient creatures, and so all creatures go to death with reluctance. But these "first men" do not stop, as she has stopped, to reflect on their finitude. They do not wonder about their own fragility, or find agony in 304 MARTHA C. NUSSBAUM</page><page sequence="3">the mere knowledge of the "mortality of life." The Epicurean gods, on the other side, have (as the poem describes them) reflection without vulner- ability, thought about the universe without anxious fear and concern. In between are actual human beings, the only beings both vulnerable and reflective, who go through life in the grip of a fear of the natural condition of their own existence, straining to understand and also to improve their condition through the reflective capacity that is also the source of much of their agony. Lucretius' ambition is to show Nikidion a way in which reflection on death can remove fear and the sense of fragility, rather than increasing them: to take her, by therapeutic argument, from that spring morning to a position like that of the gods, untroubled by change, under- standing and accepting the ways of nature. Lucretius (or rather the poet-speaker in his poem) is no stranger to Nikidion's experience. In fact, this speaker refers to similar moments twice, in terms that suggest an acquaintance with their power. And yet the tone of both references is scathing and critical. Once he speaks of a man who gets drunk and then begins to weep, saying, "We poor little humans (homullis) have only a brief enjoyment here. Soon it has already been, and one cannot call it back" (111.9 I4-I 5). This man says what most of us seri- ously believe - yet he speaks in a silly, sloppy, drunken way, like some- one out of control of himself and his thought. Lucretius suggests that this thought of life's brevity is self-indulgent, sloppy, self-pitying thought; he urges the reader to view it with detachment and distaste. Later, again, the poet speaks of the way in which people feed, always, the thankless nature of the soul and fill it with good things, but never satisfy it - as the seasons of the year do, when they come round again, bringing their varied delights; nor are we ever filled up with the fruits of life. (1003-7) This is Nikidion's experience: and the poet lets the reader know that he has known it. And yet he stands aside from it now, detached, critical of the sense of life from which it sprung. We must try to discover how the poet- speaker can know these moments so well and yet mock them, how philos- ophy has taken him beyond them, to a place in which he claims to find both a divine life and a life according to nature. We shall focus here on this dual aim of Lucretius' Epicurean therapy: the aim to make the reader equal to the gods and, at the same time, to make him heed nature's voice. We shall see that these two aims are actu- ally in a profound tension with one another; and we shall make a proposal for the resolution of that tension. In the process, we shall need to investi- gate the suggestion planted in our description of Nikidion's experience: that much of the human value of human experience is inseparable from the awareness of vulnerability, transience, and mortality. SYMPOSIUM ON DEATH 305</page><page sequence="4">II How bad is the fear of death? It is the job of Epicurean argument to remove false beliefs and the desires that causally depend on them. But Epi- cureans do not go about removing any and every false belief the pupil might have. They focus on beliefs that impede happy life. We need natural philosophy only insofar as we are impeded; falsity will count as disease only if it can be shown to block eudaimonia. If Nikidion falsely believes that the ratio between a circle's circumference and its diameter is 3. I4 I 5 X, rather than 3.I4I59 . . . , this is not likely to become a major target of therapy. But the fear of death (and the associated longing for indefinite prolon- gation of life) are alleged by Epicureans to have a violently disturbing and impeding role. "In its empty way it causes pain," writes Epicurus in the Letter to Menoiceus (I z5). The many fear death as the "most terrifying of evils" (Iz5), and this belief about its supreme badness allegedly causes disturbances that are correspondingly great. Philosophical reasoning, the letter continues, has as its task to "drive out those beliefs from which the greatest upheaval seizes the soul." Lucretius speaks even more strongly: That fear of Acheron must be hurled out headlong, that fear which shakes human life at its very foundations, covering everything over with the blackness of death, and which does not leave any pleasure fluid and pure. (III.37-40) Lucretius' complex diagnosis of this fear's disturbing effects is a very important part of his argument against it. For he wishes to show that its consequences are so bad and so pervasive that we have reason to get rid of it even independently of its false basis: indeed, that it is a central cause in many of the worst human ills. To establish this, the Epicurean doctor cannot simply look at what most people say about their lives when asked for their ordinary intuitions. For most people, as Lucretius recognizes, do not admit to a fear of death and there is no reason to think these denials insincere, as far as they go. Those who do admit to the fear will not concede that it plays a very influential role in their lives. Nikidion may confront the fear of death on a certain sort of spring day; she will be unlikely to admit that it is with her in most of her actions. So if the Epicurean teacher wants to establish the bad- ness and causal power of the fear of death, giving Nikidion a diagnosis that will motivate her to seek his treatment, he must elaborate a concep- tion of fear (and the beliefs that ground it) that does not make fear simply identical with conscious fearful sensations and thoughts. He must present an argument that will convince the pupil to acknowledge the presence, and the causal role, of unconscious elements in fear, connecting them to perceived bad things in a compelling way. 3o6 MARTHA C. NUSSBAUM</page><page sequence="5">Lucretius undertakes this task in the complex diagnostic portion of his argument. We recall from chapter 4 that a central difficulty for the Epicu- rean doctor is, frequently, to convince the pupil of the existence and the gravity of her illness. It was to this end that the teacher would undertake a prolonged and systematic examination of the pupil's soul, urging her to bring all her symptoms, her thoughts, desires, and activities, into the open before him. In Lucretius' treatment of the fear of death, we have our clear- est example of the way in which such a diagnosis would proceed.' The diagnostic argument has four parts: (I) A description of a pattern of behavior that seems to lack ade- quate explanation. It will be argued that the most powerful explanation of these symptoms is fear of death. (z) A description of a subjective condition which, although not consciously felt as fear, lacks, as described, adequate explana- tion. Again, it will be argued that the fear of death is the best explanation of these inner symptoms. (3) A description of occasions of confession or acknowledgement: situations in which the patient, dropping her habitual defenses, will grant that fear is in fact what she feels. (4) In the background, a normative picture of the healthy uncon- strained person, a person whose life is not burdened by fear and who lacks, in consequence, the bad symptoms associated with it. Let us examine each of these parts of the argument in turn, seeing how they give rise to Lucretius' powerful explanatory hypothesis. First, the behavioral symptoms. These are many and diverse; and their evident badness plays a central role in getting Nikidion to identify the causing fear as disease. They can be divided, in turn, into four distinct cat- egories: First, the fear of death produces subservience to religious beliefs and religious authorities. This bad consequence of the fear of death is identified from the poem's very opening, with its grim account of the sacrifice of Iphigenia (I.8o ff.). It is seen to be very prevalent in human life. Its role is stressed again in Book III, as Lucretius tells us how unhappy peo- ple, wandering far from their homes, still cling desperately to religious I This material concerning the unconscious is present only in Lucretius; but there are rea- sons to suppose that the recognition of the unconscious beliefs and desires belongs to Epi- curus as well - cf. Nussbaum (i986b); and the presence of similar material in the Axio- chus (see below) confirms this. SYMPOSIUM ON DEATH 307</page><page sequence="6">custom: And wherever these wretched people go they sacrifice and slaughter black cattle and send them to the spirits of the world below, and in adverse fortune turn their minds even more sharply to religion. (111.5 1-4) Religious belief is bad, Lucretius persistently argues, because it is supersti- tious and irrational, built upon false and groundless beliefs about the gods and the soul. It is also bad because it makes people dependent upon priests, rather than on their own judgment. And priests stimulate human fears further, increasing dependence (I.ioz ff.) It is bad, above all because it causes people to harm one another, committing "criminal and impious deeds" (I.8z-3) - for example, Agamemnon's slaughter of his own child. Second, the fear of death interferes with the enjoyment of such plea- sures as mortal human life does offer. We have already seen that Epicurus believes we must banish this fear in order to make "the mortality of life enjoyable": and Lucretius has claimed that the fear interferes with life from its foundation on up, leaving no pleasure undisturbed. He shows us, too, people who never find satisfaction in any activity, since no activity succeeds in gratifying their thirst for immortal existence (1. I00 3 ff.); and people who move on from a hatred of the end of life to a hatred of life itself: And often, on account of the fear of death, such a hatred of life and of seeing the light seizes human beings that, in their state of agony, they commit suicide. (111.79-8i) We saw the germs of this agony in Nikidion. Lucretius' claim is that, unchecked, it poisons everything as life goes on. Closely connected to this is a kind of aimless and restless frenetic activ- ity that has no point at all, other than the avoidance of one's own self and one's own finite condition: If only, just as human beings seem to feel a weight in their souls that wears them out with its heaviness, they could also grasp the causes of this and know from what origin such a great mountain of ill stands on their chest, they would hardly lead their lives as we now often see them do, ignorant of what they really want, and always seeking a change of place in order to put down their burden. Here's a man who often goes outside from his house because he's tired of being home. Just as suddenly he turns back, since he feels no better outdoors. He rushed off in haste to his country house, bringing his slaves, as if the house were burning down and he had to bring help; he turns back again, as soon as he touches the threshold; or, heavy, he seeks forgetfulness in sleep; or, full of haste, he charges back to the city. Thus each person flees himself. And when, as he discovers, he cannot manage to escape himself, he hates and reproaches himself- all because he is sick and does not know the cause of his sick- ness. (1053-70) This symptom is closely connected to the preceding one, since self-avoid- ance, proving, as it always does, impossible, generates self-destructive 308 MARTHA C. NUSSBAUM</page><page sequence="7">rage. Notice, here, that Lucretius is claiming that the unconscious nature of the disease is a large part of its destructive power. Awareness is already progress towards cure. Finally, and very ambitiously, Lucretius links the fear of death with a large number of activities destructive either of self or of others, all of which allegedly give expression to a thirst for some sort of continued exis- tence: "These wounds of life," he writes, "are fed in no small part by the fear of death" (111.63-40). The greedy accumulation of wealth makes its possessor feel further from death, since poverty seems to be a slipping towards death (59-67). The same can be said for the "blind lust for honors and power" (6o) in which people pursue an immortality of reputation. These two passions, in their turn, cause many criminal acts, ruptures in families, enviousness of others, betrayals of friendship, betrayals of civic duty (111.59 ff.). This bad behavior is in many cases not, we have said, accompanied by a subjective awareness of fear. But the symptoms do have their subjective side. Lucretius here puts before us people who never experience unalloyed enjoyment; who feel driven and stung by an "unseen goad beneath their heart" (873); who feel a weight in their soul, a mountain of misfortune sit- ting on their chest. And, feeling this, they also feel that they must do what they can to throw it off - whether through crime, through an exhausting round of empty diversions, or through sleep and oblivion. So it is crucial to Lucretius' diagnosis that the subjective condition of the patient is, if not readily identifiable as fear, still painful and debilitating, and intelligibly seen as the cause of bad actions. By bringing together this collection of symptoms, outer and inner, and by showing persuasively how they might be understood to be caused by the fear of death - whereas, as described, they appear to lack any other adequate explanation - Lucretius has advanced a forceful theoretical hypothesis that might well convince the pupil just on account of its sim- plicity and its power. But this is not the full extent of his diagnostic argu- ment. And this is fortunate: for without any further evidence such an all- purpose explanation for human miseries might seem unconvincing. But there is further evidence; and it comes from a valuable source, the patient. For Lucretius claims that the same people who usually deny that they fear death, or that this fear plays a large role in their lives, can be brought to see this and acknowledge it, under certain circumstances. The correctness of the explanatory hypothesis is established by the fact that the patient her- self will vouch for its truth: It is more in times of danger that one can really look into a person and know who he is: for then, at last, the true voices are drawn forth from the depth of the breast. The mask is torn off; the fact remains. (111.55-8) SYMPOSIUM ON DEATH 309</page><page sequence="8">A similar argument can be found in the Pseudo-Platonic dialogue Axio- chus,2 which can be traced (in part) to Epicurean origins. Axiochus has spent most of his life denying that death is bad, even denying this with the aid of philosophical argument. But, he says, "now that I am right up against the fearful thing, my brave and clever arguments steal off and breathe their last" (365B-C). The Epicurean claim is that such moments of direct confrontation with the facts of our human situation are moments of truth. We can rely on the statements produced in such moments, when the life is laid bare to its own inspection by the force of an event (or imminent event) whose sharpness simply cuts through habits and rationalizations. And these statements are taken to be accurate, not only about that moment's condition, but about what has been the case all along in the per- son's soul. Epicurus' attack on the deluding power of habit and conven- tion is linked, plausibly enough, to a belief in the veracity of that which emerges when habit is suddenly broken down and the soul is left raw and unprotected, simply perceiving itself. In this he resembles Proust; and his argument has comparable psychological power.3 These three parts of the diagnosis - outer symptoms, inner symptoms, and moments of acknowledgement - are now drawn together by the explanatory hypothesis: it is our fear of leaving life and its good things that produces so much evil and distress. Despite the difficulties attaching to any such global explanation, I think we should view the Epicurean hypothesis with sympathy both because of its psychological plausibility and because of the complex argument through which he has commended it to us. This hypothesis is linked to a vague and as yet unspecified concep- tion of a human health that is not plagued by these ills, a condition that Nikidion can imagine as possible for herself, and in contrast to which she will view her present condition as diseased. It may well have been a central job of Epicurean confession to show her the pattern of her symptoms, together with the hypothetical explanation, and to provoke a confronta- tion of the sort that would allow the "true voices" to be heard. Such a con- frontation would naturally be accompanied by a portrayal of the good life that it is possible for a cured Epicurean to achieve. It is important to grasp the relationship of this diagnosis to the religious beliefs it criticizes. One might suppose that, for Epicureans, the fear of death is the creation of religious teaching, and that it does not exist in the natural pre-religious condition of human life. Frequently Lucretius' argu- ments are, in fact, portrayed as if their target was religion alone, and as if a ' On the Axiochus and its authorship, see Furley (i986), and the edition by Hershbell (i98i). 3 On these views of Proust, see Nussbaum (i983, i988). 3 IO MARTHA C. NUSSBAUM</page><page sequence="9">sufficient cure for the fear were a rejection of religion.4 The text (as we have already suggested) refutes this. Book III already suggests that the dependence on religion is a consequence of the fear of death, not fear's ori- gin. And Book V explicitly confirms this. In the course of criticizing the hypothesis that the gods created the world, Lucretius asserts that the love of continued life is universal in living things: "Whatever has been born must naturally desire to remain in life, as long as sweet enjoyment (blanda voluptas) holds on to it" (I77-8). His later account of the first humans confirms this: for before religion's origin they hate death, and die with reluctance: Nor, then, did mortals leave with more laments than they now do the sweet light of life. For then, each one of them, caught, used to provide living food to the beasts, devoured by their teeth. And, seeing his own guts buried in a living grave, a person would fill up the groves and mountains with lamenting. (988-93) Indeed, he later argues, it is men's perception of their own vulnerability before death, and their perception that the gods lack their own weakness and fear (mortis timor, i i 8o) that is one of the primary causes of the invention of worship and of religious subservience. Lucretius tells us that religion has made our relation to our death far worse than it was before, filling us with terror of the afterlife and causing us to become far weaker than we already were, as "a certain hidden force saps human affairs" (V.Iz33 -4). He tells us that the first humans, while they feared and lamented, did not engage in the ambitious schemes of mil- itary conquest and seafaring through which contemporary man tries to grasp immortality (V.949-ioo6). But the fact remains that the fear was there before, as a direct response to the natural love of life and to our human sense of life's beauty and value. Thus, in extinguishing fear Lucre- tius cannot claim simply to be returning human beings to some uncor- rupted pre-religious condition, or, as in the case of love, to be undoing deep religious/cultural constructs. He must acknowledge that he is attack- ing a deep and fundamental part of "natural" human life, a part closely related, as he himself stresses, to the structure of the human sense of value. This sense of value is empirical and not a priori, clearly: it is a response to human experience of the world. And yet it lies deeper than any particular culture, deeper even, apparently, than culture itself; deeper, then, than the errors that culture manufactures. This means, as well, that Lucretius' arguments will not be truly therapeutic if they deal only with those errors about death that have their origin in cultural or religious teaching - in a concern about the afterlife, or the fiction of posthumous survival. Such arguments would not even remove religion, since its underlying causes 4 See, for example, Shibles (I974). SYMPOSIUM ON DEATH 3 II</page><page sequence="10">would be left in place. His therapy must also deal with what Plutarch calls "the longing for being, the oldest and greatest of all forms of eros" (Non Posse I I04C). And in dealing with this longing they must must focus above all on our relation to the things we love and find delightful: for our fear is, above all, a fear of losing, as Axiochus says, "this light and the other good things" (365 B-C). Fear is a response to value. III Lucretius' poem contains three central arguments aimed at showing the reader that it is irrational to fear death. The first and most important is also found in Epicurus, and is the explanation of the famous Epicurean claim that "death is nothing to us." It goes as follows: I. An event can be good or bad for someone only if, at the time when the event is present, that person exists as a subject of at least possible experience, so that it is at least possible that the person experiences the event.5 Z. The time after a person dies is a time at which that person does not exist as a subject of possible experience. 3. Hence the condition of being dead is not bad for that person. 4. It is irrational to fear a future event unless that event, when it comes, will be bad for one.6 On experience and possible experience, see the sympathetic and lucid reconstruction of Epicurus' argument in Rosenbaum (i986). Epicurus sometimes seems to state premise i in terms of actual experiences (e.g., KD z, perhaps LM Iz4); but LM Iz5's famous for- mulation, "When death is there, we are not,-and when we are there, death is not" makes, it seems, the stronger claim that the subject is not there at all, as a subject of even possible aisthesis; and we could take LM I 24's "Death is the privation of aisthesis " to be making this stronger point as well. Lucretius' argument concentrates on establishing the stronger claim: it is not only actual perception that is extinguished by death, it is the very possibil- ity that this subject could ever, under any circumstances, exist again as a subject of experience numerically identical with the former subject (esp. 111.845-69). Epicurus' argument, to be plausible, requires a focus on this stronger claim: for if he is taken to insist that nothing can be good or bad for one who does not have actual experience of it, his claim will be open to many obvious and plausible counter-examples of the sort that Nagel brings forward (see below). See also Bollack (I975). 6 LM Iz5: "Whatever, being present, does not produce impediment or annoyance, is an object of (merely) empty pain when it is expected." It is perfectly clear that it is the state of being dead, not the process of dying, that is the focus of Epicurus' concern. On this see Rosenbaum (i986, i987); and all major interpreters agree. Epicurus does not seem to have thought that a painful process of dying was an appropriate object of fear either: and his remarkable deathbed letter, declaring that day the "happiest day of my life," despite the intense pain of strangury and dysentery, shows how he would argue this. He claims 312 MARTHA C. NUSSBAUM</page><page sequence="11">5. It is irrational to fear death. Much of the poem's attention is devoted to establishing premise z, by showing that the person, identified with a certain complex of body and soul, must end its career at death. But Lucretius is aware that there are many people who believe in the mortality of the person and who nonethe- less fear death. To these he commends his first premise. Many such peo- ple, he perceptively points out, are in the grip of an inconsistent mental picture of death. Although they actually believe that the person ends at death, they also imagine a surviving subject who is pained and grieved by damage to his corpse, and by the loss to himself of the good things in life - of children, home, various delights and activities (111.870-9Ii). The basis for the subject's grief is that he is dead; yet by imagining himself grieving he endows himself with life. It is Lucretius' suggestion that only such an illogical fiction, subconsciously held (inscius ipse, 878), makes the fear of these people at all plausible.7 Every reader, he believes, will endorse premise I; and once he is made to realize that he is not entitled to his absurd belief that death is a loss that can be experienced by the subject, he will naturally concede the truth of the Epicurean conclusion. Three supplementary arguments are worth introducing at this point. One, which we shall call the symmetry argument, is closely related to the first. It points out that the time before we were born is, as all will agree, a time that is of no concern to us: not in the sense that now, during our lives, we do not take an interest in the events of history, as we clearly do, but in the sense that then, we did not suffer either good or ill, even if good or bad things were then happening, since we were not even in existence. So too, the argument continues, if we take away the illicit fiction of the survivor, we will see that the time after our death is, equally, of no concern to us, in the sense that it is a time during which we can suffer neither good nor ill, 8 no matter what events are going on, since we will not even exist. We shall return to this argument when we discuss the first argument. that the happy memory of conversations with his friends is more than enough to offset the bodily pain (DL X.zz). 7 For the self-contradiction involved, consider esp. vivus . . . in morte (879-80), in vera morte . . . vivus (885-6), stansque iacentem (887). 8 This argument is suggested at 83z-4i, 85i-6i, 97z-77 and also Axiochus 365D-E, on which see Furley (i986) 78. As Furley correctly notes, the reference to our lack of concern about the Punic wars is not, as some have believed, a statement about our current feelings about either past or future events. The point is, rather, to insist that a subject must be on the scene at the time when an event takes place if that event is to be either good or bad for him (or her). (Furley (i986) 76-8, contrast Kenney (I97I) 193.) For a recent reconsider- ation of the symmetry argument, and a probing analysis of the relevant texts, see Mitsis (i988) and the comments of Striker (i988). Mitsis points out, correctly, that 97Z-77 is concerned with the rationality of our present attitudes to death in a way that earlier pas- SYMPOSIUM ON DEATH 3 I 3</page><page sequence="12">A third argument is placed by Lucretius in the mouth of Nature (93 Iff., esp. 93 8-9). It urges us to realize that life is like a banquet: it has a struc- ture, in time, that reaches a natural and appropriate termination; its value cannot be prolonged far beyond that, without spoiling the value that pre- ceded. Mortals should therefore not strive to prolong their lives indefinitely, since this will just spoil the pleasure of the life they have. This argument looks importantly different from the other two; and it is, in ways that we shall shortly examine. A fourth argument, also spoken by Nature, follows closely on the third (963-7I). We shall call it the population argument. Nature points out that if there are births but no deaths, the world will become unlivable. There is need for the old to die eventually, so that the young may live. This argument, like the banquet argument, seems different in strategy and con- clusion from the central argument; and we shall see, when we examine it later on, to what extent this is so. IV Epicurus' central argument has been, in recent years, the subject of intense philosophical debate. In fact, there is no aspect of Hellenistic ethics that has generated such wide philosophical interest, and produced work of such high philosophical quality.9 Major interpreters agree, on the whole, in finding the argument insufficient to establish its radical conclusion. On the whole they have focussed their attacks on premise i. But there is little agreement about what is wrong with this premise, or about why the fear of death is, after all, rational. For Thomas Nagel, the problem lies in premise i's focus on possible experience. He argues that a person is not simply a subject of experience, even possible experience: "Most good and ill fortune has as its subject a sages are not; and yet, this does not undermine Furley's account of the argument, since, as our analysis of the central argument shows, the conclusion about the non-existence of the subject is Epicurus' basis for the further conclusion that our present fears are irrational. Philosophical discussions focussing on the interpretation of Epicurus' views include: Fur- ley (i986), Long and Sedley (i986), Miller (1976), Mitsis (i988), Rosenbaum (i986, i987), Sorabji (i983) 176 ff., Striker (i988). More general philosophical articles includ- ing substantial discussions of Epicurus or Lucretius include Green (i98z), Luper-Foy (i987), Nagel (1970), Silverstein (i980), Sumner (1976), Williams (I973). For philo- sophical discussions related to this debate but not concerned directly with Epicurus, see Brueckner and Fischer (i986), Feinberg (I977), Murphy (I976), Partridge (i98i), Pitcher (i984), Rorty (i983), Yourgrau (i987). Most of the articles discussing Epicurus reject his conclusions in various ways; Rosenbaum offers an eloquent and acutely argued defense. 3 I4 MARTHA C.

A person may be betrayed and never know it; nonetheless, this betrayal is a loss to him. Moving to a case closer to Lucretius'," a person may lose all higher mental functioning in an accident: and this loss, which he cannot now even possibly grasp, is still a loss for him - and not only on account of pain that he now feels; for we can imagine a case in which the damaged person lives like a contented child. Indeed, Nagel, continues, it is evident that the "him" for whom the diminished state represents a loss is not the damaged individual who survives in a childlike condition, feeling no pain or frustration. The loss is loss for the intelligent adult who was and is no longer. So it appears that losses do not even have to be located within the temporal career of the subject for whom they are losses, but are to be assessed in terms of their relationship to that person's possibilities during his career. Death is bad because it deprives the agent who was of the fulfillment of all his possibilities. This is, obviously, a strong and interesting argument. Certainly it moves in the right direction, when it asks us to look at the person's whole history and the trajectory of that history through time, and to see death as a termination of something that was under way, projecting towards a future. But it leaves some difficulties remaining, as Nagel himself observes. First there is a problem with the notion of possibilities: it is left rather unclear how these are to be located, and how we go about deter- mining just what possibilities death has actually frustrated." Equally important, the somewhat static notion of "possibility" does not, Nagel recognizes, do enough to bring out a life's unidirectional temporal move- ment: for it may be insufficient to show what is wrong with the symmetry argument.'3 We might, argues Nagel (developing a suggestion made by Robert Nozick) imagine a case in which an unborn creature (in the exam- ple, a spore waiting to hatch) lived on with unactualized possibilities, and was prevented from fulfilling these by not being born; we would have to grant that this was extremely close to the death case, described in terms of possibility-frustration. And in both, something essential about our fear of death seems to be omitted.'4 At this point in the argument, Nagel is attacking only the focus on actual experience; but he later insists that possible experience is not the appropriate focus either. PP. 5-7. See the criticism by Furley (i986) 88. We become particularly uncomfortable when Nagel speaks of "indefinitely extensive possible goods," and denies that a person's own experience of his life contains any idea of a "natural limit" (io). '3 See p. 8 n. 3, where Nagel writes, "I suspect that something essential is omitted from the account of the badness of death by an analysis which treats it as a deprivation of possibili- ties." "4 Cf. n. 3 again: "I conclude that something about the future prospect of permanent noth- SYMPOSIUM ON DEATH 3 I 5</page><page sequence="14">Furthermore, Nagel does not make it clear exactly howr an event located completely outside a life's temporal span diminishes the life itself. The cases he actually analyzes are not by themselves sufficient to show this, since in each of them a subject persists, during the time of the bad event, who has at least a strong claim to be identical with the subject to whom the bad event is a misfortune. In the betrayal case, this subject is clearly the very same; and is a subject of possible, if not actual, experience in relation to that event. In the second case, it is hard not to feel that the continued existence of the damaged person, who is continuous with and very plausibly identical with the former adult, gives the argument that the adult has suffered a loss at least a part of its force. Where death is con- cerned, however, there is no subject at all on the scene, and no continuant. So it remains unclear exactly how the life that has ended is diminished by the event.'5 A different approach is suggested by Bernard Williams in his article "The Makropulos Case." He begins by assuming that the satisfaction of desire is good. But not all desires are conditional (as Epicurus may sup- pose) on being alive at the time relevant to satisfaction. For, Williams argues, there are some desires, which he calls "categorical desires," which propel an agent on into life the the first place, and explain his willingness to go on living. These desires cannot, then be contingent on continued life; and death frustrates the fulfillment of those desires.'6 This argument does more than Nagel's to take account of the temporal structure of a life, the way it projects beyond its present states towards the future, the way in which death cancels a fulfillment that is specifically future. So, although Williams does not discuss the symmetry argument, his argument is well equipped to handle it: the unborn have no desires for fulfillment, a fortiori no categorical desires; and so the badness of death is not to be found in their case. But in another way Williams's argument does less than Nagel's: for Williams's case against death, unlike Nagel's, is based upon a contingent fact about most people, namely, that they have desires of this sort. It does not show that to have such desires is an essential feature of human life - although Williams, recognizing that his argument is in this way less strong than Nagel's, suggests that one might persua- sively argue for that position.'7 Even more important, it does not show ingness is not captured by the analysis in terms of denied possibilities." 's A further problem in Nagel's argument as a critique of Lucretius is that he relies, for his criticism, on ordinary intuitions. Epicurus would no doubt agree that intuitions have the content that Nagel describes; but he would insist that we can show those intuitions to be corrupt, based on socially taught false beliefs. See Rosenbaum (i986), Silverstein (i980), Nussbaum (i986b). i6 Williams (I973) 85-7. 17 Williams (I973) 88: he describes his argument as "more Utilitarian" than Nagel's, and 3 i6 MARTHA C. NUSSBAUM</page><page sequence="15">that such desires are in any way good or rational; and so it does not really meet the Epicurean critique. Lucretius' answer would certainly be that one cannot defend the rationality of one desire by pointing to its intimate relation with another desire - unless one has already established that this desire itself is rational and worth keeping. If both are irrational, therapeu- tic argument could just take for itself the larger task of removing them both. This, in effect, is what Epicurean therapy attempts, as we shall see. Williams expresses sympathy, at this point, with Nagel's more objective argument, and suggests that he might be willing to move in that direction; but such suggestions remain undeveloped.'8 A further difficulty is created by the use of "categorical desires" to explain why death is bad. It is not clear why the badness of death should be explained by pointing to the frustration of this narrow group of human desires, and this group alone, when there is so much of human life - activities, projects, desires, hopes - for all of which death is the unwel- come end. Suppose that a desire is not, for the agent, such that all by itself it would suffice to propel him on to continued life. Does this show that the frustration of this desire by death is not a loss to the agent? A valuable recent discussion of Lucretius' argument by David Furley'9 has suggested a somewhat different and quite promising way of looking at the badness of death, in its relation to the life that death terminates. Death is bad for the person who is no longer, because it makes empty and vain the plans, hopes, and desires that this person actually had during life. Fur- ley uses the example of a person who plans for his future life in ignorance of the fact that he is soon to die. To the relatives and friends who know this, his hopes and projects for the future seem, right now, particularly vain, futile, and pathetic, since they are doomed to incompleteness. Furley then argues that removing the knowing relatives does not alter the case. Any death that frustrates hopes and plans is bad for the life it terminates, because it reflects retrospectively on that life, showing its hopes and projects to have been, at the very time the agent was forming them, empty and meaningless. Our interest in not dying is an interest in the meaning and integrity of our current projects. Our fear of death is a fear that, right now, our hopes and projects are vain and empty." says that "there are strong reasons to adopt his kind of consideration as well." Williams believes that his argument is stronger than Nagel's, in the sense that it will be likely to per- suade a Utilitarian person, whereas Nagel's may not. But for us, since we have insisted from the beginning of this book that desires and preferences may not be reliable guides to ethical value, the argument that is based on them alone is actually far weaker. 8 A particularly clear statement on this point is in Striker (i988); for related consider- ations, see Brueckner and Fischer (i986), Sumner (1976). 19 Furley (I986). 20 Furley (i986) 89-90. A similar line of thought is pursued by Murphy (I976), whose dis- SYMPOSIUM ON DEATH 3 I7</page><page sequence="16">This argument succeeds in refuting Lucretius' contention that our fear of death is in every case based on the irrational fiction of a surviving sub- ject who grieves for his loss. It shows how death reflects back upon actual life; and in so doing it gives us a vivid- way of making sense of Nagel's point that an event may be bad for a life even if that life does not survive at the time of the event. In its sensitive depiction of the structure of future-o- riented desires and projects it is, moreover, well suited-to counter the sym- metry argument: the unborn have no projects and hopes that will be made futile and empty by delayed birth." But there is something troublesome, still, in the weight that is placed on the agent's present desires, hopes, and plans. Most people do, of course, project themselves towards the future in the way that Furley describes. Most people do live in such a way as to leave themselves open to emptiness and frustration. But we may not -h-e convinced that this is the only way for a human being to live. Epicurus will suggest another way, as we shall see. And we all know people who plan and hope less than most, who have fewer hostages to the future. So Fur- ley's argument, like Williams's, needs supplementation. We need to be told whether the way of living that death makes vain is or is not a good and rational way of living. Like Williams's, the argument -do-es not-go far- enough because it stops with desires, without saying whether, or why, they are good. We can begin to extend Furley's argument by pointing out that, among the many available human activities, the activities and relationships that human beings usually value most have, in more or less every case, a tem- porally extended structure. All seem to involve planning for a future that may or may not come, forming hopes that may be dashed, moving through a temporal sequence of changes that may be cut arbitrarily short. A parent's love for a child, a child's for a parent, a teacher's for a student, a citizen's for a city: these involve interaction over time, and much planning and hoping. Even the love or friendship of two mature adults has a struc- ture that evolves and deepens over time; and it will centrally involve shar- ing future-directed projects. This orientation to the future seems to be inseparable from the value we attach to these relationships; we cannot cussion is, however, weakened by his explicit and undefended assumption that the cen- tral element in human rationality is self-interest (i9i). Pitcher (i984) gives a different account of the way in which death can cast a "backward shadow" on life. The related issue of whether one can have interests that extend beyond one's death and can, there- fore, be frustrated by occurrences after one's death is sensitively and acutely pursued in Feinberg (I977); see also the critical discussion of Feinberg's position in Partridge (i98i). On this see also Sorabji (i983), who argues that our asymmetrical preferences and our sense that life has a unidirectional movement are "deeply human" and not adequately criticized by the Epicurean argument. 3 I 8 MARTHA C. NUSSBAUM</page><page sequence="17">imagine them taking place in an instant without imagining them stripped of much of the human value they actually have. In fact, what can take place in an instant could hardly be called love at all. For love is not, or not only, a feeling that can be had in a moment; it is a pattern of concern and interaction, a way of living with someone. Similar points can be made about hope, grief, and several other emotions. Much the same, too, can be said of individual forms of virtuous activ- ity. To act justly or courageously one must undertake complex projects that develop over time; so too for intellectual and creative work; so too for athletic achievement. And in these cases, again, the temporally extended character of the pursuits is an important element in their value. Even such a simple human experience as Nikidion's spring walk has the beauty and value it has for her because of the way that the experience itself extends over time, and involves her in projects for future times. Her hope might only be to have that experience again next year, or to have the experience of summer after the experience of spring. The fact remains that her delight in the seasons' cyclical changes involves an awareness that this is not an isolated event in her life, but a part of a natural pattern in which she, too, plays her evolving and changing role. So death, when it comes, does not only frustrate projects and desires that just happen to be there. It intrudes upon the value and beauty of temporally evolving activities and relations. And the fear of death is not only the fear that present projects are right now empty, it is the fear that present value and wonder is right now diminished. This argument will be sufficient to make the fear of death rational for anyone who still has valuable activities underway - who still loves, works, chooses, enjoys beauty. Death will be most terrible when it is, in conventional human terms, premature; for then the value of many prepa- ratory activities - activities involving training oneself so as to be able to act in some valued way in the future - will be completely lost, in that they will never lead on to the fruition that gives them their entire point. To devote a large part of one's life to merely preparatory activities is charac- teristic of youth. But the elderly, too, have valuable lives; and their activi- Stephen Rosenbaum has suggested to me in correspondence that perhaps Epicurus can reply by saying that all we need, in order for our present projects not to be vain, is that they are based upon reasonable beliefs about the future. I note that Epicurus did not avail himself of this reply; and I think he was right not to do so. Beyond the enormous difficulty of saying what a reasonable belief is in this world of accident, the reply does not seem ade- quate to the difficulty. A young person who dies in an accident was planning for the future in accordance with beliefs as reasonable as any; and yet it is in this sort of case that we feel most keenly the emptiness and fruitlessness of the dead person's preparatory activities. On doing valuable things, see Striker (i988). SYMPOSIUM ON DEATH 3 I9</page><page sequence="18">ties, too, are interrupted by death. It would perhaps be irrational for an elderly person to devote the whole of his or her time to activities whose value is entirely preparatory and instrumental; but even the activities that are constitutive of good life can, as we have said, be interrupted. And even if there should be a person for whom death arrives just as all current projects are, for the moment, complete and at a standstill - if such a thing ever happens for a person who loves living - still, the bare project to form new projects is itself interrupted; and it seems that this project is itself a valuable one in a human life, and a deep part of what Lucretius will call, critically, "the ungrateful nature of the soul," always seeking new beauty, never replete with what it has already realized. This argument captures quite a lot of what we mean when we say that death is a loss for the person who dies. But, in its focus upon the interrup- tion of projects and activities, it may seem incomplete. For even when a project or pursuit is for the time complete, still, we feel that it is frequently a loss in value to the person that he or she had a life that stopped short at that moment of completion, not permitting her to pursue different future projects, or to undertake that one again. At this point, however, we should consider that there are actually two different sorts of interruption in human life: or rather, that interruption can occur at two different lev- els. We have focussed so far on cases in which the interruption is internal to a single pursuit or project. But there are, in human life, many projects that involve the plan to do a certain activity repeatedly, over the course of a complete life. A good marriage, for example - as Lucretius himself depicts it in Book IV3- has this shape: it is not a single isolated act, but a pattern of daily acting and interacting, extended over time, in which the temporal extension, including the formation of patterns and habits, is a major source of its value and depth. Thus even if death does not catch the spouse poised in the midst of some specific act or concrete plan that is cut short by the death, there is a larger and deeper sort of interruption here: the interruption of the project of being married, and leading the way of life characteristic of marriage; with its habits, its vague and concrete plans, hopes, wishes. At the deepest level, there is, when death arrives, the inter- ruption of every one of these patterns of life - of work, of love, of citizen- ship, of play and enjoyment: the interruption, then, of a project that lies, however vaguely and implicitly, behind them all: the project of living a complete human life. This project need be nothing so formal as a life plan; it may consist only of vaguer hopes, expectations, an implicit sense of human life's expected unfolding and duration. Most deaths interrupt this complex activity, and are bad for that reason, even if for no other. 4 23 See Nussbaum (i989) and chapter 5. 320 MARTHA C. NUSSBAUM</page><page sequence="19">This argument, furthermore, is already made by Lucretius himself, in Nature's banquet argument. This argument tells us that life, like a meal, has, or is, a temporally unfolding structure. Nature uses it to counter the wish for indefinite prolongation of life; and this use we shall examine later. But now we can see that it also supports the judgment that death can come too soon, and, in effect, almost always does. For it almost always cuts short, before the point of repletion and satiety, the temporally extended process of living a human life that seems to be admitted, within the argument, to be a good thing. If one dies prematurely -- for example, before reaching the main course - this will be the worst sort of death; for it will make fruitless those "courses" in the meal whose primary function was to prepare appetite and palate for the main course. (One would have eaten differently had one known the main course was not going to arrive.) But the argument suggests, as well, that just so long as eating is a good and a pleasure for the eater, just so long death will be, in another way, prema- ture, and bad for the subject because of its interruption of a process of liv- ing in the usual human temporal way, a process that is, like a banquet, good. When we now turn to Epicurean criticisms of our own argument about temporal extension, we should not forget that our argument is itself, apparently, Epicurean, and placed in the mouth of Nature herself. 24 Silverstein. (i980) suggests, in his very interesting argument, that we should regard our lives in a four-dimensional framework, treating time as we now treat space, and conclud- ing that temporally distant events can make a difference to the goodness of the subject's whole life just as spatially distant ones can, insofar as they affect its shape seen as a whole. He concludes: "In short, it is the 'four-dimensional' ability to understand life in dura- tional terms, to view one's life as a temporal whole and to make evaluative comparisons between it and alternative possible life-.wholes, which ultimately accounts for the fact that statements of the form, 'A's death is an evil for A' are commonly regarded as not merely intelligible, but true" (424). Silverstein's argument is further discussed in Your- grau (i987). The argument given here, based, as it is, on the activity of "living a life," interpreted to include some sort of planning, hoping, and wishing for the future, might seem to have the consequence that deaths of extremely young children are not bad for the subject - though of course they may still be bad in some other way, or bad for the subject for some other reason. This consequence is, in fact, frequently accepted in the medical ethics litera- ture, which distinguishes the interruption of the life of a person from other deaths, at both the beginning and the end of life. See the excellent survey of these arguments in Brock (forthcoming), and the discussion of the demented elderly in Brock (i988). I am not, however, happy with this consequence where infants are concerned, since I think that the presence of basic human capabilities, of a functional organization such that with adequate support human planning and acting of many kinds would in time take place, already makes death an interruption of a life that is projecting towards a future; the case of the elderly who have lost these capabilities is not symmetrical. On capabilities and the future, see Nussbaum (i988b). SYMPOSIUM ON DEATH 3ZI</page><page sequence="20">V Epicurus has a ready answer to our argument. It is that the values to which we point are false values. Moving from desire to value does not really help, since reflective evaluation is at least as likely to be corrupt. We do not need to hold on to these fear-producing values; and if we do they block our enjoyment of mortal happiness, precisely by convincing us that death is a loss. The wise and complete Epicurean will identify herself com- pletely with godlike pleasures, pleasures that do not in this way derive their completeness from a temporally extended structure, that do not link her in that way to a world of transient things and to her own transience. For Epicurus does not endorse the sort of hedonism that approves of all satisfactions, and counts as supremely good the enjoyment of whatever it is that people happen actually to enjoy. He presents a critique of ordinary values and ordinary enjoyings of those values, together with an account of a true pleasure that consists in active healthy life of the organism, freed from all impediment or disturbance. True pleasure, as Epicurus describes it, is, first of all, not additive: hav- ing more, or having a longer episode of it, does not make it better or more valuable; nor does the sheer number of episodes of it add to its worth. Lucretius' Nature tells the reader that there is nothing new that she can devise that will increase the worth of his life (944-5). Many sayings of Epi- curus insist on this: when once ataraxia and aponia are attained, the agent is at the top of life, and nothing - not even prolongation or repetion of the same - can add to the sum of her pleasures. Cicero summarizes the matter well:25 Epicurus denies that length of time adds anything to living well. Nor, in his view, is less plea- sure felt in a brief span of time than if it were -everlasting . . . He denies that in a life of infinite duration pleasure becomes greater than in finite and bounded time. . . He denies that time brings increment to the highest good. (Fin. 11.87-88) This is a promising critical point, so far as it goes. It does indeed seem plausible that the value of pursuits is not like the value of commodities, and is not heaped up, in such a way that more is always better. But this, first of all, does not show that it is not better to be able to choose a valued activity again (to go on having the capability to choose such activities when one wants), nor that the life in which that option exists is not superior to a life cut short in such a way that it does not. The woman who wants another child need not be making the error of supposing that more children is always better, and that the value of her children is numerically commensurable and additive. She may just be thinking that to occupy 25 See also Furley (I986) 8i. 322 MARTHA C. NUSSBAUM</page><page sequence="21">oneself by raising children is a very valuable thing to do, and that the value of the activity gives her a good reason for performing it again. The scholar who wants to write another book after the last can, similarly, be moti- vated by her belief in the value of the activity that she performs; she need not be thinking that books are like coin. If this is so, then it seems that death, or any other accident that deprives the individual of the capability of choosing a valuable action, does remove something, in itself valuable, that would have generated valuable activity - whether or not the acci- dent takes place after the activity has been once performed. Moreover, even if we should dialectically grant to Epicurus that more is never better, this would not suffice to give him his radical conclusion that death is never a loss in value to the one who dies. For here, returning to the interruption argument, we can remind him that even a single valued activ- ity may have itself a temporally extended structure; and that death can interrupt that structure, diminishing value. It can in this way remain tragic that death cuts short love, child-rearing, working, planning, in mid- course, since a certain trajectory in time is essential to their fullest flourishing. Perfect Epicurean pleasures, however, do not have a temporally extended or limited structure. They are, like Aristotle's energeiai, com- plete in a moment, complete once we do or act at all.z6 Healthy undis- turbed life, Epicurus insists, is not a process on the way to some further goal beyond itself, vulnerable to interruption before it might reach that goal. If it is there it is there, and nothing beyond that, but that itself, is the end. By urging us to revise our scheme of values and to attach ourselves to pleasures which have this self-sufficient structure, Epicurus claims to put us beyond the accidents of life, and beyond the vulnerability to those acci- dents that the usual mortal scheme if value entails. So it is no good objec- tion to his theory, he claims, that it does not fit with many of our current thoughts about value. For Epicurus will give us new values, within which death will indeed be non-fearful, in precisely the way that he says. Within 26 See Furley, 8i, and Diano (I974), Mitsis (i988). Furley gives a good account of the ten- sions in Epicureanism on this point, marshalling evidence that Epicurus allows a certain sort of concern for the future to affect the agent's present state. In particular, a necessary condition of complete Epicurean happiness seems to be the secure expectation of future freedom from pain (e.g. VS 33, Plutarch Non Posse Io89D). On Aristotelian energeiai, compared by Furley and Diano to Epicurean complete pleasures, see also Nussbaum ( I986) ch. i i, where I argue that in Aristotle's view energeiai can be impeded, though not cut off in mid-course, by accidents beyond our control. For example, myopia can cause a person to see less well every time she sees, even though, the the Aristotelian sense, seeing is complete in an instant and does not require a temporal sequence. Later in this discus- sion I shall give reasons for seeing some of the activities Aristotle called energeiai - for example intellectual work - as involving a temporal sequence of stages. SYMPOSIUM ON DEATH 3Z3</page><page sequence="22">this new scheme, furthermore, the symmetry argument will hold, as it does not for mortals who think badly. True pleasures do not project for- ward in time; so the termination of death is exactly symmetrical to the threshold of birth. This reply, however, points to a deep tension within Epicurean thought, a tension that surfaces in many parts of his moral argument, but causes special difficulty for the arguments about death. This is the tension between the perspective of nature and the perspective of the god. On the one hand, Epicurus repeatedly urges us to live as mortal beings within the limits and the structure of nature, listening to nature's voice and relying on perception, a natural animal faculty, as our criterion of truth. He describes the goal of his entire enterprise as one of "making the mortality of life enjoyable." And Lucretius follows him, urging the reader to reject the teachings of convention and to adhere, instead, to a form of life that is truly human and natural. In this case, we are to leave aside our culturally taught longings for immortality and to listen to Nature's voice. But Nature's voice in Book III, while it rejects the search for outright death- lessness (a point to which we shall return), and rejects, too, excessive greed for life among the elderly, still suggests that life and its value, like the banquet described, does have a temporally extended structure, a sequence of interrelated parts building over time and appropriately terminating at one time rather than another. The banquet image is introduced by Nature in order to show that it can be too late to die; but it implies, just as surely, as we have seen, that it can be too soon - while delightful and valuable projects are still under way, before repletion has made feeding a burden. It suggests, furthermore, that the value of any part of a life derives in part from its place in the whole sequence, just as the value of dessert derives from the way in which it complements and follows the main course. A pre- mature termination will then affect, retrospectively, the value of the parts that have been lived, just as an appetizer that is never followed by any- thing becomes, by that fact, less valuable as what it is. All this accords well with our argument; but badly with Epicurus' emphasis on godlike plea- sures. And this is no isolated passage in Lucretius' poem. For we recall that the love of continued life and enjoying are, for the poet, natural desires in all that have life; in the human case they take the form of judg- ments about beauty and "sweetness" that are the basis for a set of "natural" and trans-societal human values. They can hardly be criticized as empty constructs of this or that society. Here again, the voice of Nature seems to agree with our argument in endorsing the longing for living, inso- far as it is a longing for good. 32.4 MARTHA C. NUSSBAUM</page><page sequence="23">But on the other side, as we have begun to see, there is an equally deep strand in Lucretius' Epicureanism that urges us to leave our mere mortal- ity behind us, and to live like gods. The Letter to Menoiceus concluded with the promise of a godlike existence: "You will live like a god among men. For a human being who lives in deathless goods is in no way similar to a mortal animal" (I 35). And if we recall Epicurus' letter to Colotes about Colotes' act of proskunesis," we see how deep in the daily practice of Epicureanism was the promise to raise the pupil above her finitude and mortality, creating divinity within the mortal life. This appeal to divinity as an image of the good life is also a pervasive feature of Lucretius' poem; and Lucretius does not permit us to doubt that the pursuit of this goal requires us to transgress boundaries or limits set up in nature herself. The extra-human goal is present from the poem's open- ing, in which mortals, victims of disturbance (3z) are immediately con- trasted with the Epicurean gods, who live without grief, without change, without need, without gratitude or anger (1.44-9 = 11.646-5i). If there should remain any doubt that this portrait of the god is a goal held up to those of us who seek to cure ourselves through philosophy, this doubt is removed in the ensuing description of Epicurus' achievement. Epicurus is the foe of conventional religion; but he is also, in the encomium, the foe of nature and nature's limits. His mind's excellence is stirred up so that he, first in history, desired passionately to burst through the narrow confines of the gates of nature. Therefore the keen force of his mind conquered, and he advanced far beyond the blazing walls of the universe and traversed the immense whole with his mind and soul, whence, a conqueror, he brought back to us the account of what can arise and what cannot, and by what rational principle the power of each thing is bounded and confined by a limit. Therefore religion is abased and trampled underfoot, and he makes us, with his victory, equal to the heavens. (70-79) In this description of philosophical heroism, the endorsement of appro- priate natural limits is juxtaposed to the praise of a bold transgression of limit. The true Epicurean learns nature's boundaries; at the same time, she is enabled, by Epicurus' victory, to move beyond them. Thus, too, the proem to Book II promises the diligent reader a life that is in no respect significantly different from the lives of Epicurean gods: a life detached from human care, looking down (despicere, 8) upon the world of mortal things without worry or tension. Here the imagery of bound- aries takes one more turn: philosophy is said to build round the pupil a boundary that sets her off from other mere humans, until she inhabits "the lofty serene temples of the wise, well fortified by doctrine" (7-8). In Book V we learn, similarly, that our ability to resemble the gods who 27 See Nussbaum (i986b). SYMPOSIUM ON DEATH 3 25</page><page sequence="24">"look on all with a mind at peace" (V.IzO3) will depend on bounding ourselves off from the temporally extended desires of mortals, which rest upon a perception of incompleteness and a need for change. For we are told that those who are completely self-sufficient have no desire for any change at all (V. i 68-7z); so in their world there will probably be no sense of temporal extension at all, and surely no sense of temporal development with respect to value. And at this book's opening, Lucretius emphatically insists on the transgressive character of Epicurean longing. "He was a god, a god, distinguished Memmius" (8), the poet exclaims, by his epithet opening to the reader the possibility of a similar elevation, even as he has opened, before, the same hope for himself, asserting that nobody "born from a mortal body" could worthily praise Epicurus' achievement (6). This achievement was, to "take life out of such great waves and shadows, and to set it up in such tranquillity and such clear light" (i-i Z). And at the opening of Book III itself, just before giving us the arguments that are supposed to remove the desire for godlike immortality and to rec- oncile us to nature's limits, Lucretius makes a similar claim. Epicurus' words are "most worthy of eternal life" (I3), "born from a divine mind" (I 5). They make the "walls of the world stand aside, until we, godlike our- selves, can see the void, the peaceful homes of the gods" (I 6-zz). Even the poet's emotions, as he pursues his task, are a strange mixture of the mortal and the immortal: At these things I am seized by a kind of divine pleasure and horror, seeing that thus nature, by your force, lies so open to view, uncovered on every side. (27-30) In these famous lines'5 Lucretius lets us see very clearly that Epicurean reflection is an assault on the secrets of nature, a laying bare of what had been covered, an insertion of the human into the realm of the gods. But the claim is not simply the claim that science is in itself transgressive, that the ambition to know the whole is a kind of ambitious human violation of the mystery of the whole. That point might have been made by many thinkers who would not urge the human to become divine through detachment from human things. What Lucretius is saying in these passages is that the grasp of the whole takes the knower permanently and decisively beyond the mortal condition, into the value system, therefore the security, of the god. Knowing limits delivers an unlimited life, through the particular sort of shift in values that is commended, and effected, in Epicurean teaching. Epicurean science is transgressive not only because it gives a bounded being knowledge of the whole, but, above all, because the content of Epi- 28 On which see Schrijvers (I970). 32.6 MARTHA C. NUSSBAUM</page><page sequence="25">curean scientific knowledge teaches her to see and care in such a way that she really is no longer bounded. VI This shift over to a godlike life and a godlike self requires enormous revi- sion in human patterns of desire and of value. We are asked not to alter reactions that we have and regard neutrally, but to- alter evaluative judg- ments that we endorse on reflection as giving us a correct account of what constitutes mortal good life. We were told that this shift is commanded by nature, that it is a shift away from a religious view of life towards a life lived within the limits of a finite being. But on deeper inspection it appears that the goal of the shift is, in fact, quite different: to rise above mortality altogether, and to make ourselves into gods. But isn't this the religious view of life once again, in a slightly different form, furnished with a new conception of the divine and a new Hercules (cf. V.zz ff.), but still feeding the same old longing for transcendence? We begin to suspect that the reflection that leads to acceptance of nature's limits and to life in accor- dance with those limits, is not the reflection that Epicurean therapy actu- ally offers us; that instead of taking on this most difficult task, the task of making us not hate who and where we are, Epicurus has taken on the much easier task of shifting the ground of our religious other-worldly longing, until it finds a home in this-worldly detachment. So we wish to know, at this point, what Lucretius can say to Nikidion to defend his radi- cal assault on beliefs of hers that are both deep and, by his own admission, a natural part of the human response to the conditions of life. At this point, however, Lucretius can justly charge us with neglect of some of his arguments. If we believe that there is a contradiction between the advice of nature and the aspiration to divinity, this is, he might well object, because we have not attended sufficiently to the whole of nature's speech, or to the complex critique of the structure of mortal values that follows it. These parts of Book III have been unjustly omitted in most philosophical accounts of Lucretius' argument, perhaps because of the vivid dramatic force of their poetic expression. Even Furley says that the portions omitted by his analysis are "more rhetorical, poetic, or satirical than philosophical" - assuming distinctions that our analysis of Epicu- rean therapy has given us much reason to question. The passage between lines 93 I and IO5 z, beginning with nature's speech and ending with the reader's critical speech to himself, contains two powerful arguments that are intended to dislodge the reader from comfortable acceptance of human temporal values and to commend, in the name of Nature herself, the godlike values that Epicureanism recommends. The first argument attacks mortal values as self-defeating and therefore peculiarly unnatural. SYMPOSIUM ON DEATH 3z7</page><page sequence="26">The second asks the reader to view his life, and death, from the point of view of the natural universe taken as a whole. First, then, Nature's voice, and Lucretius' subsequent commentary, urge us to see that there is much in the structure of our current value sys- tem that is actually contrary to nature in the sense of being internally per- verse or self-defeating. Four different errors about value are identified and attacked. First is the mistake we have already discussed: the mistake of treating life's valuable things like commodities of which more is always better. This attitude is condemned by Nature, as we have seen, on the grounds that it betrays inattention to the structure of the good things that nature actually offers. But she suggests, further, that it actually undercuts our attempt to realize value in our lives, since the repeated accumulation of enjoyments leads to satiety and non-enjoyment. "There is nothing fur- ther that I can devise or invent to please you," she says to the accumulator. "Everything is always the same" (944-5) implying that the search for more enjoyment will lead inevitably to boredom, undercutting itself. Next, Lucretius identifies several further forms of corrupt evaluation and activity, associating each one with one of the proverbial torments of the underworld, and claiming that they distort life on earth, making earthly life a hell. There is in real life no Tityos who lives in a perpetual state of being devoured by vultures: but there is the erotic lover, whose very project entails anxieties that devour him and tear him apart (983-93). As Lucretius shows in Book IV,`9 the lover's very pursuit of love's impos- sible goal gives rise to anxieties that undercut love and impede the lover's projects, including the projects of love themselves. Again, in real life there is no Sisyphus pushing his boulder vainly up a hill whose top he will never reach. But there is, says Lucretius, the vain pursuit of political power, which guarantees by its own internal structure that the power-seeker's desires will never attain their end (995-iooz). The power-seeker, as Lucretius sees it, dooms himself to an endless futile struggle and ensures, by his choice of that way of life, that he will never get the goal that he seeks within it. Here again, Lucretius' point seems to be not only that the goal the stable possession of power - is one that can never actually be achieved (nec datur umquam, 998), but that the desires and pursuits gen- erated within that way of life are such as, themselves, to produce an unsta- ble situation that contributes to the frustration of the power seeker's aims. Finally, there are Nikidion's pleasures: Then, to feed, always, the thankless nature of the soul and to fill it with good things, but never satisfy it - as the seasons of the year do, when they come round again, bringing their varied delights, nor are we ever filled up with the fruits of life - this, I think, is just the same 29 See Nussbaum (ig8gb). 3 28 MARTHA C. NUSSBAUM</page><page sequence="27">as those young girls they tell about, who pour water into a sieve that could by no stratagem ever be filled up. (1003-10) Here the activity chosen by the maidens - pouring water into a sieve guarantees the frustration of their goal, which is to hold and carry some water. Just so, it is claimed, the usual mortal pursuit of earthly beauty and value guarantees the frustration of our mortal aim - which, if we read the parallel strictly, seems to be to hold on to some beauty and value. These are significant arguments, since they raise against the mortal val- ues we defend the charge of internal self-negation. Our most cherished activities pursue ends that are rendered unachievable by the nature of the activity itself. Such arguments might well convince Nikidion that mortal values are in a significant sense unnatural; for she is likely to believe that nature is not in this way self-frustrating. She may be induced to see her cherished pursuits as not just difficult or risky, but also warped or per- verted in their very structure; and she may then believe that the godlike life of Epicurean detachment is the one in which true natural human value is to be found. If successful, these arguments bridge the gap between the two parts of Lucretius' argument. But how telling are they, as objections to the structure of all human temporal delights? The error of addition, with its self-undermining effort, is a real error made, certainly, by some people. But we have argued that a human life can avoid that error while still remaining committed to temporally extended values. And we have been given no good reason by the addition argument to believe that the activities of these people are vain and self-defeating. Much the same can be said for the critique of Tityos activities. For, as Book IV clearly shows, one can avoid the peculiar self-negating kind of love attacked by Lucretius, while still loving another human being in a way that evolves over time and makes the lovers vulnerable to loss.30 Not all human love is self-negating, nor does Lucretius think that it is. His own account of love in marriage stressed temporal development as essential to the value of the relationship; and yet showed, too, how that love avoids the self-negation of eros. The lover who seeks fusion does pursue an aim both impossible and self-defeating (in the sense that the pursuit of the aim makes him less united with and more at odds with the object, prone to anxieties that undercut his project). But the lover who seeks mutual plea- sure and affection, conversation, and also reproduction seems not only not to undercut, but actually to augment his own activity by his choice of ends. For conversation and pleasure, in a Lucretian marriage, get better as one pursues them more and longer, since one then responds more aptly and with deeper habits to one's partner's character, tastes, and desires. 30 Ibid. SYMPOSIUM ON DEATH 3 29</page><page sequence="28">Again, a certain type of power-seeking may indeed be Sisyphean, damning itself to frustration by its very choice of the goal to be pursued. Plato's account of the self-undercutting life of the tyrant (Republic IX), in which the striving for absolute control leads to ever new insecurities and vulnerabilities, gives us a persuasive image of what Lucretius has in mind. But there are other political activities that, while depending for their com- pletion on temporal extension, seem to lack a Sisyphean structure: the effort to make just laws, to advance the well-being of one's city, to improve the well-being of its citizens. These goals are neither impossible nor negatively related to the activities that pursue them. And we can enu- merate many other valued pursuits whose aims are attainable, and whose activities really do promote (or even help to constitute) that aim: the activ- ities of friendship, of child raising, of many kinds of work and social and virtuous activity The Danaids are a more persuasive image for many mortal pursuits: for we may grant to Lucretius that many of the activities that we value most, and in which we take most delight, do have an internal structure of need and repletion, absence and presence. They are like pouring water into a sieve in the sense that the value is moving and changing even as it arrives, and depends for its worth on this temporal sequence that begins in, and returns to, emptiness. But the fact that an antecedent lack gives point and vividness to a pursuit does not mean that the pursuit itself has a merely need-relative value; nor does it imply that this activity is somehow absurd, and that a life without both need and activity would be somehow better and more respectable. The fact that eating has point and value against the background of hunger, sexual expression against the background of sex- ual need, does not imply that eating and sex cannot become worthy ends in themselves within a limited humanlife. We value activities not just as scratches that appease itches, but as forms of human expressive activity, connected with other valued ends, both social and personal. Again, the fact that the beauty of spring is related to the contrast between spring and winter, and indeed to our sense of finitude and mortality itself, does not imply that spring is not really beautiful. A changeless being could not, per- haps, see or respond to that beauty. But this does not mean that it is not beauty, all the same. The Danaids are absurd and self-defeating, because what they are trying to do is to hold some water; and the activity by which they attempt this project - pouring water into a sieve - is one that guar- antees the frustration of this aim. We object that this is not what the mor- tal being usually attempts. The person who eats does not aim at eliminat- ing all hunger forever; and her desire is really satisfied, though hunger returns as certainly again. The person who seeks sexual pleasure does not 3 3 0 MARTHA C. NUSSBAUM</page><page sequence="29">usually attempt to hold on to the condition of satisfaction forever, freed from all desire; indeed, he or she would prefer that the desire should renew itself again. She is satisfied, and satisfied in part on account of the fact that the condition of satisfaction is not permanent. Nikidion, again, does see beauty and love the beauty that she sees, even though this beauty is changing and moving off even while she sees it. Or rather, in part because it is so moving - change is a part of its beauty. All of Lucretius' tormented people are tormented because they are trying to immobilize something, to hold on to something absolutely and forever. This project not only is doomed to failure, it also generates frustrations that impede its own pursuit. But suppose one were to try not to hold and keep, but simply to live: what would Lucretius say then? What has happened shows us, again, the tension between the two parts of Lucretius' project. From the point of view of nature, it would appear that the argument has made a deep criticism of the activities and values of some people - namely, the ones who are in the grip of the idea of immor- tality. The solution to their hellish predicament would be, it seems, to live in and according to nature - that is, to value life's goods without trying to immobilize them, noticing how their transience contributes to the activi- ties we value when we pursue them. But that is not the conclusion Lucre- tius draws, here or elsewhere. Instead, he seems to draw a more sweeping conclusion, rejecting these mortal and transient pursuits altogether in favor of the godlike pleasures of Epicurean wisdom. From the point of view of the god, all of these characteristic mortal pursuits look futile and vain. From the point of view of a being whose pleasures are unchanging, and valuable precisely on that account, the transactions of mortals with changing nature look like attempts to have stable and unchanging plea- sures - attempts always doomed to frustration by the nature of the cho- sen pursuits. Lucretius' argument here reminds us of some very similar arguments by Plato in the Gorgias and the Republic. (Indeed, the image of the Danaids and their sieve is probably drawn from the Gorgias discus- sion.)3' Like Lucretius here, Plato seems to assume that an activity that is merely a "replenishment" of an occurrent need, and is dependent, there- fore, on a temporal sequence of need and repletion, could not have true intrinsic value. Like Lucretius again, he implicitly contrasts these replen- ishment activities (unfairly depicted, again, as vain searches for stable and permanent satiety) with the self-sufficient and stable pleasures of godlike contemplation, an activity that is dependent neither on change nor on need for its completion. Both philosophers, examining mortal pleasures from the point of view of a god's interest in stability, suggest that the need- 3' See Nussbaum (i986) ch. 5. SYMPOSIUM ON DIATH 33I</page><page sequence="30">relative pursuit has a merely specious value, appearing good to a being whose pain has in some manner duped him into cherishing his futile attempts to assuage it. Contemplative activity, by contrast, stands outside of temporal movement altogether, and is the better for being in that way unconditioned. Behind our Lucretian argument, as behind Plato's, there seems to lurk a hidden premise: that a pursuit has true value, and attains a truly worth- while goal, only if it can be detached altogether from change and vulner- ability, and grasped as true value by a being who has no commerce with change and vulnerability. In other words, mortal nature can count as nat- ural and valuable, rather than hellish, only insofar as mortal pursuits can be seen as valuable from the god's eye point of view on nature, the point of view of a being who is not in nature and has no experience of its structure of changes. On this test, of course, most characteristic mortal activities fail and contemplation passes. A deep hatred of nature and of temporality betrays itself in Lucretius' words about the seasons: for what is being attacked is, after all, nature itself, the way change goes on and the way in which that change evokes love and hunger from the mortal soul.3" Lucre- tius understands the way in which value is generated for us in and by time and change, the way human judgments of beauty and value inhabit this time, both loving its changes and, at the same time, regretting the deaths they entail. But all of this Lucretius hates. It would be good only if it fixed and held something. Indeed, to the rational being looking at it, it looks like a futile attempt to fix and hold. But isn't this judgment actually a repu- diation of the mortality of life? And isn't that hatred of change and mor- tality exactly the disease that therapeutic argument was supposed to cure? Lucretius has one more argument in this section of the poem, however. And we must grasp it before we can finally evaluate his therapy and pro- pose a modified therapy of our own. The argument, spoken, once again, by Nature's voice, asks us to look at our personal situation from a wider viewpoint, the viewpoint of the lives and interests of all living things, both present and future. When we look at the natural world with love and con- cern for it as a whole, and consider our own life or death in this perspec- tive, as one life within that whole, two things happen. First of all, our own personal anxieties look small. We think, why should we spend our lives immersed in, preoccupied by, the thought of our own death, when there is so much in the universe to consider? Others have died; birth and death are both universal and necessary; ours is no special case. The windows of our thought open out. The narrow obsession with our own case seems 32 Cf. also 111.936-7, where the same image of pouring liquid into a vessel full of holes is used by Nature herself. 3 3 Z MARTHA C. NUSSBAUM</page><page sequence="31">absurdly petty and mean. To use Lucretian images, the shadows that bound our vision to our own narrow surroundings now lift, and the whole of our mind's vision is flooded with the clear light of the universe. Con- templating and caring for the whole, we are ashamed to be wrapped up in ourselves; and the shameful obsession is itself dissipated by the engrossing interest of the reflection in whose light it is revealed as shameful. As George Santayana summarizes this part of the poems "One who lives the life of the universe cannot be much concerned for his own."33 Second, when we look at our death in the light of the whole, we under- stand that it is necessary for the continued health and life of the whole. There is need of matter, so that future generations may grow. They too, having lived out their lives, will follow you. Generations before this perished just like you, and will perish again. Thus one thing will never stop arising from another. Life is nobody's private property, but is everyone's to use. (967-71) In short, says nature: this life to which you so stubbornly cling is not only not a very large part of the whole, it is actually required back from you, if the whole is to live, and live well. If people never died, that would bring all nature to a halt: no room for new birth, no resources for the newly born. Clinging to life (beyond some reasonable limit) is selfishness and callous- ness towards other natural beings. The assumption behind the argument is that the world's resources are not indefinitely expandable. Even if the world could support some increase in population, it could not support an indefinite increase. New people will be born naturally, in the normal course of events. And if there are no deaths we will have, sooner or later, a situation in which some of the existing ones, or all, will lack resources. Indeed, Lucretius seems to imagine that the burden of scarcity will fall most heavily on the new: for the people already around, who already command resources, will cling to them tenaciously. Life will be like a university faculty with no retirements, in which the old, tenaciously clinging to their tenured posts, will prevent the entry of an entire generation of young people. What Lucretius says to those aging professors is: it is selfish and callous to cling to your position at such a cost. Move out and make room for someone else. This does not mean that the current retirement age is just, or that some other much longer term of service might not be made compatible with the entry of the young, if resources were better marshalled and arranged. It just says that the prolongation cannot be indefinite, without squeezing out the new, and that you yourself, seeing that, should modify your attitude to your own departure accordingly. 3 Santayana (1910) 56. SYMPOSIUM ON DEATH 3 3 3</page><page sequence="32">This argument is strong. Unlike the arguments about self-negating desires, it does not spring from a hatred of life and change. Instead, it asks from us a deeper and more consistent love of life and change, a love that is willing to confront one's own small place in the whole. It does not ask us not to think untimely death a tragedy; or even to stop fearing our death, as a loss, at any time. It reminds us, however, that this loss is someone else's good, that what you wish most to avoid is necessary and good for unborn others, that nature's structure contains an always tragic tension between the desires of the part and the requirements of the whole. And this thought, while it does not remove either the fear of death or its appropri- ateness, does diminish the sense of injustice that frequently accompanies the thought of death. It sternly tells Nikidion not to make herself a special case, not to think herself the center of the universe, or to ask for favors that would diminish it. And this injunction, followed, does transform the experience of fear. Nikidion might make two objections to this argument. The first would be to ask why she herself should not be an exception. Universities can still do well if they have a handful of really permanent positions. So too in the case of life: one person's immortality, or even many people's, would not suffice to do harm. Here nature will remind her that in adopting the per- spective of nature, a perspective that she herself has agreed to as partly constitutive of rationality, she has agreed to consider herself as one among others; and this seems hard to reconcile with the applicatipnrhe-re, of spe- cial principles to her own case. Furthermore, nature will point out that it is not the case that nobody suffers as the result of her choice. Even if the young do not suffer, Nikidion will be wronging other members of her own generation, who will have to move on, and perhaps even move on more quickly, as a result of her permanent tenure, in order to support her con- tinued life. Like Euripides' Admetus, she has allowed someone else to die in exchange for her life: and this act of self-promotion and cowardice (whether or not it actually shortens the life span of the one who dies for her) will color the rest of her life. But she may, if she is resourceful, attempt a more general reply. For it may seem that the non-death of the elderly is a problem only if the birth rate is more or less constant, or increasing. Why, on the other hand, couldn't we get the same balance by lowering the birth rate drastically, so that a substantial portion of our population remains frozen in years of adulthood, never moving off, but the new people are so few in number that no one ever lacks resources? Contemporary society does this to some extent already, seeking a birth rate that will be appropriate to available resources, given the lengthened life span. 334 MARTHA C. NUSSBAUM</page><page sequence="33">The objection is not easy to rebut; for if to Lucretius it would have seemed fanciful, it seems to us eminently real and practical. To some extent, we must concede that the objector is right: given the claim that the already living have to continued life, it seems morally correct (though not uncontroversial) to prolong those lives as long as we can, devoting our resources to that first of all, and to limit birth accordingly. But the pro- posed alternative of an almost total freezing of the population raises new moral problems that the objector does not consider. We shall later speak about the problems it raises for the frozen person herself and the value of her life. For now, we shall focus on the problems it raises for the commu- nity. A university faculty that is frozen at the top - as many in fact are today - lacking any positions for young entering people, lacks a crucial element-of the value of such an institution. It lacks the value, for both par- ties, of the interaction between young and old, the education of young people by the experience and wisdom of the old, the stimulus for the old of the young people's fresh ideas and approaches. So too, a world without young people would lack much that we currently value in our own world: new birth, the growth and rearing of children, the special types of love that bind the generations, the freshness of young energy and thought, the stimulus of generational interaction towards creative projects of many kinds. The person who chooses the frozen world has opted out of much of life's actual beauty. And we can add one thing further: he or she is a parasite on the very sys- tem she seeks to subvert. For in growing up to the point of frozenness that she now proposes, she has profited from the old system, from the love and care of parents, the concern of teachers. In opting for a world that no longer contains these structures, she seems to be opting for a world in which she could never have come to-be exactly as she is. Since a person who values herself and her life so highly as to seek to freeze it values, as well, on pain of inconsistency, the conditions that made it what it is, and since there is no reason to suppose that a life of similar structure and value could have come about in any other way, she is, in urging the rejection of the intergenerational way of life, very likely to be inconsistent with her- self. So the argument appears to survive Nikidion's objections, and to do so with its force broadened and clarified, rather than diminished. But notice that, like the banquet argument, it does so not by uprooting mortal tem- poral values but by affirming them, and showing their importance. VII We have a complex result. On the one hand, we have an impressive argu- ment that does, to some extent and in some ways, therapeutically treat SYMPOSIUM ON DEATH 3 3 5</page><page sequence="34">personal fear by appealing to wider cares. This argument allows us to pre- serve, as rational, our belief that death is a loss of value to the person who dies. But it balances this belief against other concerns. On the other hand, we have a further therapeutic argument assailing the belief; but this argu- ment seems to be far less powerful, inspired by rage against mortal life itself, and deeply in tension with the description of mortal value offered in Nature's voice. No argument in this poem has so far persuaded us that the fear of death is irrational, or that the values to which this fear is a response are not genuinely good. At this point another argument comes forward - an argument that Lucretius himself is prevented from making because of his own commit- ment to godlike detachment, though it is suggested in Nature's banquet argument and in some of Lucretius' examples of the bad attitude to earthly value. It is an old argument - at least as old as myths and stories about mortals who become immortal, and the immortals who fall in love with mortals. It consists in pursuing seriously the thought that the struc- ture of human experience, and therefore of the empirical human sense of value, is inseparable from the finite temporal structure within which human life is actually lived. Our finitude, and in particular our mortality, which is a particularly central case of our finitude, and which conditions all our other awareness of limit, is a constitutive factor in all valuable things' having for us the value that in fact they have. In these constraints we live, and see whatever we see, cherish whatever we cherish, as beings moving in the way we actually move, from birth through time to a neces- sary death. The activities we love and cherish would not, as such, be avail- able to a godlike unlimited being. We have already argued that friendship, love, justice, and the various forms of morally virtuous action get their point and their value within the structure of human time, as relations and activities that extend over finite time. We earlier used this observation to explain why the abrupt termination of these activities and relations by death is appropriately seen as tragic for the person who has been pursuing them. But we can now turn- this consideration around and suggest that the removal of all limit, of all constraint of finitude in general, mortality in particular, would not so much enable these values to survive eternally as bring about the death of all value as we know it. This is so far a general claim. It needs to be further explored. It is a claim about our empirical concept of value: so the investigation that pursues it will have to be empirical, bringing forward parts of human experience and using them (rather than some alleged a priori principles) to establish that our concept of value is in fact as we say it is. But it will also need to be deep and probing, going beneath first thoughts and automatic everyday 3 3 6 MARTHA C. NUSSBAUM</page><page sequence="35">responses, to elicit our deepest judgments about what matters. We need for this purpose complex fictions, works of literature that give us stories of immortals and of mortals, imagining in detail what can and cannot go on in those respective lives and convincing us, by this means, of the relation- ship between mortality and human value. Here we will do something sim- pler and more preliminary, telling a schematic philosopher's story, but with reference to some literary data that are pertinent for our purposes. Bernard Williams pursued a related plan in "The Makropulos Case."34 Considering in detail the life of Janacek's heroine, who had lived for 300 years, frozen always at the age of 4z, he argued that this woman's eventual boredom and frozenness, her loss of desire and her eventual suicide, were inevitable results of the attempt to prolong human desire so far beyond its natural limits. This interesting and convincing case leaves a number of questions unanswered. For example, how far did the result depend on the fact that she was alone in her predicament? That she was brought up to form the desires characteristic of a mortal? And does her case give us any reason not to try to cultivate, in ourselves and in oth- ers, desires that would sustain an immortal existence? In keeping with our emphasis on value and on good reasons, we will select a slightly different case and will try to confront these worries. The claim to be established is that, for many, if not for all, of the ele- ments of human life that we consider most valuable, the value they have cannot be fully explained without mentioning the circumstances of finite and mortal existence. They would not exist as they are, or have the value they have, in a life not structured by mortality. There are many different sorts of cases that we could imagine to investigate the hypothesis. We need to ask whether death alone has been eliminated, or also aging and vulner- ability to injuries and pains of a non-fatal kind; whether the agent is the only one who is exempt from death and/or pain, or whether she has com- pany; and whether exemption comes upon her late in life, or during a more formative stage of her existence. I think we give the proponent of immortality the strongest-case if we imagine the agent as non-isolated, so that the pain of difference does not, by itself, blight her life, and as having lived this way all along, or at least since earliest childhood, so that a jar- ring discrepancy between expectation and result does not spoil it either. (We can even suppose her immortal in both directions, so that she has no childhood.) And let us choose a minimal change where vulnerability is concerned, removing death alone without removing pain and other related limitations on her physical power. 34 Williams (I973)- SYMPOSIUM ON DEATH 337</page><page sequence="36">This thought experiment has already been performed, by Homer and by Greek culture as a whole: it is the story of the Olympian gods, frozen immortal anthropomorphic adults. The question we want to ask of their story is, how many of the virtues and values we prize would turn up in their unbounded lives? In removing death from these human-like crea- tures, note, we have made two changes: a change concerning risk, and a change concerning time. The Gods live eternally, and on this account there is a marked limit to the risk they can undergo. The first thing we notice about the gods is that they cannot have the vir- tue of courage, as we know and honor it. For courage consists in a certain way of acting and reacting in face of death and the risk of death. A being who cannot take that risk cannot have that virtue - or can have, as we in fact see with the gods and their attitude to pain, only a pale simulacrum of it. This means, as well, that the component of friendship, love, and love of country that consists in a willingness to give up one's life for the other must be absent as well - indeed, must be completely mysterious and obscure to people whose experience does not contain the sense of mortal- ity. Thus, as in fact we see in Homer, there is a kind of laxness and light- ness in the relationships of the gods, a kind of playful unheroic quality that contrasts sharply with the more intense character of human love and friendship, and has, clearly, a different sort of value. In heaven there is, in two senses, no Achilles: no warrior risking everything he is and has, and no loving friend whose love is such that he risks everything on account of his friend. Friendship so differently constituted will not be the same thing, or have the same value. Beyond this, we begin to discover that many of the virtues we prize require an awareness of the limits and needs of the human body that will be absent, as such, from a being who can never die. Moderation, as we know it, is a management of appetite in a being for whom excesses of cer- tain sorts can bring illness and eventually death; who needs to deal with other beings similarly constituted, for whom the stakes are similarly high. Political justice and private generosity are concerned with the allocation of resources like food, seen as necessary for life itself, and not simply for play or amusement. The profound seriousness and urgency of human thought about justice arises from the awareness that we all really need the things that justice distributes, and need them for life itself. If that need were removed, or made non-absolute, distribution would not matter, or not matter in the same way and to the same extent; and the virtue of jus- tice would become optional or pointless accordingly. Aristotle is right to say that the idea of debates about justice and contract among the gods is a 3 3 8 MARTHA C. NUSSBAUM</page><page sequence="37">ridiculous idea (EN 1178bio-i6).35 The closer we come to reimporting mortality - for example, by importing the possibility of permanent unbearable pain, or crippling handicaps - the closer we come to a human sense of the virtues and their importance. But that is the point: the further mortality is removed, the further they are. These changes change still further the structure of personal, family, and social relationships. If parents are not necessary to enable children to sur- vive and grow, if a city is not necessary for the life of its citizens, if altruis- tic sacrifices of what one actually needs cannot be made, then human rela- tionships would more and more take on the optional, playful character that Homer, depicting the gods, so marvelously shows us. And of course the absence of temporal limit, and the changed attitude this brings towards intergenerational relationships (if generations remain in any form) towards birth and growth (if there is any), towards all relationships whose structure and point is connected with growth, change, and process, would lead to still more remarkable changes, difficult even to imagine. We cannot suppose that the precise pleasure of Nikidion's spring morning would be found, even as a solitary event, in the life of an immortal being; for part of her understanding of and joy in nature and its finite temporal movement derives from her own self-understanding as a natural being related to nature and to other finite human beings in certain concrete ways, moving as nature and other human beings are moving, and partak- ing of a similar fragility. It is hard to imagine Apollo taking such a walk. And, in general, the intensity and dedication with which very many human activities are pursued cannot be explained without reference to the awareness that our opportunities are finite, that we cannot choose these activities indefinitely many times. In raising a child, in cherishing a lover, in performing a demanding task of work or thought or artistic creation, we are aware, at some level, of the thought that each of these efforts is structured and constrained by finite time. And the removal of that aware- ness would surely change the pursuits and their meaning for us in ways that we can scarcely imagine - making them, perhaps, more easy, more optional, with less of striving and effort in them, less of a particular sort of gallantry and courage. Gods are, as Heraclitus observed,36 in a paradoxi- cal way finite; for they are dead to, closed off from, the value that we see, the beauty that delights us. From the haunting beauty of Nikidion's morn- ing; from the embrace of a parent and a child; from the struggle to do good work inside the constraints of a finite human life. There would be 3 On this, see Nussbaum (I986) ch. II. 36 On Heraclitus, see Nussbaum (1972). For related arguments, see Nussbaum (i986) ch. II. SYMPOSIUM ON DEATH 3I39</page><page sequence="38">other sources of value, no doubt, within such an existence. But its consti- tutive conditions would be so entirely different from ours that we cannot really imagine what they would be. Nor, if we could, would they be of any immediate importance for us. We are judging the gods' life from the point of view of our empirical human sense of value. This may seem, in a sense, unfair - unfair in partic- ular to Epicurus, who insists that we cannot rely on uncriticized intu- itions. But recall what we are attempting to show. We are not attempting to show that an immortal existence could not have value, beauty, and meaning internal to itself. Unlike Williams, I believe that we do not have good reason to say this; and that we have, of necessity, far too little under- standing of the structure and the "language" of such a life even to investi- gate that question well. What we are attempting to show is the extent to which our values would be absent in that life; and that is the thing most relevant to a therapeutic treatment of our always impossible wish to have that life in place of our own. It is, as well, the only perspective on value from which we can coherently proceed, in asking a question for ourselves: for in asking about ourselves there is not much point in asking whether a certain life seems good from the point of view of creatures that we have no chance of ever being, or rather creatures becoming identical to which we would no longer be ourselves. When Epicurus asks us to look critically at intuitions, he does not require such a total departure; if he did, he would not be the interesting philosopher that he is. He asks us, rather, to conduct a more profound and searching inquiry into the totality of our thought about ourselves; and this we can claim to be doing when we think as we have. In Wallace Stevens's poem "Sunday Morning,"37 the female speaker, looking in nature for some paradise, -some transcendence, finds that the conventional images of paradise do not, in fact, contain the mortal beauty that she loves: There is not any haunt of prophecy, Nor any old chimera of the grave, Neither the golden underground, nor isle Melodious, where spirits gat them home, Nor visionary south, nor cloudy palm Remote on heaven's hill, that has endured As April's green endures; or will endure Like her remembrance of awakened birds, Or her desire for June and evening, tipped By the consummation of the swallow's wings. (IV) 17 Wallace Stevens (I954). 340 MARTHA C. NUSSBAUM</page><page sequence="39">Her attempt to imagine an enduring value cancels, paradoxically, the very sort of enduring that she prizes: the enduring that is inseparable from transience and motion, and from her own awareness of her own transi- ence. (For what she finds wonderful expresses, clearly, her own sense of her finite time.) She calls out again for immortality, saying, "But in con- tentment I still feel/ The need of some imperishable bliss." (V) (The need that Epicurus allows, and claims still to satisfy.) Her answer comes back directly: Death is the mother of beauty; hence from her Alone, shall come fulfilment to our dreams And our desires. (V) Finally she hears, in the silence, a voice that seems to tell her that real value is not beyond this world in some separate spiritual realm; it is in living a life that ends in the grave. The poem ends with an account of the place in which we live, a place of death and mutability, in which we find whatever value we find, set off against that background: We live in an old chaos of the sun, Or old dependency of day and night, Or island solitude, unsponsored, free, Of that wide water, inescapable. Deer walk upon our mountains, and the quail Whistle about us their spontaneous cries; Sweet berries ripen in the wilderness; And, in the isolation of the sky, At evening, casual flocks of pigeons make Ambiguous undulations as they sink, Downward to darkness, on extended wings. (VIII) The geography of our world is structured by its ending; the light appears as light against that darkness, the graceful motion of its life against the void that contains no motion. It is these facts that we want Lucretius to consider, and his pupil. Our argument does not oppose Nikidion's fear of death. It tells her that fear is appropriate because based upon true beliefs about death's badness and life's value. But it reminds her of the positive role of that fear, as an appropriate expression of her awareness of the constitutive conditions of human finite value. It tells her not to hate her fear, not to use it as an excuse to flee from human things, but to see its just cause, instead, as the condition of her best possibilities. When the spring brings round its sequence of beauties and pains and fears, she will, following this argu- ment, embrace the pain and fear along with the delight; for she will see how they are connected. She will not avoid circumstances that evoke fear, SYMPOSIUM ON DEATH 341</page><page sequence="40">or try to fashion herself a life without it. For she will know how fear is linked with a conception of the good that, on reflection, she endorses. We must emphasize that this does not mean that she will view death as a good thing, or cease to struggle against it. For death would not be the sort of value-constituting limit it is in human life, if it were a limit to be embraced with equanimity. It is better called the step-mother of beauty, rather than the mother. She will continue to fear and to avoid it, and she will believe it rational to do so. It does mean that in fearing and avoiding it she will not condemn the whole condition of mortality itself, or imagine the condition of gods as superior in worth. If she should find herself dying prematurely, this argument has little to say to her. Such a death is a terrible thing, and is a reason for rage as well as for fear. As she reaches the time normally associated, in her historical time, with the vague idea of "a complete life," the time vaguely, but implicitly, involved in her planning for a life, she might view the advent of death with somewhat less negative emotion. And yet, so long as she still has valuable activities under way, she will be justified in fearing death. The argument is incomplete. For it should, ultimately, investigate not only death, but other limits as well: the human being's susceptibility to pain and disease, our need for food and drink, our proneness to accidents of various kinds, our birth into the world as vulnerable babies who depend absolutely on the love and good will of those outside of us, our need throughout life for the support and love of others. All these things are, seen in one way, limitations; and yet all can plausibly be seen as neces- sary conditions of some type of specifically human value; perhaps, in some cases, as something more - as a constituent part of the valuable relation or activity. All this would be an appropriate and natural continu- ation of our therapeutic argument, although we cannot pursue these fur- ther issues here.8 In this argument, together with the argument from the whole of nature that we have endorsed, we have the complex basis for a truly naturalistic therapy for the fear of death. It is the appropriate development of the 38 This further argument would have implications for the question of premature death. For we would have to reflect that human life is not only a place of death, it is also a place of accident. There is in real life no such thing as the "normal life span," except as a statistical artifact. Premature and accidental deaths are a ubiquitous fact of human life. We cannot be sure, without a great deal of further reflection, to what extent this fact affects the con- stitution of mortal values. Suppose all lives were of the same duration, and ended in a pre- dictable way, without Nature's caprice and inequity. This seems to be a good situation; and indeed it is one we try to bring about in many ways. But we need to look more deeply before fully accepting that conclusion, asking what human life would be were Nature really under our control to that degree. 34X MARTHA C. NUSSBAUM</page><page sequence="41">naturalistic portions of Lucretius' argument, prised loose from its conflicting commitment to transcendence. Epicurus and Lucretius claim to deliver us from religion; but they teach a hatred of finitude and a love of godlike existence. This therapeutic argument, by contrast, can actually claim, in both of its parts, to do what Epicurus said he wanted: to "make the mortality of life enjoyable, not by adding on some infinite time, but by removing the longing for immortality." The truly naturalistic pupil of Lucretius should I suggest, prefer this therapy - which does not remove fear, but balances and opposes it with other reflections that ought to diminish its immobilizing power - to the therapy that Lucretius' poem presents. VIII But these balancing and alleviating arguments do not, like Lucretius', banish all fear; and Lucretius has argued that so long as the fear of death is not completely banished it will cause many bad consequences in human life. Now, therefore, we must return to the Epicurean diagnosis, asking whether the bad consequences of fear will appear in Nikidion's life, should she choose to listen to our revised therapy. For it is hard not to agree with Lucretius that the consequences he mentions are bad; and he has made a powerful case for a causal link between the fear of death and these consequences. So if we should discover that Nikidion's moderated fear still entails those consequences, we would still have one strong argu- ment for shifting over to the more radical Epicurean therapy, in spite of all that we have said against it. How, then, will Nikidion live, if she believes, in her heart, all that we have argued here? The bad consequences of the fear of death were, we recall, of four kinds: dependence upon religion; inability to enjoy other pleasures (cul- minating, in the extreme case, in a total hatred of life); pointless frenetic and anxious behavior, together with the subjective feeling of a great weight or burden; and, finally, various forms of harmful and immoral behavior aimed at seizing a kind of worldly immortality in the form of money, power, and reputation. These categories are closely related. Reli- gion, for example, is condemned not only because it is false and irrational, but also because it makes us hate our human activities, and inspires vari- ous forms of immoral action. Immoral behavior increases fear of the gods, and therefore, in turn, our dependence on religion. Frenetic behavior is prompted by a desire to flee oneself, thus by a hatred of our merely mortal existence; thus it is closely linked to the inability to enjoy. What will Niki- dion's relation be to this web of consequences? The turning to religion, in Lucretius' persuasive analysis, was prompted not so much by the fear of death simpliciter as by the belief that SYMPOSIUM ON DEATH 343</page><page sequence="42">this fear is a weakness, and that the gods live better because they live with- out it. By inspiring in Nikidion a love of the fragile and the human in human life, a love, however unstable and uneasy, of the very limits that separate her from godlike beings, the revised therapeutic arguments ought to work against the turning to religion, making it possible for us to live where we are, with joy rather than hatred. Indeed, it can be claimed that only this revised therapy really breaks the hold of religion: the Lucretian therapy simply turns us over to a new image of divinity, a new form of self- hatred. Nikidion's concern for the whole of nature ought to undercut still further the role played by otherworldly religion in her life. For she will suspect (following Lucretius' other arguments about mind and religion) that it is an institution neither consistent with a true account of the whole nor good for the life of the whole. Much the same can be said of the relationship between fear and her other pleasures and activities. Because Nikidion does not connect the fear of death with a weak or bad condition, a condition to be transcended at all costs, she will not let it cancel her joy in the various beauties that human life contains. Indeed, she will observe reflectively, as previously she did not, how deeply the joy and the fear are interrelated; and she will there- fore not be inclined to turn aside from her pleasures in an anxious search for an end to fear. Here again, we might say that this therapeutic argu- ment does better than Lucretius' own: for he requires Nikidion to turn aside from most of her previous values, pleasures, and activities in the name of godlike life. (This shows us a further reason why our critical argu- ment must be concerned with value, as well as with structures of desire: for only a defense based on value will reveal how much Epicurus has in fact diminished Nikidion's life.) The perspective of the whole will, in gen- eral, enhance and not undercut Nikidion's pleasures. It will take away such pleasures as come from damaging the whole, or denying the impor- tance of the whole. But this seems to be a good rather than a bad conse- quence. And it will add to her life the great joy and value of understanding the world, perhaps one of the greatest pleasures available to a human life; and all the greater, it seems, for a human life that places itself within the world, rather than apart from it. For she will still have in her life the joy of philosophical reasoning: not the pleasure of turning oneself over to a wise doctor for a total cure, but the truer and better pleasure of engaging in a particularly fine form of human activity. The feeling of being burdened, and the associated frenetic activity, were caused, above all, by ignorance and denial of oneself and one's real condi- tion. Nikidion's therapy not only removes the ignorance, it also removes the hatred of human limits that causes the denial. A person who loves her- 3 44 MARTHA C. NUSSBAUM</page><page sequence="43">self, and her limits as constitutive of herself, has no motive to flee herself. And here once again we can say that only the revised therapy really goes to the root of the problem. Epicurus permits us to hate and flee ourselves. He promises a secure and peaceful destination; but there is no doubt that it is the terminus of a flight, a shore where one watches, with relief, the other poor mortals who go on being themselves. Since our arguments have not cancelled fear, and have insisted on the human values of this pain and rest- lessness, there will remain in Nikidion's life some restless, striving activ- ity. She will not achieve, or strive for, complete ataraxia. But this seems both good and human. And it does not look pointless or hollow, once it is seen, as the therapy sees it, as a natural and valuable part of human life. Finally we turn to the ways in which mortals seek worldly immortality, and the forms of damage and immorality that result. This appears to be the most difficult Lucretian charge for us to answer, since it might be thought that by confining the human being to the human world, by deny- ing her Epicurean as well as religious transcendence, and leaving her with the sense of pain at her own finitude, we have greatly increased her moti- vation to undertake these harmful actions - whereas the Epicurean life, if non-human, is also benign. Here we must point out, again, that the therapy we propose is evalua- tive, not simply concerned with the description of the way human desire actually goes. And it is part of a more general evaluative inquiry, which would include a scrutiny of the value of money and power in human life. Because of this, this therapy, unlike an account that limited itself to an analysis of desire, can point out, as it goes along, that among the human ways of struggling against human limits, some are better and more valu- able than others. The ways of power, reputation, and money are among the most prudentially unsound - in that they base the effort of human striving and imagining on goods that are both external and unstable. But they are also unsound in a deeper way: because they attempt to extend a person's life beyond itself using vehicles that are, in their impersonal nature, unsuited to express the identity of the person who is trying to project herself through them. And they are also among the most evalua- tively impoverished, since they pour the intensity of human activity into an external thing that cannot really be more than a means to activity. It seems unlikely that a Nikidion who undertakes a comprehensive inquiry into the whole range of the specifically human values will choose these things as her vehicle. At this point we notice something quite remarkable. It is, that in his sur- vey of consequences Lucretius has completely forgotten to consider the possibility that the fear of death may have, as well, some good conse- SYMPOSIUM ON DEATH 345</page><page sequence="44">quences in human life. First of all, in a very obvious way, this fear is con- ducive to our self-preservation: for it motivates prudent and cautious behavior, towards ourselves and towards others, just as the ability to feel pain motivates behavior that avoids bodily harm.39 It is likely that crea- tures who lacked this fear completely would come to grief. Epicurus will point out that self-preservation is a good consequence only if death is bad, which is just what he denies. But still, our ability to manage our lives in a stable and self-preserving way does seem to be linked to other valued Epi- curean (and Lucretian) ends, such as the formation of political communi- ties, of the bonds of family and friendship, and indeed the attainment of freedom from pain itself - for creatures without self-preserving caution will get injured more often and suffer more pain. So it is not obvious that Epicurus can wholly dismiss this consequence as morally irrelevant, even within his own conception of the good. More important still, Lucretius' argument, in speaking of the ways in which people try to become immortal in this life, has omitted many forms of expressive human activity that humans have chosen as vehicles for their own continuation. It has, that is, omitted all those forms that seem benign or even very good, all the forms described by Plato's Diotima, in her reflection about the way in which the awareness of mortality stimulates a desire to beget value.40 These include: the creation and rearing of chil- dren; the creation of works of art; the creation of good political condi- tions and systems of laws; the creation of ideas and scientific or philo- sophical inquiries; in short, the creation of all worldly beauty and value that expresses the creator's own identity, and in which she can, in a specifically human way, live on in the world after her death. The Epicu- rean agent must reject this search for a historically evolving and human immortality, just as he rejects the search for immortality in possessions. The only immortality that can count for him is that of the single moment's godlike thought. Like a god, furthermore, he is required to "look at all things with a calm mind": all things, including human suffering, including injustice, including the absence of beauty. So even if he were not forbidden to seek this sort of continuation of himself, he would lack the other motives for creation that most people have. Nikidion's fear and discon- tent, combined with her love of and concern for human things, will, by contrast, provide her with a powerful set of motives towards the creation of worldly value. 39 This is the central thesis of Rorty (i983); a similar view has been expressed to me in dis- cussion by R. M. Hare. 40 Symposium zo6C-2ziA, on which see Kosman (1976). 346 MARTHA C. NUSSBAUM</page><page sequence="45">Describing the contribution of the dead Keats in Adonais, Shelley writes that through his work Keats has achieved a continuation in the world of nature, as an ongoing part of that world.4' The poet-speaker realizes, with great joy, that in this particularly appropriate and human way, Keats has not died: He lives, he wakes - 'tis Death is dead, not he; Mourn not for Adonais. - Thou young Dawn, Turn all thy dew to splendour, for from thee The spirit thou lamentest is not gone. (XLI) Nikidion can respond to this joy; and, responding, seek in her own life to make a similar contribution to the changing world. This need not be in the form of great masterpieces. It might perhaps simply be by living in a fam- ily and a community, and giving to these, that she gives herself to the whole - as, in Stevens's poem, people living together in nature and in society . . .shall know well the heavenly fellowship Of men that perish and of summer morn. (VII) If we believe that this is a good way to live with ourselves and with others, we have good reason not to choose the Epicurean therapy. And the Epicurean argument that we have accepted, the appeal to the perspective of nature, increases her motivation for creative activity. For it tells Nikidion that she should live her life in a spirit of concern for the other members of her kind and for other living beings. So thinking, she will be less likely to go towards death in silence; for she will want, before death, to give something of herself to the whole and the future, in what- ever way best suits her nature: as a mother, a scientist, a poet, a just legis- lator. Her other-regarding and self-regarding motives fit well together. Just as she seeks for herself continuation in history and in nature, so at the same time she will seek to give to history and nature. The Epicurean, by contrast, armed with a concern for the whole, but too godlike to have the motives for creation that come from the fear of death, will not give her own other-regarding goals the best sort of service. We can, I think, go further. It is not at all clear that the kind of concern with the whole that the voice of Nature urges is even compatible with the godlike perspective on life that Lucretius elsewhere recommends. Stand- ing so far above and beyond mortal troubles, the cured Epicurean seems to have no reason to meddle in the world, no more reason than do the Epi- 4I I do not, of course, mean to deny that the poem also pervasively expresses an interest in Platonic transcendence; it is not entirely clear to me how its conceptions of immortality are related. SYMPOSIUM ON DEATH 347</page><page sequence="46">curean gods; and certainly they have no concern with alleviating the suf- fering of others by creative activity. Both fellow-feeling and a sense of one's own finitude are, according to the Epicurean account of the gods, motives for creation on behalf of others that are lacking in the gods' lives. So it is not clear that the Epicurean can heed Nature's voice to even a lim- ited extent, caring for the whole and its beings, present and future. It is very revealing that when Lucretius speaks of his own poetic voca- tion he alludes to both of these non-Epicurean motivations.4" To fellow- feeling in Book I, when he speaks of nature's Venus, goddess of "the whole class of living things," as the patron of his poetic efforts; to the desire to leave a mark on human life when, in both Book I and Book IV, he speaks of his longing for appropriate praise, a longing that "strikes my heart with a deep Dionysian thyrsus" (I.9zi-z), leading him to "seek a distinguished crown for my head from a place from which the Muses have never previously crowned anyone's temples" (I.929-30 = IV.4-5). This is not, clearly, the bad love of fame and power that Lucretius assails in his attack on fear: for the poet makes it abundantly clear that what he wants is fame for good activity, and for helping others who need help. His desire would not be satisfied by any fame not so earned. But it is, still, a creative and other-regarding aim that fits oddly with the Epicurean project of detaching the agent from concern with the human world and its accidents. If it seems in many ways to be the appropriate fulfillment of the demand of Lucretius' voice of Nature, it also reveals to us as clearly as anything in the poem the depth of the tension between that voice and the voice of godlike transcendence. And the fact that a poet officially committed to godlike transcendence cannot, or will not, explain his own actions to us in terms of that commitment, shows us just how difficult it is to see that transcen- dence as sufficient for a good human life.43 42 See the sensitive discussion of these passages, and of the evolving stance of the poet- speaker, in Segal (i988), who finds here a profound tension between Lucretius the poet and Lucretius the Epicurean philosopher. Although I find Segal's discussion excellent, and an invaluable basis for further work on these questions, I am more inclined than he is to find this tension in Epicureanism itself, as a tension between its aspiration to give us a natural life and its aspiration to give us a godlike life. 43 I am grateful to audiences at the University of St. Andrews, Scotland, and at Concordia University, Montreal, for most helpful comments when I presented an earlier draft of this paper. And I would particularly like to thank David Halperin, Stephen Rosenbaum, and Ernest Sosa for their detailed and helpful comments; I have learned much by reading unpublished manuscripts on this topic by Rosenbaum and by Charles Segal. 348 MARTHA C.
