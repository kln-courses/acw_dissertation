Cam- bridge: Cambridge University Press, 2001. Pp. xvi + 228. J. Samuel Preus's Spinoza and the Irrelevance of Biblical Autbolity is the culmination of the author's long-standing interest in the nexus of several fields: the history of biblical scholarship, the origins of the study of reli- gion as a secular discipline, and the study of Spinoza and his early mod- ern context. Coming on the heels of his earlier article on Spinoza's contemporary interlocutors,' Spinoza and the Irleelevance of Biblical Autbority brings together Preus's three principal interests into a cogent and read- able account of Spinoza's project in his anonymously published Tractatus Theo/oqico-Politicut.2 Spinoza is a crucial figure for Preus. As a thinker who gave us one of the first historical readings of the Bible, Spinoza inaugurated not only the modern study of this text but also the modern study of religion more generally. He coupled hermeneutic and conceptual innovations with a powerful political argument for the freedom and de- mocracy which he felt went hand in hand with them. Preus's book enters the field of Spinoza studies with a welcome focus on the 17th-century context of these achievements. The book has two main aims. The first is to investigate "the rise of a critical, historical and comparative study of scriptures independent of their theological interpretation from Jewish or Christian 'insider' per- spectives" (p. ix). This aim, Preus notes, extends his earlier inquiry in Explaining Religion: Criticism and Theory from Bodin to Freud (1996), a book that, as its title suggests, explores the emergence of the study of religion as a theory and a discipline irrespective of theology. In Spinoza and the Irrelevance of Biblical Autbority, the focus is on the history of the demotion of Scripture from its status as a uniquely privileged book, making way for its comparison with other ancient texts and with other religions. "Spi- noza," Preus writes, "was the first to accomplish this" by making the claims about the Bible's status simply one more historical fact about it, like its languages and its contents. In this light, "theology, rather than 1. "A Hidden Opponent in Spinoza's Treatiie," Harvard Theological Relzvew 88 (1995): 361-388. 2.

Samuel Shirley (Indianapolis, 1991).</page><page sequence="2">192 JQR 94:1 (2004) being a part of the explanation of religion, now became part of its data" (pp. ix-x). The second aim of the book is to situate the Treatise more adequately in its seventeenth century intellectual context, paying particular attention to Spinoza's theological contemporaries, whether interlocutors, oppo- nents, or simply other interpreters of the Bible. Here Preus's focus is especially on Ludwig Meyer (whose Philosophy of the Interpreter of Scripture appeared in 1666), as well as Meyer's many theological critics, whose discussions shaped the debate into which Spinoza's Treatise was a particu- larly radical volley. Meyer was a friend and interlocutor of Spinoza and the author of the introduction to the only work that Spinoza published in his own name in his lifetime, The Principles of Carteitan Philosophy Geo- metrically Demonstrated, which appeared in 1663 along with an appendix entitled Metaphyitcal Thoughts. Both men were deeply committed to phi- losophy, a fact that, according to Preus, has gone a long way toward generating one crucial misunderstanding about the Treatise, namely, that Spinoza, like Meyer, is as much a rationalist in his biblical interpretation as in his philosophy. To Preus, this assumption ignores the fact that the Treatise is Spinoza's effort to delegitimize not only theological readings of the Bible but also philosophical readings. Preus's claim is that in order to achieve this end without seeming to engage in overt criticism of his contemporaries, Spinoza disguised his philosophical opponent (who was really the Christian Meyer) as the Jewish medieval philosopher Maimon- ides and his theological opponents (who were really Meyer's Christian critics) as the Jewish medieval exegete Alfakhar. In so doing, Spinoza could promulgate what he knew to be highly controversial theses without incurring the anger of his friend and without getting into hot water with the censors (although one should note that he may have achieved the first but he certainly failed miserably at the second). Both aims converge in Preus's main thesis, which is that the Treath2e is a book that advocates a purely historical reading of the Bible, one that attends to its contexts of authorship, its languages, and its transmission through the ages, and prescinds entirely from treating the Bible as it was traditionally treated -as a sacred text. To be sure, other readers of the Treatise have focused on this dimension of it, and many have written about Spinoza's biblical interpretation. But no one, argues Preus, has carefully enough revealed the contemporary conversations into which Spinoza's historicism ought to properly be located, and no one has stressed to an adequate degree the extent of Spinoza's disdain for any but the most reductive reading of the Bible. In Preus's language, it is the total "irrele- vance of biblical authority" that marks Spinoza's impressive and lasting</page><page sequence="3">PREUS, IRRELEVANCE OF BIBLICAL AUTHORLTY-LEVENE 193 contribution to the study of the Bible and the biblical world. That is, the Bible is not only comparable to other books and world religions; outside of its theological contexts, it is irrelevant to public life, irrelevant to the effort to secure a generalized import from its pages, and irrelevant even to common readers, who are "encouraged to derive whatever religious message they please from scripture" (p. x). There is a crucial ambiguity here that insinuates itself throughout the book. Spinoza and the Irrelevance of Biblical Autbority presents itself as a book about interpretation-about Spinoza's dismissal of biblical authori- ties who would seek to enforce orthodox readings on an uneducated audi- ence, and his replacement of such authorities with the common reader. In this light, it is the biblical authorities (whether philosophical or theo- logical) who are irrelevant, who must no longer prevent the common reader from reading the Bible her- or himself. Yet it is also a book about the irrelevance of the Bible's authority, the irrelevance of biblical author- ity regardless of who is reading it. For, as Preus makes clear in his pref- ace, and as was true with the concept "religion" in Explaining Religion, it is the authority of the biblical text itself that (like the theologians' "reli- gion") has disabled a proper history of Western thought and culture. For Preus, we not only need a history of the Bible; we need history (and secular politics and culture) without the Bible. Both, he says, we get from Spinoza. On the first count, namely, the irrelevance of the Bible's authorities, Preus's book is a real contribution. To make vivid Spinoza's difference from his contemporaries (including also where he appropriated elements of their positions), and to illuminate just what Spinoza's conception of a historical reading amounted to, Preus investigates a wide array of theo- logical standpoints from the seventeenth century Dutch Republic, al- though these standpoints also represent the general spectrum of biblical interpretation in both Protestant and Roman Catholic Europe in this pe- riod. These range from the stance of Meyer, whose philosophical inter- pretation of Scripture was designed to minimize the violent controversies about the meaning of the text, to two kinds of opponents of Meyer. The first are those whom Preus calls the "Protestant right," who vociferously rejected the autonomy of reason, emphasizing either the "objectivity of the text," that is, "that scripture would be its own interpreter," according to Samuel Maresius, or "the internal work of the Holy Spirit as the in- terpreter," as Peter Sararius wrote (p. 69). The second are those who represent the "liberal" position, who criticized what they saw as the su- perstition contained in the views of the Protestant right and rejected both its recourse to the inviolable text alone and Meyer's recourse to philoso-</page><page sequence="4">194 JQR94:1 (2004) phy, preferring to read the biblical text through a historical lens. As Preus relates, liberal interpreters such as the theologians Ludwig Wolzogen and Lambert van Velthuysen helped to disengage questions of the meaning of the text from questions of truth, arguing that "biblical interpretation was based entirely on reason, grammar, and language," and that the Bible's authors were not "philosophers" (p. 115). Preus shows that Spinoza's thinking about the Bible overlapped with elements from all of these posi- tions, taking from Meyer an impatience with theological controversy, from the right an insistence that faith and reason occupy distinct spheres, and from the liberals the centrality of historical method. What Spinoza accomplished, however, was to go further than any of these views, with their implicit or explicit assumptions about the privileged status of the Bible. As Preus puts it, Spinoza's was a fully "naturalized" Bible, a book like other books, and history was the "way to break the hermeneutical circle of his time, which straightjacketed the interpreter by demanding that he interpret according to the intention of the author, namely God" (p. 157). For Spinoza, according to Preus, God was not the author and the Bible was not a special book. It was a book that could henceforth be explained with no constraints. Preus is especially good at conveying the nuances of competing posi- tions and, as he puts it, the "career of the Bible" during this period (p. 17). He is also excellent at giving a sense of the degree to which Spinoza's criticisms of biblical interpretation were contemporary. It still bears emphasizing that Spinoza also had a legitimate and clearly stated critique of both Maimonides and Alfakhar, not as Jews so much as dogmatists and skeptics, the categories into which he divided the Greek- influenced medieval Christian and Jewish philosophical traditions. However, Preus's argument does not detract from this perspective and genuinely adds to our understanding of Spinoza's immediate quarrels. Above all, Preus is persuasive in his case that Spinoza's intention was to liberate the Bible from what Spinoza termed its priests and popes, that is, its expositors and experts, whether they were philosophical or theological (Treatkie, p. 106). In the worst case, such interpreters removed the Bible from its intended ordinary readers and foisted alien meanings on it, meanings that served simultaneously to aggrandize the interpreters and keep ordinary readers disempowered and docile. As Spinoza fa- mously observes in the preface, there is no more useful tool of despotism than the potent mix of deception and fear that religion can be deployed to inflame (Treati?ie, p. 3). But the Bible's interpreters were also threaten- ing to Spinoza even when, as in the case of Meyer, they shared some of Spinoza's most cherished goals, namely, the reduction of factionalism and</page><page sequence="5">PREUS, IRRELEVANCE OF BIBLICAL AUTHORITY-LEVENE 195 violence. Meyer had hoped that his strenuous argument for the role of philosophy in the interpretation of such a contested document as the Bible would serve as a healing balm for the fierce adversaries that battled over its pages. But Spinoza had several objections to Meyer (and Maimonides). First and most simply, philosophy breeds its own battles. While it was true for Spinoza that reason (and the "zeal for truth") produce "only courtesy and tolerance," it was still only as useful as the human beings engaging in it, many of whom, like their theological brethren, seem to prefer violent disputes to measured argument (Treatise, p. 237). Second, Spinoza argues that even if reason is useful, indeed necessary, in reading the Bible, it needs to be balanced with the reality of the text. Spinoza's theory of interpretation is perhaps most famous for the maxim that "the method of interpreting Scripture is no different from the method of interpreting na- ture, and is in fact in complete accord with it" (Treatise, p. 89). But this maxim, suggesting as it does the primacy of reason in both reading and science, is potentially misleading without Spinoza's argument in chapter 15 of the Treatise that Scripture must not be made to conform to reason, nor reason to Scripture. It is in this latter argument that Spinoza makes clear what is at stake in "examining Scripture afresh," as he says he will do in the preface, namely the articulation of a dialectical approach to reading that ensures the sovereignty of both the text and the mind (Trea- tide, p. 5). Where Maimonides (and Meyer) go wrong is in assuming that the text conforms to the mind (dogmatism) -that reason alone can deter- mine its meaning; Alfakhar, by contrast, errs in assuming that the mind must conform to the text (skepticism) -that reason is wholly inadequate to the text, which must simply be accepted in its every word and mark. Spinoza's solution is to treat both the text and the mind of the reader as sovereign, a position equally balanced between determining the meaning of a passage and judging its truth and utility. Without reason, how can readers be expected to engage in either of these determinations? Yet with reason, one must be careful that the interpretations one offers of a text say as much about it as about oneself. Third and finally, then, contra Meyer (and Maimonides), Spinoza thinks ordinary readers are perfectly capable of engaging in this dialectic. They do not need philosophers to tell them how and what to read. Thus Preus's focus on the irrelevance of biblical authorities is quite on the mark and contains much of interest concerning the theological controversies that swirled around Spinoza (which are largely absent from the Treatise itself). What is strange, however, is that even as Preus recog- nizes the political import of Spinoza's third critique of Meyer concerning</page><page sequence="6">196 JQR 94:1 (2004) the democracy of biblical interpretation, his overall emphasis seems to be that ordinary readers would be better off not reading the Bible at all, and certainly not doing so in public. For it is Preus's view that Spinoza is to be commended not only for returning Scripture to its intended readers; he is also a modern hero for delegitimizing Scripture tout court. As Preus puts it in his concluding reflections, "No one before or since has more thoroughly nullified the authority of God's would-be interpreters in the public realm by exposing as irrelevant the biblical platform from which they held forth" (p. 203). This brings me to the second meaning of Preus's title: the irrelevance of the Bible itself. It is here that Preus's contribution to the literature on Spinoza is more problematic. Let it be said that the challenges of the Treatise are manifold, even without readers like Leo Strauss imposing Maimonidean paradigms of secret writing on it.3 On the one hand, Spino- za's critique of biblical authorities and supernaturalism is not hidden in the text. It is what one might call the Treatise's plain sense, apparent from the preface, in which Spinoza laments the degeneration of religion into "biased dogma" due to "base avarice and ambition" (Treatie, p. 4), through the final chapter, in which he condemns "schismatics" for in- flaming religious controversy out of a "lust for supremecy" (Tr-eatide, p. 237). Preus argues that the Treat&amp;e constitutes a critique of biblical authorities through the effort to remove the text from these controversies by fully and completely historicizing it-by "showing that its origin could be accounted for without remainder through human history alone" (p. 208). This is surely unexceptionable. Furthermore, to Preus, what ultimately matters is that "Spinoza held that biblical religion itself- whatever its peculiar virtues-could be understood as one historical in- stance of his more general explanation of religion," thereby freeing readers in his own day (and ours) to comprehend the "virtually univer- sal" human tendency toward anthropomorphism in fully secular terms (p. 208). But on the other hand, what exactly alre the "peculiar virtues" of bibli- cal religion, according to Spinoza? What does a reader do with the fact that Spinoza not only criticizes biblical authorities and insists on under- standing the Bible's historical context and textual corruptions but also commends the Bible to readers as that which, "insofar as it contains the Word of God, has come down to us uncorrupted," as the heading for chapter 12 announces? Very little, according to Preus, who considers it "evident that Spinoza applies history as a universal solvent of theological 3. See Strauss's Perdecuition and the Art of Writing (Chicago, 1952).</page><page sequence="7">PREUS, IRRELEVANCE OF BIBLICAL AUTHORITY- LEVENE 197 and philosophical fictions about the Bible" (p. 181). Again, this would be unexceptionable if Preus were then to give an account of Spinoza's argu- ment for the theological and philosophical verities in the Bible, which is advanced throughout the Treatife but is most densely concentrated in chapters 12-15. He does not do so. But it is in these chapters that Spinoza introduces his theory of the Bible's sacrality, which amounts to the notion that it is sacred as long as it leads to piety and (true) religion (what he also calls the "Word of God"), but only as long as it does so (Treatiae, p. 153). This the Bible itself knows, Spinoza writes, in its account of how the prophets call a certain place that was formerly sacred a "house of iniquity . . . because the Israelites, at the instigation of Jeroboam, were there wont to sacrifice to idols" (Treatise, p. 150). What this means, says Spinoza, is that the words on the page of the biblical text, like Jacob's house of worship, like Solomon's Temple, indeed like the very tablets upon which Moses wrote God's revelation, are not sacred in themselves, not sacred by virtue of their connection to some holy source. Rather, they are sacred because of what human beings do with them -because of how they challenge and are challenged by human actors. Does the Bible imply that the word of God was shattered when Moses came down from Mount Sinai and smashed the tablets upon seeing the Israelites worshipping the golden calf? By no means, according to Spinoza's reading of Exodus and Deuteronomy. The point was always how those words were able to find and give life amongst the people. This is, to be sure, a "secular" reading of the sacredness of the Bible if what one means by religion is something supernatural. But that is clearly not all one can mean by religion -in Spinoza's day, in ours, and in that of the Bible itself. To the extent that he focuses on the word of God as a transcendental discourse present among the Israelites as their (own) standard, Spinoza's is on one level a perfectly "orthodox" reading of the biblical narratives, Jewish and Christian. The covenant with God is de- pendent upon the virtue of human beings. But Spinoza goes further. He insists that the Bible requires virtuous readers too and he emphasizes the simplicity of the biblical message as contrasted with the "profound mysteries" and "wild fancies" conjured by Scripture's gatekeepers (Trea- tide, p. 89), as well as its critique of power-mongering both religious and political, and its focus on practice and way of life even to the exclusion of itself: "Scripture itself tells us quite clearly over and over again what every man should do in order to serve God, declaring that the entire Law consists in this alone, to love one's neighbor" (Treatise, p. 164). To those who would cavalierly point to the Bible as evidence of some special rela- tionship with God, Spinoza, paraphrasing Jeremiah, comments that "al-</page><page sequence="8">198 JQR 94:1 (2004) though Scripture is in your keeping, you are wrong in saying that you have the Law of God, since you have rendered it vain" (Treatise, p. 151). Preus seeks to diffuse the import Spinoza attributes to the Bible by observing that "the religious values that Spinoza found in scripture for his own time were those that could also be derived from reason" (p. 204). But the point for Spinoza is not only that the Bible teaches justice and charity, ideals the philosopher can come to through other means (i.e., through reason). It is that the Bible, in Spinoza's view, knows this. The Bible is the one sacred text that knows it is not sacred except insofar as it produces virtuous readers. It is a text that commends justice and char- ity by insisting that they are not unique to its pages, that is, they are relative to the mind. It is a text that contains the word of God by display- ing the faults and corruptions that could only be identified as such with reference to its internal standard. It is a text that contains its own distinc- tion between truth and history, despite its readers' continual need to con- flate them. Yes, historical method enables a reader to comprehend the contexts of biblical authorship and language and thereby be in a position to discern its sense accurately, "to know on what occasion, at what pe- riod, and for what nation or age all these teachings were written down" (Treatise, p. 92). But "when we possess this historical account of Scripture and are firmly resolved not to assert as the indubitable doctrine of the prophets anything that does not follow from this study or cannot be clearly inferred from it, it will then be time to embark on the task of investigating the meaning of the prophets and the Holy spirit." In other words, we must "acquire a proper understanding of [the] universal doc- trine of Scripture" by investigating its truths, among which are its doc- trine of faith (ustice and charity) and its sense of the sovereignty of these values (Treatise, p. 93). Unlike the view of Meyer, reason cannot be employed alone to decide what the Bible means in any given passage, for the Bible is not the im- print of the mind of God but a human document, as Preus repeatedly stresses. The trick, or rather the difficulty, of reading the Treatiie is that the Bible's very humanity is for Spinoza, unlike Preus, its divinity: "for from Scripture itself we learn that its message, unclouded by any doubt or ambiguity, is in essence this, to love God above all, and one's neighbor as oneself. There can be no adulteration here, nor can it have been written by a hasty and errant pen . . . nor could anyone have deliberately cor- rupted it without his evil intent being at once detected" (Treatice, p. 155). As Spinoza says in chapter 1, and as the Bible teaches in Gn 1:26-27, "the human mind contains the nature of God within itself in concept, and partakes thereof" (Treatise, p. 10).</page><page sequence="9">PREUS, IRRELEVANCE OF BIBLICAL AUTHORITY- LEVENE 199 I assume that Preus is not unaware of these dimensions of the Treatise. He is certainly an astute reader of the text on one level. The question then is why he makes so little of Spinoza's explicit theological and philo- sophical agenda-his investigation of what Preus calls the Bible's "pecu- liar virtues." The first reason, I think, is simply that Preus does not believe Spinoza means what he says. Since Preus's analysis centers on theological controversy, it makes sense that he might be tempted to look askance at Spinoza's effort to defend the Bible's value. Of course Spinoza defended its value, this reasoning goes; he had to, at least minimally, or rather, he chose to do so in order to ensure that he would not be dismissed by the theologians who would constitute his main readership. To my mind, this is a good instance of the limits of the very notion that Preus is extolling in Spinoza's name, namely, the notion that "history" can be a universal solvent of theological and philosophical fictions about the Bible," not to mention the Treatise itself (p. 181). History, Spinoza shows, is absolutely necessary in the project of the interpretation of any text; but in order to disrupt "theological and philosophical fictions," one needs to engage in a little theology and philosophy oneself, on one's own grounds. In separating the quest to discern meaning from the question of truth, Spinoza does not mean to exclude questions of truth from interpretation, as Preus would have it (p. 200), but simply to make clear that texts (and people) say all kinds of things, some true and some not. This strikes me as a notion of interpretation that is truer to the concept of history for which modern readers can rightly thank Spinoza. Overlooking this di- mension of the Treatise not only results in a reading that manages to leave out most of its truly innovative aspects; it impoverishes the one thing Preus does focus on, history, which in his telling is quite threadbare in- deed. The second reason I believe Preus shortchanges the Treatise is more lamentable. It comes from Preus's desire to locate the Treatise at the ori- gins both of the secular study of religion and of the modern liberal repub- lic in which the Bible is, thankfully for him, irrelevant. In the first case, it should be clear that an adequate comprehension of the words "secular" and "religious" in Spinoza forms a great deal of the challenge of reading him, a challenge Preus barely acknowledges, much less addresses. In the second case, Preus seems at one with Spinoza in fearing the manipulation of religion in the public sphere. To this end, Preus reminds us that the book is rightly termed a Theologico-Political Treat&amp;se, in which the goal is to establish a democratic republic free of religious authorities. But once again, Preus misses the ambiguity of his own language, for Spinoza's effort to expunge religious authorities from politics is not identical to the</page><page sequence="10">200 JQR 94:1 (2004) effort to exclude the Bible from political discourse. Preus (and Preus's Spinoza) seem to think that any and every use of religion in public por- tends theocracy, understood as a state ruled by religious authorities. But for Spinoza the Bible itself tells us about the nature of political freedom - the Bible itself is a source of the critique of tyranny. It is also the case that by theocracy, Spinoza means the government of the Israelites by God (not priests), a state of affairs he considers "a matter of theory rather than fact" even in ancient Israel, where "in reality the Hebrews retained their sovereign right completely" (Treatiie, p. 196). Theocracy is theoreti- cal because God is not in reality a ruler; but it is also in its way demo- cratic, for by its terms, the Israelites, "equally and with one voice" "resolved to transfer their right not to any mortal man, but to God alone ... in the same way as we have previously conceived it ... in the case of an ordinary [democratic] community when men decide to surrender their natural right" (Tr-eatiie, p. 195). In this light, theocracy, as Spinoza under- stood it, is not only not to be feared (in reality); it is, like the covenant with God, the transcendental foundation of democracy itself. Preus's own need, however, is to turn this complex argument into yet another salvo in a contemporary debate about the role of religion in public life: In a day when loud voices proclaim that there is no separation of church and state in the U.S. constitution, or that the founders intended to establish a Christian nation, that religion somehow deserves a higher public status in our political system than it now enjoys, or that the authority of scripture overrides that of modern biology, a better knowl- edge of the history reviewed here would be salutary. . It would be unfortunate if we forgot the pain and suffering engendered by the European crusades, inquisitions, expulsions, witch hunts, slavery, per- secution and wars-every one an engine of coercion legitimated with solemn theological argument and endowed with scriptural authority. Such was the crucible in which Spinoza and his compatriots formu- lated the case for liberty. Informed memory of these things helps us keep our bearings in a world that does not share these ideas and does not remember this history. Such knowledge and memory is of the sort that makes us free (p. 21 1). One can sympathize (perhaps today more than ever) with Preus's impas- sioned closing remarks without allowing them to constitute the key to a reading of Spinoza's modernity. There seems always to have been a desire to find such an interpretive key to the Treatzie, and Preus reveals exactly why: the perpetual freshness of its critique seems so useful to readers</page><page sequence="11">PREUS, IRRELEVANCE OF BIBLICAL AUTHORITY-LEVENE 201 through the ages. In fact, though, the close reader knows otherwise. There is no such key. Spinoza does not let us off that easy. For the philos- opher for whom conatus-effort, striving-is at the heart of the human project, there is nothing here, too, but the labor involved to make sense of a book that rarely ducks its own ambiguities.
