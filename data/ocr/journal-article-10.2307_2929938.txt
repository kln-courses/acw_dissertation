I Hblderlin's last line has not been much of a crux so far. All professional readers of "Mnemosyne" agree that mourning is not simply missing in this line: "Here mourning is at fault" (Hamburger's translation); "likewise, mourning is in error" (Sieburth's).3 Since Beissner first edited the poem in the Holderlin Jahr- buch of 1948-49, his first reading has remained almost unquestioned. "Fehlen" here means "fehlgehen": "Mourning ... errs like the one who failed to restrain himself and roused the anger of the Heavenly. Mourning commits the same error as this one in that it also lets itself slip without resistance into death. "4 Even Sattler, who seldom misses an opportunity to object to Beiss- ner's edition, wants to make sure no unsuspecting reader mistakes a sentence that could mean only one thing for the experienced Holderlinian: "According to ordinary language 'gleich' could be misunderstood as 'sofort' [immediately] and 'fehlt' as 'nicht vorhanden' [not present]. The mourning for the deceased thus corresponds to the 'sin' of the wish to die."5 Finally, however, after the difficult grammar of this poem and the many attempts to come to terms with it, nothing seems simpler than the conclusion: "Mourning is just missing" for the one who, "failing to collect his soul," must die ("for still he must"). The unanimity of Holderlin interpreters, not satisfied with mere "lack" and insist- ing on the weightier "erring" of mourning, gives evidence of a peculiar blind- ness that confirms the questionable state of affairs ex negative, in the denial. 2.

The second time, though, he risks a paraphrase that leaves no further insight to be wished: "die Trauigen (die griechischen Helden) mussen doch (sterben), aber die Trauer (des Dichters) fehlet."6 True to the letter ("buchstabengetreu"), he holds firmly to Hold- erlin's text: "fehlet" is the crucial word that defies paraphrase. The problem, which is carefully preserved down to the phonetic representation of de Man's paraphrase, moveover cannot be reproduced in translation. Mindful of Hold- erlin research, the English translator of de Man's text not surprisingly follows the pattern of established interpretation, especially when it sounds so familiar from this author's mouth: "the mournful ones (the Greek heroes) must none- theless (die) but the mourning (of the poet) is in error. "7 Error, however, cannot be the last word. A closer look into de Man's text shows that he does not corroborate the previous interpretations of "Mnemo- syne" but rather unsettles them. While these interpreters may feel secure in their readings of this poem, his paraphrase arouses the suspicion: how else, if not by its absence, could "fehlen" err? Such a question does not overleap the semantics of the passage but presupposes it. Only with this presupposition can that other, Hdlderlinian meaning acquire significance. One may say more precisely that what is essential to the development of this significance is Hdld- erlin's preference for the etymological origins of language rather than its ordi- nary uses. Mourning's error is grounded in the absence of mourning and con- sists in nothing but its lack. In a movement adapted almost mimetically to the syntax of the text, de Man sharpens the evident ambiguity of the crucial word to an undecidability of the whole sentence. Certainly, this supplementary remark of "Mnemosyne"- "dem/Gleich fehlet die Trauer"-seems to carry the burden of the poem as little for him as for Holderlin. The poet adds an afterthought, separated by a semicolon, that is well suited to overwhelm surreptitiously (hinterriicks) the central thought. The subject concerned, though not the subject of this valedictory sentence, is the insisting force of the afterthought, the poet. De Man, who sees the poet's concern with the self-protecting act "to collect his soul," follows the poet's mimetic remembrance of the heroes, "the mournfulness of which almost draws him on to a similar dying," but finally acknowledges the poet's separa- tion from the heroes "through his care for preserving memory." "The poet and the historian," he concludes in a formulation owing to "The Rhetoric of Tem- porality, " "converge in this essential point ["grounded less in a personal than in a historical experience"] to the extent that they both speak of an action that precedes them but that exists for consciousness only because of their interven- 6.

What is striking about this excessive, if crude, equation is the exemplary conclusion that sees "mourning at fault." The coda of the poem appears to be an intensification of a statement whose performative force puts the poem itself into question. II "By the figtree/My Achilles has died (and is lost to me)." Beissner designates these two lines "the germ of the poem."9 Even if the genetic argument is fallacious, it provides a useful myth that reconciles the poetics of "Mnemo- syne" with its origination and permits it, provisionally, to appropriate its last strophe for its own purposes. Like the last sentence ("dem/Gleich fehlet die Trauer"), the last strophe of "Mnemosyne" also recasts the preceding verses, retrospectively setting the end at the beginning by showing the beginning as the end. This is the movement of the myth that is remembered, the beginning that returns at the end: the homeric epic of the wrath of Achilles. Thus the question that ends the second strophe- "In wrath a traveller walks/Distantly divining with/The other, but what is this? "-finds its answer in the third. The critical commonplace of Holderlin's identification with Achilles, which has been played out on all levels by Hblderlin studies, experiences in this connec- tion an essential modification. The lyrical "I, " of which the double use of the personal pronoun reminds us ("mein Achilles mir"), does not merely show, as Beissner phrases it, an "intimate concern for the heroic figure of youth." Rather, it bears witness to an identification through wrath that results at the end of the third strophe in the inability to mourn. The remembrance of myth is directed towards its "wrathful heroes" ("zorn'gen Helden," as in the ode "Thranen").LO Even more than the death of Achilles, it pertains to the suicide of Ajax, whose anger had been inflamed by the loss of the "King's own armour" to the cunning Odysseus. The subject here is not the survivor but the death of the "many others." With the prototypical wrath of Achilles and his glorious death the derivative anger of Ajax and his ignominious suicide are brought into tragic perspective. Furthermore, it is not the case that Hdlderlin's poem amounts to a cataloguing of traditional details like the figtree, metonymic landmark of the battlefield of Troy, or Salamis, the island of Ajax. This peculiar arbitrariness of detail does not depend on the 8. Ibid., 64-65. See "The Rhetoric of Temporality" (1969), Blindness and Insight, 2nd ed.

Rather, Holderlin repeats his reading of the heroic myths of classical Greece and does so not in the enumeration of references but in the wording of his own translations. In addition to the figtree from the Iliad and Pausanias's reference to the city of Mnemosyne, this passage has to do above all with quotations from Sophocles' Ajax and Pindar's second Nemean Ode. The form of the tragic monologue and the scheme of heroic eulogy are "mixed" in such a way that Pindar's scheme, that is, the derivation of the hero from his home (Ajax from Salamis), is fulfilled and surpassed by the Sophoclean monologue (in Ajax). Pindar writes: "and truly she, the Salamis ["the unmoved Salamis" of "Mnemosyne"] was able to rear a man deadly in battle. Before the walls of Troy, Hektor learned this from Ajax." In Sophocles, however, this same man, calling to his distant Salamis, succumbs to madness and ends in suicide. In his reconstruction of H6lderlin's theory of the "modulation of tones," Szondi has worked out a progression towards "epicization" in the thesis: "the perfection [Vollendung] of the lyric lies in the epic."" Yet "Mnemosyne" shows that such an insertion of epic passages into the lyrical poem works in the service not so much of a return of the epic as of its renewed remembrance in precarious circumstances. "The tendency towards the epic in the lyrical as well as in the tragic poem," for which Szondi adduces Pindar's seventh Olym- pian Ode and Sophocles' Ajax, becomes in "Mnemosyne" itself historical: Holderlin cites it as a failed attempt. What Szondi calls, in Holderlin's phrase, "the epic treatment" of the lyrical poem goes beyond the modulation of tones and lies also outside triadic ("dialectical") construction (which is confirmed by the peculiar self-sufficiency of the third strophe within the so far insufficiently explained construction of "Mnemosyne"). Agreeing with Beissner's hypoth- esis about the origin of the poem, Szondi calls the "naive" tone of epic style the "germ-cell of the representational mode that characterizes, throughout and ever more exclusively, H6lderlin's late works." Following early remarks by Benjamin, Adorno gave this naive-epic mode of representation in late Hold- erlin the name "paratactic, " and therein identified in particular its metonymic character. More precise than Jakobson's characterization of narrative in terms of metonomy, Adorno's parataxis signifies a "resistance to synthesis" that rests more on a grammatical than a semantical opposition of the paratactic and the hypotactic. That is what he means when he says that "in Hblderlin the poetic movement upsets for the first time the category of meaning. "12 Paratax- is undermines syntax in that it ignores the synthetic possibilities of its para- digm. It is Adorno's contention that, in the paratactic countermovement to the syntactic production of meaning, language does not lead "beyond the subject" but rather speaks "for the subject . . . which can no longer speak (Holderlin was probably the first whose art had some idea of this) from out of itself." 11.

The paratactic sequence of mythic elements in the last strophe of "Mnemosyne" is a case in point. In Benjamin's formulation, on which both Adorno and Szondi rely, "Men, the Heavenly, and princes" seem to "fall head- long out of their old orders into sheer contiguity [zueinander gereiht]."'3 The fall out of the old orders into metonymic arbitrariness, that is, from the syntax of the order of things into the parataxis of a text that no longer represents the order of things, is in "Mnemosyne" no fall of figures and names but of texts whose wreckage results in a ghostly afterimage of that which was once to be epically remembered as myth. Pausanias's description of the ruins of "Elev- tera," whose name is superimposed on the "fields of Mnemosyne" as handed down from Hesiod, is the allegory suited to this state of affairs: already in antiquity the "city of Mnemosyne" was a ruin. "Elevteri" ("freedom") sig- nifies with extreme irony what remains to be deciphered as the cultural trace in mythic nature. Of this Benjamin's statement holds true: "On the face of nature 'History' is written in the ciphers of the vanishing past."'4 History itself has become unreadable. Or rather it remains readable only as an allegory of its unreadability. In one of Hdlderlin's fragments, the problematic of which will not be quickly exhausted by our reading, we find first a speculative, then a rhetorical definition of the lyric: "The lyrical and, according to sensuous appearance [dem Schein nach], ideal poem is naive in its meaning. It is a continuous metaphor of one feeling."''5 In the rhetorical concept still common in Hold- erlin's day (the continua metaphora of Quintilian), the lyrical poem is con- ceived of as an allegory whose coherence guarantees the unity of a single feeling. Since the lyrical poem is, in Holderlin's definition, the ideal poem according to sensuous appearance and is naive in its meaning, this allegory elevates a naive meaning to the appearance of the ideal. In the tendency of the late hymns, as interpreted by Szondi, the ideal appearance of the "art char- acter" (Kunstcharakter) of the poem turns naive: the lyrical poem becomes epic. The naive "ground" (Grund), however, turns heroic: wrath becomes mourning. Yet this last turn, according to Hblderlin's last verse, fails. The naive meaning of the unity of one feeling of wrath, whose extended metaphor brings about within the allegory of the poem the ideal appearance of epic, refuses to be recast into the heroic meaning of mourning. "Allegories," we read in Allegories of Reading, "are always allegories of metaphor and, as such, they are always allegories of the impossibility of reading."''6 In the extended meta- 13.

The "met- aphor" of wrath ("tenor") remains unreadable as metaphor ("vehicle") of the naive "art character" ("epic") and, as such, its lyrical development becomes the allegory of a failure. Mimetic affinity with the anger of the hero ("distantly divining with the other") turns into "mimetic affinity with death," the death of Mnemosyne.17 The extreme radicalization of the third version of "Mnemosyne" occurs in the shift from the "wild courage" and "divine force" of heroes, which was the subject of the previous versions, to the death of memory itself, Mnemosyne: "From her also/The powers of evening came to sever a lock of hair." Holderlin communicates this unheard-of event, which is something entirely his own, in the words in which another modem author, Schiller, translates another an- cient author, Virgil. Beissner discovered the wording in the later version of Schiller's "Dido," dating from 1803, the same year as "Mnemosyne." In the context of the story of Dido, the undoing of the tresses ("Losen der Locken") as well as the laying down of the cloak have romantic overtones that associate the tragic Liebestod with the consummation of the love act: "it pounds together," as Empson remarks of Keats's "Ode on Melancholy," "the sensations of joy and sorrow till they combine into sexuality."18 In "Mnemosyne," this move- ment is recalled and reversed. Its lyrical tone, through the epicization of the poem from the Iliad to the Aeneid, is colored "naive" in order to let it fail "sentimentally." The romantic possibility that would draw from melancholy a temporary pleasure (one which Keats pushes to the extreme) is here rejected. The final incapacity of mourning is made manifest by the death of Mnemo- syne. The compulsion to die, which in the epic was the necessity of the hero's death (thus the preceding versions from classical texts), confirms after this unheard-of death of Mnemosyne yet another necessity. In de Man's reading, the sentence "but he must nevertheless [die]" "holds just as well for the neces- sity of the turning back upon oneself."19 Yet this necessity now lacks pos- sibility: the ability to mourn. It is interesting that Holderlin takes the death of Mnemosyne, which cannot be quoted from any text, from the mouth of someone who, for him, was not just another poet. His disillusion with Schiller is followed by his adapta- tion of Rousseau: "the 'one' designated in these lines ["when someone has failed to recollect himself"I can be none other than Rousseau."20 The formula- tion is contradictory, however, for this "one" is no one in the quoted passage 17.

In the phrase "to re-collect oneself" (sich zusammennehmen) "re-collection" happily entails a prior "col- lection" (Sammlung), which Holderlin interpreted as "preservation" (Scho- nung).2l Holderlin almost quotes the strophe of his Rhine hymn dedicated to Rousseau: "But he whose soul, like yours, Rousseau,/Ever strong and pa- tient/Became invincible. . . . " This recalls Rousseau's fifth Reverie: "Mais s'il est un etat oui l'ame trouve une assiette assez solide pour s'y reposer tout entiere et rassembler la tout son etre, sans avoir besoin de rappeler le passe ni d'enjamber sur l'avenir ... "122 There is, indeed, no critique of Rousseau in Holderlin's adaptation just as there is not so much a critique in his allusion to Schiller as a farewell to lost hopes. But the image of Rousseau survives merely as an image and functions in "Mnemosyne" only as a quotation, as an instance of heavenly anger ("Unwillen") against which there is no appeal. The ability of the Heavenly to be angry is what disqualifies the wrath of the poet. What remains to the poet, who had identified himself with the wrath of Achilles and now faces the destiny of Ajax, is only a final remark, the coda "dem gleich fehlet die Trauer." The failure of appropriation that manifests itself in the remembrance of the Greeks nevertheless practices a "self-recollection" within the text. The result of this recollection, however, loses that which is collected. "Der Grubler," we read in Benjamin's fragments, "dessen Blick, aufgeschreckt, auf das Bruchstuck in seiner Hand fallt, wird zum Allegoriker."23 Lost in melan- choly, the brooder turns allegoric, when all of a sudden he realizes that the piece in his hand is a fragment. Likewise, in epicization Holderlin's poem suddenly realizes the fragmentary condition of the lyric. Epic parataxis does not reconstitute the epic but rather collects the fragments of its appropriation. The allegorical coherence of "Mnemosyne" consists in this metonymic ac- cumulation of its parts that does not represent the myth itself so much as its loss in the process of appropriation. This poem is itself only in so far as it presents others as itself. III "There always are at least two texts, regardless of whether they are actually written out or not," Paul de Man writes in one of his last texts.24 This other text, which is presupposed and implied by "Mnemosyne," is entitled "An- 21.

"Anthropomorphism and Trope," RR, 260-61.</page><page sequence="9">246 Yale French Studies denken." As Baudelaire's "Obsession" can be called a reading of "Correspon- dences," so Holderlin's "Mnemosyne" can be called a reading of "Andenken." This reading, though, cannot be conceived of in terms of intertextuality. Nei- ther can it be traced in the text as quotation or allusion. In other words, the one text does not represent the other. Rather, one can say that the one "under- stands" the other. De Man does not hesitate to use this hermeneutic metaphor of understanding, for it is the metaphor of hermeneutics par excellence. He specifies this relation between texts in terms of the lyric, in which it manifests itself as "specular symmetry along an axis of assertion and negation (to which correspond the generic images of the ode, as celebration, and the elegy, as mourning)." Celebration and mourning, then, are for him the two alternative modes (as far as genres are concerned) of the lyric that itself "is not a genre, but one name among several to designate the defensive motion of understanding, the possibility of a future hermeneutics." "Mnemosyne" thus reads and "un- derstands" "Andenken" in mourning. The death of Mnemosyne exhausts the possibilities of the lyric in that it grounds the impossibility of reading in the inability of mourning. As a motif, this death is not comparable with the van- ishing of the muses that made such an excellent pretext for lyrical melancholy from the pastoral to the elegiac odes of Holderlin's predecessors in the Got- tinger Hain.25 Without memory and the defensive abilities of understanding ("to re-collect oneself"), there is no possibility left for a future hermeneutics. Holderlin interpretation, especially under Heidegger's imprimatur, has seen the close relation of "Andenken" and "Mnemosyne" more in terms of celebration than of mourning and has consequently identified in "Mnemo- syne" not the anticlimax ("regression") of "Andenken" but its climax ("inten- sification"). This was possible under the motto "where danger is, salvation also grows": the threatening death of Mnemosyne increases the salvific poten- tial of remembrance.26 Such may have been a possible interpretation of the earlier versions of Holderlin's poem, but in the third version the death of Mnemosyne appears always already completed. This prior completion is what Henrich aptly formulated as the difference between Hegel and Hblderlin: "For Hegel, to remember [Erinnern] is always to transform: interiorization [Er-in- nerung] as the overcoming of the past's being-in-itself.... For Holderlin, on the contrary, memory is a preserving [Bewahrenj that stands under the claim to be true to the past and hence seeks and maintains the past in its own right."27 The mythic organ of interiorization in Hegel is the epic singer whose "pathos is not the stupefying power of nature, but Mnemosyne, recollection [Besinnung] and developed inwardness, the interiorization [Erinnerung] of the once imme- diate essence."28 Being true to this no longer immediate essence turns the 25.

De Man speaks of a "transformation of trope into anthropomorphism" that defines the lyric "as the instance of represented voice." It is the Nietzschean, deconstructive point of this performance that de Man recognizes: "Anthropomorphism seems to be the illusionary resuscitation of the natural breath of language, frozen into stone by the semantic power of the trope."29 The frozen allegory-which crumbles under the melancholic gaze of the author into fragments of intertex- tual references-restores no epic muse. At best, parataxis mimetically recalls epic "naivete" without yet, in this remembrance of the epic, being able to compensate for the loss of the natural breath of the lyric. "Why on earth should a 'lyrically' interiorizing recollection [Zuruck- denkenj culminate in a peak performance [Gipfelwort] like the closing remark of the poem 'Andenken'?" asks Heidegger, who has little interest in mere backwardness:30 "Was bleibet aber, stiften die Dichter" ["But what is lasting the poets provide"-Hamburger;] ["But poets establish what remains"-Si- eburth.] Like the last line of "Mnemosyne," the last line of "Andenken" needs close examination. What remains might be lasting, but the question is where do the poets come in? The answer "Mnemosyne" provides does not establish what Heidegger is thinking of. "For the promise of Heidegger's ontology to be realized," de Man observes, "Hdlderlin must be Icarus returned from his flight."31 Though the myth leaves no doubt that Icarus actually flew, it is equally certain that he never returned. The relation between "Andenken" and "Mnemosyne" displays a perfect symmetry between open "assertion" and complete "negation." "Was bleibet" ("Andenken") remains on account of the poets. What they establish, however, remains doubtful since on and by their own account the mourning is missing: "fehlet die Trauer" ("Mnemosyne"). The remembrance that "Andenken" provides indeed reminds us of Icarus's flight: "memory is engendered as an act of consciousness freed from the re- strictions of time and space, but entirely contained in the original, material perception." Commenting further on the opening stanza of "Andenken," de Man refers to another famous line: "Memories originate out of perception 'as flowers originate' ["Brot and Wein"J."32 Like the classical topos of inspiration in the first strophe ("The north-easterly blows,/Of winds the dearest to me"), so also the flower metaphor ("as flowers originate") belongs to tradition-the former to poetic, the latter to rhetorical tradition, the historical coupling of which de Man describes as a relation between anthropomorphism and trope. The north-easterly breeze revitalizes, in an illusionary resuscitation, the natu- ral breath of language, frozen into the semantic flowers of the trope. In an open critique of Heidegger, de Man characterizes the lyrical illu- 29. "Anthropomorphism and Trope," op. cit., 247. 30.

[For Holderlin,I it manifests itself above all as a nostalgia for the world of the Greeks that we conceive (wrongly) as a world founded on the ontological priority of the sensuous object."33 The philosoph- ical point is perhaps less important than the poetical one stemming from this "fundamental error." Yet neither the anthropomorphism of "Andenken" nor its deconstruction in "Mnemosyne" can be accounted for in terms of error. "How does it happen," we read in a recent essay assessing a similar constella- tion of authors and texts, "that in such divergent and, indeed, mutually con- flicting commentaries as those by Heidegger, Adorno, and Szondi (I deliber- ately give Benjamin a place apart) the same privilege finds itself attached to the lyric-and, as a consequence, the same interest is shown in the 'last' great poems of Hblderlin-where the critic goes about the task seeking that which is, indeed, inscribed there, that is to say, a thought?"34 What Lacoue-Labarthe calls "the caesura of the speculative" is exactly what is at stake in the symme- try between "Andenken" and Mnemosyne." What was thought of in "An- denken" as the unmediated origin of remembrance out of perception remains in "Mnemosyne" an inaccessible past that the wanderer, "distantly divining," pursues. The anthropomorphism of the lyric, as "the instance of represented voice," names in "Mnemosyne" yet another anthropomorphism, the voice of which it fails to represent. What is represented, however, is the voice of the lyric in its mimetic failure to represent the epic. In this case, the "caesura" in question is not an allegorical self-signification of representation but the mel- ancholy of an allegorical failure.35 Once "the melancholy of the muses" in Burton's Anatomy had been su- perseded by the invocation of the "Muse Melancholia," melancholy became the very anthropomorphism of the lyric. Next to irony, which has been taken since Quintilian's double definition as both trope and state of mind (Socrates being its personification), melancholy becomes the predominant anthropo- morphism of trope. "Mnemosyne" is not an allegory of the lyric; rather it shows the latter in the state of melancholy. The death of Mnemosyne reduces melancholy to its allegorical denominator. It inscribes, to recall Benjamin's image, "Allegory" on the face of this anthropomorphism. Under the sign of Allegory, reading remains melancholy and does not meet the condition of "true" mourning. The anthropomorphic "tenor" of this allegory proves, as de Man emphasizes, that "the possibility of anthropomorphic (mis)reading is part of the text and part of what is at stake in it."36 33.

The damage, which the subject does not simply sustain but experiences in its narcissistic constitution, is part of what "one calls one's character" (Freud). As such, "instincts and their vicissitudes" rearrange the associated commonplaces of "character and fate" (Benjamin).37 "If the object becomes allegorical under the gaze of melancholy, " writes Benjamin, "this gaze lets life flow from it; consequently, it remains as a dead, though eternally secured object lying before the allegorical poet, at the mercy of his grace and disfavor [Gnade und Ungnadej."38 The psychoanalytical hypothesis of the narcissistic constitution of the subject on the model of internalized objects finds its ba- roque point in Benjamin's observation that the melancholic gaze presupposes, even entails, the death of the contemplated object in order to save it eternally and thereby achieve salvation for the subject as well. The "realism," in fact, "anthropomorphism" in Freud's concept of narcissism (whose mythical ana- logue is Lacan's "mirror stage") has its historical paradigm in Benjamin's de- scription of baroque melancholy. Benjamin's claim that the object of melan- cholic contemplation can be none other than the melancholy man himself corresponds to narcissistic "regression" in which "identification with the ob- ject becomes a substitute for the erotic cathexis."39 The identification here is basically an introjection that interiorizes its objects. Indifferent before the eye of the melancholic, objects are left behind, outside, dead. One can certainly not say though that Holderlin, of whose late, almost baroque phase Benjamin speaks, succumbs to baroque melancholy. On the contrary, it is his resistance to melancholy-his mourning, to be more pre- cise-that leads him "beyond the subject." "In the late hymns," Adorno con- tinues in the passage already quoted, "subjectivity is not the absolute and not the ultimate. It is understood rather to commit a sacrilege in which it imposes itself as if it were absolute and ultimate, all the while following an inner logic of self-positing. This is the construction of hubris in Holderlin."40 The sacri- lege of hubristic subjectivity is the anthropomorphism of the lyrical "I" that invokes objects the interiorization (Erinnerung) of which follows the logic of melancholic self-positing. "There is no trace of hubris in Holderlin and Keats, " 37. Sigmund Freud, Das Ich und das Es (1923), Studienausgabe, 1-10 (Frankfurt: Fischer, 1969-79), 3: 296.

The second strophe had opened with a question: "Wie aber Liebes? " [ "But how loving?"] The sentence is simpler than the translation permits it to be (both Hamburger and Sieburth miss the point). For here Holderlin presupposes the syntactic construction of a statement with which the first strophe had ended and which is thus put into question in the second: "es ereignet sich aber/Das Wahre" ["what is true is what is bound to take place"-de Man.J42 With this syntactic construction in mind, the question at the beginning of the second strophe reads as a question of whether love is bound to take place. Where, in the first strophe, we read "das Wahre" as the asserted truth, in the second strophe we read "Liebes" as a loving in question. Under the banner of this question, Holderlin's wanderer walks along the heights of the Alps, the boundary to the Greek south. "Distantly divining with the other," he identi- fies with his hero in wrath. In his "Remarks on Oedipus," Holderlin treated wrath as the moment of identification in tragedy that, as a limitless unification of God and man, inner and outer nature, is to be purified by "limitless separa- tion."43 The wrath of the wanderer is motivated by the compulsion to achieve such a limitless unification, yet is simultaneously characterized by the futility of this striving. This wrath is no longer the result of a naive identification with the hero but rather is dominated by the failure of this compulsion to imitate. Just as Dante's wanderer succumbs, in a momentary identification, to Frances- ca's seductive talent, a weakness that completes itself in a mimetic swoon, so Holderlin's wanderer is overwhelmed by the wrath of his hero Achilles. The loss of the first figure of identification leaves him with the role of "the second best Achaean, " Ajax.44 For the latter was not only second after Achilles, but moreover was one who already had failed in the attempt to replace Achil- les' "actual surrogate and alter ego," Patroklos, who had died "in the King's own armour." Ajax is the negative reflection of Achilles as Patroklos is the positive. He fails to occupy the place of Achilles, both in the role of the first among heroes and in his coveted armor, which he loses to Odysseus. The anger of Ajax, which does not match the wrath of Achilles but remains limited to its imitation, turns into ridiculous madness when he-caricature of the wrathful hero-mistakes a flock of sheep for the enemy army. 41.

Indeed, it was more the question of the mother than the father that was crucial for Holderlin's own fate, which, after Di- otima's death, in "Mnemosyne" "expresses a despair beyond despair-that is, that state of mind which, so it seems, allows only for suicide or massive schizophrenic disintegration and retreat."46 The psychological diagnosis has here a significance that is not external to the text. It draws our attention to a structure similar to a double bind that links the impossible appropriation of the Greeks with their impossible representation and impossible mourning. "Dem gleich fehlet die Trauer" represents this double bind that the reader seeks to circumvent only to succumb to it all the more certainly. While com- plaining about errors in mourning, the reader lacks its representation to the same extent that he denies it. In this case, the meaning of representation is determined by a repetition "on the receiving end." If there is "a fundamental division in the writer's mind," such as Empson claims for his seventh type of ambiguity, it is represented in the text only to the extent that it is reenacted in the reader's mind.47 The anthropomorphism of the represented voice has as its echo the anthropomorphism of the reader's response, i.e. his "subjectivity." V Melencholia illa heroics, an expression by Melanchthon that Benjamin takes as emblematic, suits Holderlin even better than Baudelaire.48 In heroism vis-a- vis melancholy, though not yet to the extent of spleen, Holderlin is as close to Baudelaire as the difference between "Andenken" ("Remembrance") and "souvenirs" ["memories"I permits. His heroic measure lies not in the identifi- cation with the wrath of the hero but in the endurance of an impossible mourn- ing.49 In the impossibility of this mourning, remembrance reflects the traces of interiorization that the narcissistic erection of the other as hero has left be- hind. It is marked through mnenic signs the encounter of which triggers vain feelings: "the cross which once was placed/There on the wayside for the dead" 45.

The equivalent of this cross (crux) in the epic is the figtree, in which ancient and Christian tradition (anamnesis and anagogy) intersect in the man- ner of a chiasmus: the cross stands for the death of this life, while the figtree is the reminder of a promised afterlife (for which various passages in the New Testament could be cited). In the second strophe of "Andenken" the figtree is set apart from the other trees: "But in the courtyard a figtree grows." Sattler, who reads all these trees as memorials (the oak tree for Klopstock, a silver poplar for Heinse), identifies the figtree as Diotima, whose destiny has fulfilled itself in its sign. ("I will be" are her last words in Hyperion. )50 The examples are problematic in detail, but it is not difficult to derive from them the figtree as a double sign for Achilles and Diotima, hero and beloved. It is noteworthy that in the case of this hero the incommensurable wrath is inflamed by the loss of his beloved (Briseis), at which point his mother comes to his aid (a mother whose absence Holderlin bewails in the elegy "Achill"). Hence the figtree in "Mnemosyne" seems to stand as echo of that which is remembered in "Andenken" but is in fact the cross. The sign of death is not simply replaced by the sign of promise. On the contrary, this other sign is reminiscent of the failure of another remembrance, but this reminiscence fails as well. If the figtree in "Andenken" triggers recollection, then it stands in "Mnemosyne" also for the impossibility of this recollection (the symmetry of assertion and negation mentioned above). The symbol of the beloved gets absorbed into the sign of the hero whose futile imitation had made her a symbol and caused her death. The promise is cancelled by death; death is not overcome by promise. In representing the failure of interiorization (Erin- nerung), the figtree signifies mourning. The grave of the failed hero in "Mne- mosyne" becomes a sign of mourning for the lost beloved outside the poem. She does not lack mourning, nor is the poet at fault. "Ein Zeichen sind wir, deutungslos/Schmerzlos sind wir und haben fast/Die Sprache in der Fremde verloren." ["A sign we are, without interpreta- tion/Without pain we are and have nearly/Lost our language in foreign lands."I The third and last version of the third strophe of "Mnemosyne" still presup- poses this first strophe of the second version (the third version of the first strophe being of a later date). What remains of our language is signs without interpretation. What the poets establish is not interpretation but the assurance that the signs remain. "Stiften," etymologically, suggests the "stiffening" of the sign.51 What does not remain, what is dismissed, on the other hand, is the anger and pain transmitted by interpretation. The transmission occurs in an echo-mentioned by Holderlin in the same strophe (second version) as the lines quoted above-an echo that characterizes the relation between mortals 50. Dietrich E.

The echo is the perfect allegory of divine anthropomorphism. It does not answer, but sounds like an answer: it is "a 'delusion' of the signifier."52 What leads Holderlin "beyond subjectivity" is the deconstruction of the human as echo, of lyrical subjectivity as anthropomorphism. The death of Mnemosyne, therefore, is no end. The sentence of Hesiod's Theogony that calls her the mother of the muses also gives the latter's part of the story. It is the opposite of their mother's name, "lesmosyne": "the forgetting of ills and a cessation of anxieties. "53 The death of mnemosyne thus dissolves the effort of lesmosyne and brings a return of the repressed: a qualification of signs as symptoms rather than symbols, traces rather than tropes.
