<plain_text><page sequence="1">PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS C. SlVARAMAMURTI Brother and Sister Delegates, It is extremely kind of you to have chosen me for presiding over the Ancient Indian History Section. While I am most grateful to you for this, I am well aware of my shortcomings. As scholars like you, even as the Hansa, always accept the essential good and reject the residue, I request you to lend ear to a few words I have to say in inaugurating the proceedings of this section. India is a great and glorious country. It has a rich heritage of great antiquity. A scholar has to be born over and over again to touch even a fringe of her noble culture. The history of this vast land is a long and interesting epic too huge to be covered in a few pages or in a limited range of time. Hundreds of scholars have been and still are working to unravel the mysteries and solve several pro- blems in the story of our country. The achievements so far have always delighted everyone in the field and goaded them on to further devoted study and research. Nothing is more welcome to a scholar than encouraging results in research and a better knowledge of facts. In understanding the history of the land, political events, dyna- stic history, fixing of dates, locating of eras and other problems have, no doubt, a great part to play. But it is the cultural history of the country that calls for greater attention to understand the genius of the nation - a panorama of the culture of the people, their ideals and their aspirations. In understanding the culture from period to period, we have wonderful evidence in that remarkable citadel of our culture located in every village of our vast country - the temple. The life of man was in accordance with Dharma . All they did was influenced by Dharma . When vote by ballot decided the election of members for a Sabhã or Council, the announcement of the result was at the village temple where the election itself was held. The epigraphical and sculptural wealth that our great temples offer for the study of history and</page><page sequence="2">22 INDIAN HISTORY CONGRESS - 1957 culture is immense. Together with the literary, numismatic and other material and folk traditions that survive almost to this day they offer a glimpse of how deep-rooted our cultural heritage has been. The Nāļyasāstra of Bharata with its written commentary by Abhinavagupta from Kashmir has a sculptural commentary dating from the 2nd century B.C. at Bhārhut, the 2nd century A.D. at Amarāvatī and the most elaborate with legends in Chola Grantha characters describing the several sthānas , karaņas and aftgaharas in the numerous panels adorning the gopuras at Chidambaram. An inscription mentioning the verse 44 Sarvamangalamãngalye sive sarvãr- thasãdhake , Ś ar any e tryambike devi nãrãyani namostułe " from Devlmã- hãtmya of Mãrkandeya Puräna shows us that it is definitely earlier than the 7th century. Šankara's line from Bhajagovinda in the plates of Chāhamāna Ratnapāla shows the spiritual influence of the great ãchãrya even in the sphere of epigraphy. The Cambodian inscription mentioning Šivasoma as a disciple of Bhagavatpāda Śańkaracharya shows the tremendous expansion of spiritual and cultural influence to distant lands at no distant date from the time of the propagation of Advaita by the great philospher. The occurrence of the Süryasataka on a fragmentary pillar of a Süryamandapa trom Kānchīpurum shows how even in the 10th century A.D. Mayüra's work was given a very high place, being inscribed in Chola Grantha characters in the Surya temple itself most prominently. The occurrence of the line of the opening verse of the Rãmãyana in an inscription of the 4th century A.D. from the Krishna valley - the Mattepād plates of Dāmodaravaman - shows how profound was the influence of Vālmīki in the early centuries of the Christian era, of which we have other instances in the Girnār inscription of Rudradāman and the Mahākūta inscription of Mańgaleśa. In the latter record samudra ivà gambhīrah is quoted from the Ädikavi. The Mahākūta inscription with the well-known lines from Kãlidãsa and similar incorporations from other authors in inscrip- tions not only help us in ascertaining the date of these works, but also point to the profound literary atmosphere assimilating the ideas of great Mahākavis and their kãvyas in which even the daily transactions of normal life at the court and elsewhere were effected. The ideals of the kings have been beautifully laid down in the birudas that they have chosen and engraved with great care not only on their several monuments but also on the coins they have issued. Even here, very often, the influence of the epics is clearly perceptible, such terms like saty apar àkr ama, samudra iva , gambhīrah , ekadhanur - dhara , bhīmakānta , dharmavijayī9 éãstradrishti , unnatachcha , kuladhvaja , etc., are indications of great ideals. The glorious coin series of the</page><page sequence="3">ANCIENT INDIA 23 Guptas has happy legends that present a glowing picture of the great achievements of this line. Never vanquished, always victorious and triumphant on earth here below, they gain victory even over heaven by their meritorious deeds. The horse, as the principal limb of the Ašvamedha sacrifice as Kālidāsa would put it, and imprinted on the coin, suggests the triumph of the king over all others. It is presented in sculpture by the Asvamedha horse in stone, and immortalised after the performance of this great Kratu . It is interesting to compare with this, the several inscriptions mentioning this sacrifice as having been performed by rulers of different dynasties; and in the context of the Hirahadagalli plates of ¡Šivaskandavaman recounting them, to recall the several sculptural scenes of the Asvamedha and other sacrifices in the long series of episodes from Paliava history narrated in a visual presentation of a gallary with lables here and there to throw light on them as we find in the Vaikuņthanātha temple in Kānchī. We have a similar story presented as 'History through Sculpture ' in the famous temple at Koņārak where the great builder Narasimha of the Eastern Garīga dynasty has been presented over and over again in different attitudes in several carvings all of which open our eyes to understand thirteenth century Orissa and magnificence of the remarkable ruler who was responsible for one of the greatest monuments that India has produced. Narasimha as a patron of letters carved in a panel recalls literary descriptions. As Rājasekhara describes in his Kãvyamímãmsã , it is only a king who was a poet himself and appriciative of good poetry that could create and foster a band of eminent poets : " Rãjã kavih kavisamājam vidadhita , rãjani kavan lokah kāvis syã9' And it is a king of this creative power, a poet in the Vidvat goshthi , that Vidyânâtha describes in the Kâkatïya realm, or as we know from the court of Harshavardhana where Bana as muse incarnate immortalised his great patron in his unique historical work the Harshacharita ; or again as we can imagine from the poetic expres- sions and suggestions from the birudas of the author of Mattavilãsa , Mahendravarman of Kānchī ; or perennial darling of Sanskrit muse, Bhoja of Dhãrã who can never be forgotten as long as the language of the gods lives on earth for all that he did as legends put it in the words of scholarly bards that cherished his memory in a manner that far surpasses the greatness of the glorious Bhojasālā associated with his name from which probably came the famous image of Sarasvati with its inscriptions on the pedestal suggesting it as so enshrined by Bhoja and now in the British Museum. Even so the sculpture from Koņārak proclaims the ruler of the land as a great patron of literature. The coin Rüpäkriti of Chandragupta II vividly presents the king as a great rasika and sahridaya. His love for music, suggested in the viņā type of coin of Samudragupta, is confirmed in the Allāhābād inscription of the king describing him as excelling even Tumburu and Nārad in his skill.</page><page sequence="4">24 INDIAN HISTORY CONGRESS - 1957 At Khajuraho, there are several panels depicting royal processions and scenes from contemporary life which still remain to be studied for understanding the glory of the Chandellas at the height of their power. In the time of the great Emperor Aśoka, the story of Māndhātā must have been so popular that in the desire for suzerainty after the break-up of the empire, the floating thought of the single umbrella is lovingly portrayed times without number. The Mandhātu Jātaka, which has a universal monarch as its theme, shows him with the right hand raised and the wheel of power and righteousness moving in front of him to triumph over several spheres of the earth and proceeding to heaven to occupy a part of even the throne of Indra. It is this umbrella and fly whisks that is so often shown even later in the chhatra and chamara on coins as the paraphernalia of sovereignty over the emblems of the several dynasties like the boar of the Chalukyas, the fish of the Pãndyas, the tiger of the Cholas and so forth. The Guptas went one step further and made the goddess of royal prosperity hold the chamara for the King, just as in the coin of Zeonises of the Indo-Parthian series, the goddess of the city of the vanquished chooses the victor as her lord in the svayamvara fashion throwing the garland on his neck. These factors were triumphantly announced in some com- memorative coins in which history is imprinted with great gusto, e.g., Narasimha, the victor of vātāpi who styled himself Vātāpikoņda in an inscription at Badāmi itself to commemorate his victory. The Chola Emperor Rājendra whose greatest achievement was the bringing of the Ganges water to his newly chosen capital at Gangaikoņda- choļapuram, named after his conquest, issued coins to commemorate this event ; and in his Tiruvālangadu plates, he mentions how as a Kshatriya he brought Ganges water by his military prowess and not by penance like his ancestor Bhagïratha. Coins with the legend Malainādukoņda, Talakādugoņda, Noļambarādigoņda etc., continue this tradition. The great ideal of dharmayuddha and dharmavijaya such as we read in literature and which Kālidāsa mentions in the context of Raghu's conquest of the princes of the various quarters by styling himself dharmavijayî , establishing only his supermacy and returning the kingdoms to the vanquished, is studied in History through such interesting legends on coins as Kachchivalangum perumal com- emorating Sunedra Pandy a' s conquest of Kānchī and the returning of the territory to the defeated Chola ruler.</page><page sequence="5">ANCIENT INDIA 25 Dharmayudda is graphically presented in sculpture at Amara vati where an elephant rider fights with a soldier on an elephant, a horseman with another cavalier, a chariotier with his opponent in a chariot and a foot soldier with his equal. This is a rare and revealing sculpture showing the high ideals of warfare where Kütayuddha or unfair fight was abhorred. A simple sculpture like a small one from the Indian Museum, wherein Harihara in the centre is flanked by Buddha and Surya, all in a single piece, almost by the proximity of its date to the Banskhera plates of Harsh avardhana, acts as a commentary to a state of thought amongst the most cultured and distinguished where toleration in reli- giös faith of the greatest magnitude existed, and it was possible in one family for the father to be a Paramâdityabhakta, a mother to be from a line of Paramabhãgavata, the eldest son to be Paramasaugata and the younger one to be a Paramamāhesvara. A sculpture with the Pañchayatana from Bihar shows the pro- found influence of Śankara over Pañchayatana worship which is still a guiding factor in the pūjā of Advaitins amongst Smārtas in the south ; and it is no wonder that in this context we should understand the great religious tolerance of Rāj arāja Chola who made magnificent gifts of villages to, and encouraged the establishment of , the Buddhist Monast- ery at Nāgapattiņam even as his sister Kundavai endowed a Jaina insti- tution, while both of them were greatly devoted to Śiva; and this brings to our mind the instance of the Vijayanagar monarch who brought about peace between Vaishņavas and Jains by requesting his own Rājaguru literally to shake hands in friendship with the Jaina preceptor. This also reminds us of how Akbar received Hira Suri with great reverence as narrated in the Hírasaubhãgya. The inscriptions recording the wars between dynasties do not by themselves give complete details of the glory or defeat of several rulers, nor do they present the full picture of the culture of the period only by themselves. They have, in fact, to be understood in the light of other and very interesting evidence by way of architecture, sculpture and painting. Motifs found in one place or repeated in other places where they could not normally be expected have their own story to tell. The southern type of vimãna at Pattadakal with the inscriptions in the Mallikārjuna temple narrates as much a story of Vikramadityas admiration for the skill of the sculptors and architects from Kānchī whom he patronised as propably the Varāha and other panels at Mahābalipuram in the wake of Narasimhavarman's conquest of Badami. Similarly the Kailāsa temple at Ellora with its definite southern mode of vimãna has a similar story to give. The bearded Brahmā at Gangaikoņ dach oļapuram is the only one of its kind in</page><page sequence="6">26 INDIAN HISTORY CONGRESS - 1957 South India where the normal youthful deva type of the god of crea- tion is the norm quite unlike the aged, bearded pitõhama type found in Northern India. This representation has again to be understood in the context of Rājendra Cholá's appreciation of art forms in the country he vanquished, but the cultural glory of which overwhelmed him. His creation of the novel Navagraha at Gangaikoņdachoļapuram can be understood only by studying the northern and southern forms of the planets and the Gupta Pillar Capital showing the planets in the Gwalior Museum ; and the whole history of this transformation of ideas in later centuries may further be studied in Kakatiya and later sculpture. ^ The pr found influence of the Varāha concept and »the raising of Prithvi from the ocean so graphically presented at Udayagiri near Vidiáã in the Gupta period has not only created masterpieces at Badami and Mahābalipuram, not to speak of several other numerous such representations all over, but also resulted even in portraying the ideal of the king to be a veritable varāha to raise the fallen state of his royal glory with its earthly possessions to dizzy heights, as found imprinted on the Ādivarāha coin of the powerful emperor Mihira Bhoja. History in suggestion is to be read in the significant symbols and imprints on coins like those of Yajña Šātakarņi with his juvenile portrait adorned with sidelojks on the obverse and four symbols on the reverse of his coin proclaiming the travel of his fame suggested by a crescent climbing the mountain, crossing the ocean, going to the netherworld and reaching heaven - symbols so appealing and easily understood with the help of Kālidāsa's verse des- cribing Raghu s glory that even later monarchs successively made it a point to use them like the Kshatrapas and the Traikutakas. Numerous inscriptions mentioning in part the mahamantra from the Mahãbhãrata " namo brahmanyadeväya gobrãhmana hitãya cha " have visual representation of this thought of the period. In coins represen- ting the Kãmadhenu, Kalpa vriksha and pürnakumbha as Lakshmi not only the most auspicious symbols but also the form of the goddess of prosperity herself, Lakshmi and Rãjyalakshmi, Jayalakshmi and Gajalakshmi, royal prosperity as described in Rudradāman's inscription, as righteous wealth overflowing in his treasury, is presented to the world in a subtle way. In one of the Kuninda coins, Lakshmi, Kama- dhenu and the Śrivatsa symbol are presented together, suggesting at once the symbolic, zoomorphic and anthropomorphic form of the deity. In a cast tribal coin, the Kamadhenu and the purriakumbha are imprinted on obverse and reverse. In coins from Mathurā and in Sātavāhana coins Lakshmi and the Kalpavriksha are shown associated. There are</page><page sequence="7">ANCIENT INDIA 27 other tribal coins where the glory of the cow is presented with great force. It is immortalised by the sculptor in the oft-repeated scene of Govardhanadhara which happened to become a great theme in Indian art of which splendid examples exist not only in the early art from Māņdor in Rājasthān and in the Gupta piece from Bañaras but also in the Vishņukuņdin sculpture from Mogalrāj apuram, the glorious Govar- dhana frieze from Mahābalipuram, the panel from Ellora and the too numerous representations from all over. The theme of Amritamanthan became such a great favourite that the Gupta panel from the entrance of the cave at Udayagiri was repeated not only in Western Chãlukyan, Kãkatiya and other schools of Art but travelled beyond the shores of India and created a stir as it were by its magnificence as a complete architectural lay out of the temple plan at Ankor Thom, the temple itself conceived as Mt. Mandara and the entire surroundings as the milky ocean. Themes in art like the Dvãrapãla , Šivagaņas, Kumbhandayakshas, Vidyâdharas, Kinnaras, Asvamukhis and various other forms as motifs in architecture and sculpture have their own story to tell of their power in overwhelming by their charm and beauty the hearts of conquering dynasties of kings from region to region. The Dvãrapãla from Kalyani with his club entwined by a snake swallowing a rat with a cat watching in the vicinity, suggesting the superior nãgabala of the reptile over weaker foes like rats and c its, symbolises the dominence of the Chãlukyas over their adversaries. The Chola monarch was so impressed by the beauty of this Chalukya figure that he not only brought it home as war trophy after his conquest of Kalyani, the capital of the Chãlukyas, but also got his own sculptor to improve the idea by making the snake mightier and capable of swallowing even an elephant which a lion is watching in its vicinity, thus proclaiming the greater nãgabala of the Chola Emperor Rājendra. Not only do we know by the finds of numerous Roman gold coins of the tremendous commercial intercourse between South India and Rome, but actually sculptures of the early century of the Christian era in the Krishna valley both from Amara vati and Nāgārjunakoņda point to this Roman influence, as it is obvious in several figures and costumes. Similarly the Kushāņ period in the north points to the impact of several strains of foreign culture, and conical caps long coats, high-topped boots and other modes of apparel in sculpture are very significant. It may be interesting to note how the word kañchuki is very significant as only the chamberlain and pageboy wore shirts and none else in the purely indigenous mode of representation. At Deogarh high class dress is suggested in the case of Devaki and</page><page sequence="8">28 INDIAN HISTORY CONGRESS - 1957 Vāsudeva where both wear the antãarlya and the uttariya. In the case of Deváki, the lower garment is āprapadīna up to the ankles and her coiffure is pearl - bedecked - muktãjãlagrathitamalakam, all possible jewels and ornaments being presented in the case of both. For the simple Gopï, the cow herdess, a long kurtā shirt is shown which even today is the normal dress of the women of the Punjab. It is interest- ing to observe that while the skirt is worn by the Gopï, Deváki wears the saree in almost kachchha fashion making it clear that she is a married woman and not a virgin, as dress seems to indicate in the words of the Vidushaka in the Viddhaéãlàbhanjikã where the king, the hero, is re-assured that the statue is that of a virgin and not of a married woman judging from the mode of wear of her dress. The variety of ushņīsha in sculpture is a subject of study in itself, and we may observe in this context that the earliest iconographical forms of deities wear only a turban and not the crown and it helps us to understand and appreciate the kirīfa with reference to the time factor in history. Even at Sanchi, the earliest Indra has only a turban though later he wears a crown. The earliest Sańkarshana in the Lucknow Museum that can be dated in the 2nd Century B. C. has a turban and not a crown. The Gudimallam Śiva has only a turban and a single pair of arms, answering the description of Śiva in the Rudra of the Yajurveda. In this context, it would be most interesting to study the figure of Śiva from Parel as an early concept composed of seven figures in one. This has remained a mystery. I feel that this should be understood as the earliest form of Śiva as the musical Dakshiņāmūrti or Viņādhara Dakshiņāmūrti, as he is known. He is Nãdatanu or Svaramaya Šiva composed of the seven elements of music. We know that Śiva is conceived as a highest Nãtyãchãrya. He is also a great Lord of music being fond of the musical chant of Sãma. His glory is sung in the seven Sãma notes, saptasāmopagītam tram as Kālidāsa puts it. Vedãnãm Sãmavedosmi, says the Bhagavadgītā , and these seven notes of the musical chant of the Veda are presented in the aeven svaras composing the form of Siva. Śiva is also conceived as Yajamâna and Agni. In the Vishņusahasranāma , he is described as kratu or sacrifice. It is this aspect that has been emphasized at Gudimallam. Thus we have Agni and Yajamâna, two of the- ashfamurtis in the Gudimallam form ; and the all-pervading Svara form spreading out all over the panel in the seven figures composing it with the Gaņas below playing musical instruments like the viņā and the flute, suggesting the ãkãsa form of Śiva by its guņa, namely sabda symbolised by the highest form of its heavenly music. The motif of Ganga and Yamuna, which is a constant factor in all Guptā temples on the doorway, is certainly unknown beyond the</page><page sequence="9">ANCIENT INDIA 29 area of Gupta influence. Its presence for the first time as a solitary example in a temple at Biccavolu beyond Rajahmandry calls for a possible explanation and the inscription of the Eastern Châlukya king Guņaga Vijayãditya together with what we know from Western Châlukya history mentioning the triumph of Vinayâditya in the Indo- Gangetic area and his appropriation of the Gańga -Yamuna motif read along with the fact that the Rāshtrakūtas being the political successors of the early Western Châlukyas were equally entitled to it, and the Eastern Châlukya king as victor in battle with the Rāshtrakūtas could equally lay claims to the motif already with the Rāshtrakūtas, brings home to us the cause for the presence of this in the Eastern Châlukya temple of the time at Biccavolu. Ralinga motifs in Eastern Châlukya art show the close touch between these two areas under the rule of the powerful Eastern Châlukya monarchs who attacked Ralinga at various stages. The Chatushshashtiyoginï Temples in Orissa and in Central India and Bundelkhand show the close contact that these regions had. Râjendera's conquest of Ralinga not only brought a Ralinga Gaņesa to the country of the Cholas, though today its significance is forgotten, but also created the form of Lakulisa, a form unknown in the south, in the temple at Tiruvottiyür built by Rājendra which so closely resembles the Lukulīsa at Biccavolu where also the introdu- ction of this form is entirely due to the territorial inclusion of southern Ralinga in the Eastern Châlukya kingdom. It may be interesting in this context of Raliùga history to know that the beautiful Roņārak temple with its magnificent wheels and horse, suggesting the triumphant movement of the Sun God in his chariot drawn by his seven steeds is inspired by the earlier motif of the wheel and horse added to the Vimãna or maņdapa of the Chola Temple in the 12th Century as at Chidambaram and Dārāsuram, and the motif travelled all the way to Ralinga through the source of diplomatic marriages effected in those times between the Cholas and the Châlukyas and the Cholas and the Eastern Gañgas as a result of which Anantavarma Chodagaňgadeva was born to Rājasundarļ the daughter of Rulottunga Chola an offspring of which union was Narasimha, the builder of Roņārak. The art of portraiture, which is described by the technical term viddhachitra in the śilpa texts, has from the earliest times aided the historian to visualise the personality of the king, sometimes effectively presented in literature but often left to our own imagination. Un- fortunately, the portraits of Ajataśatru, Udayana, Prasenajit and others are only imaginary as they occur in very early representations of scenes from Buddha's life, the earliest dating back to the second</page><page sequence="10">30 INDIAN HISTORY CONGRESS - 1957 century B.C. Bhīshma, the great K ira grand-father, Jarāsandha and Bhirn, Yudhishthira and Jayad'atha, all g'eat heroes of th3 Mzhā- bhãrata , are carvings from the imagination of the sculptors of the Gupta and early medieval periods. But there are portraits of kings preserved almost like our modern authentic sculptural representations of personalities. The headless Kanishka portrait and others preserved in the Mathurā Museum have their own great story to tell about the personality of the Kushāņ rulers. We have another fine specimen of royal portrait preserved in the Bhārat Kalā Bhavan in the King and Queen in stone, recalling the king and queen type of Chandragupta coin. The portrait gallery of Kshatrapa rulers as on their coins is the richest. Yajña Šātakarņi's, Harsha's and Rāshtrakuta Krishna's portraits are also preserved on coins. The art-minded king Mahendra- varman has left for us a portrait of himself and his queen in the faded painting at Śittanvavaśal. It should be supplemented by the more elaborate panel from Mahābalipuram. Other Paliava portraits are of Simhavishņu and Narasimhavarman at Mahābalipuram and those of various others in scenes that make up the entire history of the Paliavas in sculpture at the Vaikunthaperumāl temple. The paintings in the Brihadisvara temple at Tanjore give us not only a glimpse of the life in Chola times, but also the portrait of the great Šivapāda- śekhara Rāj arāja and his queens. The builder of the Dārāsuram temple has left for us his portrait with his queen, Vikramaditya with his art-minded queen Trailokyamahadevi that built the group of temples at Pattadakal has given us a portrait as in the company of his queen. The Hoysala King Vishnuvardhana converted to Vaishņa- vism by Ramānuja is shown in his court with his noble and gifted queen Šāntalā, and i,t may be remembered that Śantala was one of the great women of India. The most remarkable portrait of a king with his queens is the Krishnadevaraya group in bronze which is only in continuation of the most early tradition of setting up portraits. The term ãlekhyasesha suggests that the departed ones left only their portraits to recall their memory. It is not only military glory and royal triumph that have found expression in sculptural presentation, but also other aspects of life of the period which have attracted the sculptor's chisel and the artist's brush. The beautiful portraiture at Ajaņtā of the dances ; the row of shops on the high road as prince Vessantara proceeds in his chariot ; the merchants weighing, measuring and selling their wares ; cow-boys moving tardily along with their herd and teasing the snake in its anthill, are a graphic picture of the life of the age. The hunter and huntress in leafy clothing and cowrie and peacock feather adornment as at Sānchl, the fisherman, the fowler, the snake-charmer and hus- bandman and so forth in all these sculptures and paintings from Bāgh, Sānchl, Amara vati, Ajaņtā and other places depict the surging</page><page sequence="11">ANCIENT INDIA 31 life of the age. The quaint mode of writing with the iron stylus on palm leaf, as presented in the carved panel from Nāgārjunakoņda gives us also a peep into the state of advancement in life at that remote period of Indian History. The peaceful hermitage of the rishis, a theme so appealing in itself and which Kālidāsa has sung in several verses of great charm, is a delightful theme in sculpture also. From the time of Bharhut we have several representations of the sages, Upanishadic seers, imparting knowledge to their disciples in the peaceful atmosphere of their hermitage. At Amarāvatī, Goli, Mathurā, and Sānchi, the sage is shown leading the life of a vãnaprastha as also in Gupta and early Western Chãlukya sculpture. There are many effective representations of the hermitage and specially so in the narration of the story of Ahalyã. The simple but magnificent and virtuous wife of Atri pre- senting the precious perfume to Sita in her hermitage is a great sculp- ture from Deogarh, the saptarishis with Arundhati beside the great sage Vasishtha in the centre is one of the unique sculptures hailing from Drakshārāma and belonging to the Eastern Chãlukya school. Agastya is represented not only in India ; but is popular beyond the shores of our land. In Java he is often sculpturally presented as Bhatāraguru ; and as a patron deity of mariners he is present on the deck of the splendid ship in one of the panels at Barabudur. The pleasing mithuna motif in art is unfortunately the most mis- understood as an indication of the degradation of the morals of people in Medieval times. It occurs as a pleasing moťif from the earliest times and it is only when it is properly understood, each carving in its own context with the help of the Kārnas astra, that it reveals its significance. It cannot be forgotton that Dharma , Artha , and Kama are all puru- shãrthas that lead one to the final goal of Moksha , and Kama which is not opposed to Dharma is a great purushãrtha and naturally has a rightful place in art as in life. Indian History has a great chapter of sculpture, inscriptions and literature suggestive in its narration rather than a mere insipid record of events, and it has to be studied with great patience for understanding the cultural unity in its diversity, springing and spreading from a central root from the heart of this our ancient land of hoary traditions.</page></plain_text>
