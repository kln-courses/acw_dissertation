Todd Lawson University of Toronto Narratives of Tampering in the Earliest Commentaries on the Qurʾān. By Gordon Nickel. History of  Christian-Muslim Relations, vol. 13. Leiden: Brill, 2011. Pp. xx + 244. $146. A key element of classical and modern Islamic religious doctrine is the charge that Jews and Chris- tians deliberately falsified their respective scriptures and that the preserved texts of the Hebrew Bible  and the New Testament are corrupt. The notion of scriptural corruption is encapsulated in the Arabic  terms taḥrīf (‘tampering’) and tabdīl (‘alteration’). It is generally thought that the use of these terms in  the Qurʾan (see, for example, Q 2:59, 4:46, 5:13, and 7:62) already reflects the full-fledged doctrine of  textual corruption. In fact, prominent Muslim scholars such as al-Qāsim b. Ibrāhīm (d. 246/860) and  Ibn Khaldūn (d. 808/1406) held that taḥrīf refers to the failure to understand the correct meaning of the  text; and this has been the position of much of Western scholarship since at least the beginning of the  twentieth century, as explained by Nickel in chapter one, “Islamic Accusations of Falsification.” In an  article published in 1922, Ignazio Di Matteo argued that in the Qurʾan itself the term taḥrīf refers to  the misinterpretation of verses relating to Muḥammad or to the failure of Jews to enforce laws found  in the Torah. In 1955 W. M. Watt argued that “the Qurʾān does not put forward any general view of  the corruption of the text of the Old and New Testaments” (“The Early Development of the Muslim  Attitude to the Bible,” Transactions of the Glasgow University Oriental Society 16 [1955–56], 53). In  1986 Mahmoud Ayoub concluded that the Qurʾan accuses Jews and Christians of altering the truths  contained in their respective scriptures, not of altering the texts themselves; and in 2003 Martin Accad  suggested that it would be useful to reconstruct the process whereby the understanding of taḥrīf by  Muslims shifted from its Qurʾanic sense of the failure of Jews and Christians to understand the meaning  of their respective scriptures to its classical sense of the alteration of the texts of the Hebrew Bible and  the New Testament. This is precisely the project begun by Gordon Nickel in the book under review. In chapter two, “The Doctrine of Corruption as a Polemical Theme,” Nickel reviews Western schol- arship on the doctrine of taḥrīf as “flashpoint of polemic” (p. 15) between Muslims, on the one hand,  and Jews and Christians, on the other. The chapter contains a useful review of the writings of M. Stein- schneider, I. Goldziher, M. Schreiner, H. Hirschfeld, I. Di Matteo, E. Fritsch, J-M. Gaudeul, R. Caspar,  C. Adang, and H. Lazarus-Yafeh. This survey is followed by treatment of the difference between taḥrīf  al-maʿnā ‘the distortion of meaning’ and taḥrīf al-naṣṣ ‘the distortion of text’. Arguably the first Mus- lim scholar to make the argument for textual distortion was the Muʿtazilī historian al-Maqdisī in his  Kitāb al-Badʾ wa-l-taʾrīkh (composed ca. 355/966). A century later Ibn Ḥazm (d. 456/1064) laid out  the doctrine of textual distortion in a systematic manner, apparently for the first time. For the next eight  hundred years or so, Nickel asserts, the twin accusations of distortion of meaning and distortion of text  continued along “parallel tracks”: proponents of the former scorned and avoided Jewish and Christian  scriptures, while advocates of the latter read those texts in an effort to identify instances of distortion.  It was only in the middle of the nineteenth century, however—in the context of public debates in India  between Christian missionaries and Muslim scholars—that accusations of textual distortion “took a  kind of quantum leap” (p. 24) that resulted in the commonly asserted but mistaken contention that this  notion is present already in the Qurʾan itself. In chapter three, “Qurʾānic References to the Earlier Scriptures,” Nickel describes and analyzes (1)  the Qurʾanic treatment of earlier scriptures and (2) the vocabulary of “tampering” in the Qurʾan. In part  one Nickel collects references in the Qurʾan to earlier scriptures, e.g., the Torah, the Gospel, the Book,  other writings such as scrolls, parchments, tablets, and revealed books, and “the Word of God.” Then  he draws attention to the key notion of confirmation (taṣdīq) and to the active participle muṣaddiq,  </page> <page sequence="2"> 560 Journal of the American Oriental Society 133.3 (2013) which occurs eighteen times in the Qurʾan in the sense of confirming, attesting, or pronouncing to be  true, e.g., “Before it was the book of Moses for a model and a mercy; and this is a book confirming,  in Arabic tongue . . .” (Q 46:12). In these eighteen verses, the position of the Qurʾan with respect to  the earlier scriptures is positive and there is no hint of any inconsistency between the content of the  earlier scriptures and that of the new one (pp. 49–50). In part two Nickel establishes the semantic field  of the notion of “tampering” in the Qurʾan, with special attention to the context in which the following  verbs are used and to their spatial distribution in the text: labasa (‘to confound’), katama, asarra, and  akhfā (‘to conceal’), baddala (‘to substitute’), ḥarrafa (‘to tamper with’), lawā (‘to twist’), and nasiya  (‘to forget’). He notes that all of the references to tampering occur in suras 2–7 (although, oddly, he  does not do anything with this potentially significant finding); that the context in which these verbs  occur is vague and ambiguous; and that this vagueness and ambiguity would have invited exegetical  elaboration. Chapters four and five are devoted to the work of two early commentators, Muqātil b. Sulaymān  al-Balkhī (d. 150/767) and al-Ṭabarī (d. 310/923). In each case Nickel examines the commentator’s  treatment of twenty-five verses associated with the doctrine of textual distortion. Chapter four treats  Muqātil’s commentary on verses containing verbs of alteration (Q 2:58–59, 2:75, 2:111, 5:13, 5:41,  and 7:162), verbs of concealment (Q 2:42, 2:77, 2:140, 2:146, 2:159, 2:174, 3:71, 3:187, 4:37, 5:15,  and 6:91), and other verbs of tampering, such as “to confound” (Q 2:42, 3:71, and 6:82), “to twist”  (Q 3:78 and 4:46), and “to forget” (Q 5:13–14). Nickel also examines the commentator’s treatment of  expressions of action, such as “write the book with the hands” (Q 2:79), “sell for a little price” (Q 2:79),  “threw behind their backs” (Q 2:101), and “invent a lie against God” (Q 3:94, 6:93). Nickel’s analysis  leads him to the following conclusions: Muqātil was operating on the assumption that during the period  in which the Qurʾan was being revealed the Jews of Medina possessed a copy of the Torah that was  sound and intact. With only one exception the criticisms leveled against the Jews in the Qurʾan have  nothing to do with the distortion of their scripture. Rather, the Qurʾan accuses the Jews of concealing  the contents of the Torah from Muḥammad and the community of believers, uttering words of disre- spect for Muḥammad, rejecting his authority, and refusing to obey him. The sole reference by Muqātil  to textual distortion occurs in connection with Q 2:79 (“So woe to those who write the book with their  hands . . .”), which, according to the commentator, means that the Jews of Medina erased a description  of Muḥammad found in the Torah and replaced it with a description that did not match that of the new  Arab prophet. Apart from this one instance of textual distortion, Muqātil understood the verbs ḥarrafa  and baddala in the Qurʾan as signifying something other than the textual distortion of earlier scriptures. A similar exercise is carried out in chapter five and the results are in part the same: Generally speak- ing, al-Ṭabarī himself—and his sources—assumed that the Torah possessed by the Jews of Medina was  intact and understood the verb ḥarrafa as referring to distortion of its meaning. By the beginning of the  fourth/tenth century, however, the charge of textual distortion appears to have become more prominent.  Al-Ṭabarī mentions at least three references to distortion of the text of the Torah: ad Q 2:79 (above),  he explains that the “book” here refers to the Torah and that the Jews tampered with that scripture, as  evidenced by a report attributed to ʿUthmān b. ʿAffān, according to which the Jews added what they  liked to the Torah and erased what they disliked, including the name of Muḥammad. According to  Nickel, this is “the sharpest accusation of textual falsification encountered in this study” (p. 157). Ad  Q 5:13 (“they tamper with the words out of their places”), al-Ṭabarī explains that the Jews changed the  Torah, with their own hands writing something other than what God revealed to Moses. And ad Q 3:78  (“so they add it to the book of God”), the exegete cites two reports, one attributed to Qatāda according  to which the Jews “introduced something new” into the book of God and pretended that this insertion  was divine revelation, and the other attributed to Ibn ʿAbbās according to which the Jews “added to the  book of God what God did not reveal.” This material compels Nickel to acknowledge—albeit grudg- ingly—that “at the very least . . . accusations of textual falsification were among the traditions which  Ṭabarī collected and reported in his commentary, and . . . these accusations had become attached to  specific verses of the Qurʾān” (p. 161). In Nickel’s view these accusations are “tentative and isolated”  and he wonders why they are made in the context of only one of the four ḥarrafa verses (Q 5:13) and  why the sharpest accusation is made in connection with Q 2:79, which does not contain a verb of altera- </page> <page sequence="3"> Reviews of Books 561 tion. Be that as it may, Nickel observes, the accusations of textual distortion found in al-Ṭabarī do not  resemble the full-fledged doctrine of scriptural distortion articulated by Ibn Ḥazm (p. 163). After completing this linguistic and semantic exercise, Nickel turns to larger issues. In chapter six,  “Method and Meaning in the Interpretation of the Qurʾān,” he explores the “narrative framework”  within which Muqātil was operating and his exegetical method. A central feature of this narrative  framework is the theme of Jewish opposition to religious claims made about the Prophet Muḥammad,  formulated in terms of a rich vocabulary that includes the notions of unbelief, duplicity, denial, disre- spect, envy, greed, enmity, rejection, treachery, and obstinacy. Such characterization of the Jews is only  one of several narrative techniques used by the commentator. Others include the use of anecdote; con- cern with the occasion on which a particular verse was revealed; thematic linkages—dubbed liaison— between stories about earlier prophets and stories about Muḥammad; the identification of unspecified  subjects in individual verses; and the repetition of evocative names. For example, in the first 162 verses  of Sūrat al-Baqara the Banū Isrāʾīl are mentioned four times (Q 2:40, 2:47, 2:83, and 2:122) and the  Yahūd or Hūd are mentioned three times (Q 2:62, 2:111, and 2:120)—always in a general, vague, and  ahistorical context. Nevertheless, Muqātil identifies the subjects of these verses specifically as the Jews  of Medina no less than 112 times. As examples of the serial repetition of evocative names by Muqātil,  Nickel mentions Kaʿb al-Ashraf and ʿAbd Allāh b. Salām, the former a symbol of obstinate rejection of  Muḥammad, the latter a symbol of acceptance of the Prophet based on the text of the Torah. In addi- tion, the exegete draws connections between the sacred past and the career of Muḥammad by means of  references to the themes of covenant, confirmation, and authoritative scripture. These literary devices  make it possible for Muqātil to construct an overarching narrative framework for verses that appear at  first glance to have little or no historical content. The theme of this larger narrative framework is simple  but powerful: God acted in history through the agency of the Prophet Muḥammad between the years  610 and 632. By fitting the Qurʾanic material into this framework, Muqātil created a larger and more  coherent narrative than found in the sacred text itself. As noted, in the commentaries of both Muqātil and al-Ṭabarī, the “tampering” motif is linked to  assertions about Jewish opposition to Muḥammad. The object of this tampering is frequently identi- fied as the purported description of the Arab prophet in the Torah. Thus, when Muqātil refers to “the  matter of Muḥammad,” he means his description, characteristics, sending, and the declaration of his  sending. In the mind of Muqātil, the Torah originally contained verses indicating that Muḥammad is a  true prophet (as suggested by Q 61:60, where Jesus refers to “a messenger who shall come after me,  whose name shall be aḥmad”), that the message proclaimed by Muḥammad was a true revelation from  God, and that the Jews previously had made a covenant with God in which they promised to believe  in Muḥammad and to obey him. It is this larger narrative framework, Nickel argues, that shaped the exegesis of both Muqātil and  al-Ṭabarī. Nickel claims to have “discovered” an “independent narrative framework” relating to the  theme of Jewish obstinacy that governs the commentator’s understanding of specific verses of the  Qurʾan (pp. 208–9). The logic of this larger narrative is based on the key notion of continuity between  the earlier scriptures and the Qurʾan. As understood by the early commentators, the Qurʾan’s claim was  that the new revelation confirmed the truth of the previous revelations sent to the Jews and Christians.  This claim was inconsistent with the notion of textual distortion. Nickel tests his thesis in chapter seven by examining the Sīra of Ibn Isḥāq (d. 150/767) as redacted  by Ibn Hishām (d. 218/833). Here, too, the notions of confirmation and continuity are important, as  reflected in efforts to link the Prophet Muḥammad with a series of earlier prophets that includes Adam,  Noah, Moses, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, David, Solomon, and Jesus. The revelations sent down previ- ously to Moses and Jesus are confirmed—not (yet) corrected—by the new revelations to Muḥammad.  All this is part of God’s plan for the salvation of mankind. In the Sīra we read about Jewish rabbis  who produce the Torah and read it aloud in the presence of Muḥammad. In these narratives, the Torah  confirms Muḥammad’s status as a true prophet and the divine origin of the new revelations. As in  Muqātil’s tafsīr, here too there is no room for the notion of scriptural distortion. Finally, in chapter eight, “Conclusion: Religious Claims and Human Response,” Nickel acknowl- edges that the second part of the project proposed by Accad in 2003—an investigation into where,  </page> <page sequence="4"> 562 Journal of the American Oriental Society 133.3 (2013) when, and under what circumstances the doctrine of textual falsification developed and came to be the  predominant Islamic position—is beyond the scope of the present investigation. It is to be hoped that  Nickel himself or other scholars will pursue this subject in the future. In the meantime, Nickel suggests  several issues that merit scholarly attention: (1) the need of the new community of believers to estab- lish a distinctive Islamic identity, especially in the context of polemical exchanges between Jews and  Christians, on the one hand, and Muslims, on the other, about the nature and validity of their respective  scriptures; (2) a shift in the understanding of the locus of authority from the sunna of God to the sunna  of Muḥammad, which may have undermined the authority of earlier sacred scriptures in the minds of  Muslims; (3) the growing awareness by Muslims of discrepancies between Qurʾanic narratives and  their biblical counterparts, e.g., the identity of the son who was Abraham’s intended sacrifice; (4) the  growing awareness by Muslims of anthropomorphic descriptions of God in earlier scriptures; and (5)  the emergence of the doctrine of ʿiṣma, according to which biblical figures identified as prophets in the  Qurʾan (e.g., David) should not have been portrayed as committing sins in the Hebrew Bible. In Narratives of Tampering Gordon Nickel successfully deploys the techniques of word study and  semantic analysis in an effort to disabuse scholars of the mistaken assumption that the doctrine of  textual distortion is found already in the text of the Qurʾan. This reader has in consequence been  largely disabused of this notion—albeit not entirely. In my view, greater attention should be paid to  the exegeses of Q 2:79, 3:78, and 5:13, in which verses the plain meaning points to the manipulation  of text. I am not fully persuaded by Nickel’s argument that the doctrine of textual distortion remained  largely undeveloped until the time of al-Ṭabarī. My hesitation is based in part upon the small size of  Nickel’s database, which includes only the three sources of the commentaries of Muqātil and al-Ṭabarī  and the Sīra of Ibn Isḥāq, and upon his tendency to downplay evidence inconsistent with his thesis.  One wonders if the seeming anomalies—e.g., a reference to scriptural distortion by either Muqātil or  al-Ṭabarī dismissed by Nickel as “unusual” or “isolated”—may not be the tip of an iceberg whose  body lies largely beneath the surface of the water. Another shortcoming is the absence of engagement  with the Shiʿi claim that references to ʿAlī and his family were deleted from the Qurʾan, a subject to  which Nickel devotes only one sentence (p. 231) although his bibliography includes at least two rele- vant articles and one monograph by E. Kohlberg published in 1972, 2005, and 2009, respectively (the  second article and the monograph were co-authored with Mohammed Ali Amir-Moezzi). Until the Shiʿi  data have been incorporated into the picture, Nickel’s project remains incomplete. The final typescript would have benefited from careful proofreading. There are numerous typos and  spelling errors in English (e.g., p. 71, “indentifiable”; p. 73, “thought” for “though”; and throughout,  “descendents” for “descendants”), errors of transliteration (e.g., p. 79 n. 52, Saʿd b. ʿIbādat; p. 85, anā  awalu man; p. 131, ʿᾹzab for ʿᾹzib; p. 152, al-Ḥassan for al-Ḥasan; p. 154, Abū al-ʿAliya for Abū  al-ʿᾹliya; p. 192, qarra for aqarra), and failure to italicize Arabic terms. The author does not seem  to be familiar with Arabic mā . . . min clauses and their proper translation into English. And I was  annoyed by his use of “exegete” as a verb (e.g., p. 151, “Ṭabarī exegetes Q 3:71”; cf. p. 86). David S.

In this thought-provoking study, Antoine Borrut examines how Umayyad and early ʿAbbāsid Syria  are remembered in historical and other sources. He commands a wide array of sources to raise pertinent  questions about the temporal and geographical parameters that shaped later Islamic (and consequently  modern) understandings of the Umayyad period and of the transition from Umayyad to ʿAbbāsid rule.  While he does not offer a comprehensive reinterpretation of the events of the long century he examines,  he does lay the groundwork for the more sophisticated discussion that will surely follow.
