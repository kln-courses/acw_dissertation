Professor Mallowan's interpretation differs from Professor Frankfort's,4 and to a student of Anatolian prehistory may seem more convincing. But such matters do not concern us here. The purpose of this paper, which accepts the assumption that eyes and eyebrows on vases from Turkish sites are indeed derived from the eastern sources identified by the two scholars, is much narrower: to review the Anatolian evidence,5 present some fresh examples, and thereby reduce the geographical gap between Troy and the east to which Professor Frankfort refers.

Our material, some old, some new, may be divided into types, the first comprising open bowls adorned with incised eyes and eyebrows, the second including face-urns, lids, and other forms. Type I. Open Vases Decorated with Eyes and Eyebrows Such features, incised on the inner rims of bowls, are an early develop- ment and appear to be confined to northwestern Anatolia. Specimens have been found at Troy in the first city, and at Thermi in its middle periods, where 3 Iraq IX 201. * Ibid., 202-2 * For this evidence I am greatly indebted to an article by Dr. Tahsin Ozgii1, DTFCD II 709 (in Turkish only).</page><page sequence="3">FACE-URNS AND KINDRED TYPES IN ANATOLIA 77 they are probably contemporary with Troy I.6 FIG. 2, b, shows a Thermiote sherd, with lozenge-shaped eyes recalling those on a seal from Tell Agrab which both Professor Frankfort and Professor Mallowan illustrate: 7 the Trojan sherd, FIG. 2, a, supplies the nose. Here, perhaps, are the prototypes of the plastic faces, type II, with which Trojan potters so freely enlivened their wares. Type II. Face-Urns and Face-lids Troy. The Trojan face-urns and face-lids are familiar, and a detailed discussion would be out of place, all the more so since the publication of Professor Blegen's excavations is imminent. Schliemann's finds, with their variations, can be studied in his Troja and Ilios, also in Schmidt's Schliemann Sammlung. With regard to period, it should be remembered that thejars which we loosely call urns and their covers were first decorated with faces during the lifetime of the second city, and survived beyond the fourth,8 being thus con- temporary, more or less, with the two-handled goblets and succeeding open bowls of our Type II. Nowhere else were the urns so popular, so much at home. Bolu lies well to the north of any route which may have connected Troy with the prehistoric settlements round Ankara, or with Alaca further east, yet it is the home of a remarkably fine anthropomorphic jar (PLATE 12 ).9 There are arms, pierced lugs for ears, breasts roundly modelled over a plump chest, and horizontal grooves for eyes. The orifice is oval, and under one arm there is a hole which looks at first like a perforation but proves to be an accidental cavity. The clay is yellowish-buff, with only slight traces of polish, the height 24 cm. Smug, stout, and sleepy, the figure which this vessel presents has counterparts at Troy: closed eyes distinguish certain faces there,10 among the more numerous alert ones. Style indicates a date in the ' Copper' or Early Metal Age, and the other finds from Bolu, though not very character- istic, point to the same conclusion. Tekekdy, on the Black Sea coast near Samsun, is the site of a remarkable extra-mural cemetery.1 The cemetery belongs to the 'Copper Age ', and may be dated perhaps between 24oo and 2 B.C.

Several publications refer to face-vases from Alaca,13 and Dr. Kosay's forthcoming publication will give descriptions and illustrations. The vases were, apparently, introduced during the 'Copper Age ', and sur- vived into the Hittite period, where they have been identified in the middle strata which the excavators call Alaca II, 3, and which cannot be earlier than the late sixteenth or fifteenth century B.C.14 To those strata belong two remarkable sherds published in 1948 (FIG. 3, b, c).15 Each is adorned with a thick, beak-like nose, heavy brows, and button-like eyes: each looks as though (a) (b) (c) FIG. 3.-FACE-VASES.

Yet they have little resemblance to the wide, open bowls with interior decoration of our Type I, and their ultimate inspiration must surely have been the more owl-like vessels of the kind made at Troy. Bo'azk'y. From the Hittite capital comes a face, sharp-nosed, staring, with downward sloping eyebrows. The mouth, as sometimes at Troy, is small (FIG. 3, a). Hittite potters were clever at making figures in relief on their vases, and this face, with its smooth, sure modelling, is in much the same style. Dr. Bittel discovered the fragment we are discussing in level IVa in 1935, and described it as probably part of a rhyton.16 It has a slightly out- ward-turned rim, and is fashioned of grey-brown clay with a red polished slip which, according to the text, does not cover the eyes.

But how dissimilar they are in other respects: as though the Trojan tradition had, at two cities not far apart, been preserved in different forms! Thus it can be shown that vessels adorned with human features were made in Anatolia for at least 8oo years; not, however, in large quantities except at Troy during the second half of the third millennium. On the Anatolian evidence alone, a student would be inclined to say: 'here is a convention which was invented at Troy and thence travelled eastward '. He would call to mind the fact that sites near Samsun, such as Tekekoy, give the impression of being subject to Troadic influence; 7 that signs of contact between Troy and Alaca have long been recognised. Now, in view of the strong arguments advocated for an alien, eastern origin, he must readjust his ideas. The convention was not invented at Troy. But was Troy the distributing centre, or had it rivals along roads over the plateau leading to Syria? The Kiiltepe idols might support such a hypothesis if they had been imitated elsewhere; Alaca might have claimed to be a trans- mitter if it had produced more specimens of appropriate date. Yet the strongest arguments are still in favour of Troy; there, on bowls of Type I, the eye-device was first displayed; there, on the urns and lids of Type II, it was elaborated and multiplied. Gradually, as roads were opened up, it spread eastward and northward. Whether it had any religious signifi- cance during the Hittite period, or was due merely to respectful conservatism and popular fancy, we cannot tell. How, then, did it get to Troy? Not apparently overland, but by some route along the south and west coasts. Already there is evidence that Troy and its neighbours had connections with Cilicia, where the third millennium pottery from Tarsus and Mersin can be more freely compared with Troadic wares than with vases from the plateau.18 The connection may have been partly racial, since there is reason for thinking that dwellers in the Troad and Cilicia might have belonged to the same branch of the Anatolian family, and partly commercial. Contact could have been maintained, in spite of the great distance, by sea or, in certain tracts, by routes near the sea; goods, symbols and even cults could have been transmitted. Between Cilicia, Syria, and Mesopotamia, communications were easier and their existence is generally recognised. It is, therefore, permissible to suggest that the eye-symbol came to Troy by way of maritime trade. Though an obvious objection to such a theory arises from the absence of undoubted 17 Iraq XI 193. 18 AJA XLIV 65-7; LAAA XXV 80-2, pl.
