<plain_text><page sequence="1">SOCIOLOGICAL ELEMENTS IN VEBLEN'S ECONOMIC THEORY ARTHUR K. DAVIS IS paper deals first with Thor- stein Veblen's criticism of the clas- I sical economics and his own con- ception of economic science. The non- economic or sociological elements in his theory are then considered with refer- ence to their contrasting explicit and im- plicit meanings, and to Veblen's place in the modern development of analytical social science. A third section sketches part of the ethical aspect of his thought for the light it casts on the broad drift of his economic and social theory. I. VEBLEN S CRITICISM OF ORTHO- DOX ECONOMIC THEORY Veblen defined economics as the sci- ence of concrete economic processes. "An evolutionary economics must be the theory of a process of cultural growth as determined by the sequence of economic institutions stated in terms of the process itself."' The salient features of his con- ception were its breadth and its relative empiricism. He rejected the orthodox view of economics as an analytical sci- ence dealing with an aspect of concrete social action in terms of sharply defined concepts and systematic logico-experi- mental propositions. His definition there- fore made economics an encyclopedic social science. "There is no neatly iso- lable range of cultural phenomena that can be rigorously set apart under the head of economic institutions."2 I The Place of Science in Modern Civilization (New York, I9I9), p. 77. 2 Ibid. An adequate critical evaluation of a work so broadly conceived as Veblen's rests even more on the sociologist than on the economist. As a statement of empirical fact, Veb- len's observation was entirely correct. It does not follow that such a proposition is a valid foundation for a science. In- deed, it is not inaccurate to characterize Veblen's ultimate methodological posi- tion as "scientific nihilism." Veblen's central criticisms of the clas- sical economics were that the orthodox theory (i) failed to explain concrete reality, (2) was teleological or animistic, (3) and was a "taxonomic science." The charge of unrealism, based on Veblen's view of the traditional school as a series of metaphysical phases,3 may be considered a corollary of his other two criticisms. In Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations Veblen saw a conception of a self-moving economic system, wherein the "sequence of events" was causal but its goal beneficent. Smith's social proc- ess was thus basically teleological, ac- cording to Veblen, and, in the light of the Darwinian postulate of nonpurposive evolution, highly unrealistic. Another example of Veblen's tendency to identify his accusations of empirical unrealism and teleology was his proposition that Smith's concepts of market value and natural value are causally unrelated. Na- tural value has no concrete effect on mar- ket value; it is therefore an animistic con- cept. Such an economic theory, Veblen reasoned, is obviously unrealistic-in- capable of explaining everyday economic 3 Ibid., pp. 64-65. Teggert suggests an interest ing comparison between Veblen's teleological, meta- physical, and evolutionary phases of economic theory and Comte's famous law of three stages (Thorstein Veblen [Berkeley, I9321, p. 52).

He should have distin- guished, of course, between animism- teleology and unrealism, for they are not necessarily related.4 That he did not do so is evidence of his radical empiricism and of his relatively unsophisticated analytical insight. Veblen's first charge, that the classical tradition failed to explain concrete real- ity, was based on a fundamental mis- conception of the nature of scientific theory. All theoretic sciences are con- cerned with abstractions. Each deals systematically with an aspect of the con- crete universe. Economics studies only the economic aspect of social action- the acquisition and distribution of scarce resources.5 The major writers of the classical school at least attempted to fol- low this principle-with fair though by no means complete success. Veblen's studies of economic institutions, how- ever, deal from the very beginning with all sociocultural phenomena. The conclusion is unavoidable that rigorous adherence to Veblen's method- ology would result in no science at all. His encyclopedic and empiricist concep- tion of economics compelled him to treat concrete economic institutions as the ele- ments of his system. A few examples of such elements are "business enterprise," "industry," the "leisure class," and "technology." This use of concrete phenomena does not lend itself to the formulation of precise causal-functional relationships, because each such phe- nomenon consists of component ele- ments which can vary independently. The divisibility of the phenomenal 4 This statement also applies to Veblen's use of animism and teleology, as will be shown below. 5 Cf. Pareto, Mind and Society (New York, I935), Vol. I, chap. i; Manuel d'&amp;conomie politique (Paris, i909), chap. i; cf. also, Parsons, "Sociological Ele- ments in Economic Thought," Quarterly Journal of Economics, XLIX (I934-35), 4I4-53. world is, of course, potentially unlimited, and each science effects the necessary analytical distinctions according to its current needs. Yet, even allowing for such latitude, concepts like "business enterprise" are hardly compatible with the requirements of scientific logic in economics. "Business enterprise" in- cludes a variety of occupational insti- tutions, complex market and price phe- nomena, several different patterns of property and authority relationships, be- sides many other equally essential as- pects, all of which have wide ranges of variation. "Business enterprise" is not a monolithic concept in any scientifically legitimate sense. Veblen's methodology at best can pro- duce only rough empirical generaliza- tions. These were common in his work, and often of such brilliant insight that we tend to forget their contingent na- ture. They do not, however, meet the de- mand of science for the formulation of increasingly exact causal or functional relationships and precise statements of the conditions wherein they obtain. Veb- len's extreme empiricism is only a hin- drance to this goal.6 It is in this sense that his ultimate methodological posi- tion may be epitomized as tending to- ward "scientific nihilism."7 If not intrinsically valid as scientific procedure, Veblen's abrupt departure from the classical tradition was useful in a historical sense. He is a milestone in the 6 This empiricism accounts for the baffling vagueness in Veblen's work. 7 Veblen's encyclopedic social science should not be confused with the present moves for "unity" in the social sciences. Co-operation among the vari- ous social disciplines has proved fruitful in many cases, as, e.g., in studies by Henderson, Kardiner, Mayo, Fromm, Alexander, Malinowski, Firth, and Warner. But part of the credit for these successes is due to synthesis and adjustment of the respective disciplines on an analytical level. This is quite different from Veblen's radical empiricism.</page><page sequence="3">I34 ARTHUR K. DAVIS labored growth from the orthodox theory of economic activity toward a comprehen- sive theory of social action, wherein the economic aspect is but one among many -technological, political, normative, etc. -all conceived and interrelated in an analytical system. This halting but fun- damental development in modern social science began with the classical econo- mists themselves, who, although the au- thors of the first mature phase of scien- tific social thought, did not progress far beyond the stage of half-articulated as- sumptions about the noneconomic ele- ments undeniably present in their work.8 Veblen's point of view had the great merit of making more apparent the need for an integrated social science not con- fined primarily to the economic aspect of social reality.9 Veblen's second basic criticism of the orthodox economics was the charge of 8 The fullest existing exposition of this trend is Parsons' Structure of Social Action (New York, I937), which traces the convergence of Marshall, Pareto, Durkheim, and Max Weber toward a defini- tive analytical system of social theory. Another aspect of the same basic trend is represented by Marx; still a third by the American institutionalists, among whom Veblen is usually considered the key figure despite the paradoxical absence of Veblenian disciples. A fourth is embodied in Knight's Ethics of Competition (London, I935), where the approach is nearer the classical tradition. Two papers by A. L. Harris, "Types of Institutionalism," and "Eco- nomic Evolution: Dialectical and Darwinian," Journal of Political Economy, XL (I932), 721-49, and XLII (I934), 34-79, are outstanding among the many discussions of institutionalism and Marxism. Harris' lucid treatment of Veblen and Marx does not, however, place them in what the present writer believes to be their proper historical perspective. 9 Veblen's keenly probing mind raised, albeit not at all clearly or self-consciously, some exceedingly fundamental issues-the nature of science, meth- odology in economics, problems of modern capital- ism, social evolution, social policy, sociological theory, etc. In his posing of challenging issues lies most of his claim to greatness, for 'his answers to those problems were often untenable. animism or teleology. These two terms were used interchangeably-an unwar- ranted procedure on Veblen's part, be- cause it identified very different aspects of the classical tradition. There were two kinds of normative elements in the early classical theory. One was the deistic idea that a benevo- lent Providence was active in society, quite apart from human ends. Hence arose an atmosphere of cosmic teleology which Veblen properly attacked as ani- mistic. But there was a far more impor- tant type of normative element in the orthodox tradition which he failed to dis- tinguish from animism. This was a set of assumptions about noneconomic insti- tutions, the social context of economic activity. His economic principles Adam Smith conceived as valid only within that more or less implicit institutional framework, the social order commonly identified with early English liberalism.Io 10 Cf. Adam Smith, The Theory of Moral Senti- ments (iith ed.; London, i8I2). Smith's concept of sympathy, which he used interchangeably with conscience and fellow-feeling, corresponds essen- tially to the common-value element in modern socio- logical theory. The content of his normative pattern is a mixture of Christian and middle-class values grouped in three main categories-prudence, benevolence, and justice (ibid., Part I, sec. i, chap. v; sec. 2, chaps. i-v; sec. 3, chaps. ii-iii; Part VI, sec. I; also sec. 2, Introd., and chaps. i and iii; and sec. 3). The sole origin of general rules of morality, according to Smith, is education and experience in society (pp. 27I-72). By associating with their fellows, men learn to take account of the views of others toward themselves. Thus they acquire the moral consensus of their society (cf. Durkheim's "collective conscience." Freud's "super-ego," and G. H. Mead's "generalized other"). Prudence in- cludes the self-regarding virtues, one's duties to himself and his own-thrift, health, reputation, foresight, etc. Justice and benevolence refer to one's responsibilities to others (ibid., Part VI). Adam Smith clearly ranked the latter above prudence; where necessary, he invoked the state to enforce justice. Explicit criticisms of self-interest and utility, and denials of their primacy in human motivation, are set forth in Part I, sec. i, chaps. ii-iii, v; sec. 2,</page><page sequence="4">SOCIOLOGICAL ELEMENTS IN VEBLEN'S THEORY I35 The society which the liberal thinkers sought or assumed was one of relatively small economic enterprises having ap- proximately equal resources and stand- ing in the same common relationship to political authority-special privileges to none. To realize this conception of fair play, they proposed that the scope of the state be greatly limited. This was a blow at the abuses and the particularistic ethic of mercantilism. The circumscribed "police state" permitted correspondingly enlarged rights (or immunities from in- terference) for individuals, now on a uni- versalistic basis. For the maintenance of order, chief reliance was placed on an ethic of individual self-restraint com- bined with a sense of the general welfare. Since the classical writers did not make these preconceptions at all clear, they seemed to Veblen to be saying that chaps. iii-vi; sec. 3, chaps ii-iii; in Part II, sec. 2, chaps. i-iii; and in Part IV, passim, esp. pp. 326-34. Only where the individual is completely isolated from society can utility rule conduct (pp. 333-34). Smith advocated a balance of all the affections or virtues included under prudence, justice, and benevolence, but a balance wherein moderation everywhere prevailed, and where the measure of that moderation was sympathy-moral consensus or the view of an ideal spectator-and not utility (p. 54I). Self-restraint he held necessary for the pursuit of all ends, both self-interested and dis- interested (Part VI, sec. 3). He did not envisage any great disparity of wealth among different classes (Part IV, chap. i). A degree of inequality, in his opinion, gave incentive to industry and effort, yet the portions of wealth going to the rich were not unduly greater than if distribution had been in equal shares (p. 3i8). The workings of the several motives and social mechanisms, both ethical and economic, made for that kind of society called liberal as if guided by an "invisible hand." Of course, Smith did not clearly define the institutional trends and structure of his society, nor did he specify incisively the content of the norms he discussed. That he had no real grasp of institutional variation may be seen in Part V. Nonetheless, we can derive from his eighteenth- century terminology, and from our knowledge of the social context of his thought, most of the basic the pursuit of self-interest is unlimited and that, by some magic, the social sys- tem functions so as to maximize the gen- eral welfare. Hence sprang Veblen's im- pression of a mysterious and superna- tural beneficence in their theory, an im- pression reinforced by the minor element of Deism actually present." The assumptions or"sociological prem- ise" of the late eighteenth- and nine- teenth-century liberals concerning the noneconomic aspects of social life were increasingly realized, however incom- pletely, in certain Western nations." values of his age. We find the peculiar Puritan blend of asceticism and strenuous worldliness (Part I, sec. 2); the growing emphasis on a stratification system based on monetary wealth, yet still quali- fied by Christian precepts (Part I, sec. 3, chap. ii); the spread of rationality associated with the middle- class virtue of prudence (Part VI, sec. i); and the new individualism. Something can be implied from his indignant references to certain other social pat- terns, such as slavery in ancient Greece. Smith recognized the problem of evil arising from the inevitable discrepancies between merit and reward, and he pointed to the role of religion in reinforcing the moral code of society by transferring the exact fulfilment of justice to the next world (Part III, chaps. ii and v). Fully aware of the turbulent force of issues relating to power and immediate self-inter- est, he also recognized that more sophisticated self- interest which preaches social conformity for utilitarian reasons. Men, wrote Adam Smith, ad- here to the moral code partly, of course, because it serves their interests better than nonconformity, but mainly because they admire morality for its own sake (Part II, sec. 2, chap. iii). To label Smith an apostle of social harmony through egotistical utilitarianism and unqualified individualism is an error of the gravest sort (cf. 0. H. Taylor, "Economics and the Idea of Natural Laws" and "Economics and the Idea of jus natu- rale," Quarterly Journal of Economics, XLIV(I929- 30), I-39, and ibid., pp. 204-4I, esp. pp. 226-38 on Adam Smith). I, Cf. Taylor, "Economics and the Idea of jus naturale" op. cit., pp. 205-4I. 12 This made the classical economics more nearly a theory of concrete reality (cf. 0. H. Taylor, "Economic Theory and Certain Non-economic Ele- ments in Social Life," in Explorations in Economics [New York, I936], pp. 380-90; and "Economics vs.</page><page sequence="5">I36 ARTHUR K. DAVIS Subsequent collectivist trends reversed this tendency. Veblen attributed the re- sultant divergence between orthodox economic theory and late-capitalist real- ity to the allegedly animistic preconcep- tions of the classical tradition. Failing to perceive the true nature of those pre- suppositions, and then to supplement them with a more adequate sociological theory as Pareto did, Veblen rejected the classical theory in toto. What he was unwittingly attacking in his charge of animism and teleology was the normative framework of the classical economics. There can be little Politics," Economics of the Recovery Program [New York, I9341). In Veblen's day liberalism gave way to monopoly, tariff barriers, and collectivist tendencies. This made for a marked discrepancy between the classical theory and everyday reality. Confronted with this change, some of the later orthodox writers, placing their economic theory in the broader con- text of Darwinian social evolution and thereby shifting the emphasis from market phenomena to survival through competition, could still argue that economics explained reality. Carver, e.g., extolled American capitalism as the source of all progress; he thus analyzed the contemporary order in terms of struggle and survival, and he simultane- ously evaluated it very favorably (cf. T. N. Carver, The Present Economic Revolution in the United States [Boston, I9281, chaps. i, viii, ix; for his very wide definition of economics see The Distribution of Wealth [New York, I9041, Introduction and chap. iii; also The Essential Factors in Social Evolution [Cambridge, I9351, passim). Carver's tendency to expand economics to a synthetic social science in- stead of developing it as an analytical study of the abstracted economic aspect of social reality is well criticized by Talcott Parsons, "Sociological Ele- ments in Economic Thought," Quarterly Journal of Economics, XLIV (I934-35), 434, 659. It is greatly to Veblen's credit that he sensed the inadequacy of the apologist tendency in the orthodox school, even though his own diagnosis of the deficiency was in- adequate. Yet, paradoxically, he, too, would make economics a synthetic social science, but in a differ- ent direction. Veblen's main objection was less to the analytical classical doctrine than to the evalua- tive addenda of his contemporaries. Whereas they supported the capitalistic status quo, Veblen's no less prominent ethical bias rejected it. In so doing, he neglected to distinguish between the scientific and the nonscientific aspects of the orthodox eco- nomic school; he threw out the bath and baby too. doubt about Veblen's intense but veiled hostility to the regime of liberal institu- tions.13 His still-echoing criticisms of pecuniary culture, contemporary busi- ness practices, and the prevailing canons of conspicuous consumption-trees which he took for the forest of modern capitalistic society-were brilliant, bit- ing, and relentless. Although obscured by his unique and involved literary style, Veblen's chief spiritual kinship was Marxist.'4 There remains Veblen's third basic criticism, that the classical economics was a ",taxonomic science," concerned with static categories (such as rent, value) related in a "normal equilibri- um."15 Concrete data were merely classi- fied in those categories. The result, from Veblen's viewpoint, was an effort to force a dynamic concrete reality into the static modes of an obsolete science. So- cioeconomic life in the machine age, as he saw it, was an ever changing process; '3 Part of this hostility, by no means confined to Veblen, springs from a mistaken conception of the nature of liberalism. As with all social creeds, its core was its ethics, which was closely related to the main strands of Christianity and modern philosophy in its universalistic and tempered individualism. But, having been poorly expressed from the be- ginning, it was soon confused with the liberals' practical social program, laissez faire. Laissez faire became an end in itself. In time special privi- lege reappeared under its guise, to the general dis- credit of both laissez faire and liberalism. Actually the liberal ethic is not at all incompatible with state regulation of economic affairs. Veblen, of course, was not responsible for this confusion, which began with the classical theorists themselves (see 0. H. Taylor, "Economics vs. Politics," in Economics of the Recovery Program). '4 There is an unmistakable similarity between the Veblenian and Marxian accounts of cultural evolution, their socialistic goals, and their dicho- tomic class cleavages (though the mechanisms differ, as Harris has shown). The parallels do not stop here; space prevents elaboration. is The meliorative premise which Veblen at- tacked in Adam Smith was given up by the neo- classical writers Marshall and J. N. Keynes.</page><page sequence="6">SOCIOLOGICAL ELEMENTS IN VEBLEN'S THEORY the function of science should be to explain that concrete process in terms of causal or genetic sequences. The model Veblen took for his economics was post-Darwin- ian biology. Genuine Darwinian science, he held, sees no normal equilibrium but only ceaseless nonteleological evolution- ary process. Economics, too, should be- come an evolutionary science.'6 An important support of the pre- evolutionary taxonomic economics, ac- cording to Veblen, was the passive he- donistic view of human nature held by the classical writers. His own brand of instinctivist psychology made man an active element in the social scene. Veb- len's unsatisfactory attempt in the open- ing chapter of his Instinct of Workman- ship to combine purposive effort or in- telligence with nonpurposive instincts suggests that he was groping for a more voluntaristic conception of human na- ture and social action than that afforded by his habit-instinct schema. Despite his immense emphasis on Darwinism, Veblen never systematically applied to social or economic phenomena the leading Darwinian concepts of na- tural selection, survival of the fittest, struggle for existence, and adaptation. These concepts coalesced neatly with the nineteenth-century credo of laissez faire; they were associated generally with a climate of opinion to which Veblen was strongly opposed from a philosophical standpoint. Perhaps this hostility was a factor in his lack of attention to them. Veblen's theory of cultural evolution was Marxian rather than Darwinian or i6 The Place of Science in Modern Civilization, pp. 56-8i, i6I-79. The high degree of consistency in Veblen's theory is clearly apparent in his criticism of orthodox economic theory. Given his premise that economics should explain reality, and given also his empiricist conception of science and his emphasis on change, he could not view the classical economics as other than unrealistic, teleological, and taxonomic. Spencerian.'7 His real borrowings from Darwinism were limited to the vague and peripheral concepts of process and evo- lution. Contemporary biology impressed on his mind the idea of nonteleological social change.'8 Yet his strivings for a full-blown Darwinian theory of social change led him into one blind alley after another.'9 It will appear later that, al- 17 This view seems to be the opposite of that co- gently advanced by A. L. Harris, Journal of Political Economy, XL (1932), 72I-49, and XLII (I934), 34- 79. The disagreement is less real than it seems. Harris never says that Veblen used the Darwinian con- cepts except as analogies. They were not essential elements in Veblen's work. In the character of its medieval and modern stages, in its prehistoric utopian anarchism, and its suggestion of a similarly peaceable social order to come, Veblen's account of socioeconomic evolution is patterned after Marx. This problem is discussed briefly in A. K. Davis, "Veblen on the Decline of the Protestant Ethic," Social Forces, XXII (I944), 283. The nonpredatory behavior pattern, based on the benevolent instinct of workmanship and the parental bent, is one of the two main strands in Veblen's theory of history; it differs radically from the pictures of chronic strife attributed to primeval and primitive societies by Spencer and by social Darwinism in general. i8 This concept is not necessarily Darwinian or biological. Modern sociologists now speak of the "unintended consequences of social action." See the articles of R. K. Merton, "Unanticipated Con- sequences of Purposive Social Action," American Sociological Review, I (1936), 894-904; also "Social Structure and Anomie," ibid., III (1938), 67 2-82. '9 Surely Harris must have sensed the empirical absurdity of Veblen's compound of racial muta- tionism, instinctivism, and environmentalism, which is reconstructed in Part II of Harris' second paper. Veblen's use of instincts, race mixture, and habit to explain the cultural origins and behavior character- istics of the European races boils down to a series of genetic sequences, the elements of which are either vague or-where instincts are concerned- imaginary entities. Temporal sequence establishes nothing about causality. Veblen's genetic method can produce only a descriptive history of socio- economic developments. Indeed, by focusing on an indiscriminate succession of concrete events, and by tending to overemphasize the causal role of one or a few elements, geneticism hinders the analytical consideration of a social system as a functioning whole. E.g., Veblen's dichotomic treat- ment of modern capitalism in terms of business and industry omits a number of elements highly essen-</page><page sequence="7">I38 ARTHUR K. DAVIS though Veblen claimed an explicit theo- retical orientation chiefly Darwinian or biological, he was actually groping to- ward a theory of social action of a very different sort. His Darwinian categories of habit and instinct both contain im- plicit but significant normative elements. The interpretation of Veblen's tax- onomic science is very difficult. One sug- gestion is that he meant that economists must include in their theoretical system a conception of the direction and goal of economic development.2o Some form of socialism was probably in his mind, al- though he set forth no such goal in so many words. The logic of the machine process, Veblen felt, made for the under- mining of contemporary predatory insti- tutions-such as capitalistic enterprise, private property, the state, the leisure class-and the eventual emergence of a peaceful social order characterized by tial to the modern economic system, such as the social organization of industry and the relation of occupational institutions to other institutions; and it lumps together other elements better handled severally-the capitalistic ethic, competition and monopoly, relations to political authority, etc. In the social sciences some form of the comparative method, such as that used by Weber in his study of the Protestant ethic, is necessary for genuine causal analysis (cf. J. S. Mill, Logic, Book VI). Veblen's nearest approach to a comparative study of institutions is in Imperial Germany (New York, I9I5), and The Nature of Peace (New York, I9I7). It should be noted finally that Veblen's remarkable predictive insights are based, however unwittingly, on the normative and other truly social elements in his theoretical system rather than on the nonsocial conditions of action-heredity and environment. Thus, Veblen was able to foresee the probable rebirth of aggressive German nationalism under certain conditions, not because he predicted the behavior of some hypothetical German predatory instinct but because he accurately estimated the nature and strength of the ethico-political senti- ments centering around the German concept of the state and the relation of the individual to authority. 20 Oscar Morgenstern, "Observations on Prob- lems of American Institutionalism," Saggia di storia e di teoria economia (G. Prato), pp. 333-50 (unpublished translation by George Stigler). technological abundance. Yet he expect- ed this desirable tendency to be blocked eventually by a reversion of Western society to militaristic predation, which he predicted as early as I904 in one of his most brilliant insights.2, Another view is that Veblen's charge of taxonomy referred to the hedonistic and meliorative premises which he at- tributed to the classical school; closely related was the orthodox concept of nor- mal equilibrium.22 Veblen felt, according to Harris, that these traditional pre- conceptions amounted to a rationaliza- tion of the socioeconomic status quo, in direct opposition to his own activist view of human nature and his hostility toward laissez faire. Without rejecting the validity of these points of view, we may offer another in- terpretation of taxonomic science. (i) Because Veblen defined social reality as a process continually changing, and be- cause of his extreme methodological em- piricism, he implicitly reasoned that no genuine science could be founded on an assumption of fixed logical relations. No facts can legitimately be classified in per- manent abstract categories because the facts are changing all the time. There- fore, Veblen reasoned, scientific cate- gories must change too. Science must be a process like the data with which it deals. (2) In Veblen's eyes knowledge and science and theories in general were molded by the nature and form of the society in which they occur. For exam- ple, in the feudal age God was conceived as a great king and in the handicraft era as a master-workman. Likewise, the na- tural rights philosophy of capitalism and liberalism grew up in the handicraft age, to be undermined in the machine age. 2I Theory of Business Enterprise (New York, I904), chap. x. 22 Harris, "Types of Institutionalism," op. cit.</page><page sequence="8">SOCIOLOGICAL ELEMENTS IN VEBLEN'S THEORY I39 Our conclusion is that Veblen was grop- ing toward a theory of Wissensoziologie along Marxian lines, which posits ideolo- gies and knowledge as functions of the sociocultural milieu.23 Again, because of his empiricism, he confused the role of science as an independent variable with its role as a dependent variable. Since it illuminates his criticism of orthodox economic theory, Veblen's re- lationship to Werner Sombart of the German historical school will be sketched as a conclusion to this section. Veblen considered Sombart a genuine "post- Darwinian" economist whose chief work was a genetic account of modern capital- ism.24 He saw in Sombart's study a his- tory of economic institutions strictly on an empirical level. But he failed to grasp the incisive, highly self-conscious, theo- retical system which was the very essence of the German's work. Sombart dis- tinguished in modern Western history a succession of unique economic epochs, each characterized by its own peculiar economic system, which in turn was de- termined primarily by its respective eco- nomic "spirit." The handicraft economy was characterized by the basic value of maintaining a traditional standard of living, and the capitalistic economy by the ultimate value of maximizing mone- tary gain. While these two systems might exist side by side in concrete historical 23 As a final estimate of concrete interrelation- ships between ideologies and other sociocultural variables, the Marxian view is, of course, one- sided, though legitimate for purposes of analytical study. Functional interdependence is nearer the truth. Veblen escaped from this one-sidedness in some of his later work, where he gave ideology a more independent and even a leading role. Cf. his Nature of Peace, chap. v. 24 See Veblen's favorable review of Sombart's Der moderne Kapitalismus (I902). in the Journal of Political Economy, XI (1903), 300-305. Several writers, including Harris, have accepted Veblen's uncritical belief in the essential similarity between his own work and that of Sombart. reality, according to Sombart, theoreti- cally they were entirely unrelated.25 Veblen's historical epochs-particu- larly his handicraft and capitalistic eras -roughly concurred with those of Som- bart, to whom they owed part of their descriptive content, such as the account of the origin of modern technology. Yet Veblen never distinguished between them on the theoretical level as Sombart did. Veblen's view of history as a con- tinuous process was much closer to the unilinear type characteristic of nine- teenth-century Anglo-American thought than to the German conceptions of cyclical or discrete cultural epochs. It was primarily with respect to their concrete economic history that the two men were most congenial. They shared also the same ethical bias in favor of the craftsman's value orientation and against the capitalistic ethic of maximum acquisition. Believing that economic sci- ence should explain concrete reality, each rejected the English classical economics. Veblen proceeded to construct his theory of social action mainly on the nonsub- jective elements of heredity and environ- ment, whereas Sombart "went the other way" and made the value element the central one in his conceptual scheme.26 25 Sombart's premise of unique cultural epochs and his stress on the value element as the decisive causal factor therein left him in a position where he was unable to explain satisfactorily the origin of the Geist from previous social situations. This logi- cally pushed him into an idealistic interpretation of action (cf. Talcott Parsons, "Capitalism in Recent German Literature," Journal of Political Economy, XXXVI [I928], 64i-6i). 26 Cf. Parsons, "Sociological Elements in Eco- nomic Thought," Quarterly Journal of Economics, XLIX (I934-35), 4I4-53. The orthodox economics dealt mainly with the rational aspects of action, with those elements falling chiefly in the intermedi- ate means-ends sector. Broadly speaking, there are two additional major analytical divisions of action: (i) the conditions of action (heredity and those aspects of environment not in the status of the</page><page sequence="9">I40 ARTHUR K. DAVIS The empirical similarities in the thought of Veblen and Sombart were set in pro- foundly different theoretical contexts. II. SOCIOLOGICAL ELEMENTS IN VEBLEN S SOCIAL THEORY There now arises the problem of what analytical elements Veblen employed in his social theory in place of the re- jected categories of the orthodox econo- mists.27 It is necessary first to outline a conception of a generalized system of action with which to compare Veblen's system. The following sketch is not ex- haustive. Concrete social systems can be broken down analytically into three major as- pects in terms of the actor's means and ends.28 (a) The conditions of the actor's situation are those aspects not control- lable by him-heredity and such part of the environment as does not stand to the actor in the status of potential means. Since the actor must adjust to them, they are important elements in his situa- tion. (b) The rational category of action includes those empirical aspects of the actor's situation which are potential actor's means) and (2) ultimate value elements. Thinkers rejecting the classical emphasis on the rational elements could develop either of these two other categories or subdivisions thereof. A compre- hensive theory of action requires the integration of all. 27 Veblen's criticism of the classical economic theory made his own economics in effect an encyclo- pedic social science. An economics thus broadly defined is better denoted by the more general term "social theory." Veblen's thought ranged over all the major social sciences. To strictly economic stud- ies he gave very little attention, and that of a non- quantitative sort (cf. his discussion of loan credit, Theory of Business Enterprise, chap. v). He focused instead on the methodological preconceptions of the various economists. In addition to the scientific interest of Veblen's work, there is a strong under- current of ethical pronouncement on social policy. 28 Cf. Parsons, Structure of Social Action, pp. 718-i9 and passim. means to his proximate ends. It there- fore involves among other elements the economic aspect of his situation-his control of scarce resources-and the po- litical aspect. (c) The category of ultimate value elements consists of the actor's ends-in-themselves. Always nonrational, these values orient the actor to nonem- pirical entities, to the problems of mean- ing, evil, life, and death (religiousvalues). They relate him to society and to other actors. When meaningfully integrated and held in a common faith by the mem- bers of a group, these end-values consti- tute the group's social essence-its gen- eral institutional pattern, which defines and supports the structure of authority, the system of stratification, and greatly influences cultural activities. Parsons calls them institutional elements.29 The elements of action most explicitly formulated by Veblen were habit and instinct.30 On this evidence his main the- oretical focus was on the conditions of action, the interplay of heredity and en- vironment. Pareto would have classified him as a social Darwinist. Closer exami- nation of Veblen's use of these elements, however, will disclose important non- Darwinian components. There are nor- mative elements implicit in both of his basic categories. Technological, political, and economic elements are also employed in his work. Consequently, although Veblen remained largely within the limi- tations of the positivistic tradition with 29 Cf. Pitirim Sorokin, Social and Cultural Dy- namics (New York, I937), Vol. I, chap. i; Vol. II, chap. i; Bruno Malinowski, The Foundations of Faith and Morals (New York, 1936); Emile Durk- heim, Elementary Forms of Religious Life (New York, I926); Parsons, Structure of Social Action (New York, 1937), and "Theoretical Development of the Sociology of Religion," Journal of the History of Ideas, V (I944), I76-90. 30Instinct of Workmanship (New York, I9I4). chaps. i f.</page><page sequence="10">SOCIOLOGICAL ELEMENTS IN VEBLEN'S THEORY 141 a pronounced tendency toward its radi- cal Darwinian wing, there were significant "pointers" in his work toward a broader social theory.3I Yet he remained wholly unaware of their theoretical import. The first major element of Veblen's theory of action to be considered here is his category of instincts. "For mankind the life of the species is conditioned by the complement of instinctive proclivi- ties and tropismatic attitudes ..... These are the prime movers in human be- haviour. "32 Instincts, according to Veb- len, are "innate propensities," combina- tions of tropisms or reflexes. Instincts de- fine the ends of action, which the individ- ual consciously strives to realize. There is an area of rationality in Veblen's sys- tem. In the process of realizing these ends, men and societies build up pat- terns of knowledge and tradition, or "habits of thought." This is Veblen's defi- 31 "Positivistic" in Parsons' sense of the term. Positivistic thinkers emphasize the intermediate rational sector of action primarily, and the con- ditions of action secondarily. Normative elements are overlooked (cf. Parsons, Structure of Social Action). This classic analytical study of positivism traces the emergence of a more comprehensive theory of social action from the positivism of the classical economists, but it does not place positivism in its historical perspective. Limiting the scope to the English positivists omits the school of the origi- nal and leading positivist, Auguste Comte, whose work does not wholly fit Parsons' concept of posi- tivism. Even within the branch he discusses, it is not accurate to say that Adam Smith or Veblen was a thoroughgoing positivist, for there are signifi- cant normative elements in the work of both of these men. Parsons' treatment of Smith, e.g., is based solely on the Wealth of Nations. The "meta- physical prop," central to Parsons' analysis of positivism, largely disappears if the Theory of Moral Sentiments is considered (see n. IO above). This seems to jeopardize a major portion of the Parsonian case against the positivists. We must ask, "Who were these positivistic writers?" Perhaps the most that can be said is that they constituted a "climate of opinion." They tended to approach more or less closely the positivistic pole formulated analytically by Parsons. 32 Instinct of Workmanship, p. i. He repeats the point at intervals throughout all his books. nition of institutions. They originate as means to the ends set by instincts; but from their own tendency to autonomy, and because of the continual attention they received, they eventually became ends in themselves. Quite unlike any ordinary instincts were Veblen's instinct of workmanship, the parental bent, and idle curiosity.33 The more conventional instincts such as anger, hunger, and sex he went on to de- fine as "half instinctive, half tropismat- ic."34 He thus indicated a distinction be- tween instinct and tropism without ex- plaining the difference. The point is high- ly significant for present purposes, how- ever. After a casual reference or two, these "tropismatic instincts" disap- peared from Veblen's work (i.e., the strictly biological elements were tacitly dropped). The suggested interpretations of his concept of "instinct" follow; these apply to his general use of the term throughout the body of his work except for his preliminary definitions. The instinct of workmanship involves two related value elements-high pro- ductivity or making things of a material nature, and the ideal of doing a job well for its own sake.35 Veblen's ethical bias in favor of maximum production of phys- ical goods-his definition of welf are- led him to merge these two value ele- ments. The job for itself, or doing some- thing for its own value, fits precisely Veb- len's conception of the subordinate na- 33Some commentators on Veblen have added the predatory bent. This belongs properly in the category of habit, as will appear below. 34 Instinct of Workmanship, p. 29. 35 Cf. Weber on "labor in a calling," in The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism (Lon- don, 1930). Veblen has obviously hit upon a major value pattern in American social structure. It is a combination of the Puritan heritage of work as an end in itself and the more modern American empha- sis on quantitative materialistic productivity.</page><page sequence="11">I42 ARTHUR K. DAVIS ture of the sense of workmanship, easily turned to any ends.36 The aura of pains- taking pride which hangs about his em- ployment of workmanship is all but ex- plicitly normative; it cannot by the widest stretch of imagination be recon- ciled with the general idea of a biological instinct. Veblen described the modern emanci- pation of women as growing out of the instinct of workmanship made possible by woman's increased leisure and by the new economic pattern wherein "indus- try" undermines the old habits of thought. He referred to this "new woman movement" as the reassertion of the "ancient habit of purposeful activity" and usefulness against the more recent predatory and pecuniary ways.37 That he thus explained in terms of habit and instinct a basic cultural trend rooted in complex developments in our occupa- tional, kinship, and economic institu- tions-changes best analyzed in terms of institutional roles and patterns-needs no elaboration. Of primary interest here is the connotation of usefulness which Veblen consistently associated with the instinct of workmanship. Since he re- peatedly though vaguely defined useful- ness and welfare as the maximum mass consumption of physical goods, we may ascribe to workmanship the implicit nor- mative value of high material produc- tivity. The parental bent signifies a vague cosmopolitan humanitarianism, a con- cern for the welfare of the community.38 The sexual instinct is specifically ex- cluded. The parental bent and the sense of workmanship in Veblen's theory are the two chief dispositions contributing 36 E.g., Theory of the Leisure Class (New York, I899), p. 33. 37 Ibid., pp. 359-60- 38 Typically stated in ibid., p. 219. to the material well-being of the race. So broad a concept as the parental bent could never be an instinct. Its unadulter- ated altruism in part expresses Veblen's personal rejection of the highly competi- tive and self-interested values of con- temporary society.39 Its formlessness springs from Veblen's lack of an ade- quate concept of a social system. Soli- darity in the real world is not uniformly omnipresent but channelized in specific relationships-in patterns of moral ob- ligation (rights and duties) which vary in content and extent in time and place. Idle curiosity is one of Veblen's most difficult concepts. Here again Veblen be- gan with an explicitly biological orienta- tion,40 but he did not sustain it. A stimu- lus in Veblen's view could call forth a re- sponse which is overt and pragmatic (ex- pedient for the actor) or one which is neither motor nor pragmatic. This latter type Veblen called the instinct of idle curiosity. In other words, he divided knowledge into two categories, utilitar- ian and nonutilitarian. The immediate motives of each were expediency and idle curiosity, respectively. A subdivision of utilitarian knowledge was worldly wis- dom-maxims of expedient conduct, ex- hortations to thrift and virtue. Veblen gave no further attention to this concept except to say that it is not cumulative as is the rest of knowledge. In Veblen's thinking, knowledge stem- ming from idle curiosity was not idle or random save in the sense that it was non- utilitarian. It had a definite relationship to the social system, which loosely gov- erned its formulations. Thus, in Veblen's 39 The conventional definitions of self-interest and altruism used by Veblen are no longer accept- able, in either a scientific or an evaluative sense (cf. Parsons, "Motivation of Economic Activities," Canadian Journal of Economics and Political Sci- ence, VI [1940], i87-202). 40 The Place of Science in Modern Civilization, p. 5.</page><page sequence="12">SOCIOLOGICAL ELEMENTS IN VEBLEN'S THEORY primeval Savage State, knowledge was cast in anthropomorphic terms-myths and legends reflecting the peaceful agri- cultural economy. In the modern ma- chine culture, knowledge, according to Veblen, increasingly assumes the form of science or ideas expressed in terms of causal sequences like the machine proc- esses they reflect.41 Idle curiosity, as actually employed by Veblen, is largely a value element, best interpreted as the quest for rational knowledge for its own sake. He depicted it as usually subordinate to the prevail- ing institutional patterns of the age. In the present machine era, idle curiosity, according to Veblen, is freed by (i) the influence of the machine process in dis- solving traditional habits and institu- tional patterns and (2) the chance con- geniality of the machine process and modern science with reference to their mutual emphasis on causal sequences. The impelling force of the industrial dis- cipline furthers the development of sci- ence.42 Idle curiosity again expresses a large element of Veblen's own ethical outlook, wherein the value of learning and science 4' For Veblen's writings on "idle curiosity" see his Place of Science in Modern Civilization, pp. I-3I; The Higher Learning in America (New York, i9i8), pp. i-i5; Instinct of Workmanship, pp. 84-89. His conception of the relation of knowledge and society reflects the Marxian influence. We may fur- ther note that Veblen's theory of the evolution of knowledge from primeval animism to modern science paralleled Comte's theory of knowledge. Still reflecting Comte, Veblen implied that scientific knowledge, through the occupational discipline of industry, is increasingly becoming man's sole ori- entation to his situation-nonscientific sources of orientation such as religion being the result of ignorance or error. This untenable view is to some extent characteristic of evolutionary and positivis- tic social thought. 42 As a theory of the origin of modern science, this view requires drastic modification (cf. R. K. Merton, Science, Technology and Society in Seven- teenth-Century England [Bruges, I9381). ranked highly. The same disinterest noted in the parental bent is once more implicitly highlighted by the consuming self-interest attributed by Veblen to his epoch. This may also be said of the qual- ity of objectivity in science so ardently advocated by Veblen. His own practice, in his study of the leisure class, was so one-sided that it became almost an ex- pose, though not without significant sci- entific contributions. The difficulty of following Veblen's reasoning about idle curiosity empha- sizes the incompatibility between his ex- plicit theoretical system and the under- lying substance of his thought. Habit, in Veblen's explicit sense of the term, was learned reflexive activity. He built up the concept to something far more significant than the unthinking re- flex patterns suggested by the conven- tional definition of habit. Habit patterns, according to Veblen, are cumulative, and they gradually acquire an autonomy of their own. They tend to become ends in themselves instead of means. He de- scribed the transition process as follows. In the prehistoric Savage State, the sense of workmanship and the parental bent held unhampered sway. Men were rated competitively on the basis of their technological efficiency in contributing to the common welfare. But eventually esteem came to be an end in itself. Wealth, the by-product of technological skill, became the symbol of proficiency.43 43 Veblen gave a badly tangled account of the origin of ownership. The maze of instincts and habits which he invoked is traced by Harris, "Economic Evolution: Dialectical and Darwinian," op. cit., pp. 60-65. We have here a prime example of the futility of explaining major social phenomena in terms of nonsocial elements. Veblen's vague use of "ownership" in the sole sense of private property held in fee simple is also not acceptable. We must refer instead to specific patterns of particular prop- erty rights, the content and referents of which may vary widely.</page><page sequence="13">I44 ARTHUR K. DAVIS Thence it was but a step to rate men di- rectly in terms of wealth or ownership. As the competitive quest for status was intensified, force and fraud were em- ployed to gain the prized possessions. From such origins, according to Veblen, arose the institutions of private property, the state, and the church.44 The major institutions, once estab- lished, appropriated the resources of the community and thus seriously impaired its well-being, which Veblen defined in terms of the maximum production and mass consumption of physical goods. Hence he labeled these institutions "predatory." His well-known concept of the predatory bent should accordingly be classified in the habit category rather than among the instincts. The significant aspect of Veblen's con- cept of habit is its implicit normative role defining the basic value configura- tions of social groups. Veblen was grop- ing toward a broader concept of institu- tions as integrated meaningful patterns 44 Theory of the Leisure Class, pp. I5-i6 and passim; Absentee Ownership (New York, I923), pp. 3I9-22, 442, and passim; Imperial Germany, chap. ii. Veblen's theory of cultural evolution is a beautiful example of "conjectural history." He divided civilization into two parts: (i) the peaceful prehistoric Savage State and (2) the Predatory Cul- ture, covering all subsequent historical time. The second part is subdivided into cultural stages ac- cording to the type and degree of predatory pat- terns, as follows: (a) the Barbarian State, lasting through the Middle Ages and characterized by military predation; (b) the Pecuniary Culture- modern times, featured by pecuniary predation. Veblen distinguished two phases in Pecuniary Culture-the Handicraft Era and the Machine Age. This theory of cultural stages does not rest on a study of concrete societies of the past. Its author read back into prehistoric antiquity the present-day competitive striving for status and for the symbols thereof. He universalized some local constellations which can exist only in our own rela- tively unique open-class, mobile society. His ten- dency to lump together sharply contrasting cul- tural periods-to generalize from unintegrated traits drawn from different social contexts-shows the limitations imposed by his empiricism. "defining the situation" of action. An in- stitution thus analytically conceived is quite different from "habits of thought." He came closest to this new view in his studies of the leisure class and of imperial Germany. In his justly famous Theory of the Leisure Class, Veblen dealt with the latent function of consumption pat- terns in symbolizing social status and expressing contemporary competitive val- ues.45 His able work on Germany focused on one of the Reich's central institutional configurations, the concept of duty to the Fatherland.46 In proportion as Veb- len transcended his literal habit-instinct orientation, his works gained insight. But, given his empiricism and his Dar- winian bias, there was no possibility of developing his insights on a theoretical level.47 There is one more important com- 45Cf. A. K. Davis, op. cit. 46 See his Imperial Germany (New York, I9I5), and its sequel, The Nature of Peace (New York, I9I7). These are Veblen's finest works. His pro- phetic insight is nothing short of brilliant, however sketchy his analysis as a whole. The books are still worth reading (cf. A. K. Davis, "Veblen's Study of Modern Germany," American Sociological Review, IX [I944], 603-9). 47 The measure of Veblen's approach to an ade- quate sociological concept of institutional norms can be seen on pp. 67-68 of his Theory of Business Enterprise. He stated there an opposition between such conventions or norms as blood relationship, clan solidarity, divine guidance, property, and na- tionality, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, the cause-and-effect habit of mind arising from the influence of the machine process. The former norms Veblen portrayed as resting on conventional grounds; he depicted the machine discipline, how- ever, as strictly nonconventional (italics mine). Veblen's nonnormative definition of the machine process, as set over against specifically normative categories, is evidence for several points: his in- adequate conception of the role of normative ele- ments in a social system, and the vein of philosophi- cal anarchism in his thought. If Veblen had pos- sessed a genuine concept of institutions, he would have made the machine process a normative cate- gory, differing in content but not in kind from kin- ship, clan solidarity, etc. (cf. ibid., pp. 3IO-II).</page><page sequence="14">SOCIOLOGICAL ELEMENTS IN VEBLEN'S THEORY I45 ment to be made on Veblen's social theory. His viewing concrete institutions as predatory perversions of the uniform- ly benevolent instincts points directly to a latent vein of philosophical anar- chism in his thought. Institutions, as he saw them, were pernicious in their social effects. The veiled implication was that they ought to be modernized. Institu- tions were closely connected in Veblen's mind with the idea of culture lag. His de- scription of them as autonomous "sur- vivals" from earlier ages has doubtless been the chief influence on the culture- lag school in American sociology.48 For example, the institutional core of busi- ness enterprise in the machine age, ac- cording to Veblen, is the natural rights philosophy of the handicraft era. The implication of lag is obvious, and Veb- len's adverse ethical judgment of it is equally plain in the overtones of all his writings. One may go even further. Veblen in- ferred not only that the major concrete institutions ought to be renovated but that they ought to be largely done away with. The institutions of business enter- prise in America and the dynastic state in Germany-each the dominating social organization in its society-were both painted by Veblen as wasteful and dam- aging to the general welfare. They pre- vent maximum potential consumption by the masses. Business enterprise re- stricts production to maintain profitable prices, and it encourages conspicuous consumption by the leisure classes. The dynastic state turns its resources to war. Veblen's potential mechanism for the re- moval of these predatory institutions was the dissolving influence of the ma- chine process. 48 The best-known statement of this school is that by W. F. Ogburn, Social Change (New York, I925). An acute problem of order is posed by Veblen's evaluative ideas on social policy. Institutional or common value patterns, when integrated, constitute the founda- tion of moral order in concrete societies. The work of the first-rank modern sociol- ogists converges on this point.49 A soci- ety without institutions is inconceivable. Yet that is the direction in which Veb- len's philosophy leads. The normative elements implicit in the Veblenian categories of instinct and habit are the beginnings of an adequate concept of institutions. If, however, the contemporary institutions attacked by Veblen as wasteful and predatory were actually discarded-if his category of habit phenomena were thus set aside- the normative elements in his instinct category would be wholly inadequate as a substitute institutional pattern for any human society. The sense of workman- ship, the parental bent, and idle curios- ity cannot begin to solve the inevitable and omnipresent problems of authority, property patterns, distributive stand- ards, and punishment-reward patterns. There is in Veblen's thought a close philosophical kinship with the school of Rousseau and Godwin. Existing institu- tions appeared to Veblen as obstacles to Utopia. Like many other great dissenters, he looked approvingly on what he took to be the undermining of those institu- tions. Yet, unlike his visionary prede- cessors in the tradition of extreme indi- vidualism, Veblen was too much of a realist not to foresee a possible reversion to reinforced institutional controls.So 49 See, e.g., the writings of Comte, Durkheim, Pareto, Weber, and Sorokin; also T. Parsons, Struc- ture of Social Action. Some of the cultural anthro- pologists should be mentioned, especially Lloyd Warner, Malinowski, and Firth. 50 We may note a similar anarchistic vein in much Marxist thinking. Indeed, Veblen himself referred to the socialists' lack of definite reform</page><page sequence="15">I46 ARTHUR K. DAVIS Veblen's analytical theory, with its bias toward an extreme empiricism and its very limited instinct-habit schema, was not adequate for the broad work he undertook.5i This criticism, however, proposals as "the vague iconoclasm of Socialism" (Theory of Business Enterprise, pp. 337-39). He admitted further that his own machine process, while ignoring and undermining habits and con- ventions, itself gives no insight into good and evil (ibid., pp. 3IO-II). (This is further evidence for the argument set forth in n. 47 above.) But Veblen attributed this absence of practical insight to the weak hypothesis that contemporary institutions were not competent media for conveying socialistic attitudes. Actually, both the vagueness of the socialists and Veblen's own indefiniteness are due mainly to the negative character of their own socio- logical orientations. No specific institutional sub- stitutes were offered because neither Veblen nor the socialists realized the necessity for such a pro- gram. In brief, they had only an incomplete idea of a functioning social system and its component elements. * A vital lesson here presents itself. While pure social science alone is no guide to social ethics or social policy, the statesman's or politician's socio- logical orientation-always present whether im- plicitly or explicitly-has a profound effect on the specific measures he will advocate or resist. Acting on social groups automatically involves precon- ceptions as to their nature and workings; acting successfully necessitates accurate preconceptions. Social science does not define a social ethics, but social ethics requires an adequate social science as part of its data. This proposition has far-reaching implications for college and secondary-school edu- cation in social science and ultimately for national policy itself. The modern spread of social planning to meet our growing social problems requires, among other things, an ever more adequate, ob- jective, systematic understanding of contemporary social reality on the part of the citizenry. Most undergraduate programs in social science today are sadly deficient in this respect. 5' The first adequate criticism of Veblen was by A. L. Harris, "Types of Institutionalism" and "Economic Evolution: Dialectical and Darwinian,") Journal of Political Economy, Vol. XL (I932) and Vol. XLII (I934). Harris' approach is wholly differ- ent from that used by the present writer. Its chief contributions were: (i) the definitive demonstration that neither Veblen nor Marx held technological in- terpretations of history; (2) clarification of the con- trasting mechanisms but similar social results of Marx's rational class struggle and Veblen's non- teleological occupational discipline; (3) indicating how the nonrational and adventitious character should not cause us to forget that Veblen was a brilliant pioneer, the most original American social thinker of his genera- tion.52 Commentators on Veblen tend to be wholly for him or wholly against him. of Veblen's theory of change, unlike Marxism, afforded no definite predictability and no ideological basis for an action program; (4) emphasizing the ultimately noneconomic nature of the Marxian and Veblenian class conflicts. The main failings, from the present writer's point of view, were: (i) the great overemphasis of the Darwinian aspects of Veblen's theory; (2) the failure to consider Veblen's prediction of a possible reversion to militarism as an alternative to a future socialistic order (here was a prototype of a concept of institutional variation); (3) the lack of recogni- tion of the absence in Veblen of a comprehensive conception of a functioning social system. The last is the basic weakness, shared by many institutional- ists. Except for those pursuing quantitative neo- classical studies, American writers engaged in broadening economic science too often lacked ade- quate theoretical orientation. Hence they floundered about, some in the blind alleys of nonsocial heredity and environment, and others in vague concepts such as material forces. Yet these stirrings were signs of growth. The last-mentioned type of cate- gory, having social referents, permitted further analysis. An adequate theory of change in social science must be stated primarily in terms of ana- lytical social elements. Where, as in Veblen's case, the use of nonsocial categories has proved at all useful, it is because social and particularly norma- tive elements have implicitly crept into such con- cepts as instinct and habit. The second detailed analytical criticism of Veblen's theory was made by Parsons, "Sociological Elements in Economic Thought," Quarterly Journal of Economics, XLIX (1935), 435-39. This study has the inestimable advantage of having been made from the explicit standpoint of a mature analytical theory of action. In the light of the present discus- sion, however, Parsons' views should be qualified as follows: (i) Veblen is not an out-and-out radical positivist; (2) there are normative elements in the Veblenian habits and instincts; (3) the predatory bent is not an instinct; (4) idle curiosity is not the primary source of technology. More conventional commentaries on Veblen have been made by several other writers. Paul Homan, Contemporary Economic Thought (New York, 1928), and Rexford Tugwell (ed.), The Trend of Economics (New York, I924), are helpful. 52 Though scientific social theory has now gone beyond him, his stature is not diminished, any more than Newton's greatness is lessened because college Freshmen can now do calculus.</page><page sequence="16">SOCIOLOGICAL ELEMENTS IN VEBLEN'S THEORY I47 Neither view sufficiently analyzes his theory to show exactly what it represents or where it stands in the history of social thought. A long perspective is useful here. Much medieval and early modern social thought contained two kinds of inter- woven value elements: (i) evaluative, the writers' own values, and (2) norma- tive, or values viewed as objective fac- tors in social interaction. But with the rise of natural science in seventeenth- century England, men began to pattern social theory in its image.53 Both kinds of value elements tended to disappear. The first type never belonged in science, but the second was indispensable. The more extreme phases of this indiscrimi- nate reaction are usually associated with the nineteenth-century climate of opin- ion known as positivism. In the long run of intellectual history, it should probably be considered a temporary aberration from which social thought is now recov- ering as the crucial role of the objective normative element in social science is more fully recognized. Veblen's work is a notable sign of that fundamental trend. III. SOME ETHICAL ELEMENTS IN VEBLEN' S THOUGHT No final understanding of Veblen is possible without considering his ethical orientation.54 He was one of an amor- phous group, consisting mainly of liter- ary and political personalities such as 53 Cf. Sorokin, Contemporary Sociological Theo- ries (New York, 1927), chap. i. 54 Veblen's ethical position requires a separate, documented study. Here we merely sketch the gen- eral nature of his Weltanschauung to round out the present paper. The topic bears directly on the inter- pretation of the three Veblenian instincts; it con- ducts to a more balanced verdict on a highly con- troversial figure; most important of all, it uncovers some of the broader implications of Veblen's eco- nomic thought which a discussion limited to his objective economic propositions would miss. Marx, William Morris, Henry George, Debs, the naturalistic writers-men with little in common save their emphatic dissent to various aspects of capitalistic society. He stood closer than is generally realized to Marx, a thinker of far greater stature; and, like Marx, Veblen was in the last analysis a moralist. His tone was one of probing irony, however, and not that of a revolutionary prophet. His thought being rooted in the canons of progress and material welfare and the subordination of technology and fac- tional interest to those ends, Veblen scrutinized his society with a sort of tongue-in-cheek objectivity. Long before war and depression overtook us, he read the ominous signs and assumed the un- popular role of critic. Among the Ameri- can intellectuals of his day, therefore, he was relatively unique. Criticism of his scientific work should not obscure the value of his ethical insight and the worth of his pioneering ventures into new fields. Veblen made no comprehensive or explicit critique of modern society. He attacked the current tendencies toward restricting industrial output to maintain prices and toward the maldistribution of wealth separated from responsible en- trepreneurial effort. His conception of workmanship as useful, meaningful, and highly productive thus becomes clearer to us. In his eyes capitalism stood for the opposite of those virtues-for superflu- ous luxury, which he indirectly but acid- ly criticized in The Theory of the Leisure Class; for restricted output, which he arraigned in Absentee Ownership and The Vested Interests; and for frustrated labor and technology, which, in The Theory of Business Enterprise, he pictured as pre- vented by pecuniary interests from con- tributing maximum production to wel- fare. The polemical orientation of the</page><page sequence="17">I48 ARTHUR K. DAVIS parental bent was Veblen's opposition to the intense competitiveness and self- centered individualism of his time. Idle curiosity Veblen conceived as nonutili- tarian, i.e., not subject to the influence of those pecuniary interests he resented. He desired freedom to apply scholarship to his society, even though it should en- tail unfavorable publicity for certain as- pects of that social order. Although Veblen is a marked man in American social thought, he is not a major thinker like Rousseau or Marx, for he created no full-fledged social phi- losophy. His emphasis on technological abundance as the criterion of welfare ignores elements crucially important to every functioning social system. Any action program based solely on Veblen's precepts would inevitably come to grief, probably insuring by its blunders the triumph of the opposition. Yet Veblen's work-his failures as well as his successes-is highly significant. It bears on the relation of economics to the broader stream of social thought.55 The bulk of Veblen's writings can be sub- sumed under that heading. No discussion of his thought can avoid the problem of the relationship between social science and social ethics, for his ideas are a blend of those two categories. We therefore present some propositions which Veblen, handicapped by an inadequate concep- tual scheme, did not himself formulate, but which are suggested partly by the general implications of his work and partly by the point of view whence we have criticized that work in this paper. In a society as interdependent as ours, a mature social science must become part of the data of social ethics and policy. The nature and functioning of social sys- tems must be better understood than 55 Social thought refers here to policy as well as to science. hitherto by practical leaders and re- formers, for the findings of social science are increasingly necessary to policy, to which they stand in the category of means.56 In the past the development of social science has been too fragmentary to be of immediate use in everyday af- fairs. Now, however, the expansion of deliberate social policy to affect all as- pects of the common life makes doubly urgent the need for the restatement of ultimate ends and the rational analysis of mechanisms and means. And in the integrated comprehensive theory of ac- tion slowly emerging, the fulfilling of that need is in sight. Social policy is ul- timately a moral issue, but it cannot realize its aims without a body of objec- tive instrumental knowledge. Veblen was justified in feeling that science and ethics should draw closer together. His mode of relating them was wrong, for he mixed the two categories indiscriminately. During the last century or two, the function of disinterested social criticism has devolved on persons in the literary and philosophical callings. Whatever they lacked in systematic knowledge of society was not a grave handicap in a social order that was much less closely knit than ours. Today nothing can com- pensate for that deficiency. Men of letters may often have a perspective which is broader and better balanced than that of the scientific specialists; they may be indispensable as free minds and fore- runners; but their prestige as social oracles has outrun their competence.57 We must turn increasingly to the social 56 Social science here represents a general classi- fication which includes economics, sociology, psychology, cultural anthropology, etc. 57Lewis Mumford's Condition of Man (New York, 1944) illustrates a typical combination of useful ethical insight with totally inadequate con- crete analysis and recommendations.</page><page sequence="18">SOCIOLOGICAL ELEMENTS IN VEBLEN'S THEORY scientists; and, to offset the ensuing loss of vividness and evaluative power, the scientists must draw closer to social ethics, keeping the two disciplines always distinct but making the results of each available to the other.58 That the momentous challenges con- fronting social science cannot be met by standing still in traditional attitudes was one of Veblen's soundest convictions. Hence the significance of his groping efforts to transcend certain aspects of the orthodox economics. His best work, such as that on Germany and the stabi- lizing of peace, represents a preliminary attempt at co-operation between social science and policy. The answer to his 58 About these matters Karl Mannheim has written more clearly than most. He has indicated how modern social techniques and conditions make for comprehensive social planning in all fields (see his Man and Society in an Age of Reconstruction [London, 1940], Parts II, III, and VI; also Diagnosis of Our Time [London, I9431, chaps. i-vii). His con- cept of social planning means control of the key positions in social organization; it includes also the idea of planning to leave some areas of behavior uncontrolled. Obviously much is needed in the way of new social techniques and integrated points of view about means and ends. shortcomings is not the relapse of science into academic isolation and esoteric spe- cialization. Scientific objectivity, spe- cialized analytical development, knowl- edge for its own sake-these are still as indispensable as ever. Yet they must make their contribution to the necessary ethical awakening, to social reorganiza- tion, and to the universal view. Veblen the sociologist has many seri- ous failings. Veblen the seeker deserves the honors of a pioneer. The way he took has not turned out to be the main line of sociological development, but at least he realized that there was something to be sought and found. Though he sensed but dimly their full implications, he dealt with a startling array of very far- reaching matters-the nature of eco- nomics, the workings of various socio- logical mechanisms, questions of ethics, the problem of Germany, and others. Once more we may say of Veblen that the issues he raised were much more fun- damental than the way in which he set- tled them. HARVARD UNIVERSITY</page></plain_text>
