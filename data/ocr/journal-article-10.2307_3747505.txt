<plain_text><page sequence="1">NEW BOOKS The four parts are: first, "Explanation in Science and Everyday Life"; second, "The Subject-Matter of History"; third, "Causal Connexion in History"; and, finally, "Some other Aspects of Historical Explanation." The title of the first is self-explanatory. The second deals with the problems posed by the notorious paradoxes of Croce, Collingwood and Oakeshott. The third begins by studying a selection of causal statements actually made by various historians in the course of their historical work: a merit not universal. It goes on to elucidate the notions of root cause, true cause, real cause and so on: which so often give rise to debates which are either altogether unnecessary or in which issues of one sort are mistaken for issues of another sort. The fourth sets to work in a Rylean way on the relations and differences between motive and causal ex- planations, and on those perplexities about "our knowledge of other minds" which helped to generate epigrams such as the "facts of history are present facts" (Oakeshott) and "all history is the history of thought" (Collingwood). This is an excellent book, and one which has been needed for a long time. But by reason of its very merits it is hard to review. Mr. Gardiner is throughout quiet and gentlemanly in his manner, sensible and sympathetic in his argu- ments. He takes the paradoxes which have made the philosophy of history an exciting even if apparently preposterous inquiry; and gently shows first how wrong they are, then how their authors were misled into them, and finally how the truth which they contain can be restated, soberly. It is all most elegant and admirable, and wholeheartedly to be recommended: but difficult to quote from or to comment on. Three points, however. First, The Nature of Historical Explanation and G. J. Renier's History: its Purpose and Method supplement one another. The former is by a philosopher with a historical training, the latter by a historian with philosophical interests: the former elucidates the sources of and the sense in the Idealist paradoxes, the latter merely indicates, impatiently, how wrong these are. But he has much more to say about differences among the jobs which historians do, and unlike Mr. Gardiner, is not inhibited from criticising particular pieces of historical work. Second, Mr. Gardiner's tone is always mild, even where something harsher and more polemical might be in place. He is very gentle with Croce's style (pp. 45-6); and with Engel's important but misguided views on "the role of the individual in history" (pp. III-I2). Third, the discussions of the notion of cause (especially at pp. 9 ff. and pp. 99 ff.) will be valuable also outside the philosophy of history. Two trivial criticisms: the term logical construction should not be introduced without explanation as it is (p. 56); and it is a pity that the O.U.P. should adopt the trying practice of splitting even quite short footnotes, printing half on one page and half on the next (pp. 37-8 and pp. 51-2). In sum: this is a book which should be in every philosophical andhistorical library; a good book. ANTONY FLEW. Descartes and the Modern Mind. By ALBERT G. A. BALZ, Corcoran Professor of Philosophy, University of Virginia. (Yale University Press. London: Geoffrey Cumberlege. 1952. Pp. xiv + 492. Price 63s.) For Professor Balz the greatest achievement of the modern mind is science and technology, and Descartes is the most important influence in the trans- formation of the Western tradition making it possible. In the writings of Descartes he says "was displayed that one mind which most richly expressed the forces that reshaped our intellectual tradition, that most significantly contributed to its direction, that most clearly enunciated the major themes 87</page><page sequence="2">PHILOSOPHY of modernity's development, and that proved to have been most prophetic concerning the consequences" (vii); and his study of Descartes is designed to bring this out. Descartes's philosophy, however, he insists, cannot be under- stood without the "architectonic of wisdom" expounded by Aquinas, according to which there are two relatively independent disciplines, one, the work of man's mind under the control of Revelation (which Professor Balz calls Theologia) the other, the work of man's mind pursuing its inquiries inde- pendently of this control (Scientia, which includes science, philosophy and "natural" theology). "In so far," says Professor Balz," as St. Thomas is responsible for this ordering, it may be urged that he defined the auspices of modernity" (p. 52). I am not very happy about this. Independence of Theologia was certainly claimed on behalf of Scientia; but it was not always admitted by the theolo- gians, and even Aquinas did not regard it as complete; and Professor Balz himself notes in Part III that in our day the "architectonic of wisdom" may take the form of a need for adjustment between a different pair of disciplines, both falling within Scientia, the one concerned with what he calls "claims" about the nature of things (the positive sciences) the other concerned with "doctrines" about the ends man should seek, the ways in which he should live, in the interest of the good life, theology being abandoned altogether. One of the main points stressed in this study is the need for distinguishing between the systematic order of Descartes's thought and the order adopted in the Discourse and the Meditations for purposes of exposition. In Meditations III and IV Descartes makes many statements he has no right to make until he has reached the position established in Meditation VI; but Professor Balz believes that if allowance is made for this the whole enterprise becomes better understood and less open to the common criticisms. He therefore uses the literary device of distinguishing between the fallible Rene Descartes, who is faced with the problem of expounding his ideas, and Cartesius, who makes neither concessions nor mistakes. According to Professor Balz Descartes was aware that the proof of God's existence based on the fact that he has an idea of God, and the proof based on the fact that he himself exists, are not really valid by themselves, but are merely provisional until the ontological proof has been established. I am not convinced by his arguments, and his view has the unfortunate effect that he does little more than glance at the proof from the existence of the idea of God in the mind, and I should have liked to see him treat it at length. It is after all, even for Cartesius, an important problem to know whether anything exists besides his own thought and the ideas he finds in himself; and his approach to this problem through this proof is quite different from that through the ontological argument, and appeals to entirely different principles. In like manner, the considerations leading Descartes to the conclusion that there is a material world, whose essence is extension, are, I think, left by Professor Balz without sufficient discussion. Part II deals with the Idea of Nature, and with the Images of Nature used by Descartes for the purposes of science, while in Part III an attempt is made to find what relevance the Cartesian analysis has for modern problems. I found the book rather difficult to get into. The style is discursive, pleasant and easy, avoiding technical terms, but in many chapters no clear impression was left in my mind of what was being said, except what was gathered from the footnotes. These are clear, crisp and definite, with no superfluous words. In the text it often looks as if the writer is feeling his way, skirmishing round his subject, at times saying roughly the same thing in different ways, without quite giving it a decisive turn. I should have liked the writer of the footnotes to have a larger hand in the writing of the text. 88</page><page sequence="3">NEW BOOKS In spite of this, the book brings an impression of an attractive personality, thoroughly knowledgeable in all matters concerning Descartes, and reflecting suggestively on the modem situation in the light of Cartesian principles. L. J. RUSSELL. Peirce and Pragmatism. By W. B. GALLIE. (Penguin Books. Pp. 247. Price 2S. 6d.) This is likely to be the most valuable of the series of Pelicans on philosophy: if only because Peirce stands in so great need of an expositor. His own writings exist only in a form which gives an impression of a "philosopher of threads and patches". Professor Gallie's book entirely removes this impression. He presents us with an exposition of Peirce's thought so clearly articulated that we may easily lose sight of the enormous task of organizing and collating that must have gone into the preparation of this volume. Indeed, so inseparably interwoven are the many strands of Peirce's thinking that Gallie is often hard put to it to maintain, even for purposes of exegesis, such broad divisions of subject-matter as Epistemology, Logic and Metaphysics. To take one example: Peirce's denial of the epistemological doctrine of "knowledge by acquaintance" depends on his semantical doctrine of Thought-Signs, accord- ing to which a sign is intelligible (is a sign) only in virtue of its relation to other signs which might be said to interpret it; which in turn is scarcely to be under- stood except in the light of Peirce's logical doctrine of hypothesis (a special sort of sign), viz., that a hypothesis depends for its meaning on the possibility of development and modification by further related hypotheses. Gallie rightly insists at the very outset that the pragmatist doctrine of Peirce, which is a theory of meaning, has nothing whatever to do with what is traditionally regarded as "Pragmatism", the doctrine of William James, which is a theory of truth and was expressly rejected by Peirce. Perhaps the most striking and illuminating parts of the book are those in which Peirce is shown (without explicit comparison) to have anticipated familiar modem doctrines. An obvious example is, of course, the verification principle itself, which is virtually what Peirce's pragmatist maxim enunciates. An even more interest- ing example is the similarity between Peirce's account of inference and logical appraisal of argument, and Ryle's work on the construction and utilization of theories-not to mention their common hostility to Cartesianism and the myth of immediate self-knowledge. Gallie's admirable exposition errs, if anywhere, only in a certainreluctance to admit that Peirce made any mistakes. Only in the chapter on Metaphysics are his protests, that Peirce goes too far, more than lukewarm. Elsewhere he constantly turns the shafts of criticism with the plea that even from Peirce's most extravagant dicta we have "much to learn". This is just what he says, for example, of Peirce's view that there is an "observational, and even in an extended sense an experimental, element in all deductive processes" (p. 93)- an "element" which turns out (p. I63) as the employment of diagrams in geometry. Again, in the section on Cosmology (Chap. g) Gallie is at pains (and why not?) to defend Peirce against the charge of "shameless anthropomorph- ism": but the only reason he sees for denying Peirce's cosmology the status of a scientific theory is that its "hypotheses" are not subject to the pragmatist criterion of meaning. He fails to point out that Peirce's "evolutionary law" stating a development from complete spontaneity towards complete deter- mination, being (to adopt Popper's terminology) a statement of trend, is not a "law" at all. There is a suggestion of an assimilation, or even identification, on Peirce's part, between the dynamic development of scientific hypotheses 89</page></plain_text>
