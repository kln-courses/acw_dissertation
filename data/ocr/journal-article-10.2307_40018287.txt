Printed in the Netherlands. Abstract. This paper considers the claim that Hume was hostile to religion and religious belief, and hoped for their demise. Part one examines his approach to belief, showing how commentators take him to see religious belief as non-natural. Part two challenges this con- clusion by arguing, first, that Hume's distinction between natural and artificial virtue allows the term "natural" to cover religious belief as well; second, that Hume himself never denies religious belief is natural, and, third, that he takes religion to be a necessary part of any flourishing society. The target of Hume's critical remarks on religion, it is then emphasized, are forms of "false" religion, which arise from the corrupting influence of passion, hypocrisy, bigotry, enthusiasm, and superstition. At best, it is concluded, the claim that Hume was hostile to religion requires qualification, while the view that he was in favor of its actual demise is largely unwarranted. Introduction It is not without reason that much scholarly debate has been occasioned by Hume's rather enigmatic writings on religion, and that such attention has focused on those works where he explicitly addresses religious themes. The ambiguity and complexity of Hume's view is admirably reflected in the sheer variety of Humes that have flowed from interpreters' pens: his complicated relationship to the characters of the Dialogues Concerning Natural Reli- gion has been a subject of particularly heated debate,1 and on the basis of extrapolations drawn from there and elsewhere, he has been characterized variously as an "atheist," "aesthetic theist," "philosophical theist," "agnostic," and "attenuated deist."2 Although these interpretations draw quite different, sometimes contradictory, conclusions about Hume's personal and philosoph- ical views on religion, there is general agreement that in some way or another he was hostile not only to institutional religion, but to religious belief itself. Some have gone so far as to argue that Hume hoped for the active demise of religion and the system of belief upon which it is based. So, as Mark Webb has put it forcefully writing of the Natural History of Religion, Hume offers "first and foremost a moral critique intended to sever allegiance to 'traditional religion' - traditional theism in general, and Christianity in particular."3</page><page sequence="2">172 TIMOTHY M. COSTELLOE In the present paper, it is this latter sort of claim that I want to examine. I shall do so by considering two aspects of Hume's thought, namely, his views on the nature of religious belief, and his view that religion of some sort is a necessary part of a flourishing society. Corresponding to these aspects, the paper falls into two parts. In the first, I examine the distinction between "natural" and "rational" belief. I shall argue that religious belief falls unequi- vocally under neither of these headings, and this will lead me to conclude that there is good reason to suggest that Hume was neither hostile to reli- gion as such nor that he thought it would or should disappear. In the second part of the paper I support this conclusion by focusing on three aspects of Hume's philosophy. I argue, first, that Hume's distinction between natural and artificial virtue gives warrant for subsuming religious belief under the heading "natural"; second, that Hume himself refuses to rule out the possi- bility of religious belief being natural, and, third, that he takes religion to be a necessary part of "every civilized community." The target of Hume's many critical remarks about religious matters, I then emphasize, are not directed against religion per se, but against particular forms of "false" religion, all of which can be traced back to the corrupting influence of passion, hypocrisy, bigotry, enthusiasm, and superstition. This observation is borne out by noting those passages where Hume emphasizes the positive influence of "true" religion and its proper place in the general "progress" of civilization. At best, I conclude, claims about Hume's purported hostility to religion require considerable qualification, while the view that he was in favor of its actual demise is largely unwarranted.4 Belief and natural belief "Natural" and "rational" belief In order to understand Hume's view of religious belief in particular, it is necessary to understand his approach to the nature and causes of belief in general. The most focused discussion of this topic is to be found in Treatise I, III, vii-viii, where Hume begins by observing that, since we conceive or have many ideas of objects that we do not believe, there must be "qualities" the presence or absence of which generates the granting or withholding of assent, respectively (T, 65). Hume traces these qualities to the "manner" in which ideas are conceived, so that belief and the conviction it involves, are explicable in terms of a "lively idea related to or associated with a present impression" (T, 67); or, as he says in the Abstract, belief is "an idea assented to [which] feels different from a fictitious idea, that the fancy alone presents to us" (T, 412). Since any idea is a more or less vivid copy of some original,</page><page sequence="3">HUME ON BELIEF AND THE DEMISE OF RELIGION 173 whether or not it attains the status of belief depends upon the degree of force and vivacity communicated to it from the corresponding impression. So, to use Hume's example, the difference between having a conception of existence and believing in existence depends not upon something being added to the idea, but on the force and vivacity with which the idea strikes the imagination. Hume thinks that the truth of this "general maxim" (T, 69) is demonstrated clearly in the three principles of association - resemblance, contiguity, and cause and effect - which unite one idea with another. Thus the idea of a friend is enlivened by a picture bearing his resemblance; thoughts of home grow more intense the nearer to it one reaches, and the idea of a saint is made more vivid by artifacts of which he was the direct cause (T, 69-70; EHU, 124ff.). The immediate occasion of this discussion in the Treatise is to discover an impression by which the idea of necessary connection might be explained. Hume achieves this by tracing the idea back to an impression of reflection consisting of the feeling which, once copied to form an idea, determines the mind's assent. This feeling arises, in turn, from custom or the propensity on the basis of repeated experience for the mind to pass immediately from a cause to its related effect. "For after we have observ'd the resemblance in a sufficient number of instances," Hume remarks, "we immediately feel a determination of the mind to pass from one object to its usual attendant, and to conceive it in a stronger light upon account of that relation" (T, 1 1 1). Consequently, the degree of belief - that is, the force and vivacity of the idea - depends upon the strength of the feeling, and that, Hume reasons, is to be traced to past experience which determines the probability - and thus the degree of conviction - that a given event will in fact be followed by its usual attendant. Thus necessary connection, Hume concludes famously, is "some- thing, that exists in the mind, not in objects"; it belongs "entirely to the soul, which considers the union of two or more objects in all past instances" (T, 112). Necessary connection reaches to the status of belief, however, because the exceptionless regularity of past experience leaves no room for doubt. One important conclusion that Hume draws from his investigations into belief and necessary connection is that neither reason nor experience provides access to the "ultimate causes" of things. Reason discovers nothing in objects prior to experience, while experience itself "only accustoms the mind to pass from one [object] to another" (T, 114). For "As to those impressions, which arise from the senses" Hume writes, "their ultimate cause is, in my opinion, perfectly inexplicable by human reason, and 'twill always be impossible to decide with certainty, whether they arise immediately from the object, or are produc'd by the creative power of the mind, or are deriv'd from the author of our being" (T, 59).5 Belief in causality, then, is essentially</page><page sequence="4">1 74 TIMOTHY M. COSTELLOE non-rational: philosophical inquiry cannot justify it either through experi- ence, which terminates in constant conjunction, or by way of reason, which discovers nothing more than the subjective belief based on experience. Hume concludes that causality is actually a projection; it is taken to reside in the world and, given the lack of evidence to support it, strictly speaking this judgment is a mistake. It is an unavoidable mistake, however, arising as it does from the facility of the mind to move easily between the ideas of objects, and from the obscurity into which this facility subsequently throws the real source of causal efficacy. Hume offers a similar (though slightly different) analysis of inter alia continued existence (T, 126ff.), personal identity (T, 164ff.), the transition of property from one person to another (T, 330-331), and the sense of obligation which accompanies promising (T, 335-336). In each case, philosophical inquiry shows the idea in question to be an "error" or an idea feigned by the imagination in lieu of an accompanying impression. The ideas still have the requisite force and vivacity, however, and this raises them to the level of belief. For "It seems evident," Hume says, "that men are carried by a natural instinct or prepossession to repose faith in their senses, and that without any reasoning, or even almost before the use of reason, we always suppose an external universe which depends not on our perception but would exist though we and every sensible creature were absent or annihilated" (EHU, 200-201). To show that such ideas constitute non-rational beliefs, however, is not to say that they are irrational or mere beliefs. Such beliefs cannot be justi- fied by reference to experience, but they can be explained as the result of natural propensities.6 As such, natural belief might be defined in terms of three important characteristics. First, it is a pre-reflective, almost instinctive feature of naive common sense which human beings possess without any prior education; second, there is no more reasonable alternative set of beliefs that one might adopt, for which reason such belief is held universally, and, third, natural belief forms a pre-condition for action such that acting as if it were not true would be tantamount to not acting at all. As such, beliefs in causality, continued existence, and the like, are "natural" because they are necessary and irremediable aspects of experience which arise immediately from human nature. Thus belief in causal efficacy, as Hume describes it at one point, is like "a species of natural instincts, which no reasoning or process of the thought and understanding is able either to produce or prevent" (EHU, 123-124). Or as Hume remarks in the Natural History, "Nature . . . can have no other tendency than to show the whimsical condition of mankind, who must act and reason and believe, though they are not able, by their most diligent enquiry, to satisfy themselves concerning the foundations of these</page><page sequence="5">HUME ON BELIEF AND THE DEMISE OF RELIGION 1 75 operations or to remove the objections which may be raised against them" (EHU, 168-169). If some beliefs are natural, however, others are clearly "rational" in so far as they are justifiable by reference to evidence furnished by experience. Since they are based on experience, they can always be assessed in light of new evidence and, if necessary, revised or adjusted. Because belief consists of the force and vivacity of an idea, extended experience and critical reflection can weaken the conviction which constitutes the belief in question; it might even fade to the point of becoming a fiction, and a new belief rise up in its place. Unlike their natural counterparts, then, these rational beliefs may be criticized and altered without subverting the basic order of existence.7 Beliefs which underlie moral and aesthetic judgments are of this sort, where education, extended experience, and reflection often lead us to revise earlier judgments, and counterbalance the effect of general rules which, Hume argues, have the tendency to produce prejudicial views of one kind or another (T, I, III, ix). It is for this reason that moral and aesthetic sentiments can improve over time, and can do so without going against nature. The idea of change in the case of natural beliefs, by contrast, is simply incoherent. Religious belief Having outlined his approach to belief in general, I am now in a position to raise the proposed question about Hume's view of religious belief in partic- ular. Does such belief, that is, count as "natural" or "rational" in the senses outlined above? The view that religious belief is natural has been defended by some commentators, most notably by RJ. Butler, who takes the fact that "we commonly act in accordance with belief in design" to support the conclusion that "belief in design must be a natural rather than a rational belief." Belief in a designing God, that is, cannot be justified either on the basis of experience (a posteriori), since one cannot infer more in the cause than is contained in the effect, or through reason (a priori), since whatever is conceived as existent can be conceived as non-existent without fear of contradiction. This leaves only the category of natural belief, Butler reasons, to explain an individual's belief in intelligent design.8 As other commentators - most notably J.C.A. Gaskin - have pointed out, however, the main problem with this position is that belief in God does not satisfy the criteria which, as outlined above, define a belief as "natural." Indeed, when the criteria governing the latter are applied to the case of religion, belief in God seems much closer to rational belief than it does to natural: acquiring such belief is not a feature of naive common sense, requiring as it does education within a particular tradition; there is a reason- able alternative set of beliefs that one might adopt (namely, atheism), which</page><page sequence="6">176 TIMOTHY M. COSTELLOE means that it is not universal, and, given that many get on in the world quite well without it, religious belief hardly counts as a precondition of action. One seems forced to conclude - as various commentators have - that, for Hume, religious belief cannot be natural in any meaningful sense of that term.9 It follows, moreover, that in so far as it is a rational belief, the evidence underlying the conviction can be questioned and, finding it wanting, what was belief can be transformed into mere fiction. Thus corrected on the basis of reflection and extended experience, religion might well go the same way as certain prejudices or bad taste. There are good reasons for questioning this conclusion, however, and in the present context I want to focus on three of them. First, Hume distinguishes between natural and artificial virtue, and this provides grounds for extending the term natural to include religious belief as well; second, Hume refuses to rule out the possibility that religious belief is natural, and, third, as noted above, he emphasizes religion as a necessary part of any flourishing society. I shall consider each of these in turn. Hume's view of religion "So loose a signification " The first reason to question the conclusion that religious belief is non-natural concerns Hume's distinction between natural and artificial virtues, and his remarks on the meaning of the term "natural." Natural virtue and vice, Hume maintains, consist of approbation and disapprobation which follow upon a sentiment of pleasure and pain, respectively; we then approve or disapprove of actions because they are useful to the possessor or others or because they are immediately agreeable to the possessor or others. In all four cases, Hume argues, the virtues in question have a "natural beauty and amiableness, which, at first, antecedent to all precept and education, recommends them to the esteem of uninstructed mankind, and engages their affections" (EPM, 105- 106). The artificial virtues, by contrast - of which justice and allegiance to government are the prime examples - develop only as a "contrivance . . . from the circumstances and necessities of mankind" (T, 477). If the circumstances and necessities were otherwise, Hume reasons, these virtues would have no use and would therefore never arise. There is clearly a point of analogy here between artifice and religious belief. Like the latter, and unlike their natural counterparts, the artificial virtues do not arise from a feature of naive common sense; they are not universal since one can conceive of circumstances in which they might not occur, and, given that institutions of justice and ties of allegiance often break-</page><page sequence="7">HUME ON BELIEF AND THE DEMISE OF RELIGION 1 77 down, they do not form a precondition of action. Although these virtues are artificial, however, Hume insists that they are in a sense "natural." The term "natural," Hume writes, "may be opposed, either to what is unusual, miraculous, or artificial. In the two former senses," he continues, justice and property are undoubtedly natural. But as they suppose reason, forethought, design, and a social union and confederacy among men, perhaps either epithet cannot strictly, in the last sense, be applied to them. Had men lived without society, property had never been known, and neither justice nor injustice had ever existed. But society among human creatures, had been impossible, without reason and forethought . . . But all these disputes are merely verbal (EPM, 173n64). Thus the "word, natural" Hume concludes, "is commonly taken in so many senses, and is of so loose a signification, that it seems vain to dispute, whether justice be natural or not." "If self-love, if benevolence be natural to man," Hume continues, if reason and forethought be also natural; then may the same epithet be applied to justice, order, fidelity, property, society. Men's inclinations, their necessities lead them to combine; their understanding and experi- ence tell them, that this combination is impossible, where each governs himself by no rule, and pays no regard to the possessions of others: And from these passions and reflections conjoined, as soon as we observe like passions and reflections in others, the sentiment of justice, throughout all ages, has infallibly and certainly had place. In so sagacious an animal, what necessarily arises from the exertion of his intellectual faculties, may justly be esteemed natural (EPM, 173; see also T, 387ff.). Justice, then, might well be an artificial virtue in so far as it is contrived, but it is natural in that those "circumstances and necessities" which explain its origin are unavoidable features of human nature. Moreover, Hume urges, the contrivance itself is only possible because "nature provides a remedy in the judgment and understanding, for what is irregular and incommodius in the affections" (T, 314). Nature both sets the problem for which justice is the solution, and provides the means for the solution to come about. Now I am not suggesting that religious belief can be explained simply as a contrivance; Hume certainly does not describe it as such, and there is no textual evidence for treating the two as similar in kind. However, religious belief does have features in common with the virtue of justice, and as such the latter provides an appropriate analogy for illuminating the former. First, religious belief does not spring from an "original principle," but it is neither unusual nor miraculous, and it depends upon faculties and circumstances</page><page sequence="8">178 TIMOTHY M. COSTELLOE supplied by nature. So polytheism, as Hume describes it in the Natural History, arises "from a concern with regard to the events of life, and from the incessant hopes and fears, which actuate the human mind" (NHR, 139), and theism develops from it "by a certain train of thinking, more suitable to [the] genius and capacity [of human beings]" (NHR, 154). Second, religious belief might well be non-natural when compared to belief in causality, but it is surely natural in that those "circumstances and necessities" which explain its origin are unavoidable features of human nature. One might push the analogy further and argue that, like justice, religious belief is only possible because nature both sets the problem (hopes, fears, irregularities, and convulsions in nature) for which religion is the solution, and provides the means (the capacity to be affected, incurable prejudice, and the tendency to believe) for the solution to come about. In the very least, that Hume is willing to under- stand the term "natural" as having "so loose a signification" - even to the point of dismissing the distinction between natural and artificial as merely a "verbal dispute" - undermines the attempt to draw so sharp a distinction between natural beliefs like causality and non-natural beliefs such as religion. "A general attendant of human nature" Hume's own refusal to draw a sharp distinction in this case is further reflected in the second reason for questioning the characterization of religious belief outlined above, namely, his refusal to state unequivocally whether or not such belief is natural. While he never claims that it is natural, neither does he rule that possibility out altogether. There are clearly passages where Hume seems committed to the latter position. In the Natural History, for instance, he writes that "Some nations have been discovered, who entertained no sentiments of Religion, . . . and scarce any two men, have ever agreed precisely in the same sentiments. It would appear, therefore, that this preconception springs not from an original instinct of primary impression of nature" (NHR, 134, emphasis added). Similarly, in a letter to Gilbert Elliot of Minto in March 1751, Hume admits that I cou'd wish that Cleanthes Argument [from design in the Dialogues] could be so analys'd, as to be render 'd quite formal &amp; regular. The propensity of the Mind towards it, unless that Propensity were as strong &amp; universal as that to believe in our Senses &amp; Experience, will still, I am afraid, be esteem'd a suspecious [sic] Foundation. We must endeavour to prove that this Propensity is somewhat different from our Inclination to find our own Figures in the Clouds, our Face in the Moon, our Passions and Sentiments even in inanimate Matter. Such an Inclination may, &amp; ought be control'd, &amp; can never be a legitimate Ground of Assent.10</page><page sequence="9">HUME ON BELIEF AND THE DEMISE OF RELIGION 1 79 Commenting on this passage, Gaskin claims that "the most straightforward reading of the conditional 'unless that propensity were as strong and universal as that to believe in our Senses and Experience' would suggest that Hume thinks the condition is not satisfied."11 Yet even this and the other passages are hardly as decisive as Gaskin claims. In the first, Hume qualifies his obser- vation by emphasizing how his view depends upon reports of "travellers and historians," and this leaves open the possibility that the empirical evidence and thus the nature of religious belief could be otherwise; and in the second, he does not deny a natural basis for religious belief at all - in fact, he charac- terizes it as a "propensity" - and his focus is on distinguishing theism from the superstitious tendency to anthropomorphize nature. This is reflected in the general argument of the Natural History which traces the "natural progress of human thought from vulgar forms of polytheism" to the theistic conception of "that perfect Being, who bestowed order on the whole frame of nature" (NHR, 135-136). On at least one occasion Hume also uses the Catholic religion to exemplify the natural associative principle of resemblance (EHU, 127). Given this apparent reticence on Hume's part to endorse the view that religion is non-natural - even in these passages which have been taken as evidence for precisely that12 - it is not surprising to find that elsewhere he is willing to characterize that belief in precisely those terms. Towards the beginning of the Natural History, for example, Hume declares that the "The whole frame of nature bespeaks an intelligent author, and no rational enquirer can, after serious reflection, suspend his belief a moment with regard to the primary principles of genuine theism" (NHR, 134); he remarks later that "Though the stupidity of men, barbarous and uninstructed, be so great, that they may not see a sovereign author in the more obvious works of nature, to which they are so much familiarized; yet it scarcely seems possible, that any one of good understanding should reject that idea, when once it is suggested to him" (NHR, 183). Hume also observes that the "universal propensity to believe in invisible, intelligent power, if not an original instinct, being at least a general attendant of human nature, may be considered as a kind of mark or stamp, which the divine workman has set upon his work" (NHR, 184). A similar view is apparent in Hume's suggestion that "The doctrine of one supreme deity, the author of nature, is very ancient, has spread itself over great and populous nations, and among them has been embraced by all ranks and conditions of men" (NHR, 153). In the History of England Hume also reports on Earpwold, king of East-Anglia who was "unable to resist those allurements [of religion], which have seduced the wisest of mankind" {History I, 39), and on King Canute who, as his life drew to a close, "began to cast his view towards that future existence, which it is so natural for the</page><page sequence="10">1 80 TIMOTHY M. COSTELLOE human mind, whether satiated by prosperity or disgusted with adversity, to make the object of its attention" {History I, 124). Further, in the Dialogues, Cleanthes appeals to a mitigated scepticism to show how only the artificiality of "obstinate metaphysics" could undermine "common sense and the plain instincts of nature," which would otherwise lead one to an intelligent designer; and, by analogy with sight, Cleanthes challenges Philo to reject honestly whether "the idea of a contriver does not immediately flow in upon you with a force like that of sensation" (DNR, 56). Indeed, this is the only point in the Dialogues where Cleanthes is at a loss to defend his position. Hume has the narrator, Pamphilus, report that after Cleanthes speech "Philo was a little embarrassed and confounded: But while he hesitated in delivering an answer, luckily for him, Demea broke in upon the discourse, and saved his countenance" (DNR, 57). 13 Hume expresses similar sentiments in his discussion of miracles. He claims to have discovered an argument that will be an "everlasting check to all kinds of superstitious delusion, and consequently, [which] will be useful as long as the world endures. For so long, I presume, will accounts of miracles and prodigies be found in all history, sacred and profane" (EHU, 169). Hume might well find such sentiments non-rational, but he does not conclude from this that sounder reasoning will ever eradicate them entirely.14 "In every civilized community " So far I have suggested that the characterization of religious belief as non- natural is useful for setting it apart from other beliefs such as necessary connection, continued existence, and self-identity. The latter clearly are of a different order in that loss of conviction with respect to them would involve undermining the order of existence. At the same time, however, the parallels with justice, Hume's own remarks on the looseness of the term "natural," and his unwillingness to deny or confirm unequivocally a natural basis for religion, combine to cast doubt on the view that, according to Hume, it is a mistake to understand religious belief as "natural" in some sense of that term. If this assessment is correct, and a case can be made for the natural char- acter of such belief, then the further claim that reflection on the evidence will lead rational enquirers to reject religious belief as an expendable fiction loses much of its force. This does not change the fact that the evidence for belief in natural and rational beliefs is different in kind (one is empirically available while the other is not), but that is to speak of the justification for the belief in each case; it does not impugn what I have argued with respect to their origins. In fact, Hume seems to think that reflection confirms belief, as he says, by "establishing] it on a firmer and more durable foundation" (NHR, 154): "For men, being taught, by superstitious prejudices, to lay stress on a</page><page sequence="11">HUME ON BELIEF AND THE DEMISE OF RELIGION 181 wrong place," he writes, "when that fails them, and they discover, by a little reflection, that the course of nature is regular and uniform, their whole faith totters, and falls to ruin. But being taught, by more reflection, that this very regularity and uniformity is the strongest proof of design and of a supreme intelligence, they return to that belief, which they had deserted; and they are now able to establish it on a firmer and more durable foundation" (NHR, 154). This conclusion can also be supported from another direction, by emphasizing, that is, Hume's apparent view that sociologically - or in Hume's language, morally - speaking, religion of some sort is both a necessary and a desirable part of any flourishing society. This might sound like an extravagant claim given Hume's many ironic and sometimes hostile remarks towards reli- gion and religious institutions. His well-known denigration of the monkish virtues (EPM, 146; NHR, 163) is matched elsewhere by his slights against the "monkish writers [and] historians" (see History II, 82, 88, 328 passim), and he hardly misses an opportunity to comment on corruption and hypocrisy in the Catholic Church (History I, 56, 99, 312-3; II, A passim), the absurdity of its doctrines (the real presence in particular) (History I, 52; NHR, 167 passim), and the gullibility of those who accept them (History I, 92, 147 passim). Cromwell and the excesses of Protestant enthusiasm fair little better (see, for example, History VI, 55ff.). In the History of England generally Hume clearly revels in the apparently endless supply of events and phenomena ripe for ridicule: the debate over whether Jesus was the natural or adoptive son of God (History I, 54), for example; the Church's condemnation of a certain fashion in long-pointed shoes under William the Conqueror (History I, 241-242); Edward the Confessor's purported ability to ward of Evil (History I, 147); the whole business of the Crusades - that "most signal and most durable monu- ment of human folly, that has yet appeared in any age or nation" (History I, 234); the extraordinary powers attributed to Joan of Arc (History II, 397ff.), and the Dutchman burned for heresy under Edward VI who "suffered with so much satisfaction," Hume relates, "that he hugged and caressed the faggots, that were consuming him." This amounts to a "species of frenzy," Hume adds dryly, "of which there is more than one instance among the martyrs of that age" (History III, 367). On other occasions, however, Hume willingly accepts that religion has a positive role to play. He writes sympathetically of the civilizing influence of Christianity on the early Saxon kingdoms where it opened up commerce and communication with Continental Europe (History I, 51-52), and he empha- sizes the importance of religion in maintaining "those secret links, without which it is impossible for human society to subsist." Thus writing of England under Henry III, Hume acknowledges that "the influence of the prelates and the clergy was often of great service to the public [since it] ... served to unite</page><page sequence="12">1 82 TIMOTHY M. COSTELLOE together a body of men who had great sway over the people, and who kept the community from falling to pieces, by factions and independent power of the nobles" (History II, 14). Hume also comments on the role of ecclesiastics who, as men of learning, encouraged the progress of jurisprudence in the latter part of the fifteenth century under Edward V and Richard III (History II, 520), and says of the monasteries prior to their disestablishment under Henry VIII that, although "Scarce any institution can be imagined less favourable, in the main, to the interests of mankind than that of monks and friars; yet was it followed by many good effects, which, having ceased by the suppression of monasteries, were much regretted by the people of England" (History III, 368-369). In general, Hume emphasizes how "there must be an ecclesiastical order, and a public establishment of religion in every civilized community" (History III, 134-135), for while ecclesiasts "bring no particular advantage or pleasure to any individual," their office remains "useful and even necessary" to counterbalance the "disorderly affections of the human frame" and the "natural tendency to pervert the true [religion], by infusing into it a strong mixture of superstition, folly, and delusion" (History III, 135-136).15 It is ultimately this emphasis on the perversion of "true" religious senti- ments by the vagaries of human nature that runs as a common thread through Hume's apparently contradictory remarks on religion. Religious belief itself is less of an issue for Hume than the "false" forms into which the obstruc- tions of "education, prejudice, and passion" force it (EPM, 94). Thus in those passages where Hume criticizes religion, he is careful to trace the phenomenon in question to superstition, enthusiasm, and the various passions which characterize the "spirit of the age." These result not from the possi- bility of living a religious life or cultivating a belief in the divine, but are the consequence of the human failure to "judge of things by their natural, unprejudiced reason" (EPM, 146). Conclusion In conclusion, however, it is important to emphasize that "true" religion which follows from this lack of prejudice is a sort of perfection which is rarely if ever attained. It is akin to "true" philosophy which, in Hume's view, anatomizes and explains the various systems of metaphysics or morals, but without winning many followers or removing the tendency for philosophers to explain reality through principles filled with speculative absurdity. As Hume expresses himself in the Treatise, although he considers his reasoning to be the "shortest and most decisive imaginable; yet with the generality of readers," he continues, "the biass [sic] of the mind will prevail, and give them a prejudice against the present doctrine" (T, 1 12); he doubts that even the most</page><page sequence="13">HUME ON BELIEF AND THE DEMISE OF RELIGION 1 83 impressive discoveries will win him "many proselytes to ... [his] opinion" (T, 81). In a similar way, although "true" religion anatomizes and explains the various systems of religious belief, Hume does not think that his conclusions will either convert the vulgar from their favorite superstitions or overcome their propensity to accept religious doctrines full of speculative absurdity. Both religious belief and the tendency for it to be perverted are "general attendants of human nature," and while Hume might disparage Catholicism and other forms of institutional religion, he is far from convinced that what he takes to be its patent absurdities will ever disappear: "But to these doctrines [of our brethren the Catholics]," he remarks at one point in the Natural History, "we are so accumstomed, that we never wonder at them: Though in a future age, it will probably become difficult to persuade some nations, that any human, two-legged creature could ever embrace such principles. And it is a thousand to one, but these nations themselves shall have something full as absurd in their own creed, to which they will give a most implicit and most religious assent" (NHR, 168). There might be good reason here and elsewhere to doubt the degree of Hume's own religious convictions, but there is far less to support the view that he was hostile to religion as such, hoped for its eventual demise, or thought that his philosophical inquiries could ever touch the deeply held convictions that constitute faith and religious belief.16 Notes 1.

Schneewind, The Invention of Autonomy: A History of Modern Moral Philosophy (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1998), pp. 374-376. Schneewind, it should be emphasized, does not see Hume providing a warrant for our belief or what he calls a "calculus of reform," but does conclude that Hume's "theory could . . . easily be turned in that direction; and his attack on the monkish virtues points the way" (p. 377).</page><page sequence="14">1 84 TIMOTHY M. COSTELLOE Cf. Donald Siebert, The Moral Animus of David Hume (Newark: University of Delaware Press, 1990), chap. 2, who writes that "Hume is ... pessimistic that religious belief will simply disappear once philosophy brings it to light" since its origins are part of "the very essence of human psychology: the fear of existence; ignorance of causes; the resulting desperation to find security in a hostile universe" (p. 64). For a discussion of the various responses to Hume's remarks on religion in the History, see Laurence L. Bongie, David Hume: Prophet of the Counter-Revolution, 2nd edn.

Gaskin, "God, Hume, and Natural Belief," p. 89, who rejects Cleanthes arguments as Hume's own, and thus as evidence for his view that religious belief is natural, with the observation that "this part of Cleanthes' case is not endorsed by Philo." One might emphasize in turn that it is certainly not rejected by him either. 14. See Donald T. Siebert, "Hume on Idolatry and Incarnation," Journal of the History of Ideas 45/3 (July-September 1984), p. 394, who remarks that "Hume seems to recognize that man needs to invest objects with significance, that he is a contriver of symbols, a Vates or Maker. The recognition of this fact in the NHR [Natural History of Religion], as it probably is in most of Hume's philosophy, is grudging and somewhat disapproving. But it exists nonetheless."
