Eduardo Paolozzi's is the acceptable face of public art: his many completed commissions in England and Germany bear witness to that. His qualifications are similar to those of a well respected architectural firm: dependable, with a good record for delivery on time and to cost, whose work can be relied upon even if it no longer surprises. Paolozzi's practice even re? sembles an architect's. He prepares on paper, from pre-formed elements, the basic designs for the works which are taken on and converted into working drawings or models by an assistant or model-maker. The model is handed to the fac? tory, the drawings to the craftsman. The artist's early ideas were drawn both from the European art-world of Paris soon after the war, especially Jean Dubuffet's work, and the investigations in England of the Independent Group at the ICA. There, popular iconography received attention previously bestowed on fine art. This all had a touch of surrealist revolt about it (the Surrealists had been interested in other cultures, even photographs) and happily confronted high art. Paolozzi's scrapbook col? lages, some shown here, take precisely those combinations of material. They construct con? flicts we now think of as tediously familiar and, incidentally, often seem reminiscent of the double spreads of Vers une architecture. To cul? tural artefacts he added an overlay of the new romance subject, technology, and embraced it whole-heartedly. He succeeds when that techno? logy is anthropomorphic ? robots, mechanical extravagances ? but the subject often slips through his fingers when it becomes imperson? ally electronic. Printed circuits are too close to the printed matter of fine art and too common to arouse the same sort of excitement. Compare the water-cooling tower in Pimlico (with its elements reminiscent of his 1964 sculp? ture Poem for the Trio MRT) with Collage over African Sculpture of 1960. In the latter the mechanics menace the African sensibility; there is a strongly defined confrontation and an im? plied critical stance. The Pimlico work, by com? parison, is decorative. Its elements sit uneasily below a cosmetic version of the machinery that Paolozzi used to enjoy for its brutality. The roles are reversed, for Paolozzi impresses natu? ral forms onto his loosely-fitted panels. The work does not fail because Paolozzi cannot handle this scale (he has proved he can many times before), but perhaps because he has ac? cepted a compromising site and position. The architecture around his works often lacks any distinctive quality other than suiting a particular developer's demands and is clad in a facade con? trived to be least offensive to its surroundings. Art is an acceptable embellishment that en? hances the 'quality' of the product, and too often seeks to prove the sophistication of the de? veloping team. So much of the work by contem? porary artists that has been dropped like the 'turd on the plaza' is itself compromised by these associations. Its ability to operate as a work of art is questioned by its role as insurer of quality. Artists have played safe in public situ? ations where they most need to be subversive. Perhaps that is why Oldenburg's works are still the best. His relatively simple strategy of enlarg? ing a valued every-day artefact (winning the populist vote whilst alerting the art public to a possible subversion) is fortuitously uncompro? mising. It makes its statement without reference, necessarily, to the architecture or the introverted inspections of the modernist aesthetic.

Paolozzi has increasingly placed himself within the canon by both the formal sobriety of the work and those he has chosen to commemorate. His work is about the culture of modernism using modern materials and icons, and can thus look almost cosy in such surroundings. Piscator, outside the Euston office block, is a thankfully uncomfor? table work and it suggests a willingness, at least, to begin confronting again. Its lumpenness and the difficulty of retaining the image in your mind are positive virtues in such barren sur? roundings. Paolozzi seems to work best with new ma? terials. 1974, for example, is a vintage year when he produced the Ravel Suite of prints, the Kot busser Dam Pictures and was working towards the publication of the Charles Rennie Mackin? tosh suite of 1975. The elements in these prints, principally electrical and musical, were handled with a new assurance and vigour that may have come in part from the move to Berlin itself. He left to that city what is, for me, his best public work, the drawing on the wall that marks the end of the wasteland of the newly developed K?rfurstendamm. That work has vitality, an ac? curate match of scale to surroundings and an edginess not found elsewhere. Often I wish that 'works of art in public places' were on fixed term contracts, renewable of course, and could be jettisoned when they became anonymous or unacceptable. The K?rfurstendamm mural would certainly have remained for me but not, it seems, for Berliners. It has been masked by a species of post-modernist bank of no great inter? est whose facade may help to stitch the gaping wounds of the urban fabric a little but whose backside is sitting on a rare and good public art work. He has not found the edge in the recent Lon? don Transport murals, where the material has become hackneyed and the technique loses the crisp line and the fine detail of his earlier work. Paolozzi's compromise at Tottenham Court Road may have been to believe that a new method of making the image would vitalize his images ? sadly it does not. For my money David Gentleman's whimsical graphic nostalgia at Charing Cross is more appropriate (and more easily removed). The tendency is to decorate a place where competitive and changing decora? tions are provided by the advertisers and where art's energies look misplaced and impossibly highbrow. And where the accidents of handi? craft and facture appear clumsy and ham-fisted by comparison. This exhibition offered a welcome chance to review the public parts of a career of astonishing energy and productive capacity. My disappoint? ment was that the art had been too often com? promised by its situation and, instead of being a dazzling society hostess, looked occasionally like an ageing and too-made-up woman of pleasure.
