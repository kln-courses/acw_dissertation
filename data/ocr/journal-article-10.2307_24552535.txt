<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOKS RECEIVED Bain, Iain. The Watercolors and Drawings of Thomas Bewick and His Workshop Apprentices. Cambridge, MIT Press, 1981. Two volumes. 463 pp. Copious illustrations. $250. Bewick is best known for his wood engrav ing. But "the background of his working life as a copperplate printer and trade engraver on metals has never been thoroughly understood. Likewise, the world is still very largely ignorant of Bewick as a draughtsman and colourist. ..." All this is set magnificently right in these two superbly produced volumes, the first being a history of the 19th-cen tury artist with plentiful illustrations, including those for the General History of the Quadrupeds, the second claiming Bewick's place as a kind of British Audubon, with figures and vignettes from History of British Birds and Fables of Aesop and Others. The birds were done in pen and watercolor, with trans fer drawings by Bewick for the engravings in his book, seen here in high-fi reproduction. Bartlett, Jennifer. In the Garden. New York, Harry N. Abrams, 1982. 208 pp. 197 illustrations, 133 in color. $35. Bartlett has worked on the same sub ject—the garden of a villa she lived in in Southern France, with pool, urinating cupid statue, and background cypresses—for 15 months, and in every conceivable medium—pencil and colored pencil, pen and ink, brush, crayons, charcoal, wa tercolor, oil, pastel, and gouache, to name some. Variations and permutations and transformations abound—the boy and pool majestically framed by trees, abstraction from the scene, naturalistic and freer interpretations, studies of the statue itself, in some of which he takes on Galatea-like life—the artist's passionate inventiveness seems endless. John Russell supplies an introduction in which he traces the evolution of Bartlett's work from her early baked enamel pieces to the multimedia Grace land Mansion and Rhapsody. The Gardens, says Rus sell, are "equal parts risk and research, objectivity and pandemonium." A harmonious pandemo nium, always. Bronner, Stephen, and Kellner, Douglas, eds. Passion and Rebellion: The Expressionist Heritage. New York, Universe Books, 1983. 448 pp. 24 illustrations. $35. An anthology with the anything-but-modest ambition of offering "a new beginning for under standing Expressionism as a socio-cultural move ment." Douglas Kellner starts off with a "reinter pretation of Expressionism" — "Expressionism is not only important as an artistic phenomenon, but also as a social movement and integral part of the emergence of twentieth-century culture and con sciousness. ..." Expressionism is further de scribed as "a late development in the series of ro mantic anti-capitalist revolts that emerged in the nineteenth century," with Nietzsche as a chief in fluence. Then come the essays: Harry Pachter writes on "Expressionism and Cafe Culture," while Arthur Mitzman holds forth on "Anarchism, Expressionism, and Psychoanalysis," taking up coke-fiend Otto Gross, who was subjected to an "around-the-clock treatment" by Carl Jung, at the end of which they were both reduced to "nodding automatons." There are essays on Kafka, early Expressionist poetry, Kandinsky ("Spiritualism vs. Technology"), Fritz Lang, and Marxism.

Michael Hoffman has supplied a preface for this second edition of White's masterwork, first published in 1969: "Mirrors/Messages/Manifestations ultimately is an experimental book, its richness available for viewers who engage it with their own inner experience." In other words, you either like White or you don't; are part of the cult, or aren't. The photographs—rock formations, interiors, city, country, male nudes, female portrait heads, and on—are, for the large part, beautiful, but there's always something of the mystique to them. White's writings—"is it you or I who says/out of my love for you/I will give you back yourself'—are embar rassing, amateur poetry or, the prose, amateur criticism. We'll stick with his more solid photo graphs, those in which he is at his most improvisa tory with nature, and forego the rest. This is a case of a mythos almost obscuring a body of work.
