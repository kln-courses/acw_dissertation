<plain_text><page sequence="1">A TECHNIQUE FOR TESTING UNIFIED CONCEPTS IN SCIENCE Guy E. Buckingham and Richard E. Lee Allegheny College In the controversy about the relative value of essay and objective-type tests which continues unabated, little constructive criticism is to be found. A few significant efforts such as those of Tyler1 at Ohio State University, in biology have appeared. We have been advised by Down ing2 that in the teaching of science, the emphasis should be shifted from the manipulative training to interpretative training. However, no def inite suggestions are given for testing the results of the interpretative training. Educational writings on the secondary level continue to be replete with the idea that students should be taught to think. The procedures in this respect have been many and varied. In the secondary schools, there seems to be a definite trend toward forcing the student into assimi lation and organization of science-type subject matter. Some emphasis is being placed on teaching the students how to read during assimilation. A great deal of talking and writing is being done about the teacher as a director of learning. Following the advice about the assimilation tech nique, there comes a barrage of advice to the effect that students should be taught how to organize material supposedly assimilated. Also, it is possible to find educational literature suggesting that this organization procedure should continue to the point where the student of his own power and volition forms at least tentative judgments from the assimi lated materials. Exact procedures for this process are usually lacking. On the college level the situation is quite different. The student is usually faced with two alternatives. He is either given some instruc tion on How to Study and English Composition of an analytical type, or he is thrown into a situation where he is bombarded with information which he is supposed to organize. The training for organization in the latter case is incidental and comes mainly from quizzes and final examina tions. Obviously, little constructive training can be given in this manner. 1 Tyler, Ealph W.

Since the psychology of learning throws grave doubt on the amount of the transfer, it appears that a student in either case receives little direct aid in or ganizing his materials. The testing procedure in the secondary school is certainly not parallel with the instruction procedure. Much of the testing is of the objective type. It consists merely of sampling statements in various forms. The more detailed this sampling becomes, the less closely it fits the increasing emphasis on assimilation and organization. It is argued that to answer correctly a sample statement removed from its original setting pre supposes a knowledge of the original setting. Let us assume that this is correct. Does it follow that the recognition of a statement removed from its former setting implies an ability to recall the setting in such detail as to be able to reproduce the setting ? A grave doubt comes to mind at this point. And, is it not this setting or one similarly constructed by the student that is the goal of all science-type instruction? The de tailed statements in their inter-relationships demand construction into meaningful wholes. The testing procedure in higher education is partly objective and partly essay in type. The criticisms above apply equally to objective type testing on the college level. It seems quite generally admitted that subjective essay-type tests in their present form cannot be evaluated fairly. Are we presented with a dilemma? Or, have we merely paused in thinking our way through the problem? Why can we not test for in formation objectively and follow this test with a more objective pro cedure centered around the actual process of organizing the materials demonstrated by the objective test to be in the students' possession but only in r?cognitive form? In writing any theme or thesis certain characteristics of data are de sirable. Of course, unity and coherence are expected. The composition procedure on the secondary and college level, however, usually must stop prior to the requiring of such exacting standards as correctness, pertinency, and adequacy of data within specific fields. It must merely hope that the characteristics possible to be developed in composition will be retained and applied in some future time when the student is con fronted with these more exacting standards. There seems to be no good reason why all of these characteristics cannot be developed integrally in the subject matter in science teaching.</page><page sequence="3">22 JOUBNAL OF EDUCATIONAL BESEABCE [Vol. 30, No. 1 The authors, Professor Lee of the division of Natural Sciences and Professor Buckingham of the division of Education in Allegheny Col lege, Meadville, Pennsylvania, have attempted such a procedure. Doc tor Lee is responsible for developing the unified content of the course "Natural Science Survey'' which is taken by all freshmen entering Allegheny College. Doctor Buckingham is responsible for developing the teaching and testing methods of the course. A definite attempt is being made to keep the teaching and testing techniques parallel. The course consists of a unitary approach to the field of science. All departmental terms such as chemistry, physics, biology, astronomy and geology are treated as pieces of the total picture called science. The materials are presented by lecture and oral quizzes. The quiz sections are small and are presided over by instructors. An attempt is made in both lectures and quiz sections to develop prin ciples keeping clearly in mind such characteristics as correctness, perti nency and adequacy of data. At first, these principles reside as wholes only in the instructor's way of thinking. Little by little the plan is spread before the student. First, he is given information. Second, he is shown how to put this information together. Third, he is given a complete picture of the principle which he has helped to put together. Great stress is being placed on the process of putting together the in formation. During the semester the student is given a true-false test of some three hundred items, in two parts, which is designed to test information only. The test scores are so interpreted. A student scoring low in either part is informed that he does not possess enough information to think with, and is advised to re-study the range of the course which the test covered. At the end of each semester the student is given an organization test. A similar test is taken at the end of the sophomore year. The purpose of the course is science orientation. Since the purpose of the course is to have a student able to think correctly in a scientific manner, the sophomore test is not concerned with more and more informa tion. Information is supplied on the test form. The student is asked to think scientifically with this information. In order that the test procedure may be clear to the reader, a sample test filled in by a student and marked by an instructor is printed below.</page><page sequence="4">September, 1936] TESTING CONCEPTS IN SCIENCE 23 COMPREHENSIVE EXAMINATION in NATURAL SCIENCE SURVEY (Foundations and the Physical Sciences) General Instructions READ CAREFULLY You are to write a thesis entitled : A Picture of the Universe in Terms of Modern Scientific Concepts.

Having completed the foregoing assignments, proceed with the writing of the thesis in terms of the above material and such additional material as may be necessary to present a complete and clear picture. ' ' The modern concept of the universe, that is, all there is, is of interlocking sys tems, from the universe to the electron, the known extremes at the present time. All of this system of systems is electrical stuff?the fundamental thing of the uni verse. This stuff is found in innumerable aspects, but all of which come under two headings, radiation and matter. "When this stuff is found in a loose arrangement it is known as radiation, taking the form of waves. The waves, travelling at a rate of 186,300 miles per second, group themselves together into bundles, or quantum. They move through the attraction of electrical stuff for itself. This radiation, or energy moves from high to low energy factors. To explain, heat is transferred from a hot stove to a piece of ice, but not vice versa. The size of these waves is determined by the speed of their vibration, that is, the speed at which quanta follow quanta in the wave stream. The shorter the wave the faster the vibration; the product of both factors is a constant. The shortest known waves are the cosmic. The electro-magnetic spectrum runs *Errors are marked with an asterisk.</page><page sequence="6">September, 1936] TESTING CONCEPTS IN SCIENCE 25 from the cosmic, thru gamma rays, x-rays, light waves, radio and wireless telegraph waves, to long electro-magnetic waves. But all are fundamentally the same: the only difference is in their length and speed of vibration. It is this aspect of the fundamental stuff which accounts for change and movement in the universe. "The other aspects is the permanent: matter. Perhaps the smallest known system of this aspect, tho' it is not itself matter, the electron, is nothing but waves pursuing a fixed course, a contracted course. The electrons are built into atoms, the smallest material system, and then into molecules, and into compounds and mixtures and increasingly larger systems. An atom consists of positive charges of electricity counter-balanced by negative, i. e., in the order named, protons and electrons. Atoms, of which there are 92 principal types (elements), are regarded today as either cubical or planetary in form, with the nucleus or center being mostly positive, with electrons on the outside. The attraction of these atoms for each other forms the larger material systems. "This matter is found in two aspects, inorganic and organic. The principal difference is in the mode of repose. The physical basis for organic matter is proto plasm, a complex compound of ordinary physical stuff. Living systems are built out of this stuff. The highest aspect of organic stuff is the psychic. "Together with these two concepts must be added those dealing and connected with them, evolution, relativity, and space-time. Evolution is the constant change in the universe, happening everywhere, evolving new systems out of old. Relativity and space-time are modern ideas. Everything is relative from where and when we are. Space-time is not an entity, merely a nominal condition in which electrical stuff is found." The problem of marking a test of this type is rather complex. Our procedure was as follows : Doctor Lee and his staff arbitrarily decided that parts I, II, III and IV of the test should have weights of 25, 25, 5, and 45 percent, respect ively. It is a simple matter to mark parts I and II by this method. Parts III and IV required the subjective type of marking. The weight ing and marking were done without the knowledge or aid of Buckingham. This sample paper was given a mark of "B." Parts I, II, III, and IV were marked 23, 21, 3, and 40 percent, respectively, making a total of 87 percent. Ideally it would be desirable to consider each desirable characteristic of a test separately. In reality this was done. For ex ample, Table II shows that the average failure marks of "E" and "F" were quite low in both pertinency and thesis. However, the average scores on correctness for the "E" and "F" marks were relatively high. Therefore, the scores in pertinency and thesis must have been the de termining factors in passing or failing these students rather than the total marks. After the marking had been finished, one good paper, one fair paper and one poor paper as determined by the total marks were pulled from the piles at random by Buckingham. Each part score, counting rights only in parts I and II, and using the percents given to parts III and IV, was turned into a fraction of the possible score, using 50 as the fractions' denominators. Table I below gives these results.</page><page sequence="7">26 JOUBNAL OF EDUCATIONAL BESEABCE [Vol. 30, No. 1 Instructor's Mark Good paper Fair paper Poor paper TABLE I Correctness Pertinency Adequacy Thesis 50/50 42/50 50/50 44/50 46/50 34/50 40/50 33/50 41/50 21/50 20/50 22/50 One is immediately aware of the uniformly high scores in correctness. The scores in pertinency, adequacy and thesis go down steadily from the good paper to the poor paper. There is a very close resemblance between the scores in pertinency and thesis. The outstanding contrast is between the scores in correctness and the scores in pertinency, ade quacy and thesis.

The numerators of the fractions were averaged for each group of students receiving "A" marks. This procedure was carried through the B, C, D, E, and P groups. The table should be read using numerators only. A study of this table shows a fairly wide discrepancy between cor rectness and pertinency. No trend is clear with respect to adequacy. Wide differences are present between'correctness and thesis, and between pertinency and thesis. However, there is closer relationship between pertinency and thesis than between correctness and thesis. Correctness correlates with thesis .21 ? .06 while pertinency correlates with thesis .25 ? .05. Five conclusions seem warranted: 1. There is the possibility of using one's memory alone to secure a high score in a true-false test. 2. There is the further possibility of securing this high score while simultaneously being unable to see the relationships between itemized</page><page sequence="8">September, 1936] TESTING CONCEPTS IN SCIENCE 27 true-false statements and a larger centralized thesis about which the true-false statements should be organized to have meaning. 3. It is necessary to go a step beyond objective testing for correct ness alone, in order to be sure that a student possesses both facts and the ability to organize them meaningfully. 4. Since there is as close a relationship between pertinency and thesis as between correctness and thesis, it would seem desirable to use some ob jective measure concerned with ability to construct inter-relationships in examining students in science. 5. If this method of testing has value in science it should have value in the field of social science to the extent to which procedures in the two fields are parallel. A definite use for the technique might be found in a situation where fact, opinion and propaganda should be separated.</page></plain_text>
