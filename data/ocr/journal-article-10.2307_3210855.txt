Basile he Brown University excavations of the Great Temple at Petra, conducted under the auspices of the Department of Antiquities of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, have produced a remarkable corpus of sculptures since work began at the site in 1993.' Among these, the elephant-headed capitals of the Lower Temenos colonnades have become well-known to Nabataean spe- cialists (see issue cover and Joukowsky above). But the site has also produced fragments of both monumental and small-scale sculpture in marble, limestone and sand- stone, carved theater masks, Ionic, Corinthian, plain-faced and elaborate Alexandrian-inspired floral capitals, molded plaster figures and stone and terracotta plaques and fig- urines. In addition, the excavations at the Temple have recovered a number of limestone relief bust pan- els, in the Hellenistic-Roman style, that may once have decorated the facade of the main Great Temple building of the Upper Temenos. Equally interesting are two stone objects excavated from the north end of the west cryp- toporticus of the Lower Temenos area in the 2001 season that are striking examples of the famous Nabataean rec- tangular betyls (standing stones). The presence of the betyls and the reliefs within the Temple complex pres- ent an interesting contrast in Nabataean art. The one reflects the adoption by the Nabataeans of Hellenistic-Roman forms of representation, while the other testifies to the persistence of an Arabian/Semitic tradition of depicting deities aniconically.- The result is an artisitc tradition that is uniquely Nabataean. The Great Temple is located in the "Central Valley" of Petra, south of the ravine of the Wadi Musa. The entire complex is massive, covering 7,560 square meters (see centerfold). The Propylaeum, or monumental entrance, leads to a huge courtyard called the Lower Temenos, the two elements together forming the massive lower courtyard that is the northern half of the site. The main Great Temple building is situated in the Upper Temenos, which makes up the southern half of the complex. The lower courtyard of the temple complex consists of a variety of structures, including the double cryptoportici (underground passages) on the west, north, and east, supporting massive triple colonnades and semi- circular exedrae that are aligned with the southern ends of the colonnades. Between the exedrae were the retaining wall of the Upper Temenos courtyard and three staircases leading up to the Great Temple building. Most of the relief panels were recovered from the vicinity of the East Exedra, the East Colonnade and the eastern end of the Retaining Wall in the Lower Temenos. The betyls, on the other hand, were found installed in a niche near the junction of the west and north cryptoportici of the Propylaeum complex. The relief busts were all excavated between 1997 and 2000. These pieces represent some of the most important sculptures yet recovered from the temple ruins, and some of the most beautiful in the Nabataean repertoire. A total of eight have been identified so far. All are of the same medium-grained limestone and worked in the same middle relief technique. They were all originally about ninety centimeters wide and share important characteristics such as a frame of cyma reversa (a kind of decorative border, classically inspired) with fillet. The figural reliefs depict both males and females and most have slots cut for the insertion of the head, which was made separately. All are worn and damaged. Everything about them, including their costumes and attributes, suggests Classical influence. They may be dated tentatively to the first three- quarters of the first century CE, and are thought to be part of a series of ten or twelve panels that originally decorated the face of the main temple building but were later reused in the Lower Temenos area (Schluntz 1999: 69-72).

A female figure with her right breast exposed, perhaps a maenad, Amazon or Aphrodite type, is clad in an elaborately- rendered chiton, and cut in a rough rectangle fifty-three centimeters in width for reuse in a late rubble wall laid between the columns of the middle row of the East Colonnade of the lower Temenos. The best-preserved of the figural panels, a Tyche-Fortuna type with cornucopia, was excavated from a layer of dense gray lime (associated with the postulated reuse of the Lower Temenos area as a lime kiln). Another relief depicts a triumphal wreath with fillet, built upside-down into the late wall, which runs between the columns of the center row of the East Colonnade. A male figure was built into a diagonal cross-wall of late construction that runs to the southernmost column of the middle column row of the East Colonnade. A damaged and cut-down female panel was recovered immediately adjacent to the male panel just described-the less well-preserved "twin" of the Tyche panel.

Finally, a panel depicting a veiled female bust, from the so-called Colonnaded Street, was recognized as probably belonging to the Great Temple relief carvings based on its dimensions and workmanship. Taken together, this corpus of eight relief panels from the Great Temple site constitutes an important collection of Nabataean sculpture, and may reveal aspects of the history and function of the site, as well as the history and stylistic development of Nabataean carving at Petra. Just as remarkable as the figural panels-or indeed as any of the representational sculpture recovered from the Great Temple site-are the pair of aniconic monuments excavated from the northwest comer of the site in 2001. Still set in plaster and installed in a niche, which was set into the center wall dividing the paired cryptoportici of the west side of the Propylaeum area, were two blank slabs of fine-grained white limestone with molded bases and slightly curved tops, measuring fifty centimeters high by twenty-one centimeters wide by nine centimeters thick (Joukowsky 2001: 5-6). These sculptures, of a type conventionally termed "portable betyls" by scholars, are thought to represent Nabataean deities in aniconic form- perhaps the chief deity, Dushara, and his consort Al-'Uzza, although it is difficult to know for sure-and also demonstrate that the Nabataeans shared in the well-known Arabian/Semitic tradition of forbidding "graven images" in many, if not all, sacred contexts (Wenning 2001: 80-81, 85-87; Patrich 1990: 50, 103). The pair represents one of the few examples of portable betyl types found both well- preserved and in situ (Wenning 2001: 86-87, n. 17). The chronology is uncertain at this point but the architectural features associated with the betyl pair probably date to before the end of the first century CE. Two Traditions Collide What explains the juxtaposition of a Hellenistic-Roman tradition of representational art and an Arabian/Semitic aniconic tradition at the Great Temple site? At first glance the coexistence of such antithetical tendencies within the same artistic repertoire seems contradictory. The injunction against representation is assumed to be nearly absolute in some religious-cultural traditions, but this was seemingly not so for the Nabataeans, although in many contexts representational art is rare (e.g., the tombs of Mada'in Saleh, the temples of Wadi Ramm and the Negev, and even most of the rock-cut tombs of Petra; see Patrich 1990: 117-19). The picture is obviously a complicated one and the precise attitude of the Nabataeans toward figural art is sometimes hard to discern. Indeed, building complexes decorated with relief busts and other kinds of representational art also often contained sacred betyls, or have been reconstructed as containing betyls. This is the case even within some of the most important structures of the Nabataean kingdom in the first centuries BCE and cE, including the Qasr Al-Bint and the Temple of the Winged Lions (both at Petra), the temple complex at Kirbet adh-Dharih and 256 NEAR EASTERN ARCHAEOLOGY 65:4 (2002)</page><page sequence="3">r N -r, I . 6ow W7 . ..

Drawing by Emily Catherine Egan. perhaps Khirbet et-Tannur as well (Wenning 2001: 86-87, n. 17; Patrich 1990: 50, 139). While there is still some debate as to the exact function of the Great Temple complex (e.g., Schluntz 1999: 82-135), archaeological evidence pointing towards a sacred use has been mounting (Joukowsky and Basile 2001: 47-49; 51; 54-57). In fact, architectural decoration of a representational or figurative nature combined with installations of aniconic portable betyl monuments, it could be argued, are typical of many of the most important Nabataean religious sites, except perhaps for the desert temples of Wadi Ramm and the Negev. One factor contributing to this phenomenon of mixed forms is almost certainly the nature of Hellenistic-Roman influence in Nabataea. This is also a complicated issue, however. We know relatively little about the origins of Nabataean civilization, and arguably even less about early Nabataean religious practices and the origins of monumental traditions in Nabataean art. The ancient Greek author Strabo tells us in his Geography that the Nabataeans refrained from making "embossed works, paintings, and molded works" (XVI.4.26). Some scholars have suggested that this really means they made no figures or representations. If this information is reliable (of which we cannot be certain) it suggests that the injunction against representation is one of the oldest Nabataean traditions. Therefore, the figure is a later arrival and may be the result of foreign contacts (Patrich 1990: 151-52). Indeed, the nature of Nabataean figurative art makes this quite likely. Scholars have detected a number of influences, including the sculptural traditions of the Moabite and Edomite kingdoms whose territories the Nabataeans came to control, the dynamic Parthian tradition of Mesopotamia and Iran, the Hellenistic traditions of Nabataea's western and northern neighbors (Ptolemaic Egypt, Seleucid Syria and Hasmonaean and Herodian Judaea) and of course the artistic traditions of the expanding Roman state (Zayadine 1991: 51-60; Patrich 1990: 114). The result was a sophisticated system of representational art combining Arabian, Near Eastern and Hellenistic-Roman elements-a system that is sometimes confusing to, and misunderstood by, modern scholars. If the aniconic tradition constitutes the "original" Naba- taean artistic expression, protected and strengthened by religious or social injunctions against repre- sentational art, what prompted Nabataean artists to adopt and develop figural systems, at least in some contexts? In truth, it is rare for prohibitions against "graven images" to be absolute in any society, as an examination of ancient Israelite art or Islamic art would show. And there is always a tension between the traditional aniconic systems of art and the dynamic, exotic, attractive figural traditions of outsiders. Then there is the matter of politics. Representational art-especially the mimetic traditions of the Hellenistic states-was a powerful weapon of propaganda, making compelling statements about the validity of the ruling elites, the benevolence of the gods and the moral excellence of the heroes. Representational art, with its ability to tell stories and confront the viewer with images from both the mythical and mortal worlds, is a much more useful tool in this regard than an aniconic system. Indeed, it could be argued that no burgeoning state of the first centuries BCE and CE could be without a representational, monumental system of official state- sponsored art. Nabataea was such a state, competing for regional power with the weakened Ptolemiac and Seleucid kingdoms, and then for the attention of the East's new master, Rome. Also, there was Herod of Judaea, a political genius who (usually) excelled at reconciling the ancient anti-iconic traditions of Judaism with the Hellenistic-Roman systems of art and architecture he used to advance his political ambitions (see e.g., Roller 1998). Thus, it is probably not a coincidence that much of the well-known representational art of the Nabataeans was made during the period from the reign of Aretas III through those of Obodas III and Aretas IV, that is, from between 87 BCE to 40 CE. This is the period of Nabataea's entry onto the political stage of the Hellenistic Near East, its pretensions to statehood on a level with the Hellenistic kingdoms and its rivalry with Judaea. The Nabataeans-or, more accurately, their ruling elites-developed a language of representational art for specific situations, like important public buildings, but not for others, like private tombs. In the process, they borrowed from neighboring traditions in order to advance a vigorous political agenda while at the same time preserving and protecting an ancient tradition of aniconic religious art well into the period of the Roman Provincia Arabia.

Two Traditions Merge What was the relative value of these two traditions? This is an extremely subjective question, certainly, but one that underlies many discussions of ancient artistic traditions. It was once common practice among archaeologists and art historians to favor realistic and mimetic expressions over formal, stylized, abstract or aniconic expressions. It was also commonplace to favor "primary" traditions over those that included substantial emulation or borrowing of forms-that is, "secondary" or "eclectic" traditions. The Nabataean artistic traditions stand at the intersection of many of these attitudes. The representational panels of the Great Temple might be lauded for their realism or rejected with other figural relief carvings as being wholly Hellenistic, without any apparent Nabataean contribution (e.g., Lyttleton and Blagg 1990: 99). The betyls might be viewed as retrograde or as the only genuine Nabataean artistic tradition, the source and font of Nabataean originality (Patrich 1990: 7, 49, 114). But these may be extreme views, and recently a number of scholars interested in Nabataean art have expressed more moderate views that seek to place the monuments within the context of the later part of antiquity in the Near East and in a more holistic fashion (e.g., McKenzie 1990). Indeed, an examination of just the art of the Great Temple site suggests a remarkably versatile and complex artistic tradition, one that seeks to reconcile ancient aniconic ideas and later representational systems and that combines Arabian, Transjordanian, Mesopotamian, Egyptian and Hellenistic-Roman traditions, not in a derivative pastiche but in something that is new and exciting and ultimately a product of the genius of their own artists-in short, one that is distinctly Nabataean. Thus, the relief panels and limestone beryls of the Great Temple did, and still do, coexist, and can tell us much about the art and culture of the spectacular Nabataean civilization.

"Aniconism" in its strictest sense involves no visual representation of the divinity in any form. However, the author uses the term in the context of Nabataean art to refer to representations of the divine that are non- anthropomorphic. References Joukowsky, M.
