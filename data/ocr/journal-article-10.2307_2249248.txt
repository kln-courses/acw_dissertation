BERTRAND RUSSELLS An Outline of Philosophy (which, perhaps, would have been better entitled An Outline of My Philosophy) bristles with controversial statements; and of the arguments it is often difficult to see the conclusiveness and sometimes even the nature. No adequate comments could be shorter than the book itself. Partly for this reason and partly because the weight of Mr. Russell's authority with the public is so great, I have obtained the Editor's leave to substitute for the critical notice which he asked me to write a short article intended to draw attention to two of Mr. Russell's main doctrines and to offer reasons for thinking them untenable. The one concerns the nature of knowledge and, more especially, of perception; the other concerns the nature of the physical world. It is, of course, difficult to give an outline of philosophy, as distinct from an outline of the greater philosophies, which is not in substance a summary of the writer's philosophy. But Mr. Russell seems to have tried so little to avoid this difficulty that it seems not illegitimate to begin by expressing certain reflections which his book has prompted in an in- dividual reader. I have, in reading it, found myself again and again reminded of a phrase applied by a non-philosophi- cal colleague to certain philosophers, viz., "those who say they believe what no man really can". I have found myself constantly wondering whether even Mr. Russell himself believes a fraction of the things which he implies that he 18</page><page sequence="2">266 H. A. PRICHARD: does, and whether he could not best render his great acute- ness of use to the world by scrapping all his present views and, in Cartesian manner, making a fresh start. I have even more been led to wonder whether a beginner would be well advised to introduce himself to philosophy by means of Mr. Russell's Outline, unless he is of those exceptional beings who is stung into trying to find out the truth for himself by reflecting that "whatever the truth may be, it cannot be this ". Otherwise, I have felt, the beginner will be led to think that much is common ground among philosophers which is highly controversial, as regards the nature both of the main problems and of their solution. Mr. Russell's account of the nature of knowledge is based on a distinction the reality of which he takes for granted, viz., a distinction between knowledge regarded objectively, i.e., viewed or observed by an observer other than the knower himself, and so observed as the behaviourist professes to observe it, and knowledge regarded subjectively, i.e., viewed or observed by the knower himself. In thus presupposing that knowledge and what he considers to be its special forms such as perception, memory, and inferential knowledge, can be regarded in both these ways, Mr. Russell is, of course, implying that knowledge is essentially complex, having at least two characteristics, one of which, however, can be directly known only by the knower himself, while the other can be directly known bnly by another knower. For knowledge, like anything else, can only be known to have a character- istic, if it has it whether it is known to have it or not, and the mere fact that two characteristics of something can only be directly known by different knowers, far from preventing its possession of both these characteristics, requires it to have them, whether it is known to have them or not. In accordance with this distinction, Mr. Russell offers in Part I. an account of man, including man's knowledge, re- garded objectively, and he follows this up in Part III. with an account of man, including man's knowledge, regarded from within. He considers the former account the more fruitful, although since he considers that man can be re- garded in both aspects, it is not obvious why he does not consider both accounts equally necessary. " Knowledge, traditionally, has been viewed from within, as some- thing which we observe in ourselves rather than as something which we can see others displaying. When I say that it has been so viewed, I mean that this has been the practice of philosophers; in ordinary life, people have been more objective. In ordinary life, knowledge is something which can be tested by examinations, that is to say, it</page><page sequence="3">MR. BERTRAND RUSSEtL'S OUTLINE OF PHILOSOPHY. 267 consists in a certain kind of response to a certain kind of stimulus. This objective way of viewing knowledge is, to my mind, much more fruitful than the way which has been customary in philosophy. I mean that, if we wish to give a definition of ' knowino,' we ought to define it as a manner of reacting to the environment, not as involving something (a 'state of mind') which only the person who has the knowledge can observe. It is because I hold this view that I think it best to bboin with Man and his environment, rather than with those matters in which the observer and the observed must be the same person. Knowing, as I view it, is a characteristic which may be dis- played in our reactions to our environment; it is therefore necessary first of all to consider the nature of these reactions as they appear in science." Nevertheless he considers that the behaviourist contention that knowledge can only be regarded in this objective way goes too far. "This philosophy, of which the chief protagonist is Dr. John B. Watson, holds that everything that can be known about man is dis- coverable by the method of external observation, i.e., that none of our knowledge depends, essentially and necessarily, upon data in which the observer and the observed are the same person. I do not fundamentally agree with this view, but I think it contains much more truth than most people suppose, and I regard it as desirable to develop the behaviourist method to the fullest possible extent. I believe that the knowledge to be obtained by this method, so long as we take physics for granted, is self-contained, and need not, at any point, appeal to data derived from introspection, i.e., from observa- tions which a man can make upon himself but not upon anyone else. Nevertheless, I hold that there are such observations and that there is knowledge which depends upon introspection." 2 In actual fact the detailed account given in Part I. of what Mr. Russell maintains to be knowledge, and its special forms, regarded objectively, is really an account of something which is not knowledge at all, viz., the physical process which is usually thought of, and referred to, as the physical conditions of knowledge, and the underlying presupposition of this ac- count must be that this physical process is the knowledge of which it is usually said to be the physical conditions. What may be called, at the lowest, the paradox of this presupposi- tion is not mitigated by urging, as no doubt Mr. Russell would, that e.g., the physical conditions of a certain process of perception are the process of perception as viewed by another observer. For if they are this process as viewed by an observer, they must be this process, whether it be thus viewed or not. We are, therefore, naturally led to expect that when Mr. Russell comes to give an account of know- ledge, known or observed from within, he will maintain, or at least imply, that the mental process in which, whatever 1Pp.20-21. 2p. 73</page><page sequence="4">268 H. A. PRICHARD: he may say, knowledge consists and which we know in bein'g self-conscious, is that physical process which is usually thought of as its physical conditions. And this turns out to be the case. In attempting to consider Mr. Russell's account of know- ledge, it will be necessary, for brevity's sake, to confine at- tention to his account of perceptive knowledge. And the limitation is defensible partly because he himself constantly insists on the importance of distinguishing what we know by observing, i.e. perceiving, it and what we know only as an inference from what we observe, and partly because many of the comments applicable to his account of perception are equally applicable to his account of other forms of knowledge. Although certain phrases suggest that Mr. Russell is only maintaining that what are usually called the physical condi- tions of knowledge, though not themselves the knowledge of which they are the conditions, are evidence of that knowledge to another observer, the main trend of his statements is decisive. "Suppose you are watching a race, and at the appropriate moment you say ' They're off '. This exclamation [subsequently said to be constituted by the movements of your throat and tongue] I is a re- action to the [physical] environment, and is taken to show knowledge if it is made at the same time as others make it. . . . This immensely complicated occurrence [viz., what has been ha'ppening in the physical world according to science] is, nevertheless, about the simplest example of knowledge that could possibly be given." 2 In the same vein Mr. Russell says: "Physiological inference (sic), in its simplest form, means this given a stimulus S, to which, by a reflex, we react by a bodily move- ment R, and a stimulus S' with a reaction R', if the two stimuli are frequently experienced together, S will in time produce R'. That is to say, the body will act as if S' were present." 3 Again, in a chapter entitled "Perception objectively re- garded," Mr. Russell writes as follows:- "Perception is a species of a wider genus, namely sensitivity. Sen- sitivity is not confined to living things; in fact it is best exemplified by scientific instruments. A material object is said to be ' sensitive' to such and such a stimulus if, when that stimulus is present, it be- haves in a way noticeably different from that in which it behaves in the absence of the stimulus. A photographic plate is sensitive to light, a barometer is sensitive to pressure, a thermometer to tem- perature, a galvanometer to electric current, and so on. In all these cases, we might say, in a certain metaphorical sense, that an instru- ment ' perceives' the stimulus to which it is sensitive. We do not Phrases in square brackets inserted in quotations from Mr. Russell are intended as elucidations of his meaning based on the context. 2P. 21.

BERTRAND RUSSELL'S OUTLINE OF PHILOSOPHY. 269 in fact say so: we feel that perception involves something more than we find in scientific instruments. What is this something more? " The traditional answer would be: consciousness. But this answer, right or wrong, is not what we are seeking at the moment, because we are considering the percipient as he appears to an outside observer, to whom his ' consciousness' is only an inference. Is there anything in perception as viewed from without that distinguishes it from the the sensitivity of a scientific instrument? . . . The chief difference is that living bodies are subject to the law of association or of the 'conditioned reflex' ." Mr. Russell's elucidation of the difference is obscure. The 'sensitivity' of a thing can only mean its capacity of being affected or acted on by something else, i.e., the capacity of being caused by some other thing to undergo a change of state, as when the state of a photographic plate is altered by the action upon it of a source of light. And the view implicit in what Mr. Russell goes on to say appears to be as follows: In some cases something sensitive A is not only affected by a stimulus, but reacts on its environment, i.e., it is not only affected by a thing X but in consequence, it also reacts on some other thing Y. Thus an automatic machine is not only affected by the penny inserted but causes chocolate to emerge. But where this reaction occurs two species of case have to be distinguished. The character of the reaction may depend wholly on the nature and state of the body called the stimulus, as happens in the case of the automatic machine, and also when an intense source of light acting on the muscles of the eye at birth causes the muscles to contract the iris. In such cases the process is what is called a reflex or an 'unconditioned reflex, but it is not perception. But the character of the reaction may depend partly on the sensitive body A's being also affected by some body other than the stimulus in consequence of something called 'association'- whatever that term may mean whenl applied to bodies-as when the eye of a child after a certain age follows the move- ment of a source of light; and in such cases the process is what is called a conditioned reflex and is perception.2 In a similar way in a chapter entitled 'Memnory Objec- tively Regarded ' he treats of memory " so far as it can be I Pp. 62-63. 2 It is hardly necessary to point out that Mr. Russell and those whom he follows could not have arrived at this view of what distinguishes what they consider to be perception objectively regarded from other physical processes, unless they had already distinguished processes of perception proper, or what they call perception, subjectively regarded, from other mental processes, and had come to think of processes of perception proper as dependent on these special physical processes which they are maintain- ing to be perception objectively regarded.</page><page sequence="6">270 H. A. PRICHARD: made a matter of external observation," i.e., as a physical fact. -Again in Chapter VIII., entitled "Knowledge Be- haviouristically Regarded," knowledge gets its turn. Here, unfortunately, Mr. Russell's language is very indefinite, and though he subsequently I speaks of having given a behaviourist definition of knowledge, he does not in fact give one. Never- theless, in this chapter, although he betrays a feeling of un- easiness by habitually applying the term " knowledge " to certain physical processes only in inverted commas, a practice as unsatisfactory as the use of words in Pickwickian senses, it is clear that he means that knowledge objectively regarded is a physical process. In Chapter XIX. of Part III., entitled " The Introspective Analysis of Perception," Russell gives his account of per- ception viewed from within. He invites us2 by an act of introspection to attend to the act of perception which would ordinarily be described by saying "I see a triangle," and asks us to consider what in this act of introspection we are immediately certain of. He urges that since the meaning of " I " depends on memory and expectation, " I " should be omitted from the description of this something, and we should at least substitute, " A triangle is being seen." He then urges that since " seen," as ordinarily used, is a causal word suggesting something dependent on the eyes, this term should disappear also, and that since all objects of sight have a common quality, which no objects of touch or hearing have, we should replace, "A triangle is being seen" by " There is a visual triangle." In other words, what we refer to as our seeing a triangle is really a visual triangle, this visual triangle being what we become immediately certain of in introspection. This visual triangle is a species of what Mr. Russell calls a " percept." Unfortunately he gives no explanation of what he means by a " percept," but judging by his instances, e.g., a colour, patches of colour situated in visual space,4 a visual triangle,' sounds,6 he appears to mean what Locke would have called the idea of a secondary quality, and although in Chapter XIX. he is anxious to distinguish perception and sensation, he would, if pressed, probably accept " a sensation " or at least " a complication of sensations," as an equivalent to a " percept." 7 Thus accord- ing to Mr. Russell a perception viewed from within is a sensation or, at least, a complication of sensations, or, if he would object to this statement, it is the genus of which I E.g., p. 225. 2 Pp. 215-216. 3 Cf. p. 139. 4p. 146. 5P. 216. 6P. 144. 7 Cf. p. 145 ad fin.</page><page sequence="7">MR. BERTRAND RUSSELL'S OUTLINE OF PHILOSOPHY. 271 colours, sounds, tastes, smells and feelings of touch are the species. Here it must at least be allowed that Mr. Russell is not describing perception at all, but, if anything, what we per- ceive. For at best it can only be true that colours or sounds are what we see or hear, and not our seeing or hearing some- thing. For the same reason it must equally be allowed that Mr. Russell's previous description of perception regarded from without is mistaken. A physical process in our brain cannot be a perception, but at best only what we perceive. Further, if the two accounts of perception are considered in combination, we see that Mr. Russell is involved in maintain- ing that a certain process in our brain and what he calls a percept, e.g., a patch of colour, or a sound, are one and the same thing. The doctrin6 is so astonishing that it is difficult to believe that Mr. Russell can be maintaining it. Yet Chapters XII. and XIII., the really critical chapters on perception, are in fact devoted to expounding it. In Chapter XII. Mr. Russell develops as if they were one what are really two different lines of argument. These are to the effect (1) that if the behaviourist account of perception is true, perception will inevitably be inaccurate, and (2) that the behaviourist is mistaken about what it is that an observer observes, i.e., what it is that a percipient perceives in the mental and only legritimate sense of " perceive," and that in consequence the behaviourist account of perception, though true as far as it goes, is not the whole truth. Here the reader will find himself unable to follow Mr. Russell's thought, unless he is prepared to allow that Mr. Russell is tacitly presupposing what he afterwards goes on to maintain explicitly, viz., that certain brain processes and " percepts" are one and the same thing. "According to the [behaviourist] theory of Chapter V., it is pos- sible to perceive things that are not in spatial contact with the body. There must be a reaction to a feature of the environment, but that feature may be at a greater or less distance from the body of the percipient; we can even perceive the sun and stars, within the limits of the definition.... " When we consider perception-visual or auditory-of an external event, there are three different matters to be examined. There is first the process in the outside world, from the event to the per- cipient's body; there is next the process in his body, in so far as this can be known by an outside observer; lastly, there is the question, which must be faced sooner or later, whether the percipient can perceive something of the process in his body which no other observer could perceive. We will take these points in order. "If it is to be possible to 'perceive' an event not in the per-</page><page sequence="8">272 H. A. PRICHARD: cipient's body, there must be a physical process in the outer world such that, when a certain event occurs, it produces a stimulus of a certain kind at the surface of the percipient's body. " If there were not, in the physical world, processes spreading out from centres and retaining certain characters practically unchanged, it would be impossible for different percipients to perceive the same object from different points of view, and we should not have, been able to discover that we all live in a common world. " We come now to the process in the percipient's body, in so far as this can be perceived by an outside observer. This raises no new philosophical problems, because we are still concerned, as before, with the perception of events outside the observer's body. The observer, now, is supposed to be a physiologist, observing, say, what goes on in the eye when light falls upon it. His means of knowing are, in principle, exactly the same as in the observation of dead matter. An event in an eye upon which light is falling causes light-waves to travel in a certain manner until they reach the eye of the physiologist. They there cause a process in the physiologist's eye and optic nerve and brain, which ends in what he calls ' seeing what happens in the eye he is observing'. But this event, which happens in the physiologist, is not what happened in the eye he was observing; it is only connected with this by a complicated causal chain. Thus our knowledge of physiology is no more direct or intimate than our knowledge of processes in dead matter; we do not know any more about our eyes than about the trees and fields and clouds that we see by means of them. The event which happens when a physiologist observes an eye is an event in him, not in the eye that he is observing." 1 Up to this point Mr. Russell can be considered to be referring to perception as if it were a physical process in the brain; but he now goes on to treat it as a mental process, and to imply that this mental process and the brain process are the same. " We come now at last to the question of self-observation.. . . No one can deny that we know things about ourselves which others cannot know unless we tell them. We know when we have toothache, when we feel thirsty, what we were dreaming when we woke up, and so on. Dr. Watson might say that the dentist can know we have toothache by observing a cavity in a tooth. . . . But even then his knowledge has a different character from mine. His knowledge is an inference, based upon the inductive law that people with such-and such cavities suffer pain of a certain kind. But this law cannot be established by observation of cavities alone; it requires that, where these are observed, the people who have them should tell us that they feel toothache." 2 " Let us consider Dr. Watson watching a rat in a maze. He means to be quite objective, and report only what really goes on. . . . But I think he fails to realise that almost as long and difficult an inference is required to give us knowledge of the rat's bodily movements as to give us knowledge of its 'mind'. And what is more, the data from which we must start in order to get to know the rat's bodily move- ments are data of just the sort that Dr. Watson wishes to avoid, namely private data patent to self-observation but not patent to any one except the observer. This is the point at which, in my opinion, behaviourism as a final philosophny breaks down." 3 'Pp. 129-132. 2 Pp. 132-133. 3Pp. 134-135.</page><page sequence="9">MR. BERTRAND RUSSELL'S OUTLINE OF PHILOSOPHY". 273 Here by " the data from which we must start in order to get to know the rat's bodily movements" Mr. Russell must mean those facts the direct, i.e., perceptive, knowledge of which forms the premisses from which we infer the rat's movements. And he must consider these facts to consist in what a few pages later1 he calls percepts, viz., certain patches of colour. This is evident not only from his previous state- ment about the knowledge of our toothache which only the actual sufferer can have directly, but also from his subsequent statement 2 that our knowledge of the physical world, if it is to be made as reliable as possible, must start from percepts. It is also clear that if this criticism of Dr. Watson is con- nected with what he has already said, he must be implying that these patches of colour are the process in our (the observer's) brain of which he has been speaking. This identification, too, is implied in the next paragraph, in which he refers to the data patent to self-observation as if they were brain processes. " When several people simultaneously watch a rat in a maze, or any other example of what we should naturally regard as matter in motion, there is by no means complete identity between the physical events which happen at the surface of their eyes and constitute the stimuli to their perceptions. There are differences of perspective, of light and shade, of apparent size,3 and so on, all of which will be re- produced in photographs taken from the places where the eyes of the several observers are. These differences produce differences in the reactions of the observers-differences which a quite unthinking person may overlook, but which are familiar to every artist. . . . Our knowledge of the physical world, therefore, must be contained [i.e., included] in our reaction to the stimulus which reaches us across the intervening medium.... Since the stimulus differs for different observers, the reaction also differs; consequently, in all our perceptions of physical processes there is an element of subjectivity. If, therefore, physics is true in its broad outlines (as the above argument supposes), what we call ' perceiving' a physical process is something private and subjective, at least in part, and is yet the only possibly starting-point for our knowledge of the physical world." 4 " Our non-inferential knowledge of an object cannot be more accurate than our reaction to it, since it is part of that reaction. And our reaction cannot be more accurate than the stimulus. But what on earth can you mean by the ' accuracy ', of a stimulus ? I may be asked. I mean just the same as by the accuracy of a map or a set of statistics. I mean a certain kind of correspondence. One pattern is an accurate representation of another if every element of the one can be taken as the representative of just one element of the other, and the relations that make the one set into a pattern correspond with relations making I p. 139. 2 p. 141. 3 Mr. Russell does not explain how " differences of perspective, of light and shade, of apparent size " can have a physical meaning or how there can be a species of size called " apparent size ". 4 pp. 135-136.</page><page sequence="10">274 H. A. PRICHARD: the other set into a pattern. . . . And whatever limitations there are to the accuracy of our impressions are limitations to the accuracy of our non-inferential knowledge of the external world." 1 Mr. Russell next takes the opportunity to make a point which must be described as astonishing unless we allow that he is really treating a certain brain process first as if it was identical with certain conjectures about the cauae of that brain process drawn from a knowledge of that process which we do not possess, and finally, as if it was identical with that knowledge itself. " If we accept the definjtion of knowledge given in Chapter VIII., which was framed so as to be as favourable as possible to behaviour- ism, a given reaction may be regarded as knowledge of various different occurrences. When we see Jupiter, we have, according to the defini- tion, knowledge of Jupiter, but we also have knowledge of the stimulus at the surface of the eye, and even of the process in the optic nerve, For it is arbitrary at what point we start in the process leading to a certain event in the brain: this event, and the consequent bodily action, may be regarded as a reaction to a process starting at any earlier point. And the nearer our starting-point is to the brain, the more accurate becomes the knowledge displayed in our ireaction. A lamp at the top of a tall building might produce the same visual stimulus as Jupiter, or, at any rate, one practically indistinguish- able from that produced by Jupiter. . . . Thus when we think we see Jupiter, we may be mistaken. We are less likely to be mistaken if we say that the surface of the eye is being stimulated in a certain way, and still less likely to be mistaken if we say that the optic nerve is being stimulated in a certain way. We do not eliminate the risk of error completely unless we confine ourselves to saying that an event of a certain sort is happening in the brain; this statement may still be true if we see Jupiter in a dream."' 2 From this point onwards the identification of percept and brain process becomes explicit. " But, I shall be asked, what do you know about what is happening in the brain ? Surely nothing. Not so, I reply. I know about what is happening in the brain exactly what naive realism thinks it knows about what is happening in the outside world." 3 In other words: where we are said to see a rat moving in front of us, we really see certain patches of colour, and these patches are a physical process in our brain. The behaviour- ist, therefore, is right in thinking, with the naive realist, that what we see is a physical process. But, together with the naive realist, he is mistaken in thinking that the physical process which we see is the movement of the rat; the truth is that it is the process in our brain which the rat's move- ment indirectly excites. It therefore appears that Mr. Russell is maintaining the I P. 137. 2p. 138. P. 138.</page><page sequence="11">MR. BERTRAND RUSSELL'S OUTLINE OF PHILOSOPHY. 275 identity of two things, viz., a percept and a brain process, which can no more be identical than can V -1 and a piece of soap, or the end of a line and an emotion, and of which, whether they are identical or not, neither can possibly be a perception, as distinct from something which we perceive. The view seems so extravagant that it is difficult to be con- fident that Mr. Russell holds it. But the next chapter leaves no room for doubt. In this chapter, which is entitled Physical and Perceptual Space, Mr. Russell appears in effect to endeavour to give plausibility to this impossible view by advancing another view equally impossible. " The gist of the matter is that percepts, which we spoke about at the end of last chapter, are in our heads; that percepts are what we can know with most certainty; and that percepts contain [i.e., spatially include] what naive realism thinks it knows about the world. " But when I say that my percepts are in my head, I am saying something which is ambiguous until the different kinds of space have been explained, for the statement is only true in connexion with physical space. There is also a space in our percepts, and of this space the statement would not be true. When I say that there is space in our percepts, I mean nothing at all difficult to understand. I mean-to take the sense of sight, which is the most important in this connexion-that in what we see at one time there is up and down, right and left, inside and outside. If we see, say, a circle on a blackboard, all these relations exist within what we see. The circle has a top half an4 'bpttom half, a right-hand half and a left-hand half, an inside and an 6utMide. These relations alone are enough to make up a space of sorts. . . . The point that concerns us is that a man's percepts are private to himself: what I see, no one else sees; what I hear, no one else hears; what I touch, no one else touches; and so on. True, others hear and see something very like what I hear and see, if they are suitably placed; but there are always differences. Sounds are less loud at a distance; objects change their visual appear- ance according to the laws of perspective. Therefore it is impossible for two persons at the same time to have exactly identical percepts. It follows that the space of percepts, like the percepts, must be private; there are as many perceptual spaces as there are percipients. My percept of a table is outside my percept of my head, in my per- ceptual space; but it does not follow'that it is outside my head as a physical object in physical space. Physical space is neutral and public: in this space, all my percepts are in my head, even the most distant star as I see it. Physical and perceptual space have relations, but they are not identical, and failure to grasp the difference between them is a potent source of confusion." . . . " What you see when you see a star is just as internal as what you feel when you feel a headache. That is to say, it is internal from the standpoint of physical space. It is distant in your private space, because it is not associated with sensations of touch, and cannot be associated with them by means of any journey you can perform. "Your own body, as known to you through direct experience, is quite different from your own body as considered in physics. You</page><page sequence="12">276 H. A. PRICHARD: know mote about your own body than about any other through direct experience, because your own body can give you a number of sensations that no other body can, for instance all kinds of bodily pains. But you still know it only through sensations; apart from inference, it is a buiidle of sensations, and therefore quite different prima facie, from what physics calls a body. "Most of the things you see are outside what you see when (as one says) you see your own body. That is to say: you see certain other patches of colour, differently situated in visual, space, and say you are seeing things outside your body. But from the point of view of physics, all that you see must count as inside your body; what goes on elsewhere can only be inferred. Thus the whole space of your sensible world with all its percepts counts as one tiny region from the point of view of physics. "Each person carries about a private space of his own, which can be located in physical space by indirect methods, but which contains no place in common with another person's private space.... " To make the matter definite, let us, suppose that a physiologist is observing a living brain. . . . It is natural to suppose that what the physiologist sees is in the brain he is observing. But if we are speaking of physical space, what the physiologist sees is, in his own brain. It is in no sense in the brain that he is observing, though it is in the percept of that brain, which occupies part of the physiol- ogist's perceptual space. Causal continuity makes the matter per- fectly evident.... The physiologist sees what he is observing only after the light-waves have reached hig eye; therefore, the event which constitutes his seeing comes at the end of a series of events which travel from the observed brain into the brain of the physiol- ogist. We cannot, without a preposterous kind of discontinuity, suppose that the physiologist's percept, which comes at the end of this series, is anywhere else but in the physiologist's head... " In fact, everything that we can directly observe of the physical world happens inside our heads, and consists of ' mental' events in at least one sense of the world 'mental'. It also consists of events which form part of the physical world."' The doctrine is quite plain: when I am looking at a table, though the patches of colour which form what I see and' are my percept of (i.e., caused by) a table are outside those patches which are my percept of, i.e., caused by, my head in my private visual space, they are nevertheless inside my head in physical space and the physicist is right in regarding them thus. M'fy percept, thus regarded, is a brain process; at the same time the process in respect of the characteristic in which I apprehend it directly, i.e., perceive it, is a bundle of sensations, and so it turns out that my brain process as known to me in perception is quite different2 from that process as it is rightly regarded by the physicist. It is hardly necessary to point out that the view cannot possibly be true.

In fact the reader is left chiefly puzzled to discover how Mr. Russell can have ever come to persuade himself that the one may conceivably be the otber. For the only reason which he gives for the identification, viz., that causal continuity makes the matter perfectly evident, does not make the identity evident at all. Probably the explanation lies partly in his analysis of what are called bodies, which he considers really to consist of strings of events; and partly in his distinction between so- called "private perceptual spaces" and so-called "physical space," since these phrases have a certain speciousness so long as their meaning is not considered. But it can only be to back up one mistake by another to support the identity of what Mr. Russell calls 'percepts' and physical processes by appeal to the distinction between physical space and private perceptual spaces. This distinction may nowadays be popular, especially with psychologists and with those who do not mind using words in Pickwickian senses and do not consider closely the meaning of what they are saying. But those who appeal to the distinction do not appear to ask themselves whether there is any thought corresponding to the use of such phrases as " a plurality of spaces," " a visual space," "my private' visual space". Otherwise they would be inevitably led to recognise (1) that it is only possible to think that there is one space, (2) that by " spaces" can only be meant parts of the one space, (3) that if patches of colour are what we see, they are in the one space which is the space in which bodies are, if there are bodies, and (4) that " my private visual space," which must in the fend mean a space dependent on my seeing it, is a mere contradiction in terms. The conclusion to'which Mr. Russell finds himself driven by his own view is not surprising. After saying (1) that everythina which we can directly observe of the physical world happens inside our heads and consists of " mental" events in at least one sense of the word mental, and (2) that it also consists of events which form part of the physical world, he continues thus: " The development of this point of view will lead us to the con- clusion that the distinction between mind and matter is illusory. The stuff of the world may be called physical or mental or both or neither, as we please; in fact, the words serve no purpose. There is only one definition of the words that is unobjectionable: ' physical' is what is dealt with by physics, and ' mental' is what is dealt with by psychology." 1 ' P. 148. It seems useless to define " physical " as what is dealt with by physics, and mental as what' is dealt with by psychology. For</page><page sequence="14">278 H. A. PRICHARD: In other words, Mr. Russell, forced to the conclusion that a purely mental process and a physical process in our brain are one and the same thing, naturally draws the further conclusion that a process which is both cannot really be either, and that, therefore, what we call the world consists of processes which possess no definite character whatever; or are at least not known to have any definite character. He thus appears to arrive by a quite different route at a scepticism similar to that which really underlies Bradley's "Appearance and Reality ". Mr. Russell's account of matter and motion follows lines which he and others have already made familiar. " So long as we continue to think in terms of bodies moving, and try to adjust this way of thinking to the new ideas by successive corrections, we shall only get more and more confused. The only way to get clear is to make a fresh start, with events instead of bodies. " In physics ' an event' [e.g., an explosion or the starting of a light wave from an atom] is anything which, according to the old notions, would be said to have both a date and a place." 1 "An 'event,' as I understand it, is something having a small finite duration and a small finite extension in space." 2 " Some strings of events make up what we regard as the history of one body; some make up the course of one light-wave; and so on. The unity of a body is a unity of history-it is like the unity of a tune, which takes time to play, and does not exist whole in any one moment." 1 " Now it will be observed that I have been speaking freely of bodies and motion, although I said that bodies were merely certain strings of events. That being so, it is of course necessary to say what strings of events constitute bodies, since not all continuous strings of events do so, nor even all geodesics. Until we have defined the sort of thiDg that makes a body, we cannot legitimately speak of motion, since this involves the presence of one body on different occasions. . . " " To say that an atom persists is like saying that a tune persists. If a tune takes five minutes to play, we do not conceive of it as a single thing which exists throughout that time, but as a series of notes, so related as to form a unity. In the case of the tune, the unity is aesthetic; in the case of the atom, it is -causal. But when I say 'causal' I do not mean exactly what the word naturally conveys. There must be no idea of compulsion or 'force' [i.e., really no idea "physics " and " psychology " are names of studies, and there can be no means of distinguishing one study from another except by reference to the differences of the nature of the things studied. Unless we know the nature of the different things studied, the words which stand for the studies of them can have no meaning whatever.

BERTRAND RUSSELL S OUTLINE OF PHILOSOPHY. 279 of causing], neither the force of contact which we imagine we see between billiard balls nor the action at a distance which was formerly supposed to constitute gravitation. There is merely an observed law of succession from next to next."' Unfortunately, though Mr. Russell devotes a chapter to causal laws in physics, he offers no explanation of what he means by "a law". But as he considers the notion of " necessity" "purely anthropomorphic, and not based on any discoverable feature of the world," 2 what he refers to as a law of succession (and afterwards also as a law of correla- tion), which he considers to constitute the " causal" unity of a certain string of events ABCD which is what we call a body, can only really consist in the observed fact that similar events A1B1C1Dl, A2B2C2D2 b . . bave occurred in the same order as ABCD. It is, of course, difficult to see how this fact can give any unity, just as it would be difficult to see how a random series of musical notes could acquire a unity owing to the fact that it had been preceded by a number of similar random series; and hence it is not surprising that Mr. Russell, who denies that we have any knowledge of necessity, finds that induction " raises perhaps the most difficult problem in the whole theory of knowledge." 3 But, however this may be, Mr. Russell develops his account of the unity of a body thus: " As we suggested before, it is these correlations of events that lead to the definition of permanent ' things'. There is no essential difference, as regards substantiality, between an electron and a light- ray. Each is really a string of events or of sets of events. In the case of the light-ray, we have no temptation to think otherwise. But in the case of- the electron, we think of it as a single persistent entity. There may be such an entity, but we can have no evidence that there is. What we can discover is (a) a group of events spreading outwards from a centre-say, for definiteness, the events constituting a wave of light-and attributed, hypothetically, to a ' cause' in that centre; (b) more or less similar groups of events at other times, connected with the first group according to the laws of physics, and therefore attributed to the same hypothetical cause at other times. But all that we ought to assume is series of groups of events, connected by discoverable laws. These series we may define as " matter ". Whether there is matter in any other sense, no one can tell." I At the risk of seeming both ultra-dogmatic and also in- capable of understanding even the meaning of the statements in which the new higher truth has to be expressed, I should like to ask Mr. Russell and those who think with him whether there is really a word of truth in this view from beginning to end.

PRICHARD: In ordinary language " an event " is used both for a process of change, which, as such, has a duration, however small, e.g., the movement of a train into a station, and for the beginning or ending of a process which forms a limit of the process, and has no duration, e.g., the train's coming to a stop in the station. And as Mr. Russell says that he means by "an event" something having a small finite duration, it is best, in order to avoid ambiguity, to refer to what Mr. Russell calls an event as a process. Now in spite of what Mr. Russell says, no one really thinks that there can be a process without a thing or a substance, whether a mind or a body, which undergoes the process. Again no one really thinks that there can be such a thing as a movement, i.e., a change of place, except as the movement of a body, any more than any one really thinks of a move- ment, as distinct from a change of distance from another body, as relative. It may no doubt be convenient as a loose way of talking to speak of the movement, and indeed of the velocity, of a wave of light, provided we presuppose the existence of particles which are waving, i.e., undulating or oscillating; but not otherwise. And when we reflect, we recognise that talking thus is only loose talking, and given the proviso, we have no difficulty in substituting the accurate statement of the fact of which we are thinking. But it can- not be legitimate for Mr. Russell, who says that the difference in meaning between ' aether ' and empty space is only verbal, and who thinks, or at least says that he thinks, that there are no such things as bodies in the ordinary sense of the term, to speak as he constantly does of a group of events, or a wave of light as spreading, i.e,, really moving, out from a centre.1 No doubt he expressly attempts to deal with the objection that " we cannot conceive of movement apart from some thing as moving." He says: " This is, in a sense, a truism; but in the sense in which it is usually meant, it is a falsehood. We speak of the ' movement' of a drama or piece of music, although we do not' conceive either as a 'thing' which exists complete at every moment of the performance."' 1 But this is mere resort to metaphor, and even Mr. Russell shows himself unable to refer to the " movement " of a drama without the use of inverted commas. No doubt also he ex- pressly maintains2 that it is 'simply confusing ourselves to speak of motion in the ordinary sense, and that we can only legitimately speak of motion, i.e., use " motion " in a sense in 1 P. 125. 2 pp. 116, 118.</page><page sequence="17">MR. BERTRAND RUSSELL S OUTLINE OF PHILOSOPHY. 281 which it stands for a fact, when we have adopted his view that what is called a body is really a string of events. But surely the proper way to express this view is to deny that there is such a thing as motion at all and to maintain that what we take for a movement is really something else for which, in order to avoid confusion, we should use some other phrase. Yet Mr. Ruissell, in spite of his view, continues to use the term "motion" in stating what he considers to be facts. Thus he says, "To imagine the laws of motion of heavenly bodies, think of motions of objects in a mirror; they may move very fast, although in the mirror world there are no forces ".1 Here the reader wants to know what Mr. Russell means by "a mirror world" and by "objects in a mirror," and also what he means by saying that objects in a mirror move very fast. Mr. Russell would have in the end to say that in this instance, as in all others, nothing really moves and that what is here called a movement is really somnething quite different. Moreover in making statements about the nature of the physical world he continues to use the terms of ordinary language, such as " forces," " bodies," "motions," "causing" (as when he speaks of perception as " a reaction to a feature of the environment,") and he defends the practice on the ground that it is a convenient shorthand. It is true that accuracy is not one of the three respects in which he considers the philosopher desires to improve on our common beliefs.2 But the omission is probably accidental; and, accuracy apart, it is impossible to see how statements can be convenient ways of expressing facts if, in order to allow them to be true, we have to understand them in senses totally different from those which they normally bear. The fact is that Mr. Russell resembles Berkeley in that while he really holds that there is no such thing as a body, no such thing as a movement, and in fact no such thing as a physical world, he nevertheless considers that he is still entitled to use ordinary language in describing the nature of all that is left as a substitute, viz., what Berkeley calls perceptions and what Mr. Russell calls percepts. And it is not surprising to find Mr. Russell in the end confessing that his doctrine is really that of Berkeley. " We shall therefore be prudent if we regard the non-mental events of physics as mere auxiliary concepts, not assumed to have any reality, but only introduced to simplify the laws of percepts. Thus matter will be a construction built out of percepts, and our metaphysics will be essentially that of Berkeley." I IP.123. 2p.3. 3P.301. 19</page><page sequence="18">282 H. A. PRICHARD: RUSSELL'S OUTLINE OF PHILOSOPHY. It is true that he quickly goes on to add that he does not believe his own doctrine, but the addition is in no way a retractation of it. "In spite" he says "of the logical merits of this view, I cannot bring myself to accept it, though I am not sure I that my reasons for disliking it are any better than Dr. Johnson's. I find myself con- stitutionally incapable of believing that the sun would not exist on a day when he was everywhere hidden by clouds, or that the meat in a pie springs into existence at the moment when the pie is opened. I know the logical answer to such objections, and qud4 logician I think the answer a good one. The logical argument, however, does not even tend to show that there are not non-mental events; it only tends to show that we have no right to feel sure of their existence. For my part, I find myself in fact believing in them in spite of all that can be said to persuade me that I ought to feel doubtful." 2 In the respect of this claim to retain the use of ordinary language, Mr. Russell's predecessor, Hume, appears to have the advantage of him. It is true that Hume in developing his own view continues to speak, with the man in the street, of objects and of processes in nature, although his aim is to convince us that what we know is limited to impressions and ideas. But Hume always thinks that, if his view is right, the use of this language is wholly indefensible and it is absurd even to speak of physical science simply because there is nothing for it to deal with. 1 It is not obvious why Mr. Russell is not certain that his reasons are no better than Dr. Johnson's. 2Pp. 301-302.</page></plain_text>
