<plain_text><page sequence="1">abstracts Pater as Polemicist in 'Prosper Merimee' by John Coates Much recent Pater criticism has concentrated on his supposed psychological and sexual needs and on the tension and dilemmas his writing reveals. Perhaps the many attempts to decipher Pater's hidden messages have concealed his practical achievement as a communicator skilled in the rhetoric of persuasion. This paper explores Pater's techniques of quiet deprecation, his irony, the subtle changes of register and connotation in his writing, and the effect of his refining upon, and deferral of, meaning. Nabokov's Ada and Sidney's Arcadia: The Regeneration ofa Phoenix by Penny McCarthy This article argues that an important feature of Nabokov's Ada or Ardor is its evocation of Sidney's romance Arcadia and sonnet sequence Astrophel and Stella. Particular echoes and general thematic resonance are investigated, and found to be too pervasive to be coinciden- tal. Reasons are offered why Nabokov might have been secretive about such an ancestry. They concern his political, erotic, and literary self-construction, and underlie his whole oeuvre, adding a layer of meaning to his chosen nom de plume, 'Sirin'. Mme de Graffigny's Story by Robin Howells This article argues that Graffigny's Lettres d'une Peruvienne and Cenie tell essentially the same story, that of a woman sundered from her high estate and her betrothed. The pat? tern of interpersonal relations is present already in Graffigny's Nouvelle espagnole and La Princesse Azerolle. Graffigny's correspondence shows that this is a mythical version of her own story. Crises in 1743-44 involving her lover, her confidant, and her niece immediately precede the creation of her principal works. Her discovery in 1743 of Garcilaso's Histoire des Incas is associated with 'amitie' and with 'amour'. Contemplating Apollinaire's Bestiaire by Willard Bohn Apollinaire's 1911 collection of short poems, Le Bestiaire ou Cortege d'Orphee, ispatterned on earlier collections of animal myths and fables. Each poem is accompanied by a block print by Raoul Dufy that both interprets and complements the text. This article re-examines these illustrations, which have received relatively little attention, in the light of Roland Barthes's theories of photographic connotation: photographs, while seemingly objective or uncoded, in fact convey a variety of aesthetic and/or ideological messages. Barthes's sixfold categorization of photographic devices helps us to understand the artistic possibilities available to Dufy, the strategies he chose to employ, and the manner in which the prints comment on the text. Encounters with Matisse: Space, Art, and Intertextuality in A. S. Byatt's The Matisse Stories and Marie Redonnet's Villa Rosa by Sarah Fishwick This article offers a comparative discussion of these works of the mid-1990s. It demonstrates that both authors use intertextual references to artwork by the modernist painter Henri Matisse to reveal the status of art objects as commodities and the central role played by visual art in the production of home and commercial space. It asserts that the fictional depictions of Matisse's life and artwork enable Byatt and Redonnet to question the notion of artistic originality and foreground the life-enhancing potential of artistic creativity. The Cooked and the Raw: Zoomorphic Symbolism in Dario Fo's Giullarate by Antonio Scuderi Drawing on carnival traditions, from which derive the zoomorphic maschere of the commedia delVarte, Dario Fo makes extensive use of animals as symbols in his giullarate (solo perfor-</page><page sequence="2">286 ABSTRACTS mances). They function to subvert figures of authority, serve as symbols of human bestiality and are often combined with human forms as part of the grotesque register which informs Fo' theatre. In La storia della tigre Fo uses motifs ofthe fire-theft myth to suggest a totemic bond between humans and nature which, he believes, harks back to the beginning of popular culture. Nestor Perlongher and Mysticism: Towards a Critical Reappraisal by Ben Bollig This paper attempts a reappraisal ofthe last poems of this Argentine poet, anthropologist, and human-rights activist (1949-92). Many previous critics have either dismissed his mystical poems or explained them in esoteric terms. However, in this paper Perlongher's last poems are related, through the application of recent critical assessments of sexuality after AIDS, to earlier masochist aesthetics in his writing, and to socio-political changes that occurred in Argentina and Brazil following the spread of AIDS in the late 1980s. Here Frowe: Case, Number, and Rank in Walther von der Vogelweide's *Lindenlied' by Cyril Edwards Addressing itself to recent approaches to Walther von der Vogelweide's 'Under der linden' (L. 39,11) by Manfred Scholz and Joachim Heinzle, this article argues for a new interpretation of the key line 'here frowe' as a vocative plural, adducing evidence from Walther's lyric 'Nemt, vrowe, disen kranz' (L. 74, 20), from Hartmann von Aue, and from Wolfram von Eschen- bach. It proceeds to investigate the implications of this for the theory of the 'Madchenlied', the hypothesis that a peasant girl is the addressee of a group of Walther's love-lyrics. Kleist, Arndt, and the Swedish Monarchy by John Hibberd The Swedish items in the Berliner Abendblatter of 1810 are linked with Kleist's hatred of Napoleon and with his thoughts on the fate of Gustav IV. They contain an indirect call for militant action against French imperialism and include a piece by Ernst Moritz Arndt, who admired Gustav the reformer as well as the fanatical opponent of Napoleon and who scorned Adam Miiller's backward-looking brand of Prussian patriotism. They reflect, not a rejection of Hardenberg's reform programme, but concern that a division within Prussia between progressives and conservatives threatened the ideal unity of national purpose which was Kleist's overriding preoccupation. Towards a Critical Patriotism: The Challenge to Traditional Notions of National Identity Posed by the Dutch Historical Novel in the 1930s by Jane Fenoulhet This article examines the role of the Dutch historical novel in shaping Dutch identity in the decade before World War II. It argues that the historical novel contributes to and modifies patriotic sensibilities. The discussion is centred on novels by Arthur van Schendel and E. du Perron which offer a critique of the Christian foundations of Dutch society and culture and the resultant hypocrisies, and on Ina Boudier-Bakker's attempt to create an alternative female national symbol in the Joan of Are figure of Lady Jack. While the male writers' attack on un- critical patriotism was successful, it did not present such a great challenge to national identity as Boudier-Bakker's implied revision, in which Dutch women claim their place alongside the men. The Shortest Path to the Truth: Indirection in Fazil' Iskander by Marina Kanevskaya This article explores the narrative structure of Iskander's prose, linking his non-linear dis? course, tendency to branch out, descriptive use of language, and interaction with the word to the parody and self-irony typical of his contemporaries. The accidental, coincidental thematic links that inform Iskander's prose are connected to the alaverdi principle of the Abkhasian toast, where a theme for table talk is suggested by the toastmaster, who suggests another topic when the first is exhausted. The ensuing modes of improvisation and digression are analysed in Iskan? der's narrative structure. Body language plays an important role in highlighting the limitations of language. The article concludes with an exploration of Iskander's anthropomorphism.</page></plain_text>
