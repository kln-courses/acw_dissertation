<plain_text><page sequence="1">VINCENT COLAPIETRO Marking Distinctions and Making Differences: Being as Dialectic We are caught up in processes not of our own initiation. Our very lives in all of their dimensions (biological, cultural, emotional, intellectual, political, etc.) are instances of this. Their course as well as origin mock any pretension we might have of being completely self-authorizing or self-determined be ings. In general, these processes are not unlike conversations that we join at a juncture difficult, if not impossible, to determine. They carry echoes of previous exchanges and, to some extent, define the trajectories of future utterance. They conjure up past confrontations with others and hasten to ward future ones. Any one of these processes is nothing if not a series of confrontations with others whose otherness is, at once, a proclamation of difference and an intimation of intelligibility. As such a proclamation, this otherness confronts us as something simply to be noted or acknowledged: it is its manner of denoting itself,1 if we will only be attentive. But this other ness also confronts us as an intimation of intelligibility and, hence, as an invitation to query.2 It prompts investigation and invites probing. However, these reflections are themselves but the barest fragment of a complex intersection of contemporary conversations. It will be helpful to identify, even if only in a sketchy way, the points of intersection, the points around which so many of these conversations turn. Only thus can we follow out what is, in my judgment, the most important trajectory of the fragmen tary reflection with which we opened. SITUATING MYSELF IN SOME CONTEMPORARY DISCUSSIONS Within contemporary discourse, there is a marked emphasis on a cluster of seemingly related topics?most prominently, difference, differance, other ness, alterity, rupture, exile, fragmentation, incommensurability, irreducible plurality, and irreconcilable conflict (Bernstein 1992,57; Vattimo 1993). Often THE JOURNAL OF SPECULATIVE PHILOSOPHY, Vol. X, No. 1, 1996. Copyright ? 1996 The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA. 1</page><page sequence="2">2 VINCENT COLAPIETRO the emphasis is not merely marked but extreme?to the point where the very possibility of any form of mediation is by definition precluded. For practical as well as theoretical reasons, it is imperative to take seriously the emphasis on and indeed the celebration of difference. For these very same reasons, however, it is crucial to consider carefully whether in some instances we have not elevated a moral and political failure into an epistemological and ontological necessity (cf. Bernstein 1992). It is one thing to make a virtue of necessity, quite another to make a necessity of vice! Let us acknowledge that it may be "a self-deceptive illusion to think that the 'other' can always be heard in a friendly dialogue" (Bernstein 1992, 52). But let us consider as well that it may be a self-serving gesture to insist incessantly that the dis courses and evaluations of others are completely incommensurable with our own; otherwise we run the risk of transforming our specific, historical in ability to communicate with these others at this time into a universal, date less impossibility. That is, we run the risk of elevating our own unacknowl edged failure into an alleged necessity. Think here of the difference between "Communication is impossible" and "We have persistently and thoroughly failed to communicate."3 Our task appears to be that of finding a middle way between those ap proaches that give short shrift to difference, otherness, plurality, and the like and those approaches that tout court rule out the very possibility of commu nication, conciliation, mediation, and the like. The discovery of such a via media might itself turn upon our acknowledging that we are at every junc ture in medias res.4 So, in the spirit of William Desmond's Desire, Dialectic, and Otherness (1987), Beyond Hegel and Dialectic (1992), and other writ ings5?in particular, in the spirit of his highly suggestive notions of the plurivocity of philosophical discourse and the metaxological sense of be ing6?I want to explore, in my own way, an approach to being that also lays emphasis on difference, openness, and mediation. But, like John E. Smith, Richard J. Bernstein, Sandra B. Rosenthal, and Robert C. Neville, I want to undertake this exploration with the assistance of philosophers who still are, in reference to metaphysics, all too often ignored?or, worse, dismissed as crypto-positivists or proto-postmodernists! The thinkers whom I have in mind are the American pragmatists (Bernstein 1992,323-40; Neville 1992, chaps. 1, 7; cf. Martine 1992, 22-23). For some, the American pragmatists are, like the logical positivists, anti metaphysical: they are taken to be animated by a desire to draw an abso lutely sharp distinction between responsible, scientific inquiry and irrespon sible, metaphysical speculation.7 In truth, the pragmatists did not suppose that any absolutely sharp line of demarcation could be drawn between sci ence and metaphysics. The task of the philosopher is not to dismiss in a</page><page sequence="3">MARKING DISTINCTIONS AND MAKING DIFFERENCES 3 wholesale fashion all metaphysical discourse, but to evaluate in a painstak ing way specific metaphysical claims. Special attention must be paid to such claims when they are implicitly assumed rather than either forthrightly ac knowledged or explicitly formulated, for a covert metaphysics is inevitably an uncriticized one.8 If this is so, then the pragmatists are no more allied to the postmetaphysical project of self-proclaimed postmodernists than to the antimetaphysical undertaking of logical empiricists. In the spirit of the pragmatists themselves, however, it is imperative to conceive our inquiry, not as a narrowly defined intramural debate, but rather as an open arena in which the most powerful spokespersons of various tradi tions can confront one another. Moreover, it is imperative to conceive this arena not as the site of a purely polemical exchange in which only one side can win. It is perhaps overly sanguine to suppose, as Dewey did, that "the adoption of empirical, or denotative method would ... procure for philo sophic reflection something of that cooperative tendency toward consensus which marks inquiry in the natural sciences" (1981-90,1: 389). But the fail ure to attend reflectively to those objects and events that, in effect, denote themselves is a human as well as intellectual failure (1:374). Indeed, "What ever things we are compelled to pay heed to, things of joy and suffering, cannot have their existence honestly called in question" (1: 375). Ingenuity can lead us to be less than honest in our inquiries, so much so that we rhe torically deny what at every turn we experientially acknowledge.9 When we honestly and humbly acknowledge these things, we hold open the possibil ity of consensus; nothing more, but also nothing less. Neither such acknowl edgment nor a rational consensus growing out of a faithfulness10 to the com pulsive disclosures of our lived experience is ordinarily the result of a purely polemical process. Within the philosophical arena of mutual interrogation, a question con cerning being can still be addressed by spokespersons from different tradi tions. For the purpose of addressing such a question, I want now to recon struct two slivers of conversation regarding being. Let us, accordingly, turn immediately to the task of imagining these; the first and briefer fragment involves Heidegger and James, the second James and Derrida. FRAMING THE ISSUE The significance of Martin Heidegger's thought is in no small measure due to the force and persistence with which he marked the distinction between the question of Being and questions concerning the kinds of being to be discovered in and even beyond the world.11 The significance of William James's thought and, more generally, of the entire pragmatic tradition is to a</page><page sequence="4">4 VINCENT COLAPIETRO great extent due to the general emphasis on differences that make a dif ference and the specific attempts to ascertain just what these differences are.12 It is not often that Heidegger's efforts to mark the ontological distinc tion and James's concern to specify the practical differences between (or among) competing viewpoints are mentioned in the same breath.13 Yet this is just what I propose to do at this juncture. My intention, however, is not to compare two philosophers, but to suggest a Jamesian answer to a Heideg gerian question; that is, my objective is philosophical rather than exegeti cal. Of course, such an undertaking runs the double risk of being dismissed by Heideggerians for proffering a superficial answer to a profound ques tion14 and, in turn, by pragmatists for squandering a genuine insight on a bogus issue. But this risk is part and parcel of the undertaking. Whether it is averted can be determined only in the course, and not at the outset, of in quiry. Just as the proof of the pudding is in the eating, the worth of the tale is in the telling. "There can be no difference anywhere," according to James, "that doesn't make a difference elsewhere" ([1907] 1975, 30). Let us, then, refract being ontologically considered through the prism of James's epigram; that is, let us entertain (or play with) the hypothesis that the being of being is making a difference and being made different (cf. Plato's "Sophist" 247e). More fully, the being of beings is, according to my hypothesis, best construed as a ca pacity or power; it is either the actually secure or just the precariously pos sible capacity to affect or be affected by something or other. More modestly, let me simply propose that the capacity or power to function in this fashion is a mark of being. JAMES AND DERRIDA: A LIKENESS Even from what little I have said to this point, my debt to Plato should be obvious to those acquainted with his later dialogues. Think, in particular, of Plato's characterization of Being as power and, in "Being, Immediacy, and Articulation" (1971), of John E. Smith's creative appropriation of this Pla tonic insight. Regarding the issue at hand, however, my distance from Jacques Derrida is not altogether obvious to me, so it should not be supposed that the subtext here is to outflank Gallic cleverness with Yankee ingenuity! Even so, the focus of my concern is the Jamesian and, more generally, the prag matic sense of difference, not the Derridean; hence, the emphasis falls as much on both making and elsewhere15 as it does on difference itself. But there are crucial points at which the texts of James and Derrida ex hibit rather striking convergences. Let me call your attention to just one of these points, for the twofold purpose of noting an unnoticed family resem</page><page sequence="5">MARKING DISTINCTIONS AND MAKING DIFFERENCES 5 blance and of clarifying the hypothesis introduced a moment ago. In Prag matism, James suggests, Metaphysics has usually followed a very primitive kind of quest. You know how men have always hankered after unlawful magic, and you know what a great part, in magic, words have always played. If you have his name, or the formula of incantation that binds him, you can control the spirit, genie, afrite, or whatever power may be.... So the universe has always appeared to the natural mind as a kind of enigma, of which the key must be sought in the shape of some illuminating or power-bringing word or name. That word names the universe's principle, and to possess it is, after a fashion, to pos sess the universe itself. 'God,' 'Matter,' 'Reason,' 'The Absolute,' 'En ergy,' are so many solving names. You can rest when you have them. You are at the end of your metaphysical quest. ([1907] 1975, 31-32) It is instructive to juxtapose this text from James's Pragmatism to one from Derrida's "Differance." Near the conclusion of his address, Derrida asserts, What we know, or what we would know if it were simply a question here of something to know, is that there has never been, never will be, a unique word, a master-name. .. . There will be no unique name, even if it were the name of Being. And we must think this without nostalgia, that is, outside of the myth of a purely maternal or paternal language, a lost native country of thought. On the contrary, we must affirm this, in the sense in which Nietzsche puts affir mation into play, in a certain laughter and a certain step of the dance. ([1972] 1982, 27) What James in effect calls the magic-word and what Derrida in fact calls the master-name has defined the final destination of the ontological quest.16 This quest is tied to the assumption that there is a still point beneath the unsettling flux (Eliot [1943] 1971, 15; James [1907] 1975, 126-27), an arche govern ing the uprooting drive of epochal events (such events as Moses leading his people through the desert, or Paul founding a community of memory and hope, or?in the intellectual order?the launching of the quantitative inves tigation of natural phenomena). One might argue that, in this very quest and the assumption on which it is based, we witness nothing less than what Freud called thanatos, the desire for annihilation. For what is sought is a complete cessation of the restlessness inscribed within the innermost core of the hu man spirit.17 But this restlessness is itself one with our lives and thus with our will to live. So, when Augustine of Hippo confesses to his God that his heart will not rest until it rests in Thee,18 that is, when he confesses his deep est longing (overcoming the restlessness at the core of his very being), we can rightfully take this to be more than the confession of an individual man. (This longing is, within Western culture, the dominant form of what Heidegger</page><page sequence="6">6 VINCENT COLAPIETRO appears to have meant by onto-theo-logy.) It is, in other words, an epochal confession, an utterance in which at once antecedent tendencies are crystal lized and subsequent tendencies are projected (i.e., defined in advance of their actual occurrence). Insofar as this confession articulates one of the deep est drives within Western culture, a drive manifest in the period stretching from Parmenides and his stepchild Plato to James and his half-brother Nietzsche, it is (to repeat) an epochal confession?a single utterance in which a definitive aspect of an entire epoch shines forth.19 Abandoning the assumption that there is such a still point, such an arche, entails, if not a dark night of our metaphysical souls, at least a disorienting phase for anyone shaped by the dominant traditions of Western culture. And who among the readers of this essay has not been shaped by these traditions? It is a phase in which we taste that delicious mixture of freedom and terror, the moment when the abyss opens beneath our feet and the shadow of nihil ism is cast over all that is, including all that has been and thus all that at any actual moment carries us along (in a word, over our history). The attempt to come to terms with nihilism, to confront the abyss in all its gaping terror and exhilaration, is a task that the history of metaphysics, especially after Kierke gaard, Nietzsche, and James, has thrust upon us. Taking up this task means abandoning our quest for the still point, losing our faith in magic-words, and checking our desire for master-names. This is, at least, the counsel of both James and Derrida. Indeed, neither James's difference that makes a difference nor Derrida's differance should be con strued as an attempt to name this still point, to identify this arche. The func tion of these names concerns openness, not closure, though the dialectic of closure and openness properly understood militates against supposing a mutually exclusive relationship between the two poles. The function con cerns immersion in, not transcendence of, the ongoing stream of human history, though this very immersion involves possibilities of transcendence in a limited yet real manner. That is, immersion does not mean here insular ity or imprisonment within an absolutely simple location (cf. Whitehead 1925); rather, it means being a participant in a continuously self-transcend ing process (a process that alters its structure as well as substance as a con sequence of its own inherent dynamis). It is, however, imperative to resist interpreting this process of self-transcendence?or self-othering?in either a pessimistic or an optimistic way: moments are more or less opportune (cf. Smith 1969, 1986). Even in the worst of circumstances, real amelioration, however limited, or (at the very least) noble resistance to intractable evil is always possible. That such amelioration might unleash unanticipated hard ships and that such resistance might require tragic sacrifice simply under score our finitude.</page><page sequence="7">MARKING DISTINCTIONS AND MAKING DIFFERENCES 7 James does not propose that we abandon all of the traditional names ("God," "Matter," "Reason," etc.). At least some of these have their places and uses. What he does propose is that we interpret these names pragmati cally, that we take them differentially. On those occasions when he did in voke these names, he did so, not as a way of marking the still point, but as the means of telling just those differences which finite, fallible, and indeed mortal agents need to mark in order to survive and, beyond this, to flourish. But assuming this task in this manner involves deepening our sense of our own finitude, fallibility, and mortality; it marks a refusal to fall back on "metaphysical comforts," including the comforting slogans of those fash ionable discourses that pride themselves on having developed a postmeta physical hardiness! In general, the telling differences are both personally and historically pre carious differences: while our need to mark these differences is imperative (perhaps even part and parcel of our humanity), our ability to do so is prob lematic. For example, there is an ungracious and also unstrenuous mood characteristic of some human lives. These lives stand in marked contrast to the gracious, conscientious, and strenuous manner in which others assume their everyday tasks and make their most momentous decisions. For James, this difference is one that enables us to mark the distinction between the religious and the irreligious lives. Whatever we might think of James's man ner of marking this distinction, it is a difference that must be told?if some (including James himself) are to survive, let alone to flourish. So, too, I would argue is the difference between an inquiry committed to the ideal of objectivity and one undertaken by a person who eschews, rather than es pouses, this ideal. But marking this distinction is certainly no easy matter (Nagel 1994, 38). Often, those who rhetorically reject the ideal of objectiv ity nonetheless practically adhere to the requirements imposed by it (e.g., the detection of biases in one's own procedures and assumptions), whereas those who loudly affirm this ideal practically desecrate it. In general, the sort of differences that I have in mind might be called telling differences. The telling differences to be sustained and refined in and through our evolving practices are neither purely arbitrary nor transcendentally grounded distinctions. For example, the sophistic reduction of justice to a completely conventional affair needs to be contested, but so does the Platonistic de mand to secure an ahistoric foundation for judgments regarding the justice of an action, or practice, or institution. Whether Plato himself was a Platonist in this sense, whether he truly was such a foundationalist (see Polansky 1992), should not be too quickly assumed. The point needs to be argued one way or the other and the outcome of the debate is not at all clear?at least, not to me. My sense is that the Plato to be encountered in the texts available to us</page><page sequence="8">8 VINCENT COLAPIETRO is better than what I am here calling Platonistic. The distinction between Platonic and Platonistic is analogous to that drawn by David McLellan and other scholars between Marxian (what Marx himself actually wrote or thought) and Marxist (what disciples or interpreters of Marx have either attributed to him or defended in his name). Confronted with the dilemma of having to choose between a reductivist historicism and an ahistoric foundationalism, that is, between a view that assumes our locus in history to be an imprisonment in the present or the mirror-image view that assumes the sanctions for our moral, political, and intellectual judgments require a foundation outside of history (Bernstein 1983, 8), we might?with James and the other pragmatists?go between the horns of the dilemma. Specifically, we might seek a middle way in a thick, nonreduc tivist historicism that both owns and questions its longing to transcend his tory and also its drive to attain closure. Such a historicism owns as well as questions its longing to transcend history; moreover, it owns and interro gates its motives and strategies for attaining closure.20 Marking the telling differences and articulating a thick historicism would replace the quest for magic-words and master-names. Nonetheless, the words used to mark these differences and to articulate this history might them selves become incantations by which the arbitrary as well as the ahistoric are re-inscribed. The irony here is that the arbitrary will be reinscribed within a discourse aiming to contest that arbitrariness is the last word21 and that the ahistoric will be reinserted as an absolute presupposition of truly respon sible utterances.22 Human history, including intellectual history, is replete with such ironies, wherein the outcome mocks the intention. Alas, so is life. Despite this possibility, perhaps even inevitability, our task is to spell out the differences that make a difference, the telling differences.23 This task demands attending to both the historically established warrants for institu tions, practices, and discourses and the historically generated crises in these institutions, practices, and discourses. Reverence for these warrants should engender the motive and perhaps even the courage to confront these crises, though all too often it blinds us from seeing revision as the only authentic means of maintaining the integrity of some institution, practice, or discourse (cf. Miller 1982, 1983). All too often reverence prompts us to cling to the present form of some historical actuality, instead of propelling us imagina tively to follow out the trajectory of this actuality. James is quite explicit about this when he asserts that, if you adopt the pragmatic approach, you cannot look on "God," "Matter," "Reason" as clos ing your quest. Each of these in its own ways sets a task; properly under stood, it sets us at work within the stream of our own experience. Each "ap pears less as a solution, then, than as a program for more work, and particu</page><page sequence="9">MARKING DISTINCTIONS AND MAKING DIFFERENCES 9 larly as an indication of the ways in which existing realities may be changed" ([1907] 1975, 32). The characteristically one-sided emphasis of James and, indeed, the other pragmatists on change rather than conservation, on the revision rather than revival of traditional practices, needs to be challenged in the manner of, say, George Santayana (see Levinson 1992,123,148) or John William Miller. But efforts to revive no less than efforts to reconstruct these practices are prompted by a felt need to engage with existing realities in the hope of resisting certain changes and fostering other ones. So even, perhaps especially, conservatives and traditionalists in a time such as our own cannot help but be preoccupied with change. Accordingly, if we take making differences as a mark of being, it should be in a programmatic as well as pragmatic sense. Let us now turn to spelling out a little more fully what this sense is. DIFFERENCE AS A MARK OF BEING That which is completely negligible in every context and in every respect is, by virtue of this thoroughgoing negligibility, nothing at all. Put somewhat more succinctly, whatever is absolutely negligible is effectively nonexist ent. And, indeed, what would totally ineffective (or unefficacious) existence look like or show itself to be? In contrast, that which is, however fleetingly or gently, a differential factor or force secures for itself, by virtue of this capacity, an ontological status, no matter how humble or (from the inhospi table perspective of our cruder preoccupations) negligible. Whatever is, in whatever way, is such that it could be a factor or force in an agon. It is such that it could, either by means of its own efficacy or through the medium of another, make itself felt. One motive prompting this empha sis is to counter the emphasis of Robert Neville's characterization of any determinate being as a harmony of essential and conditional features. The integral character of whatever is, in whatever way, is of a piece with its agonistic character. The differences between (or among) things is based largely upon the dif ferences that they make in various contexts, especially the everyday con texts of direct involvement. Water is what dissolves such crystals as salt or sugar, washes such surfaces as flesh and cloth, quenches thirst, conveys upon immersion in it a sense of renewal. That a thing is can best be ascer tained by its emphatic assertion of its own differential presence (cf. Peirce 1934-35 and Scheler [1928] 1970) and, in the absence of such assertion, by the discernible traces of that differential presence. Apart from making a dif ference and being made different, including simply being a condition of a process in which differences are wrought, it seems impossible that we could</page><page sequence="10">10 VINCENT COLAPIETRO ever know a thing; moreover, it seems unlikely that there could be any thing. This is not crypto-positivism, but (in my judgment, at least) a more generous and defensible construal of the insight underlying this philosophi cal movement and, indeed, humankind's more or less instinctive sense of the real (see note 9).24 The differences most dramatically highlighted in our experience are or dinarily those involving resistance to our dominant or actual tendencies of action. But the forceful manner in which resisting forces assert themselves should not lead us to overlook the ubiquitous presence of sustaining forces. The forces that sustain us ipso facto affect us, though they are less likely to be the focal objects of our consciousness than are the forces that thwart or, at least, resist our endeavors. Even so, these sustaining forces are real, and they are real by virtue of their capacity to affect us, however imperceptibly. For this reason, it is mistaken to suppose that the mark of the real is neces sarily that which runs counter to our inclinations, exertions, or undertak ings. (Above I only asserted that whatever is, in whatever way, is such that it could be a factor or force in an agon.) But since our resources might be transformed into limitations, our virtues into vices, our insights into blindnesses, we must acknowledge the possibility here of dialectic in one of its established senses (a process in which something is transformed into its opposite). CONVERSATION AS A MODEL OF DIALECTIC I do not simply want to link being with the Jamesian notion of making a difference. I also want to link this Jamesian notion itself with our lived expe rience of engaging with one another in conversation and, by analogical ex tension, with a living understanding of dialectic as a process in which differ ences are wrought and, on the basis of these, distinctions are marked. As the origin of the term suggests, dialogue serves as a model of dialectic. In turn, our experience of conversation as confrontation of one by another provides us with the materials and even the impetus to construct this model. Hence my subtitle?being as dialectic. To interpret being as dialectic suggests that whatever is encountered in experience exhibits more or less the character of a participant25 in an open ended discursive exchange (cf. Desmond). But these exchanges are never anything more than fragments inviting and, on occasion, even compelling completion or at least enlargement; and these participants themselves are, in their actuality, segments of a continuum. In such exchanges, the thrust to ward closure is thus ingredient in the ongoing, open-ended processes in which we are ineluctably immersed. While some forms of closure ensure the ongo</page><page sequence="11">MARKING DISTINCTIONS AND MAKING DIFFERENCES 11 ing and open-ended character of these processes and undertakings (e.g., those more or less fixed habits called virtues), these forms are characteristically themselves marked by flexibility. Also, the exchanges being considered here are analogous to (at most) fragments of conversations26 in which we either hear or suspect we hear snatches of prior conversations; they are also analo gous to fragments in which what is said here and now conditions what will be heard later. The interplay of self and other within language is a model for the inter play between the language-using self and the name-defying27 others that so often address this self in unsettling and even incomprehensible ways. But their confrontation with the symbol-using self is never simply a brute en counter; their confrontation is always analogous, however remotely, to an exchange between competent speakers of the same language.28 Being as dialectic should not be limited to the self and other in dialogue with one another. Nor should it be restricted to the dialogically formed self29 and the dialogically elusive other. This other can be a natural object as well as a human agent. The encounter between the self and such an other might be either the happenstance circumstances making up our ordinary experi ence or the contrived circumstances crucial for scientific experimentation. What takes place in such experimentation is a formal, explicit, and deliber ate process, in contrast to the informal, tacit, and largely unreflective en gagements of our quotidian tasks. What Peirce says about this process is germane to our discussion: "An experiment... is a question put to nature. Like any interrogatory, it is based on a supposition" (1934-35, 5.168). Ex perimentation is a process of interrogation in which nature is allowed to speak for herself, even if it only be a slightly more than mute negation?or affirmation?of our supposition (5.168). It must be extended to include the interaction of things with one another.30 Even those physical processes far thest removed from symbolic exchanges are, for all their antigenerality, prop erly conceived as a series of indexical signs, wherein the position or velocity of, say, a particle is indicative of its relation with other things. This is no idle metaphor; it is, rather, a heuristic principle embodied in scientific inquiry no less than common sense. So a threefold distinction is needed here. First, there is the experience of dialogue that serves as the model of dialectic. Second, there is the use of the model as a way of understanding our relationship to others, even when these others are not communicative beings of our own species or one closely re sembling Homo sapiens. Third, there is the more problematic extension of this metaphor to the interactions of things with one another, even when they are not communicative beings. Being as itself distinguished by its capacity to make and to be made different by its engagements and entanglements is,</page><page sequence="12">12 VINCENT COLAPIETRO on the hypothesis presented here, fruitfully approached as the fragment of a conversation. As a fragment, it calls us to what transcends it; as a conversa tion unto itself, it absorbs us within itself. CONCLUSION Manifestly, the approach that I have been developing does not itself tell us what concrete, practical differences are made by the differential presence of any determinate being. Even so, it marks a distinction that can make a dif ference, even if only a theoretical difference at the outset. Marking the dis tinctions that make differences and discerning the dynamic differences un derlying our very ability to mark these distinctions are, in the end, insepa rable. In other words, logos and onta are not self-enclosed domains, but pro tean figures in an open-ended conversation. In sum, it seems fruitful to inter pret being as dialectic and, in turn, dialectic as a process in which differ ences are made, distinctions are marked, and, thus, mediations are called for: being as dialectic is the call for mediation. But there are mediations and then there are mediations: there are different approaches to mediating differences (e.g., the Hegelian and the pragmatic). To be sure, then, there are distinctions to be drawn here, as well as every where else. The skill in drawing these distinctions is best acquired by those who have been trained in moving back and forth between (or among) diverse fields and discourses (cf. Desmond), for the differences we most need to tell are not ones in a clearly demarcated arena, nor is this telling to be accom plished in an antecedently established vocabulary (cf. Buchler; also Rorty). That the drive to reconcile differences is manifest at various levels of human endeavor, that the integration of these levels is always problematic (cf. Desmond; also Rorty), and finally that this drive itself might operate to exaggerate differences and to engender conflicts are ineliminable features of our metaxological status. Wisdom requires us to accept this status and to confess that neither the first nor the last word is in our command. But this confession should not be construed as a renunciation of logos. Quite the contrary, it is a way of allowing logos to lay claim to us and we to the re sources making possible the whole range of human utterance, from our barely articulate outpourings to our most boldly articulated insights.31 Fordham University NOTES 1. In a very late manuscript ("Experience and Philosophic Method") published as appen dix 2 to volume 1 of The Later Works, Dewey asserts: "The things which a man experiences come to him clothed with meanings which originate in custom and tradition. From his birth</page><page sequence="13">MARKING DISTINCTIONS AND MAKING DIFFERENCES 13 an individual sees persons around him treat things in certain ways, subject them to certain uses, assign to them certain potencies. The things are thereby invested for him with certain properties, and the investiture appears intrinsic and indissoluble" (1981-90,1: 383). Even so, he insists in this same manuscript that "we live in a world of objective acceptances and compulsions long before we are aware of attitudes of our own" (1: 381). For this and other reasons, he suggests that "we must not start with arbitrarily selected simples, and from them deduce the complex and varied"; rather we must commence with "the tangled and complex." This is "what we primarily find," what we experientially encounter (1: 374). "Philosophers have exhibited proper ingenuity in pointing out holes in the beliefs of common sense, but they have also displayed improper ingenuity in ignoring the empirical things that every one has; the things that so denote themselves that they have to be dealt with" (1: 374). 2. I am using this term in the sense assigned to it by Justus Buchler (see especially 1955, 1979, and 1985). In his sense, query is broader than either inquiry or invention; it is a process of probing in the most inclusive sense (e.g., whereas inquiry ordinarily means a process undertaken for discovery of the truth, query might aim toward any number of objectives, truth being but one of them). 3. "The possibility of the occurrence of genuine communication is," as John Dewey notes in Art as Experience, "a broad problem. It is a fact that it takes place, but the nature of the community of experience is one of the most serious problems of philosophy?so serious that some thinkers deny the fact" (1981-90, 10: 37; cf. 339). 4. It is appropriate to recall here the opening sentence of George Santayana's Scepticism and Animal Faith: "A philosopher is compelled to follow the maxim of the epic poets and to plunge in medias res. The origin of things, if things have an origin, cannot be revealed to me, if revealed at all, until I have travelled very far from it, and many revolutions around the sun must precede my first dawn" ([1923] 1955, 1). 5. This paper grew out of a presentation to the Department of Philosophy at Seattle Uni versity and into a presentation to the Metaphysical Society of America. William Desmond, the president of the MSA, set for the 1995 annual meeting the topic of "Being and Dialectic." This meeting allowed me in a single stroke to address a question with which I had been pre occupied a long while and to pay a debt to Desmond whose work I have, also for more than a few years, found very helpful. I should also thank especially Andy Bjelland, Joseph P. Fell, Gerry Galgan, Jim Marsh, Ken Stikkers, and Merold Westphal for their comments, criti cisms, and suggestions. 6. In the introduction to this work, Desmond explains that "the metaxolgical concerns a logos of the metaxu, a discourse of the between, the middle. We find ourselves in an interme diate place, inadequately interpreted either by totalizing holisms of the sort attributed to Hegel, or by the discontinuous plurality we find in deconstructive thought, [and] indeed in Wittgen steinian pluralism. My concern for this 'middle' acknowledges the contemporary concern with difference and plurality. But it dissents from any sterile opposition with discontinuity. Otherness itself asks us to think through the meaning of the community of being. A commu nity of being that sustains otherness distances us from merely asserted difference, as well as from any equally unfruitful sense of totalizing unity" (1992, 6; cf. Martine 1992, 17-23). Justus Buchler acknowledged that "so far as sheer generic breadth is concerned, 'being' remains the inevitable term" (1990, 3). Moreover, he argued that traditional terms of generic identification such as being, reality, and existence are sometimes unavoidable and, when used circumspectly, handy tools. Nonetheless he argued that these terms "suffer from many disadvantages and perplexities." So my own experiment here runs against the terminological strictures that he formulates in the opening chapter of Metaphysics of Natural Complexes (1990). Even so, the distance between this experiment and Buchler's own project is not nearly as great as it might appear. For the very rationale that Buchler proposes to support his substi tution of natural complex for more traditional terms of generic identification has in fact in</page><page sequence="14">14 VINCENT COLAPIETRO spired my own undertaking: "precise generalization is twin to precise differentiation. Neither is possible alone for very long, even on the least philosophical and most highly restricted plane of investigation. But the essential philosophic direction, if not the immediate commit ment of philosophic strategy, is from differentiation toward generalization; so that every triumph in the making of distinctions and the clarifications of meanings becomes the greater philosophically in so far as it fortifies a conceptual structure which grounds and locates it" (3). In this and other texts, Buchler provides a nuanced and compelling approach to the dia lectic of generalization and differentiation. My attempt here owes much to what I have learned from these texts. 7. A text from C. S. Peirce that would seem to support such an interpretation can be found in one of his reviews: "Verily, metaphysics is the Paris of the intellect: no sooner do the most scrupulously severe reasoners find their feet on this ground than they give the loosest reins of license to their logic" (1979, 182). 8. "Every man of us has a metaphysics, and has to have one; and it will influence his life greatly. Far better, then, that that metaphysics should be criticized and not be allowed to run loose. A man may say 'I will content myself with common sense.' I, for one, am with him there, in the main.... I do not think there can be any direct profit in going behind common sense?meaning by common sense those ideas and beliefs that man's situation absolutely forces upon him. ... But the difficulty is to determine what really is and what is not the authoritative decision of common sense and what is merely obiter dictum. In short, there is no escape from the need of a critical examination of 'first principles'" (1934-35, 1.129). What we take to be first principles are indeed taken by us, in the midst of all our present entanglements with their fateful implications, to be first principles. Hence, what Peirce says here in no way conflicts with my emphasis of being situated in medias res. 9. Peirce's manner of drawing this distinction is noteworthy: "It is the belief men betray and not that which they parade which has to be studied" (1934-35, 5.444nl). 10. It is noteworthy that Dewey does not hesitate to use such terms as respect, fidelity, and piety in reference to experience. For example, he concludes an important late manuscript by stating that "respect for experience is respect for its possibilities in thought and knowledge. Intellectual piety toward experience is a precondition of the direction of life and of tolerant and generous cooperation among men. Respect for the things of experience alone brings with it such a respect for others, the centres of experience, as is free from patronage, domination and the will to impose" (1981-90, 1: 392; emphasis added). 11. Any question concerning a transcendent being, that is, a being beyond the world, is nonetheless an ontic question: it concerns a being (even if Ens Necessarium or some other exalted form of being), not the being of Being itself. 12. To be sure, there are differences among Peirce, James, Dewey, and other pragmatists about what these differences are! 13. Even though this is generally true, Gerald Myers's exemplary study, William James (1986), examines how James addressed "various questions about the concept of being'1 (339). 14. It might even be worse than this; for the very assumption that the question of Being is a question to which an answer might be given arguably betrays a misunderstanding of the question itself. 15. Though even here, the emphasis on elsewhere might be contested as being a differ ence that makes a difference, for, after all, does not the Derridean "conception" of differance also involve a play of differences whose site is always and necessarily elsewhere (i.e, not present)? But Derrida's insistence on linking differance to deferral appears to be animated by a concern to undermine our ontological confidence (see, e.g., Of Grammatology ([1976], 70). In contrast, the pragmatic approach drives in the other direction. This is quite explicit in Peirce, James, and Dewey. For example, Dewey in his Presidential Address to the fifth an nual meeting of the APA defended what he called "the naive conception of the relation of</page><page sequence="15">MARKING DISTINCTIONS AND MAKING DIFFERENCES 15 beliefs to realities: that beliefs are themselves real without discount, manifesting their reality in the usual proper way, namely, by modifying and shaping the reality of other things, so that they connect the bias, the preferences and affections, the needs and endeavors of personal lives with the values, the characters ascribed to things:?the latter thus becoming worthy of human acquaintance and responsive to human intercourse" (1976-83,3: 97; emphasis added; cf. Peirce's Collected Papers [1934-35, vol. 5, para. 312). Whereas Heidegger and his fol lowers (including postmodernists in some contexts) are disposed to ask, "What... is the thing as thing, that its essential nature has never yet been able to appear?" Dewey and the other pragmatists are extremely skeptical of supposing that there is a radical discontinuity between our ordinary modes of discourse and reflection, on the one hand, and our speculative experiments and categorial explorations, on the other. 16. This suggests an all-too-reductivistic interpretation of traditional ontology. In fairness to the various traditions of speculative thought, all that one is entitled to say is that the dis covery of magic-words and master-names has been a dominant tendency within virtually all of these traditions. Even if one contends that it has been the dominant tendency, justice re quires one to acknowledge that countertendencies also have been operative. 17. In his characteristic manner, George Santayana asserts that "if to be saved were merely to cease, we should all be saved by a little waiting" (quoted on p. 201 of Levinson 1992). Dewey in his own way makes the same point: "If it is better to travel than to arrive, it is because traveling is a constant arriving, while arrival [what I am calling here the still point] that precludes further traveling is most easily attained by going to sleep or dying" (1976-83, 14: 195). 18. In fairness, we should recall that Augustine also wrote that "the seeking is more than the finding and the asking is longer than the obtaining" (Confessions 12.1). 19. Marking the boundaries of an epoch is, of course, no easy task. For general reflections on the marking of boundaries, though ones having a direct bearing on this specific topic, see Martine (1992, esp. chaps. 2 and 3). 20. There is closure and then there is closure. Dewey offers an important suggestion for how to mark this distinction when he notes in Art as Experience that "every integral experi ence moves toward a close, an ending, since it ceases only when the energies active in it have done their proper work. This closure of a circuit of energy is the opposite of arrest, of stasis. Maturation and fixation are opposite poles. Struggle and conflict may be themselves en joyed, although they are painful, when they are experienced as means of developing an expe rience [or perhaps of cultivating a skill]; members in that they carry it forward, not just because they are there" (1981-90, 10: 47). 21. There is an innocent sense of this term, for arbitrary might simply mean dependent on the will (without in any way prejudging the character of that will). It is, of course, not in this sense that arbitrariness poses a problem. 22. To espouse becoming over being but to claim that becoming is governed by immu table laws is, in effect, to reinscribe the ahistoric within the very heart of process. Important qualifications need to be made here, but the felt need to posit ahistoric foundations is perhaps nothing more than the contingent feature of a particular history. The extent and ways in which the immutable is an ineradicable feature of the processive are to be determined not by the demands of a mind demanding absolute certainty, but by the disclosures of an intelligence attuned to its own finitude and fallibility. 23. Another way to define the expression telling differences is to say that it designates those differences that persist in being marked. For example, if we say that all representations are fictions, we still need in numerous contexts a way of marking the difference between what is being denied, namely, factual and fictitious representations. Whether or not it is ad visable to retain the original distinction or to mark the insistent difference in innovative terms cannot be decided in the abstract.</page><page sequence="16">16 VINCENT COLAPIETRO This expression was suggested to me by my reading of John William Miller. For example, Miller suggests in The Midworld of Symbols that "the philosophy of knowledge is the prob lem of how to tell that one has made a mistake, or not made one. But one must be able to tell the difference" (1982,176), that is, to mark the distinction in either some historically accred ited discourse or some personally implicating practice (or, of course, in both). The making of mistakes and the marking of the difference between an appropriate and a mistaken act (in cluding an act of utterance) are more basic to our understanding of knowledge than the offer ing of justification and the distinction between justified and unjustified belief. To be sure, the distinction between justified and unjustified beliefs is a telling difference in my sense, though not as fundamental as many mainstream epistemologists seem to suppose. 24. In logical positivism and one of the principal movements from which it sprang? classical empiricism?the principle of difference is construed in an all-too-narrow and super ficial way. This is apparent in J. S. Mill's assertion that "the existence of the thing means, for us, merely its capacity of producing an impression of some sort upon the mind, that is, of producing some state of consciousness" (1865, 179). In contrast to this superficial and an thropocentric conception, there is the "profound" and antihumanistic approach of Martin Heidegger, who asks "What... is the thing as thing, that its essential nature has never yet been able to appear?" The thing as thing is, in effect and thus in reality, the differential presence; this differen tial presence is neither merely the sensorially wrought differences by a blindly reacting force nor something so elusive as to remain unthought or unthematized for centuries of reflection. Nor is the differential presence of what we commonly?and properly?take to be the mark of reality anything approximating an absolute presence or transcendental signified. (Recall here the text from Dewey quoted in note 4, in particular that "the usual proper way" in which realities manifest themselves is by modifying and shaping the reality of other things.) As we become temporally literate, we learn to resist interpreting that which is here and now as something all at once; we hear in it echoes of what no longer is and trace some of its trajecto ries toward what might yet be. 25. For an overweening rationalism, the totality of things is (to quote James) "in each and every part, and welds it with the rest into an absolute unity, an iron block, in which there can be no equivocation or shadow of turning." For "a modest common-sense," however, "the notion of 'partaking' has a deep and real significance. Whoso partakes of a thing enjoys his share, and comes into contact with the thing and its other partakers. But he claims no more. His share in no wise negates the thing or their share; nor does it preclude his possession of reserved and private powers with which they have nothing to do, and which are not all ab sorbed in the mere function of sharing. Why may not the world be a sort of republican ban quet of this sort, where all the qualities of being respect one another's personal sacredness, yet sit at the common table of space and time?" ("On Some Hegelisms" in 1956, 270). 26. In response to the likely objection that this is a mere anthropomorphism, it is not untoward to recall here Peirce's observation that "'anthropomorphic' is what pretty much all conceptions are at bottom" (1934-35, 5.47). Nor is it amiss in this connection to take seri ously his suggestion that signs (and what is a conversation but a nexus of signs?) are "the only things with which a human being can, without derogation, consent to have any transac tion" (6.344; emphasis added). 27. All I mean by this expression is that, in effect, objects and events, as well as humans and other animals, have the capacity "to speak back," to reject our attributions and designa tions. The immediate, silent agreement implying consent is but part of the story; the forceful rejection of our attributions and designations is an equally important part of that story called human experience. The extent to which things are ineffable, of course, cannot be answered here. Are all our acts of naming and describing acts of violence, because rooted in an egocentrism so severe</page><page sequence="17">MARKING DISTINCTIONS AND MAKING DIFFERENCES 17 that we cannot truly acknowledge the integrity of the other in its irreducible otherness (in particular, in its otherness from our wants, wishes, and fantasies)? Bergson, James, and Derrida sometimes seem to imply that they are. But it seems more plausible to suppose that our acts of naming and describing might also be ones of homage to the thick histories in which any concrete actuality is rooted. Of course, it is perhaps even more plausible to take our names and descriptions as a complex mixture of violence, handiness, and homage. 28. In many respects, Michel Foucault provides invaluable resources for articulating what I am calling here a thick historicism. But where I part company with him is on the root metaphor for conceiving such a historicism. "The problem is," as he rightfully notes, "to distinguish among events, to differentiate the networks and levels to which they belong, and to reconstitute the lines along which they are connected and engender one another." But the conclusion that Foucault draws from this is in my judgment unnecessary: "From this follows a refusal of analyses couched in terms of the symbolic field or the domain of signifying structures, and a recourse to analyses in terms of the genealogy of relations of force, strategic developments, and tactics. Here I believe one's point of reference should not be to the great model of language (langue) and signs, but to that of war and battle. The history which bears and determines us has the form of a war rather than that of a language: relations of power, not relations of meaning" (1980, 114). Just as Derrida in "Force and Signification" forces on us an untenable dualism of signs as either forms or forces, so Foucault here forces on us the untenable dualism of either relations of power or relations of meaning. Human war, no matter how brutal, is hardly ever simply a brute conflict. Of course, Foucault knows this as well as anyone; but his way of stating his opposition to structuralism and semiology land him in an undialectical position regarding the conjunction of power and meaning, war-making and symbol-making. 29. "To learn to be human is," as Dewey observed in The Public and Its Problems, "to develop through the give-and-take of communication an effective sense of being an individu ally distinctive member of a community; one who understands and appreciates its beliefs, desires, and methods, and who contributes to a further conversion of organic powers into human resources and values. But this translation is never complete" (1981-90, 2: 332). 30. What Peirce said in a different connection might, with equal justice, be asserted here: "This appears mystical and mysterious simply because we insist on remaining blind to what is plain; that there can be no reality which has not the life of a symbol" (1976, 4: 262). For Peirce's own support of the contention made regarding the interaction of things, see (for example) New Elements of Mathematics (1976, 4: 240). 31. For defining the boundaries and mapping the terrain of the domain of utterance, Charles S. Peirce's general theory of signs and Buchler's general theory of judgment are invaluable. John William Miller's discussions of the midworld of symbols are also instruc tive in this regard. WORKS CITED Augustine. 1955. Confessions. Trans. Albert C. Outler. Philadelphia: Westminster Press.
